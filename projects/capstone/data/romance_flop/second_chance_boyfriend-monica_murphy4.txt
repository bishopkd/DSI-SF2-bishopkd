But Im drunk and Ill probably mess it up somehow.His voice is soft and he runs his palm across his cheek, doing the very thing I wanted to do only moments before.My hands literally itch to reach out and touch him.Maybe we should sleep on it first.I cant face everything yet.My mind is working on overtime and I need to quiet it.Plus, Im scared about what he might say.What if I dont want to hear his explanations?What if hes only being kind tonight and wants to let me down gently?But then I remember his jealousy over Colin.The way he looked at me.How he kissed me, how his arms felt around me.Drew still wants me.I know it.And I still want him.Being with him tonight would most likely be a mistake.Am I strong enough to resist him?Is he strong enough to resist me?The pull between us is there, like an invisible thread that draws us closer and closer when were in the same room together.Can I sleep on your couch?I wave my hand in the couchs direction.Its big and looks comfortable enough.He shakes his head with a grimace.No way.Ill take the couch.You can have my bed.Oh, God.I cant take his bed.Itll smell like him.My imagination will run wild the moment I touch the mattress, the second my head hits his pillow.Its been too long since weve been together and having him so close, I want to launch myself at him and never, ever let go.Id rather have the couch.My voice is shaky and I breathe deep, trying to control my emotions, but Im ragged.Completely undone.A tear sneaks down my cheek and I sniff.I hate crying.I rarely do it.Fable.His deep voice is so low, it rumbles through me and I bend my head.I dont want him to see my useless tears.Look at me.I shake my head.No.He slips his fingers beneath my chin and tilts my face up so I have no choice but to look at him.His gaze is dark as he wipes away a tear from my cheek with his thumb.Youre crying.I blink hard.No, Im not.He strokes his thumb across my chin, his nail grazing the edge of my lower lip.I hate that Ive made you cry.I close my eyes, the still falling tears getting tangled up in my eyelashes.Im justI dont know how to handle this anymore.You.Us.Im sorry.He steps closer.I can feel his body heat burning into me.And then his mouth is at my forehead, his lips brushing my skin in a tentative kiss.So sorry.Another kiss at my temple.I didnt know what to say to you after I left.I was ashamed of everything that happened, everything you witnessed.You deserve better.He kisses the tip of my nose.Without thought I sling my arms around him, anchoring myself.Hes big and warm and solid, and my heart eases at having him so close again.I deserve you, I whisper.When will you realize that?Were quiet for long, agonizing minutes.My forehead is pressed against his chin, my arms loose around his waist.He slips his arm around me so his hand settles at my hip.His other hand is in my hair, smoothing it back, tangling his fingers in the long strands, and I sigh at his gentle touch.I never want this moment to end.I want to forget all our troubles and just focus on the two of us together.I dont deserve you, he finally says.You accept me so easily, no matter how hard I push you away.You need to know I dont do it on purpose.Its justthe only way I know how to deal is to run.His honesty breaks my heart.Im learning, though, that running away doesnt solve my problems.He takes a deep breath.Im seeing someone.A psychologist.Shes helping me a lot.I chance looking up at him and our gazes clash.Hes worried that somehow his admission might drive me away, I can tell.Thats good.Did someone arrange that for you?Had he told his father anything?Or was he still keeping all his secrets?No, I sought her out myself.Weve talked a lot about what happened.And about you.About me?Im shocked.After he left so easily, I figured hed forgotten all about me.Definitely about you.He trails his fingers down my cheek and I release a shuddering breath.You have no idea how important you are to me, do you?I slowly shake my head.When you left, I figured we were finished.I thought you were over me.I could never be over you.Drew clamps his lips shut.I wonder if he wants to say something else.I know I do.But I cant.Im not going to be as quick to reveal my emotions to him again.Not after everything weve been through.Im too scared.So I go with an easy admission.One not too far from what he offered me.Im not over you either, I whisper.Before I can say anything else, he yanks me closer and presses his mouth to mine.His lips are soft, damp, and very, very persistent.I open for him easily, our tongues sliding against each other, his low moan fueling me on.Fueling us both on.Just like that, Im lost.Drew Finally.Im kissing her again, tasting her, holding her in my arms.It feels so good, so fucking right, having Fable with me.In my apartment, back in my life.I dont know what I did to deserve this gift, but I refuse to screw it up again.Im not letting her go.Ever.I need her too much.I love her too damn much.I wanted to tell her that, too.I wrote the words in that final letter I left for her the last time we were together.Now, with her standing in front of me, my courage has evaporated.Im scared she might reject me.At the very least, reject the words and the emotion behind them.Instead, I kiss her.Id rather show her how I feel than tell her.Take me to your room, she whispers against my lips after she breaks the kiss.Take me to your bed, Drew.Grabbing her ass, I lift her up and she wraps her legs around my waist, her arms around my neck.She weighs nothing; her soft, curvy body fits against mine perfectly as I carry her toward my bedroom, all the while shes kissing and licking my neck.Making me so hard I dont know how Im going to stand the torture of not being inside her another second.Damn it, I want to make this last.I want to take my time with her and go slow.Being with her again is like my every dream come true and I want to savor it.But shes squirming against me, her hot breath against my neck making me shiver, and I know this is going to happen way too fast.We fall onto the bed together and Im careful not to land on her since shes so little.And perfect.Amazingly perfect as I pull away and study her from head to toe.Her long hair spills across my pillow, her chest rising and falling quickly.The lace top does little to hide the black satin bra shes wearing and I can see the creamy skin of her flat stomach.I desperately want to kiss and lick her there.The little black shorts shes wearing only emphasize the dip of her waist, the curve of her hips, the length of her legs.I lift up on my knees so I can see her more fully.She opens her eyes, the smile curving her lush lips a full on seduction.Its working.Fable can seduce me with one glance, one word, one touch.What are you waiting for?She reaches toward me, hooks her finger around the belt loop of my jeans, and tugs, but I resist.Im looking at you first.Her cheeks turn the faintest shade of pink.You can look all you want later.I need you, Drew.Please.What youre wearing I shake my head.Its killing me.She laughs.You should see the other outfits I have to wear as my uniform for work.Youll hate them all if you dont like this one.Jealousy flares within me and I tamp it down.As long as the customers dont touch you, I dont have a problem.Her laughter dies.Are you jealous?When it comes to you?Always.I slip my hand beneath the lace top, trace my fingers along her stomach.She sucks in a breath, her skin quivering beneath my touch, and I slide my hand up, until Im playing with the clasp at the front of her bra.Youre mine.You know that, right?She nods slowly, her gaze never leaving mine.II wasnt sure.After what happened between us.I always wanted to be yours but you left me.I close my eyes for the briefest moment, angry for making this beautiful, perfect girl doubt herself for even a second.Ive hurt you and I hate that.Im going to make it up to you, Fable.I swear it.The snap on her bra springs open with ease and Im eager to get everything off of her.I want to see her naked, see if shes as beautiful as I remember, and she laughs again when I tug impatiently on her clothes, trying my best to help her but really just making a mess of it.She slaps my hands away and slowly takes everything off, until Im left with my mouth dry and my body hard when shes completely naked.Fuck me, shes even more gorgeous than I remember.Its dark, I can hardly see a thing, so I lean over to the window above my bed and yank on the cord that cracks the blinds open.The fog is thin outside, letting the moons light shine inside, casting Fable in a silvery glow, though the room is still mostly shrouded in darkness.My gaze sweeps over her, lingering on all the important, pretty bits.Like what you see?She spreads her legs like a temptress intent on driving me crazy, and I swallow hard.Yeah, I croak.Fable sits up in front of me, her breasts swaying with the movement, her dusky pink nipples hard and earning my undivided attention.She settles her hands on my cheeks and draws me close, her lips brushing against mine in the softest kiss.Again and again, she kisses me like this and I reach for her, cupping her breasts in my palms, stroking her nipples with my thumbs.She arches into my touch, our kisses growing more frantic, hungrier, and then Im consuming her, my hand slipping lower, settling between her legs.Shes wet, so fucking wet for me, and I groan against her mouth.I need to be inside her now.Leaping from the bed, I shed my clothes, aware that Fable is watching my every move.I open the drawer of my bedside table and pull out a condom.Condoms purchased in anticipation of Fable and me being together again someday.Hell, at least I was always hopeful.I tear open the wrapper and roll the condom on, not about to waste another second.I want inside her so bad, I feel like Im going to burst.A wistful sigh escapes her and I turn to find her blatantly checking me out.Whats wrong?Fable jerks her gaze up to meet mine, her expression slightly embarrassed.You have the most beautiful body ever.You know that, right?No, but she makes me feel like I do with just a look.A few casually spoken words.Are you trying to embarrass me?She shakes her head with a smile.That youre embarrassed makes you even cuter.And sexier.Youre built like some sort of god, Drew Callahan.If we werent in such a rush, Id spend hours exploring your perfect body.Really?I climb back onto the bed and over her.Were face to face, our bodies perfectly aligned.That sounds promising.Oh, yeah.She nods, settling her hand at the center of my chest, her fingers drifting down.Gooseflesh rises with her touch.Youd love every second of it.I would?I thrust my hips against her, nice and slow.Probably a huge mistake considering how close I am to coming already.Mmm hmmm.She arches beneath me like a cat, brushing against the very tip of me, and I swear, if she does that one more time, Im done for.Id use my hands and my fingers and my mouth and my tongue.Until youd finally beg me to stop and put you out of your misery.I groan at her words.Im already in a world of agony.Then let me help you with that.She reaches for me, her fingers curling around my cock and guiding me toward her.I slowly sink inside her, her wet heat bathing me until Im nestled deep, and I hold myself there as steady as I can, savoring the sensation of her body accepting mine so easily.So beautifully.Ive missed you, I whisper against her lips before I kiss her.So damn much.Ive missed you, too.Her voice is shaky, her entire body is trembling, and I slowly withdraw from her, pulling almost all the way out before I sink back inside.We both groan at the sensation and continue the torturous slow movements for long, deliciously agonizing minutes.Over and over, I thrust in, then pull almost all the way out before I sink back inside again.Being with her again feels amazing.Already the tingling at the base of my spine is starting.Im going to come and its going to be a big one, but I need to make sure Fables along with me for the ride.Fable.I whisper her name in her ear, my thrusts growing harder.Its as if I have no control over my body whatsoever.Im consumed with the need to come.And to make her come, too.Are you close?I reach between us and touch her between her legs, her little whimper telling me I hit the right spot.Please tell me youre close.So, so close.Oh my God, Drew.Please Holy hell, she is so hot like this.All needy and desperate.Shes literally clawing at me and I rear up on my knees, grasping her by her waist so I can push deep inside her.Shes getting louder, sexy little murmurings I can barely understand, and when I hit a spot within her thats particularly deep, she comes completely apart beneath me.Her body is racked with shudders, her head thrown back as she convulses all around me.Sending me straight into my own spectacular orgasm that nearly leaves me blind.I collapse on top of her, my body still shaking, the aftereffects of my orgasm lingering for long, miraculous minutes, and she wraps her arms around me, holding me close, running her hands up and down my back.Soothing me, arousing me all over again.Youre crushing me, she finally says, her voice muffled against my chest, and I move off of her with a quick apology, getting up so I can toss the condom in the trash before I slide back beneath the covers and pull her back into my arms.Now that I have her back in my life, its going to be near impossible to let her out of my sight again.Which is ridiculous and unrealistic, but hell.I lost sight of herand myself already.And almost lost her.I cant risk it again.I know we should talk but Im too tired, she says with a yawn.Can we talk tomorrow?Yeah.I keep my arm around her slender shoulders and press a kiss to her forehead.Im tired, too.Sated.Satisfied.Sex makes me nervous, it always has.My past haunts me and renders the act forbidden.Shameful.Usually, Id rather avoid it.Avoid women in general, since they always want something from me that I cant give.Not with Fable, though.Never with Fable.Being with her so intimately feels right.Perfect.I like getting naked with her, both physically and emotionally.Laying myself bare, showing her everything I have, everything I am.Im not afraid when Im with her.Its liberating.Freeing.Like a little miracle.Id do anything to be your everything.Drewor Fable?Fable I think I have finally stepped into that fairy tale I always wanted to live in, ever since I was a little girl.Im living it, right at this very moment, getting dressed and ready for a lazy Sunday morning with Drew.He gently wakes me up by kissing me all over my face.Soft little kisses that make me giggle since his lips tickle my skin.When he slips his hands between us and starts tickling my stomach I laugh harder, our legs tangling up together, our naked bodies brushing against each other.Which in turn leads to us having slow, delicious morning sex.But before the slow, delicious morning sex, I searched his body as promised.Mapping it with my lips and my tongue and my hands and my fingers.Imagine my surprise when I discovered a tattoo on his rib cage, written in elegant script.Its a paragraph, more like a string of words in a poem.I trace each word with my finger, trying to decipher their meaning.For a passion thats Able to shine like ours Blessed are we to Love Each other  Im in shock that clean cut All American Boy Drew Callahan has a tattoo.And that he got it after we were together.What does it mean?I ask him, slowing skimming the words, each individual letter, with my index finger.He seems surprised by my question.Read it again, he says quietly.Slowly.I do so, realizing that the first letter of every sentence spells my name.Reminding me of the marshmallow note he left for me.Im shocked.Overwhelmed.Touched so deeply, tears form in my eyes, and he kisses them away as they fall onto my cheeks.I wrote those words for you, he murmurs against my mouth before he kisses my lips.Youve turned me into a poet, Fable.God, hes so sweetly romantic I want to lose myself in him forever.We take a shower together and that eventually leads to more delicious sex, leaving me so spent afterward, my legs are like wobbly noodles when we finally climb out of the tub.He towel dries me, his fingers sliding between my still wet legs, and he brings me to another earth shattering orgasm.Together, were absolutely ridiculous.We cant keep our hands off of each other.And I love it.I love him.I put back on my shorts from last night but its too cold to wear the stupid lacy top, so Drew lets me borrow an old sweatshirt.I pull it on, laughing when it stops just above my knees.I know I look ridiculous but he says I look cute, and then he sweeps me up into his arms and kisses me.Again.Thoroughly.So thoroughly I finally have to smack his chest and tell him I need to get home so I can check on my brother before we get carried away again.The disappointment on his face is clear, but he respects my wishes and we take off to my crappy apartment.The closer we get, the more nervous I become.What if my mom is home?No way do I want her to meet Drew.Not yet, anyway, because if this is going to continue between us, then eventually theyll have to meet.Its just a reality Im not ready to face.My mom is so incredibly embarrassing, with her drunken, trashy ways, how she flat out doesnt care about anything or anyone but herself.Drew thinks his familys all fucked upwell, they are, lets not fake ourselves out herebut my mom is no prize either.Whats scary is that Im constantly afraid I could turn into her.It would be so easy.Were a lot alike, as much as I hate to admit it.When we pull into my apartment complex parking lot, I notice my moms car isnt there, thank goodness.The relief that floods me is palpable and I immediately feel lighter.Drew comes with me to my apartment, even though I tell him he can go ahead and leave since I have to work this afternoon.But he insists on walking me to my door like a gentleman.I think hes afraid to let me go, truthfully.And I feel the same way.Pulling my key ring out of my purse, I go to unlock the door, when it swings open, startling me so much I drop my keys.Owen is standing there, clad in sweatpants and an old T shirt, his hair an absolute mess.He throws himself at me, his arms so tight around my middle, I can hardly breathe.Where have you been?he asks, giving me a shake when he withdraws from me.Ive been worried sick!I thought you were at your friends house.His outburst surprises me.Talk about a role reversal.I cant remember the last time Ive seen him so worked up.Ive been home alone all night.Moms over at Larrys house.She thought you were coming home.So did I.  I tried to text you and call you but you never answered.Crap.My phone mustve died.I bend to grab my keys.The excuse sounds weak, but its the truth.Owen glances over my shoulder, his gaze alighting on Drew.Who the hell is this?Jeez, why does he sound so hostile?The look hes sending Drew could kill, its so intense.Um I dont know how to answer.This is awkward.I didnt expect my brother to actually greet us.Wait a minute.Owen steps around me so he can stand directly in front of Drew, who towers over him.Youre Drew Callahan, arent you?Oh, shit.I didnt expect my brother to recognize him, but Drew is one of the star players on the college team.They have some minor celebrity status here in town.I am.Drews smile is easygoing and full of warmth.You must be Owen.Yep.And youre the asshole who broke my sisters heart.Without warning, Owen rears back his arm and punches Drew right in the chin.And sends him sprawling to the ground.Oh my God!I grab at Drews shoulders but hes already picking himself back up, his expression full of disbelief.Thank God, he doesnt appear angry.More like stunned.Im stunned, too.What the hell was that for?I ask Owen, whos rubbing his knuckles as if they hurt.Little shit.They probably do.He deserves the pain for pulling a stunt like that.Hes the reason youve been so miserable these last few months.I cant freaking believe it.You went out with Drew Callahan?Owen points a finger at Drew.When the hell did this happen?Watch your language!Its the only thing I can think of to say.I dont know how to answer him.I certainly dont want to confess exactly how Drew and I came together in the first place.It sounds so sleazy.If you snuck around to see him, I dont know why.Hes a big deal, Fable.Huge.Owen shakes his head.Im so stupid.I cant believe I didnt put it together, what with his initials on your foot.What does he mean, my initials on your foot?Drews gaze drops to my feet.Im wearing my black heels from last night, and the tattoo is obvious in the daylight.Hell, it was obvious last night and earlier this morning, but I dont think he was paying much attention to me below my thighs.The simple little outline of a heart sits high on the top of my left foot, the letters D and C stacked on top of each other in the middle.My homage to Drew and the week we spent together.The love I have for him.I got the tattoo in a fit of irrationality.I wanted to prove to him that I loved him enough to have him permanently etched into my skin.And he never showed back up.A foolish wish for my foolish heart, I guess.This was so not the way I wanted him to find out about the tattoo.Besides, compared to the beautiful poem he wrote for me, my tattoo seems sort of trite.Meaningless.She got it right after Thanksgiving, Owen explains, glaring daggers at Drew.She wouldnt explain what the DC stood for, either.Claimed it was for her favorite city, but I knew she was full of absolute shit.I mean, come on.Shes never even left California.Sorry, Fabes, he adds when he notices Im ready to chew him out for the curse.You got a tattoo.With my initials on your foot.Drew shakes his head, his expression incredulous.Why didnt you tell me?Show me?I shrug, not willing to have this conversation in front of my brother.Its silly.Its definitely not silly.He rushes toward me and takes my hands, his gaze dropping to my feet.I notice his jaw is red, it looks a little swollen, and I cant believe my brother hit him so hard.The element of surprise had definitely been in Owens favor.I love it.Your tattoo has so much more meaning, I whisper as he draws me into his arms right in front of my brother.I can feel Owens glare boring into our backs, but I ignore it.You wrote a poem for me, Drew.And you put my initials forever on your foot, Fable.I think were both on the same wavelength here or something.I hug him close and laugh, because I dont know how else to react.Owen clears his throat, reminding me hes why Im here in the first place, and I pull away from Drew, offering him a reassuring smile.Maybe we should talk later tonight?After I get off work?Yeah.Drew smiles, his blue eyes glowing.That sounds good.Want me to pick you up?Yes, that sounds perfect.He leans in and kisses me again as if he cant help it.Im off at eight.You have a ride to work?I can figure something out.I smile and he walks away, glancing at me over his shoulder one last time before he heads down the stairs and toward his truck.What in the hell was that?Owen asks when I drag him into our apartment and shut the door.What are you talking about?I stick my hands in the front pocket of the sweatshirt and breathe deep, inhaling Drews scent.God, he smells good.I might never want to give this sweatshirt back.Might never want to wash it, either.Gross but true.Youre seeing Drew Callahan?Hes your boyfriend?Owens eyes are wide.This is crazy shit, Fabes.Hes a total superstar.Like, a college legend.And youre with him?I shrug.Im not quite sure how to define whats going on between us, but yeah.Im with him.I guess.Holy hell.Owen starts to laugh.I need to tell my friends.Wade is going to shit a brick!Does Mom know?No, no one knows.I dont want anyone to know yet.I want to hold Drew close and keep him my little secret for a few more days.Once people start to figure out were actually a couple, things might get a little weird.Why the hell not?Hes awesome!Owen scowls, as if remembering my misery.Well, not really, considering how he mustve hurt you pretty bad to make you so mopey.Ive never seen you like that.What happened between you two?Its too hard to explain.I wave a hand, dismissing my past with Drew.Like Im going to tell my brother any details.Besides, lets talk about the fact that you punched him.What the hell where you thinking?That was amazing.My hand still fucking hurts.Sorry.I smack him on the head before he ducks out of my reach.I cant believe I actually threw a punch at Drew freaking Callahan and he didnt knock me out for it.I think he was too startled by the fact that a little kid tried to kick his ass, I said wryly.Owen shakes his head.Im not a little kid anymore, Fabes.When are you going to realize that?I roll my eyes but refrain from making a remark.Let him think fourteen is all grown up.Hell know the truth someday.Im starved.Still want to go to breakfast?Yeah, sure.But how are we going to get there?We dont have wheels.Shouldve kept your boyfriend around and made him drive us there.We can walk to that little diner down the street.Its not too far, I suggest.I need to talk to my brother alone, not with Drew as a witness.Im eager to have him back in my life, but I need to ease him into the chaos that is my immediate family.Drew Ever been on a complete and total high, only to have it come crashing down within a matter of minutes?Yeah.Me, too.All morning I felt amazing.Like I was walking ten feet off the ground.Even getting punched by Fables brother didnt faze me, though my jaw still ached.The kid is packing some strength, Ill give him that.I headed back to my apartment and crashed, my face buried in the pillow Fable used last night.I could smell her; her scent filled my head and I wanted her.Bad.She has a life, though.A job she needs to go to, a brother she needs to take care of.I understand, I get it.Im just damn thankful shes allowed me back into her life and is giving me the opportunity to make up for all the stupid shit I did to hurt her.I drifted off to sleep with her scent surrounding me, her face in my thoughts.Now, I wake up to my cell phone ringing and Im hopeful its her, but its not.Its my dad.Great.Whats up?I try to infuse some cheeriness into my voice but Im afraid it sounds false.I saw him only yesterday morning.What happened that he needs to call me within twenty four hours of leaving me?I had a long talk with Adele last night, he says, his voice grim.My stomach lurches.Just hearing her name makes me sick.Yeah?God, what could she have said?What did she tell him?Im reconsidering the divorce proceedings.Damn.Just when I thought we could have her out of our lives for good.Why?She swears shes never been unfaithful to me.That its all a bunch of vicious rumors spread by some women at the country club who hate her.Dad pauses, takes a deep breath.Should I believe her?Thats not for me to tell you, I automatically say because hell no.Im not playing any part in his decision.Besides, I know she hasnt been faithful to him from personal experience.God, I feel like Im going to throw up.Shes messing with my head.She called me when I was driving back from seeing you and when I told her where Id been, she freaked out.Demanded that I come and see her right away.So I went home and she attacked me.I close my eyes, wishing he would shut up.She was crazed.Like she couldnt get enough of me.I know you dont want to hear it, but it was the best sex weve had in years.I dont get it.I dont get her.Shes using sex to keep you with her, Dad.My voice is tight and I feel completely strung out.I hate hearing all of these details.Worse?I hate hearing that she attacked him after she knew hed spent time with me.What did that mean?I can only assume that maybe she thought of me when Fuck.I cant finish the thought.She probably is, Dad readily agrees.But if she keeps it up, I might not be ready to let her go yet.Hes an idiot.I want to tell him that, but I keep my mouth shut.Their problems are none of my business.I guess thats up to you, is all I say in response.Listen.We talked a lot last night, Adele and I.  She wants you to come home for the summer.She says she misses you and wishes you were around more.And I agree.Could you consider it?For us?That would be a mighty hell no, but Im not going to be a dick to my dad now.Hes still too fragile over this whole should I divorce or not deal with Adele.And look at her, trying to worm her way back into my life.Trying to get me to go back there.Does she think Im an idiot?I gotta go, Dad.Call me if you need to talk again.Tell me youll at least consider it, son.Adele misses you and loves you so much.Ever since we lost Vanessa, she hasnt been the same.You know this.You could bring some happiness back into her life.See ya, Dad.I hang up before he can say anything else.I dont think I could stand it.My appetite gone, my nerves shot, I pace around my apartment, completely on edge.I throw on some shoes and head out for a run, trying to clear my head, but all I can think about is my dad staying with Adele.Of her trying to convince me to go back home and spend the summer with them.I cant go back there.Thanksgiving had been bad enough.I still havent fully accepted what she told me.Its hard for me to wrap my brain around her revelation.Could my little sister really have been myd aughter?Panic fills me and I stop running, glancing around as I stand in the middle of the sidewalk.Wishing like hell I had someone to talk to.Anyone.Fable.But shes at work.Its late afternoon and her shift started at three or four.Hell, I cant remember.I cant waltz back into her life and lay the heavy shit on her anyway.I wish it wasnt a Sunday or Id call Dr.Harris Deciding to hell with it, I yank my phone out of the pocket of my sweats and dial her number.She answers on the third ring.Im surprised to hear from you on a Sunday, is how she greets me.Are you all right?Not really, I admit, thankful she doesnt berate me for contacting her on her day off.My dad called.Hmm.That doesnt sound good.Lucky you, Im in the mood for a coffee.Want to meet for one in, say, twenty minutes?Relief floods me.How did I get so lucky to find Dr.Harris in the first place?Maybe this isnt commonplace, her meeting a patient for coffee on a Sunday afternoon, but I need to get all this bullshit off my chest.Not just the bad stuff that happened with my dad, but also my night and morning with Fable.Ill be there, I tell her after she rattles off the address of a nearby Starbucks.So how do you feel about what your dad said?I take a drink of my iced coffee.Id rather he divorce her.I want her out of my life for good.I thought Adele was already out of your life.Doc looks at me in that certain way she has.The one that reminds me Im an adult and Im the one in charge of what happens to me.She is.But I want her out of my dads life, too.As long as shes still married to him, shes a barrier between us.One I dont want to cross, I say with a finality I desperately want to believe in.Thats your decision to make and one youre allowed to have.You know it will hurt your father if you cut him off completely without an explanation.She sips from her straw, her expression one of utter contentment, but I know what shes trying to do.No way am I telling him what happened between Adele and me.Hell hate me for it.I shake my head.He shouldnt.Youre his son.You were a child when it started.You were still a child when you put a stop to it.She was in the wrong.Dont you think hell see that?she asks, her voice soft.I have no idea.Im too scared to take that chance.Hell see what he wants to see.Hell believe what he wants.Do you really have that little faith in your dad?Ouch.I never thought of it like that before.Its not that I dont have faith in him.Its just she knows how to twist everything up.Shes a master manipulator and shes been playing the two of us for years.You give her too much power.She knows it and she revels in it, Dr.Harris points out.I shrug.Maybe I do.Its easier to avoid her rather than face the truth.You know how I feel about you constantly running away from your problems.Its not healthy.And they always catch up to you sooner or later.She takes another sip of her drink and then pushes the cup aside so she can rest her arms on the edge of the table.Enough focusing on the bad.Lets talk about the good.Lets talk about Fable.Just like that, Im smiling as I study my cup, running my finger through the condensation thats formed there.I already told you I was with her last night.Have you two talked much?I said I was sorry.For what?Ditching her.I meet Docs gaze from across the tiny table.The Starbucks is emptying out; its already near six.Most people are home fixing dinner or whatever.We need to talk more.That sounds like a good idea.Are you going to explain to her why you ran away?It seems that shes good for you, Dr.Harris says with a slight smile.I dont think Ive ever seen you look so happy.My smile grows.She is good for me.Im in love with her.Saying the words out loud makes them that much more real.And scary.Have you told her that?Not yet.Why?What if she doesnt love me back?My absolute biggest fear is that I lay it all out on the line for Fable and she doesnt feel the same.Or worse, she laughs at me.Though I know deep down inside she would never do that.I also know deep down inside that she probably feels the same way about me that I feel about her.Its easy to write the words I love you, to compose poems about her, declaring my undying love for her with a bunch of flowery sentences.Its another thing entirely making that declaration to her face.Scary enough just saying the words out loud to my shrink.Loving someone is taking a constant risk with your emotions.When you find the right person, the one you know you want to be with, that person becomes worth the risk.Dr.Harris pauses, studying me carefully.Do you believe Fable is worth the risk to you?Yes, I say without hesitation.She smiles.If thats what you believe, then shell want to hear those words, Drew.I bet she thinks youre worth the risk as well.We are afraid to care too much, for fear that the other person does not care at all.Eleanor Roosevelt  Fable The restaurant is relatively quiet, which is the norm for a Sunday night, according to Jen.My shift drags, the four hours feeling like twelve, especially because Im not keeping constantly busy, which usually helps pass the time.I check the clock and see that its seven thirty.Finally.Thirty minutes until I see Drew, and I cant wait.Sucks that Colin is here, though.I dont want him to see Drew pick me up.I promised him there wouldnt be any drama and that I would keep Drew far away from here.How was I supposed to know wed literally kiss and plenty of other things and make up?I seriously thought we were through.Done.Finished.Plus, Id been so freaking angry with him.Mad that Drew came back into my life like hed never left and tried his best to screw with my head.Kissing me, saying he missed me.All the things I wanted to hear, but not like that.A confrontation at my work is not the way to go in reconciling a romance.Funny, how things change completely in a few hours.I feel as though my life has been flipped completely upside down.In a good way.Youre antsy, Jen says as she passes by me.Im bouncing on my heels.Sort of hard to do, considering the shoes Im wearing.Were in the black dresses tonight.They skim our bodies and end mid thigh, though the skirt always rides up.The one I make sure and wear boy short cut panties under for fear Ill show everything I have with one wrong move.I wonder what Drew will think of my dress.I like the way it makes my boobs look, and Im wearing a special bra just for him.Full of nervous energy, I explain, which sounds plain stupid but hey, Im not lying.Why?She raises a brow, crossing her arms in front of her.Were hanging out at the waitress station near the bar, out of sight of the few customers who still linger in the dining area.Does it have anything to do with the guy last night?Well, shit.There are no secrets in this place, are there?Maybe.Jen smiles and shakes her head.Colin is going to kill you.Oh, give me a break.I wave a dismissive hand, but my stomach starts turning.What if Colin gets mad about me being with Drew?Not that he can control my personal life, but I did promise him there would be no boyfriend trouble.Hes worried about you.He thinks the guy who was hanging around here last night could become a problem.Who is he, anyway?I thought he looked sort of familiar.Im not telling her.Bad enough Owen is still flipping out over the fact that Im dating Drew.If thats what I can call it.Hes no one that you would know, I lie, because practically everyone in this small town has heard his name mentioned at least once or twice.Huh.Well, if I were you, Id keep him a secret, Jen warns.Okay, now Im getting irritated.Whats up with Colin being so nosy about our personal lives, anyway?Its sort of weird, dont you think?I mean, hes our boss.Isnt he afraid of crossing a line?Trust me, he always stays far enough over the line to never do anything improper, Jen says, rushing to his defense, which is no surprise.She lives with the guy, after all.Talk about improper, but who am I to judge?He doesnt want any trouble at work.Theres been drama at his restaurants in the past, especially with the people whove worked for him.He has a strict no dating policy for his employees.Oh, I bet he does.So why does Jen live with him?And Im sure youre wondering whats going on between us, but its nothing.Absolutely nothing, Jen says as if she can read my mind.Hes merely kind enough to offer me a place to stay while I get my crap together again.Thats very nice of him, I say, and she rolls her eyes.Im sure you think were having some sort of secret love affair.If you say you dont, then you dont.I shrug.Just be careful, Fable.I like you.Youre the nicest person in this place because as Im sure you realize, we work with a bunch of bitches.We both laugh over this.The other girls virtually ignore us.
