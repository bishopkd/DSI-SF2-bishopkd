I thought Id wake up and Id know who I was and what happened, but I dont know any more now than I did last night.The sobs were painful to watch.Lucas grabbed a handful of napkins and handed them to her.She was either the greatest actress on the face of the earth or she was telling the truth.She cried so hard he got worried about her, about the baby.He pulled up a chair next to her and awkwardly patted her back.Dont cry, he said.Well sort this out, but youve got to stop crying.It cant be good for the baby.That seemed to penetrate into her head, because the sobs wore down to sniffles, and finally ceased altogether.She wiped her cheeks, and when she looked at him once again, there was desperation in her eyes.Im so afraid, she said.I dont know whats going to happen to me.For now, nothing is going to happen, Lucas replied.Youre safe here.Loretta told me to tell you that youre welcome to stay for a couple of days until you feel better.Tears welled up in her eyes once again.I cant believe how kind youre being to me.He wanted to tell her that it wasnt him, that his sister was the kind one.He was the cynical one who still didnt know whether to believe her or not.But for the moment he decided to give her the benefit of the doubt.If she was lying, then sooner or later he would know.If she was telling the truth, then he sure as hell didnt want to be responsible for tossing a pregnant woman out on the streets all alone with no money and no memory.Are you hungry?he asked.Starving.I cant remember the last time I ate.A half hysterical spurt of laughter burst out of her.Scrambled eggs okay?he asked as he got up from the table.Fine.But please, you dont have to wait on me.If youll just show me where things are, I can do for myself.She started to get up, but he waved her back down.Ill take care of it, just sit tight.He got the eggs from the refrigerator and set to work making breakfast.As he worked she stared out the window, tiny frown lines dancing across her forehead.Again he was struck by her prettiness.She wasnt screamingly drop dead gorgeous, but rather she had a quiet, simmering beauty.He frowned and whipped the eggs more forcefully than necessary.The last thing he needed was to be attracted to her.She obviously had a man in her life.And in any case Lucas didnt do relationships.She continued to stare out the window as if lost in thought while he fixed the eggs and popped in toast.Then once it was all done he placed the food on two plates, one for her and one for himself.Lucas?She turned to look at him, her blue eyes troubled.I know this sounds crazy, but I have a terrible feeling that Im in real danger.He set the plates on the table with a sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach.This was growing more complicated by the minute.And there was nothing Lucas hated more than complication.JANE STARED AT HIM and tried not to notice that his dark hair had a gleaming shine to it that made it look silky soft and that he smelled like soap and shaving cream and a hint of a clean cologne.You dont believe me, do you?Since the moment shed told him that she didnt know who she was, that she had no idea what had happened to her, shed sensed his suspicious disbelief.And she wasnt sure why it was so important to her that he accept what she was telling him.I dont know what I believe, he finally replied.I think its possible you had a fight with your boyfriend or husband or whatever, and you need a safe place to hide out until things cool off and the two of you can kiss and make up.She reached up and touched her forehead with a frown.I cant imagine wanting to kiss and make up with anyone who did this to me.He picked up his fork.Hell buy you flowers or candy and swear hell never touch you again and youll end up going back and things will be great until the next time he loses his temper.His voice held a harshness in tone.I wouldnt be involved with a man like that, she exclaimed.He raised a dark eyebrow.How do you know?She felt the warmth of a blush on her cheeks.I might not know who I am, but I know what Id tolerate, and Id never stay with a man who put his hands on me.She felt a swell of tears burning at her eyes and bit them back.Shed cried herself to sleep the night before and had awakened and cried some more.She was tired of crying.Maybe nobody hit me.Maybe I just fell and hit my head on something, she said.I dont think so, he replied.Do you have bruised knees?Scraped up palms?Anything that might indicate youd fallen?No.That scrape on your head doesnt look like its the result of a fall.It looks like you were hit with something.He leaned forward and she realized his dark eyes had tiny shards of silver in them.You know, if youre just scared and need a place to hang out for a couple of days, its all right to tell me.You dont have to make up any stories.Im not making anything up.I dont know what to do to make you believe me.I dont know what to say to make you understand that Im not lying.Those dark eyes of his studied her intently.Eat your eggs and toast before they get cold.They ate for a few minutes without speaking, until she couldnt stand the tense silence another minute longer.Your sister seems really nice, she said.He nodded.Shes a sucker for people in need.And youre not?The corners of his lips turned up in a humorless smile.Im not a sucker for anyone or anything.I know your sister is a nurse, but Im not sure exactly what it is you do.I own a company, Recovery Inc., with two of my friends.We were all Navy SEALs together, and when we got out of the service we opened the business.And you repossess cars?He frowned, as if the question irritated him.Last night was not our normal kind of job.I did that as a favor for the owner of the car dealership.So, what is your normal kind of job?she asked.It was a welcome relief to be wondering about him instead of wondering about herself.We recover items and return them to the people they belong to.But its really not important what I do.Whats important is what were going to do about you.I should probably go.Im really not your problem.She tried to ignore the terror that coursed through her at the thought of having to leave, of not knowing where she would go.If I let you leave under these conditions, Loretta will have my head, he replied.He stood and grabbed their plates from the table and carried them to the sink.Our first order of business today is to get you a few things from the store.You need a change of clothing and some personal items if youre going to stay here for a couple of days.She felt terrible.She didnt want to take advantage of either Loretta or Lucas.But no matter how much she wanted to claim back her own life, she didnt know where to begin.I cant believe this, she said more to herself than to him.Once again she directed her gaze out the window where the sun hid beneath a blanket of low gray clouds.She felt as if the sun was her memory, hiding someplace inside her and refusing to come out into the light.She looked at him once again and cradled her stomach with her arms.If it were just me, Id leave.Id never take advantage of your kindness.He leaned against the counter, those dark eyes of his impossible to read.Ill go to my place and get you a T shirt and a jacket, and well head to Wal Mart to pick up what you need.Whatever you buy for me, Ill pay you back.I swear I will just as soon as I figure out who I am and where I belong.She frowned and tried to ignore the headache that had begun to pound across the top of her head.Maybe as the day wears on, something will jiggle my memory.She couldnt imagine going day after day with no memories, with no knowledge of something as simple as her own name.Maybe, he replied.He shoved off from the counter.Ill just get that shirt and jacket.Ill be right back.As he left the kitchen she leaned back in her chair and drew a deep breath.She raised a hand and touched the scab that had formed on her forehead.What had happened to her?Why couldnt she remember?What if a couple of days passed and she still didnt know who she was, or where she belonged?What then?She couldnt just continue to stay here forever.She could take advantage of Lorettas kindness only so long.She dropped her hand to her belly and rubbed with a caressing motion.She thought the baby was a boy.Of course she didnt remember anyone telling her that, had no concrete memory, it was just something she knew.Like she knew that she hated peanut butter and loved pizza.Lucas returned with the large T shirt and a down filled navy ski jacket.She took the shirt and returned to the bedroom where shed slept to put it on.Her bloodstained blouse was probably ruined.She couldnt imagine any laundry detergent that would be able to wash away all traces of the blood.Lucass T shirt hung across her slender shoulders and pulled slightly across her belly, but wearing the clean cotton material that smelled faintly of fabric softener made her feel better.She left the bedroom and found Lucas waiting for her on the sofa.He stood as she entered the room, his gaze sliding from the top of her head down to her belly.Self consciously she placed a hand on her stomach.Your shirt isnt exactly made for two, she said.I hope I dont stretch it too much.Im not worried about it, he replied, and held out the coat to help her into it.It easily wrapped around her and along with its warmth brought that scent of him, that pleasant fragrance of clean cologne and male.She found it oddly comforting.Ready?he asked.She nodded and together they left Lorettas apartment and walked out into the hallway.Am I keeping you from a wife or a girlfriend?she asked as they passed his apartment door.No, you arent keeping me from anything or anyone, he replied.What about your job?Shouldnt you be at work?He flashed her a quick smile.It was the first smile shed seen from him and it shot a flutter of warmth through her.One of the perks of owning the company is getting to pick and choose when you decide to work.She nodded and fell silent as they walked out into the brisk November air and headed for his car.What kind of a woman was she to be carrying somebody elses baby and feel that burst of heat at the smile of a virtual stranger?There had been a moment when his gaze had drifted over her that shed wished her tummy was thin and shapely, that theyd met in the grocery store or at a restaurant and were together because of a mutual attraction.Maybe she hadnt just lost her memory, maybe shed lost her entire mind, she thought as she slid into his passenger seat.Stress.It had to be stress that had her thinking such crazy thoughts.The only thing she knew she could count on, at least for the moment, was Lucas and his sister.Was it any wonder she would be attracted to him?If you dont recover your memory sometime today, then tomorrow Ill make some discreet inquiries about missing persons reports that have been filed in the last day or so, Lucas said as he started the car.Surely somebody you know will get worried and report you missing.Unless nobody cares that Im missing, she replied.He shot her a quick look.I would find that hard to believe.She released a wry laugh.I find this entire situation hard to believe.Lets play a little game.Ill ask you some questions and you give me the first answer that pops into your head.Okay, she agreed as he pulled out of the apartment parking lot.Whats your favorite television show?The Closer, she replied without any real thought.He nodded.Good.And what was the last movie you went to see?I dont go to the movie theater very often.She tried not to think about the tiny nuggets of information the answers revealed about herself, afraid that the nuggets would stop coming.Whats your favorite restaurant here in the city?Thats easy, Caf Italian on Maple Street.A buzz of excitement went off inside her.Maybe theyll know me in there.Maybe they can tell us who I am.I know the place.It isnt far from where I found you last night in the car.Maybe well go there for lunch and see what we can find out.Janes excitement grew.It was possible that by lunchtime shed know who she was; shed at least know her name.Surely that would make it easier for her to find out what had happened to her.Its a place to start, he said, invading her thoughts.He pulled into the Wal Mart parking lot and found a space near the front door.At this time of the morning the store didnt look too busy.They got out of the car and had taken only a couple of steps toward the door when a voice inside her head thundered.Dont let them find you.The words seemed to come from some separate entity inside her brain and they screamed with an alarm that froze her in her tracks.Instinctively she reached out and grabbed Lucass hand as fear charged through her.He curled his fingers with hers as he looked at her with concern.Are you all right?he asked.Is it the baby?Two thoughts raced through her mind.The first was that she liked the way his big, strong hand felt around hers, and the second was that the voice shed thought shed heard in her head had probably been nothing more than a response to the drama of her situation.She suddenly felt foolish.She unfurled her fingers from his and gave a small laugh.No, its not the baby.I guess I just had a case of nerves.He dropped his hand to his side and studied her intently.Theres nothing to be nervous about.The only thing you have to worry about is being overwhelmed by all the choices.She forced a smile.That never happens with women, she said.Once again they began to walk to the door.Surely the words that had thundered in her head meant nothing, she told herself.But what worried her was they hadnt sounded like nothing.They had sounded like a warningbut a warning of what?Pregnesia Chapter ThreeOnce again Lucas found himself doubting the veracity of her amnesia story.Something had happened in the parking lot.He thought she might have thought of something or remembered something that she apparently didnt want to tell him.She didnt trust him.How could he help her if she didnt trust him?Lucas pushed the cart with one hand, took Jane by her elbow and guided her down an aisle.When hed seen her in his T shirt hed realized how tiny she was despite her pregnancy.The baby weight was all up front like a ball in her belly, but everywhere else she was slender.If youll just get me a blouse and a toothbrush, that should be enough, she said as they walked through the linen section toward the back of the store.Lucas didnt know a lot about women, but there was no way he believed she could make do for a day or two with just a new blouse and the jeans she had on.When they reached the maternity clothes, she headed directly to a clearance rack.Apparently she meant to spend as little of his money as possible.As she thumbed through the discounted items, he spied a blue cotton long sleeved blouse exactly the color of her eyes and plucked it from the rack.He threw it into the basket, then added an oversized blue and white sweater.Although she hadnt mentioned it, she probably needed some underwear, too.He certainly didnt want to completely outfit a woman who might return to a husband or a boyfriend before nightfall.She had a life somewhere, with clothes and shoes and everything else necessary.Still, he didnt want her to do without the bare necessities while she was with him for a day or two.She returned to where he stood with the cart, carrying an ugly gray T shirt that had probably been the cheapest on the rack.I dont think so, he said.She looked at him in surprise.If Im going to be looking at you for the next day or two, I dont want you wearing something ugly.But its only five dollars, she protested.Theres a reason its so cheap.He took it from her and hung it on a nearby rack.What about that pink shirt there?He pointed to a pastel T shirt that said Baby on Board.With another pair of slacks, you should be all right with the other things I grabbed, he said.He averted his gaze from her.Then well head to the underclothes department and you can get what you need.She grabbed him by the arm and when he looked at her, those beautiful blue eyes of hers were once again misty with tears.I can only hope that the father of this baby is half the man you are, Lucas.Dont make me into some kind of a hero, he replied with a definite edge in his voice.Im just doing what anyone would do under the circumstances.As they left the maternity section and headed to the undergarments department, he wanted to tell her that he was the last person she should look at with such soft, appealing eyes, with that hint of hero worship that made him feel too warm inside his own skin.As she picked out a package of panties, he stood at the end of the aisle and waited for her.An old woman stood at the other end of the aisle and appeared to be looking at Jane.When she saw Lucas she offered a sweet smile, then moved on to another aisle.Jane returned to the cart and threw in her choices.Her cheeks were slightly pink as she looked at him.I hope Im a wealthy woman because Im going to owe you a bunch of money.Dont be silly, he replied.He pointed to the nightgowns.You need to pick out one of those, he said.Oh no, thats all right.Loretta gave me one to wear, she replied.Lucas frowned, remembering when shed stepped into the kitchen in his sisters nightgown.That one cant be comfortable.I saw how it pulled across your stomach.Just pick out one that will fit you comfortably.As she moved to the rack to look at the items, he tried to forget that vision of her.That nightgown of Lorettas hadnt just pulled taut across her belly, but across her breasts, as well.Her hair had been all tousled and shed looked achingly soft and feminine.For just an instant as hed held that coffee cup frozen halfway to his mouth, hed wondered what it would be like to wake up with a woman like Jane next to him.When half asleep, would he rub the swell of her belly and dream of the future of the baby she carried?Jeez, what was wrong with him?Hed never thought about babies before.The last thing hed ever wanted to be was a husband and a father.He simply wasnt cut out for either role.Jane felt just a little dangerous to him.She made him think of things hed never thought of before.She picked a pale pink nightgown and added it to the growing number of items in the shopping cart.He then pointed the cart in the direction of the toiletries section.She walked beside him and paused a moment to rub her lower back.Sorry, she said, and smiled.Junior must be stretched out right along my spine.Her smile torched a wave of heat through him.It was the first true smile hed seen from her and it did amazing things to her already lovely face.Even the scab across her forehead couldnt detract from her attractiveness.Suddenly, he was irritated.All he wanted to do was solve the mystery of his Ms.Jane Doe and get her on her way and out of his life.He noticed the old woman whod been in the underwear section now at the end of the aisle where Jane stood in front of the hair care items.Once again when she saw him looking at her she smiled.She dug a cell phone out of her purse and then disappeared around the corner.It was easier focusing on a little white haired woman than watching Jane.Hed been too long without a woman.That was the problem.It had been months since hed been out with anyone.His last date had been with a friend of his partner Troys girlfriend, Bree.Miranda had flown in from California for a weekend visit and Lucas had taken her out.Shed been perfect for him, very hot and very temporary.He frowned in irritation as he realized Jane got to him in a way Miranda hadnt.There was a softness about Jane, a sweetness in her smile, a fragile light in her eyes that pulled up a protectiveness in him hed never felt for anyone except his sister.I think thats everything I should need.Jane pulled him from his thoughts as she added a hairbrush, a toothbrush and a bottle of citrus scented shampoo to the cart.Then lets get out of here, Lucas said.He blew a sigh of relief as they headed for the cashier lines.Maybe if he took her to Caf Italian for an early lunch, somebody at the restaurant would recognize her and the mystery would be solved.They fell into line behind a woman who looked as if shed bought half the store.Jane covered his hand with hers on the handle of the cart.Her hand was warm on his skin as she looked up at him.I cant thank you enough, she said.I couldnt face wearing that bloody blouse all day today.Well run back to Lorettas so you can change clothes, then head to the restaurant to see if anybody there knows your name.He breathed a sigh of relief as she pulled her hand from his.Even if somebody just knows my first name, surely hearing that will remind me of who I am.He heard the thrum of desperation in her voice.It must be horrifying not to know even the most simple thing about yourselfyour name.Until this moment he hadnt really realized that if she was telling the truth about her amnesia, then she must be absolutely terrified.All hed been thinking about was getting her gone as soon as possible, but he didnt want her to go unless she had her memory back.Finally it was their turn to be checked out.As Lucas placed the items on the counter he noticed that Jane winced and rubbed her lower back.You want to go ahead to the car?he asked.Maybe if she got off her feet her back would feel better.Are you sure you wouldnt mind?He held out the keys as the cashier told him his total.Go on, Ill be out in two minutes.She smiled gratefully and took the keys from him as he pulled out his wallet to pay the cashier.As she headed toward the exit, he put the bags of his purchases back in the cart.As he pushed out of the exit door, he saw a van pull up.The back doors opened and two men began grappling with Jane, obviously trying to get her into the back of the van.Hey!he yelled.His heart smashed into his ribs as he abandoned the cart and took off running toward them.At that moment Jane released a scream that raised the hairs on the back of his neck and drew the attention of everyone in the parking lot.Another shopper, a burly man, began to run toward the van, as well.Jane screamed again as she struggled to get free.The two men suddenly released her and jumped into the back of the van, which took off with a squeal of tires.The burly man and Lucas reached Jane at the same time.She launched herself at Lucas, wrapping her arms around his neck and hanging on tight.Are you all right?he asked urgently.Did they hurt you?She shook her head and buried her face against his chest.Despite the fact that she wore his big, down filled coat, he could feel the trembling of her body against him.The big man looked at Lucas and pulled a cell phone from his pocket.Want me to call 911?No!Jane lifted her head and looked first at the man, then at Lucas.No, please.Lets just go home.But thank you for your help.The man shrugged and put his cell phone back in his pocket, then headed toward the store entrance.Another shopper, a young woman, pushed Lucass cart to where he and Jane stood.You arent safe anywhere these days, she said with a worried frown on her face.With Jane still clinging to him, Lucas pushed the basket to the side of his car.She pulled his keys from her pocket, unlocked the door and helped her into the passenger side.He threw the bags into the backseat, then walked around to the driver door.It had all happened so damn fast.He hadnt even gotten a license plate number on the van.All hed seen was a small symbol of some kind on the back window.There was no way he believed that this had just been a random act of violence.Those men had been after her.As he slid in behind the steering wheel he turned to look at her.His heart still beat a rapid tattoo of alarm.If you have any memories in your head, if youre holding anything back, youd better spill it now, he said as he stabbed the key into the ignition.Otherwise wed better figure out who you are and why in the hell those men just tried to kidnap you.Jane stared at him as the yawning horror of what had just happened filled her with an icy chill of terror.When the van had pulled up in front of her, shed thought nothing about it.Then the back doors had swung open and the two men had rushed her.I swear I dont know anything.I dont know who those men were or what they wanted with me.Her heart still beat with the frantic rhythm of fear.A knot of tension throbbed in Lucass lean jaw as he pulled out of the parking lot and onto the road.She continued to look at him, needing the mere sight of him to ground her, to somehow chase away the panic that still clawed at her insides.I dont suppose you recognized those men?he asked.She shook her head.I dont think Ive ever seen them before.Did they say anything to you?No, not a word.
