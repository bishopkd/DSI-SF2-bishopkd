Im going to go take a quick shower.Ill be back in a few minutes.If you dont mind, Ill go ahead and set the table.Mind?Knock yourself out, Loretta exclaimed, and then left the kitchen.Jane found the appropriate plates and silverware and got the table prepared for the meal.She made a salad, opened a can of corn and got it warming on the stove top by the time Loretta had returned, now dressed in a pair of sweats and a T shirt.Now, tell me about your day, she said as she put a kettle of water on the stove to boil for tea.Jane told her about their trip to the store and the kidnapping attempt.As she related the story, that familiar cold fear seeped into her bones.Oh my God, Loretta exclaimed when she was finished.You poor thing.Even that didnt jiggle loose any memories, but Lucas said he was going to have his partners do some research and see if they could find out what the symbol means.If youre in some kind of trouble, Lucas, Troy and Micah are the men to help you out.If there are answers to be found, theyll find them.A half hour later as they ate, Loretta told Jane about Lucass partners and the business that they owned.But what Jane wanted most of all was to learn more about Lucas.Your brother told me that when you two were growing up it was you and him against the world.You had a tough childhood?she asked.Loretta frowned thoughtfully.Not so much me, but things were tough on Lucas.My father had anger issues and most of his rage was always directed at my brother.She shrugged.He got through it.We both did.But it made us unusually close.Lucas was my hero when I was growing up, and throughout the years thats never changed.It must be nice to have somebody like that in your life, Jane said.Somebody who will always be there for you, somebody you can depend on.A wistfulness filled her and again she couldnt help but wonder if shed been looking for somebody like that in her life or if shed already found him and just couldnt remember who he was.Yeah, the only thing nicer than having a brother like that would be having a husband like that, Loretta said with a laugh.But there will be time for romance once Im finished with medical school.The rest of the meal they chatted about Lorettas desire to become a doctor and speculated on what Jane might do as a career.It didnt take long for them to get silly.Loretta thought Jane might be a Hollywood actress who had escaped the prying eyes of the paparazzi to have her baby in private.Of course the babys father was a high profile rock star who loved her to distraction, but was afraid marriage would hurt his image.Jane offered the scenario that shed been abducted by a space alien and impregnated and theyd erased her memories so she wouldnt bring back secrets of their planet.The laughter felt wonderful and they were still giggling like high school best friends when Lucas walked in.Instantly, Jane felt as if the kitchen shrank in size as he filled it with his dark energy, his bigger than life presence.Sounds like you two are having fun, he said as he grabbed a plate from the cabinet and sat at the table.We were just speculating on Janes life, Loretta explained, her eyes still sparkling with merriment.Weve decided shes either a spy or a hooker going incognito.Jane laughed again.Your sister is a hoot.Lucas filled his plate from the food still on the table.Yeah, shes a regular comedian.What have you been doing?Loretta asked.I had to go try on a tux for the wedding.Then I stopped at the office to catch up on things, he replied.Wedding?Jane asked.My partner Micah is getting married in less than a month.Im his best man.Good meat loaf, he said.You can thank Jane for dinner.She surprised me by fixing it.I told her if she cooks like this every night I might decide to keep her, Loretta said.You might have to keep her, at least for another day or two.He grabbed a piece of bread to add to his plate.I talked to Kincaid at the police station.Thereve been no reports of missing women filed in the past forty eight hours.Jane stared at him in dismay.Shed somehow hoped that a missing persons report would fill in some of the pieces.She wasnt sure what bothered her more, the fact that strange men had tried to shove her into the back of a van or that apparently there was nobody in her life who had missed her over the past twenty four hours.Pregnesia Chapter FiveThe crushed look on Janes face touched a chord in Lucass heart.Maybe its too early for anyone to have reported you missing, he said.If you went missing not too many hours before I found you, then its only been twenty four hours now.Maybe tomorrow somebody will file a report.Maybe, she agreed.Or maybe there was nobody in my life to file a report, nobody who misses me.I cant imagine that, Loretta said gently.What must it be like to be missing from your life and believe that nobody cares?Lucas couldnt help but feel a chord of sympathy for her despite his desire to the contrary.He listened and ate while the two women talked about babies and fashion, acting as if theyd known each other forever.The first time he heard Jane laugh, the sound shot a burst of warmth through him.She had a great, full bodied laugh.Who had she been before all this?Had she laughed often?Loved passionately?Did she like old movies or New Age music?Did she like quiet, intimate dinners or prefer the club scene?He frowned, irritated that he was even speculating on who she really was.As Loretta got up to begin clearing the table, Jane rose, as well.But Loretta waved her back down.No way.You cooked, so I do the cleanup.Just sit and relax.Jane sat back down.Shed only been sitting a minute when a smile lit her face and she placed her hands on her tummy.Junior is doing a happy dance.She smiled at Lucas.Quick, give me your hand.Without conscious thought he leaned forward and placed his hand on her belly.Immediately he felt the undulating movement of life.A sense of awe filled him as he felt a flutter, then a sharper protrusion of an elbow or a foot.A baby, a little human lifeamazing, he thought.He jerked his hand away and sat back in his chair.He didnt want to think about babies or beautiful blondes who had smiles filled with sunshine.He refused to get emotionally caught up with the unborn baby and Jane, who would eventually remember her life and return to it.Ive got to get home, he said, and stood, needing to escape the warmth of Janes smile and the concern that she was all alone in the world, had somehow been all alone in the world even before she lost her memories.Tomorrow I want to take you to the office to meet with my partners.Micah is working to get us some information about that symbol and on the way well take a ride by the place where I found you.Maybe something will break loose in your head if we go back to that area.What time should I be ready?Jane asked him.Lets say around nine?He walked over to his sister and kissed her on the cheek.Ill see you later, he said.He breathed a sigh of relief as he escaped the apartment and headed down the hallway to his own.He had no idea what it was about his Jane Doe that affected him so strongly.Even throughout the last couple of hours when he hadnt been with her, his thoughts kept returning to her.What if the baby came?Who was going to take care of her and the newborn if she didnt have her memory back?Dammit, he didnt want to feel responsible for her, and yet he did.And if he were completely honest with himself he would admit that despite the fact that she was pregnant, he was attracted to her.Never in a million years had he thought hed find a pregnant woman sexy, but he found Jane extremely sexy.He entered his apartment and checked his machine.No new messages.He hadnt expected any.His partners knew to get him on his cell phone and there wasnt anyone else who would want to call him.He sat on the sofa and for a moment the silence closed in around him.The sound of Janes laughter had found a place inside him that whispered of a loneliness he hadnt realized was there.Her warm laughter had momentarily chased it away.What he needed was for her to wake up tomorrow and not only remember her name, but also have a family to support her, perhaps a husband who loved her.What he really needed was a good nights sleep without thoughts of Jane intruding in his head.He grabbed a beer from the fridge and returned to the sofa, where he punched the remote to turn on the television.As the screen filled with a sitcom he didnt recognize, he popped the top on the beer and took a deep swallow.Generally, Lucas wasnt a television kind of guy, but tonight he needed something to keep his mind off a pregnant blonde with warm blue eyes.He focused on the sitcom and by nine had finished his beer and decided to call it a night.The next morning brought more of the same.The news didnt broadcast a missing pregnant woman report, and the moment Jane opened Lorettas door to his knock, he knew that she still didnt remember anything.Sleep well?he asked.Actually, I slept like a baby, she replied.She didnt look like a baby.The T shirt she wore that pronounced Baby on Board pulled across the fullness of her breasts, and the maternity jeans theyd bought fit snug on her long, lean legs.He could smell her, the clean scent of citrus shampoo and a fragrant soap.Every muscle in his body tensed.You ready to leave?he asked, his tone sharper than hed intended.Just let me get a coat.She disappeared down the hallway.She returned wearing the coat hed loaned her the day before and together they left the apartment building.A cold wind blew from the north as they hurried to his car in the lot.Whats the plan?she asked once they were in the car and hed started the engine.First were going to take a ride around the area where I found you to see if that jiggles your memory, he said.Then well head over to the office and see what Micah and Troy have found out about that symbol.Ive disrupted your life.You must be sick of me already.He turned to look at her, realizing that his sharp tone with her earlier hadnt gone unnoticed.Dont worry about it.I didnt have much of a life for you to disrupt.He backed out of the parking space, surprised that his own words swept that whisper of loneliness through him once again.What was the matter with him?He clenched the steering wheel more tightly, irritated by the wayward direction of his thoughts.Where exactly are we?she asked as he pulled out on the street.I mean, I know were in Kansas City, but nothing looks familiar.Downtown is south of us.Were at the northern edges of the city, he replied.The area where I found you is called Oak Grove Estates, upper middle class homes and a nice neighborhood.Ring a bell?No.She frowned and stared out the window.But I remember running and running before I got into that car to rest.Maybe well go by a house or a landmark that you recognize, he said.He wasnt sure what else to do.Somehow they needed to stimulate her mind to remember what had happened to her, and it wasnt happening in the safety of Lorettas apartment.Maybe, she agreed, and fell silent.It didnt take long for them to reach Oak Grove.Lucas drove slowly down the street where two nights before hed repossessed the car and held his breath for an aha moment from her.But it didnt come.She stared out the window with desperation shining from her eyes.Thinking about the fact that shed said she remembered running, he worked outward from the house where hed found her, driving down street after street in the general area.Its no good, she finally said.Nothing looks familiar.Her voice held a wealth of disappointment.She released a weary sigh.Im beginning to think Ill never remember who I am or what happened.You cant give up, he replied.Its just going to take some time, Jane.We have to be patient.I have to be patient, but you dont have to be, she replied.She looked at him.Maybe it would be best if you did just drop me off at a motel, front me some money and let me figure this out on my own.You dont owe me anything.Im not your problem.Im just a stranger you happened to stumble on by accident.It would be easy to do as she suggested, just pull into the parking lot of the nearest motel, pay for a week or two of lodging and drop her off and forget her.But he knew he wouldnt forget anything.Shed haunt him forever.Hed worry about what had happened to her, to her baby.Hed wonder where she was and how she fared.Nope, that simply wasnt an option right now.He shot her a quick glance and then returned his gaze back to the road.Dont be silly.Im not about to drop you off someplace and just drive away and let you figure this out on your own.He thought he heard a little sigh of relief from her.Dont worry about me, Jane, he continued.Sooner or later well find out who you are and whats happened to you.Until that happens, Im here for you.I have no intention of walking away.He glanced at her again, just in time to see her offer him one of those amazing smiles of hers.As he focused back on his driving, he had a feeling he was already in too deep where Jane was concerned.THE RECOVERY INC.OFFICE was nicely decorated with two large desks and a waiting area with a leather sofa and matching chair.As Jane and Lucas entered, she beelined for the sofa and sank down to ease her aching back.It seemed as if her babys favorite position was sitting on her spine.Her lower back hurt most of the time.Troy and Micah should be here any minute, Lucas said as he walked over to the phone and punched the button to check the messages.There was only onea man calling about a missing cigar boat that he suspected had been stolen by his exson in law.He left a phone number with an area code Jane didnt recognize.She felt ridiculously nervous about meeting his partners.It was as if she were Lucass girlfriend and desperately wanted to make a good impression on his family.Of course, that was ridiculous.She was nothing more than a burden to him and it didnt matter whether his partners liked her or not.You want something to drink?he asked.No, Im fine, she replied.At that moment the front door opened and a tall, good looking man entered.Lucas introduced Jane to Micah Stone.He smiled and shook her hand warmly, then gestured her back down on the sofa.Lucas has told me a little about whats going on, he said as he shrugged out of his coat and hung it on the coat tree next to theirs.I did some research on that symbol and have some things for you both to look at.He pulled several folded sheets of paper from his pocket.As he sat on one side of her, Lucas sat on the other.She was flanked on either side by enough lean muscle and testosterone to feel as if the world could come to an end and somehow shed survive.The all seeing eye has quite a place in history, he said.Generally it is a symbol of the protective power of a Supreme Being, Micah said.In Mexican culture its been used as a talisman against evil.Its origin can be traced back to Egyptian mythology and the Eye of Horus.He opened up one of the sheets of paper and handed it to Lucas.Did it look like this?Jane caught a glimpse of the picture and quickly closed her eyes.She didnt want to see it again, didnt understand what that symbol had to do with her and why it evoked such fear in her heart.Not exactly, Lucas replied.It wasnt a pyramid.It wasnt like whats on the dollar bill, it was just a triangle.Micah handed him another sheet of paper.Thats it, he said.Jane looked at Micah.What is it?It took me a while to find anything locally, but I finally found a church that uses the symbol kind of like their logo.A church?Jane frowned.What on earth could a church have to do with her current situation?The Church of Enlightenment, to be exact, Micah said.And what did you find out about this church?Lucas asked.Big church with a healthy, multidenominational congregation.The church owns about a hundred acres of land north of here.Its open to the public, but they have a small compound there thats a gated community of sorts.A gated community.That sounds rather odd, Lucas said with a frown.The church itself seems a bit odd, Micah said.I didnt have time to do a lot of research.But from what information I was able to gather, the church is headed by a man known only as The Prophet, who gives the sermon each Sunday and remains a sort of mysterious father figure.Can you say cult?Lucas said drily.I dont know about that, Micah replied.Id have to have a lot more information than what I have to make that kind of call.Just because we saw that symbol on the back of the van door doesnt mean the people who tried to grab me at the store are in any way related to this church, Jane said.Thats true, Lucas said, his frustration obvious in his voice.But you react strongly to that seeing eye and theres got to be a reason for it.Maybe I was as scared as a baby by a big hairy eyeball, she offered with a touch of humor.Lucas laughed and shook his head.Im glad somebody still has a sense of humor about all this.You didnt notice anything else about the van?Micah asked.Lucas shook his head with a grim expression.It was just a plain white panel van.Everything happened so fast.His frown deepened, as if irritated with himself for not doing more, for not seeing more.At that moment the front door whooshed open and the third partner of the business walked in.Lucas introduced her to Troy Sinclair and for the next few minutes the three men talked about Recovery Inc.business.As they talked she found herself watching them with interest.Loretta had told her that the three men had been best buddies when theyd all been Navy SEALs and that their close relationship had continued into civilian life.Their friendship showed in the easy way they spoke to each other, in the way they could almost finish each others thoughts.There was respect there, as well as the warmth of men who cared about each other.Did she have a friend someplace?A girlfriend who shed met for lunch or gone shopping with?A woman who had known her secrets and who had shared her laughter and her tears?Where was that friend now?Was she worried about Jane?It was going on forty eight hours that Jane had been missing from her life.Didnt anyone care?A wave of despair rushed through her.It was only when she heard her name that she focused on the three men once again.I checked with Wendall.There have been no missing persons reports in the last twenty four hours that match Jane, Lucas told his partners.I plan on checking in with him again tomorrow morning.He didnt ask why you wanted to know?Micah asked with a lift of one dark eyebrow.He asked.I didnt tell him, Lucas replied.Jane has a feeling that in going to any authorities she could be putting herself in more danger than shes already in.All three men turned to look at her and she felt the heat of a blush in her cheeks.I cant explain it, she said.I know it sounds irrational, but the idea of going to the police terrifies me.With what happened yesterday at the store, Im willing to give it some time before going to the police, but Ive told Jane if she doesnt recover her memories soon, eventually we might not have any other choice than to go to the authorities, Lucas said.Even though Jane knew he was right, a shiver of dread worked through her at the thought.Why was she afraid of the police?Was she some kind of criminal?She couldnt imagine that being the case.As shed told Lucas when theyd first met, she might not know who she was, but she knew what she was.Shed bet her life shed never been in trouble with the law in her life.It was almost noon when they finally left the Recovery Inc.offices.The November air had chilled while theyd been inside and there was a faint scent of impending snow.Thanksgiving was two weeks away.Would she be home by then?Would she be having turkey and stuffing surrounded by friends and loved ones, or would she still be struggling to figure out who she was and where she belonged?Minutes later she and Lucas were back in his car and headed to Lorettas.Ill drop you off at the apartment.Then Ill be back around dinnertime, Lucas said.She didnt ask where he might be going or what he was going to do.She knew there was nothing more they could do to get her memory back.At the moment it seemed as if all she needed was some time.But how much time would it take before Lucas was sick of her and her problems?It was a silent drive back to Lorettas.Youve gotten quiet, Lucas said as he turned the key in Lorettas door.I was just thinking about Thanksgiving and wondering if Id be home by then.She leaned against the wall in the hallway.Do you and Loretta have a big feast that day?Actually, we do.Its the one holiday that Loretta never works.She does the turkey and stuffing and makes sweet potatoes and pies and we invite some friends over.He took a step closer to her and raised a hand and touched her cheek.Ill do everything in my power to make sure that youre home for Thanksgiving, he said softly.His warm fingers lingered on her cheek and Janes breath caught in her chest.There was a look in his eyes that made her think he was going to kiss her and she was stunned by how much she wanted him to.She raised a hand to capture his, not wanting him to draw away from her, but rather wanting him to fall into her, to wrap her in his arms and pull her as close as he possibly could.She closed her eyes as he came closer, his mouth mere inches from hers.She leaned forward, wantingneeding the contact with him.And then his mouth touched hers.Hot and tender, his soft lips plied hers in a kiss that didnt just warm her mouth, but sizzled a wave of warmth through her entire body.It wasnt until he pulled her closer and her tummy bumped into him that he jerked back from her.Sorry.That was inexcusable.He drew a deep breath as if to steady himself.She took hold of his arm.I can excuse it, she said.In fact, if you wanted to do it again, I wouldnt have any problems excusing you.She couldnt believe her forwardness, but it wasnt just gratitude she felt for him, it was a white hot attraction that had her half giddy.She was afraid she might have offended him, but he gave her a sexy half grin that only increased his appeal.That was very nice, but we cant lose sight of the fact that theres probably a man in your life.His gaze shot pointedly down to her stomach.I dont think so, she said.I cant explain it, Lucas, but I think I was alone before all this began.He sighed and tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear, then opened the door to Lorettas apartment.Get some rest, he said.Ill see you later this evening.He turned and nearly ran down the hall away from her.How foolish was she?A pregnant woman with no memory making passes at a hot guy whod already said he had no interest in getting married or becoming a father.How foolish was she to think that hed even want to kiss her again.With a new depression settling over her shoulders she turned and went into the apartment.Pregnesia Chapter SixThe kiss had been a major mistake.The taste of her sweet, lush lips haunted Lucas for the remainder of the day.Hed left Lorettas apartment, gone straight back to his car and headed out to the Church of Enlightenment compound.He had no idea if it had been somebody from the church who had tried to grab Jane at the store, but the fact that the church used the seeing eye symbol as a kind of trademark was the only lead they had.The Church of Enlightenment was located at the very northern edges of Kansas City, about ten miles from the neighborhood where Lucas had found Jane in the car.It seemed unlikely that Jane would have been able to walk ten miles in her condition that night, but he wasnt willing to rule out the possibility altogether.There were stories in the news all the time about people accomplishing all kinds of impossible feats when in danger.The church itself was a huge building with amazing stained glass windows and a sign across the door that welcomed all who came for spiritual nourishment.He didnt bother going inside; in fact, didnt even leave his car.What interested him more than the church itself were the buildings in a gated area behind it.There was a massive three story home, several other low, flat buildings, a construction site with a foundation poured and fields as far as the eye could see.All of it was surrounded by tall, sturdy fencing designed to keep people out.There was no question that religion could be big business, but this particular church didnt seem to be affiliated with any others or have an organized base.He made a mental note to ask Micah to see if he could find a list of the board of directors or whatever governed the money obviously flowing into this church.He pulled up to the gate, but there was no guard on duty and the heavy iron fencing was locked.Surely this couldnt have anything to do with Jane, he thought.Even if he were able to get a list of names of all the people in the congregation, there was no way he could pinpoint who had been responsible for the attack at the store.It just didnt make sense.Maybe the sign hed seen in the back of that van had nothing to do with this church.He just couldnt make the pieces fit.He left the church and went back to the Recovery Inc.office where Troy was inside working on the financial records for the company.The two men talked about Jane and both agreed that time was what she needed most of all.Eventually something would trigger her memories, and in the meantime there wasnt much any of them could do.While Lucas would love to know who had tried to grab her and why, the odds of figuring it out were not in his favor.It was nearly four when Lucas left the office.
