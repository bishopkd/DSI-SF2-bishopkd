Yet again her life has been turned completely upside down.Do you want to change into something more comfortable?I ask.Her shoulders shake like shes laughing.She still wont face me.Are you trying to use some sort of line on me?Let me warn you up front.Im not in the mood.Fable.Like I would expect anything from her tonight.Im not trying to get in your pants.I want to take care of you.Fine.She rolls over onto her back and undoes the snap on her jeans, shimmying out of them.Despite my not wanting anything from herand I swear I dontI cant help but stare at her legs, not to mention those lacy pink panties she has on that are barely covering her.Swallowing hard, I glance down, trying to gain some composure.I shouldnt act like a pervert in her time of need, but I look at her and I want her.Its an automatic reaction.I glance up to catch her shrugging out of her shirt and tossing it on the floor.She reaches beneath her tank and undoes the clasp of her bra, pulling it off from under her top in that magical way girls have.The bra is white and lacy, a little scrap of fabric that falls from her fingertips.Shes wearing just the tank and the panties, her nipples pressing against her top, gooseflesh rising on her skin, and I release a shuddering breath.Tell myself to get the hell over it and do the right thing.Cold?I can grab an extra blanket No.She shakes her head and bounds up from the bed, tugging back the comforter and sheet so she can slip beneath them.Im just really, really tired.I stand there, not knowing what to do.Shes giving off a weird vibe.I know shes upset and she has every reason to be.Not only did her mom pull a really crappy move, but Owen blames her for it.Her back is to me, her blond hair a mess around her head, and I want to go to her so bad.But Im afraid shell reject me.Are you coming to bed?she asks, her voice soft.She just made up my mind for me.Yeah, I say, removing my clothes until Im only in my boxer briefs.Turning off the bedside lamp, I get into bed and pull the covers over me, wondering if I should reach for her.I decide to stay on my back and stare up at the ceiling instead, my arms folded behind my head.Shes quiet, shes hardly moving, and I think she mightve already fallen asleep.Drew?Guess shes still awake.Yeah.Thank you for letting us stay with you.She rolls over to face me and I turn my head so our gazes meet.You didnt have to do that.What the hell?Im irritated.Does she think Id let her deal with this on her own?Of course I had to do that.Where else would you two go?She shrugs one shoulder.I wouldve figured something out.I bet Colin wouldve taken us in.I hear he lives in a freaking mansion.Im sure he has plenty of room.Fuck me!I cant believe she would say that.The guy was a total dick to me that night I first saw her, making me believe he had something going on with her, and now shes saying she wouldve moved in with him like it was no problem?I dont want to inconvenience you, she continues.First thing tomorrow before I go to work, Im going apartment hunting.Why do you do that?I ask, my voice so low, I sound like Im growling.But damn it, Im pissed.Why do you act like you never want my help?Like you cant count on me to come through for anything?Seriously?Her voice rises.When have you ever come through?I cant count on anyone.No one.Ive always taken care of myself.Im not about to become dependent on you now.Why the hell not?We havent been together long enough for me to come through for you when the going gets tough.But Im here now.Offering everything I have to try to help you and you act like you could give a shit.My blood is boiling.Im infuriated that shes treating me like this.A voice inside my head whispers I need to tread lightly, but screw it.The gloves are coming off.I need to tell her how I feel before I explode and really lose my shit.I said thank you, she whispers.Yeah, like I held a gun to your head and forced you to say it, I return, flicking my gaze away from her so I can stare at the ceiling once again.Shes quiet, I hear the rustle of the sheets and comforter, and I glance at her out of the corner of my eye to see shes curled into a ball, her shoulder shaking.A sob escapes her and she slaps her hand over her mouth.God, shes crying.Probably over how I just yelled at her, like Im some sort of jackass.Come here, I whisper, gathering her in my arms.She comes to me easily, curling her arms around my middle as she rests her head against my bare chest.Her tears dampen my skin as I smooth her hair away from her forehead.I whisper soft words of comfort close to her ear, hating how despondent she sounds.Shes crying hard, her entire body shaking.I fear her heart might be breaking in two.II dont know what to d do, she sobs.I cant believe she left us with nothing.That she didnt tell us she was leaving.Its going to be all right.I tuck a strand of hair behind her ear, run my index finger down the side of her throat.I swear, Ill help you with whatever you need.She takes a deep, shuddering breath.Its not that Im ungrateful.I justI dont know how to do this.Accept help from someone.Ive always carried this load on my own.Its hard to believe someone wants to share the burden.Whatever I can do to help, Im here.You dont have to rush out and find an apartment right away.I slip my finger beneath her chin and lift her head.Her cheeks are streaked with drying tears and black smudges ring beneath her eyes.She never washed off her makeup and she looks so lost, so pitiful, I lean in and brush a soft kiss to her lips.Take your time.Find a good place for you and Owen to live.Id rather they stay with me for the long term but I dont want to push.Having her brother living here with us would beuncomfortable at first, but Fable is literally all he has.Okay.She nods, as if shes trying to convince herself.Okay, youre right.I do need to take my time and not pick the first apartment thats available.She closes her eyes, presses her lips together.I dont have any furniture.She took it all.Even my bed!Ive had that stupid bed for years.Its not even that comfortable.The mattress is all lumpy.I kiss her again.Shes crazy, baby.Bat shit crazy for taking everything like she did, and so quickly, too.I honestly dont know how she did it.I dont know either.It makes no sense.Fable opens her eyes.She makes no sense.I tried to stop figuring her out years ago, but then she goes and pulls a stunt like this and Im left trying to piece together exactly why it happened.Stop thinking about it.I kiss her lips one more time, then drop a kiss on her cheek, her nose, her forehead.Well worry about it tomorrow.You need to get some sleep.She nods, her eyes sliding closed, and she squeezes her arms around me.Im sorry.Im the one whos sorry.I shouldnt have yelled at you.I think I needed it.Her voice is already fading and she nuzzles her face against my chest.You feel so good, Drew.I love you.My heart eases.Im reassured by her sweetly spoken words.I love you, too.Most of the shadows of this life are caused by our standing in ones own sunshine.Ralph Waldo Emerson  Drew So shes moved in with you.Its temporary, Im quick to tell Dr.Harris.I know what shes thinking.What everyone will think, though its not as if I know a ton of people.Were moving too fast, Fable and I.  But its been less than a week since her mom abandoned her and Owen.I just cant kick her out.They have nowhere to go.Besides, I like having Fable living with me.Owen and I have come to a somewhat uneasy truce.I know hes not my biggest fan, but the kid is polite, keeps his room clean, and doesnt give me any trouble.Not that I believed he would.Hes a good kid.Fables raised him right.Doc is tapping away at her iPad.Probably noting how worried she is that Im living with Fable.Are you all getting along?For the most part.I cant lie to her.There was tension at first, most of it coming from Owen.Hes hurt that their mom did this.Understandable.He blamed Fable at first.Also understandable.We sometimes look to put the blame on others because we dont want to believe the truth.She looks at me pointedly.We also tend to blame ourselves.I know all about that.I get it.Theyve hashed stuff out, but its still a little tense between them.So that means its a little tense between Owen and me.But overall, hes a nice kid.I feel bad for him.I remember being a teen.My entire world changed in the blink of an eye.I lost all my innocence, my childhood forever.This betrayal by his mother has taken Owens childhood away from him for good.Has the mother resurfaced at all?Fable finally received a text from her a few days ago.And it had infuriated her.Only two sentences, it sent Fable into a funk that had her stewing the rest of the night.Im so sorry.Someday I hope youll understand.Fable deleted it immediately, calling her mom every horrific name she could think of.Your relationship is already a delicate one.Doesnt this situation put unnecessary stress on the two of you?If we can get through this, we can get through anything, dont you think?Dr.Harris offers me a kind smile.One would think.Such a momentous move while in the early stages of your commitment to each other can also turn everything sour.Are you afraid of that?Of losing her after finally getting her back?Im always afraid of losing Fable.The fear stays in the back of my mind 24/7.Most of the time I push it aside and focus on the present day.She needs me.And you need her, dont you?I do.I take a deep breath.You wont want to hear this, but Id prefer if they lived with me.I like having her there.We dont spend every waking moment together since shes working full time lately and Im in school, but I like My voice trails off.You like what?Dr.Harris asks.I like having her in my bed every night.Waking up with her every morning.Just knowing shes with me gives me a sense of peace I cant remember ever having in my life.I rub my thumb against my knee.I dont want her to leave.She will eventually.It sounds to me like Fable is a very independent person, right?Yeah.I dont want to talk about her any longer.I dont want to think about her leaving me, even if it is just to live on her own.As if she can sense me closing up, my shrink changes the subject.Have you heard from your dad?He called right before I came inside.I didnt answer.I feel guilty for sending him straight to voice mail but I cant deal with another rant.And thats all he does when he calls.Rants about Adele and how much she wronged him.How she humiliated him among their friends and his colleagues.Hes the laughingstock of the country club, shes flaunting her young piece all over town.On and on it goes.Im over it.Ill be there for him, but he still hasnt filed divorce papers.I know deep down inside hes waiting for her to come crawling back and beg for his forgiveness.Fool that he is for her, hell probably take Adele back.I can hardly stomach the thought.He still doesnt know?Shes referring to Adele and me.I shake my head.So she hasnt said anything?Not that I know of.Cold fear grips my gut at the mere thought.Have you ever considered beating her to the punch?When I frown, Dr.Harris continues.Telling your dad before she does?No way.I shake my head.I could never work up the nerve to tell him that.It might be easier coming from you.Being honest with your father might take an incredible load off your chest.If he hears it from Adele first, shes won.Youve allowed her the chance to tell him, to make up whatever story she needs to tell to make herself look better.I study her, letting her words sink in.She has a point.Im way too chickenshit to broach the subject with him, though.Ill consider telling him first, I say only to appease her.She smiles.Im glad.The moment I leave Dr.Harriss office I check my phone.Two missed calls from my dad and one from Fable.I call her first.Youll never believe what happened.She sounds excited.Happy.What?I think I found the perfect apartment.Oh my God, Drew, its so nice!Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, at a newer complex.The rents reasonable and the deposit isnt too outrageous.I went and checked it out with Jen and its beautiful.They already ran a credit check on me and said theyd hold the apartment for me, but I have to come up with the deposit by Friday.Shit.Shes leaving me.Wheres it located?If its in a bad part of town, I refuse to let her move there.Heres whats even better about the apartment.Its not too far from your place.Like about two miles away, tops.On the other side of the shopping center with the grocery store you like to go to.She laughs.I dont have any furniture, but I dont care.Well figure something out.I can shop the Goodwill.Let me help you, I say automatically because I cant not make the offer.No, she says softly.Youve helped me enough already.The money Im making at The District is outrageous.The tips have been amazing.Thats what Im going to use for the deposit to secure the apartment.I have some tip money stashed at your place, but not enough.You dont deposit your tips in the bank?No.Its mostly all ones and fives.I like to keep my cash in the pocket of an old sweater.Did you know I had almost five hundred dollars stashed in that sweater in my closet when my mom went through the house?Thank God they didnt find it.Shes happy she found a place and I should be, too, but Im not.I dont want her to leave.How can I tell her that without sound cloying or overbearing?Are you going to my place now?In a little bit.I have to go by and pick up my check.Then Jen will drop me off.Where are you?Headed home, I say as I walk toward where I parked my truck.Oh, good.Owen should be there.He just called me and said he was being dropped off.Is moving going to change where he goes to school?She sighs.Yeah.He doesnt mind, though.Says he wants a change, though hell miss his best friend.I promised him they could get together whenever he wants.Itll work out, I reassure her.I hope so.Ill see you soon, okay?She hangs up before I can tell her I love her and I stare at my phones screen, wishing I had said the words.Being with Fable has turned me into a complete sap.My phone immediately starts ringing again.This time its my dad.I answer it, steeling myself for the inevitable spew of words over his hatred for his wife.Hey, Dad.Wheres Adele?Have you seen her?I stop in the middle of the sidewalk, causing someone passing by to bump into me.Why would I see her?Whats going on?I dont know.Wetalked this morning.Then we started to argue and she brought you up.Said she needed to see you and took off in my fucking Jag.Have you seen her?Did she come there?Of course I havent seen her.Dread creeps over me, making my head spin.Why would she want to come see me?I havent a clue.She said she had something to tell you.He pauses.Dont turn her away, okay?Please?Hear her out, whatever she has to say.Im sure shes going to you to ask if you would help convince me that the two of us belong together.He sounds smug, funny considering only last night hed been a ragged mess, practically crying over her cheating ways.Hes way off base with her wanting to talk to me.Adele knows the last thing I would do is hear her out over how much she and my dad are meant to be together.She wouldnt have the balls to do something like that.Theres something else to this story.Something I dont want to know.If you see her, call me.Promise?I promise, I say before I end the call.The entire drive back to my place, I keep a lookout for my dads sleek black Jaguar, but I dont spot it anywhere.That type of car is a dime a dozen back home.Here, in this small college town thats filled mostly with Hondas and Toyotas, the car stands out like a glaring beacon.Thank God I dont spot the Jag in my complexs parking lot, either.Relieved I dodged that bullet, I head toward my apartment, surprised to find the door unlocked when I enter.Surprised even more to find Adele sitting on my fucking couch, Owen sitting next to her and looking incredibly uneasy.Andrew!She stands, pushing her long dark hair over her shoulder.Youre home!I shut the door, my gaze going to Owen, who sprang up so fast from that couch he reminded me of a jack in the box.Hell hardly meet my eyes, and Im instantly taken back in time.I remember how she used to spend all of her time with me.Flattering me.At first, she made me nervous.I wasnt used to that sort of constant, almost overbearing attention.But after a while, I started to crave it.She knew exactly what she was doing, how she was manipulating me to fall under her spell.Get away from him, I say a little too forcefully, shocking both of them.Keep your fucking hands off him, AdeleI mean it.She smirks, shooting Owen a long, sultry look.Hes a sweet, sweet boy, Andrewreminds me so much of you that age.Tall and handsome, and so strong.Hes going to be quite the looker someday.Ive never been tempted to do harm to a woman in my life.Yet at this very moment, if I could wrap my hands around her neck and squeeze the ever loving life out of her, Id have no regrets.Go to your room, Owen, I demand.He scurries off without protest, slamming the door so hard, Adele jumps, then titters nervously.You dont need to scare the poor boy.I didnt do a thing to him.You know I only have eyes for you.She comes close to me.I can smell the scent of alcohol emanating from her body.She has to be drunk.Sidestepping her, I ignore what she said.Shes just trying to get a rise out of me, as usual.Wheres Dads Jag?She laughs.I parked it on the street, behind this building.Pretty devious, right?I knew you would flip if you saw the car.Knew that your dad would contact you and ask you to look for me.Heaven forbid he actually do it himself.She plops down on the couch, her body draped across it.You have a nice place here.Why does your little sluts brother live with you?Its none of your goddamn business, I bite out.You call Fable a slut one more time, I wont be held responsible for what I do to you.Such anger!You know, Im surprised the two of you are still together.I didnt pick her as your type.She tilts her head and smiles.You deserve someone so much prettier, a better match for you.You have so much potential.Too much to squander it all on a stupid girl like Fable.Adele spits out Fables name like its poison.Fable does much the same with Adeles name.I already told you, watch what you say.She waves a hand.What are your plans for the future anyway, hmm, Andrew?Do you plan on moving on to pro ball?I know thats your dream.I think you could do it.Youve always chased your dreams and accomplished so much at such a young age.What is she talking about?Im not discussing my future with you or what I plan on doing next.You need to leave.Her eyes widen in feigned shock.Why, Andrew, I cant believe you would say such a thing to me.Are you that eager to get rid of me?Yes, I tell her bluntly.We stare at each other blindly for a long, uncomfortable moment, until finally her eyes narrow and she rests her hands on her hips.Im going to tell him, Andrew.Im going to tell your dad about you and me and what we did.What we made.Vanessa.Theres nothing you can do to stop me, either.It feels like all the blood is draining from my body.Why would you do that?I need to come clean.She shrugs.I need to get my sins off my chest, Andrew.Youre my biggest sin.Did you know that?Ive never done anything so wicked as what I did with you.Shut up.If I could slap my hands over my ears to drown out what shes saying like some sort of little kid, I would.Just shut up.Truth hurts, doesnt it?Imagine what itll do to your dad.Oh, itll tear him up.Destroy him and his relationship with you.Youll lose him forever.She smiles.Ive already lost him.What does it matter if you lose him, too?Get out, I tell her.I need her gone.Fables due home any minute and I cant risk a confrontation.Dont be so quick to send me home now.I fully plan on telling your father everything the second I see him.She heads toward the door, her walk smooth, her head held high as if she were some sort of queen.The perfect image she must keep up has to be exhausting.I should know.I did much of the same thing for years.Why would you want to do that to him?To me?I thought you loved him.I dont understand why she needs to do this.I dont love him.He doesnt fulfill me.I stay with him for the beautiful house and the cars and the jewelry and the money.I dont think Ive loved him for years.This isnt my problem.None of what shes saying has anything to do with me.That she would be so cold, talking about my father, is hard for me to swallow, but I need to push past it all and get rid of this bitch.But before I can so much as push Adele out of the apartment, the door swings open and Fable walks in, stopping short when she sees whos standing in front of her.Fable Seeing Adele in Drews living room nearly sends me stumbling backward.Luckily enough, Im able to gain my footing so I dont make a fool of myself.Also luckily enough, I find my voice immediately.What the fuck is she doing here?I ask, looking pointedly at Drew.Adele laughs her bitch cackle.As crude as ever, I see.The epitome of class, arent you, Fable?At least I dont pretend to be full of class when so clearly youre not, considering you like to molest teenage boys.I slam the door, realization dawning on me, and I look at Drew.Wheres Owen?In his room, Drew says, his voice gentle.Hes safe.I promise.You two treat me like some sort of common child molester out to pick up little boys off the street, when you couldnt be farther from the truth.Adele sends Drew a warm smile, which totally creeps me out.He seduced me as well, you know.I mean, look at him.Hes always been a beautiful boy.The bitch just crossed a line, and now Im crossing one right back.I dont know whats come over me, what possesses me to do something so crazy, and I know there will be an eventual price to pay.But here I go.Its as though its all happening in slow motion and I know Im going to do it before I actually complete the act.I launch myself at her.Take her to the ground so hard, I hear her scream of pain when her body hits the floor.Im sitting on top of her, tugging at her long, sleek hair, trying to scratch her beautiful smug face like Ive always wanted to do.I want to beat the crap out of her and leave her as bruised and battered on the outside as she left Drew bruised and battered on the inside.Doing all that, I know I still wont be satisfied.Fable, Jesus, stop!Drew is yelling at me but I wont listen.Im ready to tear this bitch apart.Im pulling her hair, scratching at her, cocking my fist back ready to punch her square in the face, and thats when Drew grabs hold of my arm, stopping my fist from making a connection with Adeles jaw.Get off her.Now.Im shaking, full of rage and fear and adrenaline.Both of us are panting, the sound filling the otherwise quiet room.Adele stares up at me with her dark, mysterious eyes and I wonder what happened in her past to turn this woman into such a complete fuck up.Fable.Drew tugs on my arm so I have no choice but to climb off Adele and stand.His fingers are clasped tight around my upper arm and we both watch as Adele gets up, the expression on her face nothing short of murderous.I should call the cops, she says, pointing her finger at me.And press fucking charges, you lunatic bitch!She didnt touch you, Drew says in that scary menacing voice of his.What are you saying?She was all over me!Adele holds out her arms.I suppose there might be a few scratches there, but nothing I can see.Look at me!Get out.Just get out, he says, ignoring her outstretched arms, her plea for help.All of it.Before Im the one doing something Ill regret.Her eyes go wide for the quickest moment, and then shes gone.Fleeing the apartment like some sort of terrorist in flight after dropping a major bomb in the middle of a crowded room.The door slams behind her and I fall onto the couch, my entire body shaking with anger.Why did she come here?I look up at Drew.Misery is written all over his face.His brows are drawn, his mouth a thin, grim line.I dont know.To tell me shes going to confess to my dad everything that happened between us?She claims shes going to tell him about Vanessa, too.He sits down heavily beside me, tension radiating off his body in waves.Should I call him?Should I be the one who tells him first?Dr.Harris says I should.I part my lips, but the words clog my throat.I still cant believe what I did.How quickly I jumped her, how bad I wanted to hurt her.I may act like Im tough, but I never resort to violence.I never got in physical fights at school.That woman makes me want to lose my mind.I cant make that decision for you, I finally say.I know its harsh, but I wont be responsible for Drew telling his dad or not about what happened.He needs to come to that conclusion on his own.Youre right.I know youre right.He blows out a harsh breath.I dont know how to tell him, though.Im scared.I hook my arm around his shoulders, trying to give him comfort.Hes stiff beneath my touch, though, and I end up running my hand down his back before letting my arm drop.Itll be okay, I murmur.Dont let that bitch bother you.Easy to say, not so easy to do.He looks at me.His gaze is bleak, his face pale.Shell ruin everything, Fable.Shes trying to destroy my life.I stare at him.Hes giving her so much control still.I thought he was starting to move past this.Clearly, she still has her claws in him.He looks terrified.We wont let her, Drew.Ill stand by you no matter what.Ill support you.It doesnt matter what she says.What if she wants to take it further?What ifwhat if she wants to go to the media or whatever?Try to make me look bad around here, in the community.That will destroy me.Destroy my chances at a professional football career.Is that what you want?He never talks about football much with me.He seems to compartmentalize all these different parts of his life and only reveal what he thinks I should see.Yeah.He hangs his head.I dont know what else I would do.Im a business major with a minor in finance.But I did that to please my dad.Hey.I rest my hand on his knee and give him a little shake.Its going to be okay.Really.Drew settles his hand over mine and gives it a squeeze.We look at each other as he laces our fingers together and then hes leaning in, kissing me, so softly, so sweetly I almost want to cry.Touching my cheek with his other hand, he breathes words against my lips that make my heart ache for him.I love you so damn much.I know this has happened fast and were having to deal with a lot of shit, but if we can make it through this, we can make it through anything.Hes right.He has to be right.If I could, Id beg him to take me to bed right now.So we could lose ourselves in each other, if only for a little bit.But nows not the time.There are other things to consider first.And Owen Wheres Owen?I ask after I break our kiss.As if hes lurking behind his bedroom door just waiting to bust out, he enters the living area, stopping short when he sees the two of us sitting so close together.We havent been very affectionate or grabby in front of my brother.It makes me uncomfortable, which is so stupid, but I know Owen doesnt approve one hundred percent of me being with Drew.Crazy.I shouldnt care.I love this man sitting beside me.And I love the boy standing in front of us.That chick was creepy.Owen shakes his head, looking at Drew.She said she was your mom?Drew stiffens beside me.Shes not.Shes married to my dad.My mom died when I was little.Wait a minute.I disentangle myself from Drew and stand, going to Owen.You met her?You talked to her?She was in the apartment when I got home, Drew adds.With Owen?Alone?Im stunned.What.The.Hell.Who let her in?I did, Owen admits sheepishly.She was waiting outside when I got here.She said she was Drews mom and that she needed to see him, so I let her in.Oh my God.Im reeling.How long were you with her alone?I dont know.Ten minutes?Owen shrugs.Whats the big deal?Shes weird, Ill give her that.But its not like she did anything to me.You act like shed want to feel me up or something.I look at Drew.No way am I going to say anything to Owen aboutthat.Shes a little mentally unstable at the moment.Everyones worried about her.Ick.I cant believe I just said that.Im not worried about her.I wish shed fall off the face of the earth and rot in hell forever.I thought I heard you two fighting, Owen said, shifting on his feet.He looks uncomfortable.We dont really like each other.I circle my arm around Owens shoulders and lead him into the kitchen.I need to change the subject, and quick.I have good news.I found an apartment for us.Really?Hes so excited as I tell him all the details, hyperaware of Drew sitting in the living room, alone with his thoughts.Im torn.Excited to find my own place for Owen and me, but sad to leave Drew.I need this independence.But I need Drew as well.And he needs menow more than ever.I hope I can be enough for him.I hope we can be enough for each other.The truth is rarely pure and never simple.Oscar Wilde  Adele Im sick and tired of feeling guilty for the things Ive done.I cant help who I fall in love with.Why is it such a crime, falling in love?My husband neglected me for years.His son reminds me so much of himonly better.Younger.More vibrant.Sweet and eager to please.At first it was all for fun.When her husband loses interest in her sexually, a woman starts to feel less than.Ignored.Alone.I started flirting with Drew and he responded.Oh, maybe he was a little uncomfortable at first but the more we talked, the more time we spent together, the more he liked it.The more he liked me.Now he hates me.I dont know where it all went wrong.I dont understand his total disgust for me.I wish I could change it.I wish I could make him see I only want the very best for him.He has so much potential.Hell be a star someday.A bright, shiny star who for a brief moment, I held in my hands.Only he slipped away and has no plans on ever coming back.The disappointment that floods me every time I think of him is so overwhelming, I cant dwell on it for long.So I dont.Ive had affairs.Brief, meaningless dalliances with beautiful young men who make me feel good for a little while.Jonah the golf pro is my latest indulgence, and while hes magnificent in bed and eagerly attentive, hes also young and foolish and enjoys bragging to his friends that hes banging an older woman.They call me a cougar.So crude, these boys are.Not my Drew.Scratch thatmy Andrew.Im the only one who calls him that.The only one whos allowed.I drive around the backwater little town he lives in while he goes to college, getting lost on all the one way streets while I try to find a decent hotel.The campus is nice, the downtown area eclectic, with lots of cute shops and restaurants.Other than that, the town is an absolute shit hole.If he remains here with that stupid, useless girl, he will go nowhere.Thinking of her makes me want to vomit.I cant believe she attacked me.My head still hurts where she literally ripped the hair out of my scalp.The way she looked at me, the words she said!She hates me.Thats fine.I hate her, too.Shes turned my beautiful boy completely against me, and the idea of her having sex with him makes me want to tear her apart.Andrew is mine.He belongs to me.I finally find a hotel and check in, handing over my husbands credit card.The price doesnt matter.Price never matters.Andy hasnt cut off my credit cards or my access to our bank account, none of it.No matter what I do, no matter what I say, he wants me back.Im his favorite prized possession and the idea that I might belong to someone else fills him with worry.He wont let me go.Thats both reassuring and cloying.I need Andy for financial security.I want others for excitement and passion.My husband can no longer give me that sort of excitement, which is a shame.I go to my hotel room, bringing with me the small travel bag I packed just for this special occasion.Id hoped Andrew would let me stay with him, but he has that bitch girlfriend living at his apartment for the moment, along with her younger brother.Who was a most interesting specimen, if Im being truthful.Hes handsome and young and full of attitudeI could sense it the moment I set eyes on him.Not necessarily my usual type, with his blond hair and green eyes, his slender build and wannabe bad boy personality.He has potential, though.Tremendous potential.Setting my bag on top of the bed, I unzip it and reach inside, pulling out the small handgun I took from my husbands dresser.He keeps it there for protection.I brought it with me for the same reason.Im about to do something that will change our lives forever and Im not sure how others might react.Im especially grateful I brought it, considering that stupid bitch is still in Andrews life.It might be a mistake making my confession, but I need to get this information off my chest.Andy deserves the truth.Andrew must face his truth.I may have told Andrew that Vanessa belonged to him, but I dont know if its true.I want it to be true.Id much prefer believing Andrew was her father.Unfortunately, I never had it confirmed.There is no absolute proof for me regarding her paternity.But now shes gone, and though its wishful thinking on my part that Andrew would ever gift me with another child, I still hope for it.Despite his hatred for me.Despite his fear and disgust for me, I still wish for him to be mine.Forever.Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.Bruce Lee  Drew When your phone rings at two in the morning and wakes you from a deep sleep, you know its never good.The ringing startles me and I reach for my cell where it rests on my bedside table, my heart thumping wildly.Fable moves away from me in her sleep, rolling over on her side, her naked back to me.Im immediately cold without having her close and I glance at the phone, see that its my dad calling.Again.Reluctantly I answer, keeping my voice a whisper.Hello.Drew.My God.Hes breathing heavily and I restrain myself from blowing out an exasperated breath.Im so over his drama I can hardly take another anguished phone call, another crying plea.Is it true?Its as if all the blood drains from my body.You tell yourself youre prepared for a particular moment, a certain revelation, but when it happens, youre still knocked on your ass.Is what true?Adele told me what happened between you two.His voice lowers to an almost inaudible whisper.Tell me, is it true?I dont know what he wants me to say.Yes, its true or no, its not?Fuck, Im confused.What did she tell you?That the two of you had an affair going on for years?Tell me, son.I need to know.Is she lying to me?Please say shes lying.He doesnt want to deal.Well, thats just great because neither do I.  Dad Dont beat around the bush.Just confirm it.Say yes or say no.I exhale heavily, my heart aching, my stomach turning.I Say it!Yes or no.Its as simple as that.Right.Its so simple, admitting my deepest, darkest secret.Yes, I say, my voice harsh.Dad is silent for so long, I wonder if hes hung up on me.But then a burst of sound fills my ears, so ragged and pitiful, I almost dont recognize it for what it is.Hescrying.I hate her, he sobs, his voice broken.Shes destroyed everything.My marriage, my son, my daughter.Oh God, I hate her so much.I climb out of bed, never looking in Fables direction.She might be awake by now, I dont know, but I need to concentrate on what Dad is saying.At the moment hes sort of blowing my mind.I cant believe that she had anaffair with you.An affair.He laughs, but its hollow sounding.She molested you.God, shes sick!I never want to see her again.You dont blame me?I fall onto the couch, my head spinning.
