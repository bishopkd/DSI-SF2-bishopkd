Oh, thats right, I guess everyone does, huh?She could have been talking about the latest summer movie.Did anything get to this woman?She laid a hand on his arm.It was so nice meeting you, Quinn.Listen, I just know youre going to have a fabulous vacation here.Its like magic, this house!And hey, Im not kidding about that sunset.Will I see you there?He nodded woodenly.All right!A playful slap on his shoulder and she was gone, springing up the stairs.Quinn locked his door, trudged into the living room, and flopped onto the rump sprung sofa.Little Richard began hollering his way through Good Golly Miss Molly.It was a big house, but it wasnt that big.How was Quinn supposed to avoid Phil Owens runaway bride for a whole damn month?Two   THERE WAS THAT odd pounding again.Molly paused to listen, the silver plated trumpet poised at her lips.The noise from downstairs stopped.She shrugged and resumed her playing, improvising around her favorite New Orleans jazz riffs.There it was again!What was Quinn doing down there, heavy construction?The living room floor quaked under her feet.Molly moved to the top of the stairs and called down, Quinn!Belatedly remembering hed locked his door, she smiled.You could take the boy out of the city...Horn in hand, she descended the stairs and knocked on his door.She heard movement, sensed him hesitating on the other side.Finally the lock turned and the door eased open a scant few inches.A heavenly aroma drifted out, something spicy with a base of sauted onions and garlic.She looked up into those gray green, heavy lidded eyes, framed by lush black lashesand felt the same giddy jolt that had struck her earlier that day when theyd first met.These were the voluptuous eyes of a practiced gigolo, or an imperious sheik with carnal intent and his choice of slave girls.Not some uptight ad exec on holiday.She chalked it up to one of Mother Natures little practical jokes.Quinn, whatre you doing to the ceiling?Exterminating termites with a baseball bat?Through the narrow opening she saw he held something in his hand.A broom.He was pounding on the ceiling!Oh, wait.Is that about this?She held up the trumpet.The door opened fractionally wider and she saw he was barefoot and bare chested, wearing only thin gray sweatpants.His expression was tightly shuttered, revealing the barest whiff of annoyance.He said, Its after midnight.She leaned on the doorframe.Yeah, but I heard you moving around down here, so I knew you hadnt gone to bed.What, was my playing bothering you?Its a little late to be blasting away on a trumpet, dont you think?No.Since you ask.She grinned.That pounding on the ceilingthats such a city thing.Why didnt you just come up and ask me to stop?If it was bothering you.I didnt say it was...He looked away.Pushed his fingers through his short black hair.You play quite well, actually.Thanks.But if you want me to stop...No.This is stupid.He glanced at the broom in his hand, clearly chagrined.I guess it was just...Force of habit?She smiled.His mouth quirked.I guess so.Whatre you cooking?It smells outrageous!She stuck her head in the door, pushing it wider.Chili con queso.Hot cheese dip.No kidding!She squeezed past him and headed into the kitchen, where the concoctionorange melted cheese with specks of red tomato, green jalapeo, and golden onionsbubbled in a cast iron frying pan.A sense of humor and he cooks.Marry me, Quinn.He said, I guess theres enough for two.Can I, uh, get you something to drink?Oh, Im terrible, arent I, barging in here and making myself at home.Beer if you have it.She opened the refrigerator and perused the contents.Quinn, I thought you went shopping today.Hed gone for a drive and returned with sacks from the supermarket.I have beer.He crossed the room, opened a couple of high cupboards, and pulled down a bag of tortilla chips and a heavy stoneware bowl.Molly enjoyed watching him move, with an easy masculine grace she doubted he was aware of.Shed known Quinn had a nice body even before seeing him half naked like this.Despite that loose polo shirt hed worn earlier, her eagle eye had detected firm pecs, a flat belly, and world class shoulders that she now struggled not to ogle too blatantly.Molly liked shoulders.But thats about all you have, she said.Beer.Soda.Bottled water.A quart of milk.What, are you on a liquids only diet?Look in the freezer.As he carried the food into the living room, she just made out his muttered Since youre taking inventory.Frozen dinners?Quinn, youve got a barbecue grill out there on the deck!Didnt you see it?Theres also a microwave.Its easier.You gonna come eat this or not?Its not about easy.Its about summer.Its about the Cape.Gosh, its not like you dont know how to cook!She opened her beer and joined him in the living room, where she carefully placed her trumpet on the sideboard before flopping onto the end of the sofa and stretching her legs out on the cushions.She, too, was barefoot, dressed in a white, spaghetti strap top with a huge sunflower design on the front, and denim cutoffs short enough for the bottoms of the pockets to peek out under the frayed hem.Quinn sat on one of the well worn easy chairs, his slightly stiff posture at odds with his state of dishabille.Leaning toward the wooden coffee table, she reached for a chip and scooped up a gob of dip.Careful, he said.Thats hot.She blew on it and popped it inand applied a therapeutic mouthful of cold beer as the melted cheese scalded the roof of her mouth.When she could speak again, she said, Im impatient.Is that a sign of immaturity, do you think?Being unable to delay gratification?Quinn appeared to give that some thought as he loosened the cap on his bottle of spring water.I dont know you well enough to say.Do you think its a sign of immaturity?Gosh, shed been kidding, just trying to make conversation.Sense of humor or no, this was one serious guy.He continued, As far as immaturity goes, there are more clear cut indicators.Like irresponsibility.Failure to live up to ones commitments.He left that hanging there, those gigolo eyes peering at her from under thick, dark brows as he reached for a chip.Then she got it.Phil.The wedding.I know what you mustve heard, she said.What Phil must be saying about me.He didnt have to say anything.I was there.Where?At the church, you mean?He nodded.That looked bad, I know, she said.Leaving your groom standing at the altar?What do you think?He wasnt actually standing at the altar!Close enough.The wedding march was playing, Molly.You never showed.I showed.Is that what he told everyone?That I never even made it to the church?Molly sat up crossed legged, all ears, fascinated to learn what Phil was saying about her.Quinn paused in the act of dipping a chip, as if her eager attentiveness confounded him.Well, that was the impression.Phil didnt make the announcement himself, of course.His brother Ronhe was the best man  Nice guy, Ron, she said.Heck of a poker player.Tried to teach me to bluff, but Im not very good at it.Ron stopped the organ music and told all the guests that the wedding was canceled.That the bride had backed out.Molly lifted her beer.Well, thats true.I did.He stared at her.How can you be so blas about it?It was four months ago, Quinn.Im over it.Youre over it!He sat forward, his face darkening.What about Phil?The grief you caused him.The humiliation.Do you want to hear my side?He sat back.No.I didnt think so, she said pleasantly.People are comfortable with what they know, you know?Or what they think they know.Why did Phil fire you?The abrupt question rendered him momentarily speechless.Gosh, she hadnt meant to embarrass him.Her and her big mouth!I mean, youre obviously still on good terms with him, she said.Thats so important, not to hold a grudge.Too many people, they cant get past their ego, you know?Especially guys.This chili is fabulous.Youve got to teach me how to make it.It was purely a business decision, Quinn said tightly.Its not like I was let go for cause or anything.You must know about the merger with Glacken and Ross.Massive reorganization.Unfortunately, I was one of the casualties.Phil felt rotten about it, but its not like he had a choice.How long did you work there?Four months.You mustve joined just after I left.I took off the last couple of weeks before the wedding to get ready, do all the last minute preparations.It was going to be like this huge fairy tale production.You shouldve seen my gownI felt like Cinderella at the ball.Until she dragged her train through dirt and gravel, crammed the voluminous ivory silk into the drivers seat of her sister Tonis battered, two tone Honda hatchback, and burned rubber out of the church parking lot.Tears had smeared her vision until shed finally pulled off the highway and brought up her breakfast in a stand of winter brown forsythia.Quinn was looking at her with a strange intensity that made Molly wonder if he sensed the direction of her thoughts.She willed the memory back into its dark little cave.Nothing good came of dwelling on the hurt.So, she said.You must still be tight with Phil to rent part of his beach house for the month.Quinn opened his mouth as if to amend her statement, and hesitated.Like you said, no point in holding a grudge.You, on the other handI must admit, Im surprised youd want to stay here, all things considered.And, frankly, just as surprised Phil agreed to it.Well, he knows how much I love this house and the Cape.We spent so much time here, so many long weekends.I just knew this was where I had to come to collect my thoughts, to find myself, you know?Its like this house was calling to me.Its worth every penny.Quinn looked as if he wanted to ask her something but knew he shouldnt.He did it anyway.How much is he charging you?Nine hundred fifty bucks.His eyebrows rose.Sweet deal.He must still have a soft spot for you somewhere, Molly.This place is pretty rundown, but he could get a lot more than nine fifty a month.Oh, thats per week.The chili was congealing fast.She troweled a glob onto a chip.Wait a minute.Phils charging you nine fifty a week?Thatsthats thirty eight hundred for the month!Well, more, really.The month is four and a half weeks.But its still a bargain.He usually gets well over a thousand a week.Thats what he told you?Uh huh.Why?Whats he charging you?Quinn lifted his bottle of spring water.Took a long swallow.Set it back down.No offense, but I dont like discussing my finances.Just other peoples.At his sharp look she laughed and hurled a throw pillow at him.Just kidding!You gotta loosen up, Quinn.Youre on vacation!He said, You were a copy editor for Phils firm, right?She grunted, Mm hmm around a mouthful of food.I take it you havent found another position?Job markets tough.I figure if nothing full time opens up when I get back, I can always do freelance.She ran a chip along the inside of the bowl, scraping off the last of the chili.But dont you have expenses, an apartment to pay for?Youre so sweet to be concerned about me.I dont have anything left in the bank, but thank heaven for plastic.Without that cash advance, I wouldnt be here this summer.You financed this vacation with a credit card?So?
