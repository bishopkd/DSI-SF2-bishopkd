So where exactly does that leave me?I should make more effort to do things at Petals school, join committees and the like.But when would I find the time?Olly slips his hand in mine and, Petal safely deposited for the next few hours, we wander into the town centre.Our plan is to do nothing but spend the morning drinking coffee together and catching up with the real world in the dog eared newspapers provided by the shop.We have a proper talk about the show now that were both more awake and receptive.For once, he seems genuinely enthusiastic.But then, I confess that I just tell him about the good bits and not how I spent much of the week with Tod, which he would definitely not view as a good bit.Its a brilliant, sunny day so later, when we pick up Petal, we take her straight to Bancroft Gardens and we all run around the park like loons, swooping and chasing each other with aeroplane arms until were sick with laughter.Then Petal plays on the see saw with Olly and they run round and round the bandstand long after my energy has been exhausted.This is our favourite park to come to and its been here since Olly and I were both kids.Petal loves it too.It has a bowling green, tennis courts, fantastic flower beds stuffed full of those plants that councils like so much  begonias, lobelia, chrysanthemums  all in gloriously clashing colours.I think its nice that, after all these years, it still retains a quaint, old fashioned air.Theres always talk of redeveloping it, upgrading the facilities.But who knows if they ever will.Probably the only addition to the park since I was a girl is a bench full of drunks who sit here day in, day out, and put the world to rights with their cans of Stella.We find a place on the grass away from them and eat our supermarket made sandwiches while we listen to Petals relentlessly cheerful stream of chatter.The sun beats down on me and I feel my heart ease.Ive missed them both so much.Its good to be back and be normal again.Im looking forward to staying at home tonight with you, Olly says, arm slung round my shoulder.Quality time with my wifey.Oh, I say.I thought Id pop in and see everyone from the chippy later.I wanted to see Jen and thank her for helping us out.Shes cool, Olly says somewhat shiftily.I thanked her for us.I have to keep on the right side of Jen as, in the future, therell be more and more of these shows to go to.The next one coming up is Paris Fashion Week, which Ive arranged to go to with Tod, and Ill be begging for her help again then.I can go in late afternoon instead.Catch them after the lunchtime rush.I havent seen Phil or Constance properly for ages.Apart from a two minute handover last night on Constances part.Do you mind?No.Itll do you good to see them again.But his arm drops from my shoulders nevertheless.At four oclock, Olly takes Petal home and I swing into the arcade that houses Live and Let Fry.I throw open the door and, for a brief moment, have a rush of sensation that says  Ive come home.Nell, Constance cries out.Our Nells here!She completely abandons the customer who she was serving with his late lunch and comes to hug the life out of me.I dont remind her that she did the same thing to me just last night.Phil also wipes his hands on his apron, peels it off and comes to wrap his arms round me.Only Jenny hangs back.Hey, I say.Ive missed you all.I feel as guilty as hell that Ive neglected these guys recently in my quest for fame and fortune.Its been weeks since Ive seen you.Were still here, Nell, Phil says with a shrug.Nothing much changes.Business good?Booming, he confirms.My handiwork still looks great, even though I say it myself.Weve got someone to replace you, Constance continues.Chloe.Shes a darling.All the customers adore her.Oh.Great.But, for some reason, I feel piqued about that.Chloe, eh?Ive only been gone five minutes and, so soon, someone else has taken my place.I get the feeling that Im disconnecting with my old life once more.I want to tell them all about my work, work that they helped me start, a career that without them cajoling me, I never would have had the courage to contemplate, but I feel that they wouldnt understand, that they wouldnt be all that interested.And who could blame them?But Ive barely got my toe in the fashion world, so Ive no one I can talk to there.Once again, it makes me wonder exactly where I do belong these days.Weve heard from Jen that youve been here, there and everywhere.Havent we, Jen?Constance shoots her a look.Yeah.Finally, Jen steps forward and hugs me.But theres a tightness about her body, a reluctance to touch me that I havent felt before.Youre my angel, I tell her earnestly.Then to Phil and Constance, I honestly dont know what Id have done without this woman.A slightly dark look passes between Phil and Constance.Fleeting, ever so fleeting, but I catch it anyway.Sit down.Sit down.Phil clears one of the tables and we all slide into chairs.I notice that Phil and Constance sit together and theres a growing closeness between them thats more than their usual familiar banter.I smile to myself.It would be nice to see them properly together as a couple.Theyve both been alone for too long.Perhaps its nice that theyre taking their time to edge closer together rather than rushing headlong into something that could spoil the relationship theyve built up over many years.You need to be careful not to upset the status quo.Yeah.Look whos talking.Jen, love.Get that kettle on, Phil says.Will you have some chips, Nell?Of course you will.As if Im going to refuse!Ive been pining for your fries.But Im ashamed to say that in reality, Ive hardly given my old mates a second thought in recent weeks.I have no excuse other than Ive been ridiculously busy and that work occupies my every waking moment.Jen!Bring some chips too.Shes been brilliant, I tell them both.Really.Petal adores her.I wouldnt be able to go away half as much if it wasnt for Jen helping out.Suddenly, I feel as if Im defending her, defending myself.Their faces are impassive.What?I ask.What do you know that I dont?Nothing, Constance says.Phil pats her leg and slides out of his seat.Ill just go and see how Jens doing.That leaves me and Constance alone.Well?Its nothing, love, my friend says.Nothing at all.Nothing to worry about.Now I am worried, I tell her.Constances hand covers mine, which is always a bad sign.Just be careful, she says.About what?Its all very well running round the world with your new business but dont forget about your home, love.I bristle.I dont.Constance looks embarrassed.Has someone been saying something?I ask.Has Olly complained?No, no, she assures me.Its just a silly old woman and her fears.She pauses, clearly trying to choose her words carefully.Men like to be at the top of the list though, Nell.Not near the bottom.All this is for Olly.And Petal.I know that.You know that.But does everyone else?Who?Sometimes people are jealous of success, Nell, she tells me.Dont take your eye off the ball, love, or someone might come in and steal it away from you.Phil comes back with a big plate of chips piled high, and Constance falls silent.Jen follows with a tray of cups and a big pot of tea.Now Im wishing that I hadnt called in at all.Clearly something isnt right and Im the only one whos completely oblivious to it.Jenny starts to pour out the tea.Ill be mum.The penny drops.Maybe thats what Jenny thinks shes going to be doing at my house!Maybe she thinks shes going to take over as mum there.She sploshes the tea into the cups.Help yourself, Nell, she says.I wonder if shes been doing that too.Oh, God.I feel sick.Have I missed any signs?Olly moans that I talk about Tod a lot, but he never says anything about Jen.I didnt even think he liked her all that much.What to do?Perhaps I should confront her, confront Olly?But what would I say?I only have Constances suspicions to go on.Then a thought pulls me up short.I cant afford to upset Jenny.I cant afford to rock the boat.I need her to look after Petal while Im away.My daughter loves her.That worries me even more.Jennys the one who spends more time with her than me at the moment.But Ive got Paris Fashion Week coming up.Thats mega important.I cant not go and yet its too short notice to find someone else to look after Petal.I grit my teeth.Jen had better watch it though.Ill be keeping a close eye on her from now on.I know that sacrifices have to be made for my career.But I dont intend my marriage to be one of them.48      Petal is puking up again.No one told me when I signed up for motherhood that part of the deal was regular and inappropriately timed bouts of vomiting.When I decided that Id like to have a child, I really had no idea that they could produce that much sick.Now, after four years of practice, that I can deal with.Whats more worrying is that Petal is also covered in livid red spots.Shes not had those before.Chicken pox, Doctor Olly pronounces as I wipe her down with a flannel.Is this a guess or are you sure?Google, Olly says.Im pretty sure.Oh, God.I am due at the Eurostar terminal in less than an hour to catch a train to Paris.If I dont go soon, this minute, I wont make my connection.And this is Paris Fashion Week.This is a big deal.The biggest deal.Olly must read the bleakness on my face.Go, he says.You go.Jenny and I will look after her.I dont like the way that statement slips so easily from his tongue.Jenny and I.  Im still not sure if theres anything going on between them and, coward that I am, I havent had the courage to ask.I cant leave my sick child, I protest.Think how much this little jaunt is costing, he says bluntly.I ignore the fact that he calls my important business trip a little jaunt.We cant afford to just lose that money.Petal will be fine.How long does chicken pox last?A week?Ten days?Better check with Google again.Suppose its meningitis?I know Im probably fretting unnecessarily, but you hear so much about it now.And it always seems to be misdiagnosed.It isnt.Ill stake my life on it.This is a common childhood illness, Nell.Shell be over it by the time you get back.You see, shell be better by then.That doesnt make me feel better.Olly sighs with exasperation.What choice do we have?Hes right.At vast expense my train tickets are booked and my hotel too.Im not exhibiting out there, but its a fantastic opportunity to network, to show that I can play with the big boys.Ive only managed to secure a ticket, which are like gold dust, through Tods contacts.And hes probably wondering where the hell I am right now.Im supposed to be meeting him at St Pancras station and, knowing Tod, hell be there already.Hell be sitting in a coffee bar looking immaculate and unflustered with newspaper in hand, enjoying a leisurely cappuccino.He wont be dealing with impromptu puke and a severe attack of guilt.I cant not turn up today.It would certainly damage our working relationship if I left him in the lurch now.Tod, Im absolutely sure, wont understand that I cant bear to leave my sick child.These are not considerations that he has in his life.How can I let him down at the very last minute?Particularly when hes pulled so many strings to get me a ticket.But in not letting Tod down, Im letting Petal down.I feel as if Im being ripped in two.If you dont go now, youll have wasted the opportunity, Olly says.Just go.Hes right.I have to.Ill call you the minute I get there, I say.Ring the doctor as soon as the surgery opens.Tell him youre worried its meningitis.But Im not.Then tell him I am.Keep her cool with flannels.If it is chicken pox, dont let her pick any of the scabs when they start to form or shell get scars.I think of how my mum was when I had chicken pox  sitting with me all day long, spooning me homemade soup.Thats the sort of mum I wanted to be.Not the sort whos halfway out the door with a suitcase, glibly throwing out not picking scabs advice.Guilt stricken, I go to kiss Petal but Olly holds up a hand.Dont kiss her, he says.You dont want to spread this around the supermodels.Mummy loves you, I say.Ill be back soon.I look at Olly and his face is dark with concern.I dont want to leave him either.See you next weekend, my husband says with a resigned shrug.Ill be thinking of you both every minute, I promise.His face says that he doubts it.I fly out the door, picking up my case as I go.Its filled with sample handbags for me to show to people if I get the opportunity and it weighs a ton.By the time I get to the front door, Im already out of puff and sweating.I run barefoot to the station, shoes in hand, coat streaming, fully loaded wheelie case banging along behind me.Is this how women in business are supposed to behave?Can you see Anna Wintour doing this?She probably has a host of minions to live the boring bits of her life for her.She probably has chauffeur driven cars and private jets.How does everyone else who runs a company manage to keep all of these balls in the air?I make the Hitchin train by the skin of my teeth and then text Tod to tell him that Im running late and that if Im not there by the time he needs to clear security, then Ill meet him on the Eurostar.I hope.Thankfully, my train is on time and a short while later, Im racing through the concourse at St Pancras, red in the face and perspiring profusely.This is not the image I ever envisaged for myself.The restaurants are brimming with people enjoying a leisurely breakfast, a chocolaty snack or a nice cup of tea.Oh, to be one of them!My stomach growls in protest to remind me that I havent eaten at all this morning.But theres no time to stop now.Ill have to grab something extortionately priced on the train.Im held up at the security screening for the Eurostar as the guard wants to examine all of my handbags in minute detail as theyve clearly shown up on the scanner as something highly suspicious.If a terrorist was going to make a bomb, would they really do it in the shape of a handbag?I dont voice this opinion just in case he decides to clap me in irons and throw me in jail.The clock ticks on relentlessly.When he finally deigns to let me through, I bolt to the gate.Upstairs on the concourse, people, even at this early hour, are sitting at the champagne bar enjoying a convivial glass or two of fizz.How do they do it?How does everyone else seem to run their lives better than I do?As the guard is blowing the whistle, I throw myself on the train.Then, as it pulls away, I set about the task of finding my allocated seat.Three compartments along, I see Tod sitting there, reading the Guardian, sipping a latte in an oasis of calm.I throw myself into the seat opposite him, wheezing like an old steam train while the sleek, modern Eurostar slips silently towards France.Tod looks up in surprise.Nell?His face brightens and Im so grateful for that.I didnt think you were going to make it.Me neither, I think.But what I puff out is, Cant speak.Cant speak.Is everything all right?Tod takes my hands in his.Then I cry and cry and cry.I cry all the way through the Kent countryside.I cry as we whizz through the pitch blackness of the tunnel.And I cry until we emerge into the peace of the rural French countryside and were well on our way to Paris.49      Tod and I take a taxi from the Gare du Nord terminal.Impressively, Tod rattles off where were going in French to the driver.Ive never been here before.Ive never travelled much at all, unless you count a couple of weeks in Majorca every few years when the need for some sunshine became too desperate.And Olly and I havent even been able to do that since Petal came along.Im glad that Im here with Tod so that he can show me the ropes, as I might not have had the nerve to come on my own.I guess if hes got a house in France  he did tell me where, but it meant nothing to me  then hes probably been over here quite a lot.The sun is shining and I know that Paris in the springtime is something special to write about, but summer doesnt seem too shabby either.Its an amazing city and I think that at any time of year, it would look absolutely stunning to me.We pass the Eiffel Tower and I gaze longingly at it.I dont know if Ill get the chance to visit it on this trip, but its apparent that we have no time to linger now.So the sights of Paris whizz by the window and I can only press my nose against it.As soon as we reach our destination, Tod and I throw our cases into the quaint, little backstreet hotel that hes booked for us.Oblivious to the cost of international calls, I phone home.Hows Petal?Shes fine.Shes stopped barfing now and is asleep.Is she asleep or unconscious?I want to know.Asleep, Nell.Ive got it all under control.Stop panicking.Ollys calm reassurance does help turn down my stress levels down a notch.I know that he can manage without me and that should make me feel better than it does.I love you, I say.Ill call later.Have to dash.I hang up.Then, without further ado, Tod and I jump into another taxi and rush headlong to the first event to which weve been invited.Its a trade reception for the up and coming designer, Freya, whos the daughter of well known rock star, Tommy Blood, and has a huge budget behind her.I hate her already.The reception is being held in the small and indecently trendy Galerie dart Claude.Outside, bright young things in eye catching clothing hang around just waiting for someone to take pity on them and slip them a spare invitation.To think that, but for Tod, I could have easily been one of them.Inside the inner sanctum, its all white and classy.A crush of beautiful people mingle, talking loudly, sipping cocktails.I recognise the rock stars daughter from across the room.Freyas laughing and being sparkling.A photographer is following her every move.Bet she didnt have to cope with a puking, chicken poxed, borderline meningitised child at dawn.OK?Tod asks.I want to tell him that Im fine, that this is all old hat to me now  but he and I both know that this sort of thing doesnt come easily to me.Ive discovered that Im not a natural mingler.When I was working in the chippy, I was somehow able to be gregarious and knew all of the regular customers by name.That was fine.Perhaps I felt I was on a level with them.I have no idea.Here, I know no one and feel hideously out of my depth.They all seem to be so superior to me, so much wealthier, so much cooler.I wish I didnt have the tendency to turn into a wallflower, but I do.As usual, I attach myself to Tod like a limpet.Ridiculously thin models, with hair piled high and eye make up like carnival masques, work their way through the crowd, showing the designers clothes, turning this way and that.Across the room, much to my surprise, I see someone who I recognise instantly.Hes leaning against the wall, foot up on the pristine white paintwork.Hes dressed in a smooth grey suit and white shirt and looks every bit as handsome as I remember.I tug at Tods sleeve, just like Petal does to mine.Its Yves, I whisper to him.Yves Simoneaux.The French agent I told you about.The somewhat elusive French agent.I didnt know that he was going to be here, not just at this event, but at the show in general.But perhaps I should have guessed as its on his home turf.Tod rubs his chin.I dont know him, he says.Not a face Ive seen around.But there are dozens of agents out there and Im a bit out of touch on that side.I realise that I didnt ask much about his background.Maybe I should have.Give me a fancy business card and I go all gaga.Ill ask around about him.He seems nice, I say somewhat lamely.I should go and say hello.Of course you should, Tod agrees.Come with me?Im just going to catch up with a few people I do know and then Ill follow you.Ill literally be five minutes.OK.Sometimes Ill have to do things without hanging onto Tod, I guess.Nervously, I pick my way through the crush of people to where Yves is standing and then sidle up to him.Hes holding court in a circle of chic hangers on and when theres a gap in the conversation, I give a little cough.Yves turns towards me and his eyes widen.Nell, he says.How lovely.I did not expect that you would be here.I think that if perhaps he ever answered his phone calls or his emails, then he might have done so.Although, to be fair, I didnt contact him to say Id be here.I thought that as an agent and designer wed be more in touch than we are.He takes my hand and kisses it.An impossibly slender woman with scarlet lips, her dark hair pulled back in a knot and wearing a long white dress, looks me up and down.Then he turns back to his circle and says, This is Nell McNamara.Her handbags are sensationnel.He and the woman in white exchange a glance that I cant read.Perhaps this is Mrs Simoneaux.If it is, then Im not introduced.You are exhibiting here, non?No, I say.Surely I would have involved him if I was?The thought doesnt seem to cross his mind.Im here with a friend whos in the trade, Tod Urban.Its clear that Yves Simoneaux doesnt recognise his name either.I point out Tod across the room.Just looking this time.Seeing what the competition is like.It is a good thing to do.We can meet up, perhaps.Make some good contacts.Id like that.Yvess entourage gradually start to drift away, the woman last of all, heading off to work the room until there are just the two of us left.Your friend?Yves asks.He is a very good friend?Hes my business mentor, I explain, wondering just what Yves is insinuating.Hes been in the industry a long time.Ah.He narrows his eyes and, across the room, studies Tod some more.Then, How is your lovely little girl?Shes not very well, I tell him.I felt terrible leaving her to come here.Ah.He shrugs.This is the way of the working mother, yes?Yes, I agree.I think it is.Do you have children?No.He laughs.I do not have a wife!More laughing and those eyes tease me.I like living, how do you say, the single life?Yes, Im sure you do, Monsieur Simoneaux.There are probably a string of broken hearted mesdemoiselles, and possibly mesdames, across Paris pining for you.I must go now, Yves says, checking his watch.Where are you staying?May I call at your hotel later?Yes, I say.Of course.Id like to talk about the business with you.He smiles.I will tell you of my progress.Oh.There is some, then.Good.I like the sound of this.Id picked up some cards with the hotel address on from the desk in reception in case I got separated from Tod and wasnt able to make myself understood in a cab.I fish for one in my pocket and then hand it to Yves.His eyes lock with mine.Until later.Later, I say and then my heart goes all fluttery and I know that Im going to panic for the rest of the day.50      Tod and I spend all afternoon going to catwalk shows.One is for clothes by a designer called Isabel Green, the others are for accessories  hats, shoes  and one show is entirely devoted to handbags.I come away both inspired and terrified by the competition.These people seriously look like they know what theyre doing.They dont look like they live handto mouth in a flat above a shop in a small, middle England market town.They look like they have bijou apartments overlooking Montmartre or somewhere fabulously ritzy, if that isnt.Later, Tod and I grab a passable boeuf bourguignon and a glass of red wine from the prix fixe menu at a little brasserie near the hotel.If Tod was ever to be on Mastermind, Im thinking his specialist subject could be Rather Romantic Restaurants of the World.Have you enjoyed your day?he asks Amazing.I try to stifle a yawn.I feel as if Ive been awake for days.Grab an early night, he instructs.Tomorrow will be just as busy.I said Id meet with Yves Simoneaux at the hotel.Hes going to update me on his progress.Want me to stay with you?I know that Tod really wants to go back to the evening show of someone he worked with years ago thats close by.No, no.Ill be fine.You go off to the show.Are you sure?I nod.Just be careful, Tod says.Remember youre an innocent abroad.Literally.He seems OK, I reassure him, but I wonder if theres some underlying jealousy there.Secretly  or perhaps not so secretly  I think Tod likes to be the expert in my life.Ill fill you in tomorrow.Lets meet for breakfast at eight sharp, he says.The first show is at ten.He pays the bill and stands to leave.Sure youre OK?Fine.Really.When he leaves, to prove that I am OK, I order another glass of wine and stay in the bistro, drinking in the atmosphere and trying not to feel too self conscious.At eight oclock, I make my way back to the hotel across the street.Has anyone called for me?Non, madam, the receptionist tells me.Im expecting a Mr Yves Simoneaux.She shrugs her disinterest, so I take the open, wrought iron and very rickety lift up to the third floor and let myself into my room.I wonder if everything in Paris is stylish as even on a budget, this has a certain charm.The room is small, but has large French windows and a Juliet balcony, which looks out on to the bustling street below.The bed is big and the room is decorated in white with lime green and lemon soft furnishings.In one corner is a wooden stepladder painted white in a designer distressed way, which displays plants and pretty glass bottles.The original, claw footed bath looks very appealing.But I darent dive in, as Id like to, because I dont know what time Yves will be arriving and I dont want him catching me in the nuddy  or whatever the French equivalent is.Instead, I decide to give Olly a buzz again.As the phone rings, Im thinking grumpily that my bill for calls home will amount to more than the entire cost of the trip.Im even more disgruntled when Jenny answers my home phone with a chirpy, Hiya.Hi, Jen, I say.Everything OK?Everythings lovely, she replies.This is costing a fortune, I remind her and myself.Can you put Olly on, please?Hes just popped out for a takeaway for us, she says.He wont be long.A takeaway?I can feel my eyes narrowing.Why should that make me jealous?Because we have them on high days and holidays when Im at home, thats why.But I guess I can hardly complain when Im sitting in a chic Parisian hotel, running up a phone bill the size of the national debt.Petal, then, I try.Can I say good night to her?In bed, Jenny tells me.She was worn out, poor love.But she is OK?Dont worry yourself, Jen assures me.Olly and I are managing just fine.Theres something in her tone that niggles me.Can you let Olly know that Ill call tomorrow?Will do, she says brightly and then, before I know it, she hangs up.I sit and stare blankly at the phone.I imagine her sitting on my sofa, in my living room, with my husband, eating takeaway off my plates while my child sleeps in the next room and I dont like what Im picturing at all.After the phone call, I cant settle.I try to tell myself that my stomach is churning because Ive eaten too much but, if Im truthful, its other emotions that are making my tummy swirl.I trust Olly, of course I do.He would never do anything to hurt me.Or Petal.Im sure of it.Absolutely sure.But I feel as if Im handing him over on a plate to another woman and Im not happy about that at all.Someone else is sliding into my life while Im away and theres nothing I can do about it.I mooch around the room and try the television, but I cant find anything on thats not in French.Funny that.I check my watch.Nine oclock.Where is Yves?Kicking off my shoes, I plump up the pillows and lie back on the bed.To distract myself, I pick up my pad and start to sketch.Perhaps I could do some Parisian based designs and, as soon as I start, my head is buzzing with ideas.I rough out a fifties illustrated poodle design, a bag shaped like the Eiffel Tower and one that would have a typical Parisian flower shop frontage with a corsage on the corner.Might as well use my current surroundings to inspire my creativity.While Im lost in my work, I hear a knock and it takes me a while to realise that its at my door.When I check my watch, its nearly midnight and any hope of an early night has long gone.I jump up, thinking that it must be Tod coming back from his show, but when I throw open the door, Yves Simoneaux is standing there.Hey, he murmurs.Hes changed from when I saw him earlier today and is wearing a black leather jacket and jeans.His trademark white shirt is open at the neck.In his hand is a bottle of champagne and two glasses.He looks as if he may have been drinking already.I am late.I am sorry.It is a bit late now, I say and try to sound reproving.Id like to hear what Yves has to say about the business, but its a bit of a cheek turning up at this hour.I need my bed much more than I need champagne.But hes past me and into the room before I can say otherwise.The champagne cork is popped and the glasses full and I still havent spoken.Yves hands me a glass.Reluctantly, I take it.My day has been very good, he says.I have had many meetings about you.Good.I start to relax.It must be a very busy time for Yves and yet hes still made time to come and see me  a mere beginner, wet behind the ears.I must remember that, despite the lateness of the hour.Yves sits on the bed.His presence seems to take up more of the room than it should.The air in the room is stifling and I throw open the French windows and let in the breeze and the sounds of the night from the street.He flicks through my sketch pad.These are good.I shrug.I was just toying with a few ideas.Come, he says, sit with me.I notice a slight slur in his voice.Yves pats the bed next to him and, suddenly, I feel tired and alone and I dont want to be drinking champagne in a strange bedroom with a strange man.You know, I say.Its very, very late.I think you should simply bring me up to speed with what youve done to get me started in France and well call it a night.Yves does not look impressed by this idea.These things, they take time.He spreads his hands.You are not a person who is known.I thought it was his job to make me known.Have you managed to get me in any outlets, any boutiques?Anything at all?It will happen, Nell, he says.Be patient.My patience is actually running quite thin.Tod would know what to do.Hed know if this man is just spinning me a line.But then, I think Ive realised that myself.It isnt my fabulous charisma thats attracting all this attention.It seems that being a woman in business has you marked down as fair game.Well, not this one.In the meantime, we can have some fun, maybe.Fun?I laugh out loud and he looks taken aback.I dont want fun, Yves.I want a business.I want orders in Paris and Milan.So many of them that we can hardly cope.I want you to do your job.If youre not doing that, then I need to find another agent.Come on, baby, he says, smarmy smile on his face.Loosen up.Baby?Did he really just have the gall to call me baby?I lean on the balcony rail and breathe in the coolness to try to calm me down.When I feel steadier, I turn to him, Id like you to leave now.His face darkens.I do not think that you mean that.I march to the door and open it.I assure you, I do.Please leave now.At that, he stands up and knocks back his champagne.I am sorry that this is the way you feel, Nell.You make a big mistake.Then I panic that Ive been too hasty.Perhaps hes just drunk and doesnt really realise what hes saying.Maybe he is a good agent.I dont know.I have nothing to compare him to.What if another agent wont take me on?What if this is my only chance of breaking into France?Im sorry, Yves.Its late.Well speak again.Lets meet up tomorrow.Tomorrow, I am busy.I think this is it.I have to accept that Yves and I are going to part company.I had such high hopes, but it seems that my handbags wont be gracing the arms of the ladies of France after all.I will wish you good night, Yves says crisply, and good luck for your future.Without further ado, he leaves.I lean against the door and sigh to myself.If it wasnt so late, Id go and knock on Tods room and tell him what happened.Instead, I slump into the one armchair and go over our last conversation in my mind again.I come to the decision that he really was out of order.It wasnt me.As Yves has left his champagne behind, I pour myself another glass, even though I dont want it.I sit and sip it but, minutes after I do, my eyes start to grow heavy and I abandon it.What a waste.Still, tomorrow is another day and Ill have to see if I can repair the damage done.Perhaps Tod will know another agent I can approach.Hauling myself out of the chair, I strip off my shirt.My head feels all swimmy and my limbs have suddenly gone heavy.Then, through the haze, I notice that my sketch pad isnt on the bed any more.I force myself to stay awake and scour the floor.I look under the bed.I lift the pillows and check there.Its definitely missing.Then it strikes me.This has happened before.Didnt some of my designs go walk about when Yves came to my shop?But, dizziness washes over me and sleep overwhelms me and its too late for me to do anything about it.51      The next day, I meet Tod for breakfast in the tiny courtyard garden of the hotel.The birds are singing, the sun is shining, the smell of fresh croissants wafts out from the kitchen and I feel like shite.Tod stands when he sees me.Wow, he says.Heavy night?No, I say.Not really.Thats the strange thing.I had two glasses of wine with dinner, then I had a glass of champagne with Yves and barely started one more after he left.Im not exactly a big drinker, but does that constitute a heavy night?Does it warrant me feeling so truly terrible?I actually feel like Ive been drugged.My head is banging and my mouth is as dry as dust.Then the thought goes through my fuggy brain  what if I have been drugged?Should I voice my suspicions to Tod?What if Yves had slipped something in my drink?It isnt entirely beyond the realms of possibility, I think.It happens.At least, Ive read about it happening to other people.Or am I just being ridiculously paranoid?I have to ask myself what exactly was I doing letting someone I hardly know into my room at all.It also freaks me out to think that Yves might have helped himself to my designs.Not once, but twice.Though, perhaps, I should count my blessings that I gave him short shrift and that was all he was able to help himself to.God, I feel so stupid.Tod pulls out my chair for me and, gingerly, I sit down.Are you sure youre OK?No.I decide that honesty is the best policy.Im not that great.I might even want to be sick.Instead, I put my head in my hands and Tod pours me a glass of water.I gulp it down gratefully.Yves came to my room last night.Late.He brought champagne.Tods face tells me that he doesnt like the way this is going.I cant say that I blame him.I dont know if it was drugged, I confess.I certainly feel more awful than I should do after a few glasses of plonk.Drugged?Tods face blanches.He didnt ?No.I shake my head.When it became clear he wasnt there primarily to talk about work, I told him to leave.He did.Thank heavens for that.Exactly.I let out a shuddering breath.But I think he took some of my designs with him.Tods face darkens.I dont think its the first time.Oh, Nell.Taking a deep breath, I plough on.Tod might as well know everything.When he came to see me in Hitchin a few months ago, Im pretty sure that he took some of my new sketches with him then.I cant believe what a fool Ive been.But I never expected anyone to do something like that?Why should I?I never suspected him at all at the time, I admit.I just thought Id misplaced them.Or Petal had binned them.Or something.I think your nature may be too trusting for the cut and thrust of business.Im beginning to see that.I asked around about him last night, Nell, but no one seemed to know who he was.I guess that shouldnt surprise me.I feel such a fool.Tod tuts.I should never have left you alone with him.This is my fault.Its mine, I counter.I should have made sure I checked him out more thoroughly.And hadnt simply agreed to everything because I was blinded by his flattery.Stupid, stupid me.The waitress brings us fresh coffee, so strong and black that it will either kill me or cure me.She also puts down a basket of croissants and a dish of creamy butter.My stomach rolls.Eat, Tod instructs.We have a busy day ahead of us.I can hardly bear the thought of it.I want to go home.I want to run back to Olly and Petal.I want to be with people who love me and dont want to do bad things to me.We are going to track that man down, Tod informs me as he tucks in.Whoever he is.We are?He whips out his programme like its a weapon of mass destruction and, while I force myself to nibble at a croissant, he trawls through the listings.Right, he announces eventually.Ive got some shows marked down where he might be.Up for this, Nell?Yes.Tod fixes me with a gaze.I dont want to find him only for you to go all nice on me.No, I agree.I can do not nice.Excellent.Then lets go and get the bastard.Couldnt have put it better myself.52      I see the Louvre from another taxi window, and then Tod and I go to three different shows back to back on the hunt for Monsieur Yves Slippery Simoneaux.We see some nice stuff, but not the elusive trickster/agent.The last show of the morning is for a new accessories designer, Marie Monique, and Tod reckons that this might well be a good place for Yves to rock up.I sincerely hope so.This venue looks like a disused factory and is called Espace Blanc.Inside, its all industrial with concrete floors and exposed pipework.A central, galvanised steel staircase comes down from a gallery to join a runway thats flanked by rows of chairs.Its sparsely populated, at the moment, but filling up fast.Tod and I take the last remaining seats in the front row at the head of the runway.Despite the soothing music, a prickle of apprehension runs through me.Sensing my discomfort, Tod says, OK?Yeah, I say.I dont know whats wrong.I just feel a bit funny.Not sick?No.Something like a sixth sense.Yves will be here.I know it.I can feel it in my bones, in my water, in the hairs on the back of my neck.Scanning the rows though, I cant see him anywhere.Five minutes later and the music racks up several notches, announcing the start of the show.The chill out sound of Groove Armadas mellow song At the River fills the room.The models high step down the staircase, a precarious move in canvas sandals with towering wedge heels.Theyre dressed only in white skimpy bikinis and floppy hats and wear brightly coloured beach bags in different styles slung across their bodies to sit low on their hips.Nice, Tod whispers to me.I cant argue with that.But Im distracted and cant help but keep looking round in search of the elusive Mr Simoneaux.The mood changes and a drum and bass version of Puttin on the Ritz pumps out.The models wear red playsuits and black stilettos.The handbags are glittering silver box shapes with red satin hearts attached.Cute.The music changes tempo again and its M People singing Itchycoo Park.This time the models are dressed all in white with cropped T shirts, pedal pushers and ballet flats.As they hit the runway in front of us, my heart stops, my limbs freeze and my eyes pop.I cant believe what Im seeing.Or maybe I can.The handbags that the models are wearing are as familiar as the freckles on my childs face.These are my handbags.The ones that I had sketched out when I was in my shop in Hitchin.The ones with the pop art inspired, psychedelic designs.The ones that Yves Simoneaux had lifted, just as I suspected.Tod turns to me instantly.I nod.Theyre mine.You dont need to tell me.Id recognise them anywhere, he says.I knew that it was bad.But I had no idea quite how bad.That slimy French bastard has stolen your designs.He has.My God, he has.I dont know what I thought he was going to do with them, but I hadnt, in my worst nightmare, thought that he would do this.Tod and I sit there mesmerised as my nicked handbag designs are paraded before our eyes.The applause is louder than for any other part of the collection and thats with two people not clapping at all.What can I do?I whisper to Tod.This is a nightmare, he hisses back.We can try to make a legal case against him, but it will be long and lengthy.Not to mention expensive, I suspect.How can you prove the designs were yours, Nell, if you dont have any record of them?Bloody hell.All I had was my original sketches.Yves knew exactly what he was doing, the sleazebag.He knew I was green and keen.It must have been like taking candy from a baby.But theyre mine, I say, sounding exactly like Petal would.Theyre mine.The people are going crazy for them and theyre mine.Dont worry, Tod says, looking worried.Well think of something.But we stay pinned in our seats, immobile and watch the models strut with goggle eyes.The show finishes and still Tod and I dont move.At the end of the last catwalk run, as is customary, the models escort the designer to the front for them to take their bow from the audience.From the gallery above us, Marie Monique appears and Id recognise her anywhere too.Its the woman in white who was at the gallery show yesterday  with Yves Simoneaux.Shes dressed all in white again today.A bodycon dress teamed with killer heels.Her hair is in a long, black plait.The woman who is passing off my handbags as her own designs struts up to just beside us.Shes wearing one over her shoulder, dangling it in my face.She looks serene, sophisticated, a woman used to adulation.A battery of cameras flash.Striking a pose like a seasoned model, she takes her applause, basking in the praise and the cornucopia of cameras capture the moment.My anger is boiling away inside me.A red rage is rising that I didnt know I was capable of.Marie Monique turns and smiles.She holds out her hands and from the side of the stage, at the back of the audience, Yves Simoneaux steps up onto the runway and takes her into his arms.They kiss each other warmly.The applause doubles.The cameras flash again.Looks like they are rather well acquainted and are, more than likely, in this together.Well grab him as soon as theyre off that runway, Tod says through gritted teeth.Though goodness only knows what we can do.Ive a good mind to knock that slimy bastard to the floor.Something inside me cracks.Where there was rage there is now a cool calm.Im out of my seat and on to the runway before I know what Im doing.These are my handbags, I say in a very loud, clear voice.Theyre my designs.And youve stolen them.The cameras flash.Theres a collective gasp from the audience.Maries face blackens instantly.Go away, she spits.Go away.I do not know who you are.Maybe not, I say.But he does.Yves has the grace to look panic stricken.Nell, he says in a placating tone.There is a mistake.We can sort this out.A reporter pushes a microphone close to us and more cameras move in.Theyre my bags, I repeat more firmly and I hear it reverberate round the busy hall.I dont sound unhinged or hysterical.I simply sound like a woman who knows shes been wronged.You both know that they are.Marie pushes me.She pushes me in the chest.Get out of here, she says.Get out of my show.She goes to turn away, to dismiss me as irrelevant, and the red mist descends on me once more.I grab the bag on her shoulder and she pushes me again.As I snatch it from her, she swings round and tries to claw my face, spitting insults in French.She punches me in the eye, which hurts like hell, but still I hang on.Then, while she is screaming obscenities, I take aim and thwack her one back with my rescued handbag.It hits her with a resounding thud.A volley of camera flashes follow the action.This is my handbag, I say again.Im Nell McNamara and this is my handbag.Marie, not looking so serene or sophisticated now, makes a lunge for me, but I sidestep her and somehow grab her long, luxurious plait.It takes me back to the playground when I swing her round by it and, I have to say, it feels great.She topples off her stilettos and falls to the floor.Yves swoops in to help her.Marie lies cowering beneath him.Youll stop making those handbags right now, I say, wagging my finger in her face.And you, you swindling bastard, youll be hearing from my lawyer.Said with the bravado of a woman who doesnt actually have a lawyer or the wherewithal to pay for one.Then Tod is beside me leading me off the runway.Marie, still on floor, is swamped by reporters.Whoa!Tod says as we move away from the commotion on stage.That wasnt too nice, was it?Tod laughs.That wasnt nice at all.Lets hope she doesnt sue you for assault and battery with a handbag.Let her try.Now all the cameras are focused on me.Im breathing heavily, but I feel powerful, victorious.The journalists swarm towards me.Its my bag, I say to no one in particular and I see a dozen pens scribble it down.Marie Monique has stolen my designs.Just in case anyone didnt catch that.Your name?someone shouts.What is your name?Nell McNamara, I reply.Tod leads me outside.Youll be all over the trade papers, he says.Theres no such thing as bad publicity, I remind him.I can only hope that Im right.53      Olly kissed Petal gently.Its late.You should be asleep, young lady.Im trying, she replied.But its not that easy, Daddy.Tucking her myriad toys around her, he said, Well, Im going to work now, so you be a good girl for Jenny.Dont play up.He got her whatever face in return for that.The minute he turned his back, shed be up.That and the Pope being Catholic were two certainties in life.Back in the living room, Jen was watching television.Her feet were up on the sofa.There was a glass of wine in front of her on the coffee table and she was watching some costume drama.She looked very at home.When he closed the door to Petals bedroom, she looked up at him and smiled.It was a very cosy routine that theyd fitted into.Jen was easy company.A bit like Petal in a way.So long as she was warm, fed and watered and there was a modicum of entertainment to amuse her, she wanted for little else.It was nice having her around.She made no demands on him.Didnt criticise his every move, question his every motive and he was quite worried that he felt like that.Id better be off, he said.It was so tempting to phone in sick  something he never did  and spend the night at home instead.That was all he wanted.A cosy home, someone to share it with.Instead his wife was off in Paris trying to make her fortune, turning their lives upside down, when really it had been quite pleasant as it was before.Jenny pulled a little face.Gonna miss you, she said.Yeah.Theyd fallen into a simple, domestic routine of bathing Petal and putting her to bed together, then Jenny would rustle them up some dinner.Hed expected not to see much of her due to her shifts at Live and Let Fry, but shed taken the whole week off as holiday so that she could be around for them both.It was very touching.Surprisingly, he found out that they had a lot in common.They liked the same food, the same films, the same comedians.The only thing Jen didnt share was his love of all things sixties, but he was trying to educate her and she seemed to be a willing pupil.In fact, theyd laughed a lot across the dinner table and hadnt talked about handbags or business once.He couldnt remember the last time he and Nell had done that.Olly sighed inwardly.Tonight, hed rather have his own eyeballs grated than go and stand for eight hours making pizzas.He might insist to Nell that he was happy in his work, but it wasnt all true.He liked the people.The pay was reasonable.But no one in their right mind could truly say that theyd found satisfaction in doing something so crushingly boring for the rest of their lives.Picking up his coat, he shrugged it on and then bent forward to peck Jen on the cheek.As he did, she turned her head away from the television and their lips met.He tried to pull back, but Jen took hold of the lapel of his jacket and held him firm.Her lips were warm and soft against his, full, inviting.The temptation to stay there and enjoy the sensation was over whelming.The tip of her tongue slipped into his mouth and found his.It frightened him to think that he could easily stay here, throw off his coat, throw off his clothes, throw caution to the wind and make love to Jen.It would be so easy, so very easy.Only the thought of Petal just down the hall prevented him from doing so.The thought of Petal.
