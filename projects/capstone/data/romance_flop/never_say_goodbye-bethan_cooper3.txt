Dont let him see you cry.Ella, thats all lies.His voice is comforting and warm.He puts his hand on my back.I lift my head to meet his and stand up.Erm, really?You think Im an idiot, Luke?She knew intimate details and you phoned her while she was talking to me.I havent spoken to Sarah since we broke up last year.He says, deadpanned.Luke, I dont want to be mind fucked.I dont want all of this drama.We have only known each other really since Friday.It's now Monday.This is crazy.My voice is close to a whisper.Im sorry I have so much baggage, Ella.He looks down to the floor and again raises his head to meet my gaze.You dont have baggage, Luke, we have known each other a few minutes.We need to start again.Hi, Luke, my name is Ella; Lets go to dinner?Ill pay?I watch him study me as I stumble around my room trying to find my piggy bank.Ella, you are not paying for dinner on our first date.He walks over to me, my back to his front, and I freeze.His hot breath teases my neck; it makes a shiver run the length of my spine.Right now, Ella, all Im interested in is knowing you, and getting to know the girl who I havent stopped thinking about all day, Sarah is wrong.I havent seen her in a long time.She is only interested in getting me back.She stalks me.Luke, prove to me you want me.He kisses the back of my neck and his fingers gently tease my skin at the bottom of my spine.I needed to see what I meant to him.What he wanted from me.I turn slowly to see him look down at me.His fingers slightly graze the side of my cheek and he tilts his head to mine.As he kisses me gently, my whole body surrenders to him.His lips caress mine, marking me, wanting me.We lose ourselves, our tongues locking and twisting, dancing with each other.He bites my bottom lip and I let out a groan that Ive heard before.My desire for this man is unbelievable.I return the favor and play with his lip.He pushes me hard against the wall, with his mouth on my neck, across my chest, and back up to my lips.We eat at each other, groaning with sexual desire and need; the lust for each other is incredible.I feel it.Five      This is bad.I whisper against his lips.Then why does it feel good?He smiles, keeping his mouth close to mine.Lets go out, Luke, before we make this worse and end up somewhere where I just cant be yet.I smile.He tucks a loose strand of hair behind my ear and smiles softly at me.Where do you wanna go?He asks and gives me a small wink.I dont know, I dont go out much.Ive never been bowling, havent even seen a movie recently.Ive missed out on a lot.His hands still cup my face and he plants a sweet, gentle kiss on the corner of my mouth.I was hoping you would say that.Ill teach you what it means to live.He whispers before gently grabbing my hand and weaving his fingers between mine.******    He holds the door open for me as we enter the coolest diner I have ever been to.With typical American decor, the walls are covered in Hollywood legends and the booths are a light blue with 1950s dining tables in front of them.It feels homey and sweet.I feel anxious but I push it to the back of my mind and concentrate on the now.This is a real first date with a real person who wants to know me.Wow.The waitress greets us and we follow her to a cozy booth for two.My names Hillary guys, so if you need me please shout.She smiles an all American smile and wanders off.Luke places his hand over mine and just holds it.I immediately feel nervous as hell.My mind wanders into thinking about what we could become.I want to be his best friend, his family, his life.I want to be with him, create love with him, follow his guidance, and let him fall in love with me.All I want again is to feel love, to feel its meaning, its purpose in our lives.I want to find all those things with him and feel all those things with him.But shes still there, niggling in the back of my mind.Telling me that they fucked before he kissed me and made me fall for him.It made me feel physically sick to think of it in that way.I push that thought out of my head.I am on a date with Luke.One of the most sought after boys in school.I smiled at my thoughts and looked down at my hands.He still has his hand on mine as we look through the diner menu.I immediately feel relaxed.We are finally going to be able to talk.Just for the sheer hell of it.I want to become best friends with him, I want him to be the only person in my life that I can rely on, that will always catch me when I fall.What are you thinking?He asks and tilted his head to the side.He looks adorable and ridiculously sexy.As always.Um....Just how lucky I feel to be here right now.Luke, there are many things we need to talk about.I mean, I havent had an easy couple of years   as Im sure you are well aware of, but I dont want to burden you, or drive you away.You know a lot about me already and Im sure that must scare you.It scares me.He shakes his head and his eyes look deep into mine.Ella, honestly, you seem to be okay to me right now, and in this moment, thats all I care about.I want to help you.We need to build on this relationship, I'm going to learn your flaws, and youre going to learn mine.That's just the way it works.His thumb strokes along my knuckles, such a welcome gesture that makes me feel secure.But Im so high maintenance right now, I dont even know what Im doing half of the time.I protest.Thats fine, Ella.I want you  Were interrupted by a waitress coming for our order.Mind if I order for you?Luke says, smiling.No, thats fine, go for it.I wink at him.Can we get a starter of nachos to share please, then for mains  2 two cheeseburgers with sweet potato fries and 2 two thick vanilla shakes.Yeah, sure guys, anything else?She beams at us.No, thats fine, Hillary, thank you.Ooh, first name basis.He smiles at her and I swear that I see her knees give way beneath her.Hands off missy.I give her a stare and squint my eyes as I watch her beautifully shaped body walk away.Ella, stop it.Luke starts to laugh hard.What?I shrug and give him a smile.Who knew you were a green eyed beauty, huh?He asks with a smile that makes me melt inside and outside.I just want to kiss his beautifully shaped mouth.I bite down on my lip and watch him smile at me.What?He asks as he stops my hand from fiddling with a napkin.Nothing.I murmur.No, tell me, Ella.He orders and the words come from my mouth before I could stop them.I was just thinking that you are sexy.I shrug and he pulls my chin so my lip comes free from my teeth.He and I both laugh with such a beautiful demeanor and it feels so perfect.Oh, and as you ordered for me   it sounds mouth watering, but if my burger has tomato on it Im throwing it at you.Tomato is the devil, its disgusting.I pull a sour face and he laughs at me.Our milkshakes arrive and they are to die for.The creaminess and texture is just beautiful.Luke, these are amazing.I let out an appreciative groan as I suck on my straw.Where did you find this place?Its family run, I come here with the guys sometimes and my family.Its one of my favorite places.Our nachos arrive and we chat and laugh throughout dinner.He tells me secrets about some of the boys at school who have always claimed they are masters of sex when secretly they have no idea.He tells me about his life ambitions and his already building business with his father.He tells me about how he wants to find love with someone who will feel the same feelings and opinions as him.Someone that wants to be romantic and feel love with him.Throughout this part of the conversation my cheeks are flushed with a pinky glow and Im sure he notices.Im so embarrassing.We talk about family, friends, and each other.I feel a connection with Luke, like Ive known him my whole life, not four days.Just as we order dessert, Luke's phone rings.He excuses himself and goes outside.I sit and think about love and how it could happen to me, and why no demons have harassed my head about it today.Maybe its just meant to be.As my thoughts wandered, my phone buzzes.A text from a number I didnt know.*U R so stupid, he is clearly on the phone 2 me.*  There is only one person who that could be from, so where the fuck is she?She is here somewhere.She has to be.She's watching us.I started to look around to see if I could see anything, but my seat was in a really awkward place to see anyone else.I lean over and looked towards the front door but there was nothing.I started playing with my napkin again.I dont know what it is about her that scares me, but it does.It terrifies me.As my anxiety comes rushing back, my phone buzzes again.*Its all about me, Ella.Not u so just go away and let us love each other*  All of a sudden, I feel anger.I wanted to get to her and explain that I wasnt scared of her.He was on a date with me, not her, so I need to ask why.I dont want this.I need to run, get home.But at the same time, I dont want to leave Luke here with that crazy stupid ex of his.No, fuck this; Im going to stay.She isnt going to scare me away.Not again.I grab my bag from the seat next to me and get $50 out of my purse.I guess I am paying for dinner.I had no idea what the check came to but its all the money I have until my next job comes along.I run to the door and I can see Luke laughing and joking through the glass.I turn to a waitress.Hi, I was sitting at the table over there, I have left some money, and we dont need our desserts now, thank you though.She looked at me puzzled.Sorry, miss, but weren't you with Luke?I'll put your desserts in a take away box.Yes, and okay, if it isn't a problem?I answer, distracted.You dont need to pay, honey.She smiles at me.Oh, why not?I look at her puzzled.This is Lukes parents restaurant, go get your money sweetie.I walk back over to the table and pick up the $50 I had just chucked on it.Its his families restaurant?Why the secret?I go to open the door and waved goodbye to the very informative waitress.As she hands me our desserts, I slip her $10 and she winks at me as I leave.Lukes still talking when I go over to join him.His back is facing me.He steps forward, away from me, and I step back.If he doesnt want me listening then maybe I shouldnt.I lean my back against the red brick wall and prop my right leg up against it.He turns and sees me, smiling a sweet shy smile that makes my knees weak.He wraps up his call quickly and walks over to me.I cant help but watch his body.It really is defined.Finish dessert without me?He asks with his head tilted to one side like an inquisitive little puppy dog.No.I say quietly holding up the bag and I roll my eyes.He smiles softly at me and mouths 'Yum. 'Um, Sarah texted me.His eyes open wide and he looks at me with a frown upon his face.How?He asks.I mean, she shouldnt even have your number, Ella.I dont know.See?I show him my phone and his mouth turns into a frown again.Are you sure this is Sarah?He asks.Well, no not really.No, but she is the only person who I have seen today and who has threatened me in the same sort of wording.Who else could it be?He looks around puzzled and shrugs it off.Whatever, let them believe whatever they want, Im with you arent I?He looks at me with a possessive and shy gaze.Come here.He whispers and pulls me into an unexpected embrace.I breathe him in as his arms snake around me, his head resting onto my shoulder.He smells beautiful, like body wash and fresh clothes.He pulls away slightly but keeps his arms firmly locked around me.He lifts my chin to meet his soft green eyes.He puts his lips against mine and electricity explodes throughout my veins.We kiss, our tongues exploring inside each others mouths.He breaks off, pushes my hair aside, and kisses my neck, I cant help but giggle.I try to get free but he pulls away and laughs.Ticklish?He asks, seduction caressing his tone.Maybe.I whisper.Shall we test my theory?He smiles and reaches for me, his hands looking to invade my body.No, please don't!I scream and laugh.I put my hands out in front of me to try to stop him.Of course its hopeless, he is all muscle.It starts a chase and we end up running around the front of the restaurant, him trying to catch me.He catches me, but instead of my expectant tickles, he lets my giggles subside and puts his hands on my waist, looking deep into my eyes, his knuckles grazing my cheek.It suddenly turns very serious.He pulls me close and kisses me again, deeply and passionately, like he's desperate for me.I moan as if I have a dosage of butterflies erupt in my body, taking over me.We should go to our first date, part two.He mutters between kisses.Theres a part two?I ask curiously.Yes, Ella, are you ready?He asks, studying my face.As Ill ever be.I beam at him.He looks at me and he wont let go as I try to break away.What?I ask smiling.Oh, Ella, you look so beautiful right now.He puts a lock of hair back in place behind my ear and kisses me sweetly.Where are we going?I ask.As we walk, our fingers are weaved and his thumb strokes backward and forwards over mine, it makes me feel safe with him.That would be telling.He looks down, winks at me, and I feel a blush sweep my face.I look up at him and gaze.His beauty is just overwhelming.His brown hair flops against his forehead almost touching his eyes.He is wearing a checked red shirt that is tucked into dark denim jeans and his outfit is finished with some black converse.They look brand new.Unlike mine, which are at least 5 five years old.We arrive at a car I dont recognize and I recover from my daydream.Where is the Mercedes?He walks around with me to the passenger door.This is your car?I ask puzzled.Its different to the other one.Well spotted, Ella.He laughs.Oh yeah thats it, make fun of me.He notices my blanched look and frowns.You are frustrating, lady.He smiles.Its a sports car, I know that at least.Its blue and has two white stripes that run from the trunk to the hood.Its beautiful, Im instantly jealous.This is my other car.I have three.He coughs and looks at me, looking for some kind of answer.Wow, thats quite an amount for an 18 year old.I joke.He smiles at me and his knuckles stroke my cheek.Its a Dodge Viper SRT10 convertible.He mumbles.Your family must be very rich.He shrugs and opens the door for me.Whoa.Its so low and comfortable!The seats feel like they should be in a racecar.I wonder if thats what this thing is.Either way, its absolutely outstanding compared to my little Mustang.Its interior is leather and matches the color of the outside.I put on my seatbelt and I sit with my hands in my lap, ready to test the intensity of this very expensive car.Did you pay for this car?I ask Luke as he buckles his seatbelt.Yes.He replies.How the hell?How?I ask, curious.It was half given to me; I personally paid $45,000 for the car.My dad paid the other $45,000.He puts the key in the ignition and the car roars to life.It sounds so sexy and seductive.I have to remind myself that its just a car.I pinch myself in case Im dreaming and Luke doesnt have this kind of money, or car, or looks!He is too good to be true.I look into the side mirror and see a figure move fast out of view but I ignore it.Ready?He asks with a huge grin on his face.As Ill ever be.I say, smiling   repeating my words from earlier.He reverses the car swiftly out of the parking spot, puts it into gear, and drives along the road away from uptown Charlotte.We casually sit in silence and I watch out the window at my lovely city.We are driving away from home and I become curious.I wait for about 10 minutes but then I notice a sign saying left for I 85.I look to my right to see what street we are on and its West Sugar Creek Road.I know now we are definitely heading for the interstate.Luke?I ask, a question upon my lips.Yes, baby?Whoa, baby?I instantly smile.Where are we going?I ask.Greensboro.He replies.A shy smile appears on his face and he puts his foot down as we make our entrance onto I 85.Six      We pull off I 85 and I admire the view of Greensboro, NC.I have never visited even though I have always lived so close.I pull out my cell from my jean pocket and see its 8:15pm.It took us just over an hour to get here.I also have 3 missed calls from my mom.I decide to text her.*Hi Mom, sorry I didnt answer.Im fine, I promise.Dont wait up.*    I smile as I hit send.Luke moves his hand over and squeezes my knee.Its welcoming and it causes a new, passionate feeling to uncurl in my stomach.I watch him drive, his hands look so masculine as he turns the steering wheel.Veins run through his arms and his hands, what is it about hands?He has a Cartier watch on.Cartier!His strong shoulders move and each individual muscle increases as it moves.He is so well looked after.I watch as he shakes his head to one side to move the hair from his face, as he indicates the car, as he changes gear.Everything is turning me on!What is wrong with me?I shake off the electricity and go back to city gazing.As Im lost in a daydream, I notice that we are parking.I look dead ahead and see NEWBRIDGE BANK PARK on the side of what looks like a stadium.Too late for a game, isnt it?As Luke parks, I watch his hands maneuver the car and I think Im drooling.He looks at me puzzled, and then smiles.He turns off the ignition after he parks it beautifully, and leaves his hands opposite each other on the wheel.His head is bowed, his eyes shut.Ella.He breathes.I have never brought a girl here.Its a baseball park if you were wondering.He looks up and at me with the smile that always takes my breath away.My family invested here so I can come and go as I please.I wanted to bring you here, maybe have a walk?Maybe a little game of baseball?He laughs and I join him.Reaching under his seat, he hands me a black box with a grey bow attached to the top.Leave this in the car.Dont open it until you get home.He whispers.Why do I have a present?I shake it and it makes a satisfying rattling noise.He leans over to tilt and turn my head away from my mysterious present.He gently kisses me.I let go; my hands work their way to his hair, my teeth biting his lip.A seductive moan comes from him and I smile beneath the kiss.This feels too good, Luke, I am so attracted to you.He smiles and goes instantly shy.I didn't expect that.Hard with compliments?I ask.Something like that.He replies and shrugs.He opens the driver's door to leave and I pull on my handle.Leave it.He warns.I instantly remove my hands and hold them up in protest.I watch as he walks round to the passenger door, opens it, and holds his hand out for me to take.Such a gentleman.I take it, reluctantly, and he helps me out of the car.He grabs the bag with the desserts in it out of the back and pulls me into an embrace, his face buried in my hair, and breathes me in.One second.He says, lifting his index finger and pulling away from me.He does a little jog back round to the drivers side and opens the door.He leans in and attaches something to the stereo.A familiar song fills my ears and he walks back round to me, his eyes never leaving mine as he holds out his hand.Dance with me.He whispers.What, here?I look around to see if anyone is watching.Yes here, now.I take his hand and he pulls me into him.My hand finds his shoulder and his is at the base of my spine.Our spare hands linked together.My head is just above his shoulder and he leans down and again, buries his face in my hair.You smell beautiful.He whispers as we slowly dance in the parking lot.I pull him closer.We are lost in a world of our own, dancing in the parking lot.I cant think of anything else more romantic.He is so perfect.So, how come he wants me?We have come so far in five days.Its crazy how quickly you can fall for someone.He dances so well.He is moving me and our feet are gently stepping around each other.The song finishes and he kisses me softly on the lips.After our romantic charade, he leads me into the grounds.There are giant baseballs all around and they look so unique for a stadium.It makes me feel proud.What baseball team plays here?I ask.Minor league, Greensboro Grasshoppers, theyre pretty good.He walks us into the center of the stadium and its so strange being on a field.I have seen hundreds of games, as my father is a huge fan, but Ive never been on a real field.This feels weird.I mutter as he walks out in front of me.Why?Im so used to being in the stands.I laugh and he smiles at me.Its cool right.He gives me a welcoming grin, opens his arms wide, and does a full circle.I forget how young he is.How young we both are.I feel so adult right now.So, youve never brought a girl out here, I have a present, and you forgot to tell me that your family owns the diner we ate at.I fold my arms in front of me, tapping my right foot.I pout.He looks at me and giggles.You look cute.No I dont.I look away and shrug.You do.He laughs.No....I dont!I yell.YOU DO!He shouts and runs toward me.I instantly start to retreat and run the opposite way.He chases me and catches me within seconds.He picks me up so I am higher than him, his hands just under my behind.He looks up at me and I lean down and kiss him.My hands are on either side of his face and I fall into him.He gently lowers me, our lips not leaving each others.You are adorable, Ella.He breathes as he releases me.Whats happening, Luke?I ask.Im falling for you.He whispers.Likewise.I whisper back.He picks me up and tosses me over his shoulder.Luke, what the hell!I scream but he takes no notice and we both laugh.He slaps my behind and I gasp.Ow, bully.I tease.Come on, you're putting me off where I want to take you, stop being distractive.With that, he carries me across the field toward the back of the stadium, with me rubbing my now red ass.When he puts me down, Im in a tree shaded area.Every tree is lit up; each individual branch has a stream of lights defining itself from the center of its life.I look around astounded at the beauty, mesmerized.You like it?He asks, looking for some appreciation.Luke, its beautiful.I look at him and he looks smug.Is it always like this here?My dad and I went to New York about two years ago.We went at Christmas.One night we decided to go for a walk through Central Park.Now you know Central Park, right?Its huge.I nod in agreement.Well every single tree at Christmas time has twinkling lights all up the branches and down the trunks.I thought it looked beautiful, unique.The amount of manpower that must have gone into that.So, when my dad helped out with this place, I noticed the back and decided to copy New Yorks idea.I wanted a safe place, so I made one.He smiles and looks at me.We are walking down a path that leads to a small river at the bottom.I sit at the riverbank and he sits next to me.We open up our desserts and pick at them with white plastic forks.Right now, at this exact moment, I am lost.I look down at the water and the lights reflect beautifully on its surface.Wow.I whisper.Thank you.For what?Being here for me.Ella, I dont understand.Dont worry, Luke, you werent meant to.His arm relaxed across my shoulder and we sit gazing, relaxed, and content.Tell me something about yourself, Ella.I want to know a secret.He tenses up after he asks.Sure.I reply and shrug.He immediately relaxes.What do you want to know?Why have you never tried at school?What do you mean?You never seemed to try, Ella, to fit in I mean.Oh, Luke.I sigh loudly and shake my head.School didnt accept me, not ever.Jade, my best friend has known me for at least twelve years.She has always been in my life so she didnt have a choice but to be my friend throughout everything.I have had such a rough couple of years.Problems with my family, with myself, and with other personal stuff.You dont have to tell me if you dont want to, Ella.Its not that, Luke; its not that at all.Ive never openly spoken about my private life.You know more than anyone already, you have um, seen me, yknow.He laughs.Yeah, yeah I have.He pulls me closer.I had someone in my life that loved me more than anything or anyone in his life.Oh, I didnt know you have had boyfriends before me.Um, not really, Jamie wasnt my boyfriend.He looks across at me, puzzled.Jamie was my best friend.We played together, we laughed together, and we loved each other.Jay had me in his life and thats all he needed.I can feel the tears building up, ready to explode at any given moment.Um...Ella, you dont have to tell me.He whispers and gently kisses my hair.Yeah, I do, otherwise you will never understand...Jay had Leukemia in its most violent and intrusive form.I swallow, trying to find my words.Um, we met when we were seven.His mom had chats and coffee with my mom and we would play silly games like Superman in the garden.I remember it was sunny the day my mom told me about his condition.I cried for him.I knew what cancer was when I was thirteen.He had it the whole time and I never knew.I shudder and wipe the tears away from my face.Luke turns to face me and helps me wipe my eyes.He um, told me when we were fourteen that he loved me.I was his best friend for life.I was the only person who didnt judge him for being bald, for being stick thin.We sat in his room for hours reading books to each other.His cough always frightened me because I knew he could go at any moment.I spent hours comforted by him and lying with him in his bed, talking about what we both wanted to do.Jay never kissed me.Hed just lay with me and hold my hand as wed stare at his bedroom ceiling.His body denied all the chemo, all the medicine.The day the doctor came over and told all of us that he didn't have long, that was when I became distant.I didnt want to see him.I didnt want to know.My depression started, literally just as he was leaving us.Every day I got angry.School was a nightmare; nobody even spoke to me or asked me what was wrong.Nobody.Luke, do you know how that feels?His hands hold either side of my face and he desperately tries to kiss the tears away.Youre doing great, Ella, youre talking to me.His thumb traces my lower lip and I lean into his hand on my cheek.It was December 2004.The 14th.I saw Jay's mom in the street, she ran up to me and slapped me so hard I nearly fell to the ground.I stroke my cheek at the memory.She shouted at me and told me I was worthless, that Jay deserved a friend better than me, but she didnt know, Luke, she didnt know about the times we sat in his bedroom talking about books and listening to each other.I was speechless in front of her, listening to her wicked words, rubbing them into my mind so I never forgot.I followed her home, and even when she tried to stop me from going into the house, I pushed my way through, and found Jay in his room playing on his Xbox.He turned and smiled at me and I sat beside him.I told him I was sorry.We sat for hours.I stayed the night on his bedroom floor and woke to a cold wintery December morning.The 15th.He wouldnt wake up.My words choke me.Ella, stop, I cant take that.Its fine, dont make me stop, I have never spoken about this before.I whisper and he nods.He died that night and I left the house broken, I just ran.I ran for such a long time, Luke.His mom blamed me for everything and that just made it worse.I saw him the night he was going to breathe his last breath, I saw him love me again, and he let me read to him.I read him Dr.Seuss, can you believe that?We used to read Hemingway and Shakespeare, not Dr.Seuss!But he requested it.I ended up at school.I couldnt mourn for him.I was too angry at myself, at my words.I loved him so much, Luke.I stop and let myself sob.He holds me and rocks me close to his chest.Im so sorry, Ella.He whispers and kisses my face.Its not your fault, Luke.Its nobody's fault.We sit and I lay with my head in Lukes lap, him stroking my hair, and I just treasure this moment.In his arms.Ella, Ellllaaaaa, Ellie!I startle awake, I must have relaxed a bit too much.My head is on Luke's lap, his fingers stroking the side of my face.Ellie?I yawn and sit up.While you were asleep I wanted to give you a unique little nickname for me to use and I thought Ellie was best suited.Cute.I reply, rubbing my head.We need to go.He stands to his feet and I hold my arms up in front of him so he can help me up.I pout when he sighs and he looks delicious.He pulls me to my feet.I wipe down my backside in case any leaves have attached themselves to my jeans.He pulls me close and holds me just for a second.Luke.I whisper.Yes?Lets do this again.I smile at him.Absolutely.He kisses me gently then grasps my hand and we walk in silence to the car.Seven      He drives me home and we sit in silence as he pulls up outside my house, the tension drawing us close together.He leans over and turns my head.Im holding my present on my lap   being careful not to drop it.Do you think you can fall for someone this quick?I mean properly fall for someone, not just a crush?He asks, his mouth set in a hard line.I think you can.I answer, a shy smile making its way across my lips.Kiss me.He murmurs.I lean over and hover above his mouth, just staring into his eyes waiting for his approval.God, Ella.He pulls me close, hard, my stomach complaining as I lean over the gear stick.This car is so small.I make sure I don't drop my present and move over to straddle him on his lap.He moves the drivers seat back so we have some room and his hands glide through my hair softly, but still holding me in place.We have little kisses and smile between, neither of us wanting to let go.Whoa.I feel his erection push against his jeans and I smile down at him.Someones happy.I laugh at him and he pouts.Dont pout at me, Mr.James.I push his lips together and reward them with a big wet kiss.I lean down to his ear, Luke, I need you to promise me something.At this moment, Ellie, Id promise you the world.Ellie.I do like it.I like Ellie.Me too, it suits you.Now, tell me my promise.He looks at me, his eyes possessed with mine.I lean my forehead against his.Please, dont repeat what Ive told you tonight to me ever again.I never open up, and talking about Jay, well, it just opens old wounds when my demons are buried.I need to move on.You now know that part of my life, so keep it safe in here for me.I put my hand against his chest and he nods.I smile at him and fall into his kisses once again.******     I feel a sudden sadness as I watch Luke drive away.It tugs at me and it feels so strange.Wow, what the hell just happened to me?Eighteen years old, falling in love.Yes, Ella, it has to be love.When he has driven out of sight, I open the front door to my house and gently shut it behind me.I lock it and tiptoe up the stairs to my bedroom.As soon as I flop on the bed, I have a knock at the door.Come in.I whisper.My dad pokes his head around the door, I sit up instantly afraid he might be angry with me.You okay, Els?He asks.Yes, Daddy, come in.I pat the space on the bed next to me and he takes a seat graciously.I waited up.He says through a yawn.I told mom not to wait up, I was on a date.He looks at me and softly smiles.Oh, Els, are you happy?Yes, Daddy.Does love happen quickly?Yes.He says with no hesitation.Your mom and me, we fell in love instantly.Our eyes gazing across the bar at each other.She just broke down all my guards.He shrugs, remembering the fond memory.I asked her on a date, she said yes.It was perfect.Daddy, I think I might be falling for Luke.I look at his puzzled expression and laugh.His name is Luke James.His family is very wealthy.Not that money matters to me.His father owns restaurants, baseball grounds, and Dodge Vipers.Its quite overwhelming.I sigh.Im sure it is, angel.I know of his dad, we used to work together.Still do really.I work for a company he owns.Really?I didnt know that.You work with cars right?Oh, Els, its lovely to know you have such a keen interest in me.Night, baby.He kisses my forehead and stands to leave.Goodnight, Daddy.I give him a smile and he closes my door slowly.When its shut, I pick up my present from my bedside table.I take a deep breath and open it.Inside the gift box is a second box with Chanel on the front.Whoa, Chanel, fancy.I open the box slowly, and inside, perfectly circled, is a bracelet.It looks silver.Its a linked chain with a love heart as the clasp.My tears fall down my cheeks as I try it on.Inside is a note.I know this is new, I know this is crazy.But, Ella, you have captivated me.Let me show you what it means to be with me.Luke.I smile ridiculously at the note and hold it for what feels like hours.I put the bracelet back in its box and put it in my bedside drawer.I fall asleep, dreaming of fast cars, glittering trees, and soft kisses.*****  I awake to the sun shining through my drapes, a warm glow warming my heart.As soon as I wake, my cell buzzes.*Morning, Ellie, Need a ride?*  I smile reading my nickname, but today I want to drive, I miss my car.I reply instantly.*Morning LUKEY.Sorry Id like to drive.Miss my car.See you in Math?E x *  His reply is instant, like he was waiting for my reply.It warms my heart.*You hurt me miss!Lukey, I like it.See you then baby.X *    Baby.I sit up in bed and hold my pillow.I smile and it wont leave my face.I'm dazed by my bracelet, it really is so beautiful and I haven't really done anything to deserve it.I really hope he doesnt think I need buying, because I dont.I frown at my thoughts and mumble into my pillow.Thinking about it, his guard is up.I raise my head quickly, and tilt my head to the side.Yes, of course.He has issues too.He wouldnt answer me about the compliment he refused to agree with.I really must stop being selfish and let him in too.This could be why he needed someone to talk to without being judged.I mentally note it and decide that I will talk to him eventually.I do, on the other hand, feel relieved to have told him about Jamie.Its something I dont ever have to repeat.God, I hope he doesnt feel sorry for me.I groan again at my wayward thoughts.My cell phone vibrates beside me, interrupting my reverie.Hello?Hey, sexy girl!Jades voice instantly causes a grin to appear on my face, distracting me.Hey, Jadey, whats up?Nothing, I just miss you, and you bailed on me the other day.She doesnt have to know it may have been the best thing I ever did.Yeah, Jade, I'm sorry about that.What time is it?Almost 8, you ready for school yet?No.I tut down at her through the phone.Im still in bed, thanks.I can feel her smile.Well I think you should make an effort today, beautiful.Straighten your hair, bit of mascara, and get your boobies out!Jade!I scold but still laughing hard with each other on the phone.This is why I love this girl.Jade, I sigh, I need to talk to you.About Luke.Yeah, I heard about that, Dylan was talking to the guys about it yesterday.Ella, Luke isnt all he says he is.She sighs.What am I going to do?Els, you just be yourself, baby girl.Ill see you later, you got a lift?Im driving myself today.I sigh.Okay, babe, Ill see you at lunch, text me if you can, I miss you.Miss you too, love you, Jade.You too.Bye.As I close my phone, I feel liberated and happy.I jump up and dig through my closet for my best bra and panties.No more mixing and matching if I have a boyfriend.Is he my boyfriend?I giggle to myself as I slide my underwear on.I pad barefoot toward my floor length mirror and stop to look at myself.I feel contentment radiate my body.I look, well, hot.I smile and continue my hunt for clothing.I find a fitted black tank top and a pair of blue faded jeans.Sorry Jade, but this is me.I dont straighten my hair.Instead, I let it fall over my shoulders naturally.I put on some mascara and check myself again in the mirror.I snap a picture of myself and send it to Jade and Luke.*Does my butt look big in this?*    He doesnt know about my lack of caring for myself, but Jade does.So her answer matters a lot more to me.Jade replies, almost instantly.*Meow!!*    Her response makes me smile a warm, happy smile.I hop on one leg, trying to get my converse on.A few minutes later I feel my phone vibrate again.I read the name and smile.*Beautiful.*  Just that one word causes my now well known butterflies to escape and flutter in my tummy.I hold my midriff and grin.I walk over to my bedside cabinet, switch on my stereo, which plays a dance beat, and open the drawer.I pick up the box and put on the bracelet.I shake my wrist and the sun catches the metal and stuns my eyes.I find myself laughing.I trace the outline of the bracelet with my index finger and let out a sigh.It really is so beautiful.Im ready.I really, really must repay Luke back somehow for his gift.Sex.I shove off the idea instantly.I am not a whore.I check the time   I have twenty five minutes before I need to be in school.I grab my jacket and bag from the end of my bed, shrug on my jacket, and make my way downstairs.I run into the kitchen and my mom is standing at the sink.I smile at her, briefly examining her.Her beautiful, wavy, chocolate hair falls so far down her back.She always looks like an angel.
