If Elliott could avoid the meth labs and weed operations that plagued public lands now, he could find a new hiding place every night.But what had he been trying to pull, making everybody think he was dead and gone if he was onlygone?Laura shifted her position, placing her elbows on the railing.Resting her chin on her clasped hands, she studied the ground below as if it held something fascinating.Sometimes I wish I could have a do over for high school andand everything.Startled, he answered without thinking.Id like a do over for that poorly timed marriage proposal.She shook her head so hard that a bobby pin dropped from her hair, bounced off the railing, and hit the porch.Her bun began to slip from its moorings.It wasnt even a real proposal.You think it was a phony one?It was your kind and honorable attempt to take care of me when we thought my dad had died.But it was unrealistic.Youre right.I had no business talking about marriage.We were just kids.I didnt even have a job because my boss had just disappeared.I didnt have any plans for my future except college, maybe, and having my own workshop someday.She frowned up at him.Im glad you can see how impractical it was.We should have talked about it years ago.The elephant in the room.Bigger than that.A brontosaurus, maybe.Can we start over, then?Friends?Weve never not been friends.You know what I mean, though.Even friends have a hard time communicating when a brontosaurus keeps butting in.You know itll never go away completely, she said.Maybe not, he admitted.But maybe we can shoo it far enough away that we wont keep stepping in brontosaurus, uh, poop.She laughed out loud, her eyes softening as she searched his face.He could practically see her heart softening too, as if talking about the awkwardness had begun to erase it.Slowly, she extended her right hand, apparently expecting him to shake hands.Instead, he captured her hand in his left hand and turned toward the mountains.Taking her cue from him, she faced the mountains too.Standing side by side, holding hands, he felt more connected to her than if hed had both arms around her.She held his hand tightly, like a child.It took him back to the days of skinned knees and scraped chins.The games theyd played on hot summer nights.Green plum wars, kickball games, watermelon seed spitting contests.He stole a peek at her just as she stole a peek at him.Dont look at me that way, she whispered.Sorry.Cant help it.Yes, you can.Easy for you to say.Youre not the one looking at you.She smiled, barely, and returned to her study of the high ridges.That brief smile was enough to keep his hopes on life support.The hand holding was a bonus.Anything else would have to wait until Laura was ready.Six thirty in the morning and there they were again, having their coffee in the living room like some old married couple.Except shed slept in her room and hed slept on the couchor hed tried to, anyway.It was too short for his long legs.Why didnt you use the guest bed, Sean?I moved the clothes and things off.He drained the rest of his coffee before he answered.I want to be between you and the door.Oh, youre so paranoid.I dont mind if you call me paranoid, as long as I can call you safe.He glanced at the grandfather clock and set his empty cup on the coffee table.Sorry to run off so early, but this is Wednesday.Trash day.I dont want to miss the truck.Go then, and stay as long as you need to.He sat there, staring straight ahead.Maybe he was thinking what she was thinking: if they were an old married couple, he wouldnt walk out the door without a kiss.But she hadnt kissed him since his eighteenth birthday, moments before hed made that goofy, tender, hopelessly ill timed marriage proposal.The sheriffs dive team had still been dredging the lake.Shed been a wreck.She still was.She was afraid of the baggage she brought with her.Afraid of Seans baggage too.Afraid of Dale and his hatred.If her dad was back, Dale would be cruel to him.No doubt about it.She brought her mug closer.Staring into her coffee, she relived the moment, days ago, when shed dropped the angel mug in the sink and stared into the eyes of the man at the window.Her dador not?Shed never seen him with a beard and long hair.Hed always been clean shaven, clean cut, and in good physical condition.But he might be in terrible shape nowphysically, mentally.Hed be no match for Dale.Sean stood up.I should go.Although Id like to stay.Go.Ill be fine.He sat beside her to put on his boots.Then he reached under the couch, pulled out his gun, and laid it across his lap.Please stop hauling that thing around with you, Sean.We said no guns, remember?Thats what we said on Monday.The day youd planned to stay at the Brights house.My exact words were no guns while youre gone.You came back.He stood up, pointing the barrel at the floor.Dont worry, its not loaded.But you could load it in no time.Would you actually start shooting if somebody showed up?Only if that somebody proved to be a threat.And if it was a clear case of self defense.What if its my dad?And how could you tell the difference between him and a stranger?We dont know what he looks like now.Not really.She got to her feet and backed up, putting some distance between herself and the gun.Get that thing out of here.And dont bring it back.Sean let out a sigh of exasperation.Yes maam.Its your house.He walked toward the door, still keeping the barrel down.Always so safety conscious.But holding that big gun, he looked like a soldier going off to war.Her stomach went queasy.If the unthinkable happened, she wouldnt be able to live with herself.Shed spend the rest of her life knowing that her fear of Dale had robbed her of her chance to love Sean.She couldnt lose him.She couldnt.He had to come back, safe and sound.Come back, she whispered.Sean must have heard.He leaned the gun against the wall, turned around, and started back.She shook her head.I didnt mean It was too late to explain.He was there, reaching for her.He cradled her face in his hands and kissed her like he had when they were teenagers in love, making her heart pound and her common sense fly out the window.She hadnt expected everything to happen so fast, and she hadnt expected it to feel so right.So natural.Their lips fit together like they always had, like theyd been designed for a game of giving and taking pleasure.He pulled away, studying her so somberly that the romantic moment shattered in her sudden recollection of his reasons for being there.His reasons for carrying a gun.Id better go, he said.Call if you need me.And keep your doors locked.I will.Whatever you do, dont forget the most important thing.She held her breath, trying to guess what kind of warning hed give her this time.Whatever he meant to say, he was taking forever to get it out of his mouth.What?she asked, finally.Whats on your mind?Say it.His eyes twinkled.I knew you wanted me to say it again.I love you, Laura.Oh, no.She wasnt ready for that.I know you do, she said gently.Because weve been friends since we were little kids.Dont play like that, sweetheart.You know what I mean.I love you love you.He curved his hand around her cheek and gave her one more kiss, then took the gun and walked outside, into the artificial light.He locked the door behind him.With her knees about to buckle, she collapsed on the couch and dragged the quilt up to her chin.She tried to organize her chaotic thoughts into neat little categories, but everything was interconnected.Sean.Dad and Mom.Gibby.Dales vicious grip on her arm.Bluegrass and kisses, wind chimes and guns.Over it all hung the fear that if her dad came home, something would go terribly wrong.Sean parked in his driveway and sat there for a minute, trying to understand why he didnt feel more victorious.He should have been celebrating Lauras wholehearted participation in those kisses, but some unnamed worry kept getting in the way.He couldnt pin it down.Whatever it was, it had been bothering him ever since hed left her.His vague uneasiness might define itself as he whipped through part of his routine.He needed to put the trash out.Shower and shave.Then hed spend some time in the shop, doing the bare minimum and picking up something to work on.He needed to proofread that brochure, too, and get it to the printer.Laura wanted him to stay away all day, working.Maybe she was right, but he hardly cared if his competitors sewed up all the orders this year.There would be other years, other festivals.Operating in a blurry fog of stress and exhaustion, he climbed out of the truck.He grabbed his trash can from its spot at the side of the house and rolled it out to the curb.Even if the world was falling apart, he couldnt miss trash day.Sean looked up and down the block.He half expected to see a lean figure lurking in the early morning shadows, but friendly, overweight Wally Morse came around the corner with his yellow Lab tugging him along.Glad to see something so normal and right, Sean lifted his hand in greeting.Wally waved back while the dog paused to sniff the fake flowers at the base of Mrs.Gibsons mailbox post.Theyd blown over again.It happened with every storm.Like the flowers in the cemetery Sean stiffened.That was what had been bothering him.Those pink azaleas.He couldnt process it, couldnt find a rational explanation, but he knew what hed seen.It might have been nothing, or it might have been the answer to Lauras prayers, but he couldnt share it with her yet.Maybe hed never be able to tell her.He wanted to drive hell bent for leather back to her place, but he made himself lock up the truck, leaving the gun on the rack.Then he proceeded to the front door.He fumbled the key in the lock, walked in, and shut the door behind him.He stood there staring at the cedar chest, but in his minds eye, he saw only pink azaleas.All day, Lauras thoughts had kept straying back to the interesting developments at dawn.Sean had not only kissed her but also told her he loved her.Next thing she knew, hed be talking about marriage againand shed worry about genetics again.When theyd studied genetics in Prestons biology class, shed wondered what the combination of Halloran and Gantt genes would produce.Their future children, should they have any, might be calm and kind and normal, like her mother.Like Sean and Keith.Or they might be walking disasters, cursed with a blend of her dads volatility and Dales drunken cruelty.But any marriage was a gamble.Having children was a gamble.Life itself was a series of gambles.She blew out a long sigh and told herself to get to work.Earlier, sorting through a pile of papers in the kitchen, shed found a dozen unopened sympathy cards that Ardelle must have set aside for her.Laura gathered a box of thank you notes, a pen, and stamps and took them to the backyard where a garden bench sat in the sun not far from the spot where the wind chimes had hung.She was surrounded by reminders of her parents.Trees theyd planted together.The old metal garden markers poking up among their prized perennials.Their birdhouses and bird feeders.Even the garden bench where she sat.Her dad had built it, and her mom had painted it a soft green that blended in with the bushes.The first envelope came from one of the elderly, unmarried Flynn cousins in North Carolina.Laura pulled out the card, its artwork a flowery swirl of pale pastels like an old womans scarf.Inside, Annabel Flynns shaky writing expressed regret that she hadnt been able to attend the funeral for dear cousin Jessamyn.The printed verse was soberly biblical in nature.Laura wrote a thank you note and moved on to the next envelope.A heavy, high quality envelope in a soft shade of gray, it bore no return address, but the sender had written Lauras name and her mothers address in bold, masculine penmanship that matched that of the naughty note shed found.She checked the back of the envelope.No return address there either.She ripped the envelope open and pulled out a card.The same color as the envelope, its front was blank.Slowly, she opened it.Laura, I was so sorry to hear of your mothers passing.She was a lovely woman.Ill never forget her.God bless.Gibby  It was true, then.Her mother wouldnt have saved that naughty note unless it had meant something to her.Theyd had more than a brief flirtation in a moment of weakness.Tempted to call Sean, Laura shook her head.He would be back soon.She would have plenty of time to tell him later.She wrote Gibby a short, kind reply.With every word, she reminded herself that shed chosen to forgive him and her mother.With every word, she thought she felt her fathers heartache.It was all too much, coming on the same day she and Sean had so suddenly resurrected their old relationship.She closed her eyes, listening to the wind in the trees and remembering the chimes that used to sing in every storm.To her father, their soft tinkling might have become as unpleasant as clanging cymbals.She hated to argue with St.Paul, but love sometimes failed.Sean had come back earlier than Laura had expected, but as shed expected, hed greeted her with another round of lingering kisses.As much as she relished revisiting their teenage romance on a deeper level, sometimes panic threatened.Everything was happening too fast, adding to the tension that accompanied the mystery of her fathers fate.Something was bothering Sean too, but he refused to talk about it.Sitting on the couch, he was frowning over the printers proof of his brochure.He hadnt bothered to shave when he made his quick jaunt back to his house, so he looked more like a wild man than ever.Are you happy with the brochure?she asked.He gave her a blank look.Excuse me?Your brochure.That piece of paper youve been brooding over for ten minutes.Whats wrong with you, Sean?Nothing.It looks great.She raised her eyebrows.Youd better get the order going before its too late, then.Just because its a quick print place doesnt mean you can procrastinate until the last minute.Yes maam.But instead of picking up his phone, he picked up a mandolin hed brought with him to break in.Leaving him inside, Laura moved to the porch with a few more notes to write.She hadnt yet told Sean about the card from Gibby.She settled into one of the Adirondack chairs her dad had made and opened a sympathy card from one of her fellow teachers in Denver.As she wrote a brief thank you, she tried to imagine explaining her dads situation to her friends there.She wouldnt even know where to start.Inside, Sean played a few notes, stopped to work on the tuning, and played a few more.Again and again, he started a song, interrupted it, and went back to it.Or started a different tune.Sometimes hed nearly reach the end of a song, but hed stop abruptly before the last line, leaving the song hanging.Unresolved.Sean, cant you at least finish a song once in a while?she called.The music stopped.The door creaked open.He stuck his head out.Excuse me?I cant stand it when you never finish a song.Sorry.Im not thinking about the songs.Im thinking about the tuning.The sound.The weariness around his eyes made her wonder when hed last had a good nights sleep.She smiled, softening.Im sorry, Sean.I was just being difficult.Go on; get back to it.Instead, he joined her on the porch and studied the dogwood tree that stretched a branch over the porch.Hands in his pockets, the wind ruffling his hair, he kept quiet.Leaving her correspondence on the chair, she stood in front of him.She reached up to push his hair off his forehead, revealing the small scars from the time Dale shoved him through a window on a summer night.Dale wouldnt let him see a doctor, so Sean had cleaned the cuts, sprayed them with Bactine, and applied a butterfly bandage to the worst one.By the time school started in the fall, the cuts had healed.But he would always have the scars.Hands still in his pockets, he gave her a quizzical frown.Yeah, I know.I need a haircut.But thats not what I want to tell you.She stretched upward to give him a quick kiss.Gibby sent a sympathy card.That was nice of him.The writing matches the note I found in my moms drawer.Sean sighed.Im sorry that your mom and Gibby had a fling, Laura.I really am.Me too.Especially for my dads sake.Sean took his hands from his pockets and reached out to tug a dogwood leaf from its branch.You know what your dad told me once about dogwood leaves?He ripped the leaf, gently, so it was still held together by tiny threads.See those?He told me theyre like strands of memory and fact that hold past and present together.Theyll hold for a little while, but not forever.Whats that supposed to mean?Facts dont change, but sometimes memories do.He tugged the two halves of the leaf completely apart, breaking the delicate filaments.Even if we uncover some unfortunate facts, some ugly truths, hang on to your good memories.You mean you dont want me to forget all the good I ever knew of my mom, even if she cheated on my dad?He dropped the two halves of the leaf over the railing and watched them fall to the grass.I was thinking of your dad too.He might have changed, but we need to remember the man he was.Honor the man he was.You sound almost like youre ready to admit he might be alive.Im starting to believe its possible.But be prepared for the worst.If he comes back, he might be in rough shape.You think I dont know that?Swallowing the urge to cry, Laura turned her back on Seanand faced the cemetery and another dogwood tree growing green and healthy near the family plot.Every time she saw a dogwood now, she would remember the leaf Sean had ripped in half.The way the past pulled away from the present, one filament at a time.One hour at a time.Hes bound to needsome help, she said, keeping her voice on track, no wavering or wobbling allowed.Then well get him some help.Imagine what it might be like to bring him home.To cook him a good meal.To let him sleep in his own bed and wear clean clothes.Lord willing, thats going to happen, Sean said.But we just dont know.Laura went to sit on the steps.He had the heart of a poet.Hes the sentimental one, not Mom.She stopped, realizing shed mixed present tense and past tense.He was the one who always cut fresh flowers for his parents and grandparents graves, and for Moms side of the family too.Sean sat beside her.He did that?On Mothers Day, Fathers Day, Easter, and Memorial Day.Dont you remember?Come to think of it, yeah.And its almost Memorial Day.Those are all spring and summer holidays, though.When I was little, I always felt sorry for dead people because they didnt get fresh flowers all through the winter, and thats when I thought they would need them the most.To cheer them up.Her dad had laughed softly when shed shared that little girl worry with him.He assured her it wasnt the dead people they needed to worry about.No, its the living who need flowers on their loved ones graves.Why, Daddy?To make us stop and remember who they were and why we loved them.That was all hed said, and she hadnt pressed him for more.By kindergarten, shed learned not to trigger his moods by asking too many questions.He even knew the language of flowers, she said.You know, that silly Victorian thing.Grandma Gantt taught him when he was a boy.Irises for good news.Daisies for innocence.Pansies for loving thoughts.Sean smirked.Pansies for loving thoughts.I like that.My inheritance from Dale will help me think loving thoughts of him when he finally kicks the bucket.What are you talking about?The pansy gun.He says hell leave it to me when he dies.Ive never seen it.Does it have pansies engraved on it or something?No, he calls it the pansy gun because its a womans gun, designed for a small hand.He measured with his fingers to show a gun no more than four inches long.I havent laid eyes on it in years.It belonged to his grandmother, and its the only gun he has left.Hes a convicted felon so he cant buy another one except on the black market.He shouldnt even have the pansy gun.Why dont you report him?I dont have the heart to.Hed wind up behind bars again.Besides that, I would feel like I was taking away his last shred of dignity.You could at least blackmail him into handing it over now instead of making you wait for him to die.Sean smiled faintly.I could give it a try.The wind was gathering strength, but it had no chimes to play on.A trains whistle blew in the distance, tone on tone, like two or three ribbons of sound that crossed each other and separated again.If her dad was out there, not too far away, he heard the same train at the same moment.With every breath she took, he took one.With every beat of her heart, his heart beat.And the moments went by.Days went by.Life went by.Almost twelve years had passed.Had he thought she wouldnt miss him?Sean reached over and laid his hand over hers.She stretched her arm alongside his, matching their pulse points, wrist to wrist.Theyd done that as kids, one cold night when their arms were covered with goose bumps.Ghost bumps, shed thought they were called, but shed been careful not to let herself believe in ghosts.Her dad had told her ghosts werent real.Now hed become almost a ghost himself, in a sense.A phantom.Why did my dad have to run?she asked.Wouldnt divorce have made more sense than abandoning us?Are you still afraid he stopped loving you?I know parents sometimes abandon their children, Sean.It happens.But most parents wouldnt try to fool their children into believing theyd died.Maybe he thought that was the kindest way to handle it.Because of the affair, you mean?Or because of his issues?A combination, maybe.Or he sensed that Mom didnt love him anymoreand that I was just so tired of his moods that II might have been glad if he disappeared.Oh, I hope he didnt think that.Even though, on some particularly difficult days, it might have been true.Sean squeezed her hand, then lifted his head to study the sky.I wonder if itll storm tonight.Her throat hurt from trying not to cry.She took a deep breath, harnessing her emotions.No, itll blow over.Thats what the weatherman says, anyway.You can take a storm and make music out of it, her dad had said with a smile on that long gone Valentines Day when he hung the miniature chimes from the star magnolia.A storm had been rolling over the shoulder of the mountains that day.Im going to stake out the cemetery tonight, Sean said.Because I told you my dad used to put flowers on the family plot?But that was so long ago.And he wouldnt do it anymore if he doesnt want people to know hes hanging around.If he doesnt want people to know hes around, seems like hed stop hanging aroundif thats really him.Maybe hes conflicted, she said.He halfway wants to be caught.Or maybe he has problems beyond PTSD by now, especially after living in the wild for years.He could even have Alzheimers.Sean only drummed his fingers on the step beside him.She stilled his restless movement with a firm grip.Whats wrong?Youre so edgy, youre practically vibrating.Are you sure you dont want to stay at my place tonight?Im sure.Especially if youll be right across the road.If he shows upits just my dad, Sean.Your dad, the guy who flipped out on a regular basis.The guy who caught us snuggling on the porch swing and busted it up with a sledgehammer.The guy who The daddy who sang lullabies to me even when I was too old for lullabies, just because I loved to hear him sing.The animal lover who fed a tiny starving kitten from a medicine dropper.He had the kindest, softest heart.He would never hurt me.She took a quick breath.You just told me to keep remembering the good about him.Stop contradicting yourself.Youre as conflicted as he must be.And I am too.After a long silence, Sean nodded.Okay.You stay here tonight.Ill have my phone.You can call me if you hear or see anything out of the ordinary.Call even if youre scared and you dont know why.No, you call me if youre scared, she said, trying to lighten the moment.Sean didnt even smile.A gust of wind scattered her thank you notes that were stamped and ready to go in the mail.She jumped up and chased them down.Its too windy, she said, gathering the rest of her things.Im going in.Me too.But he couldnt seem to keep his eyes off the churchyard.The night was dry but chilly, the wind wrestling with the trees.He would be half frozen by morning.Sean turned his cell phone to vibrate and returned it to his pocket.Armed with a flashlight and a thermos of strong coffee but no gun, he headed for the graveyard.Unless someone was watching from the woods or the kudzu jungle, nobody knew he was there.Nobody but Laura.Directly across from the house, he stood in the shadows and took in the view from the graveyard.The interior lights were out, but the security lights illuminated the yard and the porch.Laura would still be awake, listening to every sound.Hed scouted the lay of the land before nightfall, and hed found the most logical place for a person to hide and spy on Laura.Then hed found a place for himself, a place where he could watch for a watchera wooden bench, deep in the corner of the graveyard, behind an especially large gravestone.He could see the Gantt family plot, its cement curb barely visible by moonlight.From this vantage point, he could see a portion of the road too.If he kept scanning, back and forth, he wouldnt miss a thingunless someone crept up behind him.He sat on the bench and settled in for a long wait, his eyes adjusting to the darkness.On his side of the road, the brightest thing around was the steeple, its white paint lit from below, like a beacon trying to point people toward heaven.Not counting the time hed hid out in the vestibule to spirit Laura away from the old ladies, the last time hed been inside that church was for Jesss funeral.Hed slipped into the service a few minutes late.Standing in the rear, hed found the back of Lauras head, in the front row.A lamp had hung on the wall in front of her, perfectly centered, its light making a nimbus of rays around her gold red hair while her slightest movement had made the lamps finial seem to bob like a golden tongue above her head.Like Pentecost and those tongues of fire, hed thought, remembering her Pentecostal grandparents, the Flynns.They were buried right there in the same graveyard.A gust of wind blew down the hill, chilling him.North Georgia could be plenty cold, even in late May.The night would be a long one.His eyelids were already drooping.Hed never thought he could be sleepy in a graveyard at midnight.To keep himself awake, he tried to imagine how many lives were represented by gravestones in this one little plot of ground.Each grave held the remains of somebody whose day to day doings had added up to a life.Kindergarten, grade school, high school.Cars and cats and ball games.College, jobs, weddings.Kids and grandkids and old folks homes, and finally the graveyard with all its crosses that preached silent sermons about the life to come.Sean preferred that to Jesss notion that people died and then came back around again in some new form.He would rather live just one life that mattered.One life that ended with his hopes fixed on the resurrection of the dead.He unscrewed the lid of his thermos and fortified himself with hot, sweet coffee.He couldnt doze off on his watch.When Keith had called back, hed said Dale had stopped him downtown to rant.He was sure Elliott was the rat whod made that phone call years ago.Dale intended to find him, somehow.So Dale was roaming around, seeking his prey.Elliott was prowling around too, doing God knows what.When Mrs.Gibsons fallen silk flowers had jogged Seans memory in the early morning light, he knew who Lauras prowler was.He couldnt tell her, though.If he was wrong, it would break her heart.Last night at dusk, her tall vase full of pink azaleas had toppled in the wind, like the other tall and top heavy flowers all over the cemetery.But this morning when hed stepped onto the porch at first light, Jesss flowers stood straight and tall again.Someone had righted them between dusk and dawn.Someone who cared about Jesss flowers and hers alone.After a long night of fitful sleep, Laura rose before dawn and dressed.Two minutes into her morning, she could tell it was going to be one of those days.Her favorite shirt had lost a button.She put on a lightweight sweater instead, and it had a snag in it.Shed run out of hand lotion.And when she went to make the coffee, the grinder finally died for good.She threw it in the trash and headed into her moms room to take some lotion from her bureau.Laura shook her head at the clutter there.She needed to deal with it soon.Reaching for a tube of hand cream, she realized the tiny bottle of Jean Nat cologne was missing.Sheor Mikeymust have knocked it to the floor.If it wasnt tightly capped, it could leak and ruin the hardwood.On her knees, she felt under the bed.Her fingers bumped into something but she couldnt get a grip on it.Flat on the floor, she peered under the bed.The Jean Nat wasnt there, but she pulled out a hardcover book with an illustration of pink columbines on the cover and a lavender grosgrain ribbon peeking out to serve as a bookmark.Breathing fast, Laura sat on the bed.She opened to the first page and read the date.This was the final journal, starting near the end of March.It was the only one Ardelle hadnt found.Her mom had always picked up her pen at first light.The UPS driver had found her on the porch at ten in the morning, so shed probably written her final entry only a few hours before her death.Laura started at the beginning.Like the journals shed found earlier, it was daily trivia.Nothing about possible sightings of a supposedly dead husband.Shed recorded her dreams, though, as shed begun to do a few years before, and shed tried to analyze them.Shed used different colors of ink, perhaps for different moodslight blue, lavender, green, bright red.Twenty pages in, Laura reached the last entry, written in ordinary blue ink.It closed with Rain, rain, and more rain, but April showers will work wonders for my May flowers.It wasnt an especially significant sentence to close out a lifetime of journaling, but she lingered on it.Jessamyn Gantts last word: flowers.And that was the end of her thousands of journal entries.The end of her lifeon earth, at least.Laura ran a finger across the blank page that faced the last entry.She didnt want to think about what might have come next for a woman whod been raised on Holy Ghost revivals and altar calls and the blood of Jesus but had drifted into vague beliefs about being at one with the Supreme Being and the universe.According to her moms new, enlightened views, there was no such thing as sin.Just failings.With a sigh, Laura took the journal into the living room and compared it to a cheap spiral notebook from the early years.Her mom had used plain blue or black ink then, and she hadnt analyzed her dreams.Her penmanship had changed gradually over the years, but her love of flowers had never altered.In the early volume, Laura studied yet another line about gardening: Sometimes, a beautiful new plant springs up from the rot, from the dirt.A few short words followed, but theyd been scratched out, black ink over blue.Laura couldnt quite make them out.She turned on a bright lamp and looked again.The last word was probably me, but she couldnt be sure.Footsteps sounded on the porch.Sean, back from his night in the cemetery.Laura, he called.Its me.Coming.She ran into the kitchen as he unlocked the back door and walked in, unshaven and bleary eyed.Mornin, Red.Good morning.You look exhausted.Im all right.He seemed to be gauging her mood as he closed the door.Did you see anything?Hear anything?Nothing but birds and bugs.Anything happen here?Nothing but wind, all night long.Where did you hide out?On a bench, behind a big ol tombstone.Nothing happened, nobody came.I guess thats good news.I guess, she echoed, studying him.He acted too casual.Too relaxed.Yet she picked up new worries in the undercurrents of his voice, in the faraway look in his eye.But it became a hungry look when he crooked a finger at her.No, she said.Absolutely not.Not until youve brushed your teeth.He smiled.Did you brush yours?Yes.Sean ambled down the hall to the bathroom.She heard the sound of running water, the toilet flushing, running water again.He came back, not looking any more civilized but smelling like peppermint toothpaste.Better?he asked, pulling her close.Better, she said, and for a couple of minutes, she could nearly forget why he was there.Why hed sat in a cemetery all night.He pulled back and studied her.That was a long, cold night.Im glad to be in a warm house with bright lightsand you.He released her, walked over to the counter and pulled one of the lemon poppy seed muffins out of the bag.Something tells me you didnt get a lot of sleep, either.Yeah, well, I have a few things on my mind.No kidding.He pulled off a piece of the muffin and sat at the table.It was the same place where hed sat on the day her dad had brought him home, so bruised from that last beating that he could hardly move.Sean had put on a show of being fine.Just fine.A little hungry, maybe.But when her dad ruffled his hair and called him son, she knew Sean had gone to a new level of hero worship.He hadnt seen her dad as a wigged out Vietnam vet.Sean had simply loved him.He pinched a piece of muffin between forefinger and thumb and frowned at it.Stale muffins arent worth eating.Got coffee?Sorry.No coffee.The grinder broke for good, and theres nothing in the house but whole beans.That settles it.He stood up.Were going out for breakfast.No.I dont want to.Never argue with a man whos been awake all night in a graveyard.He opened the fridge and pulled out a Coke.Coke?For breakfast?I need some caffeine for the road.The old diner opens early.Lets go there.Not that new froufrou place.I want real food.But I want to be home in case he comes back this morning.It wont take long to grab a bite to eat.He hasnt shown up in broad daylight yet, has he?Are you actually admitting that he shows up sometimes in the night?Lounging against the counter, Sean studied her for a long moment before he answered.Im not admitting anything, darlin.He was weakening, though.Hed practically acknowledged that her dad was back.A thrill ran through her, nearly distracting her from the fact that Sean had progressed to calling her darlin.The residents of Prospect were gearing up for their biggest event of the year, and in spite of the early hour, the party atmosphere was in full swing.It did nothing to calm Lauras nerves.The main stage had been erected in the town square, and several smaller stages stood at a distance.Bright banners flapped from streetlight poles, and US flags flew everywhere in honor of Memorial Day.Posters adorned the windows of every business, including the diner.As Sean held the diners door open for her, Laura glanced at the newspaper rack beside it.The headline of the weekly paper, printed every Wednesday, read Bluegrass festivities start Friday.The lead article featured a photo of Gibby, dressed in black as always but his hair a handsome silver now.Sean paid no attention to the paper.Coke can in hand, he nudged her right past the Please wait to be seated sign toward an empty booth by the window, set with napkin wrapped silverware and two white coffee mugs, upside down.He settled down across from her and drained his Coke can.A teenage waitress scurried up to the table with laminated menus in one hand and a coffeepot in the other.Sean turned both mugs right side up.Unshaven and weary, he looked like a wild man whod just crawled out of a cave.Please, he said before the waitress could speak.Good morning, she chirped as she filled Lauras mug.How are yall?Fine and dandy, thanks, Sean said.How are you?Fine.She poured his coffee.Its gonna be a beautiful day.Yep.He pulled the sugar packets toward him and doctored his coffee.You want the special, honey?he asked Laura.The big breakfast?Yeah, you do.You need to eat.Two specials, please.Laura decided not to argue this time.It wasnt important.The waitress set the coffeepot on the table and whipped out her pad.Laura answered the questions without much thought.Over medium, whole wheat, hash browns, bacon, whatever.She would eat maybe ten percent of it.Same, please, Sean said.Except grits.He slid the empty Coke can across the table.And throw this away for me?The waitress nodded, scribbling.He raised his coffee mug to his lips.Leaving it there, he closed his eyes.Anything else I can get yall?the girl asked.That should do it, thanks, Laura said, since Sean seemed to have gone into a trance.Ill get that right up.The waitress retrieved the coffeepot and walked away.An older waitress walked past, the aroma of bacon and pancakes competing with her too strong cologne.Laura sat up straighter, remembering.Sean, I forgot to tell you about the Jean Nat.My moms cologne.This morning I noticed its missing from her bedroom.He opened his eyes.Who could have been in the house after I changed the locks?I think it was Ardelle, days ago.Before you changed the locks.She popped in at least once that I know of, when I wasnt home.She got defensive when Cassie brought it up, remember?Ardelle said she wasnt a thief.Maybe she was defensive because she is a thief.Cologne hardly seems worth stealing.She probably threw it out.Thought she was helping you de clutter.Why would she stop with only one item, then?I hate to worry Gary with it, but I should talk to Cassie, at least.She can help me figure it out.Before you call her, take another look, Sean said.In case you missed it.Good idea.Silence fell between them, making Laura aware of the background music.Instead of the usual soft rock, it was bluegrass in honor of the festival.Their food, when it came, was tasteless.Laura played with it, picked at it, pushed it around her plate.Youve got to eat, sweetheart, Sean said.Even if you dont feel like it.Dont worry about me.Ill be all right.He lowered his fork and searched her face.Thats exactly what your dad always said when your mom was trying to keep him from flipping out.Or hed give her that little wink.Remember?Laura nodded, fighting tears in earnest.Trying to evade Seans gaze, she looked across the crowded restaurant.Nearly filled to capacity, the room rang with laughter and chatter.She wondered if any of the conversations included her fathers name.The sheriff and a young but balding deputy had walked in, conspicuous in their khaki uniforms with their shiny badges and black holsters.The sheriff had aged since Laura had seen him last.His slicked back hair was touched with gray now, but hed kept his trim build.Law abiding public servants, the men stopped beside the wait to be seated sign.The hostess greeted them.Like a mama duck with two ducklings in tow, she led the men toward a table near Sean and Lauras booth.Watching them approach, Laura decided the timing was a godsend.If her dad chose this weekend to come back, perhaps drawn by the music, the sheriffs department should be on the lookout.Even though they didnt believe the rumors, they might need a reminder that if he turned up, he might be in bad shape.In need of help and protection.She glanced at Sean.He was studying her, his expression weary yet alert.What are you thinking?he asked quietly.I should have a word with the sheriff.Last I heard, you didnt want him to get involved.She didnt have time to explain.The men had arrived at their table, exchanging friendly banter with the hostess as they took their seats.She walked away, and the sheriff looked directly at Laura.Good morning, Miss Gantt.Sean.They echoed his greeting, and then Laura addressed the sheriff.Id like to ask you a question or two, she said.Sure, the sheriff said with a fatherly smile.Whats on your mind?She leaned toward him, not wanting to speak more loudly than necessary.I understand youre skeptical of the rumors about my dad.The sheriffs smile faded.Im sorry, but I havent seen any evidence to back them up.We need to talk, then.I might have some evidence.If you have facts, maam, Im interested.If its just more speculationwell, Im up to my eyebrows in speculation.Its more than speculation.He sighed.If youd like to come by my office sometime, we can talk.How about now?As soon as weve all finished eating?He shook his head.Im sorry, but Ive got my hands full with the festival.Lauras temper began to stir.A few minutes after breakfast is too time consuming?When I get this weekend behind me, Ill have a lot less on my mind.But its a three day weekend.He gave her a puzzled look.And?I dont want to wait until Tuesday.Tuesday might be too late.Miss Gantt, how long ago did your dad disappear?Ten or twelve years ago?After all that time, I dont believe a few more days will make much difference.What if it were your father out there?she asked fiercely, not caring anymore who heard her.Honey, I dont believe its your father either.Feel free to stop by the office on Tuesday morning, though.About nine would work for me.His condescending tone nearly provoked her into a caustic reply, but Seans boot came down on her shoe, gentle but firm.A secret signal.She looked at him, his disheveled hair hanging across his forehead, hiding those scars.One side of his mouth gave in to that sarcastic little upward tilt.His eyes shone like blue jewels.After all the times shed worried that he would overreact, now he was reminding her to keep her cool.She winked, just enough for him to see it.Dont worry about me.Ill be all right.He winked back.All right, she told the sheriff.Tuesday morning at nine, Ill be in your office.See you then.He moved his attention to the waitress approaching his table, and the conversation was over.So much for that, Laura said under her breath.I love you, Laura Gantt, Sean said, loud and clear.Right in front of everybody.He pulled out his wallet, extracted some money, and dropped the bills on the table.Youre not arguing, he said with a smile.Thats progress.I can never talk any sense into your head anyway.She slid out of the booth.Sean got up too and draped his arm around her shoulders.They went outside, into bright sunshine and a brisk wind that made the bluegrass banners tug hard against their tethers.Hammer strokes bounced off the planks of a temporary stage and reverberated across the square.A trash truck backed up, beeping.The air rang with the slap and thud of lumber being unloaded by the stage.The vendors booths were up, and the vendors themselves would appear soon to hawk their wares.Food and drink, CDs, songbooks, instruments.And Sean would be there bright and early on Saturday morning if she had to hogtie him and drag him there.Unless her dad came back, and then nothing else would matter.You okay?Sean asked.Not too mad at the sheriff?Its just frustrating.And all thisshe motioned toward a flurry of activity near the main stage.It makes me imagine my dad showing up in broad daylight.Walking right down the street.If he does, some kind soul will recognize him and help him track you down.What if hes back to track Gibby down?And what if Dales right in the middle of it too?Stop imagining the worst possible scenarios, Laura.Youll live longer.She shook her head, weary of arguing with him.You have any plans for tonight?he asked as they approached his truck.Not really.You?Please understand why Im not inviting you to tag along, but Id like to camp out at the cabin tonight.To see if anybody turns up.She felt a chill.You mean my dad?Dale, more likely.She realized shed unconsciously placed her left hand over the fading bruise on her right elbow although her sleeve hid it.Why tonight, though?she asked.Has something changed?Tomorrow night, Id like to get some sleep so Ill be in decent shape to man my booth on Saturday.Tonights my last chance to stake out the cabin before the weekend.She stopped walking and faced him.Hold it right there.I dont like the way you put that.A stakeout is for cops, looking for bad guys.My dads one of the good guys.One of the best, Sean said.Absolutely.No guns.Understand?He shot her a look of pure irritation.No guns.But youre not staying alone at the house.Stay at my place.Sean, its not necessary.Ill be fine.Would it hurt, though?She took a moment to consider her options.I guess it wouldnt hurt, she said, carefully noncommittal.Heres a key to my front door.He placed it in her hand.Thanks, Sean.Afraid he would read her mind if she looked him in the eye, she hurried to climb into his truck.Outside, chain saws buzzed like hornets as Cassie walked toward the kitchen to rustle up some breakfast.Her dad had hired a crew to take down some sickly pines before they died and fell on the house.The men had been hard at work since eight in the morning.That was only five, California time.She was not in an especially good mood.Hearing voicesor at least one voiceshe peeked around the corner.Her mom stood at the counter beside the sink, dumping a handful of sliced potatoes into her slow cooker.She seemed to be moving in slow motion, and she was talking to herself.Cassie crept closer, her bare feet noiseless on the smooth ceramic tiles, and listened.I cant do anything right, her mom said.Cant measure up.She lifted one hand to her face as if to wipe away tears.I cant even spell, she added in a stronger voice.Whoa, Cassie mouthed silently.She backed up a few steps and moved to one side for a better view.I cant be anybody else.I cant be anybody but me.Her mom picked up a potato and the peeler.Cassies phone rang in her pocket.Her mom whirled to face her.Darn, I wanted to talk to you and now somebodys calling me.Cassie pulled out her phone and decided not to mention it was Laura.Who is it?Her mom set down the peeler and the potato.She wiped her wet hands on her black sweatpants, the potato starch making pale smudges on the fabric.Its, um, an old friend of mine.Cassie made a hasty exit through the sunroom to the pool deck and took a deep breath of fresh air filled with the sweet scent of the butchered pines.The chain saws were annoyingly loud, but theyd be a good cover for the phone call.She opened the phone.Hey, Laura.Hey, Cass.Hows your mom doing?Pretty much the same, Cassie said softly.Whats new with you?WellI need to tell you what your mom has been up to lately.Or at least I think shes the one whos responsible.Oh boy.What did she do now?Cassie sat in one of the poolside chairs and waited for the bad news.It wasnt necessarily your mom who did this, but somebody went into my moms room and took a little bottle of Jean Nat.Her favorite fragrance.Youre sure its missing?Yes.I looked and looked, but its really gone.What does it smell like?Sort of fruity.Lemony.Spicy.Ill see what I can find out and let you know.Hey, Im going to try to talk her into hitting the festival tomorrow.Will you be there?Probably not.The live music wont start until tomorrow night, and Sean wont open his booth until Saturday morning.Thats where Ill be, if only to make sure hes there instead of here.Okey doke.Ill look for you at his booth on Saturday.See ya.Cassie returned to the kitchen.Now her mom was chopping onions.Mom, you want to hit the music shindig sometime?We can check out the bands.Eat a funnel cake or two.Mm hmm, her mom said in a vague tone.Moving closer, Cassie inhaled deeply.She didnt smell anything lemony or fruity.Just onions, and they made her eyes water.Wow, those are strong onions.Mm hmm.Thats nice, honey.Cassie blinked hard and fast.Now she was crying real tears, not onion tears.She couldnt deny it any longer.Something was wrong with her mother.Sean climbed out of his truck at the QuikTrip, swiped his card, and started pumping gas.He should have showered and shaved first, to wake up his weary brain, but it would have made as much sense as a shower and a shave before a hunting trip.Bad analogy.Elliott wasnt prey.Just down the street, one of the banners for the festival snapped in the wind, its bold blue and green design the same one the town had used for years.It was finally getting some recognition.By tomorrow night, the town would be packed with musicians and fans.Rowdy drunks and noisy bikers.Affluent tourists and penny pinching locals.The crowds were bigger every year, threatening to make it one of the biggest music events in the Southeast.Of all the crazy times for Elliott to come back.Sean was starting to hate that wordcrazybut as much as he wanted to believe Elliott would never hurt anybody, there was no telling what frame of mind hed be in.Or what he might be charged with someday.Sean rubbed the tight muscles in the back of his neck.He was glad Laura had agreed to spend the night at his house.She wasnt happy about it, obviously, but she hadnt argued much.He bought a bag of ice and poured it over a six pack of Coke in his cooler.Between him and Keith, they would have Coke, coffee, flashlights, plenty of bug spray, and at least one snake bite kit.No guns.Hed given his word.He put the lid on the cooler and checked the sky.Hed make it to the cabin before dark, and Keith would show up as soon as he got off work.Sean was still amazed that Annie had put her stamp of approval on the expedition.Before he could get away, a white car pulled up next to him.Doc Marsh rolled down the window, his kind face burdened with worry.How goes it, Sean?Oh, its interesting.It sure is.Doc kneaded his steering wheel with his pink hands.Half an hour ago, I saw Dales truck at the Gantts old cabin outside of town.I thought I should let you know.Great, maybe itll be a family reunion.Sean didnt try to hide his sarcasm.Keith and I are planning to stay there all night tonight to see if Elliott turns up.If he does, he might need some serious help.You know where to find an old doctor who still knows his stuff.Thank you.Ill keep that in mind.All right, then.Treat him rightif you find him.And God be with you.Thanks.Sean climbed into his truck, threw it in reverse and glanced behind him, the empty gun rack snagging his attention.All his guns were locked up tight at home.Laura was safe and sound under his roof too.It should have given him a measure of peace.Driving down the road, Sean remembered Elliott whittling on his porch one night, rambling about every subject under the sun.Hed said there was a difference between justice and revenge.And sometimes, hed said, eyeing his knife, a sin wasnt a crime.Sometimes a crime wasnt a sin.Obviously, hed had his own ideas about justice.Maybe theyd still have a happy ending, though.Sean could imagine finding Elliott lounging against a tree trunk somewhere.Whittling a piece of wood, maybe.Hed be old and grimy and skinny, and maybe he wouldnt be entirely rational, but hed still be himself in the ways that mattered.Hed still be a good man with a kind heart.Hey, Sean, hed say, setting down his knife.
