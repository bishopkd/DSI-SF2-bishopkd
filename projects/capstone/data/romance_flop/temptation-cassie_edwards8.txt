Before, she felt ashamed after initiating a kiss, but not anymore.The only thing she thought about lately was kissing him.Right now, she couldnt take her eyes off of his lips.Bryan opened his eyes, looked down, and met her gaze.He smiled, Whats on your mind?This.She adjusted her body to sit in his lap, wrapped her arms around his neck, and kissed him hungrily.He pulled her closer to his body and returned the kiss.She readjusted her position and straddled him, moving her hips in a rhythmic motion.When she realized he wasnt going to resist, she eased back and quickly lifted her shirt over her head and threw it behind her.Only a thin tank top covered her upper body.Alarms went off in Bryans head.He loved the way Ashlee felt in his arms so close to him.But he knew her heart.He knew this wasnt what she really wanted.She wanted to please God and she wanted to wait until her wedding night to make love to him.If they went through with this, she would feel terrible afterwards.If he truly loved her, he needed to be the man God wanted him to be and lead her in the direction God required.Bryan stood up quickly with Ashlee still attached to him.He turned towards the couch and gently laid her down.He kneeled down beside her, kissed her forehead, and handed her the shirt she had taken off.Here, sweetheart.Put this on.Im going to go wait out in the car.He grabbed his phone and his keys and walked outside leaving Ashlee lying on the couch wishing she could disappear.16  Natalia knew shed made the most logical decision in allowing Terrance to continue to take care of her and Breah.The only problem was her heart didnt belong to Terrance, it belonged to Bryan.She was accustomed to a certain lifestyle and she wasnt ready to give that up, not even for love.Truthfully, if Natalia didnt have Glenda Lynn Santiago for a mother, she wouldnt have thought twice about leaving Terrance and using Breah as a way to make a life with Bryan.She refused to give her mother something else to make her feel bad about.It was her mother whod told her to give up on being a lawyer because she was too much of an air head to make it.What kind of a mother, especially a college professor, said that to their own child?Glendas advice to Natalia was to become a paralegal and pray she could snag an older successful lawyer if she wanted to keep the life she was accustomed to.When Natalia tried to argue with her mother that she could become a lawyer if she would give her more time, her mother threatened to cut her off financially.Shed told her to make sure she kept her looks intact because that would insure she got a rich and successful man.Her mother was willing to pay for her to get plastic surgery and tummy tucks, but wouldnt give her another dime to pursue a degree in law.In turn, Natalia took the hours shed already accumulated and added a few more classes to get her paralegal degree.The day shed said I do to Terrance was the first time her mother ever said she was proud of her.The second time was when she became pregnant with Breah.Her mother called her pregnancy an insurance policy.For this reason, no one could ever know who Breahs father really was.She couldnt risk losing Terrance.Still, she hated Bryan had moved on with Ashlee.She couldnt figure out what he saw in her.Sure she was cute in the adorable little sister sort of way, but what was it about her?Shed made a slip of the tongue when talking to Bryan.Hed never mentioned her name to her.Thankfully, he was so caught up in the situation with Breah, he didnt notice.Once Bryan had really cut her off, she decided to see what the real reason was because, married or not, no man in his right mind would give up a chance to be with her.Shed visited his church a few Sundays, entering the service late so she would go unnoticed.The first Sunday she attended, she noticed he couldnt take his eyes off of one particular woman.For the life of her, Natalia could not understand why he was so fascinated with the homely looking chick.After service ended, she stood quietly in a corner and watched their interaction.She had never seen Bryan act so desperate to get attention from anyone, especially someone who didnt seem remotely interested.A few Sundays after that, when she pulled into the churchs parking lot, he was standing outside talking with the same girl.This time, however, she looked very different and very interested.She figured he must have fallen for the whole shy girl act because she played it well.The way Ashlee looked dressed up, there was no way she was really all that shy.Plus, she did have two children.Natalias mind was conflicted.She hated Ashlee for taking her man, but she was intrigued by her at the same time.It was something about her that caused Natalia to forget everything else.For months, shed been looking at pictures of Bryan and Ashlee on his social media.After searching, she assumed Ashlee wasnt active online.She even sat at the park and watched her interact with her children.She hated how everyone seemed to flock to Ashlee.The other children loved her, and the parents were always complimenting her about something.Natalia went so far as sitting outside of Ashlees job a few times just to see if Bryan still sent her flowers.He never sent me any flowers, or anything else for that matter.She thought to herself.She was glad to know he wasnt.Natalia had printed so many pictures of Ashlee and Bryan, she had to get a box to keep them in.She kept it locked away in the attics storage room.She had a few of Ashlee and Bryan, some of just Bryan, but most of them were pictures of Ashlee by herself.Some days, Natalia sat in front of the computer studying Ashlees physical attributes.She wondered if Bryan would want her if she were to wear her hair like Ashlees, or dress like her, and play the shy role.She noted the time and put the box away.Breah slept soundly in her crib, so she went upstairs to get cleaned up.She thought about her husband and how hed been so kind to her for the past three years of their marriage.He didnt pressure her to get a job.He even offered to hire a cook and cleaning person.Natalia declined the offer because she doesnt like people in her personal space.She tried to love Terrance, but she didnt.He was gentle in every way.The love making was good, but she didnt enjoy being with him the way she did with Bryan.Sometimes the only way she could even make it through was to pretend Terrance was Bryan.When she had gotten to the point where squeezing her eyes tight and visualizing Bryan had stopped working, she talked Terrance into changing his look.Terrance and Bryans complexion were pretty similar, so Natalia convinced him to change his haircut and goatee to match Bryans.She even started buying his clothes so he could dress like him.Natalia, Im home.Terrance called out as he entered their home.Ssshhh, she said as she rushed downstairs.Youre going to wake up Breah.Here, I bought your new favorite flowers.He handed her the bouquet.She took the calla lilies from his hand and smiled.Shed overheard Bryan ordering calla lilies for Ashlee in the office.Thanks, but its Ashlee.Remember?Terrance frowned.I thought that was only when were in bed.At first, yes, she said.But dont you think it would be fun to call each other by those names all the time?Not in public of course, just when were home alone.Ohhhh Kay, he said hesitantly.If thats what you want.Oh yeah, before I forget, Natalia said handing him a box off the end table.I ordered you these last week.They arrived today.Wow.This is a surprise.You usually only buy me gifts on Christmas and birthdays.First, clothes.Now, this.Whats in the box?Hazel contacts, she said smiling.I used your prescription and had them ordered for you.Now, instead of wearing clear ones you can wear these.Terrances eyes darted back and forth from Natalia to the small box in his hands.After a brief silence, he spoke slowly.Baby, he said, I appreciate you thinking of me, but dont you think a twenty nine year old man wearing hazel contacts is kind of umweird?You dont have to wear them in public, she said.Just at home, when were together.Please.You said youd do anything to make me happy.She reached her arms around his neck and gave him gentle kisses on his lips.Okay, Ill give it a try.He pulled her closer.I just wish I didnt have to wait to take you upstairs and Natalia frowned and wiggled out of his embrace.Just put them on.17  Ashlee covered her ears and pulled the covers over her head in an attempt to drown out the constant beating on her door.This was one of those days when she hated living in a one bedroom.She allowed the kids to share the room and she slept on a pull out sofa in the living room, right next to the front door that someone, who apparently didnt get the hint that she wanted to be left alone, was beating on.Ashlee, I know youre in there, Monica yelled.Open the door or Im gonna use my key.After Ashlees visit to Bryans home, she stopped going to work and Ashlee never missed work, not even when she was sick.Since you wont pick up your phone, Im making a house call.I know youre in there.Now, open the door.Ashlee grunted and threw the cover off her face, Well, if you have a key use it and stop making so much freakin noise.Now I know somethings wrong.Ive known you for two years and Ive never heard you raise your voice at a single soul.Im coming in now.She slowly opened the door and looked around.Outside, the day was bright and beautiful, but it was completely dark inside of Ashlees apartment.Monica noted the soda cans, empty pizza box on the coffee table, childrens toys, and a couple of cookies in the corner as she made her way through the living room.She walked towards the kitchen to turn on the light.With a quick glance, she noticed the kitchen sink was piled with dishes, and there was a box of what used to be Krispy Kreme donuts on the floor.Monica peeked in the room to see if the kids were there before she began.Okay, could you please tell me where the real Ashlee went to?Im not going to comment on all this unhealthy food cause I know you can put it down in the food department.But the Ashlee I know wouldnt leave a single dish in her sink, let alone a sink full.Whats going on?Who are you?And, what did you do with my friend, the real Ashlee ShanteAllen?Ashlee stuck her head out from under the covers.Ugh, would you leave me alone?And, turn the light back off?Im tryin to sleep.What do you want?Monica smacked her lips, put her hand on her hip, and cocked her head to the side.Whats your problem?Youve missed three days of work.She looked around.Where are my niece and nephew?I enrolled Jordan in pre school three days a week to give Mama Esther a break.Jade is with Bryans mother.And my problem is that when youre not calling back to back, youre over here flicking on these freakin lights when Im clearly trying to sleep.Monica rolled her eyes, flopped on the pull out sofa, and pulled the covers off Ashlees face.Dang, girl.You look a mess.Ashlee turned her body so her back faced Monica in an attempt to dismiss her.Is this about Bryan?Monica asked.Are you still mad because he wouldnt give you any?Ugghhhh.How do you even know about that?Because hes been by the job every day since you went MIA and he gave me this phone to give to you.Ashlee had left the phone hed given her at his house.Once she decided they werent going to be together, she didnt need it.Ashlee sat straight up with a mortified look on her face.He told you about that?Monica smiled and shook her head.Nah, he didnt.But hes been texting you for two days.He brought me the phone on Tuesday  you know the day after the lunch break you took and never returned from.I figured youd be in for work the next day, but you didnt come in.When today came and you still werent there, I thought I should bring it to you.Oh, and I read the messages hes been sending.Ashlee laid back down.So dag on nosy.Well, you can take it back to him, because I dont want it and I dont want him.Monica laid down beside her friend and put her head on her shoulder.Youre not really upset with him for resisting right?Talk to me, chica.Whats really going on?Ashlee wasnt sure what to say.She was too embarrassed to admit what really bugged her.She felt rejected, humiliated.She wanted him and he dismissed her with no explanation.Shed heard the ladies at church talk about how much of a ladies man Bryan was and that hed slept around a lot in college.Shed overheard one of them saying Ashlee wasnt sexy enough to keep a man like that interested and if she didnt give him a reason to stay hed be gone and theyd be happy to handle him for her.Sure, hed proposed to her and was showering her with a lot of gifts and attention.Ever since the night on the yacht, she knew by the way he caressed her while they were dancing that he was interested in having sex.So why did he reject her?She relaxed, looked at her friend, and sighed.I dont know.Its like Its just Im so embarrassed.I was all over him like a sex starved cat in heat, kissing and grinding on him and he left me there without saying a word.
