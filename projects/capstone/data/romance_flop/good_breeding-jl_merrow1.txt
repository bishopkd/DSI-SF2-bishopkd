 The bouquet of pink carnations in Giless hand was suffering slow strangulation as his nerves overtook him.He stood in the doorway of the pub hed ducked into for a bit of Dutch courage, staring at the house opposite.This was, quite possibly, the biggest day of his entire life.I cant do it!he hissed.His friend Oz clapped him bracingly on the shoulder.Yes, you can, he said firmly.Come on.Whats the worst that can happen?Easy for you to say, Giles muttered, trying not to think of all the ways this could go disastrously, horribly, humiliatingly wrong.Are you quite sure this is the right address?Well, youve only checked it about seventeen timesof course Im sure!Angela Mills, 47 Red Lion Street, Putney.But what if its the wrong Angela Mills?Its not.We checked, remember?Angela Mills, ne Shepney.How many of those can there be?Oz gave Giles a last friendlyif somewhat impatienthug then pushed him firmly in the direction of the most terrifying front door Giles had ever seen.Now cross that bloody road and go give your old mum a kiss.* * * *  Giles had always known he was adoptedMummy and Daddy were both tall, fair haired and on the willowy side, whereas it had been obvious from an early age that Giles was destined for a life of standing on tiptoe to reach the highest shelves and shaving every half hour if he wanted to avoid five oclock shadow.But it hadnt been until hed reached adulthood that hed really thought about contacting his birth mother.His college room mate Oz, who was staying with Giles for a few weeks over the summer, had been all for it.Hed said family was very important, which now Giles came to think about it was a bit ironic, coming from a man who never seemed to want to talk about his own family.Mummy and Daddy hadnt tried to discourage him, although Mummy had said a few strange things about not judging books by covers, and it taking all sorts to make a world.Giles had only listened with half an ear.Obviously it took all sorts to make a worldsomebody had to clean the streets and empty the dustbins, after all.Blood, however, would out; Giles just knew his mother would turn out to be as refined as he was.Anything else was unthinkable.Pulling himself together, Giles rapped firmly on the door, and held his breath.The door was opened by a bleached blonde in leggings and a saggy boob tube that showed an unhealthy amount of orange flesh.A cigarette dangled from her mouth, held loosely between yellowed teeth.Still, Giles supposed charitably, living in Putney his mother probably couldnt afford anyone more respectable as a cleaner.Oh, er, hello?he said politely.Im looking for Angela Mills.Im Giles Frobisher.He was just about to add, Is your employer in?when the cigarette fell to the doormat, unheeded, and claggily mascarad eyes widened in surprise.OhmiGAWD its little Wayne!a raucous voiced croaked, harpy like.You ear me, you useless lot?My Waynes here!Come in, love, come in, and give your mum a kiss!To his horror, Giles found himself grabbed by mahogany coloured talons and yanked into an embrace liberally fragranced with eau de ashtray.Um.I.  Um, he said intelligently, trying to stamp out the smouldering doormat before they both went up in flames.Then the true horror of his situation struck him.Wayne?he squeaked.Her face split into a fond smile.She had lip liner tattooed on in a wonky line, Giles noticed mechanically.Thats what I called you, love.They went and changed your name when you was adopted, but youll always be my little Wayne to me.I cant believe youre ere!Come in, and meet the family.She led him through a narrow hallway strewn with cheap, down at heel shoes and flyers from local takeaways, and into a sitting room so small Giless claustrophobia began to set in.Oy!You lot, this is my Wayne.Hes come to visit, so you can get off your bleedin arses and say hello, all right?
