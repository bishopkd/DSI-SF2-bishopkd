The ape wheezed.My loss, then, Oz said easily.Giles was impressed by the way he managed to keep even the barest hint of sarcasm from his voice.* * * *  Are you sure youre going to be all right if I go out tonight?Giles fretted as they made their way back home.I cant understand how Hugh managed to forget about your visit when he booked the tickets.Its not like him at all.Oz gave a funny sort of laugh.No, hes got a memory like an elephant, Hugh has, he said.Dont worry about me.Ill be fine with your parents.He grinned suddenly.Your mum said shed get out your old baby photos to show me.And anyway, its La Boheme tonight, isnt it?Thats your favouriteyou cant miss that.He hesitated for a moment, staring straight ahead.But I think you should use the opportunity to tell Hugh about Angie.Hes your boyfriendhe ought to know.Hes not going to be pleased, Giles muttered darkly.He doesnt even know Im adopted.Oz stared.He has met your parents, hasnt he?Giles flushed.I think he just assumes Mummy had a bit on the side.It seems to be almost de rigueur amongst his parents set.Well, if he loves you, Oz said, hell accept you, whoever your parents are.Come on, youre still the same bloke you were yesterday, arent you?I suppose so, Giles said, brightening.Still, Giles couldnt help feeling a little queasy at the thought of telling Hugh about his birth mother.* * * *  Giles met Hugh in the foyer at Covent Garden.They only just made it into the theatre in timeHugh had been having drinks with some friends and just hadnt been able to get awayso they didnt get a chance to speak until later.Not quite able to work up the courage to broach the subject of his parentage during the first interval, Giles listened instead to Hughs scorn at the vocal capabilities of the mezzo soprano (a rather pleasant looking lady, Giles had thought, but he supposed that didnt really count for anything in opera).At the second interval, however, fortified by champagne, Giles forged ahead.Hugh, Im adopted, he blurted out, inadvertently interrupting Hughs amusing anecdote about how hed got one over on one of his fathers employeesbut then, Giles had heard it twice already, so he had some excuse for not listening to Hugh as attentively as he otherwise would.Are you?Good Lord!Hugh didnt look precisely pleased at the news.Giles swallowed.And Ive found my birth mother.Ive been round to see her twice now.Shes married now, with two other children, and lives in Putney.Hughs lip curled in distaste.Then he gave a forced sounding laugh.Still, never mind.Im sure youll manage to lose her again.I dont want to lose her!Giles protested.Its not her fault shes working class, and lives in a council house.For Gods sake, Giles, Hugh hissed.Keep your voice down, will you?Surely you dont want everyone hearing about your sordid origins?Theres nothing sordid about my origins, Giles said stiffly.Angies a lovely lady.Angie?There was a subtle change in Hughs manner.Giles well, the fact is, Ive been meaning to talk to you for some time.I dont think its going to work out, you and me.What?An icy chill suffused Giless body, and it had nothing whatsoever to do with the champagne.
