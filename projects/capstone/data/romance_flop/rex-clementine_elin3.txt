He still hadnt explained but I really didnt want to know now.Krystie was ruining everything.Good thing I had tomorrow off.He had plenty of time to explain.He touched the bottom of my shirt and slowly lifted it off of me.I looked down at it, black scarring the once white shirt.I stood up and he undid my pants in a caring motion, unlike any kind of way he had before.They fell off and he turned me around and urged me towards the shower.Ill be outside okay?I will make some tea.Do you want raspberry?His voice was calm, no anger consumed it like it did my own.I closed my eyes and nodded.I heard him step out of the room as I opened my eyes.I removed my bra and underwear and stepped into the burning shower.I curled up and sat down in the tub.The water poured over me and I felt my body relax.I looked down at the black that was filling the water.The ash that had singed my hair was working itself loose.I let out a sigh and let the water fall down my body.Each droplet released a small sense of stress.I closed my eyes and saw the fire, engulfing what I had made my home.They would most likely rebuild it but I dont know if I could live there again, knowing it could go down that easily.An electrical fire?What an odd way to take down a whole building.I heard Octavius voice outside, deep and masculine.Rex replied but I couldnt hear them.Their voices garbled from the water streaming down my face.I smoothed my hair down and heard the tea kettle go off.I turned the shower off and looked down at the dirt that had once been on my body.I had stayed away from the fire, far enough that I could have barely felt the heat from it and still I was covered in evidence.I grabbed a towel and noticed clothes on the toilet.I grabbed them and smiled.It was a grungy t shirt that obviously belonged to him and a pair of my jeans I had left over long ago.I pulled the clothes on and threw my hair up onto my head before taking a couple of steps over to the door.I put my ear against it and listened to the two of them talk.Well I mean what do you think she would do?She is working with Anya.That is ridiculous I mean she is taking this way too far.You guys broke up big whoop.Just because she is in the Tainted doesnt mean that she can just do that.Octavius spoke to Rex.The Tainted?What was that?I pressed my ear closer to the door to listen to Rexs soft voice.I know.I would be pissed if I was Anya too.But I mean thats Krystie for you.That is how she always acts.Maybe Anya just doesnt know that yet?He sighed heavily and they both became quiet for a second.She must be done.The water is off.Shit.I totally forgot about that.I pushed the door open and looked up at the two of them.Octavius smiled at me and Rex just looked like he was upset.I ran my hand through my hair and leaned against the door frame.The tea ready?My voice was hoarse, I couldnt figure out why.Oct brought me a cup and winked at Rex before leaving the room.I held the warmth in my fingers feeling it spread through me.The shock of getting out of the bathroom always left my skin cool.Rex took a few steps towards me and tipped my head up to look at him.Im sorry.He whispered before leaning close to me.He didnt touch my lips but closed his eyes and rested his forehead against mine.I had no clue she was working there.I didnt want to hug her, god she is like the plague.She always shows up when I dont want her to.His eyes opened and he looked at me.They were a dark gray, the blue wasnt even visible within them.I nodded and bit my lip.Its okay.She is in the past though right?She isnt just going to show up and demand you back?His face lit up when I said that.I felt a smile creep across my lips as his pressed his against mine.In the past.You are the present.Nothing else.He whispered into my ear as he pushed a stray hair away from my face.Promise?I whispered and felt myself falling into him.He always had a way of making me calm, it washed over me and I was helpless.Promise.He was stern this time, meaning it.Carving it in stone and giving the stone to me.I nodded and wrapped my arms around his back.My face fell into his chest and rested there.His chest rose and fell silently as his arms wrapped around me.What am I going to do about my place?My voice cracked and I held him tighter against me.I have lost everything.I dont even have clothes anymore.Dont worry about that.You can stay here.I shot him a look.Only until you find a place.He smiled and smoothed my hair down.My trust had still been broken a bit from the Krystie thing.I wasnt so willing to just move in either but I didnt have a choice.We can go shopping tomorrow okay?You have it off right?I can have Oct do my tattoos.I dont want to cause a scene.I bet Shauna can bring me.I looked up at him, his eyes a fiery blue again.He leaned down and I let him kiss me.His kiss was full of warmth and love.He slowly slid his hand around my neck and up into my hair.I didnt want to kiss him at first, still angry, but eventually I couldnt stop myself from kissing him back.He smiled through one kiss and pulled away.Now we cant make out cause Octavius is here somewhere but hold that thought.My cheeks flushed and I nodded.Are we still doing drinks?I questioned and looked down at my outfit.Not really bar worthy but it was all I had left.Rex shook his head no.Just a movie and dinner kind of night.Is that okay?I nodded and hugged him tightly.Thank you.I whispered.He kissed the top of my head.No thank you for coming back.My eyes closed and I felt at home again.The sun played on the sheet and my eyelids, beckoning me to wake up.Rolling over with a groan I found myself smushed up against Rex.I pushed myself up in the bed and smiled down at him.He was asleep, his face at ease.He had fallen asleep with his glasses on.I took them off gently and frowned at the red lines they had left.Oct had left around midnight and I practically passed out once he left.Rex had said he would read until he fell asleep.Now in a sitting position I could see the book on the ground, sprawled out.I reached over Rex and grabbed it, constantly checking to see if I had woken him.He was a rough sleeper, let me tell you.The book was an old, brown leather bound book.The pages were stained and creased from dog earring the corners.I flipped through the pages and frowned at the writing scrawled across the pages.It was written in cursive rather than typed.I flipped to the middle and began reading.Joan is on trial.I went to a man today to talk about seeing a God who might be able to save her.If I can just convince him maybe he will understand?The man said that I can meet him Saturday, it is Tuesday now so maybe if she can just hold on until then?I hope so.She is the only family I have left.I felt a shiver go up my spine and realized it was Rexs hand.I closed the book and let it slip back onto the floor.His face lit up when he saw me laying across him.What are you doing?He smirked.Oh nothing.I pulled myself back and got up from the bed, making my way to the bathroom.I looked at myself in the mirror and frowned a little bit.I had wrinkles starting from being so upset last night.I pulled the skin taut until they disappeared but alas when I let go they reappeared.Sighing I left the bathroom to see him standing outside the door in his boxers.Hey hottie.I giggled and kissed him.God you are so beautiful.He whispered into my ear and I fought the urge to fight back.I had learned he did not like being told he was wrong so I pretty much had to let him compliment me all the time or he would get cranky.When is your first appointment today?I asked kissing under his chin.He wasnt that much taller than me but when we hugged he could put his head on top of mine.I swear either he grew or I shrunk.I thought we had been the same height when I first met him.I told you I will have Octavius take it today.He looked down at me but my jaw was set.And I told you, Shauna is taking me.You are a really good tattoo artist, I dont want anyone denied that when they had an appointment.He raised an eyebrow and shrugged.I suppose.He reached into his back pocket to retrieve his wallet and handed me a card.I looked down at it confused and he laughed.Do you not know what a credit card is, love?Yeah but I can buy my own clothes...His mouth pressed against mine and he slid the card into my hand.Dont even start that again.I smirked and remembered we had had a bicker about who would buy me new clothes.If you dont use my card I will be pissed and tattoo some ugly thing on you in your sleep!I gasped.Some threat!I giggled and took the card.I suppose you can pay.Whats my limit?A new wardrobe and whatever else you need.No limit.I stood shocked for a second.This man is letting me spend whatever I want on his credit card?Yep, I got that right.I suppose if I try to fight you will tell me you have amazing credit and havent used this card in years?My eyes met his.Pretty much.He smirked and I rolled my eyes at him.The only clothes I currently owned were a couple band t shirts and a pair of jeans.Reluctantly I threw them on and made my way into the kitchen.He was sucking down some coffee, still in his boxers.I got a few hours until my appointment, relax.He responded to my glare.I have to go.Shauna is supposed to meet me at the mall.I smiled and kissed him.He pulled me close and didnt let go for what seemed like eternity.Do you need anything?I whispered against his chest which I now found to be the most comforting space ever.If you want you can buy me stuff, but you dont have to.He ran his finger down my jaw line and I felt a shiver ripple through my skin.This is a shopping day for you remember.I nodded and kissed him once more before making my way to the car.My purse was light from lack of makeup which I conveniently left at home and then my home burst into flames.Add that to my list of things to buy.I hopped into the car and waved at him as he receded back into the house.I looked down at my purse and let out a little laugh.I cant believe he gave me his credit card.I pulled out of the driveway and made my way to the mall.My brain still couldnt wrap around the fact that my place had burnt down.I decided to make a detour and drive by it.When I drove by it was all closed, caution tape thrown everywhere.I could see what was left of my apartment, the bathroom was the only intact area.The living room and kitchen were completely demolished.My breath caught in my throat as I looked at the damage.I was parked in front of the building now, I could see where everything had fallen from lack of support.There were beams and appliances scattered across the front of the building with the caution tape surrounding it.I let out a soft sigh and had to redirect myself back to driving.I eventually made it to the mall, my head still spinning at what had happened the night before.I noticed Shaunas car and smiled as I parked next to it.I grabbed my purse and looked over at her, she was sitting on the hood of her car.That isnt very lady like you know.Men could see up your skirts.She just laughed as we walked into the mall.So he gave me his credit card.She let out a shrill laugh and stopped me.Seriously?No limit?She raised her eyebrows and I shook my head no.Does he have a friend?Damn.We both laughed as we walked through the mall.We went into a clothing store and I made my way to the back where the dress clothes were.Oh, I got you this.She pulled a picture out of her purse and handed it to me.It was my wedding picture I had kept by my bed.I stroked Brians face and smiled up at her.Thanks.She just nodded knowing that I didnt want to talk about it.Well I mean there is always Oct.I smirked and grabbed a few pairs of pants and began looking at shirts.Octavius.She said in a deep voice.He sounds like a soldier though.He kind of is a whore though.I mean every time I see him he has some other bimbo.She made a face at me as I grabbed a black dress.We made our way to the fitting room and tried the clothes on.I mean that is good though?He trusts I am not going to spend a lot of money, or if I did spend a lot he doesnt mind paying it off?I looked out of the dressing room but didnt see Shauna.Shauna?A red and black lace lingerie set was thrown in my face.What is this?I exclaimed and took it.Well I mean you need to say thank you somehow.Why not this way?Her lips were twitched up into a smirk.I hesitantly looked at it.It did look nice.There was a lace bra, very thin, with puffy white feathers lining around the bust.The thong attached looked the same, each with a design of black ribbon.Come on.Do it for him.She snatched it back and threw it into the cart along with the other clothes we tried on.Letting out a deep sigh I caved.Okay.But that is it.I swallowed quietly and looked over at her.Did you see the apartment?It is horrid.She nodded as we walked through the store to the checkout.I cant believe that lady on the fourth floor did this!Well I mean it isnt her fault but it came from her apartment.Do you need to stay over?Shauna asked looking at me intently.No.Rex said I can stay there.She laughed a little and hit my shoulder.I am going to try okay?I have been there a lot anyway.Okay.You better not...Fuck it up.Thanks mother.I cut her off and smiled.We had reached the cash registers and our things had been rung through.I hesitated at the total price and gave Shauna a look.She nodded and I slid the card through it.Thank you Rex it chimed and asked for a signature.I signed his name effortlessly.Already forging his name, how great.Shauna smiled and we put our clothes into the cart.Where to now?I asked looking down the long hallway of the mall.We had made our way into the makeup store, the department store for bedding and such, three more clothing stores and a mens department store.What about this one?She held up a black button up shirt.I put my hand to my chin and shook my head no.He is super picky.We were trying to find an outfit for Rex.We were supposed to go out to dinner in a few days and I had a bunch of clothes so I wanted to get him an outfit.We had found some major cute black faded jeans, green converse and now we were debating on a shirt.I grabbed a sweater vest and held it up.I could tackle him into this one?Wouldnt he look cute?I looked down at the blue argyle sweater.He wasnt one for color but maybe he would let me put him in color.I threw it into our pile and smirked.My phone began to ring and I picked it up.Hello?There was a shuffling noise on the other end and then to my surprise Octavius voice filled the other end.Hey its Oct.I was wondering what you guys were doing tonight?I need to talk to the two of you.Nothing I can think of.He said he had a few appointments and that was all.When is his last one?A shuffling of papers filled the receiver once more and he made a clicking noise with his tongue.Two.Okay.Let him know I called alright?Yeah no problem.I hung up the phone and Shauna stared wide eyed at me.Yes that was Oct.His voice is so sexy!I cant believe you havent let me meet him yet!She exclaimed and I glanced at the time.We should go huh?Yeah, I have to tell Rex we have to go to Octavius place.Oh well.Want to help me bring this to the car?She nodded and we made our way to the car.The trunk popped open and I filled the whole trunk with bags.I cant believe I bought all this stuff.He is going to kill me.He said you had no limit.I doubt he will kill you.She smiled and hugged me.Ill see you tomorrow okay?I nodded and climbed into my car.By the time I made it home Rex had already beat me.His car sat in the driveway, steam still escaping from the hood.I only took a few bags in so he wouldnt be mad at how much I spent.I opened the door and threw the keys into the bowl.Babe?I called out and set the bags on the floor.Im home.He walked out of the bathroom and smiled at me.Hey.you.He was wearing camouflage cut offs and shirtless.I was beginning to love how he never wore his shirt.His tattoos always shone so brightly in the dim lit house.I noticed a new tattoo on his side, the skin still glistening and wet from just being done.He noticed me looking at it and held up his arm.Scrawled across his ribcage was To err is human.I like it.I smiled.He nodded and wrapped his arms around me and gave me a kiss.Yeah?I thought it was pretty good.He glanced down at the bags of clothes and then back up at me, pure horror on his face.Shit I bought too much!That isnt all you bought right?If that is all you got we are going back out right now.No I got more.I smiled and he raised an eyebrow.I promise!I squealed as he picked me up.Oh my god put me down Rex!Dont drop me!I clung to his body and squeezed my eyes shut.I swear if you drop me youre dead!A low guttural laugh escaped his lips as he walked around and plopped me on the bed.I opened my eyes as his lips swooped in and pressed themselves against mine.Our bodies connected and slowly I let myself fall back onto the bed.In between kisses he was talking to me I realized.With a low noise from me he repeated them.Did you have fun?I nodded in between kisses.Oct needs us over asap apparently.He called me while shopping, it must be dramatic.I smiled and he nodded.His large hands slid their way around my waist and hoisted me up against him.The breath left my body as our bodies touched.I shifted my hands down along his tattoos, tracing them like I so often did.I accidentally touched his new one and I felt him stiffen alongside me.Sorry.I whispered but before I could speak again his mouth was on mine.I felt myself surrendering to him, completely letting go.One hand slid down my leg and up my inner thigh.My body was suddenly filled with shivers.I could feel the hair on my arms stand on end from the sensation.His kisses were growing deeper, more concentrated.His tongue was playing alongside mine and slowly working its way down to my neck.His teeth drifted along my skin to my collar bone.The phone began to ring.I let out a small gasp as his teeth bit down on my skin.I went to reach for the phone but he grabbed my wrists and held them above my head.He looked up at me, his eyes stormy but vivid.I stopped trying to get free and closed my eyes.My hair fell down around my shoulders and his lips returned to my neck.Small noises escaped from me, I had no control but I didnt want control either.We danced around each other in a way I hadnt experienced before.He would touch here and I would feel it there.He would whisper one thing and I would hear something else.It was intoxicating, breathtaking.I let out a whimper as he filled me, made me whole again.I always felt tears well up in my eyes and the breath caught in the back of my throat from the feeling of being wanted and loved.I had realized this was love, not lust.Lust fades out and love doesnt.It had been eight steamy months filled with so much passion that it made up for the four years of lacking that.Here I was, wrapped around a man I had been searching for forever.A man to fill that void that filled me.He spoke into my ear, his voice rough but my body ached for it.Everything about him I wanted, needed.He let out a low groan and I felt it coming soon, this moment in time I wish I could just pause and live in it forever.The feeling of him within me, of his arms around me, his lips against mine and the emotions rising within me.I came first, moaning loudly as I buried my face into his chest.I scratched down his back and felt him follow soon after.Our bodies hefted together, sweat stained our backs and foreheads.I felt at peace, relaxed and above all completely happy.He rolled himself off me and pulled me close against him.I laid my head on his chest.I love you.I whispered but then realized was it too early to say that?I had been so caught up in being happy it had just escaped me!I love you too.He said after a seconds hesitation and I looked up at him to make sure he meant it.His eyes were a violent blue and he kissed my forehead.I love you Anya.He repeated and I felt my body fall into a state of sleep, blissful sleep.Octavius had a huge house, more like a mansion.It was set back from the road with a iron wrought fence.The massive structure lifted off the ground to reveal four floors.There was a large red door with various studs lined across it.There were four steeples stretching up the sides of the house with a huge stained glass window at the top in an oval shape.It was just a bunch of splashes of color, nothing distinct.It looked like one of those eerie mansions from a horror movie to be honest.The siding was cracked and some pieces needed to be redone.Surrounding the windows were what had once been window boxes but only two remained.Each steeple had a large circular window on it and three windows in between all spread out.If that makes you worried dont keep reading.The inside was worse.Rex took my hand and we walked up to the large red doors.They looked like they were made of felt.Oct opened the door and hugged Rex.He was wearing a white shirt with blue paint splattered all over and jeans that matched.Repainting?Rex asked but was only responded by Octavius deep laugh.His voice in general was deep and masculine but his laugh was even deeper.Dont even let me say hi to the lady, just comment on my attire?What kind of behavior is that Rex?I was pulled into a hug.I reluctantly hugged Octavius back.He gave me a look and then looked over at Rex and whispered something to him.What?I crossed my arms across my chest.I had changed into a long black dress with one strap that went behind my neck and across my chest.This is what he told me to wear!I exclaimed hoping I wasnt wearing the wrong thing.Octavius just laughed and motioned us into the house.Did I wear the wrong thing?I asked looking at Rex.He was wearing the outfit I had bought him earlier.No it is perfect.Oct just isnt used to seeing women dressed up.He leaned in close and whispered into my ear.He is used to seeing them naked.I couldn't help but stifle a laugh.Rex wrapped his arm around me as I gaped at the house.When you first walked in there was a magnificent staircase winding up towards the second floor.The railings were carved and there was a bright red runner that went up each side of the staircase.Massive paintings filled the walls like in Rexs house.The largest painting was one of a soldier.He had black hair about shoulder length and what looked like the beginning of a beard.His body was extremely buff, his arm looked like it had a large gash in the side of it along with a tattoo spiraling down it.Next to it was another large painting, but this one was of some sort of whale.Both paintings were mesmerizing but eventually Rex pulled me away.We followed a long hallway that opened up to a ballroom.I looked over at Rex with an eyebrow raised.The ballroom was a huge open area with three chandeliers hanging around the ceiling.The ballroom looked like what I would imagine a palaces ballroom would be.The floor had an interesting design on it.The middle had a large mask much like the one Rex had on his chest.That looks like yours.I spoke quietly and looked up at Rex.Its a long story.Dont worry.We walked through the middle of the ballroom.The lights dazzled above us.I felt like a kid in a candy store, this place was beautiful.There were multiple hallways branching off of the ballroom.We took one that had a carving of a mask over it.The other ones had random objects, a circle with a star on the inside, a fish, a ring and a fire.I squeezed Rexs hand tighter as we ascended towards some stairs.It was a spiral staircase, the ones that usually make me feel dizzy.We went up the stairs which opened up to another large room.There was a Persian rug splayed on the floor, two couches back to back and a row of chairs.There were five people sitting around in a circle.I recognized Krystie immediately.She had cut her hair shorter and dyed it black but I knew it was her.They all shouted hellos and Rex and I sat down next to Octavius at what I assumed was the head of the table.There was a small man sitting across and to the right of me.His face was oval with hazel eyes.He had black hair that reached just above his shoulders.He was wearing a baggy white shirt and tight black pants.He had a small nose and almond shaped eyes.Next to him was Krystie.Next to Krystie was a girl dressed heavily in goth clothes.She had black baggy trip pants, a black wife beater and a shirt on top of that that was made of fishnets.She had straight black hair and choppy bangs.Her eyeliner elongated her eyes, making them look catlike with brilliant blue eyeshadow.Next to her was another girl, small in stature but taller than the goth girl.She had plain brown hair longer than mine.Her skin was pale but her eyes were a magnificent sea foam green color.Last in the group was a tall man with olive skin.He had high cheekbones and a chiseled jawline.His brown hair just barely graced his eyes and he had a goatee.I looked over at Rex for some explanation but he simply smiled and looked over at Octavius.Hello and how are all of you doing?Octavius began.Most of them nodded and I looked around the room again.I could feel their stares on me and I shrunk back in my chair.Please welcome Anya.The goth girl waved but everyone else stayed still.Hi.I whispered and looked around the room.Krystie looked unimpressed with me as she crossed her arms and leaned back in her chair.Well Anya, this is the clan.That is Haku, Krystie, Cleo, Violet and Enrique slash Gabriel.I raised an eyebrow at Enrique but he shook his head.You will see eventually senorita.He winked and spoke with a thick Spanish accent.I nodded and smiled a friendly smile at him.This is The Tainted and we are immortal.Rex said calmly next to me.It took me by surprise and I laughed out loud.I bet you are.He looked at me with a stern look and I stopped speaking.We all have our stories and I have been with you long enough now that I want you to know about my real life.He turned towards me and took my hands in his.I am immortal.I can not die.I looked around nervously, everything inside me was bustling with questions.Okay so he was immortal?So you are telling me I am going to grow old and die and you will stay this age?It was the only question I could fathom together to ask.I saw Krystie out of the corner of my eye laugh.That is if he stays with you.Octavius shot her a death look and she silenced.Okay...How does one become immortal?My voice squeaked at the end.It was too much to handle so I was taking it one step at a time.Why did he want to do this is front of everybody?Couldnt he have told me at home?I was so frustrated and upset with him and holding it in.It was the goth girl who spoke next.Im Cleo.Come with me.She held her hand out and I looked hopelessly at Rex.He nodded and smiled.I took her hand and we walked down to another room split off from the group room.It is hard to think of, I know.It will be okay though.Rex has never brought any of his girlfriends here before so he must really like you.She seemed extremely bubbly despite her goth demeanor.So I dont understand.Immortal?There is no such thing.You die and life moves on.I spoke quietly.The group had begun talking up a storm, no doubt deciding a better name.The Tainted?What did that even mean?Well it is a long story and we each have our own.Do you want to hear mine?She smiled and her eyes seemed to sparkle.There was a bench in the far corner and I walked over to it, sitting down and letting my brain process this information.I nodded to her and she began.Well my mother was Cleopatra.That is why my name is Cleo.She giggled and I gave her the strangest look.Cleopatra?She died forever ago, no way this girl could be her daughter.Anyway, so she was married quite a bit, and this one time she fell in the wrong hands and got pregnant.A lot of people wanted her dead though so she had to keep it hidden that she was pregnant.Once she had me there was a priest who found out and cursed me.Her voice had risen with excitement.She was happy she was cursed?What the heck.I was cursed to live the life of immortality, to see my mother fail.To see empires rise and fall.You must understand we all stop growing at a different age.I am the youngest in the group and Octavius is the oldest.She was the youngest looks wise.She barely looked 17.That is my story.I am sure everyone will tell you theirs in time.Be careful of Krystie though.I looked over at the group through the open door and noticed she had taken the seat I had been in.What is her beef?I looked back at Cleo and she was laughing.They used to be something.When Krystie first came to Tainted they thought the other was amazing.Then he realized she wasnt.She is just an arrogant brat who thinks she can get whatever she wants.She leaned in closer and whispered to me.She really hates that you took him.She then burst out laughing.I nodded quietly, still processing everything.So he is going to watch me die isnt he?I said in a shaky voice.
