Natalia walked in slowly.You wanted to see me?Bryan didnt crack a smile.He was fuming.Not only was he a fornicator, now he was an adulterer.But, he was happy to have a good reason to end the whole thing.Youre married?And you didnt think that was important for me to know?What if your husband found out?Natalia waved her hand towards him and shook her head.Its no big deal.We barely even have sex.Im not in love with him or anything.Natalia Philips, you have some nerve.I cant believe you.You act as if I should be fine with you being married, like marriage doesnt mean anything to you.Thats not cool with me.Ive never been into married women.I dont need that kind of drama.Now, get out of my office and dont come back unless its work related.She walked up closer to him and rubbed her hand down his chest.Baby, you dont mean that.Ill leave him if you want.I want to be with you.He pushed her hands away from him.Theres no need.Were done.Ive moved on.Now, if you would, please leave so I can get some work done.He sat at his desk and started working as if she wasnt still standing there.She kept staring, hoping to draw his attention.Bryan refused to engage her.Exasperated, she huffed, then turned and left his office.6  Ooooooh, girl!Somebody is working hard to get your attention.Monica said as she noticed a new bouquet of flowers sitting in the break room.This is the tenth day in a row the man has sent you flowers.Im jealous.Mon, please.Ashlee pulled her friend to the side in an attempt to stop her from drawing more attention to herself.There were four other CNAs sitting around chatting.Can you stop talking so loud?Monica looked over Ashlees shoulder clearly ignoring her plea.He sent lunch too, girl!Is it the lawyer from church?Oooooh, it has a note.What does it say?Everyone in the break room looked on.Ashlee turned her back to them as she read the note.She tried to hide her smile.You like him dont you?Monica teased.Oh my goodness, Mon, please.This is so embarrassing.Girl, please.Aint nobody else gettin' no kind of attention.Give us somethin to talk about.Ashlee sighed.Fine.Its just his phone number.He says since I wont have a meal with him, will I at least call and let him know if Ive received the flowers.Thats all.Ashlee tried with all of her might to downplay her emotions.Truthfully, Bryan was the first person to ever show her this much attention and shed never received flowers from anybody.If thats all, then why are you over there with that Kool Aid smile?Tamia, one of the CNAs, said.Ashlee playfully rolled her eyes and headed towards the door.Oooh, yall are so nosy.Monica ran and caught up to her friend.Whats goin on, girl?You know we have to tease you.Why wont you talk to the guy?Ashlee stopped walking and leaned against the wall.I dont know.He seems nice enough, but Im at a really good place right now.Im getting closer with God.My children are doing well.And, Im just now learning to really know myself.Besides, with as much time as I spend at this nursing home, I dont have time to try and start a new relationship.Well, Monica said with a mischievous grin.If you hook up with the lawyer, you wont have to spend so much time at this place.You said he goes to church right?So yall can grow in God together.Ashlee thought about Bryan often since he approached her two weeks ago.She had a hard time trusting men.She could recall two things her father did for her.He taught her to drive and gave her a few hundred dollars when she first moved out.She couldnt rely on her dad to be there for her when she needed him.She sure couldnt depend on her childrens father.As far as she was concerned, she didnt need a man in her life.She would do just fine with Jesus, herself, and her children.Plus, she didnt exactly trust his motives.Mama Esther had told her she wasnt sure if he was fully delivered yet, and she really valued her opinion.I dont know.Ashlee looked down at her feet.Look at me.Why would he want to give somebody like me a second look?All of my clothes are second hand or over two years old.Im a nursing assistant with two children.What do I have to offer a lawyer?Id be stupid to think there was a real future there.First of all, Monica said, youre over thinking this.He just wants a date.And two, she grabbed Ashlee by the arm and pulled her into the bathroom, turning her towards the mirror, look at you.You are freaking flawless.You have this amazing milk chocolate skin.You eat like a horse and can still wear a size two and thats after having two babies.Youre a CNA, yes.Its your job.Something youre doing to survive.Its not who you are.Youre one of the smartest people Ive ever met.You can do anything you set your mind to.And twowait, She counted her fingers.One, two, yeah three, judging by the way hes going out of his way to get your attention, I would say he sees what we all see.Monica stopped and watched Ashlees expression.She was taking in everything Monica said.So what are you going to do?You should at least call the man and tell him thank you.I mean he did send you a dozen flowers every day for the past two weeks.Ashlee thought for a while.I guess its kind of rude not to.I might call him tonight after I get the kids settled.Good.7  Hey, Mama.How are you?Bryan asked as he walked into his mothers kitchen.Im blessed, highly favored, and greatly beloved.Bethel Hunter gave her son the side eye.And Im also smart enough to know you didnt drive way down here to see how I am.Now, what is it you want?Bryan smiled.Im hurt.Boy, please.Gon over there and grab that bag of peas and put it on the table while I go and take care of something.Bryan watched his mom scurry out of the room as if she was up to something.Bethel was actually right when she said she knew he wanted something.Why else would he drive thirty minutes into the country on a Saturday afternoon?He usually saved his visits for Sunday.He really came out there to fish for information about Ashlee.Hed found out that on her days off Ashlee, her children, and Mother Johnson often spent the day at his parents home.He was hoping today was one of those days.He also wanted to know if Ashlee had been asking about him.He shook his head at the thought of running to his mother for information about a girl.He felt like a shy schoolboy with a crush.Wheres Dad?Bryan yelled out to his mom who was in her bedroom with the door shut.Out back.She yelled.After talking with his dad for almost an hour, Bryan went in to say goodbye to his mom.When he walked inside, she had company.Hi, Mother Johnson.Its good to see you.He gave her a hug and turned to his mom.Ill see you in the morning at church.Mother Johnson patted Bryans back.Now, where are you running off to?I just got here.No need to rush off.Have a seat.We need to talk wit you about something.I hear youre looking at Ashlee.Bryan raised an eyebrow.I knew it.She must have gone to her bedroom and called Mother Johnson to come over here.He decided to play with them a bit.Ashlee who?Alright, dont you start lying.You know who and what Im talking about.She told me about the flowers.Now look a here, that girl has been through enough in her little life.She dont need you coming around if you not serious.Shes a good girl.Sure, shes made some mistakes.But, she done got saved and shes doing fine.Bryan had a lot of respect for his mom and Mother Johnson.He didnt say anything.He sat back and listened.Now, Ashlee has become like a daughter to me, and to your mama here.You just make sure before you start trying to court her that you got marriage on your brain and not something else.You hear?Yes maam.I hear you.During the drive back home, Bryan thought back to the conversation hed had with his mom and Mother Johnson.If Mother Johnson knew about the flowers that meant Ashlee had thought about him enough to mention it.He still hadnt heard from her, but at least he was on her mind so that gave him a little hope.8  Bryans black Camry was the first car in the parking lot that Sunday.He was determined to get there early and catch Ashlee before service began.Before he left his moms the night before, he caught a glimpse of the nursery schedule and learned this was Ashlees Sunday to assist.He knew this would be his only chance to see her.After sitting in the lot for twenty minutes, Mother Johnson drove up in her gray Crown Victoria with Ashlee and her children.He jumped out, walked up to the car, and greeted them.He opened the door for Mother Johnson and helped her out.He then proceeded to the other side to open the door for Ashlee.Mother Johnson grabbed Jade from her car seat and motioned for Jordan.Come on, baby.She looked towards Ashlee.Ill take them on inside and sit with them in the nursery until you get in there.Oh, its okay.You dont have to  Its fine, honey.Mama Esther interrupted.Go on and talk to Bryan.She handed Ashlee her car keys.Be sure to lock the car fore you come in and dont stay out here too long.The last part was for Bryan.She gave him a serious look as if to say remember our talk.Ashlee stepped out of the car in a red fitted pencil skirt and black blouse with three inch black pumps Monica had talked her into wearing.She didnt have anything really nice and modern, so shed borrowed it from her.Shed finally admitted to Monica she was attracted to Bryan, but was embarrassed for him to see her in clothes shed gotten from Goodwill so Monica helped her put the outfit together and made her practice walking in heels.
