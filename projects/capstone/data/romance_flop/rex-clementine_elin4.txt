Well there is two things he can do.If you do love him you can become immortal but you will be his.If you were to not love him you would die no matter what age you are.Or he can become mortal, leave this group and live his life starting at the age he is.What age is he?Really old.He looks 32 though.That is what he tells everyone.We lose count of our real age after a century or so.I nodded quietly and contemplated bombarding her with questions.Cleopatra.I spoke breathlessly.Yeah.She was one hell of a woman.She smiled a kind smile and looked at me.Dont worry I will keep you safe from Krystie.You always have to watch Violet.They are buddies.Their mothers are alike.What do you mean?Well I promised them I wouldnt tell you.She held up her hand in a scouts honor pose.Promise you wont tell them?I put my hand up without thinking and nodded.Well Krysties mom is Hera.Do you know who she was?She was Zeus wife.She was known for going and sleeping with mortals though.She whispered the last part.Violets mom is Eris.The goddess of discord.See how they are almost related?I nodded and looked back at the group.What is Octavius?Is he a soldier?Yep.His story is pretty messed up.His mother went to Ares, the God of War, to ask for the return of her husband who was in the army.Ares said that he would only help if she would devote herself to him.So she did and she ended up pregnant.Lets just say she didnt last long with the Gods and didnt see her husband again.I slowly turned my head over at her with a sad expression on my face.That is a horrible story.I whispered.Cleo crossed her legs and leaned back in the bench.I told you.She let out a long sigh.Do you want to know the rest of the stories?She asked eagerly and I nodded.Okay well.Her voice seemed light, bouncing around the room.Hakus story is kind of confusing.There are these things called Kappas.They are huge lizard like creatures.They are trouble makers but must be polite if you are polite to them first.So pretty much there was this woman who was Hakus mother and she saw a Kappa.She was a priestess so she knew what to do.She bowed and Kappas have these bowl looking things on their heads.If they bow and the water escapes they are stuck there!If someone puts water in it they have to practically be your slave though.She laughed and I nodded silently, fixated by these stories.So she filled it and yeah.They have a cute story.I looked back at the group talking with each other.I caught Rexs look and smiled at him.He gave a quick smile and continued with the group.Whos next?I felt myself saying even before I thought it.So Haku, Krystie, Violet, Octavius have been done so that leaves Enrique.He has a pretty long story as well.He had an older brother Gabriel, well half brother if you want to be specific.Gabriel was immortal, born from the God Mextli who controlled war and storms.Gabriel is the only person ever in time to die while immortal.Nobody knows how he did it, not even him.Wait.You just said he died so how would he be able to talk or think?I questioned.She raised her hand in approval.That is where it gets weird.When he died his soul connected with his brothers.Every now and then he will pop out and talk.It is kind of weird.You will be able to tell who is who though.Enrique is a total player and prick but Gabriel is wicked sweet.Her cheeks turned pink and her face lit up.She must have had a crush on him.Must be a pain he is stuck in Enrique huh?I asked and she shook her head.Thats all of them.She whispered.I cant tell you Rexs story.He will tell you in his own time.It took him forever to tell us even.How did you guys form a group?What does The Tainted even mean?I questioned and ran my hand through my hair.So many questions were filtering up through my mouth.We have an annual ball.It is tonight actually.She giggled.That is probably why he brought you.We seem to have an unnatural ability to find other Immortals.Unnatural?Being immortal was unnatural.We call ourselves the Tainted because our blood is tainted.Our blood has been mixed with Gods and mortals.We were going to go for an artistic name like Painted Gods, but Krystie didnt like it which meant Violet didnt like it.So we decided on the Tainted.We dont quite understand the limits of our immortality but it has something to do with our blood.If you become immortal it will run through your veins too.How do you become immortal?I looked over at her.Her face still shone with brilliance at all of the questions.At least someone would tell me.Rex had kept it hidden almost 9 months!There is a ceremony.You get a tattoo along with him.It binds you two together.I nodded and looked at the group.Each one had a visible masquerade mask.Is it the mask one?I looked at her.She was wearing too many long clothes to see hers.She nodded and pulled her leg up to reveal a mask on her ankle.It was painted black with a white eye in the shape of a heart.It was only half of a mask with a stick attached.Each person has a different one.I remembered Rexs on his chest.My mind was still spinning with questions, each one weighing differently in my brain.I stayed quiet for a moment still processing everything.Eventually I spoke in a quiet hushed voice.What happens if I wanted kids?The look across her face came off as confused.Many people I assumed didnt worry about that I guessed.They will live life normally.The only way for them to be immortal is a long process involving talking to the elders.She looked over at me, her eyes wide.Are you pregnant?You cant go through the immortal summoning if you are.No, goodness no.I smiled a reassuring smile.To be honest I had no clue.When was I supposed to have my period?That was the least of my problems as of yet.I looked over at the room and everyone was getting up and walking away.I stood up as Octavius and Rex walked into where we were.Thanks for taking care of her Cleo.He smiled and she nodded.No probs.I smiled at her as she left with Octavius.Rex took my arm and led me back to the bench.I know it is a lot to take in.Please dont be mad at me for not telling you.His voice was sincere, taking my mind off track for a minute.I dont expect Hey Im immortal on a first date..I bit the inside of my lip.If that counts as a date.I mentioned.He laughed and took my hand in his.So I suppose she told you how this works?I looked up at him.His face looked so even and calm.I couldnt even spot a wrinkle if I stared.Oh maybe a little one off of his eye but people called those smile lines now.I couldnt take my face away from his and I nodded.Are you asking me to become immortal or are you going to join my side?I raised an eyebrow at him.He moved closer on the bench and brushed his hand through my hair.I dont know yet.Would you pick one if I asked?I bit the inside of my lip again and looked up at him.His stormy blue eyes were so bright they looked like they should be in the sky with puffy clouds surrounding them.I think I would.I dont know which one yet though.I held my breath and looked up to see satisfaction on his face.Would you though?His lips met mine and I knew in that minute he would.He would give up immortality to be with me.Either that or he would share an immortal life with me.I felt a tear slide down my cheek and his finger caught it before it fell off.No crying.This is supposed to be happy.He whispered as his hand wrapped itself around mine.I know.I said feeling childish.I am happy.Good.Remember I told you that you were different?He stroked my cheek and I nodded.I think its because I never felt this kind of love before.He leaned forward and kissed my lips ever so gently.I love you.I love you too.I smiled and noticed someone standing in the doorway.What lovebirds!Senorita why you no want me?It was Enrique.I smiled and looked at Rex for support.You want everyone Enrique!Enrique made a noise and left.Rex laughed and pulled me up into his arms.So there is this thing I need to tell you.He rubbed the back of his head.That there is a party of some sort and that is why you made me dress up without even telling me?I hit his shoulder playfully.Yeah pretty much.But you look amazing.He looked down my body and I felt modest.I crossed my arms and arched an eyebrow.You do.You must wear this though.He held up a black lace masquerade mask with butterfly wings on each side.I let out a small gasp as he took it out from behind his back.It is part of the tradition.Everyone must wear a mask.He pulled a mask down over his eyes.It was a white porcelain looking mask with black marks on it just like on his tattoo.Yours matches your tattoo.He nodded and his eyes seemed to sparkle through the holes in the mask.Everyone's match.You dont have one so I made one up for you.I touched the fragile wings, their colors electric against the black lace.Do you like it?He whispered closer to my ear than before he had managed to wrap his arms around me he pulled me close against him.He smiled and kissed me gently as I looked around at the other members.They had all dressed up as well and were wearing masks.Cleo was wearing a long black dress that had a very long train on it.Her mask looked identical to her tattoo mask.Her makeup was still heavy but her hair was down in small ringlets around her shoulders.Haku was wearing what I assumed to be a traditional Japanese outfit.He was wearing a white shirt with a long sleeved shirt over it but it was unbuttoned.There was a skirt looking piece also.It started white at the top and leaked into black at the bottom.His mask was bright blue with yellow outlining the eyes.There were Japanese symbols around the mask, none of which I knew well enough to know what they meant.His hair had been swept back and looked shiny but not a bad shiny.Krystie and Violet almost looked the same.Krystie had a bright red dress with a plunging neckline.The back was low also and formed a V shape.The red dress looked as if it was satin and hugged her body tightly.Every move she made the dress followed.Violet was wearing a dress that was deep blue with the same back but lace covered where her back would normally be showing.Krysties hair was piled on top of her head and her mask was bright red like her dress.There was an elegant design on one side yet the other side was plain.Violets hair was half up and the rest fell freely around her shoulders.Her mask was only half a mask, only covering one eye.It was splattered with colors, like someone had splatter painted it.Enrique had disappeared for a while but now returned with a plain white mask.It had a black border around it but that was all.He looked like a pirate to be honest.He had a ruffle white shirt on with tight black pants and black boots.He was also wearing a large hat with a feather sticking out of the side that looked like a Captains hat.I shrugged and looked up at Rex.He let out a low laugh and pulled me to the others.Octavius walked out of a distant room in a black tux.His mask matched Rexs but on the opposite side.My dont we all look lovely?Now remember the rules.Shall we go?His calm voice washed over me and I felt myself relax a bit.I still couldnt wrap my head around the fact that I was the only mortal in the room until I saw Shauna walk out and stand next to Octavius.My jaw practically hit the floor.Say what?She waved at me and smiled up at Oct.She was wearing a long pale blue dress with a long slit up the leg and only one shoulder strap.Her high heels clicked on the hardwood floor as she walked over to me.Dont even start.If you can sleep around so can I.  She giggled and hugged me.I dont sleep around anymore.Octavius?Come on Shauna.I told you he is a player.I embraced her back and let out a soft sigh.Maybe that is what I want tonight.She whispered and squeezed my shoulders.Have fun.She walked back over to Oct and he took her arm in his.Dont worry about her.Rexs voice caught me off guard and I gave him a quizzical look.She will be fine.He pulled me alongside him as the group went down the stairs.About halfway down the stairs I could hear the pounding of music and the smell of alcohol mixed with food.My stomach gurgled and I realized I hadnt eaten much.As we walked down the stairs I held onto Rexs arm tightly for fear of falling in these damn heels.I wasnt one for high heels and of course that is what he made me wear.When I looked up the ballroom had been totally redone while we were upstairs.There were people swarmed on the floor and different colored lights streaming across the walls along with speakers.There was a large table filled with drinks and every type of food you could think of.Everyone was dressed up in formal wear and masks.Some people had elegant masks with various feathers protruding from them.Others had simple black masks.There were what felt like millions of people.The ballroom was filled with voices chattering and the deep bass from the music.I held onto Rex tighter as the group dispersed into the crowd.Just stay with me.I will keep you safe.He whispered into my ear.I nodded and wondered what kind of party this was exactly.This is a party for every clan of Immortals within the world.The Tainted is only one of many.He whispered and explained the differences in masks.Masks that were over the top with feathers or paintings meant that they were elders or they were the leaders of the group.Octavius passed and I realized his mask was much more intricate than I had noticed before which stated he was the leader.The plain black masks, or white, indicated they were the newest members in each clan.Enrique was the newest in The Tainted so his was white.As they grow with the clan they can add things to their mask and once they had been there for a while.I nodded as he whispered all of this in my ear.I didnt notice we had been dancing this whole time.His arms were around me, his breath hot on my neck.So what does my mask mean?I whispered looking at him.A smirk just appeared on his lips and he didnt talk for a while.We simply danced around the room.He twirled me around him, I was surprised I didnt step on his feet numerous times.He pulled me in close and I could feel his hands the bare skin of my back.It means you are mine.He finally spoke.It means that you havent chosen what life you will live but you are with me.Something about him saying that I was his made my heart skip a beat.It made butterflies in my stomach and I couldnt stop smiling.Maybe that was a rude thing to say, no one person is anybodys, but I am pretty sure it made me blush.His lips were on mine before I could respond and it felt like the world had stopped.The lights seemed to slow down.The bass from the music had melted into my heart and was actually my heartbeat.His hands soon found their way around me tighter, one up in my hair and the other resting in the small of my back.I felt a tap on my shoulder and reality crashed back into my face.I opened my eyes and looked to see who had tapped me.There stood Shauna, face bright red and eyes puffy.Shit.I need to talk to you now.She whispered and I gave a helpless look to Rex before being pulled away.He took a few steps towards me but Octavius stood in his way.I was pulled through the crowd and out a side door to a small garden.The garden was eerily quiet with hundreds of flowers sprouting up from the beds.There were two benches sitting alone among the tangle of flowers.She pulled me to one and looked up at me.This is wrong.We cant do this.Do what?I asked appalled to even think she was talking about anything important.Marry them.Or have them be mortals.That is ridiculous.Cant we just be people?Live in a normal life?What are you talking about?I cut her off.Marry who?What?Explain Shauna.Now.She tilted her head to the side, thinking.He didnt tell you.She bit the inside of her lip and cast a glance down at the ground.Tell me what?I urged and moved closer to her on the bench.Shauna what is wrong?You can tell me.Octavius wants me to be his.She said looking up at me.Her eyes were welled with tears and her cheeks had gone from a pink to a red.He wants me to marry him.I was shocked.Since when was she with Octavius!Whats wrong with that honey?That is fantastic.I smiled and pulled her into a hug.Im scared.He told me about what has to be done to be married.You dont have to marry him.Tell him you arent sure.I coaxed, hoping I was making her feel a little better.I rubbed her back and felt her sobs beneath my hand.Why was she so upset?Had she been told about this before me?A slow anger was swelling up inside of me.I had been dating Rex a lot longer than she had been with him.I let out a soft sigh and looked over at her.Her crying had stopped and her breathing more normal.You okay honey?I whispered and brushed her hair from her face.She nodded and looked over at me.Yeah.What about you?I was kind of taken aback by her question.I looked down at the ground and then but the inside of my lip.How long have you guys been dating?I whispered.We met just after you guys.He had come in for something and asked me where you were.Then it kind of just hit off.I didnt want to let you know because I thought it would be awkward.She paused for a minute.I guess this is more awkward huh?I let out a soft laugh and shook my head.If you are happy that is all I care about.I smoothed the wrinkles from sitting out of my dress and hugged her.No worries okay?She nodded and hugged me back.I could tell she was feeling better already but I didnt want to ask.Are you mad at me?She asked and I burst out laughing.Shauna when was the last time I ever got mad at you?I pushed her shoulder gently and she smiled.I noticed Octavius standing in the doorway.I think you should go talk to Oct.She looked up and her cheeks blushed when they met gazes.She got up and they walked off to a different part of the garden.God she was with Octavius?I still couldnt wrap my mind around it.That was the least of my worries, I still couldnt believe that Rex was immortal!What did that even mean?We had been dating for what seemed like forever and I had been living at his house now.I stopped looking for apartments when he would say everything wrong with each apartment.A smile spread across my face as I thought about him.I needed to focus.Immortal.The Tainted.Marriage.Things kept running through my mind.What if I had become immortal with him?I would live forever.I would have to stay his forever too.Would I be able to live forever?What if he became mortal with me?Would he even want to stay with me?So many questions evaded my mind.Would he even be mortal with me?Would he stay with me?At first I only thought about if our relationship would work.Now I had to worry about becoming immortal or mortal.We had talked about marriage a while ago.He asked what I thought about remarrying but I said I wasnt sure.I wonder if that was a real question or if he was wondering if he should stay with me.I played with the mask in my hands.I had taken it off when Shauna had brought me outside.I played with the feathers and frowned a little as I turned it around in my fingertips.The back of it had a small mark on it.I traced it and smiled as I realized it was Rexs mark.This was the mark he put on his drawings.It was practically his trademark.I felt the wind blow around me and a shiver rippled through my skin.I looked up an and older woman was standing in front of me.I slid my mask on quickly and looked back up at her.She was wearing a long red dress that was plain but hugged her body.Her mask was elegant with huge feathers tapering off of it.Her mask was many different colors but the middle of her mask was bright yellow.Im sorry.I whispered and stood up but her hand was on my shoulder.Sit down.She whispered and smiled.I reluctantly sat down next to her.She was an older woman, possibly in her 50s.She had short brown hair which was straightened and barely hit her shoulders.There were small lines extending from her smile and her eyes were a bright blue like Rexs.I havent met you before.You are with Rex, no?I nodded to the woman and gave her a quick smile.Do forgive me.I am Marjorie.I am the leader of the The Painted.I nodded and realized that meant she was a leader of another group.I straightened my posture a little bit and she laughed.The Painted?I questioned quietly and looked over at her.We are from England.She smiled and I realized she did have a prominent English accent.I guess I didnt realized that immortals could be everywhere.Painted.The Painted?Is there a reason of the name?I raised an eyebrow but it was covered by my mask.A smooth laugh escaped her throat.Lots of reasons but no need for that now.So you and Rex.Will you marry?My mind stopped and I looked over at her with a question in my eye.What did she just ask me?Well darling, he has been on the market for a while and needs a mate.You seem like someone who would make an amazing mate for him.My cheeks blushed and her laugh rang out again.Dont worry hon.It is a good thing.Just dont give up on him okay?Funny that is what my friend says.I whispered and she nodded.Just keep what I said in mind.I went to look at her but she was gone.How did she disappear?These immortals and their crazy ways.I readjusted my mask and made my way back into the house.The music roared through my head and wrapped around my body as I entered the building.The lights flashed in front of me and the crowd appeared.I made my way through the many masked party people until I saw Rex.He was surrounded by the group that had been upstairs earlier.Octavius had been dancing with Shauna, Enrique had been with Cleo and Rex was standing in between them.When he saw me his eyes lit up and he walked over to me.Hey baby.He whispered while he pulled me close against him.Where did you go?I rested my head against his chest as we rocked back and forth to the music.Shauna needed me.I am all yours now though.I smiled up at him as he kissed my forehead.I like the sound of that.All mine.He wrapped his arms around me tighter before resting them on my hips as we rocked back and forth.No matter what had happened earlier this is what I wanted.I wanted to be in his arms, forever and always.Forever.The party swirled past me.Music filled the air and I felt my body relax next to Rex.The night was cold when we went out to take a breather from the music.It seemed like an endless night from the drinking to the eating to the dancing.My hair had turned into a mess, my makeup was running underneath my mask and Rex had sweat dripping down his naked head.He ran his hands through my hair and I could feel the alcohol buzzing throughout my body.My head was cloudy and I kept finding myself giggling at the stupidest things.The bass from the techno roared through my body and sent shivers through my arms.I felt him pull me against him and his lips were on mine.They were hot and full of love.I am not sure if we made it back home or in some random room in Octavius place.His hands roamed all over my body.His lips never left mine with a hot, passionate feel.When I felt his hands on my bare skin my body spun to life.I could feel the need within me and the love shooting out of me.I put my head back as his lips sent shivers down my neck.His lips left small kiss marks down my neck to my collarbone which he nibbled for a little bit as soft noises escaped me.My dress was soon on the floor and I fumbled around to pull his shirt off.His skin glistened from the sweat he had worked up.I forced myself to stop smiling as his lips found their way back to mine.Our bodies touched and I realized I had somehow managed to take off the rest of his clothes.When our bodies touched a spark filled my stomach.My head became a tangled mess of emotions as he touched me.His hands slid their way around my back and pulled me close to him.A moan rose from my throat as I felt his body snake its way down.His tongue glided down the left side of my body.His teeth bit at my hip as they rocked up towards him.I was in such a state of ecstasy.My legs opened voluntarily and his head went to the right place.I held the sheets until my knuckles were white.Rex.I groaned as he slowed down.When he felt my body shaking from the feel of him he began licking again.My back arched and I could feel my heartbeat in my throat.I couldnt feel my hands anymore and released the sheets as he made his way back up to my mouth after a few minutes.I eagerly began kissing him again, our tongues swirling around each other.I could feel he needed me and let him in.His breath was on my mouth, smelling sweetly of flowers and citrus.I scratched down his back as he filled me.The sensation was so pleasing I couldnt bear to hold in a moan.He echoed mine and soon I was sent into a different world.One where no one was ever sad and everyone was in love.It sounded silly but sometimes when it is so amazing you just feel like you have been transported somewhere else.His hands pushed mine above my head.Our fingers interlaced and soon it was over.Our bodies lay in a crumpled, overly satisfied mess.Our breathing was ragged and I couldnt feel anything.Anya.He let out a low moan in my ear and I felt myself smiling.I love you.I love you too.I whispered and wriggled my way closer to him.My head lay on his chest and he had his arms wrapped around me.He rubbed his nose against mine and kissed my forehead.I closed my eyes and just listened to our breathing for a minute before his voice broke in.I love you Anya.He kissed my ear.A lot.He whispered.A smile appeared on my face and I let out a soft laugh.Well I know that.But you dont know how much I love you.I have never thought about giving up immortality for anyone before.I havent even thought about being immortal with anyone.Nobody means what you mean to me.He stroked my cheek and I could feel the blush beneath his touch.I nodded and looked up at his stormy eyes.What is your story?My voice cracked a little as his I began to trace his tattoos again.Why did you join the Tainted?His eyes stayed a stormy color as he kissed my forehead.It is a long story.I nodded and smiled up at him, begging for the truth.He chuckled and nodded.Fine.He readjusted how he was sitting and I scooted closer to him, my eyes wide.My mother is the sister of Joan of Arc.You know who that is right?You people realize I went to school right?I took history.I grumbled and a smile broke out on his face.Okay, love.Anyway, if I wouldnt get interrupted all the time.She went to the Gods for help because Joan was on trial.She figured if she asked someone and told them about all the amazing things Joan did maybe she could get her out of the trial.Unfortunately it didnt work out that way.I was conceived and she trained me at a very young age to stay my own ground and taught me how to fight.There was a small group of children I went to school with and Octavius was in it.At first we hated each other, we would fight all the time.One day I hit him with a rock on the shoulder.It began to bleed but then healed up.We had no clue what it meant and when we asked our mothers they said dont worry about it.We figured out that the same thing happened to me.Eventually our mothers let us know what had happened.We werent normal children, we had a special power.Since we were the only two who had immortality we stuck together, vowing we would stay friends no matter what happened.We didnt hold back from living though.We ended up fighting in a war, I dont remember which one, I have been in too many.If we got shot it took longer for the wound to heal but eventually it would.We wanted to know what this unknown power was and that was when we met the other Immortals.There are quite a few different clans among the world but none in this area so we created our own.Over centuries we slowly formed our group, Haku, Violet, Krystie, Cleo and Enrique.I was so mesmerized by his story I didnt realize that sleep was slowly overtaking me.Why the Tainted?Who made that up?I asked sleepily and I soon felt the comfort of his fingers stroking my hair.Shh.Go to sleep baby.But I have so many questions!I want to know so many things.I whispered.You will have time tomorrow.I promise.I would give up my life for you.I spoke and nuzzled into his shoulder.I would give up immortality for you sweetie.I love you.The blackness overtook me and I knew this would turn into a nightmare.I saw Brian standing on a field.There was tall bright green grass surrounding him.
