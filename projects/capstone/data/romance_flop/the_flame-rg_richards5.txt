Mary laughs with her.Oh, Jilly, Im scared.Im scared and I dont have a reason to be.Mare.Jill takes both of Marys hands in hers.I am here for you.If it works out good, Hooray!If it doesnt, I will catch you before you fall.Trust me and trust yourself.Are you ready?I dont know.One foot in front of the other, Mare, thats all it takes.You can do it.I will be here to help.I guess I have to stop drinking.Yeah, you do.Easy for you to say, Im the one who has to do it.Mary rises and grabs her purse.She exhales a long kept breath.Are you going home tonight?I thought we were talking about you and your problems tonight.All right, Jilly, Ill let it go.Thank you, kind sir.Jill tilts her head to the side, she winks and grins.She looks for Barbara on the dance floor.That slut has found a new man.Lets get out of here.Mary and Jill walk toward the door.Mary walks out and Jill turns around in the doorway.She cups her hands.Hey, whore, were out!Stop it, says Mary, the two of you are just alike.Thats probably why you fight all the time.No, we are not.I am nothing like that whore.I dont know why you like her.I like her for the same reasons that I like you.The two walk down the street back to Marys apartment.11: The Party      Friday evening:      Everyone gathers at the Convention Center for the party to celebrate the Breast Cancer Foundations donation drive success.The men don formal black suits with white ties or bow ties and the women adorn themselves with jewelry and full length gowns.The party has a small ensemble of characters put together as a band that plays opera type music.The tables all have fancy white table clothes with matching napkins displaying the foundations logo: a breast under a magnifying glass.Each table seats at least six guests with the tables nearest the stage area seating ten.These two tables are long and rectangular instead of round like the others and they only have chairs on one side.All the tables have fancy short candleholders in the center featuring three gold candles.The Convention Center is next to the Belmont and you enter by way of an underground tunnel or an overhead catwalk that connects the two buildings.The women finished their day of work and left early to go to the center to change.Jill and Barbara are servers; they negotiated a time and a half deal with Mary by calling the event a work function.If Mary is going to drag them there for security reasons then they will need to be paid accordingly.Though Jill is home with Bert they have not resolved their home life.She wants this to be a night of peace and quiet but with Mrs.Cartwright as her boss she knows it wont be.Mrs.Cartwright greeted them at the entrance three hours before the start of the party with server uniforms and a scowl.Mrs.Cartwright inspects the women donning pink uniforms with white gloves.The uniform is a knee high simple dress with a zipper in the back and pockets by each hip.It has a white collar that buttons in the back and white collars at the sleeves.She pins the symbol of the Breast Cancer Foundation on each of their uniforms above their right breast.She grumbles as Mary, Barbara, and Jill walk in late.She dismisses the others then squares off against the late comers.The guests will start arriving in one hour.Your job is to walk around the room with trays providing them with whatever they need.You three will probably spill drinks over everyone so none of you will carry drinks.Mrs.Belmont told me to inform you that if any of you are seen with alcohol or if you even smell of alcohol you will be fired immediately.Is that clear?she scowls at all three.Why is she directing her comments solely at them?They nod.The presentations will last three hours with different speakers taking the podium.You will remain on your feet and out front the whole time.Dinner will begin at 8 oclock sharp followed by a dance; you will stay in uniform for the dinner.Those are your trays over there.Jane and Alex Shaver will give you your instructions after you get your trays.Now lets go into the main room.They walk without talking.Mrs.Cartwright continues, Do not talk to any of the guests while you are serving.If asked a question, say as little as possible.Do not stay in one spot, your job is to move around the room so you will be close if someone needs something.Do not be rude or hostile to any guest or you will be fired.And for those of you with loose morals, she turns to scowl at Jill and Barbara then at Mary, you will not at any time flirt with any guest.Do your job and keep moving, now go report to Jane and Alex for your assignments.Mrs.Cartwright goes to the stage area and the women return to the kitchen.The three women hold trays as the guests filter into the room.Some take snacks from the trays while others pass by ignoring them.Mary and her girls agree that they are all snobs.The orchestra plays nonstop and servers move around the tables like mice in a maze.Half the guests sit while the rest stand talking.Mary positions herself by the door with her tray to service those entering the room.Her smile is as thick as Mrs.Cartwrights who greets a couple from Barcelona that own a chain of hotels and restaurants.Mary gawks at the womans impressive dress.She tallies the cost at a minimum of $20,000 and the necklace at an easy $250,000.Mary gives praise for her sobriety, she would surely spill something on the designer dress and be fired and sued all at the same time.Though she is thankful, Mary wants a drink to calm her nerves.Her hands grow wet with perspiration which leads to the jitters, she blames it on the white gloves she wears.After the couple passes Mary faces her next challenge: Robert Tyler.He stands in the doorway tall and handsome wearing a black tuxedo with a white shirt and white bow tie.Robert greets Mrs.Cartwright, Good evening.Good evening, we have numbered place settings; please find your seat, we will begin shortly.Thank you.Robert moves past her to the server.He sees that it is Mary.He views her tray, smiles, and walks past her into the room to greet others.Marys heart sinks, a cold response, wow.Her tray shakes in her hand before she silences it.She prays no one sees and scans the room as Robert walks away.Her mouth forms a giant O as he approaches her friend.She and Jill have the same tray of snacks but he passes by her without so much as a word.Lost in thought, Mary smiles and nods as a guest takes something from her tray.It snaps her back.Mrs.Cartwright is still at her side but now frowning.Looking at her tray, Mary rushes to the kitchen to refill it and return as fast as she can.Jilly, whispers Mary as they pass in the main room on her way back, come here.They retreat to a corner.Whats up?Jill replies while twisting the pink cancer ribbon on her uniform.Mary points at Robert, thats him over there talking with the old couple.Jill looks where Mary points to see three people talking.Robert has his back to her so she waits until he turns.Not a bad looking man.You got taste, Mare.I dont know.He passed by me and didnt take anything off my tray but took something from yours later.Jill thinks back to earlier and says, Yeah right, oh Mare, close up he is a doll.Dont let him get away from you and watch out for Barbara, you know she is going to be all over the single men tonight.Barb likes his friend.I havent seen him here tonight.Ill go and ask Barb  Get back out here and do your jobs!Mrs.Cartwright rushes over to break up the happy gossiping couple.The old woman gritted her teeth in what she thought resembled a smile.I swear to god if this night goes bad because of the two of you, I will have your heads.Mary and Jill move from the corner and begin circling the room with their trays.They walk throughout the presentations, circling the back of the room as if vultures ready to feast on those lulled to sleep by dull speakers.Then, the unthinkable happensone of the guests demands an item only found on Mary and Jills tray.Mrs.Cartwrights face tightens, her color reddens.The thin smile she wears is not enough to cover her disdain.With a bigger smile she motions the drudgery forward.Slowly the girls advance to the two head tables: the highest donors.Marys boss, Mrs.Belmont, sits at the table with her husband.The surprise is Robert and his friend, Jerry Carpenter, who made the request.Mrs.Cartwright draws blood from clenched fists but maintains her smile, hoping the girls do not drop something on her guests.She lets out a long held breath when they leave with no incidents.After presentations, the group rises and goes to another room while the servers rearrange the chairs and tables.Mary, Barbara, and Jill remove the table clothes from the head tables and spread the tables out placing chairs on both sides.Barbara and Jill place new pink table clothes on the tables while Mary lights candles.Alex and Jane direct the entire staff on how to lay place settings for the guests.When the guests return, they applaud.Mary and Jill place glasses of water on the tables, after they stay in the kitchen watching the people eat.Halfway through dinner Jane Shaver releases all the volunteers and only keeps her paid staff.Mary says, Lets go change for the dance.They grab their bags and scramble to the elevator.They exit to a silver plaque on a door that reads, the Culver Room.Inside is a large room with sofas and chairs and alongside one wall are dressers and mirrors.Mary remembers 50 beauty contestants using the room during the Miss Sunny Isles Pageant.Jill and Barbara sit on a sofa talking while Mary changes in the small bathroom.Mary returns to stand in front of a full length mirror.She dons a conservative, yet busty, red strapless dress.Oh, Mare, you are gorgeous.You are beautiful, says Barbara.Thanks, it is a little tight in the belly but I dont intend to eat or drink a thing.Mary twirls in front of the mirror, do I look like a princess going to the ball?She laughs and twirls again.How about if I just say be home before midnight, Cinderella, says Jill.Barbara laughs.You are the Belle of the Ball; wait for me, Im next.Barbara picks up her gown and heads for the change room.Jill looks at Mary, how are you feeling?I have butterflies, tons of butterflies.I could use a drink right about now.The two women laugh so hard their eyes fill with tears.Oh, no, let me stop, says Mary.She goes over to one of the many dressers and plops down to look at herself in the mirror.Did you bring your makeup kit with you?Hold on, Ill go get it, says Jill.Mary brushes her hair.Jill returns and hands her the kit.I need to do something with this hair.Any suggestions?Jill hands Mary a napkin which she uses to wipe her eyes.Jill stands behind her examining Marys long brown hair.Up or down?I dont know, how about a loose ponytail?Jill brushes Marys locks and puts a scrunchie at the base of her neck and a hair tie at the end.There, how does that look?Mary turns her head from side to side, I like it, thanks.Barbara comes back into the room wearing a red dress.It is an Espiral red mid plunging neckline dress for clubbing.Mary ordered one for a client and new the retail price was $350.The dress hugs Barbaras ass and goes down to mid thigh level.A red strap around her neck holds the dress up on either side with two brass rings that connect the strap with the rest of the dress.The inside of both breasts are visible and the dress opens to a point halfway down between her breasts and her navel.If she turns a certain way more of her breast becomes visible.With Barbara's long red hair flowing behind her, she is beautiful.How do I look?A little tight but I like it, says Jill.She is not big on giving Barbara compliments but the dress is tame compared to hers.I think you are the Belle of the Ball, Barb, says Mary.I never saw that dress at the shop.You are a vision.Mary hugs Barbara.Thanks, guys, I saw it and snapped it up so neither of you could claim it.I guess that just leaves me, says Jill.She rises from the sofa with her bagged dress.Hurry up, slowpoke, you know how you like to take forever, says Mary.You two go ahead.You are right, Mare, it will take me awhile so you two go checkout the scenery.Ill be there in a few minutes, all right?We can wait, the dinner is not over yet, says Mary.No, go ahead, I want to make a grand entrance so all eyes will be on me.Not you two heifers.Barbara and Mary both laugh.All right, Miss Grand Entrance, have your day in the sun, says Barbara.She and Mary leave the room.Mary and Barbara walk down the hall and pass the elevators to a set of double doors.As they make it to the doors they hear music inside.Mary, Mary, over here.Mary turns to her right and sees her boss, Mrs.Belmont, talking with Robert Tyler and Jerry Carpenter.The womans eyes grow large as she takes in Marys dress with appreciative nods.She then unfastens her five strand pearl necklace and moves toward the women with a warm smile.Without asking, Mrs.Belmont places her pearl necklace around Marys neck and fastens it in place.Oh, no!No!she protests.Shhh, counters the old woman to silence her.She strokes the lovely beads.There, that will do nicely.Come along, let me introduce you to one of our biggest donors.Mary Lake this is Mr.Robert Tyler.Robert this is Mary Lake, she is the Belmonts Office Manager.And Barbara Limbaugh this is Jerry Carpenter, another of our benefactors.Mary turns to Mrs.Belmont, her hand on the expensive necklace ready to protest again, but before she can speak, Robert says, it is nice to meet you, Miss Lake, Miss Limbaugh.I hope both of you are enjoying the evening.Mary gives a controlled smile.Thank you, we are.Barbara decides not to waste any more time.Mr.Carpenter, is it Jerry?She holds out her hand hoping he will kiss it like the men in the movies.Mrs.Belmont, Miss Lake, I dont mean to be rude but I would like to talk with this young lady if the two of you dont mind.Jerry takes Barbara by the hand to lead her to a corner.Barbara steps in front of him to draw his attention to her assets.She exaggerates her hips as she walks.Jerry follows as if in a trance.Well, if that dont beat all, says Mrs.Belmont, laughter rolling across her pink face.What I wouldnt give to be thirty years younger and with a backside like that.You know, Robert, I used to turn a few heads back in my day.Oh, I am sure you turned more than a few heads.I have always told Stanley he is a lucky son of a gun to have snapped you up so early.If I were twenty years older I would give him a run for his money.They share a loud laugh.Mary stands listening.She can feel the perspiration sliding down her arms, catching every hair follicle, zinging her with unbearable sparks.She turns her head, searching for an exit.Escape overwhelms every thought.Her girls let her down, again: this was the very reason why she asked them to come with her.Mrs.Belmont hits Robert playfully, you stop it, you devil, you.They should arrest you, trying to turn and old lady's head like that.They giggle some more.Then Mrs.Belmont eyes Mary.Mary, will you entertain this devil while I see to the rest of our guests?Robert, be good to her, she is a class act.Of course, Mrs.Belmont.The old woman strokes the necklace again, giving a cryptic look to Marys face and hair.Mary kisses her on the cheek, unable to ascertain her true motive.Mrs.Belmont smiles, then departs.After an awkward silence, Robert says, Miss Lake  Mary.She directs him out onto the balcony.She closes the doors behind them and turns to him.I am sorry for the things I said and for my behavior in general.She prays he responds but he doesnt, forcing her to prattle on.I sometimes act and say things that I shouldnt because, well because I ...well I apologize and I am sincerely sorry.Will you forgive me?Figuring her out is a tough order.Robert gives a warm smile.I forgive you if you will forgive me.You didnt do anything.I made you nervous when we first met and I apologize for it.If I had apologized earlier maybe some of the other stuff wouldnt have happened.I am sorry.A smile creeps across Marys face, removing her doubts.I guess that takes care of that.Perhaps our problem is that we talk too much, why dont we be quiet and dance.Theres no music.Robert gives a mischievous smile.He waggles his brows before opening the doors, bathing her soul with warmth.Music fills the balcony.No talking, just dancing.He extends a warm hand.Robert pulls her tentative frame in close to him so tight he feels her heart hammering.Fearing she may bolt he releases to allow more space between them.They twirl around the small balcony oblivious to everything around them.Barbara and Jerry watch the happy couple from a table near the balcony.Way to go Mary!Barbara whispers.What did you say?Barbara points to the balcony.That is my girl dancing with your boy.He better treat her nice or I will come after him like a hurricane.Barbara fashions a seductive grin she aims at Jerry, her deadly intent is not lost on him.Dont worry about those two, smirks Jerry.I think they make a good couple.I will tell you an inside secret; he is absolutely crazy about her.He told me so the other day.He just cant figure out why she hates him.No, no, no, no, she doesnt hate him.That is just a front that she puts up.Mary is in love with him but afraid he will break her heart.She has been through a lot and it hasnt been easy.Well, so has he.Jerry scans the beautiful redhead.You know if you could read my mind, I would have to wash it out with soap.His cheeks fill with red fire he holds just for her.Barbara leans in to whisper.Ive already been through two bars of soap myself.A delicious smile crosses his face.He leans in to whisper.Lets find a broom closet.He arches his brows, grabs her hand, and tugs her toward the elevator.Once inside and moving downward, Jerry slams the stop button.Barbara moves in the blink of an eye.Together, they kiss and grope while their hearts race.Unable to keep cordial, Jerry hits the button again.They leave the elevator and enter the first room they find, a supply room.Careful with the dress, I have to take it back tomorrow.Okay, okay.A darkened room means there is no need to talk.They skip the preliminaries to gain carnal knowledge of each other as fast as possible.Once satiated, they return to the dance to twirl around the room with others.Robert scans Mary making mental notes of every moment in case something goes wrong.He focuses on Marys long brown hair, how it shimmers in the moonlight.He takes in the contrast between her bright red gown and golden brown skin.She is a goddess.No painter can do justice to Gods masterpiece.Her face, her hair, the way her breasts long to spill over the top of her gown, she overwhelms his senses.After a few dances, Robert directs her to a couch on the balcony so they can talk.Perhaps sitting will calm him and keep her from bolting.Have you enjoyed your evening?Yes, I have, says Mary.I think back to a conversation we had and I am trying to come up with the words but nothing seems appropriate.Words for what?From the moment I saw you in this dress, the only word that comes to mind is that you are beautiful and I know how you hate that word.Mary lowers her head to hide her smile.I dont hate the word.You just dont think it is very imaginative.A laugh springs from her chest before she can lasso it.Ive heard it quite a bit; it has been said to me, to my girlfriends, and to every woman, including those who are in caskets at a viewing.I would prefer it if people said something else.Forgive me for being so plain, I am not that educated when it comes to words.Tell me, if I had a dictionary in my hands now what words would I find instead of beautiful?You mean a thesaurus.Other words for beautiful could be ...I dont know ...fascinating, mind blowing, exquisite ...there are many to choose from.Robert regards his hands as if searching for something elusive.He looked back up.Do you work mornings?Yes.Tomorrow I will find the perfect word.I will phone you at work to let you know which word I chose.Would that be all right with you?Mary beams knowing she will have a call to look forward to.Yes, that will be all right with me.Good.Did it take you long to pick out the dress?I hope it wasnt too much trouble for you.No man had ever asked her about her clothing except to say how much will it cost him.What an unusual man he was.She liked that he was thoughtful and a communicator.No, it wasnt any trouble.I went with my girlfriends and we found dresses in a matter of minutes.A photographer in the ballroom catches his eye.I have to make a confession to you, Mary.I have been trying to make a mental picture of you but it is not working.You know how they say take a picture, it will last longer?Do you mind if I take a picture of you in your dress?Again, his words touch her.Somehow he knows which buttons to push to make her melt.Mary is both afraid by the attraction to this man and frightened half to death.She nods more for herself than him.She is going to take a chance.Though her knees knock and her heart threatens to fling itself from her chest if she doesnt leave immediately, she stares into his eyes and utters the words, I dont mind.Good.Robert waves at the photographer standing near them.He asks Mary to stand with the moon behind her.Joy fills him as the photographer snaps her picture.Please join me, says Mary, it is only fair.The man snaps another picture.Would you care for another dance?Robert asks.Yes.Robert and Mary dance to slow music.Mary rests her head against Roberts chest and places her hands on his strong back.She will open up and be stronger and not ruin the moment with fears.She feels wonderful, as if all is right with the world.She barely moves on the balcony under the moon.No one exists but her and this man with a back strong enough to lift her or catch her if she falls.She feels as if whisked away on the clouds.Robert stops dancing to gaze on his angel.He cups his hands around her face.His fingers tremble.Without a word he releases her and walks behind her.Marys face falls.Has she done something wrong?Before she can ask, she feels quivering fingers stroking her long hair.The bows restraining her hair fall away to let her hair flow down her back.Robert caresses her curly locks in a gesture so intimate it forecasts future events.To feel those magical fingers lower is all she wants.She needs it.She pants, unable to gain control.Focus.Focus.His fingers comb her hair then place it around her shoulders like a heavy coat.Mary never moves, intrigued by his curiosity, his boldness.Robert comes back around to face her.her chest tightens, her heart hammers.He again cups her face and fixes her with a mesmerizing stare, searching.He lowers his face to hers and softly kisses her on the lips, sending shock waves throughout her body.She feels as if electrocuted by pure pleasure.Mary wraps her arms around him, tugging him closer and kissing him more deeply to spur him on.She is not a doll and will not break.Her fever sweeps into Robert.His kisses plunge them into a furnace of desire they cannot escape.He pulls his lips from her taking her breath with him.Mary moves involuntarily, instinctively toward him longing for another breath to keep her alive.She cranes toward him, her heart pattering.Fear builds.She is not brave enough to face this kind of death.Mary backs away out of self preservation.She pants.We better go inside.All right.Robert walks her inside.Mary thinks up a diversion.I want you to meet one of my best friends.They walk over to the couple and stop them from dancing.Barbara this is the man I was talking about.Barbara knows something is wrong by the way Mary holds her gaze.She points to a table.Lets all go have a seat and get to know each other better.Together, they walk toward the table.They stop dead in their tracks.Jill stops in the middle of the room, her hands on her full hips.She models not only a tight dress, but a bust boosting, strapless red gown featuring embroidered chiffon.Marys eyes grow wide.Her mouth moves but no words come out.No wonder she didnt want us to stay while she changed.Mary gawks recalling their morning trip to the store to pick out their dresses:      Mary, Jill, and Barbara went to Suit and Things, a consignment shop that sells bathing suits as well as rents gowns and tuxedos.They had to find something for the party and waited to the last minute to find their dresses.Barbara saw a wedding dress with a long train, whoa, can I try that on?She said to the saleslady and owner.The dressing room is back to your right, said the owner.Thanks, Ill be right back.She came back a few minutes later wearing the gown and holding the train in her hand.Well, how do I look?You look fine, Barb, said Mary.Maybe if you are lucky you will get to wear one for real.Yeah, said Jill, but it wont be white, thats for damn sure.Do you have to be a bitch every day?yelled Barbara.Yeah, I do, said Jill.Barbara gave Jill the finger and looked at herself in the mirror.Not bad, not bad at all.I could be a bride and rock this thing out.Barbara danced in front of the mirror.You better take that thing off before you mess it up, said Mary.While Barbara moved to the bathroom, she carried a bright red dress to the owner.This might be a little tight in the waist, can it be taken out?Will that make it not returnable?Im afraid so.No alterations on rentals.If you buy it you can do what you like.Let me try it on first and then Ill decide, is there another change room?You can use the mens change room behind you.Thank you.Mary turned to go to the room.Jill looked through all the gowns and settled on a red strapless number that would do the girls proud.Her nipples would appear as eyes pressing against the thin fabric.If she made a quick dip ...whoa, Nelly, the girls will be able to see everything at the party in this number.She checked the size on the back label, perfect!Jill did not try her dress on.She rushed up front and paid the clerk, insisting on a carry case for her gown.Mary came out of the dressing room and looked in the mirror.Her plan would be to take home a plate of anything she thought tasted good and try it then.She looked in the full length mirror one more time, examining her whole look.She had a pair of shoes to wear but her hair wasnt quite right, she knew she could go to the beauty parlor but would have to make it quick.Mary went back and changed and went to the front of the store to pay for her dress.Barbara put the wedding dress back and found a cute red dress.She decided to rent it and not try it on, Jill had discouraged her enough and she would wait and face the mirror in her bedroom.She took the dress up front and paid the rental fee.The three women walked out of the store and back down the two blocks to the Belmont hotel.# # #      A Cheshire cat grin spreads across Barbaras face as she takes in her nemesis.Wow!I guess Ive been demoted.Mary turns to Robert.Could you excuse us for a moment?Of course, says Robert.Come on, says Mary to Barbara.Barbara and Mary leave the men and walk toward Jill who is soaking in all the stares.Jill beams as the two women approach.Mary gazes at the plunging openness that goes down to Jills navel.Barbara leans in to whisper so only the three of them hear.Whos the slut now?her face fills with a warm pinkish glow.
