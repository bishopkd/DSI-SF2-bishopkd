He flashed a phony smile.Sean ignored him.Elliott, are you ready to see Laura?Elliotts eyes widened as if hed forgotten her existence.His chapped lips curved into a genuine smile.Ready.Yes sir, Im ready.As they crossed the rough lawn, he stumbled on a tuft of grass that the mower had missed.Sean tightened his grip, holding him upright.Elliott wore ancient brown moccasins, slick with wear.His big toes were poking out, the toenails black and ragged.And all those good shoes had been going to waste in his closet.They were only a minute or two from Laurawho wasnt his child?But there might still be some joy at the end of his strange journey.At least he could enjoy food and a bath and a clean, soft bed.Simple comforts.Elliott was a wreck of a man, though.Laura would go into shock if she were to see him with no warning.Ill give Laura a call, Sean told him.You cant just walk in, unannounced.Youd give her a heart attack.Like you nearly did when you were on her porch.That was you, wasnt it?It was.I had a late start.I had to sneak away slow like in the wrong direction.Ive had too many visitors, coming too close to my shed.There was a shed at the cabin?It must have been buried in the kudzu.Sean shook his head.Hed have to tell Keith theyd been so close.He pulled out his phone and called Lauras number.She answered after one ring, sounding sad and scared.Laura, honey, I have good news.What is it?Down on the road, nobody was driving by.Nobody was watching as Elliott Gantts frail legs carried him home from the wilderness.Brace yourself, Sean told Laura, his eye on the house.I want you to look out the window.Well be walking across the road.Coming home.Home?Her voice quavered.Whos coming home?Your two favorite men in the whole, wide world.A stunned silence.A long, slow inhalation of air, like shed been starved for oxygen and shed finally found some.Dont lie to me, she said, louder now.Sean Halloran, dont you dare.Dont say it unless its true.Hes not like he used to be, but Im walking your dad home.He waited, expecting the wild, joyful scream of a girl whos beating a boy at a green plum war.Any second now, shed yell I told you so!at the top of her lungs.A crash hit his ear.Shed dropped her phone.Fainted, maybe.And hed thought he was doing such a good job of breaking it gently.With a gentle tug to Elliotts arm, Sean encouraged him a bit closer to the road in case Lauras view was blocked somehow.Over this way, partner, Sean said.You okay?Elliott nodded, trembling.Sean was shaking too.Across the road, the front door banged open.Laura, Cassie, and Gary spilled through the doorway, but only Laura ran to the edge of the porch.She stopped there at the top of the steps.The sun glinted on something metallic dangling from her hands when she pressed them together as if in prayer, fingertips touching her lips.Then she raised her hands like an old time Pentecostal grandma praising Jesus.That metallic something flew into the air and landed somewhere with a faint tinkle.Laura hurtled down the steps.Barefoot, with her red hair flying behind that snug bandanna, she raced toward the road.Sean patted Elliotts shoulder.Here she comes.Shes a sweetheart, isnt she?Theres my Laura.Elliott stretched his broken hands toward her.Shes my girl.Glancing at Gary, who stood motionless on the porch, Sean could only wonder.Laura could hardly believe her eyes.They stood together, two tall, lean figures with wild man hair.One was dark, with a barely started beard; one was gray, his feathery beard ruffling in the wind.He bore no resemblance to the strong, strapping man whod once saved a skinny boy from a beating.She stumbled through prickly weeds and lunged across the road, the bank hiding the men from her view.Sharp stones and burrs cut her feet.Then the cement steps were underneath her.She scrambled up them.At the top, she gulped a breath and took a long, hard look at her dad.Her dad, alivebut he was so thin!Tottery, stooped, long haired.Ragged clothes hung on his bony frame.Still, she would have known that smile anywhere.Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!She raced up the hill, crying.Laura.He opened his arms, an old, broken bird spreading crippled wings.His hands were contorted.Twisted.The sight jolted her almost to a stop.Careful not to hurt him, she forced herself to a walk.His feverish blue eyes faded from clarity to confusion and back again as she approached.Excuse me if I stare, he said.Youre not the little girl I remember.But its me, she said, stepping into his wiry, smelly embrace.She wanted to ask what had happened to his hands, but she didnt want to ruin his homecoming with tears.Youre all right?His voice was thin with fear.Im fine, Dad.Just fine.But what about you?She pulled back and took in his hollow cheeks and his watery eyes.You okay?He reached out to brush her hair off her forehead.Like talons, his fingers couldnt uncurl enough to make solid contact.The man said you were in danger, he said fretfully.ItsSlattery, isnt it?Slatterys back.She looked toward Sean again.He shrugged, apparently as mystified as she was.Im fine, really.But Dad, Slatterys long gone.Hes not after you, now?If he is, Ill He stopped, his forehead puckered.No, youre right.Hes gone.I made sure of it.The lake, you know.Aw, no.Seans face paled.No, Elliott.Dont.What?Laura asked, lightheaded now.What are yall talking about?Slattery.Sean wheeled around, strode a few paces away, and came back, pressing his fingers to his temples.You didnt hear that, Laura.You didnt hear that.He looked behind him.Is Dale close enough tothank God, he isnt.Oh, Lord.Hear what?she demanded.What does it mean?Her dad rambled on.Hes gone, Slattery is.Hes with his car in Bennetts lake.I remember now, mostly.He passed one hand over his forehead.They couldnt keep him in prison, so I took care of it for em.Hell never stalk another little girl.Enough, Sean bit out.We dont want the details.Her dad kept going, his voice thin but clear.After Nam, I vowed I would never kill again.And I vowed to protect the innocent, like I sometimes couldnt, over there.Then came a day when I had to break the one vow to keep the other.He blinked, and twin tears trickled down the sides of his nose.God help me, but I had to do it.I dont quite recall how, but I did it.Slattery hadnt skipped town, then.And Sean hadnt witnessed some unknown car thief hiding his crime.Hed seen her father.The blood rushed from Lauras head.The sunny day wobbled around her, everything slanting off balance.When her mom had accused her husband of having blood on his hands, it wasnt antiwar rhetoric.She must have known.When?Laura asked.Where?Summertime, her dad said.Late summer, by the tracks.The little oneyou know.The happy little one.Nobody was watching her.She didnt know Slattery was after more than her blackberries.II stopped him before he could take what he wanted.Tigger, Laura whispered.Her knees lost their strength.Sean grabbed her elbow, steadied her.Late that summer, the year Slattery disappeared, theyd picked a bumper crop of berries.But one day, Tigger stayed to fill her bucket by herself.Lauras dad had returned to check on her, and hed kept something terrible from happening.Hed dealt with Slattery somehow.No wonder hed been in such a black mood that night when Laura came home with painted nails like a grown woman.His face clear now, no trace of trouble on it, he cocked his head toward distant music.Listen.Foggy Mountain Breakdown.Theres a good tune.The wreckage of his fingers fidgeted as if he were coaxing notes from a fiddle.Theres not much music in the mountains.Ive missed it.He patted his chest pocket, producing a metallic clinking.This is my only music now.For Jess.My Valentine.When he lowered his hand, the silvery wind chimes peeked through a hole in his pocket.Sean laid his hand on her fathers narrow shoulder.Looks like youve missed a few meals.What would you say to a bite to eat?Maybe a bath?Some clean clothes?I would say thank you very much, sir.He inclined his head toward Laura in a familiar, courtly nod.But first, together, lets pay our respects to your sweet mother.Together, they walked toward the family plot.The head of the grave wasnt far from the bright pink bushes where Laura had cut azaleas days ago.The tin vase had fallen, and the flowers were limp and faded.The wind picked up, sending an empty paper cup rolling down the slope.Distracted, her scarecrow of a dad laughed at it.Then he started singing an old ballad, but not the one the PA system was pumping out, downtown.The two songs clashed in key, in rhythm, in mood.Where did you stay last night, O Randall, my son, he crooned, out of tune.Hed once had perfect pitch.Strong, skillful hands.His own business.A circle of friends whod loved him.A wife and daughteryes, she was his daughter!As much as if hed adopted her from an orphanage and claimed her as his own.Laura stole another look at his ruined hands.They had crafted sweet voiced mandolins and cozy rocking chairs and doll furniture.Those hands had protected.And theyd killed.The PA system kicked into another number, louder and faster, spinning into a toe tapping reel.Her dad tilted his head, seeming to focus on the music, or maybe he was listening to a train.Another one was approaching town on the long curve from the north.Where did Dale sneak off to?Sean asked abruptly, turning in a circle.Laura spotted him first and pointed.Leaning against the brick wall of the church, Dale watched them.She turned her back on him, and movement across the road caught her eye.Gary was walking down the porch steps.With his shirttails flapping, he started across the road, toward the steps that led up the bank to the graveyard.He kept to his deliberate pace as he climbed the steps and then the hillside.Laura moved close to her dad, taking his arm and leaning her head against him.Dad, I know you and Gary havehave clashed before, but this isnt the right time to fly into one of your moods.Sit tight.Keep yourself under control.His dry laugh seemed to mock her worries.Dont fret about me.I can handle my old compadre.Gary slowed.He stopped, maybe at some inner Rubicon, then thinned his lips and started moving again.He drew nearer, hiking up the gradual slope, and didnt stop again until hed nearly reached them.Elliott, he said.Welcome home.Thank you kindly.Gary hung his head.Cassie just finished ordering me to face you like a man, but I guess you already know what I did.Yes, I do.Lauras pulse quickened.Her dad knew everything, then?Knew about both affairs?Even knew she wasnt his baby?Im very sorry.Gary extended his hand.Will you forgive me?Blinking back tears, Laura wondered how many times her dad had said those words to Gary.Now the tables were turned.She lifted her hand from her dads arm, and he stepped forward.I have already forgiven you, he said, extending his claw like hand to Gary.Ive forgiven my good friend and my dear wife.Garys eyes were wet.Thank you.I want to make amends.I want you to have whatever you need.All the best.The best care.The best doctors.I hate doctors.Hospitals.He released Garys hand.IIyou wont do that to me.No sir, you will not.You dont hate Doc Marsh, Sean said.He wont put you in a hospital.Paying no attention to that, her dad turned and walked to the grave.Laura, Sean, and Gary turned in unison to watch as her dad righted the tin vase.Slowly and carefully, he began to straighten the azalea branches.A stillness settled over her, an acceptance that was very much like peace.She couldnt change the past, nor could she know the future.She had this moment, though, with her dad only a few feet away.It was strange and wonderful to see a living man so close to his name on a memorial plaque.He was alive.Alive!Hurry up there, old man.Dales raspy voice came from behind her.You got places to go.People to see.As Laura faced him, so did Sean and Gary.A rush of courage swept her.The three of them stood between Dale and her dad.Together, they could keep him safe.She glanced behind her, meeting her dads puzzled gaze.He held a small stem of azaleas in his mangled fingers.Its all right, Dad, she said.Well be home soon.Oh no you wont.Dale came closer.Mr.Gantt has an appointment with the law.Sean clenched his fists.You really called the cops?Why?Hes a criminal, Dale said.A prowler.So I turned him in.Like he turned me in.He made me lose my job, my house, my building.No, that was me, Gary said mildly, as if he didnt mind the accusation.Dales chest seemed to grow larger, puffing up.His eyes, usually so cold, burned with hatred.You, Bright?You made that call?I did.I dont regret it, either.Thats how you got your filthy hands on my building?Gary shook his head.Now, Halloran, youd better get your facts straight.I got all the facts I need, Dale said.Thats how you can afford to be the big, generous rich man.You turned me in.You sent me to prison.You stole my building.You stole my son.You dont deserve your sons, Gary said, his eyes wet.Either one of them.Shut up before I shut you up, Bright.You lying thief.Dales face was flushed.Sweating.Gary never stole anything, Sean said.He has given.And given.Dale turned on Sean.Yeah?You want me to pay it forward for you, Mr.Luthier?Heres how I pay you and your highfalutin pals.He pulled something small and shiny from his pocketa toy gun.Give it to me, Sean said quietly.You dont want to go there, Dale.Laura took a sharp breath.Not a toy.Tiny but real.The pansy gun?In the silence, she heard a faint stirring behind her.Felt a small breeze.Her dad brushed past her.I love you, he whispered with a wink that said Ill be all right.He stepped in front of Gary.A huge blast ripped out of the tiny gun.Laura screamed.Her dad crumpled backward, his arms twisting around his head.He fell into Gary, knocking him over.Laura hit her knees and crawled to her dad.Blood was already spreading across his threadbare shirt.Screaming again, she looked upinto the barrel of the tiny gun.Sean, in a blur, rushed Dale.Another shot exploded in the burning air.Sean roared and fell beside Laura.Sandwiched between them, between the warmth of their bodies, she smelled smoke.Sweat.Blood.Spitting out grass and dirt, she tried to speak but lost her own voice in the confusion and shouting.Afraid to look, she looked anyway.Gary was shoving Dale to the grass.Pinning him there.Laura struggled to sit up, to see.Her daddy was gone, his eyes open but sightless.A baby dolls eyes.His chest, a ruin of blood.Feathery gray hair, streaked with white, lifted by the wind.Chimes, spilling from his pocket.In his hand, faded pink flowers splashed with red.On his skinny forearm, life everlasting.Sean moaned.Laura twisted, bending over him.High on his chest, a red hole spurted blood on his shirt in time with his pulse.Blue eyes wide, he stared at her.Blinked.Sean!She scrambled up, gravel grinding into her knees.Pressure points.Pressure points.What had she learned?Something about the clavicle.Collarbone.Arteries, pressure points.She couldnt think.No!A distant screamher own.No!Shed lost her dadagainand Seans lifeblood was spurting out of him.Faster now.A regular rhythm, speeding fast, faster.Bright red blood.An artery.She tore her bandanna off her head and pressed it hard against his chest.Scarlet blood pulsing into white and black cotton.Soaking it, so quickly.Laura leaned closer.Dont you dare die.I already lost Mom.I cant lose you and Daddy and Mikey all in the same day.I wont have it!Do you hear me?His eyes opened.Youd ratherhavethe cat, he said faintly, one corner of his mouth curling up.His eyes rolled up in his head.The lids fluttered and closed.Desperate, she looked for help.A sheriffs cruiser swept into the church parking lot.An officer climbed out.A woman.It had to be Kim Milton.Speaking into a radio, so far away that her voice was inaudible, she headed up the slope at a slow jog, her revolver drawn.Kim!Laura screamed.Help!Hurry!Somewhere in town, a siren wailed.The train whistle blew, fading into the south.Dale ranted unintelligible words but couldnt escape.Gary, straddling him, cursed and cried.Cassie flew at him too, shrieking.Kicking.Seans eyes opened, glassy and strangely calm.They closed again with no sign that hed seen her.His skin was white.Squeezing two fingers to the cold skin of his wrist, Laura sought his pulse.Still there.Fainter.Faster.Her shoulders heaved with deep, rasping sobs.Sean, stay with me!The wind blew her hair into her mouth.Did Kim even see that two men were down?One dead, one dying.The two men Laura loved most.I need help now, Kim!Help!Sirens wailed over the fiddles and banjos.The trains whistle faded, a ribbon of sound sliding away into the distance.Her hair covered her face, her eyes.She couldnt see Sean.She could hardly breathe.His pulse fluttered faster now.Weaker.He was slipping away.Hed be gone even before the train.On Saturday afternoon, Laura walked Tigger and Cassie out to the lobby of the hospital.After giving them quick hugs, Laura stepped back and tried to smile.Tig, did Cassie ever buy you a new hair clip?Hair clip?To replace the glittery pink one you lost in the berry patch.Tig shook her head.I dont know what youre talking about.It was a blessing that Tig didnt remember much about that day, and Cassie had never learned the worst of it.She never would.Never mind, Laura said.Thanks for stopping by.Well be back, Cassie said.Keep your chin up, sis.Almost in unison, she and Tigger waved and headed for the bright sunshine outdoors.Cassies phone rang just then and she whipped it out of her pocket.Laura couldnt hear the conversation, but she knew from the happiness in Cassies voice that Drew had called.Again.Theyd been on the phone almost constantly since the shooting.Laura turned and began her trek back to Seans bedside.She was glad Gary hadnt come today.She didnt have the emotional energy.It wouldnt be awkward forever, though.Maybe he and Ardelle would be all right too.Poor Ardelle.Shed admitted to Gary that shed suspected his infidelity thirty years before.Shed found one smudge of peach lipstick on his collar, and shed recognized the scent of Jean Nat on his shirts.Her suspicions had flared again, six weeks ago, when he cried at the funeral.Then shed read between the lines in some of the journals shed boxed up.But until shed compared the dog tag and the Red Cross cards, she hadnt been sure Laura was his child.Ardelle must have known the significance of the daylilies too, or she wouldnt have pulled the garden marker out of the dirt.She was a lot smarter than some people gave her credit for.The plants from the funeral, massed around the fireplacehad she wanted to rub Garys nose in the fact that Jess had died?Or maybe all of it was like picking at a scab, like Cassie had said.A set of big automatic doors slid open, farther down the corridor.A tall man came through, walking slowly, keeping his eyes on the floor.Gibby Sprague was seventy if he was a day but still strikingly handsome.He was dressed all in black.Silver hair curled over his collar.A gold watch chain shone against his vest.He didnt notice Laura.I forgive you, Gibby, she whispered, mostly to remind herself shed made that choice.But she still wanted the truth.The closer he came, the more she wanted it.He looked up and opened his arms.Laura.I cant believeany of it.She stepped into his hug.I cant either.Hows Sean?Hes hanging in there.Theres not much change.God love im, Gibby said.You all right, honey?Im as all right as I can be.He draped his arm around her shoulders and they continued walking.Is there anything I can do for you?Anything at all?Yes.You can answer one question.Did you and my mom?Now, now.You know I love the ladies, but a gentleman never tells.Lauras lofty notions about forgiveness evaporated in an instant.She stopped walking, pulling herself out of his reach.How could you?My dad trusted you.He loved you, and you and my mom betrayed him.Thats why he left, Gibby.What are you talking about?Gibbys bewildered expression slowly changed to one of comprehension.Youve got a little knot in your timeline, baby.Whatever did or didnt happen between your mother and me, it wasnt until about two years ago.It wasnt for lack of trying on my part, but she wouldnt give me the time of day as long as she held out hope that your daddy might come back.What?She believed he was alive?Andand she told you?She believed it, up to a point, but she finally decided to move on.Dont fault her for it.IIno, of course not.But I cant believe she told you.She never told me.She may have had her reasons, he said with a shrewd smile.She was an original, God love her.And I think He did.Does.He pulled a gold watch from his vest pocket.I had to stop by to ask how Seans doing, but Im playing on the main stage in half an hour.Youd better get going, then.Call me sometime, you hear?Let me know about Sean.I will.No hard feelings between us?Of course not, Gibby.Im sorry I thought Its all right.Always the gentleman, he bent over and kissed her hand.He turned and walked away.Her heart should have been lighter as she continued walking toward the ICU.If Sean made it, maybe hed live to play with Gibby somedayand to teach some young Hallorans how to play guitar and mando and banjo.If he didnt make it, she wouldnt care about anything, ever again.Women, talking.One, young and angry.One, old and crotchety.Loud.Life hurts, honey, the old one said.You dont get over life until you die.Bright lights pounded his eyelids.Nasty smells.Irritating noises, likelike supermarket scanners.Where was he?He tried to open his eyes but the lids were too heavy.A sharp memory flashed into his mind.Something about a gun.Half his chest had blown up.Then he was walking across the church grounds.No, he was floating.Trying to stay on the right side, the side with picnics and weddings.Trying to stay away from graves and darkness.He fought, finding his way back to an old house.A house that breathed.A swing on the porch, lilies in the yard.A red haired girl hugging a skinny cat The pain grew and faded.Grew and faded.Now, the light brightened.No, dimmed.The women kept talking.Now he heard men.Keith.Gary.Grown men, crying.Gary, saying something about an auction.I didnt plan it that way, Gary choked out.Its okay, Sean tried to say.He couldnt make his lips move.Morning.Had to be.The light was different now, even on his closed eyelids.How many mornings had come and gone?The old lady, talking.Talking too loud, like she was deaf and thought everybody else was too.Then the sweet one.The angel.Laura?He tried to hold on to her voice, but it faded.In and out.Coming and going.She said something about quenching a smoking wick.God said He wouldnt do that, but He did, and if He ever does it again, Hell hear about it.That was Laura, all right.Mad at God.Trying to tell Him how to run the world.But God could handle her.Whats that you say?the old lady shouted.Speak up, baby.God, you say?No, God didnt pull no trigger.That was Dale.Another memory.A tiny, familiar handgun, aimed at No.Dontdont The women ceased chattering for a moment, then resumed.A light exploded in his head.Then he remembered.A shot.Another one.Incredible agony.The smell of something burning.Screams.Sirens.Pain.It was all coming back.He didnt want it to.If the nurses and that mumble mouthed doctor would leave him alone, hed have time to think.Time to grasp what couldnt be grasped.The official sounding voices receded toward the door.Grew fainter.Faded away.Peace.Quiet.Now he could think.Behind closed eyelids, Sean pictured the train pounding past the berry patch where a happy little girl loved to pick berries.Two men saw her there alone.A good man and an evil one.Now the evil one was dead.So was the good one.Everybody would die one day.I dont want to die.Nobody answered.Sean tried again.Lord, Im not finished yet.I have to take fiddle lessons.Sell a house.Marry Laura.A gasp from across the room.Did he try to say something, Granny?He tried to nod his head.A lump of lead.Heavy.Sean?A hand touched his.Clasped his.Squeezed.He squeezed back.A sharp intake of breath.Sean?You in there?Where else would I be, woman?The words refused to come out of his mouth.With intense effort, he fought to open his eyes.There she was.A blurry slice of Laura, bending over him, her hair haloed by a light behind her.His angel.The sad angel hed seen at the funeral.No tongue of fire on her head today.He was hallucinating.Dying, maybe.Sean.She was crying.Oh, Sean, youre back.Elliott, he whispered, finally managing to make a sound.Hes Her smile dimmed.He didnt make it, Sean.Im so sorry.Hes gone.Gone?He just came home.And hed said something important.Something Laura needed to know, but it had faded away to the edges of Seans memory.He might never remember.He took a bullet for Gary, she said.Dad walked right into that bullet, and then you took the next one.For me.For all of us.He remembered now.Elliott, heading straight into trouble instead of running away from it.Hed rescued his buddy.Gary.Like at the Pentagon.People had run into hell to rescue friends and strangers.Theyd gone in after them.Elliott had been at the front of the pack No.Elliott hadnt been at the Pentagonor the Twin Towersbut if hed been there, he would have run in the right direction.A hero.Sean closed his eyes.Fatherless.It hurt.He was still hungry, so hungry, for a father who wouldnt hurt him.Wouldnt betray him.Wouldnt disappear.His angels voice faded.Then, another nurse.He hated nurses.Always prodding and poking and talking about vital signs.He pretended not to hear her.She left.He opened his eyes again.Laura leaned over him, deep grief written all over her face.Then she smiled, the corners of her mouth wobbling up and down, up and down, and her chin quivering.He tried to breathe deeply.It hurt too much.Gary okay?Hes fine.He and Ardelle have a tough row to hoe, though.It took a moment for that to sink in.Jess and Gary.Incredible.Dale?Hes behind bars.Good.Sean fought to find the courage to speak the truth.The words came out rough and broken, the way he felt inside.Myfather murdered your father.With the pansy gun.I was stupidto let him keep it.Laura, Im so sorry.I dont think my dads sorry that he walked right into Gods arms.There really is a sweet by and by.Oh, I dont know what Im talking about.I only know theres a kind of love that never fails.There is, Sean managed to whisper.Her fingers ran lightly across his hand.Remember how my dad always called you son?Im sure he meant it.He still would.Sean was silent for a moment.I had something else to tell you.Cant remember.Its all right.She gave him that wobbly smile again.Kim saved your life.The doctors said she got there just in time.Mikey?He came back.That poor old cat.It wasnt his day to die.The cat lived.Gary lived.But Elliott died.For Gary, picnics and parties.For Elliott, the graveyard.The doorway to heaven.Elliott was a good man, Sean said.Youre right about that.The old lady, there.Granny Colfax.She clicked her tongue.He was a good soldier too.Sometimes soldiers give their lives for innocents.You know its Memorial Day?Why wouldnt she just go away?Theres a proverb in the Good Book, Granny continued.Goes like this.The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous.But sometimes, its the other way round.Sometimes, the righteous give themselves as ransom too.She sighed, long and loud.Nobody took his life.He gave it.He gave it.Laura, blessedly silent, bent over Sean, her hair falling like a curtain of flame.Her warm tears spilled onto his cheek, mixing with his.She smoothed his hair off his forehead and bent to kiss him.Then it came to him.The message for Laura.He told me, Sean whispered.Your dad told me why he ran.It wasntthat he stopped loving you or your mom.I know he loved me.I saw it.But her eyes were sad.Why did he run, then?The thin old voice came back to him.I couldnt trust myself not to harm a friend orthe woman I loved.He didnt trust himselfnot to harm Gary, Sean said.She drew in a long breath, her face softening, her eyes filled with tears.She didnt need to know the rest.It would be their secret, his and Elliotts.Sean mustered his strength for a few more words.And he still called you my girl to the end.With that off his chest, Sean fought to stay awake.To keep his angels face before him.To hang on to the light.Weeks later A blue jay flew into a pine grayed by the morning mist.Sean lifted his eyes, as blue as the birds feathers, to follow its flight.Laura settled back on the damp seat of Keiths rowboat and savored the view.It was becoming a habit to slow down at random moments.To savor a little piece of life.To listen to the ripple of the water, to smell the pines.To feast her eyes on Seans living face.She shook her head.So close.Hed come so close.He regarded her with a mixture of amusement and suspicion.What?Just thinking.Just picturing a gravestone.Sean Michael Halloran, luthier, laid to rest among his moonshine running ancestors.But hed lived.Thank God, hed lived.She clamped her lips together to keep them from trembling.No crying, he ordered with a half smile.I thought you wanted me to cry.Make up your mind.It all depends on what youre crying about.He reached into the cooler for a Cokefor breakfastand popped the top.If youre still fretting about Slattery, stop it.He eyed her over his Coke can.Its over.No blabbing.We dont need to share our information with the law.Youre only saying that because youve never had a particularly friendly relationship with law enforcement.That doesnt mean I cant think straight.What good would it do to dredge up the car?To dredge up the past?Slatterys family, whoever they are, might like to know what happened to him.He wasnt the kind of man a family could be proud of.Maybe its best if they never know.Maybe youre right.Let Slatterys sins die with him, thenwhatever they were.Let her dads sins die too.And her moms.And Garys.And the sins of selfish girls whod been too busy painting their nails to keep an eye on Tigger.Every day, the bittersweet shock hit her all over again.Cassie and Tigger were her sisters.But Gary wasjust Gary.He wasnt her father except in the biological sense, but hed been her fathers friend.Her dad had loved him to the end.Had forgiven everything.Laura gazed into the deep blue waterthe water shed once thought had swallowed her dads body.When she was twelve, another lake, a small one, had taken a little brown car and the body of its owner.Someone might find the remains one day, but she hoped it would be beyond her time.A hundred years in the future.Two hundred years.It didnt matter now; it couldnt change Slatterys fate, but she still had questions.It was June.Flowers bloomed everywhere.Soon, the purple kudzu blossoms would fill the air with their sweet, musty spice.Not long after that, the leaves would turn brown.The cold would kill the luxuriant vines and expose whatever ugliness they had been hiding.You could cover up the truth, but you couldnt change it.That was one kind of covering.There was another kind too.Love that covered a multitude of sins.All right, Laura said.Lets say nobody ever needs to know my dad engaged in some vigilante justice.Maybe even pre emptive justice, if theres any such thing.Good.Sean tipped his Coke up for another swig.Lets say that.We cant change what happened, so well let it lie.Like well let Slatterys bones lie at the bottom of Bennetts lake.But how could my dad be sure Slattery intended to harm Tigger?I dont know.I wasnt there.Sean leaned forward.I only know your dad will be remembered for giving his life.Not for taking a life.He pointed at her.And dont feel guilty because we lived and he died.It was his choice.Like it was Dales choice to pull a gun.He lowered his finger but kept his glistening eyes on hers.She ached for him.She wasnt the only one whod loved a father and lost him.In spite of everything, Sean had never shut Dale out of his life.It still hurts, she said slowly.And I know it hurts you too.Itll hurt for a long time.All of it.But I hope you know how much he loved you.And I hope he knew how much you loved him even when you still werent entirely sure he loved you back.He smiled.Ill never forget the sight of you flying up that bank screaming Daddy like a banshee.I guess he never forgot it either.He didnt have time to.Sean was quiet for a while.Sometimes, I dont like the way God handles the details.But when I look at the big picture, I know were in good hands.A woodworkers hands.Scarred, with blood on them.But beautiful.So beautiful.Some hearts were broken by another persons sin.Some hearts were mended by another persons sacrifice.Sometimes life just didnt make sense.Ardelle was in counseling.So was Gary.Cassie, home with Drew now, kept nagging Laura to start counseling too.She probably should.Back in May, when shed sat in church smelling stale perfume and dusty hymnals, shed doubted Gods ability to run the world.Now, breathing fresh air and the sweetness of summer flowers, shed gone from death to life without quite knowing how.Sean had too.Hed never said much about it, but hed changed during those days in the hospital.He stifled a groan.Hed reached for the bait bucket too quickly.Dont move so fast, she said.Are you due for another pain pill?No, he said curtly.She hid a smile.Sean could hardly stand to let anybody look after him.His hospital stay had been pure torture for him, but far worse for his nurses.Laura, though, rather enjoyed the challenge.Here, let me bait your hook for you, she offered.He hesitated but handed over his pole.I knew there had to be some advantages to dating a tomboy.You call this a date?Yeah, and if I can make my girl fish for her own supperand even row the boat for methats better still.She reached into the bait bucket and proceeded with the job.Why do I put up with you?Because I love you and you know it.On the verge of telling him she loved him too, she hesitated, collecting her thoughts.When her dad came back, she hadnt told him she loved him.Everything had happened too fast.Shed had only a few minutes, and shed missed her chance.Her dad had said it, though.Those had been his last words, said with clear eyed certainty just before he took a bullet for a friend.Then he was past hearing.Past seeing.Past pain.He wasmended.Sean, too, had loved her with his very life, putting his flesh and blood between her and the pansy gun.The last remnant of the Halloran inheritance.But there was a new Halloran heritage now.Kindness, honor, courage.Here.She handed his fishing pole back.Thank you.She rinsed her fingers in the lake and looked up.The sunlight made a bright path across the water, leading to the pines on the far shore where the camps early bird chapel service was in full swing.An old hymn floated across the water, jazzed up with guitars and drums.The Doxology.Shed sung that song with her dad, years ago, during those days when hed walked her across the road to Sunday school.Hed taught her to fold her hands and pray.Shed copied him and mouthed the words of a creed she didnt quite understand.I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.She would never understand any of it completely.Not this side of heaven.Sean heard the music too.He cocked his head, listening, and sang along so softly that it was barely above a whisper.Praise Him above, ye heavnly host; praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.She studied his lean, clean shaven face and pondered what had made him the man he was.Dale Hallorans son, like it or not.Elliott Gantts protg, nearly a son.Laura Ganttsboyfriend?Again?They had never exactly defined their relationship.Just enjoyed it.As May lazed along into June and shed decided she belonged in Georgia, she and Sean had drifted into cozy companionship punctuated by occasional quarrels and frequent moments of sheer joy.Yet shed never told him she loved him.Not even when he was about to die.Why was it so hard to say?Because it meant taking the next step too.It meant believing love was stronger than fear.Stronger than hatred.Longer than time.Worth every risk.It meant accepting the sorrows of the past and giving her heart to a brand new family with its own share of sorrows.Sean, very much alive, was looking across the water toward the camp.Hard times hadnt made him hard.Theyd made him kind.Theyd made him She blew out a puff of air, a surrender to the truth.The hard times of Seans life had made him the man she loved.Her heart soared on dreams for the future.First comes lave Sean?Her voice sounded tiny, even to her own ears.Yeah?Have I ever told you I love you?His head swiveled her way.No maam, youve always been real careful to skirt around that issue.She dabbled her fingers in the cool water.A fish splashed, close to the surface.A silver dart, full of life.She glanced over at Sean.He leaned forward.Waited.Well?he prompted, eyebrows lifting.That sarcastic tilt to his mouth, not quite a smile, was the same one shed adored practically forever.Well.She clasped her hands in her lap, dribbling lake water on her jeans.I love you.He really smiled then, the crows feet touching the corners of his eyes.I know you do.Her lips parted.Is that all youve got to say about it?His laughter echoed across the water like a song.Darlin, you know I love you too, and Id give you a big ol kiss, but wed tip the boat over.She felt a grin coming from somewhere deep inside her, from long ago happy times with Sean, her best friend, the first boy shed ever kissed.We sure would.Just wait till were on solid ground.He winked.The wind picked up, a chilly note.Sun and wind, mingled together.Love and loss, life and death, all mixed up together.All held in good hands.She closed her eyes.The sunlight warmed her face, so much like a soft kiss that she almost thought Sean had somehow moved close without rocking the boat.No, it wasnt him.It was someone even closer.Someone who brushed her ears with old whisperings shed only begun to understand.
