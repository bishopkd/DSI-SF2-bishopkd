She drained the last of her beer.So with, what, something like twenty one percent interest added to your costs  Youre very analytical, you know that?Sometimes you have to just put aside all the day to day stuff that grinds you down and open yourself up to, well, this.She spread her arms wide, indicating the beach, the bay, the whole darn gorgeous, curvaceous Cape, from Falmouth to Provincetown.Even when youll be paying off this for months or years to come, with no money in the bank and no job prospects?I didnt mean to give you something else to worry about.She waved off his concerns.Ill be fine.Things have a way of working out.What do you mean, something else to worry about?Im not worried about anything.Quinn settled deeper into his chair, crossed his ankle over his knee, and sighed gustily.He looked about as relaxed as a novice snake handler.Well, youre out of work, too, right?she asked.Not for long.If Id stayed home, Id have the whole job thing wrapped up this week.This wasnt my idea, coming up here to chill out and all that.His fingers drummed on his leg.Well, whoevers idea it was, it was a good one.Just you wait and see.The thing is, you have to embrace it, Quinn.Which it doesnt look like youre doing.I mean, I thought you were going to watch the sunset with everyone this evening.I did.For, like, a whole two seconds.Quinn shrugged.Its a sunset.How long can you stand there and watch a thing like that?She wagged her finger, smiling.Youll get it.One of these days before you go home itll sneak up on you and youll just get it.She stood up.Meanwhile its late and youre out of chili.She planted her palms on the small of her back and arched her spine, stretching, groaning lustily as she felt her muscles unkink.Quinns fingers stopped drumming.He became very still, though his expression never changed.As she watched him watching her, the tips of Mollys breasts buzzed, springing to attention under her thin little shirt.He noticed, and for a few breathless moments she felt like one of those slave girls presented for the sheiks inspection.Turn around.Take this off.Dance for me.Gosh!Both her big mouth and her imagination were getting a healthy workout tonight!Thanks for the chili, she said, breaking the spell.And the beer.She started collecting the remains of their repast.He leaped out of his chair and grabbed the chip bowl out of her hands.Leave this.Ill take care of it.Listen, maybe we could barbecue together tomorrow.I have dogs and chicken, potato salad, the works.Bring a couple of those she nodded toward the beer bottle and were set.His features settled into a polite mask.Thanks for the offer, but I really do prefer to eat alone.Oh.Im kind of, uh, looking forward to a few weeks of just being on my own.Oh.Right.No obligations.No...distractions.Embarrassment prickled like a rash.Here shed barged her way into this guys personal space, eaten his food, drunk his beercriticized his whole outlook on life, for heavens sake!when all the poor man wanted was to be left alone.No problem, she said, backing toward the door.Good night.Dont forget your trumpet.He handed it to her.Slowly Molly climbed the stairs, trudged into her living room, and flung herself on the sofa, hugging her horn to her chest.Thirty one days.How was she supposed to avoid her uptight housemate with the gigolo eyes and the yummy shoulders for a whole damn month?Three   THE BAY WAS plump and placid at high tide, infinitely easier to swim in than the Atlantic Ocean a short distance away right across the Cape.To Quinns way of thinking, the only drawback to being on the bay side was the distinctive aroma at low tide, but after the first day or two, he no longer noticed it.Hed been doing the crawl for about forty five minutes and could feel it in his shoulders.If this were a pool, hed be able to calculate distance.As it was, he could only guess, which was mildly irksome.He changed direction and headed for shore.If his buddies could read his thoughts right now, theyd write him off as hopelessly rigid.Or analyticalwasnt that how Molly had put it?According to his laid back housemate and his pals back home, he was supposed to be using this time to relax, to find his inner beach bum or some such garbage.Meanwhile he was itching to get back to the city and set the job hunting wheels in motion.One thing hed never been good at was wasting time.Quinn waded onto the hot sand and headed for his towel, where hed left his keys, sunglasses, and flip flops.With the house so near the beach, there was no need to bring more.Molly was right.It was a phenomenal location.Today only a few wisps of cloud scudded across the azure sky and the temperature was a comfortable mid eighties.The strip of beach was narrow, backed by a clifflike dune, and he shared it with a couple of dozen other folks, mainly couples and families with young children.He toweled off, slipped on his shades, and made his way down the beach and up a gentle incline to the tiny parking lot where an ice cream truck now sat, surrounded by sand encrusted kids waving dollar bills.He dropped the flip flops and slipped them on, having learned his first day there what happened when the tender soles of ones feet met black asphalt that had been baking in the sun for a few hours.Quinn crossed the little parking lot, nodding politely to the attendant sitting on a lawn chair, dutifully collecting five bucks from those not fortunate enough to live within walking distance.The house was right there on the left, and as always, Quinn scanned the grounds and the second floor deck for signs of Molly.As requested, shed left him alone during the past week, though she was unfailingly cheerful and animated whenever their paths crossed.He hadnt enjoyed telling her to keep her distance.He knew hed embarrassed her, but he also knew that a preemptive strike would be the least painful in the long run.For both of them.Quinn was honest enough with himself to admit he was physically attracted to Molly Lambto a garrulous, relentlessly cheerful, unrepentant heartbreaker.This was, after all, the woman whod bolted from her wedding four months earlier, making a fool out of one of the most powerful men in the advertising business.Quinn had seen her on the beach every day, of course, dog paddling around the bay, soaking up the rays in her sexy little swimsuits, chatting with the other beachgoers.While he himself hadnt exchanged two words with any of the people he saw there day after day, Molly had apparently become fast friends with each and every one of them.Her treks down the beach took forever.With all that glad handing and baby kissing, one would think she was running for office.She exchanged snacks with these people, kept an eye on their kids, and just that morning had even let some guy in a blond ponytail and lime green banana hammock rub sunscreen on her!Mollys innate friendliness and too trusting nature were going to get her into trouble one of these days.Quinn found himself keeping an eye on herfor her own good.Hed tried to reconcile her ingenuous charm with her horrendous treatment of Phil Owen, and came up empty.Then again, you never knew what lay beneath the surface until you really got to know someone.Undoubtedly Phil was better off without her.Charging her that exorbitant rent had to have been some kind of vindictive parting shot.True, the house was in a great location, but Phil had let it go to hell.The decks were rotting through in places, half the windows and sliding doors wouldnt budge, the plumbing was unreliable, the tile floors were buckling, the yard was overrun with poison ivy, and some of the weathered cedar shakes needed to be replaced.And that yard sale furniture!Phil could do a lot better for a minimal investment.Quinn couldnt believe his paying tenants didnt complain.He also couldnt believe anyone else paid what Phil was charging Molly.Given the houses present condition, Quinn doubted Phil could get more than seven hundred a week for each apartment at the peak of tourist seasoneight hundred, tops.This petty act of revenge lowered Quinns opinion of his former boss.What kind of man would take such blatant advantage of his broke and ridiculously gullible ex fiance?Meanwhile hed given Quinn, who could easily afford to buy the place outright, a free ride.Quinn had seen no point in letting Molly know that.He had no desire to get in the middle of something messy.He cut across the street and front yard to the deck, where he flung his damp towel over a ratty lawn chair.The outdoor shower was located in back of the house at the far end of the wraparound deck, out of sight of the street.Quinn hadnt actually seen Molly use it since that first day, but hed heard the water go on a couple of times when he was inside.Hed heard her belting out Donna Summerss Last Dance and the Bee Gees Staying Alive.For a guy with an admittedly feeble imagination, hed had no trouble picturing her in painstaking detail, soaping up, rinsing off, dancing her little heart out.He shuffled out of his flip flops and bent to toss them onto the deck when a tinny brrring brrring brought his head up.A bicycle bell.Molly was approaching the house on her rented bike.Two overstuffed plastic grocery sacks were crammed into the wire basket, with two more bags hanging off the handlebars.Another full sack dangled from her forearm.Her hair was secured in a long, thick braid that snaked out from under a bright blue bike helmet.She spied him and raised her free arm to wave just as she turned off the road onto the crushed shell driveway.The bike wobbled violently and she grabbed the handlebar, too late.The tires skidded out from under her, sending her sprawling into the shell shards as bags split and groceries tumbled out around her.Quinn reached her before the wheels stopped spinning.Dont move, he said.Just stay there.She lay on her side looking a little dazed.Thank goodness for the helmet.He tossed the bike aside and quickly checked for broken bones, grateful when he didnt find any.Still, her skimpy yellow tank top and cutoffs had provided scant protection and she was badly scraped up.Wow, she breathed, reaching for the helmet straps, fumbling with the release catch, her fingers trembling.He brushed her hands away and gently removed the helmet.She struggled up onto her elbow, wincing, and he helped her to sit.She looked at the broken eggs scattered about, the leaking milk container and crushed grapes.My groceries.What were you thinking, carrying all that stuff on a bike?She gazed up at him with a look of such heartbreaking vulnerability that he felt instantly ashamed.Never mind, he said, carefully brushing shell gravel from her abraded chin.Its okay.Lets get you cleaned up.Think you can walk?My groceries...She stared at her scraped up left knee, which was beginning to ooze blood in earnest, as were her chin, shoulder, and elbow.Ill get your groceries, dont worry.First lets get you into the house.He fished his keys from the pocket of his board shorts and unlocked the doors, then came back and scooped her into his arms.She opened her mouth as if to protest, but then relaxed against his bare chest.Quinn felt something rip loose insidean unaccustomed surge of protectiveness, as foreign and frightening as it was exhilarating.In his nearly thirty years on the planet, hed never been responsible for anyone but himself.He settled her in his arms and carried her into the house, past the living room with its scratchy sofa to the relative comfort of his bedroom.On the way he lowered his head a fraction, teasing his lips with the gossamer fine wisps of hair that had escaped her braid.He inhaled the fragrance of sun and shampoo and the clean, humid warmth of her exertions.Hed thought her hair was brown, but now he saw it was shot through with golden strands.Carefully he set her on the double bed, stacking the pillows behind her so she could recline comfortably.She looked at the crisply tucked bedcovers, the soft cotton blanket stretched tight and smooth beneath her.You make your bed?So?So whos going to see it?Today?You.That earned a weak smile.Im going to get blood on your nice clean blanket, Quinn.Let me worry about my blanket.I have a first aid kit in the car.Sit tight.Quinn went outside and retrieved the kit from the trunk of his Mercedes.On the way back he grabbed Mollys groceries, as well, at least those that could be salvaged.No point in giving the seagulls too extravagant a feast.When he reentered the bedroom she looked a little pale, leaning on her right side, taking care not to let her messy abrasions come into contact with his blanket.Will you relax?He sat next to her on the bed and urged her onto her back.You know, youre really uptight, Molly.You should do something about that.Take a vacation or something.He wondered if hed ever seen anything as bewitching as her smirky little smile, knowing hed put it there.Quinn opened the compact first aid kit and pawed through the various sealed packets.Lets see...alcohol cleansing pads.I dont think so.She leaned toward him to look.What else do you have in there?Iodine infection control pads.She wrinkled her nose.Iodine?Doesnt that sting?He hated to break the news to her, but no matter what they used to clean those scrapes, it was bound to be a real attention getter.Here we go.He lifted out a handful of packets.Antiseptic cleansing wipes.That sounds promising.Quinn tore open a packet and looked her over, trying to decide where to start.She tipped her head, indicating her chin.He unfolded the saturated wipe and touched it to the raw red abrasion.She screamed and jumped back, slamming her skull into the wooden headboard.Okay.He grasped her forearm.Okay, I know, but we have to clean these places.You know that, Molly.Theyll get infected otherwise.She squeezed her eyes shut and muttered a lot of words he wouldnt have thought she knew.Not Mellow Molly.He almost smiled.Okay.Ready?he asked.She nodded.Gingerly he started cleaning her chin.She sucked in her breath and tensed, but didnt move.Next customer.Quinn eased the narrow strap of her tank top down over her scraped shoulder, knowing he wouldnt find a bra strap under it.In seven days of conscientious observation he had yet to detect a bra on Molly.She probably didnt own one.He opened another packet and applied it to the bloody open skin of her shoulder.A groan squeezed past her clamped jaw.Distract her, he commanded himself.Before he could think of something to say, she asked, Hows the bike?I dont want to lose my deposit.You wont.Ill put the chain back on, realign the handlebars.No onell notice another scratch or two.Molly didnt own a car.Someone had given her a ride to the Cape and shed rented the bicycle for local transportation.He said, I didnt know you were going grocery shopping with that thing.Why didnt you ask me for a lift?The instant the words were out of his mouth, he wanted to lop off his tongue.Molly avoided his eyes.They both knew the answer to that one.No obligations, no distractions.What I mean is, I have to go myself, anyway, right?he said.No reason you cant tag along.Ill, uh, tell you next time Im going to the supermarket.He moved on to her abraded elbow.She looked away and, after an initial flinch, sat still and let him clean it.He admired her control.This had to hurt like hell.Its okay, Quinn, she said.You dont have to take me shopping.I know you value your privacy.I do fine on the bike, I just got kind of carried away and tried to schlepp too much stuff home.He fumbled for a response but came up empty.How could anyone be so damn easygoing?She ought to hate his guts for giving her the cold shoulder, for treating her friendly overtures like the onslaught of the Mongol hordes.Anyone else would have told him to take a flying leap the very first day, but not Molly.Suddenly he knew why Phil had been attracted to her.Here was a woman he could lord it over, a woman who wouldnt challenge him or try to call the shots.
