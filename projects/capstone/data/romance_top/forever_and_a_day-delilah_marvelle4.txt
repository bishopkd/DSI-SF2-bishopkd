Youre a 						good looking book and it made him feel like the stale hoecake that he 						is.Robinson smirked.You flatter 						me.That boy would make any man look good.Right you are in that, Brit.Right you are in that.Pausing, Matthew held up a bargaining hand between 						them.So how about we come to a mutual agreement?For however long youre 						in these parts, Ill see to it you fall under my protection.What does that mean?It 						means that by the end of this day, every man in this ward, right down to the 						sweeper, will know that if they touch you, they touch me.And I dont like 						men touching me.So I most certainly wont like men touching you.Sounds 						dirty?Believe me, it is.Pointing at Robinsons face and 						then sweeping a forefinger over to where Georgia lingered, Matthew tossed 						out, Now, whatever the hell this is that is going on between the two of you, I dont 						want to know.But despite my letting the two of you play, dont think that 						you can dirk this girls heart, Mr.Crusoe.Because if you do, Ill not only 						gouge out both of your eyes with my own thumbs, but Ill hand you over to 						the boys for a very long night that will only end when the last drop of 						your blood streams its way into the gutter.Do you understand?Robinson held up both hands.Blind.Blood.Dead.I understand.There wont be any dirking of her heart.I wasnt planning on it.Matthew smirked.Hes a smart 						one, this one.Georgia crossed her arms.Certainly smarter than you.Matthew grudgingly angled back 						toward Robinson.Seeing Georgia is getting a full six for putting a roof 						over your head, Im asking for an even six myself that will assure you live.Anything less than six would be insulting considering what Im 						offering.Robinson reached into the inner 						pocket of his coat.After I give Georgia her due six, Ill give you half of 						everything I have left.Will that do?Georgia gasped and grabbed hold 						of Robinsons coat from behind, frantically jerking on it.Dont you be up 						and givin him half!You havent even counted it!Robinson glanced back at her 						from over his broad shoulder and said in an unusually cool tone, Its only 						money, Georgia.Now let go of my coat.She released him and huffed out 						a breath.Robinson  Enough.He glared at her and 						pulled out the leather satchel.Im not as mindless as I 					appear.Saint Peter save them all.She 						anxiously rounded him and grabbed hold of Matthews forearm, shaking it.Matthew.You shouldnt take half.Tis all he has and Ive no idea when his 						family will come.Matthew held up a hand.Hes 						the one offering.Yes, I know, but hes not in 						his right mind.She shook her head and glared at Robinson.Dont give him 						a penny over six.Hes a thief who deserves to be hanged, not 						coddled.Robinson ignored her, loosening 						the string on the leather satchel.He turned toward the table and dumped its 						contents.A brass fob clattered onto the whitened wood, along with a leather 						pocketbook.He shook the satchel again, forcing out a folded wad of large 						paper notes that fluttered out, landing primly atop the 					pocketbook.Seeing all that money on her 						table was like seeing a mythical creature in the flesh.Matthew let out a low whistle 						and veered toward the table.Robinson spread out all the 						money with a single sweep of his large hand, pushing aside the fob and the 						empty pocketbook toward the satchel hed tossed onto the table.Leaning against the table, 						Matthew angled himself toward the pile.Is this all you have?Georgia reached out and punched 						his arm.What?This isnt enough?Robinson lifted the fob and 						dangled it, letting it sway from side to side on its chain.Tis all I 						have.Not that I can even remember how any of this came to be in my pocket.Using his other hand, he draped it over his palm, letting the chain unravel 						over his hand and sway.He fingered the glass front of the watch.Matthew leaned in with an ear to 						it.Do you have a key to wind it?No.Robinsons brows came 						together as he separated the glass and the watch itself from the gold 						casing.He brought it closer.Tis numbered 365 and readsThomas Hawkins, London.He glanced up.London.That must be where Im from.Matthew jabbed him.You think?Leaning in to better scrutinize the watch, Matthew paused and then reached 						out, digging the tip of his nail into the metal.He glanced up at Robinson, 						eyes widening.Shite.This here isnt painted brass.Tis gold.Who the 						blazes are you?A wealthy merchant of some sort?Robinson lowered his gaze to the 						watch.If I knew who I was, Mr.Milton, I wouldnt be here handing out 						dollar bills.Matthew patted him on the 						shoulder.Ah, no worries.I rather like you being here handing out bills.Well have to get to know each other more, is all.Im always looking for 						friends in the upper circles.Georgias eyes widened.Dont 						you be talkin to him like that.Hes not some politician whose mores you 						can easily buy with a word and a vote.Get out.Take your damn money and 						leave, Matthew.Go.Now.Im only trying to help, 						Georgia, Matthew chided as he leaned toward Robinson and gestured to the 						watch.Men usually etch their names on the back of a watch to keep them 						from being pawned.Perhaps yours is on the back.Have you 					looked?Georgia scrambled toward them.I dont know why I didnt think of that.Is there anythin etched on 						it?Robinson turned the fob over in 						his hand, facing its smooth gold back upward.No.He paused, staring down 						at it.I feel like Im holding the key to a door that refuses to open.Tossing the fob down with a clatter, Robinson glanced back at her, his 						features tightening.Did you know how much money I had in the satchel 						before you gave it to me?Is that why you were panicking about my giving 						Matthew half?She nervously eyed him.Dr.Carter told me the amount, but I swear to you I never opened it or touched 						it.I gave it to you the moment you entered the office.Robinsons brows flickered.So 						why did you only ask for six dollars?Knowing I had more to 					give?It was as if the man was 						astounded to find that she wasnt a thief.To ask for more than what I need 						is greed.Somethin Matthew prides himself on, not I.   Robinson paused and glanced 						toward the pile again.Mr.Milton.I cannot give you half.Matthew shrugged.All I need is 						six.Good.Robinson fished out 						several of the notes from the pile, counting them out, one by one, and then 						folded them together.Turning toward her, he held out the grouped banknotes 						between bare fingers.Four and forty dollars to oversee your journey and 						your land.Take it.Stunned, Georgia gawked up at 						him.She hadnt known such extraordinary generosity and kindness from a man 						since Raymond gathered her up out of his coal bin and showed her a world of 						words, patience and respect she never thought possible.She swallowed and shook her 						head.I only need six.Robinsons eyes softened.You 						will need the extra money.She shook her head again.I 						cant take it, Robinson.Its too much.Matthew snatched the notes from 						Robinsons hand, stalked over and shoved the money into her hand.Grabbing 						her hard by the shoulders, he propelled her toward Robinson.Thank the man, 						instead of playing all high and mighty.Youll need it given your lofty 						plans of wanting to play farmer.Crumbling the bills in her 						trembling hand, Georgia awkwardly glanced up at Robinson, who still lingered 						before her expectantly.Bless the man for being her ticket west.She smiled.Im only takin 						this, Robinson, because I most likely will need it.Thank you.It means so 						much to me knowin that you care.He inclined his head.I care 						more than you think.Turning away, he counted out the rest of the money and 						divided it again.Gathering up half, he folded them and held it out toward 						Matthew.Four and forty, down to the dollar.I have decided to split 						everything three ways.I think it only fair.Matthew hesitated.Are you 						certain you want to hand over that much?Robinson waved it at him.Take 						it.Matthew plucked up the money and 						stuffed it into his own trouser pocket.Thank you.I, uh He cleared his 						throat, appearing unusually awkward.Youll not regret investing so 						generously in me or the ward.Robinson crossed his arms over 						his chest.I hope not.Matthews brows came together.He hesitated, patting his pocket.He glanced over at Georgia and then back 						over at Robinson.These notes are yours, arent they?They were in my pocket.Robinson swung toward the banknotes on the table and riffled through all the 						notes, laying them out.They appear to be fairly crisp and were all issued 						by the same bank.So the likelihood is that, yes, they are indeed 						mine.Matthew hit his shoulder.You 						may not know this, but banks keep records of everything that goes in and out 						of their vaults.If I take these here notes over to the bank that issued 						them, they might be able to trace their origin, which could give us a name.Maybe even your name.Robinson glanced toward him.You would do that for me?Of course.Consider it an extra 						thank you for your unexpected generosity toward me and Georgia.Matthew 						swiveled back toward her and smacked his hands together.Four and forty in 						my pocket and I didnt have to use a pistol or a fist.I like 					him.She rolled her eyes.Could you 						drop off some clothes for him later today?Hes only got what hes 						wearin.Will do, luv.Will do.Matthew 						strode toward the door, stepped out and enthusiastically slammed the door 						behind himself, his footfalls disappearing with a pounding dash down the 						stairs.Georgia met Robinsons gaze and 						slowly shook her head from side to side.Givin Matthew such a profane 						amount of money is only encouragin him to be an even bigger leech than he 						already is.You do realize that, dont you?Robinson turned away and 						gathered his money, neatly tucking everything back into the leather 						pocketbook.Better to pay a leech in coin than in blood.Still keeping his 						broad back to her, he dragged over the fob and set it onto the leather 						pocketbook and asked in a grudging tone, Why do you hate me?Georgia blinked in astonishment.Tightening her hold on the banknotes in her palm, she wandered over to where 						he stood, lingering behind him.I dont hate you.She leaned toward him 						and touched his arm with her other hand.Why would you say such a 						thing?His muscles hardened beneath her 						fingers as he fully turned toward her, his body grazing her.He purposefully 						pressed himself closer, as if to physically intimidate her, and lowered his 						gaze to hers.Because your tone isnt always as warm as I wish it to be.Do 						you even like me?He was so endearingly forward 						and real.It made her soul want to melt like butter in a pan.She softened 						her tone.I do like you, Robinson.He eyed her.You 					do?Of course I do.He held her gaze.Do you like 						me enough to kiss me again?She bit back a smile.I like 						you well enough to kiss you on the cheek.Will that do?No.I want you to kiss me on 						the mouth.Ill kiss you on the cheek and 						then we can decide if theres room for more.Take it or leave 					it.He hesitated, then leaned down 						toward her, offering his good cheek.Fine.Lifting herself on her bare 						toes, she grabbed hold of his linen shirt to balance herself and touched her 						lips to the warmth of his cheek, the stubbled, unshaven hairs rasping 						against her own skin.She kissed that cheek softly, only to kiss it again 						and again, finding herself slowly giving in to wanting so much more of him 						and that tender warmth.Sliding her hands up to his solid shoulders, she 						kissed his cheek again.His hand quickly encircled her 						waist, his broad chest rising and falling more notably against her own as he 						dragged the heat of his moist lips across her entire cheek, guiding them 						down toward her lips.Georgia half closed her eyes and 						leaned heavily against him, unable to breathe against the feel of his 						tensing muscles.She fought the urge to seize that mouth that lingered so 						close to her own.She also fought from raking her own fingers down toward 						the flap of his trousers, dragging up her skirts and riding him there 						against the table just to know what it would feel like.She doubted hed 						resist, but as lost as he was in that head of his, the last thing she wanted 						to do was take advantage of him.Do it, he murmured against her 						skin.His tongue darted out and erotically traced her lips with its wet 						warmth.Her stomach flipped, realizing 						he was in tune with her thoughts.She released his shirt and scrambled away 						and out of his hold.We shouldnt.He leaned heavily against the 						table, causing it to creak and sway beneath his weight, and gripped the 						edges, turning his knuckles white.The thick line of his erection was 						visible against the flap of his trousers.Why not?Am I not attractive 						enough?Only a man who had knocked out 						every last thought from his head would require an explanation as to 						why they 						shouldnt bend to lust.She quickly held up the folded banknotes.I ought 						to put this away.He leveled her with a heated 						stare.You didnt answer my question.Do you not find me 						attractive?Were gettin too involved, 						Robinson.All right?It isnt that I dont find you attractiveI do, believe 						meits just that we dont even know who you are and Im rather worried this 						wont end well for either of us.She turned away and hurried into the front 						room.Though she could have easily 						stripped him and let what boiled between them explode, she knew nothing good 						would come of it.Men of wealth didnt marry penniless girls from the Five 						Points.They only ever fecked them.That much she knew, even if he didnt.And though 						she had no qualms of submitting to this bubbling desire coiling within her, 						for she was no prim virgin, she sensed far more than her body was going to 						get fecked.Her dream of owning land and being a self made woman would be 						ruined.What if she ended up pregnant?Hurrying over to the patched 						wool curtains, she pulled each across the set of three windows facing the 						street, dulling the bright morning light spilling into the room.Robinson strode into the front 						room and crossed his arms over his chest, leaning against the farthest wall.What are you doing?Ensurin no one sees where I 						keep my money.She wandered over to the wall she had tacked from ceiling to 						floor with posters and handbills Raymond had gathered throughout the years 						from political rallies.She never cared for male politics but the posters 						and handbills had proven useful, for they hid all the holes in the 						walls.She paused before a slogan 						poster that read True Democrats Meet 						Here.She glanced back at Robinson and 						intoned, Open, sesame.Turning back, she untacked the 						bottom of the poster from the wall.She leaned in.Reaching into the jagged 						four inch hole in the plaster of the wall, between protruding thin wood 						lattices, she patted her way down and to the right until her fingers grazed 						her box.Grasping it, she carefully 						angled it so as not to let the contents spill and pulled the carved wooden 						box up and out of the wall.She brushed off the dust from the posy engraved 						box.Lifting the lid, she tucked in the last of what she would need atop 						those pennies, dimes, nickels, quarters and folded banknotes.She pressed the lid back onto 						it, smoothing her hand over it with genuine pride, knowing she had at long 						last achieved what she never thought possible.She had a full ninety eight 						dollars and ninety six cents thanks to Robinson, when shed needed only 						sixty to head west and claim her half acre.She smiled, fingering the box to 						ensure it was real.My father gave this box to me.Twas like he knew Id 						be fillin it with a dream hed never be able to be a part of.A large hand touched her lower 						back, making her jump.She glanced back at Robinson from over her shoulder, 						realizing hed been standing behind her all along.He pushed away her long, unbound 						hair over her shoulder, causing her skin to frill from the graze of his 						fingertips.His eyes trailed down toward the box in her hands.What 						happened to your father?he inquired in a soft voice that made her want to 						turn and rest her head against his shoulder.Shifting toward him, she lowered 						her eyes to the box, pressing its smoothed edge against her stomach.Her 						throat tightened.She rarely spoke about her father anymore.Ill never 						know.Robinson slid his arm around her 						and pulled her closer against his muscled warmth.Forgive me.You neednt 						feel obliged to tell me anything about him.No.I want to.I feel like Im 						honorin him when I do.She leaned against him.Da worked over at the 						docks paintin ships and haulin crates since I was old enough to remember.He never missed a day of work.Not even when he was sick.A days wage meant 						more to him than his health, no matter how much I nagged him about it.On 						that fifth of June, he pinched my cheek the way he did every morn before 						leavin to work, and insisted that after I sold all of my matches, that I 						stay away from the boys and make turnip soup for the both of us.So I went 						about my day and, by the end of it, made soup, filled his bowl for supper 						and set a spoon beside it at exactly a quarter to five the way I always 						did.Fingering the box still in her 						hands, she swallowed.I sat there waitin two hours.It was so unlike him.He was always punctual in everythin he did.She swallowed again.So I 						went over to the docks lookin for him.All the men were still there, 						includin the foreman.They claimed hed never even showed up for work that 						mornin.Twas the first in thirteen years.I panicked and took it straight 						to the watch, knowin somethin wasnt right.They were useless and only 						called me in to identify bodies that never belonged to him.Bein a mere 						fifteen with barely eighty two cents in a jar, I took to sellin as many 						bundled matches as I could, prayin on my rosary hed come back.Tears 						rimmed her eyes, remembering those nights spent cradling her fathers 						clothes unable to breathe or think.Robinson rubbed her back 						soothingly, his large hand gently gliding up and down.So 						whathappened?She let out a shaky breath, 						nestling her cheek against his chest.He never did come back and his body 						was never found.Thats when the landlord started pesterin me for the rent.I asked him for a means to find work, seein I didnt have the money.She 						shook her head in disgust.He only unbuttoned his trousers and asked if I 						was a virgin.I bloody took off without even gatherin my clothes, knowin 						how it would end.She drew in another breath, 						remembering that soundless night shed spent in a coal bin tucked out of 						sight, expecting someone to crawl out of the darkness and rape and kill her.Da, damn him, always taught me to believe in the best.Even when there was 						no best.I tried to honor him through all of it by keepin my chin up.I 						really did.I was fortunate Raymond took me in.Very fortunate.Tears blinded her.She choked 						back a sob and buried her face against Robinsons chest, hot tears trailing 						down her cheeks.SometimesI still imagine that Da had actually gone out 						west himself to start life anew and maybe Ill find him when I get out 						there.Tis better than imaginin him sliced up in some ditch outside the 						city without the dignity of bein buried by his own daughter.Oh, Georgia, Robinson 						whispered brokenly.She sniffed, freed a hand from 						the box and poked his chest.And thats why weve got to get you back to 						your family.Whether you remember them or not, theyre sufferin all the 						same.And you dont want that for them.They deserve to have you back.I 						know Id want you back if you were mine.Robinsons hands trailed up her 						back, curving around her shoulders, and found their way up and into her 						unbound hair.Cradling her moist cheeks with his palms, his thumbs brushed 						away the tears still rimming her eyes.He tilted her face upward toward 						him.Through blurred vision, she saw 						her own pain reflected in that rugged face, as if he himself had endured 						everything she had just shared.It made her cry even more, for it was the 						first time in years since anyone, aside from her dear Raymond, had so 						genuinely acknowledged her pain.Though she always tried to be as hard as 						steel to the world, sometimes a girl couldnt give that tough upper lip and 						pretend it didnt hurt.Especially when it did hurt.Robinson kissed her forehead 						several times, easing her back into a sense of calm.I vow to you, 						Georgia, he murmured, you will never find yourself in a coal bin or at the 						hands of vile men seeking to rip away your honor.Not whilst I 						breathe.She closed her eyes, pushing out 						the last of the tears, and swallowed his words whole.The last wretched 						pinch of the past faded as he continued to graze kisses against her 						forehead.She tightened her hold on the 						box nestled between them and slid her arm around his waist, not wanting to 						let go.After delivering one last 						lingering kiss to her forehead, Robinson released her and stepped back, 						allowing her arm to slip from his waist.Georgia lingered with her eyes 						still closed and made a haunting wish upon her soul.It was a dark and 						incredibly selfish wish that sought to take back everything that was ever 						taken from her.She wished that this remarkable man was as alone in the 						world as she was and that he would never remember who he was or what had 						once been.That way, she could be his equal, without him or his circle 						judging her, and they could move west and take on that half acre of land 						together.Oh, wouldnt that be something.If you have great talents, 						industry will improve them.If you have but moderate 						abilities, industry will supply their 						deficiency.Joshua Reynolds, Discourse to 						Students of the Royal Academy (11 December 1769) ROBINSON AT LONG LAST understood how this red haired 						rose had grown its thorn.That thorn had sprouted out of misfortune and 						self sustained pride, trying to pierce anything that dared touch its 						delicate petals.Though he didnt want to release the softness of that pale, 						tear streaked face, he knew it was best to step away, lest he kiss more than 						her lips.Gently releasing her face, he 						stepped outside of her embrace, even though he still desperately wanted to 						cradle away the pain she had endured at the hands of despicable fate.With 						each passing breath, he was beginning to realize that he had nothing to 						offer this woman aside from mere words and physical touch.This incredible 						woman deserved a man in full possession of his wits, who knew where he stood 						in the world.She lingered before him, her 						long, unbound hair splayed in waves across her slim shoulders.The scoop of 						her nightdress revealed the pale curve of her neck and hinted at the dip of 						those small breasts that were hidden beneath that plain nightdress.Her eyes 						were still dreamily closed, hands still clutching her box.He took another step back, 						digging his palms into his hips in an effort to keep himself from stepping 						back toward her.With but a few tears, the woman had made him realize just 						how utterly helpless he was in his damn condition.When she at long last awoke from 						her reverie, her green eyes met his.Though they were still tear glossed, 						there was an unexpected new vivid heat and softness radiating from 						them.He swallowed and didnt know 						what he was supposed to say or do in response to what he was seeing in those 						eyes.All he knew was that something intimate had been unleashed between 						them and nothing would ever be the same.She quickly turned back to the 						wall and lifted the poster, pushing the box back down into the hole from 						whence it came.Carefully, she tacked the poster back into place, then 						turned back to him and set her chin, resuming that 						seizing the world by the throat facade.Well, enough with the tears and the 						gossip.Ive got hours of laundry and Ive yet to knot my hair and 						dress.He paused.Do you require 						assistance?He held up both hands.These are yours to do with as you 						please.He lifted a brow.Within reason, or we might not get anything 						done.She smirked and angled a hip 						toward him.Whilst I appreciate the offer, I highly doubt youd be able to 						stomach my 						work.He lowered his hands and 						tauntingly stared.Give me the chance to prove you wrong.She paused.Youre really 						lookin to help?I wouldnt have offered 						otherwise, Georgia.All right.Can you bring up 						water from the pump just down the street?The washbasin is already full.Ill just need ten buckets for the rinsin basin.Done.She grinned and pointed at him.Youre glorious.He set a hand on his chest and 						offered a half bow.I try.Ill set to work.Where can I find the 						pump?She pointed toward the 						curtain drawn windows, swinging her hand right.When you leave the 						tenement, turn right.The pump will be three blocks down, set within an 						enclosed alley on your right.Whatever you do, dont leave Orange Street.Matthews jurisdiction changes from street to street, so youre better off 						not wanderin.Yes, madam.Might I ask where 						the pail is?She gestured toward a dented tin 						pail tucked beside two massive basins that sat on unevenly nailed wooden 						stands.Eight wool sacks, which were all filled to tipping with male 						clothing, were piled against the wall.He cringed at seeing those 						sacks.He didnt know much about laundry but that looked like a tremendous 						amount of work.He strode toward the pail.Once 						I bring all the water, Ill assist you with everything else.Leaning over, 						he swiped it up by the bent handle.Thank you.The day will be warm 						with the sun out the way it is.She pointed.You ought to remove your coat 						and waistcoat.And while youre at it, drape it over the washin basin.Ill 						launder both given the hospital never did.I appreciate that.Thank you.Robinson set the pail down again and stripped his coat and buttonless 						waistcoat, draping both across the large basin.Rolling each long linen 						sleeve up to his elbow, he slowly turned back toward the pail.Robinson paused and heatedly 						watched Georgia sashay out of the front room and into the kitchen.Her hands 						casually gathered up and bundled her long hair, knotting it into place.Narrow but shapely hips swayed and shifted beneath her frayed nightdress as 						she disappeared into the closet beyond and took to folding the rumpled linen 						on the straw bed.All the while she hummed a melodious ditty as if life were 						glorious now that he was fetching her ten pails of water.His jaw and every single last 						muscle in his body tightened as he continued to watch her with a yearning 						that almost choked him.How he wanted to replace that flash of a strangers 						nakedness still lingering in his head with her.All hed need do was stride over 						to that closet, grab her, shove up that nightdress and pound his lust into 						her and make it real.He swallowed and glanced away, 						lest he actually do it.It appeared he was done for.Because he not only 						wanted to pound his very body and soul into her, he wanted to see that woman 						every single goddamn morning for the rest of his life.He blew out a breath and 						snatched up the empty pail.Angling into the kitchen, he reached out and 						opened the entrance door.You should eat somethin along 						the way, Georgia called out from the closet, pulling out a gown from an 						open trunk.Ive no doubt youre hungry.Theres a jar with my food 						allowance in the cupboard beneath my bonnet and rosary.Two nickels ought to 						be more than enough.Have at it.Nobody will be able to give you change for 						full dollars here.Robinson grinned at the thought 						of food and swiveled back toward the cupboard.I will most certainly have 						at it.Im famished.Passing the closet, he glimpsed her stripping her 						nightdress, those ivory limbs catching the corner of his eye.His grin vanished as he averted 						his gaze with the snap of his chin toward his shoulder.Jogging over to the 						glass jar, he dug a hand into it and fished out two nickels with a scraping 						tink from 						the pile of coins covering the bottom.He dropped the coins into his right 						trouser pocket and stalked back over to the door, keeping his gaze affixed 						straight ahead and chanting to himself not to stray from his set plan to 						leave.I suggest you buy a baked yam 						off Martha, she called out again.Its on the way to the pump and will 						melt your tongue off.Just tell her I sent you and shell only charge a 						penny.Will do.Jumping out, he 						slammed the door behind him and momentarily leaned against it, bringing the 						pail against his knees.He was going to have to talk to Georgia about 						setting more boundaries.He couldnt have her stripping in front of him like 						that.Not unless she wanted him between her thighs.He hissed out a breath 						and pushed away from the door.Rounding to the narrow staircase 						that was lit by a dirty lone window pouring in skewed sunlight from above, 						he pounded his way down the oak stairs.He strode along the ashen passageway 						and out the entrance door that had been left open, illuminating a brightly 						lit dirt street filled with carts, horses, men, women and children hustling 						by.The stench that had assaulted him last night slammed against his 						nostrils again, taunting him to gag.He tightened his hold on the pail and 						swallowed back nausea, chanting to himself that if Georgia could survive 						breathing in this air, so could he.Charging out of the tenement and 						into the open, wide street, he veered right and into the boisterous crowds 						of shouting voices.He trailed past rows and rows of cracked, dirty windows 						and small, narrow doors leading into grocer and junk shops and other 						tenements.Most of the doors he passed appeared to have been smeared with 						greening black sludge that had been swiped off either peoples boots, their 						asses or a horses ass, orall of the above.He decided it was best to stay 						closer to the street itself as opposed to those doors and 					windows.The heat of the sun pierced 						through the blue sky, pulsing against the side of his shoulder, as it 						penetrated the linen of his shirt and his skin beneath.Each booted step he 						took made him realize he was going to be mopping up his own sweat within 						minutes.He wrinkled his nose and dodged 						an incredibly large pile of rotting cabbage and hay that had been mashed 						into horse dung.It was obvious where all the smells were coming 						from.Robinson eventually paused on 						the corner of a looming intersection where two wide streets crossed.Carts 						and horses pushed through throngs of dust and sweat covered people who were 						shouting out their wares and their business.He glanced over toward a 						lonely looking cart set against one of the buildings beside him.A short, dark skinned woman with 						razzed, curly black hair that had all been tucked into a small straw bonnet 						leaned against a wooden cart whose crooked sign had been scrawled with the 						unevenly painted words Baked Yams.Hed found his first 						destination: breakfast.Thank God.Walking over to her cart, the 						sweet sugary scent of whatever she was selling momentarily pushed out the 						stench of the street and made him realize he was not only hungry but damn 						well starving.He leaned toward the woman, who had yet to notice him.Martha, I presume?Good morning.Georgia said I should visit if I wanted my 						tongue melted off.So here I am.She grinned, her teeth 						shockingly white against her dark skin.Leaning toward him, she scanned the 						length of him from boot to face.Yous a good looking white 					boy.He eyed her, feeling his own 						face blooming with heat at the unexpected compliment.He cleared his throat.Uh, thank you.Oooh, and shy, too!Not many of 						those round here.Martha chuckled and bustled around the cart toward him, 						wiping her hands on her apron.Waving toward the small pile of odd shaped, 						melted looking brown tubes, she said, Pick yourself a fat one.He visually probed the pile and 						pointed to the largest one hidden against the tin platter set atop the cart.That one there looks friendly enough.Grabbing up a fork, she stabbed 						the one he had pointed out and swept it upright, holding the yam out toward 						him.A penny.Seeing you know Georgia.He grinned and took the fork 						from her.Setting down his pail, he dug into his pocket and pulled out a 						nickel.He held it out and carefully detached the warm yam from the 						prongs.She plucked the coin from his 						fingers, stabbing the fork back into one of the yams in her cart, and pulled 						away the collar of her gown, revealing a hidden leather satchel tied around 						her neck.She dropped the nickel into it and then dug into another satchel 						hidden beneath her apron.Pulling out a handful of pennies, she handed him 						back four and winked.Be sure to come on back now.He stuffed the pennies into his 						pocket and swiped up the pail.Leaning toward her, he smiled.If these yams 						are any good, madam, you will be seeing me on the hour.She laughed, reached out and 						smacked his backside hard.He jumped in astonishment and 						dodged past the cart before she took it into her head to do it again.When 						he had set enough of a distance between him and backside smacking Martha, he 						slowed and hesitantly brought the odd looking food into his mouth.He bit 						into its mushy softness, the sweet warmth coating his tongue like sugar and 						molasses.He groaned in amazement, almost falling over to the wall beside 						him.It was the best thing hed eaten since waking up in the hospital.When 						he was done getting all of Georgias water, he was definitely going back 						for more and didnt care how many times his backside got smacked for 						it.A scrawny girl with dirty bare 						feet and unkempt blond hair, wearing a lopsided sooty gown, darted in front 						of him.She held up an unraveling wicker basket filled with bundled matches.A cent a piece, suh, she pleaded, craning her thin neck all the way back 						to stare up at him.He shoved the remaining yam into 						his mouth and chewed it, slowly shaking his head from side to side as those 						big blue eyes begged in a way no words could.He held up a finger and 						lowered himself to a knee.Swallowing the last of the yam, he smiled.A 						cent a piece, you say?She nodded, pressing her lips 						together.So much for the rest of his 						breakfast.Digging into his pocket, he scooped out all he had and presented 						it with an open palm.If you can count how much I have in this here hand, 						the sale is yours.She eyed him and quickly leaned 						toward his open palm, her thin brows coming together.With a tiny 						dirt encrusted finger she pointed to each and every coin and mouthed the 						amount to herself.Upon finishing, she glanced up and announced, Nine 						cents.He grinned, genuinely impressed.Very good.You appear to be a woman of business.Now hold out your 						hand.She popped out a bare, cupped 						hand, staring at it with intent.Trying to keep a straight face, he placed 						each coin into it, one by one by one, to add to the drama of her 						sale.There you are, he announced.Nine 						cents.Shoving it into the pocket of 						her stained apron, she commenced industriously plucking up bundles of 						matches for the amount hed paid for.I only need one, he 						provided.She glanced up, dropping all the 						bundles back into her basket.You want your eight cents back, 					suh?He shook his head, still 						smiling.No.I only need one bundle of matches, but you earned an extra 						eight cents 						for being so impressive with your counting.She grinned, exposing two 						missing front teeth, and promptly held out his single bundle.You speak all 						gentlemanly like.He leaned down toward her, 						slipping the bundle from her bare fingers.That is because I am a gentleman.It was a 						pleasure doing business with you, miss.And you, suh.She bobbed a 						curtsy and dodged around him, disappearing.He straightened, swiping up his 						pail, and tucked the bundle of matches into his now empty pocket.It was 						money well spent.He strode down the remaining stretch of the street until 						he reached a pump that was tucked in a side alley to his right, and 						paused.A long line of white, black and 						mulatto women in bonnets and aprons lingered patiently with their pails, 						waiting for an older black woman to finish filling the pail that was set 						below the spigot.Drawing closer, he realized that he was the only man with 						a pail.The elderly black woman paused 						to swipe her brow with her heavily stained apron.She heaved out a breath 						and resumed pumping with trembling strokes.That quaking, thin arm and 						water spattered wool gown bespoke of the several visits shed already 						made.Refusing to watch the woman 						suffer, he quickly strode past the long line of women, set his pail down 						beside the pump with a clang and rounded the old woman.Allow me.Please.She glanced up, releasing the 						wooden handle, and blinked up at him past loosened strands of white, frizzy 						curling hair falling out her lopsided bonnet.Her gaunt face was heavily 						scarred with indentations similar to that of a whip, making those large 						black eyes and the whites around them all the more haunting.Stale sweat and 						bitter mulled wine drifted off her skin.Twas obvious this poor weathered 						and scarred face had seen very little kindness in her life.He smiled assuredly, sensing she 						didnt trust him, and reached out for the handle to demonstrate.I only 						wish to assist you, madam.She edged back, step by step, 						eyeing the pump until she had left him with enough room for him to take her 						place.Grabbing hold of the handle with 						his right hand, he pulled it up and pushed down hard, past the resistance, 						spraying cold water out and into the rusty pail.In three more solid pumps, 						it was full.He reached down, lifted the heavy pail and held it out for her.There you are.She hurried toward him.Hefting 						the pail out of his hands and into her own, she paused and blurted, Your 						motha done raised yah right, suh.Bless yah and bless her.She nodded in 						agreement with herself, turned and waddled away, heading back toward the 						street.Robinson grinned, watching the 						old woman waddle away.His mother, whoever she was, did indeed raise him 						right if he was able to still remember how to be a gentleman.It gave him a 						heaping measure of hope that perhaps Georgia was right.Perhaps someone, 						maybe even this mother of his, was out there missing him.Swinging back to sweep up his 						pail, he paused, his fingertips outstretched in midair.The long line of 						lingering women holding their empty pails had moved notably closer to him, 						some whispering to others from behind bare hands.Others even leaned over 						and stood up on their booted toes to get a better look at him past all the 						other bonnets.They behaved as if theyd never 						seen a man before.Good morning, ladies, he offered in an apologetic tone.Im not veering to the front of the line.I was just  No worries.Were much obliged, 						to be sure.You must be new round these parts.A young brunette with plump 						breasts bustled toward him, kicking up her dragging plaid skirts, and set 						her pail beneath the spigot of the pump.She stepped back and away, 						smoothing her hands against her dusty skirts, and smiled as if hed already 						offered to fill her bucket.He hesitated.Not wanting to be 						rude given that she clearly thought he had offered, he turned back to the 						pump.Grabbing hold of the wooden handle, he asked, Might I be of service 						to you, madam?She grinned, wringing her hands.Youd be the first.Hopefully not the last.He 						glanced around the small alley filled with women.Where are all the men in 						this town, anyway?They should all be out here saving your 					hands.A wave of giggles 						erupted.He blinked.Did they not think 						he was being serious?Though if all the men around these parts were anything 						like John and Matthew, it wasnt any wonder these poor women were out 						pumping their own water.After he filled the pail, the 						young brunette hurried forward to lift it, momentarily lingering before him.Meeting his gaze with wistful large brown eyes, she offered, I live just 						down the street at 31 with my mum.Shes hoping Ill marry soon.Ive been 						looking for a man, but findin one worth keepin is hard to come by in these 						parts.She paused and added, I make the best ash pones in town.You ought 						to come by sometime.Ah.He really had no idea what an ash pone 						was, but clearly her invitation was supposed to be a thank you, tossed in 						with a calling card, with a little bit of innuendo and possibly a marriage 						proposal.He inclined his head as politely as he knew how.I am already 						spoken for by a beautiful lady I hope to make mine, but I appreciate the 						offer all the same.Have a good day.As she departed, a pretty 						mulatto woman with stunning blue eyes hurried forward from the front of the 						line, setting her pail with a loud clang beneath the spigot.She set her 						chin, placing both caramel colored hands on curvaceous hips.And I thought 						there wasnt a damn gent left in this pig infested ward.Amen for you, suh.Amen.He laughed and grabbed hold of 						the handle again.It appeared Georgia was not going to be getting her water 						anytime soon.But then againthis could be a good thing.For maybe, just 						maybe, if he flexed his muscles long enough, Georgia would come hunting him 						down and he could take advantage of his popularity at the water pump by 						making her realize that he could be useful to a woman, after all, even if he were 						nameless.You must sit down, says Love, and taste my meat.So I did sit and eat.George Herbert, The Temple, Love (III) (1633) THE SUN HAD ALREADY SHIFTED across the sky, casting a change of light in the small front room that made Georgia pause from scrubbing a bundled shirt.Dropping the shirt back into the soapy water, which had long turned gray, she shook off water from her puckered hands and wiped them against her apron, turning toward the empty kitchen and the quiet entrance door.It was certainly taking Robinson an unusually long time to bring back one pail of water.More than an hour must have already passed.She hurried to the door, praying nothing had happened.Snatching her key off the table, she opened the door and latched it shut with a tug and a quick turn.Tucking the key into her apron, she gathered her calico skirts and descended the stairs, jogging through the main entrance door and out into the street.She paused and glanced down toward the direction of the pump, squinting against the heat of the bright sun.Through the bustling haze of dust, crowds, carts, horses and hucksters, she couldnt see a thing.Gathering her skirts, she dodged people until she finally made it to Marthas yam cart.She skidded to a halt and grabbed hold of Marthas arm, drawing the old woman toward herself.Martha.Did a tall, dark haired gent with bruises and scrapes on his face buy anythin from you this past hour?I sent him your way.Marthas round face brightened.That man sure as hell was tastier than anything I had to sell.A breath escaped her.Where did he go?Martha swept her roughened black hand down the street.That way.Had a pail with him, too.Georgia squeezed her arm.Thank you, Martha.She darted past the cart, gathering her skirts, and went back to dodging people on the pavement, praying that Robinson was still at the pump and that the line was merely longer than usual due to the blistery heat.Sweat pierced her face against the pulsing sun as she pushed her legs faster.Coming to the small alley, she jerked to a halt and scanned a long line of almost three dozen women.She paused.A man labored at the pump.Strands of his black hair fell in and out of his eyes with each downward thrust of a bulking muscled arm that stretched against the clinging wet linen of a snowy white shirt randomly stained with coffee.It was Robinson.Apparently, he had just gotten to the pump.Thank goodness.Robinson paused and then gestured rather grandly toward the pail, offering it to some woman in a straw bonnet.Georgia blinked as the woman leaned toward him and enthusiastically said something that made his mouth quirk, before she turned and teetered off with the weight of the bucket he had filled.Another young woman in patched wool skirts scurried forward and set another empty pail beneath the pump.She stepped aside, lingering with pinched lips that bespoke of barely restrained anticipation.Grabbing hold of the wood handle yet again, Robinson lifted and pushed it down with an anguished wince, forcing water out from the iron spigot and into the pail with a single gush.Georgia snapped her gaze toward the long line of women dreamily watching him as if he were an unusually pretty gown on display in a shop window.Her lips parted in astonishment.No wonder he hadnt come back!Shaking her head, she moved past the line of women.Rounding her way toward the side of the pump, she crossed her arms over her breasts and watched in mingled amusement and adoration as Robinsons bulking arm flexed against his sprayed, water dampened shirt.His linen shirt clung and outlined not only his impressive arms, but those broad shoulders and solid chest.Much like all the other women, she could have easily stood there watching him all day.Only she still had that darn laundry to do.Mr.Robinson Crusoe, she singsonged when he still hadnt noticed her.Whatever are you doin?He glanced up, midpump, his flushed, unshaven face reappearing.His brows rose as a slow, saucy grin overtook those rugged features.Well, well, well.If it isnt Georgia come to hunt me down.He smugly went back to pumping, angling his chest and his arm in a way that showcased his muscles.He heatedly held her gaze with each thrusting pump.Did you miss me?Tell me that you did and Ill ensure the next pail is yours.She lowered her chin in disbelief.Are you flirtin with me?At the water pump in front of half the ward?Really?Really.Still holding her gaze with unabashed heat, he willfully used the weight of his upper body in smooth, solid strokes to spray water out of the spigot and down into the open mouth of the pail.It was as evocative an image as if she were the pail and he the water.Would you rather we take this elsewhere, Georgia?We can.A ripple of awareness stroked its way to her stomach and all the way down to her booted toes.What on bloody earth had the water pump unleashed?Though she relished this new earthy and feral side of him, she was a little concerned.For if this version of Robinson decided to drag her into the low closet, she knew she wouldnt be able to say no.Drawing in a ragged breath, she let it out and headed toward him.I suggest you finish that there pail, fill the one you promised me and lets get back to doin laundry before the sun sets, shall we?Jealous?he called back, forcing two more solid pumps of water into the pail.Only because Ive been waitin an hour for one pail of water, she called back.When the woman who had been waiting bustled away, Robinson swiped up Georgias pail, set it beneath the spigot and offered up one last show.He pulled the handle up and pushed it down in a single stroke.Gritting his teeth, he worked the pump faster, shifting against the handle.When it was filled, Georgia swept in and grabbed the handle, lifting its pulling weight up and off the dirt.She smiled up at him.Thank you, Robinson.He lifted a brow.Dont you think I deserve a kiss for that?You are a flirt of the worst sort.He grinned.Be forewarned, this is only the beginning.I have decided to make you mine.Oh, have you, now?Yes.I have.He released the wood pump handle, swiping his sleeve against it, and pointed to the pail.Allow me.He grabbed its weight from her, transferring it into his right hand.Together, they strode back toward the street.Every female eye followed them out of the alley.Georgia set her chin and smugly took hold of Robinson by his free, muscled arm, leading him toward the pavement in a manner a wife would lead her husband.Naughty though it was, there were very few times in her life she had gotten to brag about anything, and he most certainly was something to brag about, gent that he was.As they both made their way down the street, she tightened her hold on his arm and glanced up at him with a dreamy smile.To be sure, a finer gent she had never known since Raymond.She blinked, her smile fading.Though he eagerly leaned into her, his gaze was fixed forward, his dark brows knitted together as if he were counting steps.His unshaven jaw was unusually tight, causing a lone muscle to flicker just beneath his cheekbone.He looked as if he were in pain.She released his tensing arm.Are you all right?His features softened as he glanced down toward her, never once breaking their stride.Of course I am.Why did you let go of my arm?I was rather enjoying that.Reassured, she teased, I think you were havin far more fun back there.He smiled awkwardly, adjusting his hand on the bucket.It was as if theyd never seen a man before.She laughed.Not at the pump, they havent.You werent out there pumpin water for those women the whole time you were gone, were you?Not the whole time, he admitted gruffly.I managed to swallow down a yam and spend nine cents on a bundle of matches before getting caught in a barrel of eyes and giggles.Nine cents for a bundle?Georgia groaned and smacked his arm.What?Were they spun of gold?Theyre only a penny apiece, you know.I know.He leaned toward her in between steps and said in an adoring voice, You should have seen this little moppet.Eyes as big as cornflowers.A smile like powdered sugar, even with two teeth missing.I would have gladly given her more if I had it.Bless his never ending, generous heart.That was very kind of you, Robinson, but you cant be givin away money to everyone around here.Youll walk away naked and still not feed them all.Yes, he murmured, nodding.I know.Veering back into the shade of her tenement, Georgia gathered her skirts and hurried up the stairs to unbolt the door.That was only the first pail, Brit, she called down as he mounted the stairs, coming up toward her.Youve got nine more to go, so I suggest you keep to pumpin only for yourself or Ill never get the laundry done.Yes, madam.Unbolting the door with the key, she pushed open the door and hurried back toward her basin of sitting laundry.Where do you want it?he asked.She grabbed up the heavy linen shirt soaking in the washing basin and bundled and twisted the fabric hard, squeezing out all the soapy water.She dumped it soundly into the empty rinsing basin and pointed.Right there.Thank you.My pleasure.He dumped the large pail of water into the basin with a rushing splash.She paused as droplets of rust colored water fell from the pail atop the freshly washed linen.As he turned away and headed toward the door, he shifted the pail into his other hand.Flexing the hand hed freed, he disappeared, leaving the door wide open.Georgia paused and glanced back at the stained linen she had just laundered, noting that the rinsing water hed dumped into the basin was its usual yellow tone.The droplets on the linen, however, were a rusty red.Bloodred.Oh, God.Those poor, untouched hands of his were probably rubbed raw after hed foolishly pumped water for half the ward.Quickly wiping her hands on her apron, she hurried out after him through the door hed left open and called down the stairs after him, Robinson?Robinson, will you come up here, please?He jerked to a halt on the bottom stair and turned back toward her.His dark brows rose as he jogged his way back up, the pail swinging from his movements.He thudded onto the landing before her.What is it?He smiled.Are you worried I may never come back?Because I promise you this time I will.She stepped toward him, took the pail out of his hand and set it aside.Meeting his gaze, she said softly, You were pumpin for quite some time.How are your hands?He fisted them and shrugged.Fine.She wagged her fingers.Show me how perfectly fine they are.Only then will I let you go back to the pump.Averting his gaze, he leaned over and swiped up the pail.You need water.Not at this price.She grabbed his arm.Youre done.There is no need to coddle me, Georgia.He freed his arm, turned and jogged down the stairs.Ill be back.She huffed out an exasperated breath.Damn him.He was only going to make it worse.Gathering her skirts, she rushed down the stairs and hurried after him.Before he could reach the entrance leading out into the street, she darted in front of him and slammed the oak door with a resounding bang so he couldnt leave.She swiveled toward him, setting her hands on her hips.Youre done for the day.Now get upstairs.He leaned down toward her.
