But in the end they couldnt.By early September the tobacco had been harvested and she had no choice but to return with her family to Winston Salem.Only the summer is over, Allie, not us, hed said the morning she left.Well never be over.But they were.For a reason he didnt understand, the letters he wrote went unanswered.He decided to leave New Bern to help get her off his mind, and also because the Depression made earning a living in New Bern almost impossible.He went first to Norfolk and worked at a shipyard for six months before he was laid off, then moved to New Jersey because hed heard the economy wasnt so bad there.He found a job in a scrap yard, separating scrap metal from everything else.The owner, a Jewish man named Morris Goldman, was intent on collecting as much scrap metal as he could, convinced that a war was going to start in Europe and that America would be dragged in again.Noah didnt care.He was just happy to have a job.He worked hard.Not only did it help him keep his mind off Allie during the day, but it was something he felt he had to do.His daddy had always said: Give a days work for a days pay.Anything less is stealing.That attitude pleased his boss.Its a shame you arent Jewish, Goldman would say, youre such a fine boy in so many other ways.It was the best compliment Goldman could give.He continued to think about Allie at night.He wrote to her once a month but never received a reply.Eventually he wrote one final letter and forced himself to accept the fact that the summer theyd spent with one another was the only thing theyd ever share.Still, though, she stayed with him.Three years after the last letter, he went to Winston Salem in the hope of finding her.He went to her house, discovered that she had moved and, after talking to some neighbours, finally called her fathers firm.The girl who answered was new and didnt recognize the name, but she poked around the personnel files for him.She found out that Allies father had left the company and that no forwarding address was listed.That was the first and last time he ever looked for her.For the next eight years he worked for Goldman.As the years dragged on, the company grew and he was promoted.By 1940 he had mastered the business and was running the entire operation, brokering the deals and managing a staff of thirty.The yard had become the largest scrap metal dealer on the east coast.During that time he dated a few different women.He became serious with one, a waitress from the local diner with deep blue eyes and silky black hair.Although they dated for two years and had many good times together, he never came to feel the same way about her as he did about Allie.She was a few years older than he was, and it was she who taught him the ways to please a woman, the places to touch and kiss, the things to whisper.Towards the end of their relationship shed told him once, I wish I could give you what youre looking for, but I dont know what it is.Theres a part of you that you keep closed off from everyone, including me.Its as if your mind is on someone else.Its like you keep waiting for her to pop out of thin air to take you away from all this A month later she visited him at work and told him shed met someone else.He understood.They parted as friends, and the following year he received a postcard from her saying she was married.He hadnt heard from her since.In December 1941, when he was twenty six, the war began, just as Goldman had predicted.Noah walked into his office the following month and informed Goldman of his intent to enlist, then returned to New Bern to say goodbye to his father.Five weeks later he found himself in training camp.While there, he received a letter from Goldman thanking him for his work, together with a copy of a certificate entitling him to a small percentage of the scrap yard if it was ever sold.I couldnt have done it without you, the letter said.Youre the finest young man who ever worked for me, even if you arent Jewish.He spent his next three years with Pattons Third Army, tramping through deserts in North Africa and forests in Europe with thirty pounds on his back, his infantry unit never far from action.He watched his friends die around him; watched as some of them were buried thousands of miles from home.He remembered the war ending in Europe, then a few months later in Japan.Just before he was discharged he received a letter from a lawyer in New Jersey representing Morris Goldman.Upon meeting the lawyer he found out that Goldman had died a year earlier and his estate had been liquidated.The business had been sold, and Noah was given a cheque for almost seventy thousand dollars.The following week he returned to New Bern and bought the house.He remembered bringing his father around later, pointing out the changes he intended to make.His father seemed weak as he walked, coughing and wheezing.Noah was concerned, but his father told him not to worry, assuring him that he had the flu.Less than one month later his father died of pneumonia and was buried next to his wife in the local cemetery.Noah tried to stop by regularly to leave some flowers; occasionally he left a note.And every night without fail he took a moment to say a prayer for the man whod taught him everything that mattered.AFTER REELINGin the line, he put the gear away and went back to the house.His neighbour, Martha Shaw, was there to thank him, bringing three loaves of homemade bread in appreciation for what hed done.Her husband had been killed in the war, leaving her with three children and a shack to raise them in.Winter was coming, and hed spent a few days at her place last week repairing her roof, replacing broken windows and sealing the others, and fixing her wood stove.He hoped it would be enough to get them through.Once shed left, he got into his battered Dodge truck and went to see Gus.He always stopped there when he was going to the store, because Guss family didnt have a car.One of the daughters hopped up and rode with him, and they did their shopping at Capers General Store.When he got home he didnt unpack the groceries right away.Instead he showered, found a Budweiser and a book by Dylan Thomas, and went to sit on the porch.SHE STILLhad trouble believing it, even as she held the proof in her hands.It had been in the newspaper at her parents house three Sundays ago.She had gone to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee, and when shed returned to the table her father had smiled and pointed at a small picture.Remember this?He handed her the paper and, after an uninterested first glance, something in the picture caught her eye and she took a closer look.It cant be, she whispered, and when her father looked at her curiously she ignored him, sat down and read the article without speaking.She vaguely remembered her mother coming to the table and sitting opposite her, and when she finally put aside the paper her mother was staring at her.Are you okay?she asked over her coffee cup.You look a little pale.Allie didnt answer right away, she couldnt, and it was then that shed noticed her hands were shaking.That had been when it started.And here it will end, one way or the other, she whispered again.She refolded the scrap of paper and put it back, remembering that she had left her parents home later that day with the paper so she could cut out the article.She read it again before she went to bed that night, trying to fathom the coincidence, and read it again the next morning as if to make sure the whole thing wasnt a dream.And now, after three weeks of long walks alone, after three weeks of distraction, it was the reason shed come.When asked, she said her erratic behaviour was due to stress.It was the perfect excuse; everyone understood, including Lon, and thats why he hadnt argued when shed wanted to get away for a couple of days.The wedding plans were stressful to everyone involved.Almost five hundred people were invited, including the governor, one senator and the ambassador to Peru.It was too much, in her opinion, but their engagement was news and had dominated the social pages since they had announced their plans six months ago.She took a deep breath and stood again.Its now or never, she whispered, then picked up her things and went to the door.She went downstairs and the manager smiled as she walked by.She could feel his eyes on her as she went out to her car.She slipped behind the wheel, started the engine and turned right onto Front Street.She still knew her way around the small town, even though she hadnt been here in years.After crossing the Trent River on an old fashioned drawbridge, she turned onto a gravel road that wound its way between antebellum farms, and she knew that, for some of the farmers, life hadnt changed since before their grandparents were born.The constancy of the place brought back a flood of memories as she recognized landmarks shed long ago forgotten.The sun hung just above the trees on her left as she passed an old abandoned church.She had explored it that summer, looking for souvenirs of the War between the States, and, as she passed, the memories of that day became stronger, as if theyd happened yesterday.A majestic oak tree on the riverbank came into view next, and the memories became more intense.It looked the same as it had back then, branches low and thick, stretching horizontally along the ground with moss draped over the limbs like a veil.She remembered sitting beneath the tree on a hot July day with someone who looked at her with a longing that took everything else away.And it had been at that moment that shed first fallen in love.He was two years older than she was, and as she drove along this roadway in time, he slowly came into focus once again.He always looked older than he really was, she remembered thinking, slightly weathered, like a farmer coming home after hours in the field.He had the calloused hands and broad shoulders that came to those who worked hard for a living, and the first faint lines were beginning to form around dark eyes that seemed to read her every thought.He was tall and strong, with light brown hair, and handsome in his own way, but it was his voice that she remembered most of all.He had read to her that day as they lay beneath the tree with an accent that was soft and fluent, almost musical in quality.She remembered closing her eyes, listening closely and letting the words he was reading touch her soul.He thumbed through old books with dog eared pages, books hed read a hundred times.Hed read for a while, then stop, and the two of them would talk.She would tell him what she wanted in her life her hopes and dreams for the future and he would listen intently and then promise to make it all come true.And the way he said it made her believe him, and she knew then how much he meant to her.Another turn in the road and she finally saw the house in the distance.It had changed dramatically from what she remembered.She slowed the car, turning into the long, tree lined dirt drive.She took a deep breath when she saw him on the porch, watching her car.He was dressed casually.From a distance, he looked the same as he had back then.When the light from the sun was behind him, he almost seemed to vanish into the scenery.Her car continued forward slowly, then finally stopped beneath an oak tree that shaded the front of the house.She turned the key, never taking her eyes from him, and the engine sputtered to a halt.He stepped off the porch and began to approach her, walking easily, then suddenly stopped cold as she emerged from the car.For a long time all they could do was stare at each other without moving.Allison Nelson, twenty nine years old and engaged, a socialite, searching for answers, and Noah Calhoun, the dreamer, thirty one, visited by the ghost that had come to dominate his life.NEITHER ONE of them moved as they faced each other.He hadnt said anything, and for a second she thought he didnt recognize her.Suddenly she felt guilty about showing up this way, without warning, and it made it harder.She had thought that she would know what to say.But she didnt.Everything that came into her head seemed inappropriate, somehow lacking.As she stared at him, she noticed how little hed changed since shed last seen him.He looked good, she thought.With his shirt tucked loosely into old faded jeans, she could see the same broad shoulders she remembered, tapering down to narrow hips and a flat stomach.He was tanned, too, as if hed worked outside all summer, and, though his hair was a little thinner and lighter than she remembered, he looked the same as he had when shed known him last.She took a deep breath and smiled.Hello, Noah.Its good to see you again.He looked at her with amazement in his eyes.Then, after shaking his head slightly, he slowly began to smile.You too, he stammered.He brought his hand to his chin, and she noticed he hadnt shaved.Its really you, isnt it?I cant believe it  She heard the shock in his voice as he spoke, and surprising her it all came together being here, seeing him.She felt something twitch inside, something deep and old, something that made her dizzy for just a second.She caught herself fighting for control.She hadnt expected this to happen, didnt want it to happen.She was engaged now.She hadnt come here for this.Yet.Yet the feeling went on despite herself, and for a brief moment she felt fifteen again.Felt as she hadnt in years, as if all her dreams could still come true.Felt as though shed finally come home.Without another word they came together, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, and he put his arms around her, drawing her close.They held each other tightly; both of them letting the fourteen years of separation dissolve in the deepening twilight.They stayed like that for a long time before she finally pulled back to look at him.Up close, she could see the changes she hadnt noticed at first.His face had lost the softness of youth.The faint lines around his eyes had deepened.There was a new edge to him; he seemed less innocent, more cautious, and yet the way he was holding her made her realize how much shed missed him.Her eyes brimmed with tears as they finally released each other.She laughed nervously while wiping the corners of her eyes.Are you okay?he asked, a thousand other questions on his face.Im sorry, I didnt mean to cry.Its okay, he said, smiling.I still cant believe its you.How did you find me?She stepped back, trying to compose herself, wiping away the last of her tears.I saw the story on the house in the Raleigh paper a couple of weeks ago, and I had to come and see you again.Noah smiled broadly.Im glad you did.He stepped back.You look fantastic.Youre even prettier now than you were then.She felt the blood in her face.Just like fourteen years ago.Thank you.You look great, too.And he did, no doubt about it.So what have you been up to?Why are you here?His questions brought her back to the present, making her realize what could happen if she wasnt careful.Dont let this get out of hand, she told herself; the longer it goes on, the harder its going to be.And she didnt want it to get any harder.She turned away and took a deep breath, wondering how to say it, and when she finally started, her voice was quiet.Noah, before you get the wrong idea, I did want to see you again, but theres more to it than just that.She paused for a second.I came here for a reason.Theres something I have to tell you.What is it?She looked away and didnt answer for a moment, surprised that she couldnt tell him just yet.In the silence, Noah felt a sinking feeling in his stomach.Whatever it was, it was bad.I dont know how to say it.I thought I did at first, but now Im not so sure  The air was suddenly rattled by the sharp cry of a raccoon, and Clem came out from under the porch, barking gruffly.Both of them turned at the commotion, and Allie was glad for the distraction.Is he yours?she asked.Noah nodded, feeling the tightness in his stomach.Actually its a she.Clementines her name.But yeah, shes all mine.They both watched as Clem stretched, then wandered towards the sounds.Allies eyes widened just a bit when she saw her limp away.What happened to her leg?she asked, stalling for time.Hit by a car a few months back.Doc Harrison, the vet, called me to see if I wanted her because her owner didnt any more.After I saw what had happened, I guess I just couldnt let her be put down. "You were always nice like that, she said, trying to relax.She looked past him towards the house.You did a wonderful job restoring it.It looks perfect, just like I knew it would some day.He turned his head in the same direction as hers while he wondered about the small talk and what she was holding back.Thanks, thats nice of you.It was quite a project, though.I dont know if I would do it again.Of course you would, she said.She knew exactly how he felt about this place.But then she knew how he felt about everything  or at least she had a long time ago.And with that she realized they were strangers now.Fourteen years apart was a long time.Too long.What is it, Allie?He turned to her, but she continued to stare at the house.Im being rather silly, arent I?she asked, trying to smile.What do you mean?This whole thing.Showing up out of the blue, not knowing what I want to say.You must think Im crazy.Youre not crazy, he said gently.He reached for her hand, and she let him hold it as they stood next to one another.He went on:  Even though I dont know why, I can see this is hard for you.Why dont we go for a walk?Like we used to?Why not?I think we both could use one.She hesitated and looked to his front door.Do you need to tell anyone?He shook his head.Theres no one to tell.Its just me and Clem.Even though she had asked, she had suspected there wouldnt be anyone else, and inside she didnt know how to feel about that.But it did make what she wanted to say a little harder.It would have been easier if there was someone else.They started towards the river and turned onto a path near the bank.She let go of his hand and walked on with just enough distance between them so that they couldnt accidentally touch.He looked at her.She was still pretty, with thick hair and soft eyes, and she moved so gracefully that it seemed as though she were gliding.Hed seen beautiful women before, women who caught his eye, but to his mind they usually lacked the traits he found most desirable.Traits like intelligence, confidence, strength of spirit, passion, traits that inspired others to greatness, traits he aspired to himself.Allie had those traits, he knew, and as they walked now he sensed them once again lingering beneath the surface.A living poem had always been the words that came to mind when he tried to describe her to others.How long have you been back here?she asked as the path gave way to a small grass hill.Since last December.I worked up north for a while, then spent the last three years in Europe.She looked at him with questions in her eyes.The war?He nodded and she went on.I thought you might be there.Im glad you made it out okay.Me too, he said.Are you glad to be back home?Yeah.My roots are here.This is where Im supposed to be.He paused.But what about you?He asked the question softly, suspecting the worst.It was a long moment before she answered.Im engaged.He looked down when she said it, suddenly feeling just a bit weaker.So that was it.Thats what she needed to tell him.Congratulations, he finally said, wondering how convincing he sounded.Whens the big day?Three weeks.Lon wanted a November wedding.Lon?Lon Hammond Junior.My fianc  He nodded.The Hammonds were one of the most powerful and influential families in the state.Cotton money.Unlike that of his own father, the death of Lon Hammond Senior had made the front page of the newspaper.Ive heard of them.His father built quite a business.Did Lon take over for him?She shook her head.No, hes a lawyer.He has his own practice.With his name, he must be busy.He is.He works a lot.He thought he heard something in her tone, and the next question came automatically.Does he treat you well?She didnt answer right away, as if she were considering the question for the first time.Then: Yes.Hes a good man, Noah.Youd like him.Her voice was distant when she answered, or at least he thought it was.Noah wondered if it was just his mind playing tricks on him.Hows your daddy doing?she asked.Noah took a couple of steps before answering.He passed on earlier this year, right after I got back.Im sorry, she said softly.He nodded, and they walked on in silence.They reached the top of the hill and stopped.The oak tree was in the distance, with the sun glowing orange behind it.
