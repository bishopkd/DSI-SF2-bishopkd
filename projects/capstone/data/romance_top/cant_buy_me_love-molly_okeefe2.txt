And she wished she could die too.But she woke up the next morning and stared into his open eyes.Im thirsty, hed said, and shed wept buckets of tears.The doctors warned that he wasnt out of the woods yet, but every morning he woke up and she knew, despite the way her life had been stripped down to the bone, that she was blessed.But now, she looked at Jacob and she was tired.Tired of worrying.Of doubt.Of fear.Of being inadequate to every task.He was her blessing, and she wasnt sure how to take care of him.Her mother would say she needed a man.Someone to replace Joel as a payer of bills, a provider of security.That had been her mothers solution to every problem.Thank you, she said, and Ruby stood, wincing when her knees creaked, pulling the hem of her shirt down past her tummy.I know this isnt your job.Youre right.Victoria gaped at the woman; honestly, she wasnt like any housekeeper Victoria had ever knownand shed known her share.It was amazing the woman had a job.But its nice to have a child here.Her round face creased with a wide smile and Victoria relaxed.Hes a good boy.Yes, he is, she whispered, feeling fragile against the glare of the sun, the slight cool breeze.Her fathers words, while not unexpected, had stripped her raw.Left her sore.Hey, Mom, Jacob said, barely looking up from his small army of Autobots.Heya, bud, how you feeling?Jacob just rolled his eyes, no doubt tired of the question.He needed his inhaler, Ruby said.Twice.I always need my inhaler, Jacob said, his voice too old.Too over it all.It wasnt bad.And Ruby pulled a pink rubber pancake out from the back pocket of her jeans.This.Boy about gave me a heart attack.The whoopee cushion.She was going to kill Luc for giving that to Jacob.Jacob laughed and Victoria arched a silencing eyebrow.Sorry, she muttered, taking the toy.Myfather seemed to have had some kind ofattack, she added, thinking Ruby should know, since she seemed to know everything that happened on the ranch.Is he okay?Rubys panicked sadness stunned Victoria.Silenced her.How in the world did that man inspire such warmth in other people, in servants, rude ones at that, when his children were left shivering in the cold?II dont know.Just like that, Ruby disappeared back into the house.Grandpa okay?Grandpa.That word out of her little boys mouth made her teeth itch.Her heart burn.I think so, she hedged.What do you say we take our stuff out of the truck I thought we werent staying long.Theyd taken only their overnight bags into the ranch house last night, but their suitcasesfor their worst case scenariowere still in the car.Well, were going to be here awhile, pardner.So help me out.Lucs giant SUV rental crouched in the parking area like a big black monster.Same kind of car Joel would have driventhe kind of car that made every other person on the planet seem small.Insignificant.Something to be rolled over.Luc liked it because he was a big man, with big shoulders and long legs.Joel liked it because he was a small man.With a tiny penis.You need some help?a rough voice like steel wool asked over her shoulder.She spun, startled to find a man, tall and thin, standing far too close.He wore a dusty denim shirt, unbuttoned at the neck to reveal collarbones and damp skin.He smelled like sunshine and horse.Excuse me, she said, her voice sharp, and the man shifted back.He wore a big cowboy hat and the sun behind him made it impossible to see his face.Sorry.She didnt know if he was smiling, but something in his voice sounded like he was mocking her.She tried to see beneath the hat, but he shifted away, reaching past her for the bag.His arm was inches from her face, and she could smell the sweat of him.Earthy and masculine.Whatwhat are you doing?She sounded affronted, which wasnt entirely what she intended.She was just so off balance.Getting your bag.Now, when he turned she could see under his hat.Green eyes stared holes through her.A thick, full mouth smiled, but again, the emotion behind it didnt seem kind.You dont recognize me?She blinked, feeling somehow suspended by his gaze.Removed from the hard packed earth, the sun baked metal of the car at her back.Should I?She felt his hot breath against her cheek; his eyes touched every part of her face.I guess not.He pulled the luggage down and set it on the ground, popping the handle up.He turned slightly and tugged his hat at Jacob, who stood slack jawed with delight.Yall have a good day, the man said, and then he was gone and she crashed back into her physical reality.Who was that?Jacob asked as if theyd just been visited by Superman.I have no idea.4 The door to Lyles room opened a sliver and a very different Tara Jean slipped into the hallway.She was limp, exhaustion like a blanket over her shoulders, dimming her impressive wattage.Lucs heart spiked hard and he stood up from the chair hed been waiting in.Is he okay?She jerked at the sound of his voice, her hand covering her throat in surprise.You spooked me.Her hand stayed at her chest, covering the bare skin at her neck as if she were suddenly too naked.It was a nice act, as far as suddenly demure tramps went.He didnt apologize and they stood there in a simmering silence.Two feet and a thousand miles of differences between them.The sun from the window at the far end of the hallway highlighted both her beautythe perfect skin and the lush lipsand her flaws.The small lines around her eyes and mouth.The spray of freckles across her nose.She looked almost normalwell, as normal as a woman that beautiful could look.Is he okay?he repeated, and she nodded.Good.He pushed past her for the door.But she got her tiny body right in the way.Hes resting, she said, each word enunciated through her teeth.A guard dog with a push up bra.Honestly, he was nearly charmed.Ill wake him.I dont think you understand whats happening here, she said.Hes dying.And its not a matter of months.You go in there and it might not even be days.He smiled, leaning close.We cant have that, can we?Not until after the wedding, right?It looked like she was chewing her tongue, but then her smile spread across her face, as bright and empty as a pickle jar.Thats right, sugar, she said.Try not to kill him before I get my hands on all that money.Youre a piece of work, he said, disgust slipping over him.And youre going to kill him if you go in there worked up like you are.Cool your heels and try again later.Her eyes raked him, stripping off his clothes and a few dozen pounds, and then she left as if trusting her good sense to have swayed him, or maybe she just didnt care all that much.Either way, it was a mistake for her to leave, because when she turned the corner he slipped into the room.The skeleton was unconscious on the bed, so still it was as if his body were held in suspended animation.Is he dead?Lucs ribs were an empty net.Then he noticed that Lyles chest rose and fell in time with the gasping machine beside the bed.The mask over his mouth fogged and then cleared with every breath.Not dead.Yet.Luc stepped closer.Closer again.Close enough to see the old mans big hands hidden among the hills and valleys of the blue blanket thrown over him.He stopped.It was an old ingrained habit: staying close enough to see his hands, but just out of reach in case the old man got it in his head to take a swing.Seemed unlikely at the moment, but Luc wouldnt count Lyle out until they had six feet of dirt over his coffin.Lucs heart pounded hard in his neck and he tilted his chin, stretched his throat, trying to make the pounding go away.Years ago hed dealt with this crap.His fucking daddy issues.They were gone.Sliced to ribbons under a hundred pairs of skates.He was known for his cool on the ice.He played without emotion, with total control.A machine.Ice Man.But here he was with one eye on the old mans hands, his other on the door, as if he were ten years old.And scared.Growing up, Luc had been small for his age.Something that used to infuriate Lyle, as if Luc were refusing to grow just to spite him.Those beatingsit had been as though he was trying to force Lucs bones to comply to his will.But when Luc turned fifteen, everything changed.In four months hed gained fifteen pounds and five inches.He remembered, because for the first time hed been excited to go down to Texas and show Lyle that he couldnt be pushed around anymore.That he wasnt puny.Or chicken shit.An embarrassment.That winter, awake at night with growing pains, Luc had nursed dreams, elaborate and extensive visions of kicking the ever loving shit out of his father.But his mom must have caught wind, because he didnt go to Texas that summer.Instead, Celeste had signed him up for hockey camps and touring leagues.And then hockey took over his life.His love for the game, his natural affinity, the home he found among the guysit became the fire that fueled him.Visits to the ranch became fewer and farther between.He stopped going down during the summers.Never went at all during the winter.March break had been about it.On the bed, Lyle coughed and then wheezed, his head shifting against the pillow.The oxygen mask slipped, revealing thin, pale lips, and Lyle gasped.Gasped again.Luc watched, waiting to be moved.Waiting to care.Your father is dying.Right now.In front of your eyes.But it didnt happen.The dying or the giving a shit about it.Part of Lucs shit kicking fantasy had involved a little speech hed give Lyle while the old man was lying in the dirt, his nose broken and his lip bloodied.It was a good speech, changed and tweaked some throughout the years.And it was a shame Lyle had never heard it.Luc had given that speech once to a woman, the night the Canadian Juniors won the Worlds.That night hed watched teammate after teammate get hugged by fathers with tears in their eyes.Teammate after teammate invited their dads to come celebrate, and so he spent the whole night surrounded by so much fatherly pride it ruined the victory.Turned the whole night sour.So, hed picked up one of those puck bunnies whod been waiting for a shot to add his sweater number to her list of conquests.Surly and poisonous, hed gotten drunk and laid.And when the girl asked what he was so angry about, he gave her the speech.Weaving at the foot of the bed, wearing his boxers and clutching an empty bottle of vodkaa champion with nothing but a bright future to look forward tohe told Lyle Baker what a shit father he had been.How every single good thing Luc managed to accomplish had nothing to do with being a Baker.That in the end, Lyle would die.Alone.Unloved.The words of that speech were burned into his brain.Unforgotten.After all these years.After Olympic Gold.Stanley Cup Finals.He was an elite athlete.Paid a fortune.Respected by the world.And he couldnt let go of those words.His body twitched with adrenaline, and he couldnt outrun it or even slow it down.He stepped closer to the bed, where Lyles gasps were fast and shallow, the plastic edge of that oxygen mask cutting into his chin.Get up!he wanted to shout.Wake up, you coward!Let me tell you what a shitty father you were.Let me tell you how much I hate what youre putting my sister through.Let me tell you how much it sickens me to even think of you even looking at Jacob.He told himself that he was just here to protect his sister, but part of him was here for another shot at his dad.Another crack at the speech.The split lip.All of it.But, looking at the gasping dying skeleton, he realized it wasnt going to happen.He was never going to get satisfaction from Lyle.Even if the old man were healthy and whole, he wouldnt care what Luc thought of him.Why the realization always came as a surprise, he couldnt say.Youre better than this, he told himself, the way he had year after year.Disappointment after disappointment.You dont need this man in any way.You never did.Brick by brick he rebuilt the wall he kept in front of the red eyed temper hed inherited from his father.Brick by brick he made it stronger.Thicker.Impenetrable.His control had to be complete if he was going to take care of his family.Get rid of the bimbo and get back to his life on the ice.The adrenaline deflated and the cold air that filled him every other day of his life returned, pushing the anger back into the corners and crawl spaces, where it had lived for the last twenty years.He was Luc Baker, leader of the Cavaliers, and he had nothing to do with the corpse on the bed.At long last, Luc lifted his hand and shifted the oxygen mask back over his fathers mouth and nose, allowing him to breathe.Tara Jean pushed another yellow Mike and Ike through the barbed wire fence.Right into the sloppy mouth of one of the cows.Please, she thought, wiping off the cow slobber on her jeans.Please let me have done the right thing.Telling Luc not to go into his fathers room seemed like the most surefire way to insure he would go into the room, like waving a red cape in front of a bull.And granted the plan had all the sophistication of a Hallmark Special, but she had to hope that once he was in the room Luc would take a good look at what his father had become and if there was a working heart inside that big ol chest of his, it might be moved.She had to pray that Luc would see his father for the lonely, pained man he was.So desperate to see his family hed concocted this ridiculous scheme.Lyle was dying.Only an animal would look at his flesh and blood and not care.Right?All the shit her mother had done to her and Tara still managed to sob like a child in the hospital when her mother died.And Lyle may have been a doozy of a parent, but he had nothing on Rayanne.Excuse me, the demon muttered.Im right here.What do you think, cow?She looked into the beautiful bovine eyes of the candy addict shed created.Did I do the right thing?The cow lowed softly and blew a raspberry past big elastic lips.Yeah, she whispered, her heart a clump of dirt in her chest, probably not.Her skin broke out in goose bumps seconds before she heard someone coming up behind her.There was only one person on this ranchhell, maybe in the worldthat could give her skin a reason to wake up.I imagine you went in?she asked when the footsteps stopped behind her.She knew, to the inch, how far away he was, her body doing the finite math between her flesh and his.Of course I went in.His voice cool and filled to the brim with mocking superiority.With Lucs arrival, the cow shook her head, making her ears flop.The bovine equivalent of a hair toss.Tara Jean rolled her eyes.Honestly, some women couldnt get past a set of shoulders.So?She turned on her heel.The sun was behind him, set against that blue eye shadow sky.Judging by the scowl on his face there had been no deathbed revelation.His hate was rooted all the way down.Plan Deathbed Reconciliation had not worked.Which was not surprising.It was a pretty crappy plan.Is he still breathing?She cracked the hard shell of a red candy with her teeth.His smile was the meanest thing shed ever seen.And shed been on the receiving end of some maliciousness in her life.Oh, stop, she said, tired already of the theatrics.You cant scare me.Luc took another step closer, his beautiful calf skin loafers covered in fine Texas dust, and all of her warning signals and alarm bells clamored for her to step away.Out of reach.But she stood her ground.Im only going to say this once.Luc took off his sunglasses, revealing his daddys deep hazel eyes.Good God, the man was cold!She needed a sweater just to be this close to him.Youre not going to marry my father.Really?she asked, playing her part without much conviction.And whys that?Because I will make your life hell.A will is a will.And you can argue he wasnt in his right mind and all that stuff.She waved her hand around as if she just couldnt be bothered with the legalities of it all.But theres not a judge in this part of the world that will see it your way.And you know it.His narrowed eyes delighted her, sent her inner self soaring.Those sticks she poked at him had found their target.I dont care about his money.She snorted.People might say they didnt care about money, but those people were liars.Im talking about your life.Jane.Her skin shrank.Her bravado cracked like that candy shell between her teeth.Jane.How You think Im stupid?As stupid as my father?I hired a private investigatorand you hid your tracks well, you really did.Tara Jean Sweet doesnt exist.Not really.No phone.No address.My dad must pay you in cash, right?A couple hundreds on the bedside table?She clenched her fists, refusing to rise to his lame bait.But four years ago a woman named Jane Simmons was in the hospital at the same time as my father.A woman fitting your description.She knew she should have dyed her hair.If she were a brunette, they probably wouldnt be having this discussion.Changing my name isnt against the law.No.But my investigator isnt finished yet.And the reporters havent even gotten started.Chewing her tongue, she forced herself to stay where she was.To stand her ground, because the only man in the world who believed in her had paid her to stand here and take Luc Bakers shit.The reporters, particularly the Sports guystheyre relentless.And theyre the ones who would be on you, because if you marry Lyle youre stepping into my world, honey.You know what those parasites would do to a woman like you?he asked.Theyll dig up all your little secrets.Every inch of dirt and filth you keep hidden behind that smile.She swallowed.There was so much filth behind her smile, he had no idea.And I suppose youve got all that power?she asked.One word, he purred, managing to be both evil and seductive.One press conference.One photo.I can ruin your life.Right.One photo.Anger settled in along her spine.Righteous fury on behalf of the man dying inside that ranch.Mr.Big Shot, she cooed, inching closer even though it made her skin hurt.All that power and youd waste it on me?He started to smirk but she kept talking, using far less sugar and much more poison.When you couldnt be bothered five years ago to save your fathers company?That he looked confused ignited her own back alley temper.You dont remember?she asked.Remember what?Your father meeting you in Houston, asking you to wear his boots.Have your photo taken.One photo.As a favor.You have no idea what youre even talking about.We hadnt spoken in years and he shows up at my hotel asking for favors.After the way that man treated my sister and me, he had no right to think I would wear his crappy boots.He was desperate, she said, through gritted teeth.And you are his son.Immediately she knew shed crossed some line.But she had so many lines in her rearview mirror that another one wouldnt change a thing.He had his first stroke after that meeting, she told him, sharpening the sticks shed carried for four long years on Lyles behalf.The first of three that put him in the hospital a year later.In intensive care.She had the powerful feeling of being assessed.Measured.And she knew clear as day that shed come up wanting in his eyes.If youre trying to make me feel guilty, its not going to work.He stood there, immoveable.A glacier of cold, hard purpose.It was rather familiar; she had, in fact, been trying to manipulate and placate a similar glacier for the last four years.But Lyle had a living, scheming heart under all that ice and enough fire to keep him alive long after doctors predictions.Luc seemed like he was ice to the core.Youre a lot like your daddy.She expected him to get angry.Braced herself for it.But he laughed.You have no idea what Im like.He looked down at his watch.Im going to take my sister and nephew back home where they belong and Im going to give you a week to pack up your lipstick and high heels and get the hell away from this family Or?She looked down at the chipped paint on her thumbnail.Honestly, was there a bigger lie in the world than chip proof?He stepped closer, his suit jacket pressing against her hands, and she dropped them to her sides.Suddenly, she wished she hadnt baited him.For a woman who was trying to just do her part and stay out of the way, shed managed to position herself right out in front of the cannons.Listen, he sneered.You trash eating Trash eating?He blinked, stunned slightly off course, which had been the point.Thats a new one, she said.Truly.I had you pegged as a traditionalist.I expected gold digger or even just whore, but trash eating?Really, if your opinion mattered even the slightest bit, that one might sting.Marry him, he said, breathing sparks and lightning bolts that burned through her bluster and scorched her throat, her skin, and there wont be a rock you can hide under.Is there a problem here?Eli, the ninja, appeared behind Luc, breaking the charged atmosphere.And Tara took a much needed step back, searching for clear air and distance, quickly gathering the ragged ends of her composure.Trouble, she thought, this man is pure trouble for me.No, Luc answered, his eyes raking and then dismissing her.He glanced sideways at Eli and then did a double take.Eli.I didnt realize you were still on the ranch.Where else would I be?Eli asked, making it somehow seem like an insult, and she wanted to hug him.Buy them some team jerseys.I suppose youre right.Luc looked at Eli with warmth that was not only surprising, but slightly disarming.Even Elis ninja ness seemed to wilt.But its good to see you.Hows your dad?Tara didnt have the capacity for small talk, not after being threatened so effectively, so she turned back to the barbed wire fence and took a few steps away from the two men.The sugar addict cow followed, and Tara opened her palm.The candy had melted into sticky red goo and she held out her hand for the cow to clean it.Jane Simmons.She hadnt heard that name in four years.Hadnt thought of that girl since she buried her.She heard Luc leave and her spine relaxed.You know these cows are on highly restricted and carefully monitored diets, dont you?Eli asked over her shoulder.This girl has a sweet tooth, she said with a shrug.What can you do?Eli touched her shoulder and she flinched, feeling brittle and sun scorched.You okay?he asked.No, she thought.Shed sold her soul one too many times.And it was getting a little threadbare.Right as rain, she said, smiling brightly.She turned, making sure not to look Eli in the eye.I better get to work, its a busy day.Sample sewing and all.Youre not fooling anyone, Eli said.She wanted to laugh.Im fooling everyone, she thought.5 Luc couldnt find anyone.Not his sister.Not Jacob.Even Ruby was missing.Or maybe he just wasnt looking in the right places.A whole new wing of the house had sprung up since hed been here last and every time he thought he knew where he was going, he kept walking into the empty kitchen.It was, no doubt, Bimbo Barbies work.Every one of Lyles mistresses and wives had put their mark on this house in some way.And it only made sense that Tara Jeans contribution would turn it into a maze.On his third trip through the kitchen, he opened the refrigerator door and found the big mustard colored Tupperware pitcher, which in his youth always had sweet tea in it.Right now, choking on his frustration and the fine Texas dust, nothing sounded better.The phone tucked into his front pocket buzzed and he pulled it out to see the display.Beckett Jones, his agent.Hey, Beckett, he said, picking up the call.You watching ESPN?Beckett asked.No.Should I be?Fucking ESPN.Half the guys traded last year found out by watching ESPN.No, Beckett said quickly.A little too quickly.Its just rumors right now, and you know how ESPN loves rumors.Whats the rumor?Luc asked.Three Cavaliers for Ivan Lashenko, Beckett said.Lashenko?He collapsed back against the counter and wiped off the cold, clammy sweat that had suddenly formed on his forehead with the sleeve of his expensive jacket.Lashenko was the Russian phenom with the slap shot and the attitude.He was also the top gun right wing for the Dallas Mavericks, the only standout on a dismal team.The Mavericks hadnt even made the playoffs this year and without some serious changes, they wouldnt make it next year either.Lashenko was the only currency they had, and hed be a free agent in two years.He and Lashenko were both right wings known for their finesse, stick handling, and slap shots.While Luc led the league in assists, Lashenko was the high point scorer, and more important, fifteen years younger.Pray you dont get tradedthose were Matthewss words.And now, the Cavaliers were going to trade Luc.Without Billy.They were taking him away from the dream team hed helped create and the year he was meant to play.Hed finish his career on a third rate team, watching in some bar while his Cavaliers won the cup.It was like being plunged into ice cold blackness.He was lost.And hurt.Ive got calls in to Dunbar, Beckett said.Dunbar being the GM of the Cavaliers and keeper of all trade secrets.I should know for sure soon.But I dont think theyre going to trade you.Because every team needs two star right wings?When one is getting older, yeah, Beckett said, pulling no punches.You know, you havent told me what the doctor said after the Gilcot hit.He said dont get traded to Dallas!Luc answered.And then, because he could see the end of his career from the kitchen in his fathers house, he flipped the phone shut.But the volcano of his anger was exploding with nowhere to go.The headache that pulsed behind his eyes splintered and fractured, slicing through his whole body.Control it, he demanded, asking something superhuman of himself.But in the end he failed.Just as he always did in his fathers house.Boiling over, he turned, found the pitcher of tea, and hurled it against the wall.Fifteen minutes and two tea soaked towels later, Luc was fielding calls from half his teammates.I havent heard anything, he tried to assure Gates, who was taking these trade rumors as if it were news of his parents divorce.And rumors are just rumors.But youre in Texas Its family stuff, Gates.Honestly.I swear Im not going anywhere.He managed to get off the phone for a second before Billy called.Holy hell, man, Billy said by way of greeting.This is nutsthe team is acting like you died.Luc sighed and stepped out of the kitchen and down one of the hallways, hoping it led to his room.Just try to spread the news that Im not going anywhere.You know that for sure?Of course not, he snapped, but theres no point in everyone losing their minds right now.Gates was about to start crying.Ill cry if they bring Lashenko here.I swear, Luc, I might just kill that asshole.Oh for Gods sake, Billy.Control yourself.He realized he was heading down the hallway toward his fathers room and he almost turned around.Then he heard Jacobs muffled voice, and his protective instincts roared to life.Ill talk to you later, Billy.Just try to keep the guys from making any kind of statement to the vipers.Yes, Grandpa, Billy said, using the teams nickname for Luc.He hated that nickname and Billy knew it, so Luc hung up without saying goodbye.The closer he walked down the hallway toward Lyles room, the louder Jacobs voice got, and concern for his nephew momentarily outpaced his concern for his career.He pushed open Lyles bedroom door in time to see Lyle lift the oxygen mask off his face.What you got there?Like a hand coming out of a grave in some B movie, his trembling, bony fingers pointed at the Optimus Prime Jacob carried.Jacob lifted it and stepped closer.Hes an Autobot.He transforms between a robot and a truck.Show me, Lyle whispered and Jacob started to flip apart the robot, but it was hard without a place to put it.Here Lyle said, patting the side of the bed.Jacob took two more steps and put the toy on the bed.Too close!Too damn close!From the corner of Lucs eyes he caught movementVictoria lifting her hands to her mouth, her eyes dry and calculating.No doubt wondering how much this reunion might pay her.Disgust for his sister washed over him, quickly souring into anger.This was what shed come to.How far shed fallen.What the hell is going on in here?Luc barked, bursting in through the open door.Victoria jumped and so did Jacob, as if caught doing something wrong.But Lyle, his eyes glued to Luc, reached over and grabbed Jacobs arm.Jacob pulled away, but the old man was stronger than he looked.Get your hands off the boy, Luc said through clenched teeth.Lyle smiled, his white lips pulling away from gray teeth, revealing blood red gums.Jacob whimpered and twisted his arm free.He got away, running toward his mom.Go, Luc said to Victoria, who for a moment seemed about to resurrect some backbone.In the end though, she just led Jacob from the room.Hes my flesh and blood, Luc, Lyle said.Just like you.You can deny it all you want, but thats the Gods truth.Youre mine.Luc leaned forward, the cloying scent of illness and death filling his nose.You dont own me.You cant control me.Watch, his father gasped, me.Seconds later, Luc slammed the door shut on the small study his sister had hustled Jacob into.This is a joke, right?Luc blinked away the image of the old mans hand on his nephews arm.That macabre smile.The old man was up to something and Luc didnt want to know what.He didnt care.All he cared about was getting back to Toronto and repairing his career.Jacob wanted to meet him, Victoria said, standing in front of a window that was draped in yellow curtains.The sun filtered through, surrounding her in an eerie glow.She looked radioactive.I dont want to meet him anymore.Jacob held his robot in front of him like a shield.Luc looked pointedly at his sister, still unable to believe that shed taken her son to that mans bedside.Jacob, Victoria whispered, crouching down to look in his eyes.I think maybe you should go rest for a while Rest?he protested, and Luc fought his instincts to intervene.Or go see what Ruby has in the kitchen?You mean besides a mess of sweet tea?Hed cleaned up some, but it was still a sight.I saw some cookies in the drawer, he told Jacob.You guys cant just get rid of me whenever you want.Jacob, Victoria sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose.Please.Ten minutes.Jacob scowled at both of them and left the room.What the hell are you doing, Victoria?Luc demanded when the door was shut behind the boy.He wanted to meet his grandfather.She stuck to her lie, and Luc gaped at her.Bullshit.She jerked as if hed hit her, and his shoulders twitched with the need to do something.Push something.Hit something.His job on the ice was so clear.The expectations were simple.Puck in net.Manipulate the forces against him.Stay three steps ahead of everyone.Out herein the real worldthings were too damn messy.Dad is dying.I dont think hes about to go into one of his rages.He had his hand on him!he cried.Jacob was scared.Dont you remember what that was like?How you would cry I remember.And youre so desperate for money, you just stood there?Victoria smoothed her clothes, running her hands over the straight edges and buttons, her tell.Her perpetual effort to keep up the faade at the moment it was hardest.It was fine before you showed up, she said lamely.Youre introducing your son to our abusive asshole of a father to ensure your inheritance.Thats not you, Vicks.It was the ranch that was making her act this way.This place ripped away everyones decency, leaving behind the rocks and bones of selfishness and survival.Judge me all you want.But you have options.Youve always had options.I have none.Christ, how many times do I have to tell you Get a job?Like its that easy.I have no skills, Luc.I have nothing to offer anyone.I am exactly what Daddy always called metotally worthless.This is your chance to change that!You dont have to be useless your whole damn life.The air in the room went cold and she shrank even further into her skin, her bones.Away from him.I didnt mean that, he said quickly, as softly as possible, but she still flinched.Yes, you did, she whispered, her voice thick, and he hated that hed made his sister cry.His sister whod been so tough while her life and her pride were ripped away from her over this past year.The only thing I managed to do right was get Joel to marry me.Me.The bastard daughter of a bastard daughter.I caught his eye.I was the one he pursued.He could have married anyone he wanted and he chose me, the hostess at his goddamned golf club.And he made me a queen, Luc.I was untouchable.A force to be reckoned with.Me.She was killing him.Destroying him.The girl whod been ridiculed by her father, the very man who should have loved her, had found a way out of the dark, only to have the light ripped away.It broke his heart.And then everyone forgot where I came from.For the first time in my life, I actually got to be who I wanted to be, instead of who I was born to be.And nowits all gone.And I can go back to being a hostess and let everyone laugh and point, or I can go find myself another husband to take care of Jacob and me.Or, I can get as much as I can from my father, because he didnt give me shit growing up but bruises and nightmares.Luc knew this was the truth, that these were the options Victoria saw, but she was blind to all she could be.Tell me, Luc.Tell me what I should do.Lets just leave this place, he said, wanting to take her somewhere she could heal, because this place wasnt it.But she shook her head.Jesus Christ, Vicks, I cant stay here.He couldnt.Not when his life was falling apart a thousand miles away.And frankly, he was tired of being the only witness to his sisters self flagellation.Im not asking you to.In factit would be easier if you left.You want me to go?That was a first and it didnt sit well.Not at all.She nodded, and his hurt temper flared.Fine.He pulled out his cell phone.One more day.And then Im gone.Ill get a driver to take me to the airport so that I can leave you the car.She nodded, her lips pressed tightly together.It was a shit act.He could still see her fear and worry.But for her sake, and maybe because he was so damn tired of trying to protect a woman who wouldnt take the steps to protect herself, he pretended to buy it.Tara Jean hung up the last of the nearly complete samplesthe pink leather skirt with the fringe and the studs.The demon purred with pleasure.Tara looked at the rack of samples, finished but for the rough open seams down the back.They looked odd, so perfect in front but totally ragged in back, as if theyd been hurt, somehow.Victims of violent leather crimes.But theyd stay unfinished until the final fitting in two weeks.Honestly, Tara Jean.Edna looked sideways at her as she packed up her leather working kit.No one is going to buy a skirt that short.I dont know, Tara said, mostly just to egg Edna on.Its pretty hot.Hot, Edna scoffed, tucking away the leather awls and skives.Edna wasnt all that much older than Tara Jean, but with a name like Edna, the woman had been born old.Having twins didnt seem to help.Edna constantly had foul smelling crusty fluid on her shoulder from one of the babies leaking on her.And then there was the breast milk issue.She pumped.Like a cow.And wanted to talk about it.It was like spending ten hours a day with a biology experiment.And then there was the perm.Edna was the last woman under sixty sporting a chemical wave.Honestly, the eighties were over and no one had bothered to inform Edna.But perm and leaking breasts aside, the woman was a magician with a swivel knife.Edna and her husband ran a successful leather repair business outside of Fort Worth, and Tara Jean paid the woman a small fortune for her disapproval and incredibly delicate leather needlework.She made the seams look like cross stitch.Thanks for the hard work, Tara said.Shed pushed Edna and Joyce hard, choosing to hide out in the greenhouse rather than deal with the drama on the ranch.But there was no more hiding.Shed heard that Luc was leaving early tomorrow morning on the first flight out of Dallas.Victoria and the boy were staying, and Tara needed to see how Lyle was doing with those developments.Because from where she stood, his elaborate plan to reunite his family under one loving roof was going up in flames.You know it would be so much easier if youd have let me bring in the babies Tara shook her head, her stomach twisting into a knot.Hard to work with screaming babies.I told you, they dont scream.Theyre very sweet.A little playpen in the corner Anyway, Tara interrupted, ignoring Ednas disapproving gaze.She tore Ednas check out of the book and handed it over with a bright smile.Putting a whole lot of no more chitchat behind it.Thanks again.Edna took the check and smiled as she counted the extra zero.Until next time.Edna folded up the check and tucked it into the front pocket of her hideous mom jeans.See, Tara Jean thought, money can buy anythingeven Ednas approval.She cleaned up the last of the mess, sweeping up the leather scraps, putting away the mats and French knives.And when all was right in her kingdom, she locked up and headed into the ranch house to see what shed missed.In the kitchen, Ruby was putting together a dinner tray for Lyle.Applesauce and tomato soup?Tara winced.Dont forget the pudding.Ruby lifted a little snack cup.Who could?He keeps asking for a steak.Ruby folded a napkin and put it under the spoon she would use to feed him.Im tempted to give it to him, she whispered.Just to see him happy.A steak would probably kill him.Tara took the tray from Rubys hands.Ill give him dinner.You have a rest.Ruby smiled.I promised Jacob I would watch Iron Man with him.I think hes a little scared, and I love me some Robert Downey Jr.Tara put the tray down on the table so hard the dishes rattled.You do enough around here, Ruby.You dont need to babysit that kid on top of it!She shook her head.I cant believe the nerve of those two.Asking you Please, honey.Ruby put a hand on her ample hip.When have you ever known me to do something I dont want to do?Still Stop.Ruby patted Taras hand and Tara looked down at Rubys dark fingers, her blunt nails.She barely felt it.It was as if her skin was dead and had been for years.She heard fire victims were like that.They couldnt feel anything through the scar tissue.Her past had built up enough scar tissue to keep every sensation at bay.Except for Luc.She felt him.Which was disturbing.She was glad he was leaving.Her skin could go back to sleep and she could resume the numbness that helped her wade through life.I like the kid.Rubys soft tones hid an iron core, forged from years of working for Lyle.Hes very bright, and hes been ill for so long.Ill?she asked before she could stop herself.Very, Ruby whispered, channeling the dramatic Mexican soap operas she lived for.In the hospital and everything.Tara picked up the tray, reminding herself that she did not give a shit.At all.Either way, you dont have to babysit.What do you think I do all day?A wicked twinkle gleamed in her eye.Lyle is nothing but a big toddler.I wont argue with that.Tara headed up the back steps through the dark hallway toward the master bedroom.The door was cracked, and she knocked softly before pushing it open with her shoulder.Dinner is served.She tried to sound upbeat and not heartbroken by the sight of the big man laid so very low.How much longer, she thought, can he last?Even in the two days shed been hiding in the greenhouse, it looked as if hed lost weight.His skin hung like crepe paper after a Fourth of July party.Lyle turned toward her, the oxygen mask absent from his face.Youre looking better, she lied, sliding the tray onto his bed.Where have you been?he panted.Making the samples.Getting ready for the winter line.Good?Very.And to celebrate, weve got something special tonight.Porterhouse?Better.Pudding.Lyles gasping laughter brought sharp, hot tears to Taras eyes.She blinked them away as fast as she could and made a big show of stirring the applesauce.Lets start with an appetizer, shall we?The chef has prepared a surprise.She turned to Lyle only to find his eyes, clear and focused, right on her.Youre beautiful, he said, and she smiled.Flattery will not get you a steak.Tara.Trembling, his hand hovered over the covers, reaching for her.She put down the sauce and curled her hand over his.Please, she thought, please dont go.Not yet.Im not ready for you to be gone from this earth.Youre more beautifulthan you know.I dont know about that.She straightened the edge of his blankets with her free hand, looking everywhere but at Lyle.Im pretty aware of my charms.He squeezed her hand and she caught his crooked smile.Im so lucky you stumbled into my hospital room when you did.Im the lucky one, she whispered.You saved my life.Dennis The name stuck in her throat.Four years since shed said that name, but not a minute had gone by without her wondering when hed find her.Hes behind you.All of that is behind you.No wonder I cant stop looking over my shoulder.You saved the business.Those boots That makes us even?she asked, knowing it was so far from the truth it could only be a joke.More than even.You brought my kids here.My grandson You paid me, Lyle, she whispered, the shame of it, the necessity of it making her sick to her stomach.Doesnt matter.It worked.Theyre here.Joy changed him, lifted the pallor of death and made him luminous.Thats what children do, she thought, glad at least that they brought Lyle some pleasure, that they illuminated the dark places.Did you see my boy?Lyle asked, as if Luc were ten instead of three years shy of forty.Oh, I saw him.But she just nodded, not wanting to tinge Lyles fantasy with reality.He hates me, Lyle said.Apparently, reality didnt bother him.Proud and stubborn.And thats good?Hes he tapped his chest with a hand covered in liver spots, just like me.She shook her head, unable to agree.Maybe on the outside.But on the inside hes a different kind of animal.He doesnt have your heart.Any heart, really.Oh, dont be fooled.Hes always been a crybaby.Gets it from his mom.What about your daughter?He shrugged, and the face he made said so much about how little his daughter was worth in his eyes that Tara felt bad for the woman.She truly did.That kind of damage handed out by your daddy could cripple you for life.She brought my grandson, he said, as if she were a chauffeur rather than his only daughter.His heart monitor beeped, and Tara glanced at the readout before stroking his hand, trying to calm him down.He would never forgive Victoria for keeping his grandson from him.Tara didnt know much, but she knew that.What was the point of all this?she asked, hurting for the people hed hurt.Nothings changed.Luc still hates you.Victoria hates you so much she hid her son from you.Getting them back here was the point.For a moment he seemed drained; the light, the fire, all that was Lyle Baker dimmed and she clutched his hand, her eyes on the monitor.Im dying, Tara.Dont He rolled his eyes at her.And they may hate me, but theyre mine.My children.Flesh of my flesh.It was an ugly sentiment, proving what she knew too well to be truethat Lyle was far from perfect.This ranch, the Angus, Baker Leather, Victoria and Luc.They belong together.I dont think they agree with you.I was too hard on them when they were kids.Too clumsy.I know thatI see He stopped, his eyes bone dry, but wretched nonetheless.Luc is leaving tomorrow, she said, smoothing a hand down his cheek.You cant make him stay.Hell stay.Lyle For his sister hell stay.For his sister hell do anything.And shell stay for the money.She patted his chest.All this conniving cannot be good for you.You know what would be good for me?You cant have a cigar.Or a steak.Scotch.You cant have that either.He lifted her hand and pressed dry, feathery lips to her palm.Then lets live dangerously and start with the pudding.Luc sat up, the dark night swallowing every detail of the room.A headache pounded hard behind his eyes.Christ, where The pounding wasnt in his head.It was coming from the door.He was in Texas.His old bedroom.And it was the middle of the night.The digital clock on the bedside table said four in the morning.The knocking continued, growing sharper and harder.Im coming, he snapped, flipping the blankets off his body.He slipped into a pair of jeans, zipping them as he walked across the thick carpet.What?He yanked open the door.Tara Jean stood there.Diamond bright eyes set in a face ravaged by tears.Hes dead.What?He blinked.Your father is dead.6 When Pauly Sovtka, Lucs Junior A coach, died, Luc had cried.Hed cried during the service, while carrying Paulys coffin out of the church with the rest of his teammates; hed cried while they lowered the old man into the ground.Like a child lost at a mall, hed cried.And half his team cried right along with him.His grief had been so deep, so consuming, he couldnt pretend that his heart wasnt breaking.There was nothing he could do to stop the tears and he didnt care.Pauly was dead.And his world suffered for it.His dad had seen the footage on ESPN and hed made a special phone call just to tell Luc he was a crybaby.A disgrace to the Baker name, blubbering all over national TV like a girl.It had been a real special father and son kind of moment.Now, standing beside his fathers grave, his sisters warm hand tucked into his elbow, he couldnt care less.If he tried, and he wasnt about to expend the energy, he doubted he could muster up the slightest bit of grief.A scrap of regret or sadness.Maybe he shouldnt have started the day with that whiskey.He definitely shouldnt have had the second one.But Lyle Baker was only going to be buried once.A toast to the dawn seemed in order.But now he was numb to the hundred people who were here to pay their respects and was instead totally preoccupied with Bimbo Barbie.Or rather her very conspicuous absence.Wheres Tara Jean?he whispered into his sisters ear while a white haired minister kept calling Lyle a complicated man of strong belief.That must be minister talk for total asshole.Vicks shrugged, her pale face and thin body so perfectly suited to bereavement black, it hurt a little to look at her.To see all that his sister was, swallowed up.I havent seen her in three days, he said, not since she told me about Dad.She probably left, since he died before they could get married.Yeah, youre Beside him, his mother, Celeste, pinched him through the sleeve of his black jacket.He glanced over, only to receive her steely blue eyed censure.Victoria tensed and snapped her eyes forward, too quickly to absorb any of Celestes displeasure.And he stood between them, sweating in a thousand dollar suit in the late May Texas sun.I should have made that last drink a double.The minister droned on and Luc, without being too obvious, tried to find Bimbo Barbie in the crowd.Why he cared, he wasnt sure; maybe he just wanted to rub her face in all shed lost, or watch her try to scramble off her back, having had her world turned upside down.Or maybe he just wanted another look at that body as she walked away.The sun steadily rose in the east, changing from a milky egg yolk behind clouds to a blazing ball over the poplars that shaded the family plot.Cows dotted the hills to the south.The house, in all its mismatched glory, was just north.The sun caught the glass panes of the old greenhouse.They were surrounded by Lyles neighbors and business associates, all their eyes shrouded by sunglasses.He wondered how many of them would really miss Lyle.And how many of them were beaming behind those shades.Lord knows he was.But nowhere was Tara Jean Sweet.His pocket vibrated, and he dropped his sisters hand to fish his phone out.It was a text, but before he could see who it was from, Celeste snatched it out of his hand and dropped it in her gray bag, without once looking at him.It was probably Beckett.And undoubtedly important.His mother tucked her hand into his, squeezing his fingers.Hes your father, she whispered.Be better than he was.Good Christ, he couldnt fight that.He took a deep breath and replayed, minute by minute, last seasons playoff win over the Quebecois.An hour later the farce was over and Luc led Victoria, Jacob, and his mother into their wing of bedrooms.He beelined to the liquor cabinet in Celestes suite and poured himself whiskey.A lot of it.Its a little early, isnt it?Celeste asked, unclipping her hammered silver earrings and sitting down on the bed.And inappropriate, Luc agreed and drank half the glass.I raised you better than that.You did.He pulled another tumbler from the cabinet.Would you like one?A double.Can I have my phone back?he asked, handing her the glass.His mother lifted her eyebrows.Please, he sighed, and she slipped the phone into his palm.He turned away while Victoria busied herself with Jacob, undoing the suit jacket the boy had complained about all morning.His mother watched Victoria and Jacob, her eyes hungry.It was no secret she wanted some grandkids to spoil.It was too bad he was the only child Celeste had.Because grandkids werent springing from his loins anytime soon.He shrugged out of his own coat and threw it over Celestes bed.The text was from Beckett: They are interested in Lashenko.No other word, yet.He finished his drink in one long swallow.Is there something wrong with your head?Celeste asked, her soft voice made fluid by her French accent.He realized he was rubbing that spot on his forehead, where it felt like a cattle prod was impaled above his left eye.His mothers hand curved over his shoulder, and her touch was like a web over the worst of his instincts and emotions, giving him fragile control over the seething, terrible mess that bubbled just under the surface of his skin.He could tell her, she was his mother after all, and shed made worse things better by sheer force of will, a perfectly raised eyebrow, and a kiss.But what could she do?Fix his head?Turn back time?If only.Telling her would only cause her grief.
