At last shes quiet.I think she might have fallen asleep, but I cannot bring myself to check, in case I disturb her.At least shes calmer now.Dawn comes and goes, and the ambient light gets brighter, intruding into the room as morning moves on.And still we lie quietly.My mind drifts as I hold my girl in my arms, and I observe the changing quality of the light.I cant remember an instance when I just lay down and let time creep by and my thoughts wander.Its relaxing, imagining what we could do for the rest of the day.Maybe I should take her to see The Grace.Yes.We could go sailing this afternoon.If shes still talking to you, Grey.She moves, a slight twitch in her foot, and I know shes awake.I brought you some Advil and some arnica cream.Finally she responds, slowly turning in my arms to face me.Pain riven eyes focus on mine, her look intense, questioning.She takes her time to scrutinize me, as if seeing me for the first time.Its unnerving because, as usual, I have no idea what shes thinking, what shes seeing.But shes definitely calmer, and I welcome the small spark of relief this brings.Today might be a good day after all.She caresses my cheek and runs her fingers along my jaw, tickling my stubble.I close my eyes, savoring her touch.Its still so new, this sensation, being touched and enjoying her innocent fingers gently stroking my face, the darkness quiet.I dont mind her touching my faceor her fingers in my hair.Im sorry, she says.Her soft spoken words are a surprise.Shes apologizing to me?What for?What I said.Relief courses unchecked through my body.Shes forgiven me.Besides, what she said in anger was rightI am a fucked up son of a bitch.You didnt tell me anything I didnt know.And for the first time in so many years I find myself apologizing.Im sorry I hurt you.Her shoulders lift a little and she gives me a slight smile.Ive won a reprieve.Were safe.Were okay.Im relieved.I asked for it, she says.You sure did, baby.She swallows nervously.I dont think I can be everything you want me to be, she concedes, her eyes wide with heartfelt sincerity.The world stops.Fuck.Were not safe at all.Grey, make this right.You are everything I want you to be.She frowns.Her eyes are red rimmed and shes so pale, the palest Ive ever seen her.Its oddly stirring.I dont understand, she says.Im not obedient, and you can be as sure as hell Im not going to let you do that to me again.And thats what you needyou said so.And there it isher coup de grace.I pushed too far.Now she knowsand all the arguments I had with myself before I embarked on the pursuit of this girl flood back to me.Shes not into the lifestyle.How can I corrupt her this way?Shes too young, too innocenttooAna.My dreams are just thatdreams.This isnt going to work.I close my eyes; I cant bear to look at her.Its true, she would be better off without me.Now that shes seen the monster, she knows she cant contend with him.I have to free herlet her go her own way.This wont work between us.Focus, Grey.Youre right.I should let you go.Im no good for you.Her eyes widen.I dont want to go, she whispers.Tears pool in her eyes, glistening on long dark lashes.I dont want you to go, either, I answer, because its the truth, and that feelingthat ominous, frightening feelingis back, overwhelming me.The tears trickle down her cheeks once more.Gently I wipe away a falling tear with my thumb, and before I know it the words tumble out.Ive come alive since I met you.I trace my thumb along her bottom lip.I want to kiss her, hard.Make her forget.Dazzle her.Arouse herI know I can.But something holds me backher wary, injured look.Why would she want to be kissed by a monster?She might push me away, and I dont know if I could deal with any more rejection.Her words haunt me, pulling at some dark and repressed memory.You are one fucked up son of a bitch.Me, too, she whispers.Ive fallen in love with you, Christian.I remember Carrick teaching me to dive.My toes gripping the pool edge as I fell arching into the waterand now Im falling once more, into the abyss, in slow motion.Theres no way she can feel that about me.Not me.No!And Im choking for air, strangled by her words pressing their momentous weight on my chest.I plunge down and down, the darkness welcoming me.I cant hear them.I cant deal with them.She doesnt know what shes saying, who shes dealing withwhat shes dealing with.No.My voice is raw with pained disbelief.You cant love me, Ana.No.Thats wrong.I need to set her right on this.She cannot love a monster.She cannot love a fucked up son of a bitch.She needs to go.She needs outand in an instant, everything becomes crystal clear.This is my eureka moment; I cant make her happy.I cant be what she needs.I cant let this go on.This has to finish.It should never have started.Wrong?Whys it wrong?Well, look at you.I cant make you happy.The anguish is plain in my voice as I sink deeper and deeper into the abyss, shrouded in despair.No one can love me.But you do make me happy, she says, not comprehending.Anastasia Steele, look at yourself.I have to be honest with her.Not at the moment.Not doing what I want to do.She blinks, her lashes fluttering over her large, wounded eyes, studying me intently as she searches for the truth.Well never get past that, will we?I shake my head, because I cant think of anything to say.It comes down to incompatibility, again.She closes her eyes, as if in pain, and when she opens them again, they are clearer, full of resolve.Her tears have stopped.And the blood starts pounding through my head as my heart hammers.I know what shes going to say.I dread what shes going to say.Well, Id better go, then.She winces as she sits up.Now?She cant go now.No, dont go.Im free falling, deeper and deeper.Her leaving feels like a monumental mistake.My mistake.But she cant stay if she feels this way about me, she just cant.Theres no point in me staying, she says, and gingerly climbs out of the bed still wrapped in her bathrobe.Shes really leaving.I cant believe it.I scramble out of bed to stop her, but her look pins me to the floorher expression so bleak, so cold, so distantnot my Ana at all.Im going to get dressed.Id like some privacy, she says.How flat and empty her voice sounds as she turns and leaves, closing the door behind her.I stare at the closed door.This is the second time in one day that shes walked out on me.I sit up and cradle my head in my hands, trying to calm down, trying to rationalize my feelings.She loves me?How did this happen?How?Grey, you fucking fool.Wasnt this always a risk, with someone like her?Someone good and innocent and courageous.A risk that shed not see the real me until it was too late.That I would make her suffer like this?Why is this so painful?I feel like Ive punctured a lung.I follow her out of the room.She might want privacy, but if shes leaving me I need clothes.When I reach my bedroom, shes showering, so I quickly change into jeans and a T shirt, Ive chosen blacksuitable for my mood.Grabbing my phone, I wander through the apartment, tempted to sit at the piano and hammer out some woeful lament.But instead I stand in the middle of the room, feeling nothing.Vacant.Focus, Grey!This is the right decision.Let her go.My phone buzzes.Its Welch.Has he found Leila?Welch.Mr.Grey, I have news.His voice grates over the phone.This guy should stop smoking.He sounds like Deep Throat.You found her?My spirits lift a little.No, sir.What is it, then?Why the hell have you called?Leila left her husband.He finally admitted it to me.Hes washed his hands of her.This is news.I see.He has an idea where she might be, but he wants his palm greased.Wants to know whos so interested in his wife.Though thats not what he called her.I fight my surging anger.How much does he want?He said two thousand.He said what?I shout, losing it.Why didnt he just admit earlier that Leila had walked out on him?Well, he could have told us the fucking truth.Whats his number?I need to call him.Welch, this is a real fuckup.I glance up, and Ana is standing awkwardly at the entrance to the living room, dressed in jeans and an ugly sweatshirt.Shes all big eyes and tight, pinched face, her suitcase beside her.Find her, I snap, hanging up.Ill deal with Welch later.Ana walks over to the sofa, and from her backpack removes the Mac, her phone, and the key to her car.Taking a deep breath, she marches to the kitchen and lays all three items on the counter.What the hell?Shes returning her things?She turns to face me, determination clear on her small ashen face.Its her stubborn look, the one I know so well.I need the money that Taylor got for my Beetle.Her voice is calm but monotone.Ana, I dont want those thingstheyre yours.She cant do this to me.Please, take them.No, Christian.I only accepted them under sufferance, and I dont want them anymore.Ana, be reasonable!I dont want anything that will remind me of you.I just need the money that Taylor got for my car.Her voice is devoid of emotion.She wants to forget me.Are you really trying to wound me?No, Im not.Im trying to protect myself.Of courseshes trying to protect herself from the monster.Please Ana, take that stuff.Her lips are so pale.Christian, I dont want to fightI just need that money.Money.It always comes down to the fucking money.Will you take a check?I snarl.Yes.I think youre good for it.She wants money, Ill give her money.I storm into my study, barely holding on to my temper.Sitting at my desk I call Taylor.Good morning, Mr.Grey.I ignore his greeting.How much did you get for Anas VW?Twelve thousand dollars, sir.That much?In spite of my bleak mood, Im surprised.Its a classic, he says by way of explanation.Thanks.Can you take Miss Steele home now?Of course.Ill be right down.I hang up and take out my checkbook from my desk drawer.As I do, I remember my conversation with Welch about Leilas fucking asshole of a husband.Its always about fucking money!In my anger I double the amount that Taylor got for the death trap and stuff the check into an envelope.When I return shes still standing by the kitchen island, lost, almost childlike.I hand her the envelope, my anger evaporating at the sight of her.Taylor got a good priceits a classic car, I mumble in apology.You can ask him.Hell take you home.I nod to where Taylor is waiting at the entrance of the living room.Thats fine, I can get myself home, thank you.No!Accept the ride, Ana.Why does she do this?Are you going to defy me at every turn?Why change a habit of a lifetime?She gives me a blank look.Thats it in a nutshellwhy our arrangement was doomed from the start.Shes just not cut out for this, and deep down, I always knew it.I close my eyes.I am such a fool.I try a softer approach, pleading with her.Please, Ana.Let Taylor take you home.Ill get the car, Miss Steele, Taylor announces with quiet authority and leaves.Maybe shell listen to him.She glances around, but hes already gone down to the basement to fetch the car.She turns back to me, her eyes wider all of a sudden.And I hold my breath.I really cant believe shes going.This is the last time Ill see her, and she looks so sad.It cuts deep that Im the one responsible for that look.I take a hesitant step forward; I want to hold her one more time and beg her to stay.She steps back, and its a move that signals all too clearly that she doesnt want me.Ive driven her away.I freeze.I dont want you to go.I cant stay.I know what I want, and you cant give it to me, and I cant give you what you need.Oh, please, Analet me hold you one more time.Smell your sweet, sweet scent.Feel you in my arms.I step toward her again, but she holds up her hands, halting me.Dontplease.She recoils, panic etched on her face.I cant do this.And she grabs her suitcase and backpack and heads for the foyer.I follow, meek and helpless in her wake, my eyes fixed on her small frame.In the foyer I call the elevator.I cant take my eyes off herher delicate, elfin face, those lips, the way her dark lashes fan out and cast a shadow over her pale, pale cheeks.Words fail me as I try to memorize every detail.I have no dazzling lines, no quick wit, no arrogant commands.I have nothingnothing but a yawning void inside my chest.The elevator doors open and Ana heads straight in.She looks around at meand for a moment her mask slips, and there it is: my pain reflected on her beautiful face.No.Ana.Dont go.Good bye, Christian.Anagood bye.The doors close, and shes gone.I sink slowly to the floor and put my head in my hands.The void is now cavernous and aching, overwhelming me.Grey, what the hell have you done?WHEN I LOOK UP again, the paintings in my foyer, my Madonnas, bring a mirthless smile to my lips.The idealization of motherhood.All of them gazing at their infants, or staring inauspiciously down at me.Theyre right to look at me that way.Shes gone.Shes really gone.The best thing that ever happened to me.After she said shed never leave.She promised me shed never leave.I close my eyes, shutting out those lifeless, pitying stares, and tip my head back against the wall.Okay, she said it in her sleepand like the fool I am, I believed her.Ive always known deep down I was no good for her, and she was too good for me.This is how it should be.Then why do I feel like shit?Why is this so painful?The chime announcing the arrival of the elevator forces my eyes open again, and my heart leaps into my mouth.Shes back.I sit paralyzed, waiting, and the doors pull backand Taylor steps out and momentarily freezes.Hell.How long have I been sitting here?Miss Steele is home, Mr.Grey, he says, as if he addresses me while Im prostrate on the floor every day.How was she?I ask, as dispassionately as I can, though I really want to know.Upset, sir, he says, showing no emotion whatsoever.I nod, dismissing him.But he doesnt leave.Can I get you anything, sir?he asks, much too kindly for my liking.No.Go.Leave me alone.Sir, he says, and he exits, leaving me slouched on the foyer floor.Much as Id like to sit here all day and wallow in my despair, I cant.I want an update from Welch, and I need to call Leilas poor excuse for a husband.And I need a shower.Perhaps this agony will wash away in the shower.As I stand I touch the wooden table that dominates the foyer, my fingers absentmindedly tracing its delicate marquetry.Id have liked to fuck Miss Steele over this.I close my eyes, imagining her sprawled across this table, her head held back, chin up, mouth open in ecstasy, and her luscious hair pooling over the edge.Shit, it makes me hard just thinking about it.Fuck.The pain in my gut twists and tightens.Shes gone, Grey.Get used to it.And drawing on years of enforced control, I bring my body to heel.THE SHOWER IS BLISTERING, the temperature just a notch below painful, the way I like it.I stand beneath the cascade, trying to forget her, hoping this heat will scorch her out of my head and wash her scent off my body.If shes going to leave, theres no coming back.Never.I scrub my hair with grim determination.Good riddance.And I suck in a breath.No.Not good riddance.I raise my face to the streaming water.Its not good riddance at allI am going to miss her.I lean my forehead against the tiles.Just last night she was in here with me.I stare at my hands, my fingers caressing the line of grout in the tiles where only yesterday her hands were braced against the wall.Fuck this.Switching off the water, I step out of the shower cubicle.As I wrap a towel around my waist, it sinks in: each day will be darker and emptier, because shes no longer in it.No more facetious, witty e mails.No more of her smart mouth.No more curiosity.Her bright blue eyes will no longer regard me in thinly veiled amusementor shockor lust.I stare at the brooding morose jerk staring back at me in the bathroom mirror.What the hell have you done, asshole?I sneer at him.He mouths the words back at me with vitriolic contempt.And the bastard blinks at me, big gray eyes raw with misery.Shes better off without you.You cant be what she wants.You cant give her what she needs.She wants hearts and flowers.She deserves better than you, you fucked up prick.Repulsed by the image glowering back at me, I turn away from the mirror.To hell with shaving for today.I dry off at my chest of drawers and grab some underwear and a clean T shirt.As I turn I notice a small box on my pillow.The rug is pulled from under me again, revealing once more the abyss beneath, its jaws open, waiting for me, and my anger turns to fear.Its something from her.What would she give me?I drop my clothes and, taking a deep breath, sit on the bed and pick up the box.Its a glider.A model making kit for a Blank L23.A scribbled note falls from the top of the box and wafts onto the bed.This reminded me of a happy time.Thank you.Ana  Its the perfect present from the perfect girl.Pain lances through me.Why is this so painful?Why?Some long lost, ugly memory stirs, trying to sink its teeth into the here and now.No.That is not a place I want my mind to return to.I get up, tossing the box onto the bed, and dress hurriedly.When Im finished I grab the box and the note and head for my study.I will handle this better from my seat of power.MY CONVERSATION WITH WELCH is brief.My conversation with Russell Reedthe miserable lying bastard who married Leilais briefer.I didnt know that theyd wed during one drunken weekend in Vegas.No wonder their marriage failed after just eighteen months.She left him twelve weeks ago.So where are you now, Leila Williams?What have you been doing?I focus my mind on Leila, trying to think of some clue from our past that might tell me where she is.I need to know.I need to know shes safe.And why she came here.Why me?She wanted more, and I didnt, but that was long ago.It was easy when she leftour arrangement was terminated by mutual consent.In fact, our whole arrangement had been exemplary: just how it should be.She was mischievous when she was with me, deliberately so, and not the broken creature that Gail described.I recall how much she enjoyed our sessions in the playroom.Leila loved the kink.A memory surfacesIm tying her big toes together, turning her feet in so she cant clench her backside and avoid the pain.Yeah, she loved all that shit, and so did I.  She was a great submissive.But she never captured my attention like Anastasia Steele.She never drove me to distraction like Ana.I gaze at the glider kit on my desk and trace the edges of the box with my finger, knowing that Anas fingers have touched it.My sweet Anastasia.What a contrast you are to all the women Ive known.The only woman Ive ever chased, and the one woman who cant give me what I want.I dont understand.Ive come alive since Ive known her.These last few weeks have been the most exciting, the most unpredictable, the most fascinating in my life.Ive been enticed from my monochrome world into one rich with colorand yet she cant be what I need.I put my head in my hands.She will never like what I do.I tried to convince myself that we could work up to the rougher shit, but thats not going to happen, ever.Shes better off without me.What would she want with a fucked up monster who cant bear to be touched?And yet she bought me this thoughtful gift.Who does that for me, apart from my family?I study the box once more and open it.All the plastic parts of the craft are stuck on one grid, swathed in cellophane.Memories of her squealing in the glider during the wingover come to mindher hands up, braced against the Perspex canopy.I cant help but smile.Lord, that was so much funthe equivalent of pulling her pigtails in the playground.Ana in pigtailsI shut down that thought immediately.I dont want to go there, our first bath.And all Im left with is the thought that I wont see her again.The abyss yawns open.No.Not again.I need to make this plane.It will be a distraction.Ripping open the cellophane, I scan the instructions.I need glue, modeling glue.I search through my desk drawers.Shit.Nestled at the back of one drawer I find the red leather box containing the Cartier earrings.I never got the chance to give them to herand now I never will.I call Andrea and leave a message on her cell, asking her to cancel tonight.I cant face the gala, not without my date.I open the red leather box and examine the earrings.They are beautiful: simple yet elegant, just like the enchanting Miss Steelewho left me this morning because I punished herbecause I pushed her too hard.I cradle my head once again.But she let me.She didnt stop me.She let me because she loves me.The thought is horrifying, and I dismiss it immediately.She cant.Its simple: no one can feel like that about me.Not if they know me.Move on, Grey.Focus.Wheres the damned glue?I stash the earrings back in the drawer and continue my search.Nothing.I buzz Taylor.Mr.Grey?I need some modeling glue.He pauses for a moment.For what sort of model, sir?A model glider.Balsa wood or plastic?Plastic.I have some.Ill bring it down now, sir.I thank him, a little stunned that he has modeling glue.Moments later he knocks on the door.Come in.He paces into my study and places the small plastic container on my desk.He doesnt leave and I have to ask.Why do you have this?I build the odd plane.His face reddens.Oh?My curiosity is piqued.Flying was my first love, sir.I dont understand.Color blind, he explains flatly.So you became a Marine?Yes, sir.Thank you for this.No problem, Mr.Grey.Have you eaten?His question takes me by surprise.Im not hungry, Taylor.Please, go, enjoy the afternoon with your daughter, and Ill see you tomorrow.I wont bother you again.He pauses for a moment, and my irritation builds.Go.Im good.Hell, my voice is choked.Sir.He nods.Ill return tomorrow evening.I give him a quick dismissive nod, and hes gone.When was the last time Taylor offered me anything to eat?I must look more fucked up than I thought.Sulking, I grab the glue.THE GLIDER IS IN the palm of my hand.I marvel at it with a sense of achievement, memories of that flight nudging my consciousness.Anastasia was impossible to wakeI smile as I recalland once up she was difficult, disarming and beautiful, and funny.Christ, that was fun: her girlish excitement during the flight, the squealing, and afterward, our kiss.It was my first attempt at more.Its extraordinary that over such a short time I have collected so many happy memories.The pain surfaces once morenagging, aching, reminding me of all that Ive lost.Focus on the glider, Grey.Now I have to stick the transfers in place; theyre fiddly little suckers.FINALLY THE LAST ONE is on and drying.My glider has its own FAA registration.November.Nine.Five.Two.Echo.Charlie.Echo Charlie.I look up and the light is fading.Its late.My first thought is that I can show this to Ana.No more Ana.I clench my teeth and stretch my stiff shoulders.Standing slowly, I realize I havent eaten all day or had anything to drink, and my head is throbbing.I feel like shit.I check my phone in the hope that shes called, but theres only a text from Andrea.CC Gala canx.Hope all well.A  While Im reading Andreas message the phone buzzes.My heart rate immediately spikes, then falls when I recognize its Elena.Hello.I dont bother to disguise my disappointment.Christian, is that any way to say hi?Whats eating you?she scolds, but her voice is full of humor.I stare out the window.Its dusk over Seattle.I wonder briefly what Ana is doing.I dont want to tell Elena whats happened; I dont want to say the words out loud and make them a reality.Christian?What gives?Tell me.Her tone shifts to brusque and annoyed.She left me, I mutter, sounding morose.Oh.Elena sounds surprised.Want me to come over?No.She takes a deep breath.This life isnt for everyone.I know.Hell, Christian, you sound like shit.Do you want to go out to dinner?No.Im coming over.No, Elena.Im not good company.Im tired and I want to be alone.Ill call you during the week.Christianits for the best.I know.Good bye.I hang up.I dont want to talk to her; she encouraged me to fly down to Savannah.Perhaps she knew this day would come.I scowl at the phone, toss it onto my desk, and go in search of something to drink and eat.I EXAMINE THE CONTENTS of my fridge.Nothing appeals.In the cupboard I find a bag of pretzels.I open them and eat one after the other as I walk to the window.Outside, night has fallen; lights twinkle and wink through the pouring rain.The world moves on.Move on, Grey.Move on.SUNDAY, JUNE 5, 2011    * * *      I gaze up at the bedroom ceiling.Sleep eludes me.Im tormented by Anas fragrance, which still clings to my bedsheets.I pull her pillow over my face to breathe in her scent.Its torture, its heaven, and for a moment I contemplate death by suffocation.Get a grip, Grey.I rerun the mornings events in my head.Could they have unfolded any differently?As a rule I never do this, because its a waste of energy, but today Im looking for clues as to where I went wrong.And no matter how I play it out, I know in my bones we would have reached this impasse, whether it was this morning, or in a week, or a month, or a year.Better that it happened now, before I inflicted any further pain on Anastasia.I think of her huddled in her little white bed.I cant picture her in the new apartmentIve not been therebut I imagine her in that room in Vancouver where I once slept with her.I shake my head; that was the best nights sleep Id had in years.The radio alarm reads 2:00 in the morning.I have lain here for two hours, my mind churning.I take a deep breath, inhaling her scent once more, and I close my eyes.Mommy cant see me.I stand in front of her.She cant see me.Shes asleep with her eyes open.Or sick.I hear a rattle.His keys.Hes back.I run and hide and make myself small under the table in the kitchen.My cars are here with me.Bang.The door slams shut, making me jump.Through my fingers I see Mommy.She turns her head to see him.Then shes asleep on the couch.Hes wearing his big boots with the shiny buckles and standing over Mommy shouting.He hits Mommy with a belt.Get Up!Get Up!You are one fucked up bitch.You are one fucked up bitch.Mommy makes a noise.A wailing noise.Stop.Stop hitting Mommy.Stop hitting Mommy.I run at him and hit him and I hit him and I hit him.But he laughs and smacks me across the face.No!Mommy shouts.You are one fucked up bitch.Mommy makes herself small.Small like me.And then shes quiet.You are one fucked up bitch.You are one fucked up bitch.You are one fucked up bitch.I am under the table.I have my fingers in my ears and I close my eyes.The sound stops.He turns and I can see his boots as he stomps into the kitchen.He carries the belt, slapping it against his leg.He is trying to find me.He stoops down and grins.He smells nasty.Of smoking and drinking and bad smells.There you are, you little shit.A chilling wail wakes me.Im drenched in sweat and my heart is pounding.I sit bolt upright in bed.Fuck.The eerie noise was from me.I take a deep steadying breath, trying to rid my memory of the smell of body odor and cheap bourbon and stale Camel cigarettes.You are one fucked up son of a bitch.Anas words ring in my head.Like his.Fuck.I couldnt help the crack whore.I tried.Good God, I tried.There you are, you little shit.But I could help Ana.I let her go.I had to let her go.She didnt need all this shit.I glance at the clock: its 3:30.I head into the kitchen and after drinking a large glass of water I make my way to the piano.I WAKE AGAIN WITH a jolt and its lightearly morning sunshine fills the room.I was dreaming of Ana: Ana kissing me, her tongue in my mouth, my fingers in her hair; pressing her delectable body against me, her hands tethered above her head.Where is she?For one sweet moment I forget all that transpired yesterdaythen it floods back.Shes gone.Fuck.The evidence of my desire presses into the mattressbut the memory of her bright eyes, clouded with hurt and humiliation as she left, soon solves that problem.Feeling like shit, I lie on my back and stare at the ceiling, arms behind my head.The day stretches out before me, and for the first time in years, I dont know what to do with myself.I check the time again: 5:58.Hell, I might as well go for a run.PROKOFIEVS ARRIVAL OF THE Montagues and Capulets blares in my ears as I pound the sidewalk through the early morning quiet of Fourth Avenue.I ache everywheremy lungs are bursting, my head is throbbing, and the yawning, dull ache of loss eats away at my insides.I cannot run from this pain, though Im trying.I stop to change the music and drag precious air into my lungs.I want somethingviolent.Pump It, by the Black Eyed Peas, yeah.I pick up the pace.I find myself running down Vine Street, and I know its insane, but I hope to see her.As I near her street my heart races still harder and my anxiety escalates.Im not desperate to see herI just want to check that shes okay.No, thats not true.I want to see her.Finally on her street, I pace past her apartment building.All is quietan Oldsmobile trundles up the road, two dog walkers are outbut theres no sign of life from inside her apartment.Crossing the street, I pause on the sidewalk opposite, then duck into the doorway of an apartment building to catch my breath.The curtains of one room are closed, the others open.Perhaps thats her room.Maybe shes still asleepif shes there at all.A nightmare scenario forms in my mind: she went out last night, got drunk, met someone  No.Bile rises in my throat.The thought of her body in someone elses hands, some asshole basking in the warmth of her smile, making her giggle, making her laughmaking her come.It takes all my self control not to go barging through the front door of her apartment to check that shes there and on her own.You brought this on yourself, Grey.Forget her.Shes not for you.I tug my Seahawks cap low over my face and sprint on down Western Avenue.My jealousy is raw and angry; it fills the gaping hole.I hate itit stirs something deep in my psyche that I really dont want to examine.I run harder, away from that memory, away from the pain, away from Anastasia Steele.ITS DUSK OVER SEATTLE.I stand up and stretch.Ive been at my desk in my study all day, and its been productive.Ros has worked hard, too.Shes prepared and sent me a first draft business plan and letter of intent for SIP.At least Ill be able to keep an eye on Ana.The thought is painful and appealing in equal measure.Ive read and commented on two patent applications, a few contracts, and a new design spec, and while lost in the detail of those, I have not thought about her.The little glider is still on my desk, taunting me, reminding me of happier times, like she said.I picture her standing in the doorway of my study, wearing one of my T shirts, all long legs and blue eyes, just before she seduced me.Another first.I miss her.ThereI admit it.I check my phone, hoping in vain, and theres a text from Elliot.Beer, hotshot?I respond:  No.Busy.Elliots response is immediate.Fuck you, then.Yeah.Fuck me.Nothing from Ana: no missed call.No e mail.The nagging pain in my gut intensifies.Shes not going to call.She wanted out.She wanted to get away from me, and I cant blame her.Its for the best.I head to the kitchen for a change of scenery.Gail is back.The kitchen has been cleaned, and theres a pot bubbling on the stove.Smells goodbut Im not hungry.She walks in while Im eyeing whats cooking.Good evening, sir.Gail.She pausessurprised by something.Surprised by me?Shit, I must look bad.Chicken Chasseur?she asks, her voice uncertain.Sure, I mutter.For two?she asks.I stare at her, and she looks embarrassed.For one.Ten minutes?she says, her voice wavering.Fine.My voice is frigid.I turn to leave.Mr.Grey?She stops me.What, Gail?Its nothing.Sorry to disturb you.She turns to the stove to stir the chicken, and I head off to have another shower.Christ, even my staff have noticed that somethings rotten in the state of fucking Denmark.MONDAY, JUNE 6, 2011    * * *      I dread going to bed.Its after midnight, and Im tired, but I sit at my piano, playing the Bach Marcello piece over and over again.Remembering her head resting on my shoulder, I can almost smell her sweet fragrance.For fucks sake, she said shed try!I stop playing and clutch my head in both hands, my elbows hammering out two discordant chords as I lean on the keys.She said shed try, but she fell at the first hurdle.Then she ran.Why did I hit her so hard?Deep inside I know the answerbecause she asked me to, and I was too impetuous and selfish to resist the temptation.Seduced by her challenge, I seized the opportunity to move us on to where I wanted us to be.And she didnt safe word, and I hurt her more than she could takewhen I promised her Id never do that.What a fucking fool I am.How could she trust me after that?Its right that shes gone.Why the hell would she want to be with me, anyway?I contemplate getting drunk.I have not been drunk since I was fifteenwell, once, when I was twenty one.I loathe the loss of control: I know what alcohol can do to a man.I shudder and snap my mind shut to those memories, and decide to call it a night.Lying in my bed, I pray for a dreamless sleepbut if I am to dream, I want to dream of her.Mommy is pretty today.She sits down and lets me brush her hair.She looks at me in the mirror and she smiles her special smile.Her special smile for me.There is a loud noise.A crash.Hes back.No!Where the fuck are you, bitch?Got a friend in need here.A friend with dough.Mommy stands and takes my hand and pushes me into her closet.I sit on her shoes and try to be quiet and cover my ears and close my eyes tight.The clothes smell of Mommy.I like the smell.I like being here.Away from him.He is shouting.Where is the little fucking runt?He has my hair and he pulls me out of the closet.Dont want you spoiling the party, you little shit.He slaps Mommy hard on her face.Make it good for my friend and you get your fix, bitch.Mommy looks at me and she has tears.Dont cry, Mommy.Another man comes into the room.A big man with dirty hair.The big man smiles at Mommy.I am pulled into the other room.He pushes me onto the floor and I hurt my knees.Now, what am I going to do with you, you piece of shit?He smells nasty.He smells of beer and he is smoking a cigarette.I wake.My heart is hammering like Ive run forty blocks chased by the hounds of hell.I vault out of bed, pushing the nightmare back into the recesses of my consciousness, and hurry to the kitchen to fetch a glass of water.I need to see Flynn.The nightmares are worse than ever.I didnt have nightmares when I slept with Ana beside me.Hell.It never occurred to me to sleep with any of my subs.Well, I never felt the inclination.Was I worried that they might touch me in the night?I dont know.It took an inebriated innocent to show me how restful it could be.Id watched my subs sleep before, but it was always as a prelude to waking them for some sexual relief.I remember gazing at Ana for hours when she slept at The Heathman.The longer I watched her the more beautiful she became: her flawless skin luminous in the soft light, her dark hair fanning out on the white pillow, and her eyelashes fluttering while she slept.Her lips were parted, and I could see her teeth, and her tongue when she licked her lips.It was a most arousing experiencejust watching her.And when I finally went to sleep beside her, listening to her even breathing, watching her breasts rise and fall with each breath, I slept wellso well.I wander into my study and pick up the glider.The sight of it elicits a fond smile and comforts me.I feel both proud to have made it and ridiculous for what I am about to do.It was her last gift to me.Her first gift beingwhat?Of course.Herself.She sacrificed herself to my need.My greed.My lust.My egomy fucking damaged ego.Damn, will this pain ever just stop?Feeling a little foolish, I take the glider with me to bed.WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE for breakfast, sir?Just coffee, Gail.She hesitates.Sir, you didnt eat your dinner.And?Maybe youre coming down with something.Gail, just coffee.Please.I shut her downthis is none of her business.Her lips thin, but she nods and turns to the Gaggia.I head in to the study to collect my papers for the office and look for a padded envelope.I CALL ROS FROM the car.Great work on the SIP material, but the business plan needs some revision.Lets offer.Christian, this is fast.I want to move quickly.Ive e mailed you my thoughts on the offering price.Ill be in the office from seven thirty.Lets meet.If youre sure.Im sure.Okay.Ill call Andrea to schedule.I have the stats on Detroit v.  Savannah.Bottom line?Detroit.I see.Shitnot Savannah.Lets talk later.I hang up.I sit, brooding in the back of the Audi, as Taylor speeds through the traffic.I wonder how Anastasia will be getting to work this morning.Perhaps she bought a car yesterday, though somehow I doubt it.I wonder if she feels as miserable as I doI hope not.Maybe shes realized that I was a ridiculous infatuation.She cant love me.And certainly not nownot after all Ive done to her.No ones ever said they loved me, except Mom and Dad, of course, but even then it was out of their sense of duty.Flynns nagging words about unconditional parental loveeven for kids who are adoptedring in my head.But Ive never been convinced; Ive been nothing but a disappointment to them.Mr.Grey?Sorry, what is it?Taylor has caught me unawares.Hes holding the car door open, waiting for me with a look of concern.Were here, sir.Shithow long have we been here?Thanks.Ill let you know what time this evening.Focus, Grey.ANDREA AND OLIVIA BOTH look up as I come out of the elevator.Olivia flutters her eyelashes and tucks a strand of hair behind her ear.ChristIm done with this silly girl.I need HR to move her to another department.Coffee, please, Oliviaand get me a croissant.She leaps up to follow my orders.Andreaget me Welch, Barney, then Flynn, then Claude Bastille on the phone.I dont want to be disturbed at all, not even by my motherunlessunless Anastasia Steele calls.Okay?Yes, sir.Do you want to go through your schedule now?No.I need coffee and something to eat first.I scowl at Olivia, who is moving at a snails pace toward the elevator.Yes, Mr.Grey, Andrea calls after me as I open the door to my office.From my briefcase I take the padded envelope that holds my most precious possessionthe glider.I place it on my desk, and my mind drifts to Miss Steele.Shell be starting her new job this morning, meeting new peoplenew men.The thought is depressing.Shell forget me.No, she wont forget me.Women always remember the first man they fucked, dont they?Ill always hold a place in her memory, for that alone.But I dont want to be a memory: I want to stay in her mind.I need to stay in her mind.What can I do?Theres a knock at the door and Andrea appears.Coffee and croissants for you, Mr.Grey.Come in.As she scurries over to my desk her eyes dart to the glider, but wisely she holds her tongue.She places breakfast on my desk.Black coffee.Well done, Andrea.Thanks.Ive left messages for Welch, Barney, and Bastille.Flynn is calling back in five.Good.I want you to cancel any social engagements I have this week.No lunches, nothing in the evening.Get Barney on the phone and find me the number of a good florist.She scribbles furiously on her notepad.Sir, we use Arcadias Roses.Would you like me to send flowers for you?No, give me the number.Ill do it myself.Thats all.She nods and leaves promptly, as if she cant get out of my office fast enough.A few moments later the phone buzzes.Its Barney.Barney, I need you to make me a stand for a model glider.BETWEEN MEETINGS I CALL the florist and order two dozen white roses for Ana, to be delivered to her home this evening.That way she wont be embarrassed or inconvenienced at work.And she wont be able to forget me.Would you like a message with the flowers, sir?the florist asks.A message for Ana?What to say?Come back.Im sorry.I wont hit you again.The words pop unbidden into my head, making me frown.Umsomething like, Congratulations on your first day at work.I hope it went well.I spy the glider on my desk.And thank you for the glider.That was very thoughtful.It has pride of place on my desk.Christian.The florist reads it back to me.Damn, it doesnt express what I want to say to her at all.Will that be all, Mr.Grey?Yes.Thank you.Youre welcome, sir, and have a nice day.I look daggers at the phone.Nice day my ass.HEY, MAN, WHATS EATING you?Claude gets up from the floor, where Ive just knocked him flat on his lean, mean rear end.Youre on fire this afternoon, Grey.He rises slowly, with the grace of a big cat reassessing its prey.We are sparring alone in the basement gym at Grey House.Im pissed off, I hiss.His expression is cool as we circle each other.Not a good idea to enter the ring if your thoughts are elsewhere, Claude says, amused, but not taking his eyes off me.Im finding it helps.More on your left.Protect your right.Hand up, Grey.He swings and hits me on my shoulder, almost knocking me off balance.Concentrate, Grey.None of your boardroom bullshit in here.Or is it a girl?Some fine piece of ass finally cramping your cool.He sneers, goading me.It works: I middle kick to his side and drop punch once, then twice, and he staggers back, dreadlocks flying.Mind your own fucking business, Bastille.Whoa, we have found the source of the pain, Claude crows in triumph.He swings suddenly, but I anticipate his action and block him, thrusting up with a punch and a swift kick.He jumps back this time, impressed.Whatever shits happening in your privileged little world, Grey, its working.Bring it on.Oh, he is going down.I lunge at him.THE TRAFFIC IS LIGHT on the way home.Taylor, can we make a detour?Where to, sir?Can you drive past Miss Steeles apartment?Yes, sir.Ive got used to this ache.It seems to be ever present, like tinnitus.In meetings its muted and less obtrusive; its only when Im alone with my thoughts that it flares up and rages inside me.How long does this last?As we approach her apartment, my heartbeat spikes.Perhaps Ill see her.The possibility is thrilling and unsettling.And I realize that I have thought of nothing but her since she left.Her absence is my constant companion.Drive slow, I instruct Taylor as we near her building.The lights are on.Shes home!I hope shes alone, and missing me.Has she received my flowers?I want to check my phone to see if shes sent me a message, but I cant drag my gaze away from her apartment; I dont want to miss seeing her.Is she well?Is she thinking about me?I wonder how her first day at work went.Again, sir?Taylor asks, as we slowly cruise past, and the apartment disappears from view.No.I exhale; I hadnt realized Id stopped breathing.As we head back to Escala I sift through my e mails and texts, hoping for something from herbut theres nothing.Theres a text from Elena.You okay?I ignore it.ITS QUIET IN MY apartment; Id not really noticed before.Anastasias absence has accentuated the silence.Taking a sip of cognac, I wander listlessly into my library.Its ironic I never showed her this room, given her love of literature.I expect to find some solace in here because the room holds no memories of us.I survey all my books, neatly shelved and cataloged, and my eyes stray to the billiard table.Does she play billiards?I dont suppose she does.An image of her spread eagled over the green baize springs to my mind.There may not be any memories in here, but my mind is more than capable, and more than willing, to create vivid erotic images of the lovely Miss Steele.I cant bear it.I take another swig of cognac and head out of the room.TUESDAY, JUNE 7, 2011    * * *      Were fucking.Fucking hard.Against the bathroom door.Shes mine.I bury myself in her, again and again.Glorying in her: the feel of her, her smell, her taste.Fisting my hand in her hair, holding her in place.Holding her ass.Her legs wrapped around my waist.She cannot move; shes pinioned by me.Wrapped around me like silk.Her hands pulling my hair.Oh yes.Im home, shes home.This is the place I want to beinside her  She.Is.Mine.Her muscles are tightening as she comes, clenching around me, her head back.Come for me!She cries out and I followoh yes, my sweet, sweet Anastasia.She smiles, sleepy, satedand oh so sexy.She stands and gazes at me, that playful smile on her lips, then pushes me away and walks backward, saying nothing.I grab her and were in the playroom.Im holding her down over the bench.I raise my arm to punish her, belt in handand she disappears.Shes by the door.Her face white, shocked and sad, and shes silently drifting awayThe door has disappeared, and she wont stop.She holds out her hands in entreaty.Join me, she whispers, but shes moving backward, getting fainterdisappearing before my eyesvanishingshes gone.No!I shout.No!But I have no voice.I have nothing.Im mute.Muteagain.I wake, confused.Shitits a dream.Another vivid dream.Different, though.Hell!Im a sticky mess.Briefly I feel that long forgotten but familiar sense of fear and exhilarationbut Elena doesnt own me now.Jesus H.  Christ, Ive come for Team USA.This hasnt happened to me since I was, what?Fifteen, sixteen?I lie back in the darkness, disgusted with myself.I drag my T shirt off and wipe myself down.Theres semen everywhere.I find myself smirking in the darkness, despite the dull ache of loss.The erotic dream was worth it.The rest of itfucking hell.I turn over and go back to sleep.He is gone.Mommy is sitting on the couch.She is quiet.She looks at the wall and blinks sometimes.I stand in front of her, but she doesnt see me.I wave and she sees me, but she waves me away.No, Maggot, not now.He hurts Mommy.He hurts me.I hate him.He makes me so mad.Its best when its just Mommy and me.She is mine then.My Mommy.My tummy hurts.It is hungry again.I am in the kitchen, looking for cookies.I pull the chair to the cupboard and climb up.I find a box of crackers.It is the only thing in the cupboard.I sit down on the chair and open the box.There are two left.I eat them.They taste good.I hear him.Hes back.I jump down and I run to my bedroom and climb into bed.I pretend to be asleep.He pokes me with his finger.Stay here, you little shit.Im going to fuck your bitch of a mother.I dont want to see your fuck ugly face for the rest of the evening.Understand?He slaps my face when I dont reply.Or you get the burn, you little prick.No.No.I dont like that.I dont like the burn.It hurts.Got it, retard?I know he wants me to cry.But its hard.I cant make the noise.He hits me with his fist  Startled awake again, I lie panting in the pale dawn light, waiting for my heart rate to slow, trying to lose the acrid taste of fear in my mouth.She saved you from this shit, Grey.You didnt relive the pain of these memories when she was with you.Why did you let her leave?I glance at the clock: 5:15.Time for a run.HER BUILDING LOOKS GLOOMY; its still in shadow, untouched by the early morning sun.Fitting.It reflects my mood.Her apartment is dark inside, yet the curtains to the room I watched before are drawn.It must be her room.I hope to God that shes sleeping alone up there.I envisage her curled up on her white iron bed, a small ball of Ana.Is she dreaming of me?Do I give her nightmares?Has she forgotten me?Ive never felt this miserable, not even as a teenager.Maybe before I was a Greymy memory spirals back.No, nonot awake as well.This is too much.Pulling my hood up and leaning against the granite wall, Im hidden in the doorway of the building opposite.The awful thought crosses my mind that I might be standing here in a week, a montha year?Watching, waiting, just to catch a glimpse of the girl who used to be mine.Its painful.Ive become what shes always accused me of beingher stalker.I cant go on like this.I have to see her.See that shes okay.I need to erase the last image I have of her: hurt, humiliated, defeatedand leaving me.I have to think of a way.BACK AT ESCALA, GAIL watches me impassively.I didnt ask for this.I stare at the omelet shes placed in front of me.Ill throw it away, then, Mr.Grey, she says, and reaches for the plate.She knows I hate waste, but she doesnt quail at my hard stare.You did this on purpose, Mrs.Jones.Interfering woman.And she smiles, a small victorious smile.I scowl, but shes unfazed, and with the memory of last nights nightmare lingering, I devour my breakfast.COULD I JUST CALL Ana and say hi?Would she take my call?My eyes wander to the glider on my desk.She asked for a clean break.I should honor that and leave her alone.But I want to hear her voice.For a moment I contemplate calling her and hanging up, just to hear her speak.Christian?Christian, are you okay?Sorry, Ros, what was that?Youre so distracted.Ive never seen you like this.Im fine, I snap.Shitconcentrate, Grey.What were you saying?Ros eyes me suspiciously.I was saying that SIP is in more financial difficulty than we thought.Are you sure you want to go ahead?Yes.My voice is vehement.I am.Their team will be here this afternoon to sign the heads of agreement.Good.Now, whats the latest on our proposal for Eamon Kavanagh?I STAND BROODING, STARING down through the slatted wooden blinds at Taylor, who is parked outside Flynns office.Its late afternoon and Im still thinking about Ana.Christian, Im more than happy to take your money and watch you stare out the window, but I dont think the view is the reason youre here, Flynn says.When I turn to face him hes regarding me with an air of polite anticipation.I sigh and make my way to his couch.The nightmares are back.Like never before.Flynn lifts a brow.The same ones?Yes.Whats changed?He cocks his head to one side, waiting for my response.When I remain mute, he adds, Christian, you look as miserable as sin.Somethings happened.I feel like I did with Elena; part of me doesnt want to tell him, because then its real.I met a girl.And?She left me.He looks surprised.Women have left you before.Why is this different?I stare at him blankly.Why is it different?Because Ana was different.My thoughts blur together in a colorful tangled tapestry: she wasnt a submissive.We had no contract.She was sexually inexperienced.She was the first woman I wanted more from than just sex.Christall the firsts I experienced with her: the first girl Id slept beside, the first virgin, the first to meet my family, the first to fly in Charlie Tango, the first I took soaring.YeahDifferent.Flynn interrupts my thoughts.Its a simple question, Christian.I miss her.His face remains kind and concerned, but he gives nothing away.Youve never missed any of the women you were involved with previously?No.So there was something different about her, he prompts.I shrug, but he persists.Did you have a contractual relationship with her?Was she a submissive?Id hoped she would be.But it wasnt for her.Flynn frowns.I dont understand.I broke one of my rules.I chased this girl, thinking that shed be interested, and it turned out it wasnt for her.Tell me what happened.The floodgates open and I recount the past months events, from the moment Ana fell into my office to when she left last Saturday morning.I see.Youve certainly packed a lot in since we last spoke.He rubs his chin as he studies me.There are many issues here, Christian.But right now the one I want to focus on is how you felt when she said she loved you.I inhale sharply, my gut tightening with fear.Horrified, I whisper.Of course you did.He shakes his head.Youre not the monster you think you are.Youre more than worthy of affection, Christian.You know that.Ive told you often enough.Its only in your mind that youre not.I give him a level gaze, ignoring his platitude.And how do you feel now?he asks.Lost.I feel lost.I miss her.I want to see her.Im in the confessional once more, owning up to my sins: the dark, dark need that I have for her, as if she were an addiction.So in spite of the fact that, as you perceive it, she couldnt fulfill your needs, you miss her?Yes.Its not just my perception, John.She cant be what I want her to be, and I cant be what she wants me to be.Are you sure?She walked out.She walked out because you belted her.If she doesnt share your tastes, can you blame her?No.Have you thought about trying a relationship her way?What?I stare at him, shocked.He continues, Did you find sexual relations with her satisfying?Yes, of course, I snap, irritated.He ignores my tone.Did you find beating her satisfying?Very.Would you like to do it again?Do that to her again?And watch her walk outagain?No.And whys that?Because its not her scene.I hurt her.Really hurt herand she cantshe wont I pause.She doesnt enjoy it.She was angry.Really fucking angry.Her expression, her wounded eyes, will haunt me for a long timeand I never want to be the cause of that look again.Are you surprised?I shake my head.She was mad, I whisper.Id never seen her so angry.How did that make you feel?Helpless.And thats a familiar feeling, he prompts.Familiar, how?What does he mean?Dont you recognize yourself at all?Your past?His question knocks me off balance.Fuck, weve been over and over this.No, I dont.Its different.The relationship I had with Mrs.Lincoln was completely different.I wasnt referring to Mrs.Lincoln.What were you referring to?My voice is pin drop quiet, because suddenly I see where hes going with this.You know.I gulp for air, swamped by the impotence and rage of a defenseless child.Yes.The rage.The deep infuriating rageand fear.The darkness swirls angrily inside me.Its not the same, I hiss through gritted teeth, as I strain to hold my temper.No, its not, Flynn concedes.But the image of her rage comes unwelcome to my mind.This is what you really like?Me, like this?It dampens my anger.I know what youre trying to do here, Doctor, but its an unfair comparison.She asked me to show her.Shes a consenting adult, for fucks sake.She could have safe worded.She could have told me to stop.She didnt.I know.I know.He holds his hand up.Im just callously illustrating a point, Christian.Youre an angry man, and you have every reason to be.Im not going to rehash all that right nowyoure obviously suffering, and the whole point of these sessions is to move you to a place where you are more accepting and comfortable with yourself.He pauses.This girl  Anastasia, I mutter petulantly.Anastasia.Shes obviously had a profound effect on you.Her leaving has triggered your abandonment issues and your PTSD.She clearly means much more to you than youre willing to admit to yourself.I take a sharp breath.Is that why this is so painful?Because she means more, so much more?You need to focus on where you want to be, Flynn continues.And it sounds to me like you want to be with this girl.You miss her.Do you want to be with her?Be with Ana?Yes, I whisper.Then you have to focus on that goal.This goes back to what Ive been banging on about for our last few sessionsthe SFBT.If shes in love with you, as she told you she is, she must be suffering, too.So I repeat my question: have you considered a more conventional relationship with this girl?No, I havent.Why not?Because its never occurred to me that I could.Well if shes not prepared to be your submissive, you cant play the role of dominant.I glare at him.Its not a roleits who I am.And from nowhere, I recall an earlier e mail to Anastasia.My words: What I think you fail to realize is that in Dom/sub relationships it is the sub who has all the power.Thats you.Ill repeat thisyou are the one with all the power.Not I.  If she doesnt want to do thisthen neither can I.   Hope stirs in my chest.Could I?Could I have a vanilla relationship with Anastasia?My scalp prickles.Fuck.Possibly.If I could, would she want me back?Christian, you have demonstrated that you are an extraordinarily capable person, in spite of your problems.Youre a rare individual.Once you focus on a goal, you drive ahead and achieve itusually surpassing all your own expectations.Listening to you today, its clear you were focused on getting Anastasia to where you wanted her to be, but you didnt take into account her inexperience or her feelings.It seems to me that youve been so focused on reaching your goal that you missed the journey that you were taking together.The last month flashes before me: her tripping into my office, her acute embarrassment at Claytons, her witty, snarky e mails, her smart mouthher giggleher quiet fortitude and defiance, her courageand it occurs to me that I have enjoyed every single minute.Every infuriating, distracting, humorous, sensual, carnal second of heryes, I have.Weve been on an extraordinary journey, both of uswell, I certainly have.My thoughts take a darker turn.She doesnt know the depths of my depravity, the darkness in my soul, the monster beneathmaybe I should leave her alone.Im not worthy of her.She cant love me.But even as I think the words, I know that I dont have the strength to stay away from herif shell have me.Flynn summons my attention.Christian, think about it.Our time is up now.I want to see you in a few days and talk through some of the other issues you mentioned.Ill have Janet call Andrea and arrange an appointment.He stands, and I know its time to leave.Youve given me a lot to think about, I tell him.I wouldnt be doing my job if I didnt.Just a few days, Christian.We have so much more to talk about.He shakes my hand and gives me a reassuring smile, and I leave with a small blossom of hope.STANDING ON THE BALCONY, I survey Seattle at night.Up here Im at one remove, away from it all.What did she call it?My ivory tower.Normally I find it peacefulbut lately my peace of mind has been shattered by a certain blue eyed young woman.Have you thought about trying a relationship her way?Flynns words taunt me, suggesting so many possibilities.Could I win her back?The thought terrifies me.I take a sip of my cognac.Why would she want me back?Could I ever be what she wants me to be?I wont let go of my hope.I need to find a way.I need her.Something startles mea movement, a shadow at the periphery of my vision.I frown.What the?I turn toward the shadow, but find nothing.Im seeing things now.I slug the cognac and head back into the living room.WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8, 2011    * * *      Mommy!Mommy!Mommy is asleep on the floor.She has been asleep for a long time.I shake her.She doesnt wake up.I call her.She doesnt wake up.He isnt here and still Mommy doesnt wake up.I am thirsty.In the kitchen I pull a chair to the sink and I have a drink.The water splashes over my sweater.My sweater is dirty.Mommy is still asleep.Mommy, wake up!She lies still.She is cold.I fetch my blankie and I cover Mommy and I lie down on the sticky green rug beside her.My tummy hurts.It is hungry, but Mommy is still asleep.I have two toy cars.One red.One yellow.My green car is gone.They race by the floor where Mommy is sleeping.I think Mommy is sick.I search for something to eat.In the icebox I find peas.They are cold.I eat them slowly.They make my tummy hurt.I sleep beside Mommy.The peas are gone.In the icebox is something.It smells funny.I lick it and my tongue sticks.I eat it slowly.It tastes nasty.I drink some water.I play with my cars and I sleep beside Mommy.Mommy is so cold and she wont wake up.The door crashes open.I cover Mommy with my blankie.Fuck.What the fuck happened here?Oh, the crazy fucked up bitch.Shit.Fuck.Get out of my way, you little shit.He kicks me and I hit my head on the floor.My head hurts.He calls somebody and he goes.He locks the door.I lay down beside Mommy.My head hurts.The lady policeman is here.No.No.No.Dont touch me.Dont touch me.Dont touch me.I stay by Mommy.No.Stay away from me.The lady policeman has my blankie and she grabs me.I scream.Mommy.Mommy.The words are gone.I cant say the words.Mommy cant hear me.I have no words.I wake breathing hard, taking huge gulps of air, checking my surroundings.Oh, thank GodIm in my bed.Slowly the fear recedes.Im twenty seven, not four.This shit has to stop.I used to have my nightmares under control.Maybe one every couple of weeks, but nothing like thisnight after night.Since she left.I turn over and lie flat on my back, staring at the ceiling.When she slept beside me, I slept well.I need her in my life, in my bed.She was the day to my night.Im going to get her back.How?Have you thought about trying a relationship her way?She wants hearts and flowers.Can I give her that?I frown, trying to recall the romantic moments in my lifeAnd theres nothingexcept with Ana.The more.The gliding, and IHOP, and taking her up in Charlie Tango.Maybe I can do this.I drift back to sleep, the mantra in my head: Shes mine.Shes mineand I smell her, feel her soft skin, taste her lips, and hear her moans.Exhausted, I fall into an erotic, Ana filled dream.I wake suddenly.My scalp tingles, and for a moment I think whatevers disturbed me is external rather than internal.I sit up and rub my head and slowly scan the room.In spite of the carnal dream, my body has behaved.Elena would be pleased.She texted yesterday, but Elenas the last person I want to talk totheres only one thing I want to do right now.I get up and pull on my running gear.Im going to check on Ana.HER STREET IS QUIET except for the rumble of a delivery truck and the out of tune whistling of a solitary dog walker.Her apartment is in darkness, the curtains to her room closed.I keep a silent vigil from my stalkers hide, staring up at the windows and thinking.I need a plana plan to win her back.As dawns light brightens her window, I turn my iPod up loud, and with Moby blaring in my ears I run back to Escala.ILL HAVE A CROISSANT, Mrs.Jones.She stills in surprise and I raise a brow.Apricot preserves?she asks, recovering.Please.Ill heat up a couple for you, Mr.Grey.Heres your coffee.Thank you, Gail.She smiles.Is it just because Im having croissants?If it makes her that happy, I should have them more often.IN THE BACK OF the Audi, I plot.I need to get up close and personal with Ana Steele, to begin my campaign to win her back.I call Andrea, knowing that at 7:15 she wont be at her desk yet, and I leave a voice mail.Andrea, as soon as youre in, I want to run through my schedule for the next few days.Therestep one in my offensive is to make time in my schedule for Ana.What the hell am I supposed to be doing this week?Currently, I dont have a clue.Normally Im on this shit, but lately Ive been all over the place.Now I have a mission to focus on.You can do this, Grey.But deep down I wish I had the courage of my convictions.Anxiety unfurls in my gut.Can I convince Ana to take me back?Will she listen?I hope so.This has to work.I miss her.MR.GREY, I CANCELED all your social events this week, apart from the one for tomorrowI dont know what the occasion is.Your calendar says Portland, thats it.Yes!The fucking photographer!I beam at Andrea, and her eyebrows shoot up in surprise.Thanks, Andrea.Thats all for now.Send in Sam.Sure, Mr.Grey.Would you like some more coffee?Please.With milk?Yes.Latte.Thank you.She smiles politely and leaves.This is it!My in!The photographer!Nowwhat to do?MY MORNING HAS BEEN back to back meetings, and my staff have been watching me nervously, waiting for me to explode.Okay, thats been my modus operandi for the last few daysbut today I feel clearer, calmer, and present; able to deal with everything.Its now lunchtime; my workout with Claude has gone well.The only fly in the ointment is that theres no more news about Leila.All we know is that shes split up with her husband and she could be anywhere.If she surfaces, Welch will find her.Im famished.Olivia sets a plate down on my desk.Your sandwich, Mr.Grey.Chicken and mayonnaise?Um  I stare at her.She just doesnt get it.Olivia offers an inept apology.I said chicken with mayonnaise, Olivia.Its not that hard.Im sorry, Mr.Grey.Its fine.Just go.She looks relieved but scrambles to leave the

Northeast Forty Fifth?Yes.Im going to buy Ana an iPad.Leaning back in my seat, I close my eyes and contemplate which apps and songs Im going to download and install for her.I could choose Toxic.I smirk at the thought.No, I dont think that would be popular with her.Shed be mad as helland for the first time in a while the thought of her mad makes me smile.Mad like she was in Georgia, not like last Saturday.I shift in my seat; I dont want to be reminded of that.I turn my thoughts back to potential song choices, feeling more buoyant than I have in days.My phone buzzes, and my heart rate spikes.Dare I hope?Hey.Asshole.Beer?Hell.A text from my brother.No.Busy.Youre always busy.Going to Barbados tomorrow.To, you know, RELAX.See you when I get back.And we will have that beer!!!Laters, Lelliot.Safe Travels.ITS BEEN A DIVERTING evening, filled with musica nostalgic journey through my iTunes, making a playlist for Anastasia.I remember her dancing in my kitchen; I wish I knew what shed been listening to.She looked totally ridiculous, and utterly adorable.That was after I fucked her for the first time.No.After I made love to her the first time?Neither term feels right.I recall her impassioned plea the night I introduced her to my parents.I want you to make love to me.How shocked I was by her simple statementand yet all she wanted was to touch me.I shudder at the thought.I have to make her understand that this is a hard limit for meI cannot tolerate being touched.I shake my head.Youre getting way ahead of yourself, Greyyou have to close this deal first.I check the inscription on the iPad.Anastasiathis is for you.I know what you want to hear.This music on here says it for me.Christian  Perhaps this will do it.She wants hearts and flowers; perhaps this will come close.But I shake my head, because I have no idea.Theres so much I want to say to her, if shell listen.And if she wont, the songs will say it for me.I just hope she allows me the opportunity to give them to her.But if she doesnt like my proposition, if she doesnt like the thought of being with mewhat will I do?I might just be a convenient ride to Portland.The thought depresses me, as I head toward my bedroom for some much needed sleep.Do I dare to hope?Damn it.Yes, I do.THURSDAY, JUNE 9, 2011    * * *      The doctor holds up her hands.Im not going to hurt you.I need to check your tummy.Here.She gives me a cold, round sucky thing and she lets me play with it.You put it on your tummy, and I wont touch you and I can hear your tummy.The doctor is goodthe doctor is Mommy.My new mommy is pretty.Shes like an angel.A doctor angel.She strokes my hair.I like it when she strokes my hair.She lets me eat ice cream and cake.She doesnt shout when she finds the bread and apples hidden in my shoes.Or under my bed.Or under my pillow.Darling, the food is in the kitchen.Just find me or Daddy when youre hungry.Point with your finger.Can you do that?There is another boy.Lelliot.He is mean.So I punch him.But my new mommy doesnt like the fighting.There is a piano.I like the noise.I stand at the piano and press the white and the black.The noise from the black is strange.Miss Kathie sits at the piano with me.She teaches the black and the white notes.She has long brown hair and she looks like someone I know.She smells of flowers and apple pie baking.She smells of good.She makes the piano sound pretty.She is kind to me.She smiles and I play.She smiles and I am happy.She smiles and shes Ana.Beautiful Ana, sitting with me as I play a fugue, a prelude, an adagio, a sonata.She sighs, resting her head on my shoulder, and she smiles.I love listening to you play, Christian.I love you, Christian.Ana.Stay with me.Youre mine.I love you, too.I wake, with a start.Today, I win her back.
