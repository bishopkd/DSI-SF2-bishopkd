He wanted to stay awake and live in this moment of not being alone.Of being beside someone who knew the darkest, saddest part of it all.What a failure he was.That he hadnt been the husband Jessie deserved.The giant crater of grief that was inside him, because he had lost not only the promise of a future with a new, better marriage, not only a wife, but a child.That he had lost himself.Because that was the bottom line of it all.The most important part of who hed been was husband.But he had invested more in being a rancher.In being a cowboy.Unfortunately, when you invested so much in a hunk of dirt and lost everything else, a hunk of dirt was all you had left.That which a man sows is what he reaps.Or something.Though he could see now that he had more than dirt.He had his barn, anyway.And it had been rebuilt.Which made a lot of other things seem possible.The sky was turning a lighter shade of blue, and really, he could get up, take a shower and get ready to start his day.Go out and work on that hunk of dirt that had become his entire life.But Liss was in here.And he was warm.And he wasnt alone.So instead he decided to stay in bed.* * * JUST A FEW hours now, Liss said, looking around at the barn, all decked out for the party tonight.The sliding side doors were thrown open wide, white Christmas lights strung from the top of the frame, out to a tree outside, creating a twinkling canopy.Mason jars were strung from the tree branches, with flameless candles inside.Fire safety was important, for obvious reasons.There were tables situated outside, and inside, everything set back up since the night she and Connor had spent on the floor.Therefore, there was no ire from Sadie.Though, while she wasnt filled with ire, she was wandering around the barn straightening things that were already straight and chattering like a ferret.Eli was hanging back, obviously well educated in what to do when Sadie was in full Sadie mode.Jack was outside, getting the barbecues fired up, directing those who had volunteered to come and help with food.Jack was surprisingly organized and efficient when he needed to be.And it always came as a shock to Liss, because he seemed to work hard to keep his competence under wraps.He had the look of a man who ambled through life, stumbling upon good luck, and sticking it in the pocket of his Wrangler jeans, hanging on to it till he needed to spend some.He owned a fairly large piece of property and managed to have gotten into the high cost game of breeding horses.She, and everyone else, assumed he must have financed all of that with earnings from his stint in the rodeo.Though she couldnt imagine he made all that much money doing the occasional bull riding competition circuit.And Jack never shared.He just kind of smiled and winked.And everyone let it go, and women fell at his feet, and he moved on.An enigma wrapped in a mystery, wrapped in flannel.But whatever his flaws he was a good friend, and he had proven it over and over, not just today, but when dealing with Connor over the past few years.Shed gone into caregiver mode.Jack had made it his mission to make Connor smile.And hed done a damn good job.But then, Jack made everyone smile.Are you nervous?Connor asked Eli, who was pacing the length of the barn.Nerves are for people who dont have an early lead in the polls.And yet it was clear that nerves were also for Eli, in spite of the lead.I heard that polls can be superinaccurate, Kate said, perched on one of the long tables that would later hold pie and drinks.Because data can be skewed.Who have you been talking to?Connor asked.Some of the old guys who come into the Farm and Garden, Kate said, blinking slowly.You need some friends who arent paranoid old men, Connor said.I have friends.The other girls who barrel race.I hang out with Sierra West during competition.Kate crossed her arms.See?Friends.Friends who are women.And my age.Yeah, Katie.Your social life is hopping.People who live in glass houses that are actually Jack Daniels bottles should not throw stones, Connor, Kate said, her tone dry.For your information, he said, Im sober.I have been.Kates eyes widened, and Eli turned to look at him.You are?she asked.Lisss throat tightened, and she fought the urge to excuse herself.Because she felt conspicuous, standing there during this moment, which was clearly a big one.Connors drinking wasnt something that the family could ignore.It wasnt something anyone could ignore.And yet as far she knew, none of them had ever talked about it.Yes.I havent gotten drunk in weeks.I didnt know you were trying to stop, Eli said.Connor looked at her.Yeah, well, I stopped around the time Liss moved in.I figured she didnt need to deal with me being hungover.You never minded me dealing with you hungover, Eli said.I minded, Connor said.Well, I feel like I already won the election, Eli said, smiling.Now it doesnt matter what happens.Connor frowned.Really?Eli slapped him on the shoulder.Hell, no.Im happy for you, but I need to win this election.Connor laughed.Good.That was way too much sincerity.Seriously, though, thats amazing.Eli shook his head.Im proud of you.Its really nice that youre able to be proud of me for no longer being an asshole.Ill try to set the bar higher in the future.Men, Kate said, sliding off the table and crossing the barn, throwing her arms around Connor and hugging him tight.Im really proud of you.She kissed him on the cheek and took a step back.What was that for?Connor asked, his voice rough.Because you scare the hell out of me, Kate said.I dont want you to leave me, or die, like everyone else.Liss swallowed hard, blinking rapidly to keep from weeping all over a moment she had no right to invade.Jack chose that moment to walk into the barn.Why are we all looking somber?he asked.Connor is sober, Eli said.Well, fuck.Going to the bar is going to be a lot less fun now, Jack said.Nice for your mental health and stuff, though.Thanks, Jack, Connor said.That sentiment is more my speed.Anyway, tonight is about Eli.This family has been down a few times in the course of our history, but were not out.Eli, youve proven that big time.Youve done more than you think, Eli said.Both of you are the best.Now, I propose we have some beer...No, soda, Jack said.A toast for all the excellent shit thats happening.Good thing we have soda, Sadie said, finally coming over to their end of the barn, crossing the space and giving Connor a side hug.Liss wished that she could hug and kiss him.But she couldnt, not here.She realized she was the only one who hadnt said anything when Connor had made his announcement.Because, of course, she already knew.It would expose some of the intimacy that was growing between them.But then, they had always had a certain level of intimacy.And she did live with him.She wasnt sure what she was supposed to do now.Was commenting acting casual?Or was not commenting more casual?This sucked.She didnt normally have to think through her interactions with these people quite this hard.She didnt normally have to think about them at all.In fact, these friends, this family, this group, were the only people she didnt overthink things with.Because it wasnt all checks and balances, and making sure she was worthy.And she hated that she was feeling all nervous and insecure now.Because she and Connor were...What even were they right now?They had established the friends and lovers thing.With the intent that they would sleep separately, have sex, but not be in a relationship.But something had changed last night.Something major.She wasnt sure what to do with it.Especially not right now.So she just sort of stood there awkwardly, not certain of what to do with her hands.It was nice of you to get soda, Sadie, Jack said, digging around in one of the ice chests that was shoved against the back wall of the barn, waiting to be transferred to a more decorative metal bucket closer to starting time.For the kids.Like Katie.Fuck you up, down and sideways, Monaghan, Kate said, extending her hand and accepting a can of Coke from him, even while she insulted him.Its so cute when you try to use grown up words.I could punch him for you if you want, Connor said.I cant, Eli said, because I cant risk a violation of the law at this point.But Im with you in spirit.Im punching him in the face in my head.Go on, Kate said, looking at Connor.Hit him.Sorry, Kate, Connor said.Jack would have to do something pretty bad for me to punch him.Seeing as I didnt punch him the time he talked us into skinny dipping and we got caught by those older girls...You talk about that like its my fault.It was embarrassing for me, too, Jack said.You were not embarrassed, Eli said.You hit on them.You were a scrawny, naked thirteen year old hitting on seventeen year olds.You had no shame then, and you have no shame now.That is what my headstone will say.Kate shook her head.You wont even punch him for your own sister.He isnt allowed to, Sadie said.Because Jack might bleed on the floor.And everything is perfect.I do not have time to go scrubbing bloodstains out of wooden planks.There you go, Connor said.The most compelling reason of all not to punch Jack.Sadie would get mad at me, and I am afraid of Sadie.Rightfully so, Sadie said, making a severe expression that wasnt all that severe.Okay, enough standing around.Jack, youre supposed to be supervising the meat.A lopsided grin crossed Jacks face.Okay, Sadie.I guess I will go supervise the meat.He raised his can of soda in salute and walked back out of the barn.Eli, Sadie said, you probably need to put on something you havent been working in.And I probably do, too.Right, Eli said.Kate moved toward the barn door.I might go and see if they need more help with the food, she said, stepping out.I guess well just stay here and wait for people to start arriving, Connor said.Okay, well be back in about an hour, Sadie said, grabbing Elis hand and leading him from the barn.As soon as the door closed behind them, Liss turned to Connor.They are just escaping to have sex, arent they?Oh, absolutely, Connor said.Liss cleared her throat, unhappy to discover that the awkwardness had not escaped the room along with the others.Everything looks...nice, she said.Are you okay?Youve been very quiet.In fact, I dont think youve said anything for the past twenty minutes.Sure I have.I asked if you thought Eli and Sadie were going to...you know.Whats up, Liss?She sighed.Well, I knew already that you werent drinking.And its hard for me to know what to do in front of everyone else.And now that I think about it, I was probably looking a lot more conspicuous than if I had just tried to fake surprise and join in.But I kind of forgot how to act naturally.She made an exasperated noise.No, you know, the thing is I didnt forget how to act naturally.Its just that what feels natural now isnt something I can do in public.Connors eyes darkened.Oh, yeah?What feels natural to you?This, she said, closing the distance between them and kissing him.Feels good to me, too, he said, a smile curving his lips.Well figure it out.She had to believe that.The alternative didnt bear consideration.THE ENTIRE TOWN of Copper Ridge appeared to have turned up at Elis party.At least as far as the town was concerned, Eli had the vote.But they would have to wait and see what the county decided.Dinner had been eaten, dancing had been going on for quite some time and most of the pie that had been spread out on the long tables inside the barn had been eaten, too.And the countdown to the announcement was winding down.Eli was ahead in the count with most precincts reporting, but Connor knew his brother wouldnt start celebrating until it was more of a certainty.Still, Connor figured they would be calling it soon.Even if the counting didnt finish for another few hours, Eli was ahead by enough of a margin that there would be no way for his opponent to close the gap.A local camera crew had assembled to film the results, TVs mounted to the walls playing continuous footage of ever growing percentages.Measures that were passing and failing, city council positions and, of course, the race between Eli Garrett and David Wright for the position of Logan County sheriff.Eli had a lead of over ten points, but even with that level of certainty, Connor felt nervous.Because there was a lot at stake here for his brother, and he found he cared a whole hell of a lot more than hed anticipated he might.It was kind of refreshing.To care about something more than making it through the day.To feel all right about the prospect of going to bed, and what dreams might find him there.The screen on the television changed back to the news anchors faces, with percentages on the side.Sadie stood up and started to clank her fork on the side of a Mason jar, trying to get some quiet in the barn.But the noise continued, everyone oblivious to what was going on around them.She tried again, this time clinking more insistently.Suddenly, a high pitched whistle cut through the din.Connor turned toward the sound and saw Kate climbing up onto her chair, planting her boots firmly where she had just been sitting.Hey!she shouted.Be quiet now, my brother is about to win an election.She tugged down on the brim of her hat, nodded her head and sat.Connor turned to Liss, who was sitting next to him.Damn, I could use her to herd cows.Sadie turned the volume up on the TV and stood next to Eli, her arms wrapped around his waist as everyone turned their attention to the announcements.Measure 62 passed and so did measure 64.Connor felt slightly guilty at the realization that he had no clue what in hell those were.Measure 47 failed.Most of the city council positions remained the same.And when the results for sheriff flashed up on the screen, it was with a kind of anticlimactic speed.There was no pause or drumroll, just a clear and quick announcement that Eli Garrett was the new sheriff of Logan County.A cheer rose up through the barn, hats flying through the air, and the sound of thunderous applause echoing off the walls.Eli grabbed Sadie and kissed her, dipping her low, which only caused everyone around to cheer louder.He looked over at Liss, and he found he wanted to kiss her, too.But he didnt.Instead, he stood and joined in the clapping and boot stomping.Liss was beaming, and he couldve sworn hed never seen a more beautiful sight.He did it!she shouted over everyone else.He couldnt kiss her, but hugging her, putting his arm around her, would be normal enough.She was right; it was hard to know what to do.He moved closer to her and wrapped his arm around her shoulders, squeezing her tight.She leaned in, putting her hand on his chest, and he felt a rush of desire flood through him.He pulled away from her and she looked at him, hurt and confusion visible in her eyes.He leaned in and whispered in her ear.Its too much for me to handle.Then maybe we should go somewhere more private.He should say no.He should absolutely not sneak out of the barn during his brothers moment of triumph.Not for something as base as sex.Saving a kitten from a tree, or a puppy from a sinkhole, sure.But sex?No.Lets go, he said.Of course he was going to do it.Whether he should or not.He couldnt say no to this.Couldnt say no to her.And he didnt want to.She gave him a look that lit him on fire from his chest down to his toes.And then she turned and walked out of the barn, weeding through the crowd of people.And he followed.Because he could do nothing else.He tipped his hat and smiled, and tried to look as if he was paying attention as people greeted him, all the while keeping an eye on Liss.The back of her.From the glossy waves of copper hair to her perfectly rounded ass.He didnt want to lose sight of her.She managed to slip through the thickest part of the crowd, and he stopped making eye contact with people.No, now he was just busting through.Every man for himself.And to hell with them if they thought he was rude.He didnt care.Not right now.All that mattered was Liss.All that mattered was this.She flicked a glance at him over her shoulder, the Mason jar lights from overhead casting a golden glow onto her hair, making it shimmer like it was on fire.He hoped she was on fire.Because God knew he was.He was burning.Burning like his barn, and he didnt know if there was any chance of him ever being rebuilt.But if not, if in the end all that was left was a big pile of ash, it would be worth it.For this.For her.He was moving forward, one foot after the other.Him after her.After a feeling that hed thought was long dead.She made him want.Made him need.Made him crave when for a whole lot of years hed been trying to sink into the cushions of his couch and dissolve completely.She made him want to feel when hed spent years bathed in an alcohol haze.He didnt want a haze when he was with Liss.He wanted her, all of her, burning hot and bright and sharp.Pleasurable, painful, anything and everything.And that scared him.Scared him to death.But there was still nothing he could do but follow her.They escaped the lights in the crowd, the noise and music fading behind them.And when he was confident no one was around, he closed the distance between them and took her hand in his.She looked up at him, her smile stoking the fire inside him.He loved that he could make her smile like that.He could even smile back, and it wasnt hard.They walked down the dirt road that led to the old barn.He didnt use it for anything anymore, and the red paint was faded, worn and revealing the natural wood planks beneath.There were a couple of holes in the roof, which hed been meaning to fix, because he didnt want the place to fall into total disrepair.This was the barn that had been the center of his fathers ranching operation.The one that had become Connors responsibility at a very early age.Part of the reason why the Garrett Ranch lived inside him.Why the dirt on his hands had settled down beneath his skin, gotten into his blood.Yes, hed poured too much into it and not enough into his marriage, but the fact remained he would always pour into this place.Because it was home.Because it lived all around him and in him.And coming here with Liss now felt right.Possibly because they were going to have sex, and nothing at all felt wrong about that right now.Seeing as he had spent so much time feeling as if everything was wrong, he would take this whatever the significance was.He pushed open the side door and pulled her inside and up against his body.Finally, she said, the word almost a purr.It slid down his spine, settling in the pit of his stomach and down lower, his cock getting hard just thinking about kissing her, touching her, having her.My thoughts exactly, he said, holding on to her hips tight, walking them both backward against the rough wood siding.This was what he wanted.To screw her up against a wall.To show her just how desperate he felt.Just how much he needed her.Another thing hed never done before.Because he was always lost, halfway somewhere else, his brain on the cows, the weather, the land.But he was in it right now, in it with her, and he couldnt spare a single thought for anything that wasnt Liss.I have a feeling this is going to be quick, he whispered, kissing the side of her neck and reveling in the sound she made.Thats fine.Im feeling pretty quick myself, she said.He pushed her top up, exposing her lace covered breasts.He tugged the bra down, exposing her skin, her perfect, rosy nipples.Damn, he loved breasts.He couldnt believe he had gone this long without seeing them.More specifically, he loved Lisss breasts.So damn much that looking at her hurt.So damn much that he doubted he would ever be able to look at her again without thinking about her like this.Without picturing this.He pushed that thought out of his mind, because it was irrelevant right now.Because right now she was getting naked for him.Right now he could look at her if he wanted to.He could taste her.And he did.Lowering his head and sliding the flat of his tongue over her nipple.She arched against him, a hoarse cry escaping her lips, and he sucked the tightened bud in deep, grazing his teeth over it lightly, relishing the moment she dug her fingernails into his shoulders.He unbuckled her belt, undid the snap on her jeans and pushed them down her hips.Those are gonna have to come off all the way, honey.She made quick work of undressing while he shoved his pants halfway down his hips, taking his wallet out of his back pocket and fishing out a condom and rolling it on.He cupped her ass and slid his hand down to her thigh, hooking her leg up over his hip, opening her to him as he thrust deep inside.He pressed his lips to her neck, holding her tight as he withdrew and thrust harder.Ive never done this with anyone before, he whispered.Ive never wanted someone so badly I had to sneak out of a party, fuck them up against a wall.He didnt talk to women like this.He didnt do shit like this.But someone had broken free inside him, a beast that was on the loose now, prowling around, chasing after him while he tried desperately to stay ahead of the jaws threatening to close tight around his throat.She shuddered beneath him, rolling her hips in time with his movements.That, combined with the tight, hot clasp of her body, sending him straight to the edge.He held on tight for as long as he could before he couldnt hold back any longer.Connor.She shuddered, her internal muscles tightening around his cock as she came hard.Her name on his lips, the force of her release, cut his control loose.His blood was roaring in his ears, his release coming on with all the force of a freight train.And all he could do was hang on tight while he was consumed.When it was over, he was shaking, unable to catch his breath.But so was she.He kissed her lips, moving away from her and disposing of the condom in a bin in the corner.Arent you worried about foxes?He turned to face her.Who the hell can think about foxes with you standing there looking like that?he asked.Well, a couple weeks ago you could.She moved away from the wall, wincing.Now you really will be picking splinters out of my ass.And my shoulders.Shit, he said.Im sorry.Dont be, she said, bending down and collecting her jeans, putting them on quickly as she righted her top.Ive never done anything like that, either.With Marshall it was all comfortable.And...I should not be talking about this right now.Why not?he asked.I always talk about my stuff.Talk about your stuff.There is not much stuff.I mean, I stayed in a relationship for far longer than I should have, because...because I didnt know what other relationship I would ever have.There wasnt one I wanted to be in more.At least, not one I could have.And he...he likes to be taken care of.He needed it.And that made me feel needed.And when I feel needed I feel secure.At least, I did.Because if someone needs me they cant get rid of me.And dammit, I should have wanted to get rid of him.Instead, he left me.And he took my truck and ruined my credit.Because I am a pushover who put up with a whiny baby of a boyfriend who was really bad in bed.Im better in bed than he is, right?On riverbank, against barn wall.And I really shouldnt prop up your ego like this.She pointed her finger at him, and he reached out and grabbed it, tugging her close and nipping the tip.Her eyes widened.You bit me.And you liked it, he said, smiling.He liked this.The intensity, followed by talking, and then something fun, funny.It was all the pieces of his relationship with Liss coming together and making something that he hadnt even known could exist.Fine, she said, leaning forward and kissing him.I liked it.Yeah, you did, he said, kissing her back.Never settle.I mean it.I wont.He cupped her chin and angled his head, kissing her deeper, longer.He could drown in this, in her, and be happy with that.The sound of the door opening caused him and Liss to break apart, jumping back as though theyd had cold water thrown on them.Jack was standing there, a woman Connor couldnt name standing with him, both their eyes wide.Hi, Jack said, looking between Connor and Liss.What the hell are you doing here?Connor asked, the question coming out a little bit harsher than hed intended.But seriously, what the hell was he doing here?I. ..He indicated the woman standing next to him.I think we had the same idea.Jack, the woman said, Im going to go.No, dont go, Jack said, with very little conviction to the words.I didnt realize we would have an audience.And with that she turned on her heel and walked back down the path.Jack, Liss said, her voice small.Dont you need to go after your...No.Shell be fine.I dont even know her name.So this is where I say what the hell?He turned his focus entirely onto the two of them.There is no hell to what the, Connor said, clenching his teeth.You didnt see anything.Fine, Jack said.Im only one of your best friends, and I wouldve thought we could talk like adults.There is nothing to talk about, Connor said, his throat closing down tight.No one was supposed to know about this.Because once people knew about it, they would have to call it something.Because as Jack was proving, they would have questions.And he didnt know what to call it.He didnt know what to do with it.He wasnt ready for this.* * * LISS FELT AS THOUGH the entire scene before her was playing out in slow motion.She was still dazed from the orgasm Connor had given her, still feeling a buzz from the words hed spoken to her.From the feeling of closeness that was warming her heart even now.And now this.Jack had seen them.And Connor was flipping out.The warmth in her heart was fading now.And if you say anything to anyone, especially to Eli or Kate...Are you threatening me?Jack asked, his tone incredulous.Frankly, Liss felt a little bit incredulous.Just dont say anything, Connor said.Would it be that bad?Liss asked, her voice shaking.She knew she shouldnt be doing this here, knew she shouldnt be doing this now, in front of Jack, but it seemed like they were.Would it be the worst thing in the world if everybody knew?Knew what?Connor asked.That you and I had sex?How is that his business?He gestured to Jack.How is that anyones business?Its more than that, she said, her throat tightening.He shook his head.Its not.Somehow, I think this isnt a conversation that needs to involve me, Jack said, turning.Then he stopped and faced Connor again.Connor, Im really glad you stopped drinking.Maybe also try to stop being such an asshole to people who care about you.And I dont mean me.But if you could make an attempt to not fuck up the best you have?Yeah, that would be good.Thats your next step.And then Jack turned and walked out of the barn.Leaving Liss with Connor.Leaving Liss with her heart racing, her head spinning and her throat aching.A pain that was spreading, expanding down to her chest.This was it.And she knew it.She didnt want it to be the end.So thats it?Its not anything more than us having sex?Its complicated.No, its not.Not for me.She knew she would regret this.She regretted it already.But she had to say it, anyway.As far as Im concerned there isnt anything complicated about this.I love you, Connor.Dont, he said.Please, dont do this, Liss.I will do it.Because Ive spent years not doing it.Connor, I. ..Ive wanted you forever.And Ive been too afraid to have you.And Im tired of being afraid.You just told me not to settle, well, Im not settling.Im not settling for friendship when what I want is everything.I gave everything once.I cant give it again.Not to you.Not anyone, he said, the fear that was lacing his voice real, visceral.And she cared.Cared about what hed been through, how it had affected him.But she also knew that he couldnt live in it forever.That couldnt be the beginning and end of him.Just like this couldnt be the beginning and end of them.I understand.I understand what youve been through.And I understand that its hard.But, Connor, you cant...Do not tell me that you understand.Because you dont.Nobody does.Connor...No.Who did you love that you lost?You, dumb ass.When you fell for someone else.When you married someone else.Somebody that I also loved.And so I put it aside.Because thats what friends do.Because I would never ever have done anything to come between you and Jessie.I let it go when I had to.I sat on our swingit was our swing to meand I cried like I would never see you again.Then I lost you again, when she died and you fell into a bottle.I have lost you over and over again.I know what it means.She took a shuddering breath, trying to hold back her tears.But I dont have to let it go now.I wasnt ready for you then, anyway.All I was ready for was half ass declarations and a comfortable relationship.I loved the idea of you, but I never had the courage to do anything about it.But I do now.You know, they say timing is a bitch.And yeah, it kind of has been in the situation.The one time I thought I was ready to change our relationship, you proposed to someone else.And then I moved on.And then life...I dont want you to misunderstand and think that somehow your marriage ending like it did was something I was waiting for or something that I wanted.I respected the fact that you married her.I moved on.I never wished anything...I know, he said, the words tight.I needed you to know that, though.Just like I need you to know that Ive had feelings for you for a long time.And that I love you now.I cant do this.Please dont make me do this.She wasnt sure what he meant.If he meant love, or if he meant ending what they had.She didnt want to end it.But shed realized in a blinding flash when hed said all that to Jack, that she was doing the same thing she always did.Taking care of him, seeing to his needs and crushing what she wanted underneath that.So that she could have a piece of him, when what she wanted was all of him.She hated this.Hated watching it crumble around her.But what the hell else could she do?Live the rest of her life loving him like this, knowing what it was like to be with him, but never being able to have him in the way that she wanted?Because sex wasnt enough.Sex and friendship wasnt enough.She loved him.A real, all consuming kind of love that didnt want fences or division.Yes, she was his friend.But she could never be his friend in the way she had been before.Come to that, she didnt want to be.Im not making you do anything, she said, feeling weary down to her bones.This is just whats happening.No, he said, the word intense, shaking.I am tired of things just happening.I have choices, dammit.I am not choosing this.I want things to stay the same.They cant, she said, her throat getting so tight she could hardly speak.Because they arent.Damn you, Liss.He shook his head and took a step back from her.Ive lost too much.Please dont make me lose you, too.You have to make a choice.If you lose me, its because you are choosing to lose me.Because youre too afraid to He cut her off.Im not choosing to lose you.You are changing the rules.Youre supposed to be my friend.I am your friend, she said.But I cant ignore the rest of what I feel.Not even for you.He closed the space between them and wrapped his arm around her waist, pulling her against him, his expression intense.What is it you want?She blinked back tears, her heart beating so hard she was afraid the fragile thing would crack against her breastbone.I want...Connor swore and reached into his pocket, pulling out his cell phone.I have a text, he growled.Eli proposed.They need us to come back?Yeah, he said, putting his phone back into his pocket.Great.She tried to smile, but she was pretty sure she lost the ability to force the corners of her mouth to curve up.She followed him out of the barn, keeping a heavy distance, her heart pounding dully in her ears as they approached the lights and the revelry that they had left behind only forty five minutes ago.How had they gone from that wonderful, intense moment, when he had taken her up against the barn, shaking, to this?How had it all fallen down so quickly?Nothing had caught on fire tonight, but something had been destroyed nonetheless.She worked as hard as she could to force a smile as they walked through a knot of people and into the barn, where Sadie was grinning from ear to ear, holding her hand out, showing her ring off to everyone around them.Kates face was flushed, joy radiating from her.Even Jack looked happy.And Eli...Well, the man had become sheriff and gotten engaged to be married in the same evening.He was reserved, always had been, but right now he was grinning so hard she thought his face might break.She needed to say congratulations.She needed to be happy for them.But she wasnt.Because she wanted that.She wanted to be engaged to Connor.She wanted to marry Connor.She couldnt spend the rest of her life in a halfway point between being friends and lovers.She couldnt spend the rest of her life being an employee to her relationships.Working hard, waiting for her reward to be given to her, waiting for a good progress report.Hoping she had done well enough to keep the job.Connor was right.She had to want more.And it had to start with him, because it was the hardest place to start.Of all of the people in her life, she needed him most, and losing him scared her more than anything.But what she wanted mattered.She couldnt give the rest of her life in the service of buying him groceries, having sex with him when he needed sex, being a friend when he needed a friend.Not when she needed more.Isnt it beautiful?Kate asked, gesturing to Sadies ring.Kate looked all dreamy and wistful all of a sudden, which was unusual for her.Yes, Liss said, knowing her answer sounded as forced as it felt.Sadie moved closer to Liss and Kate.He had a whole little private alcove all set up with more Mason jars and candles and Christmas lights.It was all golden and glowing, and private and perfect.And then everyone was here so we got to announce it right away.She was beaming, for happiness brighter than any of the lights strung up in the trees.And I really want both of you to be in the wedding, Sadie said.Lisss face burned.She sincerely doubted she would be invited to the wedding after all of this finished between Connor and herself.Just the thought made her chest seize up, made it impossible to breathe.And at the same time, seeing this, knowing there would be a wedding, it solidified in her what she had to do.It solidified what she wanted.And she knew that no matter how much it would suck, her decision had been made.Ive never been in a wedding, Kate said, looking as if shed been given a particularly good Christmas gift.Youll have to wear a dress, Sadie said.Kates smile dimmed a little bit.You sure I cant be a groomsman?I promise to keep ruffles to a minimum.Youre going to have to keep ruffles at a zero count.I do not do ruffles.We have a while for you to worry about it.I have a feeling the wedding is going to be a monster.The whole town was here for the engagement, so we cant very well exclude them from the wedding.Connor was talking to Eli, wearing a smile that was as forced as her own.And her expression and her heart sank straight down into her stomach, and slid farther down into her toes.She couldnt do this.Not now.Congratulations, she said to Sadie.Well talk more tomorrow, okay?I know there are a lot of people here who want your attention.And Im just...really tired.Sadie looked concerned but didnt say anything.Liss forced one more feeble attempt at looking happy before turning and walking out of the barn.She let out a hard breath, one that verged on a sob.She didnt know how she was going to get through this.She didnt know how she was going to survive when she was sure that her heart was going to be crushed in Connors hand, squished into a useless, lifeless nothing.And she would be left walking around with a vacant spot in her chest where it was supposed to be.She walked up the steps and into the house, slamming the door closed behind her.She should pack.Because she had no doubt this would end in her leaving.It would have to.But instead, she flung open one of the cabinets and pulled out her favorite mug.She went over to the tap and filled it with water then put it in the microwave, pulling it out when it was hot and putting in a tea bag.A totally plebeian way to fix a cup of tea, but as a diversionary tactic, it worked.She heard the front door open and slam shut, followed by footsteps.What are you doing?Connor asked from his position in the kitchen door.What are you doing?She tied the string on her tea bag, dipping it in and out of the water.Shouldnt you be off celebrating with your brother?Unsurprisingly, Liss, I am not in a celebratory mood.Unsurprising because you never are?Unsurprising because my best friend has suddenly decided she wants to destroy eighteen years worth of a relationship.No, she said, slamming her mug down on the counter and sloshing hot liquid over the side.Your best friend wants you to pull your head out of your ass and offer her something better than occasional sex and being your grocery monkey.Now whos being an asshole?he asked, his expression thunderous.You know youre more to me than that.Dont pretend you havent noticed.To pretend I havent shown you.But that does not mean Im ready for...What?What exactly did I ask you for?I just told you I loved you.I didnt go making demands.You want a relationship.Yeah, imagine that, I want a relationship with a man Im sharing my body and soul with.What a monster.How dare I.  Stop.Youre the one reducing it so you can try to strengthen your point.Am I?Because youre the one who freaked out because Jack caught us kissing.Youre the one who threatened your friend.Because people finding out about us was somehow the worst thing in the world to you.Im not ready to share it.Why?Because then we have to call it something.And I dont know what to call it.She put a hand over her eyes and scrubbed it down her face.And were back to this.Because I do know what to call it.I dont want to have to say this, he said, looking away, a muscle in his jaw twitching.Youre making me say it.All of her energy, all of her anger, drained out of her, leaving her feeling deflated.Exhausted.Say it.Just say it, Connor.If theres one perk to the fact that were friends, its that we can be honest with each other.I dont love you.I cant.Not like you mean.Not like you want.There was a small part of her that had been prepared to hear these words from Connor Garrett for the past eighteen years.A small part of her that had always imagined her declaration of love, should she ever have enough courage to make it, would end this way.But there had been a larger part of her, a part of herself she hadnt realized was quite so strong, that believed firmly that he would pull her into his arms and tell her he loved her, too.But that wasnt happening.He wasnt saying it.Shed slept with him.Shared his bed.Shared his body.Listened to his secrets, his pain.She had held him while he cried.And still he wasnt in love with her.And right then and there she knew he never would be.Oh, she said, feeling light headed.I cant.He ran a hand through his hair.I just...Im a shitty husband, anyway.She closed her eyes and shook her head, trying to swallow the lump that had lodged itself in the center of her throat.Dont.What?Dont try to make me feel better with stupid crap like that.I know you, Connor Garrett.You are never going to convince me that I could love a better man.Hell, if it were that easy for me to love someone else, I would have done it by now.But I didnt love Marshall.Its always been you.Stop.Just stop.You should want it all, and Im not that.I am a drunken a tear rolled down her cheek broken jackass who doesnt do anything but worry about himself and his own pain.Ive loved and lost and decided its not worth it.Another tear chased that one, following the same trail the first one had forged.Youre going to find someone who isnt a terrible person like Marshall.And someone who isnt screwed up like me.Dammit, Liss.No tears for me.She scrubbed her hand over her cheek, not able to wipe the tears away fast enough.Ill cry for you if I damn well please.Ive been crying for you for years.On your wedding day...Oh, Connor, I cried like I would break.Liss...This isnt new.And it isnt going to fade.Im not the man you should be feeling this for.I dont deserve it, baby.Just...dont.Liss crossed her arms beneath her breasts.Oh, thank you, Connor.Could you make all of my life decisions for me?Thats what friends are for, he said, his voice rough.Thats another thing.I cant do this.Not like this.You have to understand that things are not going back to the way they were before we were sleeping together just because you have made a blanket statement about how you wont fall in love with me.Thats bullshit.That is not what we agreed on.She laughed, the sound completely out of place in the conversation and setting.Well, thats too damn bad.I cant believe you.I cant believe this all or nothing crap youre throwing at me.You dont understand, Connor.She was shouting now, and she didnt care.Im not choosing to do this to you.But my feelings have changed, and what you mean to me has changed.I spent a long time pushing those feelings down.I even let them go for a while.Because I had to.And then this happened.And I really thought that I could do this, and I wouldnt fall in love with you, and that I wouldnt need more.I really did believe it would be enough.But it isnt.Im not demanding a change.The change happened.It happened in me, and if I went back...Connor, my heart would break every day.Liss, if you leave me...You dont love me.How bad could it hurt?She picked up her mug and turned away from him.Another tear slid down her cheek.Youre important to me, he said.Its not enough.She started to walk out of the room.Are you fucking kidding me?he asked.Youre going to leave me?After everything?After everything Ive lost?You promised you wouldnt leave me.You promised me, he said, shouting now.She turned back to face him.Im not a Band Aid.You cant slap me over what hurts so I can heal you while I get nothing back.Dammit, Connor, I want to do that for you.Dont you understand?But I cant.She let out a long breath.I have a feeling we can go around all night.But if you arent ready to change, there wont be any point.My mind is made up.I know what I want, and if you cant give it to me, then you have to let me go.Because youre going to have to let me heal.She walked out of the kitchen and this time, he didnt follow her.She opened the front door and went outside, running down the steps and through the driveway, down past the old barn.She was at the river before she realized where she was going.The place shed shared all those summer days with him.The place shed wept her heart out for him as shed tried to purge herself of her love for him.One more try, I guess, she said.She walked down toward the bank, and suddenly it hit her what had happened.What she had done.What she had lost.Her knees gave out, her stomach cramping hard.She bent over, sank to the ground, a rock biting into her knee, a sob racking her body.She had lost him.Really lost him.In every version of this scenario in her mind, it had never been this bad.She had imagined him telling her he didnt love her.She had imagined him taking her into his arms.But she had never imagined walking away.Away, not just from the idea of loving him, but away from their friendship.She pushed up from the ground and walked to the edge of the river, to the swing.She reached out and grabbed hold of the rope, pulling it over to the bank.Then she grabbed on tight with both hands and jumped, landing on the round, wooden seat.The momentum carried her out over the water, cool, sweet air moving over her face, through her hair.You were scared, but I told you it would be fun.Connors voice, the first night they were together, rumbled through her like a storm.And you said you had never done it before, but I said you just had to take a chance.And you did, and you screamed and screamed.But in the end, you told me you loved it.I took a chance, she said.I took a chance.But in the end you didnt love me.You screamed and screamed.She closed her eyes and tilted her face into the wind, then she took a deep breath and screamed.Because she hurt all over.Because this was the end.Because she was on their swing.The scream ended on a sob, her whole body shaking hard.This was her last time on the swing.
