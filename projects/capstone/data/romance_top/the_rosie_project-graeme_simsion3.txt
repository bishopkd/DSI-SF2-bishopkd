It was a severe lesson in the dangers of messing with the schedule.Rosie would be paying the after midnight tariff on the taxi.I let Claudia return to sleep.As I picked up the two plates and two glasses to bring them inside, I looked again at the nighttime view of the citythe view I had never seen before even though it had been there all the time.I decided to skip my pre bed aikido routine.And to leave the makeshift table in place.nine   I threw her in as a wild card, said Gene, when I woke him up from the unscheduled sleep he was taking under his desk the next day.Gene looked terrible and I told him he should refrain from staying up so latealthough for once I had been guilty of the same error.It was important that he eat lunch at the correct time to get his circadian rhythm back on schedule.He had a packed lunch from home, and we headed for a grassy area in the university grounds.I collected seaweed salad, miso soup, and an apple from the Japanese caf on the way.It was a fine day.Unfortunately this meant that there were a number of females in brief clothing sitting on the grass and walking by to distract Gene.Gene is fifty six years old, although that information is not supposed to be disclosed.At that age, his testosterone should have fallen to a level where his sex drive was significantly reduced.It is my theory that his unusually high focus on sex is due to mental habit.But human physiology varies, and he may be an exception.Conversely, I think Gene believes I have an abnormally low sex drive.This is not true; rather I am not as skilled as Gene in expressing it in a socially appropriate way.My occasional attempts to imitate Gene have been unsuccessful in the extreme.We found a bench to sit on and Gene commenced his explanation.Shes someone I know, he said.No questionnaire?No questionnaire.This explained the smoking.In fact, it explained everything.Gene had reverted to the inefficient practice of recommending acquaintances for dates.My expression must have conveyed my annoyance.Youre wasting your time with the questionnaire.Youd be better off measuring the length of their earlobes.Sexual attraction is Genes area of expertise.Theres a correlation?I asked.People with long earlobes are more likely to choose partners with long earlobes.Its a better predictor than IQ.This was incredible, but much behavior that developed in the ancestral environment seems incredible when considered in the context of the current world.Evolution has not kept up.But earlobes!Could there be a more irrational basis for a relationship?No wonder marriages fail.So, did you have fun?asked Gene.I informed him that his question was irrelevant: my goal was to find a partner and Rosie was patently unsuitable.Gene had caused me to waste an evening.But did you have fun?he repeated.Did he expect a different answer to the same question?To be fair, I had not given him a proper answer, but for a good reason.I had not had time to reflect on the evening and determine a proper response.I guessed that fun was going to be an oversimplification of a very complex experience.I provided Gene with a summary of events.As I related the story of the dinner on the balcony, Gene interrupted.If you see her again  There is zero reason for me to see her again.If you see her again, Gene continued, its probably not a good idea to mention the Wife Project.Since she didnt measure up.Ignoring the incorrect assumption about seeing Rosie again, this seemed like good advice.At that point, the conversation changed direction dramatically, and I did not have an opportunity to find out how Gene had met Rosie.The reason for the change was Genes sandwich.He took a bite, then called out in pain and snatched my water bottle.Oh shit.Oh shit.Claudia put chilies in my sandwich.It was difficult to see how Claudia could make an error of this kind.But the priority was to reduce the pain.Chili is insoluble in water, so drinking from my bottle would not be effective.I advised him to find some oil.We headed back to the Japanese caf and were not able to have any further conversation about Rosie.However, I had the basic information I needed.Gene had selected a woman without reference to the questionnaire.To see her again would be in total contradiction to the rationale for the Wife Project.Riding home, I reconsidered.I could see three reasons that it might be necessary to see Rosie again.1.Good experimental design requires the use of a control group.It would be interesting to use Rosie as a benchmark to compare with women selected by the questionnaire.2.The questionnaire had not produced any matches to date.I could interact with Rosie in the meantime.3.As a geneticist with access to DNA analysis, and the knowledge to interpret it, I was in a position to help Rosie find her biological father.Reasons 1 and 2 were invalid.Rosie was clearly not a suitable life partner.There was no point in interaction with someone so patently inappropriate.But reason 3 deserved consideration.Using my skills to assist her in a search for important knowledge aligned with my life purpose.I could do it in the time set aside for the Wife Project until a suitable candidate emerged.In order to proceed, I needed to reestablish contact with Rosie.I did not want to tell Gene that I planned to see her again so soon after telling him that the probability of my doing so was zero.Fortunately, I recalled the name of the bar she worked at: the Marquess of Queensbury.There was only one bar of that name, in a back street of an inner suburb.I had already modified the days schedule, canceling my market trip to catch up on the lost sleep.I would purchase a ready made dinner instead.I am sometimes accused of being inflexible, but I think this demonstrates an ability to adapt to even the strangest of circumstances.I arrived at 7:04 p. m.  only to find that the bar did not open until 9:00 p. m.  Incredible.No wonder people make mistakes at work.Would it be full of surgeons and flight controllers, drinking until after midnight before working the same day?I ate dinner at a nearby Indian restaurant.By the time I had worked my way through the banquet and returned to the bar, it was 9:27 p. m.  There was a security official at the door, and I prepared myself for a repeat of the previous night.He examined me carefully, then asked, Do you know what sort of place this is?I am quite familiar with bars, perhaps even more familiar than most people.When I travel to conferences, I generally find a pleasant bar near my hotel and eat and drink there every evening.I replied in the affirmative and entered.I wondered if I had come to the right location.The most obvious characteristic of Rosie was that she was female, and the patrons at the Marquess of Queensbury were without exception male.Many were wearing unusual costumes, and I took a few minutes to examine the range.Two men noted me looking at them and one smiled broadly and nodded.I smiled back.It seemed to be a friendly place.But I was there to find Rosie.I walked to the bar.The two men followed and sat on either side of me.The clean shaven one was wearing a cut off T shirt and clearly spent time at the gym.Steroids could also have been involved.The one with the mustache wore a leather costume and a black cap.I havent seen you here before, said Black Cap.I gave him the simple explanation.I havent been here before.Can I buy you a drink?Youre offering to buy my drink?It was an unusual proposition from a stranger, and I guessed that I would be expected to reciprocate in some way.I think thats what I said, said Black Cap.What can we tempt you with?I told him that the flavor didnt matter, as long as it contained alcohol.As in most social situations, I was nervous.Then Rosie appeared from the other side of the bar, dressed conventionally for her role in a collared black shirt.I was hugely relieved.I had come to the correct place and she was on duty.Black Cap waved to her.He ordered three Budweisers.Then Rosie saw me.Don.Greetings.Rosie looked at us and asked, Are you guys together?Give us a few minutes, said Steroid Man.Rosie said, I think Dons here to see me.Correct.Well, pardon us interrupting your social life with drinks orders, Black Cap said to Rosie.You could use DNA, I said.Rosie clearly didnt follow, owing to lack of context.What?To identify your father.DNA is the obvious approach.Sure, said Rosie.Obvious.Please send me your DNA so I can see if youre my father.Forget it, I was just mouthing off.You could collect it.I wasnt sure how Rosie would respond to the next part of my suggestion.Surreptitiously.Rosie went silent.She was at least considering the idea.Or perhaps wondering whether to report me.Her response supported the first possibility.And whos going to analyze it?Im a geneticist.Youre saying if I got a sample, you could analyze it for me?Trivial, I said.How many samples do we need to test?Probably only one.Ive got a pretty good idea.Hes a family friend.Steroid Man coughed loudly, and Rosie fetched two beers from the refrigerator.Black Cap put a twenty dollar bill on the counter, but Rosie pushed it back and waved them away.I tried the cough trick myself.Rosie took a moment to interpret the message this time, but then got me a beer.What do you need?she asked.To test the DNA?I explained that normally we would use scrapings from the inner cheek, but that it would be impractical to obtain these without the subjects knowledge.Blood is excellent, but skin scrapings, mucus, urine  Pass, said Rosie.fecal material, semen  It keeps getting better, said Rosie.I can screw a sixty year old family friend in the hope that he turns out to be my father.I was shocked.Youd have sex  Rosie explained that she was making a joke.On such a serious matter!It was getting busy around the bar, and there were a lot of cough signals happening.An effective way to spread disease.Rosie wrote a telephone number on a piece of paper.Call me.ten   The next morning, I returned with some relief to the routine that had been so severely disrupted over the preceding two days.My Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday runs to the market are a feature of my schedule, combining exercise, meal ingredients purchase, and an opportunity for reflection.I was in great need of the last of these.A woman had given me her phone number and told me to call her.More than the Jacket Incident, the Balcony Meal, and even the excitement of the potential Father Project, this had disrupted my world.I knew that it happened regularly: people in books, films, and TV shows do exactly what Rosie had done.But it had never happened to me.No woman had ever casually, unthinkingly, automatically, written down her phone number, given it to me, and said, Call me.I had temporarily been included in a culture that I considered closed to me.Although it was entirely logical that Rosie should provide me with a means of contacting her, I had an irrational feeling that, when I called, Rosie would realize that she had made some kind of error.I arrived at the market and commenced purchasing.Because each days ingredients are standard, I know which stalls to visit, and the vendors generally have my items prepackaged in advance.I need only pay.The vendors know me well and are consistently friendly.However, it is not possible to time share major intellectual activity with the purchasing process, owing to the quantity of human and inanimate obstacles: vegetable pieces on the ground, old ladies with shopping carts, vendors still setting up stalls, Asian women comparing prices, goods being delivered, and tourists taking photos of each other in front of the produce.Fortunately I am usually the only jogger.On the way home, I resumed my analysis of the Rosie situation.I realized that my actions had been driven more by instinct than logic.There were plenty of people in need of help, many in more distress than Rosie, and numerous worthy scientific projects that would represent better use of my time than a quest to find one individuals father.And of course, I should be giving priority to the Wife Project.Better to push Gene to select more suitable women from the list, or to relax some of the less important selection criteria, as I had already done with the no drinking rule.The logical decision was to contact Rosie and explain that the Father Project was not a good idea.I phoned at 6:43 a. m.  on returning from the run and left a message for her to call back.When I hung up, I was sweating despite the fact that the morning was still cool.I hoped I wasnt developing a fever.Rosie called back while I was delivering a lecture.Normally, I turn my phone off at such times, but I was anxious to put this problem to bed.I was feeling stressed at the prospect of an interaction in which it was necessary for me to retract an offer.Speaking on the phone in front of a lecture theater full of students was awkward, especially as I was wearing a lapel microphone.They could hear my side of the conversation.Hi, Rosie.Don, I just want to say thanks for doing this thing for me.I didnt realize how much it had been eating me up.Do you know that little coffee shop across from the Commerce BuildingBaristas?How about two oclock tomorrow?Now that Rosie had accepted my offer of help, it would have been immoral, and technically a breach of contract, to withdraw it.Baristas, two p. m.  tomorrow, I confirmed, though I was temporarily unable to access the schedule in my brain because of overload.Youre a star, she said.Her tone indicated that this was the end of her contribution to the conversation.It was my turn to use a standard platitude to reciprocate, and the obvious one was the simple reflection of Youre a star.But even I realized that made no sense.She was the beneficiary of my starness in the form of my genetics expertise.On reflection, I could have just said Good bye or See you, but I had no time for reflection.There was considerable pressure to make a timely response.I like you too.The entire lecture theater exploded in applause.A female student in the front row said, Smooth.She was smiling.Fortunately I am accustomed to creating amusement inadvertently.I did not feel too unhappy at failing to terminate the Father Project.The amount of work involved in one DNA test was trivial.We met at Baristas the next day at 2:07 p. m.  Needless to say, the delay was Rosies fault.My students would be sitting in their 2:15 p. m.  lecture waiting for my arrival.My intention had been only to advise her on the collection of a DNA sample, but she seemed unable to process the instructions.In retrospect, I was probably offering too many options and too much technical detail too rapidly.With only seven minutes to discuss the problem (allowing one minute for running to the lecture), we agreed that the simplest solution was to collect the sample together.We arrived at the residence of Dr.Eamonn Hughes, the suspected father, on the Saturday afternoon.Rosie had telephoned in advance.Eamonn looked older than I had expected.I guessed sixty, BMI twenty three.Eamonns wife, whose name was Belinda (approximately fifty five, BMI twenty eight), made us coffee, as predicted by Rosie.This was critical, as we had decided that the coffee cup rim would be an ideal source of saliva.I sat beside Rosie, pretending to be her friend.Eamonn and Belinda were opposite, and I was finding it hard to keep my eyes away from Eamonns cup.Fortunately, I was not required to make small talk.Eamonn was a cardiologist and we had a fascinating discussion about genetic markers for cardiac disease.Eamonn finally finished his coffee and Rosie stood up to take the cups to the kitchen.There, she would be able to swab the lip of the cup and we would have an excellent sample.When we discussed the plan, I suggested that this would be a breach of social convention, but Rosie assured me that she knew Eamonn and Belinda well as family friends, and as a younger person, she would be allowed to perform this chore.For once, my understanding of social convention proved more accurate.Unfortunately.As Rosie picked up Belindas cup, Belinda said, Leave it, Ill do it later.Rosie responded, No, please, and took Eamonns cup.Belinda picked up my cup and Rosies and said, Okay, give me a hand.They walked out to the kitchen together.It was obviously going to be difficult for Rosie to swab Eamonns cup with Belinda present, but I could not think of a way of getting Belinda out of the kitchen.Did Rosie tell you I studied medicine with her mother?asked Eamonn.I nodded.Had I been a psychologist, I might have been able to infer from Eamonns conversation and body language whether he was hiding the fact that he was Rosies father.I might even have been able to lead the conversation in a direction to trap him.Fortunately we were not relying on my skills in this arena.If Rosie succeeded in collecting the sample, I would be able to provide a far more reliable answer than one derived from observations of behavior.If I can offer you a little encouragement, Eamonn said, Rosies mother was a bit wild in her younger days.Very smart, good looking, she could have had anyone.All the other women in medicine were going to marry doctors.He smiled.But she surprised us all and picked the guy from left field who persisted and stuck around.It was lucky I wasnt looking for clues.My expression must have conveyed my total lack of comprehension.I suspect Rosie may follow in her mothers footsteps, he said.In what component of her life?It seemed safer to seek clarification than assume that he meant getting pregnant by an unknown fellow student or dying.These were the only facts I knew about Rosies mother.Im just saying I think youre probably good for her.And shes had a rough time.Tell me to mind my own business if you like.But shes a great kid.Now the intent of the conversation was clear, although Rosie was surely too old to be referred to as a kid.Eamonn thought I was Rosies boyfriend.It was an understandable error.Correcting it would necessarily involve telling a lie, so I decided to remain silent.Then we heard the sound of breaking crockery.Eamonn called out, Everything okay?Just broke a cup, said Belinda.Breaking the cup was not part of the plan.Presumably, Rosie had dropped it in her nervousness or in trying to keep it from Belinda.I was annoyed at myself for not having a backup plan.I had not treated this project as serious fieldwork.It was embarrassingly unprofessional, and it was now my responsibility to find a solution.It would surely involve deception, and I am not skilled at deception.My best approach was to source the DNA for a legitimate reason.Have you heard about the Genographic Project?No, said Eamonn.I explained that with a sample of his DNA we could trace his distant ancestry.He was fascinated.I offered to have his DNA processed if he organized a cheek scraping and sent it to me.Lets do it now, before I forget, he said.Will blood do?Blood is ideal for DNA testing, but  Im a doctor, he said.Give me a minute.Eamonn left the room, and I could hear Belinda and Rosie speaking in the kitchen.Belinda said, Seen your father at all?Next question, said Rosie.Belinda instead responded with a statement.Don seems nice.Excellent.I was doing well.Just a friend, said Rosie.If she knew how many friends I had, she might have realized what a great compliment she had paid me.Oh well, said Belinda.Rosie and Belinda returned to the living room at the same time as Eamonn with his doctors bag.Belinda reasonably deduced that there was some medical problem, but Eamonn explained about the Genographic Project.Belinda, who was a nurse, took the blood with professional expertise.As I handed the filled tube to Rosie to put in her handbag, I noticed her hands were shaking.I diagnosed anxiety, presumably related to the imminent confirmation of her paternity.I was not surprised when she asked, only seconds after leaving the Hughess residence, if we could process the DNA sample immediately.It would require opening the lab on a Saturday evening but at least the project would be completed.The laboratory was empty: throughout the university, the archaic idea of working Monday to Friday results in an incredible underutilization of expensive facilities.The university was trialing analysis equipment that could test for parent child relationships very quickly.And we had an ideal DNA sample.It is possible to extract DNA from a wide variety of sources and only a few cells are needed for an analysis, but the preparatory work can be time consuming and complex.Blood was easy.The new machine was located in a small room that had once been a tearoom with sink and refrigerator.For a moment I wished it had been more impressivean unusual intrusion of ego into my thoughts.I unlocked the refrigerator and opened a beer.Rosie coughed loudly.I recognized the code and opened one for her also.I tried to explain the process to Rosie as I set up, but she seemed unable to stop talking, even as she used the scraper on her inner cheek to provide me with her DNA sample.I cant believe its this easy.This quick.I think Ive always known at some level.He used to bring me stuff when I was a kid.Its a vastly overspecified machine for such a trivial task.One time he brought me a chess set.Phil gave me girly stuffjewelry boxes and shit.Pretty weird for a personal trainer when you think about it.You play chess?I asked.Not really.Thats not the point.He respected that I have a brain.He and Belinda never had any kids of their own.I have a sense that he was always around.He might even have been my mums best friend.But Ive never consciously thought of him as my father.Hes not, I said.The result had come up on the computer screen.Job complete.I began packing up.Wow, said Rosie.Ever thought of being a grief counselor?No.I considered a number of careers, but all in the sciences.My interpersonal skills are not strong.Rosie burst out laughing.Youre about to get a crash course in advanced grief counseling.It turned out that Rosie was making a sort of joke, as her approach to grief counseling was based entirely on the administration of alcohol.We went to Jimmy Watsons on Lygon Street, a short walk away, and as usual, even on a weekend, it was full of academics.We sat at the bar, and I was surprised to find that Rosie, a professional server of drinks, had a very poor knowledge of wine.A few years ago Gene had suggested that wine was the perfect topic for safe conversation and I did some research.I was familiar with the backgrounds of the wines offered regularly at this bar.We drank quite a lot.Rosie had to go outside for a few minutes because of her nicotine addiction.The timing was fortunate, as a couple emerged from the courtyard and passed the bar.The man was Gene!The woman was not Claudia, but I recognized her.It was Olivia, the Indian vegetarian from Table for Eight.Neither saw me, and they went past too quickly for me to say anything.My confusion at seeing them together must have contributed to my next decision.A waiter came up to me and said, Theres a table for two thats just come free in the courtyard.Are you eating with us?I nodded.I would have to freeze the days market purchases for the following Saturday, with the resulting loss of nutrients.Instinct had again displaced logic.Rosies reaction to finding a table being set for us on her return appeared to be positive.Doubtless she was hungry, but it was reassuring to know that I had not committed a faux pas, always more likely when different genders are involved.The food was excellent.We had freshly shucked oysters (sustainable), tuna sashimi (selected by Rosie and probably not sustainable), eggplant and mozzarella stack (Rosie), veal sweetbreads (me), cheese (shared), and a single serving of passion fruit mousse (divided and shared).I ordered a bottle of Marsanne and it was an excellent accompaniment.Rosie spent much of the meal trying to explain why she wanted to locate her biological father.I could see little reason for it.In the past, the knowledge might have been useful to determine the risk of genetically influenced diseases, but today Rosie could have her own DNA analyzed directly.Practically, her stepfather Phil seemed to have executed the father role, although Rosie had numerous complaints about his performance.He was an egotist; he was inconsistent in his attitude toward her; he was subject to mood swings.He was also strongly opposed to alcohol.I considered this to be a thoroughly defensible position, but it was a cause of friction between them.Rosies motivation seemed to be emotional, and while I could not understand the psychology, it was clearly very important to her happiness.After Rosie had finished her mousse, she left the table to go to the bathroom.It gave me time to reflect and I realized that I was in the process of completing a noneventful and in fact highly enjoyable dinner with a woman, a significant achievement that I was looking forward to sharing with Gene and Claudia.I concluded that the lack of problems was due to three factors.1.I was in a familiar restaurant.It had never occurred to me to take a womanor indeed anyoneto Jimmy Watsons, which I had only previously used as a source of wine.2.Rosie was not a date.I had rejected her, comprehensively, as a potential partner, and we were together because of a joint project.It was like a meeting.3.I was somewhat intoxicatedhence relaxed.As a result, I may also have been unaware of any social errors.At the end of the meal, I ordered two glasses of sambuca and said, Who do we test next?eleven   Besides Eamonn Hughes, Rosie knew of only two other family friends from her mothers medical graduation class.It struck me as unlikely that someone who had illicit sex with her mother would remain in contact, given the presence of Phil.But there was an evolutionary argument that he would wish to ensure that the carrier of his genes was receiving proper care.Essentially this was Rosies argument also.The first candidate was Dr.Peter Enticott, who lived locally.The other, Alan McPhee, had died from prostate cancer, which was good news for Rosie, as, lacking a prostate gland, she could not inherit it.Apparently he had been an oncologist but had not detected the cancer in himself, a not uncommon scenario.Humans often fail to see what is close to them and obvious to others.Fortunately, he had a daughter, with whom Rosie had socialized when she was younger.Rosie arranged a meeting with Natalie in three days time, ostensibly to view Natalies newborn baby.I reverted to the normal schedule, but the Father Project kept intruding into my thoughts.I prepared for the DNA collection; I did not want a repeat of the broken cup problem.I also had another altercation with the Dean, as a result of the Flounder Incident.One of my tasks is to teach genetics to medical students.In the first class of the previous semester, a student, who did not identify himself, had raised his hand shortly after I showed my first slide.The slide is a brilliant and beautiful diagrammatic summary of evolution from single cell organisms to todays incredible variety of life.Only my colleagues in the Physics Department can match the extraordinary story that it tells.I cannot comprehend why some people are more interested in the outcome of a football match or the weight of an actress.This student belonged to another category.Professor Tillman, you used the word evolved.Correct.I think you should point out that evolution is just a theory.This was not the first time I had received a questionor statementof this kind.I knew from experience that I would not sway the students views, which would inevitably be based on religious dogma.I could only ensure that the student was not taken seriously by other trainee doctors.Correct, I replied, but your use of the word just is misleading.Evolution is a theory supported by overwhelming evidence.Like the germ theory of disease, for example.As a doctor, you will be expected to rely on science.Unless you want to be a faith healer.In which case you are in the wrong course.There was some laughter.Faith Healer objected.Im not talking about faith.Im talking about creation science.There were only a few moans from the class.No doubt many of the students were from cultures where criticism of religion is not well tolerated.Such as ours.I had been forbidden to comment on religion after an earlier incident.But we were discussing science.I could have continued the argument, but I knew better than to be sidetracked by a student.My lectures are precisely timed to fit within fifty minutes.Evolution is a theory, I said.There is no other theory of the origins of life with wide acceptance by scientists or of any utility to medicine.Hence we will assume it in this class.I believed I had handled the situation well, but I was annoyed that time had been insufficient to argue the case against the pseudoscience of creationism.Some weeks later, eating in the University Club, I found a means of making the point succinctly.As I walked to the bar, I noticed one of the members eating a flounder, with its head still in place.After a slightly awkward conversation, I obtained the head and skeleton, which I wrapped and stored in my backpack.Four days later, I had the class.I located Faith Healer and asked him a preliminary question.Do you believe that fish were created in their current forms by an intelligent designer?He seemed surprised at the question, perhaps because it had been seven weeks since we had suspended the discussion.But he nodded in agreement.I unwrapped the flounder.It had acquired a strong smell, but medical students should be prepared to deal with unpleasant organic objects in the interests of learning.I indicated the head: Observe that the eyes are not symmetrical.In fact the eyes had decomposed, but the location of the eye sockets was quite clear.This is because the flounder evolved from a conventional fish with eyes on opposite sides of the head.One eye slowly migrated around, but just far enough to function effectively.Evolution did not bother to tidy up.But surely an intelligent designer would not have created a fish with this imperfection.I gave Faith Healer the fish to enable him to examine it and continued the lecture.He waited until the beginning of the new teaching year to lodge his complaint.In my discussion with the Dean, she implied that I had tried to humiliate Faith Healer, whereas my intent had been to advance an argument.Since he had used the term creation science, with no mention of religion, I made the case that I was not guilty of denigrating religion.I was merely contrasting one theory with another.He was welcome to bring counterexamples to class.Don, she said, as usual you havent technically broken any rules.Buthow can I put it?if someone told me that a lecturer had brought a dead fish to class and given it to a student who had made a statement of religious faith, I would guess that the lecturer was you.Do you understand where Im coming from?Youre saying that I am the person in the faculty most likely to act unconventionally.And you want me to act more conventionally.That seems an unreasonable request to make of a scientist.I just dont want you to upset people.Being upset and complaining because your theory is disproven is unscientific.The argument ended, once again, with the Deans being unhappy with me, though I had not broken any rules, and my being reminded that I needed to try harder to fit in.As I left her office, her personal assistant, Regina, stopped me.I dont think I have you down for the faculty ball yet, Professor Tillman.I think youre the only professor who hasnt bought tickets.Riding home, I was aware of a tightness in my chest and realized it was a physical response to the Deans advice.I knew that if I could not fit in in a science department of a university, I could not fit in anywhere.Natalie McPhee, daughter of the late Dr.Alan McPhee, potential biological father of Rosie, lived eighteen kilometers from the city, within riding distance, but Rosie decided we should travel by car.I was amazed to find that she drove a red Porsche convertible.Its Phils.Your fathers?I did the air quotes.Yeah, hes in Thailand.I thought he didnt like you.But he lent you his car?Thats the sort of thing he does.No love, just stuff.The Porsche would be the perfect vehicle to lend to someone you did not like.It was seventeen years old (thus using old emissions technology), had appalling fuel economy, little leg room, high wind noise, and a nonfunctioning air conditioning system.Rosie confirmed my guess that it was unreliable and expensive to maintain.As we arrived at Natalies, I realized I had spent the entire journey listing and elaborating on the deficiencies of the vehicle.I had avoided small talk but had not briefed Rosie on the DNA collection method.Your task is to occupy her in conversation while I collect DNA.This would make best use of our respective skills.It soon became clear that my backup plan would be necessary.Natalie did not want to drink: she was abstaining from alcohol while breast feeding her baby, and it was too late for coffee.These were responsible choices, but we would not be able to swab a cup or glass.I deployed Plan B.   Can I see the baby?Hes asleep, she said, so youll have to be quiet.I stood up and so did she.Just tell me where to go, I said.Ill come with you.The more I insisted that I wanted to see the baby alone, the more she objected.We went to its room, and as she had predicted, it was sleeping.This was very annoying, as I had a number of plans that involved collecting DNA in a totally noninvasive way from the baby, who was, of course, also related to Alan McPhee.Unfortunately I had not factored in the mothers protective instinct.Every time I found a reason to leave the room, Natalie followed me.It was very awkward.Finally, Rosie excused herself to go to the bathroom.Even if she had known what to do, she could not have visited the baby, as Natalie had positioned herself so that she could see the bedroom door and was checking frequently.Have you heard about the Genographic Project?I asked.She hadnt and was not interested.She changed the topic.You seem very interested in babies.There was surely an opportunity here if I could find a way to exploit it.Im interested in their behavior.Without the corrupting influence of a parent present.She looked at me strangely.Do you do any stuff with kids?I mean Scouts, church groups ...No, I said.Its unlikely that Id be suitable.Rosie returned and the baby started crying.Feeding time, said Natalie.We should be going, said Rosie.Failure!Social skills had been the problem.With good social skills I could surely have gotten to the baby.Im sorry, I said, as we walked to Phils ridiculous vehicle.Dont be.Rosie reached into her handbag and pulled out a wad of hair.I cleaned her hairbrush for her.We need roots, I said.But there was a lot of hair, so it was likely we would find a strand with its root attached.She reached into her bag again and retrieved a toothbrush.It took me a few moments to realize what this meant.You stole her toothbrush!There was a spare in the cupboard.It was time for a new one.I was shocked at the theft, but we would now almost certainly have a usable sample of DNA.It was difficult not to be impressed by Rosies resourcefulness.And if Natalie was not replacing her toothbrush at regular intervals, Rosie had done her a favor.Rosie did not want to analyze the hair or toothbrush immediately.She wanted to collect DNA from the final candidate and test the two samples together.This struck me as illogical.If Natalies sample was a match, we would not need to collect further DNA.However, Rosie did not seem to grasp the concept of sequencing tasks to minimize cost and risk.After the problem with the baby access, we decided to collaborate on the most appropriate approach for Dr.Peter Enticott.Ill tell him Im thinking about studying medicine, she said.Dr.Enticott was now on the medical faculty at Deakin University.She would arrange to meet him over coffee, which would provide an opportunity to use the coffee cup swab procedure that currently had a one hundred percent failure rate.I thought it unlikely that a barmaid could convince a professor that she had the credentials to study medicine.Rosie seemed insulted by this and argued that it did not matter in any case.We only had to persuade him to have a drink with us.A bigger problem was how to present me, as Rosie did not think she could do the job alone.Youre my boyfriend, she said.Youll be financing my studies, so youre a stakeholder.She looked at me hard.You dont need to overplay it.On a Wednesday afternoon, with Gene covering a lecture for me in return for the Aspergers night, we traveled in Phils toy car to Deakin University.I had been there many times before for guest lectures and collaborative research.I even knew some researchers in the Medical Faculty, though not Peter Enticott.We met him at an outdoor caf crowded with medical students back early from the summer break.Rosie was amazing!She spoke intelligently about medicine and even psychiatry, in which she said she hoped to specialize.She claimed to have an honors degree in behavioral science and postgraduate research experience.Peter seemed obsessed with the resemblance between Rosie and her mother, which was irrelevant for our purposes.Three times he interrupted Rosie to remind her of their physical similarity, and I wondered if this might indicate some particular bond between him and Rosies motherand hence be a predictor of paternity.I looked, as I had done in Eamonn Hughess living room, for any physical similarities between Rosie and her potential father but could see nothing obvious.That all sounds very positive, Rosie, said Peter.I dont have anything to do with the selection processat least officially.His wording appeared to imply the possibility of unofficial, and hence unethical, assistance.Was this a sign of nepotism and thus a clue that he was Rosies father?Your academic background is fine, but youll have to do the GAMSAT.Peter turned to me.The standard admission test for the MD program.I did it last year, said Rosie.I got seventy four.Peter looked hugely impressed.You can walk into Harvard with that score.But we take other factors into account here, so if you do decide to apply, make sure you let me know.I hoped he never went for a drink at the Marquess of Queensbury.A waiter brought the bill.As he went to take Peters cup, I automatically put my hand on it to stop him.The waiter looked at me extremely unpleasantly and snatched it away.I watched as he took it to a cart and added it to a tray of crockery.Peter looked at his phone.I have to go, he said.But now that youve made contact, stay in touch.As Peter left, I could see the waiter looking toward the cart.You need to distract him, I said.Just get the cup, said Rosie.I walked toward the cart.The waiter was watching me, but just as I reached the tray, he snapped his head in Rosies direction and began walking quickly toward her.I grabbed the cup.We met at the car, which was parked some distance away.The walk gave me time to process the fact that I had, under pressure to achieve a goal, been guilty of theft.Should I send a check to the caf?What was a cup worth?Cups were broken all the time, but by random events.If everyone stole cups, the caf would probably become financially nonviable.Did you get the cup?I held it up.Is it the right one?she said.I am not good at nonverbal communication, but I believe I managed to convey the fact that while I might be a petty thief, I do not make errors of observation.Did you pay the bill?I asked.Thats how I distracted him.By paying the bill?No, you pay at the counter.I just took off.We have to go back.Fuck em, said Rosie, as we climbed into the Porsche and sped off.What was happening to me?twelve   We drove toward the university and the lab.The Father Project would soon be over.The weather was warm, though there were dark clouds on the horizon, and Rosie lowered the convertible roof.I was mulling over the theft.You still obsessing about the bill, Don?Rosie shouted over the wind noise.Youre hilarious.Were stealing DNA, and youre worried about a cup of coffee.Its not illegal to take DNA samples, I shouted back.This was true, although in the UK we would have been in violation of the Human Tissue Act of 2004.We should go back.Highly inefficient use of time, said Rosie in a strange voice, as we pulled up at traffic lights and were briefly able to communicate properly.She laughed and I realized she had been imitating me.Her statement was correct, but there was a moral question involved, and acting morally should override other issues.Relax, she said.Its a beautiful day, were going to find out who my father is, and Ill put a check in the mail for the coffee.Promise.She looked at me.Do you know how to relax?How to just have fun?It was too complex a question to answer over the wind noise as we pulled away from the lights.And the pursuit of fun does not lead to overall contentment.Studies have shown this consistently.You missed the exit, I said.Correct, she replied, in the joke voice.Were going to the beach.She spoke right over the top of my protests.Cant hear you, cant hear you.Then she put on some musicvery loud rock music.Now she really couldnt hear me.I was being kidnapped!We drove for ninety four minutes.I could not see the speedometer and was not accustomed to traveling in an open vehicle, but I estimated that we were consistently exceeding the speed limit.Discordant sound, wind, risk of deathI tried to assume the mental state that I used at the dentist.Finally, we stopped in a beachside parking lot.It was almost empty on a weekday afternoon.Rosie looked at me.Smile.Were going for a walk, then were going to the lab, and then Im going to take you home.And youll never see me again.Cant we just go home now?I said, and realized that I sounded like a child.I reminded myself that I was an adult male, ten years older and more experienced than the person with me, and that there must be a purpose for what she was doing.I asked what it was.Im about to find out who my dad is.I need to clear my head.So can we walk for half an hour or so, and can you just pretend to be a regular human being and listen to me?I was not sure how well I could imitate a regular human being, but I agreed to the walk.It was obvious that Rosie was confused by emotions, and I respected her attempt to overcome them.As it turned out, she hardly spoke at all.This made the walk quite pleasant: it was virtually the same as walking alone.As we approached the car on our return, Rosie asked, What music do you like?Why?You didnt like what I was playing on the drive down, did you?Correct.So, your turn going back.But I dont have any Bach.I dont really listen to music, I said.The Bach was an experiment that didnt work.You cant go through life not listening to music.I just dont pay it any attention.I prefer to listen to information.There was a long silence.We had reached the car.Did your parents listen to music?Brothers and sisters?My parents listened to rock music.Primarily my father.From the era in which he was young.We got in the car and Rosie lowered the roof again.She played with her iPhone, which she was using as the music source.Blast from the past, she said, and activated the music.I was just settling into the dentists chair again when I realized the accuracy of Rosies words.I knew this music.It had been in the background when I was growing up.I was suddenly taken back to my room, door closed, writing in BASIC on my early generation computer, the song in the background.I know this song!Rosie laughed.If you didnt, thatd be the final proof that youre from Mars.Hurtling back to town, in a red Porsche driven by a beautiful woman, with the song playing, I had the sense of standing on the brink of another world.I recognized the feeling, which, if anything, became stronger as the rain started falling and the convertible roof malfunctioned so we were unable to raise it.It was the same feeling that I had experienced looking over the city after the Balcony Meal, and again after Rosie had written down her phone number.Another world, another life, proximate but inaccessible.The elusive ...Sat is fac tion.It was dark when we arrived back at the university.We were both wet.With the aid of the instruction manual, I was able to close the car roof manually.In the lab, I opened two beers (no cough signal required) and Rosie tapped her bottle against mine.Cheers, she said.Well done.You promise to send a check to the caf?Whatever.Promise.Good.You were brilliant, I said.I had been meaning to convey this for some time.Rosies performance as an aspiring medical student had been very impressive.But why did you claim such a high score on the medical admission test?Why do you think?I explained that if I could have deduced the answer, I would not have asked.Because I didnt want to look stupid.To your potential father?
