Stay away from my brother, Eva.Why?Because I said so.My temper ignited, which felt good after all the self recrimination and doubts Id been drowning in since wed screwed like feral bunnies.I decided to see if turnabout was fair play in Gideon Crosss world.Stay away from Magdalene, Gideon.His jaw tightened.Shes just a friend.Meaning you havent slept with her?Yet.No, damn it.And I dont want to.Listen  The music wound down and he slowed.I have to go.I brought you here, and I would prefer to be the one who takes you home, but I dont want to pull you away if youre enjoying yourself.Would you rather stick around and go home with Stanton and your mother?Enjoying myself?Was he kidding or clueless?Or worse.Maybe hed written me off so completely that he wasnt paying attention to me at all.I pushed away from him, needing the distance.His scent was messing with my head.Ill be fine.Forget about me.Eva.He reached for me and I stepped back quickly.An arm came around my back and Cary spoke.Ive got her, Cross.Dont get in my way, Taylor, Gideon warned.Cary snorted.I get the impression youre doing a smokin job of that all by yourself.I swallowed past the lump in my throat.You gave a wonderful speech, Gideon.It was the highlight of my evening.He sucked in a sharp breath at the implied insult; then shoved a hand through his hair.Abruptly, he cursed and I realized why when he pulled his vibrating phone out of his pocket and glanced at the screen.I have to go.His gaze caught mine and held it.His fingertips drifted over my cheek.Ill call you.And then he was gone.Do you want to stay?Cary asked quietly.No.Ill take you home, then.No, dont.I wanted to be alone for a bit.Soak in a hot bath with a bottle of cool wine and pull myself out of my funk.You should be here.It could be good for your career.We can talk when you get home.Or tomorrow.Im going the couch potato route all day.His gaze darted over my face, searching.You sure?I nodded.All right.But he looked unconvinced.If you could go out and ask a valet to have Stantons limo brought around, Ill run to the ladies room real quick.Okay.Cary ran his hand down my arm.Ill get your shawl from the coatroom and see you out front.It took longer to get to the restroom than it should have.For one, a surprising number of people stopped me for small talk, which had to be because I was Gideon Crosss date.And two, I avoided the nearest ladies room, which had a steady flow of women pouring in and out of it, and I found one located farther away.I locked myself in a stall and took a few moments longer to finish my business than absolutely required.There was no one else in the room besides the attendant, so there was no one to rush me.I was so hurt by Gideon it was hard to breathe and I was so confused by his mood swings.Why had he touched my face like that?Why had he gotten mad when I didnt stay by his side?And why the hell had he threatened Cary?Gideon gave new meaning to the old adage about running hot and cold.Closing my eyes, I shored up my composure.Jesus.I didnt need this.Id bared my emotions in the limo and I still felt horribly vulnerable a state Id spent countless therapy hours learning to avoid.I wanted nothing more than to be home and hidden, freed from the pressure of acting like I was completely pulled together when I was anything but.You set yourself up for this, I reminded myself.Suck it up.Taking a deep breath, I stepped out and was resigned to finding Magdalene leaning against the vanity with her arms crossed.She was clearly there for me, lying in wait at a time when my defenses were already weak.My step faltered; then I recovered and made my way to the sink to wash my hands.She turned to face the mirror, studying my reflection.I studied her, too.She was even more gorgeous in person than shed been in her photos.Tall and slender, with big dark eyes and a cascade of straight brown hair.Her lips were lush and red, her cheekbones high and sculpted.Her dress was modestly sexy, a flowing sheath of creamy satin that contrasted beautifully with her olive skin.She looked like a fucking supermodel and exuded an exotic sex appeal.I accepted the hand towel the bathroom attendant handed me, and Magdalene spoke to the woman in Spanish, asking her to give us some privacy.I capped the request with, Por favor, gracias.That earned me an arched brow from Magdalene and a closer examination, which I returned with equal coolness.Oh, dear, she murmured, the moment the attendant stepped out of earshot.She made a tsking noise that scraped over my nerves like nails on a chalkboard.Youve fucked him already.And you havent.That seemed to surprise her.Youre right, I havent.You know why?I pulled a five spot out of my clutch and dropped it in the silver tip tray.Because he doesnt want to.And I dont want to either, because he cant commit.Hes young, gorgeous, rich, and hes enjoying it.Yes.I nodded.He certainly did.Her gaze narrowed, her pleasant expression slipping slightly.He doesnt respect the women he fucks.The minute he shoved his dick in you, you were done.Just like all the others.But Im still here, because Im the one he wants to keep around for the long haul.I maintained my cool even though the blow had been a perfect hit right where the most damage could be done.Thats pathetic.I walked out and didnt stop until I reached Stantons limousine.Squeezing Carys hand as I got in, I managed to wait until the car pulled away from the curb to start crying.Hey, baby girl, Cary called out when I shuffled into the living room the next morning.Dressed in nothing but a loose pair of old sweats, he was stretched out on the couch with his feet crossed and propped on the coffee table.He looked beautifully disheveled and comfortable in his own skin.Howd you sleep?I gave him the thumbs up and headed into the kitchen for coffee.I paused by the breakfast bar, my brows lifting at the massive arrangement of red roses on the counter.The fragrance was divine and I inhaled it with a deep breath.Whats this?They came for you about an hour ago.A Sunday delivery.Pretty and super pricey.I plucked the card off the clear plastic stake and opened it.Im still thinking about you.Gideon   From Cross?Cary asked.Yes.My thumb brushed over what I assumed was his handwriting.It was bold and masculine and sexy.A romantic gesture for a guy who didnt have romance in his repertoire.I dropped the card on the counter as if itd burned me and fetched a mug of coffee, praying caffeine would give me strength and restore my common sense.You dont seem impressed.He lowered the volume on the football game he was watching.Hes bad news for me.Hes like one giant trigger.I just need to stay away from him.Cary had been through therapy with me and he knew the drill.He didnt look at me funny when I broke things down into therapeutic jargon, and he didnt have any trouble shooting it back to me the same way.The phones been ringing all morning, too.I didnt want it to disturb you, so I shut the volume off.Aware of the lingering ache between my legs, I curled up on the couch and fought the compulsion to listen to our voice mail to see if Gideon had called.I wanted to hear his voice, and an explanation that would make sense of what happened last night.Sounds good to me.Lets leave it off all day.What happened?I blew steam off the top of my mug and took a tentative sip.I fucked his brains out in his limo and he turned arctic afterward.Cary watched me with those worldly emerald eyes, eyes that had seen more than anyone should be subjected to.Rocked his world, did you?Yeah, I did.And I got riled up just thinking about it.Wed connected.I knew it.Id wanted him more than anything last night, and today I wanted nothing to do with him ever again.It was intense.The best sexual experience of my life, and he was right there with me.I know he was.First time hed ever made it in a car, and he was kind of resistant at first, but then I got him so hot for it he couldnt say no.Really?Never?He ran a hand over his morning stubble.Most guys scratch car banging off their fuck list in high school.In fact, I cant think of anyone who didnt, except for the nerds and fuglies, and hes neither.I shrugged.I guess car banging makes me a slut.Cary grew very still.Is that what he said?No.He didnt say shit.I got that from his friend, Magdalene.You know that chick in most of the photos you printed off the Internet?She decided to sharpen her claws with a little catty girl chat in the bathroom.The bitch is jealous.Sexual frustration.She cant fuck him, because apparently girls who fuck him go into the discard pile.Did he say that?Again, fury laced his quiet question.Not in so many words.He said he doesnt sleep with his female friends.Hes got issues with women wanting more than a good time in the sack, so he keeps the women he bangs and the women he hangs out with in two separate camps.I took another sip of my coffee.I warned him that sort of setup wasnt going to work for me and he said hed make some adjustments, but I guess hes one of those guys wholl say whatevers necessary to get what he wants.Or else you have him running scared.I glared.Dont make excuses for him.Whose side are you on, anyway?Yours, baby girl.He reached out and patted my knee.Always yours.I wrapped my hand around his muscular forearm and stroked my fingers gently along the underside in silent gratitude.I couldnt feel the multitude of fine white scars from cutting that marred his skin, but I never forgot they were there.I was thankful every day that he was alive, healthy, and a vital part of my life.Howd your night go?I cant complain.His eyes took on a mischievous glint.I shagged that busty blonde in a maintenance closet.Her tits were real.Well, then.I smiled.You made her night, Im sure.I try.He picked up the phone receiver and winked at me.What kind of delivery do you want?Subs?Chinese?Indian?Im not hungry.Youre always hungry.If you dont pick something, Ill cook and youll have to eat that.I lifted my hand in surrender.Okay, okay.You pick.I got to work twenty minutes early on Monday, figuring Id skip running into Gideon.When I reached my desk without incident, I felt such relief that I knew I was in serious trouble where he was concerned.My moods were shifting all over the place.Mark arrived in high spirits, still floating from his major successes of the week before, and we dug right into work.Id done some vodka market comparisons on Sunday and he was kind enough to go over those with me and listen to my impressions.Mark was also assigned the account for a new e reader manufacturer, so we began the initial work on that.With such a busy morning, time flew swiftly and I didnt have time to think about my personal life.I was really grateful for that.Then I answered the phone and heard Gideon on the line.I wasnt prepared.Hows your Monday been so far?he asked, his voice sending a shiver of awareness through me.Hectic.I glanced at the clock and was startled to see it was twenty minutes to noon.Good.There was a pause.I tried calling you yesterday.I left a couple messages.I wanted to hear your voice.My eyes closed on a deep breath.It had taken every bit of my willpower to make it through the day without listening to the voice mail.Id even enlisted Cary in the cause, telling him to restrain me forcibly if it looked like I might succumb to the urge.I did the hermit thing and worked a little.Did you get the flowers I sent?Yes.Theyre lovely.Thank you.They reminded me of your dress.What the hell was he doing?I was beginning to think he had multiple personality disorder.Some women might say thats romantic.I only care what you say.His chair creaked as if hed pushed to his feet.I thought about stopping byI wanted to.I sighed, surrendering to my confusion.Im glad you didnt.There was another long pause.I deserved that.I didnt say it to be a bitch.Its just the truth.I know.ListenI arranged for lunch up here in my office so we dont waste any of the hour leaving and getting back.After his parting, Ill call you, Id wondered if he would want to get together again after he settled down from whatever trip hed been on.It was a possibility Id been dreading since Saturday night, aware that I needed to cut him off, but feeling strung out from the desire to be with him.I wanted to experience again that pure, perfect moment of intimacy wed shared.But I couldnt justify that one moment against all the other moments when he made me feel like crap.Gideon, we dont have any reason to have lunch together.We hashed things out Friday night, and wetook care of business Saturday.Lets just leave it at that.Eva.His voice turned gruff.I know I fucked up.Let me explain.You dont have to.Its okay.Its not.I need to see you.I dont want   We can do this the easy way, Eva.Or you can make it difficult.His tone took on a hard edge that made my pulse quicken.Either way, youll hear me out.I closed my eyes, understanding that I wasnt lucky enough to get away with a quick good bye phone chat.Fine.Ill come up.Thank you.He exhaled audibly.I cant wait to see you.I returned the receiver to its cradle and stared at the photos on my desk, trying to formulate what I needed to say and steeling myself for the impact of seeing Gideon again.The ferocity of my physical response to him was impossible to control.Somehow Id have to get past it and take care of business.Later, Id think about having to see him in the building over the days, weeks, and months ahead.For the moment, I just had to focus on making it through lunch.Yielding to the inevitable, I got back to work comparing the visual impact of some blow in card samples.Eva.I jumped and spun around in my chair, startled to find Gideon standing beside my cubicle.The sight of him blew me away, as usual, and my heart stuttered in my chest.A quick glance at the clock proved that a quarter hour had passed in no time at all.Gid Mr.Cross.You didnt have to come down here.His face was calm and impassive, but his eyes were stormy and hot.Ready?I opened my drawer and pulled out my purse, taking the opportunity to suck in a deep, shaky breath.He smelled phenomenal and looked even better.Mr.Cross.Marks voice.Its great to see you.Is there something ?Im here for Eva.We have a lunch date.I straightened in time to see Marks brows shoot up.He recovered quickly, his face smoothing into its usual good natured handsomeness.Ill be back at one, I assured him.See you then.Enjoy your lunch.Gideon put his hand at the small of my back and steered me out to the elevators, garnering raised brows from Megumi when we passed reception.I shifted restlessly as he hit the call button for the elevator, wishing I couldve made it through the day without seeing the man whose touch I craved like a drug.He faced me as we waited for the car, running his fingertips down the sleeve of my satin blouse.Every time I close my eyes, I see you in that red dress.I hear the sounds you make when youre turned on.I feel you sliding over my cock, squeezing me like a fist, making me come so hard it hurts.Dont.I looked away, unable to bear the intimate way he was looking at me.I cant help it.The arrival of the elevator was a relief.He caught my hand and pulled me inside.After he put his key in the panel, he tugged me closer.Im going to kiss you, Eva.I dont   He pulled me into him and sealed his mouth over mine.I resisted as long as I could; then I melted at the feel of his tongue stroking slow and sweet over mine.Id wanted his kiss since wed had sex.I wanted the reassurance that he valued what wed shared, that it meant something to him as it had to me.I was left bereft once again when he pulled away.Come on.He pulled the key out as the door opened.Gideons redheaded receptionist said nothing this time, although she eyed me strangely.In contrast, Gideons secretary, Scott, stood when we approached and greeted me pleasantly by name.Good afternoon, Miss Tramell.Hi, Scott.Gideon gave him a curt nod.Hold my calls.Yes, of course.I entered Gideons expansive office, my gaze drifting to the sofa where hed first touched me intimately.Lunch was arranged on the bar two plates covered in metal salvers.Can I take your purse?he asked.I looked at him, saw hed taken off his jacket and slung it over his arm.He stood there in his tailored slacks and vest, his shirt and tie both a pristine white, his hair dark and thick around his breathtaking face, his eyes a wild and dazzling blue.In a word, he amazed me.I couldnt believe Id made love to such a gorgeous man.But then, it hadnt meant the same thing to him.Eva?Youre beautiful, Gideon.The words fell out of my mouth without conscious thought.His brows lifted; then a softness came into his eyes.Im glad you like what you see.I handed him my purse and moved away, needing the space.He hung his coat and my purse on the coatrack, then moved to the bar.I crossed my arms.Lets just get this over with.I dont want to see you anymore.8  Gideon shoved a hand through his hair and exhaled harshly.You dont mean that.I was suddenly very tired, exhausted from fighting with myself over him.I really do.You and meit was a mistake.His jaw tightened.It wasnt.The way I handled it afterward was the mistake.I stared at him, startled by the fierceness of his denial.I wasnt talking about the sex, Gideon.Im talking about my agreeing to this crazy strangers with benefits deal between us.I knew it was all wrong from the beginning.I shouldve listened to my instincts.Do you want to be with me, Eva?No.Thats what   Not like we discussed at the bar.More than that.My heart started to pound.What are you talking about?Everything.He left the bar and came closer.I want to be with you.You didnt seem like you did Saturday.My arms tightened around my middle.I wasreeling.So?I was, too.His hands went to his hips.Then his arms crossed like mine.Christ, Eva.I watched him squirm and felt a flare of hope.If thats all youve got, were done.The hell we are.Weve already hit a dead end if youre going to take a head trip every time we have sex.He visibly struggled with what to say.Im used to having control.I need it.And you blew it all to hell in the limousine.I didnt handle that well.Ya think?Eva.He approached.Ive never experienced anything like that.I didnt think it was possible for me to.Now that I haveIve got to have it.Ive got to have you.Its just sex, Gideon.Super awesome sex, but that can seriously screw with your head when the two people doing it arent good for each other.Bullshit.Ive admitted I fucked up.I cant change what happened, but I can sure as shit get pissed that you want to cut me off because of it.You laid out your rules and I adjusted to accommodate them, but you wont make even a tiny adjustment for me.You have to meet me halfway.His face was hard with frustration.At least give me a damn inch.I stared at him, trying to figure out what he was doing and where this was going.What do you want, Gideon?I asked softly.He caught me to him and cupped my cheek in one hand.I want to keep feeling the way I feel when Im with you.Just tell me what I have to do.And give me some room to screw up.Ive never done this before.Theres a learning curve.I placed my palm over his heart and felt its pounding rhythm.He was anxious and passionate, and that had me on edge.How was I supposed to respond?Did I go with my gut or my common sense?Done what before?Whatever it takes to spend as much time with you as possible.In and out of bed.The rush of delight that swept through me was ridiculously powerful.Do you understand how much work and time a relationship between us is going to take, Gideon?Im wiped out already.Plus Im still working on some personal stuff, and I have my new jobmy crazy mother  My fingers covered his mouth before he could open it.But youre worth it, and I want you bad enough.So I guess I dont have a choice, do I?Eva.Damn you.Gideon lifted me, hitching one arm beneath my rear to urge me to wrap my legs around his waist.He kissed me hard on the mouth and nuzzled his nose against mine.Well figure it out.You say that as if itll be easy.I knew I was high maintenance and he was obviously going to be the same.Easys boring.He carried me over to the bar and set me down on a barstool.He pulled the dome off my place setting and revealed a massive cheeseburger and fries.The meal was still warm, thanks to a heated granite slab beneath the plate.Yum, I murmured, becoming aware of how hungry I was.Now that wed talked, my appetite had returned full force.He snapped open my napkin and laid it over my lap with a squeeze to my knee; then he took the seat beside me.So, how do we do this?Well, you pick it up with your hands and put it in your mouth.He shot me a wry look that made me smile.It felt good to smile.It felt good to be with him.It usually didfor a little while.I took a bite of my burger, moaning when I got a full hit of its flavor.It was a traditional cheeseburger, but the taste was divine.Good, right?he asked.Very good.In fact, a guy who knows about burgers this good might be worth keeping to myself.I wiped my mouth and hands.How resistant are you to exclusivity?As he set his burger down, there was an eerie stillness to him.I couldnt begin to guess what he was thinking.I assumed that was implied in our arrangement.But to avoid any doubts, Ill be clear and say there wont be any other men for you, Eva.A shiver moved through me at the blunt finality in his tone and the iciness of his gaze.I knew he had a dark side; Id learned long ago how to spot and avoid men who had dangerous shadows in their eyes.But the familiar alarm bells didnt ring around Gideon as they maybe should have.But women are okay?I asked to lighten the mood.His brows rose.I know your roommate is bisexual.Are you?Would that bother you?Sharing you would bother me.Its not an option.Your body belongs to me, Eva.And yours belongs to me?Exclusively?His gaze turned hot.Yes, and I expect you to take frequent and excessive advantage of it.Well, thenBut youve seen me naked, I teased, my voice husky.You know what youre getting.I dont.I love what Ive seen of your body so far, but that hasnt been a whole lot.We can rectify that now.The thought of him stripping for me made me squirm in my seat.He noticed and his mouth curved wickedly.Youd better not, I said regretfully.I was late getting back on Friday.Tonight, then.I swallowed hard.Absolutely.Ill be sure to clear my schedule by five.He resumed eating, completely at ease with the fact that wed both just penciled mind blowing sex into our mental day calendars.You dont have to.I opened the mini ketchup bottle by my plate.I need to hit the gym after work.Well go together.Really?I turned the bottle upside down and thumped the bottom with my palm.He took it from me and used his knife to coax the ketchup onto my plate.Its probably best for me to work off some energy before I get you naked.Im sure youd like to be able to walk tomorrow.I stared at him, astonished by the casualness with which hed made the statement and the rueful amusement on his face that told me he wasnt entirely kidding.My sex clenched in delicious anticipation.I could easily picture becoming seriously addicted to Gideon Cross.I ate some fries, thinking of someone else who was addicted to Gideon.Magdalene could be a problem for me.He swallowed a bite of his burger and washed it down with a swig from his bottled water.She told me shed talked to you, and that it didnt go well.I gave props to Magdalenes scheming and the clever attempt to cut me off at the pass.Id have to be very careful with her, and Gideon was going to have to do something about her like cut her off, period.No, it didnt go well, I agreed.But then I dont appreciate being told that you dont respect the women you fuck and that the moment you shoved your dick into me you were done with me.Gideon stilled.She said that?Word for word.She also said youre keeping on her ice until youre ready to settle down.Did she now?His low voice had a chilling bite to it.My stomach knotted, knowing things could either go really right or really wrong, depending on what Gideon said next.Dont you believe me?Of course I believe you.She could be a problem for me, I repeated, not letting it go.She wont be a problem.Ill talk to her.I hated the thought of him talking to her, because it made me sick with jealousy.I figured that was an issue I should disclose up front.Gideon  Yes?Hed finished his burger and was working on the fries.Im a very jealous person.I can be irrational with it.I poked at my burger with a fry.You might want to think about that, and whether or not you want to deal with someone who has self esteem issues like I do.It was one of my sticking points when you first propositioned me, knowing it was going to drive me nuts having women salivating all over you and not having the right to say anything about it.You have the right now.Youre not taking me seriously.I shook my head and took another bite of my cheeseburger.Ive never been as serious about anything in my life.Reaching over, Gideon ran a fingertip over the corner of my mouth, and then licked off the dab of sauce hed collected.Youre not the only one who can get possessive.Im very proprietary about whats mine.I didnt doubt that for a minute.I took another bite and thought of the night ahead.I was eager.Ridiculously so.I was dying to see Gideon naked.Dying to run my hands and lips all over him.Dying to have another go at driving him crazy.And I was damn near desperate to be under him, to feel him straining over me, pounding into me, coming hard and deep inside me  Keep thinking those thoughts, he said roughly, and youll be late again.I looked at him with raised brows How did you know what Im thinking?You get this look on your face when youre turned on.I intend to put that look on your face as often as possible.Gideon covered his plate again and stood, withdrawing a business card from his pocket and setting it down beside me.I could see that hed written his home and cell phone numbers on the back.I feel stupid asking this question considering our present conversation, but I need your cell phone number.Oh.I forcibly dragged my thoughts out of the bedroom.I have to get one first.Its on my to do list.What happened to the phone you were texting with last week?My nose wrinkled.My mother was using it to track my movements around the city.Shes a tadoverprotective.I see.He brushed the backs of his fingers down my cheek.Thats what you were talking about when you said your mom is stalking you.Yes, unfortunately.Okay, then.Well take care of the phone after work before we head to the gym.Its safer for you to have one.And I want to be able to call you whenever I feel like it.I set down the quarter of my burger that I couldnt eat, and wiped my hands and mouth.That was delicious.Thank you.It was my pleasure.He leaned over me and pressed his lips briefly to mine.Do you need to use the washroom?Yes.I need my toothbrush from my purse, too.A few minutes later, I found myself standing in a washroom hidden behind a door that blended seamlessly with the mahogany paneling behind the flat screens.We brushed our teeth side by side at the double sink vanity, our gazes meeting in our mirrored reflections.It was such a domestic, normal thing to do and yet we both seemed to delight in it.Ill take you back down, he said, crossing his office to the coatrack.I followed him, but veered off when we reached his desk.I went to it and put my hand on the clear space in front of his chair.Is this where you are most of the day?Yes.He shrugged into his jacket and I wanted to bite him, he looked so delectable.Instead, I hopped up to sit directly in front of his chair.According to my watch I had five minutes.Barely enough time to get back to work, but still.I couldnt resist exercising my new rights.I pointed at his chair.Sit.His brows rose, but he came over without argument and settled gracefully into the seat.I spread my legs and crooked my finger.Closer.He rolled forward, filling the space between my thighs.He wrapped his arms around my hips and looked up at me.One day soon, Eva, Im going to fuck you right here.Just a kiss for now, I murmured, bending forward to take his mouth.With my hands on his shoulders for balance, I licked across his parted lips; then slipped inside and teased him with gentleness.Groaning, he deepened the kiss, eating at my mouth in a way that made me achy and wet.One day soon, I repeated against his lips, Im going to kneel beneath this desk and suck you off.Maybe while youre on the phone playing with your millions like Monopoly.You, Mr.Cross, will pass Go and collect your two hundred dollars.His mouth curved against mine.I can see how this is going to go.Youre going to make me lose my mind coming everywhere I can in your tight, sexy body.Are you complaining?Angel, Im salivating.I was bemused by the endearment, although I liked its sweetness.Angel?He hummed a soft assent and kissed me.I couldnt believe what a difference an hour made.I left Gideons office in a completely different frame of mind than when Id entered it.The feel of his hand at the small of my back made my body hum with anticipation rather than the misery Id felt on the way in.I waved bye to Scott and smiled brightly at the unsmiling receptionist.I dont think she likes me, I told Gideon, as we waited for the elevator.Who?Your receptionist.He glanced over that way and the redhead beamed at him.Well, I murmured.She likes you.I guarantee her paychecks.My mouth curved.Yes, Im sure thats what it is.It couldnt possibly have anything to do with you being the sexiest man alive.Am I now?He caged me to the wall and burned me with a searing gaze.I set my hands against his abdomen, licking my lower lip when I felt the hard ridges of muscle tighten under my touch.Just an observation.I like you.With his palms pressed flat to the wall on either side of my head, he lowered his mouth to mine and kissed me softly.I like you back.You do realize youre at work, dont you?What good is being the boss if you cant do what you want?Hmm.When a car arrived, I ducked under Gideons arm and slid into it.He prowled in after me; then circled me like a predator, sliding up behind me to pull me back against him.His hands pushed into my front pockets and splayed against my hipbones, keeping me tucked close.The warmth of his touch so close to where I ached for him was a special brand of torture.In retaliation, I wriggled my butt against him and smiled when he hissed out a breath and hardened.Behave, he admonished gruffly.I have a meeting in fifteen minutes.Will you think of me while youre sitting at your desk?Undoubtedly.Youll definitely think about me while youre sitting at yours.Thats an order, Miss Tramell.My head fell back against his chest, loving the bite of command in his voice.I dont see how I couldnt, Mr.Cross, considering how I think of you everywhere else I go.He stepped out with me when we reached the twentieth floor.Thank you for lunch.I think thats my line.I backed away.See you later, Dark and Dangerous.His brows rose at my nickname for him.Five oclock.Dont make me wait.One of the cars in the left bank of elevators arrived.Megumi stepped out and Gideon stepped in, his gaze locked with mine until the doors closed.Whew, she said.You scored.Im pea green with envy.I couldnt think of anything to say to that.It was all still too new and I was afraid to jinx it.In the back of my mind, I knew these feelings of happiness couldnt last.Everything was going too well.I rushed to my desk and got to work.Eva.I looked up to see Mark standing in the threshold of his office.Could I talk to you a minute?Of course.I grabbed my tablet, even though his grim face and tone warned me they might not be needed.When Mark shut the door behind me, my apprehension increased.Is everything all right?Yes.He waited until I was seated; then took the chair beside me rather than the one behind his desk.I dont know how to say this  Just say it.Ill figure it out.He looked at me with compassionate eyes and a cringe of embarrassment.Its not my place to interfere.Im just your boss and theres a line that comes with that, but Im going to cross it because I like you, Eva, and I want you to work here for a long time.My stomach tightened.Thats great.I really love my job.Good.Good, Im glad.He shot me a quick smile.Justbe careful with Cross, okay?I blinked, startled by the direction of the conversation.Okay.Hes brilliant, rich, and sexy, so I understand the appeal.As much as I love Steven, I get a little flustered around Cross myself.Hes just got that kind of pull.Mark talked fast and shifted with obvious embarrassment.And I can totally see why hes interested in you.Youre beautiful, smart, honest, considerateI could go on, because youre great.Thanks, I said quietly, hoping I didnt look as ill as I felt.This sort of warning from a friend, and knowing that others would think of me as just another babe of the week, was exactly the sort of thing that preyed on my insecurities.I just dont want to see you get hurt, he muttered, looking as miserable as I felt.Part of thats selfish, Ill admit.I dont want to lose a great assistant because she doesnt want to work in a building owned by an ex.Mark, it means a lot to me that you care and that Im valuable to you around here.But you dont have to worry about me.Im a big girl.Besides, nothing is going to get me to quit this job.He blew out his breath, clearly relieved.All right.Lets put it away and get to work.So we did, but I set myself up for future torture by subscribing to a daily Google alert for Gideons name.And when five oclock rolled around, my awareness of my many inadequacies was still spreading through my happiness like a stain.Gideon was as prompt as hed threatened to be and he didnt seem to notice my introspective mood as we rode down in a crowded elevator.More than one woman in the car cast furtive glances in his direction, but that sort of thing I didnt mind.He was hot.I wouldve been surprised if they hadnt looked.He caught my hand when we cleared the turnstiles, linking his fingers with mine.The simple, intimate gesture meant so much to me in that moment that my grip tightened on his.And Id really have to watch out for that.The moment I became grateful he was spending time with me would be the beginning of the end.Neither of us would respect me if that happened.The Bentley SUV sat at the curb and Gideons driver stood at the ready by the rear door.Gideon looked at me.I had some workout clothes packed and brought over, in case you were set on visiting your gym.Equinox, right?Or we can go to mine.Wheres yours?I prefer to go to the CrossTrainer on Thirty fifth.My curiosity over how he knew which gym I frequented vanished when I heard the Cross in the name of his gym.You wouldnt happen to own the gym, would you?His grin flashed.The chain.Usually, I practice mixed martial arts with a personal trainer, but I use the gym occasionally.The chain, I repeated.Of course.Your choice, he said considerately.Ill go wherever you want.By all means, lets go to your gym.He opened the back door, and I slid in and over.I set my purse and my gym bag on my lap, and looked out the window as the car pulled away from the curb.The sedan driving next to us was so close I wouldnt have to lean far to touch it.Rush hour in Manhattan was something I was still getting used to.SoCal had bumper to bumper traffic, too, but it moved at a snails pace.Here in New York, speed mixed with the crush in a way that often made me close my eyes and pray to survive the trip.It was a whole new world.A new city, new apartment, new job, and new man.It was a lot to take on at once.I supposed it was understandable that I felt off balance.I glanced at Gideon and found him staring at me with an unreadable expression.Everything inside me twisted into a mess of wild lust and vibrating anxiety.I had no idea what I was doing with him, only that I couldnt stop even if I wanted to.9  We hit the cellular store first.The associate who helped us seemed highly susceptible to Gideons magnetic pull.She practically fell all over herself the minute he showed the slightest interest in anything, quickly launching into detailed explanations and leaning into his personal space to demonstrate.I tried separating from them and finding someone whod actually help me, but Gideons grip on my hand wouldnt let me move more than touching distance away.Then we argued over who was going to pay, which he seemed to think should be him even though the phone and account were mine.You got your way with picking the service provider, I pointed out, pushing his credit card aside and shoving mine at the girl.Because its practical.Well be on the same network, so calls to me are free.He swapped the cards deftly.I wont be calling you at all, if you dont put your damn credit card away!That did the trick, although I could tell he was unhappy about it.Hed just have to get over it.Once we got back in the Bentley, his mood seemed restored.You can head to the gym now, Angus, he told his driver, settling back in the seat.Then he pulled his smartphone out of his pocket.He saved my new number into his contact list; then he took my new phone out of my hand and programmed my list with his home, office, and cell numbers.Hed barely finished when we arrived at CrossTrainer.Not surprisingly, the three story fitness center was a health enthusiasts dream.I was impressed with every sleek, modern, top of the line inch of it.Even the womens locker room was like something out of a science fiction movie.But my awe was totally eclipsed by Gideon himself when I finished changing into my workout clothes and found him waiting for me out in the hallway.Hed changed into long shorts and a tank, which gave me my first look at his bare arms and legs.I came to an abrupt halt and someone coming out behind me bumped into me.I could barely manage an apology; I was too busy visually devouring Gideons smokin hot body.His legs were toned and powerful, flawlessly proportional to his trim hips and waist.His arms made my mouth water.His biceps were precisely cut and his forearms were coursing with thick veins that were both brutal looking and sexy as hell.Hed tied his hair back, which showed off the definition of his neck and traps, and the sculpted angles of his face.Christ.I knew this man intimately.My brain couldnt wrap itself around that fact, not while faced with the irrefutable evidence of how uniquely beautiful he was.And he was scowling at me.Straightening away from the wall where hed been leaning, he came toward me, and then circled me.His fingertips ran along my bare midriff and back as he made the revolution, sending goose bumps racing over my skin.When he stopped in front of me, I threw my arms around his neck and pulled his mouth down for a quick, playfully smacking kiss.What the hell are you wearing?he asked, looking marginally appeased by my enthusiastic greeting.Clothes.You look naked in that top.I thought you liked me naked.I was secretly pleased with my choice, which Id made that morning before Id known hed be with me.The top was a triangle with long straps at the shoulders and ribs that secured with Velcro and could be worn in a variety of ways to allow the wearer to determine where her breasts needed the most support.It was specially designed for curvy women and was the first top Id ever had that kept me from bouncing all over the place.What Gideon objected to was the nude color, which coordinated with the racing stripes on the matching black yoga pants.I like you naked in private, he muttered.Ill need to be with you whenever you go to the gym.I wont complain, since Im very much enjoying the view at the moment.Plus, I was perversely excited by his possessiveness after the hurt hed inflicted with his withdrawal Saturday night.Two very different extremes the first of many, I was sure.Lets get this over with.He grabbed my hand and led me away from the locker rooms, snatching two logod towels off a stack as we passed them.I need to fuck you.I need to be fucked.Jesus, Eva.His grip on my hand tightened to the point that it hurt.Where to?Free weights?Machines?Treadmills?Treadmills.I want to run a bit.He led me in that direction.I watched the way women followed him with their gazes, then their feet.They wanted to be in whatever section of the gym he was, and I couldnt blame them.I was dying to see him in action, too.When we reached the seemingly endless rows of treadmills and bikes, we found that there werent two treadmills free adjacent to each other.Gideon walked up to a man who had two open on either side of him.Id be in your debt if youd move over one.The guy looked at me and grinned.Yeah, sure.Thanks.I appreciate it.Gideon took over the mans treadmill and motioned me to the one beside it.Before he programmed his workout, I leaned over to him.Dont burn off too much energy, I whispered.I want you missionary style the first time.Ive been having this fantasy of you on top, banging the hell out of me.His gaze burned into me.Eva, you have no idea.Nearly giddy with anticipation and a lovely surge of feminine power, I got on my treadmill and started at a brisk walk.While I warmed up, I set my iPod shuffle to random and when Sexy Back by Justin Timberlake came on I hit my stride and went full out.Running was both a mental and physical exercise for me.Sometimes I wished just running fast could get me away from whatever was troubling me.After twenty minutes I slowed, then stopped, finally risking a glance at Gideon who was running with the fluidity of a well oiled machine.He was watching CNN on the overhead screens, but he flashed a grin at me as I wiped the sweat off my face.I swigged from my water bottle as I moved to the machines, picking one that give me a clear view of him.He went a full thirty on the treadmill; then he moved to free weights, always keeping me in his line of sight.As he worked out, quickly and efficiently, I couldnt help thinking how virile he was.It helped that I knew exactly what was in his shorts, but regardless, he was a man who worked behind a desk, yet kept his body in combat shape.When I grabbed a fitness ball to do some crunches, one of the trainers came up to me.As one would expect in a top of the line gym, he was handsome and very nicely built.Hi, he greeted me, with a movie star smile that showcased perfect white teeth.He had dark brown hair and eyes of nearly the same color.First timer, right?I havent seen you in here before.Yes, first time.Im Daniel.He extended his hand, and I gave him my name.Are you finding everything you need, Eva?So far so good, thanks.What flavor smoothie did you go for?I frowned.Excuse me?Your free orientation smoothie.He crossed his arms and his thick biceps strained the narrow cuffs of his uniform polo shirt.You didnt get one from the bar downstairs when you signed up?Youre supposed to.Ah, well.I shrugged sheepishly, thinking it was a nice touch all the same.I didnt have the usual orientation.Did you get the tour?If not, let me take you around.He touched my elbow lightly and gestured toward the stairs.You also get a free hour of personal training.We could do that tonight or make an appointment for later in the week.And Id be happy to take you down to the health bar and scratch that off the list, too.Oh, I cant really.My nose wrinkled.Im not a member.Ah.He winked.Youre here on a temp pass?Thats fine.You cant be expected to make up your mind if you dont get the full experience.I can assure you, though, that CrossTrainer is the best gym in Manhattan.Gideon appeared at Daniels shoulder.The full experience is included, he said, coming around and behind me to slide his arms around my waist, when youre the owners girlfriend.The word girlfriend reverberated through me, sending a crazy rush of adrenaline through my system.It was still sinking in that we had that level of commitment, but that didnt stop me from thinking the designation had a nice ring to it.Mr.Cross.Daniel straightened and took a step back; then extended his hand.Its an honor to meet you.Daniel has me sold on the place, I said to Gideon, as they shook hands.I thought Id done that.His hair was wet with sweat and he smelled divine.Id never known a sweaty man could smell so damn good.His hands stroked down my arms and I felt his lips on the crown of my head.Lets go.See you later, Daniel.I waved good bye as we walked away.Thanks, Daniel.Anytime.I bet, Gideon muttered.He couldnt keep his eyes off your tits.Theyre very nice tits.He made a low growling noise.I hid my amusement.He smacked my butt hard enough to send me forward a step and leave behind a hot sting even through my pants.That damned Band Aid you call a shirt doesnt leave much to the imagination.Dont take long in the shower.Youre just going to get sweaty again.Wait.I caught his arm before he passed the womens locker room on the way toward the mens.Would it gross you out if I told you I didnt want you to shower?If I said I want to find someplace really close by where I could jump you while youre still dripping sweat?Gideons jaw tightened and his gaze darkened dangerously.Im beginning to fear for your safety, Eva.Grab your stuff.Theres a hotel around the corner.Neither of us changed and we were outside in five minutes.Gideon walked briskly and I hurried to keep up.When he stopped abruptly, turned, and dipped me back in a lavish heated kiss on the crowded sidewalk, I was too stunned to do more than hold on.It was a soul wrenching melding of our mouths, full of passion and sweet spontaneity that made my heart ache.Applause broke out around us.When he straightened me again, I was breathless and dizzy.What was that?I gasped.A prelude.He resumed our dash to the nearest hotel, one I didnt catch the name of as he pulled me past the doorman and crossed straight to the elevator.It was clear to me that the property was one of Gideons even before a manager greeted him by name just before the elevator doors closed.Gideon dropped his duffel on the car floor and busied himself with figuring out how to extricate me from my sports top.I was slapping his hands away when the doors opened and he scooped up his bag.There was no one waiting on our floor and no one in the hallway.He pulled a master key out of somewhere and a moment later we were in a room.I pounced, pushing my hands up beneath his shirt to feel his damp skin and the hardness of the muscles beneath it.Get naked.Like now.He laughed as he toed off his sneakers and yanked his tank over his head.Oh my Godseeing him in the flesh all of him, as his shorts hit the floor was synapse frying.There wasnt an ounce of excess flesh on him anywhere, just hard slabs of honed muscle.He had washboard abs and that super sexy V of muscle on his pelvis that Cary called the Loin of Apollo.Gideon didnt wax his chest like Cary did, but he groomed with the same care he showed to the rest of his body.He was pure primal male, the embodiment of everything I coveted, fantasized about, and wished for.Ive died and gone to heaven, I said, staring unabashedly.Youre still dressed.He attacked my clothes, whipping my loosened top off before I took a full breath.My pants were wrestled down and I kicked my shoes off in such a hurry that I lost my balance and fell on the bed.I barely caught my breath before he was on me.We rolled across the mattress in a tangle.Everywhere he touched me left trails of fire behind.The clean, hardworking scent of his skin was an aphrodisiac and intoxicant at once, spurring my desire for him until I felt like I was about to lose my mind.Youre so beautiful, Eva.He plumped one breast in his hand before taking my nipple into his mouth.I cried out at the scorching heat and the lash of his tongue, my core tightening with every soft suck.My hands were greedy as they slid over his sweat damp skin, stroking and kneading, searching for the spots that made him growl and moan.I scissored my legs with his and tried to roll him, but he was too heavy and too strong.He lifted his head and smiled down at me.Its my turn this time.What I felt for him in that moment, seeing that smile and the heat in his eyes, was so intense it was painful.Too fast, I thought.I was falling too fast.Gideon   He kissed me deeply, licking into my mouth in that way of his.I thought he could really make me come with just a kiss, if we stayed at it long enough.Everything about him turned me on, from the way he looked and felt beneath my hands to the way he watched me and touched me.His greed and the silent demands he made on my body, the forcefulness with which he pleasured me and took his pleasure in return, drove me wild.I ran my hands through the wet silk of his hair.The crisp hairs on his chest teased my tightened nipples and the feel of his rock hard body against mine was enough to make me wet and needy.I love your body, he whispered, his lips moving across my cheek to my throat.His hand caressed the length of my torso from breasts to hip.I cant get enough of it.You havent had very much of it yet, I teased.I dont think Ill ever have enough.Nibbling and licking across my shoulder, he slid down and caught my other nipple between his teeth.He tugged and the tiny dart of pain had my back arching on a soft cry.He soothed the sting with a soft suck; then kissed his way downward.Ive never wanted anything this badly.
