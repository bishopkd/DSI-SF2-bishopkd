he asks, his voice quiet.I flounder momentarily.No  Ill tell him.Hes always complaining that I dont talk to him.I think that you felt trapped into bringing me to meet your parents.My voice is soft and hesitant.If Elliot hadnt asked Kate, youd never have asked me.I cant see his face in the dark, but he tilts his head, gaping at me.Anastasia, Im delighted that youve met my parents.Why are you so filled with self doubt?It never ceases to amaze me.Youre such a strong, self contained young woman, but you have such negative thoughts about yourself.If I hadnt wanted you to meet them, you wouldnt be here.Is that how you were feeling the whole time you were there?Oh!He wanted me there  and its a revelation.He doesnt seem uncomfortable answering me as he would if he were hiding the truth.He seems genuinely pleased that Im here a warm glow spreads slowly through my veins.He shakes his head and reaches for my hand.I glance nervously at Taylor.Dont worry about Taylor.Talk to me.I shrug.Yes.I thought that.And another thing, I only mentioned Georgia because Kate was talking about Barbados  I havent made up my mind.Do you want to go and see your mother?Yes.He looks oddly at me, like hes having some internal struggle.Can I come with you?he asks eventually.What!?Erm I dont think thats a good idea.Why not?I was hoping for a break from all this intensity to try and think things through.He stares at me.Im too intense?I burst out laughing.Thats putting it mildly!In the light of the passing street lamps, I see his lips quirk up.Are you laughing at me, Miss Steele?I wouldnt dare, Mr.Grey, I reply with mock seriousness.I think you dare, and I think you do laugh at me, frequently.You are quite funny.Funny?Oh yes.Funny peculiar or funny ha ha?Oh a lot of one and some of the other.Which way round?Ill leave you to figure that out.Im not sure if I can figure anything out around you, Anastasia, he says sardonically, and then continues quietly, What do you need to think about in Georgia?Us, I whisper.He stares at me, impassive.You said youd try, he murmurs.I know.Are you having second thoughts?Possibly.He shifts as if uncomfortable.Why?Holy crap.How did this suddenly become such an intense and meaningful conversation?Its been sprung on me, like an exam that Im not prepared for.What do I say?Because I think I love you, and you just see me as a toy.Because I cant touch you, because Im too frightened to show you any affection in case you flinch or tell me off or worse   beat me?What can I say?I stare momentarily out of the window.The car is heading back across the bridge.We are both shrouded in darkness, masking our thoughts and feelings, but we dont need the night for that.Why, Anastasia?Christian presses me for an answer.I shrug, trapped.I dont want to lose him.In spite of all his demands, his need to control, his scary vices.I have never felt as alive as I do now.Its a thrill to be sitting here beside him.Hes so unpredictable, sexy, smart, and funny.But his moods oh  and he wants to hurt me.He says hell think about my reservations, but it still scares me.I close my eyes.What can I say?Deep down I would just like more, more affection, more playful Christian, more love.He squeezes my hand.Talk to me, Anastasia.I dont want to lose you.This last week  He trails off.Were coming near to the end of the bridge, and the road is once more bathed in the neon light of the street lamps so his face is intermittently in the light and the dark.And its such a fitting metaphor.This man, whom I once thought of as a romantic hero  a brave shining white knight, or the dark knight as he said.Hes not a hero, hes a man with serious, deep emotional flaws, and hes dragging me into the dark.Can I not guide him into the light?I still want more, I whisper.I know, he says.Ill try.I blink up at him, and he relinquishes my hand and pulls at my chin, releasing my trapped lip.For you, Anastasia, I will try.Hes radiating sincerity.And thats my cue.I unbuckle my seatbelt, reach across, and clamber into his lap, taking him completely by surprise.Wrapping my arms around his head, I kiss him, long and hard, and in a nanosecond, hes responding.Stay with me, tonight, he breathes.If you go away, I wont see you all week.Please.Yes, I acquiesce.And Ill try too.Ill sign your contract.And its a spur of the moment decision.He gazes down at me.Sign after Georgia.Think about it.Think about it hard, baby.I will.And we sit in silence for a mile or two.You really should wear your seatbelt, Christian whispers disapprovingly into my hair, but he makes no move to shift me from his lap.I nuzzle up against him, eyes closed, my nose at his throat, drinking in his sexy Christian and spiced musky body wash fragrance, my head on his shoulder.I let my mind drift, and I allow myself to fantasize that he loves me.Oh, and its so real, tangible almost, and a small part of my nasty harpy self conscious acts completely out of character and dares to hope.Im careful not to touch his chest but just snuggle in his arms as he holds me tightly.All too soon, Im torn from my impossible daydream.Were home, Christian murmurs, and its such a tantalizing sentence, full of so much potential .Home, with Christian.Except his apartment is an art gallery, not a home.Taylor opens the door for us, and I thank him shyly, aware that hes been within earshot of our conversation, but his kind smile is reassuring and gives nothing away.Once out of the car, Christian assesses me critically .Oh no what have I done now?Why dont you have a jacket?he frowns as he shrugs out of his and drapes it over my shoulders.Relief washes through me.Its in my new car, I reply sleepily, yawning.He smirks at me.Tired, Miss Steele?Yes, Mr.Grey.I feel bashful under his teasing scrutiny.Nevertheless I feel an explanation is in order, Ive been prevailed upon in ways I never thought possible today.Well, if youre really unlucky, I may prevail upon you some more, he promises as he takes my hand and leads me into the building.Holy Shit Again?!I gaze up at him in the elevator.I have assumed hed like me to sleep with him, and then I remember that he doesnt sleep with anyone, although he has with me a few times.I frown, and abruptly his gaze darkens.He reaches up and grasps my chin, freeing my lip from teeth.One day I will fuck you in this elevator, Anastasia, but right now youre tired  so I think we should stick to a bed.Bending down, he clamps his teeth around my lower lip and pulls gently.I melt against him, and my breathing stops as my insides unfurl with longing.I reciprocate, fastening my teeth over his top lip, teasing him, and he groans.When the elevator doors open, he grabs my hand and tugs me into the foyer, through the double doors, and into the hallway.Do you need a drink or anything?No.Good.Lets go to bed.I raise my eyebrows at him.Youre going to settle for plain old vanilla?He cocks his head to one side.Nothing plain or old about vanilla  its a very intriguing flavor, he breathes.Since when?Since last Saturday.Why?Were you hoping for something more exotic?My inner goddess pops her head above the parapet.Oh no.Ive had enough exotic for one day.My inner goddess pouts at me, failing miserably to hide her disappointment.Sure?We cater for all tastes here  at least thirty one flavors.He grins at me lascivi ously.Ive noticed, I reply dryly.He shakes his head.Come on, Miss Steele, you have a big day tomorrow.Sooner youre in bed, sooner youll be fucked, and sooner you can sleep.Mr.Grey, you are a born romantic.Miss Steele, you have a smart mouth.I may have to subdue it some way.Come.He leads me down the hallway into his bedroom and kicks the door closed.Hands in the air, he commands.I oblige, and in one breathtakingly swift move, he removes my dress like a magician, grasping it at the hem and pulling it smoothly and fleetly over my head.Ta Da!he says playfully.I giggle and applaud politely.He bows gracefully grinning.How can I resist him when hes like this?He places my dress on the lone chair beside his chest of drawers.And for your next trick?I prompt, teasing.Oh my dear, Miss Steele.Get into my bed, he growls.And Ill show you.Do you think that for once I should play hard to get?I ask coquettishly.His eyes widen with surprise, and I see a glimmer of excitement.Well the doors closed.Not sure how youre going to avoid me, he says sardonically.I think its a done deal.But Im a good negotiator.So am I.  He stares down at me, but as he does, his expression changes, confusion washes over him, and the atmosphere in the room shifts abruptly, tensing.Dont you want to fuck?he asks.No, I breathe.Oh.He frowns.Okay, here goes deep breath.I want you to make love to me.He stills and stares at me blankly.His expression darkens .Oh shit, this doesnt look good .Give him a minute!My subconscious snaps.Ana, I  He runs his hands through his hair.Two hands.Jeez, hes really bewildered.I thought we did?he says eventually.I want to touch you.He takes an involuntary step back from me, his expression for a moment fearful, and then he reins it in.Please, I whisper.He recovers himself.Oh, no Miss Steele, youve had enough concessions from me this evening.And Im saying no.No?No.Oh I cant argue with that can I?Look, youre tired, Im tired.Lets just go to bed, he says, watching me carefully.So touching is a hard limit for you?Yes.This is old news.Please tell me why.Oh, Anastasia, please.Just drop it for now, he mutters exasperated.Its important to me.Again he runs both hands through his hair, and he utters an oath beneath his breath.Turning on his heel, he heads for the chest of drawers, pulls out a t shirt, and throws it at me.I catch it, bemused.Put that on and get into bed, he snaps, irritated.I frown but decide to humor him.Turning my back, I quickly remove my bra, pulling the t shirt on as hastily as I can to cover my nakedness.I leave my panties on, I havent worn them for most of the evening.I need the bathroom.My voice is a whisper.He frowns, bemused.Now youre asking permission?Err no.Anastasia, you know where the bathroom is.Today, at this point in our strange arrangement, you dont need my permission to use it.He cannot hide his irritation.He shrugs out of his shirt, and I scoot into the bathroom.I stare at myself in the over large mirror, shocked that I still look the same.After all that Ive done today, its still the same ordinary girl gaping back at me.What did you expect  that youd grow horns and a little pointy tail?My subconscious snaps at me.And what the hell are you doing?Touching is his hard limit.Too soon, you idiot, he needs to walk before he can run.My subconscious is furious, medusa like in her anger, hair flying, her hands clenched around her face like Edvard Munchs Scream.I ignore her, but she wont climb back into her box.You are making him mad  think about all thats hes said, all hes conceded.I scowl at my reflection.I need to be able to show him affection  then perhaps he can reciprocate.I shake my head resigned and grasp Christians toothbrush.My subconscious is right of course.Im rushing him.Hes not ready and neither am I.  We are balanced on the delicate see saw, that is our strange arrangement  at different ends, vacillating, and it tips and sways between us.We both need to edge closer to the middle.I just hope neither of us falls off in our attempt to do so.This is all so quick.Maybe I need some distance.Georgia seems more appealing than ever.As I begin brushing my teeth, he knocks.Come in, I splutter through a mouthful of toothpaste.Christian stands in the doorway, his PJs hanging off his hips  in that way that makes every little cell in my body stand up and take notice.Hes bare chested, and I drink him in like Im crazed with thirst and hes clear cool mountain spring water.He gazes at me impassively, then smirks and comes to stand beside me.Our eyes lock in the mirror, gray to blue.I finish with his toothbrush, rinse it off, and hand it to him, my look never leaving his.Wordlessly, he takes the toothbrush from me and puts it in his mouth.I smirk back at him, and his eyes are suddenly dancing with humor.Do feel free to borrow my toothbrush.His tone is gently mocking.Thank you, Sir, I smile sweetly, and I leave, heading back to bed.A few minutes later he joins me.You know this is not how I saw tonight panning out, he mutters petulantly.Imagine if I said to you that you couldnt touch me.He clambers onto the bed and sits cross legged.Anastasia, Ive told you.Fifty shades.I had a rough start in life  you dont want that shit in your head.Why would you?Because I want to know you better.You know me well enough.How can you say that?I struggle up onto my knees, facing him.He rolls his eyes at me, frustrated.Youre rolling your eyes.Last time I did that, I ended up over your knee.Oh, Id like to put you there again.Inspiration hits me.Tell me and you can.What?You heard me.Youre bargaining with me?His voice resonates with astonished disbelief.I nod.Yes this is the way.Negotiating.It doesnt work that way, Anastasia.Okay.Tell me, and Ill roll my eyes at you.He laughs, and I get a rare glimpse of carefree Christian.Ive not seen him for a while.He sobers.Always so keen and eager for information.His gray eyes blaze with speculation.After a moment, he gracefully climbs off the bed.Dont go away, he says and exits the room.Trepidation lances through me, and I hug myself.Whats he doing?Does he have some evil plan?Crap.Suppose he returns with a cane, or some weird kinky implement?Holy shit, what will I do then?When he does return, hes holding something small in his hands.I cant see what it is, and Im burning with curiosity.Whens your first interview tomorrow?he asks softly.Two.A slow wicked grin spreads across his face.Good.And before my eyes, he subtly changes.Hes harder, intractable...hot.This is Dominant Christian.Get off the bed.Stand over here.He points to beside the bed, and I scramble up and off in double quick time.He stares intently down at me, his eyes glittering with promise.Trust me?he asks softly.I nod.He holds out his hand, and in his palm are two round, shiny, silver balls, linked with a thick black thread.These are new, he says emphatically.I look questioningly up at him.I am going to put these inside you, and then Im going to spank you, not for punishment, but for your pleasure and mine.He pauses, gauging my wide eyed reaction.Inside me!I gasp, and all the muscles deep in my belly clench.My inner goddess is doing the dance of the seven veils.Then well fuck, and if youre still awake, Ill impart some information about my formative years.Agreed?Hes asking my permission!Breathlessly, I nod.Im incapable of speech.Good girl.Open your mouth.Mouth?Wider.Very gently, he puts the balls in my mouth.They need lubrication.Suck, he orders, his voice soft.The balls are cold, smooth, surprisingly heavy, and metallic tasting.My dry mouth pools with saliva as my tongue explores the unfamiliar objects.Christians gray gaze does not leave mine.Holy hell, this is turning me on.I squirm slightly.Keep still, Anastasia, he warns.Stop.He tugs them from my mouth.Moving toward the bed, he throws the duvet aside and sits down on the edge.Come here.I stand in front of him.Now turn round, bend down, and grasp your ankles.I blink at him, and his expression darkens.Dont hesitate, he admonishes me softly, an undercurrent in his voice, and he pops the balls in his mouth.Fuck, this is sexier than the toothbrush.I follow his orders immediately.Jeez, can I touch my ankles?I find I can, with ease.The t shirt slides up my back, exposing my behind.Thank heavens I have retained my panties, but I suspect I wont for long.He places his hand reverently on my backside and very softly caresses it with his whole hand.With my eyes open, I can see his legs through mine, nothing else.I close my eyes tightly as he gently moves my panties to the side and slowly runs his finger up and down my sex.My body braces itself in a heady mix of wild anticipation and arousal.He slides one finger inside me, and he circles it deliciously slowly.Oh, it feels good.I moan.His breathing halts, and I hear him gasp as he repeats the motion.He withdraws his finger and very slowly inserts the objects, one slow, delicious ball at a time.Oh my.Theyre body temperature, warmed by our collective mouths.Its a curious feeling.Once theyre inside me, I cant really feel them  but then again I know theyre there.He straightens my panties and leans forward, and his lips softly kiss my behind.Stand up, he orders, and shakily I get to my feet.Oh!Now I can feel them sort of.He grasps my hips to steady me while I re establish my equilibrium.You okay?he asks, his voice stern.Yes.My answer is feather soft.Turn round.I turn and face him.The balls pull downward and involuntarily I clench around them.The feeling startles me but not in a bad way.How does that feel?he asks.Strange.Strange good or strange bad?Strange good, I confess, blushing.Good.Theres a trace of humor lurking in his eyes.I want a glass of water.Go and fetch one for me please.Oh.And when you come back, I shall put you across my knee.Think about that, Anastasia.Water?He wants water  now  why?As I leave the bedroom, it becomes abundantly clear why he wants me to walk around   as I do, the balls weigh down inside me, massaging me internally.Its such a weird feeling and not entirely unpleasant.In fact, my breathing accelerates as I stretch up for a glass from the kitchen cabinet, and I gasp.Oh my I may have to keep these.They make me needy, needy for sex.Hes watching me carefully when I return.Thank you, he says as he takes the glass from me.Slowly, he takes a sip then places the glass on his bedside table.Theres a foil packet, ready and waiting, like me.And I know hes doing this to build the anticipation.My heart has picked up a beat.He turns his bright gray gaze to mine.Come.Stand beside me.Like last time.I sidle up to him, my blood thrumming through my body, and this time Im excited.Aroused.Ask me, he says softly.I frown.Ask him what?Ask me, his voice is slightly harder.What?How was your water?What does he want?Ask me, Anastasia.I wont say it again.And theres such a threat implicit in his words, and it dawns on me.He wants me to ask him to spank me.Holy shit.Hes looking at me expectantly, his eyes growing colder.Shit.Spank me, please Sir, I whisper.He closes his eyes momentarily, savoring my words.Reaching up, he grasps my left hand and he tugs me over his knees.I fall instantly, and he steadies me as I land in his lap.My heart is in my mouth as his hand gently strokes my behind.Im angled across his lap again so that my torso rests on the bed beside him.This time he doesnt throw his leg over mine, but smoothes my hair out of my face and tucks it behind my ear.Once hes done, he clasps my hair at the nape to hold me in place.He tugs gently and my head shifts back.I want to see your face while I spank you, Anastasia, he murmurs, all the while softly rubbing my backside.His hand moves down between the cheeks of my behind, and he pushes against my sex, and the full feeling is I moan.Oh, the sensation is exquisite.This is for pleasure, Anastasia, mine and yours, he whispers softly.He lifts his hand and brings it down in a resounding slap against the junction of my thighs, my behind, and my sex.The balls are forced forward inside me, and Im lost in a quagmire of sensation.The stinging across my behind, the fullness of the balls inside me, and the fact that hes holding me down.I screw my face up as my faculties attempt to absorb all these foreign feelings.I note somewhere in my brain that hes not smacked me as hard as last time.He caresses my backside again, trailing his palm across my skin and over my underwear.Whys he not removed my panties?Then his palm disappears, and he brings it down again.I groan as the sensation spreads.He starts a pattern: left to right and then down.The down ones are the best.Everything moving forward, inside me and in between each smack he caresses me, kneads me  so I am massaged inside and out.Its such a stimulating, erotic feeling, and for some reason, because this is on my terms, I dont mind the pain.Its not painful as such  well it is, but not unbearable.Its somehow manageable, and yes pleasurable even.I groan.Yes, I can do this.He pauses as he slowly peels my panties down my legs.I writhe on his legs, not because I want to escape the blows, but I want more, release, something.His touch against my sensitized skin is all sensuous tingle.Its overwhelming, and he starts again.A few soft slaps then building up, left to right and down.Oh, the downs, I groan.Good girl, Anastasia, he groans, and his breathing is ragged.He spanks me twice more, and then he pulls at the small threads attached to the balls and jerks them out of me suddenly.I almost climax  the feeling is out of this world.Moving swiftly, he gently turns me over.I hear rather see the rip of the foil packet, and then hes lying beside me.He seizes my hands, hoists them over my head, and eases himself onto me, into me, sliding slowly, filling me where the silver globes have been.I groan loudly.Oh, baby, he whispers as he moves back, forward, a slow sensual tempo, savoring me, feeling me.It is the most gentle he has ever been, and it takes no time at all for me to fall over the edge, spiraling into a delicious, violent, exhausting, orgasm.As I clench around him, it ignites his release, and he slides into me, stilling, gasping out my name in desperate wonder.Ana!Hes silent and panting on top of me, his hands still entwined in mine above my head.Finally, he leans back and stares down at me.I enjoyed that, he whispers, and then kisses me sweetly.He doesnt linger for more sweet kisses, but rises, covers me with the duvet, and disappears into the bathroom.On his return hes carrying a bottle of white lotion.He sits beside me on the bed.Roll over, he orders, and begrudgingly I move on to my front.Honestly, all this fuss.I feel very sleepy.Your ass is a glorious color, he says approvingly, and he tenderly massages the cooling lotion into my pink behind.Spill the beans, Grey, I yawn.Miss Steele, you know how to ruin a moment.We had a deal.How do you feel?Short changed.He sighs, slides in beside me, and pulls me into his arms.Careful not to touch my stinging behind, we are spooning again.He kisses me very softly beside my ear.The woman who brought me into this world was a crack whore, Anastasia.Go to sleep.Holy fuck what does that mean?Was?Shes dead.How long?He sighs.She died when I was four.I dont really remember her.Carrick has given me some details.I only remember certain things.Please go to sleep.Goodnight, Christian.Goodnight, Ana.And I slip into a dazed and exhausted sleep, dreaming of a four year old, gray eyed boy in a dark, scary, miserable place.There is light everywhere.Bright, warm, piercing light, and I endeavor to keep it at bay for a few more precious minutes.I want to hide, just a few more minutes.But the glare is too strong, and I finally succumb to wakefulness.A glorious Seattle morning greets me   sunshine pouring through the full height windows and flooding the room with too bright light.Why didnt we close the blinds last night?I am in Christian Greys vast bed minus one Christian Grey.I lie back for a moment staring through the windows at the lofty vista of Seattles skyline.Life in the clouds sure feels unreal.A fantasy  a castle in the air, adrift from the ground, safe from the realities of life  far away from neglect, hunger, and crack whore mothers.I shudder to think what he went through as a small child, and I understand why he lives here, isolated, surrounded by beautiful, precious works of art  so far removed from where he started mission statement indeed.I frown because it still doesnt explain why I cant touch him.Ironically, I feel the same up here in his lofty tower.Im adrift from reality.Im in this fantasy apartment, having fantasy sex with my fantasy boyfriend.When the grim reality is he wants a special arrangement, though hes said hell try more.What does that actually mean?This is what I need to clarify between us to see if we are still at opposite ends on the see saw or if we are inching closer together.I clamber out of bed feeling stiff, and for want of a better expression, well used.Yes, that would be all the sex then.My subconscious purses her lips in disapproval.I roll my eyes at her, grateful that a certain twitchy palmed control freak is not in the room, and resolve to ask him about the personal trainer.Thats if I sign.My inner goddess glares at me in desperation.Of course youll sign.I ignore them both, and after a quick trip to the bathroom, I go in search of Christian.Hes not in the art gallery, but an elegant middle aged woman is cleaning in the kitchen area.The sight of her stops me in my tracks.She has short blonde hair and clear blue eyes; she wears a plain white tailored shirt and a navy blue pencil skirt.She smiles broadly when she sees me.Good morning, Miss Steele.Would you like some breakfast?Her tone is warm but business like, and I am stunned.Who is this attractive blonde in Christians kitchen?Im only wearing Christians t shirt.I feel self conscious and embarrassed by my lack of clothing.Im afraid you have me at a disadvantage.My voice is quiet, unable to hide the anxiety in my voice.Oh, Im terribly sorry  Im Mrs.Jones, Mr.Greys housekeeper.Oh.How do you do?I manage.Would you like some breakfast, maam?Maam!Just some tea would be lovely, thank you.Do you know where Mr.Grey is?In his study.Thank you.I scuttle off toward the study, mortified.Why does Christian only have attractive blondes working for him?And a nasty thought comes involuntarily into my mind  Are they all ex subs?I refuse to entertain that hideous idea.I poke my head shyly round the door.Hes on the phone, facing the window, in black pants and a white shirt.His hair is still wet from the shower, and Im completely distracted from my negative thoughts.Unless that companys P&L improves, Im not interested, Ros.Were not carrying dead weight I dont need any more lame excuses Have Marco call me, its shit or bust time...Yes, tell Barney that the prototype looks good, though Im not sure about the inter face No, its just missing something I want to meet him this afternoon to discuss  In fact, him and his team, we can brainstorm.Okay.Transfer me back to Andrea  He waits, staring out of the window, master of his universe, staring down at the little people below from this castle in the sky.Andrea   Glancing up, he notices me at the door.A slow, sexy smile spreads across his beautiful face, and Im rendered speechless as my insides melt.He is without a doubt the most beautiful man on the planet, too beautiful for the little people below, too beautiful for me.No my inner goddess scowls at me, not too beautiful for me.He is sort of mine, for now.The idea sends a thrill through my blood and dispels my irrational self doubt.He continues his conversation, his eyes never leaving mine.Clear my schedule this morning, but get Bill to call me.Ill be in at two.I need to talk to Marco this afternoon, that will need at least half an hour Schedule Barney and his team in after Marco or maybe tomorrow, and find time for me to see Claude everyday this week Tell him to wait Oh No, I dont want publicity for Darfur Tell Sam to deal with it No.Which event?...Thats next Saturday?Hold on.When will you be back from Georgia?he asks.Friday.He resumes his phone conversation.Ill need an extra ticket because I have a date Yes Andrea, thats what I said, a date, Miss Anastasia Steele will accompany me Thats all.He hangs up.Good morning, Miss Steele.Mr.Grey, I smile shyly.He walks around his desk with his usual grace and stands in front of me.He smells so good; clean and freshly laundered, so Christian.He gently strokes my cheek with the back of his fingers.I didnt want to wake you, you looked so peaceful.Did you sleep well?I am very well rested, thank you.I just came to say hi before I had a shower.I gaze up at him, drinking him in.He leans down and gently kisses me, and I cant help myself.I throw my arms around his neck and my fingers twist in his still damp hair.Pushing my body flush against his, I kiss him back.I want him.My attack takes him by surprise, but after a beat, he responds, a low groan in his throat.His hands slip into my hair and down my back to cup my naked behind, his tongue exploring my mouth.He pulls back, his eyes hooded.Well, sleep seems to agree with you, he murmurs.I suggest you go and have your shower, or I shall lay you across my desk, now.I choose the desk, I whisper recklessly as desire sweeps like adrenaline through my system, waking everything in its path.He stares bewildered down at me for a millisecond.Youve really got a taste for this, havent you, Miss Steele.Youre becoming insatiable, he murmurs.Ive only got a taste for you, I whisper.His eyes widen and darken while his hands knead my naked backside.Damn right, only me, he growls, and suddenly with one fluid movement, he clears all the plans and papers off his desk so that they scatter on the floor, sweeps me up in his arms, and lays me down across the short end of his desk so that my head is almost off the edge.You want it, you got it, baby, he mutters, producing a foil packet from his pants pocket while he unzips his pants.Oh Mr.Boy Scout.He rolls the condom over his erection and gazes down at me.I sure hope youre ready, he breathes, a salacious smile across his face.And in a moment, hes filling me, holding my wrists tightly by my side, and thrusting into me deeply.I groan oh yes.Christ, Ana.Youre so ready, he whispers in veneration.Wrapping my legs around his waist, I hold him the only way I can as he stays standing, staring down at me, gray eyes glowing, passionate and possessive.He starts to move, really move.This is not making love, this is fucking  and I love it.I groan.Its so raw, so carnal, making me so wanton.I revel in his possession, his lust slaking mine.He moves with ease, luxuriating in me, enjoying me, his lips slightly parted as his breathing increases.He twists his hips from side to side, and the feeling is exquisite.Oh my.I close my eyes, feeling the build up  that delicious, slow, step climbing build.Pushing me higher, higher to the castle in the air.Oh yes his stroke increasing fractionally.I moan loudly.I am all sensation all him, enjoying every thrust, every push that fills me.And he picks up the pace, thrusting faster harder and my whole body is moving to his rhythm, and I can feel my legs stiffening, and my insides quivering and quickening.Come on, baby, give it up for me, he cajoles through gritted teeth  and the fervent need in his voice  the strain  sends me over the edge.I cry out a wordless, passionate plea as I touch the sun and burn, falling around him, falling down, back to a breathless, bright summit on Earth.He slams into me and stops abruptly as he reaches his climax, pulling at my wrists, and sinking gracefully and wordlessly onto me.Wow...that was unexpected.I slowly materialize back on Earth.What the hell are you doing to me?he breathes as he nuzzles my neck.You completely beguile me, Ana.You weave some powerful magic.He releases my wrists, and I run my fingers through his hair, coming down from my high.I tighten my legs around him.Im the one beguiled, I whisper.He looks up, gazing at me, his expression is disconcerted, alarmed even.Placing his hands on either side of my face, he holds my head in place.You.Are.Mine, he says, each word a staccato.Do you understand?Hes so earnest, so impassioned  a zealot.The force of his plea is so unexpected and disarming.I wonder why hes feeling like this.Yes, yours, I whisper, derailed by his fervor.Are you sure you have to go to Georgia?I nod slowly.And in that brief moment, I can see his expression change and the shutters coming down.Abruptly he withdraws, making me wince.Are you sore?he asks, leaning over me.A little, I confess.I like you sore.His eyes smolder.Reminds you where Ive been, and only me.He grabs my chin and kisses me roughly, then stands and holds his hand out to help me up.I glance down at the foil packet beside me.Always prepared, I murmur.He looks at me confused as he redoes his fly.I hold up the empty packet.A man can hope, Anastasia, dream even, and sometimes his dreams come true.He sounds so odd, his eyes burning.I just dont understand.My post coital glow is fading fast.What is his problem?So, on your desk, thats been a dream?I ask dryly, trying humor to lighten the atmosphere between us.He smiles an enigmatic smile that doesnt reach his eyes, and I know immediately this is not the first time hes had sex on his desk.The thought is unwelcome.I squirm uncomfortably as my post coital glow evaporates.Id better go and have a shower.I stand and make to move past him.He frowns and runs a hand through his hair.Ive got a couple more calls to make.Ill join you for breakfast once youre out of the shower.I think Mrs.Jones has laundered your clothes from yesterday.Theyre in the closet.What?When the hell did she do that?Jeez, could she hear us?I flush.Thank you, I mutter.Youre most welcome, he replies automatically, but theres an edge to his voice.Im not saying thank you for fucking me.Although, it was very...What?he asks, and I realize Im frowning.Whats wrong?I ask softly.What do you mean?Well youre being more weird than usual.You find me weird?He tries to stifle a smile.I blush.Sometimes.He regards me for a moment, his eyes speculative.As ever, Im surprised by you, Miss Steele.Surprised how?Lets just say that was an unexpected treat.We aim to please, Mr.Grey.I cock my head to one side like he often does to me and give his words back to him.And please me you do, he says, but he looks uneasy.I thought you were going to have a shower.Oh, hes dismissing me.Yes um, Ill see you in a moment.I scurry out of his office completely dumbfounded.He seemed confused.Why?I have to say as physical experiences go, that was very satisfying.But emotionally  well, Im rattled by his reaction, and that was about as emotionally enriching as cotton candy is nutritious.Mrs.Jones is still in the kitchen.Would you like your tea now, Miss Steele?Ill have a shower first, thank you, I mutter and take my blazing face quickly out of the room.In the shower, I try to figure out whats up with Christian.He is the most complicated person I know, and I cannot understand his ever changing moods.He seemed fine when I went into his study.We had sex and then he wasnt.No, I dont get it.I look to my subconscious.Shes whistling with her hands behind her back and looking anywhere but at me.She hasnt got a clue, and my inner goddess is still basking in a remnant of post coital glow.No  were all clueless.I towel dry my hair, comb it through with Christians one and only hair implement, and put my hair up in bun.Kates plum dress hangs laundered and ironed in the closet along with my clean bra and panties.Mrs.Jones is a marvel.Slipping on Kates shoes, I straighten my dress, take a deep breath, and head back out to the great room.Christian is still nowhere to be seen, and Mrs.Jones is checking the contents of the pantry.Tea now, Miss Steele?she asks.Please.I smile at her.I feel slightly more confident now that Im dressed.Would you like something to eat?No, thank you.Of course youll have something to eat, Christian snaps, glowering.She likes pancakes, bacon, and eggs, Mrs.Jones.Yes, Mr.Grey.What would you like, sir?Omelet, please, and some fruit.He doesnt take his eyes off me, his expression unfathomable.Sit, he orders, pointing to one of the bar stools.I oblige, and he sits beside me while Mrs.Jones busies herself with breakfast.Gosh, its unnerving having someone else listen to our conversation.Have you bought your air ticket?No, Ill buy it when I get home  over the Internet.He leans on his elbow, rubbing his chin.Do you have the money?Oh no.Yes, I say with mock patience as if Im talking to a small child.He raises a censorious eyebrow at me.Crap.Yes, I do, thank you, I amend rapidly.I have a jet.Its not scheduled to be used for three days, its at your disposal.I gape at him.Of course he has a jet, and I have to resist my bodys natural inclination to roll my eyes at him.I want to laugh.But I dont, as I cant read his mood.Weve already made serious misuse of your companys aviation fleet.I wouldnt want to do it again.Its my company, its my jet.He sounds almost wounded.Oh, boys and their toys!Thank you for the offer.But Id be happier taking a scheduled flight.He looks like he wants to argue further but decides against it.As you wish, he sighs.Do you have much preparation to do for your interview?No.Good.Youre still not going to tell me which publishing houses?No.His lips curl up in a reluctant smile.I am a man of means, Miss Steele.I am fully aware of that, Mr.Grey.Are you going to track my phone?I ask innocently.Actually, Ill be quite busy this afternoon, so Ill have to get someone else to do it.He smirks.Is he joking?If you can spare someone to do that, youre obviously overstaffed.Ill send an email to the head of human resources and have her look into our head count.His lips twitch to hide his smile.Oh thank the Lord, hes recovered his sense of humor.Mrs.Jones serves us breakfast and we eat quietly for a few moments.After clearing the pans, tactfully, she heads out of the living area.I peek up at him.What it is, Anastasia?You know, you never did tell me why you dont like to be touched.He blanches, and his reaction makes me feel guilty for asking.Ive told you more than Ive ever told anybody.His voice is quiet as he gazes at me impassively.And its clear to me that hes never confided in anyone.Doesnt he have any close friends?Perhaps he told Mrs.Robinson?I want to ask him, but I cant  I cant pry that invasively.I shake my head at the realization.He really is an island.Will you think about our arrangement while youre away?he asks.Yes.Will you miss me?I gaze at him, surprised by his question.Yes, I answer honestly.How could he mean so much to me in such a short time?Hes got right under my skin literally.He smiles and his eyes light up.Ill miss you too.More than you know, he breathes.My heart warms at his words.He really is trying, hard.He gently strokes my cheek, bends down, and kisses me softly.It is late afternoon, and I sit nervous and fidgeting in the lobby waiting for Mr.J.  Hyde of Seattle Independent Publishing.This is my second interview today, and the one Im most anxious about.My first interview went well, but it was for a larger conglomerate with offices based throughout the US, and I would be one of many editorial assistants there.I can imagine being swallowed up and spat out pretty quickly in such a corporate machine.SIP is where I want to be.Its small and unconventional, championing local authors, and has an interesting and quirky roster of clients.My surroundings are sparse, but I think its a design statement rather than frugality.I am seated on one of two dark green chesterfield couches made of leather  not unlike the couch that Christian has in his playroom.I stroke the leather appreciatively and wonder idly what Christian does on that couch.My mind wanders as I think of the possibilities no  I must not go there now.I flush at my wayward and inappropriate thoughts.The receptionist is a young African American woman with large silver earrings and long straightened hair.She has a bohemian look about her, the sort of woman I could be friendly with.The thought is comforting.Every few moments, she glances at up me, away from her computer and smiles reassuringly.I tentatively return her smile.My flight is booked; my mother is in seventh heaven that I am visiting; I am packed, and Kate has agreed to drive me to the airport.Christian has ordered me to take my BlackBerry and the Mac.I roll my eyes at the memory of his overbearing bossiness, but I realize now thats just the way he is.He likes control over everything, including me.Yet hes so unpredictably and disarmingly agreeable too.He can be tender, good humored, even sweet.And when he is, its so left field and unexpected.He insisted on accompanying me all the way down to my car in the garage.Jeez, Im only going for a few days, hes acting like Im going for weeks.He keeps me on the back foot permanently.Ana Steele?A woman with long, black, pre Raphaelite hair standing by the reception desk distracts me from my introspection.She has the same bohemian, floaty look as the receptionist.She could be in her late thirties, maybe in her forties.Its so difficult to tell with older women.Yes, I reply, standing awkwardly.She gives me a polite smile, her cool hazel eyes assessing me.I am wearing one of Kates dresses, a black pinafore over a white blouse, and my black pumps.Very interview, I think.My hair is restrained in a ponytail, and for once the tendrils are behaving them selves she holds her hand out to me.Hello, Ana, my names Elizabeth Morgan.Im head of Human Resources here at SIP.How do you do?I shake her hand.She looks very casual to be the head of HR.Please follow me.We go through the double doors behind the reception area, into a large brightly decorated open plan office, and from there, head into a small meeting room.The walls are pale green, lined with pictures of book covers.At the head of the Maplewood conference table sits a young man with red hair tied in a ponytail.Small, silver, hooped earrings glint in both his ears.He wears a pale blue shirt, no tie, and grey flannel trousers.As I approach him, he stands and gazes at me with fathomless dark blue eyes.Ana Steele, Im Jack Hyde, the commissioning editor here at SIP, and Im very pleased to meet you.We shake hands, and his dark expression is unreadable, though friendly enough, I think.Have you traveled far?he asks pleasantly.No, Ive recently moved to the Pike Street Market area.Oh, not far at all then.Please, take a seat.I sit, and Elizabeth takes a seat beside him.So why would you like to intern for us at SIP, Ana?he asks.He says my name softly and cocks his head to one side, like someone I know  its unnerving.Doing my best to ignore the irrational wariness he inspires, I launch into my carefully prepared speech, conscious that a rosy flush is spreading across my cheeks.I look at both of them, remembering The Katherine Kavanagh Successful Interviewing Technique lecture  maintain eye contact, Ana!Boy, that woman can be bossy too, sometimes.Jack and Elizabeth both listen attentively.You have a very impressive GPA.What extra curricular activities did you indulge in at WSU?Indulge?I blink at him.What an odd choice of word.I launch into details of my librarianship at the campus central library, and my one experience of interviewing an obscenely rich despot for the student magazine.I gloss over the part that I didnt actually write the article.I mention the two literary societies that I belonged to and conclude with working at Claytons and all the useless knowledge I now possess about hardware and DIY.They both laugh, which is the response Id hoped for.Slowly, I relax and begin to enjoy myself.Jack Hyde asks sharp, intelligent questions, but Im not thrown  I keep up, and when we discuss my reading preferences and my favorite books, I think I hold my own.Jack, on the other hand, appears to only favor American literature written after 1950.Nothing else.No classics   not even Henry James or Upton Sinclair or F Scott Fitzgerald.Elizabeth says nothing, just nods occasionally and takes notes.Jack, though argumentative, is charming in his way, and my initial wariness dissipates the longer we talk.And where do you see yourself in five years time?he asks.With Christian Grey, the thought comes involuntarily into my head.My errant mind makes me frown.Copy editing perhaps?Maybe a literary agent, Im not sure.I am open to opportunities.He grins.Very good, Ana.I dont have any further questions.Do you?he directs his question at me.When would you like someone to start?I ask.As soon as possible, Elizabeth pipes up.When could you start?Im available from next week.Thats good to know, Jack says.If thats all anyone has to say, Elizabeth glances at the two of us, I think that concludes the interview.She smiles kindly.Its been a pleasure to meet you, Ana, Jack says softly as he takes my hand.He squeezes it gently, so that I blink up at him as I say goodbye.I feel unsettled as I make my way to my car, though Im not sure why.I think the interview went well, but its so hard to say.Interviews seem such artificial situations, everyone on their best behavior trying desperately to hide behind a professional faade.Did my face fit?I shall have to wait and see.I climb into my Audi A3 and head back to the apartment, though I take me time.Im on the red eye with a stopover in Atlanta, but my flight doesnt leave until 10:25 this evening, so I have plenty of time.Kate is unpacking boxes in the kitchen when I return.How did they go?she asks, excited.Only Kate can look gorgeous in an oversized shirt, tattered jeans, and a dark blue bandana.Good, thanks, Kate.Not sure this outfit was cool enough for the second interview.Oh?Boho chic might have done it.Kate raises an eyebrow.You and boho chic.She cocks her head to one side   Gah!Why is everyone reminding me of my favorite Fifty Shades?Actually, Ana, youre one of the few people who could really pull that look off.I grin.I really liked the second place.I think I could fit in there.The guy who interviewed me was unnerving though, I trail off  shit Im talking to foghorn Kavanagh here.Shut up Ana!Oh?The Katherine Kavanagh radar for an interesting tidbit of information swoops into action  a tidbit that will only resurface at some inopportune and embarrassing moment, which reminds me.Incidentally  will you please stop winding Christian up?Your comment about Jos at dinner yesterday was out of line.Hes a jealous guy.It doesnt do any good, you know.Look, if he wasnt Elliots brother Id have said a lot worse.Hes a real control freak.I dont know how you stand it.I was trying to make him jealous  give him a little help with his commitment issues.She holds her hands up defensively.But  if you dont want me to interfere, I wont, she says hastily at my scowl.Good.Life with Christian is complicated enough, trust me.Jeez, I sound like him.Ana, she pauses staring at me.Youre okay, arent you?Youre not running to your mothers to escape?I flush.No Kate.It was you who said I needed a break.She closes the distance between us and takes my hands  a most un Kate thing to do.Oh no tears threaten.Youre just, I dont know different.I hope youre okay, and whatever issues youre having with Mr.Moneybags, you can talk to me.And I will try not to wind him up, though frankly its like shooting fish in a barrel with him.Look, Ana, if somethings wrong, you will tell me, I wont judge.Ill try to understand.I blink back tears.Oh, Kate.I hug her.I think Ive really fallen for him.Ana, anyone can see that.And hes fallen for you.Hes mad about you.Wont take his eyes off you.I laugh uncertainly.Do you think so?Hasnt he told you?Not in so many words.Have you told him?Not in so many words.I shrug apologetically.Ana!Someone has to make the first move, otherwise youll never get anywhere.What tell him how I feel?Im just afraid Ill frighten him away.And how do you know hes not feeling the same?Christian, afraid?I cant imagine him being frightened of anything.But as I say the words, I imagine him as a small child.Maybe fear was all he knew then.Sorrow grips and squeezes my heart at the thought.Kate gazes at me with pursed lips and narrowed eyes, rather like my subconscious  all she needs is the half moon specs.You two need to sit down and talk to each other.We havent been doing much talking lately.I flush.Other stuff.Non verbal communication and thats okay.Well, much more than okay.She grins.Thatll be the sexing!If thats going well, then thats half the battle Ana.Ill grab some Chinese take out.Are you ready to go?I will be  we dont have to leave for a couple of hours or so.No  Ill see you in twenty.She grabs her jacket and leaves, forgetting to close the door.I shut it behind her and head off to my bedroom mulling over her words.Is Christian afraid of his feelings for me?Does he even have feelings for me?He seems very keen, says Im his  but thats just part of his I must own and have everything now  control freak dominant self, surely.I realize that while Im away, I will have to run through all our conversations again and see if I can pick out telltale signs.Ill miss you too more than you know...Youve completely beguiled me  I shake my head.I dont want to think about it now.I am charging the BlackBerry, so I havent had it with me all afternoon.I approach it with caution, and Im disappointed that there are no messages.I switch on the mean machine, and there are no messages there either.Same email address Ana  my subconscious rolls her eyes at me, and for the first time, I understand why Christian wants to spank me when I do that.Okay.Well, Ill write him an email.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Interviews  Date: May 30 2011 18:49  To: Christian Grey  Dear Sir  My interviews went well today.Thought you might be interested.How was your day?Ana  I sit and glare at the screen.Christians responses are usually instantaneous.I wait and wait, and finally I hear the welcome ping from my inbox.From: Christian Grey  Subject: My day  Date: May 30 2011 19:03  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele  Everything you do interests me, you are the most fascinating woman I know.Im glad your interviews went well.My morning was beyond all expectations.My afternoon was very dull in comparison.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Fine Morning  Date: May 30 2011 19:05  To: Christian Grey  Dear Sir  The morning was exemplary for me too, in spite of you weirding out on me after the impeccable desk sex.Dont think I didnt notice.Thank you for breakfast.Or thank Mrs.Jones.Id like to ask you questions about her  without you weirding out on me again.Ana  My finger hovers over the send button, and I am reassured that Ill be on the other side of the continent this time tomorrow.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Publishing and You?Date: May 30 2011 19:10  To: Anastasia Steele  Anastasia  Weirding is not a verb and should not be used by anyone who wants to go into publishing.Impeccable?Compared to what, pray tell?And what do you need to ask about Mrs.Jones?Im intrigued.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: You and Mrs.Jones  Date: May 30 2011 19:17      To: Christian Grey  Dear Sir  Language evolves and moves on.It is an organic thing.It is not stuck in an ivory tower, hung with expensive works of art and overlooking most of Seattle with a helipad stuck on its roof.Impeccable  compared to the other times we have whats your word oh yes  fucked.Actually the fucking has been pretty impeccable, period, in my humble opinion   but then as you know I have very limited experience.Is Mrs.Jones an ex sub of yours?Ana  My finger hovers once more over the send button, and I press it.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Language.Watch Your Mouth!Date: May 30 2011 19:22  To: Anastasia Steele  Anastasia  Mrs.Jones is a valued employee.I have never had any relationship with her beyond our professional one.I do not employ anyone Ive had any sexual relations with.I am shocked that you would think so.The only person I would make an exception to this rule is you  because you are a bright young woman with remarkable negotiating skills.Though, if you continue to use such language, I may have to reconsider taking you on here.I am glad you have limited experience.Your experience will continue to be limited   just to me.I shall take impeccable as a compliment  though with you, Im never sure if thats what you mean, or if your sense of irony is getting the better of you  as usual.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From His Ivory Tower From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Not for all the Tea in China  Date: May 30 2011 19:27  To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grey  I think I have already expressed my reservations about working for your company.My views on this have not changed, are not changing, and will not change, ever.I must leave you now as Kate has returned with food.My sense of irony and I, bid you goodnight.I will contact you once Im in Georgia.Ana      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Even Twinings English Breakfast Tea?Date: May 30 2011 19:29  To: Anastasia Steele  Goodnight Anastasia.I hope you and your sense of irony have a safe flight.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Kate and I pull up outside the drop off area at Sea Tac Airport terminal.Leaning across, she hugs me.Enjoy Barbados, Kate.Have a wonderful holiday.Ill see you when I get back.Dont let old moneybags grind you down.I wont.We hug again  and then Im on my own.I head over to check in and stand in line, waiting with my carry on luggage.I havent bothered with a suitcase, just a smart rucksack that Ray gave me for my last birthday.Ticket please?The bored young man behind the desk holds up his hand without looking at me.Mirroring his boredom, I hand over my ticket and my drivers license as ID.I am hoping for a window seat if at all possible.Okay, Miss Steele.Youve been upgraded to first class.What?Maam, if youd like to go through to the first class lounge and await your flight there.He seems to have woken up and is beaming at me like Im the Christmas Fairy and the Easter Bunny rolled into one.Surely theres some mistake.No, no.He checks his computer screen again.Anastasia Steele  upgrade.He simpers at me.Ugh.I narrow my eyes.He hands me my boarding pass, and I head towards the first class lounge muttering under my breath.Damn Christian Grey, interfering control freak   he just cant leave well enough alone.I am manicured, massaged, and Ive had two glasses of champagne.The First Class lounge has many redeeming features.With each sip of Moet, I feel slightly more inclined to forgive Christian and his intervention.I open up my MacBook, hoping to test the theory that it works anywhere on the planet.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Over Extravagant Gestures  Date: May 30 2011 21:53  To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grey  What really alarms me is how you knew which flight I was on.Your stalking knows no bounds.Lets hope that Dr.Flynn is back from vacation.I have had a manicure, a back massage, and two glasses of champagne  a very nice start to my vacation.Thank you.Ana  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Youre Most Welcome      Date: May 30 2011 21:59  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele  Dr.Flynn is back, and I have an appointment this week.Who was massaging your back?Christian Grey  CEO with friends in the right places, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Aha!Pay back time.Our flight has been called so I shall email him from the plane.It will be safer.I almost hug myself with mischievous glee.There is so much room in first class.Champagne cocktail in hand, I settle myself into the sumptuous leather window seat as the cabin slowly fills.I call Ray to tell him where I am   a mercifully brief call, as its so late for him.Love you, Dad, I murmur.You too, Annie.Say hi to your mom.Goodnight.Goodnight.I hang up.Ray is in good form.I stare at my Mac and with the same childish glee building.Opening my laptop, I log into the email program.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Strong Able Hands  Date: May 30 2011 22:22  To: Christian Grey  Dear Sir  A very pleasant young man massaged my back.Yes.Very pleasant indeed.I wouldnt have encountered Jean Paul in the ordinary departure lounge  so thank you again for that treat.Im not sure if Ill be allowed to email once we take off, and I need my beauty sleep since Ive not been sleeping so well recently.Pleasant dreams Mr.Grey thinking of you.Ana  Oh, hes going to flip out  and I shall be airborne and out of reach.Serves him right.If Id been in the ordinary departure lounge then Jean Paul wouldnt have gotten his hands on me.He was a very nice young man, in a blonde, perma tanned way  honestly, who has a tan in Seattle?Its just so wrong.I think he was gay  but Ill just keep that detail to myself.I stare at my email.Kate is right.It is like shooting fish in a barrel with him.My subconscious stares at me with an ugly twist to her mouth  do you really want to wind him up?What hes done is sweet, you know!He cares about you and wants you to travel in      style.Yes, but he could have asked me or told me.Not made me look like a complete klutz at check in.I press send and wait, feeling like a very naughty girl.Miss Steele, youll need to stow your laptop for take off, the over made up flight attendant says politely.She makes me jump.My guilty conscience is at work.Oh, sorry.Crap.Now Ill have to wait to know if hes replied.She hands me a soft blanket and pillow, showing her perfect teeth.I drape the blanket over my knees.Its nice to feel mol lycoddled sometimes.The cabin has filled up, except for the seat beside me which is still unoccupied.Oh no a disturbing thought crosses my mind.Perhaps the seat is Christians.Oh shit  no he wouldnt do that.Would he?I told him I didnt want him to come with me.I glance anxiously at my watch and then the disembodied voice from the flight deck announces,  Cabin crew, doors to automatic and cross check.What does that mean?Are they closing the doors?My scalp prickles as I sit in palpitating anticipation.The seat next to me is the only unoccupied one in the sixteen seat cabin.The plane jolts as it pulls away from its stand, and I breathe a sigh of relief but feel a faint tingle of disappointment too no Christian for four days.I take a sneak peek at my BlackBerry.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Enjoy it While You Can  Date: May 30 2011 22:25  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele  I know what youre trying to do  and trust me  youve succeeded.Next time youll be in the cargo hold, bound and gagged in a crate.Believe me when I say that attending to you in that state will give me so much more pleasure than merely upgrading your ticket.I look forward to your return.Christian Grey  Palm Twitching CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Holy crap.Thats the problem with Christians humor  I can be never be sure if hes joking or if hes seriously angry.I suspect on this occasion hes seriously angry.Surreptitiously, so the flight attendant cant see, I type a reply under the blanket.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Joking?Date: May 30 2011 22:30  To: Christian Grey      You see  I have no idea if youre joking  and if youre not  then I think Ill stay in Georgia.Crates are a hard limit for me.Sorry I made you mad.Tell me you forgive me.A  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Joking  Date: May 30 2011 22:31  To: Anastasia Steele  How can you be emailing?Are you risking the life of everyone on board, including yourself, by using your BlackBerry?I think that contravenes one of the rules.Christian Grey  Two Palms Twitching CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Two palms!I put my BlackBerry away, sit back while the plane taxis to the runway, and pull out my tattered copy of Tess  some light reading for the journey.Once were airborne, I tip my seat back, and soon Im drifting off to sleep.The flight attendant wakes me as we start our descent into Atlanta.Local time is 5:45  a. m. , but Ive only had four hours sleep or so I feel groggy, but grateful for the glass of orange juice she hands me.I glance nervously at my BlackBerry.There are no further emails from Christian.Well, its nearly three in the morning in Seattle, and he probably wants to discourage me from screwing up the avionics system, or whatever prevents planes from flying if mobile phones are switched on.The wait in Atlanta is only an hour.And again Im luxuriating in the confines of the first class lounge.I am tempted to curl up and go to sleep on one of the plush, inviting couches that sink softly under my weight.But it will just not be long enough.To keep myself awake, I start a long steam of consciousness to Christian on my laptop.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Do you like to scare me?Date: May 31 2011 06:52 EST  To: Christian Grey  You know how much I dislike you spending money on me.Yes, youre very rich, but still it makes me uncomfortable, like youre paying me for sex.However, I like traveling first class, its so much more civilized than coach.So thank you.I mean it  and I did enjoy the massage from Jean Paul.He was very gay.I omitted that bit in my email to you to wind you up, because I was annoyed with you, and Im sorry about that.But as usual you overreact.You cant write things like that to me  bound and gagged in a crate  (Were you serious or was it a joke?)That scares me you scare me I am completely caught up in your spell, considering a lifestyle with you that I didnt even know existed until last Saturday week, and then you write something like that and I want to run screaming into the hills.I wont, of course, because Id miss you.Really miss you.I want us to work, but I am terrified of the depth of feeling I have for you and the dark path youre leading me down.What you are offering is erotic and sexy, and Im curious, but Im also scared youll hurt me  physically and emotionally.After three months you could say goodbye, and where will that leave me if you do?But then I suppose that risk is there in any relationship.This just isnt the sort of relationship I ever envisaged having, especially as my first.Its a huge leap of faith for me.You were right when you said I didnt have a submissive bone in my body and I agree with you now.Having said that, I want to be with you, and if thats what I have to do, I would like to try, but I think Ill suck at it and end up black and blue  and I dont relish that idea at all.I am so happy that you have said that you will try more.I just need to think about what  more means to me, and thats one of the reasons why I wanted some distance.You dazzle me so much I find it very difficult to think clearly when were together.They are calling my flight.I have to go.More later  Your Ana  I press send and make my way sleepily to the departure gate to board a different plane.This one has only six seats in first class, and once we are in the air, I curl up under my soft blanket and fall asleep.All too soon, Im woken by the flight attendant offering me more orange juice as we begin our approach to Savannah International.I sip slowly, beyond fatigued, and I allow myself to feel a modicum of excitement.Im going to see my mother for the first time in six months.Sneaking another covert look at my BlackBerry, I remember vaguely that I sent a long rambling email to Christian  but theres nothing in response.Its five in the morning in Seattle  hopefully hes still asleep and not up playing mournful laments on his piano.The beauty of carry on rucksacks is that one can breeze out of the airport and not wait endlessly for baggage at the carousels.The beauty of traveling first class is that they let you off the plane first.My mom is waiting with Bob, and it is so good to see them.I dont know if its because of exhaustion, the long journey, or the whole Christian situation, but as soon as Im in my mothers arms, I burst into tears.Oh Ana, honey.You must be so tired.She glances anxiously at Bob.No Mom, its just  Im so pleased to see you.I hug her tightly.She feels so good and welcoming and home.Reluctantly, I relinquish her, and Bob gives me an awkward one armed hug.He seems unsteady on his feet, and I remember that hes hurt his leg.Welcome back, Ana.Why you cryin?he asks.Aw, Bob, Im just pleased to see you too.I stare up into his handsome square jawed face, and his twinkling blue eyes that gaze at me fondly.I like this husband, Mom.You can keep him.He takes my backpack.Jeez, Ana, what have you got in here?That will be the Mac, and they both put their arms around me as we head for the parking lot.I always forget how unbearably hot it is in Savannah.Leaving the cool air conditioned confines of the arrival terminal, we step into the Georgia heat like were wearing it.Whoa!It saps everything.I have to struggle out of Mom and Bobs embrace so I can remove my hoodie.I am so glad I packed shorts.I miss the dry heat of Vegas sometimes, where I lived with Mom and Bob when I was seventeen, but this wet heat, even at 8:30 in the morning, takes some getting used to.By the time Im in the back of Bobs wonderfully air conditioned Tahoe SUV, I feel limp, and my hair has started a frizzy protest at the heat.In the back of the SUV I quickly text Ray, Kate, and Christian:  *Arrived Safely in Savannah.A :)*  My thoughts stray briefly to Jos as I press send, and through the fog of my fatigue, I remember that its his show next week.Should I invite Christian knowing how he feels about Jos?Will Christian still want to see me after that email?I shudder at the thought, and then put it out of my mind.Ill deal with that later.Right now I am going to enjoy my moms company.Honey, you must be tired.Would you like to sleep when we get home?No, Mom.Id like to go to the beach.I am in my blue halter neck tankini, sipping a Diet Coke, on a sun bed facing the Atlantic Ocean, and to think that only yesterday I was staring out at the Sound toward the Pacific.My mother lounges beside me in a ridiculously large floppy sun hat and Jackie O shades, sipping a Coke of her own.We are on Tybee Island Beach, just three blocks from home.She holds my hand.My fatigue has waned, and as I soak up the sun, I feel comfortable, safe, and warm.For the first time in forever, I start to relax.So Ana tell me about this man who has you in such a spin.Spin!How can she tell?What to say?I cant talk about Christian in any great detail because of the NDA, but even then, would I choose to talk to my mother about it?I blanch at the thought.Well?she prompts and squeezes my hand.His names Christian.Hes beyond handsome.Hes wealthy too wealthy.Hes very complicated and mercurial.Yes  I feel inordinately pleased with my concise, accurate summary.I turn on my side to face her, just as she makes the same move.She gazes at me with her crystal clear blue eyes.Complicated and mercurial are the two pieces of information I want to concentrate on, Ana.Oh no  Oh, Mom, his mood swings make me dizzy.Hes had a grim upbringing, so hes very closed, difficult to gauge.Do you like him?I more than like him.Really?She gapes at me.Yes, Mom.Men arent really complicated, Ana, honey.They are very simple, literal creatures.They usually mean what they say.And we spend hours trying to analyze what theyve said   when really its obvious.If I were you, Id take him literally.That might help.I gape at her.This sounds like good advice.Take Christian literally.Immediately some of the things hes said spring into my mind.I dont want to lose you  Youve bewitched me  Youve completely beguiled me  Ill miss you too more than you know...I gaze at my mom.She is on her fourth marriage.Maybe she does know something about men after all.Most men are moody darling, some more than others.Take your father for instance, Her eyes soften and sadden whenever she thinks of my dad.My real dad, this mythical man I never knew, snatched so cruelly from us in a combat training accident when he was a marine.Part of me thinks my mom has been looking for someone like my dad all this time maybe shes finally found what shes looking for in Bob.Pity she couldnt find it with Ray.I used to think your father was moody.But now when I look back, I just think he was too caught up in his job and trying to make a life for us.She sighs.He was so young, we both were.Maybe that was the issue.Hmm Christian is not exactly old.I smile fondly at her.She can become very soulful thinking about my father, but Im sure he had nothing on Christians moods.Bob wants to take us out tonight for dinner.To his golf club.Oh no!Bobs started playing golf?I scoff in disbelief.Tell me about it, groans my mother, rolling her eyes.After a light lunch back at the house, I start to unpack.I am going to treat myself to a si esta.My mother has disappeared to mold some candles or whatever she does with them, and Bob is at work, so I have time to catch up on some sleep.I open the Mac and fire it up.Its two in the afternoon in Georgia, eleven in the morning in Seattle.I wonder if I have a reply from Christian.Nervously, I log into the email program.From: Christian Grey    Subject: Finally!Date: May 31 2011 07:30  To: Anastasia Steele  Anastasia  I am annoyed that as soon as you put some distance between us, you communicate openly and honestly with me.Why cant you do that when were together?Yes, Im rich.Get used to it.Why shouldnt I spend money on you?Weve told your father Im your boyfriend, for heavens sake.Isnt that what boyfriends do?As your Dom, I would expect you to accept whatever I spend on you with no argument.Incidentally, tell your mother too.I dont know how to answer your comment about feeling like a whore.I know thats not what youve written, but its what you imply.I dont know what I can say or do to eradicate these feelings.Id like you to have the best of everything.I work exceptionally hard, so I can spend my money as I see fit.I could buy you your hearts desire, Anastasia, and I want to.Call it redistribution of wealth if you will.Or simply know that I would not, could not ever think of you in the way you described, and Im angry thats how you perceive yourself.For such a bright, witty, beautiful young woman you have some real self esteem issues, and I have a half a mind to make an appointment for you with Dr.Flynn.I apologize for frightening you.I find the thought of instilling fear in you abhorrent.Do you really think Id let you travel in the hold?I offered you my private jet for heavens sake.Yes it was a joke, a poor one obviously.However, the fact is  the thought of you bound and gagged turns me on (this is not a joke  its true).I can lose the crate  crates do nothing for me.I know you have issues with gagging, weve talked about that and if/  when I do gag you, well discuss it.What I think you fail to realize is that in Dom/sub relationships it is the sub that has all the power.Thats you.Ill repeat this  you are the one with all the power.Not I.  In the boathouse you said no.I cant touch you if you say no  thats why we have an agreement  what you will and wont do.If we try things and you dont like them, we can revise the agreement.Its up to you  not me.And if you dont want to be bound and gagged in a crate, then it wont happen.I want to share my lifestyle with you.I have never wanted anything so much.Frankly Im in awe of you, that one so innocent would be willing to try.That says more to me than you could ever know.You fail to see I am caught in your spell, too, even though I have told you this countless times.I dont want to lose you.I am nervous that youve flown three thousand miles to get away from me for a few days, because you cant think clearly around me.Its the same for me Anastasia.My reason vanishes when were together   thats the depth of my feeling for you.I understand your trepidation.I did try to stay away from you; I knew you were inexperienced, though I would never have pursued you if I had known exactly how innocent you were  and yet you still manage to disarm me completely in a way that nobody has before.Your email for example: I have read and re read it countless times trying to understand your point of view.Three months is an arbitrary amount of time.We could make it six months, a year?How long do you want it to be?What would make you comfortable?Tell me.I understand that this is a huge leap of faith for you.I have to earn your trust, but by the same token, you have to communicate with me when I am failing to do this.You seem so strong and self contained, and then I read what youve written here, and I see another side to you.We have to guide each other Anastasia, and I can only take my cues from you.You have to be honest with me, and we have to both find a way to make this arrangement work.You worry about not being submissive.Well maybe thats true.Having said that, the only      time you do assume the correct demeanor for a sub is in the playroom.It seems thats the one place where you let me exercise proper control over you, and the only place you do as youre told.Exemplary is the term that comes to mind.And Id never beat you black and blue.I aim for pink.Outside the playroom, I like that you challenge me.Its a very novel and refreshing experience, and I wouldnt want to change that.So yes, tell me what you want in terms of more.I will endeavor to keep an open mind, and I shall try and give you the space you need and stay away from you while you are in Georgia.I look forward to your next email.In the meantime, enjoy yourself.But not too much.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Holy crap.Hes written an essay like were back at school  and most of it good.My heart is in my mouth as I re read his epistle, and I huddle on the spare bed practically hugging my Mac.Make our agreement a year?I have the power!Jeez, Im going to have to think about that.Take him literally, thats what my mother says.He doesnt want to lose me.Hes said that twice!He wants to make this work too.Oh Christian, so do I!Hes going to try and stay away!Does this mean he might fail to stay away?Suddenly, I hope so.I want to see him.Weve been apart less than twenty four hours, and knowing that I cant see him for four days, I realize how much I miss him.How much I love him.Ana, honey.The voice is soft and warm, full of love and sweet memories of times gone by.A gentle hand brushes my face.My mom wakes me, and Im wrapped around my laptop, hugging it to me.Ana, sweetheart, she continues in her soft singsong voice while I surface from sleep, blinking in the pale pink light of dusk.Hi, Mom.I stretch out and smile.Were going out for dinner in thirty minutes.You still want to come?she asks kindly.Oh, yes, Mom, of course.I try very hard, but fail to stifle my yawn.Now thats an impressive piece of technology.She points to my laptop.Oh crap.Oh this?I strive for casual, surprised nonchalance.Will Mom notice?She seems to have grown more astute since I acquired a boyfriend.Christian lent it to me.I think I could pilot the space shuttle with it, but I just use it for emails and Internet access.Really its nothing.Eyeing me suspiciously, she sits down on the bed and tucks a stray lock of hair behind my ear.Has he emailed you?Oh double crap.Yeah.My nonchalance is wearing thin, and I flush.Perhaps hes missing you, huh?I hope so, Mom.What does he say?Oh triple crap.I frantically try to think of something acceptable from that email I can tell my mother.Im sure she doesnt want to hear about Doms and bondage and gagging, but then I cant tell her because theres the NDA.Hes told me to enjoy myself, but not too much.Sounds reasonable.Ill leave you to get ready, honey.Leaning over, she kisses my forehead.Im so glad youre here, Ana.Its wonderful to see you.And with that loving statement, she leaves.Hmm, Christian and reasonable two concepts that I thought were mutually exclusive, but after his email, maybe all things are possible.I shake my head.I will need time to digest his words.Probably after dinner  and I can reply to him then.I climb out of bed and quickly slip out of my t shirt and shorts, and head to the shower.I have brought Kates gray halter neck dress that I wore for my graduation.Its the only dressy item I have.One good thing about the heat is that the creases have dropped out, so I think it will do for the golf club.As I dress, I wake the laptop up.There is nothing new from Christian, and I feel a stab of disappointment.Very quickly, I type him an email.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Verbose?Date: May 31 2011 19:08 EST  To: Christian Grey  Sir, you are quite the loquacious writer.I have to go to dinner at Bobs golf club, and just so you know, I am rolling my eyes at the thought.But you and your twitchy palm are a long way from me so my behind is safe, for now.I loved your email.Will respond when I can.I miss you already.Enjoy your afternoon.Your Ana  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Your behind  Date: May 31 2011 16:10  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele  I am distracted by the title of this email.Needless to say it is safe  for now.Enjoy your dinner, and I miss you too, especially your behind and your smart mouth.My afternoon will be dull, brightened only by thoughts of you and your eye rolling.I think it was you who so judiciously pointed out to me that I too suffer from that nasty habit.Christian Grey  CEO & Eye Roller, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Eye Rolling  Date: May 31 2011 19:14 EST  To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grey  Stop emailing me.I am trying to get ready for dinner.You are very distracting, even when you are on the other side of the continent.And yes  who spanks you when you roll your eyes?Your Ana  I press send, and immediately the image of that evil witch Mrs.Robinson comes into my mind.I just cant picture it.Christian being beaten by someone as old as my mother, its just so wrong.Again I wonder what damage shes wrought.My mouth sets in a hard grim line.I need a doll to stick pins in, maybe that way I can vent some of the anger I feel at this stranger.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Your behind  Date: May 31 2011 16:18  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele  I still prefer my title to yours, in so many different ways.It is lucky that I am master of my own destiny and no one castigates me.Except my mother occasionally and Dr.Flynn, of course.And you.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Chastising Me?Date: May 31 2011 19:22 EST  To: Christian Grey  Dear Sir  When have I ever plucked up the nerve to chastise you, Mr.Grey?I think you are mixing me up with someone else which is very worrying.I really do have to get ready.Your Ana      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Your behind  Date: May 31 2011 16:25  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele  You do it all the time in print.Can I zip up your dress?Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.For some unknown reason, his words leap out of the page and make me gasp.Oh he wants to play games.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: NC 17  Date: May 31 2011 19:28 EST  To: Christian Grey  I would rather you unzipped it.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Careful what you wish for  Date: May 31 2011 16:31  To: Anastasia Steele  SO WOULD I.   Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Panting  Date: May 31 2011 19:33 EST  To: Christian Grey  Slowly  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Groaning  Date: May 31 2011 16:35  To: Anastasia Steele  Wish I was there.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Moaning  Date: May 31 2011 19:37 EST  To: Christian Grey  SO DO I  Ana!My mother calls me, making me jump.Shit.Why do I feel so guilty?Just coming, Mom.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Moaning  Date: May 31 2011 19:39 EST  To: Christian Grey  Gotta go.Laters, baby.I dash into the hall where Bob and my mother are waiting.My mother frowns.Darling   are you feeling ok?You look at bit flushed.Mom, Im fine.You look lovely, dear.Oh, this is Kates dress.You like it?Her frown deepens.Why are you wearing Kates dress?Oh no.Well I like this one and she doesnt, I improvise quickly.She regards me shrewdly while Bob oozes impatience with his hangdog, hungry look.Ill take you shopping tomorrow, she says.Oh, Mom, you dont need to do that.I have plenty of clothes.Cant I do something for my own daughter?Come on, Bobs starving.Too right, moans Bob, rubbing his stomach and assuming a fake pained expression.I giggle as he rolls his eyes, and we head out the door.Later when Im in the shower, cooling under the lukewarm water, I reflect on how much my mother has changed.Seeing her at dinner, she was in her element, funny and flirty and amongst many friends at the golf club.Bob was warm and attentive they seem so good for each other.Im really pleased for her.It means I can stop worrying about her and second guessing her decisions and put the dark days of Husband Number Three behind us both.Bob is a keeper.And shes giving me good advice.When did that start happening?Since I met Christian.Why is that?When Im done, I dry myself quickly, keen to get back to Christian.Theres an email waiting for me, sent just after I left for dinner a few hours ago.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Plagiarism  Date: May 31 2011 16:41  To: Anastasia Steele  You stole my line.And left me hanging.Enjoy your dinner.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings

original.Hell have stolen that line from someone.How was dinner?Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Unfinished Business?Date: May 31 2011 22:26 EST  To: Christian Grey  Dinner was filling  youll be very pleased to hear, I ate far too much.Getting interesting?How?From: Christian Grey  Subject: Unfinished Business   definitely  Date: May 31 2011 19:30  To: Anastasia Steele  Are you being deliberately obtuse?I think youd just asked me to unzip your dress.And I was looking forward to doing just that.I am also glad to hear you are eating.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Well theres always the weekend  Date: May 31 2011 22:36 EST  To: Christian Grey  Of course I eat Its only the uncertainty I feel around you that puts me off my food.And I would never be unwittingly obtuse, Mr.Grey.Surely youve worked that out by now ;)  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Cant Wait  Date: May 31 2011 19:40  To: Anastasia Steele  I shall remember that, Miss Steele, and no doubt use the knowledge to my advantage.Im sorry to hear that I put you off your food.I thought I had a more concupiscent effect on you.That has been my experience, and most pleasurable it has been too.I very much look forward to the next time.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Gymnastic Linguistics  Date: May 31 2011 22:36 EST  To: Christian Grey      Have you been playing with the thesaurus again?From: Christian Grey  Subject: Rumbled  Date: May 31 2011 19:40  To: Anastasia Steele  You know me so well Miss Steele.I am having dinner with an old friend now so I will be driving.Laters, baby  Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Which old friend?I didnt think Christian had any old friends, except her.I frown at the screen.Why does he have to still see her?Searing, green, bilious jealousy courses through me unexpectedly.I want to hit something, preferably Mrs.Robinson.Switching the laptop off in a temper, I clamber into bed.I should really respond to his long email from this morning, but Im suddenly too angry.Why cant he see her for what she is  a child molester?I switch off the light, seething, staring into the darkness.How dare she?How dare she pick on a vulnerable adolescent?Is she still doing it?Why did they stop?Various scenarios filter through my mind: he had had enough, then why is he still friends with her?Ditto her  is she married?Divorced?Jeez  does she have children of her own?Does she have Christians children?My subconscious rears her ugly head, leering, and Im shocked and nauseous at the thought.Does Dr.Flynn know about her?I struggle out of bed and fire the mean machine up again.I am on a mission.I drum my fingers impatiently waiting for the blue screen to appear.I hit Google images and enter Christian Grey into the search engine.The screen is suddenly littered with images of Christian: in black tie, be suited, jeez  Joss pictures from the Heathman, in his white shirt and flannel trousers.How did they get on the Internet?Boy he looks good.I move quickly on: some with business associates, then picture after glorious picture of the most photogenic man I know, intimately.Intimately?Do I know Christian intimately?I know him sexually, and I figure theres a lot more to discover there.I know hes moody, difficult, funny, cold, warm jeez, the man is a walking mass of contradictions.I click to the next page.
