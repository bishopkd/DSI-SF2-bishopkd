It sounded as if a pornographic movie was being filmed in the living room.I covered my face with my hands, and shook my head.Whatever lines had blurred or disappeared in the last week, an impenetrable stone wall had gone up in their place.I shook off my ridiculous emotions, forcing myself to relax.Travis was Travis, and we were, without a doubt, friends, and only friends.The shouting and other nauseating noises quieted down after an hour, followed by whining, and then grumbling by the women after being dismissed.Travis showered and then collapsed onto his side of the bed, turning his back to me.Even after his shower, he smelled like hed drank enough whiskey to sedate a horse, and I was livid that hed driven his motorcycle home in such a state.After the awkwardness faded and the anger weakened, I still couldnt sleep.When Travis breaths were deep and even, I sat up to look at the clock.The sun was going to rise in less than an hour.I ripped the covers off of me, walked down the hall and took a blanket from the hall cabinet.The only evidence of Travis threesome was two empty condom packages on the floor.I stepped over them and fell into the recliner.I closed my eyes.When I opened them again, America and Shepley were sitting quietly on the couch watching a muted television.The sun lit the apartment, and I cringed when my back complained at any attempted movement.Americas attention darted to me.Abby?she said, rushing to my side.She watched me with wary eyes.She was waiting for anger, or tears, or another emotionally charged outburst.Shepley looked miserable.Im sorry about last night, Abby.This is my fault.I smiled.Its okay, Shep.You dont have to apologize.America and Shepley traded glances, and then she grabbed my hand.Travis went to the store.He isugh, it doesnt matter what he is.I packed your stuff, and Ill take you to the dorms before he gets home so you dont have to deal with him.It wasnt until that moment that I felt like crying; I had been kicked out.I worked to keep my voice smooth before I spoke.Do I have time to take a shower?America shook her head.Lets just go, Abby, I dont want you to have to see him.He doesnt deserve to,  The door flew open, and Travis walked in, his arms lined with grocery sacks.He walked straight into the kitchen, furiously working to get the cans and boxes into the cabinets.When Pidge wakes up, let me know, okay?he said in a soft voice.I got spaghetti, and pancakes, and strawberries, and that oatmeal shit with the chocolate packets, and she likes Fruity Pebbles cereal, right, Mare?he asked, turning.When he saw me, he froze.After an awkward pause, his expression melted, and his voice was smooth and sweet.Hey, Pigeon.I couldnt have been more confused if I had woken up in a foreign country.Nothing made sense.At first I thought I had been evicted, and then Travis comes home with bags full of my favorite foods.He took a few steps into the living room, nervously shoving his hands in his pockets.You hungry, Pidge?Ill make you some pancakes.Or theres uhtheres some oatmeal.And I got you some of that pink foamy shit that girls shave with, and a hairdryer, and aa.just a sec, its in here, he said, rushing to the bedroom.The door opened, shut, and then he rounded the corner, the color gone from his face.He took a deep breath and his eyebrows pulled in.Your stuffs packed.I know, I said.Youre leaving, he said, defeated.I looked to America, who glowered at Travis as if she could kill him.You actually expected her to stay?Baby, Shepley whispered.Dont fucking start with me, Shep.Dont you dare defend him to me, America seethed.Travis looked desperate.I am so sorry, Pidge.I dont even know what to say.Come on, Abby, America said.She stood up and pulled on my arm.Travis took a step, but America pointed her finger at him.So help me God, Travis!If you try to stop her, I will douse you with gasoline and light you on fire while you sleep!America, Shepley said, sounding a bit desperate himself.I could see that he was torn between his cousin and the woman he loved, and I felt terrible for him.The situation was exactly what he had tried to avoid all along.Im fine, I said, exasperated by the tension in the room.What do you mean youre fine?Shepley asked, almost hopeful.I rolled my eyes.Travis brought women home from the bar last night, so what?America looked worried.Huh uh, Abby.Are you saying youre okay with what happened?I looked to all of them.Travis can bring home whoever he wants.Its his apartment.America stared at me as if Id lost my mind, Shepley was on the verge of a smile, and Travis looked worse than before.You didnt pack your things?Travis asked.I shook my head and looked at the clock; it was after two in the afternoon.No, and now Im going to have to unpack it all.I still have to eat, and shower, and get dressed.I said, walking into the bathroom.Once the door closed behind me, I leaned against it, and slid down to the floor.I was sure I had pissed off America beyond repair, but I made Shepley a promise, and I intended to keep my word.A soft knock on the door tapped above me.Pidge?Travis said.Yeah?I said, trying to sound normal.Youre staying?I can go if you want me to, but a bets a bet.The door vibrated with the soft bump of Travis forehead against the door.I dont want you leave, but I wouldnt blame you if you did.Are you saying Im released from the bet?There was a long pause.If I say yes, will you leave?Well, yeah.I dont live here, silly, I said, forcing a small laugh.Then no, the bets still in effect.I looked up and shook my head, feeling the tears burn my eyes.I had no idea why I was crying, but I couldnt stop.Can I take a shower, now?Yeah, he sighed.I heard Americas shoes enter the hall and stomp by Travis.Youre a selfish bastard, she growled, slamming Shepleys door behind her.I pushed myself up from the floor, turned on the shower, and then undressed, pulling the curtain behind me.After another knock on the door, Travis cleared his throat.Pigeon?I brought some of your stuff.Just set in on the sink.Ill get it.Travis walked in and shut the door behind him.I was mad.I heard you spitting out everything thats wrong with me to America and it pissed me off.I just meant to go out and have a few drinks and try to figure some things out, but before I knew it, I was piss drunk and those girls, he paused.I woke up this morning and you werent in bed, and when I found you on the recliner and saw the wrappers on the floor, I felt sick.You could have just asked me instead of spending all that money at the grocery store just to bribe me to stay.I dont care about the money, Pidge.I was afraid youd leave and never speak to me again.I cringed at his explanation.I hadnt stopped to think how it would make him feel to hear me talk about how wrong for me he was, and now the situation was too messed up to salvage.I didnt mean to hurt your feelings, I said, standing under the water.I know you didnt.And I know it doesnt matter what I say now, because I fucked things upjust like I always do.Trav?Yeah?Dont drive drunk on your bike anymore, okay?I waited for a full minute until he finally took a deep breath and spoke.Yeah, okay, he said, shutting the door behind him.Come in, I called, hearing a knock on the door.Travis walked in, and froze in the doorway.Wow.I smiled and looked down at my dress.A bustier that elongated into a short skirt, it was admittedly more daring than I had worn in the past.The material was thin, black and see through over a nude shell.Parker would be at that party, and I had every intention of being noticed.You look amazing, he said as I slid on my heels.I gave his white dress shirt and jeans an approving nod.You look nice, too.His sleeves were bunched above his elbows, revealing the intricate tattoos on his forearms.I noticed that his favorite black leather cuff was around his wrist when he shoved his hands in his pockets.America and Shepley waited for us in the living room.Parker is going to piss himself when he sees you, America giggled as Shepley led the way to the car.Travis opened the door, and I slid into the back seat of Shepleys Charger.Although we had occupied that seat countless times before, it was suddenly awkward to sit next to him.Cars lined the street, some even parked in the front lawn.The House was busting at the seams, and people were still walking down the street from the dorms.Shepley pulled onto the grass lot in the back, and America and I followed the boys inside.Travis brought me a red plastic cup full of beer, and then leaned in to whisper in my ear.Dont take these from anyone but me or Shep.I dont want anyone slipping anything in your drink.I rolled my eyes.No one is going to put anything in my drink, Travis.Just dont drink anything that doesnt come from me, okay?Youre not in Kansas, anymore, Pigeon.I havent heard that one before, I said sarcastically, taking a drink.An hour had passed, and Parker was still a no show.America and Shepley were dancing to a slow song in the living room when Travis tugged on my hand.Wanna dance?No thanks, I said.His face fell.I touched his shoulder.Im just tired, Trav.He put his hand on mine, and began to speak, but when I looked past him, I saw that Parker was walking toward us.Travis noticed my expression and turned.Hey, Abby!You made it!Parker smiled.Yeah, weve been here for an hour or so, I said, pulling my hand from under Travis.You look incredible!he yelled over the music.Thanks!I grinned, glancing over to Travis.His lips were pressed together, and a line had formed between his eyebrows.Parker nodded toward the living room and smiled.You wanna dance?I wrinkled my nose and shook my head.Nah, Im kinda tired.Parker looked at Travis, then.I thought you werent coming.I changed my mind, Travis said, irritated that he had to explain.I see that, Parker said, looking to me.You wanna get some air?I nodded, and then followed Parker up the stairs.He paused, reaching to take my hand as we climbed to the second floor.When we reached the top, he pushed open a pair of French doors to the balcony.Are you cold?he asked.A little chilly, I said, smiling when he pulled off his jacket and covered my shoulders, Thanks.Youre here with Travis?We rode together.Parkers mouth stretched across his face in a broad grin and then he looked out onto the lawn.A group of girls were huddled together, arms hooked together to fight the cold.Crepe paper and beer cans littered the grass, along with empty bottles of liquor.Among the clutter, Sig Tau brothers were standing around their masterpiece: a pyramid of kegs decorated with white lights.Parker shook his head.This place is going to be destroyed in the morning.The clean up crew is going to be busy.You have a clean up crew?Yeah, he smiled, we call them freshmen.Poor Shep.Hes not on it.He gets a pass because hes Travis cousin, and he doesnt live in the House.Do you live in the House?Parker nodded.The last two years.I need to get an apartment, though.I need a quieter place to study.Let me guessBusiness major?Biology, with a minor in Anatomy.Ive got one more year left, take the MCAT, and then hopefully Im off to Harvard Med.You already know youre in?My Dad went to Harvard.I mean, I dont know for sure, but hes a generous alumnus if you know what I mean.I carry a four point oh, got a twenty two hundred on my SATs, thirty six on my ACTs.Im in a good position for a spot.Your dads a doctor?Parker confirmed with a good natured smile.Orthopedic surgeon.Impressive.How about you?he asked.Undecided.Typical freshman answer.I sighed in dramatic fashion.I guess I just blew my chances at being exceptional.Oh, you dont have to worry about that.I noticed you the first day of class.What are you doing in Calculus Three as a freshman?I smiled and twisted my hair around my finger.Math is sort of easy for me.I packed on the classes in high school, and took two summer courses at Wichita State.Now thats impressive, he said.We stood on the balcony for over an hour, talking about everything from local eateries to how I became such good friends with Travis.I wouldnt mention it, but the two of you seem to be the topic of conversation.Great, I murmured.Its just unusual for Travis.He doesnt befriend women.He tends to make enemies of them more often than not.Oh, I dont know.Ive seen more than a few that either have short term memory loss or are all too forgiving when it comes to him.Parker laughed.His white teeth gleamed against his golden tan.People just dont understand your relationship.You have to admit its a bit ambiguous.Are you asking if Im sleeping with him?He smiled.You wouldnt be here with him if you were.Ive known him since I was fourteen, and Im well aware of how he operates.Im curious about your friendship, though.It is what it is, I shrugged.We hang out, eat, watch T. V. , study and argue.Thats about it.Parker laughed out loud, shaking his head at my honesty.Ive heard youre the only person whos allowed to put Travis in his place.Thats an honorable title.Whatever that means.Hes not as bad as everyone makes him out to be.The sky turned purple and then pink as the sun broke above the horizon.Parker looked at his watch, glancing over the railing to the thinning crowd on the lawn.Looks like the partys over.I better track down Shep and Mare.Would you mind if I drove you home?he asked.I tried to subdue my excitement.Not at all.Ill let America know.I walked through the door, and then cringed before turning around.Do you know where Travis lives?Parkers thick, brown eyebrows pulled in.Yes, why?Thats where Im staying, I said, bracing for his reaction.Youre staying with Travis?I sort of lost a bet, so Im there for a month.A month?Its a long story, I shrugged sheepishly.But you two are just friends?Yes.Then Ill take you to Travis, he smiled.I trotted down the stairs to find America, and passed a sullen Travis, who seemed annoyed with the drunken girl speaking to him.He followed me into the hall as I tugged on Americas dress.You guys can go ahead.Parker offered me a ride home.What?America said with excitement in her eyes.What?Travis asked, angry.Is there a problem?America asked him.He glared at America, and then pulled me around the corner, his jaw flitting under his skin.You dont even know the guy.I pulled my arm from his grip.This is none of your business, Travis.The hell if its not.Im not letting you ride home with a complete stranger.What if he tries something on you?Good!Hes cute!Travis expression contorted from surprise to anger, and I braced myself for what he might say next.Parker Hayes, Pidge?Really?Parker Hayes, he repeated with disdain.What kind of name is that, anyway?I crossed my arms.Stop it, Trav.Youre being a jerk.He leaned in, seeming flustered.Ill kill him if he touches you.I like him, I said, emphasizing every word.He seemed stunned at my confession, and then his features turned severe.Fine.If he ends up holding you down in the backseat of his car, dont come crying to me.My mouth popped open, offended and instantly furious.Dont worry, I wont, I said, shouldering passed him.Travis grabbed my arm and sighed, peering at me over his shoulder.I didnt mean it, Pidge.If he hurts you  if he even makes you feel uncomfortable  you let me know.The anger subsided, and my shoulders fell.I know you didnt.But you have got to curb this over protective big brother thing youve got going on.Travis laughed once.Im not playing the big brother, Pigeon.Not even close.Parker rounded the corner and pushed his hands inside his pockets, offering his elbow to me.All set?Travis clenched his jaw, and I stepped to the other side of Parker to distract him from Travis expression.Yeah, lets go.I took Parkers arm and walked with him a few steps before turning to say goodbye to Travis, but he was glowering at the back of Parkers head.His eyes darted to me and then his features smoothed.Stop it, I said through my teeth, following Parker through the remnants of the crowd to his car.Im the silver one.The headlights of his car blinked twice when he hit the keyless entry.He opened the passenger side door, and I laughed.You drive a Porsche?Shes not just a Porsche.Shes a Porsche nine one one GT three.Theres a difference.Let me guess, its the love of your life?I said, quoting Travis statement about his motorcycle.No, its a car.The love of my life will be a woman with my last name.I allowed a small smile, trying not to be overly affected by his sentiment.He held my hand to help me into the car, and when he slid behind the wheel, he leaned his head against his seat and smiled at me.What are you doing tonight?Tonight?I asked.Its morning.I want to ask you to dinner before someone else beats me to it.A grin extended across my face.I dont have any plans.Ill pick you up at six?Okay, I said, watching him slink his fingers between mine.Parker took me straight to Travis, keeping to the speed limit and my hand in his.He pulled behind the Harley, and like before, opened my door.Once we reached the landing, he leaned down to kiss my cheek.Get some rest.Ill see you tonight, he whispered in my ear.Bye, I smiled, turning the knob.When I pushed, the door gave way and I surged forward.Travis grabbed my arm before I fell.Easy there, Grace.I turned to see Parker staring at us with an uncomfortable expression.He leaned over to peer into the apartment.Any humiliated, stranded girls in there I need to give a ride?Travis glared at Parker.Dont start with me.Parker smiled and winked.Im always giving him a hard time.I dont get to quite as often since hes realized its easier if he can get them to drive their own cars.I guess that does simplify things, I said, teasing Travis.Not funny, Pidge.Pidge?Parker asked.Its uhshort for Pigeon.Its just a nickname, I dont even know where he came up with it, I said.It was the first time Id felt awkward about the name Travis had bestowed on me the night we met.Youre going to have to fill me in when you find out.Sounds like a good story, Parker smiled.Night, Abby.Dont you mean good morning?I said, watching him trot down the stairs.That too, he called back with a sweet smile.Travis slammed the door, and I had to jerk my head back before it caught me in the face.What?I snapped.Travis shook his head, and walked to his bedroom.I followed him, and then hopped on one foot to pull off my heel.Hes nice, Trav.He sighed and walked over to me.Youre gonna hurt yourself, he said, hooking his arm around my waist with one hand, and pulling off my heels with the other.He tossed them into the closet, and then pulled off his shirt, making his way to the bed.I unzipped my dress and shimmied it over my hips, kicking it into the corner.I yanked a t shirt over my head, then unsnapped my bra, pulling it through the sleeve of my shirt.When I wrapped my hair into a bun on top of my head, I noticed him staring.Im sure theres nothing I have that you havent seen before, I said, rolling my eyes.I slid under the covers and settled against my pillow, curling into a ball.He unbuckled his belt and pulled his jeans down, stepping out of them.I waited while he stood quietly for a moment.I had my back to him, so I wondered what he was doing, standing beside the bed in silence.The bed concaved when he finally crawled onto the mattress beside me, and I stiffened when his hand rested on my hip.I missed a fight tonight, he said.Adam called.I didnt go.Why?I said, turning to face him.I wanted to make sure you got home.I wrinkled my nose.You didnt have to babysit me.He traced the length of my arm with his finger, sending shivers up my spine.I know.I guess I still feel bad about the other night.I told you I didnt care.He sat up on his elbow, a dubious frown on his face.Is that why you slept on the recliner?Because you didnt care?I couldnt fall asleep after your friends left.You slept just fine in the recliner.Why couldnt you sleep with me?You mean next to a guy who still smelled like the pair of bar flies he had just sent home?I dont know!How selfish of me!Travis winced.I said I was sorry.And I said I didnt care.Goodnight, I said, turning over.Several moments of silence passed.He slid his hand across the top of my pillow, resting his hand on mine.He caressed the delicate pieces of skin between my fingers, and then he pressed his lips against my hair.As worried as I was that youd never speak to me againI think its worse that youre indifferent.My eyes closed.What do you want from me, Travis?You dont want me to be upset about what you did, but you want me to care.You tell America that you dont want to date me, but you get so pissed off when I say the same thing, that you storm out and get ridiculously drunk.You dont make any sense.Is that why you said those things to America?Because I said I wouldnt date you?My teeth clenched.He had just insinuated that I was playing games with him.I formed the most direct answer I could think of.No, I meant what I said.I just didnt mean it as an insult.Travis sighed.I just said that because, he scratched his short hair nervously, I dont want to ruin anything, Pigeon.I wouldnt even know how to go about being who you deserve.I was just trying to get it worked out in my head.Whatever that means.I have to get some sleep.I have a date tonight.With Parker?he asked, anger seeping through his tone.Yes.Can I please go to sleep?Sure, he said, shoving himself off the bed and then slamming the door behind him.The recliner squeaked under his weight and then muffled voices from the television drifted down the hall.I forced my eyes shut and tried to calm down enough to doze off, even if it was just for a few hours.The clock read three P. M.  when I peeled my eyes open.I grabbed a towel and my robe, and then trudged into the bathroom.As soon as I closed the shower curtain, the door opened and shut.I waited for someone to speak, but the only sound was the toilet lid smacking against porcelain.Travis?Nope, its me, America said.Do you have to pee in here?You have your own bathroom.Shep has been in there for half an hour with the beer shits.Not going in there.Nice.I hear you have a date tonight.Travis is pissed!she lilted.At six!He is so sweet, America.Hes just I trailed off, sighing.I was gushing, and it wasnt like me to gush.I kept thinking about how perfect he had been since the moment wed met.He was exactly what I needed, the polar opposite of Travis.Rendered you speechless?she giggled.I poked my head from the curtain.I didnt want to come home!I could have talked to him forever!Sounds promising.Isnt it kind of weird that youre here, though?I ducked under the water, rinsing away the suds.I explained it to him.The toilet flushed, and the faucet turned on, making the water flash cold for a moment.I cried out and the door flew open.Pidge?Travis said.America laughed.I just flushed the toilet, Trav, calm down.Oh.You all right, Pigeon?Im great.Get out.The door shut again and I sighed.Is it too much to ask for locks on the doors?America didnt answer.Mare?Its really too bad you two couldnt get on the same page.Youre the only girl that could have.she sighed.Never mind.It doesnt matter, now.I turned off the water and wrapped myself in a towel.Youre as bad as he is.Its a sicknessno one here makes sense.Youre pissed at him, remember?I know, she nodded.I turned on my new hairdryer and began the process of primping for my date with Parker.I curled my hair, and painted my nails and lips a deep shade of red.It was a bit much for a first date.I frowned at myself in the mirror.It wasnt Parker I was trying to impress.I wasnt in a position to be insulted when Travis accused me of playing games, after all.Taking one last glance at myself in the mirror, guilt washed over me.Travis was trying so hard, and I was being a stubborn brat.I walked out into the living room and Travis smiled, not the reaction I expected at all.Youare beautiful.Thank you, I said, rattled by the absence of irritation or jealousy in his voice.Shepley whistled.Nice choice, Abby.Guys dig red.And the curls are gorgeous, America added.The doorbell chimed and America smiled, waving with exaggerated excitement.Have fun!I opened the door.Parker held a small bouquet of flowers, wearing slacks and a tie.His eyes did a quick once over, from my dress to my shoes and then back up.You are the most beautiful creature Ive ever seen, he said, enamored.I looked behind me to wave to America, whose smile was so wide I could see every one of her teeth.Shepley had the expression of a proud father, and Travis kept his eyes on the television.Parker held out his hand, leading me to his shiny Porsche.Once we were inside, he let out a puff of air.What?I asked.I have to say, I was a bit nervous about picking up the woman Travis Maddox is in love withfrom his apartment.You dont know how many people have accused me of insanity today.Travis is not in love with me.He can barely stand to be near me sometimes.Then its a love/hate relationship?Because when I broke it to my brothers that I was taking you out tonight, they all said the same thing.Hes been behaving so erratically  even more than usual that theyve all come to the same conclusion.Theyre wrong, I insisted.Parker shook his head as if I were utterly clueless.He rested his hand on mine.Wed better go.I have a table waiting.Where?Biasettis.I took a chanceI hope you like Italian.I raised one eyebrow.Wasnt it short notice for reservations?That place is always packed.Wellits our restaurant.Half, anyway.I like Italian, I smiled.Parker drove to the restaurant at exactly the speed limit, using his turn signal appropriately, and slowing at a reasonable rate for each yellow light.When he spoke, he barely took his eyes from the road.When we arrived at the restaurant, I giggled.What?he asked.Youre justa very cautious driver.Its a good thing.Different from the back of Travis motorcycle?he smiled.I should have laughed, but the difference didnt feel like a good thing.Lets not talk about Travis tonight.Okay?Fair enough, he said, leaving his seat to open my door.We were seated right away at a table by a large, bay window.Although I was in a dress, I looked impoverished compared to the other women in the restaurant.They were dripping in diamonds, and wearing cocktail dresses.Id never eaten anywhere so swanky.We ordered, and Parker closed his menu, smiling at the waiter.And bring us a bottle of the Allegrini Amarone, please.Yes, sir, the waiter said, taking our menus.This place is unbelievable, I whispered, leaning against the table.His green eyes softened.Thank you, Ill let my father know you think so.A woman approached our table.Her hair was pulled into a tight, blonde french bun, a gray streak interrupting the smooth wave of her bangs.I tried not to stare at the sparkling jewels resting around her neck, or those swaying back and forth on her ears, but they were made to be noticed.Her squinty, blue eyes targeted me.She quickly turned away to look at my date.Whos your friend, Parker?Mother, this is Abby Abernathy.Abby this is my mother, Vivienne Hayes.I extended my hand and she shook it once.In a well practiced move, interest lit the sharp features of her face, and she looked to Parker.Abernathy?I gulped, worried that she had recognized the name.Parkers expression turned impatient.Shes from Wichita, Mom.You dont know her family.She goes to Eastern.Oh?Vivienne eyed me again.Parker is leaving next year for Harvard.Thats what he said.I think thats great.You must be very proud.The tension around her eyes smoothed a bit, and the corners of her mouth turned up in a smug grin.We are.Thank you.I was amazed at how her words were so polite, and yet they dripped with insult.It wasnt a talent she had developed over night.Mrs.Hayes must have spent years impressing her superiority upon others.Its good to see you, Mom.Good night.She kissed his cheek, rubbed the lipstick off with her thumb and then returned to her table.Sorry about that, I didnt know she would be here.Its fine.She seemsnice.Parker laughed.Yes, for a piranha.I stifled a giggle, and he offered an apologetic smile.Shell warm up.It just takes her awhile.Hopefully by the time you leave for Harvard.We talked endlessly about the food, Eastern, calculus, and even about The Circle.Parker was charming, funny, and said all the right things.Various people approached Parker to greet him, and he always introduced me with a proud smile.He was regarded as a celebrity within the walls of the restaurant, and when we left, I felt the appraising eyes of everyone in the room.Now what?I asked.Im afraid I have a mid term in Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy first thing Monday morning.I have some studying to do, he said, covering my hand with his.Better you than me, I said, trying not to seem too disappointed.He drove to the apartment, and then led me up the stairs by the hand.Thank you, Parker, I smiled.I had a fantastic time.Is it too early to ask for a second date?Not at all, I beamed.Ill call you tomorrow?Sounds perfect.Then came the moment of awkward silence.The element of dates I dread.To kiss or not to kiss, I hated that question.Before I had a chance to wonder whether he would kiss me or not, he touched each side of my face and pulled me to him, pressing his lips against mine.They were soft and warm and wonderful.He pulled back once, and then kissed me again.Talk to you tomorrow, Abs.I waved, watching him walk down the steps to his car.Bye.Once again, when I turned the knob, the door yanked away and I fell forward.Travis caught me, and I regained my footing.Would you stop that?I said, closing the door behind me.Abs?What are you, a workout video?he sneered.Pigeon?I said with the same amount of disdain.An annoying bird that craps all over the sidewalk?You like Pigeon, he said defensively.Its a dove, an attractive girl, a winning card in poker, take your pick.Youre my Pigeon.I grabbed his arm to remove my heels, and then walked to his room.As I changed into my pajamas, I tried my best to stay mad at him.Travis sat on the bed and crossed his arms.Did you have a good time?I had, sigh, a fantastic time.A perfect time.Hes I couldnt think of an adequate word to describe him, so I just shook my head.He kissed you?I pressed my lips together and nodded.Hes got really soft lips.Travis recoiled.I dont care what kind of lips he has.Trust me, its important.I get so nervous with first kisses, too, but this one wasnt so bad.You get nervous about a kiss?he asked, amused.Just first kisses.I loathe them.Id loathe them, too, if I had to kiss Parker Hayes.I giggled and left for the bathroom to scrub the makeup from my face.Travis followed, leaning against the door jamb.So youre going out again?Yep.Hes calling me tomorrow.I dried my face and scampered down the hall, hopping into the bed.Travis stripped down to his boxers, and sat down with his back to me.A bit slumped over, he looked exhausted.The lean muscles of his back stretched as he did, and he glanced back at me for a moment.If you had such a good time, why are you home so early?He has a big test on Monday.Travis wrinkled his nose.Who cares?Hes trying to get into Harvard.He has to study.He huffed, crawling onto his stomach.I watched him shove his hands under his pillow, seeming irritated.Yeah, thats what he keeps telling everyone.Dont be an ass.He has prioritiesI think its responsible.Shouldnt his girl top his priorities?Im not his girl.Weve been on one date, Trav, I scolded.So what did you guys do?I shot him a dirty look and he laughed.What?Im curious!Seeing that he was sincere, I described everything, from the restaurant, to the food, to the sweet and funny things Parker said.I knew my mouth was frozen in a ridiculous grin, but I couldnt stop smiling while describing my perfect evening.Travis watched me with an amused smile while I blathered on, even asking questions.Although he seemed frustrated with the situation regarding Parker, I had the distinct feeling he enjoyed seeing me so happy.Travis settled in on his side of the bed, and I yawned.We stared at each other for a moment before he sighed.Im glad you had a good time, Pidge.You deserve it.Thanks, I grinned.The ringtone of my cell phone reverberated from the night table, and I jerked up to look at the display.Hello?Its tomorrow, Parker said.I looked at the clock and laughed.It was twelve oh one.It is.So what about Monday night?he asked.I covered my mouth for a moment, and then took a deep breath.Uh, yeah.Monday night is great.Good.Ill see you Monday, he said.I could hear the smile in his voice.I hung up and glanced at Travis, who watched with mild annoyance.I turned away from him and curled into a ball, tensing with excitement.Youre such a girl, Travis said, turning his back to me.I rolled my eyes and sighed.He turned over, pulling me to face him.You really like Parker?Dont ruin this for me, Travis!He stared at me for a moment, and then shook his head, turning away once again.Parker Hayes, he sighed.Monday nights date met my every expectation.We ate Chinese food while I giggled at Parkers skills with chopsticks.When he brought me home, Travis opened the door before he could kiss me.When we went out the following Wednesday night, Parker made sure to kiss me in the car.Thursday at lunch, Parker met me in the cafeteria and surprised everyone when he sat in Travis spot.When Travis finished his cigarette and came inside, he walked past Parker with indifference, sitting at the end of the table.Megan approached him, but was instantly disappointed when he waved her off.Everyone at the table was quiet after that, and I found it difficult to focus on anything Parker talked about.Im assuming I just wasnt invited, Parker said, catching my attention.What?I heard your birthday party is on Sunday.I wasnt invited?America peeked at Travis, who glared at Parker as if he was seconds away from mowing him down.It was a surprise party, Parker, America said softly.Oh, Parker said, cringing.Youre throwing me a surprise party?I asked America.She shrugged.It was Travs idea.Its at Brazils on Sunday.Six oclock.Parkers cheeks flushed a faint red.I suppose Im really not invited, now.No!Of course you are!I said, holding his hand on top of the table.Twelve pairs of eyes zeroed in on our hands.I could see that Parker was just as uncomfortable with the attention as I was, so I let go and pulled my hands onto my lap.Parker stood up.I have a few things I need to do before class.Ill call you later.Okay, I said, offering an apologetic smile.Parker leaned over the table and kissed my lips.The silence was cafeteria wide, and America elbowed me after Parker walked out.Isnt it creepy how everyone watches you?she whispered.She glanced around the room with a frown.What?America yelled.Mind your business, perverts!One by one, heads turned away, and murmuring ensued.I covered my eyes with my hands.You know, before I was pathetic because I was thought to be Travis poor clueless girlfriend.Now Im evil because everyone thinks Im bouncing back and forth between Travis and Parker like a ping pong ball.When America didnt comment, I looked up.What?Dont tell me youre buying into that crap, too!I didnt say anything!she said.I stared at her in disbelief.But thats what you think?America shook her head, but she didnt speak.The icy stares from the other students were suddenly apparent, and I stood up, walking to the end of the table.We need to talk, I said, tapping Travis shoulder.I tried to sound polite, but the anger bubbling inside me put an edge to my words.The entire student populace, including my best friend, thought I was juggling two men.There was only one solution.So talk, Travis said, popping something breaded and fried in his mouth.I fidgeted, noticing the curious eyes of everyone within earshot.When Travis still didnt move, I grabbed his arm and gave it a good tug.He stood up and followed me outside with a grin on his face.What, Pidge?he said, looking at my hand on his arm and then at me.Youve got to let me out of the bet, I begged.His face fell.You want to leave?Why?Whatd I do?You didnt do anything, Trav.Havent you noticed everyone staring?I am quickly becoming the pariah of Eastern U.   Travis shook his head and lit a cigarette.Not my problem.Yes, it is.Parker said everyone thinks he has a death wish because youre in love with me.Travis eyebrows shot up and he choked on the puff of smoke hed just inhaled.People are saying that?he said between coughs.I nodded.He looked away with wide eyes, taking another drag.Travis!You have to release me from the bet!I cant date Parker and live with you at the same time.It looks terrible!So quit dating Parker.I glared at him.Thats not the problem and you know it.Is that the only reason you want to leave?Because of what people are saying?At least before I was clueless and you were the bad guy, I grumbled.Answer the question, Pidge.Yes!Travis looked beyond me to the students entering and leaving the cafeteria.He was deliberating, and I grew impatient while he took his time making his decision.Finally, he stood tall, resolved.No.I shook my head, sure that I had misunderstood.Excuse me?No.You said so yourself: a bets a bet.After the months up, youll be off with Parker, hell become a doctor, youll get married and have your two point five children and Ill never see you again.He grimaced at his own words.I still have three weeks.Im not giving that up for lunch room gossip.I looked through the glass window to see the entire cafeteria watching us.The unwelcome attention made my eyes burn.I shouldered passed him to walk to my next class.Pigeon, Travis called after me.I didnt turn around.That night, America sat on the tile floor of the bathroom, babbling about the boys while I stood in front of the mirror and pulled my hair into a ponytail.I was only half listening, thinking about how patient Travis had been  for Travis  knowing he didnt like the idea of Parker picking me up from his apartment every other night.The expression on Travis face flashed in my mind when I asked him to let me out of the bet, and again when I told him people were saying he was in love with me.I couldnt stop wondering why he didnt deny it.Well, Shep thinks youre being too hard on him.Hes never had anyone hes cared enough to,  Travis poked his head in and smiled as he watched me fuss with my hair.Wanna grab dinner?he asked.America stood up to look at herself in the mirror, combing her fingers through her golden hair.Shep wants to check out that new Mexican place downtown if you guys wanna go.Travis shook his head.I thought me and Pidge could go alone tonight.Im going out with Parker.Again?he said, annoyed.Again, I said in a sing song voice.The door bell rang, and I hurried past Travis to open the door.Parker stood in front of me, his naturally wavy blonde hair sitting atop his cleanly shaven face.Do you ever look less than gorgeous?Parker asked.Based on the first time she came over here, Im going to say yes, Travis said from behind me.I rolled my eyes and smiled, holding up a finger to Parker to signal him to wait.I turned and threw my arms around Travis.He stiffened with surprise and then relaxed, pulling me tight against him.I looked into his eyes and smiled.Thanks for organizing my birthday party.Can I take a rain check on dinner?A dozen emotions scrolled across Travis face, and then the corners of his mouth turned up.Tomorrow?I squeezed him and grinned.Absolutely.I waved to him as Parker grabbed my hand.What was that about?Parker asked.We havent been getting along lately.That was my version of an olive branch.Should I be worried?he asked, opening my door.No, I smiled, kissing his cheek.At dinner, Parker talked about Harvard, and the House, and his plans to search for an apartment.His eyebrows pulled in.Will Travis be escorting you to your birthday party?Im not really sure.He hasnt said anything about it.If he doesnt mind, Id like to take you.He took my hand in his and kissed my fingers.Ill ask him.The party was his idea, so.I understand.If not, Ill just see you there, he smiled.Parker took me to the apartment, slowing to a stop in the parking lot.When he kissed me goodbye, his lips lingered on mine.He yanked up the parking brake as his lips traveled along the ridge of my jaw to my ear, and then half way down my neck.It took me off guard, and I let out a quiet sigh in response.You are so beautiful, he whispered.Ive been distracted all night, with your hair pulled away from your neck.He peppered my neck with kisses and I exhaled, a hum escaping with my breath.What took you so long?I smiled, lifting my chin to give him better access.Parker focused on my lips.He grabbed each side of my face, kissing me a bit firmer than usual.We didnt have much room in the car, but we made the space available work to our advantage.He leaned against me, and I bent my knee as I fell against the window.His tongue slipped inside my mouth, and his hand grabbed my ankle, and then slid up my leg to my thigh.The windows fogged within minutes with our labored breath, sticking to the cool windows.His lips grazed my collarbone, and then his head jerked up when the glass vibrated with several loud thumps.Parker sat up, and I righted myself, adjusting my dress.I jumped when the door flew open.Travis and America stood beside the car.America wore a sympathetic frown, and Travis seemed just short of flying into a blind rage.What the hell, Travis?Parker yelled.The situation suddenly felt dangerous.Id never heard Parker raise his voice, Travis knuckles were white as he balled them into fists at his sides  and I was in the way.Americas hand seemed tiny when she placed it on Travis bulky arm, shaking her head at Parker in silent warning.Cmon, Abby.I need to talk to you, she said.About what?Just come on!she snapped.I looked to Parker, seeing the irritation in his eyes.Im sorry, I have to go.No, its fine.Go ahead.Travis helped me from the Porsche, and then kicked the door shut.I flipped around and stood between him and the car, shoving his shoulder.What is wrong with you?Knock it off!America seemed nervous.It didnt take long to figure out why.Travis reeked of whiskey; she had insisted on accompanying him, or hed asked her to come.Either way she was a deterrent to violence.The wheels of Parkers shiny Porsche squealed out of the parking lot, and Travis lit a cigarette.You can go in, now, Mare.She tugged on my skirt.Cmon, Abby.Why dont you stay, Abs, he seethed.I nodded for America to go ahead and she reluctantly complied.I crossed my arms, ready for a fight, preparing myself to lash out at him after the inevitable lecture.Travis took several drags from his cigarette, and when it was obvious that he wasnt going to explain, my patience ran out.Why did you do that?I asked.Why?Because he was mauling you in front of my apartment!he yelled.His eyes were unfocused, and I could see that he was incapable of rational conversation.I kept my voice calm.I may be staying with you, but what I do, and who I do it with is my business.He flicked his cigarette to the ground.Youre so much better than that, Pidge.Dont let him fuck you in a car like a cheap prom date.I wasnt going to have sex with him!He gestured to the empty space where Parkers car sat.What were you doing, then?Havent you ever made out with someone, Travis?Havent you just messed around without letting it get that far?He frowned and shook his head as if I was speaking gibberish.Whats the point in that?The concept exists for a lot of peopleespecially those that date.The windows were all fogged up, the car was bouncinghow was I supposed to know?he said, waving his arms in the direction of the empty parking slot.Maybe you shouldnt spy on me!He rubbed his face and shook his head.I cant stand this, Pigeon.I feel like Im going crazy.I threw out my hands and let them hit my thighs.You cant stand what?If you sleep with him, I dont wanna know about it.Ill go to prison for a long time if I find out hejust dont tell me.Travis, I seethed.I cant believe you just said that!Thats a big step for me!Thats what all girls say!I dont mean the sluts you deal with!I mean me!I said, holding my hand to my chest.I haventugh!Never mind.I walked away from him, but he grabbed my arm, twirling me around to face him.You havent what?he asked, weaving a bit.I didnt answer  I didnt have to.I could see the recognition light up his face and he laughed once.Youre a virgin?So what?I said, the blood under my cheeks igniting.His eyes drifted from mine, in and out of focus as he tried to think through the whisky.Thats why America was so sure it wouldnt get too far.I had the same boyfriend all four years of high school.He was an aspiring Baptist youth minister!It never came up!Travis anger vanished, and relief was apparent in his eyes.A youth minister?What happened after all that hard earned abstinence?He wanted to get married and stay inKansas.I didnt.I was desperate to change the subject.The amusement in Travis eyes was humiliating enough.I didnt want him digging further into my past.He took a step toward me and held each side of my face.A virgin, he said, shaking his head.I would have never guessed with the way you danced at the Red.Very funny, I said, stomping up the stairs.Travis attempted to follow me, but tripped and fell, rolling onto his back and laughing hysterically.What are you doing?Get up!I said, helping him to his feet.He hooked his arm around my neck, and I helped him up the stairs.Shepley and America were already in bed, so with no help in sight, I kicked off my heels to avoid breaking my ankles while walking Travis to the bedroom.He fell on his back to the bed, pulling me with him.When we landed, my face was just inches from his.His expression was suddenly serious.He leaned up, nearly kissing me, but I pushed him away.Travis eyebrows pulled in.Knock it off, Trav, I said.He held me tight against him until I quit struggling, and then he flicked the strap of my dress, causing it to hang off my shoulder.Since the word virgin came out of those beautiful lips of yoursI have a sudden urge to help you out of that dress.Well, thats too bad.You were ready to kill Parker for the same thing twenty minutes ago, so dont be a hypocrite.Fuck Parker.He doesnt know you like I do.Trav, cmon.Lets get your clothes off and get you in bed.Thats what Im talkin about, he chuckled.How much did you drink?I asked, finally getting my footing between his legs.Enough, he smiled, pulling at the hem of my dress.You probably surpassed enough a gallon ago, I said, slapping his hand away.I planted my knee on the mattress beside him, and pulled his shirt over his head.He reached for me again and I grabbed his wrist, sniffing at the pungent stench in the air.God, Trav, you reek of Jack Daniels.Jim Beam, he corrected with a drunken nod.It smells like burnt wood and chemicals.It tastes like it, too, he laughed.I pulled open his belt buckle and yanked it from the loops.He laughed with the jerking motion, and then lifted his head to look at me.Better guard your virginity, Pidge.You know I like it rough.Shut up, I said, unbuttoning his jeans, slipping them down over his hips, and then off his legs.I threw the denim to the floor and stood with my hands on my hips, breathing hard.His legs were hanging off the end of the bed, his eyes closed, and his breathing deep and heavy.He had passed out.I took a deep breath and walked over the closet, shaking my head as I rifled through our clothes.I unzipped my dress and shoved it down over my hips, letting it fall to my ankles.Kicking it into the corner, I pulled my ponytail holder from my hair, shaking my hair out.The closet was bursting with his clothes and mine, and I puffed, blowing my hair from my face as I searched through the mess for a t shirt.As I pulled one off the hanger, Travis slammed into my back, wrapping his arms around my waist.You scared the shit outta me!I complained.He ran his hands over my skin.I noticed they felt different; slow and deliberate.I closed my eyes when he pulled me against him and buried his face in my hair, nuzzling my neck.Feeling his bare skin against mine, it took me a moment to protest.Travis,  He pulled my hair to one side and grazed his lips along my back from one shoulder to the other, unsnapping the clasp of my bra.He kissed the bare skin at the base of my neck and I closed my eyes, the warm softness of his mouth felt too good to make him stop.A quiet moan escaped from his throat when he pressed his pelvis against mine, and I could feel how much he wanted me through his boxers.I held my breath, knowing the only thing keeping us from that big step I was so opposed to a few moments before was two thin pieces of fabric.Travis turned me to face him, and then pressed against me, leaning my back against the wall.Our eyes met, and I could see the ache in his expression as he scanned the bare pieces of my skin.I had seen him peruse women before, but this was different.He didnt want to conquer me; he wanted me to say yes.He leaned in to kiss me, stopping just an inch away.I could feel the heat from his skin radiating against my lips, and I had to stop myself from drawing him in the rest of the way.His fingers were digging into my skin as he deliberated, and then his hands slid from my back to the hem of my panties.His index fingers slid down my hips, in between my skin and the lacey fabric, and in the same moment that he was about to slip the delicate threads down my legs, he hesitated.Just when I opened my mouth to say yes, he clenched his eyes shut.Not like this, he whispered, brushing his lips across mine.I want you, but not like this.He stumbled backwards, falling against the bed to his back, and I stood for a moment with my arms crossed across my stomach.When his breathing evened out, I shoved my arms through the shirt I still had in my hand, and yanked it over my head.Travis didnt move, and I blew out a slow breath of air, knowing I couldnt restrain either of us if I crawled in bed and he woke up with a less honorable perspective.I hurried to the recliner and collapsed into it, covering my face with my hands.I felt the layers of frustration dancing and crashing into each other inside of me.Parker had left feeling slighted, Travis waited until I was seeing someone  someone I truly liked  to show an interest in me, and I seemed to be the only girl he couldnt bring himself to sleep with, even when he was wasted.The next morning, I poured orange juice into a tall glass, and took a sip as I bobbed my head to the music playing from my IPod.Id woken before the sun, and then squirmed in the recliner until eight.After that, I decided to clean up the kitchen to pass the time until my less ambitious roommates awoke.I loaded the dishwasher and swept and mopped, and then wiped the counters down.When the kitchen was sparkling, I grabbed the basket of clean clothes and sat on the couch, folding until there were a dozen or more piles surrounding me.Murmuring came from Shepleys room.America giggled and then it was quiet for a few minutes more, followed by noises that made me feel a bit uncomfortable sitting alone in the living room.I stacked the piles of folded clothes in the basket and carried it to Travis room, smiling when I saw that he hadnt moved from the way he had fallen the night before.I set the basket down and pulled the blanket over him, stifling a laugh when he turned over.View, Pigeon, he said, mumbling something inaudible before his breathing returned to slow and deep.I couldnt help but watch him sleep; knowing he was dreaming about me sent a thrill through my veins that I couldnt explain.Travis lay silent, so I to take a shower, hoping the sound of someone up and around would quiet Shepley and Americas moans and the creaking and banging of the bed against the wall.When I turned off the water, I realized they werent worried about who could hear.I combed my hair, rolling my eyes at Americas high pitched yelps, more closely resembling a poodle than a porn star.The door bell rang, and I grabbed my blue terry cloth robe and tightened the belt, jogging across the living room floor.The noises from Shepleys bedroom immediately cut off, and I opened the door to Parkers smiling face.Good morning, he said.I raked my wet hair back with my fingers.What are you doing here?I didnt like the way we said goodbye last night.I went out this morning to get your birthday present, and I couldnt wait to give it to you.So, he said, pulling a shiny box from his jacket pocket, happy birthday, Abs.He set the silver package in my hand, and I leaned in to kiss his cheek.Thank you.Go ahead.I want to see your face when you open it.I slipped my finger under the tape on the underside of the box, and then pulled the paper off, handing it to him.A rope of shimmering diamonds sat snuggly in a white gold bracelet.Parker, I whispered.He beamed.You like it?I do, I said holding it in front of my face in awe, but its too much.I couldnt accept this if wed been dating a year, much less a week.Parker grimaced.I thought you might say that.I searched high and low all morning for the perfect birthday present, and when I saw this, I knew there was only one place it could ever belong, he said, taking it from my fingers and clasping it around my wrist.And I was right.It looks incredible on you.I held up my wrist and shook my head, hypnotized by the brilliance of colors reacting to the sunlight.Its the most beautiful thing Ive ever seen.No ones ever given me anything so, expensive came to mind, but I didnt want to say that, elaborate.I dont know what to say.Parker laughed, and then kissed my cheek.Say that youll wear it tomorrow.I grinned from ear to ear.Ill wear it tomorrow, I said, looking to my wrist.Im glad you like it.The look on your face was worth the seven stores I went to.I sighed.You went to seven stores?He nodded, and I took his face in my hands.Thank you.Its perfect, I said, kissing him quickly.He hugged me tight.I have to get back.
