This was not how Tara Jean Sweet imagined her engagement.Perched on the edge of her eighty nine year old fiancs wheelchair wearing a skirt so short there was a good chance the photographer was getting a shot of her uterus.But at the top of the very long list of what was wrong with this picture were the cows.There were ten of the hulking, stinky animals, handpicked by Lyle Baker himself to be as much a part of her engagement photo as his ten gallon hat and the big blue sky backdrop of Crooked Creek Ranch.Look at me!the cows saidmetaphorically of course.Look at me, Im so damn rich.As a young girl, planning her dream engagement, there hadnt been many cows.None, really.She tugged on her pink leather skirt, but Lyle lifted his trembling hand to stop her.Leave it, he gasped, refusing to wear the oxygen for the photos, a decision that was probably pinching precious minutes off his very short remaining life span.But he was the boss so she didnt nag about the oxygen, tried to ignore the cow lowing in her ear, and left the skirt alone.Sighing, she curled her upper body around Lyle as best she could without bumping into the various monitors and wires that ran off him as if he were a supercomputer.Smile, baby, his voice an agonized whisper.A flash popped and she turned up the wattage of her smile, getting as much teeth and as little brain behind it as she could.She knew the drill.Had been living it for four years.From the fur lining on his wheelchair, Lyle pulled a cigar the size of her forearm.She plucked it away from him.Youve got to be kidding.Give it back.The words wheezed past his cracked lips.As your bride, her smile was sharp, letting him know the game worked both ways, I must insist.The photographer laughed and Lyles scowl faded away, replaced by a calculating smile.You think this is gonna work?She laid a hand on the old mans papery cheek.He was so smooth; age and disease had turned him into a river stone.How did we get here?she wondered, sadness a dark lining to her victory.Lyle turned toward her with obvious effort and she saw his runny eyes glittering.Nothing like a devious plan to get the old mans heart pumping.Watch em come running.Luc Baker stepped out of the team doctors office into a vipers nest of reporters.Camera flashes exploded in his face.Holy shit.Beside him, his teammate, Billy Wilkins, who had waited for Luc after his physio appointment, winced at the blinding lights on the video cameras.Luc didnt even blink.Twenty years in the NHL, the last seven in Toronto; vipers were part of the job.And right now the vipers nest was well and truly stirred.Ice Man!the reporters yelled, using Lucs nickname.Is it true youre having extensive brain surgery?Is it true you have brain damage?Are the Cavaliers going to buy out your contract?Luc smiled and lifted his hands, calming the seething knot of parasites in front of him, like a priest before a congregation.Luc?Jim Muggs, from the Toronto Star, cut through the chatter.What did the doctor say?Scar tissue on your frontal lobe.Possible brain eating protein.Increased chances of lasting cognitive damage.For a second, Lucs vision went red and his instinct was to grab Billys crutch and clear a path of cracked skulls and broken camera equipment, just to avoid answering that question.Dr.Matthews says Im good to go next year, he lied, forcing his lips to curl into a smile.Im ready to work hard in the off season and bring the cup back to Toronto.Brain damage?Billy swiveled around on his crutches, stepping slightly in front of Luc.I swear to God, you guys are worse gossips than my grandmas church group Dr.Matthews also said, Luc interrupted with a smile and he felt the sharp focus of every lens, that I needed to hurry up and get my personal guard back on the ice.He clapped a hand on Billys shoulder, and everyone laughed.Gilcot never would have gotten close to Luc if Billy hadnt blown out his knee in game three of the finals.Gilcots been suspended for the first three games of next season.Do you think thats reasonable?Muggs asked.Gilcot rang my bell.Luc shrugged, downplaying the injury.Its not like were having a tea party out there.But the truth was, hits like Gilcots and concussions like Lucs were at a crisis point in the NHL.A couple of the reporters laughed and the atmosphere in the viper pit changed.He had them right where he wanted them.This interview crap wasnt any different from controlling the tempo of a game.And no one controlled tempo like Luc Baker.Dr.Matthews is leading a study on the effects of repeated head trauma on professional athletes.Will you be a part of it?Muggs asked.Luc nearly jerked, the question a razor blade against his belly.Him and a bunch of drooling, early onset Alzheimer linebackers from the NFL?No thanks.Matthews had asked, but Luc had rejected the idea.Just as hed rejected everything Matthews said during the extensive exam.Retire.Get out while youre ahead.No, he said.Dr.Matthewss work is important for the future of athletes in professional sports, but it has nothing to do with me right now.Luc takes one bad hit and you guys are ready to make him a head case just to get a headline, Billy said.Its sick.Luc squeezed Billys shoulder, appreciating his loyalty, but Billy didnt know the whole story.But it wasnt just one bad hit, was it?a womans voice piped up and Lucs control buckled slightly.The rarely seen beast of his temper shook itself awake.Adelaide Eggers, of course.She was the worst of the bunch, like a bulldog, from years of having to prove herself in the Junior A locker rooms all across the Northwest Territories.A guy couldnt hide from Addie Eggers.Couldnt bluff her with a joke and a juicy quote.As a kid you participated in peewee Rodeo in Texas.You sustained multiple blackout concussions, am I right?They called you the Knockout Kid.Adelaide.He smiled into the flashes, absorbing them like he would a controlled slide into the boards.You need to get a life outside of Google.The reporters laughed and he saw a lot of bent heads.The Knockout Kid would make the top ten list of terrible athlete nicknames tomorrow morning on TSN.Billy glanced sideways at him.Rodeo?Great.Now he knew the whole story.It was a long time ago, he said to everyone.Im fine.My head is fine.Except for the brain eating protein.Were ready to put this season behind us.Again, he rested his hand on Billys shoulder, and just like that the pack was thrown off the scent of his concussion and onto Billy and his knee.Billy, how is physio going?Adelaide asked.Is it true youll be out most of next year?Hell no.Billy got a little reckless with one of his crutches, about to use it as a bat against the ankles of the nearest ESPN cameraman.Six months recovery.Tops.Ill be back before the second half next year.Six months recovery for a man half your age.Addie raised a killing eyebrow.Why dont you guys go back to giving him a hard time?Billy jerked a thumb back at Luc.Dont bring me into this.You are the oldest man in the league, Addie said to Luc.Thirty seven is I know how old I am.You dont think about retiring?Not without winning the cup for Toronto first.Luc got knocked out at the end of the third period of game seven in the finals.The Bull Dogs were able to tie it up and The Cavaliers lost in a shootout.Theyd been close.So damn close.If he and Billy hadnt been laid up, hed be drinking out of the cup right now, instead of answering questions no one should be asking him.What do you think of your chances next year?Addie asked.Well, if we can keep everyone healthy, I think our chances are great.And after that?Addie asked, a sly grin on her face.Matthews couldnt give him any concrete proof that he had this Tav protein, or even would have it.So he had a buildup of scar tissue on his frontal lobe?There wasnt a pro athlete who didnt, except for maybe the baseball players.But the increased chances of future concussions was going to be a problem when his contract was up.Post concussion syndrome wasnt something anyone wanted to have.And he had it.And it was documented.The league was getting twitchy about head injuries.Lindros and his glass jaw had changed the game.And that was before Sidney Crosbys concussion made global headlines.No one wanted to take a chance on a guy who couldnt take a hit without getting knocked cold.All that aside, if Luc wasnt thirty seven years old, standing at the edge of his contract, the word retire wouldnt have even passed Matthewss lips.Hed accused Matthews of that, but the old man had disagreed.Said hed seen too many athletes burn themselves out, damage themselves beyond repair in pursuit of the dream.The damage a second concussion would do to your brain will end your career.Youd better pray you dont get another concussion and youd better pray you dont get traded.Without Billy Wilkins chasing guys down, its open season on you.This is your last year in the league.This next year was the year he was born to play, on the team hed helped create.He was going to make history.Oldest man in the NHL, bringing the cup back to a city that hadnt seen it in over fifty years.No one, not even his old man, could look at that and call it nothing.Ice Man?Adelaide said when he didnt answer her question.Your contract is up after next year, are you planning on going free agent?After that, Im done.His heart burned as he said it, but that was the agreement: rest, recoup, finish the contract and get out.Reporters hummed at the news, practically vibrating at the unsolicited retirement announcement.Come on, Billy scoffed.Any team will want you for a few more years.Look at Gary Roberts.Ray Bourque.Theres always room on a team for experience.Hell, someone should hire you just to teach Lashenko how to play the damn game.All the reporters laughed.Billy and Lashenko had a blood feud that had started in the Olympics three years ago.Acid burned in Lucs dry stomach.He wished he could agree.He wished he had two, three more years in him.He wished he could ride out his career for as long as he couldhell, hed even go to Europe, play there until his body gave out.But his bodynot even his body, his brain of all thingswas giving out on him.Were done here, he said, holding on to his anger, hiding it like a weakness that would eat him from the inside out.The reporters fired more questions at him, but he held up his hand and cut through the crowd like a knife.His life would be over in a year.An hour later, Luc slid the key into the lock of his penthouse apartment and suddenly remembered that his home was not his own, and peace and quiet were probably not going to happen here.But before he could take the key out and go over to Billys house, or find some dark bar on Front Street, the door swung open, revealing his sister, Victoria Schulman, looking about as tense and thin as a piano wire.Hey, he said, accepting his fate and stepping inside.He loved his sister, adored her and her son Jacob, but trying to ignore the panic that she was so hopeless at hiding was exhausting.Vicks, he thought, not for the first time, just let me help you.It was only money after all, and he had plenty of it.Wheres Jacob?He looked over Victorias thin shoulder for his seven year old nephew.Luc had been carrying a whoopee cushion in his coat pocket for about a week and he kept forgetting to give it to him.Dannys, she said, her fingers nearly crushing a white envelope.He shrugged out of his coat and dumped it onto the chair he kept by the door for just that reason.But she made that little coughing sound in her throat and with a sigh, he picked it back up.She opened the closet door and handed him a hanger, as if she were the hostess of a party hed been invited to attend.In his own house.She did that sort of stuff all the time; announced dinner menus as though foreign dignitaries were about to sit down and eat chili with them.There were even flowers in his house.Everywhere.Pink ones in vases hed never seen before.Being the Queen of Manhattan Society hadnt prepared her to be a penniless guest in her brothers home.Her husband, Joel the Jackass, had ripped away the only life the woman was capable of living with any comfort.Made him want to beat the guy to a pulp for putting his sister in this position.But Joel had handled that himself a year agowith a bullet to his brain.Luc took the hanger from her.You dont need to do this stuff, he told her, trying to keep his patience.Im just trying to help She caught herself and smiled, holding up her hands.Okay.So, he said, hanging up his coat and closing the closet door.Her stress was like smoke in the air and he wanted to clear it.Everything okay?We need to talk.She stuck out the crushed envelope.What is it?She shook the envelope at him.Justlook at it.Swallowing his sigh, he slid two pieces of paper out, one big, the other smaller.He flipped over the smaller one.Youve got to be kidding, he muttered, staring at the picture of his eighty nine year old father, surrounded by the Angus cattle he adored so damn much, with a blonde wearing pink leather, and not much of it, draped across his wheelchair.She looks like a blow up sex doll, he said, and Victoria laughed.Thats what I thought.For a second the tension dissipated, but then it surged back like a high tide.Read the other one.He flipped over the big piece of paper and it took him a second to realize he was staring at a wedding invitation.His father was marrying the sex doll, whose name was Tara Jean Sweet.Who the hell had a name like that?Porn stars, thats who.Strippers.The blessed event was happening next month at Crooked Creek Ranch.Pig roast to follow.Time slowed for Luc, the way it did when he was in that sweet spot behind the net, the ice open in front of him.He could see every move in every players head and outsmart them all.The bastard was getting married.Funny, he had never seen that coming.Its a joke, right?Victoria asked.It has to be.He shoved the invitation and that ridiculous picture back in the envelope.Tara Jean Sweet.Please.Who cares?He tossed the envelope on the hutch in the foyer.It slid right off, landing on the floor, and he didnt bother to pick it up.But Victoria scrambled to grab it.Who cares?Victoria followed him when he took off down the hallway toward the living room.I care, Luc.You shouldnt.He pulled loose his tie, then tossed his coat across the white couch some designer had picked out for him.No doubt Vicks was going nuts at the negligence, but he didnt care.Didnt he disown you?No.I meanI dont think so.He just kicked me out.Christ, his head hurt.That money.Her voice was climbing the rafters; the neighbors dogs were going to go berserk in a second.I need The sighweary and impatientslipped from his mouth before he could stop it and she closed her mouth, pinching her lips together.The gray day outside the wall of floor to ceiling windows suited him.The traffic jam on Yonge Street matched his frustrated mood.He just could not catch a break.You dont need anything from him.He tried to sound like a never ending well of patience, a beacon of gentle understanding, but it was a total lie and Vicks knew it.We have nothing.Her voice creaked like an old floor tired of all the weight.Jacob and I I can take care of you and Jacob.Ive told you that.I dont want your charity.But youll take that bastards?Youll take money from him?I earned that money.She lifted her chin.We both did.Being that mans child was a job.Those summers I want nothing from Lyle.End of that discussion.He stepped into the cream and black kitchenagain some designers sense of masculineand pulled open the stainless steel fridge to get a beer.He felt her eyes on him as he paced and drank, trapped in sophisticated clothes and an ugly kitchen.You could get a job, he offered.Hell, Id pay you to redecorate this condo.A job?she asked as if hed suggested she become a hit man.He didnt understand this attitude of hers, as if work were something totally out of reach.She had jobs before.Not great ones but, shed worked.I have no qualifications or experience.Im not sure my designer did, either.This isnt funny!Im not laughing.Im trying to get rid of this stupid idea I can see in your head.I need the money.Vicks, maybe if you hadnt given it all to the lawyers I couldnt keep that money.Funny how strong her voice was now, how resolute.Joel stole from those people.Bankrupted some of them I know, I get it.I do.But, Christ, youre stubborn.She smiled slightly.I learned it from my big brother.He sighed, bracing his hands against the counter.She was going to go down to Texas and take on their fatherher intentions were a neon billboard all over her pale face.We should at least find out if its really true.Youre going to call Dad?He laughed and pulled out his cell phone.Better, he said.Im going to call his keeper.He hit speed dial before holding the phone up to his ear.Maman, he said with a smile.A year ago, Victoria had had her pride shoved down her throat by her husband and as humiliating and awful as that experience had been, as soul crushing and horrifying, it freed her from pride.From hubris.From everything in her life except Jacob.In return, it gave her clarity.A worldview that was based on survival.Shed earned her inheritance.She needed it.And there was simply no way a woman named Tara Jean Sweet was going to take it away from her.Victoria carefully pushed herself into one of the terribly uncomfortable bar stools that lined the kitchen counter.Luc was on the phone with Celeste, his mother and Lyles ex wife, who paid lawyers a lot of money to stay on top of the old man and make his life miserable.If anyone could find out if this was a joke, it was Celeste.Luc ran a hand through his dark hair, rubbing a spot on his forehead as if something under the skin was bothering him.Hed been doing that a lot lately, and shed started to wonder if that hit he took in the last game had done some serious damage.Non.Non.His laugh was a revelation and it made her smile.French wasnt a language they shared.Because her own mother, Lyles mistress, had been a bored New Yorker with an appetite for self destruction and Celeste had been an elegant and snobby French Canadian model.In those long and bleak summers she and Luc had shared in Texas, learning to hate their father, the half part of their relationship had become irrelevant.They were born eighteen months apart and they might as well have been twins.Lucs conversation grew terse.His hands were white knuckled around the phone and the neck of his beer, and Victorias stomach sank with a sick gurgle into the soles of her feet.Not a joke.Luc hung up, and Victoria felt herself begin to fray and snap.She smoothed the hem of her gray wool skirt with shaking fingersas if that would help.As if all that stood between her and a life of security was a wrinkled hem.Its true, isnt it?she asked, not quite able to look her brother in the eye.She wished she were a different woman.Better able to care for herself and her son.But she wasnt.She was Victoria Schulman and right now, she needed her fathers inheritance.Its true, he said.Maman was notified by her lawyer that Dad changed his will two weeks ago.If he marries thatwoman, she inherits everything.His eyes were so pitying and she couldnt pretend not to see it.And Ill lose everything.Im not going back there, Vicks, he said through clenched teeth.His shoulders curled and bunched as if he wanted to hurl the beer bottle across the room.I havent been back there in twenty years and I dont give a shit who he marries, or if hes dying.Im not going back.Im not asking you to.But she was.Oh, she was.And he knew it; her act didnt convince anyone, least of all her brother.Youve done enough.Ill go alone.Right, he scoffed.You down there with himby yourself?Someone will get killed.It might be Bimbo Barbie, she said with a smile.Luc laughed through his nose and it took a few minutes, but she saw his mind change, just like shed known it would.If there was one thing she could count on in this world, it was her brother.And that I gotta see, he said.Relief that she didnt have to be strong fizzed through her body like cheap, too sweet champagne.Luc picked up his phone.But first we need to find out everything we can about this Tara Jean woman.You still have the number for that private investigator?The purpose in Luc filled her, too, and she shoved off the stool to go find her purse and Gary Thieles card.When the lawsuits started rolling in after Joels suicide, shed hired a P. I.  to weed out the fraudulent ones.She handed the worn card to her brother, who grabbed her cold fingers in his warm palm.His dark eyes, so like their fathers, were warm with affection and pity, a combination she hated but had grown used to.Well get you your inheritance, Vicks.I promise.Thank God.Tara Jean Sweet was driven by a demon.A white trash demon standing in twelve dollar stilettos.Shorter!the demon screamed, and Tara flipped her pencil and erased the hem on the sketch, redrawing it a few millimeters higher.More pink.Pinker.And fringe!Lots of fringe.Oh, the demon cooed, sucking on a Virginia Slimbedazzle it.Come on, really?Tara muttered, staring down at the sketch of the last skirt for Baker Leathers fall line.It was short, pink, and fringed.Whats more I said bedazzle it!Fine, she muttered, amending the sketch and making notes in the corresponding notebook.The demon, for all her faults, knew what the leather wearing woman wanted, down to a very uncomfortable line of thongs.As muses went, the demon was a bitch.But she was never wrong.Tara spread out the sketches, the short skirts, the tight pants, the bustiers and feminine biker jackets.Boots and shoes.Belts and earrings.Purses.Bags.Fifty new products for the five hundred Baker Leather stores in Texas and Oklahoma.They looked good.The demon earned her spot in Tara Jeans head.She took a handful of Mike and Ikes, picking out the yellows because yellow washed her out and shed been taking the yellows out for over twenty years.One by one, she popped the rest in her mouth.From the bottom drawer of her two drawer filing cabinet, she pulled out three thick files and sorted through the sketches from the last three years, deciding which ones would be brought back for the fall line.She decided on the black duster with the red feather trim.Popular on Halloween.She also kept the suede mittens with the fur lining and matching hata perennial favorite.The blouse with the pretty heart cutouts on the collar.She imagined librarians who thought themselves edgy bought that one.Her demon nodded in agreement.The last sketch was an old one, three years according to the date stamp on the back.The paper was faded, the brown rim of an old coffee cup stain on the top corner.Her first design.The one that had turned her life and Baker Leather all the way around.The pink calfskin cowboy boot with the tooled leather, one and a half inch heel, and delicate metal toe.She shook out the box of Mike and Ikes but there was nothing but yellow.So ugly, she thought, but she ate them anyway.In three months, at the end of July, she had a meeting with the Region Four Nordstrom buyer about possibly getting her boots in Nordstrom all across the southeastern United States.It would beTara blinked, trying to find a word for it.She hadnt grown up with dreams of designing.She was utterly unmoved by pink cowboy boots.But the moneythat she had dreamed of.Growing up in a trailer on the far side of Nowhere, Arkansas, shed dreamed of money like it was Prince Charming coming to save her from the cigarette stink and beer stained filth shed been born in.It was simple.The Nordstrom deal meant freedom.Shed sold her soul to cement it; now she just had to deliver.Ya welcome, the demon cackled.Thanks, Momma, Tara whispered.The demon was a mixed blessing, here to help after a lifetime of neglecting Tara when she needed her mother the most.She chose to ignore the deeply psychotic nature of it all.Tara sighed and stretched, rolling her neck, staring up through the glass panels of the renovated greenhouse that she used as an office and studio.The bone white moon was high and full in the cloudless sky.The small pool of light from the desk lamp threw deep shadows in the glass house and the moonlight made it all somehow spookier.She was here way later than she liked to be.Night on the ranch was creepy.All that sky.The empty space.It wasnt natural.It seemed as though all her secrets and ghosts waited for her under that moon.Lyle insisted that she work from the ranchits how it had always been.Since the turn of the century, when Lyles great grandfather started making chaps and boots and selling them from the stables to every cowboy and rustler within a hundred miles.Lyles granddaddy had bought Crooked Creek and since then, the land and the leather had gone hand in hand.By the time Lyles daddy died, Baker stores were all over the Southwest.Their leather was being worn by teenagers, homemakers, even a few state politicians.But when it fell into Lyles negligent hands, the stores and the brand started to nose dive.He cared more about raising registered Angus cattle than he did about selling their pink dyed hides.But when Baker Leather was about to go bankrupt, he woke up to what hed done to the family legacy.Five years ago, hat in hand, Lyle went to his son, the successful hockey player, and asked him to get his photo taken while wearing a pair of Baker boots.Luc had refused.And while there was no medical proof, Tara believed that was the beginning of the end for Lyles health.A year later, he was admitted to the hospital after a series of strokes.Lucky for all of them that she stumbled into his hospital room when she did.Tara filed the drawings and locked the beat up metal cabinet.Tomorrow would be an early dayEdna and Joyce were showing up at dawn to start making samples of the designs.The demon loved that.Uppity bitches, the demon scowled, running pink fingernails through the black roots of her long blond hair.Edna disapproved of how short the skirts were.Tara clicked off the light and the black and white topography of her office threw her off, damaged her depth perception.The headless tailor dummies seemed to shift in the shadows, as if they were coming for her, and she felt her heart beat hard in the back of her throat.Its not him, she told herself, earning herself some credit in the freak out department.But someday she knew he would find her.And he would come for his pound of flesh.Until then, however, it was just the moon, a couple of tailor dummies, and her own imagination.She pulled on the tight purple suede boots with the black heel that went with the matching knee length purple skirt she wore.The more demure of last years line.You look like a librarian, the demon whispered.A beloved two inches taller, she hustled out of the office, locking the door behind her.Which was more than stupid considering the glass walls, but old habits died hard.The gravel of the path from the greenhouse to the parking area crunched beneath her feet and she hummed under her breath to fill the roaring silence.So many animals out there.So many miles of nothing.Funny how nothing but flat land and a big starry sky could feel so damn suffocating.She walked around the yellow blocks of light thrown through the kitchen windows of the big house, keeping to the dark shadows, hoping Ruby or, worse, Eli wouldnt see her.She just wanted to go home tonight.Sleep in her own bed, drink her own coffee in preparation for her long day tomorrow.Was that too much to ask?She dug through her deep purple hobo bag for her keys, feeling the guilty thrill that she might just make it off the compound without being noticed.In the bottom of the bag she found ten pencils, an empty pack of gum.Two fuzzy Swedish fish.There you are, she murmured, pulling out the necklace with the pretty key charm and the broken clasp she thought shed lost.Stupid big purses, it was too easy to lose everything.Including her keys.Every damn day.Ah ha!She wrestled them from the small pocket in front and glanced up.Only to see a man waiting in the shadows by her car.Her heart thundered in her chest, trying to break free from her ribs.Its him.Fear paralyzed her.Its only me, Tara, a thick, deep voice said, and Eli stepped into the light, his face still hidden by the brim of his ever present hat.Christ, Eli, she panted, relief making her woozy.You scared the shit outta me.Thats what happens when you try to sneak off.Come on, Eli, we both know theyre not coming.We dont know that Its been nine days and we havent heard anything!Eli tipped up his hat and rested his long, lean frame against the car.You agreed, Tara Jean, he said, his voice a low, slow lick.What he meant, of course, was he bought you, Tara, but Eli was a gentleman and wouldnt say such a thing.Guilt shimmied in her stomach.Fine.She threw her keys back into her bag.But you get off on this jailer thing.I know you do, Eli.His chuckle warmed the night.They turned and walked up the gravel path to the stone steps of the big house.Built from oak and stone, the heart of the big house was the same one that Great Granddaddy Baker had bought with money from making all those chaps.But the generations had added to the home, until it was seven thousand square feet of holy hell.A wraparound verandah, a sleeping porch, turrets, two two story wings, a glass portico; it was like an architectural death match, and both architects had died.The demon loved it.So classy, she sighed.Hes going to die all by himself, isnt he?Eli, who over the last few years had become the totally secretive, silent ninja cowboy brother she never knew she wanted, just shrugged.Like it didnt matter.But she hated that.Lyle Baker was a son of a bitch in every sense of the word and probably a few that she wasnt entirely aware of, but death wasnt something anyone should meet by himself.Hes got us, Eli said.Tara Jeans smile hurt with bitterness.Eli might just be a saint, for all she knew about the man.But she was a lying con artist thief of wholly questionable roots who had sold herself and her vacant smiles to Lyle Baker in exchange for financial freedom.Surely he deserved better than that.Do you know his kids?she asked.The ex wife?All she knew was that in the four years shed been in Lyles life, his family had never visited.Never written or called.Except for that disastrous meeting with Luc in Dallas that shed only heard about from Ruby, the live in housekeeper and gossip, there hadnt even been a clue they existed.He nodded, his square jaw rigid.Elis father had been foreman before him and Eli grew up on Crooked Creek.She sighed and stopped on the top step.Eli, do we really have to go through the process of me dragging your opinion out of you, or can you just tell me what you think?Celeste is beautiful and I think she might have loved Lyle, but he took care of that.Tara nodded.Five minutes in the old mans company and it was easy to see what he might do to someone who loved him.The kids?she asked, fearing the worst.Eli opened the door, lamplight spilling across his hard face.Eli?Mean, he said.Thats it?Mean?And spoiled.Spoiled, like how?Like me?No one is spoiled like you.His lip twisted and it might have been a smile.Or gas.Hard to say with Eli.Eli He blinked, something dark and different in his eyes, but then it passed.Vanished.And he kept his mouth shut.Which was just the sort of thing that Eli did.All the time.That doesnt bode well for them showing up here, she said, feeling bad for Lyle, for all of them wrapped up in this crazy scheme.He shrugged.Theres a lot of money at stake and people will do just about anything for money.She felt his eyes on her and she forced herself to meet them, daring him to ask her, or better, to tell her what he knew about her.And not just the engagementhell, that was a legitimate business deal compared to Taras past.Say it, something in her cried, raged actually.A deep well of fury that just got bigger and bigger, right there in the middle of who she was between her sugar tooth and naturally perky boobs.Just say it.But as always, Eli was silent.Tara brushed past him into the big house with its marble eyed hunting trophies and cowhide rugs.It was like a Western theme bar had barfed all over the place.Ill see you in the morning, Tara said, resigned to her fate and the too soft bed of her guest room.Eli nodded, and silently left, all but disappearing into the still and soft Texas darkness.Ninja, she thought, longing for the skill, totally ninja.Tara?A soft voice, and a not so soft poke, startled Tara out of a deep sleep and she lifted her head from its nest of pillows.Ruby?she asked, glancing toward the still dark window.She couldnt have been asleep for more than a few hours.Whats wrong?She snapped upright, pushing her hair out of her face.Lyle?Hes fine.Is it his oxygen?she asked, tossing aside the blankets.I told him the doctors Ruby Fernandez put a hand on her shoulder and Tara realized the housekeeper was standing over her bed wearing a black silk robe that fell from her shoulders like a cape and a sleep mask shed pushed up onto her forehead, displacing graying brown hair up around her head.Tara didnt have that much experience with housekeepers, but she was pretty sure they didnt usually look like a Hispanic female version of Batman.Theyre here, Ruby said.I put them in the den, I didnt know Tara blinked, the tumbler inside her brain clicking around, searching for home, realization dawning.Them.Theyd come after all.Thats good, Ruby.Perfect.I didnt think theyd come.None of us did.They wanted to see him, but I told them no.Good.Imagine showing up the middle of the night, demanding to see a dying man.No shame.Ruby swore in Spanish, and Tara tended to agree with most of her assessment of the sorts of people who would do such a thing.Go on back to bed.IllahIll handle them.Ruby left, her black robe sweeping out behind her.She left the door ajar and a slice of light fell over Taras bed, across her hands.Whose hands are these?she thought, not quite recognizing them, the bones and veins, the long nails with French tips.But then she clenched them into ivory fists, and those she recognized.Its just one more fight, Tara Jean, she told herself.Here we go.She pulled herself out of bed and unbuttoned the one button that still clung to the old flannel shirt she slept in.Since phase one of the engagement plan had gone into effect, shed moved some things into the dresser in the guest room.She yanked open the first cabinet and three small piles of silk and lace stared up at her.Red, white, and black, the royal colors of seduction.Of wickedness.She thought of what Eli had said about the kidsLuc and the girl.What was her name, Nicki?Mean and spoiled.Ten years since the girl had been home or talked to her father.Five since Luc had broken his fathers heart and sent him into the hospital with a stroke, twenty years since hed been back to the ranch.Ten years.Five years.The math of an old mans heartbreak.She chose the red.This was going to be fun.Luc wanted to tear his skin off.He wanted to rip out his gritty, tired eyes, change his day old clothes, and pretend that he wasnt here.In this place.Again.His fathers goddamned den.Like he was a ten year old guilty of some minor crime, waiting, hands shaking, stomach in knots, for his old man to show up to dole out the punishment.He wrapped calm around himself as best he could, hiding the chinks in his armor that the anger revealed.Its just a room, he told himself.But it didnt work.He hated who he was here.Hated what he became surrounded by these walls.His fathers son.Take Jacob into one of the guest rooms, Luc said to Victoria.Hes fine.Over his shoulder he saw her sitting on one of the deep wood and black leather couches, with the antlers carved out of the armrests and the serape thrown over the back.Jacobs head was cradled in her lap, his face flushed with sleep.The sight, the flash of her pale fingers in Jacobs dark curls, filled him with a killing anger.That his fathers games, his schemes would drag them here.His sister so close to a nervous breakdown he could see the cracks.His nephew Well, hello yall, a voice purred from the door and his vision went red.And redder still when he turned to look at her.Tara Jean Sweet stood there, posed in the doorway.One hand on the door frame, the other on her hip, like shed made just such an entrance a thousand times.Youve got to be kidding me, Victoria muttered, but he barely heard her.Bimbo Barbie wore red silk that ran, slick and smooth like a crimson oil spill, over a whole host of impressive curves and valleys.There was a big pile of blond hair on top of her head, with long curls sweeping her cheeks and the tops of her shoulders.He gritted his teeth, anger popping in his head like popcorn.He knew this woman.Never met her, but knew exactly who she was, down to her bare feet.She might lie about her name, change it a thousand times, but she couldnt change who she was.A glorified puck bunny.The kind of woman who hung out at the arenas, throwing herself at the guys just so she could say shed screwed a professional hockey player.A mercenary.A whore.Thats all she was.Preparing for a fight, he shrugged out of his spring jacket, tossing it over the club chair so hard he nearly knocked it over.Im Tara Jean, the woman said, stepping into the room like she already owned it all.But her name, according to Gary Thiele, the private investigator, was actually plain old Jane Simmons.Born poor in Arkansas and looking to change that.There were no reporters here.No game at stake.With an internal sigh of delight, Luc slipped the leash off his anger and felt it course through his body.Where the hell is my father?he barked.The blonde blinked empty blue headlight eyes at him as if she didnt quite get it, but then she smiled, soft full lips slowly exposing white teeth.The move was so practiced he practically heard the orchestra music.Well, now.Her fingers petted a curl that dangled over her breast.Lyles a bit tuckered out.Dont be disgusting, Victoria hissed from the couch.Tara Jean turned slightly and the negligee slid over her breasts and hips, and something dark and wicked twisted inside of him.He used to screw those puck bunnies.Once upon a time hed used them the way they wanted to be used.Well, hi there, Tara said, and then her eyes went wide with surprise.Who is that?She pointed at Jacob as if he were a raccoon whod put on pants and walked indoors.Where the hell is my father?Luc nearly shouted, not wanting that woman to even look at Jacob.It took a second, but Bimbo Barbie pulled her limited focus from Jacob.Its two oclock in the morning, Tara said, her Southern drawl as thick as Spanish moss.I must admit youve caught us a bit unaware.Clearly, we did not receive your travel plans.Her tone was sharp, and he realized she was scolding him.Scolding him.Bull.Shit.He strode out of the room, leaving her breasts and protests in the den.He did not for one second give himself the chance to recognize the hallways and the pictures.The rooms, the smell of countless hickory fires in the big fireplace in the living room.The fear that crawled up his neck, as if he were a small boy about to be beaten for some minor crime.He banked on the fact that the old man was still in the master suite, and he made quick work of the double staircase that split the big old foyer in two.He turned left at the top of the steps and headed back into the east wing.Luc.She was behind him, running to keep up.Its the middle of the night.Hes sleeping He stopped in front of the master suite doors and the blonde caught up with him.She was flushed, her breasts heaving under the red silk and lace of that ridiculous negligee.She was sexup for grabs, and he suddenly wanted to be the one grabbing.Yep, those puck bunnies had been fun.Dont, she said.Truly, Luc He looked right into her baby blues and pushed open the door.The smell of sicknesssour and chemicalwafted from the room, accompanied by the occasional beep and the rhythmic suction of medical machinery.He stepped into the room, around the door, and felt again that Gilcot hit.The world falling away beneath his feet.A man slept slightly reclined in an elevated hospital bed.But thatskeleton in the bed wasnt Lyle Baker.Not even close.The big man with the barrel chest and the hazel eyes that could see a boys crimes before he even committed themwas gone.Wasted.A corpse lay in his place.His thick black hair had fallen out and his coloring matched the white sheets beneath his head.A breathing mask led to a respirator.A heart rate monitor attached by unseen wires beeped beside him.The old man twitched in his sleep, his fingers scratching against the sheets as if pushing away nightmares.Luc wanted to be glad, delighted even, that karma had come back to kick the old mans ass, but he was shell shocked.Gutted.Satisfied?the blonde asked, like some kind of watchdog.Luc stepped back, the door blocking the sight of the ghost on the bed.He took a quick breath, getting his head back in the game.Apparently, Bimbo Barbie had a secret steel edge to her, because her eyes were sharp, stabbing him right in the chest.Good, the competitor in him snarled.Let her test that edge against me and see where it gets her.My nephew is tired, he said.Find him a room.She blinked, no doubt pissed off by his tone.No one liked being treated as though they were a servant, especially women who skated the edges of that role.But she lifted her chin, throwing back all that blond hair.The west wing is ready for you.Im sure you remember My old room.Of course.Rattled, Luc left the woman standing there, racing away as fast as he could, from all that sickness and all that beauty.3 You dont have to do this right now, Tara said the next morning as she helped Lyle shrug into his thick navy robe so he could greet his family in something other than his pajamas.He leaned forward, his meager trembling weight against her arm as she pulled the sleeves up to his shoulders, wishing the velour were armor.Course I do.Despite his frailty, his voice was stronger than it had been in days.She knew it was temporarythe excitement of having his children herebut when that excitement wore off, hed be wasted with fatigue.Theyre going to kill him, she thought.Hes so excited, and theyre going to walk in here and just destroy him.She patted his thin chest.She couldnt feel the bones of his ribs under the velour of the robe, but they were there, morbid mile markers to the end.Theyre angry, Lyle.Luc His God given name is Wayne.His middle name is Luc.Not to him, honey.And he and Victoria are coming in loaded for bear.His eyes focused on her and she saw the fever under his skin.They got a right.His thin lips lifted in a smile.But theyre here, aint they?Here to fight.My plan worked.Youre so weak, she whispered.Im dying, Tara Jean.Now stop being a damn wet nurse and bring me my children.There was no arguing with him, considering the amount of energy hed put into orchestrating this very moment.She stood up from the thin slice of bed shed been sitting on and walked over to the mirror.Big hair, lots of makeup, a grass green silk shirt unbuttoned just enough to reveal the girls best sides.She leaned over slightly and arranged things to optimum advantage, her fingers cold on her skin.Impersonal.Considering how disconnected she felt from her body, she might as well be arranging fruit.But her jeans were tight and her heels were high.As man eater costumes went, it was flawless.And the man she wanted to eat was Luc, just so she could spit out his bones.She walked down the dark quiet hallways to the den where shed told Ruby to situate them.It gave her a huge amount of glee to think of Luc Baker being managed, led around, and patrolled.The memory of his eyes on her last night, as if he knew every terrible thing about her, was an uncomfortable one.And no doubt today would only be worse.She paused in the doorway to the den, watching her opponent pace in front of the big desk, all that anger and suppressed energy simmering just under what she had to admit was a gorgeous surface.His black hair was thick and had a surprising curl to it, softening the sharp planes of his facethe high cheekbones and strong chin.She knew he was a hockey player, but youd never guess by his face.It was perfect.Elegant.Luc Baker was a big man, tall and thick through the shoulders and chest but lean through the waist.He fit his thousand dollar, gray pin striped suit with sublime perfection.His fuchsia tie was a bright and stylish pop of color.Not knowing any hockey players, shed expected jeans and a beer stained T shirt.Interesting that he dressed to see his father as if he were going to a lawyer.Or a funeral.He moved with grace.Power.Precision.Nothing wasted.Nothing superfluous.He was like a blade, sharp and lethal.Anger spiked her right through the chest.She wasnt about to be threatened or bullied by a man who was only here for money.He could glower and threaten all he wanted.There was nothing he could try that hadnt been tried before.Well, now, she said, stepping into the den where Luc paced like a caged panther, all dark hair and darker countenance.He exuded menace and when he turned to face her, she felt his anger like a punch in the stomach.I trust yall slept all right?she asked, turning it on with the force of a locomotive.Enjoyed your breakfast?I swear, Ruby makes about the best Where is my father?Tara hadnt seen Victoria by the window.Tall and thin as fishing line, she blended into the dark drapes.Victorias facechina white, as if shed never seen a ray of sun in her life or just had the private number of the best dermatologist in New York Citywas pinched.The arms she held across her chest were clutched tight as if she were just barely holding herself together.Unwanted empathy twisted through Tara, who knew all too well what it felt like to have only yourself to protect you from the forces that wanted to tear you apart.Empathy.What garbage.Tara reminded herself she had no allegiance to that womanand her demons were her own.Perhaps if Victoria hadnt walked away from Lyle ten years ago, never to speak to him again, she wouldnt be so damn wretched right now.Tara still couldnt believe the woman had a son.When the news hit about Victorias husband, Lyle had been in the hospital and Tara had read him the newspaper.When the first story about the Ponzi scheme broke, Lyle had laughed himself right into cardiac arrest.After that, shed stayed away from the news about Victoria and her husband and instead read Lyle the obituaries and crossword puzzle.Just as he liked.If hed known he had a grandson, Lyle would have moved heaven and earth to bring the boy here and would probably have killed himself in the process.The memory of the kid sleeping in his mothers lap last night, his dark curls damp against his forehead, knocked her sideways, but she took a deep breath and wrangled herself back to center.Well, now youll have to excuse sweet Lyle, but he doesnt get around much anymore.Hed love to see you, but it will be in his quarters.Fine, snapped Luc and she could feel his gaze, those deep hazel eyes, rake over her body, reaching under her clothes to the skin and the blood and bone beneath.Her body shook at the sensation, like a trailer in a tornado.For years now, shed been numb.Frozen deep.Unmoved.But now, in the face of this mans hate, shequivered?Unbelievable.Shocking, even.He stepped toward the door, as if ready to charge back down the hallway the way he had last night.But she stayed where she was, reaching one arm up to place a hand on the frame.His eyes sparked, his lips tightened, and he stopped a few inches away from her.Lightning bolts flashed between them, and all the fine hair on her body trembled and lifted.You cant bully me, she thought, planting her heels all the way through the earth.Her eyes locked on his and she smiled, just enough so that his eyes dropped to her red, red lips.Sinners lips, Grant Wasinsky, the worst of Mommas boyfriends, used to say, before Momma got wise to his intentions and kicked him out.Too late, as it happened.But points for trying.And the heat in Lucs gaze proved he wasnt as immune or disgusted by her as he wanted to be.Behave yourself, she whispered, and waited long enough for his dark eyes to crawl back to hers.Desire and disgust mingled in his expression.I belong to your daddy.Ignore her, Victoria breathed as they followed Tara Jeans perfect, denim covered ass down the hallways.Tara Jean was blathering on about the house, as if they didnt know a thing about it.As if they hadnt run these hallways in their pajamas, their bare feet, their bootssearching for a place to hide from the old mans belt.Shes baiting you, Victoria added through pinched lips.And youre falling for it.Vicks was right and he knew it, which made him angrier.Tara Jean was nothing.Less than nothing.They stopped in front of the bedroom door.Tara Jean paused as if she were about to say something, but he didnt give her the chance.Whatever was about to happen, as bad as it might getit was all between Luc and his sister.Just like it always had been.Its bad, he said to Victoria, taking her hand in his.He felt every bone, the pounding of her blood.We dont have to do this.She nodded once and squeezed his fingers.Lets go.He reached past Tara Jean, whod been watching him and Victoria with unreadable eyes, and opened the door, pushing it wide to reveal the bed, the machines, and the man served by all of it.Victoria gasped.Well now, said the skeleton on the bed.Aint this something.Animated, the skeleton looked a lot more like the father Luc remembered.The bright eyes, the smile.The arrogance.The king was dying, but he wasnt dead yet.Why dont yall have a seat.Tara stepped past them, toward the two chairs pulled up beside the bed.Luc held out his hand, stopping her.He didnt touch her, but he could feel the heat from her ridiculous body.The silk of her shirt fluttered against his palm and a shot of electricity sizzled through him.Behave yourself, he seethed.You can go, he said.She smiled and leaned toward him slightly, pressing the silk of her shirt, and then the taut skin of her belly, into his hand.He went flush from the heat.Not on your life.She swept past him and walked around Lyles bed.She hitched a curvy hip onto it and curled her body around the old mans.A vine suffocating the life it climbed all over, except Lyle smiled at her, running a frail hand over her thigh and leaving it there.Lucs fingers twitched.Wayne Lyle said.Its Luc, Dad.Has been for years.Thats not what it says on your birth certificate.Well, its what it says on my checks.Luc managed to smile, rubbing it in, pleased that he was managing to stay calm.Delighted to see the bright spots of anger on the old mans cheeks.How are you doing, Daddy?Victoria asked, taking a tentative step toward the bed.Lyles dark eyes swung to her and she stopped, as if repelled by a force field.Luc stepped forward to protect his sister from the menace in the old mans eyes.Where you been the last ten years?Lyle asked as if Luc wasnt even there.Victoria stiffened.You kicked me out, Dad, she said, putting her hands at her side.Not for ten years I didnt.I cant read your mind, she said.You told me if I married I know what I said.A feral grin split his face.And I was right, wasnt I?Victoria flinched as if hed punched her, and Luc reached for her hand.But she shook him off and stepped closer to the bed.After this thing with Joel, shed left amateur whippingpost status behind and gone pro.Every stranger on the street that recognized her name or her face from the news had something to say to her, and she just laid herself bare for their hatred and bile.Luc couldnt stop her.Couldnt even figure out how.You were right, Victoria said.Joel was a crook.He She took a deep breath.He left us with nothing.And thats why youre crawling back here Stop it, Dad, Luc intervened.Shes been punished enough.Lyles eyessunken in his skullblazed.Not by me, she hasnt.Your mother ruined you, he snapped at Victoria.You havent done a days work in your life We didnt come down here to be abused by you, Dad, he said.Still fighting your sisters fights?Lyle sneered.Daddy, Victoria whispered.Stop hiding behind your brother, you coward!This is ridiculous.Luc grabbed his sisters hand even though she resisted.Were leaving.We never should have come.She has a son, Tara whispered, running a long fingered hand over the old mans cheek.A little boy.Lyle blinked.Blinked again, and Luc realized that the old man didnt know about Jacob.Luc didnt know whether to laugh or to grab Jacob and run back to Canada.Victoria looked over her shoulder at him and Luc shrugged.How old?Lyle barked.His pale hands shook against the sheets.Seven, Victoria answered.His name is Jacob.A grandson?A monitor next to Lyle beeped and beeped again.A red light flashed.Tara turned, suddenly efficient, to check the computers readout.Sweetie, she said, you need to calm down.A nurse rushed in wearing a pair of pink scrubs with bunnies on them that seemed so ridiculous, so incongruous, Luc couldnt look anywhere else.The bunnies wore sunglasses.This wasnt what he wanted.As much as he hated his father, he didnt want to watch him die.Is he here?Lyle asked, and Victoria, her eyes wide, just nodded and the monitors went berserk again.Dad, Luc said.You need to calm Tara Jeans eyes narrowed with a fury so palpable he could taste smoke and fire in the back of his throat.You need to leave.All that Southern peach was gone.She stood, her arms wide, corralling them from the room.Is he okay?Victoria asked.Mr.Baker, the nurse said as she lowered the mattress.Can you hear me?Oh my God, Victoria breathed.Get.Out, Tara said, and Luc reluctantly realized she was right.They were in the way, and Lyles wild eyes kept seeking out Victoria.He put his arm around his sister, leading her out of the room.Once they stood on the navy blue runner in the hallway, the bedroom door slammed shut behind them.The hallway buzzed with silence, all the sounds from the bedroom eaten by the thick wooden door.This is a nightmare, Victoria whispered.The thin white lines of strain around her mouth tore at him.Vicks, he whispered.You dont need this mans money.We can I do.Her midnight eyes were bright, feverish.I know you dont understand that.But I need his money.That stuff he said Hes said it all before.Ive never understood why he was even with Mom when he hated her so much.He didnt know about Jacob?He kicked me out, Luc.Its not like I was sending him Christmas cards.The sarcasm was a nice change, and he stroked her arm.But with all the press last year?I kept Jacob out of it as much as I could.She wrapped her arms around herself.He probably wasnt following all that closely, just enough to know he was right and the rest of the world, especially me, was wrong.Hes been keeping tabs on me for twenty years.ESPN practically does that for him.Her smile was the saddest thing hed ever seen.And its no secret he likes you better.There was nothing he could say, so he didnt even bother.She glanced back at the door.I had no idea he didnt know.After a long moment she shook her head, as if getting rid of her maudlin thoughts.Im going to go find Jacob; Im sure hes bored out of his head.What are you going to do?Wait, he said, thinking of Tara Jean Sweet and the buried steel beneath all that blond bimbo.Im gonna wait.Victoria found Ruby and Jacob on the front porch.He was showing the housekeeper his Transformers and Ruby, wearing a rhinestone Minnie Mouse T shirt, one size too small, was pretending to be interested.Victoria had one of those out of body experiences looking down at her son.Just a few months agothe worst night of her life, worse than the night Joel told her what hed done, worse than the night hed killed himselfshe stared down at him in his hospital bed, so small, so tender and vulnerable, lost among the sheets.The doctors had told her to prepare herself for the worst, that the H1N1 virus was too strong, and his lungs, already compromised by his asthma, were just too weak.So shed lain in bed with him and told him about the morning he was born and how he used to curl up in her arms and play with her hair.She read him all his favorite stories and she held him as close as she could, feeling every young bone beneath his thin skin.
