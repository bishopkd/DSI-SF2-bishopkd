Ye did what ye did to try to save me; youre right, if yed not gone wi Randall, hed likely have killed me here.She studied her brothers face, a troubled frown wrinkling her rounded brow.No, I dinna regret taking Randall to the housenot even if hedwell, no.But that wasnt it.She drew a deep breath again, steeling herself.When I took him inside, I brought him up to my room.II didna ken quite what to expectId notbeen wi a man.He seemed verra nervous, though, all flushed and as though he were not certain himself, which seemed strange to me.He pushed me onto the bed, and then he stood there, rubbing himself.I thought at first Id really damaged him wi my knee, though I knew I hadna struck him so hard, really.The color was creeping up her cheeks, and she stole a sidelong glance at Ian before looking hastily back at her lap.I ken now that he was trying toto make himself ready.I didna mean to let him know I was frightened, so I sat up straight on the bed and stared at him.That seemed to anger him, and he ordered me to turn round.I wouldna do it, though, and just kept looking at him.Her face was the color of one of the roses by the doorstep.Heunbuttoned himself, and Iwell, I laughed at him.You did what?Jamie said incredulously.I laughed.I mean Her eyes met her brothers with some defiance.I kent well enough how a mans made.Id seen you naked often enough, and Willy and Ian as well.But he A tiny smile appeared on her lips, despite her apparent efforts to suppress it.He looked so funny, all red in the face, and rubbing himself so frantic, and yet still only half  There was a choked sound from Ian, and she bit her lip, but went on bravely.He didna like it when I laughed, and I could see it, so I laughed some more.Thats when he lunged at me and tore my dress half off me.I smacked him in the face, and he struck me across the jaw, hard enough to make me see stars.Then he grunted a bit, as though that pleased him, and started to climb onto the bed wi me.I had just about sense enough left to laugh again.I struggled up onto my knees, and II taunted him.I told him I kent he was no a real man, and couldna manage wi a woman.I  She bent her head still further, so the dark curls swung down past her flaming cheeks.Her words were very low, almost a whisper.Ispread the pieces of my gown apart, and Itaunted him wi my breasts.I told him I knew he was afraid o me, because he wasna fit to touch a woman, but only to sport wi beasts and young lads  Jenny, said Jamie, shaking his head helplessly.Her head came up to look at him.Weel, I did then, she said.It was all I could think of, and I could see that he was fair off his head, but it was plain too that hecouldnt.And I stared right at his breeches and I laughed again.And then he got his hands round my throat, throttling me, and I cracked my head against the bedpost, andand when I woke hed gone, and you wi him.There were tears standing in her lovely blue eyes as she grasped Jamies hands.Jamie, will ye forgive me?I know if Id not angered him that way he wouldna have treated you as he did, and then Faither  Oh, Jenny, love, mo cridh, dont.He was kneeling beside her, pulling her face into his shoulder.Ian, on her other side, looked as though he had been turned to stone.Jamie rocked her gently as she sobbed.Hush, little dove.Ye did right, Jenny.It wasna your fault, and maybe not mine either.He stroked her back.Listen, mo cridh.He came here to do damage, under orders.And it would ha made no difference who hed found here, or what you or I might have done.He meant to cause trouble, to rouse the countryside against the English, for his own purposesand those of the man that hired him.Jenny stopped crying and sat up, looking at him in amazement.To rouse folk against the English?But why?Jamie made an impatient gesture with one hand.To find out the folk that might support Prince Charles, should it come to another Rising.But I dinna ken yet which side Randalls employer is onif he wants to know so those that follow the Prince can be watched, and maybe have their property seized, or if its that heRandalls employermeans to go wi the Prince himself, and wants the Highlands roused and ready for war when the time comes.I dinna ken, and it isna important now.He touched his sisters hair, smoothing it back from her brow.All thats important is that youre not harmed, and I am home.Soon Ill come back to stay, mo cridh.I promise.She raised his hand to her lips and kissed it, her face glowing.She fumbled in her pocket for a handkerchief and blew her nose.Then she looked at Ian, still frozen by her side, a look of hurt anger in his eyes.She touched him gently on the shoulder.You think I should ha told you.He didnt move, but went on looking at her.Aye, he said quietly.I do.She put the handkerchief down in her lap and took him by both hands.Ian, man, I didna tell ye because I didna wish to lose you too.My brother was gone, and my father.I didna mean to lose my own hearts blood as well.For you are dearer to me even than home and family, love.She cast a lopsided smile at Jamie.And thats saying quite a bit.She looked into Ians eyes, pleading, and I could see love and hurt pride struggling for mastery on his face.Jamie rose then and touched me on the shoulder.We left the room quietly, leaving them together before the dying fire.* * *    It was a clear night, and the moonlight fell in floods through the tall casements.I could not fall asleep myself, and I thought perhaps it was the light also that kept Jamie awake; he lay quite still, but I could tell by his breathing that he was not asleep.He turned onto his back, and I heard him chuckle softly under his breath.Whats funny?I asked quietly.He turned his head toward me.Oh, did I wake ye, Sassenach?Im sorry.I was only remembering about things.I wasnt asleep.I scooted closer.The bed had obviously been made for the days when a whole family slept together on one mattress; the gigantic feather bed must have consumed the entire productivity of hundreds of geese, and navigating through the drifts was like crossing the Alps without a compass.What were you remembering?I asked, once I had safely reached his side.Oh, about my father, mostly.Things he said.He folded his arms behind his head, staring musingly at the thick beams that crossed the low ceiling.Its strange, he said, when he was alive, I didna pay him much heed.But once he was dead, the things hed told me had a good deal more influence.He chuckled briefly again.What I was thinking about was the last time he thrashed me.Funny, was it?I said.Anyone ever told you that you have a very peculiar sense of humor, Jamie?I fumbled through the quilts for his hand, then gave up and pushed them back.He began to stroke my back, and I snuggled next to him, making small noises of pleasure.Didnt your uncle beat you, then, when you needed it?he asked curiously.I smothered a laugh at the thought.Lord, no!He would have been horrified at the thought.Uncle Lamb didnt believe in beating childrenhe thought they should be reasoned with, like adults.Jamie made a Scottish noise in his throat, indicating derision at this ludicrous idea.That accounts for the defects in your character, no doubt, he said, patting my bottom.Insufficient discipline in your youth.What defects in my character?I demanded.The moonlight was bright enough for me to see his grin.Ye want me to list them all?No.I dug an elbow into his ribs.Tell me about your father.How old were you then?I asked.Oh, thirteenfourteen maybe.Tall and skinny, with spots.I canna remember why I was being thrashed; at that point, it was more often something Id said than something Id done.All I remember is we were both of us boiling mad about it.That was one of the times he enjoyed beating me.He pulled me to him and settled me closer against his shoulder, his arm around me.I stroked his flat belly, toying with his navel.Stop that, it tickles.Dye want to hear, or no?Oh, I want to hear.What are we going to do if we ever have childrenreason with them, or beat them?My heart raced a little at the thought, though there was no sign that this would ever be more than an academic question.His hand trapped mine, holding it still over his belly.Thats simple.You reason with them, and when youre through, Ill take them out and thrash them.I thought you liked children.I do.My father liked me, when I wasna being an idiot.And he loved me, tooenough to beat the daylights out of me when I was being an idiot.I flopped onto my stomach.All right, then.Tell me about it.Jamie sat up and wadded the pillows more comfortably before lying back down, folded arms behind his head again.Well, he sent me up to the fence, as usualhe always made me go up first, so I could experience the proper mixture of terror and remorse while I waited for him, he saidbut he was so angry, he was right behind me.I was bent over and taking it, then, gritting my teeth and determined Id make no noise about itdamned if Id let him know how much it hurt.I was digging my fingers into the wood of the fence rail as hard as I couldhard enough to leave splinters behindand I could feel my face turnin red from holding my breath.He drew a deep breath, as though making up for it, and let it out slowly.Usually Id know when it was going to be over, but this time he didnt stop.It was all I could do to keep my mouth shut; I was grunting wi each stroke and I could feel the tears starting, no matter how much I blinked, but I held on for dear life.He was uncovered to the waist, almost glowing in the moonlight, frosted with tiny silver hairs.I could see the pulse beat just below his breastbone, a steady throb just under my hand.I dont know how long it went on, he continued.Not that long, likely, but it seemed like a long time to me.At last he stopped a moment and shouted at me.He was beside himself wi fury, and I was so furious myself I could barely make out what he said at first, but then I could.He roared Damn you, Jamie!Can ye no cry out?Youre grown now, and I dinna mean to beat you ever again, but I want one good yelp out of ye, lad, before I quit, just so Ill think Ive made some impression on ye at last!Jamie laughed, disturbing the even movement of his pulsebeat.I was so upset at that, I straightened up and whirled round and yelled at him, Weel, why did ye no say so in the first place, ye auld fool!OUCH!!Next thing I knew I was on the ground, wi my ears ringing and a pain in my jaw, where hed clouted me.He was standing over me, panting, and wi his hair and his beard all on end.He reached down and got my hand and hauled me up.Then he patted my jaw, and said, still breathing hard, Thats for calling your father a fool.It may be true, but its disrespectful.Come on, well wash for supper.And he never struck me again.He still shouted at me, but I shouted back, and it was mostly man to man, after that.He laughed comfortably, and I smiled into the warmth of his shoulder.I wish Id known your father, I said.Or maybe its better not, I said, struck by a thought.He might not have liked you marrying an Englishwoman.Jamie hugged me closer and pulled the quilts up over my bare shoulders.Hed have thought Id got some sense at last.He stroked my hair.Hed have respected my choice, whoever it was, but youhe turned his head and kissed my brow gentlyhe would have liked you verra much, my Sassenach.And I recognized it for the accolade it was.30    CONVERSATIONS BY THE HEARTH    Whatever rift Jennys revelations had caused between her and Ian, it seemed to have healed.We sat for a short time after dinner in the parlor next evening, Ian and Jamie talking over the farms business in the corner, accompanied by a decanter of elderberry wine, while Jenny relaxed at last with her swollen ankles propped on a hassock.I tried to write down some of the receipts she had tossed over her shoulder at me as we whizzed through the days work, consulting her for details as I scribbled.TO TREAT CARBUNCLES, I headed one sheet.Three iron nails, to be soaked for one week in sour ale.Add one handful of cedarwood shavings, allow to set.When shavings have sunk to the bottom, mixture is ready.Apply three times daily, beginning on the first day of a quarter moon.BEESWAX CANDLES began another sheet.Drain honey from the comb.Remove dead bees, so far as possible.Melt comb with a small amount of water in a large cauldron.Skin bees, wings, and other impurities from surface of water.Drain water, replace.Stir frequently for half an hour, then allow to settle.Drain water, keep for use in sweetening.Purify with water twice more.My hand was getting tired, and I had not even gotten to the making of candle molds, the twisting of wicks, and the hanging of candles to dry.Jenny, I called, how long does it take to make candles, counting everything?She laid the small shirt she was stitching in her lap, considering.Half a day to gather the combs, two to drain the honeyone if its hotone day to purify the wax, unless theres a lot or its verra dirtythen two.Half a day to make the wicks, one or two to make the molds, half a day to melt the wax, pour the molds and hang them to dry.Say a week altogether.The dim lamplight and the sputtering quill were too much to contend with after the days labors.I sat down next to Jenny and admired the tiny garment she was embroidering with nearly invisible stitches.Her rounded stomach suddenly heaved, as the inhabitant shifted position.I watched, fascinated.I had never been close to someone pregnant for a prolonged period, and hadnt realized the amount of activity that went on inside.Would you like to feel it?Jenny offered, seeing me staring at her middle.Well She took my hand and placed it firmly on her mound.Right there.Just wait a moment; hell kick again soon.They dont like ye lying back like this, ye know.It makes them restless and they start to squirm.Sure enough, a surprisingly vigorous push raised my hand by several inches.Goodness!Hes strong!I exclaimed.Aye.Jenny patted her stomach with a touch of pride.Hell be bonny, like his brother and his Da.She smiled across at Ian, whose attention had momentarily wandered from the breeding records of horses to his wife and child to be.Or even like his good for nothing red heided uncle, she added, raising her voice slightly and nudging me.Hey?Jamie looked up, distracted from his accounts.Were ye speaking to me?I wonder was it the red heided or the good for nothing that caught his attention, Jenny said to me, sotto voce, with another nudge.To Jamie she said sweetly, Nothing at all, mo cridh.We were just speculating on the possibility that the new one would have the misfortune to resemble its uncle.The uncle in question grinned and came across to sit on the hassock, Jenny amiably moving her feet, then replacing them in his lap.Rub them for me, Jamie, she begged.Youre better at it than Ian.He obliged, and Jenny leaned back and closed her eyes in bliss.She dropped the tiny shirt on her central mound, which continued to heave as though in protest.Jamie stared entranced at the movements, just as I had.Isnt it uncomfortable?he asked.Havin someone turn somersaults in your belly?Jenny opened her eyes and grimaced as a long swell arced across her stomach.Mmm.Sometimes I feel my livers black and blue from bein kicked.But mostly its a good feeling, instead.Its like She hesitated, then grinned at her brother.Its hard to describe to a man, you not having the proper parts.I dont suppose I could tell ye what carrying a child feels like, no more than you could tell me what its like to be kicked in the ballocks.Oh, I could tell ye that.He promptly doubled up, clasping himself, and rolled his eyes back in his head with a hideous gurgling groan.Is that not right, Ian?he asked, turning his head toward the stool where Ian sat laughing, wooden leg propped on the hearth.His sister put a delicate foot on his chest and pushed him upright.All right then, clown.In that case, Im glad I havena got any.Jamie straightened up and brushed the hair out of his eyes.No, really, he said, interested, is it just that the parts are different?Could you describe it to Claire?After all, shes a woman, though shes not borne a child yet.Jenny eyed my midriff appraisingly, and I felt that small pang once more.Mmm, perhaps.She spoke slowly, thinking.You feel as though your skin is verra thin all over.You feel everything that touches you, even the rubbing of your clothes, and not just on your belly, but over your legs and flanks and breasts.Her hands went to them unconsciously, curving the lawn under the swelling rounds.They feel heavy and fulland theyre verra sensitive just at the tips.The small, blunt thumbs slowly circled the breasts and I saw the nipples rise against the cloth.And of course youre big and youre clumsy, Jenny smiled ruefully, rubbing the spot on her hip where she had banged against the table earlier.You take up more room than youre used to.Here, thoughher hands rose protectively to the top of her stomachthats where you feel things most, of course.She caressed the rounded bulge as though it were her childs skin she stroked, rather than her own.Ians eyes followed her hands as they moved from top to bottom of the curving hillock, over and over, smoothing the fabric again and again.In the early days, its a bit like belly gas, she said, laughing.She poked a toe into her brothers midsection.Just therelike little bubbles rippling through your belly.But then later, you feel the child move, and its like a fish on your line and then gonelike a quick tug, but so soon past youre not sure you felt it.As though in protest at this description, her unseen companion heaved to and fro, making her stomach bulge on one side, then the other.I imagine youre sure, by this time, Jamie remarked, following the movement with fascination.Oh, aye.She placed a hand on one bulge, as though to quiet it.They sleep, ye know, for hours at a time.Sometimes ye fear theyve died, when theres no movement for a long time.Then you try to wake themher hand pushed in sharply at the side, and was rewarded immediately by a strong push in the opposite directionand youre happy when they kick again.But its not just the babe itself.You feel swollen all over, near the end.Not painfuljust so ripe you could burst.Its as though you need to be touched, verra lightly, all over.Jenny was no longer looking at me.Her eyes held her husbands, and I knew she was no longer aware of me or her brother.There was an air of intimacy between her and Ian, as though this were a story often told, but one of which they never tired.Her voice was lower now, and her hands rose again to her breasts, heavy and compelling under the light bodice.And in the last month or so, the milk begins to come in.You feel yourself filling, just a wee bit at a time, a little each time the child moves.And then suddenly, everything comes up hard and round.She cupped her stomach again.Theres no pain, then, just a breathless feeling, and then your breasts tingle as though theyll explode if theyre not suckled.She closed her eyes and leaned back, stroking her massive belly, over and over, with a rhythm like the invocation of a spell.It came to me, watching her, that if ever there were such a thing as a witch, then Janet Fraser was one.The smoky air was filled with the trance over the room; the feeling that lies at the root of lust, the terrible yearning need to join, and create.I could have counted every hair on Jamies body without looking at him, and knew each one stood erect.Jenny opened her eyes, dark in the shadows, and smiled at her husband, a slow, rich curve of infinite promise.And late in bearing, when the child moves a lot, sometimes theres a feeling like when youve your man inside ye, when he comes to ye deep and pours himself into you.Then, then when that throbbing starts deep inside ye along with him, its like that, but its much bigger; it ripples all through the walls of your womb and fills all of you.The childs quiet then, and its as though its him youve taken inside you instead.Suddenly she turned to me, and the spell was broken.Thats what they want sometimes, ye know, she said quietly, smiling into my eyes.They want to come back.* * *    Some time later, Jenny rose, floating toward the door with a glance back that pulled Ian after her like iron to true north.She paused near the door for him, looking back at her brother, who sat still by the fire hearth.Youll see to the fire, Jamie?She stretched, arching her back, and the curve of her spine echoed the strangely sinuous curve of her belly.Ians knuckles pressed hard along the length of her back, and ground into the base of her spine, making her groan.And then they were gone.I stretched too, arms upward, feeling the pleasant pull of tired muscles.Jamies hands ran down my sides and rested on the swell of my hips.I leaned back into him, drawing his hands forward, imagining them cupping the gentle curve of an unborn child.As I turned my head to kiss him, I noticed the small form curled in the corner of the settle.Look.Theyve forgotten small Jamie.The little boy customarily slept on a trundle in his parents room.Tonight he had fallen asleep by the fire while we sat talking over the wine, but no one had remembered to carry him up to his bed.My own Jamie turned me to face him, smoothing my hair away from his nose.Jenny never forgets anything, he said.I expect she and Ian do not care for company just now.His hands went to the fastening at the back of my skirt.Hell do where he is for the present.But what if he wakes up?The roving hands came up under the now loose edge of the bodice.Jamie cocked an eyebrow at the recumbent form of his small nephew.Aye well.Hell have to learn his job sometime, wont he?Ye dont want him to be as ignorant as his uncle was.He tossed several cushions to the floor before the fire and lowered himself, carrying me with him.The firelight gleamed on the silvery scars on his back, as though he were in fact the iron man I had once accused him of being, the metal core showing through rents in the fragile skin.I traced the lashmarks one by one, and he shivered under my touch.Do you think Jennys right?I asked later.Do men really want to come back inside?Is that why you make love to us?A breath of laughter stirred the hair by my ear.Well, its no usually the first thing in my mind when I take ye to bed, Sassenach.Far from it.But then His hands cupped my breasts softly, and his lips closed on one nipple.Id no just say she was completely wrong either.Sometimesaye, sometimes it would be good, to be inside again, safe andone.Knowing we cannot, I suppose, is what makes us want to beget.If we cannot go back ourselves, the best we can do is to give that precious gift to our sons, at least for a little while He shook himself suddenly, like a dog flinging water from its coat.Pay me no mind, Sassenach, he murmured.I get verra maudlin, drinking elderberry wine.31    QUARTER DAY    There was a light knock on the door, and Jenny stepped in, carrying a folded blue garment over her arm and a hat in one hand.She looked her brother over critically, then nodded.Aye, the shirts well enough.And Ive let out your best coat for ye; youve grown a bit through the shoulders since I saw ye last.She cocked her head to one side, considering.Yeve done a braw job of it todayup to the neck, at least.Sit ye down over there, and Ill tend to your hair.She pointed to the stool by the window.My hair?Whats wrong wi my hair?Jamie demanded, putting a hand up to check.Grown nearly to shoulder length, he had as usual laced it back with a leather thong to keep it out of his face.Wasting no time on chat, his sister pushed him down onto the stool, yanked the thong loose and began to brush him vigorously with the tortoiseshell brushes.Whats wrong wi your hair?she asked rhetorically.Weel, now.Theres cockleburs in it, for one thing.She plucked a small brown object delicately from his head and dropped it on the dresser.And bits of oak leaf.Where were ye yesterdayrootling under the trees like a hog?And more tangles than a skein of washed yarn  Ouch!Be still, roy.Frowning with concentration, she picked up a comb and teased out the tangles, leaving a smooth, shining mass of auburn, copper, cinnamon, and gold, all gleaming together in the morning sun from the window.Jenny spread it in her hands, shaking her head over it.I canna think why the good Lord should waste hair like that on a man, she remarked.Like a red deers pelt, in places.It is wonderful isnt it?I agreed.Look, where the suns bleached it on top, hes got those lovely blond streaks.The object of our admiration glowered up at us.If ye both dinna stop it, I shall shave my head.He stretched out a threatening hand toward the dresser, where his razor rested.His sister, deft in spite of the enormous bulge of pregnancy, reached out and smacked his wrist with the hairbrush.He yelped, then yelped again as she yanked the hair back into a fistful.Keep still, she ordered.She began to separate the hair into three thick strands.Ill make ye a proper cockernonny, she declared with satisfaction.Ill no have ye goin down to your tenants looking like a savage.Jamie muttered something rebellious under his breath, but subsided under his sisters ministrations.Dexterously tucking in stray bits here and there, she plaited the hair into a thick formal queue, tucking the ends under and binding them securely with thread.Then she reached into her pocket, pulled out a blue silk ribbon and triumphantly tied it in a bow.There!she said.Bonny, no?She turned to me for confirmation, and I had to admit it.The closely bound hair set off the shape of his head and the bold modeling of his face.Clean and orderly, in snowy linen and grey breeches, he cut a wonderful figure.Especially the ribbon, I said, suppressing an urge to laugh.The same color as his eyes.Jamie glared at his sister.No, he said shortly.No ribbons.This isna France, nor yet King Geordies court!I dinna care if its the color of the Virgins cloakno ribbons, Janet!Oh, all right, then, fusspot.There.She pulled the ribbon loose and stood back.Aye, yell do, she said, with satisfaction.Then she turned her penetrating blue eyes on me.Hm, she said, tapping her foot thoughtfully.As I had arrived more or less in rags, it had been necessary to make me two new gowns as quickly as possible; one of homespun for daily use, and one of silk for occasions of state such as this.Better at stitching wounds than cloth, I had helped with the cutting and pinning, but been obliged to leave the design and sewing to Jenny and Mrs.Crook.They had done a beautiful job, and the primrose yellow silk fitted my torso like a glove, with deep folds rolling back over the shoulders and falling behind in panels that flowed into the luxuriant drape of the full skirt.Bowing reluctantly to my absolute refusal to wear corsets, they had instead ingeniously reinforced the upper bodice with whale bone stays ruthlessly stripped from an old corset.Jennys eyes traveled slowly upward from my feet to my head, where they lingered.With a sigh, she reached for the hairbrush.You, too, she said.I sat, face burning, avoiding Jamies eyes, as she carefully removed small twigs and bits of oak leaf from my curls, depositing them on the dresser next to those seined from her brothers hair.Eventually my hair was combed out and pinned up, and she reached into her pocket and pulled out a small lace cap.There, she said, pinning it firmly to the top of my pile of curls.Kertch and all.Verra respectable ye look, Claire.I assumed this was meant as a compliment, and murmured something in reply.Have ye any jewelry, though?Jenny asked.I shook my head.No, Im afraid not.All I had were the pearls Jamie gave me for our wedding, and those Under the circumstances of our departure from Leoch, pearls had been the last thing on my mind.Oh!Jamie exclaimed, suddenly reminded.He dug in the sporran resting on the dresser, and triumphantly pulled out the string of pearls.Where on earth did you get those?I asked in amazement.Murtagh brought them, early this morning, he answered.He went back to Leoch during the trial and got everything he could carrythinking that wed need it if we got away.He looked for us on the road here, but of course wed gone toto the hill, first.Is he still here?I asked.Jamie stood behind me to fasten the necklace.Oh, aye.Hes downstairs eating everything in the kitchen and deviling Mrs.Crook.Aside from his songs, I had heard the wiry little man say less than three dozen words throughout the course of our acquaintanceship, and the thought of his deviling anyone was incongruous.He must feel remarkably at home at Lallybroch, I thought.Who is Murtagh?I asked.I mean, is he a relation of yours?Jamie and Jenny both looked surprised.Oh, aye, the latter replied.She turned to her brother.Heswhat, Jamie?Fathers second cousins uncle?Nephew, he corrected.Ye dinna remember?Old Leo had the two boys, and then  I put my hands over my ears in a marked manner.This seemed to remind Jenny of something, for she clapped her hands together.Earbobs!she exclaimed.I think Ive some pearl ones that will just do with that necklace!Ill fetch them directly.She vanished with her usual light speed.Why does your sister call you Roy?I asked curiously, watching as he tied his stock before the looking glass.He wore the customary expression of a man doing battle with a mortal enemy, common to all men adjusting their neckwear, but he unclamped his lips to grin at me.Och, that.It isna the English name Roy.Its a pet name in Gaelic; the color of my hair.The words ruadhmeans red.He had to spell the word and say it over several times before I could catch any difference.Sounds the same to me, roy, I said, shaking my head.Jamie picked up his sporran and began tucking in the loose bits of things that had come out when he pulled out the pearls.Finding a tangled length of fishing line, he upended the bag over the bed, dumping everything in a pile.He began to sort through it, painstakingly winding up the bits of line and string, finding loose fish hooks and firmly re imbedding them in the piece of cork where they normally rested.I moved over to the bed and inspected the array.Ive never seen so much rubbish in my life, I observed.Youre a regular jackdaw, Jamie.It isna rubbish, he said, stung.Ive uses for all these things.Well, the fish lines, and the hooks, yes.And the string for snares.Even, stretching a point, the pistol wadding and the ballsyou do carry a pistol now and again.And the little snake Willie gave you, I understand that.But the stones?And a snail shell?And a piece of glass?And I bent closer to peer at a dark, furry mass of something.What isit isnt, is it?Jamie, why on earth are you carrying a dried moles foot in your sporran?Against rheumatism, of course.He snatched the object from under my nose and stuffed it back in the badger skin.Oh, of course, I agreed, surveying him with interest.His face was mildly flushed with embarrassment.It must work; you dont creak anywhere.I picked a small Bible out of the remaining rubble and thumbed through it, while he stowed away the rest of his valuable equipment.Alexander William Roderick MacGregor.I read aloud the name on the flyleaf.You said there was a debt owing him, Jamie.What did you mean by that?Oh, that.He sat down beside me on the bed, took the small book from me and gently flipped the pages.I told ye this belonged to a prisoner whod died at Fort William, no?Yes.I didna know the lad myself; he died a month before I came there.But the doctor who gave it to me told me about him, while he tended my back.I think he needed to tell someone about it, and he couldna speak to anyone in the garrison.He closed the book, holding it on his knee, and stared out the window at the gay October sunshine.Alex MacGregor, a lad of eighteen or so, had been arrested for the common offense of cattle lifting.A fair, quiet lad, he had seemed likely to serve his sentence and be released without incident.A week before his release, though, he had been found hanging in the horseshed.There was no doubt hed done it himself, the doctor said.Jamie caressed the leather cover of the small book, drawing one large thumb along the binding.And he did not exactly say what he thought, himself.But he did say that Captain Randall had had a private conversation with the lad a week before.I swallowed, suddenly cold despite the sunshine.And you think  No.His voice was soft and certain.I dinna think.I know, and so did the doctor.And I imagine the sergeant major knew for certain, and thats why he died.He spread his hands flat on his knees, looking down at the long joints of his fingers.Large, strong and capable; the hands of a farmer, the hands of a warrior.He picked up the small Bible and put it into the sporran.Ill tell ye this, mo duinne.One day Jack Randall will die at my hands.And when he is dead, I shall send back that book to the mother of Alex MacGregor, with word that her son is avenged.The air of tension was broken by the sudden reappearance of Jenny, now resplendent in blue silk and her own lace kertch, holding a large box of worn red morocco leather.Jamie, the Currans are come, and Willie Murray and the Jeffries.Youd best go down and have a second breakfast with themIve put out fresh bannocks and salt herring, and Mrs.Crooks doing fresh jam cakes.Oh, aye.Claire, come down when youre ready.Rising hastily, he paused long enough to gather me up for a brief but thorough kiss, and disappeared.His footsteps clattered down the first flight of stairs, slowing on the second to the more sedate pace suitable to a lairds entrance, as he neared the ground floor.Jenny smiled after him, then turned her attention to me.Placing the box on the bed, she threw back the lid, revealing a jumbled array of jewels and baubles.I was surprised to see it; it seemed unlike the neat, orderly Jenny Murray whose iron hand kept the household running smoothly from dawn to dusk.She stirred a finger through the bright clutter, then as though picking up my thought, looked up and smiled at me.I keep thinking I must sort all these things one day.But when I was small, my mother would let me rummage in her box sometimes, and it was like finding magic treasureI never knew what Id pick up next.I suppose I think if it were all orderly, the magic would go, somehow.Daft, no?No, I said, smiling back at her.No, it isnt.We rummaged slowly through the box, holding the cherished bits and pieces of four generations of women.That was my grandmother Frasers, Jenny said, holding up a silver brooch.It was in the shape of a fret worked crescent moon, a small single diamond shining above the tip like a star.And this She pulled out a slender gold band, with a ruby surrounded by brilliants.Thats my wedding ring.Ian spent half a years salary on it, though I told him he was foolish to do it.The fond look on her face suggested that Ian had been anything but foolish.She polished the stone on the bosom of her dress and admired it once more before replacing it in the box.Ill be happy once the babe is born, she said, patting her bulge with a grimace.My fingers are so swollen in the mornings I can scarcely do up my laces, let alone wear my rings.I caught a strange nonmetallic gleam in the depths of the box, and pointed.Whats that?Oh, those, she said, dipping into the box again.Ive never worn them; they dont suit me.But you could wear themyoure tall and queenly, like my mother was.They were hers, ye ken.They were a pair of bracelets.Each made from the curving, almost circular tusk of a wild boar, polished to a deep ivory glow, the ends capped with silver tappets, etched with flowered tracery.Lord, theyre gorgeous!Ive never seen anything soso wonderfully barbaric.Jenny was amused.Aye, that they are.Someone gave them to Mother as a wedding gift, but she never would say who.My father used to tease her now and then about her admirer, but she wouldna tell him, either, just smiled like a cat thats had cream to its supper.Here, try them.The ivory was cool and heavy on my arm.I couldnt resist stroking the deep yellow surface, grained with age.Aye, they suit ye, Jenny declared.And they go wi that yellow gown, as well.Here are the earbobsput these on, and well go down.* * *    Murtagh was seated at the kitchen table, industriously eating ham off the end of his dirk.Passing behind him with a platter, Mrs.Crook dexterously bent and slid three fresh hot bannocks onto his plate, hardly breaking her stride.Jenny was bustling to and fro, preparing and overseeing.Pausing in her progress, she peered over Murtaghs shoulder at his rapidly emptying plate.Dont stint yourself, man, she remarked.Theres another hog in the pen, after all.Begrudge a kinsman a bite, do ye?he asked, not interrupting his chewing.Me?Jenny put both hands on her hips.Heavens, no!After all, yeve only had the four helpings so far.Mrs.Crook, she turned to call to the departing housekeeper, when youve done wi the bannocks, fix this starveling man a bowl of parritch to fill in the chinks with.We dinna want him fainting on the doorstep, ye ken.When Murtagh saw me standing in the doorway, he promptly choked on a bite of ham.Mmmphm, he said, by way of greeting, after Jenny had pounded him helpfully on the back.Nice to see you too, I replied, sitting down opposite him.Thank you, by the way.Mmphm?The question was muffled by half a bannock, spread with honey.For fetching my things from the Castle.Mmp.He dismissed any notion of thanks with a wave that ended in a reach for the butter dish.I brought your wee bits of plant and such as well, he said, with a jerk of the head at the window.Out in the yard, in my saddlebags.Youve brought my medicine box?Thats wonderful!I was delighted.Some of the medicinal plants were rare, and had taken no little trouble to find and prepare properly.But how did you manage?I asked.Once I had recovered from the horror of the witchcraft trial, I often wondered how the occupants of the Castle had taken my sudden arrest and escape.I hope you didnt have any difficulty.Och, no.He took another healthy bite, but waited until it had made its leisurely way down his throat before replying further.Mrs.Fitz had them put away, like, packed up in a box already.I went to her at the first, ye ken, for I wasna sure what reception Id get.Very sensible.I dont imagine Mrs.Fitz would scream at sight of you, I agreed.The bannocks were steaming gently in the cool air, and smelt heavenly.I reached for one, the heavy boars tooth bracelets clinking together on my wrist.I saw Murtaghs eyes on them and adjusted them so he could see the engraved silver end pieces.Arent they lovely?I said.Jenny said they were her mothers.Murtaghs eyes dropped to the bowl of parritch that Mrs.Crook had thrust unceremoniously under his nose.They suit ye, he mumbled.Then, returning suddenly to the earlier subject, he said, No, she wouldna summon help against me.I was well acquent wi Glenna FitzGibbons, some time ago.Oh, a long lost love of yours, was she?I teased, enjoying the incongruous thought of him entwined in amorous embrace with the ample Mrs.Fitz.Murtagh glanced up coldly from his parritch.That she wasna, and Ill thank ye to keep a civil tongue when ye speak of the lady.Her husband was my mothers brother.And she was sore grieved for ye, Ill ha ye to know.I lowered my eyes, abashed, and reached for the honey to cover my embarrassment.The stone jar had been set in a pot of boiling water to liquefy the contents, and it was comfortingly warm to the touch.Im sorry, I said, drizzling the sweet golden fluid over the bannock, watching carefully so as not to spill it.I wondered, you know, what she felt like, whenwhen I  They didna realize at the first ye were gone, the little man said matter of factly, ignoring my apology.When ye didna come in to dinner, they thought maybe youd stayed late in the fields and gone up to your bed without eating; your door was closed.And the next day, when there was all the outcry over the taking of Mistress Duncan, no one thought to look for ye.There was no mention of you, only of her, when the news came, and in all the excitement, no one thought to look for ye.I nodded thoughtfully.No one would have missed me, save those seeking medical treatment; I had spent most of my time in Colums library while Jamie was away.What about Colum?I asked.I was more than idly curious; had he really planned it, as Geilie thought?Murtagh shrugged.He scanned the table for further victuals, apparently spotted nothing to his liking, and leaned back, folding his hands comfortably over his lean midriff.When he had the news from the village, he had the gates closed at once, and forbade anyone from the Castle to go down, for fear of being caught up in the moil.He leaned further back, eyeing me speculatively.Mrs.Fitz thought to find ye, the second day.She said that she asked all the maids if theyd laid eyes on ye.No one had, but one of the girls said she thought perhaps yed gone to the villagemaybe youd taken shelter in a house there.One of the girls, I thought cynically.The one that knew bloody well where I was.He belched softly, not bothering to stifle the sound.I heard Mrs.Fitz turned the Castle upside down, then, and made Colum send down a man to the village, once she was sure ye werena to be found.And when they learned what had happened.A faint look of amusement lighted the dark face.She didna tell me everything, but I gathered she made Himselfs life more of a misery to him than it usually is, naggin at him to send down and free ye by force of armsand not the least bit of use, him arguin that it had gone well beyond the point where he could do that, and now it was in the hands o the examiners, and one thing and another.It must ha been something to see, he said reflectively, twa wills like that, set one against the other.And in the end, it seemed, neither had either triumphed nor given way.Ned Gowan, with his lawyers gift for compromise, had found the way between them, by offering to go himself to the trial, not as representative of the laird, but as an independent advocate.Did she think I might be a witch?I asked curiously.Murtagh snorted briefly.Ive yet to see the auld woman believes in witches, nor the young one, neither.Its men think there must be ill wishes and magic in women, when its only the natural way of the creatures.I begin to see why youve never married, I said.Do ye, then?He pushed back his chair abruptly and rose, pulling the plaid forward over his shoulders.Ill be off.Gie my respects to the laird, he said to Jenny, who reappeared from the front hall, where she had been greeting tenants.Hell be busy, Ive nae doubt.Jenny handed him a large cloth sack, tied in a knot at the mouth, and plainly holding enough provisions for a week.A wee bite for the journey home, she said, dimpling at him.Might last ye at least out of sight o the house.He tucked the knot of the sack snugly into his belt and nodded briefly, turning toward the door.Aye, he said, and if not, yell see the corbies gatherin just beyond the rise, come to pick my bones.A lot of good theyd get from it, she answered cynically, eyeing his scrawny frame.Ive seen more sound flesh on a broomstick.Murtaghs dour face remained unchanged, but a faint gleam showed in his eye, nonetheless.Oh, aye?he said.Weel, Ill tell ye, lass The voices passed down the hall, mingling in amiable insult and argument, vanishing at last in the echoes of the front hall.I sat at the table for a moment longer, idly caressing the warm ivory of Ellen MacKenzies bracelets.At the far off slam of the door, I shook myself and stood up to take my place as the Lady of Lallybroch.* * *    Usually a busy place, on Quarter Day the manor house simply bristled with activity.Tenants came and went all day.Many came only long enough to pay their rents; some stayed all day, wandering about the estate, visiting with friends, taking refreshment in the parlor.Jenny, blooming in blue silk, and Mrs.Crook, starched in white linen, flitted back and forth between kitchen and parlor, overseeing the two maidservants, who staggered to and fro under enormous platters of oatcake, fruitcake, crumbly, and other sweets.Jamie, having introduced me with ceremony to the tenants present in dining room and parlor, then retired into his study with Ian, to receive the tenants singly, to confer with them over the needs of the spring planting, to consult over the sale of wool and grain, to note the activities of the estate, and to set things in order for the next quarter of the year.I puttered cheerfully about the place, visiting with tenants, lending a hand with the refreshments when needed, sometimes just drifting into the background to watch the comings and goings.Recalling Jamies promise to the old woman by the millpond, I waited with some curiosity for the arrival of Ronald MacNab.He came shortly past noon, riding a tall, slip jointed mule, with a small boy clinging to his belt behind.I viewed them covertly from the parlor door, wondering just how accurate his mothers assessment had been.I decided that while drunken sot might be overstating things slightly, Grannie MacNabs general perceptions were acute.Ronald MacNabs hair was long and greasy, carelessly tied back with twine, and his collar and cuffs were grey with dirt.While surely a year or two younger than Jamie, he looked at least fifteen years older, the bones of his face submerged in bloat, small grey eyes dulled and bloodshot.As for the child, he also was scruffy and dirty.Worse, so far as I was concerned, he slunk along behind his father, keeping his eyes on the floor, cringing when Ronald turned and spoke sharply to him.Jamie, who had come to the door of his study, saw it too, and I saw him exchange a sharp look with Jenny, bringing a fresh decanter in answer to his call.She nodded imperceptibly and handed over the decanter.Then, taking the child firmly by the hand, she towed him toward the kitchen, saying, Come along wi me now, laddie.I believe weve a crumbly or two going wantin.Or what about a slice of fruitcake?Jamie nodded formally to Ronald MacNab, standing aside as the man went into the study.Reaching out to shut the door, Jamie caught my eye and nodded toward the kitchen.I nodded back and turned to follow Jenny and young Rabbie.I found them engaged in pleasant converse with Mrs.Crook, who was ladling punch from the big cauldron into a crystal bowl.She tipped a bit into a wooden cup and offered it to the lad, who hung back, eyeing her suspiciously, before finally accepting it.Jenny went on chatting casually to the lad as she loaded platters, receiving little more than grunts in return.Still, the half wild little creature seemed to be relaxing a bit.Your sarks a bit grubby, lad, she observed, leaning forward to turn back the collar.Take it off, and Ill give it a bit of a wash before ye go.Grubby was a gross understatement, but the boy pulled back defensively.I was behind him, though, and at a gesture from Jenny, grabbed him by the arms before he could dart away.He kicked and yowled, but Jenny and Mrs.Crook closed in on him as well, and between the three of us, we peeled the filthy shirt off his back.Ah.Jenny drew in her breath sharply.She was holding the boys head firmly under one arm, and the scrawny back was fully exposed.Welts and scabs scored the flesh on either side of the knobby backbone, some freshly healed, some so old as to be only faded shadows lapping the prominent ribs.Jenny took a good grip on the back of the boys neck, speaking soothingly to him as she released his head.She jerked her head in the direction of the hall, looking at me.Youd better tell him.I knocked tentatively at the study door, holding a plate of honeyed oatcakes as excuse.At Jamies muffled bidding, I opened the door and went in.My face as I served MacNab must have been sufficient, for I didnt have to ask to speak privately with Jamie.He stared meditatively at me for a moment, then turned back to his tenant.Well then, Ronnie, that will do for the grain allotment.Theres the one other thing I meant to speak wi you about, though.Youve a likely lad named Rabbie, I understand, and Im needing a boy of that size to help in the stables.Would ye be willing for him to come?Jamies long fingers played with a goosequill on the desk.Ian, seated at a smaller table to one side, propped his chin on his fists, staring at MacNab with frank interest.MacNab glowered belligerently.I thought he had the irritable resentment of a man who isnt drunk but wishes he were.No, Ive need of the lad, he said curtly.Mm.Jamie lounged back in his chair, hands folded across his middle.Id pay ye for his services, of course.The man grunted and shifted in his chair.My mothers been at ye, eh?I said no, and I meant no.The lads my son, and Ill deal wi him as I see fit.And I see fit to keep him to hame.Jamie eyed MacNab thoughtfully, but turned his attention back to the ledgers without further argument.Late in the afternoon, as the tenants repaired to the warmer reaches of pantry and parlor for refreshment before departing, I spotted Jamie from the window, strolling in leisurely fashion toward the pigshed, arm slung about the scruffy MacNab in comradely style.The pair disappeared behind the shed, presumably to inspect something of agricultural interest, and reappeared within a minute or two, coming toward the house.Jamies arm was still about the shorter mans shoulders, but seemed now to be supporting him.MacNabs face was an unhealthy grey, slicked with sweat, and he walked very slowly, seeming unable to straighten up all the way.Weel, thats good, then, Jamie remarked cheerfully as they came within earshot.Reckon your missus will be glad of the extra money, eh, Ronald?Ah, heres your animal for youfine looking beast, is he no?The moth eaten mule that had brought the MacNabs to the farm shambled out of the yard where it had been enjoying the hospitality of the estate.A wisp of hay still protruded from the corners of its mouth, jerking irregularly as the beast chewed.Jamie gave MacNab a hand under the foot to assist him to his seat; much needed help, by the look of it.MacNab did not speak or wave in response to Jamies voluble God speeds and safe journeys, but only nodded in a dazed way as he left the yard at a walk, seemingly intent on some secret trouble that absorbed his attention.Jamie stood leaning on the fence, exchanging pleasantries as other tenants wended their ways homeward, until the untidy figure of MacNab was out of sight over the crest of the hill.He straightened, gazing down the road, then turned and gave a whistle.A small figure in a torn but clean smock and stained kilt crept out from under the haywagon.Weel, then, young Rabbie, said Jamie genially.Looks as though your fathers given his permission for ye to be a stable lad after all.Im sure as youll be a hard worker and a credit to him, eh?Round, bloodshot eyes stared up dumbly out of the dirty face, and the boy made no response at all, until Jamie reached out, and grasping him gently by the shoulder, turned him toward the horse trough.Therell be some supper waiting ye in the kitchen, laddie.Go and wash a bit first, though; Mrs.Crooks a picky woman.Oh, and Rabbiehe leaned down to whisper to the ladmind your ears, or shell do em for ye.She scrubbed mine for me this morning.He put his hands behind his ears and flapped them solemnly at the boy, who broke into a shy smile and fled toward the trough.Im glad you managed it, I said, taking Jamies arm to go in to supper.With little Rabbie MacNab, I mean.How did you do it, though?He shrugged.Took Ronald back of the brewhouse and fisted him once or twice in the soft parts.Asked him did he want to part wi his son or his liver.He glanced down at me, frowning.It wasna right, but I couldnt think what else to do.And I didna want the lad to go back wi him.It wasnt only Id promised his grannie, either.Jenny told me about the lads back.He hesitated.Ill tell ye, Sassenach.My father whipped me as often as he thought I needed it, and a lot oftener than I thought I did.But I didna cower when he spoke to me.And I dinna think young Rabbie will lie in bed with his wife one day and laugh about it.He hunched his shoulders, with that odd half shrug, something I hadnt seen him do in months.Hes right; the lads his own son, he can do as he likes.And Im not God; only the laird, and thats a good bit lower down.Still He looked down at me with a crooked half smile.Its a damn thin line between justice and brutality, Sassenach.I only hope Ive come down on the right side of it.I put an arm around his waist and hugged him.You did right, Jamie.Ye think so?Yes.We strolled back toward the house, arms about each other.The whitewashed farm buildings glowed amber in the setting sun.Instead of going into the house, though, Jamie steered me up the slight rise behind the manor.Here, sitting on the top rail of a fenced field, we could see the whole of the home farm laid out before us.I laid my head on Jamies shoulder and sighed.He squeezed me gently in response.This is what you were born to do, isnt it, Jamie?Perhaps, Sassenach.He looked out over the fields and buildings, the crofts and the roads, then looked down, a smile suddenly curving the wide mouth.And you, my Sassenach?What were you born for?To be lady of a manor, or to sleep in the fields like a gypsy?To be a healer, or a dons wife, or an outlaws lady?I was born for you, I said simply, and held out my arms to him.Ye know, he observed, letting go at last, youve never said it.Neither have you.I have.The day after we came.I said I wanted you more than anything.And I said that loving and wanting werent necessarily the same thing, I countered.He laughed.Perhaps youre right, Sassenach.He smoothed the hair from my face and kissed my brow.I wanted ye from the first I saw yebut I loved ye when you wept in my arms and let me comfort you, that first time at Leoch.The sun sank below the line of black pines, and the first stars of the evening came out.It was mid November, and the evening air was cold, though the days still kept fine.Standing on the opposite side of the fence, Jamie bent his head, putting his forehead against mine.You first.No, you.Why?Im afraid.Of what, my Sassenach?The darkness was rolling in over the fields, filling the land and rising up to meet the night.The light of the new crescent moon marked the ridges of brow and nose, crossing his face with light.Im afraid if I start I shall never stop.He cast a glance at the horizon, where the sickle moon hung low and rising.Its nearly winter, and the nights are long, mo duinne.He leaned across the fence, reaching, and I stepped into his arms, feeling the heat of his body and the beat of his heart.I love you.32    HARD LABOR    A few days later, near sunset, I was on the hill behind the house, digging up the tubers of a small patch of corydalis I had found.Hearing the rustle of footsteps approaching through the grass, I turned, expecting to see Jenny or Mrs.Crook come to call me to supper.Instead it was Jamie, hair spiked with dampness from his predinner ablutions, still in his shirt, knotted together between his legs for working in the fields.He came up behind me and put his arms around me, resting his chin on my shoulder.Together we watched the sun sinking behind the pines, robed in gold and purple glory.The landscape faded quietly around us, but we stayed where we were, wrapped in contentment.Finally, as it began to grow dark, I could hear Jenny calling from the house below.Wed better go in, I said, reluctantly stirring.Mmm.Jamie didnt move, but merely tightened his hold, still gazing into the deepening shadows, as though trying to fix each stone and blade of grass in memory.I turned to him and slipped my arms around his neck.What is it?I asked quietly.Must we leave soon?My heart sank at the prospect of leaving Lallybroch, but I knew that it was dangerous for us to stay too much longer; another visit from the redcoats could happen at any time, with much more sinister results.Aye.Tomorrow, or the day after, at latest.There are English at Knockchoilum; its twenty miles from here, but thats only two days ride in fine weather.I started to slither off the fence, but Jamie slid an arm under my knees and lifted me, holding me against his chest.I could feel the heat of the sun still in his skin, and smell the warm dusty scent of sweat and oat grass.He had been helping with the last of the harvesting, and the smell reminded me of a supper the week before, when I knew that Jenny, always friendly and polite, had finally accepted me fully as a member of the family.Harvesting was grueling work, and Ian and Jamie were often nodding by the end of supper.On one occasion, I had left the table to fetch a brose pudding for dessert, and returned to find both of them sound asleep, and Jenny laughing quietly to herself amid the remains of supper.Ian lay slumped in his chair, chin resting on his chest, breathing heavily.Jamie had laid his cheek on his folded arms and sprawled forward across the table, snoring peacefully between the platter and the peppermill.Jenny took the pudding from me and served us both, shaking her head at the slumbering men.They were yawning so much I wondered, ye know, she said, what would happen if I stopped talking.So I kept quiet, and sure enough, two minutes later they were out, the both of them.She smoothed Ians hair tenderly off his forehead.Thats why therere so few babies born in July here, she said, with a wicked cock of the eyebrow at me.The men cant keep awake long enough in November to start one.It was true enough, and I laughed.Jamie stirred and snorted next to me, and I laid a hand on the back of his neck to soothe him.His lips curved at once in a soft, reflexive smile, then relaxed into sleep once more.Jenny, watching him, said, Thats funny, that is.Ive not seen him do that since he was quite small.Do what?She nodded.Smile in his sleep.He used always to do it, if ye came by and petted him in his cradle, or even later, in his trundle.Sometimes Mother and I would take it in turns to stroke his head and see could we make him smile; he always would.Thats odd, isnt it?I experimented, running a hand gently down the back of his head and neck.Sure enough, I was rewarded at once by a singularly sweet smile that lingered for a moment before the lines of his face relaxed once more into the rather stern expression he presented when asleep.I wonder why he does that, I said, watching him in fascination.Jenny shrugged and grinned at me.I imagine it means hes happy.* * *    In the event, we did not leave next day.In the middle of the night, I was wakened by low conversation in the room.Rolling over, I saw Ian bending over the bed, holding a candle.The babes on its way, said Jamie, seeing me awake.He sat up, yawning.A bit early, Ian?Ye never know.Small Jamie was late.Better early than late, I reckon.Ians smile was quick and nervous.Sassenach, can ye deliver a child?Or had I best go for the midwife?Jamie turned to me, questioning.I didnt hesitate in my answer.I shook my head.Get the midwife.I had seen only three births during my training; all conducted in a sterile operating room, the patient draped and anesthetized, nothing visible save the grotesquely swelling perineum and the suddenly emergent head.Having seen Jamie on his way to fetch the midwife, Mrs.Martins, I followed Ian up the stairs.Jenny was sitting in a chair near the window, leaning comfortably back.She had put on an old nightgown, stripped the bed and spread an aged quilt over the feather mattress, and was now just sitting.Waiting.Ian hovered nervously over her.Jenny smiled too, but with a distracted, inward look, as though listening to something far off, which only she could hear.Ian, fully dressed, fidgeted about the room, picking things up and putting them down, until Jenny at last ordered him to leave.Go downstairs and rouse Mrs.Crook, Ian, she said, smiling to ease the dismissal.Tell her to get things ready for Mrs.Martins.Shell ken what to do.She drew in her breath sharply then, and put both hands on her distended abdomen.I stared, seeing her belly draw up suddenly tight and round.She bit her lip and breathed heavily for a moment, then relaxed.Her belly had resumed its normal shape, a slightly pendant teardrop, rounded at both ends.Ian put a hand hesitantly on her shoulder, and she covered it with her own, smiling up at him.Then tell her to feed ye, man.You and Jamie will be needing a bit to eat.They say the second babe comes faster than the first; maybe by the time youre done wi breakfast, Ill be ready for a bite myself.He squeezed her shoulder tightly, and kissed her, murmuring something in her ear before turning to go.He hesitated in the doorway, looking back, but she waved him firmly away.It seemed a very long time before Jamie arrived with the midwife, and I grew more nervous as the contractions grew stronger.Second babies were said to be faster, as a rule.What if this one decided to arrive before Mrs.Martins?At first, Jenny carried on light conversation with me, only pausing to bend forward slightly, holding her stomach, as the contractions tightened their grip.But she quickly lost the urge to talk, and lay back, resting quietly in between the increasingly powerful pains.Finally, after one that almost bent her double in her chair, she rose to her feet, staggering.Help me walk a bit, Claire, she said.Unsure what was the proper procedure, I did as she said, grasping her tightly under the arm to help her stand upright.We made several slow circuits of the room, pausing when a contraction struck, going on when it eased.Shortly before the midwife arrived, Jenny made her way to the bed and lay down.Mrs.Martins was a reassuring looking person; tallish and thin, she had wide shoulders and muscular forearms, and the sort of kind, down to earth expression that invited confidence.Two vertical creases between her iron grey brows, always visible, deepened when she was concentrating.They stayed shallow as she made her preliminary examination.Everything normal so far, then.Mrs.Crook had produced a pile of clean, ironed sheets for our use, and Mrs.Martins took one of these, still folded, and pushed it under Jenny.I was startled to see the dark stain of blood between her thighs, as she raised herself slightly.Seeing my look, Mrs.Martins nodded reassuringly.Aye.Bloody show, its called.Its all right.Its only when the blood is bright red, and a terrible lot all at once, that ye worry.Theres nothing wrong.We all settled down to wait.Mrs.Martins talked quietly and comfortingly to Jenny, rubbing the small of her back, pressing hard during the contractions.As the pains became more frequent, Jenny began to clamp her lips together and snort heavily through her nose.Often, there was a deep, faint groan as the full force of the pain came on.Jennys hair was soaked with perspiration by this time, and her face bright red with the strain.Watching her, I realized fully why it was called labor.Giving birth was bloody hard work.Over the next two hours, little progress appeared to be made, except that the pains grew obviously stronger.Able at first to answer questions, Jenny quit responding, lying panting at the end of each contraction, face fading from red to white in a matter of seconds.She clamped her lips through the next one, beckoning me to her side as it eased.If the child lives she said, gasping for air, and its a girlher name is Margaret.Tell Ianname her Margaret Ellen.Yes, of course, I soothed.But youll be able to tell him yourself.It wont be long, now.She only shook her head in determined negation, and clenched her teeth as the next pain came.Mrs.Martins took me by the arm, steering me away.Dinna mind it, lassie, she said matter of factly.They always think theyre goin to die about now.Oh, I said, mildly relieved.Mind ye, she said, in a lower voice, sometimes they do.Even Mrs.Martins seemed a trifle worried as the pains went on, with no appreciable progress.Jenny was tiring badly; as each pain eased, her body went slack, and she even dozed off, as though seeking escape in small intervals of sleep.Then, as the remorseless fist grasped her once again, she would wake fighting and groaning with effort, writhing to the side to curl protectively over the rigid lump of the unborn child.Could the child bebackward?I asked, in a low voice, shy about suggesting such a thing to an experienced midwife.Mrs.Martins seemed not at all offended by the suggestion, though; the lines between her brows merely deepened as she looked at the straining woman.When the next pain eased, Mrs.Martins flung back the sheet and nightgown, and went rapidly to work, pressing here and there on the huge mound with quick, skilled fingers.It took several tries, as the probing seemed to incite the pains, and examination was impossible during the relentlessly powerful contractions.At last she drew back, thinking, tapping one foot abstractedly as she watched Jenny writhe through two more of the spine wrenching pains.As she jerked on the sheets, one of the strained linens parted suddenly with a rending tear.As though this had been a signal, Mrs.Martins started forward with decision, beckoning to me.Lean her back a bit, lass, Mrs.Martins instructed me, not at all disconcerted by Jennys cries.I supposed she had heard her share of screaming.At the next relaxation, Mrs.Martins plunged into action.Grasping the child through the momentarily flaccid walls of the womb, she heaved, trying to turn it.Jenny screamed and jerked my arms as another contraction started.Mrs.Martins tried again.And again.And again.Unable to keep from pushing, Jenny was wearing herself far past the point of exhaustion, her body struggling past the bounds of ordinary strength as it strove to force the child into the world.Then it worked.There was a sudden strange fluid shifting, and the amorphous bulk of the child turned under Mrs.Martinss hands.All at once, the shape of Jennys belly was altered, and there was an immediate sense of getting down to business.Now push.She did, and Mrs.Martins dropped to her knees beside the bed.Apparently she saw some sign of progress, for she rose and hastily snatched a small bottle from the table where she had put it when she came in.She poured a small amount of what looked like oil on her fingertips, and began to rub it gently between Jennys legs.Jenny made a deep and vicious sound of protest at being touched as the next pain came on, and Mrs.Martins took her hand away.Jenny sagged into inertness and the midwife resumed her gentle massage, crooning to her patient, telling her everything was well, just to rest, and nowpush!During the next contraction, Mrs.Martins put her hand on top of Jennys belly and pushed down strongly.Jenny shrieked, but the midwife kept pushing until the contraction eased.Push with me on the next one, the midwife said.Its almost here.I put my hands above Mrs.Martinss on Jennys belly, and at her signal, all three of us pushed together.There was a deep, victorious grunt from Jenny, and a slimy blob swelled suddenly between her thighs.She straightened her legs against the mattress and pushed once more, and Margaret Ellen Murray shot into the world like a greased pig.A little later, I straightened from wiping Jennys smiling face with a damp rag and glanced out the window.It was nearly sunset.Im all right, Jenny said.Quite all right.The broad grin of delight with which she had greeted the delivery of her daughter had turned into a small, permanent smile of deep contentment.She reached up with an unsteady hand and touched my sleeve.Go tell Ian, she said.Hell be worrit.To my cynical eyes, it didnt look it.The scene in the study, where Ian and Jamie had taken refuge, strongly resembled a premature celebratory debauch.An empty decanter stood on the sideboard, accompanied by several bottles, and a strong alcoholic fume hung over the room like a cloud.The proud father appeared to have passed out, head resting on the lairds desk.The laird himself was still conscious, but bleary eyed, leaning back against the paneling and blinking like an owl.Outraged, I stamped over to the desk and gripped Ian by the shoulder, shaking him roughly and ignoring Jamie, who pushed himself upright, saying, Sassenach, wait  Ian was not quite unconscious.His head came up reluctantly, and he looked at me with a set, rigid face, eyes bleak and pleading holes.I realized suddenly that he thought I had come to tell him that Jenny was dead.I relaxed my grip and patted him gently instead.Shes all right, I said, softly.You have a daughter.He laid his head down on his arms again, and I left him, his thin shoulders shaking as Jamie patted his back.The survivors now revived and cleaned up, the Murray Fraser families gathered in Jennys room for a celebratory supper.Little Margaret, tidied for inspection and swaddled in a small blanket, was given to her father, who received his new offspring with an expression of beatific reverence.Hello, wee Maggie, he whispered, touching the tiny button of a nose with one fingertip.His new daughter, unimpressed by the introduction, closed her eyes in concentration, stiffened, and urinated on her fathers shirt.During the brief bustle of hilarity and repair occasioned by this lapse of good manners, small Jamie succeeded in escaping from the clutches of Mrs.Crook and flung himself onto Jennys bed.She grunted slightly in discomfort, but put out a hand and gathered him in, waving at Mrs.Crook to let him be.My mama!he declared, burrowing into Jennys side.Well, who else?she asked reasonably.Here, laddie.She hugged him, and kissed the top of his head, and he relaxed, reassured, and snuggled against her.She gently pushed his head down, stroking his hair.Lay your head then, man, she said.Past your bedtime.Lay your head.Comforted by her presence, he put a thumb in his mouth and fell asleep.Given a turn to hold the baby, Jamie proved remarkably competent, cupping the small fuzzy skull in the palm of one hand like a tennis ball.He seemed reluctant to hand the child back to Jenny, who cuddled her against her breasts, crooning soft endearments.At last we made our way to our own room, which seemed silent and empty in contrast to the warm family scene we had just left, Ian kneeling by his wifes bed, hand resting on small Jamie as Jenny nursed the new baby.I was conscious for the first time of just how tired I was; it was nearly twenty four hours since Ian had roused me.Jamie closed the door quietly behind him.Without speaking, he came behind me and undid the fastenings of my gown.His hands reached around me and I lay back gratefully against his chest.Then he bent his head to kiss me and I turned, putting my own arms around his neck.I felt not only very tired, but very tender, and not a little sad.Perhaps its as well, Jamie said slowly, as though to himself.Whats as well?That youre barren.He couldnt see my face, buried in his chest, but he must have felt me stiffen.Aye, I knew that long ago.Geillis Duncan told me, soon after we wed.He stroked my back gently.I regretted it a bit at first, but then I began to think it was as well; living as we must, it would be verra difficult if you were to get with child.And nowhe shivered slightlynow I think I am glad of it; I wouldna want ye to suffer that way.I wouldnt mind, I said, after a long while, thinking of the rounded, fuzzy head and tiny fingers.I would.He kissed the top of my head.I saw Ians face; it was like his own flesh was being torn, each time Jenny screamed.My arms were around him, stroking the ridged scars on his back.I can bear pain, myself, he said softly, but I couldna bear yours.That would take more strength than I have.33    THE WATCH    Jenny recovered rapidly after Margarets birth, insisting on coming downstairs the day following the delivery.At the combined insistence of Ian and Jamie, she reluctantly refrained from doing any work, only supervising from the sofa in the parlor where she reclined, baby Margaret sleeping in her cradle alongside.Not content to sit idle, though, within a day or two she had ventured as far as the kitchen, and then the back garden.Sitting on the wall, the well wrapped baby in a carrying sling, she was keeping me company as I simultaneously pulled dead vines and kept an eye on the enormous cauldron in which the households laundry was boiled.Mrs.Crook and the maids had already removed the clean wash to be hung and dried; now I was waiting for the water to cool sufficiently to be dumped out.Small Jamie was helping me, yanking out plants with mad abandon and flinging bits of stick in all directions.I called a warning as he ventured too near the cauldron, then raced after him as he ignored me.Luckily the pot had cooled quickly; the water was no more than warm.Warning him to keep back with his mother, I grasped the pot and tilted it away from the iron contrivance that held it and kept it from falling.I sprang back out of the way as the dirty water cascaded over the lip of the pot, steaming in the chilly air.Young Jamie, squatting beside me on his heels, splatted his hands joyfully in the warm mud, and black droplets flew all over my skirts.His mother slid down from the wall, yanked him up by the collar and dealt him a smart clout on the backside.Have ye no sense, gille?Look at ye!Theres your shirtll have to go and be washed again!And look what yeve done to your aunties skirt, ye wee heathen!It doesnt matter, I protested, seeing the miscreants lower lip quiver.Weel, it matters to me, said Jenny, giving her offspring the benefit of a gimlet eye.Say sorry to your auntie, laddie, then get ye into the house and have Mrs.Crook give ye a bit of a wash.She patted his bottom, gently this time, and gave him a push in the direction of the house.We were turning back to the mass of sodden clothes, when the sound of hoofbeats came from the road.Thatll be Jamie back, I expect, I said, listening.Hes early, though.Jenny shook her head, peering intently toward the road.Not his horse.The horse, when it appeared at the crest of a hill, was not one she knew, to judge from her frown.The man aboard, though, was no stranger.She stiffened beside me, then began to run toward the gate, wrapping both arms around the baby to hold it steady.Its Ian!she called to me.He was tattered and dusty and bruised about the face, as he slid off his horse.One bruise on his forehead was swollen, with a nasty split that went through the eyebrow.Jenny caught him under the arm as he hit the ground, and it was only then I saw that his wooden leg was gone.Jamie, he gasped.We met the Watch near the mill.Waiting for us.They knew we were coming.My stomach lurched.Is he alive?He nodded, panting for breath.Aye.Not wounded, either.They took him to the west, toward Killin.Jennys fingers were exploring his face.Are ye bad hurt, man?He shook his head.No.They took my horse and my leg; they didna need to kill me to stop me following.Jenny glanced at the horizon, where the sun lay just above the trees.Maybe four oclock, I estimated.Ian followed her gaze and anticipated her question.We met them near midday.It took me over two hours to get to a place that had a horse.She stood still, for a moment, calculating, then turned to me with decision.Claire.Help Ian to the house, will ye, and if he needs aught in the way of doctoring, do it as fast as ye can.Ill give the babe to Mrs.Crook and fetch the horses.She was gone before either of us could protest.Does she meanbut she cant!I exclaimed.She cant mean to leave the baby!Ian was leaning heavily on my shoulder as we made our way slowly up the path to the house.He shook his head.Maybe not.But I dinna think she means to let the English hang her brother, either.* * *    It was growing dark by the time we reached the spot where Jamie and Ian had been ambushed.Jenny slid off her horse and cast about through the bushes like a small terrier, pushing branches out of her way and muttering things under her breath that sounded suspiciously like some of her brothers better curses.East, she said, finally coming out of the trees, scratched and dirty.She beat dead leaves from her skirt, and took her horses reins from my numbed hands.We canna follow in the dark, but at least I know which way to go, come the dawn.We made a simple camp, hobbling the horses and building a small fire.I admired the efficiency with which Jenny had done it, and she smiled.I used to make Jamie and Ian show me things, when they were young.How to build fires, and climb treeseven how to skin things.And how to track.She glanced again in the direction taken by the Watch.Dinna worry, Claire.She smiled at me and sat down by the fire.Twenty horses canna go far through the brush, but two can.The Watch will be taking the road toward Eskadale, by the looks of it.We can cut over the hills and meet them near Midmains.Her nimble fingers were tugging at the bodice of her gown.I stared in amazement as she spread the folds of cloth and pulled down the top of her underblouse to show her breasts.They were very large, and looked hard, swollen with milk.In my ignorance, I had not thought to wonder what a nursing mother does if deprived of her nursling.I canna leave the babe for long, she said in answer to my thoughts, grimacing as she cupped one breast from beneath.Ill burst.In response to the touch, milk had begun to drip from the engorged nipple, thin and bluish.Pulling a large kerchief from her pocket, Jenny tucked it beneath her breast.There was a small pewter cup on the ground beside her, one she had taken from the saddlebag.Pressing the lip of the cup just below the nipple, she gently stroked the breast between two fingers, squeezing gently toward the nipple.The milk dripped faster in response, then suddenly the areole around the nipple contracted and the milk spurted out in a tiny jet of surprising force.I didnt know it did that!I blurted, staring in fascination.Jenny moved the cup to catch the stream, and nodded.Oh, aye.The babes sucking starts it, but once the milk lets down, all the child need do is swallow.Oh, that feels better.She closed her eyes briefly in relief.She emptied the cup onto the ground, remarking, Shame to waste it, but there isna much to do wi it, is there?Switching hands, she placed the cup again and repeated the process with the other breast.Its a nuisance, she said, looking up to see me still watching.Everything to do wi bairns is a nuisance, almost.Still, yed never choose not to have them.No, I answered softly.You wouldnt choose that.She looked across the fire at me, face kind and concerned.It isna your time yet, she said.But youll have bairns of your own one day.I laughed a little shakily.First wed better find the father.She emptied the second cup and began readjusting her dress.Oh, well find them.Tomorrow.We have to, for I canna stay away from wee Maggie much longer than that.And once weve found them?I asked.What then?She shrugged and reached for the blanket rolls.That depends on Jamie.And on how much hes made them hurt him.* * *    Jenny was right; we did find the Watch the next day.We left our campsite before full day, pausing only long enough for her to express more milk.She seemed to be able to find trails where none existed, and I followed her without question into a heavily wooded area.Quick travel was impossible through the brushy undergrowth, but she assured me that we were taking a much more direct route than the one the Watch would have to follow, bound as they were to roads by the size of their group.We came on them near noon.I heard the jingle of harness and the casual voices I had heard once before, and put out a hand to stop Jenny, who was following me for the moment.Theres a ford in the stream below, she whispered to me.It sounds as though theyve stopped there to water the horses.Sliding down, she took both sets of reins and tethered our own horses, then, beckoning to me to follow, she slid into the undergrowth like a snake.From the vantage point to which she led me, on a small ledge overlooking the ford, we could see almost all of the men of the Watch, mostly dismounted and talking in casual groups, some sitting on the ground eating, some leading the horses in groups of two and three to the water.What we couldnt see was Jamie.Do you suppose theyve killed him?I whispered in panic.I had counted every man twice, to be sure I had missed no one.There were twenty men and twenty six horses; all in plain view, so far as I could see.But no hint of a prisoner, and no telltale gleam of sun on red hair.I doubt it, Jenny answered.But theres only one way to find out.She began to squirm backward from the ledge.Whats that?Ask.The road narrowed as it left the ford, becoming little more than a dusty trail through dense stands of pine and alder on either side.The trail was not wide enough for the Watch to ride two abreast; each man would have to pass down it in single file.As the last man in the line approached a bend in the trail, Jenny Murray stepped suddenly out in the road ahead of him.His horse shied, and the man struggled to rein it in, cursing.As he opened his mouth to demand indignantly what she meant by this behavior, I stepped out of the bush behind, and whacked him solidly behind the ear with a fallen branch.Taken completely by surprise, he lost his balance as the horse shied again, and fell off into the roadway.He wasnt stunned; the blow had only knocked him over.Jenny remedied this deficiency with the assistance of a good sized rock.She grabbed the horses reins and gestured violently to me.Come on!she whispered.Get him off the road before they notice hes gone.So it was that when Robert MacDonald of the Glen Elrive Watch recovered consciousness, it was to find himself securely tied to a tree, looking down the barrel of a pistol held by the steely eyed sister of his erstwhile prisoner.What have ye done wi Jamie Fraser?she demanded.MacDonald shook his head dazedly, obviously thinking her a figment of his imagination.An attempt to move put paid to this notion, and after an allowance for the statutory amount of cursing and threatening, he at last reconciled himself to the idea that the only way to get loose was to tell us what we wanted to know.Hes dead, MacDonald said sullenly.Then, as Jennys finger tightened ominously on the trigger, he added in sudden panic, It wasna me!It was his own fault!Jamie, he said, had been mounted double, arms bound with a leather strap, behind one of the Watch, riding between two other men.He had seemed docile enough, and they had taken no particular precautions when fording the river six miles from the mill.Damn fool threw himself off the horse and into the deep water, said MacDonald, shrugging as well as he could with his hands tied behind him.We fired at him.Must have hit him, for he didna come up again.But the streams swift just below the ford, and its deep.We searched a bit, but no body.Must ha been carried downstream.Now, for Gods sake, ladies, will ye no untie me!After repeated threats from Jenny had elicited no further details or changes in his story, we decided to accept it as true.Declining to free MacDonald altogether, Jenny did at least loosen his bonds, so that given time, he might struggle out of them.Then we ran.Do you think hes dead?I puffed, as we reached the tethered horse.I dont.Jamie swims like a fish, and Ive seen him hold his breath for three minutes at a time.Come on.Were going to search the river bank.We cast up and down the banks of the river, stumbling on rocks, splashing in the shallows, scratching our hands and faces on the willows that trawled their branches in the pools.At last Jenny gave a triumphant shout, and I splashed my way across, balancing precariously on the mossy rocks that lined the bottom of the burn, shallow at this spot.She was holding a leather strap, still fastened in a circle.A smear of blood discolored one side.Wiggled out of it here, she said, bending the circlet between her hands.She looked back in the direction we had come, down that jagged fall of tangled rocks, deep pools and foaming rapids, and shook her head.However did ye manage, Jamie?she said, half to herself.We found an area of flattened grass, not far from the verge, where he had evidently lain to rest.I found a small brownish smudge on the bark of an aspen nearby.Hes hurt, I said.Aye, but hes moving, Jenny answered, looking at the ground as she paced back and forth.Are you good at tracking?I asked hopefully.Im no much of a hunter, she replied, setting off with me close behind, but if I canna follow something the size of Jamie Fraser through dry bracken, then Im daft as well as blind.Sure enough, a broad track of crushed brown fern led up the side of the hill and disappeared into a thick clump of heather.Circling around this point turned up no further evidence, nor did calling produce any answer.Hell be gone, Jenny said, sitting down on a log and fanning herself.I thought she looked pale, and realized that kidnapping and threatening armed men was no pursuit for a woman who had given birth less than a week before.Jenny, I said, you have to go back.Besides, he might go back to Lallybroch.She shook her head.No, that he wouldna.Whatever MacDonald told us, theyre no likely to give up so easy, not with a reward at hand.If they havena hunted him down yet, its because they couldnt.But theyll have sent someone back to keep an eye on the farm, just in case.No, thats the one place he wouldna go.She pulled at the neck of her gown.The day was cold, but she was sweating slightly, and I could see growing dark stains on the bosom of her dress, from leaking milk.She saw me looking and nodded.Aye, Ill have to go back soon.Mrs.Crooks nursing the lassie wi goats milk and sugar water, but she canna do without me much longer, nor me without her.I hate to leave ye alone, though.I didnt much care for the thought of having to hunt alone through the Scottish Highlands for a man who might be anywhere, either, but I put a bold face on it.Ill manage, I said.It could be worse.At least hes alive.True.She glanced at the sun, low over the horizon.Ill stay wi ye through the night, at least.Huddled around the fire at night, we didnt talk much.Jenny was preoccupied with thoughts of her abandoned child, me with thoughts of just how I was to proceed on my own, alone with no real knowledge of geography or Gaelic.Suddenly Jennys head snapped up, listening.I sat up and listened myself, but heard nothing.I peered into the dark woods in the direction Jenny was looking, but saw no gleaming eyes in the depths, thank God.When I turned back to the fire, Murtagh was sitting on the other side, calmly warming his hands at the blaze.Jenny snapped round at my exclamation, and uttered a short laugh of surprise.I could ha cut both your throats before ye ever looked in the right direction, the little man observed.Oh, could ye then?Jenny was sitting with her knees drawn up, hands clasped near her ankles.With a lightning dart, her hand went under her skirt and the blade of a sgian dhu flashed in the firelight.None sae bad, Murtagh agreed, nodding sagely.Is the wee Sassenach that good?No, said Jenny, restoring her blade to her stocking.So its good youll be with her.Ian sent for ye, I expect?The little man nodded.Aye.Did ye find the Watch yet?We told him of our progress to date.At the news that Jamie had escaped, I could have sworn that a muscle twitched near the corner of his mouth, but it would have been stretching matters to call it a smile.At length, Jenny rose, folding her blanket.Where are you going?I asked in surprise.Home.She nodded at Murtagh.Hell be wi ye now; you dont need me, and theres others that do.Murtagh looked up at the sky.The waning moon was faintly visible behind a haze of cloud, and a soft spatter of rain whispered in the pine boughs above us.The morning will do.The winds risin, and no one will move far tonight.Jenny shook her head and went on tucking her hair beneath her kerchief.I know my way.And if none will move tonight, theres none will hinder me on the road, no?Murtagh sighed impatiently.Youre stubborn as your ox of a brother, beggin your pardon.Little reason to hurry back, so far as I can seeI doubt your good man will ha taken a doxy to his bed in the time yeve been gone.You see as far as the end o your nose, duine, and thats short enough, Jenny answered sharply.And if yeve lived so long without knowing better than to stand between a nursing mother and a hungry child, youve not sense enough to hunt hogs, let alone find a man in the heather.Murtagh raised his hands in surrender.Oh, aye, yell take your own way.I didna ken I was tryin to talk sense to a wild sow.Get a tush through the leg for my trouble, I expect.Jenny laughed unexpectedly, dimpling.I expect ye might at that, ye auld rogue.She bent and heaved the heavy saddle up on her knee.See that ye take care with my good sister, then, and send word when yeve found Jamie.As she turned to saddle the horse, Murtagh added, By the bye, yell reckon to find a new kitchen maid when ye reach home.She paused and eyed him, then slowly set the saddle on the ground.And who might that be?she asked.The Widow MacNab, he replied, with deliberation.She was still for a moment, nothing moving but the kerchief and cloak that stirred in the rising wind.How?she asked at last.Murtagh bent to pick up the saddle.He heaved it up and secured the girth with what seemed like one effortless motion.Fire, he said, giving a final tug to the stirrup leather.Watch your way as ye pass the high field; the ashes will still be warm.He cupped his hands to give her a foot up, but she shook her head and took the reins instead, beckoning to me.Walk wi me to the top of the hill, Claire, if ye will.The air was cold and heavy, away from the fire.My skirts were damp from sitting on the ground, and clung to my legs as I walked.Jennys head was bent against the wind, but I could see her profile, lips pale and set with chill.It was MacNab that gave Jamie to the Watch?I asked at last.She nodded slowly.Aye.Ian will have found out, or one of the other men; it doesna matter which.It was late November, well past Guy Fawkes Day, but I had a sudden vision of a bonfire, flames leaping up timbered walls and sprouting in the thatch like the tongues of the Holy Ghost, while the fire within roared its prayers for the damned.And inside, the guy, an effigy crouched in ash on his own hearthstone, ready to fall into black dust at the next blast of cold wind to sweep through the shell of his home.There is a fine line sometimes, between justice and brutality.I realized Jenny was looking full at me, questioning, and I returned her gaze with a nod.We stood together, in this case at least, on the same side of that grim and arbitrary line.We paused at the top of the hill, Murtagh a dark speck by the fire below.Jenny rummaged for a moment in the side pocket of her skirt, then pressed a small wash leather bag into my hand.The rents from quarter day, she said.Ye might need it.I tried to give the money back, insisting that Jamie would not want to take money that was needed for the running of the estate, but she would have none of it.And while Janet Fraser was half her brothers size, she more than matched his stubbornness.Outclassed, I gave up at last, and tucked the money safely away in the recesses of my own costume.At Jennys insistence, I took also the small sgian dhu she pressed upon me.Its Ians, but he has another, she said.Put it into your stocking top, and hold it with your garter.Dont leave it off, even when ye sleep.She paused a moment, as though there were something else she meant to say.Apparently there was.Jamie said, she said carefully, that ye mighttell me things sometimes.And he said that if ye did, I was to do as ye said.Is thereanything ye wish to tell me?Jamie and I had discussed the necessity for preparing Lallybroch and its inhabitants against the coming disasters of the Rising.But we had thought then that there was time.Now I had no time, or most a few minutes, in which to give this new sister I held dear enough information to guard Lallybroch against the coming storm.Being a prophet was a very uncomfortable occupation, I thought, not for the first time.I felt considerable sympathy with Jeremiah and his Lamentations.I also realized exactly why Cassandra was so unpopular.Still, there was no help for it.On the crest of a Scottish hill, the night wind of an autumn storm whipping my hair and skirts like the sheets of a banshee, I turned my face to the shadowed skies and prepared to prophesy.Plant potatoes, I said.Jennys mouth dropped slightly open, then she firmed her jaw and nodded briskly.Potatoes.Aye.Theres none closer than Edinburgh, but Ill send for them.How many?As many as you can.Theyre not planted in the Highlands now, but they will be.Theyre a root crop that will keep for a long time, and the yield is better than wheat.Put as much ground as you can into crops that can be stored.Theres going to be a famine, a bad one, in two years.If theres land or property thats not productive now, sell it, for gold.Theres going to be war, and slaughter.Men will be hunted, here and everywhere through the Highlands.I thought for a moment.Is there a priest hole in the house?No, it was built well after the Protectors time.Make one then, or some safe place to hide.I hope Jamie wont need it, I swallowed hard at the thought, but someone may.All right.Is that all?Her face was serious and intent in the half light.I blessed Jamie for his forethought in warning her, and her for her trust in her brother.She didnt ask me how, or why, but only took careful note of what I said, and I knew my hasty instructions would be followed.Thats all.All I can think of just now, anyway.I tried to smile, but the effort seemed unconvincing, even to me.Hers was better.She touched my cheek briefly in farewell.God go wi ye, Claire.Well meet againwhen ye bring my brother home.PART SIX      The Search      34    DOUGALS STORY    Whatever the disadvantages of civilization, I reflected grimly, the benefits were undeniable.Take telephones, for example.For that matter, take newspapers, which were popular in such metropolitan centers as Edinburgh or even Perth, but completely unknown in the wilderness of the Scottish Highlands.With no such methods of mass communication, news spread from one person to the next at the speed of a mans stride.People generally found out what they needed to know, but with a delay of several weeks.Consequently, faced with the problem of finding exactly where Jamie was, there was little to rely on except the possibility of someone encountering him and sending word back to Lallybroch.That was a process that might take weeks.And the winter would set in shortly, making travel to Beauly impossible.I sat feeding sticks to the fire, pondering the possibilities.Which way would Jamie have gone from the point of his escape?Not back to Lallybroch, to be sure, and almost certainly not north, into the MacKenzie lands.South to the border lands, where he might meet again with Hugh Munro or some of his earlier rough companions?No, most likely northeast, toward Beauly.But if I could figure that out, so could the men of the Watch.Murtagh returned from his gathering, dumping an armload of sticks on the ground.He sat down crosslegged on a fold of his plaid, wrapping the rest around himself to keep out the chill.He cast an eye toward the sky, where the moon glowed behind racing clouds.It wilna snow just yet, he said, frowning.Another week, maybe two.We might reach Beauly before then.Well, nice to have confirmation of my deductions, I supposed.You think hell be there?The little clansman shrugged, hunching his plaid higher around his shoulders.No tellin.The travel will no be as easy for him, lyin hid during the day, and staying off the roads.And he hasna got a horse.He scratched his stubbled chin thoughtfully.We canna find him; wed best let him find us.How?Send up flares?I suggested sarcastically.One thing about Murtagh; no matter what incongruous thing I said, he could be counted on to behave as though I hadnt spoken.Ive brought your wee packet of medicines, he said, nodding toward the saddlebags on the ground.And youve enough of a reputation near Lallybroch; youll be known as a healer through most of the countryside near.He nodded to himself.Aye, thatll do well enough.And without further explanations, he lay down, rolled up in his plaid and went calmly to sleep, ignoring the wind in the trees, the light patter of rain, and me.I found out soon enough what he meant.Traveling openlyand slowlyalong the main roads, we stopped at every croft and village and hamlet we came to.There he would make a quick survey of the local populace, round up anyone suffering from illness or injury, and bring them to me for treatment.Physicians being few and far between in these parts, there was always someone ailing to attend to.While I was occupied with my tonics and salves, he would chat idly with the friends and relatives of the afflicted, taking care to describe the path of our journey toward Beauly.If by chance there were no patients to be seen in a place, we would pause nonetheless for the night, seeking shelter at a cottage or tavern.In these places, Murtagh would sing to entertain our hosts and earn our supper, stubbornly insisting that I preserve all the money I had with me, in case it should be needed when we found Jamie.Not naturally inclined toward conversation, he taught me some of his songs, to pass the time as we plodded on from place to place.Yeve a decent voice, he observed, one day, after a moderately successful attempt at The Dowie Dens of Yarrow.Not well trained, but strong and true enough.Try it once more and yell sing it wi me tonight.Theres a wee tavern at Limraigh.Do you really think this will work?I asked.What were doing, I mean?He shifted about in the saddle before answering.No natural horseman, he always looked like a monkey trained to ride a horse, but still managed to dismount fresh as a daisy at days end, while I could barely manage to hobble my horse before staggering off to collapse.Oh, aye, he said, at last.Sooner or later.Youre seein more sick folk these days, no?This was true, and I admitted as much.Well, then, he said, proving his point, that means word o your skill is spreading.And thats what we want.But we could maybe do better.Thats why youll sing tonight.And perhaps He hesitated, as though reluctant to suggest something.Perhaps what?Know anything about fortune telling, do ye?he asked warily.I understood the reason for his hesitancy; he had seen the frenzy of the witch hunt at Cranesmuir.I smiled.A bit.You want me to try it?Aye.The more we can offer, the more folk will come to see usand go back to tell others.And word will spread about us, til the lad hears of us.And thats when well find him.Game to try, are ye?I shrugged.If it will help, why not?I made my debut as singer and fortune teller that night at Limraigh, with considerable success.I found that Mrs.Graham had been right in what she had told meit was the faces, not the hands, that gave you the necessary clues.Our fame spread, little by little, until by the next week, people were running out of their cottages to greet us as we rode into a village, and showering us with pennies and small gifts as we rode away.You know, we could really make something of this, I remarked one evening, stowing the nights takings away.Too bad theres no theater anywhere nearwe could do a proper music hall turn: Magical Murtagh and His Glamorous Assistant, Gladys.Murtagh treated this remark with his usual taciturn indifference, but it was true; we really did quite well together.Perhaps it was because we were united in our quest, despite our very basic personality differences.The weather grew increasingly bad, and our pace even slower, but there was as yet no word from Jamie.Outside Belladrum one night, in a driving rain, we met with a band of real Gypsies.I blinked disbelievingly at the tiny cluster of painted caravans in the clearing near the road.It looked exactly like a camp of the Gypsy bands that came to Hampstead Down every year.The people looked the same, too; swarthy, cheerful, loud, and welcoming.Hearing the jingle of our harness, a womans head poked out of the window of one caravan.She looked us over for a moment, then gave a shout, and the ground under the trees was suddenly alive with grinning brown faces.Gie me your purse for safekeeping, said Murtagh, unsmiling, watching the young man swaggering toward us with a gay disregard of the rain soaking his colorful shirt.And dinna turn your back on anyone.I was cautious, but we were welcomed with expansive motions, and invited to share the Gypsies dinner.It smelt delicioussome sort of stewand I eagerly accepted the invitation, ignoring Murtaghs dour speculations as to the basic nature of the beast that had provided the stewmeat.They spoke little English, and less Gaelic; we conversed largely in gestures, and a sort of bastard tongue that owed its parentage largely to French.It was warm and companionable in the caravan where we ate; men and women and children all ate casually from bowls, sitting wherever they could find space, dipping the succulent stew up with chunks of bread.It was the best food I had had in weeks, and I ate until my sides creaked.I could barely muster breath to sing, but did my best, humming along in the difficult spots, and leaving Murtagh to carry the tunes.Our performance was greeted with rapturous applause, and the Gypsies reciprocated, a young man singing some sort of wailing lament to the accompaniment of an ancient fiddle.His performance was punctuated by the crashing of a tambourine, wielded with some gravity by a little girl of about eight.While Murtagh had been circumspect in his inquiries in the villages and crofts we visited, with the Gypsies he was entirely open.To my surprise, he told them bluntly who we sought; a big man, with hair like fire, and eyes like the summer skies.The Gypsies exchanged glances up and down the aisle of the caravan, but there was a unanimous shaking of regretful heads.No, they had not seen him.Butand here the leader, the purple shirted young man who had welcomed us, pantomimed the sending of a messenger, should they happen across the man we sought.I bowed, smiling, and Murtagh in turn pantomimed the handing across of money for information received.This bit of business was greeted with smiles, but also with gazes of speculation.I was glad when Murtagh declared that we could not stay the night, but must be on our way, thank ye just the same.He shook out a few coins from his sporran, taking care to exhibit the fact that it held only a small handful of coppers.Distributing these by way of thanks for the supper, we made our exit, followed by voluble protestations of farewell, gratitude, and good wishesat least thats what I assumed they were.They might actually have been promising to follow us and cut our throats, and Murtagh behaved rather as though this had been the case, leading the horses at a gallop to the crossroads two miles distant, then ducking aside into the vegetation for a substantial detour before reemerging onto the road again.Murtagh glanced up and down the road, empty in the fading, rain soaked dusk.Do you really think they followed us?I asked curiously.I dinna ken, but since theres twelve o them, and no but the twa o us, I thought wed best act as though they did.This seemed sound reasoning, and I followed him without question through several more evasive maneuvers, arriving at last in Rossmoor, where we found shelter in a barn.Snow fell the next day.Only a light fall, enough to dust the ground with a white like the flour on the millhouse floor, but it worried me.I didnt like to think of Jamie, alone and unsheltered in the heather, braving winters storms in nothing but the shirt and plaid he had been wearing at his capture by the Watch.Two days later, the messenger came.* * *    The sun was still above the horizon, but it was evening already in the rockwalled glens.The shadows lay so deep under the leafless trees that the pathwhat there was of onewas nearly invisible.Fearful of losing the messenger in the gathering dark, I walked so closely behind him that once or twice I actually trod on the trailing hem of his cloak.At last, with an impatient grunt, he turned and thrust me ahead of him, steering me through the dusk with a heavy hand on my shoulder.It felt as though we had been walking for a long time.I had long since lost track of our turnings amid the towering boulders and thick dead undergrowth.I could only hope that Murtagh was somewhere behind, keeping within earshot if not within sight.The man who had come to the tavern to fetch me, a middle aged Gypsy with no English, had flatly refused to have anyone but me accompany him, pointing emphatically first at Murtagh and then the ground, to indicate that he must stay put.The night chill came on fast at this time of year, and my heavy cloak was barely enough protection against the sudden gusts of icy wind that met us in the open spaces of the clearings.I was torn between dismay at the thought of Jamie lying through the cold, wet nights of autumn without shelter, and excitement at the thought of seeing him again.A shiver ran up my spine that had nothing to do with the cold.At last my guide pulled me to a halt, and with a precautionary squeeze of my shoulder, stepped off the path and disappeared.I stood, as patiently as could be managed, hands folded under my arms for warmth.I was sure my guideor someonewould return; I hadnt paid him, for one thing.Still, the wind rattled through the dead brambles like the passing of a deers ghost, still in panic stricken flight from the hunter.And the damp was seeping through the seams of my boots; the otter fat waterproofing had worn away, and Id had no chance to reapply it.My guide reappeared as suddenly as he had left, making me bite my tongue as I stifled a squeak of surprise.With a jerk of his head, he bade me follow him, and pressed aside a screen of dead alders for me to pass.The cave entrance was narrow.There was a lantern burning on a ledge, silhouetting the tall figure that turned toward the entrance to meet me.I flung myself forward, realizing even before I touched him that it was not Jamie.Disappointment struck me like a blow in the stomach, and I had to step back and swallow several times to choke back the heavy bile that rose in my throat.I clenched my hands at my sides, digging my fists into my thighs until I felt calm enough to speak.Rather out of your territory, arent you?I said, in a voice that surprised me by its coolness.Dougal MacKenzie had watched my struggle for control, not without some sympathy on his dark face.Now he took my elbow and led me farther into the cave.There were a number of bundles piled against the far side, many more than a single horse could carry.He wasnt alone, then.And whatever he and his men carried, it was something he preferred not to expose to the curious gaze of innkeepers and hostlers.Smuggling, I suppose?I said, with a nod toward the bundle.Then I thought better and answered my own question.No, not exactly smugglinggoods for Prince Charles, hm?He didnt bother to answer me, but sat down on a boulder opposite me, hands on his knees.Ive news, he said abruptly.I took a deep breath, bracing myself.News, and not good news, from the expression on his face.I took another breath, swallowed hard, and nodded.Tell me.Hes alive, he said, and the largest of the ice lumps in my stomach dissolved.Dougal cocked his head to one side, watching intently.To see whether I were going to faint?I wondered dimly.It didnt matter; I wasnt.He was taken near Kiltorlity, two weeks ago, Dougal said, still watching me.Not his fault; poor luck.He met six dragoons face to face round a turn in the path, and one recognized him.Was he hurt?My voice was still calm, but my hands were beginning to shake.I pressed them flat against my legs to still them.Dougal shook his head.Not as I heard.He paused a moment.Hes in Wentworth Prison, he said reluctantly.Wentworth, I repeated mechanically.Wentworth Prison.Originally one of the mighty Border fortresses, it had been built sometime in the late sixteenth century, and added to at intervals over the next hundred and fifty years.The sprawling pile of rock now covered nearly two acres of ground, sealed behind three foot walls of weathered granite.But even granite walls have gates, I thought.I looked up to ask a question, and saw the reluctance still stamped on Dougals features.What else?I demanded.The hazel eyes met mine, unflinching.He stood his trial three days ago, Dougal said.And was condemned to hang.The ice lump was back, with company.I closed my eyes.How long?I asked.My voice seemed rather far off to my own ears and I opened my eyes again, blinking to refocus them in the flickering lantern light.Dougal was shaking his head.I dinna ken.Not long, though.My breath was coming a little easier now, and I was able to unclench my fists.Wed better hurry, then, I said, still calmly.How many men are with you?Instead of answering, Dougal rose and came over to me.Reaching down, he took my hands and pulled me to my feet.The look of sympathy was back, and a deep grief lurking in his eyes frightened me more than anything hed said so far.He shook his head slowly.Nay, lass, he said gently.Theres nothing we can do.Panicked, I tore my hands away from him.There is!I said.There must be!You said he was still alive!And I said Not long!he retorted sharply.The lads in Wentworth Prison, not the thieves hole at Cranesmuir!They may hang him today, or tomorrow, or not til next week, for all I know o the matter, but there is no way on earth that ten men can force a way into Wentworth Prison!Oh, no?I was trembling again, but with rage this time.You dont know thatyou dont know what might be done!Youre just not willing to risk your skin, or your miserableprofit!I flung an arm accusingly at the piled bundles.Dougal grappled with me, seizing my flailing arms.I hammered his chest in a frenzy of grief and rage.He ignored the blows and put his arms around me, pulling me tight against him and holding me until I ceased struggling.Claire.It was the first time he had ever used my first name, and it frightened me still further.Claire, he said again, loosening his grip so that I could look up at him, do ye not think Id do all I could to free the lad, did I think there was the slightest chance?Damn it, hes my own foster son!But there is no chancenone!He shook me slightly, to emphasize his words.Jamie wouldna have me throw away good mens lives in a vain venture.Ye know that as well as I do.I could keep back the tears no longer.They burned down my icy cheeks as I pushed against him, seeking to free myself.He held me tighter, though, trying to force my head against his shoulder.Claire, my dear, he said, voice gentler.My hearts sore for the ladand for you.Dye come away wi me.Ill take ye safe.To my own house, he added hastily, feeling me stiffen.Not to Leoch.To your house?I said slowly.A horrible suspicion was beginning to form in my mind.Aye, he said.Ye dinna think Id take ye back to Cranesmuir, surely?He smiled briefly before the stern features relaxed back into seriousness.Nay.Ill take ye to Beannachd.Youll be safe there.Safe?I said, or helpless?His arms dropped away at the tone of my voice.What dye mean?The pleasant voice was suddenly cold.I felt rather cold myself, and pulled my cloak together as I moved away from him.You kept Jamie away from his home by telling him his sister had borne a child to Randall, I said, so that you and that precious brother of yours would have a chance to lure him into your camp.But now the English have him, youve lost any chance of controlling the property through Jamie.I backed up another step, swallowing.You were party to your sisters marriage contract.It was by your insistenceyours and Columsthat Broch Tuarach might be held by a woman.You think that if Jamie dies, Broch Tuarach will belong to meor to you, if you can seduce or force me into marrying you.What?!His voice was incredulous.Ye thinkye think this is all some plot?Saint Agnes!Do ye think Im lying to ye?I shook my head, keeping my distance.I didnt trust him an inch.No, I believe you.If Jamie werent in prison, youd never dare to tell me he was.Its too easy to check that.Nor do I think you betrayed him to the Englishnot even you could do something like that to your own blood.Besides, if you had, and word of it ever reached your men, theyd turn on you in a second.Theyd tolerate a lot in you, but not treachery against your own kinsman.As I spoke I was reminded of something.Was it you who attacked Jamie near the Border last year?The heavy brows rose with surprise.Me?No!I found the lad near death, and saved him!Does that sound as though I meant him harm?Under cover of my cloak, I ran my hand down my thigh, feeling for the comforting bulk of my dagger.If it wasnt you, who was it?I dinna ken.The handsome face was wary, but not hiding anything.Twas one of three menbroken men, outlawsthat hunted wi Jamie then.All of them accused each other, and there was no way of findin out the truth o the matter, not then.He shrugged, the traveling cloak falling back from one broad shoulder.It doesna matter much now; twa of the men are dead, and the third in prison.Over another matter, but it makes little difference, do ye think?No, I dont suppose so.It was in a way a relief to find that he wasnt a murderer, whatever else he might be.He had no reason to lie to me now; so far as he knew, I was completely helpless.Alone, he could compel me to do whatever he wished.Or at least he likely thought so.I took a grip on the handle of my dirk.The light was poor in the cave, but I was watching carefully, and I could see indecision flicker momentarily across his face as he chose his next move.He stepped toward me, hand out, but stopped when he saw me flinch away.Claire.My sweet Claire.The voice was soft now, and he ran an insinuating hand lightly down my arm.So he had decided to try seduction rather than compulsion.I know why ye talk so cold to me, and why ye think ill of me.You know that I burn for ye, Claire.And its trueIve wanted ye since the night of the Gathering, when I kissed your sweet lips.He had two fingers resting lightly on my shoulder, inching toward my neck.If Id been a free man when Randall threatened ye, Id ha wed ye myself on the spot, and sent the man to the devil for ye.He was moving his body gradually closer, crowding me against the stone wall of the cavern.His fingertips moved to my throat, tracing the line of my cloak fastening.He must have seen my face then, for he stopped his advance, though he left his hand where it was, resting lightly above the rapid pulse that beat in my throat.Even so, he said, even feeling as I dofor Ill hide it from ye no longereven so, ye couldna imagine Id abandon Jamie if there were any hope of saving him?Jamie Fraser is the closest thing Ive got to a son!Not quite, I said.Theres your real son.Or perhaps two, by now?The fingers on my throat increased their pressure, just for a second, then dropped away.What dye mean?And this time all pretense, all games, were dispensed with.The hazel eyes were intent and the full lips a grim line in the russet beard.He was very large, and very close to me.But I had gone too far already for caution.It means I know who Hamishs father really is, I said.He had been half expecting it, and had his face well under control, but the last month spent telling fortunes had not been in vain.I saw the tiny flicker of shock that widened his eyes and the sudden panic, swiftly quelled, that tightened the corners of his mouth.Bulls eye.In spite of the danger, I knew a moments fierce exultation.I had been right, then, and the knowledge might just possibly be the weapon I needed.Do ye, then?he said softly.Yes, I said, and I imagine Colum knows as well.That stopped him for a moment.The hazel eyes narrowed, and I wondered for an instant whether he was armed.He thought it was Jamie for a time, I think, I said, staring directly into his eyes.Because of the rumors.You must have started those, feeding them to Geillis Duncan.Why?Because Colum got suspicious of Jamie and started to question Letitia?She couldnt hold out for long against him.Or was it that Geilie thought you were Letitias lover, and you told her it was Jamie to quiet her suspicions?Shes a jealous woman, but she cant have any reason to protect you now.Dougal smiled cruelly.The ice never left his eyes.No, she cant, he agreed, still speaking softly.The witch is dead.Dead!The shock must have shown as plainly on my face as in my voice.His smile broadened.Oh, aye, he said.Burnt.Stuck feet first in a barrel of pitch and heaped about with dry peats.Bound to a stake and lit like a torch.Sent to the devil in a pillar of flame, under the branches of a rowan tree.I thought at first this merciless recitation of detail was meant to impress me, but I was wrong.I shifted to one side, and as the light shone fresh on his face, I could see the lines of grief etched around his eyes.It wasnt a catalog of horror, then, but a lashing of himself.I felt no pity for him, under the circumstances.So you were fond of her, I said coldly.Much good it did her.Or the child.What did you do with that?He shrugged.Saw it placed in a good home.A son, and a healthy babe, for all its mother was a witch and an adulteress.And its father an adulterer and a betrayer, I snapped.Your wife, your mistress, your nephew, your brotheris there anyone you havent betrayed and deceived?Youyou I choked on the words, quite sick with loathing.I dont know why Im surprised, I said, trying to speak calmly.If youve no loyalty to your king, I suppose theres no reason to think youd feel it for your nephew or your brother, either.His head snapped round and he glared at me.He raised his thick dark brows, the same shape as Colums, as Jamies, as Hamishs.The deepset eyes, the broad cheekbones, the beautifully shaped skull.Old Jacob MacKenzies legacy was a strong one.A big hand clamped hard on my shoulder.My brother?You think Id betray my brother?For some reason, that had stung him; his face was dark with anger.Youve just admitted that you did!And then I realized.The both of you, I said slowly.You did it together, you and Colum.Together, as youve always done things.I pulled his hand off my shoulder and flung it back at him.Colum couldnt be chieftain, unless you would go to war for him.He couldnt hold the clan together, without you to travel for him, to collect the rents and settle the claims.He couldnt ride, he couldnt travel.And he couldnt father a son, to pass the chieftainship on to.And you had no son by Maura.You swore to be his arms and legsI was beginning to feel a little hysterical by this timewhy shouldnt you be his cock, as well?Dougal had lost his anger; he stood watching me speculatively for a moment.Deciding that I was going nowhere, he sat down on one of the bales of goods and waited for me to finish.So you did it with Colums knowledge.Was Letitia willing?Knowing by now just what sort of ruthlessness they possessed, I wouldnt put it past the brothers MacKenzie to have forced her.Dougal nodded.His anger had evaporated.Oh, aye, willing enough.She didna fancy me particularly, but she wanted a childenough to take me to her bed for the three months it took to start Hamish.A boring damn job it was too, Dougal added reflectively, scraping a bit of mud from his boot heel.Id as soon swive a warm bowl of milk pudding.And did you tell Colum that?I asked.Hearing the edge in my voice, he looked up.He regarded me levelly for a moment, then a faint smile lightened his face.No, he said quietly.No, I didna tell him that.He looked down at his hands, turning them over as though looking for some secret hidden in the lines of his palms.I told him, he said softly, not looking at me, that she was tender and sweet as a ripe peach, and all that a man could want in a woman.He closed his hands abruptly and looked up at me, that momentary glimpse of Colums brother submerged once more in the sardonic eyes of Dougal MacKenzie.Tender and sweet is not precisely what Id say of you, he observed.But all that a man could want The deepset hazel eyes traveled slowly downward over my body, lingering on the roundness of breast and hip that showed through my open cloak.One hand moved unconsciously back and forth, stroking lightly across the muscles of his thigh as he watched me.Who knows?he said, as though to himself.I might have yet another sonlegitimate, this time.Truehe tilted his head appraisingly, looking at my midsectionit hasna happened yet wi Jamie.You may be barren.But Ill take the chance.The property is worth it, at any rate.He stood suddenly and took a step toward me.Who knows?he said again, very softly.If I were to plow that pretty brown haired furrow and seed it deep each day The shadows on the cavern wall shifted suddenly as he took another step toward me.Well, you took your bloody time about it, I said crossly.A look of incredulous shock spread across his features before he realized that I was looking beyond him, toward the cave mouth.It didna seem mannerly to interrupt, said Murtagh, advancing into the cave behind a loaded pair of flintlock pistols.He held one trained on Dougal, using the other to gesture with.Unless ye mean to accept that last proposal here and now, Id suggest ye leave.And if ye do mean to accept it, then Ill leave.Nobodys leaving yet, I said shortly.Sit down, I said to Dougal.He was still standing, staring at Murtagh as though at an apparition.Wheres Rupert?he demanded, finding his voice.Oh, Rupert.Murtagh scratched his chin thoughtfully with the muzzle of one pistol.Hes likely made it to Belladrum by now.Should be back before dawn, he added helpfully, wi the keg of rum he thinks ye sent him to fetch.The rest o your men are still asleep in Quinbrough.Dougal had the grace to laugh, if a little grudgingly.He sat down again, hands on his knees, and glanced from me to Murtagh and back again.There was a momentary silence.Well?Dougal inquired.Now what?That, I realized, was rather a good question.Surprised at finding Dougal instead of Jamie, shocked by his revelations, and infuriated at his consequent proposals, I had had no time to think of what ought to be done.Luckily, Murtagh was better prepared.Well, after all, he hadnt been occupied in fighting off lecherous advances.Well need money, he said promptly.And men.He cast an eye appraisingly over the bundles stacked against the wall.Nay, he said thoughtfully.Thatll be for King James.But well take what yeve got on your person.The small black eyes swiveled back to Dougal and the muzzle of one pistol gestured gently in the vicinity of his sporran.One thing to be said for life in the Highlands was that it apparently gave one a certain fatalistic attitude.With a sigh, Dougal reached into the sporran and tossed a small purse at my feet.Twenty gold pieces and thirty odd shillings, he said, lifting one brow in my direction.Take it and welcome.Seeing my look of skepticism, he shook his head.Nay, I mean it.Think what ye like of me.Jamies my sisters son, and if ye can free him, then God be wi ye.But ye cant.His tone was final.He looked at Murtagh, still holding his pistols steady.As to the men, no.If you and the lass mean to commit suicide, I canna stop ye.Ill even offer to bury ye, one on either side of Jamie.But youll not take my men to hell with ye, pistols or no.He crossed his arms and leaned back against the cavern wall, calmly watching us.Murtaghs hands didnt waver from his aim.His eyes flickered toward me, though.Did I wish him to shoot?Ill make you a bargain, I said.Dougal raised one brow.Youre in a bit better position to bargain than I am at present, he said.Whats your offer?Let me talk to your men, I said.And if theyll come with me of their own accord, then let them.If not, well go as we cameand well hand back your purse, as well.One side of his mouth came up in a lopsided smile.He looked me over carefully, as though assessing my persuasiveness and my skills as an orator.Then he sat back, hands on his knees.He nodded once.Done, he said.* * *    In the event, we left the glen of the cave with Dougals purse and five men, in addition to Murtagh and myself: Rupert, John Whitlow, Willie MacMurtry, and the twin brothers, Rufus and Geordie Coulter.It was Ruperts decision that swayed the others; I could still seewith a feeling of grim satisfactionthe look on Dougals face when his squat, black bearded lieutenant eyed me speculatively, then patted the dags at his belt and said, Aye, lass, why not?Wentworth Prison was thirty five miles away.A half hours ride in a fast car over good roads.Two days hard slog over half frozen mud by horseback.Not long.Dougals words echoed in my ears, and kept me in my saddle long past the point where I might have dropped from fatigue.My body was pushed to its limits to keep to the saddle through the long weary miles, but my mind was free to worry.To keep it from thoughts of Jamie, I spent the time remembering my interview in the cave with Dougal.And the last thing he had said to me.Standing outside the small cave, waiting as Rupert and his companions brought their horses down from a hiding place higher up the glen, Dougal had turned to me abruptly.Ive a message for ye, he had said.From the witch.From Geilie?To say I was startled was the least of it.I couldnt make out his face in the dark, but I saw his head tilt in affirmation.I saw her the once, he said softly, when I came to take the child.Under other circumstances, I might have felt some sympathy for him, parting for the last time from his mistress, who was condemned to the stake, holding the child they had made together, a son whom he could never acknowledge.As it was, my voice was icy.What did she say?He paused; I wasnt sure if it was merely the disinclination to reveal information, or if he was trying to make sure of his words.Apparently it was the latter, for he spoke carefully.She said if ever I saw you again, I was to tell you two things, just as she told them to me.The first was, I think it is possible, but I do not know.And the secondthe second was just numbers.She made me say them over, to be sure I had them right, for I was to tell them to you in a certain order.The numbers were one, nine, six, and seven.The tall figure turned toward me in the dark, inquiring.Mean anything to ye?No, I said, and turned away to my horse.But it did, of course, mean something to me.I think it is possible.There was only one thing she could mean by that.She thought, though she did not know, that it was possible to go back, through the circle of stone, to my proper place.Clearly she hadnt tried it herself, but had chosento her costto stay.Likely she had had her own reasons.Dougal, perhaps?As for the numbers, I thought I knew what those meant, too.She had told them to him separately, for the sake of a secrecy which must have gone bone deep in her by that time, but they were all part of one number, really.One, nine, six, seven.Nineteen sixty seven.The year of her disappearance into the past.I felt a small thrill of curiosity, and deep regret.What a pity that I had not seen the vaccination mark on her arm until it was too late!And yet, had I seen it sooner, would I have gone back to the circle of stone, perhaps with her help, and left Jamie?Jamie.The thought of him was a leaden weight in my mind, a pendulum swinging slowly at the end of a rope.Not long.The road stretched endless and dreary before us, sometimes petering out altogether into frozen marshes or open sheets of water that had once been meadows and moors.In a freezing drizzle that would soon turn to snow, we reached our goal near evening of the second day.The building loomed up black against the overcast sky.Built in the shape of a gigantic cube, four hundred feet on a side, with a tower on each corner, it could house three hundred prisoners, plus the forty soldiers of the garrison and their commander, the civilian governor and his staff, and the four dozen cooks, orderlies, grooms, and other menials necessary for the running of the establishment.Wentworth Prison.I looked up at the menacing walls of greenish Argyll granite, two feet thick at the base.Tiny windows pierced the walls here and there.A few were beginning to wink with light.Others, serving what I assumed were the prisoners cells, stayed dark.I swallowed.Seeing the massive edifice, with its impenetrable walls, its monumental gate, and its red coated guards, I began to have doubts.What ifmy mouth was dry and I had to stop and lick my lipswhat if we cant do it?Murtaghs expression was the same as always: grim mouthed and dour, narrow chin receding into the grimy neck of his shirt.It didnt alter as he turned to me.Then Dougal will bury us wi him, one on either side, he answered.Come on, theres work to be done.PART SEVEN      Sanctuary      35    WENTWORTH PRISON    Sir Fletcher Gordon was a short and portly man, whose striped silk waistcoat fitted him like a second skin.Slope shouldered and paunch bellied, he looked rather like a large ham seated in the governors wheel backed chair.The bald head and rich pinkish color of his complexion did little to dispel this impression, though few hams boasted such bright blue eyes.He turned over the sheaf of papers on his desk with a slow, deliberate forefinger.Yes, here it is, he said, after an interminable pause to read a page.Fraser, James.Convicted of murder.Sentenced to hang.Now, wheres the Warrant of Execution?He paused again, shuffling nearsightedly through the papers.I dug my fingers deep into the satin of my reticule, willing my face to remain expressionless.Oh, yes.Date of execution, December 23.Yes, we still have him.I swallowed, relaxing my hold on my bag, torn between exultation and panic.He was still alive, then.For another two days.And he was nearby, somewhere in the same building with me.The knowledge surged through my veins with a rush of adrenaline and my hands trembled.I sat forward in the visitors chair, trying to look winsomely appealing.May I see him, Sir Fletcher?Just for a moment, in case hehe might wish me to convey a message to his family?In the guise of an English friend of the Fraser family, I had found it reasonably easy to gain admittance to Wentworth, and to the office of Sir Fletcher, civilian governor of the prison.It was dangerous to ask to see Jamie; not knowing my cover story, he might well give me away if he saw me suddenly without warning.For that matter, I might give myself away; I was not at all sure that I could maintain my precarious self control if I saw him.But the next step was clearly to find out where he was; in this huge stone rabbit warren, the chances of finding him without direction were almost nil.Sir Fletcher frowned, considering.Plainly he considered this request from a mere family acquaintance a nuisance, but he was not an unfeeling man.Finally he shook his head reluctantly.No, my dear.No, Im afraid I really cannot allow that.We are rather crowded at present, and havent sufficient facilities to permit private interviews.And the man is presently inhe consulted his pile of papers againin one of the large cells in the west block, with several other condemned felons.It would be extremely perilous for you to visit him thereor at all.The man is a dangerous prisoner, you understand; I see here that we have been keeping him in chains since his arrival.I gripped my bag again; this time to keep from striking him.He shook his head again, plump chest rising and falling with his labored breathing.No, if you were an immediate member of his family, perhaps He looked up, blinking.I clamped my jaw tightly, determined to give nothing away.Surely a slight show of agitation was reasonable, under the circumstances.But perhaps, my dear He seemed struck by sudden inspiration.He got ponderously to his feet and went to an inner door, where a uniformed soldier stood on guard.He murmured to the man, who nodded once and vanished.Sir Fletcher came back to his desk, pausing on the way to retrieve a decanter and glasses from the top of a cabinet.I accepted his offer of claret; I needed it.We were both halfway through the second glass by the time the guard returned.He marched in without invitation, placed a wooden box on the desk at Sir Fletchers elbow, and turned to march out again.I caught his eye lingering on me and modestly lowered my own gaze.I was wearing a gown borrowed from a lady of Ruperts acquaintance in the nearby town, and from the scent that saturated the dress and its matching reticule, I had a reasonably good idea just what this particular ladys profession was.I hoped the guard didnt recognize the gown.Draining his cup, Sir Fletcher set it down and pulled the box toward him.It was a plain, square box of unfinished wood, with a sliding lid.There were letters chalked on the lid.I could read them, even upside down.FRAYSER, they read.Sir Fletcher slid back the lid, peered inside for a moment, then closed the box and pushed it toward me.The prisoners personal effects, he explained.Customarily, we send them to whomever the prisoner designates as next of kin, after execution.This man, thoughhe shook his headhas refused altogether to say anything about his family.Some estrangement, no doubt.Not unusual, of course, but regrettable under the circumstances.I hesitate to make the request, Mrs.Beauchamp, but I thought that perhaps, since you are acquainted with the family, you would consider taking it upon yourself to convey his effects to the appropriate person?I didnt trust myself to speak, but nodded and buried my nose in my cup of claret.Sir Fletcher seemed relieved, whether at disposing of the box, or at the thought of my imminent departure.He sat back, wheezing slightly, and smiled expansively at me.That is very kind of you, Mrs.Beauchamp.I know such a thing cannot but be a painful duty to a young woman of feeling, and I am most sensible of your kindness in undertaking it, I do assure you.N not at all, I stammered.I managed to stand up, and to gather up the box.It measured about eight inches by six, and was four or five inches deep.A small, light box, to hold the remains of a mans life.I knew the things it held.Three fishing lines, neatly coiled; a cork stuck with fishhooks; a flint and steel; a small piece of broken glass, edges blunt with wear; various small stones that looked interesting or had a good feel between the fingers; a dried moles foot, carried as a charm against rheumatism.A Bibleor perhaps they had let him keep that?I hoped so.A ruby ring, if it hadnt been stolen.And a small wooden snake, carved of cherry wood, with the name SAWNY scratched on its underside.I paused at the door, gripping the frame with my fingers to steady myself.Sir Fletcher, following courteously to see me out, was at my side in a moment.Mrs.Beauchamp!Are you feeling faint, my dear?Guard, a chair!I could feel the prickles of a cold sweat breaking out along the sides of my face, but I managed to smile and wave away the proffered chair.I wanted more than anything to get out of thereI needed fresh air, in large quantities.And I needed to be alone to cry.No, Im quite all right, I said, trying to sound convincing.Its onlya bit close in here, perhaps.No, I shall be perfectly all right.My groom is waiting outside, in any case.Forcing myself to stand up straight and smile, I had a thought.It might not help, but it couldnt hurt.Oh, Sir Fletcher  Still worried by my appearance, he was all gallantry and attention.Yes, my dear?It occurred to me.How sad for a young man in this situation to be estranged from his family.I thought perhapsif he wished to write to thema letter of reconciliation, perhaps?I would be pleased to deliver it toto his mother.You are thoughtfulness itself, my dear.Sir Fletcher was jovial, now that it seemed I was not going to collapse on his carpet after all.Of course.I will inquire.Where are you staying, my dear?If there is a letter, I shall have it sent to you.Well, I was doing better with the smile, though it felt pasted on my face.That is rather uncertain at the moment.I have several relatives and close acquaintances in the town, with whom I fear I shall be obliged to stay in turn, in order to avoid offending anyone, you see.I managed a small laugh.So if it does not disturb you too much, perhaps my groom could call to inquire for the letter?Of course, of course.That will do excellently, my dear.Excellently!And with a quick glance back at his decanter, he took my arm to escort me to the gate.* * *    Better, lassie?Rupert pushed back the curtain of my hair to peer at my face.Ye look like an ill cured pork belly.Here, better have a bit more.I shook my head at the proffered whisky flask and sat up, wiping the damp rag he had brought across my face.No, Im all right now.Escorted by Murtagh, who was disguised as my groom, I had barely made it out of sight of the prison before sliding off my horse and being sick in the snow.There I remained, weeping, with Jamies box clutched to my bosom, until Murtagh had gathered me up bodily, forced me to mount, and led me to the small inn in Wentworth town where Rupert had found lodgings.We were in an upper room, from which the bulk of the prison was barely visible in the gathering dusk.Is the lad dead then?Ruperts broad face, half obscured by his beard, was grave and kind, lacking any of its usual clowning.I shook my head and took a deep breath.Not yet.After hearing my story, Rupert paced slowly around the room, pushing his lips in and out as he thought.Murtagh sat still, as usual, no sign of agitation on his features.He would have made a wonderful poker player, I thought.Rupert returned, sinking down on the bed beside me with a sigh.Weel, hes alive still, and thats the most important thing.Damned if I see what to do next, though.Weve no way to get into the place.Aye, we have, Murtagh said, suddenly.Thanks to the wee lassies thought about the letter.Mmmphm.One man, though.And only so far as the governors office.But aye, its a start.Rupert drew his dirk and idly scratched his thick beard with the point.Its a damn big place to search.I know where he is, I said, feeling better with the planning, and the knowledge that my companions werent giving up, no matter how hopeless our enterprise seemed.At least I know which wing hes in.Do ye, then?Hmm.He replaced the dirk and resumed his pacing, stopping to demand, How much money have ye, lass?I fumbled in the pocket of my gown.I had Dougals purse, the money Jenny had forced me to take, and my string of pearls.Rupert rejected the pearls, but took the purse, pouring a stream of coins into the palm of one capacious hand.Thatll do, he said, jingling them experimentally.He cocked an eye at the Coulter twins.You twa laddies and Williecome wi me.John and Murtagh can stay here wi the lassie.Where are you going?I asked.He poured the coins into his sporran, keeping back one, which he tossed meditatively in the air.Och, he said vaguely.Happen theres another inn, the other side of the town.The guards from the prison go there when theyre off duty, for its closer, and the drinks a penny cheaper.He flipped the coin with his thumb, and turning his hand, caught it between two knuckles.I watched it, with a growing idea of what he intended.Is that so?I said.I wouldnt suppose they play cards there, too, would you?I wouldna ken, lassie, wouldna ken, he answered.He tossed the coin once more and clapped his hands together, trapping it, then spread his hands apart, to show nothing but thin air.He smiled, teeth white in the black beard.But we might go and see, no?He snapped his fingers, and the coin appeared once more between them.* * *    Shortly past one oclock on the following afternoon, I passed again beneath the spiked portcullis that had guarded the gate of Wentworth since its construction in the late sixteenth century.It had lost very little of its forbidding aspect in the succeeding two hundred years, and I touched the dagger in my pocket for courage.Sir Fletcher should now be well dug in at his midday repast, according to the information Rupert and his assistant spies had extracted from the prison guards during their foray the evening before.They had staggered in, red eyed and reeking of ale, just before dawn.All Rupert would say in response to my questions was Och, lassie, all it takes to win is luck.It takes skill to lose!He curled up in the corner then and went soundly to sleep, leaving me to pace the floor in frustration, as I had been doing all night.He woke an hour later, though, clear eyed and clear headed, and laid out the rudiments of the plan I was about to put into execution.Sir Fletcher doesna allow anyone or anything to disturb his meals, he said.Anyone wantin him then must just go on wantin until hes done wi his food and drink.And after the midday meal, its his habit to retire to his quarters for a wee sleep.Murtagh, in the character of my groom, had arrived a quarter of an hour previously, and been admitted without difficulty.Presumably, he would be shown to Sir Fletchers office and asked to wait.While there, he was to search the office, first for a plan of the west wing, and then, on the off chance, for keys that might open the cells.I hung back a bit, glancing at the sky to judge the time.If I arrived before he had sat down, I might be invited to join Sir Fletcher for luncheon, which would be highly inconvenient.But Ruperts card playing acquaintances among the guards had assured him that the governors habits were invariable; the bell for dinner was rung promptly at one, and the soup served five minutes later.The guard on duty at the entrance was the same as the day before.He looked surprised, but greeted me courteously.So vexing, I said, I had meant my groom to bring a small present for Sir Fletcher, as some return for his kindness to me yesterday.But I found that the silly man had ridden off without it, and so I was obliged to follow with it myself, hoping to catch him up.Has he arrived already?I displayed the small package I carried and smiled, thinking that it would help if I had dimples.Since I hadnt, I settled for a brilliant display of teeth.It seemed to be sufficient.I was admitted and led through the corridors of the prison toward the governors office.Though this part of the castle was decently furnished, there was little mistaking the place for anything other than a prison.There was a smell about the place, which I imagined as the smell of misery and fear, though I supposed it was no more than the niff of ancient squalor and an absence of drains.The guard allowed me to precede him down the hall, following discreetly so as not to step on my cloak.And a damn good thing he did, for I rounded the corner toward Sir Fletchers office a few feet ahead of him, just in time to see Murtagh through the open door, dragging the unconscious form of the office guard behind the enormous desk.I took one step back and dropped my package onto the stone floor.There was a shattering of glass, and the air was filled with the smothering aroma of peach brandy.Oh, dear, I said, what have I done?While the guard was calling for a prisoner to clear up the mess, I tactfully murmured something about waiting for Sir Fletcher in his private office, slipped in, and hastily shut the door behind me.What the bloody hell have you done?I snapped at Murtagh.He looked up from his rummaging of the body, unconcerned at my tone.Sir Fletcher doesna keep keys in his office, he informed me in a low voice, but this wee laddie has a set.He pulled the huge ring free of the mans coat, careful to keep the keys from jingling.I dropped to my knees behind him.Oh, good show!I said.I cast an eye over the prostrate soldier; still breathing, at least.What about a plan of the prison?He shook his head.Not that either, but my friend here told me a bit while we waited.The condemned cells are on the same floor as this, in the middle of the west corridor.Therere three cells, though, and I couldna ask more than thathe was a bit suspicious as it was.Its enoughI hope.All right, give me the keys and get out.Me?Its you should leave, lassie, and right smart too.He glanced at the door, but there was no sound on the other side.No, it has to be me, I said, reaching again for the keys.Listen, I said impatiently.If they find you wandering round the prison with a bunch of keys, and the guard here laid out like a mackerel, were both done for, because why didnt I cry out for help?I snatched the keys and crammed them in my pocket, with some difficulty.Murtagh was still skeptical, but had risen to his feet.And if youre caught?he demanded.I swoon, I said crisply.And when I recovereventuallyI say that I saw you apparently murdering the guard and fled in terror, with no idea where I was going.I lost my way looking for help.He nodded slowly.Aye, all right.He moved toward the door, then stopped.But why did Ioh.He crossed swiftly to the desk and pulled out one drawer after another, stirring the contents with one hand and tossing items onto the floor with the other.Theft, he explained, coming back to the door.He opened it a crack, looking out.If its theft, shouldnt you take something?I suggested, looking about for something small and portable.I picked up an enameled snuffbox.This, perhaps?He made an impatient gesture to me to put it down, still peering through the crack.Nay, lass!If Im found wi Sir Fletchers property, thats a hanging offense.Attempted theft is only flogging or mutilation.Oh.I put the snuffbox down hastily and stood behind him, peering over his shoulder.The hall seemed empty.I go first, he said.If I meet anyone, Ill draw em off.Wait to the count of thirty, then follow.Well meet ye in the small wood to the north.He opened the door, then paused and turned back.If youre caught, mind ye throw the keys awa.Before I could speak, he was through the door like an eel and down the corridor, moving silently as a shadow.* * *    It seemed to take an eternity to find the west wing, dodging through the corridors of the old castle, peering around corners and hiding behind columns.I saw only one guard on my way, though, and managed to avoid him by diving back around a corner, pressing myself to the wall with hammering heart until he passed.Once I found the west wing, though, I had little doubt that I was in the right place.There were three large doors in the corridor, each with a tiny barred window from which I could catch no more than a frustrating glimpse of the room behind it.Eenie, meenie, minie, mo, I muttered to myself, and headed for the center cell.The keys on the ring were unlabeled, but of different sizes.Clearly only one of three big ones would fit the lock before me.Naturally, it was the third one.I took a deep breath as the lock clicked, then wiped my sweating hands on my skirt and shoved the door open.I sorted frantically through the stinking mass of men in the cell, stepping over outstretched feet and legs, pushing past heavy bodies that moved with maddening sluggishness out of my way.The stir occasioned by my abrupt entrance had spread; those who had been asleep amid the filth on the floor began to sit up, roused by the rippling murmur of astonishment.Some were manacled to the walls; the chains grated and clanked in the half light as they moved.I grabbed one of the standing men, a brown bearded clansman in ragged yellow and green tartan.The bones of his arm under my hand were frighteningly near the skin; the English wasted little extra food on their prisoners.James Fraser!A big, redheaded man!Is he in this cell?Where is he?He was already moving toward the door with the others who were not chained, but paused a moment to glance down at me.The prisoners by now had seized the idea, and were pouring through the open door in a shuffling flood, peering and murmuring to each other.Who?Fraser?Och, they took him awa this mornin.The man shrugged, and pushed at my hands, trying to shake me off.I took hold of his belt with a grip that halted him in his tracks.Where did they take him?Who took him?I dinna ken where; was yon Captain Randall took ima pinch faced snark, he is.With an impatient wrench, he freed himself and headed for the door with a step born of long nourished purpose.Randall.I stood stunned for a moment, jostled by the escaping men, deaf to the shouts of the chained.Finally I shook myself from my stupor and tried to think.
