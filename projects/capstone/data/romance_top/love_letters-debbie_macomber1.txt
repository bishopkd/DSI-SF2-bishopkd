 If someone had told me, as little as two years ago, that Id own and operate a bed and breakfast in this tiny burg of a town called Cedar Cove, I would have laughed my head off.But then I never expected to be a widow at the age of thirty six, either.If Ive learned anythingand, trust me, life has been filled with several painful lessonsits that the future doesnt come with a printed guarantee.So here I am in ninety five degree heat, stripping beds, scrubbing toilets, and baking cookies.An even greater surprise is that Im loving it.Well, maybe not the toilet scrubbing part, but just about every other aspect of this new life I have carved out for myself.Its been two full years now since I got the news that my husband is dead.And while I never thought it would be possible, there are times when I can smile again, feel again, even laugh.All three are surprises.When I got word that Paul had been killed in a helicopter crash on some unpronounceable mountainside in Afghanistan, it felt as if my entire world had imploded.I needed to hold on to something to keep from spiraling out of control, and that something turned out to be Rose Harbor Inn.Nearly everyone advised against me buying the inn: my family, my friends, my employer.Again and again I heard that this was a drastic change, and I should wait a year.Give it twelve months, I was lectured.Thats the proverbial wisdom, and while I politely listened, I silently went about making my own plans.It was either do something differentall right, drasticor slowly go insane.Has it been easy?Hardly.Eking out a living by renting rooms, doing a good majority of the work myself, hasnt helped build up my investment portfolio.I have yet to see a penny in profit, but Im not going under, either.For the most part Ive invested every cent back into the inn.After I purchased the inn, I changed the name and had a new sign constructed and installed.Id decided to call my new home Rose Harbor Inn.Rose is my surname, Pauls name, and Harbor because I needed to find a protected environment in order to heal.And my sign hung proudly in front of the inn with my name, Jo Marie Rose, etched below.In addition to the new sign, there were certain necessary repairs, some cosmetic and others unavoidable.Thankfully, friends introduced me to Mark Taylor, the local handyman.Mark.What an enigma he was.Ive seen him nearly every day for the past year, sometimes two and three times a day, and I still know hardly anything about him other than his name and address.Okay, so hes a great carpenter and he craves my peanut butter cookies.Not knowing more felt like a pesky bug bite with a constant itch.My imagination ran wild.I wanted to uncover Marks secrets, conjuring up a dozen reasons he refused to talk about himself.Some of those scenarios were outrageous, and there were a few scary ones lurking in the back of my mind as well.Ive been on a mission to pry some small bit of personal information out of him.So far Ive had little to no success.I might as well try chiseling marble with a marshmallow.The man is as tight lipped as they come.The washing machine beeped, indicating that the cycle had ended.The Hendersons, whod recently checked out, had been in town visiting their son, who was stationed at the Bremerton Navy base.Hed recently become engaged to a local woman, and the couple had flown in from Texas to meet their future daughter in law.Lois and Michael were a delightful couple and Id enjoyed hosting them.I had two names on the books for the upcoming weekend.Both would arrive sometime Friday afternoon.After a while, names become a blur in my memory.People come and go, but for whatever reason, I specifically remembered both parties who had booked this weekend.The first was Eleanor Reynolds, and shed sounded quite proper when wed first spoken.Id guesstimated that she was either an accountant or a middle aged librarian.Since that time Id changed my mind.Id spoken to Ellie twiceshe asked that I call her thatsince our original phone call.Once when she canceled and then a third time when she rebooked.The woman couldnt seem to make up her mind.Seeing that I hadnt heard from her in the last few weeks, I had to assume she would keep the reservation and arrive sometime this afternoon.By contrast, Maggie Porter had been a breath of fresh air, chatting and happy.This was a getaway weekend she was planning with her husband, Roy.Right before the Fourth of July, Maggies in laws, who had apparently heard what Maggie was planning, had called and paid for the weekend as an anniversary gift for the young couple.I looked forward to meeting Maggie and her husband.Rover barked, which told me someone was coming up the front walkway.I glanced at my watch, fearing Id let time get away from me.This happened more frequently than I cared to admit.Rover, my rescue dog and constant companion, raced to the door.I recognized Rovers bark, which told me I had nothing to be anxious about.It wasnt a guest arriving early; it was Mark Taylor.Great.Id been hoping it was him.I fully intended to drill him and this time I wasnt going to let him sidetrack me or sidestep my questions.I held the door open for Mark.Hed broken his leg last May and itd healed nicely.I couldnt detect even a trace of a limp.Id been upset with him for how long itd taken him to plant my rose garden.What should have taken only a matter of a few days had stretched into weeks and weeks.As you might have guessed, patience isnt my strong suit.To be fair, his injured leg didnt exactly speed up the process.When the rose garden was in and blooming I was less irritated.Next on my agenda was the gazebo, which I wanted Mark to build.Id given him a photo of exactly what I envisioned, but that had been weeks ago.I longed for that gazebo.In my mind, I pictured Rover sitting with me while I sipped coffee or tea at sunset, watching the sun casting a net of pink and orange shadows across the sky as it slowly went down behind the Olympic Mountain Range.I could get the same view from the deck in the back of the house, but I liked to reserve that spot for my guests.It was a picture of the sunset that graced my brochure.Mark took that photo.Actually, hes quite good at photography, although he brushes away my praise as if receiving a compliment embarrasses him.Mark came into the inn and paused long enough to look down at Rover.He muttered something about the dog being nothing but a worthless mutt.I bit down on my tongue to keep from defending Rover.Mark was like that.Hed make a comment just to get a rise out of me, but I was onto his game and I wasnt falling for it.You got a minute?he asked.Sure.Whats up?He didnt answer me directly.Instead, he went into the breakfast room where I served my guests and placed a rolled up piece of drafting paper on the tabletop.Ive finished the plans for the gazebo.This was a surprise.Id expected it would take another five or six months for him to get around to that.From the first, hed let it be known that he had other jobs that took priority over mine.This was something else he did, I suspected, hoping to irritate me.To my way of thinking, my money was just as good as anyone elses, or so one would think.Despite my best efforts, I had yet to figure out how Mark established his priority system.Not that it mattered.However he calculated it, my projects were generally placed near the bottom.Thats great, I said, and hoped to sound encouraging, but not overly so.I didnt want to be disappointed when it took far longer than I wanted for him to start the project.He unrolled the sheet of paper and anchored it with the salt and pepper shakers on opposite corners.The free corners curled up slightly.I glanced down and immediately liked what I saw.When did you draw this up?I asked.A few weeks ago.And he was only showing it to me now?Do you like it or not?I wasnt the only one who struggled with patience.I do, I assured him, but I have a few questions.Like what?Whats it going to cost me?He rolled his eyes as if Id made an unreasonable request.You want an estimate?Thats generally how it works, I reminded him.He sighed as if insulted.I would have thought by now that youd trust me to be fair.I do trust you, but building a gazebo cant be cheap, and I may need to budget for it.I dont suppose you take payments?He shrugged.Nope.Thats what I thought.As it was, he preferred to be paid in cash.Okay, fine, Ill get you an estimate but if you complain about delays, then you have no one to blame but yourself.Can you give me a general idea?I pressed.To this point, the cost of everything Mark had built for me had been more than reasonable.In response, he took out a small spiral pad he kept in his shirt pocket and riffled through several pages.He studied the sheet, then frowned and closed his eyes as if mentally tallying up the final estimation.When he opened his eyes, he named a figure I could live with.Sounds good, I said, trying to disguise how pleased I was.Its a go?I studied the design once more.It was basically a carbon copy of the picture Id cut out of a magazine and handed him months ago.As far as I could see, it was perfect and would add a great deal of curb appeal to the inn.Its a go.I rubbed my palms together.I was excited now, and I didnt care if Mark knew it.Rover wagged his tail as if he, too, was pleased.Good.He replaced the salt and pepper shakers to the middle of the table, collected the paper, rolled it back up, and secured it with a rubber band.Mark wrinkled his nose.You baked cookies this morning?he asked, and then frowned.In this heat?It was early.I tend to be an early riser, always have been.My friends, before they married and had children, often slept until ten or eleven on weekends.Try as I might, I rarely made it past seven.Eight at the very latest.How early?Four.Mark shook his head and grimaced as if hed unexpectedly tasted something sour.Too early for me.Is it too early for a taste test?It went without saying that he was looking for me to make the offer.I could be persuaded.Ive never known Mark Taylor to turn down a cookie.Not that anyone could tell he had an addiction to sweets.Mark was lanky, at least six three, possibly six four, and thin as a pencil.He seemed perpetually in need of a haircut.He was an attractive man, or he could be if he were inclined to care about his appearance, but clearly he wasnt.Appearances didnt seem to matter much to him.By contrast, I was what Paul had referred to as round in all the right places.I was one of those women whose weight constantly went up and down and then up again.To combat this, I routinely exercised, mostly by taking Rover on long walks.I enjoyed gardening, too.This summer Id taken to growing out my hair, which was dark and bounced against the top of my shoulders.Almost always I secured it at the base of my neck with a hair tie.Mark followed me into the kitchen.Rover led the way.The peanut butter cookies were on the cooling racks.I handed Mark a plate and said, Help yourself, while I poured us each a cup of coffee.We sat down at the table across from each other.I rested my elbows on the tabletop and studied the handyman.Hed downed three cookies before he noticed that I was intently watching him.What?he asked, frowning at me.Cookie crumbs had collected at the corners of his mouth.He had a nice mouth, I mused.Pardon?I asked.Youre staring at me.I shrugged.I was thinking this morning.Did it try your brain?he asked.His meager attempt at humor fell decidedly flat.Very funny.Okay, fine, Ill ask the obvious question.What were you thinking about?You.Me.He reached for his coffee and took a sip.Not the most interesting subject, I can assure you.Quite the contrary.It came to me that weve been friends almost from the time I bought the inn and I know next to nothing about you.Nothing to know.Have you ever been married?His frown darkened.Seems to me youve got better things to occupy your mind.Not really.My guess is youve never had a wife.Remember, Ive been inside your house.Big deal, and as I remember it, you came without an invitation.I was quick to defend myself.I brought you dinner after you broke your leg.I wasnt interested in eating, he argued.Dont change the subject.I refused to let him sidetrack me by starting an argument.There isnt a single personal item on display in your entire house.No pictures, no photographs, nothing.He shook his head as if he didnt know what I was talking about.So I dont have a knack for interior design.Are you suggesting I watch that network you like so much where a woman can take a Coke bottle and a fishing pole and make a dinette set out of it?No, I clarified.Im thinking you might be part of the Witness Protection Program.Mark had taken a drink of his coffee and started to laugh, spitting a mouthful of liquid back into the mug.Im serious, I told him.Then youve got a creative imagination.Fine, youre not under the governments protection.You didnt answer my question.He sighed as if bored with the subject.Which question?He reached for another cookie and stood.Have you ever been married?I asked a bit louder this time.I wanted him to know I was serious and determined to unearth his secrets.Cant imagine why youd want to know something like that.Doesnt really seem like any of your business.I guess that was meant to put me in my place.Just curious, I said.He set the mug in the sink.Dont be.Im not that interesting.See you later.And with that, he walked out the front door.Well, well, isnt he the prickly one, I said to Rover, who cocked his head to one side as if he agreed.Unwilling to let the matter rest, I reached for the phone.Fine, if he wanted to be that way, I would go to plan B.  I punched in the number for my friend Peggy Beldon.Peggy and her husband, Bob, owned the Thyme and Tide, another local bed and breakfast.It was Peggy whod recommended Mark as a handyman.Shed become a friend and was always helpful and informative.Never once had I gotten the impression that she viewed me as competition.In fact, shed often sent her overflow customers in my direction.I was grateful to Peggy for the advice and guidance shed so generously shared with me.Jo Marie, she greeted, and sounded pleased to hear from me.What can I do for you?I have a question, I said, a little embarrassed to be so openly curious about Mark.Sure, anything.I was wondering what you know about Mark Taylor.O k a y.  She dragged out the word as if my asking had taken her by surprise.I wanted to make something clear first, though.Its not because I have any romantic interest in him.I didnt think so, Peggy said.The reason I hesitated is because there isnt much I can tell you.I dont know that much about him.Does anyone?I pried.Mark was the most secretive man Id ever met.I was certain there was a story there, possibly a dark and sinister one.I can ask Bob if you like.Hes gone at the moment but is due back anytime now.I was heading to the bakery in an hour or so.We could meet there and Ill fill you in on what Bob tells me.Perfect.Ill meet you in an hour.One way or another, I was going to unearth Mark Taylors deep, dark secrets.2     Ellie Reynoldss stomach was in knots, twisting and churning as she rode the shuttle bus from Sea Tac Airport into Cedar Cove.She prayed she was doing the right thing by meeting Tom Lynch.Her mothers warnings rang in her ears like cacophonous church bells drowning out her thoughts, until Ellie felt she was about to go deaf.She clenched her hands together as she looked out the bus window.The middle aged woman sitting in the seat across the aisle from her held her knitting in her hands.As if guessing at Ellies unrest, the other woman offered her a reassuring smile.Ellie smiled back and turned her head away to study the landscape.In many ways, the terrain resembled Bend, her home in Oregon.Over the years, Ellie had visited the Seattle area twice before.Once as a Girl Scout in fifth grade, and then again in high school when she was part of a choral group that performed at a Christmas function in the city.Both Ellie and her mother had stuck pretty close to home for the majority of her life.Seattle was the big city.Visiting it had been a grand adventure when she was sixteen.Now, at age twenty three, she felt like a disobedient child whod defied her mothers wishes.Ellie decided she couldnt think about her mother.Instead, she would think about Tom.Right away a warm, happy feeling stole over her.Theyd been communicating for months via Facebook, text messages, phone calls, and emails.Shed never felt this strongly about any man, especially someone she hadnt met in person.They had a great deal in common and had really connected.They both liked fish tacos and stargazing, long walks, and classic novels.In fact, they met through an online book club.Tom was a former submariner who worked in the Navy shipyard in Bremerton.The minute her mother heard that small bit of information, itd thrown her into a tizzy.Sailors were notorious for having a girl in every port; they were men with loose morals, or so her mother claimed.But Ellie refused to believe it about Tom.He was like her, a bit shy and reserved, unless she was nervous.Silly as it seemed, when overly anxious, like now, she could blurt out the most nonsensical information to a stranger that she wouldnt consider sharing with her closest friend.Despite her mothers warnings, Ellie wasnt worried that Tom was using her.Everything she knew about him told her he was kind and thoughtful, intelligent and studious, and not the stereotypical sailor who played on others emotions.She couldnt make herself believe he would do anything to hurt her.She trusted him, and if his photo was anything to go by, he was as open and honest as she believed.She was willing to go by faith and trust her gut feelings.What counted was his heart.They would meet face to face for the first time this weekend.Tom was the one whod suggested she stay at Rose Harbor Inn.Ellie prayed once more that she was doing the right thing.She made the reservation at the inn in May, almost three months ago, and twice since then shed changed her mind.Theyd set the date for August, and Tom had been pleased and excited that they would meet at last.She was, too.Her mistake, she realized, was telling her mother about Tom.The instant Virginia Reynolds heard that Ellie planned to meet this man shed met through Facebook, she had become rattled and unglued, certain Ellie was about to make the worst mistake of her life.After constant badgering from her mother, Ellie had given in and canceled the trip.When shed told Tom shed changed her mind, hed offered to contact her mother and reassure her that his intentions were honorable.Ellie was touched, but thought it ridiculous that at her age she had to justify to her mother what she did and who she met.Eager to prove she was capable of making her own decisions, Ellie rebooked the inn a short while later.Tom stood by his offer.Hed be happy to chat with her mother, answer her questions, and give character references if needed.Ellies cell phone dinged, indicating she had a text message.Hoping it was from Tom, she dug her phone out of her purse and sighed with frustration when she saw it was from her mother.Please let me know youre OK, Virginia Reynolds had written.Landed.Am safe.Ellie quickly typed back.Thank God.You dont know how worried I am.Im fine, Mom.Ellie sighed and returned her cell to her purse, ignoring the next ping, certain it was her mother yet again.The root problem, Ellie realized, was her parents failed marriage.A thousand times through her childhood, Ellie had heard her mother claim that men werent to be trusted.Men would stomp on your heart and then walk away as if it meant nothing.That had been Virginias experience, and she was willing to do whatever was necessary to protect her only child from the same fate.Following her parents divorce, Ellie had become the entire focus of her mothers world.Virginia had dedicated everything to Ellie: Her time, her resources, and her love were all directed toward Ellie.At times she felt her mother was suffocating her.Ellie craved to forge her own path and then instantly felt guilty, knowing she was everything to her mother.Her phone rang, and again, hoping it was Tom, Ellie grabbed it out of her purse.Her mother.Ellie let the call go to voice mail.The woman across the aisle sent her a curious glance, which Ellie ignored.The problem was, Ellie fully understood her mothers concerns.Taking off to meet a man she knew only through phone calls and emails and text messages was risky on any number of levels.The bottom line was her mother was right.Ellie really didnt know Tom Lynch.He could be a serial rapist or a criminal or even a mass murderer.And as her mother said, Ellie could be walking into a nightmare that would haunt her for the rest of her life.Shed begged Ellie to let her travel with her for this initial meeting.For a time, Ellie had actually considered the offer.It didnt take long for her to decide otherwise.This was something she wantedno, neededto do on her own.She was cautious and would meet Tom in a public place.If, after they met, they decided there was something to this relationship, then they would continue getting to know each other.He would come to Oregon next, and introduce himself to her mother.It made sense to Ellie, and while she was somewhat introverted, she wasnt stupid.She had her own apprehensions about this.Even she had to admit her relationship with Tom was unconventional.Shed be the first to concede this wasnt the way a woman generally met a man for the first time.And while she didnt have a lot of dating experience, she trusted her gut and her heart, and both told her that Tom Lynch could be trusted.With her phone still in her hand, Ellie checked her email and saw that Tom had sent her a message, asking her to let him know when she arrived.Her fingers fairly flew across the tiny keyboard as she responded.Although reluctant, she did have to admit that Tom had seemed a tad bit secretive, something her mother had taken delight in pointing out at every opportunity.Ellie hadnt tried to argue; all she told her mother was that she trusted her instincts.Which, in retrospect, probably wasnt the wisest of responses.That declaration had instantly sent her mother into a long tirade against Ellies father.At one time, Virginia, too, had trusted her heart, and look what it had gotten her.Ellie could almost mouth the words along with her mother.Going against her own parents wishes, Virginia had fallen in love with a young man she met while in college.Theyd been crazy about each other.From the first, her mothers parents had had questions about Scott Reynolds.They hadnt liked or trusted him.After only one meeting, her father declared that Scott was too slick, too cocky, and, perhaps worst of all  superficial.Both her parents had warned Virginia against falling in love with a man who was overly confident of himself.They had someone else in mind for their only daughter, someone far more suitable.From the start, they were convinced Scott would break Virginias heart.And they were right.Because she was in love and ruled by hormones, Virginia hadnt listened to her parents.Scott and Virginia had defied her family, and against their advice had continued to date.Love had blinded Virginia from the truth.To complicate matters, Virginia and Scott had eloped.For a short while, Virginia admitted, shed been blissfully happy, especially when she learned she was pregnant with Ellie.Scott dropped out of school and took a job driving a taxi.Hed been thrilled with his baby girl, whom they named Eleanor after Virginias mother, in the hope that her parents would look past Virginias defiance and make Scott a part of the family.Right away Scott had called her Ellie, and the name had stuck.As first time grandparents, Virginias family threw their loving arms around Virginia and Eleanor.They made an effort with Scott, Virginia claimed, but his dislike of her mother and father drove a wedge between them.It wasnt long before Scotts fascination with being a husband and father wore thin.They struggled financially, living on what Scott made driving a cab.Her parents offered them a loan, but Scott wouldnt hear of it.That was when their problems started.Virginia couldnt understand why he insisted they had to make it on their own.They argued often, especially when Virginia started spending a lot of time with her mother at the family home.Scott was often late coming home after work, and when Virginia questioned where he spent all his time, he claimed it shouldnt matter, seeing that she was rarely at the apartment anyway.She seemed to prefer her parents company over his.Then one horrible day Virginias father swore he saw Scott with another woman.When shed confronted him, Scott had insisted this so called other woman was a coworker and a friend, in addition to being thirty years his senior.Virginia refused to believe it.As far as she was concerned, Scott could no longer be trusted.With suspicions running rampant, it wasnt long before the marriage was over.Once Virginia filed for divorce, her parents took her back into the family home, willing to forgive their daughter for being a fool for love.Ellie came with her and had only fleeting memories of her father.And now it seemed history was repeating itself.Ellie had defied her mother over a man, too, a man she had yet to meet.The bus stopped and a middle aged couple that was sitting in the back got out at a community known as Gig Harbor.While the driver unloaded their suitcases, Ellie studied the quaint buildings that butted up against the picturesque waterfront.She didnt know a lot about Cedar Cove, but she hoped it was as charming as this small town.Once the driver was back on the bus, Ellie asked, How much longer until we reach Cedar Cove?We arent far now, he said, twisting around to get a good look at her.I should have you there in less than forty minutes.Ellie offered him a feeble smile.Her stomach knotted again, tighter this time.Even now she had a hard time believing she was actually defying her mother.Just a couple more stops first, the driver added, and, turning around, started the bus once again.A short stop in Purdy and Olalla, and then Cedar Cove.Okay.Do you have someone meeting you at the bus stop?the driver asked, looking at her in his rearview mirror.A family member or a friend?Yes.Well, sort of.As soon as shed told Tom her plans, hed offered to take time off work to pick her up.Ellie had declined.For their first meeting, she wanted to look her best, and she preferred not to do it following a flight and wearing traveling clothes.Surely there was a taxi in town that could deliver her to the inn.When shed asked Jo Marie about catching a cab, the innkeeper had surprised her and offered to meet her at the stop just off the freeway where the bus would leave her.Looks like were in for lovely weather, the older woman sitting across the aisle casually mentioned.Ellie had noticed her a couple times earlier.Every time Ellies phone beeped, she caught the woman glancing in her direction.This is the best time of year to visit.You are visiting, arent you?Yes, Ellie said.The other woman was busily knitting without so much as looking at her hands as she wove the yarn around the needles.I come every year to visit my children and grandchildren.My daughter and son in law both work, and I didnt want them to take time off to come collect me from the airport.My grandson is meeting me at Park and Ride in Olalla.Im meeting someone for the first time.He works in the Navy shipyard, Ellie said.She braced herself, anticipating some form of censure from the older woman.If this knitter was anything like her mother, a warning or comment would soon be forthcoming.When the other woman didnt say anything, Ellie realized how ridiculous she was being.Her mother had brainwashed her into expecting negativity.We met over the Internet in an online book club, Ellie added, testing the waters yet again.Well, actually, he asked to be my friend on Facebook.His online book club had a link with mine  its a long story.She suspected the older woman didnt know that much about social media.I understand thats the way a lot of young people meet these days.Like I said, this is our first face to face meeting, Ellie continued.I admit Im nervous.And talkative, which wasnt a good combination, but she couldnt help herself.Its rather romantic, isnt it?Ellie smiled.It was romantic and risky and silly all in one.I think Im half in love with him already.Funny, isnt it, when our entire relationship to this point has consisted of phone calls, emails, and text messages?Its my opinion that love rarely makes sense, the other woman commented.Im Martha, by the way.Ellie.Pleased to meet you, Ellie.My mother doesnt approve of me doing this, Ellie said, keeping her voice low and guarded.Its hard for us to let go of our children.Marthas look was thoughtful, as if she was remembering something from her own past.When Marilyn married Jack, I hated the thought of her moving to Washington State.Its all the way across the country from New Jersey.I was sure shed made a mistake, but she loves living in the Pacific Northwest.The truth is, I enjoy coming out each summer for a visit.Marilyn owns a hair salon on Harbor Street; thats the main street in Cedar Cove.Where are you staying, dear?Rose Harbor Inn.I know it; the inn is right up the hill from Marilyns shop.The view of the cove is magnificent from there.Tom had mentioned the same thing.The view was one of the reasons hed recommended Rose Harbor Inn.From the deck, not only was the lighthouse within sight, but shed be able to see the Bremerton Shipyard as well.Ellies cell pinged, and a quick look told her it was her mother yet again.She didnt know why she bothered to look.Another text.Another warning.Ellie sighed and saw Martha glance her way.Mom again, she said, replacing her phone.Shes convinced Im making a fool of myself.And if you are?Then Ill never live it down.Are you being foolish?Martha asked, in a friendly tone.Perhaps I am, Ellie admitted, stiffening her back, but frankly I dont care.Marthas smile was warm and gentle.As a mother, I can understand her fears.For my own children I would have loved to pass on the treasure that cost me tears and struggles and prayers, but I cant.My mothers heart wanted to spare them disappointment and pain, but life doesnt work that way.We each have to experience hurts in order to grow.We each must forge our own path.Im sure your mother means well.Ellie wished her mother viewed life that way.Martha left the bus in Olalla.My grandson recently got his drivers license.Hes excited about picking me up.She placed her knitting inside a quilted bag.Good luck to you and your young man.Thank you, Ellie said, for everything.The driver helped Martha out of the bus and then retrieved her suitcase.A young man wearing a Seattle Seahawks T shirt arrived in a minivan a couple minutes later, and Martha waved as he parked the vehicle in the Park and Ride lot.Ellie was the last one on the bus.It wont take long now, the driver assured her.Were only a few miles to the Cedar Cove exit.You can phone your ride, if you want.Okay.Ellie reached for her phone and the sheet of paper where shed written down Jo Maries name and contact information.The innkeeper answered right away, almost as if shed been sitting by the phone, anticipating her call.Rose Harbor Inn.Jo Marie sounded cheerful and upbeat, and instantly Ellie felt welcomed.Its Eleanor Reynolds, Ellie said, and then clarified, Ellie.Oh yes, I was expecting your call.Ill grab my keys and head out the door right now.You dont mind if I bring Rover with me, do you?I dont mind at all.Ellie was fond of animals.Tom was, too.One of his most lengthy emails was about the dog hed had while in grade school and how hed taught Ranger to catch a Frisbee in midair.Itd broken his heart when Ranger had died when he was in the seventh grade.Ellie had always had cats, but she hoped one day to have a dog, too.Ill see you in a few minutes, Jo Marie promised.Thank you.Ellie disconnected the line and exhaled a slow breath.She felt better than she had since shed boarded the plane for the short ride between Bend and Seattle.No matter what her mother said, she had a good feeling about this adventure.A very good feeling.3     Once I got the call from Eleanor Reynolds, I loaded Rover into my car and made a quick run to the Texaco service station off the first Cedar Cove exit on Highway 16.I saw her right away, standing alone with her one piece of luggage, looking a bit lost and nervous.Rover leaped from the backseat into the front as soon as I turned into the parking lot.Wed made this trip before, picking up guests who rode the shuttle bus from the airport into town.I pulled into the parking space in front of the mini mart and turned off the engine.Although wed spoken three times over the phone, I had yet to get a good picture of what to expect from Eleanor Reynolds.She was younger than what Id assumed, especially after our initial conversation.Eleanor?I questioned, and quickly revised it to Ellie?Ellie Reynolds?The woman looked up and nodded.Yes, thats me.You must be Jo Marie?Rover barked from the front seat of the car.And Rover, I added.Youre young, Ellie said, as if surprised.I guess I was expecting someone closer to my mothers age.She reached for her suitcase and headed toward the car.I was just thinking the same thing about you.People say I sound much older on the phone.Elocution was important to my grandmother.And then, as if she felt the need to explain further, she added, We lived with my grandparents while I was growing up.I opened the car trunk.I hope you enjoy your stay in Cedar Cove.I know I will, she said, smiling broadly.She effortlessly set her suitcase inside and then came around to the passenger side.As soon as he realized Ellie was getting in the car, Rover returned to the backseat.Ellie climbed inside and then turned around to pet Rover.He basked in her attention and then immediately settled down, circling on the seat several times before finding a comfortable position.Ellie clipped her seat belt into place.I hope this isnt too much of an inconvenience, she said.I would have been happy to catch a cab.Its no problem.I do it all the time; its part of the service the inn provides.I got the schedule for my return trip, too  in case I need it, she added.I was about to question her but changed my mind.She seemed a bit anxious and reached for her phone twice, checking emails, during the short drive back to the inn.Its my mother, she mumbled.Then, as if shed made a momentous decision, she added, Im going to ignore her; otherwise shell ruin everything.Apparently, a comment from me wasnt necessary, and frankly, I was just as glad, because I wasnt sure what to say.Ill leave you to get settled in your room while I run an errand, if thats all right.Oh sure, she was quick to assure me.Contrary to what my mother believes, I dont need a babysitter.No, you dont.The poor girl clearly had mother issues.She hadnt said anything about her mother during our short phone conversations previously.What little I was able to read between the lines told me Ellies mother was convinced this trip was a huge mistake.I met a wonderful grandmotherly woman on the bus, Ellie continued, chatting away as if she was eager to tell me about the experience.She was so wise and reassuring.I could be making a big mistake coming to Cedar Cove, but if so, then it will be a learning experience.Her meaning was lost on me, but I nodded as if I understood.We pulled up to the inn and Rover obediently followed us inside.I hadnt taken him for our morning walk yet, and he instantly trotted over to where I stored his leash, letting me know he was eager and ready to follow routine.In a bit, Rover, I told him.To his credit, hed been patient, and I appreciated it.I glanced at my wrist; it was nearly time to meet Peggy.Ellie signed in and I handed her the key to her room and showed her around the communal areas of the inn before leading her up the stairs to her room.Are there other guests this weekend?she asked.A married couple and a local resident.Local resident?she repeated, as if she found it difficult to understand why someone from town would opt to spend the weekend at a bed and breakfast.Yes, Peter McConnell called this morning.Apparently, hes having some plumbing work done on his house and the waters being turned off.Hed normally go out of town, but hes working a half shift on Saturday and needed to be in the area.Oh.He wont check in until late this afternoon.I dont know how much well see of him.I plan to be busy myself, Ellie told me.Im meeting a  friend.A male friend   Ah, so that was it.No wonder her mother was concerned.Well, good for Ellie.It was long past time that this bird left the nest.Once Ellie was comfortably settled in her room, I left with Rover to meet Peggy Beldon at the downtown bakery.Eager to exercise, Rover all but dragged me down the hill toward the waterfront.The day couldnt have been any more beautiful.The sky was cloudless and a luscious shade of blue that made it difficult to look anywhere else.The waters of the cove were flat and clear, with an occasional eagle circling overhead, seeking out a meal.It wasnt unusual to see one swoop down and grab hold of an unfortunate salmon, swimming too close to the surface.I saw Peggy even before I reached Harbor Street.She sat at a table outside, luxuriating in the warmth of the summer sun.Hi, I said, joining her.I hope Im not late.Not at all, Peggy said, reassuring me.Shed dressed comfortably in capri pants with a red checkered shirt over a matching red sleeveless top.Her hair was shorter, which told me shed had a recent haircut.You look all summery, I said, as I pulled out the chair across from her and sat down.Rover settled by my feet, pressing his chin over the top of my foot.Peggy had ordered me a cup of coffee.Thanks.I lifted the cup and took a sip.Its my turn to buy next.No worries.Now that I was comfortable, I got to the subject that was prominent on my mind.Were you able to talk to Bob about Mark?I was.She leaned slightly closer.And?I was unable to hide the eagerness in my voice.Peggy shrugged.I wish there was more to tell.Bob met Mark for the first time at the local hardware store.How long ago?I asked him that, too, and he seems to think it must have been five or six years now, but I dont think it was near that long.My guess is about four years, but I could be off.It seems like hes always been around.So Bob met Mark at the hardware store and the two struck up a conversation?Yes.Did Mark mention where hed moved from?Not that Bob remembered.All Bob remembered was Mark telling him that he was new in town and looking for odd jobs.Said he was retired, which Bob found humorous, seeing that Mark couldnt have been more than thirty five at the time.Did Bob happen to ask Mark why he moved to Cedar Cove?Youll have to ask Mark that yourself.But why not?Peggy asked, motioning toward the view.Its beautiful here, and a good place to raise a family.But as far as I can tell Mark doesnt have a family.True.I wished Bob had known more.The fact was, I already knew just about everything hed mentioned to Peggy.Well, not the part about Bob and Mark meeting, but everything else.Did you notice that he likes to be paid in cash?I asked.Frankly, I couldnt help wondering if this was his way to avoid having to pay taxes.It seemed underhanded and not in line with what I knew about him.I didnt know that, Peggy said, frowning slightly.Bob is the one who deals with the finances.He never mentioned that.You should ask Mark.I did.Many times, but I had yet to get a satisfactory reply.I guess Id put too much emphasis on the small idiosyncrasies Id noticed about him that made me suspicious.This habit led me to believe he didnt want a money trail going back to him and that he wanted to keep his identity hidden from the outside world.Bob liked him right away, Peggy added, breaking into my thoughts.This surprised me.Mark wasnt a likeable kind of guy; it seemed he went out of his way to be cantankerous and disagreeable.At least that was my experience with him.Before Bob felt comfortable recommending Mark to others, he hired him to do a small job at the Thyme and Tide to test his skills.And Mark passed?With flying colors.Following that, Bob sent a number of small jobs Marks way for family and friends.Several people have thanked us.Mark is conscientious, and his prices are reasonable.What she said was true.Over the last year, Mark had completed a number of projects for me and either met or exceeded my expectations.The only problem Id had with him had to do with my rose garden, which seemed to have taken him an inordinate amount of time even before he broke his leg.The lengthy delay afterward was understandable.Still, I couldnt help feeling Marks dawdling had been deliberate  although for the life of me I couldnt imagine why he would want to delay planting a rose garden.Perhaps the answer was as simple as the fact that he wasnt keen on gardening.Is there anything else you can tell me about him?I asked.My voice must have been more animated than Id intended, because Peggys eyes widened.Any reason youre so curious?she asked.There really wasnt a reason except my curiosity.No, not really, I admitted, striving to sound as nonchalant as possible.Its just that he seems so  private.We all cherish our privacy, Peggy commented, without any censure.Dont you think?Well, yes, I suppose.What is it about Mark that intrigues you?Peggy asked.Im not intrigued, I returned instantly.Im curious.It seems to me hes hiding something.There, Id said it.Mark?Peggy said his name as if it were a joke, worthy of laughter.His home is ?I searched for the right word.Spartan  theres nothing there that links him to anyone or any particular place.I asked him, as sort of a joke, if he was part of the Witness Protection Program.You didnt?Peggys eyes grew even rounder.And what did he say?He laughed it off.Actually, now that I mentioned it, Mark had made it sound like one big joke.My mind churned, coming up with other possible scenarios.Maybe hes suffered some tragic loss and is running away from life.It made little sense to me that a man as talented as Mark would choose to be a neighborhood handyman.Jo Marie.Peggy, who had been amused just moments earlier, grew serious.I looked up and our eyes met and held.Yes?I think its important that you examine why you find it so necessary to know about Mark.Necessary?That was a bit of a stretch.Yes.She was actually serious; I could see it on her face.Like I said, Im just inquisitive.Have you asked yourself what it is about Mark that makes you want to delve into his life?Youre making more of this than warranted, I insisted.Im not interested in Mark  personally.Okay, I read a lot of mysteries and enjoy solving them.People behave the way they do because of something in their past.Trust me, when it comes to Mark, something is off.Something sinister?Doubtful.As far as I could tell, Mark was as honest as a summers day was long.Do you have feelings for him?my friend asked, in that gentle way of hers that inspired confidence.Mostly Mark irritated me.He was often cranky and ill tempered, but buried beneath that outer crust was a decent human being.At times it was hard to believe, but most days we got along perfectly fine.Earlier that spring, Id been grateful for his help in finding Rover, whod run off.Id been beside myself with worry.Mark had spent hours searching for him.I had, too, of course, but itd been Mark whod found him and Mark whod brought Rover home.For that alone I owed him.Jo Marie, Peggy said, lowering her voice to a mere whisper.Do you have  She hesitated, as if unsure she should continue.What?I prodded.Sitting up a bit straighter, she plunged ahead.Are you  falling for Mark?For Mark?Now it was my turn to hold back a laugh.No way.I didnt need to think about my answer.Absolutely not, I said, without the least bit of hesitation.Half the time Im not even sure I like him.A lot of wonderful romantic relationships start out that way.I reached for my coffee and shook my head.I suppose my curiosity about him might look like that, I said, wanting to downplay the suggestion as much as possible.My fear was that protesting too strenuously would only convince Peggy I was interested in Mark.You need to know something about me, I added, figuring this was the best way to put a halt to this kind of thinking.I love Paul Rose with all my heart.He was my husband and my soul mate.When we met, Id more or less decided I would probably never marry.I doubted there were many decent men left in this world.I was cheated out of more time with him, but still, I had that year, that one glorious year that I will treasure the rest of my life.I dont want to fall in love again.Frankly, I didnt think my heart would survive another loss if something were to happen to another man I loved.I raised both hands.Maybe I am going a bit overboard with this thing with Mark.The only reason I asked is because Ive seen him so regularly the past year and yet I know practically nothing about him.I cant help feeling that Mark has an interesting story.But whatever his story, its clear he doesnt want others to know.In retrospect, it was probably best, as the proverb went, to let sleeping dogs lie.If Mark had a secret past he wanted to hide, then far be it from me to dig it up.We changed the subject, talked business for a few minutes, and then it was time for both of us to get back to our day.For my part, I had a set of guests who were due to arrive sometime this afternoon.The Porters: Roy and Maggie.After thanking Peggy for the coffee, Rover and I walked back up the steep hill that led from the waterfront area to Rose Harbor Inn.As we rounded the corner and walked down the lengthy driveway leading to the inn, I paused and took in the three story structure that was now my home.Seeing it never failed to stir me.The house had been built in the late 1800s and was one of the most prominent structures in Cedar Cove.It sat on a hillside overlooking the cove, with views of the Olympic Mountain Range and the lighthouse in the background.I remembered the first time I saw the inn.In that instant I knew this was home, the sense of welcome overwhelming me.The first night there, after taking ownership, Id keenly felt Pauls presence as if hed stepped briefly back into life to offer his love and reassurance.It had been his way of letting me know that Id made the right decision purchasing the inn.As I stood admiring the inn, with Rover straining against the leash, a white SUV drove past me, toward the inn, pulling into the small parking area reserved for guests.Simultaneously both the passenger and the drivers door opened and out stepped an attractive young couple.Roy and Maggie Porter had arrived.I started to call out a greeting but paused when Roy slammed the car door.Without a word, he went to the back of his vehicle and got out two suitcases and headed toward the inn without looking back.When Maggie saw me, she paused and then offered an apologetic smile as though embarrassed by her husbands abrupt behavior.I raised my hand.Maggie?She nodded.You must be Jo Marie.I am.Welcome to Rose Harbor Inn.Thanks.She glanced toward the inn.Roy was on the top of the porch and seemed to be waiting for her, although he stood with his back to us both.Youll have to forgive Roys bad mood.He wasnt keen about taking this weekend off from work.But weve been planning it for such a long while and  Her voice faded away.We need time together.All couples do, I said, agreeing with her.Maggie started toward the inn and I walked with her.Despite her reassurances, I had the strongest feeling something was very wrong between Maggie and Roy Porter.4     Maggie drew in a deep breath and followed Roy up the stairs to the room Jo Marie had assigned them.Roy had barely said a word the entire time theyd registered.Twice shed been forced to bite her tongue and swallow her pride.Her husband couldnt make it any more obvious that he didnt want to be at the innor, for that matter, with her.Roy used the key to unlock the door to their room and then swung it open, letting her go inside before him.It was a lovely room with a four poster bed and dresser.A bouquet of roses rested on top of the dresser.Large windows overlooked the coves blue green waters.At the marina the boats gently bobbed up and down, the sailboats masts tilting slightly.Its beautiful, she whispered.Roy didnt appear to agree or appreciate the beauty she saw.He remained stiff and silent.His resentment seemed to radiate off him in waves.On the entire three and a half hour drive over from Yakima, Roy hadnt uttered more than a few words.Several times Maggie had made a futile effort to break the silence, but it hadnt done much good.Roy responded with one word, clipped replies, if he answered at all.She tried not to think about her husbands bad mood and forced herself instead to focus on the scene outside the window.The beauty of it inspired and encouraged her.Willing to try yet again, she turned back around to face Roy.Dont you think so?she asked, doing her best to sound upbeat and cheerful.Think what?That the view is lovely.Roy shrugged as if he hadnt noticed and furthermore couldnt have cared less.He stood next to his suitcase with his hands buried deep inside his pockets.
