Now, I didn't want to do the play at all, and not only because I'd come to realize that drama was just about the most boring class ever invented.The thing was, I'd already taken Jamie to homecoming, and with her as the angel, I just couldn't bear the thought that I'd have to spend every afternoon with her for the next month or so.Being seen with her once was bad enough ...but being seen with her every day?What would my friends say?But I could tell this was really important to her.The simple fact that she'd asked made that clear.Jamie never asked anyone for a favor.I think deep down she suspected that no one would ever do her a favor because of who she was.The very realization made me sad."What about Jeff Bangert?He might do it," I offered.Jamie shook her head."He can't.His father's sick, and he has to work in the store after school until his father gets back on his feet. ""What about Darren Woods?""He broke his arm last week when he slipped on the boat.His arm is in a sling. ""Really?I didn't know that," I said, stalling, but Jamie knew what I was doing."I've been praying about it, Landon," she said simply, and sighed for the second time."I'd really like this play to be special this year, not for me, but because of my father.I want it to be the best production ever.I know how much it will mean to him to see me be the angel, because this play reminds him of my mother.... "She paused, collecting her thoughts."It would be terrible if the play was a failure this year, especially since I'm involved. "She stopped again before going on, her voice becoming more emotional as she went on."I know Eddie would do the best he could, I really do.And I'm not embarrassed to do the play with him, I'm really not.Actually, he's a very nice person, but he told me that he's having second thoughts about doing it.Sometimes people at school can be so ...so ...cruel, and I don't want Eddie to be hurt.But ... "She took a deep breath, "but the real reason I'm asking is because of my father.He's such a good man, Landon.If people make fun of his memory of my mother while I'm playing the part ...well, that would break my heart.And with Eddie and me ...you know what people would say. "I nodded, my lips pressed together, knowing that I would have been one of those people she was talking about.In fact, I already was.Jamie and Eddie, the dynamic duo, we called them after Miss Garber had announced that they'd be the ones doing the roles.The very fact that it was I who had started it up made me feel terrible, almost sick to my stomach.She straightened up a little in her seat and looked at me sadly, as if she already knew I was going to say no.I guess she didn't know how I was feeling.She went on."I know that challenges are always part of the Lord's plan, but I don't want to believe that the Lord is cruel, especially to someone like my father.He devotes his life to God, he gives to the community.And he's already lost his wife and has had to raise me on his own.And I love him so much for it.... "Jamie turned away, but I could see the tears in her eyes.It was the first time I'd ever seen her cry.I think part of me wanted to cry, too."I'm not asking you to do it for me," she said softly, "I'm really not, and if you say no, I'll still pray for you.I promise.But if you'd like to do something kind for a wonderful man who means so much to me ...Will you just think about it?"Her eyes looked like those of a cocker spaniel that had just messed on the rug.I looked down at my feet."I don't have to think about it," I finally said."I'll do it. "I really didn't have a choice, did I?The next day I talked to Miss Garber, went through the audition, and got the part.Eddie, by the way, wasn't upset at all.In fact, I could tell he was actually relieved about the whole thing.When Miss Garber asked him if he'd be willing to let me play the role of Tom Thornton, his face sort of relaxed right there and one of his eyes popped back open."Y y yes, a a absolutely," he said, stuttering."I I I un un understand. "It took him practically ten seconds to get the words out.For his generosity, however, Miss Garber gave him the role of the bum, and we knew he'd do fairly well in that role.The bum, you see, was completely mute, but the angel always knew what he was thinking.At one point in the play she has to tell the mute bum that God will always watch out for him because God especially cares for the poor and downtrodden.That was one of the tip offs to the audience that she'd been sent from heaven.Like I said earlier, Hegbert wanted it to be real clear who offered redemption and salvation, and it certainly wasn't going to be a few rickety ghosts who just popped up out of nowhere.Rehearsals started the next week, and we rehearsed in the classroom, because the Playhouse wouldn't open their doors for us until we'd got all the "little bugs" out of our performance.By little bugs, I mean our tendency to accidentally knock over the props.The props had been made about fifteen years ago, when the play was in its first year, by Toby Bush, a sort of roving handyman who had done a few projects for the Playhouse in the past.He was a roving handyman because he drank beer all day long while he worked, and by about two o'clock or so he'd really be flying.I guess he couldn't see straight, because he'd accidentally whack his fingers with the hammer at least once a day.Whenever that happened, he'd throw down the hammer and jump up and down, holding his fingers, cursing everyone from his mother to the devil.When he finally calmed down, he'd have another beer to soothe the pain before going back to work.His knuckles were the size of walnuts, permanently swollen from years of whacking, and no one was willing to hire him on a permanent basis.The only reason Hegbert had hired him at all was because he was far and away the lowest bidder in town.But Hegbert wouldn't allow drinking or cursing, and Toby really didn't know how to work within such a strict environment.As a result, the work was kind of sloppy, though it wasn't obvious right off the bat.After a few years the props began to fall apart, and Hegbert took it upon himself to keep the things together.But while Hegbert was good at thumping the Bible, he wasn't too good at thumping nails, and the props had bent, rusty nails sticking out all over, poking through the plywood in so many places that we had to be careful to walk exactly where we were supposed to.If we bumped them the wrong way, we'd either cut ourselves or the props would topple over, making little nail holes all over the stage floor.After a couple of years the Playhouse stage had to be resurfaced, and though they couldn't exactly close their doors to Hegbert, they made a deal with him to be more careful in the future.That meant we had to practice in the classroom until we'd worked out the "little bugs. "Fortunately Hegbert wasn't involved with the actual production of the play, because of all his ministering duties.That role fell to Miss Garber, and the first thing she told us to do was to memorize our lines as quickly as possible.We didn't have as much time as was usually allotted for rehearsals because Thanksgiving came on the last possible day in November, and Hegbert didn't want the play to be performed too close to Christmas, so as not to interfere with "its true meaning. "That left us only three weeks to get the play just right, which was about a week shorter than usual.The rehearsals began at three o'clock, and Jamie knew all her lines the first day there, which wasn't really surprising.What was surprising was that she knew all my lines, too, as well as everyone else's.We'd be going over a scene, she'd be doing it without the script, and I'd be looking down at a stack of pages, trying to figure out what my next line should be, and whenever I looked up she had this real shiny look about her, as if waiting for a burning bush or something.The only lines I knew were the mute bum's, at least on that first day, and all of a sudden I was actually envious of Eddie, at least in that regard.This was going to be a lot of work, not exactly what I'd expected when I'd signed up for the class.My noble feelings about doing the play had worn off by the second day of rehearsals.Even though I knew I was doing the "right thing," my friends didn't understand it at all, and they'd been riding me since they'd found out."You're doing what?"Eric asked when he learned about it."You're doing the play with Jamie Sullivan?Are you insane or just plain stupid?"I sort of mumbled that I had a good reason, but he wouldn't let it drop, and he told everyone around us that I had a crush on her.I denied it, of course, which just made them assume it was true, and they'd laugh all the louder and tell the next person they saw.The stories kept getting wilder, tooby lunchtime I'd heard from Sally that I was thinking of getting engaged.I actually think Sally was jealous about it.She'd had a crush on me for years, and the feeling might have been mutual except for the fact that she had a glass eye, and that was something I just couldn't ignore.Her bad eye reminded me of something you'd see stuffed into the head of a mounted owl in a tacky antique shop, and to be honest, it sort of gave me the willies.I guess that was when I started to resent Jamie again.I know it wasn't her fault, but I was the one who was taking the arrows for Hegbert, who hadn't exactly gone out of his way the night of homecoming to make me feel welcome.I began to stumble through my lines in class for the next few days, not really even attempting to learn them, and occasionally I'd crack a joke or two, which everyone laughed at, except for Jamie and Miss Garber.After rehearsal was over I'd head home to put the play out of my mind, and I wouldn't even bother to pick up the script.Instead I'd joke with my friends about the weird things Jamie did and tell fibs about how it was Miss Garber who had forced me into the whole thing.Jamie, though, wasn't going to let me off that easy.No, she got me right where it hurts, right smack in the old ego.I was out with Eric on Saturday night following Beaufort's third consecutive state championship in football, about a week after rehearsals had started.We were hanging out at the waterfront outside of Cecil's Diner, eating hushpuppies and watching people cruising in their cars, when I saw Jamie walking down the street.She was still a hundred yards away, turning her head from side to side, wearing that old brown sweater again and carrying her Bible in one hand.It must have been nine o'clock or so, which was late for her to be out, and it was even stranger to see her in this part of town.I turned my back to her and pulled the collar up on my jacket, but even Margaretwho had banana pudding where her brain should have beenwas smart enough to figure out who she was looking for."Landon, your girlfriend is here. ""She's not my girlfriend," I said."I don't have a girlfriend. ""Your fiance, then. "I guess she'd talked to Sally, too."I'm not engaged," I said."Now knock it off. "I glanced over my shoulder to see if she'd spotted me, and I guess she had.She was walking toward us.I pretended not to notice."Here she comes," Margaret said, and giggled."I know," I said.Twenty seconds later she said it again."She's still coming. "I told you she was quick."I know," I said through gritted teeth.If it wasn't for her legs, she could almost drive you as crazy as Jamie.I glanced around again, and this time Jamie knew I'd seen her and she smiled and waved at me.I turned away, and a moment later she was standing right beside me."Hello, Landon," she said to me, oblivious of my scorn."Hello, Eric, Margaret ... "She went around the group.Everyone sort of mumbled "hello" and tried not to stare at the Bible.Eric was holding a beer, and he moved it behind his back so she wouldn't see it.Jamie could even make Eric feel guilty if she was close enough to him.They'd been neighbors at one time, and Eric had been on the receiving end of her talks before.Behind her back he called her "the Salvation Lady," in obvious reference to the Salvation Army."She would have been a brigadier general," he liked to say.But when she was standing right in front of him, it was another story.In his mind she had an in with God, and he didn't want to be in her bad graces."How are you doing, Eric?I haven't seen you around much recently. "She said this as if she still talked to him all the time.He shifted from one foot to the other and looked at his shoes, playing that guilty look for all it was worth."Well, I haven't been to church lately," he said.Jamie smiled that glittery smile."Well, that's okay, I suppose, as long as it doesn't become a habit or anything. ""It won't. "Now I've heard of confessionthat thing when Catholics sit behind a screen and tell the priest about all their sinsand that's the way Eric was when he was next to Jamie.For a second I thought he was going to call her "ma'am. ""You want a beer?"Margaret asked.I think she was trying to be funny, but no one laughed.Jamie put her hand to her hair, tugging gently at her bun."Oh ...no, not really ...thank you, though. "She looked directly at me with a really sweet glow, and right away I knew I was in trouble.I thought she was going to ask me off to the side or something, which to be honest I thought would turn out better, but I guess that wasn't in her plans."Well, you did really well this week at rehearsals," she said to me."I know you've got a lot of lines to learn, but I'm sure you're going to get them all real soon.And I just wanted to thank you for volunteering like you did.You're a real gentleman. ""Thanks," I said, a little knot forming in my stomach.I tried to be cool, but all my friends were looking right at me, suddenly wondering if I'd been telling them the truth about Miss Garber forcing it on me and everything.I hoped they missed it."Your friends should be proud of you," Jamie added, putting that thought to rest."Oh, we are," Eric said, pouncing."Very proud.He's a good guy, that Landon, what with his volunteering and all. "Oh no.Jamie smiled at him, then turned back to me again, her old cheerful self."I also wanted to tell you that if you need any help, you can come by anytime.We can sit on the porch like we did before and go over your lines if you need to. "I saw Eric mouth the words "like we did before" to Margaret.This really wasn't going well at all.By now the pit in my stomach was as big as Paul Bunyan's bowling ball."That's okay," I mumbled, wondering how I could squirm my way out of this."I can learn them at home. ""Well, sometimes it helps if someone's there to read with you, Landon," Eric offered.I told you he'd stick it to me, even though he was my friend."No, really," I said to him, "I'll learn the lines on my own. ""Maybe," Eric said, smiling, "you two should practice in front of the orphans, once you've got it down a little better.Sort of a dress rehearsal, you know?I'm sure they'd love to see it. "You could practically see Jamie's mind start clicking at the mention of the word orphans.Everyone knew what her hot button was."Do you think so?"she asked.Eric nodded seriously."I'm sure of it.Landon was the one who thought of it first, but I know that if I was an orphan, I'd love something like that, even if it wasn't exactly the real thing. ""Me too," Margaret chimed in.As they spoke, the only thing I could think about was that scene from Julius Caesar where Brutus stabs him in the back.Et tu, Eric?"It was Landon's idea?"she asked, furrowing her brow.She looked at me, and I could tell she was still mulling it over.But Eric wasn't about to let me off the hook that easy.Now that he had me flopping on the deck, the only thing left to do was gut me."You'd like to do that, wouldn't you, Landon?"he said."Helping the orphans, I mean. "It wasn't exactly something you could answer no to, was it?"I reckon so," I said under my breath, staring at my best friend.Eric, despite the remedial classes he was in, would have been one hell of a chess player."Good, then, it's all settled.That's if it's okay with you, Jamie. "His smile was so sweet, it could have flavored half the RC cola in the county."Well ...yes, I suppose I'll have to talk to Miss Garber and the director of the orphanage, but if they say it's okay, I think it would be a fine idea. "And the thing was, you could tell she was really happy about it.Checkmate.The next day I spent fourteen hours memorizing my lines, cursing my friends, and wondering how my life had spun so out of control.My senior year certainly wasn't turning out the way I thought it would when it began, but if I had to perform for a bunch of orphans, I certainly didn't want to look like an idiot.The first thing we did was talk to Miss Garber about our plans for the orphans, and she thought it was a marvelous idea.That was her favorite word, by the waymarvelousafter she'd greeted you with "Hellooooo. "On Monday, when she realized that I knew all my lines, she said, "Marvelous!"and for the next two hours whenever I'd finish up a scene, she'd say it again.By the end of the rehearsal, I'd heard it about four zillion times.But Miss Garber actually went our idea one better.She told the class what we were doing, and she asked if other members of the cast would be willing to do their parts as well, so that the orphans could really enjoy the whole thing.The way she asked meant that they really didn't have a choice, and she looked around the class, waiting for someone to nod so she could make it official.No one moved a muscle, except for Eddie.Somehow he'd inhaled a bug up his nose at that exact moment, and he sneezed violently.The bug flew out his nose, shot across his desk, and landed on the floor right by Norma Jean's leg.She jumped out of her chair and screamed out loud, and the people on either side of her shouted, "Eww ...gross!"The rest of the class started looking around and craning their necks, trying to see what happened, and for the next ten seconds there was total pandemonium in the classroom.For Miss Garber, that was as good of an answer as she needed."Marvelous," she said, closing the discussion.Jamie, meanwhile, was getting really excited about performing for the orphans.During a break in rehearsals she pulled me aside and thanked me for thinking of them."There's no way you would know," she said almost conspiratorially, "but I've been wondering what to do for the orphanage this year.I've been praying about it for months now because I want this Christmas to be the most special one of all. ""Why is this Christmas so important?"I asked her, and she smiled patiently, as if I'd asked a question that didn't really matter."It just is," she said simply.The next step was to talk it over with Mr.Jenkins, the director of the orphanage.Now I'd never met Mr.Jenkins before, being that the orphanage was in Morehead City, which was across the bridge from Beaufort, and I'd never had any reason to go there.When Jamie surprised me with the news the following day that we'd be meeting him later that evening, I was sort of worried that I wasn't dressed nice enough.I know it was an orphanage, but a guy wants to make a good impression.Even though I wasn't as excited about it as Jamie was (no one was as excited as Jamie), I didn't want to be regarded as the Grinch who ruined Christmas for the orphans, either.Before we went to the orphanage for our meeting, we had to walk to my house to pick up my mom's car, and while there, I planned on changing into something a little nicer.The walk took about ten minutes or so, and Jamie didn't say much along the way, at least until we got to my neighborhood.The homes around mine were all large and well kept, and she asked who lived where and how old the houses were.I answered her questions without much thought, but when I opened the front door to my house, I suddenly realized how different this world was compared with her own.She had a shocked expression on her face as she looked around the living room, taking in her surroundings.No doubt it was the fanciest home she'd ever been in.A moment later I saw her eyes travel to the paintings that lined the walls.My ancestors, so to speak.As with many southern families, my entire lineage could be traced in the dozen faces that lined the walls.She stared at them, looking for a resemblance, I think, then turned her attention to the furnishings, which still looked practically new, even after twenty years.The furniture had been handmade, assembled or carved from mahogany and cherry, and designed specifically for each room.It was nice, I had to admit, but it wasn't something I really thought about.To me, it was just a house.My favorite part of it was the window in my room that led to the porch on the upper level.That was my escape hatch.I showed her around, though, giving her a quick tour of the sitting room, the library, the den, and the family room, Jamie's eyes growing wider with each new room.My mom was out on the sun porch, sipping a mint julep and reading, and heard us poking around.She came back inside to say hello.I think I told you that every adult in town adored Jamie, and that included my mom.Even though Hegbert was always giving the kinds of sermons that had our family's name written all over them, my mom never held it against Jamie, because of how sweet she was.So they talked while I was upstairs rifling through my closet for a clean shirt and a tie.Back then boys wore ties a lot, especially when they were meeting someone in a position of authority.When I came back down the stairs fully dressed, Jamie had already told my mom about the plan."It's a wonderful idea," Jamie said, beaming at me."Landon's really got a special heart. "My momafter making sure she'd heard Jamie correctlyfaced me with her eyebrows raised.She stared at me like I was an alien."So this was your idea?"my mom asked.Like everyone else in town, she knew Jamie didn't lie.I cleared my throat, thinking of Eric and what I still wanted to do to him.It involved molasses and fire ants, by the way."Kind of," I said."Amazing. "It was the only word she could get out.She didn't know the details, but she knew I must have been boxed into a corner to do something like this.Mothers always know stuff like that, and I could see her peering closely at me and trying to figure it out.To escape her inquisitive gaze, I checked my watch, feigned surprise, and casually mentioned to Jamie that we'd better be going.My mom got the car keys from her pocketbook and handed them to me, still giving me the once over as we headed out the door.I breathed a sigh of relief, imagining that I'd somehow gotten away with something, but as I walked Jamie to the car, I heard my mother's voice again."Come on over anytime, Jamie!"my mom shouted."You're always welcome here. "Even mothers could stick it to you sometimes.I was still shaking my head as I got in the car."Your mother's a wonderful lady," Jamie said.I started the engine."Yeah," I said, "I guess so. ""And your house is beautiful. ""Uh huh. ""You should count your blessings. ""Oh," I said, "I do.I'm practically the luckiest guy alive. "Somehow she didn't catch the sarcastic tone of my voice.We got to the orphanage just about the time it was getting dark.We were a couple of minutes early, and the director was on the phone.It was an important call and he couldn't meet with us right away, so we made ourselves comfortable.We were waiting on a bench in the hallway outside his door, when Jamie turned to me.Her Bible was in her lap.I guess she wanted it for support, but then again, maybe it was just her habit."You did really well today," she said."With your lines, I mean. ""Thanks," I said, feeling proud and dejected at exactly the same time."I still haven't learned my beats, though," I offered.There was no way we could practice those on the porch, and I hoped she wasn't going to suggest it."You will.They're easy once you know you all the words. ""I hope so. "Jamie smiled, and after a moment she changed the subject, sort of throwing me off track.
