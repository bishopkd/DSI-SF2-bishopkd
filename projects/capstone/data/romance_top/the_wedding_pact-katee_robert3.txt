And then he was gone, leaving her wondering if maybe it really had all been a dream.She went so far as to check her phone to see if shed actually received a call, and there it was.Jamess number.Before she could think too closely about what she was doing, Carrigan saved the number under J and set her phone aside.She lay back in bed, going over the conversation even as she cursed herself for doing it.She wasnt sixteen anymore, dancing home from school after the popular boy talked to her.Hell, she hadnt even done that when she was sixteen.And James Halloran wasnt some harmless jock.He was a Halloran.More than that, he was now the man in charge of all Halloran territory and everyone under their control.One could argue that he was equally as powerful as her father, though shed never be stupid enough to say as much where Seamus OMalley could hear her.She rolled over and buried her face in her pillow.Sleep.Sleep was what she needed more than anything right now.Maybe in a few hours things would look clearer.*** Cillian stared at the untouched drink in front of him.He could almost taste the whiskey on this tongue.The sense memory made him want to lick his lips and puke, all at the same time.He hadnt touched the stuff in monthsnot whiskey, not Guinness, not anything else with a drop of alcohol.Guilt was his new drug, and he excelled at it.If he hadnt been so shit housed, Aiden wouldnt have decided that they should walk home from the bar that night.If they hadnt walked home, they wouldnt have been vulnerable, and that bastard Halloran wouldnt have had a chance for a drive by.If he hadnt had the chance, Devlin would still be alive.Cillian had been more concerned with chasing skirts than chasing grades in school, but even he remembered that old logic equationif A equaled B and B equaled C, then A equaled C.  It meant that Cillian was responsible for Devlins death.There was plenty of guilt to go around, or that was what both Teague and Aiden had told him time and time again over the last three months.They could keep believing that if it made them feel better.Cillian knew the truth.He might not have pulled the trigger, but he was the reason they were there in the first place.He glanced at the table where theyd shared their last drink.The memory of the night was hazy at bestat least before they hit the streetbut he vaguely recalled needling Teague about marrying a Sheridan.Theyd all been laughing and shooting the shit.For a second, itd almost been like the good old days.Before Aiden grew up and got serious about his role as heir.Before Teague took it upon himself to save every one of his siblings.Before Cillian recognized the noose around his neck and resolved to live life to the fullest before it yanked tight.Before.With Devlins death, Cillians entire life devolved into Before and After.He barely recognized the man he was now, the hard son of a bitch he was turning into.A wall of ice had started around his heart, and it only seemed to get thicker with each passing day, freezing him from the inside out.Is this seat taken?He barely glanced at the man.Nope.None of the seats at the bar were.Thered been a rowdy group in here earlier, but this close to last call, the place was damn near deserted.Which didnt explain why the hell this guy felt the need to sit directly next to him.Buy you a drink?It took a second for him to place the accent.Russian, but a little different.Maybe somewhere eastern European, like the Ukraine.He wasnt going to askit would just mean opening up a conversation that he didnt want in the first place.Cillian motioned at the full drink in front of him.I have one.Youve been staring at it for three hours.Its no longer drinkable.The man leaned forward and caught the bartenders eye.Two vodka.His accent turned the v into a w.  Since the man obviously wasnt going anywhere, Cillian finally gave him his full attention.He was in his mid thirties and had one of the best suits Cillian had ever seen.There was nothing crazy or loud about it, but it managed to scream money nonetheless.It was more than that, though.Cillian had expensive suits in his closet.Fuck, he was wearing one right now.But he was conscious of the cloth against his skin and the pull of the fabric every time he moved.This man wore his suit like hed been born to it.Cillian frowned.This didnt feel like a pickup, though.There was no interest in this guys dark eyesor at least no interest that had anything to do with sex.In a way, it was a reliefit saved him from having to explain that he didnt swing that waybut it also opened up the question: What the fuck was this guy doing?When the bartender, Benji, dropped the vodka off, the man lifted his.Im Dmitri.Cillian.The exchange of names was so automatic, his was out of his mouth before he had a chance to think better of it.Then again, he highly suspected this Dmitri knew exactly who he was.Nothing about this indicated it was anything but planned.The knowledge sat like a burr in the back of his throat.What do you want?Direct.I like that.Dmitri took his shot without flinching.We spend too much of our days wasting time making small talk.You and I, well, we know there is nothing guaranteed in this world.He didnt like this guy lumping them in together, especially when he still had no fucking idea what his game was.For the second and final timewhat do you want?Dmitri seemed to be considering him.Its bad luck to turn down a drink.I dont drink anymore.It didnt matter if his hand itched for the glass.He wasnt touching the damn thing.Cillian had been weak too much of his life.It stopped now.He nodded like Cillian had admitted to something entirely different.I understand.As for what I wantperhaps I want a friend.A friend.He put every ounce of his derision and disbelief into the last word.Is that so hard to believe?Men like us dont have many friends.We have pawns and enemies and familyand sometimes those circles even overlap.That was true enough, but that still didnt answer the question.The small hairs on the back of his neck stood at attention.Trust issues go with the territory.Dmitri laughed, a deep rolling sound that instantly made him want to join in.That laugh was a weapon, and one hed bet the man had honed to perfection.He shook his head.Lets be frank then, shall we?Somehow, he doubted there was anything about this conversation that would be frank.The man talked in circles, and he couldnt shake the feeling that he was giving Cillian enough rope to hang himself with.It didnt matter that he hadnt done anything or agreed to anything to merit the feeling.It was there nonetheless.Lets.Dmitri ignored the sarcastic tone.Your father is keen to marry off your oldest sister.He knew that.Hell, everyone knew that.Im aware.Im one of the men in the running, such as it is.Dmitri shrugged, as nonchalant as if he was talking about the weather.If Im going to become family, it wouldnt hurt to get to know her brothers.And youre a kindred soul of sorts.He blinked.This guy had a set of steel balls to come in here and chat him up like his sister was a sure thing.He sat back.If Carrigan had settled on someone, he would have heard about it.Most likely.He hadnt exactly been playing dutiful OMalley minion recently.It was possible hed missed the announcement.But Cillian didnt think so.There would be no reason for this guy to come cozy up to him if he thought Carrigan was a sure thing.No, this was something else altogether.He turned the shot glass, eyeing the writing on the side.It was the bar logo, one hed seen a million times.He watched Dmitri out of the corner of his eye.The man didnt seem impatient or worried or schemingwhich meant he was even more dangerous than Cillian had originally guessed.Dmitri was a player in this game of power, and it would be stupid to underestimate him.So he didnt tell him to get lost.Sure, I get that.If this man had his eye on Carrigan, Cillian had to figure out what his game was.He didnt seem like the normal power grabbing sort their father liked to string along by their noses.Dmitri practically reeked of power.Not to mention, Cillian had never seen him before.If he was someone of note in the Boston scene, he would have before now.All of which added up to the conclusion that the man was from out of town.What the fuck did you invite into our lives, you old goddamn fool?Dmitri plucked the shot glass out of his hand and downed that vodka, too.Perhaps next time well manage a meal.It wasnt a question, but he answered it anyway.For sure.He didnt want to spend another minute in this mans presence.If Devlin were alive, it would just be a matter of a few hours on the computer and theyd know where Dmitri was born, everything about his childhood, and what he ate for breakfast that day.Cillian was learning software and had fledgling hacker skills, but he was nowhere near as good as his little brother had been.Devlin.The loss reached up and sucker punched Cillian.He took a careful breath, all too aware of Dmitris attention on him.He had to get out of here.Showing weakness wasnt acceptable in front of his family, let alone in front of a man who might very well be an enemy.He pushed to his feet, weaving slightly.Ill see you around.He was aware of the mans gaze on him as he walked around the tables between the bar and the door.You can count on it.It sounded more like a threat than a promise.Seven Carrigan stared at the list her father had provided, not sure if she should be grateful or insulted.There were six names and phone numbers andnothing else.No information.No pictures.Nothing.She resisted the urge to crumple the paper and throw it across the room.Barely.Nothing an Internet search cant fix.She grabbed her rarely used laptop and brought up the Internet browser.The first nameChauncy Chauncer.Wow, your parents must either have been mad at you when you were born or presumptuous beyond measure.With a name like that, there couldnt be that many out there in the world.Thankfullyboth for her and any potential Chauncy Chauncersthe one that popped up in half a dozen articles on the first page seemed to be the one on her fathers list.She pulled up a picture of him and sighed.He was exactly what his name had led her to expectmiddle aged with a comb over to do Donald Trump proud.Gross.She might be staring thirty in the face, but that didnt mean she was willing to spend even a second of thinking about what sex with him would be like.It was bad enough that shed have to go on one date with him.Carrigan shuddered and moved onto the next name.Adam Marrow.This one had a wider field of range.She paged through site after site of different Adams, eventually narrowing it down to two.One was old enough to be her grandfather.The other was in his early forties and, if the news articles were anything to be believed, had apparently been under suspicion for killing his wife a little over a year ago.They hinted at his criminal background and listed his rap sheet.She pinched the bridge of her nose, fighting off a headache.That had to be the one.So far they were batting a thousand.Next up, Charles Pope.Her phone rang and she was so pathetically grateful for the distraction, she answered without checking the ID.Hello?Were you waiting by the phone for me to call?James.She huffed out a breath, though something in her chest gave a warm lurch.You again?Dont act like you dont want to hear from me.He laughed, low and intimate.Unless you dont, in which case I can go No!The word was out before she had a chance to take it back.Even talking to you is better than what I was just doing.Husband shopping.Her stomach twisted in on itself.This was what her life had come to.How can I refuse a woman in need?You cant.Except the one time shed actually needed rescuing, hed been the one to put her in that position.Desperate to think about something elseanything elseshe said, What are you wearing?A pause, as if shed shocked him.Youre hitting on me.Are you complaining?She twisted around in her chair and stared into the mirror on the wall across from her.When he didnt immediately respond, she kept going.The only alternative was to back down, and Carrigan was so goddamn tired of backing down.The only reason she kept taking Jamess calls was because of the distraction he offered her.If he wasnt going to play, there was no reason for her to stay on the phone.She really wanted him to stay on the phone.Shy?Thats okay, Ill go first.Im wearing a thin white tank top and a pair of black panties.She was a liar, but it would take all of five seconds to make it the truth.Lovely, youre testing me.His voice gained an edge.Good.At least someone was feeling as out of control as she was.I suppose youd like photographic proof.She stood and shimmied out of her long skirt, and then pinned the phone between her ear and shoulder while she unhooked her bra and took it off.Hold, please.Ignoring his cursing, she adjusted her angle so he would have to be blind to miss the faint outline of her nipples against the fabric of her tank top, and snapped a picture.She knew she was playing with fire.Good lord, of course she knew.But she wasnt about to stop.She grinned as she sent the picture.Carrigan put the phone back to her ear in time to hear his sharp inhale.Your turn.She held her breath, waiting to see if hed actually do it.Receiving pictures was one thing.Putting them out in the world was entirely another.Really, she shouldnt have taken the risk in the first place.There was no telling what he would do with themthey might show up on the Internet.Then who would want to marry her?Funny, but the idea of countless men checking out her rack didnt bother her nearly as much if it meant she dodged the marriage bullet.The shame on her family might be enough that her father would send her away permanently.Shed like to spend some time in New York or LA or even New Orleans.Maybe Rome or Paris or Tokyo.The world was so damn big and shed only seen a little slice of it.Her phone beeped, pulling her out of her thoughts.She glanced at the picture hed sent and started to shake.Oh my God.James was shirtless, wearing only those goddamn jeans she couldnt seem to get enough of.And they were unbuttoneda clear invitation if she ever saw one.An invitation she desperately wanted to accept.Damn, James.Somebody taught you how to selfie.Maybe Im a natural.His voice was little more than a growl.You started this, lovely.Tell me whats next.The strange mix of command and handing her the reins got her head back in the game.She walked over to her bed and climbed onto it, trying to ignore the trembling in her legs.She could be in charge.She wanted to be.Im lying on my bed.What color are the sheets?The question seemed to carry far more import than it should.White.They dont suit you.Red is your color.Go on.He sounded so damn imperial, as if he actually knew her.He didnt.No one did, really.She wore so many masks, sometimes she worried shed forget the woman at the center of them all.But this time he was right.She would have chosen red for herself.Carrigan put the thought away and focused on the now.You talk too much.My mistake.He didnt sound the least bit sorry.Good.She wasnt, either.How do you want it, lovely?Rough, Id bet.Youre not fucking breakable, and I think you love to be reminded of that fact.Something rustled on his end of the line.Close your eyes.She obeyed without thinking, and then instantly snapped them open.I thought I was in charge.You let me know if I get something wrong.His laugh told her how unlikely he found the possibility.Close your eyes.Fine.Fine.Shutting out the sight of her room narrowed her world down to his voice in her ear, and it was all too easy to imagine him here with her, a single breath away from touching her.Any second now hed reach out and haul her against him.Id drag you to the edge of that bed and spread those sweet thighs.Spread your thighs, lovely.Once again, she obeyed without thought.James hissed out a breath.I like the picture youd make, those amazing breasts straining against that pathetic excuse of a tank top, and those tiny panties.I want to rip the fucking things off.But not yet.She was picturing it, too.Picturing him standing over her, with that look in his blue eyesthe look that made her feel possessedowned.Like hed never get enough of her and he never wanted to.Hed looked at her the same way on that night four months ago, when hed been buried inside her.She shivered at the thought, her breath catching in her throat, her nipples pebbling.Yeah, I thought youd like that.But a pussy like yoursits meant to be worshipped.Youd take me to my knees, ready to do damn near anything to hear that sweet little whimper you make when you come.Touch yourself, lovely.Slowly.Trace a single finger over that goddamn lace.Are you wet for me?Her panties were soaked.Carrigan moaned as she traced her clit through the wet fabric.James, God, Im so wet.She hesitated, desire dragging words from her mouth she had no intention of letting free.For you.Im wet for you.And needy.I hear it in your voice.It was in his voice, too.They were poised on the edge of something she had the sudden fear she couldnt take back.It was sillythey were miles away from each other, connected only by a phone call.She had control.And if she could feel it slipping through her fingerswell, James never had to know.Are you touching yourself?Lovely, Im so hard, it wont take much to get me there.She slipped her hand into her panties, stroking herself.Im close, James.Every time she said his name, he made a sound that was almost pained.She liked it.She liked it a lot.Come with me.Circle your clit, just how you like it.He cursed long and hard, but she heard a zipper being dragged down.She obeyed, moaning, the sounds of his desire only stroking hers higher.Youre close.Another curse.Come for me, lovely.I want to hear that whimper.She pressed down on her clit as her body spasmed, that horribly weak and needy sound coming out of her mouth despite her best effort to keep it inside.She stroked herself twice more, unable to resist the delicious aftershocks of pleasure, and then dragged her hand out of her panties.Shit.James laughed, the sound free of the darkness he seemed to carry around inside himself.Yeah, that about sums it up.She opened her eyes and stared at her ceiling, reality crashing over her.Whatever came next, she didnt want it.James wasnt on the list.He was so off limits, it wasnt even funny.He was the only man she could be found with that might make her father actually hurt her.And she wanted him more than shed ever wanted a man before.I have to go.Wait She hung up before he could finish the sentence, before he could say something that would give her the excuse she desperately wanted to curl up around her phone and cling to the lifeline of his rough voice.She couldnt afford the weakness and, even more, she couldnt afford for him to realize he was a weakness.Though if he didnt know that after this conversation, he was an idiot.James Halloran might be many things, but stupid wasnt one of them.Damn it.*** James stepped into the shower, his mind whirling.He didnt make a habit of having phone sexwhy go for a substitute when you could have the real thing?butfuck.With Carrigan that had been hot as hell.His nerve endings were still snapping with the strength of that orgasm, and he wanted more.Now.He ducked his head under the spray and scrubbed a hand over his face.Hed known she wanted him, but knowing in theory was one thinghearing her coming as a result of what he was saying was totally another.Their having sex again had moved from the if category to the when.She was spooked.He got that.He was feeling pretty goddamn spooked himself.So hed give them both time.She had to come to him now.That was the only way this thing would play out with both of them satisfied.James washed his hair, pointedly ignoring the little voice inside him that muttered that hed never be satisfied with a piece of Carrigan as a replacement for all of her.All of her wasnt on the table.Even if it was, there were their families to consider.The thought of his family was enough to wash away the last of the feel good he had going.He needed to deal with Ricky, sooner rather than later.Right now his brother was cooling his heels in the room in the basement designed to hold people the Hallorans didnt want walking off the property without permission.Really, both Callista and Carrigan should have been in that room when they were here.It would have stopped their escape before it started.And one of themif not bothwould have died.Had he known as soon as he hauled Carrigan up to his room that shed find a way to escape?What if he hadnt given her the chance?What if hed gone with the normal protocol?He shook his head.It was pointless to focus on the past and play the what if game.He had plenty of problems in the here and now to focus on.So he forced himself to close out the part of his mind that wanted to revel in the recent conversation with Carrigan.That lighthearted feeling that he hadnt been sure he was still capable of had no place here.Not now.Ten minutes later, he was toweled off and dressed and heading downstairs.Michael met him at the landing on the main floor.Hes asking for you, boss.He made a face.Demanding, more like.Ill take care of it.Michael didnt immediately move out of the way.With all due respect, Im going with you.He hesitated, and then charged on.That kid is a rabid dog.Hell go for your throat without a thought and deal with the consequences later.James wanted to argue, to say he was wrong, that he and Ricky were family.But family wasnt the loving and cozy heartwarming made for TV movie that so many people believed.It was the poison in his veins that he could never bleed out, and the weight around his neck, dragging him into the deep.So he nodded and let Michael follow him into the basement.It felt darker here, danker, as if it really was a dungeon.It used to be his old mans favorite part of the house before his arthritis made navigating the basement stairs impossible.After that, rather than admit weakness, he just burrowed into his office and, for all intents and purposes, never came back out again.I wonder if hes warm enough in prison.James set the thought aside.If Victor hadnt gone off the goddamn deep end and decided to declare war on the OMalleys and Sheridans over a stupid insult, he wouldnt be behind bars right now.Discretion was the name of the game.Staying below the FBIs notice.He snorted.Those bastards had too much time on their hands.They noticed everything.But up until four months ago, they hadnt bothered to swat the fly that was the Halloran family.Victor was the reason that had all changed.Now Ricky had taken it into his fool head to follow in their old mans footsteps.James stopped outside the door and took a breath, steeling himself for what came next.He could scream to the moon that he didnt want thisdidnt want to have to take these stepsbut it changed nothing.Ricky was a threatworse, he was a stupid threat.That was unforgivable.James walked into the room, aware of Michael following him, and waited for the door to shut behind them.Ricky was zip tied to a chair bolted down in the middle of the room.The boys had done a good job, and he didnt have any bruises visible.He turned his head and spit on the ground at Jamess feet.Bastard.You directly disobeyed an order.It was a shitty order.Rickys blue eyes, the one thing all the members of their family shared, glittered in hate.Bringing in more girls is good for business.It didnt matter if it was or not.That wasnt the point.The point was his dumb ass brother was putting himself and everyone around him in danger.And no matter how potentially profitable it was, they were out of the fucking slave tradefor good.Except its not.If you bothered to do some fucking research before you charged blindly ahead, youd know that business is up since I disbanded the flesh trade.Ricky spit again.Your stomachs just too weak for what needs to be done.That wasnt his problem and they both knew it.What else have you been doing?Nothing.Damn it, he should have played this better.James crossed his arms over his chest, hating how his brother flinched at the sudden movement.Hed tried with Ricky.Hed tried reasoning with him.Hed tried restricting him.Hed even gone so far as to take a page out of their fathers book and beat the shit out of him.Nothing worked.If there was some magical way to get through to his brother, he sure as hell didnt know what it was.Hitting Ricky might feel satisfying in the moment, but it wouldnt change anythinganything except pushing James closer to monster territory.Youll stay down here until I figure out what to do with you.Rickys head snapped up.What the fuck?You heard me.He turned, giving his brother the insult of his back.And if I hear about you taking a woman without permission again, Ill kill you myself.He walked out of the room to Rickys cursing and locked the door behind him.James passed the key to Michael.He gets a meal a day.Thats it.Sure thing.Michael slipped the key into his pocket.How long you going to keep him down here?As long as it takes.Eight Carrigan chose her clothing with care.She always didtoo much of her life depended on other peoples perceptions of herbut tonight was especially important.Tonight she was going out with the poorly named Chauncy Chauncer.Short of a miracle, she didnt expect to see him again, but she still had an image to uphold.An image she despised.She grabbed a long dress from the back of her closet.It wasnaturallywhite, and the only thing daring about it was the square neckline that allowed a little cleavage.The rest of it would cover her from wrists to anklesa straitjacket of her own choosing.She kept her makeup light, and styled her hair in careful waves.Stepping back from the vanity, she sighed.I look like a virgin sacrifice.The first part was laughable.The latter was all too accurate.She stopped in front of her dresser, her hand going to the drawer where shed stashed Jamess album.She hadnt touched it since she got back into Boston.After running into him, and then talking to himand then letting him coax her into an orgasm over the phone, it felt like a betrayal to dig through his personal property.Besides, shed already practically memorized its contents.There was only one person the blond woman in the old photos could bethe three boys of varying ages she always had her arms around only confirmed it.Jamess mother.Carrigan didnt know much about her beyond she was dead and had been for years, but the way the woman looked at her sonsthere was love there.A whole hell of a lot.And shed taken the reminder of that love from him.She should give it back.It was the right thing to do.But if she did, there was no guarantee that he wouldnt live up to his word and leave her alone.That, she didnt want.Maybe Ill just hang on to it for a few more days.Its safe enough here.Ill give it back.Eventually.Satisfied, she glanced at the clock on the nightstand and confirmed that she was almost late.There was nothing left to do that she could pretend wasnt stalling.Damn it.She slipped on her heels and headed downstairs.As expected, her father waited at the front door.He took her appearance in with a single sweep of his gaze.Excellent.He gifted her with one of his rare smiles.That smile used to be something she strove for.When she was a kid, shed lived for her fathers approval.Shed bent over backward with piano lessons and good grades and anything that she thought would impress him to get that smile.Now?Now she saw it for what it washis approval of having a possession polished up to show off for a peer.He didnt see her as a real person.He never had.If shed been a son Well, shed stopped wishing for that right around the time she accepted that shed never be enough for Seamus OMalley, no matter how good she was.It didnt matter how good her grades were in college or how worthy her ideas for the family were.All that mattered was her value as a trading piece with his alliesand her ability to give them heirs.She stopped at the bottom of the stairs, feeling like a prize cow he was about to put on the market.The comparison made her stomach turn over, because it wasnt too far from reality.Her father finally nodded.The cars waiting outside.Carrigan waited a half second before she realized he wasnt going to say anything else.Disappointment soured her stomach, made worse because she knew better than to expect anything else.Twenty eight years, and hope still got the better of her on occasion.Determined not to let anything show on her face, she walked out of the house and down the steps to the waiting car.Liam held the door for her, and she pretended she didnt see the pity in his eyes.The ride was far too short for her peace of mind, and her nerves were still raw when they pulled up in front of La Coupole.It was a French restaurant that got its kicks from mimicking its famous cousin in Paris.Shed never been there before, mostly because the whole thing gave off a stink of new money, and Carrigan had better things to do with her limited free time than have men and women parading around like peacocks, each determined to prove that he really deserved to be in Bostons upper crust.Chauncy obviously numbered himself among them, which wasnt giving her high hopes for the meal.One meal.You can do one meal.She let Liam help her out of the car and stepped onto the sidewalk.A deep breath did nothing to shore up her failing courage.The whole thing was suddenly so much more real.The truth that shed been fighting off since her father handed her a list of names hit her in the face.He was really selling her off in marriage, even though hed have to be blind, deaf, and dumb not to see the value she could bring to their family and its various businesses.He didnt care that being forced into this would kill a part of her shed barely let off the leash, didnt care about anything but the bottom line.Carrigan had thought herself beyond the point of being able to be hurt by her father and his ambitions.She was wrong.Miss OMalley?She did her best to wipe any expression off her face, but something had to show through because Liam looked distinctly more uncomfortable when she faced him.He cleared his throat.If you want to go somewhere after this, Ill fudge the times for you.There it was again.Even her fathers muscle pitied her.She wanted to throw his pity back in his face, to insist that she was fine, that she was totally in control of her life.Lies.So many lies.Worst of all, she couldnt afford to do thatnot when Liam was offering her an unexpected escape.Just get through the dinner.She managed a smile.Thank you.He opened his mouth like he was about to say something, and then reconsidered and strode around the car to climb behind the drivers seat.With nothing left to keep her from the restaurant, she walked inside.The heat slapped her in the face as soon as she made it through the door, just this side of sweltering.She shrugged out of her coat and handed it to the hostess hovering just out of reach.Im meeting Mr.Chauncer.Yes, we know.Please, follow me.She turned without another word and marched deeper into the building, leaving Carrigan to follow her or be left behind.She was forced to hurry to keep up, nearly tripping over her stupidly long dress in the process.The hostess wove through tables, finally stopping in front of one in the middle of the room.Carrigan would have preferred something a little more private.As it was, the place was packed even for a Saturday night and her skin twitched at the feel of peoples eyes on her, real or imagined.To distract herself, she focused on the man sitting at the table.He grinned at her like hed just won the lottery, revealing teeth that were too white and straight to be real.It took her a full five seconds to realize he wasnt going to stand or try to get her chair.Every single man in her family would have done it, from her father down to No, she wasnt thinking about Devlin right now.She needed to be strong and have her walls firmly in place in order to deal with this prospective husband.Carrigan sank into the seat across from himand he still didnt say anything.To buy herself time, she glanced at the menu.She wasnt opposed to driving the conversation, but this was passing strange and shooting straight into Looking Glass territory.A waiter appeared at her elbow, and she set the menu down.Before she could speak, Chauncy cut in.Shell have a Riesling, and Ill have scotchthe most expensive you have.She barely tolerated wine as it was, and she despised white wine.Especially sweet white wine.The waiter nodded and moved off, and Chauncy took that as his cue to actually speak to her.Youre just as beautiful as your father promised.A little thicker than Id like, but there are personal trainers for that kind of thing.Carrigan stared, too shocked to be pissed.He was no prize, his skin too orangey from excessive tanning, his teeth too perfect, his comb over not doing a single thing to hide the fact he was balding.He was carting around a thick middle that was more barrel than six pack, and he was going to criticize her body?She took a sip of water, more to buy herself time than because she was thirsty.What was she supposed to say?Half a dozen careful responses flitted through her mind, but what came out of her mouth wasnt anywhere near polite.With all due respect, I dont know if Id be willing to take personal trainer recommendations from you.He turned a mottled shade of red.You have a mouth on you.But then he smiled.Good.I like them spirited.Good lord, she could actually feel her blood pressure rising by the second.She wasnt a horse to be broken.The waiter appeared with their drinks, and she gulped hers down, doing her best to ignore the sticky sweetness clinging to the back of her tongue.So, Chauncy, you invest in real estate?Maybe if she could get him talking about himself, hed stop saying things that made the hair on her arms stand on end.Yep.Us Chauncers have an eye for a good investment, especially when theres land attached to it.He chuckled like hed made a witty joke.Dont you worry your pretty head, my dearI have more than enough money to keep you decked out in diamonds and whatever you could possibly want.Carrigan finished her wine and resigned herself to a hellish evening.Once Chauncy got talking, he didnt shut up.Part of her was grateful she wasnt expected to do more than make inquiring and agreeing noises when he paused for breath, but the misogynistic comments he kept tossing her way made it hard to keep the bland expression on her face.By the time he told the waiter that no one at their table needed dessert, she was ready to throw her drink in his face.Hell, she would have, but the Riesling had stopped tasting like shit two glasses ago, and she was loath to waste good alcohol on a pathetic excuse for a man like Chauncy.She pushed to her feet after he paid the bill, doing her best to ignore the head rush that accompanied the movementand Chauncys hand touching the small of her back.When James did that, it made her want to arch into his touch like a cat demanding to be stroked.With Chauncy, all she wanted was a bleach bath.They made their way back to the entrance, and she used the excuse of putting on her coat to create some distance between them.Hed apparently decided he approved of her, though, because he was hot on her heels when she hit the door.Carrigan.She gritted her teeth and turned, an unforgivably weak gasp flying from her lips when he grabbed her arm and pulled her close.She smelled the scotch on his breath a second before he kissed her.She went completely still, her mind buzzing with white noise at how wrong this was.He forced his tongue into her mouth, licking her teeth.That snapped Carrigan out of it.She pushed on his shoulders, trying to get some distance between them.Despite being on the soft side, Chauncy held her against him with apparent ease.Stop panicking and think, damn it.She willed her body to go soft, letting him back her against the wall.Then she kneed him in the balls as hard as she could.He went down like a chopped tree, making a high pitched noise that was far more satisfying than it should have been.She gasped out a breath of air that felt a thousand times fresher than it had been when she walked out onto the sidewalk.This piece of shit thought he could put his hands on her?How many women had he tried this with before?She went cold at the thought.Not every woman was capable of defending herself, especially against a large man.Bastard.She used her toe to tip him onto his back and glared down.Im only going to say this once, you piece of shit.You touch meor any other unwilling womanagain, and Ill take great pleasure in slitting your throat while you sleep.She stepped over his writhing body and looked up to find Liam in the middle of running toward her.I have it taken care of.He ran a hand over his short dark hair.I can see that.Thank God, because she was doing everything in her power to hold it together.She lifted her chin.Shall we?Liam jumped to it, ushering her to the car.Only when he put it in drive did she finally lean back against the seat and give in to the shakes.Shed been in shitty positions before, but this seemed so much worse.Maybe it was because of her circumstances.It didnt really matter.All that did matter was scrubbing away the memory of his hands on her body and his tongue in her mouth as quickly as humanly possible.Before she could think too much into it, she reached for her phone.It barely rang once when James answered.Did you miss me, lovely?She knew she should play coy and keep the minuscule distance between them from shrinking any further, but she just didnt have it in her tonight.I need you.*** James had thought hed imagined the fear in Carrigans voice when she called.If she was in actual trouble, she sure as hell wasnt going to call himno matter how much he liked the idea of being the one to swoop in and save her from her problems.He liked the idea too much.But then she walked into the quiet little pub where he was waiting, and he realized he hadnt been wrong the first time.There were faint bruises beneath her eyes, like shed been sleeping even less than he had, and she held herself like a woman whod been beaten for the first time.He was on his feet before he made a conscious decision to move.Who hurt you?No one.Dont play that martyr bullshit with me, Carrigan.Who the fuck put that look on your face?Shed gone through hell and back because of him and it hadnt put that haunted expression in her green eyes.He clenched his fists, trying and failing to get control of his temper.She wasnt his to protect.Hell, even if she was, he had a pretty shitty track record of keeping people in his care safe.There was no reason why shed be any different.Except that he wanted her to be different.She brushed past him, drawing his attention to her clothing.What the hell are you wearing?Carrigan spun and glared.I dont need your shit right now.You called me, lovely, so my shit is exactly what youre going to get.She looked like an angelone that had had its wings clipped.He wasnt sure what gave him that impression, but the long white dress was opposite of everything hed found the woman to be in the short time theyd known each other.She was wild and impulsive and free.She wasntthis virginal almost bride.He didnt like the change.He didnt like it one bit.Sit your ass down.Ill get us drinks, and then youre telling me what the fuck is going on.Hold your breath on that.He wouldnt have to.She might be prickly as all get out, but she wanted to talk.She wouldnt have called him otherwise.The bartender met him halfway, a nervous little mouse of a guy.James made an effort to speak softly because the man looked half a second from pissing himself.Whiskey for me.Dirty martini for the lady.Yes, sir, right away, sir.Hed known there was a decent chance hed be recognized here on the outskirts of Halloran territory, but short of dragging Carrigan out of Boston, there werent many options.So James slipped the guy a few hundred bucks.For your discretion.He let a little threat into his voice.Of course.Satisfied that the bartender wouldnt go telling tales, he made his way back to where Carrigan had picked a booth.Ignoring the empty side, he slid in next to her.Whats going on?She didnt look up.What makes you think somethings going on?How about because you wont meet my eyes for the first time since we met?Or thisI dont even know what to call this getup.He tugged on the white fabric pooled on the booth seat between them.Her green eyes flashed, a welcome show of anger.Theres nothing wrong with the way I dress.Youre right.This isnt you.This is some scared virgin whos looking for her white knight.If Ive learned anything from our time together, its that youd have no problem slaying dragons on your own.Her mouth formed a little O of surprise, but she recovered quickly enough.You dont know me.Not nearly as well as I want to, no.But you dont grow up the way we did without learning to read a person.The bartender appeared with their drinks, and James waited for him to scurry away before he spoke again.Talk to me.I cant help you if I dont know whats wrong.No one can help me.She didnt say it like it upset hermore like it was a truth of her life that shed come to terms with years ago.It made his chest ache.Carrigan took a long drink of her martini.Im almost thirty.He blinked.Whats that got to do with anything?Biology, my dear Watson.How in Gods name can I pop out half a dozen kids if Im past the age of safely being able to do so.There was so much wrong with what she just said that he didnt know where to start.So James just went with the first thing he thought of.Do you want kids?She froze with her drink halfway to her mouth and slowly set it back down.You know, I dont think anyones ever asked me that before.The raw pain in her voice made him want to comfort her, but that was one skill James had never learned.Maybe if his mother had livedbut there was no room in this world for what if and maybe.So he did the one thing that he knew how to do.The single thing guaranteed to distract her.He kissed her.Carrigan went rigid for half a second, but he waited, his lips on hers, and let her choose.That hesitation was all it took for her to melt, turning to fire in his arms.He wanted to haul her against him, to let this feeling consume him until none of the bullshit mattered anymore.Right now, in this moment, there was only her.They could be the last two people in the world for all he gave a fuck.Hell, part of him hoped they were.As her tongue stroked his, a small, treacherous thought wormed into his brain and took root.With this woman by my side, Id be content to let the rest of the world burn.Nine Yes, this, this is what I need.Carrigan twined her arms around Jamess neck, trying to get closer.Every second he spent kissing her, the memory of Chauncys wormy lips on hers moved a little farther away.She pulled back enough to say, Touch me.For a second, she thought he might tell her no, but then he shifted, lifting her into his lap and scooting closer to the wall.To the shadows.His big body dwarfed hers, his arms easily cradling her against his chest.The position was all wrong to ease the aching between her thighs, but it would do.For now.She kissed him again needing the escape it seemed only he could give her.He sank his hands into her hair, tipping her head back and devouring her mouth as if it was the best thing hed ever tasted.She could feel him hard beneath her ass, and she rolled her hips, wishing this booth was somewhere more private.He must have been thinking the same thing, because he rested his forehead against hers.As much as Im enjoying this, lovely, Im not about to fuck you in this booth, and if we dont stop, thats exactly whats going to happen.That didnt sound like a bad thing, which just proved that she was out of her damn mind.She shivered, her hands compulsively clenching his hair.He closed his eyes and growled, so she did it again.Carrigan Take me somewhere.Anywhere, just as long as it meant she didnt have to come back down from the contact high his mouth gave her.Reality could wait.Right now she wanted an escape more than she wanted anything else in this world.Again, there was that hesitation, like he thought he should refuse her.Shed never taken James for a gentleman, but that was the feeling she got when he looked at her with those pale blue eyes that were like the hottest fire.He caught her chin in a painless, unforgiving grip.Ill give you what you want, what we both wanton one condition.You tell me what the fuck happened tonight.She didnt want to.Hed chased the memory away, and she didnt want to do anything to bring it back to the forefront of her mind.And definitely not to confess it to this man.But who else could she tell?Teague?If he knew, itd only make his guilt worse.Or hed decide to put everything hed worked so hard for in jeopardy by doing something unforgivable to Chauncy.
