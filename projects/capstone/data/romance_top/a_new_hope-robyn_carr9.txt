Not to live a fulfilling life and also make good music.And Ginger, he said, causing her to turn back to him.Im really sorry about the way things turned out.You were great.Im sorry about your baby.Your baby.It was tempting to correct him, remind him it was his baby.Except really, it wasnt.I gotta remember that, he said.Im creating relationships with the people I play for.Im feeling the emotion.Like method acting, thatll work.She just nodded once and left.When she got to the door of the caf she turned to look at him and he was already on his cell phone.He was no doubt calling one of his many contacts to explain how he was now putting all his passion and energy into his music without worrying about fame...* * * It surprised Ginger how tired she was after a meeting with Mick that didnt even last an hour.She was back in Thunder Point before five, just in time to help Grace bring in the sidewalk displays.It took quite a bit longer than usual because Grace was bristling with curiosity about Gingers meeting with Mick.Throughout the tale Grace let her indignation fly with comments like, Youve got to be kidding me!and Unbelievable!and finally, Man, youre lucky you escaped!True, Ginger said.Mick and I have nothing in common.But Grace, who knowshe might really take to fame and fortune.Hes pretty shallow.A lot of attention works for Mick.Hell never know, Grace said.Trust me.Ive been in the trials where being first is everything.You know what?People think its luck.And theyre right.Its down to luck after youve done everything humanly possible to sharpen your skill, after youve put in more work and time than anyone else, after youve established you have the greatest talent and sacrificed everything else for that one goal.Then its luck and timing.And then youll know if it makes you happy.I already know it wouldnt make me happy, Ginger said.Didnt for me, either.Im happier in this little shop with my hottie schoolteacher than I ever was in competition.And thats why theres chocolate and vanilla.Because we all need different things.Ginger grabbed herself a to go burger from the diner, opened a bottle of red wine and looked forward to an evening in her little hideawayalone.After half a burger and one glass of wine, she just reclined on the couch and let her eyes close.She awoke to the twittering of her phone and sat up with a start.Matt, she thought.He called every night even though he was so tired.It was pitch black out.She grabbed for the phone and checked the time.It was so late for him to call; it was after ten.He must be exhausted.Matt, she said, answering.Ginger, are you out this evening?Huh?Out?No, Im home.I fell asleep on the couch.I mustve been I knocked.I called and I knocked.You...?It took her a second and then with a cry she jumped off the couch and ran to her back door, throwing it open.And then she threw herself into his arms.Oh, God, its so late!Its not the weekend!What are you doing here?I stole a night, he said, burying his face in her neck.Lets not talk too much.Lets just make love.Good idea.Weve had enough talks for a while.I need a shower, he said.Then I need you.She ran her fingers through his hair.It was getting too long and it made her smile.Then lets not waste a minute.In the end she shared his shower, helped dry him off while he dried her and then fell into bed with him.Oh, how shed missed him!They hadnt been together since Portland and even though they had talked, they had both needed thislove that was kind and happy and filled with tenderness.His touch was gentle yet fiery and she responded as though this man was made for her.He whispered words of love that brought tears to her eyes.As she lay satisfied in his arms, gently touching his stubbled cheeks, she whispered, The grapes let you go?For a little while.Im going home to check on a few things at the farm, then right back to the vineyard.Another few days and our work with Sal will be done and well start picking in the orchard.On the weekends, in most cases three day weekends, our cousins will help.Dysart trucks will be parked on our land for three weeks, loaded with pears.Can I come?If you want to, if you feel up to it.Its hard work.But you have women helping?A few sisters, sisters in law and quite a few teenagers who look at it as a way to earn extra money.The temperatures are dropping.Dad and I will stand watch, in case we have to put out smudge pots, but the forecast is good.Will I be in the way?Tell the truth...Ill take care of you, he said.Ill make sure you know what youre doing, that you dont feel awkward.Maybe you want to ask Peyton if shes coming?I will.I cant believe you snuck away!He kissed her temple.In a couple of days, when I leave the farm to go back to the vineyard, Ill be back.Id rather spend the night with you than some hairy legged cousin who snores and farts in his sleep.The only problem is, I have to leave so early.Before sunrise.Ill take anything I can get.He squeezed her.He didnt ask about the phone call, about Mick.She had already decided she would never lie to him.But on that night, so rare and unexpected, she didnt bring it up.She only loved him with every fiber of her being.* * * Two nights later when he snuck back into her bed during the hours of darkness, he did ask.They lay naked, tangled in each others arms and legs, and she hoped he didnt feel her grow tense.If he became angry or upset, it would spoil everything and all she wanted was to be like this with him, trusting and confident of his love.I talked to him.He was so pathetic and wimpy on the phone I started to worry he might be sick.Maybe dying!I agreed to meet him for coffee in North Bend.I thought Id better, just for my peace of mind, in case he died or something and my last words were hateful.But hes fine.He wanted my opinion on his career strategy.Matt rose up on an elbow and looked down at her.Youre making this up.She shook her head.And did you give him advice?I did.I told him that as long as he applied all his attention to being a huge success and none to being a good musician, a good man, he wasnt likely to ever make it.And I suggested that all his bragging and name dropping could be counterproductive.I also told him never to call my mother again because my brothers really want to beat him up and maybe break his jaw and that could impede his meteoric rise to fame and fortune.To her great relief, he grinned.Meteoric, huh?I said it with a great deal of kindness, she said, smiling at him.Im sure you did.He brushed her pretty hair away from her face.I take it he didnt upset you.She shrugged.Only in the usual way.Those regrets, you know.You have nothing to regret, he said.Oh, I didnt do bad things.I just wish Id never been so foolish, so naive.I really have nothing in common with him.I couldve started picking pears instead and found the man of my dreams long before now.You have things in common with me then?he asked, twirling a little hair around his finger.Everything, though its hard to think about practical things when were naked together.When were naked all I can think about is how well we come together, like I was born for this, to be with you.But when I have my clothes on and can think straight, I realize we like the same things, want the same things.I have no trouble imagining why you love your work, why you love all that dirt and manure...That interfering family?he asked.I get the impression from Georges wife that she makes sure she gives them plenty of respect and attention but she runs her own home, Ginger said.She has a career.She looked away.I wont ever have a career, you know.I have some regrets about that, too.He kissed her nose.Be yourself, Ginger.Youre perfect the way you are.She smiled at him.I am good with the flowers.So Ive noticed.He rolled with her until she was on top of him.And youre good with me.You think so, do you?Oh, yes.You get right into my head and wont leave.Oh, dearIm a nag.He slapped her on the rump.I like it, I think.He pulled her mouth down to his.He moved his hips beneath her.Nag me a little more now.Before I have to leave you again.She played with his hair, which had grown and begun to curl.Somethings different about you.Im tired, he said with a laugh.Nothings different.Especially the way you rejuvenate me.In the predawn when he was leaving her, she clung to him.I hope we can make things work, Matt.I love you so.Dont worry about anything.Were going to make it perfect.* * * Something was different with Matt.Thank the grapeshours of hard work with very little interaction gave a man time to think things through.Hed been there before.In fact, it wasnt that long ago when he was trying to figure out if it would be safe to let himself fall in love with Ginger.Hed gathered his answers while he worked, silent and introspective.But while he was communing with the grapes, he was careful not to withdraw from her.That had been his mistake the first time hed sought insight in his crops.This time he had called her at the end of every day.He was going to remember thatyour woman needs to be talked to and touched every day.When your woman feels youre moving away, she feels abandoned and alone.And she changes her phone number.She wanted to marry him but couldnt be wed to his anger.Well, Basque men were a little on the passionate and possessive side and if they got mad, look out.Even sweet old Paco, who had held ten grandchildren on his lap, had his days.Hed had one yesterday, as Matt remembered with a smile.Something had gone wrong with Sals grape harvester and holy shit, Paco was livid.It passed pretty quickly.That was the other thing about men in their family.That flame would go up fast and hot and then it was over.Doused.Reference an ice bucket on Matts head at Peytons wedding.And aside from some occasional grumbling over the years, Paco had never turned his anger on his wife.His grown sons had been the recipients here and there, but again, once the anger was expressed Paco could move on.Matt made a resolution.He would go outside, turn on the hose and drench his head before he would ever again turn that black mood he was capable of on his woman.She must never fear or hate him.Ginger was the kindest, most selfless woman hed ever known.She was so beautiful in her heart.If his words ever touched her with anything less than the purest love, he would be completely ashamed.They could start with love and trust and go from there.In the spirit of trust, he would do those things Ginger asked him to do.He wasnt sure they would work worth a damn, but if it showed her he was really making every effort, maybe she would be more patient with him.And if he could bite off that temper and she could be more patient, he couldnt think of anything standing in their way.Therefore, he was not going home to dig out the smudge pots or check the fruit, although he would, since he was there.He was going home to work through Gingers checklist.A New Hope        Eighteen What has your interest so completely?Winnie asked Lin Su.She turned toward Winnie.Come and see, she said.Here, let me help you up.You should take a few steps anyway.They made their way together, clumsily but efficiently, to the deck rail.Below them on the beach were two beach chairs under a beach umbrella.Frank sat in one, Charlie in the other, each holding their laptops on their knees.Dueling computers, Lin Su said.What do you suppose theyre doing?Winnie asked.Lord only knows.Charting solar systems for all I know.Charlies laptop is far less sophisticated than Franks, but when they sit side by side like that, Frank turns his screen to show Charlie everything interesting hes looking at.Hes researching for a paper he has to write when he gets back to MIT.Hes a genius.I think Charlie might be a genius, as well, Winnie said.Nah, Lin Su said.Hes very smart, though.Much of that comes from the fact that he was housebound so much as a little kid.We found all kinds of educational programs for him.It took his mind off not being able to run and play with the other kids.We?Winnie asked.Huh?Oh, me and anyone interested, friends or babysitters.Sometimes other nurses or doctors where I was working.A couple of times I had home healthcare patients who encouraged him.He got that laptop from one of my patients when he upgraded his own and gave Charlie the castoff.Its been a lifesaver.Weve been looking at new models together, Winnie informed her.You mustnt do that, Winnie.That computer works very well.Its got a couple more years in it, for sure.Its purely selfish, I assure you, she said, turning from the rail to go back to her chair.I have my assistant, Virginia, still managing my affairs in San Francisco.Ive accustomed myself to giving her instructions and projects and then she reports to me.The only thing Ive ever bothered with is opening her attachments and looking at what shes done.But Charlie has me going all over the internet, looking at things.Ive had to borrow Graces laptop a few timesits more sophisticated than mine.I want to sit with Charlie, our computers in front of us.Lin Su helped her into her chair.Youre not going to see quite as much of him when school starts in a few weeks.I have a few ideas about that, as well.Are you satisfied with his educational program?In what way?Do you like his school?Its a perfectly good public school, she said.Charlie started there last year.Was he satisfied?With his studies, I believe so.He didnt complain about the work and he had a lot of homework.He got straight As, of course.He always has.Was the rest of his experience good?What do you mean?Lin Su asked.You know perfectly well what I mean.Hes not as robust as other boys his age, though I have to say, a month or so on the beach seems to have given him more color, more stamina.I think we may be in for a growth spurt.So, back to the subject.Does Charlie have good friends at school?He has a few.And if youre asking if he has conflict from time to time, the answer is yes.I think all small boys in thick glasses have those struggles, which is why I wont allow things like Facebook.Ive heard too many horror stories.I think it makes sense for him to consider a change.You should discuss it with him.His opinion counts the most, I think.Butyou come to work here every morning and leave every evening.Its convenient.More importantif Thunder Point can produce an MIT scholarship student they deserve more credit than Ive given them.But WinnieI work here.I dont live here.Ive spoken with Troy.Charlie would be allowed to attend based on that fact.Now, before you want to discuss that this employment is at best temporary let me suggest that my time might not be as short as people think.Thats my expert opinion.Lin Su smiled at her.And would you mind explaining your wonderful theory?Not at all.Im trying to catch up with my daughter after years of bossing her around and making her do everything that was important to me rather than what was important to her.Im making great progressI think shes starting to actually like me, hard as I make it sometimes.Thats one reason.Another reasonshes carrying my grandchild.Im not giving up a chance to know that baby without a fight.I might die, but itll be heel marks all the way.And three, I might miss my old body and find the handicaps that come with ALS to be perfectly terrible, but I can cope as long as I have my mind.And by God, I have it.I think the lot of you should be warnedI might hang around for the next two grandchildren.And Charlies graduation from Harvard.Lin Su smiled at her.I agree, stubbornness has played a crucial role in life expectancy.There was the sound of footsteps on the stairs and the women stopped talking.Charlie came onto the deck first, Frank right behind him.Charlie plopped his backpack on a deck chair.I gotta get my Nikes, he said, running through the house and out to the car where he kept extra clothes and necessities.Hi, Frank, Lin Su said with a smile.How are you?Good.Excellent.Im going to take Charlie up on that ridge and show him the flora and where we go to watch whales.I wont be here when they migrate in a couple of months, but I can show him the spot.The ridge?Lin Su said.The flora?The whales?Yes, maam, Frank replied.There are bugs up there.Pollen.Bees and plants he hasnt been around.He has a lot of allergies.And asthma.Charlie was back, sitting down to put his shoes on.Well go slow.If I get out of breath, well stop, he said.But is this a good idea?Youve been doing so well!Why tempt fate?Lin Su said.Because tempting fate is fun, Charlie replied.Do you have your Inhaler and EpiPen?Do you ever get tired of asking me that?You think I want to blow up like a blowfish right before I die?If he has to even pull the inhaler or EpiPen out of his pocket, Ill bring him back off the ridge.But insect life is dying off up there with the cooler temperatures and the bloom has died down.But there are still some great species to see.Plus its a good steady hike and an amazing view.Ill be fine, Charlie said.Of course you will, Winnie agreed.Have your cell phone?What am I going to do if I wheeze up there?Call home?I just wanted you to take a few pictures if you see anything interesting.It could be a while till I get up on that ridge to see for myself.Right, Charlie said, grinning.Then without any further conversation, he was scrambling down the stairs.Dont worry, Frank said.He put his backpack on the chair beside Charlies.Can I leave this here?Sure, Lin Su said.Please be careful.We will, but its not dangerous.Its a path, thats all.He gets shots, he said.He shouldnt have any problems.When Lin Su was alone with Winnie again, she sat down a little weakly.You should have that conversation with Charlie about going to school out here.He needs a little more freedom, a little challenge.He has plenty of freedom!Lin Su snapped.Ive been leaving him alone while I work for the last two years.And I bet its driven you crazy.It would be better if he had a little more freedom while youre nearby to nag him constantly.Lin Su scowled.I think it might be time for your nap, Mrs.Banks.Winnie laughed.Not on your life.* * * Grace was amused by the amount of entertainment Winnie was getting out of her new friend Charlie.Any other daughter mightve been jealous, but Grace was pleased.Charlie took some of the heat off her, absorbing all of Winnies opinions and objections and interfering.And because Winnie wasnt his mother, he could take them in stride and dismiss them.So, the dinner table was occupied with animated conversation about Charlies trek up on the ridge with Frank.He took a lot of pictures with his cell phone and, he announced triumphantly, he had not wheezed or had any allergic reactions.Grace had brought home a pan of Carries lasagna, garlic bread and salad, what she called a perfect Winnie dinner.Anything Winnie could stab with a fork or lift with her trembling fingers worked very well for her.I used to have a chef, you know, Winnie said to Charlie.And guess what?It wasnt any better than this.Isnt having a chef kind of like someone elses mother making dinner?Charlie asked.Not quite as good as that, Grace said.Chefs are more in love with the art of their flavors and their presentation than what you really like.I asked for mashed potatoes for years but they didnt come into fashion until a few years ago.I love mashed potatoes, Charlie said.Then the next time Carrie has meat loaf and mashed, its yours, Grace said.I love mashed potatoes, too!Whats your favorite, Lin Su?Oh, this is amazing, she said, taking a bite.Mom doesnt like dinner that much, Charlie said.She usually isnt hungry and maybe has a bowl of cereal before bed.You cook just for Charlie?Grace asked.Sure.He is always hungry.I make all his favorites and I freeze meal size portions.Sometimes I have what hes having, but hes right, sometimes I just want a snack.Do mashed potatoes freeze?Grace asked.They sure do.Youd be surprised the things you can freeze.Mom will freeze one asparagus spear, Charlie said, shoveling lasagna in his mouth.Thats not so, Lin Su said with a laugh.But I dont waste.And when Im cleaning up your kitchen, neither do you!she said.Then she stood and started picking up plates.Charlie, when youre done there, will you help?Sure, he said, gobbling two last bites.Ill help, Troy said.Charlie looks like he might need a second helping.Hiking up to the ridge is hard work.And I think Ill get ready for bed, Winnie said.Somehow I missed my nap.Yes, I wonder how, Lin Su said, letting Troy take on kitchen duties so she could take Winnie to her bedroom.Once Winnie had washed up, changed and was settled in bed with the TV on, Lin Su made sure her few evening chores were done.There was a little laundry to fold but she would put it away the next day.She gave the bathroom a quick clean, checked to make sure the extra lasagna and bread were properly stowed and gave the kitchen floor a once over.The rest of the family was out on the deck with Charlie, watching the sunset over the bay.Im ready to leave, unless anyone needs anything, Lin Su announced to the gathering.Im taking walk on beach before bed, Mikhail said, rising from his chair.No one needs anything more, Lin Su, Grace said.Thank you for everything and Ill probably see you when I get home from the shop tomorrow.Good.Let me know if you want me to come up with dinner.Ill text you in the morning after I check out Carries specials.Have a good evening.Charlie dragged himself up from his chair and followed his mother out to the car.He slumped back in the seat, worn out from yet another busy day filled with fresh air, sun and exercise.I want to ask you something, Lin Su said.Would you like to go to Thunder Point High when school starts?He straightened instantly.Could I?Troy seems to think you could, based on my work location and schedule.But Charlie, I dont know that itll be better.You could have issues there, as well.I could, but I know people there.I wouldnt be the nerdy strange kid who popped in from out of town.Troy and Spencer are friends.Iris and Seth are friends.Um, I mean Mr.Headly, Mr.Lawson, Mrs.Sileski and Deputy Sileski.Then he grinned.She laughed.He might not be big but he sure was good looking.Soyou like that idea?I love that idea.Can you do that?Does it cost anything?Its public school.And they have a chess club.Cool.Yeah, Id do that in a heartbeat.But what about...you know...Winnie?She thinks shes going to last a long time and I wouldnt be surprised, but we know the realityher disease doesnt promise long term survival.We could have to make another change.I get that.But Id do anything to live in Thunder Point!I know its nice, Charlie.But there isnt anything I can afford in that town.But I could go to school there for a while.You could, I guess.But youd have to remember, it could be temporary.Mom.Everything could be temporary.* * * Grace was just about to close the doors to the deck when she noticed something.She went over to one of the chairs and lifted Charlies backpack.Uh oh, she said.Look what he forgot.He might make his mother come back for it.Im going to run over to Spencers.Hes hooking up the automatic garage door and I said Id help, Troy said.And you think youre the man for that job?Try not to damage my manhood.I do many manly things.I have my own tool belt.She laughed, but then she kissed him.All right, then.Im going to run this over to Lin Sus.She said she lives about fifteen minutes away.Ill get the address from Winnie and take the Jeep.By the time youre done with Spencer Ill be back.Grace put the address in her phone before leaving the garage and watched as the directions were calculated.It was calculated as farther than a fifteen minute drive, but she dismissed that.Shed beat the GPS at its own game in the past with some clever shortcuts.In fact, she enjoyed that challenge.She wouldnt try it tonight, however.Shed play it safe.She drove through the south part of Bandon and then east toward Coquille.She passed a barbed wire encircled industrial lot where construction equipment seemed to be stored.Guard dogs patrolled inside the fence, an eerie sight.Nearby, there were storage lockers of the large, commercial capacity.A convenience store and bar were on the corner across the street from a run down apartment complex.Customers were spilling out onto the street with their drinks in front of the bar.A bunch of teenagers were hanging out in the parking lot and a police car was parked nearby, an officer in the front seat.On the other side of the convenience store was a motel.The vacancy sign was flashing, missing the V.  She passed through a sparse neighborhood comprised of old houses, crossed some railroad tracks, made a few turns and assumed she was leaving the populated area for the more rural area.Then the nice GPS lady informed her that her destination was on the right and she noticed the entrance to a trailer park.There was an outdoor lavatory attached to a small Laundromat.There were exactly two security lights shining down on maybe twenty trailers of various models.Among the mobile homes was an old Airstream, a few fifth wheels, a couple of abandoned trailers.The ground was dirt and a couple of trailers seemed to be well lit with outdoor lights for the purposes of beer drinking gatherings or home auto and motorcycle mechanics.There was a police car at the far end of the one street park.Two officers were cuffing a couple of men who wore jeans and leather jackets and looked dangerous to Grace.She spotted Lin Sus car sitting next to a very small fifth wheel with one dim light shining inside.It was more of a little camper.The car was parked very close to the single door.And in the yard between Lin Sus trailer and a mobile home a man and woman who appeared to be drunk were having a very loud, very angry argument.The manwho, Grace noted the ironywore a wife beater T shirt and was gesturing at the woman with his beer bottle.The woman wore a bathrobe.And the only vehicle at that residence was an old truck up on blocks.The squad car was now moving toward Grace.There were two officers in the front and two passengers in the back.The driver pulled up next to her and rolled down his window.You looking for someone, maam?I guess Im lost, she said with a nervous giggle.Im going to turn around and reset my GPS.Well, if youre coming to buy something, the drug store is closed.Graces eyes grew round.She swallowed.She drove to the next wide space in the road and maneuvered the Jeep into a U turn.She drove out of the park, slowly.An elderly man was taking a bag of trash out to a silver garbage can that was chained to a post.She noticed that his mobile home had a screened porch and some patio stones forming a walkway to an ancient Oldsmobile.The place wasnt a complete ghetto and drug haven.But it was poor.Very poor.And there was no place for a boy to play; no beach or park.She had no idea where the school was but if Charlie had to walk there, he would be crossing railroad tracks, industrial parks, storage lockers and passing the convenience store, bar and seedy motel.She stopped at the entrance of the trailer park, made sure her doors were locked and turned on the dome light to program her GPS to take her home, though she was certain she could remember the way.Then she got out of there.She was sure it looked a lot better by the light of day.After all, not having a lot of money was no crime.She even thought about taking a drive out this way the next day to see if her worst instincts were confirmed or if she was just scared of the dark.There was one reality she was certain ofThunder Point didnt look like that after dark.And if there were drug dealers in town, they were very well hidden.And domestic disputes?Seth hated them, but he took actionno one was waving beer bottles around, yelling at each other in their yards.When she got home, she dropped Charlies backpack on one of the dining room chairs.Grace?her mother called.She went to her mothers bedroom.Lin Su phoned, Winnie said.She wanted me to know Charlie left his backpack behind and that theyd catch up with it in the morning.I told her you were taking it to him.I got lost, Grace said.Rather than hunting in the dark, I just gave up.Would you like me to call her and tell her not to watch for me?I can do it, Winnie said.Good.His backpack is on the dining room chair.Tell her Im sorry she was waiting for me.I made a couple of wrong turns and got frustrated, not knowing where I was going, so I just came home.I figured by the time I got straightened out Charlie would be in bed anyway.She faked a yawn.Which is where Im going.Is Mikhail going to watch television with you tonight?I imagine so.Hes gone upstairs to get into his comfortable pants and slippers.Im going to lock up and go to bed.I thought we never locked anything, Winnie said.Tonight Im locking up.Because...uh, because I usually forget but tonight I remembered.Good night, Mama.Downstairs in the quarters she shared with her husband she told him about her little adventure.Its probably not nearly as bad as it looked, but my first thought wastheyre very vulnerable living in a seedy neighborhood in a trailer that can barely keep the wind out.I dont know how to handle that.I cant stand to think they might be at risk.Either of them.Lin Sus a single woman and Charlie is a small boy.Why dont you give me that address.Ill drive over that way and look around, see where the schools are, what the neighborhoods look like in the light of day, just kind of see if Id live there.My apartment wasnt exactly high rent.We live in a million dollar house, she reminded him.We might not be the most objective.Well, Winnie lives in a house that cost a million plus and we live with Winnie.I grew up the son of a teacher and a city maintenance worker.Our neighborhood was safe and clean but it wasnt exactly chi chi.Then he laughed.* * * The next day at about noon Troy wandered into the flower shop.He said hello to Ginger then invited Grace to walk down to the deli with him to check out the days specials.Then Ill know if I have to make a store run before dinner.Once they were outside he fessed up.I went to look around Lin Sus neighborhood.It was pretty well balanced between little old people on fixed incomes without a lot to spare, some unemployed, some down on their luck and some real badasses.I dont know how it looked in the dark but it was pretty tame in the light of day.Id live there, but Id have a baseball bat under my bed.Oh, Troy.I even talked to a couple of folks.They were elderly.I said I was looking for something for my sister to rent and asked if a single woman would feel safe there.One old guy said there was a single nurse in the park and he looked out for her.Hed be just as willing to look out for my sister.That was nice.Not that he could, however.Look after anyone.This old guy was no Rawley, if you get my drift.They sell drugs in that trailer park!Grace said in a heated whisper.And what is this business about her eating cereal at night?Shes always had a perfectly good appetite around here.I think shes saving real food for Charlie.Maybe she has debt, Troy said with a shrug.Im no stranger to debt.Listen, I think this can be remedied, he said.I think it would be best if youd be chairman of this project.Winnie would just offend Lin Su by not approving of her residence and try to give her something.Hell, Im sure Lin Su doesnt approve of her own residence, but she has to live tight and she has pride.I think theres probably a solution in Thunder Point.Lets start by getting her committed to letting Charlie go to school here.Then we can look around for something affordable.It wont be fancy but I dont think shes looking for fancy.One step at a time, okay?Can you try to be patient?I can try, Grace said.I didnt sleep well last night.Could you maybe loan her a baseball bat or something?Shes a survivor, Grace.She knows its a bad neighborhood.Shes raised a sick kid on a nurses salary without any family support.Shes had to be a survivor and she can take care of herself.Dont offend her.Lets just see if we can throw some better options her way.But you have to go slowly.Right.Slow.Not my favorite speed.I know, honey.* * * Charlie waited on the stairs near the beach, backpack beside him.Frank finally came into sight.He hadnt seen Frank in three days.When he got close, Charlie stood.He pushed his glasses up on his nose and Frank mimicked the gesture with a grin.Frank wore his glasses instead of his contacts on the beach because of the wind and sand.Except that when Frank did it, he didnt look like a little nerd.He looked more like Clark Kent.Whereve you been, man?Charlie asked.Mostly hanging out with Ashley, bud.Gals before pals, pardner.Whats up?Ive been waiting to tell you.Im going to Thunder Point High this year.At least while my mom works for Winnie, which I hope will be a long time, but its not supposed to be.Fantastic.I think.Did your mom make that happen?Nah.My mom would never ask for anything.Winnie suggested it, since I come over with her every day.And Troy said it wouldnt be a problem because of her job.Ive been dying to tell you.I didnt want to freak out my mom but Im really glad to get out of that other school.Charlie, youve got my number.If you want to hang out just call me.Or text me.Dont sit around waiting.I figured you were busy, he said shyly.I was.But not too busy for a call or a text.Lets establish something, Charlie.You have any questions or run into any trouble at school, get in touch with me right away.What good will that do?Youll be at college!I still know people, he said confidently.I still have a brother at Thunder Point.Hes a good guy.When it comes to problems at school, especially if youre picked on, you gotta let someone know.I know people, too, Charlie said.Good.Troy and Spencer are both good to know.And there are tricks, like making yourself indispensable as a tutor.But whatever you do, dont try to outrun it or fix it alone.I speak from experience.Charlie gulped.Was it bad?When I was about your age and the smallest kid in the class, it wasnt great.I had to depend on my big brother, the football star.I always resented him, except when I was getting backed into a corner.But then the strangest thing happened...I grew.I used to paddleboard a lot in the summer and I grew shoulders.I woke up one morning and I didnt have to look around to see where my brother was to keep from getting knocked around.He grinned.Ill loan you my younger brother, Lee, yet another athlete.Before I head back east, Ill make sure he knows to introduce himself.As my bodyguard?If you need one, let me know, Frank said.I have a few markers to call in.A New Hope        Nineteen It was only seven in the evening when Matt tapped lightly on Gingers back door.She filled his arms at once.This is what I like, he said.I love to feel you against me.He looked over her shoulder and saw a take out bag on her little table.Oh, honey, you cooked, he joked.You made very good time, she said with a laugh.We could have gone out but I get so little of you these days.I didnt want to share you.She gave his shirt a sniff.Youre clean, she said.I had time for a quick shower before I left the farm.But if you feel like a shower, I can get cleaner.You like that shower business, dont you?Would you like to eat?He nodded.In the bedroom.She grabbed the sack.He grabbed her wrist.We wont need that.I thought you were hungry, she said.Oh, I am.He led her to the bed and got her out of her clothes quickly.He discarded his own and pulled her down on the bed.He began kissing and before long he was making a feast of her entire body, from her lips to her knees.There wasnt a spot he missedthe inside of her elbows, her earlobes, her thighs, her belly and breasts.He finally opened her legs, burying himself in her until she was begging for him to stop.But by that time, hed become famished for more and he fumbled for the condom so he could get inside her.Once there, he remained still and luxuriated in the feel of her.His eyes were closed and there was a smile on his lips.Matt?she whispered.Are you going to fall asleep on me like this?I might, he said.I could stay here forever.This is like home for me.She moved her hips a little.Forever would be too long.It would make walking difficult.Take care of business.He opened his eyes.You do have a bossy side.And a needy side, she said.My aim is to please you, my lovely girl.As he began to move in a way that had become familiar to them, he thought about the great comfort it was to have this kind of lovedependable, trusting, fulfilling, holding such promise for a lifetime of the same.He tasted her on his tongue, filled his head with that special scent of her, a combination of flowers and a musk that intoxicated him and belonged only to this woman, this soft, consuming, perfect woman.He moved rhythmically, deeply, searching for that crazy erotic place deep inside her that awaited him.When he felt that she was getting close, reaching, pushing back, gasping a little in anticipation, he smiled to himself.He knew her body as well as she did, as well as she knew his.And she came, the spasms so hot and tight his vision briefly clouded.And then, giving in to the ache of need, he let go and throbbed with the greatest pleasure hed ever known.When he could unclench his jaw, he covered her mouth in a deep and passionate kiss, licking her lips, sucking on her earlobe, kissing her neck and then her breast.He was made for this, secure in the love of one woman, a woman who knew him and would let him know her completely.He had a strong libido so there had been women, but theyd been so briefly satisfying.What he had with Ginger was different.He was not just in love with her, he was eager to commit his life to her.It felt like the perfect union, like it was meant to be.Hed never had anything like this even when hed been married.Love, he was learning, was deeper and more complex than chemistry, than friendship.It was about the melding of souls.Of trusting someone with your dreams and learning you were safe to do so.They would talk about this again somedayhe and Ginger.This was stuff Ginger already knew and had been trying to explain to him.Ginger had learned this in the same tough, painful way he had.She had learned that she knew everything about Mick, knew and understood his dreams, his strengths and weaknesses.But Mick had known nothing about her.I did something, he whispered to her.I got out of that apartment.In one day?she asked, wide eyed.A little more than that but not much.I made a lot of phone calls, went over there and stuffed my clothes in two big duffels, had everything that wasnt nailed down put in a storage locker.I thought that was logical, in case we want that stuff in our house.But it didnt take me long to change my mind about that.I dont want any of it.When theres time maybe well run an ad and sell it.More likely, though, my brothers or sisters will hear Im not using that sectional or bedroom furniture and borrow it.From that point on we can visit it at one of their houses because Ill never get it back.So it goes in a big family.She laughed.How does it feel?It feels good.It feels really good.I didnt think it would matter so Im a little surprisedthe second that truck unloaded into the storage locker and drove off, I felt so much better.I only did it because you wanted me to.I wasnt convinced it had anything to do with anything.Im appreciative of the things women do to make their houses comfortable, but I dont care about that shit.I think I could live in a cave.But not that cave, she said, playing with his hair.Not that cave, he said.But why not?he asked her.Memories?Im sure there were some, she said.But mostly you didnt really live there.It was even less personal to you than a motel room.You just needed a place to bring the flavor of the week that wasnt under your mothers roof.Huh, he said.By the way, you do know there hasnt been a single flavor since you coldcocked me at my sisters wedding.Shoved, she corrected.I assumed there hadnt been anyone but thanks for telling me that.So, I guess that means were either staying with my parents when I come up to the farm or were bedding down in the back of your truck.I rented us a little something.Its not much.Im not going to tell you anything about it.I want your first reaction to be honest.Its adequatebetter than being in your old bedroom or the truck bed.Its convenient.And private.Is it nice?she asked eagerly.Well, I think so, but youve already seen how wrong I can be about that...It wasnt that apartment that was wrong, Matt.It was you while you were in it that didnt seem right.If youd liked it there, it wouldve shown somehow.Im not sure how, but somehow.I cant wait to see what you came up with for us.There is an us, right?Because youre all I think about.She gave him a kiss.Theres an us, sweetheart.Were just tying up loose ends so our future isnt cluttered with our pasts.Matt had done something about that, too.He just wasnt sure whether it had worked.He had called Dr.Weymouth, the head of the biology department where he occasionally taught.He told him that hed commit to three plant biology labs after the harvest if they needed him.And he also said, Dont wait too long to get your teaching schedule together because Im getting married.Before Christmas, I hope.Matt hoped that news might filter through the biology department.If he knew Natalie at all, it would send up her radar.If that didnt happen, Matt would get in touch with her when he had the time.He left Ginger at four in the morning to drive back to Uncle Sals vineyard for one more weekend with the grapes.He was planning to come back to her Saturday night.When all the uncles and cousins were celebrating and drinking too much wine, dancing and toasting a successful grape harvest, Matt would drive to Ginger.Hed spend Saturday night and most of Sunday before heading back to the farm to get started on the pears.They were ready.* * * Matt had five seasonal hands who worked for him during the pear and potato harvest.First they would bring in the pears, which finished ripening in their shipping crates and gift boxes.They handled them carefully, delivering pristine, smooth and clean fruit to the retailers, from grocers to Harry & David.Then came the potatoes, which were less labor intensive; they were tougher and didnt require gentle handling.Plus, the harvester could dig them and the farm hands would help to separate and bag them.There were two Dysart semi trailers parked on the property behind the barn and house.Richard Dysart had driven them over himself, one at a time.Matt, Paco and Richard took cups of coffee on the porch.Richard asked after Ginger.I spent Sunday with her in Thunder Point, a good day.The weather was excellent and shes in happy spirits, Matt said.Shes planning to come up on Saturday.The rest of the family will be here tomorrow sometime and shes anxious to witness this harvest business that will take every second of my time for weeks.And shes more than a little anxious to experience the food the women will put together.What he didnt share with Richard was that it had been three nights without Ginger beside him and it felt like an eternity.You make a good argument for the Dysart clan to show up to pick pears, Richard said.You are always welcome, Paco said.I warn you, you might never be the same.Nah, Matt said.The pears wont take too much of a toll on you, but if you really want an experience, come up in the spring for the sheep shearing and lambing.Its exhausting.And not just a little dirty.Also parked on the property, on the north side of the house, was an RV.From that spot Matt could see the mountains to the north, the orchard to the east and the plot hed chosen for his house.After the harvest was complete, hed work with the architect to finalize the plans.At the first blush of spring, they could pour a slab, grade a road for construction access that would be followed by a better road for his personal access to his new home.His and Gingers home, he prayed.Hed gone to an RV lot in Portland to look at a couple of rentals, picked the best one and had it driven here.The owners made it available through Thanksgiving.If this worked out, he thought it might be time to buy one of his own.Half the Lacoumette clan had some form of trailerfifth wheel, camper shell, RV or toy hauler.They moved around to each others properties for family events, from weddings to funerals, planting or harvesting, reunions, whatever the call.Paco, not one to spend a dime that hadnt been pried out of his tight fingers, had a fifth wheel that could sleep six, on top of each other at that.It was not comfortable, showering and cooking very limited, but it got them to the vineyard, other family farms or the coast where cousins fishing boats docked.Corinne was not fond of it, to say the least.Before noon tomorrow the trucks, RVs and other vehicles would begin to arrive.He was at the far north end of the orchard, checking trees and fruit for the hundredth time when his phone, turned to walkie talkie mode, sounded off.He heard his mothers voice.Matt.Natalie is here to see you.Ah!So shes heard.He had begun to think he was going to have to seek her out.On my way, he said.He jumped in the Rhino and headed for the house.His mother had left Natalie alone in the yard to wait for him.She had not been happy about the way things had gone with his ex wife.Natalie had a new car and new hair.A BMW?It was a few years old, but still.Things must be going well in the secretarial trade.Or maybe some modeling had kicked in for her.He found himself hoping it had.The new hair was no surpriseit was her signature diversityalways different.Dark auburn this timethat had been one of his favorites.Very sexy, very classy look on her.But what was very new for her, she wore jeans, rolled up at the ankle, and tennis shoes.Usually when she wore jeans they were very tight with boots or heels.She also wore a light windbreaker.This was Natalie at her most practical and casual.He couldnt help but be intrigued.Shed never bothered to dress for the farm before.He approached her and it was instantly apparent that her eyes were glassy.Can we talk?she asked softly.Yes, he said.And he noted her surprise.He hadnt been mean or sarcastic or threatened to call security.Come with me.He reached out and took her hand and led her around the house to the RV.He pulled a couple of canvas lawn chairs from where they were stored beneath the RV and opened them.Have a seat.Whats this?she asked.This is where I live now, he said.You werent at the apartment, she said.How did you know to find me here?he asked.Are you kidding me?Its the harvest!Tomorrow the rest of the family will be here.You were smart to come today, he said, chuckling.What did you want to talk about?I heard youre getting married.Yes, he said.When?she asked.No date yet, but Im hoping we can do it before Christmas.A nice Basque girl?she asked.He grinned and it was wholly genuine.No, a pale, freckly, green eyed girl.I suspect some Irish lingering back there.Natalie looked down into her lap.I wish you the best, she said.Thank you.What did you want to talk about?I wanted to talk about...it.She paused and took a deep breath.Im sorry.I didnt do it to hurt you.Why did you?he asked.Hed asked a hundred times.Well, at least ten.I was afraid.Terrified.Of having a baby?Of having a life I wasnt right for!Of eventually being held captive on a farm with a bunch of kids, shunned by the Basque women because I cant cook or sew or grow anything!Of never having any fun again because your idea of fun and mine were completely opposite and it just felt...She lifted her chin a notch.It felt like the end.To me it felt like the end.But since I did it Ive felt nothing but grief and regret and I dont know how to fix it.I told you not living on the farm was okay, he said.We decided not having a bunch of kids was okay.I said that was my work but didnt have to be yours.You said, but you didnt mean it, she said.You didnt have time for me, for our life.And we were always at the farm for family things, family things all the time.And the family, they made me feel stupid and out of place and awkward.They never liked me.Your words were all about, Its okay, honey, whatever you want, unless I wanted to go dancing or out to dinner or to a party my friends were throwing or to brunch at the Monaco or to a concert at Roys.Does this woman you want to marry by Christmas fit in?Because if she doesnt, you should warn her before she does something that hurts so much.She started to cry.Shes right, he thought.Hed always talked a good game but his life was the farm and the family and he secretly, deep down, thought shed come around.If she never fell in love with his work shed at least fully understand his love of it.He reached over and gave her chair a tug, pulling her closer to him.Come here, he said.Tell me what hurts so much, he asked softly.God, she said.You think I didnt want us to live happily ever after?You think I wanted to have an abortion?I couldnt keep spending Sunday at the farm in my best clothes, my best, the clothes that all the girls on campus envy, only to have your mother and family speak Spanish or whatever that is in the kitchen and laugh, your brothers and their wives shake their heads like I was some stupid child, to have you put me in a firemans carry to get me across the barnyard...She sniffed and wiped at her tears.I thought maybe Id be able to figure it out someday, that maybe it would grow on me and Id start to enjoy the same things, though it wasnt looking good for that.And then what happens?Married less than a year and I get pregnant!He felt his mouth go dry.You couldnt talk to me?he asked.She laughed through her tears.Matt, you always said, okay, fine.Then you did what you wanted.I said those family dinners were awful for me and you said, fine, we wont do so many.And we went just as often.I said I didnt want to be a farm wife and you said, fine, you dont have to bebut you were at the farm twelve hours a day, sometimes seven days a week.And if you had a day off, which you hardly ever did, we never did what I wanted to do.Never?he asked.Hardly, she said.But thats not the point.I couldnt talk to you because I already knew what youd say.Youd say, thats great!And tell your family and everyone and then disappear into the trees again.And Id be alone.Then Id be alone with a child I wasnt ready to have.I knew eventually youd get me on this damn farm!Turn me into a drudge.Wait, he said.Georges wife isnt a farm wifeshes a physical therapist and has a career.And she wasnt at all the family dinners, either.
