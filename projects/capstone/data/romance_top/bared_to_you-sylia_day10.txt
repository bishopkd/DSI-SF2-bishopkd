But I didnt say that aloud.Hed get there someday.I wasnt going to give up until he was absolutely, irrevocably mine.With his bare feet propped on the coffee table and his computer on his lap, Gideon looked so at home and relaxed that he kept distracting me from my television shows.How did we get here?I asked myself.This extravagantly sexy man and me?Youre staring, he murmured, his gaze on his laptop screen.I stuck my tongue out at him.Is that a sexual suggestion, Miss Tramell?How do you see me while staring at whatever youre working on?He looked up then and caught my gaze.His blue eyes blazed with power and heat.Ive always seen you, angel.From the moment you found me, Ive seen nothing but you.Wednesday started with Gideons cock pushing into me from behind, my new favorite way to wake up.Well, then, I said hoarsely, rubbing the sleep from my eyes as his arm hitched around my waist and hauled me closer to his warm, hard chest.Youre frisky this morning.Youre gorgeous and sexy every morning, he murmured, nibbling on my shoulder.I love waking up to you.We celebrated a night of uninterrupted sleep with a handful of orgasms between us.Much later in the day, I had lunch with Mark and his partner Steven at a lovely Mexican restaurant tucked beneath the street.We descended a short set of cement stairs into a surprisingly spacious restaurant with black vested waitstaff and plenty of light.Youll need to bring your man back here, Steven said, and have him buy you one of the pomegranate margaritas.Good stuff?I asked.Oh, yeah.When the waitress came to take our orders, she flirted outrageously with Mark, fluttering enviously long lashes.Mark flirted back.As the meal progressed, the exuberant redhead whose name tag introduced her as Shawna became bolder, touching Marks shoulders and the back of his neck every time she came by.In return, Marks banter became more suggestive, until I eyed Steven nervously, watching his face redden and his scowl deepen by the moment.Shifting uncomfortably, I was counting down the minutes until the tension fraught meal was over.Lets get together tonight, Shawna said to Mark when she brought the check.One night with me and Ill cure you.I gaped.Seriously?Seven oclock work for you?Mark purred.Ill ruin you, Shawna.You know what happens once you go black  I inhaled my water down the wrong pipe and choked.Steven leaped to his feet and rounded the table, pounding me on the back.Hell, Eva, he said, laughing.Were just playing with you.Dont die on us.What?I gasped, my eyes watering.Grinning, he came around my shoulder and tossed his arm around the waitress.Eva, meet my sister, Shawna.Shawna, Eva here is the one who makes Marks life easier.Thats good, Shawna said, since hes got you to make things harder.Steven winked at me.Thats why he keeps me around.Seeing the brother and sister pair so close together, I finally caught the resemblance Id missed before.I sagged into my seat and narrowed my eyes at Mark.That was rotten.I thought Steven was going to blow a gasket.Mark held up his hands in a show of surrender.It was all his idea.Hes the drama queen, remember?Rocking back on his heels, Steven grinned and said, Now, Eva.You know Marks the idea man in this relationship.Shawna dug a business card out of her pocket and handed it to me.My numbers on the flipside.Gimme a call.Ive got the inside dirt on these two.You can pay em back really good.Traitor!Steven accused.Hey.Shawna shrugged.Us girls have to stick together.After work, Gideon and I went to his gym.Angus dropped us off at the curb and we headed inside.The place was hopping and the locker room crowded.I changed and stowed my stuff; then met Gideon in the hallway.I waved at Daniel, the trainer whod talked to me on my first visit to CrossTrainer, and got a smack on the ass for it.Hey, I protested, swatting at Gideons chastising hand.Cut it out.He tugged my ponytail and gently urged my head back, tilting my mouth up so he could mark his territory with a deep, lush kiss.The way he pulled my hair sent electricity sweeping across my skin.If this is your idea of a deterrent, I whispered against his lips, I have to say its much more of an incentive.Im quite willing to take it up a notch.He nipped my lower lip with his teeth.But I wouldnt suggest testing my limits that way, Eva.Dont worry.I have other ways to do it.Gideon hit the treadmill first, affording me the pleasure of seeing his body glistening with sweatin public.As often as I saw him that way in private, it never ceased to be a major turn on.And God, I loved the way he looked with his hair tied back.And the flex of his muscles beneath lightly tanned skin.And the graceful power of his movements.Seeing such an elegantly urbane man shed the suits and show off his animal side hit all my hot buttons.I couldnt stop staring and was happy I didnt have to.He was mine, after all; a fact that sent warm pleasure sliding through me.Besides, every other woman in the gym was checking him out, too.As he moved from station to station, dozens of admiring eyes followed.When he caught me ogling, I shot him a suggestive glance and ran my tongue along my lower lip.His arched brow and rueful half smile made me tingly.I couldnt remember the last time Id been so motivated while working out.An hour and a half just flew by.By the time we got back in the Bentley and headed to the penthouse, I was squirming in my seat.My gaze slid repeatedly to Gideon in silent invitation.He linked his fingers with mine.Youll wait for it.That pronouncement startled me.What?You heard me.He kissed my fingers and had the nerve to give me a wicked smile.Delayed gratification, angel.Why would we do that?Think of how crazed well be for each other after dinner.I leaned closer so Angus didnt overhear me, although I knew he was professional enough to ignore us.Thats a given, waiting or not.I say we go with not.But he wouldnt budge.Instead, he tortured us both.Having us undress one another for a steamy shower, our hands petting and caressing the curves and hollows of each others bodies; then dressing for dinner.He went all out in black tie, but skipped the tie.His crisp white shirt was unbuttoned at the collar, revealing a flash of skin.The cocktail dress he selected for me was a champagne silk Vera Wang with a strapless bustier bodice, an open back, and a tiered skirt that ended a few inches above my knees.I smiled when I saw it, knowing it was going to drive him nuts seeing me in that dress all night.It was gorgeous and I loved it, but it was a style meant for tall, slender models, not short curvy girls.In a pitiful bid for modesty, I left my hair down to hang over my breasts, but it didnt help much if Gideons expression was any indication.My God, Eva.He adjusted himself in his slacks.Ive changed my mind about that dress.You shouldnt wear it in public.We dont have time for you to change your mind.I thought there was more material than that.I shrugged with a grin.What can I say?You bought it.Im having second thoughts.How long could it possibly take to remove it?Sliding my tongue along my lower lip, I said, I dont know.Why dont you find out?His eyes turned dark.Wed never get out of here.I wouldnt complain.He looked so damn hot and I wanted him as always really damned bad.Isnt there a jacket or something you can put over that?A parka, maybe?Or a trench coat?Laughing, I grabbed my clutch off the dresser and wrapped my arm around his.Dont worry.Everyone will be too busy checking you out to even bother noticing me.He scowled as I tugged him out of the bedroom.Seriously.Have your tits gotten bigger?Theyre spilling out over the top of that thing.Im twenty four years old, Gideon, I said dryly.I stopped developing years ago.What you see is what you get.Yes, but Im the only one whos supposed to be seeing, since Im the only one whos allowed to be getting.We moved into the living room.In the short time it took us to pass through to the foyer, I relished the quiet beauty of Gideons home.I loved how warm and inviting it was.The old world charm of the dcor was so elegant, yet it was also remarkably comfortable.The stunning view out of the arched windows complemented the interior, but didnt distract from it.The mixture of dark woods, distressed stone, warm colors, and vivid jeweled accents was clearly expensive, as was the art hung on the walls, but it was a tasteful display of wealth.I couldnt imagine anyone feeling awkward about what to touch or where to sit.It just wasnt that kind of space.We caught the private elevator and Gideon faced me as the doors closed.He immediately tried tugging my bodice up.If youre not careful, I warned, youll expose my crotch instead.Damn it.We could have fun with this.I could play the role of a bubbleheaded blond bimbo whos after your cock and your millions, and you can be yourself the billionaire playboy with his latest toy.Just look bored and indulgent while I rub up against you and coo about how brilliant you are.Thats not funny.Then he brightened.What about a scarf?Once we checked in for the gala dinner benefitting a new crisis shelter for women and children, we were directed to a press gauntlet, triggering my fear of exposure.I focused on Gideon because nothing distracted me as thoroughly as he did.And because I was paying such close attention, I was able to watch the change from private man to public persona as it happened.The mask slipped smoothly into place.His irises chilled to an icy blue and his sensual mouth lost any hint of curve.I could almost feel the force of his will enclosing us.There was a shield between us and the rest of the world simply because he wished it to be there.Standing beside him, I knew no one would approach or speak to me until he gave them some sign that they could.Still, the dont touch vibe didnt extend to looking.Gideon turned heads as we walked to the ballroom and eyes followed him.I got a nervous twitch from all the attention he garnered, but he seemed oblivious and completely unruffled.If Id had my heart set on cooing and rubbing all over Gideon, I wouldve had to wait in line.He was pretty much mobbed the moment we stopped walking.I stepped away to make room for those vying to catch his attention and wandered off to find some champagne.Waters Field & Leaman had done the pro bono advertising for the gala, and I spotted a few people I knew.Id managed to snag a glass off a passing waiters tray when I heard someone call out my name.Turning, I saw Stantons nephew approaching with a broad smile.Dark haired and green eyed, he was around my age.I knew him from the times Id visited my mother on holiday breaks and was glad to see him.Martin!I greeted him with open arms and we hugged briefly.How are you?You look fabulous.I was about to say the same.He eyed my dress appreciatively.Id heard youd moved to New York and meant to look you up.How long have you been in town?Not long.A few weeks.Drink your champagne, he said.And lets dance.The wine was still bubbling nicely through my system when we moved onto the dance floor to the sound of Billie Holliday singing Summertime.So, he began, are you working?As we danced, I told him about my job and I asked what he was up to.I wasnt surprised to hear he was working for Stantons investment firm and doing well.Id love to come uptown and take you out to lunch sometime, he said.That would be great.I stepped back as the music ended and bumped into someone behind me.Hands went to my waist to steady me and I looked over my shoulder to find Gideon at my back.Hello, he purred, his icy gaze on Martin.Introduce us.Gideon, this is Martin Stanton.Weve known each other for a few years now.Hes my stepfathers nephew.I took a deep breath and went for it.Martin, this is the significant man in my life, Gideon Cross.Cross.Martin grinned and held out his hand.I know who you are, of course.Its a pleasure to meet you.If things work out, maybe Ill be seeing you at some of the family gatherings.Gideons arm slid around my shoulders.Count on it.Martin was hailed by someone he knew and he leaned forward to kiss my cheek.Ill call you about lunch.Next week maybe?Great.I was highly conscious of Gideon vibrating with energy beside me, although when I glanced at him, his face with calm and impassive.He pulled me into a dance, with Louis Armstrong singing What a Wonderful World.Not sure I like him, he muttered.Martins a very nice guy.Just so long as he knows youre mine.He pressed his cheek to my temple and placed his hand within the cutout back of my dress, skin to skin.There was no way to doubt that I belonged to him when he was holding me like that.I relished the opportunity to be so close to his scrumptious body in public.Breathing him in, I relaxed into his expert hold.I like this.Nuzzling against me, he murmured, Thats the idea.Bliss.It lasted as long as the dance did.We were exiting the dance floor when I caught sight of Magdalene off to the side.It took me a moment to recognize her because shed cut her hair into a sleek bob.She looked slender and classy in a simple black cocktail dress, but was eclipsed by the striking brunette she was speaking to.Gideons stride faltered, slowing fractionally before resuming his usual pace.I was looking down, thinking hed avoided something on the floor, when he said quietly, I need to introduce you to someone.My attention shifted to see where we were going.The woman with Magdalene had spotted Gideon and turned to face him.I felt his forearm tense beneath my fingers the moment their gazes met.I could see why.The woman, whoever she was, was deeply in love with Gideon.It was there on her face and in her pale, otherworldly blue eyes.Her beauty was stunning, so exquisite as to be surreal.Her hair was black as ink and hung thick and straight almost to her waist.Her dress was the same icy hue as her eyes, her skin golden from the sun, her body long and perfectly curved.Corinne, he greeted her, the natural rasp in his voice even more pronounced.He released me and caught her hands.You didnt tell me you were back.I wouldve picked you up.I left a few messages on your voice mail at home, she said, in a voice that was cultured and smooth.Ah, I havent been there much lately.As if that reminded him I was next to him, he released her and drew me up to his side.Corinne, this is Eva Tramell.Eva, Corinne Giroux.An old friend.I extended my hand to her and she shook it.Any friend of Gideons is a friend of mine, she said with a warm smile.I hope that applies to girlfriends as well.When her gaze met mine, it was knowing.Especially girlfriends.If you could spare him a moment, Ive been hoping to introduce him to an associate of mine.Of course.My voice was calm; I was anything but.Gideon gave me a perfunctory kiss on the temple before he stepped closer to Corinne and offered his arm to her, leaving Magdalene standing awkwardly next to me.I actually felt sorry for her, she looked so dejected.Your new hairstyle is very flattering, Magdalene.She glanced at me, her mouth tight, and then it softened with a sigh that sounded filled with resignation.Thank you.It was time for a change.Time for many changes, I think.Also, there was no reason to imitate the one who got away now that shes back.I frowned in confusion.You lost me.Im talking about Corinne.She studied my face.You dont know.She and Gideon were engaged, for over a year.She broke it off, married a wealthy Frenchman, and moved to Europe.But the marriage fell apart.Theyre now getting divorced and shes moved back to New York.Engaged.I felt the blood drain from my face, my gaze shifting to where the man I loved stood with the woman he mustve once loved, his hand moving to the small of her back to steady her as she leaned into him with a laugh.As my stomach twisted with jealousy and sick fear, it struck me that Id assumed he had never had a serious romantic relationship before me.Stupid.As hot as he was, I shouldve known better.Magdalene touched my shoulder.You should sit down, Eva.Youre very pale.I knew I was breathing too fast and my speeding pulse rate was dangerously high.Youre right.Moving to the nearest available chair, I got off my feet.Magdalene sat beside me.You love him, she said.I didnt see it.Im sorry.And Im sorry for what I said to you the first time we met.You love him, too, I replied woodenly, my gaze unfocused.And at that time, I didnt.Not yet.Doesnt excuse me, does it?I gratefully accepted another glass of champagne when it was offered to me and took a second for Magdalene before the waiter straightened to move on.We clinked glasses in a pitiful display of scorned female solidarity.I wanted to leave.I wanted to get up and walk out.I wanted Gideon to realize Id left, to be forced to leave after me.I wanted him to feel some of the pain I felt.Stupid, immature, hurtful imaginings that made me feel small.I took comfort from Magdalene sitting silently beside me in commiseration.She knew how it felt to love Gideon and want him too much.That I sensed she was as miserable as I was confirmed what a threat Corinne might be.Had he been pining for her this whole time?Was she the reason hed closed himself off from other women?There you are.I looked up as Gideon found me.Of course Corinne was still on his arm and I got the full effect of the two of them as a couple.There were, quite simply, impossibly gorgeous together.Corinne took a seat beside me and Gideon brushed his fingertips over my cheek.I have to speak with someone, he said.Would you like me to bring you back anything?Stoli and cranberry.Make it a double.I needed a buzz.Bad.All right.But he frowned at my request before he walked away.Im so glad to meet you, Eva, Corinne said.Gideon has told me so much about you.It cant have been too much.You two werent gone that long.We talk nearly every day.She smiled, and there was nothing fake or malicious in her expression.Weve been friends a long time.More than friends, Magdalene said pointedly.Corinne frowned at Magdalene and I realized I wasnt supposed to know.Was it she or Gideon or both of them that had decided it was best not to tell me?Why cover up something if there was nothing to hide?Yes, thats true, she admitted with obvious reluctance.Although that was some years ago now.I twisted in my seat to face her.You still love him.You cant blame me for that.Any woman who spends time with him falls in love with him.Hes beautiful and untouchable.Thats an irresistible combination.Her smile softened.He tells me youve inspired him to start opening up.Im grateful to you for that.I was about to say, I didnt do it for you.Then an insidious doubt drifted through my mind, making a vulnerable spot inside me fold in on itself.Was I doing it for her without knowing it?I twisted the base of my empty champagne flute around and around on the table.He was going to marry you.And it was the biggest mistake of my life walking away.Her hand went to her throat, her slender fingers restlessly stroking, as if toying with a necklace shed normally find there.I was young and in some ways he frightened me.He was so possessive.It wasnt until after I married that I realized possessiveness is much better than indifference.At least for me.I looked away, fighting the nausea that rose in my throat.Youre awfully quiet, she said.What is there to say?Magdalene tossed out.We all loved him.We were all available to him.In the end, he would make a choice between us.You should know, Eva, Corinne began, looking at me with those clear aquamarine eyes, hes told me how special you are to him.It took me some time to gather the courage to come back here and face you two together.I even canceled a flight I had booked a couple weekends ago.I interrupted him at some charity event he was giving a speech at, poor guy, to tell him I was on my way and to ask for his help getting settled.I froze, feeling as brittle as cracked glass.She had to be talking about the advocacy center dinner, the night Gideon and I had sex for the first time.The night wed christened his limo and hed immediately withdrawn; then left me abruptly.When he called me back, she continued, he told me hed met someone.That he wanted you and me to meet when I got into town.I ended up chickening out.Hes never asked me to meet a woman in his life before.Oh my God.I glanced at Magdalene.Gideon had left me in a rush that night for her.For Corinne.21  Excuse me.I pushed back from the table and searched for Gideon.I saw him at the bar and went to him.He was just turning away from the bartender with two glasses in his hands when I intercepted him.I took my drink and gulped it down, my teeth aching as the cubes of ice knocked against them.Eva  There was a soft note of chastisement in his voice.Im leaving, I said flatly, stepping around him to set my empty glass on the bar top.I dont consider that running, because Im telling you in advance and giving you the option of coming with me.He exhaled harshly and I could see that he understood my mood.He knew I knew.I cant leave.I turned away.He caught my arm.You know I cant stay if you go.Youre upset over nothing, Eva.Nothing?I stared at where his hand gripped me.I warned you I get upset and jealous.This time, youve given me good reason.Warning me is supposed to excuse you when you get ridiculous about it?His face was relaxed, his voice low and calm.No one looking from a distance would pick up on the tension between us, but it was there in his eyes.Burning lust and icy fury.He was so good at putting those two together.Whos ridiculous?What about Daniel, the personal trainer?Or Martin, a member of my stepfamily?I leaned closer and whispered, Ive never fucked either of them, let alone agreed to a marriage!I sure as hell dont talk to them every damn day!Abruptly, he caught me by the waist and hauled me up tight against him.You need to be fucked now, he hissed in my ear, nipping the lobe with his teeth.I shouldnt have made us wait.Maybe you were planning ahead, I shot back.Saving it up in case an old flame popped back into your life, one youd prefer to screw instead.Gideon tossed back his drink; then he secured me to his side with a steely arm around my waist and led me through the crowd to the door.He pulled his smartphone out of his pocket and ordered the limo brought around.By the time we reached the street, the long, sleek car was there.Gideon pushed me through the door Angus held open and told him, Drive around the block until I say otherwise.Then he slid in directly behind me, so closely I could feel his breath against my bare back.I scrambled toward the opposite seat, determined to get away from him  Stop, he snapped.I sank to my knees on the carpeted floor, breathing hard.I could run to the ends of the earth and I still wouldnt be able to escape the fact that Corinne Giroux had to be better for Gideon than I was.She was calm and cool, a soothing presence even to me the person freaking out over the unwelcome fact of her existence.My worst nightmare.His hand twisted into my loose hair, restraining me.His spread legs surrounded mine, his grip tightening so that my head was pulled back gently to touch his shoulder.Im going to give you what we both need, Eva.Were going to fuck as long as it takes to dull the edge enough to get through dinner.And youre not going to worry about Corinne, because while shes inside the ballroom, Ill be deep inside you.Yes, I whispered, licking dry lips.You forget who submits, Eva, he said gruffly.Ive given up control for you.Ive bent and adjusted for you.Ill do anything to keep you and make you happy.But I cant be tamed or topped.Dont mistake indulgence for weakness.I swallowed hard, my blood on fire for him.Gideon  Reach up with both hands and hold on to the grab handle above the window.Dont let go until I tell you, understand?I did as he ordered, pushing my hands through the leather loop.As my grip secured, my body sparked to life, making me aware of how right he was about what I needed.He knew me so well, this lover of mine.Shoving his hands into my bodice, Gideon squeezed my full, aching breasts.When he rolled and tugged my nipples, my head lolled against him, the tension leaving my body in a rush.God.He nuzzled his mouth against my temple.Its so perfect when you give yourself over to me like thatall at once, as if its a huge relief.Fuck me, I begged, needing the connection.Please.Releasing my hair, he reached under my dress and pulled my panties down my thighs.His jacket flew past me to land on the seat; then his hand pushed between my legs from the front.He growled at finding me wet and swollen.You were made for me, Eva.You cant go long without me inside you.Still he primed me, running his skilled fingers through my cleft, spreading the moisture over my clit and the lips of my sex.He pushed two fingers into me, scissoring them, preparing me for the thrust of his long, thick cock.Do you want me, Gideon?I asked hoarsely, needing to ride his thrusting fingers, but hampered by how far I had to reach to grab the strap.More than my next breath.His lips moved over my throat and the top of my shoulder, the warm velvet of his tongue sliding seductively across my skin.I cant go long without you either, Eva.Youre an addictionmy obsession  His teeth bit gently into my flesh, conveying his animal need with a rough sound of desire.All the while he fucked me with his fingers, his other hand massaging my clit, making me come again and again from the simultaneous stimulation.Gideon!I gasped, when my damp fingers began to slip from the leather.His hands left me and I heard the erotic rasp of his zipper lowering.Let go and lie on your back with your legs spread.I moved to the seat and stretched along it, offering my body to him in quivering anticipation.His gaze met mine, his face briefly lit by a passing swathe of headlights.Dont be afraid.He came over me, setting his weight onto me with excruciating care.Im too horny to be scared.I caught him and pulled my body up to press against the hardness of his.I want you.His cock head nudged against the lips of my sex.With a flex of his hips, he pushed into me, his breath hissing just as mine did at the searing connection.I went lax against the seat, my fingers barely clinging to his lean waist.I love you, I whispered, watching his face as he began to move.Every inch of my skin burned as if from the sun, and my chest was so tight with longing and emotion that it was hard to breathe.And I need you, Gideon.You have me, he whispered, his cock sliding in and out.I couldnt be more yours.I quivered and tensed, my hips meeting his relentlessly measured drives.I climaxed with a breathless cry, shuddering as the ecstasy rippled through my sex, milking him until he grunted and started powering into me.Eva.I rocked into his ferocious lunges, urging him on.He clutched at me, riding me hard and fast.My head thrashed and I moaned shamelessly, loving the feel of him, that decadent sensation of being possessed and ruthlessly pleasured.We were wild for each other, fucking like feral beasts, and I was so turned on by our primal lust I thought Id die from the orgasm building inside me.Youre so good at this, Gideon.So good  He gripped my buttock and yanked me up to meet his next thrust, hitting the end of me, forcing a gasp of pleasure/pain from my throat.I came again, clenching down hard on him.Ah, God.Eva.With a serrated groan, he erupted violently, flooding me with his heat.Pinning my hips, he ground against me, emptying himself as deep in me as he could get.When he finished, he sucked in a harsh breath and gathered my hair in his hands, kissing the side of my damp throat.I wish you knew what you do to me.I wish I could tell you.I held him tightly.I cant help it that Im stupid over you.Its just too much, Gideon.Its    uncontrollable.He started over again, thrusting rhythmically.Leisurely.As if we had all the time in the world.Thickening and lengthening with each push and pull.And you need control.I lost my breath on a particularly masterful stroke.I need you, Eva.His gaze was fierce on my face as he moved inside me.I need you.Gideon didnt leave my side, or allow me to leave his, the rest of the evening.He kept his right hand linked with my left all the way through dinner, once again choosing to eat one handed rather than release his hold on me.Corinne whod taken a seat on the other side of him at our table gave him a curious look.I seem to remember you being right handed.I still am, he said, lifting our joined hands from under the table and kissing my fingertips.I felt foolish and insecure when he did that and conscious of Corinnes scrutiny.Unfortunately, the romantic gesture didnt keep him from talking to Corinne throughout the meal, not me which left me feeling fidgety and unhappy.I saw more of the back of Gideons head than his face.At least its not chicken.I turned my head toward the man sitting beside me.Id been so focused on trying to eavesdrop on Gideons conversation that I hadnt paid any mind to our tablemates.I like chicken, I said.And I had liked the tilapia served for dinner Id cleaned my plate.Not rubberized, certainly.He grinned and suddenly looked much younger than his pure white hair would suggest.Ah, theres a smile, he murmured.And its a beautiful one.Thank you.I introduced myself.Dr.Terrence Lucas, he said.But I prefer Terry.Dr.Terry.Its lovely to meet you.He smiled again.Just Terry, Eva.Over the course of the few minutes wed spoken, Id come to believe Dr.Lucas wasnt a whole lot older than me, just prematurely gray.Aside from that, his face was handsome and unlined, his green eyes intelligent and kind.I revised my guesstimate of his age to be mid to late thirties.You look as bored as I feel, he said.These events raise a considerable amount of money for the shelter, but they can be dull.Would you like to accompany me to the bar?Ill buy you a drink.Beneath the table, I tested Gideons grip by flexing my hand.His tightened.What are you doing?he murmured.Looking over my shoulder, I saw him watching me.Then I watched his gaze lift as Dr.Lucas stood behind me.Gideons gaze noticeably cooled.Shes going to alleviate the boredom of being ignored, Cross, Terry said, setting his hands on the back of my chair, by spending time with someone whos more than happy to pay attention to such a beautiful woman.I was immediately uncomfortable, aware of the crackling animosity between the two men.I tugged on his hand, but Gideon wouldnt release me.Walk away, Terry, Gideon warned.Youve been so preoccupied with Mrs.Giroux, you didnt even notice when I sat at your table.Terrys smile took on an edge.Eva.Shall we?Dont move, Eva.I shivered at the ice in Gideons voice, but felt stung enough to say, Its not his fault he has a point.Gideons grip tightened painfully.Not now.Terrys gaze moved to my face.You dont have to tolerate him talking to you that way.All the money in the world doesnt give anyone the right to order you around.Infuriated and horribly embarrassed, I looked at Gideon.Crossfire.I wasnt sure I could use the safeword outside of the bedroom, but he released me as if Id burned him.I shoved my chair back and threw my napkin onto my plate.Excuse me.Both of you.With my clutch in hand, I walked away from the table, my stride easy and smooth.I made a beeline toward the restrooms, intending to freshen my makeup and collect myself, but then I saw the lighted exit sign and went with my urge to bail.I pulled out my smartphone when I hit the sidewalk and texted Gideon; Not running.Just leaving.I managed to hail a passing cab, and headed home to nurse my anger.I was jonesing for a hot bath and a bottle of wine when I reached my apartment.Shoving my key into the lock, I turned the knob and stepped into a porn video.In the few shocked seconds it took for my brain to register what I was seeing, I stood riveted on the threshold, flooding the hallway behind me with blaring technopop.There were so many body parts involved, I had time to hastily slam the door behind me before I pieced them all together.One woman was spread eagled on the floor.Another womans face was in her crotch.Cary was banging the hell out of her while another man was drilling him in the ass.I threw my head back and screamed bloody murder, completely fed up with everyone in my life.And because I was competing with the sound system, I ripped off one of my heels and threw it in that direction.The CD skipped, which jolted the mnage a quatre in progress on my living room floor into awareness of my presence.I limped over and shut off the volume; then faced the lot of them.Get the fuck out of my house, I snapped.Right now.Who the hell is that?the redhead at the bottom of the pile asked.Your wife?There was a brief flash of embarrassment and guilt on Carys face, and then he shot me a cocky smile.My roommate.Theres room for more, baby girl.Cary Taylor.Dont push me, I warned.Its really, really not a good night.The dark haired male on top disengaged from Cary and stood, sauntering toward me.As he got closer, I saw his hazel eyes were unnaturally dilated and the pulse in his neck was throbbing viciously.I can make it better, he offered with a leer.Back the fuck up.I adjusted my stance, preparing to ward him off physically if necessary.Leave her alone, Ian, Cary snapped, pushing to his feet.Come on, baby girl, Ian coaxed, making me sick by using Carys pet name for me.You need a good time.Let me show you one.One minute he was inches in front of me, the next he was sailing into the couch with a scream.Gideon moved into place between me and the others, vibrating with fury.Take it to your room, Cary, he bit out.Or take it somewhere else.Ian was squealing on my sofa, his nose spraying blood despite the two hands he tried to staunch it with.Cary snatched his jeans off the floor.Youre not my fucking mother, Eva.I sidestepped around Gideon.Wasnt screwing up with Trey enough of a fucking lesson for you, you idiot?This isnt about Trey!Whos Trey?The bottle blonde asked as she got to her feet.When she caught a good look at Gideon, she visibly preened, showing off an admittedly pretty body.Her efforts earned her a glance so disdainfully dismissive and unimpressed that she finally had the grace to blush and cover herself with a slinky gold lam dress she picked up off the floor.And because I was in a mood, I said, Dont take it personally.He prefers brunettes.The look Gideon shot me was lethal.Id never seen him look so livid.He was literally vibrating with suppressed violence.Frightened by that glare, I took an involuntary step back.He cursed viciously and shoved both of his hands through his hair.Suddenly bone weary and desperately disappointed with the men in my life, I turned away.Get this mess out of my house, Cary.I headed down the hallway, kicking off my other heel en route.I was out of my dress before I reached my bathroom and in the shower less than a minute beyond that.I stayed out of the range of the spray until the water warmed, and then I stood directly beneath it.Too tired to stand for long, I sank to the floor and just sat beneath the stream with my eyes closed and my arms wrapped around my knees.Eva.I cringed when I heard Gideons voice, and tucked into an even tighter ball.Goddamn it, he snapped.You piss me off worse than anyone else I know.I looked at him through the veil of my wet hair.He was pacing the length of my bathroom, his jacket shed somewhere and his shirt untucked.Go home, Gideon.He halted and shot me an incredulous look.Im not fucking leaving you here.Carys lost his damned mind!That amped up asshole was seconds away from putting his hands on you when I got here.Cary wouldnt have let that happen.But either way, I cant deal with him and you at the same time.I didnt want to deal with either of them, actually.I just wanted to be alone.Then youll just deal with me.I scooped my hair back from my face with an impatient swipe of my hand.Oh?Im supposed to make you the priority?He recoiled as if Id hit him.I was under the impression we were both each others priorities.Yeah, I thought that, too.Until tonight.Jesus.Will you drop it with Corinne already?He spread his arms wide.Im here with you, arent I?I barely said good bye to her because I was chasing after you.Again.Fuck you.Dont do me any favors.Gideon lunged into the shower fully dressed.He yanked me to my feet and kissed me.Hard.His mouth devoured mine, his hands gripping my upper arms to hold me in place.But I didnt soften this time.I didnt give in.Even when he tried coaxing me with lush, suggestive licks.Why?he muttered, his lips sliding down to my throat.Why are you driving me insane?I dont know what your problem is with Dr.Lucas, and I honestly dont give a shit.But he was right.Corinne got way too much of your attention tonight.You pretty much ignored me during dinner.Its impossible for me to ignore you, Eva.His face was hard and tight.If youre in the same room with me, I dont see anyone else.Funny.Every time I looked at you, you were looking at her.This is stupid.He released me and shoved the wet hair out of his face.You know how I feel about you.Do I?You want me.You need me.But do you love Corinne?Oh, for fucks sake.No.He shut the water off, caging me to the glass with both arms.You want me to tell you I love you, Eva?Is that what this is about?My stomach cramped as if hed struck me with the full force of his fist.Id never felt that kind of pain before, hadnt known it existed.My eyes burned and I ducked under his arm before I embarrassed myself by crying.Go home, Gideon.Please.I am home.He caught me from behind and buried his face in my soaked hair.Im with you.I struggled to get free, but I was too wiped out.Physically.Emotionally.The tears came in a torrent and I couldnt stop them.And I hated crying in front of anyone.Go away.Please.I love you, Eva.Of course I do.Oh my God.I kicked at him, flailing.Anything to get away from the person whod become a massive source of pain and misery.I dont want your fucking pity.I just want you to go away.I cant.You know I cant.Eva, stop fighting.Listen to me.Everything youre saying hurts, Gideon.Its not the right word, Eva, he pressed on stubbornly, his lips at my ear.Thats why I havent said it.Its not the right word for you and what I feel for you.Shut up.If you care about me at all, youll just shut up and go away.Ive been loved before by Corinne, by other womenBut what the hell do they know about me?What the hell are they in love with when they dont know how fucked up I am?If thats love, its nothing compared to what I feel for you.I stilled, trembling, my gaze on the mirrors reflection of my mascara smeared face and bedraggled wet hair next to Gideons ravaged beauty.His features were overcome by volatile emotion as he wrapped himself tightly around me.We looked all wrong for each other.And yet I understood the alienation of being around others who couldnt really see you or chose not to.Id felt the self loathing that came with being a fraud, portraying an image of what you wished you could be but werent.Id lived with the fear that the people you loved might turn away from you if they ever got to know the true person hidden inside.Gideon   His lips touched my temple.I think I loved you the moment I saw you.Then we made love that first time in the limo and it became something else.Something more.Whatever.You cut me off that night and left me behind to take care of Corinne.How could you, Gideon?He released me only long enough to scoop me up and carry me over to where my bathrobe hung from a hook on the back of the door.He bundled me up; then had me sit on the edge of the tub while he went to the sink and pulled my makeup removal wipes out of the drawer.Crouching in front of me, he stroked the cloth over my cheek.When Corinne called during the advocacy dinner, it was the perfect time to make me do something stupid.His gaze was soft and warm on my tear streaked face.You and I had just made love, and I wasnt thinking clearly.I told her I was busy and that I was with someone, and when I heard the pain in her voice, I knew I had to deal with her so I could move forward with you.I dont understand.You left me behind for her.How does that move us forward?I screwed up with Corinne, Eva.He tilted my chin back to rub at my raccoon eyes.I met her my first year at Columbia.I noticed her, of course.Shes beautiful and sweet, and never had an unkind word to say about anyone.When she pursued me, I let myself be caught and she became my first consensual sexual experience.I hate her.That made his mouth curve slightly.Im not kidding, Gideon.Im sick with jealousy right now.It was just sex with her, angel.As raw as you and I fuck, its still making love.Every time, from the very first time.Youre the only one whos ever gotten to me that way.I heaved out a breath.Okay.Im marginally better.He kissed me.I guess you could say we dated.We were exclusive sexually and we often ended up going to the same places as a couple.Still, when she told me she loved me, I was surprised.And flattered.I cared about her.I enjoyed spending time with her.Still do, apparently, I muttered.Keep listening.He chastised me with a tap of his finger to the end of my nose.I thought maybe I might love her, too, in my own waythe only way I knew how.I didnt want her to be with anyone else.So I said yes when she proposed.I jerked back to look at him.She proposed?Dont look so shocked, he said wryly.Youre bruising my ego.Relief flooded me in a rush that made me dizzy.I threw myself at him, hugging him as tight as I could.Hey.His returning embrace was just as fierce.You okay?Yes.Yes, Im getting there.I pulled back and cupped his jaw in my hand.Keep going.I said yes for all the wrong reasons.After two years of hanging out, wed never spent a full night together.Never talked about any of the things I talk to you about.She didnt know me, not really, and yet I convinced myself that being loved at all was something to hang on to.Who else was going to do it right, if not her?He moved his attention to my other eye, cleaning away the black streaks.I think she was hoping that being engaged would take us to a different level.Maybe Id open up more.Maybe wed stay the night at the hotel which she thought was romantic, by the way instead of calling it an early night because of classes in the morning.I dont know.I thought it sounded terribly lonely.My poor Gideon.Hed been alone for so long.Maybe his whole life.And maybe when she broke it off after a year, he went on, she was hoping that would kick start things, too.That Id make a bigger effort to keep her.Instead, I was relieved because Id started to realize it was going to be impossible to share a home with her.What excuse was I going to come up with to sleep in separate rooms and have my own space?You never considered telling her?No.He shrugged.Until you, I didnt consider my past an issue.Yes, it affected certain ways I did things, but everything had its place and I wasnt unhappy.In fact, I thought I had a comfortable and uncomplicated life.Oh, boy.My nose wrinkled.Hello, Mr.Comfortable.Im Miss Complicated.His grin flashed.Never a dull moment.22  Gideon tossed the makeup remover wipe in the trash.Then he grabbed a towel to throw over the puddle hed left on the floor and toed off his shoes.To my utter delight, he began stripping out of his wet clothes.Watching him raptly, I said, You feel guilty because she still loves you.I do, yes.I knew her husband.He was a good guy and he was crazy about her, until he figured out she didnt feel the same way and things fell apart.He looked at me as he peeled his shirt off.I couldnt figure out why he let it get to him.He was married to the girl he wanted, they lived in a different country away from me, so what was his problem?Now, I understand.If you loved someone else, Eva, itd shred me to pieces, every single day.Itd kill me even if you were with me and not him.But unlike Giroux, I wouldnt let you go.Maybe I wouldnt have all of you, but youd still be mine and Id take what I could get.My fingers laced in my lap.Thats what scares me, Gideon.You dont know what youre worth.Actually, I do.Twelve bill   Shut up.My head spun and I pressed my fingertips to my eyes.It shouldnt be such a mystery that women fall in love with you and stay in love.Did you know that Magdalene kept her hair long hoping itd remind you of Corinne?He dropped his slacks and frowned at me.Why?I sighed at his cluelessness.Because she believes Corinne is who you want.Then shes not paying attention.Isnt she?Corinne told me she talks to you almost every day.Not quite.Im often not available.You know how busy I am.His gaze took on the heated look I was so familiar with.I knew he was thinking about the times he got busy with me.Thats nuts, Gideon.Her calling every day.Thats stalking.Which reminded me of her assertion that hed been as possessive over her as he was about me.That niggled at me in a terrible way.Where are you going with this?he asked, in a voice laced with warm amusement.Dont you get it?You drive women off the deep end because youre the ultimate.Youre the grand prize.If a woman cant have you, they know theyre settling for less than the best.So they cant think about not having you.They just think of crazy ways to try and get you.Except for the one I want, he retorted dryly, who spends a lot of time running in the opposite direction.I stared unabashedly, drinking him in as he stood naked in front of me.Answer one question for me, Gideon.Why do you want me, when you can have your pick of perfection instead?And Im not fishing for compliments or reassurances.Im asking an honest question.He caught me up and moved us into the bedroom.Eva, if you dont stop thinking of us as temporary, Im going to take you over my knee and make damn sure you like it.Setting me down in a chair, he went to rifle through my drawers.I watched him pulling out underwear, yoga pants, and a top.Have you forgotten I sleep in the nude with you?Were not staying here.He faced me.I dont trust Cary not to bring more intoxicated jerks home and once we turn in for the night Ill be drugged on the medication Dr.Petersen prescribed and possibly unable to protect you.So were going to my place.I looked down at my twisted hands, thinking about how I might need protection from Gideon, too.Ive been down this road with Cary before, Gideon.I cant just hole up at your place and hope he comes out of it on his own.He needs me to be around more than I have been.Eva.Gideon brought me my clothes and crouched in front of me.I know you need to support Cary.Well figure out how tomorrow.I cupped his face.Thank you.I need you, too, though, he said quietly.We need each other.He pushed to his feet.Moving back to the dresser, he pulled open his drawers and grabbed clothes for himself.Standing, I began to dress.Listen  He pulled a pair of low slung jeans on.Yes?I feel tons better now that I know the score, but Corinne is still going to be a problem for me.I paused with my shirt in my hands.You wanna nip her hopes in the bud real quick.Stow the guilt, Gideon, and start weaning her off.He sat on the edge of the bed to pull on his socks.Shes a friend, Eva, and shes in a rough spot.Its a cruel time to cut her off.Think carefully, Gideon.I have exes in my past, too.Youre setting the precedent now for how Ill handle them.Im taking my cues from you.He stood with a scowl.Youre threatening me.I prefer to see it as coercion.Relationships work both ways.Youre not her only friend.She can find someone more appropriate to lean on in her time of crisis.We grabbed what we needed and walked back into the living room.I saw the mess left behind an aqua hued bra beneath an end table and blood spray on my cream sectional  and I wished Cary was still around to smack some sense into.Im digging into it with him tomorrow, I bit out, my jaw tight with anger and worry.Goddamn it, I shouldve decked him when I had the chance.I shouldve knocked him out cold, and then locked him up in his room until he gets his brain working again.Gideons hand at the small of my back rubbed soothingly.Itll be better to do that tomorrow, when hes alone and hungover.More effective that way.Angus was waiting for us when we got downstairs.I was about to climb into the back of the limo when Gideon cursed under his breath, stopping me.What?I asked him.I forgot something.Let me get my keys.I reached for the overnight bag Gideon was holding, which had my purse inside.No need.I have a set.He shot me an unapologetic grin when my brows rose.I had copies made before I gave them back to you.Seriously?If youd paid attention he kissed the top of my head you mightve noticed that youve had the key to my place on your key ring since I returned it.I gaped after him as he darted past the doorman and back into the building.I remembered the torment of those four days when Id thought wed broken up and the excruciating pain Id felt when those keys slid out of the envelope and into my palm.Id had the key to being with him all along.Shaking my head, I looked around at my adopted city, loving everything about it and feeling grateful for the crazy well of happiness Id found here.Gideon and I still had so much work ahead of us.As much as we loved each other, it was no guarantee that wed survive our personal wounds.But we communicated, we were honest with each other, and God knew we were both too stubborn to quit without a fight.Gideon reappeared just as two large, beautifully groomed poodles walked by with their equally coiffed owner.I climbed into the limo.As we pulled away from the curb, Gideon tugged me onto his lap and cuddled me close.We had a rough night, but we got through it.Yeah, we did.Tipping my head back, I offered my mouth for a kiss.He obliged me with one that was slow and sweet a simple reaffirmation of our precious, complicated, maddening, necessary connection.Cupping his nape, I ran my fingers through his silky hair.I cant wait to get you back in bed.He gave a sexy little growl and attacked my neck with tickling nips and kisses, banishing our ghosts and their shadows.
