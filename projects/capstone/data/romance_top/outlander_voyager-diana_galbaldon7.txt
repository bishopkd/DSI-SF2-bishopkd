Hes hiding in the starboard head, and says ye told him he mustna come out at all until hed shit.I didnt tell him that, exactly, I explained.I just said if he hadnt moved his bowels by tonight, Id give him an enema of slippery elm.Jamie glanced over his shoulder in the direction of the head.Well, I suppose we will hope that Inness bowels cooperate, or I doubt but hell spend the rest of the voyage in the head, wi a threat like that hangin ower him.Well, I shouldnt worry; now that he and the others have their parritch back, their bowels ought to take care of themselves without undue interference from me.Jamie glanced down at me, surprised.Got their parritch back?Whatever dye mean, Sassenach?I explained the genesis of the Oatmeal War, and its outcome, as he fetched a basin of water to clean his hands.A small frown drew his brows close together as he pushed his sleeves up his arms.They ought to have come to me about it, he said.I expect they would have, sooner or later, I said.I only happened to find out by accident, when I found Innes grunting behind a hatch cover.Mmphm.He set about scouring the bloodstains off his fingers, rubbing the clinging scales free with a small pumice stone.These men arent like your tenants at Lallybroch, are they?I said, voicing the thought I had had.No, he said quietly.He dipped his fingers in the basin, leaving tiny shimmering circles where the fish scales floated.Im no their laird; only the man who pays them.They like you, though, I protested, then remembered Ferguss story and amended this rather weakly to, or at least five of them do.I handed him the towel.He took it with a brief nod, and dried his hands.Looking down at the strip of cloth, he shook his head.Aye, MacLeod and the rest like me well enoughor five of them do, he repeated ironically.And theyll stand by me if its needfulfive of them.But they dinna ken me much, nor me them, save Innes.He tossed the dirty water over the side, and tucking the empty basin under his arm, turned to go below, offering me his arm.There was more died at Culloden than the Stuart cause, Sassenach, he said.Youll be coming for your dinner now?I did not find out why Innes was different, until the next week.Perhaps emboldened by the success of the purgative I had given him, Innes came voluntarily to call upon me in my cabin a week later.I am wondering, mistress, he said politely, whether there might be a medicine for something as isna there.What?I must have looked puzzled at this description, for he lifted the empty sleeve of his shirt in illustration.My arm, he explained.Its no there, as ye can plainly see.And yet it pains me something terrible sometimes.He blushed slightly.I did wonder for some years was I only a bit mad, he confided, in lowered tones.But I spoke a bit wi Mr.Murphy, and he tells me its the same with his leg that got lost, and Fergus says he wakes sometimes, feeling his missing hand slide into someones pocket.He smiled briefly, teeth a flash under his drooping mustache.So I thought maybe if it was a common thing, to feel a limb that wasnt there, perhaps there was something that might be done about it.I see.I rubbed my chin, pondering.Yes, it is common; its called a phantom limb, when you still have feelings in a part thats been lost.As for what to do about it.I frowned, trying to think whether I had ever heard of anything therapeutic for such a situation.To gain time, I asked, How did you happen to lose the arm?Oh, twas the blood poison, he said, casually.I tore a small hole in my hand wi a nail one day, and it festered.I stared at the sleeve, empty from the shoulder.I suppose it did, I said faintly.Oh, aye.It was a lucky thing, though; it was that stopped me bein transported wi the rest.The rest of whom?He looked at me, surprised.Why, the other prisoners from Ardsmuir.Did Mac Dubh not tell ye about that?When they stopped the fortress from being a prison, they sent off all of the Scottish prisoners to be indenture men in the Coloniesall but Mac Dubh, for he was a great man, and they didna want him out o their sight, and me, for Id lost the arm, and was no good for hard labor.So Mac Dubh was taken somewhere else, and I was let gopardoned and set free.So ye see, it was a most fortunate accident, save only for the pain that comes on sometimes at night.He grimaced, and made as though to rub the nonexistent arm, stopping and shrugging at me in illustration of the problem.I see.So you were with Jamie in prison.I didnt know that.I was turning through the contents of my medicine chest, wondering whether a general pain reliever like willow bark tea or horehound with fennel would work on a phantom pain.Oh, aye.Innes was losing his shyness, and beginning to speak more freely.I should have been dead of starvation by now, had Mac Dubh not come to find me, when he was released himself.He went looking for you?Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a flash of blue, and beckoned to Mr.Willoughby, who was passing by.Aye.When he was released from his parole, he came to inquire, to see whether he could trace any of the men whod been taken to Americato see whether any might have returned.He shrugged, the missing arm exaggerating the gesture.But there were none in Scotland, save me.I see.Mr.Willoughby, have you a notion what might be done about this?Motioning to the Chinese to come and look, I explained the problem, and was pleased to hear that he did indeed have a notion.We stripped Innes of his shirt once again, and I watched, taking careful notes, as Mr.Willoughby pressed hard with his fingers at certain spots on the neck and torso, explaining as best he might what he was doing.Arm is in the ghost world, he explained.Body not; here in upper world.Arm tries to come back, for it does not like to be away from body.This An mopress pressthis stops pain.But also we tell arm not come back.And how dye do that?Innes was becoming interested in the procedure.Most of the crew would not let Mr.Willoughby touch them, regarding him as heathen, unclean, and a pervert to boot, but Innes had known and worked with the Chinese for the last two years.Mr.Willoughby shook his head, lacking words, and burrowed in my medicine box.He came up with the bottle of dried hot peppers, and shaking out a careful handful, put it into a small dish.Have fire?he inquired.I had a flint and steel, and with these he succeeded in kindling a spark to ignite the dried herb.The pungent smell filled the cabin, and we all watched as a small plume of white rose up from the dish and formed a small, hovering cloud over the dish.Send smoke of fan jiao messenger to ghost world, speak arm, Mr.Willoughby explained.Inflating his lungs and puffing out his cheeks like a blowfish, he blew lustily at the cloud, dispersing it.Then, without pausing, he turned and spat copiously on Inness stump.Why, ye heathen bugger!Innes cried, eyes bulging with fury.Dye dare spit on me?Spit on ghost, Mr.Willoughby explained, taking three quick steps backward, toward the door.Ghost afraid spittle.Not come back now right away.I laid a restraining hand on Inness remaining arm.Does your missing arm hurt now?I asked.The rage began to fade from his face as he thought about it.Wellno, he admitted.Then he scowled at Mr.Willoughby.But that doesna mean Ill have ye spit on me whenever the fancy takes ye, ye wee poutworm!Oh, no, Mr.Willoughby said, quite cool.I not spit.You spit now.Scare you own ghost.Innes scratched his head, not sure whether to be angry or amused.Well, I will be damned, he said finally.He shook his head, and picking up his shirt, pulled it on.Still, he said, I think perhaps next time, Ill try your tea, Mistress Fraser.44  FORCES OF NATURE  I, said Jamie, am a fool.He spoke broodingly, watching Fergus and Marsali, who were absorbed in close conversation by the rail on the opposite side of the ship.What makes you think so?I asked, though I had a reasonably good idea.The fact that all four of the married persons aboard were living in unwilling celibacy had given rise to a certain air of suppressed amusement among the members of the crew, whose celibacy was involuntary.I have spent twenty years longing to have ye in my bed, he said, verifying my assumption, and within a month of having ye back again, Ive arranged matters so that I canna even kiss ye without sneakin behind a hatch cover, and even then, half the time I look round to find Fergus looking cross eyed down his nose at me, the little bastard!And no one to blame for it but my own foolishness.What did I think I was doing?he demanded rhetorically, glaring at the pair across the way, who were nuzzling each other with open affection.Well, Marsali is only fifteen, I said mildly.I expect you thought you were being fatherlyor stepfatherly.Aye, I did.He looked down at me with a grudging smile.The reward for my tender concern being that I canna even touch my own wife!Oh, you can touch me, I said.I took one of his hands, caressing the palm gently with my thumb.You just cant engage in acts of unbridled carnality.We had had a few abortive attempts along those lines, all frustrated by either the inopportune arrival of a crew member or the sheer uncongeniality of any nook aboard the Artemis sufficiently secluded as to be private.One late night foray into the after hold had ended abruptly when a large rat had leapt from a stack of hides onto Jamies bare shoulder, sending me into hysterics and depriving Jamie abruptly of any desire to continue what he was doing.He glanced down at our linked hands, where my thumb continued to make secret love to his palm, and narrowed his eyes at me, but let me continue.He closed his fingers gently round my hand, his own thumb feather light on my pulse.The simple fact was that we couldnt keep our hands off each otherno more than Fergus and Marsali coulddespite the fact that we knew very well such behavior would lead only to greater frustration.Aye, well, in my own defense, I meant well, he said ruefully, smiling down into my eyes.Well, you know what they say about good intentions.What do they say?His thumb was stroking gently up and down my wrist, sending small fluttering sensations through the pit of my stomach.I thought it must be true what Mr.Willoughby said, about sensations on one part of the body affecting another.They pave the road to Hell.I gave his hand a squeeze, and tried to take mine away, but he wouldnt let go.Mmphm.His eyes were on Fergus, who was teasing Marsali with an albatrosss feather, holding her by one arm and tickling her beneath the chin as she struggled ineffectually to get away.Verra true, he said.I meant to make sure the lass had a chance to think what she was about before the matter was too late for mending.The end result of my interference being that I lie awake half the night trying not to think about you, and listening to Fergus lust across the cabin, and come up in the morning to find the crew all grinning in their beards whenever they see me.He aimed a vicious glare at Maitland, who was passing by.The beardless cabin boy looked startled, and edged carefully away, glancing nervously back over his shoulder.How do you hear someone lust?I asked, fascinated.He glanced down at me, looking mildly flustered.Oh!Wellits only  He paused for a moment, then rubbed the bridge of his nose, which was beginning to redden in the sharp breeze.Have ye any idea what men in a prison do, Sassenach, having no women for a verra long time?I could guess, I said, thinking that perhaps I didnt really want to hear, firsthand.He hadnt spoken to me before about his time in Ardsmuir.I imagine ye could, he said dryly.And yed be right, too.Theres the three choices; use each other, go a bit mad, or deal with the matter by yourself, aye?He turned to look out to sea, and bent his head slightly to look down at me, a slight smile visible on his lips.Dye think me mad, Sassenach?Not most of the time, I replied honestly, turning round beside him.He laughed and shook his head ruefully.No, I dinna seem able to manage it.I now and then wished I could go madhe said thoughtfully it seemed a great deal easier than having always to think what to do nextbut it doesna seem to come natural to me.Nor does buggery, he added, with a wry twist of his mouth.No, I shouldnt think so.Men who might in the ordinary way recoil in horror from the thought of using another man could still bring themselves to the act, out of desperate need.Not Jamie.Knowing what I did of his experiences at the hands of Jack Randall, I suspected that he very likely would have gone mad before seeking such resort himself.He shrugged slightly, and stood silent, looking out to sea.Then he glanced down at his hands, spread before him, clutching the rail.I fought themthe soldiers who took me.Id promised Jenny I wouldntshe thought theyd hurt mebut when the time came, I couldna seem to help it.He shrugged again, and slowly opened and closed his right hand.It was his crippled hand, the third finger marked by a thick scar that ran the length of the first two joints, the fourth fingers second joint fused into stiffness, so that the finger stuck out awkwardly, even when he made a fist.I broke this again then, against a dragoons jaw, he said ruefully, waggling the finger slightly.That was the third time; the second was at Culloden.I didna mind it much.But they put me in chains, and I minded that a great deal.Id think you would.It was hardnot difficult, but surprisingly painfulto think of that lithe, powerful body subdued by metal, bound and humbled.Theres nay privacy in prison, he said.I minded that more than the fetters, I think.Day and night, always in sight of someone, wi no guard for your thoughts but to feign sleep.As for the other He snorted briefly, and shoved the loose hair back behind his ear.Well, ye wait for the light to go, for the only modesty there is, is darkness.The cells were not large, and the men lay close together for warmth in the night.With no modesty save darkness, and no privacy save silence, it was impossible to remain unaware of the accommodation each man made to his own needs.I was in irons for more than a year, Sassenach, he said.He lifted his arms, spread them eighteen inches apart, and stopped abruptly, as though reaching some invisible limit.I could move that farand nay more, he said, staring at his immobile hands.And I couldna move my hands at all without the chain makin a sound.Torn between shame and need, he would wait in the dark, breathing in the stale and brutish scent of the surrounding men, listening to the murmurous breath of his companions, until the stealthy sounds nearby told him that the telltale clinking of his irons would be ignored.If theres one thing I ken verra well, Sassenach, he said quietly, with a brief glance at Fergus, its the sound of a man makin love to a woman whos not there.He shrugged and jerked his hands suddenly, spreading them wide on the rail, bursting his invisible chains.He looked down at me then with a half smile, and I saw the dark memories at the back of his eyes, under the mocking humor.I saw too the terrible need there, the desire strong enough to have endured loneliness and degradation, squalor and separation.We stood quite still, looking at each other, oblivious of the deck traffic passing by.He knew better than any man how to hide his thoughts, but he wasnt hiding them from me.The hunger in him went bone deep, and my own bones seemed to dissolve in recognition of it.His hand was an inch from mine, resting on the wooden rail, long fingered and powerful.If I touched him, I thought suddenly, he would turn and take me, here, on the deck boards.As though hearing my thought, he took my hand suddenly, pressing it tight against the hard muscle of his thigh.How many times have we lain together, since ye came back to me?he whispered.Once, twice, in the brothel.Three times in the heather.And then at Lallybroch, again in Paris.His fingers tapped lightly against my wrist, one after the other, in time with my pulse.Each time, I left your bed as hungry as ever I came to it.It takes no more to ready me now than the scent of your hair brushing past my face, or the feel of your thigh against mine when we sit to eat.And to see ye stand on deck, wi the wind pressing your gown tight to your body  The corner of his mouth twitched slightly as he looked at me.I could see the pulse beat strong in the hollow of his throat, his skin flushed with wind and desire.There are moments, Sassenach, when for one copper penny, Id have ye on the spot, back against the mast and your skirts about your waist, and devil take the bloody crew!My fingers convulsed against his palm, and he tightened his grasp, nodding pleasantly in response to the greeting of the gunner, coming past on his way toward the quarter gallery.The bell for the Captains dinner sounded beneath my feet, a sweet metallic vibration that traveled up through the soles of my feet and melted the marrow of my bones.Fergus and Marsali left their play and went below, and the crew began preparations for the changing of the watch, but we stayed standing by the rail, fixed in each others eyes, burning.The Captains compliments, Mr.Fraser, and will you be joining him for dinner?It was Maitland, the cabin boy, keeping a cautious distance as he relayed this message.Jamie took a deep breath, and pulled his eyes away from mine.Aye, Mr.Maitland, well be there directly.He took another breath, settled his coat on his shoulders, and offered me his arm.Shall we go below, Sassenach?Just a minute.I drew my hand out of my pocket, having found what I was looking for.I took his hand and pressed the object into his palm.He stared down at the image of King George III in his hand, then up at me.On account, I said.Lets go and eat.The next day found us on deck again; though the air was still chilly, the cold was far preferable to the stuffiness of the cabins.We took our usual path, down one side of the ship and up the other, but then Jamie stopped, pausing to lean against the rail as he told me some anecdote about the printing business.A few feet away, Mr.Willoughby sat cross legged in the protection of the mainmast, a small cake of wet black ink by the toe of his slipper and a large sheet of white paper on the deck before him.The tip of his brush touched the paper lightly as a butterfly, leaving surprising strong shapes behind.As I watched, fascinated, he began again at the top of the page.He worked rapidly, with a sureness of stroke that was like watching a dancer or a fencer, sure of his ground.One of the deckhands passed dangerously close to the edge of the paper, almostbut not quiteplacing a large dirty foot on the snowy white.A few moments later, another man did the same thing, though there was plenty of room to pass by.Then the first man came back, this time careless enough to kick over the small cake of black ink as he passed.Tck!the seaman exclaimed in annoyance.He scuffed at the black splotch on the otherwise immaculate deck.Filthy heathen!Look ere, wot hes done!The second man, returning from his brief errand, paused in interest.On the clean deck?Captain Raines wont be pleased, will he?He nodded at Mr.Willoughby, mock jovial.Best hurry and lick it up, little fella, before the Captain comes.Aye, thatll do; lick it up.Quick, now!The first man moved a step nearer the seated figure, his shadow falling on the page like a blot.Mr.Willoughbys lips tightened just a shade, but he didnt look up.He completed the second column, righted the ink cake and dipped his brush without taking his eyes from the page, and began a third column, hand moving steadily.I said, began the first seaman, loudly, but stopped in surprise as a large white handkerchief fluttered down on the deck in front of him, covering the inkblot.Your pardon, gentlemen, said Jamie.I seem to have dropped something.With a cordial nod to the seamen, he bent down and swept up the handkerchief, leaving nothing but a faint smear on the decking.The seamen glanced at each other, uncertain, then at Jamie.One man caught sight of the blue eyes over the blandly smiling mouth, and blanched visibly.He turned hastily away, tugging at his mates arm.Norratall, sir, he mumbled.Cmon, Joe, were wanted aft.Jamie didnt look either at the departing seamen or at Mr.Willoughby, but came toward me, tucking his handkerchief back in his sleeve.A verra pleasant day, is it not, Sassenach?he said.He threw back his head, inhaling deeply.Refreshing air, aye?More so for some than for others, I expect, I said, amused.The air at this particular spot on deck smelled rather strongly of the alum tanned hides in the hold below.That was kind of you, I said as he leaned back against the rail next to me.Do you think I should offer Mr.Willoughby the use of my cabin to write?Jamie snorted briefly.No.Ive told him he can use my cabin, or the table in the mess between meals, but hed rather be herestubborn wee fool that he is.Well, I suppose the lights better, I said dubiously, eyeing the small hunched figure, crouched doggedly against the mast.As I watched, a gust of wind lifted the edge of the paper; Mr.Willoughby pinned it at once, holding it still with one hand while continuing his short, sure brushstrokes with the other.It doesnt look comfortable, though.Its not.Jamie ran his fingers through his hair in mild exasperation.He does it on purpose, to provoke the crew.Well, if thats what hes after, hes doing a good job, I observed.What on earth for, though?Jamie leaned back against the rail beside me, and snorted once more.Aye, well, thats complicated.Ever met a Chinaman before, have ye?A few, but I suspect theyre a bit different in my time, I said dryly.They tend not to wear pigtails and silk pajamas, for one thing, nor do they have obsessions about ladies feetor if they did, they didnt tell me about it, I added, to be fair.Jamie laughed and moved a few inches closer, so that his hand on the rail brushed mine.Well, its to do wi the feet, he said.Or thats the start of it, anyway.See, Josie, whos one of the whores at Madame Jeannes, told Gordon about it, and of course hes told everyone now.What on earth is it about the feet?I demanded, curiosity becoming overwhelming.What does he do to them?Jamie coughed, and a faint flush rose in his cheeks.Well, its a bit  You couldnt possibly tell me anything that would shock me, I assured him.I have seen quite a lot of things in my life, you knowand a good many of them with you, come to that.I suppose ye have, at that, he said, grinning.Aye, well, its no so much what he does, butwell, in China, the highborn ladies have their feet bound.Ive heard of that, I said, wondering what all the fuss was about.Its supposed to make their feet small and graceful.Jamie snorted again.Graceful, aye?Dye know how its done?And proceeded to tell me.They take a tiny lassienay more than a year old, aye?and turn under the toes of her feet until they touch her heel, then tie bandages about the foot to hold it so.Ouch!I said involuntarily.Yes, indeed, he said dryly.Her nanny will take the bandages off now and then to clean the foot, but puts them back directly.After some time, her wee toes rot and fall off.And by the time shes grown, the poor lassies little more at the end of her legs than a crumple of bones and skin, smaller than the size o my fist.His closed fist knocked softly against the wood of the rail in illustration.But shes considered verra beautiful, then, he ended.Graceful, as ye say.Thats perfectly disgusting!I said.But what has that got to do with I glanced at Mr.Willoughby, but he gave no sign of hearing us; the wind was blowing from him toward us, carrying our words out to sea.Say this was a lassies foot, Sassenach, he said, stretching his right hand out flat before him.Curl the toes under to touch the heel, and what have ye in the middle?He curled his fingers loosely into a fist in illustration.What?I said, bewildered.Jamie extended the middle finger of his left hand, and thrust it abruptly through the center of his fist in an unmistakably graphic gesture.A hole, he said succinctly.Youre kidding!Thats why they do it?His forehead furrowed slightly, then relaxed.Oh, am I jesting?By no means, Sassenach.He sayshe nodded delicately at Mr.Willoughbythat its a most remarkable sensation.To a man.Why, that perverted little beast!Jamie laughed at my indignation.Aye, well, thats about what the crew thinks, too.Of course, he canna get quite the same effect wi a European woman, but I gather hetries, now and then.I began to understand the general feeling of hostility toward the little Chinese.Even a short acquaintance with the crew of the Artemis had taught me that seamen on the whole tended to be gallant creatures, with a strong romantic streak where women were concernedno doubt because they did without female company for a good part of the year.Hm, I said, with a glance of suspicion at Mr.Willoughby.Well, that explains them, all right, but what about him?Thats whats a wee bit complicated.Jamies mouth curled upward in a wry smile.See, to Mr.Yi Tien Cho, late of the Heavenly Kingdom of China, were the barbarians.Is that so?I glanced up at Brodie Cooper, coming down the ratlines above, the filthy, calloused soles of his feet all that was visible from below.I rather thought both sides had a point.Even you?Oh, aye.Im a filthy, bad smelling gwao fethat means a foreign devil, ye kenwi the stink of a weaselI think thats what huang shu lang meansand a face like a gargoyle, he finished cheerfully.He told you all that?It seemed an odd recompense for saving someones life.Jamie glanced down at me, cocking one eyebrow.Have ye noticed, maybe, that verra small men will say anything to ye, when theyve drink taken?he asked.I think brandy makes them forget their size; they think theyre great hairy brutes, and swagger something fierce.He nodded at Mr.Willoughby, industriously painting.Hes a bit more circumspect when hes sober, but it doesna change what he thinks.It fair galls him, aye?Especially knowing that if it wasna for me, someone would likely knock him on the head or put him through the window into the sea some quiet night.He spoke with simple matter of factness, but I hadnt missed the sideways looks directed at us by the passing seamen, and had already realized just why Jamie was passing time in idle conversation by the rail with me.If anyone had been in doubt about Mr.Willoughbys being under Jamies protection, they would be rapidly disabused of the notion.So you saved his life, gave him work, and keep him out of trouble, and he insults you and thinks youre an ignorant barbarian, I said dryly.Sweet little fellow.Aye, well.The wind had shifted slightly, blowing a lock of Jamies hair free across his face.He thumbed it back behind his ear and leaned farther toward me, our shoulders nearly touching.Let him say what he likes; Im the only one who understands him.Really?I laid a hand over Jamies where it rested on the rail.Well, maybe not to say understand him, he admitted.He looked down at the deck between his feet.But I do remember, he said softly, what its like to have nothing but your prideand a friend.I remembered what Innes had said, and wondered whether it was the one armed man who had been his friend in time of need.I knew what he meant; I had had Joe Abernathy, and knew what a difference it made.Yes, I had a friend at the hospital I began, but was interrupted by loud exclamations of disgust emanating from under my feet.Damn!Blazing Hades!That filth eating son of a pig fart!I looked down, startled, then realized, from the muffled Irish oaths proceeding from below, that we were standing directly over the galley.The shouting was loud enough to attract attention from the hands forward, and a small group of sailors gathered with us, watching in fascination as the cooks black kerchiefed head poked out of the hatchway, glaring ferociously at the crowd.Burry arsed swabs!he shouted.Whatre ye lookin at?Two of yer idle barsteds tumble arse down here and toss this muck over the side!Dye mean me to be climbin ladders all day, and me with half a leg?The head disappeared abruptly, and with a good natured shrug, Picard motioned to one of the younger sailors to come along below.Shortly there was a confusion of voices and a bumping of some large object down below, and a terrible smell assaulted my nostrils.Jesus Christ on a piece of toast!I snatched a handkerchief from my pocket and clapped it to my nose; this wasnt the first smell I had encountered afloat, and I usually kept a linen square soaked in wintergreen in my pocket, as a precaution.Whats that?By the smell of it, dead horse.A verra old horse, at that, and a long time dead.Jamies long, thin nose looked a trifle pinched around the nostrils, and all around, sailors were gagging, holding their noses, and generally commenting unfavorably on the smell.Maitland and Grosman, faces averted from their burden, but slightly green nonetheless, manhandled a large cask through the hatchway and onto the deck.The top had been split, and I caught a brief glimpse of a yellowish white mass in the opening, glistening faintly in the sun.It seemed to be moving.Maggots, in profusion.Eew!The exclamation was jerked from me involuntarily.The two sailors said nothing, their lips being pressed tightly together, but both of them looked as though they agreed with me.Together, they manhandled the cask to the rail and heaved it up and over.Such of the crew as were not otherwise employed gathered at the rail to watch the cask bobbing in the wake, and be entertained by Murphys outspokenly blasphemous opinion of the ships chandler who had sold it to him.Manzetti, a small Italian seaman with a thick russet pigtail, was standing by the rail, loading a musket.Shark, he explained with a gleam of teeth beneath his mustache, seeing me watching him.Very good to eat.Ar, said Sturgis approvingly.Such of the crew as were not presently occupied gathered at the stern, watching.There were sharks, I knew; Maitland had pointed out to me two dark, flexible shapes hovering in the shadow of the hull the evening before, keeping pace with the ship with no apparent effort save a small and steady oscillation of sickled tails.There!A shout went up from several throats as the cask jerked suddenly in the water.A pause, and Manzetti fixed his aim carefully in the vicinity of the floating cask.Another jerk, as though something had bumped it violently, and another.The water was a muddy gray, but clear enough for me to catch a glimpse of something moving under the surface, fast.Another jerk, the cask heeled to one side, and suddenly the sharp edge of a fin creased the surface of the water, and a gray back showed briefly, tiny waves purling off it.The musket discharged next to me with a small roar and a cloud of black powder smoke that left my eyes stinging.There was a universal shout from the observers, and when the watering of my eyes subsided, I could see a small brownish stain spreading round the cask.Did he hit the shark, or the horsemeat?I asked Jamie, in a low voiced aside.The cask, he said with a smile.Still, its fine shooting.Several more shots went wild, while the cask began to dance an agitated jig, the frenzied sharks striking it repeatedly.Bits of white and brown flew from the broken cask, and a large circle of grease, rotten blood, and debris spread round the sharks feast.As though by magic, seabirds began to appear, one and two at a time, diving for tidbits.No good, said Manzetti at last, lowering the musket and wiping his face with his sleeve.Too far.He was sweating and stained from neck to hairline with black powder; the wiping left a streak of white across his eyes, like a raccoons mask.I could relish a slab of shark, said the Captains voice near my ear.I turned to see him peering thoughtfully over the rail at the scene of carnage.Perhaps we might lower a boat, Mr.Picard.The bosun turned with an obliging roar, and the Artemis hauled her wind, coming round in a small circle to draw near the remains of the floating cask.A small boat was launched, containing Manzetti, with musket, and three seamen armed with gaffs and rope.By the time they reached the spot, there was nothing left of the cask but a few shattered bits of wood.There was still plenty of activity, though; the water roiled with the sharks thrashing beneath the surface, and the scene was nearly obscured by a raucous cloud of seabirds.As I watched, I saw a pointed snout rise suddenly from the water, mouth open, seize one of the birds and disappear beneath the waves, all in the flick of an eyelash.Did you see that?I said, awed.I was aware, in a general way, that sharks were well equipped with teeth, but this practical demonstration was more striking than any number of National Geographic photographs.Why, Grandmother dear, what big teeth ye have!said Jamie, sounding suitably impressed.Oh, they do indeed, said a genial voice nearby.I glanced aside to find Murphy grinning at my elbow, broad face shining with a savage glee.Little good it will do the buggers, with a ball blown clean through their fucking brains!He pounded a hamlike fist on the rail, and shouted, Get me one of them jagged buggers, Manzetti!Theres a bottle o cookin brandy waitin if ye do!Is it a personal matter to ye, Mr.Murphy?Jamie asked politely.Or professional concern?Both, Mr.Fraser, both, the cook replied, watching the hunt with a fierce attention.He kicked his wooden leg against the side, with a hollow clunk.Theyve had a taste o me, he said with grim relish, but Ive tasted a good many more o them!The boat was barely visible through the flapping screen of birds, and their screams made it hard to hear anything other than Murphys war cries.Shark steak with mustard!Murphy was bellowing, eyes mere slits in an ecstasy of revenge.Stewed liver wi piccalilli!Ill make soup o yer fins, and jelly yer eyeballs in sherry wine, ye wicked barsted!I saw Manzetti, kneeling in the bows, take aim with his musket, and the puff of black smoke as he fired.And then I saw Mr.Willoughby.I hadnt seen him jump from the rail; no one had, with all eyes fixed on the hunt.But there he was, some distance away from the melee surrounding the boat, his shaven head glistening like a fishing float as he wrestled in the water with an enormous bird, its wings churning the water like an eggbeater.Alerted by my cry, Jamie tore his eyes from the hunt, goggled for an instant, and before I could move or speak, was perched on the rail himself.My shout of horror coincided with a surprised roar from Murphy, but Jamie was gone, too, lancing into the water near the Chinaman with barely a splash.There were shouts and cries from the deckand a shrill screech from Marsalias everyone realized what had happened.Jamies wet red head emerged next to Mr.Willoughby, and in seconds, he had an arm tight about the Chinamans throat.Mr.Willoughby clung tightly to the bird, and I wasnt sure, just for the moment, whether Jamie intended rescue or throttling, but then he kicked strongly, and began to tow the struggling mass of bird and man back toward the ship.Triumphant shouts from the boat, and a spreading circle of deep red in the water.There was a tremendous thrashing as one shark was gaffed and hauled behind the small boat by a rope about its tail.Then everything was confusion, as the men in the boat noticed what else was going on in the water nearby.Lines were thrown over one side and then the other, and crewmen rushed back and forth in high excitement, undecided whether to help with rescue or shark, but at last Jamie and his burdens were hauled in to starboard, and dumped dripping on the deck, while the captured sharkseveral large bites taken out of its body by its hungry companionswas drawn in, still feebly snapping, to port.JesusChrist, Jamie said, chest heaving.He lay flat on the deck, gasping like a landed fish.Are you all right?I knelt beside him, and wiped the water off his face with the hem of my skirt.He gave me a lopsided smile and nodded, still gasping.Jesus, he said at last, sitting up.He shook his head and sneezed.I thought I was eaten, sure.Those fools in the boat started toward us, and there were sharks all round them, under the water, bitin at the gaffed one.He tenderly massaged his calves.Its nay doubt oversensitive of me, Sassenach, but Ive always dreaded the thought of losing a leg.It seems almost worse than bein killed outright.Id as soon you didnt do either, I said dryly.He was beginning to shiver; I pulled off my shawl and wrapped it around his shoulders, then looked about for Mr.Willoughby.The little Chinese, still clinging stubbornly to his prize, a young pelican nearly as big as he was, ignored both Jamie and the considerable abuse flung in his direction.He squelched below, dripping, protected from physical castigation by the clacking bill of his captive, which discouraged anyone from getting too close to him.A nasty chunking sound and a crow of triumph from the other side of the deck announced Murphys use of an ax to dispatch his erstwhile nemesis.The seamen clustered round the corpse, knives drawn, to get pieces of the skin.Further enthusiastic chopping, and Murphy came strolling past, beaming, a choice section of tail under his arm, the huge yellow liver hanging from one hand in a bag of netting, and the bloody ax slung over his shoulder.Not drowned, are ye?he said, ruffling Jamies damp hair with his spare hand.I cant see why yed bother wi the little bugger, myself, but Ill say twas bravely done.Ill brew ye up a fine broth from the tail, to keep off the chill, he promised, and stumped off, planning menus aloud.Why did he do it?I asked.Mr.Willoughby, I mean.Jamie shook his head and blew his nose on his shirttail.Damned if I know.He wanted the bird, I expect, but I couldna say why.To eat, maybe?Murphy overheard this and swung round at the head of the galley ladder, frowning.Ye cant eat pelicans, he said, shaking his head in disapproval.Fishy tasting, no matter how ye cook em.And God knows what ones doing out here anyway; theyre shorebirds, pelicans.Blown out by a storm I suppose.Awkward buggers.His bald head disappeared into his realm, murmuring happily of dried parsley and cayenne.Jamie laughed and stood up.Aye, well, perhaps its only he wants the feathers to make quills of.Come along below, Sassenach.Ye can help me dry my back.He had spoken jokingly, but as soon as the words were out of his mouth, his face went blank.He glanced quickly to port, where the crew was arguing and jostling over the remains of the shark, while Fergus and Marsali cautiously examined the severed head, lying gape jawed on the deck.Then his eyes met mine, with a perfect understanding.Thirty seconds later, we were below in his cabin.Cold drops from his wet hair rained over my shoulders and slid down my bosom, but his mouth was hot and urgent.The hard curves of his back glowed warm through the soaked fabric of the shirt that stuck to them.Ifrinn!he said breathlessly, breaking loose long enough to yank at his breeches.Christ, theyre stuck to me!I canna get them off!Snorting with laughter, he jerked at the laces, but the water had soaked them into a hopeless knot.A knife!I said.Wheres a knife?Snorting myself at the sight of him, struggling frantically to get his drenched shirttail out of his breeches, I began to rummage through the drawers of the desk, tossing out bits of paper, bottle of ink, a snuffboxeverything but a knife.The closest thing was an ivory letter opener, made in the shape of a hand with a pointing finger.I seized upon this and grasped him by the waistband, trying to saw at the tangled laces.He yelped in alarm and backed away.Christ, be careful wi that, Sassenach!Its no going to do ye any good to get my breeks off, and ye geld me in the process!Half crazed with lust as we were, that seemed funny enough to double us both up laughing.Here!Rummaging in the chaos of his berth, he snatched up his dirk and brandished it triumphantly.An instant later, the laces were severed and the sopping breeks lay puddled on the floor.He seized me, picked me up bodily, and laid me on the desk, heedless of crumpled papers and scattered quills.Tossing my skirts up past my waist, he grabbed my hips and half lay on me, his hard thighs forcing my legs apart.It was like grasping a salamander; a blaze of heat in a chilly shroud.I gasped as the tail of his sopping shirt touched my bare belly, then gasped again as I heard footsteps in the passage.Stop!I hissed in his ear.Someones coming!Too late, he said, with breathless certainty.I must have ye, or die.He took me, with one quick, ruthless thrust, and I bit his shoulder hard, tasting salt and wet linen, but he made no sound.Two strokes, three, and I had my legs locked tight around his buttocks, my cry muffled in his shirt, not caring either who else might be coming.He had me, quickly and thoroughly, and thrust himself home, and home, and home again, with a deep sound of triumph in his throat, shuddering and shaking in my arms.Two minutes later, the cabin door swung open.Innes looked slowly round the wreckage of the room.His soft brown gaze traveled from the ravaged desk to me, sitting damp and disheveled, but respectably clothed, upon the berth, and rested at last on Jamie, who sat collapsed on a stool, still clad in his wet shirt, chest heaving and the deep red color fading slowly from his face.Inness nostrils flared delicately, but he said nothing.He walked into the cabin, nodding at me, and bent to reach under Ferguss berth, whence he pulled out a bottle of brandywine.For the Chinee, he said to me.So as he mightnt take a chill.He turned toward the door and paused, squinting thoughtfully at Jamie.Ye might should have Mr.Murphy make ye some broth on that same account, Mac Dubh.They do say as tis dangerous to get chilled after hard work, aye?Ye dinna want to take the ague.There was a faint twinkle in the mournful brown depths.Jamie brushed back the salty tangle of his hair, a slow smile spreading across his face.Aye, well, and if it should come to that, Innes, at least I shall die a happy man.We found out the next day what Mr.Willoughby wanted the pelican for.I found him on the afterdeck, the bird perched on a sail chest beside him, its wings bound tight to its body by means of strips of cloth.It glared at me with round yellow eyes, and clacked its bill in warning.Mr.Willoughby was pulling in a line, on the end of which was a small, wriggling purple squid.Detaching this, he held it up in front of the pelican and said something in Chinese.The bird regarded him with deep suspicion, but didnt move.Quickly, he seized the upper bill in his hand, pulled it up, and tossed the squid into the birds pouch.The pelican, looking surprised, gulped convulsively and swallowed it.Hao liao, Mr.Willoughby said approvingly, stroking the birds head.He saw me watching, and beckoned me to come closer.Keeping a cautious eye on the wicked bill, I did so.Ping An, he said, indicating the pelican.Peaceful one.The bird erected a small crest of white feathers, for all the world as though it were pricking up its ears at its name, and I laughed.Really?What are you going to do with him?I teach him hunt for me, the little Chinese said matter of factly.You watch.I did.After several more squid and a couple of small fish had been caught and fed to the pelican, Mr.Willoughby removed another strip of soft cloth from the recesses of his costume, and wrapped this snugly round the birds neck.Not want choke, he explained.Not swallow fish.He then tied a length of light line tightly to this collar, motioned to me to stand back, and with a swift jerk, released the bindings that held the birds wings.Surprised at the sudden freedom, the pelican waddled back and forth on the locker, flapped its huge bony wings once or twice, and then shot into the sky in an explosion of feathers.A pelican on the ground is a comical thing, all awkward angles, splayed feet, and gawky bill.A soaring pelican, circling over water, is a thing of wonder, graceful and primitive, startling as a pterodactyl among the sleeker forms of gulls and petrels.Ping An, the peaceful one, soared to the limit of his line, struggled to go higher, then, as though resigned, began to circle.Mr.Willoughby, eyes squinted nearly shut against the sun, spun slowly round and round on the deck below, playing the pelican like a kite.All the hands in the rigging and on deck nearby stopped what they were doing to watch in fascination.Sudden as a bolt from a crossbow, the pelican folded its wings and dived, cleaving the water with scarcely a splash.As it popped to the surface, looking mildly surprised, Mr.Willoughby began to tow it in.Aboard once more, the pelican was persuaded with some difficulty to give up its catch, but at last suffered its captor to reach cautiously into the leathery subgular pouch and extract a fine, fat sea bream.Mr.Willoughby smiled pleasantly at a gawking Picard, took out a small knife, and slit the still living fish down the back.Pinioning the bird in one wiry arm, he loosened the collar with his other hand, and offered it a flapping piece of bream, which Ping An eagerly snatched from his fingers and gulped.His, Mr.Willoughby explained, wiping blood and scales carelessly on the leg of his trousers.Mine, nodding toward the half fish still sitting on the locker, now motionless.Within a week, the pelican was entirely tame, able to fly free, collared, but without the tethering line, returning to his master to regurgitate a pouchful of shining fish at his feet.When not fishing, Ping An either took up a position on the crosstrees, much to the displeasure of the crewmen responsible for swabbing the deck beneath, or followed Mr.Willoughby around the deck, waddling absurdly from side to side, eight foot wings half spread for balance.The crew, both impressed by the fishing and wary of Ping Ans great snapping bill, steered clear of Mr.Willoughby, who made his words each day beside the mast, weather permitting, secure under the benign yellow eye of his new friend.I paused one day to watch Mr.Willoughby at his work, staying out of sight behind the shelter of the mast.He sat for a moment, a look of quiet satisfaction on his face, contemplating the finished page.I couldnt read the characters, of course, but the shape of the whole thing was somehow very pleasing to look at.Then he glanced quickly around, as though checking to see that no one was coming, picked up the brush, and with great care, added a final character, in the upper left corner of the page.Without asking, I knew it was his signature.He sighed then, and lifted his face to look out over the rail.Not inscrutable, by any means, his expression was filled with a dreaming delight, and I knew that whatever he saw, it was neither the ship, nor the heaving ocean beyond.At last, he sighed again and shook his head, as though to himself.He laid hands on the paper, and quickly, gently, folded it, once, and twice, and again.Then rising to his feet, he went to the rail, extended his hands over the water, and let the folded white shape fall.It tumbled toward the water.Then the wind caught it and whirled it upward, a bit of white receding in the distance, looking much like the gulls and terns who squawked behind the ship in search of scraps.Mr.Willoughby didnt stay to watch it, but turned away from the rail and went below, the dream still stamped on his small, round face.45  MR.WILLOUGHBYS TALE  As we passed the center of the Atlantic gyre and headed south, the days and evenings became warm, and the off duty crew began to congregate on the forecastle for a time after supper, to sing songs, dance to Brodie Coopers fiddle, or listen to stories.With the same instinct that makes children camping in the wood tell ghost stories, the men seemed particularly fond of horrible tales of shipwreck and the perils of the sea.As we passed farther south, and out the realm of Kraken and sea serpent, the mood for monsters passed, and the men began instead to tell stories of their homes.It was after most of these had been exhausted that Maitland, the cabin boy, turned to Mr.Willoughby, crouched as usual against the foot of the mast, with his cup cradled to his chest.How was it that you came from China, Willoughby?Maitland asked curiously.Ive not seen more than a handful of Chinese sailors, though folk do say as theres a great many people in China.Is it such a fine place that the inhabitants dont care to take leave of it, perhaps?At first demurring, the little Chinese seemed mildly flattered at the interest provoked by this question.With a bit more urging, he consented to tell of his departure from his homelandrequiring only that Jamie should translate for him, his own English being inadequate to the task.Jamie readily agreeing, he sat down beside Mr.Willoughby, and cocked his head to listen.I was a Mandarin, Mr.Willoughby began, in Jamies voice, a Mandarin of letters, one gifted in composition.I wore a silk gown, embroidered in very many colors, and over this, the scholars blue silk gown, with the badge of my office embroidered upon breast and backthe figure of a feng huanga bird of fire.I think he means a phoenix, Jamie added, turning to me for a moment before directing his attention back to the patiently waiting Mr.Willoughby, who began speaking again at once.I was born in Pekin, the Imperial City of the Son of Heaven  That is how they call their emperor, Fergus whispered to me.Such presumption, to equate their king with the Lord Jesus!Shh, hissed several people, turning indignant faces toward Fergus.He made a rude gesture at Maxwell Gordon, but fell silent, turning back to the small figure sitting crouched against the mast.I was found early to have some skill in composition, and while I was not at first adept in the use of brush and ink, I learned at last with great effort to make the representations of my brush resemble the ideas that danced like cranes within my mind.And so I came to the notice of Wu Xien, a Mandarin of the Imperial Household, who took me to live with him, and oversaw my training.I rose rapidly in merit and eminence, so that before my twenty sixth birthday, I had attained a globe of red coral upon my hat.And then came an evil wind, that blew the seeds of misfortune into my garden.It may be that I was cursed by an enemy, or perhaps that in my arrogance I had omitted to make proper sacrificefor surely I was not lacking in reverence to my ancestors, being careful always to visit my familys tomb each year, and to have joss sticks always burning in the Hall of Ancestors  If his compositions were always so long winded, no doubt the Son of Heaven lost patience and tossed him in the river, Fergus muttered cynically.but whatever the cause, Jamies voice continued, my poetry came before the eyes of Wan Mei, the Emperors Second Wife.Second Wife was a woman of great power, having borne no less than four sons, and when she asked that I might become part of her own household, the request was granted at once.And what was wrong wi that?demanded Gordon, leaning forward in interest.A chance to get on in the world, surely?Mr.Willoughby evidently understood the question, for he nodded in Gordons direction as he continued, and Jamies voice took up the story.Oh, the honor was inestimable; I should have had a large house of my own within the walls of the palace, and a guard of soldiers to escort my palanquin, with a triple umbrella borne before me in symbol of my office, and perhaps even a peacock feather for my hat.My name would have been inscribed in letters of gold in the Book of Merit.The little Chinaman paused, scratching at his scalp.The hair had begun to sprout from the shaved part, making him look rather like a tennis ball.However, there is a condition of service within the Imperial Household; all the servants of the royal wives must be eunuchs.A gasp of horror greeted this, followed by a babble of agitated comment, in which the remarks Bloody heathen!and Yellow bastards!were heard to predominate.What is a eunuch?Marsali asked, looking bewildered.Nothing you need ever concern yourself with, chrie, Fergus assured her, slipping an arm about her shoulders.So you ran, mon ami?he addressed Mr.Willoughby in tones of deepest sympathy.I should do the same, without doubt!A deep murmur of heartfelt approbation reinforced this sentiment.Mr.Willoughby seemed somewhat heartened by such evident approval; he bobbed his head once or twice at his listeners before resuming his story.It was most dishonorable of me to refuse the Emperors gift.And yetit is a grievous weaknessI had fallen in love with a woman.There was a sympathetic sigh at this, most sailors being wildly romantic souls, but Mr.Willoughby stopped, jerking at Jamies sleeve and saying something to him.Oh, Im wrong, Jamie corrected himself.He says it was not a womanjust Womanall women, or the idea of women in general, he means.Thats it?he asked, looking down at Mr.Willoughby.The Chinaman nodded, satisfied, and sat back.The moon was full up by now, three quarters full, and bright enough to show the little Mandarins face as he talked.Yes, he said, through Jamie, I thought much of women; their grace and beauty, blooming like lotus flowers, floating like milkweed on the wind.And the myriad sounds of them, sometimes like the chatter of ricebirds, or the song of nightingales; sometimes the cawing of crows, he added with a smile that creased his eyes to slits and brought his hearers to laughter, but even then I loved them.I wrote all my poems to Womansometimes they were addressed to one lady or another, but most often to Woman alone.To the taste of breasts like apricots, the warm scent of a womans navel when she wakens in the winter, the warmth of a mound that fills your hand like a peach, split with ripeness.Fergus, scandalized, put his hands over Marsalis ears, but the rest of his hearers were most receptive.No wonder the wee fellow was an esteemed poet, Raeburn said with approval.Its verra heathen, but I like it!Worth a red knob on your hat, anyday, Maitland agreed.Almost worth learning a bit of Chinee for, the masters mate chimed in, eyeing Mr.Willoughby with fresh interest.Does he have a lot of those poems?Jamie waved the audienceby now augmented by most of the off duty handsto silence and said, Go on, then, to Mr.Willoughby.I fled on the Night of Lanterns, the Chinaman said.A great festival, and one when people would be thronging the streets; there would be no danger of being noticed by the watchmen.Just after dark, as the processions were assembling throughout the city, I put on the garments of a traveler  Thats like a pilgrim, Jamie interjected, they go to visit their ancestors tombs far away, and wear white clothesthats for mourning, ye ken?and I left my house.I made my way through the crowds without difficulty, carrying a small anonymous lantern I had boughtone without my name and place of residence painted on it.The watchmen were hammering upon their bamboo drums, the servants of the great households beating gongs, and from the roof of the palace, fireworks were being set off in great profusion.The small round face was marked by nostalgia, as he remembered.It was in a way a most appropriate farewell for a poet, he said.Fleeing nameless, to the sound of great applause.As I passed the soldiers garrison at the city gate, I looked back, to see the many roofs of the Palace outlined by bursting flowers of red and gold.It looked like a magic gardenand a forbidden one, for me.Yi Tien Cho had made his way without incident through the night, but had nearly been caught the next day.I had forgotten my fingernails, he said.He spread out a hand, small and short fingered, the nails bitten to the quicks.For a Mandarin has long nails, as symbol that he is not obliged to work with his hands, and my own were the length of one of my finger joints.A servant at the house where he had stopped for refreshment next day saw them, and ran to tell the guard.Yi Tien Cho ran, too, and succeeded at last in eluding his pursuers by sliding into a wet ditch and lying hidden in the bushes.While lying there, I destroyed my nails, of course, he said.He waggled the little finger of his right hand.I was obliged to tear that nail out, for it had a golden da zi inlaid in it, which I could not dislodge.He had stolen a peasants clothes from a bush where they had been hung to dry, leaving the torn out nail with its golden character in exchange, and made his way slowly across country toward the coast.At first he paid for his food with the small store of money he had brought away, but outside Lulong he met with a band of robbers, who took his money but left him his life.And after that, he said simply, I stole food when I could, and starved when I could not.And at last the wind of fortune changed a little, and I met with a group of traveling apothecaries, on their way to the physicians fair near the coast.In return for my skill at drawing banners for their booth and composing labels extolling the virtues of their medicines, they carried me along with them.Once reaching the coast, he had made his way to the waterfront, and tried there to pass himself off as a seaman, but failed utterly, as his fingers, so skillful with brush and ink, knew nothing of the art of knots and lines.There were several foreign ships in port; he had chosen the one whose sailors looked the most barbarous as being likely to carry him farthest away, and seizing his chance, had slipped past the deck guard and into the hold of the Serafina, bound for Edinburgh.You had always meant to leave the country altogether?Fergus asked, interested.It seems a desperate choice.Emperors reach very long, Mr.Willoughby said softly in English, not waiting for translation.I am exile, or I am dead.His listeners gave a collective sigh at the awesome contemplation of such bloodthirsty power, and there was a moment of silence, with only the whine of the rigging overhead, while Mr.Willoughby picked up his neglected cup and drained the last drops of his grog.He set it down, licking his lips, and laid his hand once more on Jamies arm.It is strange, Mr.Willoughby said, and the air of reflection in his voice was echoed exactly by Jamies, but it was my joy of women that Second Wife saw and loved in my words.Yet by desiring to possess meand my poemsshe would have forever destroyed what she admired.Mr.Willoughby uttered a small chuckle, whose irony was unmistakable.Nor is that the end of the contradiction my life has become.Because I could not bring myself to surrender my manhood, I have lost all elsehonor, livelihood, country.By that, I mean not only the land itself, with the slopes of noble fir trees where I spent my summers in Tartary, and the great plains of the south, the flowing of rivers filled with fish, but also the loss of myself.My parents are dishonored, the tombs of my ancestors fall into ruin, and no joss burns before their images.All order, all beauty is lost.I am come to a place where the golden words of my poems are taken for the clucking of hens, and my brushstrokes for their scratchings.I am taken as less than the meanest beggar, who swallows serpents for the entertainment of the crowds, allowing passersby to draw the serpent from my mouth by its tail for the tiny payment that will let me live another day.Mr.Willoughby glared round at his hearers, making his parallel evident.I am come to a country of women coarse and rank as bears.The Chinamans voice rose passionately, though Jamie kept to an even tone, reciting the words, but stripping them of feeling.They are creatures of no grace, no learning, ignorant, bad smelling, their bodies gross with sprouting hair, like dogs!And thesethese!disdain me as a yellow worm, so that even the lowest whores will not lie with me.For the love of Woman, I am come to a place where no woman is worthy of love!At this point, seeing the dark looks on the seamens faces, Jamie ceased translating, and instead tried to calm the Chinaman, laying a big hand on the blue silk shoulder.Aye, man, I quite see.And Im sure theres no a man present would have done otherwise, given the choice.Is that not so, lads?he asked, glancing over his shoulder with eyebrows raised significantly.His moral force was sufficient to extort a grudging murmur of agreement, but the crowds sympathy with the tale of Mr.Willoughbys travails had been quite dissipated by his insulting conclusion.Pointed remarks were made about licentious, ungrateful heathen, and a great many extravagantly admiring compliments paid to Marsali and me, as the men dispersed aft.Fergus and Marsali left then, too, Fergus pausing en route to inform Mr.Willoughby that any further remarks about European women would cause him, Fergus, to be obliged to wrap his, Willoughbys, queue about his neck and strangle him with it.Mr.Willoughby ignored remarks and threats alike, merely staring straight ahead, his black eyes shining with memory and grog.Jamie at last stood up, too, and held out a hand to help me down from my cask.It was as we were turning to leave that the Chinaman reached down between his legs.Completely without lewdness, he cupped his testicles, so that the rounded mass pressed against the silk.He rolled them slowly in the palm of his hand, staring at the bulge in deep meditation.Sometime, he said, as though to himself, I think not worth it.46  WE MEET A PORPOISE  I had been conscious for some time that Marsali was trying to get up the nerve to speak to me.I had thought she would, sooner or later; whatever her feelings toward me, I was the only other woman aboard.I did my best to help, smiling kindly and saying Good morning, but the first move would have to be hers.She made it, finally, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, a month after we had left Scotland.I was writing in our shared cabin, making surgical notes on a minor amputationtwo smashed toes on one of the foredeck hands.I had just completed a drawing of the surgical site, when a shadow darkened the doorway of the cabin, and I looked up to see Marsali standing there, chin thrust out pugnaciously.I need to know something, she said firmly.I dinna like ye, and I reckon ye ken that, but Da says youre a wisewoman, and I think youre maybe an honest woman, even if ye are a whore, so youll maybe tell me.There were any number of possible responses to this remarkable statement, but I refrained from making any of them.Maybe I will, I said, putting down the pen.What is it you need to know?Seeing that I wasnt angry, she slid into the cabin and sat down on the stool, the only available spot.Weel, its to do wi bairns, she explained.And how ye get them.I raised one eyebrow.Your mother didnt tell you where babies come from?She snorted impatiently, her small blond brows knotted in fierce scorn.O course I ken where they come from!Any fool knows that much.Ye let a man put his prick between your legs, and theres the devil to pay, nine months later.What I want to know is how ye dont get them.I see.I regarded her with considerable interest.You dont want a child?Eronce youre properly married, I mean?Most young women seem to.Well, she said slowly, twisting a handful of her dress.I think I maybe would like a babe sometime.For itself, I mean.If it maybe had dark hair, like Fergus.A hint of dreaminess flitted across her face, but then her expression hardened once more.But I cant, she said.Why not?She pushed out her lips, thinking, then pulled them in again.Well, because of Fergus.We havena lain together yet.We havena been able to do more than kiss each other now and again behind the hatch coversthanks to Da and his bloody minded notions, she added bitterly.Amen, I said, with some wryness.Eh?Never mind.I waved a hand, dismissing it.What has that got to do with not wanting babies?I want to like it, she said matter of factly.When we get to the prick part.I bit the inside of my lower lip.Ierimagine that has something to do with Fergus, but Im afraid I dont quite see what it has to do with babies.Marsali eyed me warily.Without hostility for once, more as though she were estimating me in some fashion.Fergus likes ye, she said.Im fond of him, too, I answered cautiously, not sure where the conversation was heading.Ive known him for quite a long time, ever since he was a boy.She relaxed suddenly, some of the tension going out of the slender shoulders.Oh.Youll know about it, thenwhere he was born?Suddenly I understood her wariness.The brothel in Paris?Yes, I know about that.He told you, then?She nodded.Aye, he did.A long time ago, last Hogmanay.Well, I supposed a year was a long time to a fifteen year old.Thats when I told him I loved him, she went on.Her eyes were fixed on her skirt, and a faint tinge of pink showed in her cheeks.And he said he loved me, too, but my mother wasna going to ever agree to the match.And I said why not, there was nothing so awful about bein French, not everybody could be Scots, and I didna think his hand mattered a bit eitherafter all, there was Mr.Murray wi his wooden leg, and Mother liked him well enoughbut then he said, no, it was none of those things, and then he told meabout Paris, I mean, and being born in a brothel and being a pick pocket until he met Da.She raised her eyes, a look of incredulity in the light blue depths.I think he thought Id mind, she said, wonderingly.He tried to go away, and said he wouldna see me anymore.Well she shrugged, tossing her fair hair out of the way, I soon took care of that.She looked at me straight on, then, hands clasped in her lap.Its just I didna want to mention it, in case ye didnt know already.But since ye dowell, its no Fergus Im worried about.He says he knows what to do, and Ill like it fine, once were past the first time or two.But thats not what my Mam told me.What did she tell you?I asked, fascinated.A small line showed between the light brows.Well Marsali said slowly, it wasna so much she said itthough she did say, when I told her about Fergus and me, that hed do terrible things to me because of living wi whores and having one for a motherit was more sheshe acted like it.Her face was a rosy pink now, and she kept her eyes in her lap, where her fingers twisted themselves in the folds of her skirt.The wind seemed to be picking up; small strands of blond hair rose gently from her head, wafted by the breeze from the window.When I started to bleed the first time, she told me what to do, and about how it was part o the curse of Eve, and I must just put up wi it.And I said, what was the curse of Eve?And she read me from the Bible all about how St.Paul said women were terrible, filthy sinners because of what Eve did, but they could still be saved by suffering and bearing children.I never did think a lot of St.Paul, I observed, and she looked up, startled.But hes in the Bible!she said, shocked.So are a lot of other things, I said dryly.Heard that story about Gideon and his daughter, have you?Or the fellow who sent his lady out to be raped to death by a crowd of ruffians, so they wouldnt get him?Gods chosen men, just like Paul.But go on, do.She gaped at me for a minute, but then closed her mouth and nodded, a little stunned.Aye, well.Mother said as how it meant I was nearly old enough to be wed, and when I did marry, I must be sure to remember it was a womans duty to do as her husband wanted, whether she liked it or no.And she looked so sad when she told me thatI thought whatever a womans duty was, it must be awful, and from what St.Paul said about suffering and bearing children  She stopped and sighed.I sat quietly, waiting.When she resumed, it was haltingly, as though she had trouble choosing her words.I canna remember my father.I was only three when the English took him away.But I was old enough when my mother wedwed Jamieto see how it was between them.She bit her lip; she wasnt used to calling Jamie by his name.DaJamie, I meanhes kind, I think; he always was to Joan and me.But Id see, when hed lay his hand on my mothers waist and try to draw her closeshed shrink away from him.She gnawed her lip some more, then continued.I could see she was afraid; she didna like him to touch her.But I couldna see that he ever did anything to be afraid of, not where we could seeso I thought it must be something he did when they were in their bed, alone.Joan and I used to wonder what it could be; Mam never had marks on her face or her arms, and she didna limp when she walkednot like Magdalen Wallace, whose husband always beats her when hes drunk on market dayso we didna think Da hit her.Marsali licked her lips, dried by the warm salt air, and I pushed the jug of water toward her.She nodded in thanks and poured a cupful.So I thought, she said, eyes fixed on the stream of water, that it must be because Mam had had childrenhad usand she knew it would be terrible again and so she didna want to go to bed withwith Jamie for fear of it.She took a drink, then set down the cup and looked at me directly, firming her chin in challenge.I saw ye with my Da, she said.Just that minute, before he saw me.II think ye liked what he was doing to you in the bed.I opened my mouth, and closed it again.Wellyes, I said, a little weakly.I did.She grunted in satisfaction.Mmphm.And ye like it when he touches ye; Ive seen.Well, then.Ye havena got any children.And Id heard there are ways not to have them, only nobody seems to know just how, but you must, bein a wisewoman and all.She tilted her head to one side, studying me.Id like a babe, she admitted, but if its got to be a babe or liking Fergus, then its Fergus.So it wont be a babeif youll tell me how.I brushed the curls back behind my ear, wondering where on earth to start.Well, I said, drawing a deep breath, to begin with, I have had children.Her eyes sprang wide and round at this.Ye do?Does Dadoes Jamie know?Well, of course he does, I replied testily.They were his.I never heard Da had any bairns at all.The pale eyes narrowed with suspicion.I dont imagine he thought it was any of your business, I said, perhaps a trifle more sharply than necessary.And its not, either, I added, but she just raised her brows and went on looking suspicious.The first baby died, I said, capitulating.In France.Shes buried there.Myour second daughter is grown now; she was born after Culloden.So hes never seen her?The grown one?Marsali spoke slowly, frowning.I shook my head, unable to speak for a moment.There seemed to be something stuck in my throat, and I reached for the water.Marsali pushed the jug absently in my direction, leaning against the swing of the ship.Thats verra sad, she said softly, to herself.Then she glanced up at me, frowning once more in concentration as she tried to work it all out.So yeve had children, and it didna make a difference to you?Mmphm.But its been a long while, thendid ye have other men whilst ye were away in France?Her lower lip came up over the upper one, making her look very much like a small and stubborn bulldog.That, I said firmly, putting the cup down, is definitely none of your business.As to whether childbirth makes a difference, possibly it does to some women, but not all of them.But whether it does or not, there are good reasons why you might not want to have a child right away.She withdrew the pouting underlip and sat up straight, interested.So there is a way?There are a lot of ways, and unfortunately most of them dont work, I told her, with a pang of regret for my prescription pad and the reliability of contraceptive pills.Still, I remembered well enough the advice of the matresses sage femme, the experienced midwives of the Hpital des Anges, where I had worked in Paris twenty years before.Hand me the small box in the cupboard over there, I said, pointing to the doors above her head.Yes, that one.Some of the French midwives make a tea of bayberry and valerian, I said, rummaging in my medicine box.But its rather dangerous, and not all that dependable, I dont think.Dye miss her?Marsali asked abruptly.I glanced up, startled.Your, daughter?Her face was abnormally expressionless, and I suspected the question had more to do with Laoghaire than with me.Yes, I said simply.But shes grown; she has her own life.The lump in my throat was back, and I bent my head over the medicine box, hiding my face.The chances of Laoghaire ever seeing Marsali again were just about as good as the chances that I would ever see Brianna; it wasnt a thought I wanted to dwell on.Here, I said, pulling out a large chunk of cleaned sponge.I took one of the thin surgical knives from the fitted slots in the lid of the box and carefully sliced off several thin pieces, about three inches square.I searched through the box again and found the small bottle of tansy oil, with which I carefully saturated one square under Marsalis fascinated gaze.All right, I said.Thats about how much oil to use.If you havent any oil, you can dip the sponge in vinegareven wine will work, in a pinch.You put the bit of sponge well up inside you before you go to bed with a manmind you do it even the first time; you can get with child from even once.Marsali nodded, her eyes wide, and touched the sponge gently with a forefinger.Aye?Andand after?Do I take it out again, or  An urgent shout from above, coupled with a sudden heeling of the Artemis as she backed her mainsails, put an abrupt end to the conversation.Something was happening up above.Ill tell you later, I said, pushing the sponge and bottle toward her, and headed for the passage.Jamie was standing with the Captain on the afterdeck, watching the approach of a large ship behind us.She was perhaps three times the size of the Artemis, three masted, with a perfect forest of rigging and sail, through which small black figures hopped like fleas on a bedsheet.A puff of white smoke floated in her wake, token of a cannon recently fired.Is she firing on us?I asked in amazement.No, Jamie said grimly.A warning shot only.She means to board us.Can they?I addressed the question to Captain Raines, who was looking even more glum than usual, the downturned corners of his mouth sunk in his beard.They can, he said.Well not outrun her in a stiff breeze like this, on the open sea.What is she?Her ensign flew at the masthead, but seen against the sun at this distance, it looked completely black.Jamie glanced down at me, expressionless.A British man o war, Sassenach.Seventy four guns.Perhaps yed best go below.This was bad news.While Britain was no longer at war with France, relations between the two countries were by no means cordial.And while the Artemis was armed, she had only four twelve pound guns; sufficient to deter small pirates, but no match for a man of war.What can they want of us?Jamie asked the Captain.Raines shook his head, his soft, plump face set grimly.Likely pressing, he answered.Shes shorthanded; you can see by her riggingand her foredeck all ahoo, he noted disapprovingly, eyes fixed on the man of war, now looming as she drew alongside.He glanced at Jamie.They can press any of our hands who look to be Britishwhich is something like half the crew.And yourself, Mr.Fraserunless you wish to pass for French?Damn, Jamie said softly.He glanced at me and frowned.Did I not tell ye to get below?You did, I said, not going.I drew closer to him, my eyes fixed on the man of war, where a small boat was now being lowered.One officer, in a gilded coat and laced hat, was climbing down the side.If they press the British hands, I asked Captain Raines, what will happen to them?Theyll serve aboard the Porpoisethats her, he nodded at the man of war, which sported a puff lipped fish as the figurehead, as members of the Royal Navy.She may release the pressed hands when she reaches portor she may not.What?You mean they can just kidnap men and make them serve as sailors for as long as they please?A thrill of fear shot through me, at the thought of Jamies being abruptly taken away.They can, the Captain said shortly.And if they do, well have a job of it to reach Jamaica ourselves, with half a crew.He turned abruptly and went forward, to greet the arriving boat.Jamie gripped my elbow and squeezed.Theyll not take Innes or Fergus, he said.Theyll help ye to hunt for Young Ian.If they take usI noted the us with a sharp pangyoull go on to Jareds place at Sugar Bay, and search from there.He looked down and gave me a brief smile.Ill meet ye there, he said, and gave my elbow a reassuring squeeze.I canna say how long it might be, but Ill come to ye there.But you could pass as a Frenchman!I protested.You know you could!He looked at me for a moment, and shook his head, smiling faintly.No, he said softly.I canna let them take my men, and stay behind, hiding under a Frenchmans name.But I started to protest that the Scottish smugglers were not his men, had no claim on his loyalty, and then stopped, realizing that it was useless.The Scots might not be his tenants or his kin, and one of them might well be a traitor.But he had brought them here, and if they went, he would go with them.Dinna mind it, Sassenach, he said softly.I shall be all right, one way or the other.But I think it is best if our name is Malcolm, for the moment.He patted my hand, then released it and went forward, shoulders braced to meet whatever was coming.I followed, more slowly.As the gig pulled alongside, I saw Captain Rainess eyebrows rise in astonishment.God save us, what is this?he murmured under his breath, as a head appeared above the Artemiss rail.It was a young man, evidently in his late twenties, but with his face drawn and shoulders slumping with fatigue.A uniform coat that was too big for him had been tugged on over a filthy shirt, and he staggered slightly as the deck of the Artemis rose beneath him.You are the captain of this ship?The Englishmans eyes were red rimmed from tiredness, but he picked Raines from the crowd of grim faced hands at a glance.I am acting captain Thomas Leonard, of His Majestys ship Porpoise.For the love of God, he said, speaking hoarsely, have you a surgeon aboard?Over a warily offered glass of port below, Captain Leonard explained that the Porpoise had suffered an outbreak of some infectious plague, beginning some four weeks before.Half the crew are down with it, he said, wiping a crimson drop from his stubbled chin.Weve lost thirty men so far, and look fair to lose a lot more.You lost your captain?Raines asked.Leonards thin face flushed slightly.Thethe captain and the two senior lieutenants died last week, and the surgeon and the surgeons mate, as well.I was third lieutenant.That explained both his surprising youth and his nervous state; to be landed suddenly in sole command of a large ship, a crew of six hundred men, and a rampant infection aboard, was enough to rattle anyone.If you have anyone aboard with some medical experience He looked hopefully from Captain Raines to Jamie, who stood by the desk, frowning slightly.Im the Artemiss surgeon, Captain Leonard, I said, from my place in the doorway.What symptoms do your men have?You?The young captains head swiveled to stare at me.His jaw hung slackly open, showing the furred tongue and stained teeth of a tobacco chewer.My wifes a rare healer, Captain, Jamie said mildly.If its help ye came for, Id advise ye to answer her questions, and do as she tells ye.Leonard blinked once, but then took a deep breath and nodded.Yes.Well, it seems to start with griping pains in the belly, and a terrible flux and vomiting.The afflicted men complain of headache, and they have considerable fever.They  Do some of them have a rash on their bellies?I interrupted.He nodded eagerly.They do.And some of them bleed from the arse as well.Oh, I beg pardon, maam, he said, suddenly flustered.I meant no offense, only that  I think I know what that might be, I interrupted his apologies.A feeling of excitement began to grow in me; the feeling of a diagnosis just under my hands, and the sure knowledge of how to proceed with it.The call of trumpets to a warhorse, I thought with wry amusement.Id need to look at them, to be sure, but  My wife would be pleased to advise ye, Captain, Jamie said firmly.But Im afraid she canna go aboard your ship.Are you sure?Captain Leonard looked from one to the other of us, eyes desperate with disappointment.If she could only look at my crew  No, Jamie said, at the same moment I replied, Yes, of course!There was an awkward silence for a moment.Then Jamie rose to his feet, said politely, Youll excuse us, Captain Leonard?and dragged me bodily out of the cabin, down the passage to the afterhold.Are ye daft?he hissed, still clutching me by one arm.Ye canna be thinking of setting foot on a ship wi the plague!Risk your life and the crew and Young Ian, all for the sake of a pack of Englishmen?It isnt plague, I said, struggling to get free.And I wouldnt be risking my life.Let go of my arm, you bloody Scot!He let go, but stood blocking the ladder, glowering at me.Listen, I said, striving for patience.It isnt plague; Im almost sure its typhoid feverthe rash sounds like it.I cant catch that, Ive been vaccinated for it.Momentary doubt flitted across his face.Despite my explanations, he was still inclined to consider germs and vaccines in the same league with black magic.Aye?he said skeptically.Well, perhaps thats so, but still  Look, I said, groping for words.Im a doctor.Theyre sick, and I can do something about it.Iitswell, I have to, thats all!Judging from its effect, this statement appeared to lack something in eloquence.Jamie raised one eyebrow, inviting me to go on.I took a deep breath.How should I explain itthe need to touch, the compulsion to heal?In his own way, Frank had understood.Surely there was a way to make it clear to Jamie.I took an oath, I said.When I became a physician.Both eyebrows went up.An oath?he echoed.What sort of oath?I had said it aloud only the one time.Still, I had had a framed copy in my office; Frank had given it to me, a gift when I graduated from medical school.I swallowed a small thickening in my throat, closed my eyes, and read what I could remember from the scroll before my minds eye.I swear by Apollo the physician, by Aesculapius, Hygeia, and Panacea, and I take to witness all the gods, all the goddesses, to keep according to my ability and my judgment the following Oath:  I will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone.To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug, nor give advice which may cause his death.But I will preserve the purity of my life and my art.In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients, keeping myself far from all intentional ill doing and all seduction, and especially from the pleasures of love with women or with men, be they free or slaves.All that may come to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or outside of my profession or in daily commerce with men, which ought not to be spread abroad, I will keep secret and will never reveal.If I keep this oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all men and in all times; but if I swerve from it or violate it, may the reverse be my lot.I opened my eyes, to find him looking down at me thoughtfully.Erparts of it are just for tradition, I explained.The corner of his mouth twitched slightly.I see, he said.Well, the first part sounds a wee bit pagan, but I like the part about how ye willna seduce anyone.I thought youd like that one, I said dryly.Captain Leonards virtue is safe with me.He gave a small snort and leaned back against the ladder, running one hand slowly through his hair.Is that how its done, then, in the company of physicians?he asked.Ye hold yourself bound to help whoever calls for it, even an enemy?It doesnt make a great difference, you know, if theyre ill or hurt.I looked up, searching his face for understanding.Aye, well, he said slowly.Ive taken an oath now and then, myselfand none of them lightly.He reached out and took my right hand, his fingers resting on my silver ring.Some weigh heavier than others, though, he said, watching my face in turn.He was very close to me, the sun from the hatchway overhead striping the linen of his sleeve, the skin of his hand a deep ruddy bronze where it cradled my own white fingers, and the glinting silver of my wedding ring.It does, I said softly, speaking to his thought.You know it does.I laid my other hand against his chest, its gold ring glowing in a bar of sunlight.But where one vow can be kept, without damage to another?He sighed, deeply enough to move the hand on my chest, then bent and kissed me, very gently.Aye, well, I wouldna have ye be forsworn, he said, straightening up with a wry twist to his mouth.Youre sure of this vaccination of yours?It does work?It works, I assured him.Perhaps I should go with ye, he said, frowning slightly.You cantyou havent been vaccinated, and typhoids awfully contagious.Youre only thinking its typhoid, from what Leonard says, he pointed out.Ye dinna ken for sure that its that.No, I admitted.But theres only one way to find out.I was assisted up onto the deck of the Porpoise by means of a bosuns chair, a terrorizing swing over empty air and frothing sea.I landed ignominiously in a sprawl on the deck.Once I regained my feet, I was astonished to find how solid the deck of the man of war felt, compared to the tiny, pitching quarterdeck of the Artemis, far below.It was like standing on the Rock of Gibraltar.My hair had blown loose during the trip between the ships; I twisted it up and repinned it as best I could, then reached to take the medicine box I had brought from the midshipman who held it.Youd best show me where they are, I said.The wind was brisk, and I was aware that it was taking a certain amount of work on the part of both crews to keep the two ships close together, even as both drifted leeward.It was dark in the tween decks, the confined space lit by small oil lamps that hung from the ceiling, swaying gently with the rise and fall of the ship, so that the ranks of hammocked men lay in deep shadow, blotched with dim patches of light from above.They looked like pods of whales, or sleeping sea beasts, lying humped and black, side by side, swaying with the movement of the sea beneath.The stench was overpowering.What air there was came down through crude ventilator shafts that reached the upper deck, but that wasnt a lot.Worse than unwashed seamen was the reek of vomitus and the ripe, throat clogging smell of blood streaked diarrhea, which liberally spattered the decking beneath the hammocks, where sufferers had been too ill to reach the few available chamber pots.My shoes stuck to the deck, coming away with a nasty sucking noise as I made my way cautiously into the area.Give me a better light, I said peremptorily to the apprehensive looking young midshipman who had been told off to accompany me.He was holding a kerchief to his face and looked both scared and miserable, but he obeyed, holding up the lantern he carried so that I could peer into the nearest hammock.The occupant groaned and turned away his face as the light struck him.He was flushed with fever, and his skin hot to the touch.I pulled his shirt up and felt his stomach; it too was hot, the skin distended and hard.As I prodded gently here and there, the man writhed like a worm on a hook, uttering piteous groans.Its all right, I said soothingly, urging him to flatten out again.Yes, Ill help you; it will feel better soon.Let me look into your eyes, now.Yes, thats right.I pulled back the eyelid; his pupil shrank in the light, leaving his eyes brown and red rimmed with suffering.Christ, take away the light!he gasped, jerking his head away.It splits my head!Fever, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache.Do you have chills?I asked, waving back the midshipmans lantern.The answer was more a moan than a word, but in the affirmative.Even in the shadows, I could see that many of the men in the hammocks were wrapped in their blankets, though it was stifling hot here below.If not for the headache, it could be simple gastroenteritisbut not with this many men stricken.Something very contagious indeed, and I was fairly sure what.Not malaria, coming from Europe to the Caribbean.Typhus was a possibility; spread by the common body louse, it was prone to rapid spread in close quarters like these, and the symptoms were similar to those I saw around mewith one distinctive difference.That seaman didnt have the characteristic belly rash, nor the next, but the third one did.The light red rosettes were plain on the clammy white skin.I pressed firmly on one, and it disappeared, blinking back into existence a moment later, as the blood returned to the skin.I squeezed my way between the hammocks, the heavy, sweating bodies pressing in on me from either side, and made my way back to the companionway where Captain Leonard and two more of his midshipmen waited for me.Its typhoid, I told the Captain.I was as sure as I could be, lacking a microscope and blood culture.Oh?His drawn face remained apprehensive.Do you know what to do for it, Mrs.Malcolm?Yes, but it wont be easy.The sick men need to be taken above, washed thoroughly, and laid where they can have fresh air to breathe.Beyond that, its a matter of nursing; theyll need to have a liquid dietand lots of waterboiled water, thats very important!and sponging to bring down the fever.The most important thing is to avoid infecting any more of your crew, though.There are several things that need to be done  Do them, he interrupted.I shall give orders to have as many of the healthy men as can be spared to attend you; order them as you will.Well, I said, with a dubious glance at the surroundings.I can make a start, and tell you how to be going on, but its going to be a big job.Captain Raines and my husband will be anxious to be on our way.Mrs.Malcolm, the Captain said earnestly, I shall be eternally grateful for any assistance you can render us.We are most urgently bound for Jamaica, and unless the remainder of my crew can be saved from this wicked illness, we will never reach that island.He spoke with profound seriousness, and I felt a twinge of pity for him.All right, I said with a sigh.Send me a dozen healthy crewmen, for a start.Climbing to the quarterdeck, I went to the rail and waved at Jamie, who was standing by the Artemiss wheel, looking upward.I could see his face clearly, despite the distance; it was worried, but relaxed into a broad smile when he saw me.Are ye comin down now?he shouted, cupping his hands.Not yet!I shouted back.I need two hours!Holding up two fingers to make my meaning clear in case he hadnt heard, I stepped back from the rail, but not before I saw the smile fade from his face.Hed heard.I saw the sick men removed to the afterdeck, and a crew of hands set to strip them of their filthy clothes, and hose and sponge them with seawater from the pumps.I was in the galley, instructing the cook and galley crew in food handling precautions, when I felt the movement of the deck under my feet.The cook to whom I was talking snaked out a hand and snapped shut the latch of the cupboard behind him.With the utmost dispatch, he grabbed a loose pot that leapt off its shelf, thrust a large ham on a spit into the lower cupboard, and whirled to clap a lid on the boiling pot hung over the galley fire.I stared at him in astonishment.I had seen Murphy perform this same odd ballet, whenever the Artemis cast off or changed course abruptly.What I said, but then abandoned the question, and headed for the quarterdeck, as fast as I could go.We were under way; big and solid as the Porpoise was, I could feel the vibration that ran through the keel as she took the wind.I burst onto the deck to find a cloud of sails overhead, set and drawing, and the Artemis falling rapidly behind us.Captain Leonard was standing by the helmsman, looking back to the Artemis, as the master bawled commands to the men overhead.What are you doing?I shouted.You bloody little bastard, whats going on here?The Captain glanced at me, plainly embarrassed, but with his jaw set stubbornly.We must get to Jamaica with the utmost dispatch, he said.His cheeks were chapped red with the rushing sea wind, or he might have blushed.I am sorry, Mrs.Malcolmindeed I regret the necessity, but  But nothing!I said, furious.Put about!Heave to!Drop the bloody anchor!You cant take me away like this!I regret the necessity, he said again, doggedly.But I believe that we require your continuing services most urgently, Mrs.Malcolm.Dont worry, he said, striving for a reassurance that he didnt achieve.He reached out as though to pat my shoulder, but then thought better of it.His hand dropped to his side.I have promised your husband that the navy will provide you accommodation in Jamaica until the Artemis arrives there.He flinched backward at the look on my face, evidently afraid that I might attack himand not without reason.What do you mean you promised my husband?I said, through gritted teeth.Do you mean that Jthat Mr.Malcolm permitted you to abduct me?Erno.No, he didnt.The Captain appeared to be finding the interview a strain.He dragged a filthy handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his brow and the back of his neck.He was most intransigent, Im afraid.Intransigent, eh?Well, so am I!I stamped my foot on the deck, aiming for his toes, and missing only because he leapt agilely backward.If you expect me to help you, you bloody kidnapper, just bloody think again!The Captain tucked his handkerchief away and set his jaw.Mrs.Malcolm.You compel me to tell you what I told your husband.The Artemis sails under a French flag, and with French papers, but more than half her crew are Englishmen or Scots.I could have pressed these men to service hereand I badly need them.Instead, I have agreed to leave them unmolested, in return for the gift of your medical knowledge.So youve decided to press me instead.And my husband agreed to thisthis bargain?No, he didnt, the young man said, rather dryly.The captain of the Artemis, however, perceived the force of my argument.He blinked down at me, his eyes swollen from days without sleep, the too big jacket flapping around his slender torso.Despite his youth and his slovenly appearance, he had considerable dignity.I must beg your pardon for what must seem the height of ungentlemanly behavior, Mrs.Malcolmbut the truth is that I am desperate, he said simply.You may be our only chance.I must take it.I opened my mouth to reply, but then closed it.Despite my furyand my profound unease about what Jamie was going to say when I saw him againI felt some sympathy for his position.It was quite true that he stood in danger of losing most of his crew, without help.Even with my help, we would lose somebut that wasnt a prospect I cared to dwell on.All right, I said, through my teeth.Allright!I looked out over the rail, at the dwindling sails of the Artemis.I wasnt prone to seasickness, but I felt a distinct hollowing in the pit of my stomach as the shipand Jamiefell far behind.I wouldnt appear to have a lot of choice in the matter.If you can spare as many men as possible to scrub down the tween decksoh, and have you any alcohol on board?He looked mildly surprised.Alcohol?Well, there is the rum for the hands grog, and possibly some wine from the gun room locker.Will that do?If thats what you have, it will have to do.I tried to push aside my own emotions, long enough to deal with the situation.I suppose I must speak to the purser, then.Yes, of course.Come with me.Leonard started toward the companion way that led belowdecks, then, flushing, stood back and gestured awkwardly to let me go firstlest my descent expose my lower limbs indelicately, I supposed.Biting my lip with a mixture of anger and amusement, I went.I had just reached the bottom of the ladder when I heard a confusion of voices above.No, I tell ee, the captains not to be disturbed!Whatever you have to say will  Leave go!I tell you, if you dont let me speak to him now, it will be too late!And then Leonards voice, suddenly sharp as he turned to the interlopers.Stevens?What is this?Whats the matter?No matter, sir, said the first voice, suddenly obsequious.Only that Tompkins here is sure as he knows the cove what was on that shipthe big un, with the red hair.He says  I havent time, the captain said shortly.Tell the mate, Tompkins, and I shall attend to it later.I was, naturally, halfway back up the ladder by the time these words were spoken, and listening for all I was worth.The hatchway darkened as Leonard began the backward descent down the ladder.The young man glanced at me sharply, but I kept my face carefully blank, saying only, Have you many food stores left, Captain?The sick men will need to be fed very carefully.I dont suppose there would be any milk saboard, but  Oh, theres milk, he said, suddenly more cheerful.We have six milch goats, in fact.The gunners wife, Mrs.Johansen, does quite wonderfully with them.Ill send her to talk with you, after weve seen the purser.Captain Leonard introduced me briefly to Mr.Overholt, the purser, and then left, with the injunction that I should be afforded every possible service.Mr.Overholt, a small, plump man with a bald and shining head, peered at me out of the deep collar of his coat like an undersized Humpty Dumpty, murmuring unhappily about the scarcity of everything near the end of a cruise, and how unfortunate everything was, but I scarcely attended to him.I was much too agitated, thinking of what I had overheard.Who was this Tompkins?The voice was entirely unfamiliar, and I was sure I had never heard the name before.More important, what did he know about Jamie?And what was Captain Leonard likely to do with the information?As it was, there was nothing I could do now, save contain my impatience, and with the half of my mind not busy with fruitless speculation, work out with Mr.Overholt what supplies were available for use in sickroom feeding.Not a great deal, as it turned out.No, they certainly cant eat salt beef, I said firmly.Nor yet hardtack, though if we soak the biscuit in boiled milk, perhaps we can manage that as they begin to recover.If you knock the weevils out first, I added, as an afterthought.Fish, Mr.Overholt suggested, in a hopeless sort of way.We often encounter substantial schools of mackerel or even bonita, as we approach the Caribbean.Sometimes the crew will have luck with baited lines.Maybe that would do, I said, absently.Boiled milk and water will be enough in the early stages, but as the men begin to recover, they should have something light and nourishingsoup, for instance.I suppose we could make a fish soup?Unless you have something else that might be suitable?Well Mr.Overholt looked profoundly uneasy.There is a small quantity of dried figs, ten pound of sugar, some coffee, a quantity of Naples biscuit, and a large cask of Madeira wine, but of course we cannot use that.Why not?I stared at him, and he shuffled his feet uneasily.Why, those supplies are intended for the use of our passenger, he said.What sort of passenger?I asked blankly.Mr.Overholt looked surprised.The Captain did not tell you?We are carrying the new governor for the island of Jamaica.That is the causewell, one causehe corrected himself, dabbing nervously at his bald head with a handkerchiefof our haste.If hes not sick, the Governor can eat salt beef, I said firmly.Be good for him, I shouldnt wonder.Now, if youll have the wine taken to the galley, Ive work to do.Aided by one of the remaining midshipmen, a short, stocky youth named Pound, I made a rapid tour of the ship, ruthlessly dragooning supplies and hands.Pound, trotting beside me like a small, ferocious bulldog, firmly informed surprised and resentful cooks, carpenters, sweepers, swabbers, sailmakers, and holdsmen that all my wishesno matter how unreasonablemust be gratified instantly, by the captains orders.Quarantine was the most important thing.As soon as the tween decks had been scrubbed and aired, the patients would have to be carried down again, but the hammocks restrung with plenty of space betweenthe unaffected crew would have to sleep on deckand provided with adequate toilet facilities.I had seen a pair of large kettles in the galley that I thought might do.I made a quick note on the mental list I was keeping, and hoped the chief cook was not as possessive of his receptacles as Murphy was.I followed Pounds round head, covered with close clipped brown curls, down toward the hold in search of worn sails that might be used for cloths.Only half my mind was on my list; with the other half, I was contemplating the possible source of the typhoid outbreak.Caused by a bacillus of the Salmonella genus, it was normally spread by ingestion of the bacillus, carried on hands contaminated by urine or feces.Given the sanitary habits of seamen, any one of the crew could be the carrier of the disease.The most likely culprit was one of the food handlers, though, given the widespread and sudden nature of the outbreakthe cook or one of his two mates, or possibly one of the stewards.I would have to find out how many of these there were, which messes they served, and whether anyone had changed duties four weeks agono, five, I corrected myself.The outbreak had begun four weeks ago, but there was an incubation period for the disease to be considered, too.Mr.Pound, I called, and a round face peered up at me from the foot of the ladder.Yes, maam?Mr.Poundwhats your first name, by the way?I asked.Elias, maam, he said, looking mildly bewildered.Do you mind if I call you so?I dropped off the foot of the ladder and smiled at him.He smiled hesitantly back.Erno, maam.The Captain might mind, though, he added cautiously.Tisnt really naval, you know.Elias Pound couldnt be more than seventeen or eighteen; I doubted that Captain Leonard was more than five or six years older.Still, protocol was protocol.Ill be very naval in public, I assured him, suppressing a smile.But if youre going to work with me, it will be easier to call you by name.I knew, as he didnt, what lay aheadhours and days and possibly weeks of labor and exhaustion, when the senses would blur, and only bodily habit and blind instinctand the leadership of a tireless chiefwould keep those caring for the sick on their feet.I was far from tireless, but the illusion would have to be kept up.This could be done with the help of two or three others, whom I could train; substitutes for my own hands and eyes, who could carry on when I must rest.Fateand Captain Leonardhad designated Elias Pound as my new right hand; best to be on comfortable terms with him at once.How long have you been at sea, Elias?I asked, stopping to peer after him as he ducked under a low platform that held enormous loops of a huge, evil smelling chain, each link more than twice the size of my fist.The anchor chain?I wondered, touching it curiously.It looked strong enough to moor the Queen Elizabeth, which seemed a comforting thought.Since I was seven, maam, he said, working his way out backward, dragging a large chest.He stood up puffing slightly from the exertion, and wiped his round, ingenuous face.My uncles commander in Triton, so he was able to get me a berth in her.I come to join the Porpoise just this voyage, though, out of Edinburgh.He flipped open the chest, revealing an assortment of rust smeared surgical implementsat least I hoped it was rustand a jumbled collection of stoppered bottles and jugs.One of the jars had cracked, and a fine white dust like plaster of Paris lay over everything in the chest.This is what Mr.Hunter, the surgeon, had with him, maam, he said.Will you have use for it?God knows, I said, peering into the chest.But Ill have a look.Have someone else fetch it up to the sickbay, though, Elias.I need you to come and speak firmly to the cook.As I oversaw the scrubbing of the tween decks with boiling seawater, my mind was occupied with several distinct trains of thought.First, I was mentally charting the necessary steps to take in combating the disease.Two men, far gone from dehydration and malaise, had died during the removal from the tween decks, and now lay at the far end of the after deck, where the sailmaker was industriously stitching them into their hammocks for burial, a pair of round shot sewn in at their feet.Four more werent going to make it through the night.The remaining forty five had chances ranging from excellent to slim; with luck and skill, I might save most of them.But how many new cases were brewing, undetected, among the remaining crew?Huge quantities of water were boiling in the galley at my order; hot seawater for cleansing, boiled fresh water for drinking.I made another tick on my mental list; I must see Mrs.Johansen, she of the milch goats, and arrange for the milk to be sterilized as well.I must interview the galley hands about their duties; if a single source of infection could be found and isolated, it would do a lot to halt the spread of the disease.Tick.All of the available alcohol on the ship was being gathered in the sickbay, to the profound horror of Mr.Overholt.It could be used in its present form, but it would be better to have purified alcohol.Could a means be found of distilling it?Check with the purser.Tick.All the hammocks must be boiled and dried before the healthy hands slept in them.That would have to be done quickly, before the next watch went to its rest.Send Elias for a crew of swabbers and sweepers; laundry duty seemed most in their line.Tick.Under the growing mental list of necessities were vague but continuing thoughts of the mysterious Tompkins and his unknown information.Whatever it was, it had not resulted in our changing course to return to the Artemis.Either Captain Leonard had not taken it seriously, or he was simply too eager to get to Jamaica to allow anything to hinder his progress.I had paused for a moment by the rail, to organize my thoughts.I pushed back the hair from my forehead, and lifted my face to the cleansing wind, letting it blow away the stench of sickness.Puffs of ill smelling steam rose from the nearby hatchway, from the hot water cleansing going on below.It would be better down there when they had finished, but a long way from fresh air.I looked out over the rail, hoping vainly for the glimpse of a sail, but the Porpoise was alone, the Artemisand Jamieleft far behind.I pushed away the sudden rush of loneliness and panic.I must speak soon with Captain Leonard.Answers to two, at least, of the problems that concerned me lay with him; the possible source of the typhoid outbreakand the role of the unknown Mr.Tompkins in Jamies affairs.But for the moment, there were more pressing matters.Elias!I called, knowing he would be somewhere within reach of my voice.Take me to Mrs.Johansen and the goats, please.47  PLAGUE SHIP  Two days later, I had still not found time to speak to Captain Leonard.Twice, I had gone to his cabin, but found the young Captain gone or unavailabletaking position, I was told, or consulting charts, or otherwise engaged in some bit of sailing arcana.Mr.Overholt had taken to avoiding me and my insatiable demands, locking himself in his cabin with a pomander of dried sage and hyssop tied round his neck to ward off plague.The able bodied crewmen assigned to the work of cleaning and shifting had been lethargic and dubious at first, but I had chivvied and scolded, glared and shouted, stamped my foot and shrieked, and got them gradually moving.I felt more like a sheepdog than a doctorsnapping and growling at their heels, and hoarse now with the effort.It was working, though; there was a new feeling of hope and purpose among the crewI could feel it.Four new deaths today, and ten new cases reporting, but the sounds of groaning distress from the tween decks were much less, and the faces of the still healthy showed the relief that comes of doing somethinganything.I had so far failed to find the source of the contagion.If I could do that, and prevent any fresh outbreaks, I mightjust possiblyhalt the devastation within a week, while the Porpoise still had hands enough to sail her.A quick canvass of the surviving crew had turned up two men pressed from a county gaol where they had been imprisoned for brewing illicit liquor.I had seized on these gratefully and put them to work building a still in whichto the horror of the crewhalf the ships store of rum was being distilled into pure alcohol for disinfection.I had posted one of the surviving midshipmen by the entrance to the sickbay and another by the galley, each armed with a basin of pure alcohol and instructions to see that no one went in or came out without dipping their hands.Beside each midshipman stood a marine with his rifle, charged with the duty of seeing that no one should drink the grimy contents of the barrel into which the used alcohol was emptied when it became too filthy to be used any longer.In Mrs.Johansen, the gunners wife, I had found an unexpected ally.An intelligent woman in her thirties, she had understooddespite her having only a few words of broken English, and my having no Swedish at allwhat I wanted done, and had done it.If Elias was my right hand, Annekje Johansen was the left.She had single handedly taken over the responsibility of scalding the goats milk, patiently pounding hard biscuitremoving the weevils as she did soto be mixed with it, and feeding the resulting mixture to those hands strong enough to digest it.Her own husband, the chief gunner, was one of the victims of the typhoid, but he fortunately seemed one of the lighter cases, and I had every hope that he might recoveras much because of his wifes devoted nursing as because of his own hardy constitution.Maam, Ruthven says as somebodys been a drinking of the pure alcohol again.Elias Pound popped up at my elbow, his round pink face looking drawn and wan, substantially thinned by the pressures of the last few days.I said something extremely bad, and his brown eyes widened.Sorry, I said.I wiped the back of a hand across my brow, trying to get my hair out of my eyes.Dont mean to offend your tender ears, Elias.Oh, Ive heard it before, maam, Elias assured me.Just not from a lady, like.Im not a lady, Elias, I said tiredly.Im a doctor.Have someone go and search the ship for whoever it was; theyll likely be unconscious by now.He nodded and whirled on one foot.Ill look in the cable tier, he said.Thats where they usually hide when theyre drunk.This was the fourth in the last three days.Despite all guards set over the still and the purified alcohol, the hands, living on half their usual daily ration of grog, were so desperate for drink that they contrived somehow to get at the pure grain alcohol meant for sterilization.Goodness, Mrs.Malcolm, the purser had said, shaking his bald head when I complained about the problem.Seamen will drink anything, maam!Spoilt plum brandy, peaches mashed inside a rubber boot and left to fermentwhy, Ive even known a hand caught stealing the old bandages from the surgeons quarters and soaking them, in hopes of getting a whiff of alcohol.No, maam, telling them that drinking it will kill them certainly wont stop them.Kill them it did.One of the four men who had drunk it had died; two more were in their own boarded off section of the sickbay, deeply comatose.If they survived, they were likely to be permanently brain damaged.Not that being on a bloody floating hellhole like this isnt likely to brain damage anyone, I remarked bitterly to a tern who alighted on the rail nearby.As if it isnt enough, trying to save half the miserable lot from typhoid, now the other half is trying to kill themselves with my alcohol!Damn the bloody lot of them!The tern cocked its head, decided I was not edible, and flew away.The ocean stretched empty all aroundbefore us, where the unknown West Indies concealed Young Ians fate, and behind, where Jamie and the Artemis had long since vanished.And me in the middle, with six hundred drink mad English sailors and a hold full of inflamed bowels.I stood fuming for a moment, then turned with decision toward the forward gangway.I didnt care if Captain Leonard was personally pumping the bilges, he was going to talk to me.I stopped just inside the door of the cabin.It was not yet noon, but the Captain was asleep, head pillowed on his forearms, on top of an outspread book.The quill had fallen from his fingers, and the glass inkstand, cleverly held in its anchored bracket, swayed gently with the motion of the ship.His face was turned to the side, cheek pressed flat on his arm.Despite the heavy beard stubble, he looked absurdly young.I turned, meaning to come back later, but in moving, brushed against the locker, where a stack of books was precariously balanced amid a rubble of papers, navigational instruments, and half rolled charts.The top volume fell with a thump to the deck.The sound was scarcely audible above the general sounds of creaking, flapping, whining rigging, and shouting that made up the background of life on shipboard, but it brought him awake, blinking and looking startled.Mrs.FraMrs.Malcolm!he said.He rubbed a hand over his face, and shook his head quickly, trying to wake himself.Whatthat isyou required something?I didnt mean to wake you, I said.But I do need more alcoholif necessary, I can use straight rumand you really must speak to the hands, to see if there is some way of stopping them trying to drink the distilled alcohol.Weve had another thats poisoned himself today.And if theres any way of bringing more fresh air down to the sickbay I stopped, seeing that I was overwhelming him.He blinked and scratched, slowly pulling his thoughts into order.The buttons on his sleeve had left two round red imprints on his cheek, and his hair was flattened on that side.I see, he said, rather stupidly.Then, as he began to wake, his expression cleared.Yes.Of course.I will give orders to have a windsail rigged, to bring more air below.As for the alcoholI must beg leave to consult the purser, as I do not myself know our present capacities in that regard.He turned and took a breath, as though to shout, but then remembered that his steward was no longer within earshot, being now below in the sickbay.Just then, the ting of the ships bell came faintly from above.I beg your pardon, Mrs.Malcolm, he said, politeness recovered.It is nearly noon; I must go and take our position.I will send the purser to you, should you care to remain here for a moment.Thank you.I sat down in the chair he had just vacated.He turned to go, making an attempt to straighten the too large braided coat over his shoulders.Captain Leonard?I said, moved by a sudden impulse.He turned back, questioning.If you dont mind my askinghow old are you?He blinked and his face tightened, but he answered me.I am nineteen, maam.Your servant, maam.And with that, he vanished through the door.I could hear him in the companionway, calling out in a voice half cracked with fatigue.Nineteen!I sat quite still, paralyzed with shock.I had thought him very young, but not nearly that young.His face weathered from exposure and lined with strain and sleeplessness, he had looked to be at least in his mid twenties.My God!I thought, appalled.Hes no more than a baby!Nineteen.Just Briannas age.And to be suddenly thrust into command not only of a shipand not just a ship, but an English man of warand not merely a man of war, but one with a plague aboard that had deprived her suddenly of a quarter of her crew and virtually all her commandI felt the fright and fury that had bubbled inside me for the last few days begin to ebb, as I realized that the high handedness that had led him to kidnap me was in fact not arrogance or ill judgment, but the result of sheer desperation.He had to have help, he had said.Well, he was right, and I was it.I took a deep breath, visualizing the mess I had left behind in the sickbay.That was mine, and mine alone, to do the best I could with.Captain Leonard had left the logbook open on the desk, his entry half complete.There was a small damp spot on the page; he had drooled slightly in his sleep.In a spasm of irritated pity, I flipped over the page, wishing to hide this further evidence of his vulnerability.My eye caught a word on the new page, and I stopped, a chill snaking down from the nape of my neck as I remembered something.When I had wakened him unexpectedly, the captain had started up, seen me, and said, Mrs.Fra before catching himself.And the name on the page before me, the word that had caught my attention, was Fraser.He knew who I wasand who Jamie was.I rose quickly and shut the door, dropping the bolt.At least I would have warning if anyone came.Then I sat down at the captains desk, pressed flat the pages, and began to read.I flipped back to find the record of the meeting with the Artemis, three days before.Captain Leonards entries were distinct from those of his predecessor, and mostly quite briefnot surprising, considering how much he had had to deal with of late.Most entries contained only the usual navigational information, with a brief note of the names of those men who had died since the previous day.The meeting with the Artemis was noted, though, and my own presence.3 February, 1767.Met near eight bells with Artemis, a small two masted brig under French colors.Hailed her and requested the assistance of her surgeon, C.  Malcolm, who was taken on board and remains with us to assist with the sick.C.  Malcolm, eh?No mention of my being a woman; perhaps he thought it irrelevant, or wished to avoid any inquiries over the propriety of his actions.I went on to the next entry.4 February 1767.I have recd information this day from Harry Tompkins, able seaman, that the supercargo of the brig Artemis is known to him as a criminal by the name of James Fraser, known also by the names of Jamie Roy and of Alexander Malcolm.This Fraser is a seditionist, and a notorious smuggler, for whose capture a substantial reward is offered by the Kings Customs.Information was received from Tompkins after we had parted company with Artemis; I thought it not expeditious to pursue Artemis, as we are ordered with all possible dispatch for Jamaica, because of our passenger.However, as I have promised to return the Artemiss surgeon to them there, Fraser may be arrested at that time.Two men dead of the plaguewhich the Artemiss surgeon informs me is the Typhoide.Jno.Jaspers, able seaman, DD, Harty Kepple, cooks mate, DD.That was all; the next days entry was confined entirely to navigation and the recording of the death of six men, all with DD written beside their names.I wondered what it meant, but was too distracted to worry about it.I heard steps coming down the passageway, and barely got the bolt lifted before the pursers knock sounded on the door.I scarcely heard Mr.Overholts apologies; my mind was too busy trying to make sense of this new revelation.Who in blinking, bloody hell was this man Tompkins?No one I had ever seen or heard about, I was sure, and yet he obviously knew a dangerous amount about Jamies activities.Which led to two questions: How had an English seaman come by such informationand who else knew it?cut the grog rations further, to give you an additional cask of rum, Mr.Overholt was saying dubiously.The hands wont like it, but we might manage; were only two weeks out of Jamaica now.Whether they like it or not, I need the alcohol more than they need grog, I answered brusquely.If they complain too much, tell them if I dont have the rum, none of them may make it to Jamaica.Mr.Overholt sighed, and wiped small beads of sweat from his shiny brow.Ill tell them, maam, he said, too beaten down to object.Fine.Oh, Mr.Overholt?He turned back, questioning.What does the legend DD mean?I saw the Captain write it in his log.A small flicker of humor lighted in the pursers deep sunk eyes.It means Discharged, Dead, maam, he replied.The only sure way for most of us, of leaving His Majestys Navy.As I oversaw the bathing of bodies and the constant infusions of sweetened water and boiled milk, my mind continued to work on the problem of the unknown Tompkins.I knew nothing of the man, save his voice.He might be one of the faceless horde overhead, the silhouettes that I saw in the rigging when I came up on deck for air, or one of the hurrying anonymous bodies, hurtling up and down the decks in a vain effort to do the work of three men.I would meet him, of course, if he became infected; I knew the names of each patient in the sickbay.But I could hardly allow the matter to wait, in the rather ghoulish hope that Tompkins would contract typhoid.At last I made up my mind to ask; the man presumably knew who I was, anyway.Even if he found out that I had been asking about him, it was unlikely to do any harm.Elias was the natural place to begin.I waited until the end of the day to ask, trusting to fatigue to dull his natural curiosity.Tompkins?The boys round face drew together in a brief frown, then cleared.Oh, yes, maam.One o the forecastle hands.Where did he come aboard, do you know?There was no good way of accounting for this sudden interest in a man I had never met, but luckily, Elias was much too tired to wonder about it.Oh, he said vaguely, at Spithead, I think.Orno!I remember now, twas Edinburgh.He rubbed his knuckles under his nose to stifle a yawn.Thats it, Edinburgh.I wouldn remember, only he was a pressed man, and a unholy fuss he made about it, claimin as how they couldn press him, he was protected, account of he worked for Sir Percival Turner, in the Customs.The yawn got the better of him and he gaped widely, then subsided.But he didn have no written protection from Sir Percival, he concluded, blinking, so there wasn nothing to be done.A Customs agent, was he?That went quite some way toward explaining things, all right.Mm hm.Yes, mum, I mean.Elias was trying manfully to stay awake, but his glazing eyes were fixed on the swaying lantern at the end of the sickbay, and he was swaying with it.You go on to bed, Elias, I said, taking pity on him.Ill finish here.He shook his head quickly, trying to shake off sleep.Oh, no, maam!I aint sleepy, not a bit!He reached clumsily for the cup and bottle I held.You give me that, mum, and go to rest yourself.He would not be moved, but stubbornly insisted on helping to administer the last round of water before staggering off to his cot.I was nearly as tired as Elias by the time we finished, but sleep would not come.I lay in the dead surgeons cabin, staring up at the shadowy beam above my head, listening to the creak and rumble of the ship about me, wondering.So Tompkins worked for Sir Percival.And Sir Percival assuredly knew that Jamie was a smuggler.But was there more to it than that?Tompkins knew Jamie by sight.How?And if Sir Percival had been willing to tolerate Jamies clandestine activities in return for bribes, thenwell, perhaps none of those bribes had made it to Tompkinss pockets.But in that caseand what about the ambush at Arbroath cove?Was there a traitor among the smugglers?And if so  My thoughts were losing coherence, spinning in circles like the revolutions of a dying top.The powdered white face of Sir Percival faded into the purple mask of the hanged Customs agent on the Arbroath road, and the gold and red flames of an exploding lantern lit the crevices of my mind.I rolled onto my stomach, clutching the pillow to my chest, the last thought in my mind that I must find Tompkins.As it was, Tompkins found me.For more than two days, the situation in the sickbay was too pressing for me to leave for more than the barest space of time.On the third day, though, matters seemed easier, and I retired to the surgeons cabin, intending to wash myself and rest briefly before the midday drum beat for the noon meal.I was lying on the cot, a cool cloth over my tired eyes, when I heard the sound of bumping and voices in the passage outside my door.A tentative knock sounded on my door, and an unfamiliar voice said, Mrs.Malcolm?Theres been a haccident, if you please, maam.I swung open the door to find two seamen supporting a third, who stood storklike on one leg, his face white with shock and pain.It took no more than a single glance for me to know whom I was looking at.The mans face was ridged down one side with the livid scars of a bad burn, and the twisted eyelid on that side exposed the milky lens of a blind eye, had I needed any further confirmation that here stood the one eyed seaman Young Ian had thought hed killed, lank brown hair grew back from a balding brow to a scrawny pigtail that drooped over one shoulder, exposing a pair of large, transparent ears.Mr.Tompkins, I said with certainty, and his remaining eye widened in surprise.Put him down over there, please.The men deposited Tompkins on a stool by the wall, and went back to their work; the ship was too shorthanded to allow for distraction.Heart beating heavily, I knelt down to examine the wounded leg.He knew who I was, all right; I had seen it in his face when I opened the door.There was a great deal of tension in the leg under my hand.The injury was gory, but not serious, given suitable care; a deep gash scored down the calf of the leg.It had bled substantially, but there were no deep arteries cut; it had been well wrapped with a piece of someones shirt, and the bleeding had nearly stopped when I unwound the homemade bandage.How did you do this, Mr.Tompkins?I asked, standing up and reaching for the bottle of alcohol.He glanced up, his single eye alert and wary.Splinter wound, maam, he answered, in the nasal tones I had heard once before.A spar broke as I was a standing on it.The tip of his tongue stole out, furtively wetting his lower lip.I see.I turned and flipped open the lid of my empty medicine box, pretending to survey the available remedies.I studied him out of the corner of one eye, while I tried to think how best to approach him.He was on his guard; tricking him into revelations or winning his trust were clearly out of the question.My eyes flicked over the tabletop, seeking inspiration.And found it.With a mental apology to the shade of Aesculapius the physician, I picked up the late surgeons bone saw, a wicked thing some eighteen inches long, a rust flecked steel.I looked at this thoughtfully, turned, and laid the toothed edge of the instrument gently against the injured leg, just above the knee.I smiled charmingly into the seamans terrified single eye.Mr.Tompkins, I said, let us talk frankly.An hour later, able bodied seaman Tompkins had been restored to his hammock, stitched and bandaged, shaking in every limb, but able bodied still.For my part, I felt a little shaky as well.Tompkins was, as he had insisted to the press gang in Edinburgh, an agent of Sir Percival Turner.In that capacity, he went about the docks and warehouses of all the shipping ports in the Firth of Forth, from Culross and Donibristle to Restalrig and Musselburgh, picking up gossip and keeping his beady eye sharp peeled to catch any evidence of unlawful activity.The attitude of Scots toward English tax laws being what it was, there was no lack of such activity to report.What was done with such reports, though, varied.Small smugglers, caught red handed with a bottle or two of unbonded rum or whisky, might be summarily arrested, tried and convicted, and sentenced to anything from penal servitude to transportation, with forfeiture of all their property to the Crown.The bigger fish, though, were reserved to Sir Percivals private judgment.In other words, allowed to pay substantial bribes for the privilege of continuing their operations under the blind eye (here Tompkins laughed sardonically, touching the ruined side of his face) of the Kings agents.Sir Percivals got ambitions, see?While not noticeably relaxed, Tompkins had at least unbent enough to lean forward, one eye narrowing as he gestured in explanation.Hes in with Dundas and all them.Everything goes right, and he might have a peerage, not just a knighthood, eh?But thatll take more than money.One thing that could help was some spectacular demonstration of competence and service to the Crown.As in the sort of arrest that might make em sit up and take notice, eh?Ooh!That smarts, missus.You sure of what youre a doing of, there?Tompkins squinted dubiously downward, to where I was sponging the site of the injury with dilute alcohol.Im sure, I said.Go on, then.I suppose a simple smuggler wouldnt have been good enough, no matter how big?Evidently not.However, when word had reached Sir Percival that there might just possibly be a major political criminal within his grasp, the old gentleman had nearly blown a gasket with excitement.But seditions a harder thing to prove than smuggling, eh?You catch one of the little fish with the goods, and theyre saying not a thing will lead you further on.Idealists, them seditionists, Tompkins said, shaking his head with disgust.Never rat on each other, they dont.So you didnt know who you were looking for?I stood and took one of my cat gut sutures from its jar, threading it through a needle.I caught Tompkinss apprehensive look, but did nothing to allay his anxiety.I wanted him anxiousand voluble.No, we didnt know who the big fish wasnot until another of Sir Percivals agents had the luck to tumble to one of Frasers associates, what gave em the tip he was Malcolm the printer, and told his real name.Then it all come clear, o course.My heart skipped a beat.Who was the associate?I asked.The names and faces of the six smugglers darted through my mindlittle fish.Not idealists, any of them.But to which of them was loyalty no bar?I dont know.No, its true, missus, I swear!Ow!he said frantically as I jabbed the needle under the skin.Im not trying to hurt you, I assured him, in as false a voice as I could muster.I have to stitch the wound, though.Oh!Ow!I dont know, to be sure I dont!Id tell, if I did, as Gods my witness!Im sure you would, I said, intent on my stitching.Oh!Please, missus!Stop!Just for a moment!All I know is it was an Englishman!Thats all!I stopped, and stared up at him.An Englishman?I said blankly.Yes, missus.Thats what Sir Percival said.He looked down at me, tears trembling on the lashes of both his eyes.I took the final stitch, as gently as I could, and tied the suture knot.Without speaking, I got up, poured a small tot of brandy from my private bottle, and handed it to him.He gulped it gratefully, and seemed much restored in consequence.Whether out of gratitude, or sheer relief for the end of the ordeal, he told me the rest of the story.In search of evidence to support a charge of sedition, he had gone to the printshop in Carfax Close.I know what happened there, I assured him.I turned his face toward the light, examining the burn scars.Is it still painful?No, Missus, but it hurt precious bad for some time, he said.Being incapacitated by his injuries, Tompkins had taken no part in the ambush at Arbroath cove, but he had heardnot direct like, but I heard, you know, he said, with a shrewd nod of the headwhat had happened.Sir Percival had given Jamie warning of an ambush, to lessen the chances of Jamies thinking him involved in the affair, and possibly revealing the details of their financial arrangements in quarters where such revelations would be detrimental to Sir Percivals interests.At the same time, Sir Percival had learnedfrom the associate, the mysterious Englishmanof the fallback arrangement with the French delivery vessel, and had arranged the grave ambush on the beach at Arbroath.But what about the Customs officer who was killed on the road?I asked sharply.I couldnt repress a small shudder, at memory of that dreadful face.Who did that?There were only five men among the smugglers who could possibly have done it, and none of them are Englishmen!Tompkins rubbed a hand over his mouth; he seemed to be debating the wisdom of telling me or not.I picked up the brandy bottle and set it by his elbow.Why, Im much obliged, Missus Fraser!Youre a true Christian, missus, and so I shall tell anyone who asks!Skip the testimonials, I said dryly.Just tell me what you know about the Customs officer.He filled the cup and drained it, sipping slowly.Then, with a sigh of satisfaction, he set it down and licked his lips.It wasnt none of the smugglers done him in, missus.It was his own mate.What!I jerked back, startled, but he nodded, blinking his good eye in token of sincerity.Thats right, missus.There was two of em, wasnt there?Well, the one of them had his instructions, didnt he?The instructions had been to wait until whatever smugglers escaped the ambush on the beach had reached the road, whereupon the Customs officer was to drop a noose over his partners head in the dark and strangle him swiftly, then string him up and leave him, as evidence of the smugglers murderous wrath.But why?I said, bewildered and horrified.What was the point of doing that?Do you not see?Tompkins looked surprised, as though the logic of the situation should be obvious.Wed failed to get the evidence from the printshop that would have proved the case of sedition against Fraser, and with the shop burnt to the ground, no possibility of another chance.Nor had we ever caught Fraser red handed with the goods himself, only some of the small fish who worked for him.One of the other agents thought hed a clue where the stuff was kept, but something happened to himperhaps Fraser caught him or bought him off, for he disappeared one day in November, and wasnt heard of again, nor the hiding place for the contraband, neither.I see.I swallowed, thinking of the man who had accosted me on the stairs of the brothel.What had become of that cask of crme de menthe?But  Well, Im telling you, missus, just you wait.Tompkins raised a monitory hand.Soheres Sir Percival, knowing as hes got a rare case, with a mans not only one of the biggest smugglers on the Firth, and the author of some of the most first rate seditious material its been my privilege to see, but is also a pardoned Jacobite traitor, whose name will make the trial a sensation from one end of the kingdom to the other.The only trouble beinghe shruggedas theres no evidence.It began to make a hideous sort of sense, as Tompkins explained the plan.The murder of a Customs officer killed in pursuit of duty would not only make any smuggler arrested for the crime subject to a capital charge, but was the sort of heinous crime that would cause a major public outcry.The matter of fact acceptance that smugglers enjoyed from the populace would not protect them in a matter of such callous villainy.Your Sir Percival has got the makings of a really first class son of a bitch, I observed.Tompkins nodded meditatively, blinking into his cup.Well, youve the right of it there, missus, Ill not say youre wrong.And the Customs officer who was killedI suppose he was just a convenience?Tompkins sniggered, with a fine spray of brandy.His one eye seemed to be having some trouble focusing.Oh, very convenient, Missus, more ways than one.Dont you grieve none on his account.There was a good many folk glad enough to see Tom Oakie swingand not the least of em, Sir Percival.I see.I finished fastening the bandage about his calf.It was getting late; I would have to get back to the sickbay soon.Id better call someone to take you to your hammock, I said, taking the nearly empty bottle from his unresisting hand.You should rest your leg for at least three days; tell your officer I said you cant go aloft until Ive taken out the stitches.Ill do that, missus, and I thank you for your kindness to a poor unfortunate sailor.Tompkins made an abortive attempt to stand, looking surprised when he failed.I got a hand under his armpit and heaved, getting him on his feet, andhe declining my offer to summon him assistancehelped him to the door.You neednt worry about Harry Tompkins, missus, he said, weaving unsteadily into the corridor.He turned and gave me an exaggerated wink.Old Harry always ends up all right, no matter what.Looking at him, with his long nose, pink tipped from liquor, his large, transparent ears, and his single sly brown eye, it came to me suddenly what he reminded me of.When were you born, Mr.Tompkins?I asked.He blinked for a moment, uncomprehending, but then said, The Year of our Lord 1713, missus.Why?No reason, I said, and waved him off, watching as he caromed slowly down the corridor, dropping out of sight at the ladder like a bag of oats.I would have to check with Mr.Willoughby to be sure, but at the moment, I would have wagered my chemise that 1713 had been a Year of the Rat.48  MOMENT OF GRACE  Over the next few days, a routine set in, as it does in even the most desperate circumstances, provided that they continue long enough.The hours after a battle are urgent and chaotic, with mens lives hanging on a seconds action.Here a doctor can be heroic, knowing for certain that the wound just stanched has saved a life, that the quick intervention will save a limb.But in an epidemic, there is none of that.Then come the long days of constant watching and battles fought on the field of germsand with no weapons suited to that field, it can be no more than a battle of delay, doing the small things that may not help but must be done, over and over and over again, fighting the invisible enemy of disease, in the tenuous hope that the body can be supported long enough to outlast its attacker.To fight disease without medicine is to push against a shadow; a darkness that spreads as inexorably as night.I had been fighting for nine days, and forty six more men were dead.Still, I rose each day at dawn, splashed water into my grainy eyes, and went once more to the field of war, unarmed with anything save persistenceand a barrel of alcohol.There were some victories, but even these left a bitter taste in my mouth.I found the likely source of infectionone of the messmates, a man named Howard.First serving on board as a member of one of the gun crews, Howard had been transferred to galley duty six weeks before, the result of an accident with a recoiling gun carriage that had crushed several fingers.Howard had served the gun room, and the first known case of the diseasetaken from the incomplete records of the dead surgeon, Mr.Hunterwas one of the marines who messed there.Four more cases, all from the gun room, and then it had begun to spread, as infected but still ambulatory men left the deadly contamination smeared in the ships heads, to be picked up there and passed to the crew at large.Howards admission that he had seen sickness like this before, on other ships where he had served, was enough to clinch the matter.However, the cook, shorthanded as everyone else aboard, had declined absolutely to part with a valuable hand, only because of a goddamned females silly notion!Elias could not persuade him, and I had been obliged to summon the captain himself, whomisunderstanding the nature of the disturbance, had arrived with several armed marines.There was a most unpleasant scene in the galley, and Howard was removed to the brigthe only place of certain quarantineprotesting in bewilderment, and demanding to know his crime.As I came up from the galley, the sun was going down into the ocean in a blaze that paved the western sea with gold like the streets of Heaven.I stopped for a moment, just a moment, transfixed by the sight.It had happened many times before, but it always took me by surprise.Always in the midst of great stress, wading waist deep in trouble and sorrow, as doctors do, I would glance out a window, open a door, look into a face, and there it would be, unexpected and unmistakable.A moment of peace.The light spread from the sky to the ship, and the great horizon was no longer a blank threat of emptiness, but the habitation of joy.For a moment, I lived in the center of the sun, warmed and cleansed, and the smell and sight of sickness fell away; the bitterness lifted from my heart.I never looked for it, gave it no name; yet I knew it always, when the gift of peace came.I stood quite still for the moment that it lasted, thinking it strange and not strange that grace should find me here, too.Then the light shifted slightly and the moment passed, leaving me as it always did, with the lasting echo of its presence.In a reflex of acknowledgment, I crossed myself and went below, my tarnished armor faintly gleaming.Elias Pound died of the typhoid four days later.It was a virulent infection; he came to the sickbay heavy eyed with fever and wincing at the light; six hours later he was delirious and unable to rise.The next dawn he pressed his cropped round head against my bosom, called me Mother, and died in my arms.I did what had to be done throughout the day, and stood by Captain Leonard at sunset, when he read the burial service.The body of Midshipman Pound was consigned to the sea, wrapped in his hammock.I declined the Captains invitation to dinner, and went instead to sit in a remote corner of the afterdeck, next to one of the great guns, where I could look out over the water, showing my face to no one.The sun went down in gold and glory, succeeded by a night of starred velvet, but there was no moment of grace, no peace in either sight for me.As the darkness settled over the ship, all her movements began to slow.I leaned my head against the gun, the polished metal cool under my cheek.A seaman passed me at a fast walk, intent on his duties, and then I was alone.I ached desperately; my head throbbed, my back was stiff and my feet swollen, but none of these was of any significance, compared to the deeper ache that knotted my heart.Any doctor hates to lose a patient.Death is the enemy, and to lose someone in your care to the clutch of the dark angel is to be vanquished yourself, to feel the rage of betrayal and impotence, beyond the common, human grief of loss and the horror of deaths finality.I had lost twenty three men between dawn and sunset of this day.Elias was only the first.Several had died as I sponged their bodies or held their hands; others, alone in their hammocks, had died uncomforted even by a touch, because I could not reach them in time.I thought I had resigned myself to the realities of this time, but knowingeven as I held the twitching body of an eighteen year old seaman as his bowels dissolved in blood and waterthat penicillin would have saved most of them, and I had none, was galling as an ulcer, eating at my soul.The box of syringes and ampules had been left behind on the Artemis, in the pocket of my spare skirt.If I had had it, I could not have used it.If I had used it, I could have saved no more than one or two.But even knowing that, I raged at the futility of it all, clenching my teeth until my jaw ached as I went from man to man, armed with nothing but boiled milk and biscuit, and my two empty hands.My mind followed the same dizzying lines my feet had traveled earlier, seeing facesfaces contorted in anguish or smoothing slowly in the slackness of death, but all of them looking at me.At me.I lifted my futile hand and slammed it hard against the rail.I did it again, and again, scarcely feeling the sting of the blows, in a frenzy of furious rage and grief.Stop that!a voice spoke behind me, and a hand seized my wrist, preventing me from slapping the rail yet again.Let go!I struggled, but his grip was too strong.Stop, he said again, firmly.His other arm came around my waist, and he pulled me back, away from the rail.You mustnt do that, he said.Youll hurt yourself.I dont bloody care!I wrenched against his grasp, but then slumped, defeated.What did it matter?He let go of me then, and I turned to find myself facing a man I had never seen before.He wasnt a sailor; while his clothes were crumpled and stale with long wear, they had originally been very fine; the dove gray coat and waistcoat had been tailored to flatter his slender frame, and the wilted lace at his throat had come from Brussels.Who the hell are you?I said in astonishment.I brushed at my wet cheeks, sniffed, and made an instinctive effort to smooth down my hair.I hoped the shadows hid my face.He smiled slightly, and handed me a handkerchief, crumpled, but clean.My name is Grey, he said, with a small, courtly bow.I expect that you must be the famous Mrs.Malcolm, whose heroism Captain Leonard has been so strongly praising.I grimaced at that, and he paused.I am sorry, he said.Have I said something amiss?My apologies, Madame, I had no notion of offering you offense.He looked anxious at the thought, and I shook my head.It is not heroic to watch men die, I said.My words were thick, and I stopped to blow my nose.Im just here, thats all.Thank you for the handkerchief.I hesitated, not wanting to hand the used handkerchief back to him, but not wanting simply to pocket it, either.He solved the dilemma with a dismissive wave of his hand.Might I do anything else for you?He hesitated, irresolute.A cup of water?Some brandy, perhaps?He fumbled in his coat, drawing out a small silver pocket flask engraved with a coat of arms, which he offered to me.I took it, with a nod of thanks, and took a swallow deep enough to make me cough.It burned down the back of my throat, but I sipped again, more cautiously this time, and felt it warm me, easing and strengthening.I breathed deeply and drank again.It helped.Thank you, I said, a little hoarsely, handing back the flask.That seemed somewhat abrupt, and I added, Id forgotten that brandy is good to drink; Ive been using it to wash people in the sickbay.The statement brought back the events of the day to me with crushing vividness, and I sagged back onto the powder box where I had been sitting.I take it the plague continues unabated?he asked quietly.He stood in front of me, the glow of a nearby lantern shining on his dark blond hair.Not unabated, no.I closed my eyes, feeling unutterably bleak.There was only one new case today.There were four the day before, and six the day before that.That sounds hopeful, he observed.As though you are defeating the disease.I shook my head slowly.It felt dense and heavy as one of the cannonballs piled in the shallow bins by the guns.No.All were doing is to stop more men being infected.There isnt a bloody thing I can do for the ones who already have it.Indeed.He stooped and picked up one of my hands.Surprised, I let him have it.He ran a thumb lightly over the blister where I had burned myself scalding milk, and touched my knuckles, reddened and cracked from the constant immersion in alcohol.You would appear to have been very active, Madame, for someone who is doing nothing, he said dryly.Of course Im doing something!I snapped, yanking my hand back.It doesnt do any good!Im sure he began.It doesnt!I slammed my fist on the gun, the noiseless blow seeming to symbolize the pain filled futility of the day.Do you know how many men I lost today?Twenty three!Ive been on my feet since dawn, elbow deep in filth and vomit and my clothes stuck to me, and none of its been any good!I couldnt help!Do you hear me?I couldnt help!His face was turned away, in shadow, but his shoulders were stiff.I hear you, he said quietly.You shame me, Madam.I had kept to my cabin at the Captains orders, but I had no idea that the circumstances were such as you describe, or I assure you that I should have come to help, in spite of them.Why?I said blankly.It isnt your job.Is it yours?He swung around to face me, and I saw that he was handsome, in his late thirties, perhaps, with sensitive, fine cut features, and large blue eyes, open in astonishment.Yes, I said.He studied my face for a moment, and his own expression changed, fading from surprise to thoughtfulness.I see.No, you dont, but it doesnt matter.I pressed my fingertips hard against my brow, in the spot Mr.Willoughby had shown me, to relieve headache.If the Captain means you to keep to your cabin, then you likely should.There are enough hands to help in the sickbay; its just thatnothing helps, I ended, dropping my hands.He walked over to the rail, a few feet away from me, and stood looking out over the expanse of dark water, sparked here and there as a random wave caught the starlight.I do see, he repeated, as though talking to the waves.I had thought your distress due only to a womans natural compassion, but I see it is something quite different.He paused, hands gripping the rail, an indistinct figure in the starlight.I have been a soldier, an officer, he said.I know what it is, to hold mens lives in your handand to lose them.I was quiet, and so was he.The usual shipboard sounds went on in the distance, muted by night and the lack of men to make them.At last he sighed and turned toward me again.What it comes to, I think, is the knowledge that you are not God.He paused, then added, softly, And the very real regret that you cannot be.I sighed, feeling some of the tension drain out of me.The cool wind lifted the weight of my hair from my neck, and the curling ends drifted across my face, gentle as a touch.Yes, I said.He hesitated a moment, as though not knowing what to say next, then bent, picked up my hand, and kissed it, very simply, without affectation.Good night, Mrs.Malcolm, he said, and turned away, the sound of his footsteps loud on the deck.He was no more than a few yards past me when a seaman, hurrying by, spotted him and stopped with a cry.It was Jones, one of the stewards.My Lord!You shouldnt ought to be out of your cabin, sir!The night airs mortal, and the plague loose on boardand the Captains orderswhatever is your servant a thinking of, sir, to let you walk about like this?My acquaintance nodded apologetically.Yes, yes, I know.I shouldnt have come up; but I thought that if I stayed in the cabin a moment longer I should be stifled altogether.Better stifled than dead o the bloody flux, sir, and youll pardon of my saying so, Jones replied sternly.My acquaintance made no remonstrance to this, but merely murmured something and disappeared in the shadows of the afterdeck.I reached out a hand and grasped Jones by the sleeve as he passed, causing him to start, with a wordless yelp of alarm.Oh!Mrs.Malcolm, he said, coming to earth, a bony hand splayed across his chest.Christ, I did think you was a ghost, mum, begging your pardon.I beg yours, I said, politely.I only wanted to askwho was the man you were just talking to?Oh, him?Jones twisted about to look over his shoulder, but the aptly named Mr.Grey had long since vanished.Why, thats Lord John Grey, mum, him as is the new governor of Jamaica.He frowned censoriously in the direction taken by my acquaintance.He aint supposed to be up here; the Captains give strict orders hes to stay safe below, out o harms way.All we needs to come into port with a dead political aboard, and therell be the devil to pay, mum, savin your presence.He shook his head disapprovingly, then turned to me with a bob of the head.Youll be retiring, mum?Shall I bring you down a nice cup of tea and maybe a bit o biscuit?No, thank you, Jones, I said.Ill go and check the sickbay again before I go to bed.I dont need anything.Well, you do, mum, and you just say.Anytime.Good night to you, mum.He touched his forelock briefly and hurried off.I stood at the rail alone for a moment before going below, drawing in deep breaths of the clean, fresh air.It would be a good many hours yet until dawn; the stars burned bright and clear over my head, and I realized, quite suddenly, that the moment of grace I had wordlessly prayed for had come, after all.Youre right, I said at last, aloud, to the sea and sky.A sunset wouldnt have been enough.Thank you, I added, and went below.49  LAND HO!Its true, what the sailors say.You can smell land, a long time before you see it.Despite the long voyage, the goat pen in the hold was a surprisingly pleasant place.By now, the fresh straw had been exhausted, and the goats hooves clicked restlessly to and fro on bare boards.Still, the heaps of manure were swept up daily, and neatly piled in baskets to be heaved overboard, and Annekje Johansen brought dry armloads of hay to the manger each morning.There was a strong smell of goat, but it was a clean, animal scent, and quite pleasant by contrast with the stench of unwashed sailors.Komma, komma, komma, dyr get, she crooned, luring a yearling within reach with a twiddled handful of hay.The animal stretched out cautious lips, and was promptly seized by the neck and pulled forward, its head secured under Annekjes brawny arm.Ticks, is it?I asked, coming forward to help.Annekje looked up and gave me her broad, gap toothed smile.Guten Morgen, Mrs.Claire, she said.Ja, tick.Here.She took the young goats drooping ear in one hand and turned up the silky edge to show me the blueberry bulge of a blood gorged tick, burrowed deep in the tender skin.She clutched the goat to hold it still, and dug into the ear, pinching the tick viciously between her nails.She pulled it free with a twist, and the goat blatted and kicked, a tiny spot of blood welling from its ear where the tick had been detached.Wait, I said, when she would have released the animal.She glanced at me, curious, but kept her hold and nodded.I took the bottle of alcohol I wore slung at my belt like a sidearm, and poured a few drops on the ear.It was soft and tender, the tiny veins clearly visible beneath the satin skin.The goats square pupilled eyes bulged farther and its tongue stuck out in agitation as it bleated.No sore ear, I said, in explanation, and Annekje nodded in approval.Then the goatling was free, and went plunging back into the herd, to butt its head against its mothers side in a frantic search for milky reassurance.Annekje looked about for the discarded tick and found it lying on the deck, tiny legs helpless to move its swollen body.She smashed it casually under the heel of her shoe, leaving a tiny dark blotch on the board.We come to land?I asked, and she nodded, with a wide, happy smile.She waved expansively upward, where sunlight fell through the grating overhead.Ja.Smell?she said, sniffing vigorously in illustration.She beamed.Land, ja!Water, grass.Is goot, goot!I need to go to land, I said, watching her carefully.Go quiet.Secret.Not tell.Ah?Annekjes eyes widened, and she looked at me speculatively.Not tell Captain, ja?Not tell anyone, I said, nodding hard.You can help?She was quiet for a moment, thinking.A big, placid woman, she reminded me of her own goats, adapting cheerfully to the queer life of shipboard, enjoying the pleasures of hay and warm company, thriving despite the lurching deck and stuffy shadows of the hold.With that same air of capable adaptation, she looked up at me and nodded calmly.Ja, I help.It was past midday when we anchored off what one of the midshipmen told me was Watlings Island.I looked over the rail with considerable curiosity.This flat island, with its wide white beaches and lines of low palms, had once been called San Salvador.Renamed for the present in honor of a notorious buccaneer of the last century, this dot of land was presumably Christopher Columbuss first sight of the New World.I had the substantial advantage over Columbus of having known for a fact that the land was here, but still I felt a faint echo of the joy and relief that the sailors of those tiny wooden caravels had felt at that first landfall.Long enough on a rolling ship, and you forget what it is to walk on land.Getting sea legs, they call it.Its a metamorphosis, this leg getting, like the change from tadpole to frog, a painless shift from one element to another.But the smell and sight of land makes you remember that you were born to the earth, and your feet ache suddenly for the touch of solid ground.The problem at the moment was actually getting my feet on solid ground.Watlings Island was no more than a pause, to replenish our severely depleted water supply before the run through the Windward Isles down to Jamaica.It would be at least another weeks sail, and the presence of so many invalids aboard requiring vast infusions of liquid had run the great water casks in the hold nearly dry.San Salvador was a small island, but I had learned from careful questioning of my patients that there was a fair amount of shipping traffic through its main port in Cockburn Town.It might not be the ideal place to escape, but it looked as though there would be little other choice; I had no intention of enjoying the navys hospitality on Jamaica, serving as the bait that would lure Jamie to arrest.Starved as the crew was for the sight and feel of land, no one was allowed to go ashore save the watering party, now busy with their casks and sledges up Pigeon Creek, at whose foot we were anchored.One of the marines stood at the head of the gangway, blocking any attempt at leaving.Such members of the crew as were not involved in watering or on watch stood by the rail, talking and joking or merely gazing at the island, the dream of hope fulfilled.Some way down the deck, I caught sight of a long, blond tail of hair, flying in the shore breeze.The Governor too had emerged from seclusion, pale face upturned to the tropic sun.I would have gone to speak to him, but there was no time.Annekje had already gone below for the goat.I wiped my hands on my skirt, making my final estimations.It was no more than two hundred yards to the thick growth of palms and underbrush.If I could get down the gangway and into the jungle, I thought I had a good chance of getting away.Anxious as he was to be on his way to Jamaica, Captain Leonard was unlikely to waste much time in trying to catch me.And if they did catch mewell, the Captain could hardly punish me for trying to leave the ship; I was neither a seaman nor a formal captive, after all.The sun shone on Annekjes blond head as she made her way carefully up the ladder, a young goat cozily nestled against her wide bosom.A quick glance, to see that I was in place, and she headed for the gangway.Annekje spoke to the sentry in her queer mixture of English and Swedish, pointing to the goat and then ashore, insisting that it must have fresh grass.The marine appeared to understand her, but stood firm.No, maam, he said, respectfully enough, no one is to go ashore save the watering party; captains orders.Standing just out of sight, I watched as she went on arguing, thrusting her goatling urgently in his face, forcing him a step back, a step to the side, maneuvering him artfully just far enough that I could slip past behind him.No more than a moment, now; he was almost in place.When she had drawn him away from the head of the gangplank, she would drop the goat and cause sufficient confusion in the catching of it that I would have a minute or two to make my escape.I shifted nervously from foot to foot.My feet were bare; it would be easier to run on the sandy beach.The sentry moved, his red coated back fully turned to me.A foot more, I thought, just a foot more.Such a fine day, is it not, Mrs.Malcolm?I bit my tongue.Very fine, Captain Leonard, I said, with some difficulty.My heart seemed to have stopped dead when he spoke.It now resumed beating much faster than usual, to make up for lost time.The Captain stepped up beside me and looked over the rail, his young face shining with Columbuss joy.Despite my strong desire to push him overboard, I felt myself smile grudgingly at the sight of him.This landfall is as much your victory as mine, Mrs.Malcolm, he said.Without you, I doubt we should ever have brought the Porpoise to land.He very shyly touched my hand, and I smiled again, a little less grudgingly.Im sure you would have managed, Captain, I said.You seem to be a most competent sailor.He laughed, and blushed.He had shaved in honor of the land, and his smooth cheeks glowed pink and raw.Well, it is mostly the hands, maam; I may say they have done nobly.And their efforts, of course, are due in turn to your skill as a physician.He looked at me, brown eyes shining earnestly.Indeed, Mrs.MalcolmI cannot say what your skill and kindness have meant to us.II mean to say so, too, to the Governor and to Sir Grevilleyou know, the Kings Commissioner on Antigua.I shall write a letter, a most sincere testimonial to you and to your efforts on our behalf.Perhapsperhaps it will help.He dropped his eyes.Help with what, Captain?My heart was still beating fast.Captain Leonard bit his lip, then looked up.I had not meant to say anything to you, maam.But Ireally I cannot in honor keep silence.Mrs.Fraser, I know your name, and I know what your husband is.Really?I said, trying to keep control of my own emotions.What is he?The boy looked surprised at that.Why, maam, he is a criminal.He paled a little.You meanyou did not know?Yes, I knew that, I said dryly.Why are you telling me, though?He licked his lips, but met my eyes bravely enough.When I discovered your husbands identity, I wrote it in the ships log.I regret that action now, but it is too late; the information is official.Once I reach Jamaica, I must report his name and destination to the authorities there, and likewise to the commander at the naval barracks on Antigua.He will be taken when the Artemis docks.He swallowed.And if he is taken  Hell be hanged, I said, finishing what he could not.The boy nodded, wordless.His mouth opened and closed, seeking words.I have seen men hanged, he said at last.Mrs.Fraser, I justI He stopped then, fighting for control, and found it.He drew himself up straight and looked at me straight on, the joy of his landing drowned in sudden misery.I am sorry, he said softly.I cannot ask you to forgive me; I can only say that I am most terribly sorry.He turned on his heel and walked away.Directly before him stood Annekje Johansen and her goat, still in heated conversation with the sentry.What is this?Captain Leonard demanded angrily.Remove this animal from the deck at once!Mr.Holford, what are you thinking of?Annekjes eyes flicked from the captain to my face, instantly divining what had gone wrong.She stood still, head bowed to the captains scolding, then marched away toward the hatchway to the goats hold, clutching her yearling.As she passed, one big blue eye winked solemnly.We would try again.But how?Racked by guilt and bedeviled by contrary winds, Captain Leonard avoided me, seeking refuge on his quarterdeck as we made our cautious way past Acklin Island and Samana Cay.The weather aided him in this evasion; it stayed bright, but with odd, light breezes alternating with sudden gusts, so that constant adjustment of the sails was requiredno easy task, in a ship so shorthanded.It was four days later, as we shifted course to enter the Caicos Passage, that a sudden booming gust of wind struck the ship out of nowhere, catching her ill rigged and unprepared.I was on deck when the gust struck.There was a sudden whoosh that sent my skirts billowing and propelled me flying down the deck, followed by a sharp, loud crack!somewhere overhead.I crashed head on into Ramsdell Hodges, one of the forecastle crew, and we whirled together in a mad pirouette before falling entangled to the deck.There was confusion all around, with hands running and orders shouted.I sat up, trying to collect my scattered wits.What is it?I demanded of Hodges, who staggered to his feet and reached down to lift me up.Whats happened?The fucking mainmasts split, he said succinctly.Saving your presence, maam, but it has.And now therell be hell to pay.The Porpoise limped slowly south, not daring to risk the banks and shoals of the passage without a mainmast.Instead, Captain Leonard put in for repairs at the nearest convenient anchorage, Bottle Creek, on the shore of North Caicos Island.This time, we were allowed ashore, but no great good did it do me.Tiny and dry, with few sources of fresh water, the Turks and Caicos provided little more than numerous tiny bays that might shelter passing ships caught in storms.And the idea of hiding on a foodless, waterless island, waiting for a convenient hurricane to blow me a ship, did not appeal.To Annekje, though, our change of course suggested a new plan.I know these island, she said, nodding wisely.We go round now, Grand Turk, Mouchoir.Not Caicos.I looked askance, and she squatted, drawing with a blunt forefinger in the yellow sand of the beach.SeeCaicos Passage, she said, sketching a pair of lines.At the top, between the lines, she sketched the small triangle of a sail.Go through, she said, indicating the Caicos Passage, but mast is gone.Now She quickly drew several irregular circles, to the right of the passage.North Caicos, South Caicos, Caicos, Grand Turk, she said, stabbing a finger at each circle in turn.Go round nowreefs.Mouchoir.And she drew another pair of lines, indicating a passage to the southeast of Grand Turk Island.Mouchoir Passage?I had heard the sailors mention it, but had no idea how it applied to my potential escape from the Porpoise.Annekje nodded, beaming, then drew a long, wavy line, some way below her previous illustrations.She pointed at it proudly.Hispaniola.St.Domingue.Big island, is there towns, lots ships.I raised my eyebrows, still baffled.She sighed, seeing that I didnt understand.She thought a moment, then stood up, dusting her heavy thighs.We had been gathering whelks from the rocks in a shallow pan.She seized this, dumped out the whelks, and filled it with seawater.Then, laying it on the sand, she motioned to me to watch.She stirred the water carefully, in a circular motion, then lifted her finger out, stained dark with the purple blood of the whelks.The water continued to move, swirling past the tin sides.Annekje pulled a thread from the raveling hem of her skirt, bit off a short piece, and spat it into the water.It floated, following the swirl of the water in lazy circles round the pan.You, she said, pointing at it.Vater move you.She pointed back to her drawing in the sand.A new triangle, in the Mouchoir Passage.A line, curving from the tiny sail down to the left, indicating the ships course.And now, the blue thread representing me, rescued from its immersion.She placed it by the tiny sail representing the Porpoise, then dragged it off, down the Passage toward the coast of Hispaniola.Jump, she said simply.Youre crazy!I said in horror.She chuckled in deep satisfaction at my understanding.Ja, she said.But it vork.Vater move you.She pointed to the end of the Mouchoir Passage, to the coast of Hispaniola, and stirred the water in the pan once more.We stood side by side, watching the ripples of her manufactured current die away.Annekje glanced thoughtfully sideways at me.You try not drown, ja?I took a deep breath and brushed the hair out of my eyes.Ja, I said.Ill try.50  I MEET A PRIEST  The sea was remarkably warm, as seas go, and like a warm bath as compared to the icy surf off Scotland.On the other hand, it was extremely wet.After two or three hours of immersion, my feet were numb and my fingers chilled where they gripped the ropes of my makeshift life preserver, made of two empty casks.The gunners wife was as good as her word, though.The long, dim shape I had glimpsed from the Porpoise grew steadily nearer, its low hills dark as black velvet against a silver sky.HispaniolaHaiti.I had no way of telling time, and yet two months on shipboard, with its constant bells and watch changes, had given me a rough feeling for the passage of the night hours.I thought it must have been near midnight when I left the Porpoise; now it was likely near 4:00 A. M. , and still over a mile to the shore.Ocean currents are strong, but they take their time.Worn out from work and worry, I twisted the rope awkwardly about one wrist to prevent my slipping out of the harness, laid my forehead on one cask, and drifted off to sleep with the scent of rum strong in my nostrils.The brush of something solid beneath my feet woke me to an opal dawn, the sea and sky both glowing with the colors found inside a shell.With my feet planted in cold sand, I could feel the strength of the current flowing past me, tugging on the casks.I disentangled myself from the rope harness and with considerable relief, let the unwieldy things go bobbing toward the shore.There were deep red indentations on my shoulders.The wrist I had twisted through the wet rope was rubbed raw; I was chilled, exhausted, and very thirsty, and my legs were rubbery as boiled squid.On the other hand, the sea behind me was empty, the Porpoise nowhere in sight.I had escaped.Now, all that remained to be done was to get ashore, find water, find some means of quick transport to Jamaica, and find Jamie and the Artemis, preferably before the Royal Navy did.I thought I could just about manage the first item on the agenda.Such little as I knew of the Caribbean from postcards and tourist brochures had led me to think in terms of white sand beaches and crystal lagoons.In fact, prevailing conditions ran more toward a lot of dense and ugly vegetation, embedded in extremely sticky dark brown mud.The thick bushlike plants must be mangroves.They stretched as far as I could see in either direction; there was no alternative but to clamber through them.Their roots rose out of the mud in big loops like croquet wickets, which I tripped over regularly, and the pale, smooth gray twigs grew in bunches like finger bones, snatching at my hair as I passed.Squads of tiny purple crabs ran off in profound agitation at my approach.My feet sank into the mud to the ankles, and I thought better of putting on my shoes, wet as they were.I rolled them up in my wet skirt, kirtling it up above my knees and took out the fish knife Annekje had given me, just in case.I saw nothing threatening, but felt better with a weapon in my hand.The rising sun on my shoulders at first was welcome, as it thawed my chilled flesh and dried my clothes.Within an hour, though, I wished that it would go behind a cloud.I was sweating heavily as the sun rose higher, caked to the knees with drying mud, and growing thirstier by the moment.I tried to see how far the mangroves extended, but they rose above my head, and tossing waves of narrow, gray green leaves were all I could see.The whole bloody island cant be mangroves, I muttered, slogging on.There has to be solid land someplace.And water, I hoped.A noise like a small cannon going off nearby startled me so that I dropped the fish knife.I groped frantically in the mud for it, then dived forward onto my face as something large whizzed past my head, missing me by inches.There was a loud rattling of leaves, and then a sort of conversational sounding Kwark?What?I croaked.I sat up cautiously, knife in one hand, and wiped the wet, muddy curls out of my face with the other.Six feet away, a large black bird was sitting on a mangrove, regarding me with a critical eye.He bent his head, delicately preening his sleek black feathers, as though to contrast his immaculate appearance with my own dishevelment.Well, la di dah, I said sarcastically.Youve got wings, mate.The bird stopped preening and eyed me censoriously.Then he lifted his beak into the air, puffed his chest, and as though to further establish his sartorial superiority, suddenly inflated a large pouch of brilliant red skin that ran from the base of his neck halfway down his body.Bwoom!he said, repeating the cannon like noise that had startled me before.It startled me again, but not so much.Dont do that, I said irritably.Paying no attention, the bird slowly flapped its wings, settled back on its branch, and boomed again.There was a sudden harsh cry from above, and with a loud flapping of wings, two more large black birds plopped down, landing in a mangrove a few feet away.Encouraged by the audience, the first bird went on booming at regular intervals, the skin of his pouch flaming with excitement.Within moments, three more black shapes had appeared overhead.I was reasonably sure they werent vultures, but I still wasnt inclined to stay.I had miles to go before I sleptor found Jamie.The chances of finding him in time were something I preferred not to dwell on.A half hour later, I had made so little progress that I could still hear the intermittent booming of my fastidious acquaintance, now joined by a number of similarly vocal friends.Panting with exertion, I picked a thickish root and sat down to rest.My lips were cracked and dry, and the thought of water was occupying my mind to the exclusion of virtually everything else, even Jamie.I had been struggling through the mangroves for what seemed like forever, yet I could still hear the sound of the ocean.In fact, the tide must have been following me, for as I sat, a thin sheet of foaming, dirty seawater came purling through the mangrove roots to touch my toes briefly before receding.Water, water everywhere, I said ruefully, watching it, nor any drop to drink.A small movement on the damp mud caught my eye.Bending down, I saw several small fishes, of a sort I had never seen before.So far from flopping about, gasping for breath, these fish were sitting upright, propped on their pectoral fins, looking as though the fact that they were out of water was of no concern at all.Fascinated, I bent closer to inspect them.One or two shifted on their fins, but they seemed not to mind being looked at.They goggled solemnly back at me, eyes bulging.It was only as I looked closer that I realized that the goggling appearance was caused by the fact that each fish appeared to have four eyes, not two.I stared at one for a long minute, feeling the sweat trickle down between my breasts.Either Im hallucinating, I told it conversationally, or you are.The fish didnt answer, but hopped suddenly, landing on a branch several inches above the ground.Perhaps it sensed something, for a moment later, another wave washed through, this one splashing up to my ankles.A sudden welcome coolness fell on me.The sun had obligingly gone behind a cloud, and with its vanishing, the whole feel of the mangrove forest changed.The gray leaves rattled as a sudden wind came up, and all the tiny crabs and fish and sand fleas disappeared as though by magic.They obviously knew something I didnt, and I found their going rather sinister.I glanced up at the cloud where the sun had vanished, and gasped.A huge purple mass of boiling cloud was coming up behind the hills, so fast that I could actually see the leading edge of the mass, blazing white with shielded sunlight, moving forward toward me.The next wave came through, two inches higher than the last, and taking longer to recede.I was neither a fish nor a crab, but by this time I had tumbled to the fact that a storm was on its way, and moving with amazing speed.I glanced around, but saw nothing more than the seemingly infinite stretch of mangroves before me.Nothing that could be used for shelter.Still, being caught out in a rainstorm was hardly the worst that could happen, under the circumstances.My tongue felt dry and sticky, and I licked my lips at the thought of cool, sweet rain falling on my face.The swish of another wave halfway up my shins brought me to a sudden awareness that I was in danger of more than getting wet.A quick glance into the upper branches of the mangroves showed me dried tufts of seaweed tangled in the twigs and crotcheshigh tide leveland well above my head.I felt a moments panic, and tried to calm myself.If I lost my bearings in this place, I was done for.Hold on, Beauchamp, I muttered to myself.I remembered a bit of advice Id learned as an internThe first thing to do in a cardiac arrest is take your own pulse.I smiled at the memory, feeling panic ebb at once.As a gesture, I did take my pulse; a little fast, but strong and steady.All right, then, which way?Toward the mountain; it was the only thing I could see above the sea of mangroves.I pushed my way through the branches as fast as I could, ignoring the ripping of my skirts and the increasing pull of each wave on my legs.The wind was coming from the sea behind me, pushing the waves higher.It blew my hair constantly into my eyes and mouth, and I wiped it back again and again, cursing out loud for the comfort of hearing a voice, but my throat was soon so dry that it hurt to talk.I squelched on.My skirt kept pulling loose from my belt, and somewhere I dropped my shoes, which disappeared at once in the boiling foam that now washed well above my knees.It didnt seem to matter.The tide was midthigh when the rain hit.With a roar that drowned the rattle of the leaves, it fell in drenching sheets that soaked me to the skin in moments.At first I wasted time vainly tilting my head back, trying to direct the rivulets that ran down my face into my open mouth.Then sense reasserted itself; I took off the kerchief tucked around my shoulders, let the rain soak it and wrung it out several times, to remove the vestiges of salt.Then I let it soak in the rain once more, lifted the wadded fabric to my mouth, and sucked the water from it.It tasted of sweat and seaweed and coarse cotton.It was delicious.I had kept going, but was still in the clutches of the mangroves.The incoming tide was nearly waist deep, and the walking getting much harder.Thirst slaked momentarily, I put my head down and pushed forward as fast as I could.Lightning flashed over the mountains, and a moment later came the growl of thunder.The wash of the tide was so strong now that I could move forward only as each wave came in, half running as the water shoved me along, then clinging to the nearest mangrove stem as the wash sucked back, dragging my trailing legs.I was beginning to think that I had been over hasty in abandoning Captain Leonard and the Porpoise.The wind was rising still further, dashing rain into my face so that I could barely see.Sailors say every seventh wave is higher.I found myself counting, as I slogged forward.It was the ninth wave, in fact, that struck me between the shoulder blades and knocked me flat before I could grasp a branch.I floundered, helpless and choking in a blur of sand and water, then found my feet and stood upright again.The wave had half drowned me, but had also altered my direction.I was no longer facing the mountain.I was, however, facing a large tree, no more than twenty feet away.Four more waves, four more surging rushes forward, four more grim clutchings as the tide race sought to pull me back, and I was on the muddy bank of a small inlet, where a tiny stream ran through the mangroves and out to sea.I crawled up it, slipping and staggering as I clambered into the welcoming embrace of the tree.From a perch twelve feet up, I could see the stretch of the mangrove swamp behind me, and beyond that, the open sea.I changed my mind once more about the wisdom of my leaving the Porpoise; no matter how awful things were on land, they were a good deal worse out there.Lightning shattered over a surface of boiling water, as wind and tide race fought for control of the waves.Farther out, in the Mouchoir Passage, the swell was so high, it looked like rolling hills.The wind was high enough now to make a thin, whistling scream as it passed by, chilling me to the skin in my wet clothes.Thunder cracked together with the lightning flashes now, as the storm moved over me.The Artemis was slower than the man of war; slow enough, I hoped, to be still safe, far out in the Atlantic.I saw one clump of mangroves struck, a hundred feet away; the water hissed back, boiled away, and the dry land showed for a moment, before the waves rolled back, drowning the black wire of the blasted stems.I wrapped my arms about the trunk of the tree, pressed my face against the bark, and prayed.For Jamie, and the Artemis.For the Porpoise, Annekje Johansen and Tom Leonard and the Governor.And for me.It was full daylight when I woke, my leg wedged between two branches, and numb from the knee down.I half climbed, half fell from my perch, landing in the shallow water of the inlet.I scooped up a handful of the water, tasted it, and spat it out.Not salt, but too brackish to drink.My clothes were damp, but I was parched.The storm was long gone; everything around me was peaceful and normal, with the exception of the blackened mangroves.In the distance, I could hear the booming of the big black birds.Brackish water here promised fresher water farther up the inlet.I rubbed my leg, trying to work out the pins and needles, then limped up the bank.The vegetation began to change from the gray green mangroves to a lusher green, with a thick undergrowth of grass and mossy plants that obliged me to walk in the water.Tired and thirsty as I was, I could go only a short distance before having to sit down and rest.As I did so, several of the odd little fish hopped up onto the bank beside me, goggling as though in curiosity.Well, I think you look rather peculiar, too, I told one.Are you English?said the fish incredulously.The impression of Alice in Wonderland was so pronounced that I merely blinked stupidly at it for a moment.Then my head snapped up, and I stared into the face of the man who had spoken.His face was weathered and sunburned to the color of mahogany, but the black hair that curled back from his brow was thick and ungrizzled.He stepped out from behind the mangrove, moving cautiously, as though afraid to startle me.He was a bit above middle height and burly, thick through the shoulder, with a broad, boldly carved face, whose naturally friendly expression was tinged with wariness.He was dressed shabbily, with a heavy canvas bag slung across his shoulderand a canteen made of goatskin hung from his belt.Vous tes Anglaise?he asked, repeating his original question in French.Comment a va?Yes, Im English, I said, croaking.May I have some water, please?His eyes popped wide openthey were a light hazelbut he didnt say anything, just took the skin bag from his belt and handed it to me.I laid the fish knife on my knee, close within reach, and drank deeply, scarcely able to gulp fast enough.Careful, he said.Its dangerous to drink too fast.I know, I said, slightly breathless as I lowered the bag.Im a doctor.I lifted the canteen and drank again, but forced myself to swallow more slowly this time.My rescuer was regarding me quizzicallyand little wonder, I supposed.Sea soaked and sun dried, mud caked and sweat stained, with my hair straggling down over my face, I looked like a beggar, and probably a demented one at that.A doctor?he said in English, showing that his thoughts had been traveling in the direction I suspected.He eyed me closely, in a way strongly reminiscent of the big black bird I had met earlier.A doctor of what, if I might ask?Medicine, I said, pausing briefly between gulps.He had strongly drawn black brows.These rose nearly to his hairline.Indeed, he said, after a noticeable pause.Indeed, I said in the same tone of voice, and he laughed.He inclined his head toward me in a formal bow.In that case, Madame Physician, allow me to introduce myself.Lawrence Stern, Doctor of Natural Philosophy, of the Gesellschaft von Naturwissenschaft Philosophieren, Munich.I blinked at him.A naturalist, he elaborated, gesturing at the canvas bag over his shoulder.I was making my way toward those frigate birds in hopes of observing their breeding display, when I happened to overhear you, er  Talking to a fish, I finished.Yes, wellhave they really got four eyes?I asked, in hopes of changing the subject.Yesor so it seems.He glanced down at the fish, who appeared to be following the conversation with rapt attention.They seem to employ their oddly shaped optics when submerged, so that the upper pair of eyes observes events above the surface of the water, and the lower pair similarly takes note of happenings below it.He looked then at me, with a hint of a smile.Might I perhaps have the honor of knowing your name, Madame Physician?I hesitated, unsure what to tell him.I pondered the assortment of available aliases and decided on the truth.Fraser, I said.Claire Fraser.Mrs.James Fraser, I added for good measure, feeling vaguely that marital status might make me seem slightly more respectable, appearances notwithstanding.I fingered back the curl hanging in my left eye.Your servant, Madame, he said with a gracious bow.He rubbed the bridge of his nose thoughtfully, looking at me.You have been shipwrecked, perhaps?he ventured.It seemed the most logicalif not the onlyexplanation of my presence, and I nodded.I need to find a way to get to Jamaica, I said.Do you think you can help me?He stared at me, frowning slightly, as though I were a specimen he couldnt quite decide how to classify, but then he nodded.He had a broad mouth that looked made for smiling; one corner turned up, and he extended a hand to help me up.Yes, he said.I can help.But I think maybe first we find you some food, and maybe clothes, eh?I have a friend, who lives not so far away.I will take you there, shall I?What with parching thirst and the general press of events, I had paid little attention to the demands of my stomach.At the mention of food, however, II it came immediately and vociferously to life.That, I said loudly, in hopes of drowning it out, would be very nice indeed.I brushed back the tangle of my hair as well as I could, and ducking under a branch, followed my rescuer into the trees.As we emerged from a palmetto grove, the ground opened out into a meadow like space, then rose up in a broad hill before us.At the top of the hill, I could see a houseor at least a ruin.Its yellow plaster walls were cracked and overrun by pink bougainvillaeas and straggling guavas, the tin roof sported several visible holes, and the whole place gave off an air of mournful dilapidation.Hacienda de la Fuente, my new acquaintance said, with a nod toward it.Can you stand the walk up the hill, or He hesitated, eyeing me as though estimating my weight.I could carry you, I suppose, he said, with a not altogether flattering tone of doubt in his voice.I can manage, I assured him.My feet were bruised and sore, and punctured by fallen palmetto fronds, but the path before us looked relatively smooth.The hillside leading up to the house was crisscrossed with the faint lines of sheep trails.There were a number of these animals present, peacefully grazing under the hot Hispaniola sun.As we stepped out of the trees, one sheep spotted us and uttered a short bleat of surprise.Like clockwork, every sheep on the hillside lifted its head in unison and stared at us.Feeling rather self conscious under this unblinking phalanx of suspicious eyes, I picked up my muddy skirts and followed Dr.Stern toward the main pathtrodden by more than sheep, to judge from its widththat led up and over the hill.It was a fine, bright day, and flocks of orange and white butterflies flickered through the grass.They lighted on the scattered blooms with here and there a brilliant yellow butterfly shining like a tiny sun.I breathed in deeply, a lovely smell of grass and flowers, with minor notes of sheep and sun warmed dust.A brown speck lighted for a moment on my sleeve and clung, long enough for me to see the velvet scales on its wing, and the tiny curled hose of its proboscis.The slender abdomen pulsed, breathing to its wing beats, and then it was gone.It might have been the promise of help, the water, the butterflies, or all three, but the burden of fear and fatigue under which I had labored for so long began to lift.True, I still had to face the problem of finding transport to Jamaica, but with thirst assuaged, a friend at hand, and the possibility of lunch just ahead, that no longer appeared the impossible task it had seemed in the mangroves.There he is!Lawrence stopped, waiting for me to come up alongside him on the path.He gestured upward, toward a slight, wiry figure, picking its way carefully down the hillside toward us.I squinted at the figure as it wandered through the sheep, who took no apparent notice of his passage.Jesus!I said.Its St.Francis of Assisi.Lawrence glanced at me in surprise.No, neither one.I told you hes English.He raised an arm and shouted, Hola!Seor Fogden!The gray robed figure paused suspiciously, one hand twined protectively in the wool of a passing ewe.Quien es?Stern!called Lawrence.Lawrence Stern!Come along, he said, and extended a hand to pull me up the steep hillside onto the sheep path above.The ewe was making determined efforts to escape her protector, which distracted him from our approach.A slender man a bit taller than I, he had a lean face that might have been handsome if not disfigured by a reddish beard that straggled dust mop like round the edges of his chin.His long and straying hair had gone to gray in streaks and runnels, and fell forward into his eyes with some frequency.An orange butterfly took wing from his head as we reached him.Stern?he said, brushing back the hair with his free hand and blinking owlishly in the sunlight.I dont know anyoh, its you!His thin face brightened.Why didnt you say it was the shitworm man; I should have known you at once!Stern looked mildly embarrassed at this, and glanced at me apologetically.Iahcollected several interesting parasites from the excrement of Mr.Fogdens sheep, upon the occasion of my last visit, he explained.Horrible great worms!Father Fogden said, shuddering violently in recollection.A foot long, some of them, at least!No more than eight inches, Stern corrected, smiling.He glanced at the nearest sheep, his hand resting on his collecting bag as though in anticipation of further imminent contributions to science.Was the remedy I suggested effective?Father Fogden looked vaguely doubtful, as though trying to remember quite what the remedy had been.The turpentine drench, the naturalist prompted.Oh, yes!The sun broke out on the priests lean countenance, and he beamed fondly upon us.Of course, of course!Yes, it worked splendidly.A few of them died, but the rest were quite cured.Capital, entirely capital!Suddenly it seemed to dawn on Father Fogden that he was being less than hospitable.But you must come in!he said.I was just about to partake of the midday meal; I insist you must join me.The priest turned to me.This will be Mrs.Stern, will it?Mention of eight inch intestinal worms had momentarily suppressed my hunger pangs, but at the mention of food, they came gurgling back in full force.No, but we should be delighted to partake of your hospitality, Stern answered politely.Pray allow me to introduce my companiona Mrs.Fraser, a countrywoman of yours.Fogdens eyes grew quite round at this.A pale blue, with a tendency to water in bright sun, they fixed wonderingly upon me.An Englishwoman?he said, disbelieving.Here?The round eyes took in the mud and salt stains on my crumpled dress, and my general air of disarray.He blinked for a moment, then stepped forward, and with the utmost dignity, bowed low over my hand.Your most obedient servant, Madame, he said.He rose and gestured grandly at the ruin on the hill.Mi casa es su casa.He whistled sharply, and a small King Charles cavalier spaniel poked its face inquiringly out of the weeds.We have a guest, Ludo, the priest said, beaming.Isnt that nice?Tucking my hand firmly under one elbow, he took the sheep by its topknot of wool and towed us both toward the Hacienda de la Fuente, leaving Stern to follow.The reason for the name became clear as we entered the dilapidated courtyard; a tiny cloud of dragonflies hovered like blinking lights over an algae filled pool in one corner; it looked like a natural spring that someone had curbed in when the house was built.At least a dozen jungle fowl sprang up from the shattered pavement and flapped madly past our feet, leaving a small cloud of dust and feathers behind them.From other evidences left behind, I deduced that the trees overhanging the patio were their customary roost, and had been for some time.And so I was fortunate enough to encounter Mrs.Fraser among the mangroves this morning, Stern concluded.I thought that perhaps you mightoh, look at that beauty!A magnificent Odonata!A tone of amazed delight accompanied this last statement, and he pushed unceremoniously past us to peer up into the shadows of the palm thatched patio roof, where an enormous dragonfly, at least four inches across, was darting to and fro, blue body catching fire when it crossed one of the errant rays of sunshine poking through the tattered roof.Oh, do you want it?Be my guest.Our host waved a gracious hand at the dragonfly.Here, Becky, trot in there and Ill see to your hoof in a bit.He shooed the ewe into the patio with a slap on the rump.It snorted and galloped off a few feet, then fell at once to browsing on the scattered fruit of a huge guava that overhung the ancient wall.In fact, the trees around the patio had grown up to such an extent that the branches at many points interlaced.The whole of the courtyard seemed roofed with them, a sort of leafy tunnel, leading down the length of the patio into the gaping cavern of the houses entrance.Drifts of dust and the pink paper leaves of bougainvillaea lay heaped against the sill, but just beyond, the dark wood floor gleamed with polish, bare and immaculate.It was dark inside, after the brilliance of the sunlight, but my eyes quickly adapted to the surroundings, and I looked around curiously.It was a very plain room, dark and cool, furnished with no more than a long table, a few stools and chairs, and a small sideboard, over which hung a hideous painting in the Spanish stylean emaciated Christ, goateed and pallid in the gloom, indicating with one skeletal hand the bleeding heart that throbbed in his chest.This ghastly object so struck my eye that it was a moment before I realized there was someone else in the room.The shadows in one corner of the room coalesced, and a small round face emerged, wearing an expression of remarkable malignity.I blinked and took a step back.The womanfor so she wastook a step forward, black eyes fixed on me, unblinking as the sheep.She was no more than four feet tall, and so thick through the body as to seem like a solid block, without joint or indentation.Her head was a small round knob atop her body, with the smaller knob of a sparse gray bun scraped tightly back behind it.She was a light mahogany colorwhether from the sun or naturally, I couldnt telland looked like nothing so much as a carved wooden doll.An ill wish doll.Mamacita, said the priest, speaking Spanish to the graven image, what good fortune!We have guests who will eat with us.You remember Seor Stern?he added, gesturing at Lawrence.S, claro, said the image, through invisible wooden lips.The Christ killer.And who is the puta alba?And this is Seora Fraser, Father Fogden went on, beaming as though she had not spoken.The poor lady has had the misfortune to be shipwrecked; we must assist her as much as we can.Mamacita looked me over slowly from top to toe.She said nothing, but the wide nostrils flared with infinite contempt.Your foods ready, she said, and turned away.Splendid!the priest said happily.Mamacita welcomes you; shell bring us some food.Wont you sit down?The table was already laid with a large cracked plate and a wooden spoon.The priest took two more plates and spoons from the sideboard, and distributed them haphazardly about the table, gesturing hospitably at us to be seated.A large brown coconut sat on the chair at the head of the table.Fogden tenderly picked this up and set it alongside his plate.The fibrous husk was darkened with age, and the hair was worn off it in patches, showing an almost polished appearance; I thought he must have had it for some time.Hallo there, he said, patting it affectionately.And how are you keeping this fine day, Coco?I glanced at Stern, but he was studying the portrait of Christ, a small frown between his thick black brows.I supposed it was up to me to open a conversation.You live alone here, Mr.ah, Father Fogden?I inquired of our host.You, ander, Mamacita?Yes, Im afraid so.Thats why Im so pleased to see you.I havent any real company but Ludo and Coco, you know, he explained, patting the hairy nut once more.Coco?I said politely, thinking that on the evidence to hand so far, Coco wasnt the only nut among those present.I darted another glance at Stern, who looked mildly amused, but not alarmed.Spanish for bugbearcoco, the priest explained.A hobgoblin.See him there, wee button nose and his dark little eyes?Fogden jabbed two long, slender fingers suddenly into the depressions in the end of the coconut and jerked them back, chortling.Ah ah!he cried.Mustnt stare, Coco, its rude, you know!The pale blue eyes darted a piercing glance at me, and with some difficulty, I removed my teeth from my lower lip.Such a pretty lady, he said, as though to himself.Not like my Ermenegilda, but very pretty nonethelessisnt she, Ludo?The dog, thus addressed, ignored me, but bounded joyfully at its master, shoving its head under his hand and barking.He scratched its ears affectionately, then turned his attention back to me.Would one of Ermenegildas dresses fit you, I wonder?I didnt know whether to answer this or not.Instead, I merely smiled politely, and hoped what I was thinking didnt show on my face.Fortunately, at this point Mamacita came back, carrying a steaming clay pot wrapped in towels.She slapped a ladleful of the contents on each plate, then went out, her feetif she had anymoving invisibly beneath the shapeless skirt.I stirred the mess on my plate, which appeared to be vegetable in nature.I took a cautious bite, and found it surprisingly good.Fried plantain, mixed with manioc and red beans, Lawrence explained, seeing my hesitation.He took a large spoonful of the steaming pulp himself and ate it without pausing for it to cool.I had expected something of an inquisition about my presence, identity, and prospects.Instead, Father Fogden was singing softly under his breath, keeping time on the table with his spoon between bites.I darted a glance at Lawrence, eyebrows up.He merely smiled, raised one shoulder in a slight shrug, and bent to his own food.No real conversation occurred until the conclusion of the meal, when Mamacitaunsmiling seemed an understatement of her expressionremoved the plates, replacing them with a platter of fruit, three cups, and a gigantic clay pitcher.Have you ever drunk sangria, Mrs.Fraser?I opened my mouth to say Yes, thought better of it, and said, No, what is it?Sangria had been a popular drink in the 1960s, and I had had it many times at faculty parties and hospital social events.But for now, I was sure that it was unknown in England and Scotland; Mrs.Fraser of Edinburgh would never have heard of sangria.A mixture of red wine and the juices of orange and lemon, Lawrence Stern was explaining.Mulled with spices, and served hot or cold, depending upon the weather.A most comforting and healthful beverage, is it not, Fogden?Oh, yes.Oh, yes.Most comforting.Not waiting for me to find out for myself, the priest drained his cup, and reached for the pitcher before I had taken the first sip.It was the same; the same sweet, throat rasping taste, and I suffered the momentary illusion that I was back at the party where I had first tasted it, in company with a marijuana smoking graduate student and a professor of botany.This illusion was fostered by Sterns conversation, which dealt with his collections, and by Father Fogdens behavior.After several cups of sangria, he had risen, rummaged through the sideboard, and emerged with a large clay pipe.This he packed full of a strong smelling herb shaken out of a paper twist, and proceeded to smoke.Hemp?Stern asked, seeing this.Tell me, do you find it settling to the digestive processes?I have heard it is so, but the herb is unobtainable in most European cities, and I have no firsthand observations of its effect.Oh, it is most genial and comforting to the stomach, Father Fogden assured him.He drew in a huge breath, held it, then exhaled long and dreamily, blowing a stream of soft white smoke that floated in streamers of haze near the rooms low ceiling.I shall send a packet home with you, dear fellow.Do say, now, what do you mean doing, you and this shipwrecked lady you have rescued?Stern explained his plan; after a nights rest, we intended to walk as far as the village of St.Luis du Nord, and from there see whether a fishing boat might carry us to Cap Hatien, thirty miles distant.If not, we would have to make our way overland to Le Cap, the nearest port of any size.The priests sketchy brows drew close together, frowning against the smoke.Mm?Well, I suppose there isnt much choice, is there?Still, you must go careful, particularly if you go overland to Le Cap.Maroons, you know.Maroons?I glanced quizzically at Stern, who nodded, frowning.Thats true.I did meet with two or three small bands as I came north through the valley of the Artibonite.They didnt molest me, thoughI daresay I looked little better off than they, poor wretches.The Maroons are escaped slaves, he explained to me.Having fled the cruelty of their masters, they take refuge in the remote hills, where the jungle hides them.They might not trouble you, Father Fogden said.He sucked deeply on his pipe, with a low, slurping noise, held his breath for a long count and then let it out reluctantly.His eyes were becoming markedly bloodshot.He closed one of them and examined me rather blearily with the other.She doesnt look worth robbing, really.Stern smiled broadly, looking at me, then quickly erased the smile, as though feeling he had been less than tactful.He coughed and took another cup of sangria.The priests eyes gleamed over the pipe, red as a ferrets.I believe I need a little fresh air, I said, pushing back my chair.And perhaps a little water, to wash with?Oh, of course, of course!Father Fogden cried.He rose, swaying unsteadily, and thumped the coals from his pipe carelessly out onto the sideboard.Come with me.The air in the patio seemed fresh and invigorating by comparison, despite its mugginess.I inhaled deeply, looking on with interest as Father Fogden fumbled with a bucket by the fountain in the corner.Where does the water come from?I asked.Is it a spring?The stone trough was lined with soft tendrils of green algae, and I could see these moving lazily; evidently there was a current of some kind.It was Stern who answered.Yes, there are hundreds of such springs.Some of them are said to have spirits living in thembut I do not suppose you subscribe to such superstition, sir?Father Fogden seemed to have to think about this.He set the half filled bucket down on the coping and squinted into the water, trying to fix his gaze on one of the small silver fish that swam there.Ah?he said vaguely.Well, no.Spirits, no.Stilloh, yes, I had forgotten.I had something to show you.Going to a cupboard set into the wall, he pulled open the cracked wooden door and removed a small bundle of coarse unbleached muslin, which he put gingerly into Sterns hands.It came up in the spring one day last month, he said.It died when the noon sun struck it, and I took it out.Im afraid the other fish nibbled it a bit, he said apologetically, but you can still see.Lying in the center of the cloth was a small dried fish, much like those darting about in the spring, save that this one was pure white.It was also blind.On either side of the blunt head, there was a small swelling where an eye should have been, but that was all.Do you think it is a ghost fish?the priest inquired.I thought of it when you mentioned spirits.Still, I cant think what sort of sin a fish might have committed, so as to be doomed to roam about like thateyeless, I mean.I meanhe closed one eye again in his favorite expressionone doesnt think of fish as having souls, and yet, if they dont, how can they become ghosts?I shouldnt think they do, myself, I assured him.I peered more closely at the fish, which Stern was examining with the rapt joy of the born naturalist.The skin was very thin, and so transparent that the shadows of the internal organs and the knobbly line of the vertebrae were clearly visible, yet it did have scales, tiny and translucent, though dulled by dryness.It is a blind cave fish, Stern said, reverently stroking the tiny blunt head.I have seen one only once before, in a pool deep inside a cave, at a place called Abandawe.And that one escaped before I could examine it closely.My dear fellow He turned to the priest, eyes shining with excitement.Might I have it?Of course, of course.The priest fluttered his fingers in offhand generosity.No use to me.Too small to eat, you know, even if Mamacita would think of cooking it, which she wouldnt.He glanced around the patio, kicking absently at a passing hen.Where is Mamacita?Here, cabrn, where else?I hadnt seen her come out of the house, but there she was, a dusty, sunbrowned little figure stooping to fill another bucket from the spring.A faintly musty, unpleasant smell reached my nostrils, and they twitched uneasily.The priest must have noticed, for he said, Oh, you mustnt mind, its only poor Arabella.Arabella?Yes, in here.The priest held aside a ragged curtain of burlap that screened off a corner of the patio, and I glanced behind it.A ledge jutted out of the stone wall at waist height.On it were ranged a long row of sheeps skulls, pure white and polished.I cant bear to part with them, you see.Father Fogden gently stroked the heavy curve of a skull.This was Beatrizso sweet and gentle.She died in lambing, poor thing.He indicated two much smaller skulls nearby, shaped and polished like the rest.Arabella is aa sheep, too?I asked.The smell was much stronger here, and I thought I really didnt want to know where it was coming from at all.A member of my flock, yes, certainly.The priest turned his oddly bright blue eyes on me, looking quite fierce.She was murdered!Poor Arabella, such a gentle, trusting soul.How they can have had the wickedness to betray such innocence for the sake of carnal lusts!Oh, dear, I said, rather inadequately.Im terribly sorry to hear that.Ahwho murdered her?The sailors, the wicked heathen!Killed her on the beach and roasted her poor body over a gridiron, just like St.Lawrence the Martyr.Heavens, I said.The priest sighed, and his spindly beard appeared to droop with mourning.Yes, I must not forget the hope of Heaven.For if Our Lord observes the fall of every sparrow, He can scarcely have failed to observe Arabella.She must have weighed near on ninety pounds, at least, such a good grazer as she was, poor child.Ah, I said, trying to infuse the remark with a suitable sympathy and horror.It then occurred to me what the priest had said.Sailors?I asked.When did you say thisthis sad occurrence took place?It couldnt be the Porpoise, I thought.Surely, Captain Leonard would not have thought me so important that he had risked bringing his ship in so close to the island, in order to pursue me?But my hands grew damp at the thought, and I wiped them unobtrusively on my robe.This morning, Father Fogden replied, setting back the lambs skull he had picked up to fondle.But, he added, his manner brightening a bit, I must say theyre making wonderful progress with her.It usually takes more than a week, and already you can quite see  He opened the cupboard again, revealing a large lump, covered with several layers of damp burlap.The smell was markedly stronger now, and a number of small brown beetles scuttled away from the light.Are those members of the Dermestidae you have there, Fogden?Lawrence Stern, having tenderly committed the corpse of his cave fish to a jar of alcoholic spirits, had come to join us.He peered over my shoulder, sunburned features creased in interest.Inside the cupboard, the white maggot larvae of dermestid beetles were hard at work, polishing the skull of Arabella the sheep.They had made a good start on the eyes.The manioc shifted heavily in my stomach.Is that what they are?I suppose so; dear voracious little fellows.The priest swayed alarmingly, catching himself on the edge of the cupboard.As he did so, he finally noticed the old woman, standing glaring at him, a bucket in either hand.Oh, I had quite forgotten!You will be needing a change of clothing, will you not, Mrs.Fraser?I looked down at myself.The dress and shift I was wearing were ripped in so many places that they were barely decent, and so soaked and sodden with water and swamp mud that I was scarcely tolerable, even in such undemanding company as that of Father Fogden and Lawrence Stern.Father Fogden turned to the graven image.Have we not something this unfortunate lady might wear, Mamacita?he asked in Spanish.He seemed to hesitate, swaying gently.Perhaps, one of the dresses in  The woman bared her teeth at me.They are much too small for such a cow, she said, also in Spanish.Give her your old robe, if you must.She cast an eye of scorn on my tangled hair and mud streaked face.Come, she said in English, turning her back on me.You wash.She led me to a smaller patio at the back of the house, where she provided me with two buckets of cold, fresh water, a worn linen towel, and a small pot of soft soap, smelling strongly of lye.Adding a shabby gray robe with a rope belt, she bared her teeth at me again and left, remarking genially in Spanish, Wash away the blood on your hands, Christ killing whore.I shut the patio gate after her with a considerable feeling of relief, stripped off my sticky, filthy clothes with even more relief, and made my toilet as well as might be managed with cold water and no comb.Clad decently, if oddly, in Father Fogdens extra robe, I combed out my wet hair with my fingers, contemplating my peculiar host.I wasnt sure whether the priests excursions into oddness were some form of dementia, or only the side effects of long term alcoholism and cannabis intoxication, but he seemed a gentle, kindly soul, in spite of it.His servantif thats what she waswas another question altogether.Mamacita made me more than slightly nervous.Mr.Stern had announced his intention of going down to the seaside to bathe, and I was reluctant to go back into the house until he returned.There had been quite a lot of sangria left, and I suspected that Father Fogdenif he was still consciouswould be little protection by this time against that basilisk glare.Still, I couldnt stay outside all afternoon; I was very tired, and wanted to sit down at least, though I would have preferred to find a bed and sleep for a week.There was a door opening into the house from my small patio; I pushed it open and stepped into the dark interior.I was in a small bedroom.I looked around, amazed; it didnt seem part of the same house as the Spartan main room and the shabby patios.The bed was made up with feather pillows and a coverlet of soft red wool.Four huge patterned fans were spread like bright wings across the whitewashed walls, and wax candles in a branched brass candelabrum sat on the table.The furniture was simply but carefully made, and polished with oil to a soft, deep gloss.A curtain of striped cotton hung across the end of the room.It was pushed partway back, and I could see a row of dresses hung on hooks behind it, in a rainbow of silken color.These must be Ermenegildas dresses, the ones that Father Fogden had mentioned.I walked forward to look at them, my bare feet quiet on the floor.The room was dustless and clean, but very quiet, without the scent or vibration of human occupancy.No one lived in this room anymore.The dresses were beautiful; all of silk and velvet, moir and satin, mousse line and panne.Even hanging lifeless here from their hooks, they had the sheen and beauty of an animals pelt, where some essence of life lingers in the fur.I touched one bodice, purple velvet, heavy with embroidered silver pansies, centered with pearls.She had been small, this Ermenegilda, and slightly builtseveral of the dresses had ruffles and pads cleverly sewn inside the bodices, to add to the illusion of a bust.The room was comfortable, though not luxurious; the dresses were splendidthings that might have been worn at Court in Madrid.Ermenegilda was gone, but the room still seemed inhabited.I touched a sleeve of peacock blue in farewell and tiptoed away, leaving the dresses to their dreams.I found Lawrence Stern on the veranda at the back of the house, overlooking a precipitous slope of aloe and guava.In the distance, a small humped island sat cradled in a sea of glimmering turquoise.He rose in courtesy, giving me a small bow and a look of surprise.Mrs.Fraser!You are in greatly improved looks, I must say.The Fathers robe suits you somewhat more than it does him.He smiled at me, hazel eyes creasing in a flattering expression of admiration.I expect the absence of dirt has more to do with it, I said, sitting down in the chair he offered me.Is that something to drink?There was a pitcher on the rickety wooden table between the chairs; moisture had condensed in a heavy dew on the sides and droplets ran enticingly down the sides.I had been thirsty so long that the sight of anything liquid automatically made my cheeks draw in with longing.More sangria, Stern said.He poured out a small cupful for each of us, and sipped his own, sighing with enjoyment.I hope you will not think me intemperate, Mrs.Fraser, but after months of tramping country, drinking nothing but water and the slaves crude rum He closed his eyes in bliss.Ambrosia.I was rather disposed to agree.Eris Father Fogden?I hesitated, looking for some tactful way of inquiring after our hosts state.I neednt have bothered.Drunk, Stern said frankly.Limp as a worm, laid out on the table in the sala.He nearly always is, by the time the suns gone down, he added.I see.I settled back in the chair, sipping my own sangria.Have you known Father Fogden long?Stern rubbed a hand over his forehead, thinking.Oh, for a few years.He glanced at me.I was wonderingdo you by chance know a James Fraser, from Edinburgh?I realize it is a common name, butoh, you do?I hadnt spoken, but my face had given me away, as it always did, unless I was carefully prepared to lie.My husbands name is James Fraser, I said.Sterns face lighted with interest.Indeed!he exclaimed.And is he a very large fellow, with  Red hair, I agreed.Yes, thats Jamie.Something occurred to me.He told me hed met a natural philosopher in Edinburgh, and had a most interesting conversation aboutvarious things.What I was wondering was where Stern had learned Jamies real name.Most people in Edinburgh would have known him only as Jamie Roy, the smuggler, or as Alexander Malcolm, the respectable printer of Carfax Close.Surely Dr.Stern, with his distinct German accent, couldnt be the Englishman Tompkins had spoken of?Spiders, Stern said promptly.Yes, I recall perfectly.Spiders and caves.We met in aa His face went blank for a moment.Then he coughed, masterfully covering the lapse.In a, um, drinking establishment.One of theah female employees happened to encounter a large specimen of Arachmida hanging from the ceiling in herthat is, from the ceiling as she was engaged inah, conversation with me.Being somewhat frightened in consequence, she burst into the passageway, shrieking incoherently.Stern took a large gulp of sangria as a restorative, evidently finding the memory stressful.I had just succeeded in capturing the animal and securing it in a specimen jar when Mr.Fraser burst into the room, pointed a species of firearm at me, and said Here Stern developed a prolonged coughing fit, pounding himself vigorously on the chest.Eheu!Do you not find this particular pitcher perhaps a trifle strong, Mrs.Fraser?I suspect that the old woman has added too many sliced lemons.I suspected that Mamacita would have added cyanide, had she any to hand, but in fact the sangria was excellent.I hadnt noticed, I said, sipping.But do go on.Jamie came in with a pistol and said?Oh.Well, in fact, I cannot say I recall precisely what was said.There appeared to have been a slight misapprehension, owing to his impression that the ladys outcry was occasioned by some inopportune motion or speech of my own, rather than by the arachnid.Fortunately, I was able to display the beast to him, whereupon the lady was induced to come so far as the doorwe could not persuade her to enter the room againand identify it as the cause of her distress.I see, I said.I could envision the scene very well indeed, save for one point of paramount interest.Do you happen to recall what he was wearing?Jamie?Lawrence Stern looked blank.Wearing?Whyno.My impression is that he was clad for the street, rather than in dishabille, but  Thats quite all right, I assured him.I only wondered.Clad, after all, was the operative word.So he introduced himself to you?Stern frowned, running a hand through his thick black curls.I dont believe he did.As I recall, the lady referred to him as Mr.Fraser; sometime later in the conversationwe availed ourselves of suitable refreshment and remained conversing nearly until the dawn, finding considerable interest in each others company, you see.At some point, he invited me to address him by his given name.He raised one eyebrow sardonically.I trust you do not think it overfamiliar of me to have done so, upon such brief acquaintance?No, no.Of course not.Wanting to change the subject, I continued, You said you talked about spiders and caves?Why caves?
