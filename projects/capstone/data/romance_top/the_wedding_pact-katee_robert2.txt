Sure.She felt his worried gaze on her all the way out of the library and into the hallway.It was only when she shut the door behind her that she breathed a temporary sigh of relief.Now, to deal with her father.She found him in the formal living room, looking bored as her mother pored over some kind of photo album something to do with the upcoming wedding, no doubt.It would be held in just under two weeks, so most of the details had already been taken care of.It stood to reason, though, that little last minute things were bound to pop up.She stood in the doorway, waiting for them to acknowledge her.Her father looked up first, almost comically pleased for the distraction.Carrigan.It was far too tempting to make small talk about anything other than the real reason she was here.That was the cowards way out, though.Im going to meet the men you have on this list.Her mother finally looked up, green eyes narrowing.What list?I havent seen any list, Seamus.Its none of your concern.He spared one of his rare smiles for Carrigan.Im glad youve decided to be reasonable.Anything for the family, Father.Besides, if the man she married turned out to be a monster, she could always take a page from Callies book and shoot the bastard dead.*** Sloan floated through the hallways of her childhood, feeling more like a ghost than a woman.The feeling had been there in their giant home in Connecticut, and shed wandered the house at all hours of the night, driven from her bed by the treacherous thoughts of what could have been.If shed made different choices the night Carrigan was taken.If her brothers hadnt drank themselves stupid and walked home.If her father hadnt been so willing to risk all of them in a grab for power.She didnt like the answers she came up with.They didnt really matter.The past was dead and gone, just like Devlin.She pressed a hand to her chest, stopping at the top of the stairs, feeling like shed just run ten miles.Devlin.One of her brothers was dead, and everyone was going on as if nothing had changed as if their world hadnt turned to dust around them.It wasnt fair, and she knew it.Life went on, whether they wanted it to or not.She took a deep breath and kept walking, her bare feet padding over the cool wood floors.She wasnt a child.She knew life had to go on.It couldnt come to a full stop just because her heart was so broken she didnt think itd ever recover.Devlin had been only twenty, three years younger than her, and growing up theyd always been close.Of all her brothers, he hadnt expected her to change.Hed been perfectly content to share the comfortable silences she was so fond of, broken only to bring up something interesting that one of them was currently reading.And hed managed to accept the weight of the burden their family placed on them, while still striving for more.And now his dreams were ashes in the wind, whisking hers away with them.Their father liked to say that great privilege brought great responsibility with it.He was a liar.He hadnt been the one forced to make compromise after compromise.He was completely content to move his children around like pieces of furniture, aligning them to his satisfaction to keep the OMalley clan strong.What did their individual happiness matter in the grand scale of the familys safety?Not even a tiny bit.Her stomach lurched, leaving her lightheaded, and Sloan paused to lean against the wall.She might have gotten away with her midnight wanderings in the old redone farmhouse, but there were too many people here.It was only a matter of time before one of her well meaning siblings guided her back to her bedroom.Or the guards reported her to her father.Imagining how pleasant that conversation would be had her picking up her pace.She passed Keiras door, hearing strains of some hard rock song on the other side of the door.It was selfish to think Sloan was the only one suffering.Her youngest sister had taken Devlins death just as hard if not harder.Shed started drinking.A lot.Sloan knew that Carrigan chalked it up to her age, but she wasnt so sure.Keira drank like she was trying to escape the thoughts in her head.That kind of thing didnt simply disappear over time.It got worse.She touched the door, hesitating.Should she say something?Try to get Keira to talk to her?Sloan had always been good at listening, but broaching this subject was going to reopen wounds that hadnt even had a chance to close, much less heal.So she kept walking.Carrigans door opened as she approached, and her older sister stepped into the hall, wearing a sheath dress that left little to the imagination.She froze when she saw Sloan.Youre up late.I couldnt sleep.For a second she thought hoped Carrigan would let it go.She obviously had plans to sneak out, and her skin nearly twitched with impatience.But then she stepped back into her room.Lets talk.More talking.Sloan let loose a silent sigh and obeyed.The sooner they got this over with, the sooner she could retreat into her room and lose herself in a book.It was the only escape that worked these days, the only thing that took away the harsh edge of reality.Carrigan perched on the edge of her bed and gave her a long look.Fathers decided that hes tired of waiting for me.Shed known this was coming.They all had.Her sisters ability to hold him off for this long was something to be commended, but it couldnt last forever.How long?It felt curiously like she was asking how long Carrigan had left to live.My birthday.Her breath stalled in her chest.But Sloan looked down at her hands, fighting to get the words past the concrete block in her throat.Marriage.It was on the tip of her tongue to point out that it had worked out for Teagueto maybe even suggest that Carrigan would get the same results but she stopped.Their brother had been fortunate to the point of unbelievability.Lightning never struck the same place twice, and those were the odds for Carrigan to make a love match from the list of men their father had provided.I know.Carrigan took her hands.I didnt drag you in here so we could have a pity party.Things are the way they are.I just wanted to give you as much of a heads up as I could.Because she was next.The realization settled inside her, turning her blood to ice and her brain into a worthless buzz.As soon as Carrigan was safely carted away into a marriage, their father would turn his eye on her.Shed never pretended the Catholic devotion that her sister had, not to the point where it would be believable that she was considering joining a convent.Even if she had, their father wasnt likely to fall for the same ruse twice.No, hed strike quickly, while she was still young enough to be valuable.Pliable.It doesnt matter if I see it coming or not.Its inevitable.It seemed like her feet had been set on this path from birth.Shed never put much thought into it before, and now her time was up.What am I going to do with a husband?Sloan Carrigan hesitated, and then seemed to change what shed been about to say.Im sorry.She managed to squeeze her sisters hands back, even though her fingers were numb.Dont be sorry.Go enjoy your night.Do you want to come with me?She would have laughed if she had the breath for it.You know how much I hate those clubs.Dont worry about me.Ill be okay.A lie, but one Carrigan let her have.Sometimes it seemed there were more comforting lies than truths between them now.Well talk more soon.What was the point?They could talk for days on end, but it wouldnt change their circumstances.Helpless fury rose inside her.She was well and truly trapped, up to her neck in quicksand and sinking fast.God, what am I going to do?Four Carrigan stepped into the club and tried to tell herself that she was here for the right reasons.It had nothing to do with looking for James, and everything to do with proving to herself she wasnt afraid.Because she wasnt.The only reason hed gotten the best of her was because he kept catching her off guard.That wouldnt happen tonight.Even as the thought crossed her mind, she scanned the crowd, searching for that towering blond figure.Nothing.Ignoring the feeling that might have been disappointment souring her stomach, she wound through the dance floor and headed for the stairs leading to the VIP area.She needed a drink and to get her head on straight, and then shed go dance until she forgot what shed agreed to earlier today.Just like she always had.And maybe shed finally break her four month long dry spell She shook her head and climbed the stairs.No.Not tonight, and not a guy from here.It hadnt worked out so well last time, and she sure as hell wasnt looking for a repeat kidnapping.At the top of the stairs, she paused and let her eyes adjust to the dim lighting.Up here, there were no strobe lights or black lights or anything other than tiny lamps on each of the tables, throwing off just enough illumination so that someone could walk the entire floor without tripping over something.In theory.She headed for her favorite booth, but drew up short when she saw that it was occupied.Her brain took precious seconds to catch up to her eyes.There he was, the asshole, sitting in her booth with his legs stretched out in front of him, wearing those jeans that hugged his ass and thighs and a smug smirk, with his arms stretched out across the back of the booth.Challenging her.In case she missed all that written all over his face, there were two drinks in front of hima beer and, if she didnt miss her guess, a dirty martini.Her preferred drink.How the hell did he even know that?Oh yes, this was a challenge all right.Every intelligent cell in her brain demanded she turn around and walk away.Run away.But then the bastard raised an eyebrow, as if daring her to sit down and drink with him, and she threw common sense right out the window.Carrigan strode across the distance separating them, putting a little more swing into her step and smiling to herself when his gaze tracked the movement.Album or not, tangled history or no, he wanted her.And she wasnt above using that against him.Two nights in a row.I must have pissed off Lady Luck somehow.She sank onto the cushioned seat across the small table from him.The bartender appeared half a second later, and Carrigan smiled sweetly at her.A dirty martini, please.The woman looked at the table, looked back at her, and shrugged.Sure thing.If anything James just seemed more amused.Too good for my drinks?Im not stupid enough to take a drink Ive left unattended and Ive never laid eyes on this one until I got here.Party Girl 101.Now, lovely, why would I need to drug you?You came here of your own free will, just like I knew you would.He leaned forward and propped his elbows on his knees, drawing her gaze to the way his black T shirt clung to his shoulders and how his dangling hands seemed designed to frame the bulge between his legs.Her body zinged to life in a way it hadnt in months.It was all too easy to take a walk down memory lane and feel him lifting her against that wall and shoving his cock home, growling filthy words in her ear in that same tone of voice he was using now.Shit.She held his gaze even though all she wanted to do was look away.James wasnt pretty.He was far too masculine for that.The first time shed seen him, she thought hed look perfectly at home on the back of a Harley, and that perception hadnt changed with time.Everything about him screamed danger in a way she wasnt used to.The men in her family were dangerous there was no doubt of that but it was a polished danger.Jamess wasnt.He was gritty and primal andShe really needed to stop.Right now.I wouldnt put anything past you at this point.You wound me.You kidnapped me.Id say were nowhere near even.Something she had to keep reminding herself, though the fact she kept forgetting annoyed the hell out of her.Only a weak woman would get all aflutter over a man who obviously meant her harm.A weak woman or one with a death wish.Carrigan wasnt either.So why was she here, sitting across from him as if they were best pals?She leaned back and recrossed her legs.Why are you stalking me?If youd remember, you are the one who came to me.I was just sitting here, minding my own business, enjoying a drink.His cocky grin said otherwise.Hed known she would come back that she wouldnt be able to resist.The knowledge hed read that much in her personality in such a short time set her teeth on edge.Enjoy it in a different bar.Hell, in a different city.She had to get a handle on her attitude.As it was, she was practically waving a giant sign telling him that he got under her skin.There was no reason to hand him over more power than he already had and he already had too much.Now, lovely, dont be rude.Im buying you a drink.He nodded at the bartender as she handed over a duplicate of the dirty martini already sitting on the table.I can buy my own damn drink.She sounded surly and childish and hated it.You can do better than this.So do it.She watched a trio of girls who couldnt possibly be twenty one pass their booth, hips swinging wildly and sending come fuck me looks at the man across from her.He didnt even glance their way, which only aggravated her further.What do you want, James?You already know the answer to that question.Did she?Because she was starting to wonder, even though she knew better.He wants the album back.Plain and simple.Shed have to be a damn fool to think he actually wanted her.Pretend I dont.Instead of jumping right on that, he snagged his beer and drank deep while he watched her with those unnerving blue eyes.She couldnt shake the feeling that he saw more than she wanted to reveal.Carrigan took a sip of her own drink perfect, as always determined to wait him out and not speak again first.The silence stretched out between them like a live thing, twisting and snapping and full of too many things best left unsaid.Why?Why did you do it?Why did you make me feel so much and then turn around and betray me in every way that counted?They were questions shed never allow herself to ask because even the asking showed him that she cared in some small way.She didnt.She looked away, doing her damnedest to ignore the way her hand shook when she brought her drink to her lips.Why did your father bring you back to the city?It was so unexpected, she almost answered truthfully.She caught herself at the last minute.It doesnt really matter.It does.He shifted, once again drawing her attention to his big thighs.Powerful thighs.Every part of him was built powerfully, like he was a gladiator from ancient times.She had no problem picturing him wielding a sword in an arena somewhere, cutting through his enemies with the same determined look on his face that he wore now.Word has it that your father is arranging a marriage for you.Gossip is bad for the soul, she said in her most prim tone, even as her mind raced.She hadnt expected the news to be kept secret her father had no reason to hide his intentions for herbut hearing it from a man who was both an enemy and something more was disconcerting, to say the least.Shed only been back in town for three days either James had an inside man, or her father had put together that damn list of his long before she drove back into Boston.A thought struck her, and she blurted out, You arent thinking of throwing your hat into the ring, are you?His gaze sharpened on her face, searching for an answer she wasnt sure she had.It would almost be worth seeing the look on his face when I did.Her brain caught up to her mouth.Finally.She pressed her lips together, as if that would really do anything to help her maintain control.Control was one thing shed always prided herself on having if not over her life, then at least over herself.Being this close to James, even with a table between them, was making it hard to focus.You wouldnt dare.Wouldnt I?Yes.He so would.And her father wouldnt hesitate to shoot him, tentative truce or not.Carrigan stared at her drink, tilting it this way and that in the low light.After everything that happened, it shouldnt concern her if James Halloran had a death wish.It should serve him right to take a bullet the same way her little brother hade ven if he wasnt the one who gave the order but the thought of the world no longer holding him in it it was a cold one.Dont do it.I think Im insulted.The thought of marrying me is enough to shut you down completely.Funny, you dont sound particularly insulted.She had to get them off this subject the sooner, the better so she went on the offense.If youre hoping for a repeat of that night, youre in for the disappointment of a lifetime.Im never letting you touch me again.A strange smile pulled at the edges of his lips.Liar.She jerked back, her heart beating too hard.He wasnt flustered or worried or anything, except arrogant.Youre an insufferable jackass.Now was the time to get up and walk away, and put him in her rearview for good.But Carrigan had always had a nasty habit of playing with fire, and James was scorching hot.Guilty.He stood and moved around the table, slow and purposeful, to sit next to her, entirely too close.She started to shift away, but his heavy arm dropped around her shoulder.The feeling of his bare skin across her shoulders made her whole body clench up.Torn between wanting to bolt and wanting to crawl into his lap, she froze.James had no such problem.He wound a lock of her hair around his finger.You want me, lovely.You want me so bad you burn with it.With every turn of his finger, he brushed her bare shoulder with his knuckles, the gentle touch making things low in her stomach coil tighter and tighter.She dug her nails into her palms.She wasnt weak and she wasnt afraid, and she sure as fuck wasnt going to melt into a puddle at his feet just because hed casually touched her.Youre wrong.*** James wasnt wrong.Across the careful distance hed created between their bodies, he had no problems picking out the signs of desire.Her pulse fluttered, heart beating too hard; her pupils dilated, and her nipples pressed against the thin fabric of her sad excuse for a dress.The damn thing barely covered her from breasts to ass, and the fit was enough to tell anyone who cared to look that she wore nothing underneath.It wasnt the same one shed worn they night they hooked up, but it was close enough to make his mouth water.The fire in her eyes as she did her best to take him out at the knees only made him want her more.He leaned closer, still keeping the precious inches between their bodies.He might want this woman more than sanity, but she was like some kind of wild creature thatd wandered into his life.One false move and it was over.Letting her go last night was the right thing to do.Hed piqued her curiosity, added a healthy dose of anger and, maybe, she felt even a sliver of the desire that threatened to take his common sense and turn him into a goddamn fool.But he had to play this right or shed be gone for good.Itd be better for both of them if she was.Smarter.But taking the safe and smart road didnt stand a chance with a woman like her looking at him with that expression in her eyes.His lips brushed her ear, her rose scent teasing him.Im not wrong, lovely.You crave me the same way I crave you.I dont.The words were barely more than a whisper, almost lost in the demanding beat drifting up from the dance floor.You do.And if I slipped my hand up your dress, Id find you wet and wanting.Fuck, he wanted to do just that.Only sheer stubbornness kept his free hand away from her when she shivered.It wouldnt take much, would it?A few strokes to make your eyes slide shut and your head fall back.Circle that sensitive little clit of yours and feel you come apart around me.Her back arched, so slight that he would have missed it if every fiber of his being wasnt focused on her.No He had to get the fuck away from her before he did exactly what hed just described.The VIP room was far from packed and, even if it hadnt been, no one would blink an eye at two people hooking up in the shadows.But it wouldnt get him anywhere with Carrigan, aside from a few moments of pleasure.Then shed be gone, and he had the feeling he wouldnt be seeing her again in the near future if ever.That didnt suit his purposes one goddamn bit.So he pressed a soft kiss to the sensitive spot behind her ear and backed the fuck off.When she turned and blinked those big green eyes at him, he almost threw caution to the wind and kissed her.Only the knowledge that it wouldnt stop with a kiss, wouldnt stop until he was buried between her thighs, kept him from giving in.Ill be seeing you, Carrigan OMalley.Still holding her gaze, he grabbed his beer and drained the rest of it.Hed already taken care of the tab with the bartender, so he stood and, with one last look at her, walked away.It felt unnatural to do it, but it was becoming increasingly clear that the fire in his blood for Carrigan wasnt going away.Hed been so sure it would, that seeing her again would be enough to bring common sense rushing back and remind him that she was the enemy and hed done the right thing when hed chosen his family over her.Except that certainty hadnt come last night.And it sure as fuck wasnt here tonight, either.All he could think about as he strode down the stairs to the main club floor was that hed well and truly fucked up.She was within her rights to never forgive him.Hell, he wouldnt forgive him if he was in her position.And wanting her forgiveness had nothing at all to do with the damn album.Fuck.He settled into an empty spot at the bar and waited.Just because he was giving her space didnt mean he was going to leave before seeing her safely into a cab.She wouldnt thank him for the babysitting detail, but hed never forgive himself if something happened to her because he wasnt watching.What the hell am I thinking?Something is happening to her.Hed hoped against hope that the rumor hed heard about her old man selling her off to one of his allies was false.The look on her face had told him otherwise.Knowing she was destined for a political marriage was like watching a hawk get its wings clipped, or a tiger be declawed.While it was possible that shed maintain the fiery personality and streak of wildness that called to him on a level he wasnt prepared to deal with it was just as likely that her future husband would kill that part of her, leaving a dead eyed Stepford wife in her place.The thought burned.Beating some sense into Seamus OMalley sounded satisfying as fuck, but ultimately it wouldnt change anything.Nothing James did would change anything.And hell if that knowledge didnt stick in his throat.The minutes ticked by, but it wasnt too long before Carrigan appeared at the top of the stairs like some kind of fallen angel.He couldnt see her eyes from where he stood, but he imagined her a queen surveying her kingdom.The moment her gaze landed on him, her body went tense.He waited, curious to see what shed do.She marched down the stairs, her hips swinging with each step.But instead of coming to give him a piece of her mind, she shot him a look and disappeared onto the dance floor.That shit was a dare if he ever saw one.He was moving before he made a decision to, stalking after her.People took one look at him and parted like the Red Sea.He walked through them without pausing, stopping when he caught sight of her, her hands above her head, her eyes closed, her body moving with the writhing beat of the song.She was the most beautiful thing hed ever seen.His plans to keep his distance went up in a puff of smoke and he closed the space between them, needing to touch her more than he needed his next breath.James slipped behind her, resting his hands on her hips.It took all of three seconds to pick up her rhythm and match it, fitting himself behind her.She arched back against him, her arms looping around his neck and her head resting on his chest as they ground together.Stupid.This wasnt part of the plan, wasnt part of keeping control of the situation.Because if anyone was in control right now, it was Carrigan.She guided him with the rolling of her hips, her ass against his cock, the heat of her searing through his clothes as if they didnt exist.Unable to help himself, he coasted his hands up her sides to frame her ribs, his thumbs brushing the undersides of her breasts with every other beat.She moved closer in response, rotating in his grasp until they faced each other, her chest pressed against his chest and her fingers twined in his hair.She went onto her tiptoes, dragging her body up his, and he groaned in response.James?Yeah, lovely?A little voice tried to pipe up to point out that hed give her damn near anything with her moving against him like this, but he ignored it, waiting for her answer.I might want you He tightened his grip on her hips.She laughed, a sound he felt more than heard.But you try that manipulative shit on me again, and I will go for your throat.And then she was gone, slipping through his arms like smoke.He stood there like a damn fool, sporting a hard on for the record books and watching her walk away.He shook his head and followed.Head games or not, his needing to see her safely to a cab hadnt changed.Fuck, he was almost proud of her for turning the tables on him so efficiently, even if he was going to suffer for it physically.He could weather a little suffering and, to be honest, hed seen a whole hell of a lot worse.James grinned.He followed her out of the club, letting her pull ahead, and leaned against a wall as she flagged down a cab.Only once it veered back out into traffic did he turn and head for his ride.Damn that woman, but he only got more intrigued with each interaction.He looked forward to seeing what the next one brought.That small voice in his head tried to pipe up again, tried to remind him that she wasnt his and never would be, but he ignored it.She wasnt married yet and if she was willing to play, he was more than willing to go the distance.Five Jamess phone rang when he hit Southie.He glanced at the clock on the screen.Two a. m.  Nothing good came from calls at this hour.With a curse, he answered, What?Trouble.No shit.Michael wouldnt be calling him for anything else.Tell me.Tit for Tat.Rickys there.Well, shit again.There wasnt a need for more goddamn information.Their brother, Brendan, had been killed in that strip joint four months ago.James had never liked the place, and that went double since it used to be the front for human trafficking of the young and pretty variety.Hed put a stop to that shit the second he took over the Hallorans.Now the only women who worked there were there of their own choice.If they turned tricks on the side, that was up to them, but they traded a percentage for his protection.It was as fair a deal as he could offer them, and most were more than happy with the arrangement.There was no goddamn reason for Ricky to be there that wouldnt send Jamess blood pressure straight through the fucking roof.When?They left fifteen minutes ago.At least this time he could nip this shit right in the bud instead of dealing with it hours later.He turned right at the next light.Meet me there.Will do, boss.He hung up and floored it.There was no rational reason to think that his brother was up to somethingother than every other fucking time he turned around, Ricky was finding ways to undermine him.Whatever familial bond theyd had as kids, it was gone now.My brother would happily see me dead and out of the way now.James blew out a breath.It was a truth he hadnt wanted to deal with before, but it was the truth.He let it settle inside him as he pulled up in front of Tit for Tat.The building looked damn near indistinguishable from the ones around it, aside from the neon sign out front advertising full nudes.Only its patrons knew exactly what was offered on the insidethem and the few cops he had on the payroll to keep his ass out of the fire.He hated dirty cops.There was something fundamentally wrong with a man who put a price on his honor, no matter how useful they were when it came to keeping his people out of jail.But then, honor wasnt something James had the luxury of holding close.He didnt have an inch of high ground to stand on.Not anymore.Inside it was hot and darkaside from the brightly lit stagesand stank of lust and greed.James headed for the bar, ignoring the scattering of men watching Echo swing herself around a pole, her dark hair flying behind her.He nodded at Tawna, noting at how shaken she looked.Her wide blue eyes made her look younger than her twenty something years, and she actually seemed grateful to catch sight of him.If he had any doubt that Ricky was here, it vanished then.The sins of their father seemed to be something both his brothers had inherited.Some days he thought it hadnt really skipped him, no matter how much he wanted it to.Wheres my brother?She pointed a shaking finger to the stairs, and he mentally cursed in every single fucking way he knew.He hadnt been up there since Brendans death, and he could have spent the rest of his life without doing it again.Goddamn it.It took simultaneously too much time and not nearly enough to get up those rickety ass stairs.They needed to be torn out and replaced, but no one would ever do it.That wasnt the kind of place Tit for Tat was.At the top, the hallway of doors stretched out, all of them closed.This was where the girls brought men for lap dances or the other side of their business.The thin doors let out more sounds than they concealed, but his destination wasnt in any of them.No, it was the final doorthe one containing what passed for an office.He found Ricky sitting behind the massive desk, deep in conversation with two men James didnt recognize.If that wasnt a giant ass red flag, the fact his brother had managed to clean up his shaggy blond hair and find a button up shirt somewhere was.He was crashing a business meetingone he wasnt supposed to know about from the flash of worry that appeared on his brothers face.Ricky shot to his feet.James.There wasnt a damn thing he could do until he knew what the hell was going on, but he didnt need to let his little brother know that.He jerked his chin at the door.Out.Ricky hesitated, but James had too much practice using his cold stare to manipulate people.His brother didnt stand a chance.He slunk through the door like a beaten dog with his tail between his legs.James waited several long seconds to make sure he didnt change his mind, and then took the seat behind the desk.Gentlemen.The two men were anything but.Oh, they cleaned up well enough with their cheap suits, but there was no mistaking the glint in their eyes.Killers, both of them.What in the ever loving fuck was Ricky doing meeting with these guys?They exchanged a look, and the man on the right, a redhead with hands the size of hams, leaned forward.Since you didnt seem to be aware of the meeting taking place, Ill bring you up to speed.Were not interested in the internal power games the Hallorans have going onall we care about is getting paid.That was a relief, though he doubted hed get lucky next time.Then were on the same page.Whats the merchandise?Another shared look between the men.We heard you were down on your inventory.The redhead motioned at the club around them.We have a crop hitting the harbor two weeks from now.Theyre good stock, so were commanding top price.Girls.They were shipping in more girls, and Ricky had been Johnny on the spot to buy them up.Just like Brendan used to.It was officialwhen James got his hands around his fool brothers neck, he was going to strangle the fucking life out of him.They were out of the flesh trade.But if he didnt buy up these girls, some other piece of shit would.For a second he almost let it go.It wasnt his problem.He had more than enough to deal with without adding this to the mix.He eyed the men, both who James would bet had been in this business for years.They didnt care if he agreed to this purchase.There were plenty of buyers, even in this day and age.If he turned them away, they wouldnt blink at supplying someone else.Someone who would be more than willing to sell unwilling women to men who didnt care about consent.Godfuckingdamn it.He smiled through gritted teeth.Lets talk money.As much as he wanted this done and over with, he took the time to haggle with the men.There was no telling if he would have to deal with them again, and it set a shitty precedent for him to give in to the first price they named without bargaining.But, fuck, he hated every second of it.By the time they settled on a price that was respectable but not insulting, he felt like hed been hit by a truck.They arranged to have the merchandise dropped at an agreed upon location on a date two weeks from now.He watched the pair walk out of the office, and seriously debated grabbing the gun fastened beneath the desk and putting two slugs in each of them.It wouldnt do a damn thing to help either the situation or how fucking filthy he currently felt.Slave traders were like cockroaches.You managed to kill one, and three more popped up in its place.Taking out these two wouldnt help the girls on that boat coming in, or the ones that would undoubtedly follow.Fuck.He pinched the bridge of his nose, wishing he could just douse himself in bleach and be done with it.He couldnt save the world.Hell, he couldnt even save his little corner of it.The best he could do was figure out some place for those girls where they werent forced to be little better than sex slaves.They would get a choice.They would have some sort of income from a job.Hed make sure of it.But first he had to deal with Ricky.James looked up to find his brother standing in the doorway, puffed up like he was ready for confrontation.Too fucking bad.He wasnt going to get one.Sit.You cant just Sit.He didnt raise his voice, but he didnt have to.Ricky had been conditioned from a very young age to respond to that particular icy tone, just the same as James and Brendan.His older brother hadnt ever bothered to learn the trick of speaking like that, because his sheer size and personality got his way more often than not.James was a firm believer of stocking his arsenal with every weapon available to him.Their fathers furious tone was one of them.Ricky shut the door and dropped into one of the vacated chairs.I was taking initiative.You were trying to undermine me.Again.He couldnt let this go on any longer.Hed tried to reasoning with Ricky.Hed tried intimidating.Hed tried damn near everything.Nothing worked.Every time he turned around, his brother was doing something else to sow dissent and fuck up Jamess life.The longer he let it go on, the weaker his position became.God damn you for making me do this.James typed out a text, never taking his gaze off his brother.You know what happens next.Rickys blue eyes, so similar to his, went wide.James Dont you dare play the fucking innocent.You knew what you were doingdeal with the consequences.The door opened again, and this time Michael and Jake came through, one of the other men James was reasonably sure of.They hauled Ricky out of his chair, and out of the room.To his credit, he didnt yell or fight.But the look he sent James made him cold right down to his bones.Hed known his brother hated him.He hadnt wanted to admit it, but hed known all the same.It was a truth hed made as much peace as he could with.Now he had to deal with Ricky blatantly wanting him dead.Well, fuck.He waited for the door to close and then slumped into his chair.Hed known this shit wasnt going to be a picnic from the moment he lost Brendan.Being heir was never something James wanted, but hed done his damnedest to step up and do right by the family.Naive as it apparently was, hed never expected his remaining brother to turn on him.Truth be told, he hadnt expected a lot of things.He sighed.As much as he wanted to get the hell out of here and wash off the stench of this place, since he was here, he needed to check in with the manager and make sure things were still going smoothly.He hadnt heard anything recently, but he was learning the hard way that just because information didnt come directly to him didnt mean it wasnt happening.And Ricky taking an interest in Tit for Tat was a red flag he couldnt ignore.A quick phone call brought Lisa Marie up.She was an old battle ax who had worked her way up from waitressing to the pole to running the whole damn place.She had to have put sixty in the rearview mirror years ago, but she hadnt missed a beat.As he watched, she snubbed out a cigarette and lit up another one.Whatcha need, honey?I havent been in here in a few weeks.Bring me up to date.You want to know what that brother of yours is up to.Her shrewd gray eyes saw too much.Hes been in here five days out of seven, sniffing around.He takes over the office and has people coming and going.Dont know what hes up to, but Id bet my left tit hes up to something.She exhaled a plume of smoke.The little shit told me were starting up with those girls again.Were not.Good.Made my girls nervous.She tapped the cigarette into the ashtray on the desk.Ever since that other brother of yours diedGod rest his soulbusiness is up fifteen percent.Probably because Brendan scared the living shit out of everyone smart enough to know what trouble looked like.It kept those men and their money away from Tit for Tat.James tapped his fingers on the desk.Ricky seemed all too ready to step into Brendans shoes, and that was something he couldnt allow.Like it or not, theyd taken a hit when he put a stop to the flesh trade.They needed the bump of legit money.Are the other clubs seeing the same increase?More or less.She leaned back and crossed her legs, stick thin and covered in pants made of something like spandex.Having willing girls makes a difference.Johns can tell.And the ones who liked the fearwell, I dont want to deal with that shit.Neither did James.He waited, seeing from the tension in her shoulders that there was something more.People didnt like silences, especially uncomfortable ones like this was quickly evolving into.Lisa Marie knew the tacticit was one hed seen her use beforeand she gave him a sardonic smile.Youre not a puppy anymore, James Halloran.Maybe not, but he still felt like a small fish in an ocean full of sharks.Every time he turned around, another threat was rising at his back.It was fucking exhausting.Still, he waited.She sighed, smoke drifting out of her nostrils.That Ricky The seconds stretched into minutes.Finally, he relented.Tell me.I know hes family.Her sudden hesitance set his teeth on edge.If theres something I need to know, spit it the fuck out.That got her moving again.She snubbed out her cigarette.Hes been taking a family discount with the girlsand them saying yes isnt necessary.Her words left him cold all over.Fuck, fuck, fuck.He kept all expression off his face through sheer force of will, but it was a battle.Hed known his little brother was teetering on the edge, but apparently hed already reached the point of no return.Fuck.And James had sat idly by while his brother played fox in the henhouse.It didnt matter if he hadnt known.Those women were under his protection, same as every other person in Halloran territory.And hed failed them.Ill need a list of names.His voice was so cold, it was a wonder the bottle of beer in front of him didnt ice over.Sure thing.Thats all.He waited until she was almost to the door to say, And, Lisa Marie.Yeah, honey?My brother is no longer allowed in this clubor any of the ones in Halloran territory.He couldnt let this go on unchecked.Ricky wasnt trustworthy, and James wasnt about to let his brother near people they were supposed to be protecting until he could be sure he wouldnt have to protect them from Ricky.She fumbled a new cigarette out of her pack, cursing when it fell to the faded carpet.But Its not open for discussion.Inform the bouncers.If he gives you trouble, you call me, you understand?I understand.She scooped up the cigarette and fled the room, shutting the door softly behind her.Goddamn it.He hated playing the monster.The more often he put on the mask, the less like a mask it felt.Making Lisa Marie scurry from the room left a bad taste in his mouth.No one seemed to notice or care that he was trying to do the right thing.That knowledge shouldnt surprise him, and it sure as hell shouldnt sting.It did.He pushed to his feet with a sigh.Once he had the list of girls, hed figure out his next step.He couldnt just throw money at themitd be insult to injurybut there had to be something he could do.There was no making something like this right, but fuck if he was going to ignore it.No one approached him as he walked down the stairs and through the club.He was used to people being wary of him, but there was actual fear in the air.It clung to the back of his throat, a taste he wished he didnt know.He had to struggle to keep his pace even and walk out of there like nothing was wrong.The cold night air didnt do shit to keep him feel like the world was closing in on him.James made it to his car and climbed in, locking the doors and starting the engine.Only then did he lean back against the seat and close his eyes and concentrate on breathing.Inhale.Hold for one, two, three.Exhale.And again.By the fifth time, the static hovering at the edge of his thoughts retreated and he was able to put the car into gear and get the hell out of there.He wished But no, there was no point in wishing on stars or any of that shit.His life was the way it was, and so was his current situation.It was sink or swim.If he sank, hed take down too many people with him.Ricky had more than proven that he wouldnt protect the weak under his domain.Even if James was willing to leave the Halloran name and responsibilities behind, he couldnt leave the people who needed him.It would just be so much easier to handle this shit if he was sure that the kernel of evil that seemed to flourish in his old man and brothers wasnt doing the same damn thing inside of him.He wasnt a good man.He had no illusions about that.But there was a long haul between not good and fucking monster.He hoped.He grabbed his phone before he could think better of it, and dialed the number hed had for months but never used.It rang and rang, and right when he was about to hang up, she answered, Hello?Carrigans voice was like a soft ocean breeze, washing away all the shit of the last few hours.James took his first full breath since he left the strip club.Hey, lovely.Six Carrigan sat up in bed, blinking into the darkness.She had to be dreaming.It was the only explanation for hearing Jamess voice growling in her ear.But no, it couldnt be a dream because she hadnt been sleeping.She checked the clock.Four a. m.  Shed left him at the club a little over two hours ago.He should behell, she didnt know.Doing anything else but calling her right now.What do you want?Instead of coming out harsh, the words were barely more than a whisper.Needy.Damn it.He took a long time to answer, his breathing the only thing breaking the silence between them.Its the damnedest thing, Carrigan, but I dont fucking know.It might have been the realest thing hed ever said to her.She stared into the darkness, her mind frantically paging through possible responseseverything from making a joke and turning things sexual to actually responding in kindbut James spoke again before she had a chance to settle on a choice.Right now, though, I want you.There they wereback on firm ground once again.She knew how to verbally spar with this man, how to keep him at a distance while still wanting him closer, how to dance on the dangerous edge of the attraction that licked between them like the hottest flame.She didnt know how to deal with the soul deep weariness hed just shown her.So she ignored it.Like I havent heard that before.This is different.His growl sent delicious shivers through her body.She settled back against her headboard, allowing a small smile.It wasnt like he could see it.How do you figure?Because all those other men who have said it to you before werent worthy.Big words.Oh, and I suppose you are?Yeah.More than that, Im the only one whos going to truly have you.Carrigan laughed because it was the only appropriate response to the sheer cockiness of his words.He was going to be the only one to have her?The man was even more delusional than she could have guessed.I dont know if you noticed it that night, but I was hardly a blushing virgin when we met.She found herself holding her breath, waiting for the inevitable demands to tell him how many men had been there before him.Or maybe hed assume there had been only one, and the sheer magnitude of his masculine presence had been enough to stir her almost virgin heart.In her experience, men fell into only one of those two categories.They constructed their own beliefs about an experienceabout herand when faced with evidence that they were wrong, they looked at her like she was either a whore or a virgin in disguise.There was no middle ground.They dont matter.He said it totally dismissively, as if it was actually true.She blinked.What?Theyre the past.We all have a past, lovely.It doesnt matter who they were or how many or if you loved or hated every single one of them.She didnt know whether to laugh or cry or just hang up.Damn him to hell and back for blocking off all the things shed done with a few short words.If he was trying to mindfuck her, he was doing a hell of a job with it.Im not ashamed of what Ive done.Why should you be?His voice dropped an octave.Those choices led you to me, after all.The nerve.I number you among the mistakes.No, you dont.He sounded amused again.Ass.God, youre completely insufferable.It didnt seem to matter what she said, because he always had a comeback ready.Worse, he sounded like he actually meant them.Carrigan shook her head.What she should do was hang up the phone and block this number.To do anything else was just encouraging him, and that was the last thing she should want.Right?I want to know something.Whats that?She really had to work on her mouth getting away from her.Maybe she wouldnt be in this situation if she had better control.If her father found outShe glanced at her bedroom door and took a minute to pad across her room to make sure it was locked.The cell phone had been a gift from Teague several years ago, something that she could have without fear of the family monitoring every call and text.Though she seriously doubted hed approve of the way she was currently using it.Why did you come back to the club tonight?She froze in the middle of climbing back onto her massive bed.To answer that was to strip bare a small part of her.It wasnt anywhere near her center, but it was still closer than she wanted to let James.Then hang up, idiot.But she didnt.Instead, she answered.Honestly.Curiosity.You know what they say about curiosity and that damn cat.Yeah, she did, and that hadnt stopped her.Her days were numbered as it wasif she didnt use what was left of her freedom to take chances, she was wasting precious time.Are you planning on hurting me, James?Maybe finishing what your father started?Fuck, no.The world would be a darker place without you in it.Before she could fully process that comment, he moved on.Youre not being strictly honest, though.It was more than curiosity that drove you to sit down across that table from me.He was right.It had been a number of things that she didnt want to give voice to.This conversation was already strange enoughit was almost intimate to sit here on her bed in the darkness and exchange words with him.Which meant she had to do what shed been shoring herself up to since the moment she realized he was on the other end of this call.Good night, James.A little too close to the truth, huh?He sounded like he was smiling.I can take a hinton occasion.Good night, lovely.
