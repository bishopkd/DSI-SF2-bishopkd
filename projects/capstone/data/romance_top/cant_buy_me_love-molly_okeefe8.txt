Jacob was a blur running out the door, all thoughts of Tara and the bedazzler clearly stomped into the dirt by the prospect of a hockey arena.I cant believe something called peewees beats bedazzling.I cant believe theres something called bedazzling.He touched her ponytail where it sat, a fat curl on her shoulder.I waited for you last night, he said.I waited for you!she laughed, and he smiled.You know what we need?he asked, leaning against her drafting table, as if it were normal.As if standing here and flirting was something theyd done a thousand times.His hands in her hair felt so good and she tilted her head up to get more.More of his touch.More of him.Ten minutes and a flat surface?He choked on a laugh.A date.And just like that, her delight in the moment crashed and burned.Dates, in her experience, felt like a business transaction.Dinner for sex.The better the dinner, the better the show she had to put on.I dont like dates.That, he kissed her nose, is because youve never been on one with me.That good, huh?Ive been known to show a girl a good time.You like horror movies?No.Mini golf?Youre kidding, right?Go carts?Are you sixteen?All you can eat buffets?We can go dutch.This man in front of her, with the smile and the warmth, the twinkle in his beautiful eyes, was an utter departure from the Ice Man.A different man.And she felt, oddlyand perhaps that was his goallike she was the only woman to ever see him like this.Jacob was rightshe was lucky.How about dinner at The Ritz?he asked.Oh, Im really going to have to put out now, arent I?The teasing faded from his expression, and his hand left her shoulder, but his eyes didnt leave her face.I dont think of you that way.I swear I dont.She wondered, briefly, whether he was trying to convince himself or her.But the thought felt treasonous; hed been nothing but good to her.Thats all right.I think of you like that.He didnt laugh, and she tilted her head.Luc You know Im leaving, right?The question blew her back in her stool.When the season starts, Im leaving.Ill sell the land to Eli and I wont be back.Laughter bubbled out of her throat before she could stop it.Its one of the things I like best about you, Luc.You dont need to worry that Im planning our pig roast wedding.I just dont want to hurt you, Tara.He was so earnest, so sweet in his concern, and she pressed her lips to his.Im very tough.His lips lingered over hers, his tongue licking at the crease and she let him in, falling right back into lust, as if the hours since the last time theyd kissed him hadnt happened.The blaring honk of a car horn pulled them apart.Jacob, Luc said, kissing her nose.Youd better go.I was surprised to find him in here.Hes been coming by.He likes to draw.Last week you didnt want him in your workshop, and now youre inviting him in for arts and crafts?What changed?Everything.Absolutely everything, but she didnt know how to say that without sounding crazy.Without somehow ruining the magic that had suddenly appeared in her life.Im notIm not good with kids.But Im trying.Are you scared of him?Luc asked, all too knowing.Maybe.Yes.Well, he is terrifying.All that asthma.Lucky for you Ive saved you from the seven year old.He walked across her workshop and paused at the door as if he was about to say something else.She wondered, poised on the tips of her hope, if he was going to ask her to come with him.Because she wanted to go.Her work was done, the samples shipped off.She wanted to play hookie.Do you want to come Yes.She grabbed her purse and stood.He blinked at her sudden agreement.Youll, ahneed a coat.Its a hundred degrees outside.Its an ice arena.Trust me.I dont want you to get cold.She grabbed a coat from the rack behind her desk, wondering how he made such a simple statement sound like a line from a love song.You know they have flat surfaces at the arena and I bet I could find us ten minutes.Tossing her hair over her shoulder, she breezed past him.Im holding out for The Ritz.She put the old swing back in her walk, knowing just how she looked in tight denim, and his chuckle was like music to her ears.22 Good practice, guys, Luc said, and all the little kids cheered, half of them falling on the ice at the effort.Luc laughed, hoisting them up by their pads.Jacob wasnt one of them.The kid was rock solid on his skates.He wasnt fast, he had no idea how to hold a stick, but he could stay on his blades, and that put him slightly ahead of the class.Great job, buddy, Tara said as she awkwardly helped Jacob off the ice and onto the mats leading back to the changing rooms.Luc would be lying if he said he wasnt totally turned on by the sight of Tara Jean in a hockey arena.She wore this white breezy top under a denim coat and when she leaned over he could see the tops of her breasts, and while that was hot, what was really killing him was the smile on her face.It illuminated her, and in her joy she was a different person.Can you help me with my pads?Jacob asked.Who?Me?Tara asked, glancing up at Luc as if the boy had asked her to help him rob a bank.You just pull, Luc said.Its not that hard.Ohwell, okay.I can help you.Jacob wobbled his way across the mats toward the dressing room.Tara turned to follow, but Luc couldnt let her go without a kiss.A quick press of cold lips and colder cheeks.A hot swipe of tongue.Perfect.There are kids present, Baker, she chastised, kissing him quickly and then turning to follow Jacob, taking his hand as they went down the stairs.Billy, in a suit with the tie pulled askew, stood against the bleachers watching.Shut it, Luc said, unable to suppress a smile.Its good to see you happy, thats all.Howd the meeting go?Luc asked.His friend had had a breakfast meeting with the Dallas brass and then gone to check out his new condo before meeting Luc at the rink.Fine, he sighed, catching a kid by the shoulder pads when the boy looked like he was about to go down.Theyre talking about team building and everyone knows Ive only got a few years left.By the time the team builds enough to get a playoff spot Ill be out to pasture.You dont know that, Luc said, but Billy was probably right.Come on, look at us, Billy said.If we were smarter, wed be getting out.I never claimed to be smart, Luc said, and Billy smiled, but both of them knew they were skating into overtime.Hey!He heard the scrape of skates over ice and knew Tyler was behind him.All the peewees were off the ice.You ready, Mr.Baker?Your protg awaits, Billy said, and Luc tried not to roll his eyes.The kid was impatient and oftentimes rude.Talented, yes.But the longer he worked with the kid, the more the attitude came out.And now there was too much attitude for it to be any fun.Maybe that was why he liked the peewees.No attitude.But Tara Jean was going to be sitting up in those stands and he was going to skate that kid into the ice.Not that he was showing off or anything.You mind taking Jacob home?Luc asked, realigning some tape on his stick and carefully avoiding looking at Billy.The kid cramping your style?I justit would be nice to have some time alone with her.Dinner.A movie or something.Something normal.Billy nodded.Unless you want me to get out there and teach Tyler some lessons.Hes getting a little too comfortable with the cheap shots.I got it.Luc pushed off the boards.Whoa, where are your pads?Billy asked.Your helmet.Luc smiled, his skates biting into the ice.Its just some drills, Billy.I think I can handle it.Tara Jean walked back into the arena after getting Jacob strapped into the back of Billys Jeep and sat down in the empty bleachers, shivering in her light coat.Billy had offered to give her a ride home, his scarred lip twisting in a knowing smile, and Tara Jean had declined, a blush climbing her cheeks.A blush.Her.Tara Jean Sweet.All because Luc had rigged it so they could have some time alone.Dinner at The Ritz sounded good.Sounded perfect right about now.She watched Luc on the ice with a young man.They were working some drills, and she could hear Lucs voice correcting the boy as he skated down the ice.Luc kept getting in the kids way, taking the puck like it was candy.She smiled when Luc laughed.The young man didnt like that, his voice rose in anger, but Luc kept laughing.The kid started skating harder, steam all but rising from his skates.But Luc was always just ahead of him.Tara Jean.The world dropped away.The voice in her ear was the last one she had expected to hear, and for a second it didnt register.It didnt make any sense.Dennis stepped over the bleacher to sit beside her.Shocked, unable to force herself into motion, she gaped at him.The man was frayed around the edges, his polish long gone.His beard was coming in, making him look like a weasel.The dark shadow under his bloodshot eye hinted at an aging shiner.What the hell are you doing?Her hands fumbled as she pulled her phone out of her purse.I have a protection order.You cant be here.With one hand he grabbed her phone, tossing it a few bleachers down as if it were nothing.As if her protection order were nothing.She stood and opened her mouth to scream, but Dennis reached up and grabbed her by the back of her hair.Your fucking protection order is the least of my problems, bitch.I need that money.Fuck you.He clenched his fist, pulling all the fine hair at her nape, and she couldnt swallow the cry of pain.Do you think Im kidding?he asked, nearly spitting in her face.Do you think this is a joke?I need that money.You wont get it.Luc Yeah, Luc.Your dickwad boyfriends got someone following me asking questions about us.For a second she went numbthe pain in her head, the fear in her heartand for a heartbeat she felt nothing.What?Yeah, he grinned.Not so tough right now, are you?Listen, if I get dragged down without that money, Im taking you with me.I will ruin you, Jane.And Ill ruin that family.Get me that money.Let go of me, she said through her teeth and the second he let go of her hair she leapt to her feet, getting as much distance between them as she could.On the ice, Luc was skating her way, watching the younger man skating to his left, but at her movement he lifted his head.For a moment he seemed to smile, but then Dennis stood up beside her and Lucs smile vanished, replaced by the intensity and hate she hadnt seen since he first arrived at the ranch.Luc dropped his stick and shook off his gloves, running toward the boards, no doubt ready to climb up there in his ice skates to take Denniss head off.But on the ice, the young man Luc was skating with shook off his gloves, misinterpreting Lucs aggression.Fine, the boy yelled, lets go, old man.Luc turned his head just as the young man rammed him into the boards.There was a scuffle, a fleshy thud, and then they both fell to the ice, the boards blocking her view.Dennis pushed her, knocking her down hard on her hip, and she scrambled back up, reaching for his shirt as he leapt over the bleachers.Ill find you, Dennis sneered, looking at her over his shoulder.Dennis cleared the last bleacher and sprinted down the hallway toward the stairs that led to the parking lot.Damn it!she thought, rubbing her elbow where it had banged into the hard wooden benches.Help!someone yelled and she whirled toward the ice.The young man was on his feet, his helmet gone, red hair sticking up on his head in thick, wild clumps, his face white with panic.I need help!Panic ballooned in her chest at the sight of Lucs legs on the ice, his upper body still blocked by the boards.He wasnt moving.23 Luc came to, in large part because of the smell.The closest smell to home he had.Sweat.Bengay.Rubber.He was in a locker room.But beneath the sweat and disinfectant was an underlying note of strawberry.His eyelids popped open and then immediately slammed shut, his eyeballs screaming in pain, blasted by white hot light.Luc?It was Tara Jean.The strawberry smell washed over his face and he could feel her, just above him.God, his head hurt or hed be worried about what was going on, what had happened.Not to say he wasnt, but the pain sort of made everything else a distant second on the worry scale.Luc.Again, the sweet wash of strawberry, made sweeter by the warmth of her hand on his.She curled her fingers around his and he held on, happy to have a lifeline in the sea of pain.Can you hear me?He opened his mouth, but speaking seemed a ridiculous idea.So he nodded and winced.You need a doctor His eyes flew open and his fingers clamped down on hers.He didnt know what was going on, what had happened, but he knew doctors were not a good idea.No doctors.She leaned over him, blocking out the white hot light.Lights, actually.His vision cleared, her face in focus.Hi, he said, happy to have her here, over him.He glanced down and could practically see her belly button through the gaping neck of her shirt.You have pretty boobs.Oh my lord, she muttered, clapping a hand to that wide open neckline, blocking his view of her lace bra and the flesh rising out of it.You must be feeling better.Whatwhat happened?You got knocked out.For a moment he was blank, almost weightless with that calm before the storm, but then his stomach twisted and anger chugged in his veins and a terrible sense of inevitability nearly crushed him.Tyler.He says he didnt even hit you that hard.You just went down.But he feels terrible.Hes outside, practically pulling out his hair.Good, Luc murmured.Maybe hell second guess a cheap shot next time.Are you She paused.Her fingers touched his head, his hair, and it was so sweet, like being touched by sunlight on a cold day.You okay?How long was I out?Long enough; I called an ambulance.He curled upward and realized he was on a small cot in a closet sized supply room just off the showers.No ambulance.But No ambulance!he yelled and immediately regretted it.His head pounded.Hed been knocked out, just like Doc said he could be.If he got in an ambulance, hed go to a hospital, see a doctor who would want a CT scan.And he wouldnt be able to hide the damage.The parasites would catch wind and it would all be over.His career.His life.Taras hand slid down his back and he shook off her touch.Luc?Leave me the fuck alone.She straightened, staring down at him as if hed grown a second head.No.Now isnt the time to be stubborn.I could say the same.He twisted, ignoring the pain, the flashes at the edge of his vision.Get.Out.Her face mutinous, she sat.Youve been knocked out, Luc.Im not leaving you alone.Youre freaking me out.Join the club, he thought, join the freaking out club.His shoulders curled over his knees.Whats going on, Luc?I cant go to the hospital.A doctor He lifted his chin to take great gulps of air, hoping that would calm him down, center him in the maelstrom of ugly despair growing in his chest.Talk to me, Luc.He couldnt, he couldnt let these words out of his mouth.He bit them back, swallowed them into his stomach where they bubbled and rolled back up his throat, knocking at his teeth, looking for a way out.Luc, she breathed, its just us in this room.You can talk to me.I get knocked out a lot, he spat, punishing her because she was here and there was so much rage in his chest.And now, Ive got some scar tissue on my frontal lobe.Oh my God Just about everyone in professional contact sports has it.That doesnt make it less scary.Its part of the job, Well, thats a shitty job.Its my life.Oh, God, his skin was too tight, he couldnt hold in what was happening in his chest.The hurricane of grief and anger that bore down on him.He stood, weaved for a moment, and Tara reached out a hand to help him.But he swatted it away.It felt good, really good, a valve release on the pressure, so he picked up the bar of soap on the small sink to his left and hurled it at the wall.It splattered, leaving blue goo everywhere.Holy shit, Luc, what is going on?Tara asked.He kicked the small plastic shelf holding medical supplies and it splintered, flew apart, Ace bandages everywhere.He picked up the case and heaved it against the wall.Blood pounded behind his eyes, his heart hammered in his chest, and there was no outlet for what he felt.He turned and met Tara Jeans eyes, but she didnt flinch.Didnt back away.You want to talk, or throw more stuff?He didnt answer, couldnt, and she pointed to the water bottles in the corner of the room.His heart burning, he hurled them against the door frame with numb hands.Water sprayed the ceiling, across Taras shirt.She sat back down and pulled out her nail file.Go on.Get it out, Luc.He broke a hockey stick, kicked the rolling desk chair, and kicked it again when it rolled back into him.Heaved a phone against the wall, broke the small table the phone sat on, and still he stood there, wanting to tear down the world.Poor Luc, hes got a headache, she sighed into the quiet.My career is over!he howled, coming to stand over her.Her blue eyes met his, unflinching.I cant pass another physical and my contract is up in a year.Billys been traded, every single fighter and thug in the league is gunning for me, and I go down with a tap on the jaw.What kind of career is that?Ill be a laughingstock.A laughingstock with brain damage.Oh my God, can you imagine what my father will say?Your father?He blinked.Blinked again.Swallowed the lump of emotion that felt like grief in his throat.Slowly, the fog fell from his eyes, leaving him alone with a thirty year old anger that embarrassed him.Oh Christ, he muttered.Tell me youre not ruining your future because youre still trying to prove something to your father.His back hit the wall and he slid down to sit on the floor, cradling his poor aching head in his hands.Go away, he sighed, hating that anyone would see him like this, but especially her, whod rejected him at every turn for reasons as fucked up as he was.Of course she didnt go away.She crouched in front of him, her hands on his elbows.He wished he had the strength to shrug off her touch, but his strength had packed up and left with his anger.You told me your father determined your worth, remember?But then you found hockey I remember, he sighed, lifting his head to look at her.You let hockey determine your worth, she said.Youve let it define who you are, just like your father did.He rubbed a hand over his face and then left it over his eyes, wanting to block her out.Wanting to block out the truth.You are more than what your father thought of you.I know No, she said.You dont seem to.Because a thirty seven year old man who has done as much as you have, who has succeeded in a way most people never even dream of, shouldnt worry about what his dead asshole of a father would think of him.He wanted to snarl, to tell her that he didnt give a shit what his father thought of him.That he stopped caring long, long ago.But he was tired of the lies.Tired of pretending that he was better than caring about the old mans opinion.Because he wasnt.He was still that teenager with the speech that had never been delivered.How do I stop?he asked, naked and vulnerable, torn to pieces in a smashed up locker room, looking for help from any quarter.I dont know, she said.Practice?He laughed, tired and sore down to his soul.His eyes burned and his chest ached as though there were thirty years of plans and work, of blood, sweat, and tears, going up in a bonfire inside him.Who am I without hockey?he whispered to the floor, because he hated who he was right now.Hated his reflection in her beautiful eyes.You know what I see when I look at you?she whispered, and he closed his eyes in pain.She cupped his face, ran her fingers over his cheeks, his lips, but still he didnt look at her.I see what you show the world, she said.I see the Ice Man, and the hard work.I see the intelligence and the leadership.But I also see the man who works with those little kids.The man who takes care of his family Her voice broke and he opened his eyes to see her eyes were damp.Tara, he breathed, his hands cupping her shoulders.Dont do this to yourself No, let me finish, she said.I see a man with a vision that most people dont have.Compassion that most people dont have.I see a man with the resources and the heart to do whatever he wants.Look at you.He ruffled her dampened eyelashes.Crying over a broken down hockey player.Im not crying, she protested and they both smiled, the moment encapsulating them, blocking out the world, and it was beautiful.Perfect.This woman with her defenses down, with every scrape and scar revealed, was for him.It would be so easy to love her.I have not been likedmuch, she whispered.And that you would try She shook her head.You are a special man, Luc Baker.And hockey is the least of what you can do.He cupped her shoulder, the heat and softness of her skin burning through his nerves.He wished she would kiss him, and then she did.Soft and tender, her lips, so perfect and sweet, were a benediction.She saw his faults, the weakness in himself he despaired of, and still she kissed him.She opened her mouth, her sweetness pouring out, enveloping him in something he hadnt felt in a long time.Hope.Hope that his future might be brighter than his past.Someone here need an ambulance?a voice said, and Tara pulled away and stood, running her hands down her skirt.Behind her in the doorway was a paramedic, the white sheets of a gurney behind him.Luc lifted himself up off the floor.I dont need an ambulance.Youve had a head injury, the paramedic insisted.You need to come in and get checked out.You could be bleeding internally.Doubt was an avalanche, his desire to linger in ignorance, to pretend that he could be all right at least for the year, but then Tara Jeans hand was there, shoring him up.Pointing him in the right direction.Ill drive him, she said.To the hospital.The doctors.The inevitable CT scan.The slow unraveling of his life as he knew it.Sealing his fate, he nodded.24 Victoria sighed and picked up her purse from beside the seat in the hospital waiting room, where shed been camped out for the better part of the day.Theyre going to keep him overnight, she said to Celeste, who was flipping through a two year old Vogue and looking as fresh and elegant as if she hadnt been sitting around a hospital for five hours.Victoria was a wrinkled paper sack.That smelled bad.Iahbetter get home.Celeste sniffed and Victoria stiffened, reading all sorts of judgment in that sniff.The most judging sniff ever.I dont want to leave Jacob alone with just Ruby.She knew she sounded like a bitch, but she was sick of falling down in a dead faint every time the queen looked down her royal nose.Right.Celeste abruptly put down the magazine.Lets go.You could stick around, Victoria said.Tara Jeans still here Nope.Ill go with you.Great, Victoria thought.Just great.The silence out to the car was the kind that used to make her babble.It used to make her sick with nerves, but now it just made her angry.Victoria, Celeste said, once they were in the truck and heading away from the hospital.The older woman ran her long model fingers over the dash of Lucs truck.I have to ask, whatwhat are your plans?Plans?She merged across two lanes of traffic to get to the exit.For your future.Victoria stepped on the gas, blowing past the speed limit.She could not get home fast enough.If she didnt answer, if she stared out the window and ignored Celeste and the questions she just had to ask, maybe Celeste would get the point.Or perhaps shed disappear.Im worriedabout Jacobs future, Celeste said.Every single instinct in her screamed to kick Celeste out of the car.To pull over to the side of the road and claw at her perfect skin.Instead, she cleared her throat.Well, you dont need to be.The million dollars But what are you going to do?She shrugged.Remarry, I suppose Marriage?Celeste didnt even bother to hide her incredulousness.Her utter laughing disbelief.Thats your solution.Why not?Because men arent a solution, Victoria.They are never, ever a solution.Perhaps not for you Not for anyone.Ever.You cant tell me you were happy.That you actually think another man will make you happier.Oh my goodness, Celeste, what does happy have to do with anything?Everything, I think.Well, most of us arent lucky enough to be you.The silence seethed and she forced herself not to apologize.Not to open her mouth and banish all this discomfort with an act of contrition she didnt mean.She was tired of that.Building every bridge between injured parties with her own two hands.Her own blood, sweat, and tears.For Christs sakeshe was pretty injured too.Who was trying to make her feel better?Celeste shrugged.Do you want to work?Have a job?All I know how to do is shop, go out for lunch, get facials, and redecorate, she said.Can you find a job in there other than wife?You could always go back to school.She hit the turn signal with more force than was necessary.I dont think this is any of your business Youre smart, Victoria, despite your taste in men.Your mother Dont you dare, Victoria breathed, her anger a blowtorch eradicating any thought of a bridge between the two of them.Your mother, Celeste repeated, her voice pitched low, was no example.Victoria snorted, every lesson in manners and grace learned in her life with Joel vanished.You can do better.You should expect better for yourself.For Jacob.Dont you think I want that?The words scorched her throat.It was like standing naked in front of a mirror and pointing at every fault.Dont you think thats the whole point of my life?I do, Celeste said, and Victoria turned stunned eyes to the older woman.I think you are a very good mother.But everyone needs help sometimes, and II would like to help you.With school.Jacob had to miss a lot of school last year, Victoria said, wondering why she was even contemplating this gift.Hell need tutoring Celeste shook her head.For you.Victoria sat silently, tied up in knots she couldnt even begin to unravel.Think about it, Celeste said, awkwardly patting her hand, and then, as if dismissing Victoria, she turned slightly and stared out the window.Why are you doing this?she asked, unable to keep the wonder and pain out of her voice.I feelI feel partly to blamefor the way your father treated you.If I had stayed Victoria could only gape; that Celeste would think that was ridiculous.And it was on the tip of her tongue to tell her so, to relieve her of that burden.But she didnt.With shaking hands, Victoria turned up the radio.Youre on the front page of the Sports section, Tara Jean said, stepping into Lucs hospital room.She tossed the Sunday Dallas Tribune onto the unmade sheets on his hospital bed and he glanced down at the headline: ICE MAN BAKER SUFFERS BRAIN INJURY Thats a bit much, he muttered and didnt bother to read the rest of it.He didnt have the stomach to watch his career go up in newspaper headlines.Adrift from who he was, from the career that had defined him for more than twenty years, he was more than a little numb.Numb, however, didnt come close to his reaction to Tara Jean.He didnt want her here.Shed been relentless in her good cheer.A bright sky of optimism, and all he wanted to do was curl up in a corner and die.Even the way she was dressed was no doubt supposed to elicit some kind of positive reaction: a tight red halter top, a denim skirt that flirted with her knees, and cowboy boots.She looked like a Southern wet dream, and previous to this exact moment he couldnt say it was a look that worked for him.But it did.It really did.That she had no doubt gone to the effort for him pissed him off.Being an object of pity made him sick.Made his ruination even more sour.Why are you here?He couldnt keep the bitterness out of his voice.To take you home.Anyone could do that.Why you?Youyou dont want me here?I dont need your pity, Tara.Or your fucking Florence Nightingale routine.He expected her to flinch, to reel back in pain, because he was a bully and she had lunch money.You want me to show you my boobs?She managed to stun him out of his acrimony.Tara She kicked shut the door and reached behind her to untie the red halter top from around her neck.Her arms, elegant and white, flexed with hidden muscles and his mouth went dry with sudden desire.Her eyes sparkled with Eves knowledge as she peeled the cotton/spandex blend from the tops of her milky breasts, pausing just slightly as the top of her nut brown nipples were revealed.He was a teenager at a peep show.Transfixed.Turned on.Despite himself.She ran her thumb across the front of the fold between her breasts and the fabric.Those nipples went hard.So did he.She pushed the shirt past her breasts, white and perfect.High and round.Youre beautiful, he murmured.She pulled her shirt up and tied it back around her neck.Somehow I dont think you feel better.My career is over, Tara Jean.Its going to take more than a peep show.He felt the bite of despair, of a loss so huge it didnt even register.Hey, hey, Luc She cupped his face, kissed his cheeks.Youre going to be okay.You dont know that, Tara.He grabbed her arms, trying not to squeeze, trying not to hurt her, but the well of pain inside him knew no boundary.I appreciate the efforts, but you really dont have any idea what my life is going to be like.Finally, the unflagging optimism took a hit and she backed away.All right.She crossed her arms over her chest, hiding what shed just flaunted.I get it.You want me to call your mom or Billy?The way he treated her was one more knife to his throat.But he was caught up in this current and didnt have the energy to extricate himself.No, I just want to go home.The cell phone beside his bed buzzed and Tara Jeanwhod stayed until after all the tests had been run last night, filing her nails and telling the nurses who were trying to enforce visiting hours that she was his spiritual guidearched her eyebrows at him when he let it ring.You going to get that?Its my agent.You dont think you should talk to him?Hes only going to tell me that Toronto has dropped my contract and that some headache medicine wants to sign me on as a spokesman.That doesnt interest you?He sighed and pulled on his jeans.Fraid not.Okay.Tara Jean was all business and that suited him, gave him something to rest his anger against.Anyone you need to talk to before we leave?Nope.He picked up his discharge papers and the stuff his sister and mother had brought from home last night.He had an appointment in a few days to come back and talk to the neurologist, and hed already talked to Dr.Matthews back in Toronto.He was going to fly in to consult at the appointment.It was all very neat and tidy.Official.Appointments and meetings.None of it seemed to have anything at all to do with the long, slow scream in his head.Im sorry, Luc, Matthews had said.I cant clear you to play, not for a while.And my opinion is that you are a liability on that ice.Luc had told him it was okay.But the word was like a bubble of oil in his mouth, leaving nothing but grease on his tongue.The end of his career tasted like bad onion rings.The orderly with the wheelchair waited outside the door and Luc tried to protest, but Tara cut him off.Get in, hotshot, she said.Ill drive.He waved at the nurses at the desk; hed signed all their husbands and sons and fathers autographs and hed been repaid in extra breakfasts.Even a private stock of chocolate chip cookies.And they had let Tara Jean hang out long past visiting hours despite her spiritual advisor nonsense.Another orderly stopped him in front of the regular exit.There are a lot of reporters out there, the man said.Tara Jean stopped pushing him.You want to deal with that right now?No, Luc answered.One of Becketts messages, one of the more frantic ones, had told Luc not to talk to reporters until he and Beckett could come up with a statement.Hed hold off on talking to any reporters.Have you remembered what happened?she asked, wheeling him through white brightly lit hallways.Not yet.No matter how hard he tried to pull up the memories of the hit, all he recalled was talking to Billy before starting the workout with Tyler.And fear ate him, fear that more memories would get snatched away by this concussion until he was walking outside his house wondering where he lived.Did you see it?he asked.Not all of it.She stopped pushing the chair and stepped around to face him, her eyes like ice picks.Dennis was there.What?His funk was blown apart and it felt good to be mad, so he fed that particular fire until his body was alive with something other than self pity.Did you call the cops?I got a little distracted, Luc.He took the hit in stride.What did he say?That he wants the money.I hope you told him to go to hell.Part of him worried that despite severing her connection to her past, she might get sucked in by Dennis.Of course I did.But he also said you have some investigator on him, asking questions.The censure in her eyes put a slight dent in his righteousness, but he met her head on, refusing to apologize for doing the right thing by his family.God, Luc, I told you not to do that.I told you I know what you told me.But its my family, Tara.I cant sit back and do nothing.She turned away and he heard her swearing at him under her breath, and he would rather have this woman, with all her vulgar fire, than the sweet nurse shed been the last twenty four hours.She started to push him again with a jerk and his head snapped back.Do it your way, but if this blows up in your face its on you.Of course it is.Listen to you, tough guy.You have no idea who youre dealing with.She pushed him through the last door into the sun splashed parking lot and he stood up.The world was the same, much to his chagrin.It wasnt as if he expected anything different, but with his life so in ruins, the bright, sunny Texas morning seemed like a cruel cherry on top of his crap sundae.Would a little rain to match his mood be too much to ask?Here.Tara handed him sunglasses and put on her own.Youre going to need these.25 Luc was being a baby.She didnt know who he thought he was kidding, sitting in the passenger seat of the SUV cloaked in his indifference.His cool control.While at the same time he was throwing off so much sadness, she was fighting back tears.Tears she blinked away.Pity, she knew, would not go down well with the Ice Man.That little show at the hospital, telling her he didnt want her there, stung.But she understood.Weeks ago, that had been her.Hurting him just because he was there and he was trying to see behind the mask she was determined to keep on.She couldnt look at this manholding on so hard to his control it was cracking in his handsand not see the man with tears in his eyes in that destroyed locker room.And he probably thought the same when he looked at her.It was as if all that ice the Ice Man surrounded himself in had thawed and she saw the collection of fears and misgivings, all the human foibles and dreams held together with chicken wire and masking tape.And he was all the more beautiful because of it.Not that hed see that.Not now, maybe not ever.And he was feeling really shitty right now.Which was almost enough to make her forgive the childish behavior, but she was no mans doormat.And considering that twenty four hours ago she had been ready to go to bed with himand she still wanted toshed need an apology of some kind if he thought he was ever going to see down her shirt again.Her spine popped straight.Listen to me, she thought, surprised by this new feminine strength and proud of it.Once upon a time she would have slept with him just so hed apologize.Im sorry, Luc said as if hed read her mind.She turned and met his sad eyes.For in the hospital.I was mean.You were.But Ive thrown a few fits in my life.You dont scare me.Still.Im sorry.He touched her hand, curled his finger over hers.I liked seeing your boobs.Im glad it was you picking me up.Im gladIm glad youre here.As far as apologies went, it was world class.For her, anyway.Thank you, she whispered, and he lifted her hand, kissing her knuckles.Charming, even in his grief.Oh, what the hell?she thought.In her experience there was one surefire way to make a sad man feel better.Time to get naked.She got them off the interstate, onto the two lane highway leading to the ranch, and then took the first gravel road on the left.Two hundred meters in the distance there was a left turn down a dirt road that dipped behind the hills.She punched the gas and took the corner so fast gravel spit up behind them.Luc grabbed onto the handle above the door.What are you doing?Dust flew up around them as she barreled down the road, stones pinging off the windshield.Are you going to kill us?She stopped the car under the long branches of a roadside willow.The silence and the shadow were the perfect cocoon.She turned off the car and turned to him.Their connection was intense.Dizzying.As if somehow she could see the ribbons that tied them, that curled around them in an endless figure eight she didnt understand but she could no longer outrun.Im not going to kill you, she whispered.Im going to fuck you.He lunged across the seat, sealing her lips with his.Hot and warm, she melted against him.It took her a second to unbuckle her seat belt and crawl into his lap, where his heat, the living presence of him, made her sigh with pleasure.She banished the demon trying to tell her what to do and went with her heart.And her heart told her to put her arms around this man for as long as she could.He reached beside him and hit the lever to lower the back of his seat and she leaned back.Youve done this before?Never, he said.Come on, a quickie in a car?Thisquickies in a car only happen if youre out of control.And youre never out of control?Her stomach turned over, like she was on The Zipper at the State Fair when she was a kid.Theres something about you, Tara Jean That makes you want to get naked in a car.That makes me want to get you naked in a car.Naked.He kissed her lips, a nip that made her gasp.Hot.He sucked on that spot on her neck as if he had a secret map to the places that made her crazy.And wet.She shifted her legs so she was straddling him.Her skirt stopped her from getting close to him, so she wiggled, trying to hike it up past her hips.Luc helped.His big hands, warm and callused, slid up her legs pushing up her skirt, revealing the bright blue cotton bikini underwear she wore with the smiley face on the crotch.Cute, he murmured, his breath fanning her neck, sending goose bumps down her arms and across her back.He smelled like coffee and toothpaste.With the skirt out of the way, she pressed herself into his lap, gasping when that smiley face met the erection growing under his jeans.Looking into his eyes, she saw the sadness cut away with a knife and she circled her hips, teasing him.Teasing her.Making that smiley face very happy.His hands slid up under her halter top, across the trembling taut skin of her belly.Her nipples hurt with anticipation; hard and painful, they waited for his touch.Slowly, his palms cupped the undersides of her breasts and her eyes fluttered shut.Breathless, she leaned against himalive where he was touching her, cold where he wasnt.She leaned down and put her lips to his neck, bumping her head on the window.Her hips popped away from his, cool air blowing between them, and she moaned in protest, trying to scoot closer.He braced his foot on the floorboards, hitting his knee against the dash.They laughed into each others skin.It had been a long time since shed made out in a car, and shed forgotten the pleasures of confined places.The bliss of extra close proximity.She leaned back, putting her hand against the roof of the car for leverage.His face was dark, the skin nearly red, his lips white from the force applied by his teeth.His eyes met hers, and for a moment it was the kitchen all over again and what she saw in his eyes was too much.His emotion and need contributed to hers, and the combined weight was going to sink the good ship dry hump.Closing her eyes seemed the best optionto keep the good times going, to keep her from freaking out again.Dont count on me past this, dont expect more.Because there is nothing in me to give you.Nothing lasting.Nothing real.He was seeing things that werent there.She was empty.Ruined where it mattered a long, long time ago.Panic cut through the desire.Hes lost his career, she told herself.And he was grabbing onto her with both hands because she was there.He was going to try to make more out of this than there was.Tara?Whats wrong?Its just sex, she told him.His hips stopped.Smiley face would have frowned had it been able.Instead ofwhat?A pony?Im just saying She stroked his cheek, trying to take the sting out of her words.Youre a man at a crossroads, Luc.And Im a diversion, nothing to hold onto.His chuckle was hot and dangerous, and the temperature in her core climbed.His hands cupped her breasts, his fingers surveying the curves, circling the nipples.She waited for the stroke of his thumb, but instead he pulled her closer and she got the wet heat of his tongue through her shirt as he sucked her into his mouth.She cried out, cupping the back of his head, grinding against him as he used his teeth against her.Pleasure curled and the hot, bright edge of it was pain.He left that breast, the nipple cold in the damp fabric, to find her other one and his mouth through the fabric was sexy and dirty, but it wasnt what she wanted and she clawed off her shirt, tossing it onto the drivers side seat.Im not going to argue with you now, he muttered.Lets just agree to disagree.He cupped her breasts, cradling the weight, kissing and licking the soft and sensitive flesh until honestly she thought shed go mad with it.She caught the hem of his shirt and pulled it up, revealing the hard muscles, the soft skin.The fine hair under his arms made her crazy.The dip of muscle to ligament, ligament to bone, and the gorgeous skin that blanketed it all was perfection.Exactly as it should be.He was an anatomy textbook brought to life.She kissed his shoulder, traced his bicep, found the ridge of whatever muscle it was on his back that made him look so wide.So strong.A shield she could hide behind.This isnt some kind of pity fuck, is it?he asked, and she leaned back to stare into his earnest face.Poor Luc, hes lost his career?Slowly, she shook her head.I feel bad for you, Luc.But I would never pity you.She could see he didnt totally believe her, that it would take years before he believed that no one was pitying him.Truth be told, Luc, men who cry and throw shitits a big turn on.His laughter was bright and relieved and his kiss tasted sweet.Like gratitude.But his fingers, nimble and clever, slid up her legs to the happy face.He petted her through the fabric until she knew she was so wet he could feel it.He dipped a finger beneath the elastic and she gasped, curling against him, holding onto the pleasure as hard as she could.He teased, traced the edges of her sex, sliding past her clitoris, leaving her breathless.Grinding against him, chasing that finger down as best she could, she whimpered in frustration.Oh God, Tara, you kill me.His hands slid under her butt and with a shrug of his shoulders, he practically threw her into the roomy backseat of the SUV.She turned, flipping her hair out of her face, only to see him crawling after her, his face dark, his intent clear.If she werent so sick with lust, so mad with affection, she might have popped open the door and run, just so he could catch her.A game.To keep them both safe.Their emotions locked behind flirtation and subterfuge.But she was dying for him, and the only thing she could do was lie back and open her arms.He licked a hot path up her belly, back to her breasts, murmuring all the while dark and wicked things that made her blush and squirm.I want to taste you, he said, sucking on her lips, nipping at her tongue.He started to backtrack, taking side roads across her cheeks, to her ears, down to that hot spot on her neck, but she stopped him.Me first, she murmured, sliding awkwardly against the leather, her skin sticking.He lay down, filling the space she had vacated, and she started her own National Geographic tour of his landscape.Youre so beautiful, she murmured against his chest, licking his nipple, tugging at the button on his jeans.She stroked the skin of his stomach and sides with both hands spread wide, trying to touch as much of him as she could.His hands captured hers, pulling them over his chest, right over the beat of his heart.Looking up, she found his eyes burning and she couldnt look away.She licked his belly, tugged free one of her hands, and cupped his erection, opening her mouth to blow hot air over the fabric.He bared his teeth, lifted his hips, and the air in the truck was a bonfire of sweat and need and sex.As she pulled down his black boxer briefs, the column of his erection sprang free, muscular and masculine in the extreme.She licked him, base to tip, staring into his eyes, feeling the best kind of dirty.His heart pounded under her palm and against her lips and she felt so very much a part of his existence at this moment.No matter what happened between them, she knew that this moment was theirs.And they were as much a part of each other as any two people could be.Tears burning behind her eyes, she broke eye contact and focused her attention on what lay beneath her lips.He growled, his hands fisting in her hair, and she didnt know how she could be so turned on without being touched, but she was.She was hot and ready.Cupping him with both hands, she took as much as she could into her mouth and found a pace that had him sweating and arching against her.No more, he finally muttered, pulling her away.She held on as long as she could, the length of him slipping out of her mouth with a delicious pop.Hauling her up his body, her weight nothing to all that overt strength, he ravished her mouth, split her wide open, and swallowed her whole.Condom, she said.Not yet.Lifting her even farther, she realized what he was doing and she braced one foot in the foot well and one hand against the window, desperate for relief.Scooting down the bench seat, he pulled down her underwear.She shifted to help him take it off, but then he just grabbed Mr.Happy Face and tore him, right down the seam.She shuddered with pleasure and then screamed when his lips found hers.He licked, sucked, bit once and then again.And she shook, riding his face while he squeezed and palmed her hips.The temptation to close her eyes and just let this happen, just let him please her, was intenseall consuming.It would be so easy, but she wasnt doing this because it was easy.She was in the backseat of this truck with him because it was hard.It took more courage than she thought she had.She jerked away from him, slipping down his body.I want Looking into his eyes, she felt a little foolish.I want to do this with you.His lips, shiny and slick, split into that crooked grin that broke her heart and sent it soaring at the same time.Lifting his hips to dig into his hip pocket, his erection brushed the electrified nerve endings between her legs and she couldnt help arching into him, making him groan and fumble with the condom he pulled from his back pocket.I thought you didnt do this sort of thing, she said, staring down at him from where she sat on top of his hips.I didnt say I wasnt hopeful.It was sweet and endearing and she couldnt help but laugh, giggle even, from her place of power on top of his crotch.He laughed too and suddenly, the mood in the hot, sweaty confines of the SUV changed; lusts predictable and sharp edge became soft and wholly foreign.Hey, he murmured, cupping her cheek.Stay with me.Im with you, she said, taking the condom from him.She tore the wrapper open with her teeth and his chuckle forced them into bobbing and shaking contact again.She stood slightly, rolling the condom over him, and for a moment she allowed herself to believe that when this was over, when theyd worked out this ill fated passion against each others rocky shores, she could walk away.But that was a lie.Holding him in one hand, she braced herself against his chest and slowly, as slowly as if he were performing hara kiri, he speared her, split her.She gasped and cried out.He groaned and pulled her down against him in terrible, wicked increments until she was seated fully on him.Shed never felt this way, so cherished and endangered at the same time, and her heart fell into rhythm with her body.I could love him, she thought, climbing up and up and up.I probably already do.26 As soon as the truck pulled to a stop, the front door of the ranch opened and the women in his family came running out.He was suddenly adrift again.Lost without the anchor of who he was to himself, he had no idea who he was supposed to be to these people.Who was he if he wasnt Victorias hockey playing brother?Celestes famous son?Can we go back to that tree?he asked.Tara Jeans hand cupped his, and he grabbed it as fast and as hard as he could.Theyre worried about you, she said.And they love you.I know, he sighed.Gotta face them sometime.She put her hand on the door and he stopped her.You need to call the cops.Tell them about Dennis.She nodded.I will, right now.Her eyes dropped to his lips, but she turned away, probably intimidated by his family glaring at them outside the window.But he wasnt easily intimidated and he touched her chin, tipping her lips back to his.Thank you, he breathed across her mouth.My pleasure.She kissed him back and then threw open her door, like the gates of hell.He had no choice but to open his own door and watch her walk across the parking area toward her workshop.Leaving him to face the dragons alone.What the hell is going on?Celeste asked.Waving a folded up newspaper, she stepped down from the verandah.The Toronto Star is saying you have some kind of brain damage!Victoria said, her arms crossed over her chest.Im fine, he said.Youve been saying that for two months, Luc.And youre not fine!Victorias rage gave her some weight, and maybe it was because hed just been screwed silly, but he was happy to see her so animated.You wont play again, Celeste said, and it wasnt a question.It was the truth, black and yawning under his feet, and his head spun in panic.The comfort and bliss hed found in Taras arms vanished as if theyd never existed and he was stumbling along in his own ruin.Ruby stood on the porch.A man named Beckett Jones has called for you.About eighty times.You, Victoria practically seethed, need to give us some answers.So.This was it.The reckoning.Wheres Billy Here, Billy said from behind him, and Luc turned to find him, sweaty and wiping his face off with a towel, obviously just coming back from a workout.At the sight of his old friend, the anger came back.All that hed lost was right there in his friends beaten and battered face.And I think I speak for the whole league when I say: Fuck you, Luc.Excuse my French, he mumbled to Celeste and Victoria.Im sorry I didnt tell you So why dont you tell us now, Celeste said.All of it.Knowing he was beat, Luc nodded and launched into the sad story of a boy with the possibility of a brain eating protein.Brain eating?Victoria cried.Possibility, he clarified.I cant believe that you were still going to play.That Billy managed to be sanctimonious was a marvel.That you would risk the rest of your life for one more year of hockey.This from the man with more hospital visits than anyone else in the league?Its not my brain, Luc!You mock those NFL guys who cant remember where they live, but you were going to join them!Lucs anger subsided, sucked down by the pinprick of shame brought on by his own blind stupidity.This, too, was the truth.Hed brought this on himself.I know, he said.But its not like anything is definite The headaches are definite, Billy snapped, and Luc nodded in reluctant agreement.And Ill bet you dont remember half the hits youve taken that resulted in blackouts.Or even the hits that didnt result in blackouts.He wished he could blunt the truth, for his familys sake.But hed hidden enough from them, and it was a bad time to realize that hed done this not just to himself, but to them, too.No, Luc agreed, and his mothers soft gasp tore through his belly.Youre right.I dont remember.I was traded, man.Billys soft voice was at odds with the blunt hammer of his face.What did you think was going to happen next year?The league I was trying to get faster.Even as the words came out of his mouth, he knew it was stupid.Stronger.Better.Youre thirty seven.Lashenko is twenty four.Were depreciating every day, Luc.Well, it doesnt matter now.Im out.Theyll drop my contract What if they dont?Its not like the league is known for taking care of their players.If youre selling tickets, theyll find a way to keep you around.They let Lindros play till he could barely stay on his feet.He wondered, suddenly, how Lindros was doing.If he had memory loss and cognitive lapses, all the things Matthews said would happen to him if he kept getting knocked out.Luc glanced over at his mother and sister, standing there like worried birds, wringing their hands over his future.Either way, Im out, Luc said.And frankly, itsits a relief.My body is tired, my head is tired, and Im tired of keeping Gates away from the strippers.Billy smiled, and he felt his mother cup her hand around his elbow.Thats smart, Billy said.First smart thing youve done in a long time.What are you going to do?Celeste asked.Luc looked around, at the sun, the ugly house, the rolling hills past it.Tara Jean somewhere, close enough that he could go and find her, wrap his arms around her if he wanted.And he wanted.To fulfill the obligation of the will, I have to stick around for another few months.I can lay low here.See what happens.See what happens with Tara Jean, you mean?
