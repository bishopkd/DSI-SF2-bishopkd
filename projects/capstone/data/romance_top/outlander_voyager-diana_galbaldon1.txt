 When I was small, I never wanted to step in puddles.Not because of any fear of drowned worms or wet stockings; I was by and large a grubby child, with a blissful disregard for filth of any kind.It was because I couldnt bring myself to believe that that perfect smooth expanse was no more than a thin film of water over solid earth.I believed it was an opening into some fathomless space.Sometimes, seeing the tiny ripples caused by my approach, I thought the puddle impossibly deep, a bottomless sea in which the lazy coil of tentacle and gleam of scale lay hidden, with the threat of huge bodies and sharp teeth adrift and silent in the far down depths.And then, looking down into reflection, I would see my own round face and frizzled hair against a featureless blue sweep, and think instead that the puddle was the entrance to another sky.If I stepped in there, I would drop at once, and keep on falling, on and on, into blue space.The only time I would dare to walk through a puddle was at twilight, when the evening stars came out.If I looked in the water and saw one lighted pinprick there, I could splash through unafraidfor if I should fall into the puddle and on into space, I could grab hold of the star as I passed, and be safe.Even now, when I see a puddle in my path, my mind half haltsthough my feet do notthen hurries on, with only the echo of the thought left behind.What if, this time, you fall?PART ONE    Battle, and the Loves of Men   1  THE CORBIES FEAST  Many a Highland chieftain fought,  Many a gallant man did fall.Death itself were dearly bought,  All for Scotlands King and law.Will Ye No Come Back Again  April 16, 1746  He was dead.However, his nose throbbed painfully, which he thought odd in the circumstances.While he placed considerable trust in the understanding and mercy of his Creator, he harbored that residue of elemental guilt that made all men fear the chance of hell.Still, all he had ever heard of hell made him think it unlikely that the torments reserved for its luckless inhabitants could be restricted to a sore nose.On the other hand, this couldnt be heaven, on several counts.For one, he didnt deserve it.For another, it didnt look it.And for a third, he doubted that the rewards of the blessed included a broken nose, any more than those of the damned.While he had always thought of Purgatory as a gray sort of place, the faint reddish light that hid everything around him seemed suitable.His mind was clearing a bit, and his power to reason was coming back, if slowly.Someone, he thought rather crossly, ought to see him and tell him just what the sentence was, until he should have suffered enough to be purified, and at last to enter the Kingdom of God.Whether he was expecting a demon or an angel was uncertain.He had no idea of the staffing requirements of Purgatory; it wasnt a matter the dominie had addressed in his schooldays.While waiting, he began to take stock of whatever other torments he might be required to endure.There were numerous cuts, gashes, and bruises here and there, and he was fairly sure hed broken the fourth finger of his right hand againdifficult to protect it, the way it stuck out so stiff, with the joint frozen.None of that was too bad, though.What else?Claire.The name knifed across his heart with a pain that was more racking than anything his body had ever been called on to withstand.If he had had an actual body anymore, he was sure it would have doubled up in agony.He had known it would be like this, when he sent her back to the stone circle.Spiritual anguish could be taken as a standard condition in Purgatory, and he had expected all along that the pain of separation would be his chief punishmentsufficient, he thought, to atone for anything hed ever done: murder and betrayal included.He did not know whether persons in Purgatory were allowed to pray or not, but tried anyway.Lord, he prayed, that she may be safe.She and the child.He was sure she would have made it to the circle itself; only two months gone with child, she was still light and fleet of footand the most stubbornly determined woman he had ever met.But whether she had managed the dangerous transition back to the place from which she had comesliding precariously through whatever mysterious layers lay between then and now, powerless in the grip of the rockthat he could never know, and the thought of it was enough to make him forget even the throbbing in his nose.He resumed his interrupted inventory of bodily ills, and became inordinately distressed at the discovery that his left leg appeared to be missing.Sensation stopped at the hip, with a sort of pins and needles tingling at the joint.Presumably he would get it back in due time, either when he finally arrived in Heaven, or at the least, at Judgment Day.And after all, his brother in law Ian managed very well on the wooden peg he wore to replace his missing leg.Still, his vanity was troubled.Ah, that must be it; a punishment meant to cure him of the sin of vanity.He mentally set his teeth, determined to accept whatever came to him with fortitude, and such humility as he could manage.Still, he couldnt help reaching an exploratory hand (or whatever he was using for a hand) tentatively downward, to see just where the limb now ended.The hand struck something hard, and the fingers tangled in wet, snarled hair.He sat up abruptly, and with some effort, cracked the layer of dried blood that had sealed his eyelids shut.Memory flooded back, and he groaned aloud.He had been mistaken.This was hell.But James Fraser was unfortunately not dead, after all.The body of a man lay across his own.Its dead weight crushed his left leg, explaining the absence of feeling.The head, heavy as a spent cannonball, pressed facedown into his abdomen, the damp matted hair a dark spill on the wet linen of his shirt.He jerked upward in sudden panic; the head rolled sideways into his lap and a half open eye stared sightlessly up behind the sheltering strands of hair.It was Jack Randall, his fine red captains coat so dark with the wet it looked almost black.Jamie made a fumbling effort to push the body away, but found himself amazingly weak; his hand splayed feebly against Randalls shoulder, and the elbow of his other arm buckled suddenly as he tried to support himself.He found himself lying once more flat on his back, the sleeting sky pale gray and whirling dizzily overhead.Jack Randalls head moved obscenely up and down on his stomach with each gasping breath.He pressed his hands flat against the boggy groundthe water rose up cold through his fingers and soaked the back of his shirtand wriggled sideways.Some warmth was trapped between them; as the limp dead weight slid slowly free, the freezing rain struck his newly exposed flesh with a shock like a blow, and he shivered violently with sudden chill.As he squirmed on the ground, struggling with the crumpled, mudstained folds of his plaid, he could hear sounds above the keening of the April wind; far off shouts and a moaning and wailing, like the calling of ghosts in the wind.And overall, the raucous calling of crows.Dozens of crows, from the sound.That was strange, he thought dimly.Birds shouldnt fly in a storm like this.A final heave freed the plaid from under him, and he fumbled it over his body.As he reached to cover his legs, he saw that his kilt and left leg were soaked with blood.The sight didnt distress him; it seemed only vaguely interesting, the dark red smears a contrast to the grayish green of the moor plants around him.The echoes of battle faded from his ears, and he left Culloden Field to the calling of the crows.He was wakened much later by the calling of his name.Fraser!Jamie Fraser!Are ye here?No, he thought groggily.Im not.Wherever he had been while unconscious, it was a better place than this.He lay in a small declivity, half filled with water.The sleeting rain had stopped, but the wind hadnt; it whined over the moor, piercing and chilling.The sky had darkened nearly to black; it must be near evening, then.I saw him go down here, I tell ye.Right near a big clump of gorse.The voice was at a distance, fading as it argued with someone.There was a rustle near his ear, and he turned his head to see the crow.It stood on the grass a foot away, a blotch of wind ruffled black feathers, regarding him with a bead bright eye.Deciding that he posed no threat, it swiveled its neck with casual ease and jabbed its thick sharp bill into Jack Randalls eye.Jamie jerked up with a cry of revulsion and a flurry of movement that sent the crow flapping off, squawking with alarm.Ay!Over there!There was a squelching through boggy ground, and a face before him, and the welcome feel of a hand on his shoulder.Hes alive!Come on, MacDonald!Dye lend a hand here; hell no be walkin on his own.There were four of them, and with a good deal of effort, they got him up, arms draped helpless about the shoulders of Ewan Cameron and Iain MacKinnon.He wanted to tell them to leave him; his purpose had returned to him with the waking, and he remembered that he had meant to die.But the sweetness of their company was too much to resist.The rest had restored the feeling in his dead leg, and he knew the seriousness of the wound.He would die soon in any case; thank God that it need not be alone, in the dark.Water?The edge of the cup pressed against his lip, and he roused himself long enough to drink, careful not to spill it.A hand pressed briefly against his forehead and dropped away without comment.He was burning; he could feel the flames behind his eyes when he closed them.His lips were cracked and sore from the heat, but it was better than the chills that came at intervals.At least when he was fevered, he could lie still; the shaking of the chills woke the sleeping demons in his leg.Murtagh.He had a terrible feeling about his godfather, but no memory to give it shape.Murtagh was dead; he knew that must be it, but didnt know why or how he knew.A good half of the Highland army was dead, slaughtered on the moorso much he had gathered from the talk of the men in the farmhouse, but he had no memory of the battle himself.He had fought with armies before, and knew such loss of memory was not uncommon in soldiers; he had seen it, though never before suffered it himself.He knew the memories would come back, and hoped he would be dead before they did.He shifted at the thought, and the movement sent a jolt of white hot pain through his leg that made him groan.All right, Jamie?Ewan rose on one elbow next to him, worried face wan in the dawning light.A bloodstained bandage circled his head, and there were rusty stains on his collar, from the scalp wound left by a bullets graze.Aye, Ill do.He reached up a hand and touched Ewans shoulder in gratitude.Ewan patted it, and lay back down.The crows were back.Black as night themselves, they had gone to roost with the darkness, but with the dawn they were backbirds of war, the corbies had come to feast on the flesh of the fallen.It could as well be his own eyes the cruel beaks picked out, he thought.He could feel the shape of his eyeballs beneath his lids, round and hot, tasty bits of jelly rolling restless to and fro, looking vainly for oblivion, while the rising sun turned his lids a dark and bloody red.Four of the men were gathered near the single window of the farmhouse, talking quietly together.Make a run for it?one said, with a nod outside.Christ, man, the best of us can barely staggerand theres six at least canna walk at all.If ye can go, be going, said a man from the floor.He grimaced toward his own leg, wrapped in the remains of a tattered quilt.Dinna linger on our account.Duncan MacDonald turned from the window with a grim smile, shaking his head.The windows light shone off the rough planes of his face, deepening the lines of fatigue.Nay, well bide, he said.For one thing, the English are thick as lice on the ground; ye can see them swarm from the window.Theres no man would get away whole from Drumossie now.Even those that fled the field yesterday will no get far, MacKinnon put in softly.Did ye no hear the English troops passing in the night at the quick march?Dye think it will be hard for them to hunt down our ragtag lot?There was no response to this; all of them knew the answer too well.Many of the Highlanders had been barely able to stand on the field before the battle, weakened as they were by cold, fatigue, and hunger.Jamie turned his face to the wall, praying that his men had started early enough.Lallybroch was remote; if they could get far enough from Culloden, it was unlikely they would be caught.And yet Claire had told him that Cumberlands troops would ravage the Highlands, ranging far afield in their thirst for revenge.The thought of her this time caused only a wave of terrible longing.God, to have her here, to lay her hands on him, to tend his wounds and cradle his head in her lap.But she was gonegone away two hundred years from himand thank the Lord that she was!Tears trickled slowly from under his closed lids, and he rolled painfully onto his side, to hide them from the others.Lord, that she might be safe, he prayed.She and the child.Toward midafternoon, the smell of burning came suddenly on the air, wafting through the glassless window.It was thicker than the smell of blackpowder smoke, pungent, with an underlying odor that was faintly horrible in its reminiscent smell of roasting meat.They are burning the dead, said MacDonald.He had scarcely moved from his seat by the window in all the time they had been in the cottage.He looked like a deaths head himself, hair coal black and matted with dirt, scraped back from a face in which every bone showed.Here and there, a small, flat crack sounded on the moor.Gunshots.The coups de grace, administered by those English officers with a sense of compassion, before a tartan clad wretch should be stacked on the pyre with his luckier fellows.When Jamie looked up, Duncan MacDonald still sat by the window, but his eyes were closed.Next to him, Ewan Cameron crossed himself.May we find as much mercy, he whispered.They did.It was just past noon on the second day when booted feet at last approached the farmhouse, and the door swung open on silent leather hinges.Christ.It was a muttered exclamation at the sight within the farmhouse.The draft from the door stirred the fetid air over grimed, bedraggled, bloodstained bodies that lay or sat huddled on the packed dirt floor.There had been no discussion of the possibility of armed resistance; they had no heart and there was no point.The Jacobites simply sat, waiting the pleasure of their visitor.He was a major, all fresh and new in an uncreased uniform, with polished boots.After a moments hesitation to survey the inhabitants, he stepped inside, his lieutenant close behind.I am Lord Melton, he said, glancing around as though seeking the leader of these men, to whom his remarks might most properly be addressed.Duncan MacDonald, after a glance of his own, stood slowly, and inclined his head.Duncan MacDonald, of Glen Richie, he said.And othershe waved a handlate of the forces of His Majesty, King James.So I surmised, the Englishman said dryly.He was young, in his early thirties, but he carried himself with a seasoned soldiers confidence.He looked deliberately from man to man, then reached into his coat and produced a folded sheet of paper.I have here an order from His Grace, the Duke of Cumberland, he said.Authorizing the immediate execution of any man found to have engaged in the treasonous rebellion just past.He glanced around the confines of the cottage once more.Is there any man here who claims innocence of treason?There was the faintest breath of laughter from the Scots.Innocence, with the smoke of battle still black on their faces, here on the edge of the slaughter field?No, my lord, said MacDonald, the faintest of smiles on his lips.Traitors all.Shall we be hanged, then?Meltons face twitched in a small grimace of distaste, then settled back into impassivity.He was a slight man, with small, fine bones, but carried his authority well, nonetheless.You will be shot, he said.You have an hour, in which to prepare yourselves.He hesitated, shooting a glance at his lieutenant, as though afraid to sound overgenerous before his subordinate, but continued.If any of you wish writing materialsto compose a letter, perhapsthe clerk of my company will attend you.He nodded briefly to MacDonald, turned on his heel, and left.It was a grim hour.A few men availed themselves of the offer of pen and ink, and scribbled doggedly, paper held against the slanted wooden chimney for lack of another firm writing surface.Others prayed quietly, or simply sat, waiting.MacDonald had begged mercy for Giles McMartin and Frederick Murray, arguing that they were barely seventeen, and should not be held to the same account as their elders.This request was denied, and the boys sat together, white faced against the wall, holding each others hands.For them, Jamie felt a piercing sorrowand for the others here, loyal friends and gallant soldiers.For himself, he felt only relief.No more to worry, nothing more to do.He had done all he could for his men, his wife, his unborn child.Now let this bodily misery be ended, and he would go grateful for the peace of it.More for forms sake than because he felt the need of it, he closed his eyes and began the Act of Contrition, in French, as he always said it.Mon Dieu, je regretteAnd yet he didnt; it was much too late for any sort of regret.Would he find Claire at once when he died, he wondered?Or perhaps, as he expected, be condemned to separation for a time?In any case, he would see her again; he clung to the conviction much more firmly than he embraced the tenets of the Church.God had given her to him; He would restore her.Forgetting to pray, he instead began to conjure her face behind his eyelids, the curve of cheek and temple, a broad fair brow that always moved him to kiss it, just there, in that small smooth spot between her eyebrows, just at the top of her nose, between clear amber eyes.He fixed his attention on the shape of her mouth, carefully imagining the full, sweet curve of it, and the taste and the feel and the joy of it.The sounds of praying, the pen scratching and the small, choked sobs of Giles McMartin faded from his ears.It was midafternoon when Melton returned, this time with six soldiers in attendance, as well as the Lieutenant and the clerk.Again, he paused in the doorway, but MacDonald rose before he could speak.Ill go first, he said, and walked steadily across the cottage.As he bent his head to go through the door, though, Lord Melton laid a hand on his sleeve.Will you give your full name, sir?My clerk will make note of it.MacDonald glanced at the clerk, a small bitter smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.A trophy list, is it?Aye, well.He shrugged and drew himself upright.Duncan William MacLeod MacDonald, of Glen Richie.He bowed politely to Lord Melton.At your servicesir.He passed through the door, and shortly there came the sound of a single pistol shot from near at hand.The boys were allowed to go together, hands still clutched tightly as they passed through the door.The rest were taken one by one, each asked for his name, that the clerk might make a record of it.The clerk sat on a stool by the door, head bent to the papers in his lap, not looking up as the men passed by.When it came Ewans turn, Jamie struggled to prop himself on his elbows, and grasped his friends hand, as hard as he could.I shall see ye soon again, he whispered.Ewans hand shook in his, but the Cameron only smiled.Then he leaned across simply and kissed Jamies mouth, and rose to go.They left the six who could not walk to the last.James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser, he said, speaking slowly to allow the clerk time to get it down right.Laird of Broch Tuarach.Patiently, he spelled it, then glanced up at Melton.I must ask your courtesy, my lord, to give me help to stand.Melton didnt answer him, but stared down at him, his expression of remote distaste altering to one of mingled astonishment and something like dawning horror.Fraser?he said.Of Broch Tuarach?I am, Jamie said patiently.Would the man not hurry a bit?Being resigned to being shot was one thing, but listening to your friends being killed in your hearing was another, and not just calculated to settle the nerves.His arms were trembling with the strain of propping him, and his bowels, not sharing the resignation of his higher faculties, were twitching with a gurgling dread.Bloody hell, the Englishman muttered.He bent and peered at Jamie where he lay in the shadow of the wall, then turned and beckoned to his lieutenant.Help me get him into the light, he ordered.They werent gentle about it, and Jamie grunted as the movement sent a bolt of pain from his leg right up through the top of his head.It made him dizzy for a moment, and he missed what Melton was saying to him.Are you the Jacobite they call Red Jamie?he asked again, impatiently.A streak of fear went through Jamie at that; let them know he was the notorious Red Jamie, and they wouldnt shoot him.Theyd take him in chains to London to be trieda prize of war.And after that, it would be the hangmans rope, and lying half strangled on the gallows platform while they slit his belly and ripped out his bowels.His bowels gave another long, rumbling gurgle; they didnt think much of the notion either.No, he said, with as much firmness as he could manage.Just get on wi it, eh?Ignoring this, Melton dropped to his knees, and ripped open the throat of Jamies shirt.He gripped Jamies hair and jerked back his head.Damn!Melton said.Meltons finger prodded him in the throat, just above the collarbone.There was a small triangular scar there, and this appeared to be what was causing his interrogators concern.James Fraser of Broch Tuarach; red hair and a three cornered scar on his throat.Melton let go of the hair and sat back on his heels, rubbing his chin in a distracted sort of way.Then he pulled himself together and turned to the lieutenant, gesturing at the five men remaining in the farm cottage.Take the rest, he ordered.His fair brows were knitted together in a deep frown.He stood over Jamie, scowling, while the other Scottish prisoners were removed.I have to think, he muttered.Damme, I must think!Do that, said Jamie, if youre able.I must lie down, myself.They had propped him sitting against the far wall, his leg stretched out in front of him, but sitting upright after two days of lying flat was more than he could manage; the room was tilting drunkenly, and small flashing lights kept coming before his eyes.He leaned to one side, and eased himself down, hugging the dirt floor, eyes closed as he waited for the dizziness to pass.Melton was muttering under his breath, but Jamie couldnt make out the words; didnt care greatly in any case.Sitting up in the sunlight, he had seen his leg clearly for the first time, and he was fairly sure that he wouldnt live long enough to be hanged.The deep angry red of inflammation spread from midthigh upward, much brighter than the remaining smears of dried blood.The wound itself was purulent; with the stench of the other men lessening, he could smell the faint sweet foul odor of the discharge.Still, a quick bullet through the head seemed much preferable to the pain and delirium of death by infection.Did you hear the bang?he wondered, and drifted off, the cool pounded dirt smooth and comforting as a mothers breast under his hot cheek.He wasnt really asleep, only drifting in a feverish doze, but Meltons voice in his ear jerked him to alertness.Grey, the voice was saying, John William Grey!Do you know that name?No, he said, mazy with sleep and fever.Look, man, either shoot me or go away, aye?Im ill.Near Carryarrick.Meltons voice was prodding, impatient.A boy, a fair haired boy, about sixteen.You met him in the wood.Jamie squinted up at his tormentor.The fever distorted his vision, but there seemed something vaguely familiar about the fine boned face above him, with those large, almost girlish eyes.Oh, he said, catching a single face from the flood of images that swirled erratically through his brain.The wee laddie that tried to kill me.Aye, I mind him.He closed his eyes again.In the odd way of fever, one sensation seemed to blend into another.He had broken John William Greys arm; the memory of the boys fine bone beneath his hand became the bone of Claires forearm as he tore her from the grip of the stones.The cool misty breeze stroked his face with Claires fingers.Wake up, damn you!His head snapped on his neck as Melton shook him impatiently.Listen to me!Jamie opened his eyes wearily.Aye?John William Grey is my brother, Melton said.He told me of his meeting with you.You spared his life, and he made you a promiseis that true?With great effort, he cast his mind back.He had met the boy two days before the first battle of the rebellion; the Scottish victory at Prestonpans.The six months between then and now seemed a vast chasm; so much had happened in between.Aye, I recall.He promised to kill me.I dinna mind if you do it for him, though.His eyelids were drooping again.Did he have to be awake in order to be shot?He said he owed you a debt of honor, and he does.Melton stood up, dusting the knees of his breeches, and turned to his lieutenant, who had been watching the questioning with considerable bewilderment.Its the deuce of a situation, Wallace.Thisthis Jacobite scut is famous.Youve heard of Red Jamie?The one on the broadsheets?The Lieutenant nodded, looking curiously down at the bedraggled form in the dirt at his feet.Melton smiled bitterly.No, he doesnt look so dangerous now, does he?But hes still Red Jamie Fraser, and His Grace would be more than pleased to hear of such an illustrious prisoner.They havent yet found Charles Stuart, but a few well known Jacobites would please the crowds at Tower Hill nearly as much.Shall I send a message to His Grace?The Lieutenant reached for his message box.No!Melton wheeled to glare down at his prisoner.Thats the difficulty!Besides being prime gallows bait, this filthy wretch is also the man who captured my youngest brother near Preston, and rather than shooting the brat, which is what he deserved, spared his life and returned him to his companions.Thus, he said through his teeth, incurring a bloody great debt of honor upon my family!Dear me, said the Lieutenant.So you cant give him to His Grace, after all.No, blast it!I cant even shoot the bastard, without dishonoring my brothers sworn word!The prisoner opened one eye.I willna tell anyone if you dont, he suggested, and promptly closed it again.Shut up!Losing his temper entirely, Melton kicked the prisoner, who grunted at the impact, but said nothing more.Perhaps we could shoot him under an assumed name, the Lieutenant suggested helpfully.Lord Melton gave his aide a look of withering scorn, then looked out the window to judge the time.It will be dark in three hours.Ill oversee the burial of the other executed prisoners.Find a small wagon, and have it filled with hay.Find a driverpick someone discreet, Wallace, that means bribable, Wallaceand have them here as soon as its dark.Yes, sir.Er, sir?What about the prisoner?The Lieutenant gestured diffidently toward the body on the floor.What about him?Melton said brusquely.Hes too weak to crawl, let alone walk.He isnt going anywhereat least not until the wagon gets here.Wagon?The prisoner was showing signs of life.In fact, under the stimulus of agitation, he had managed to raise himself onto one arm.Bloodshot blue eyes gleamed wide with alarm, under the spikes of matted red hair.Where are ye sending me?Turning from the door, Melton cast him a glance of intense dislike.Youre the laird of Broch Tuarach, arent you?Well, thats where Im sending you.I dinna want to go home!I want to be shot!The Englishmen exchanged a look.Raving, the Lieutenant said significantly, and Melton nodded.I doubt hell live through the journeybut his death wont be on my head, at least.The door shut firmly behind the Englishmen, leaving Jamie Fraser quite aloneand still alive.2  THE HUNT BEGINS  Inverness   May 2, 1968  Of course hes dead!Claires voice was sharp with agitation; it rang loudly in the half empty study, echoing among the rifled bookshelves.She stood against the cork lined wall like a prisoner awaiting a firing squad, staring from her daughter to Roger Wakefield and back again.I dont think so.Roger felt terribly tired.He rubbed a hand over his face, then picked up the folder from the desk; the one containing all the research hed done since Claire and her daughter had first come to him, three weeks before, and asked his help.He opened the folder and thumbed slowly through the contents.The Jacobites of Culloden.The Rising of the 45.The gallant Scots who had rallied to the banner of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and cut through Scotland like a blazing swordonly to come to ruin and defeat against the Duke of Cumberland on the gray moor at Culloden.Here, he said, plucking out several sheets clipped together.The archaic writing looked odd, rendered in the black crispness of a photocopy.This is the muster roll of the Master of Lovats regiment.He thrust the thin sheaf of papers at Claire, but it was her daughter, Brianna, who took the sheets from him and began to turn the pages, a slight frown between her reddish brows.Read the top sheet, Roger said.Where it says Officers.All right.Officers, she read aloud, Simon, Master of Lovat  The Young Fox, Roger interrupted.Lovats son.And five more names, right?Brianna cocked one brow at him, but went on reading.William Chisholm Fraser, Lieutenant; George DAmerd Fraser Shaw, Captain; Duncan Joseph Fraser, Lieutenant; Bayard Murray Fraser, Major, she paused, swallowing, before reading the last name, James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.Captain.She lowered the papers, looking a little pale.My father.Claire moved quickly to her daughters side, squeezing the girls arm.She was pale, too.Yes, she said to Roger.I know he went to Culloden.When he left methere at the stone circlehe meant to go back to Culloden Field, to rescue his men who were with Charles Stuart.And we know he didshe nodded at the folder on the desk, its manila surface blank and innocent in the lamplightyou found their names.ButbutJamie Speaking the name aloud seemed to rattle her, and she clamped her lips tight.Now it was Briannas turn to support her mother.He meant to go back, you said.Her eyes, dark blue and encouraging, were intent on her mothers face.He meant to take his men away from the field, and then go back to the battle.Claire nodded, recovering herself slightly.He knew he hadnt much chance of getting away; if the English caught himhe said hed rather die in battle.Thats what he meant to do.She turned to Roger, her gaze an unsettling amber.Her eyes always reminded him of hawks eyes, as though she could see a good deal farther than most people.I cant believe he didnt die thereso many men did, and he meant to!Almost half the Highland army had died at Culloden, cut down in a blast of cannonfire and searing musketry.But not Jamie Fraser.No, Roger said doggedly.That bit I read you from Linklaters book He reached to pick it up, a white volume, entitled The Prince in the Heather.Following the battle, he read, eighteen wounded Jacobite officers took refuge in the farmhouse near the moor.Here they lay in pain, their wounds untended, for two days.At the end of that time, they were taken out and shot.One man, a Fraser of the Master of Lovats regiment, escaped the slaughter.The rest are buried at the edge of the domestic park.See?he said, laying the book down and looking earnestly at the two women over its pages.An officer, of the Master of Lovats regiment.He grabbed up the sheets of the muster roll.And here they are!Just six of them.Now, we know the man in the farmhouse cant have been Young Simon; hes a well known historical figure, and we know very well what happened to him.He retreated from the fieldunwounded, mind youwith a group of his men, and fought his way north, eventually making it back to Beaufort Castle, near here.He waved vaguely at the full length window, through which the nighttime lights of Inverness twinkled faintly.Nor was the man who escaped Leanach farmhouse any of the other four officersWilliam, George, Duncan, or Bayard, Roger said.Why?He snatched another paper out of the folder and brandished it, almost triumphantly.Because they all did die at Culloden!All four of them were killed on the fieldI found their names listed on a plaque in the church at Beauly.Claire let out a long breath, then eased herself down into the old leather swivel chair behind the desk.Jesus H.  Christ, she said.She closed her eyes and leaned forward, elbows on the desk, and her head against her hands, the thick, curly brown hair spilling forward to hide her face.Brianna laid a hand on Claires back, face troubled as she bent over her mother.She was a tall girl, with large, fine bones, and her long red hair glowed in the warm light of the desk lamp.If he didnt die she began tentatively.Claires head snapped up.But he is dead!she said.Her face was strained, and small lines were visible around her eyes.For Gods sake, its two hundred years; whether he died at Culloden or not, hes dead now!Brianna stepped back from her mothers vehemence, and lowered her head, so the red hairher fathers red hairswung down beside her cheek.I guess so, she whispered.Roger could see she was fighting back tears.And no wonder, he thought.To find out in short order that first, the man you had loved and called Father all your life really wasnt your father, secondly, that your real father was a Highland Scot who had lived two hundred years ago, and thirdly, to realize that he had likely perished in some horrid fashion, unthinkably far from the wife and child he had sacrificed himself to saveenough to rattle one, Roger thought.He crossed to Brianna and touched her arm.She gave him a brief, distracted glance, and tried to smile.He put his arms around her, even in his pity for her distress thinking how marvelous she felt, all warm and soft and springy at once.Claire still sat at the desk, motionless.The yellow hawks eyes had gone a softer color now, remote with memory.They rested sightlessly on the east wall of the study, still covered from floor to ceiling with the notes and memorabilia left by the Reverend Wakefield, Rogers late adoptive father.Looking at the wall himself, Roger saw the annual meeting notice sent by the Society of the White Rosethose enthusiastic, eccentric souls who still championed the cause of Scottish independence, meeting in nostalgic tribute to Charles Stuart, and the Highland heroes who had followed him.Roger cleared his throat slightly.Erif Jamie Fraser didnt die at Culloden he said.Then he likely died soon afterward.Claires eyes met Rogers, straight on, the cool look back in the yellow brown depths.You have no idea how it was, she said.There was a famine in the Highlandsnone of the men had eaten for days before the battle.He was woundedwe know that.Even if he escaped, there would have beenno one to care for him.Her voice caught slightly at that; she was a doctor now, had been a healer even then, twenty years before, when she had stepped through a circle of standing stones, and met destiny with James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.Roger was conscious of them both; the tall, shaking girl he held in his arms, and the woman at the desk, so still, so poised.She had traveled through the stones, through time; been suspected as a spy, arrested as a witch, snatched by an unimaginable quirk of circumstance from the arms of her first husband, Frank Randall.And three years later, her second husband, James Fraser, had sent her back through the stones, pregnant, in a desperate effort to save her and the unborn child from the onrushing disaster that would soon engulf him.Surely, he thought to himself, shes been through enough?But Roger was a historian.He had a scholars insatiable, amoral curiosity, too powerful to be constrained by simple compassion.More than that, he was oddly conscious of the third figure in the family tragedy in which he found himself involvedJamie Fraser.If he didnt die at Culloden, he began again, more firmly, then perhaps I can find out what did happen to him.Do you want me to try?He waited, breathless, feeling Briannas warm breath through his shirt.Jamie Fraser had had a life, and a death.Roger felt obscurely that it was his duty to find out all the truth; that Jamie Frasers women deserved to know all they could of him.For Brianna, such knowledge was all she would ever have of the father she had never known.And for Clairebehind the question he had asked was the thought that had plainly not yet struck her, stunned with shock as she was: she had crossed the barrier of time twice before.She could, just possibly, do it again.And if Jamie Fraser had not died at Culloden  He saw awareness flicker in the clouded amber of her eyes, as the thought came to her.She was normally pale; now her face blanched white as the ivory handle of the letter opener before her on the desk.Her fingers closed around it, clenching so the knuckles stood out in knobs of bone.She didnt speak for a long time.Her gaze fixed on Brianna and lingered there for a moment, then returned to Rogers face.Yes, she said, in a whisper so soft he could barely hear her.Yes.Find out for me.Please.Find out.3  FRANK AND FULL DISCLOSURE  Inverness   May 9, 1968  The foot traffic was heavy on the bridge over the River Ness, with folk streaming home to their teas.Roger moved in front of me, his wide shoulders protecting me from the buffets of the crowd around us.I could feel my heart beating heavily against the stiff cover of the book I was clutching to my chest.It did that whenever I paused to think what we were truly doing.I wasnt sure which of the two possible alternatives was worse; to find that Jamie had died at Culloden, or to find that he hadnt.The boards of the bridge echoed hollowly underfoot, as we trudged back toward the manse.My arms ached from the weight of the books I carried, and I shifted the load from one side to the other.Watch your bloody wheel, man!Roger shouted, nudging me adroitly to the side, as a workingman on a bicycle plowed head downward through the bridge traffic, nearly running me against the railing.Sorry!came back the apologetic shout, and the rider gave a wave of the hand over his shoulder, as the bike wove its way between two groups of schoolchildren, coming home for their teas.I glanced back across the bridge, in case Brianna should be visible behind us, but there was no sign of her.Roger and I had spent the afternoon at the Society for the Preservation of Antiquities.Brianna had gone down to the Highland Clans office, there to collect photocopies of a list of documents Roger had compiled.Its very kind of you to take all this trouble, Roger, I said, raising my voice to be heard above the echoing bridge and the rivers rush.Its all right, he said, a little awkwardly, pausing for me to catch him up.Im curious, he added, smiling a little.You know historianscant leave a puzzle alone.He shook his head, trying to brush the windblown dark hair out of his eyes without using his hands.I did know historians.Id lived with one for twenty years.Frank hadnt wanted to leave this particular puzzle alone, either.But neither had he been willing to solve it.Frank had been dead for two years, though, and now it was my turnmine and Briannas.Have you heard yet from Dr.Linklater?I asked, as we came down the arch of the bridge.Late in the afternoon as it was, the sun was still high, so far north as we were.Caught among the leaves of the lime trees on the riverbank, it glowed pink on the granite cenotaph that stood below the bridge.Roger shook his head, squinting against the wind.No, but its been only a week since I wrote.If I dont hear by the Monday, Ill try telephoning.Dont worryhe smiled sideways at meI was very circumspect.I just told him that for purposes of a study I was making, I needed a listif one existedof the Jacobite officers who were in Leanach farmhouse after Culloden, and if any information exists as to the survivor of that execution, could he refer me to the original sources?Do you know Linklater?I asked, easing my left arm by tilting the books sideways against my hip.No, but I wrote my request on the Balliol College letterhead, and made tactful reference to Mr.Cheesewright, my old tutor, who does know Link later.Roger winked reassuringly, and I laughed.His eyes were a brilliant, lucent green, bright against his olive skin.Curiosity might be his stated reason for helping us to find out Jamies history, but I was well aware that his interest went a good bit deeperin the direction of Brianna.I also knew that the interest was returned.What I didnt know was whether Roger realized that as well.Back in the late Reverend Wakefields study, I dropped my armload of books on the table in relief, and collapsed into the wing chair by the hearth, while Roger went to fetch a glass of lemonade from the manses kitchen.My breathing slowed as I sipped the tart sweetness, but my pulse stayed erratic, as I looked over the imposing stack of books we had brought back.Was Jamie in there somewhere?And if he wasmy hands grew wet on the cold glass, and I choked the thought off.Dont look too far ahead, I cautioned myself.Much better to wait, and see what we might find.Roger was scanning the shelves in the study, in search of other possibilities.The Reverend Wakefield, Rogers late adoptive father, had been both a good amateur historian, and a terrible pack rat; letters, journals, pamphlets and broadsheets, antique and contemporary volumesall were crammed cheek by jowl together on the shelves.Roger hesitated, then his hand fell on a stack of books sitting on the nearby table.They were Franks booksan impressive achievement, so far as I could tell by reading the encomiums printed on the dust jackets.Have you ever read this?he asked, picking up the volume entitled The Jacobites.No, I said.I took a restorative gulp of lemonade, and coughed.No, I said again.I couldnt.After my return, I had resolutely refused to look at any material dealing with Scotlands past, even though the eighteenth century had been one of Franks areas of specialty.Knowing Jamie dead, and faced with the necessity of living without him, I avoided anything that might bring him to mind.A useless avoidancethere was no way of keeping him out of my mind, with Briannas existence a daily reminder of himbut still, I could not read books about the Bonnie Princethat terrible, futile young manor his followers.I see.I just thought you might know whether there might be something useful in here.Roger paused, the flush deepening over his cheekbones.Dider, did your husbandFrank, I mean, he added hastily.Did you tell himumabout His voice trailed off, choked with embarrassment.Well, of course I did!I said, a little sharply.What did you thinkId just stroll back into his office after being gone for three years and say, Oh, hullo there, darling, and what would you like for supper tonight?No, of course not, Roger muttered.He turned away, eyes fixed on the bookshelves.The back of his neck was deep red with embarrassment.Im sorry, I said, taking a deep breath.Its a fair question to ask.Its only that itsa bit raw, yet.A good deal more than a bit.I was both surprised and appalled to find just how raw the wound still was.I set the glass down on the table at my elbow.If we were going on with this, I was going to need something stronger than lemonade.Yes, I said.I told him.All about the stonesabout Jamie.Everything.Roger didnt reply for a moment.Then he turned, halfway, so that only the strong, sharp lines of his profile were visible.He didnt look at me, but down at the stack of Franks books, at the back cover photo of Frank, leanly dark and handsome, smiling for posterity.Did he believe you?Roger asked quietly.My lips felt sticky from the lemonade, and I licked them before answering.No, I said.Not at first.He thought I was mad; even had me vetted by a psychiatrist.I laughed, shortly, but the memory made me clench my fists with remembered fury.Later, then?Roger turned to face me.The flush had faded from his skin, leaving only an echo of curiosity in his eyes.What did he think?I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.I dont know.The tiny hospital in Inverness smelled unfamiliar, like carbolic disinfectant and starch.I couldnt think, and tried not to feel.The return was much more terrifying than my venture into the past had been, for there, I had been shrouded by a protective layer of doubt and disbelief about where I was and what was happening, and had lived in constant hope of escape.Now I knew only too well where I was, and I knew that there was no escape.Jamie was dead.The doctors and nurses tried to speak kindly to me, to feed me and bring me things to drink, but there was no room in me for anything but grief and terror.I had told them my name when they asked, but wouldnt speak further.I lay in the clean white bed, fingers clamped tight together over my vulnerable belly, and kept my eyes shut.I visualized over and over the last things I had seen before I stepped through the stonesthe rainy moor and Jamies faceknowing that if I looked too long at my new surroundings, these sights would fade, replaced by mundane things like the nurses and the vase of flowers by my bed.I pressed one thumb secretly against the base of the other, taking an obscure comfort in the tiny wound there, a small cut in the shape of a J.  Jamie had made it, at my demandthe last of his touch on my flesh.I must have stayed that way for some time; I slept sometimes, dreaming of the last few days of the Jacobite RisingI saw again the dead man in the wood, asleep beneath a coverlet of bright blue fungus, and Dougal MacKenzie dying on the floor of an attic in Culloden House; the ragged men of the Highland army, asleep in the muddy ditches; their last sleep before the slaughter.I would wake screaming or moaning, to the scent of disinfectant and the sound of soothing words, incomprehensible against the echoes of Gaelic shouting in my dreams, and fall asleep again, my hurt clutched tight in the palm of my hand.And then I opened my eyes and Frank was there.He stood in the door, smoothing back his dark hair with one hand, looking uncertainand no wonder, poor man.I lay back on the pillows, just watching him, not speaking.He had the look of his ancestors, Jack and Alex Randall; fine, clear, aristocratic features and a well shaped head, under a spill of straight dark hair.His face had some indefinable difference from theirs, though, beyond the small differences of feature.There was no mark of fear or ruthlessness on him; neither the spirituality of Alex nor the icy arrogance of Jack.His lean face looked intelligent, kind, and slightly tired, unshaven and with smudges beneath his eyes.I knew without being told that he had driven all night to get here.Claire?He came over to the bed, and spoke tentatively, as though not sure that I really was Claire.I wasnt sure either, but I nodded and said, Hullo, Frank.My voice was scratchy and rough, unaccustomed to speech.He took one of my hands, and I let him have it.Are youall right?he said, after a minute.He was frowning slightly as he looked at me.Im pregnant.That seemed the important point, to my disordered mind.I had not thought of what I would say to Frank, if I ever saw him again, but the moment I saw him standing in the door, it seemed to come clear in my mind.I would tell him I was pregnant, he would leave, and I would be alone with my last sight of Jamies face, and the burning touch of him on my hand.His face tightened a bit, but he didnt let go of my other hand.I know.They told me.He took a deep breath and let it out.Clairecan you tell me what happened to you?I felt quite blank for a moment, but then shrugged.I suppose so, I said.I mustered my thoughts wearily; I didnt want to be talking about it, but I had some feeling of obligation to this man.Not guilt, not yet; but obligation nonetheless.I had been married to him.Well, I said, I fell in love with someone else, and I married him.Im sorry, I added, in response to the look of shock that crossed his face, I couldnt help it.He hadnt been expecting that.His mouth opened and closed for a bit and he gripped my hand, hard enough to make me wince and jerk it out of his grasp.What do you mean?he said, his voice sharp.Where have you been, Claire?He stood up suddenly, looming over the bed.Do you remember that when I last saw you, I was going up to the stone circle on Craigh na Dun?Yes?He was staring down at me with an expression somewhere between anger and suspicion.WellI licked my lips, which had gone quite drythe fact is, I walked through a cleft stone in that circle, and ended up in 1743.Dont be facetious, Claire!You think Im being funny?The thought was so absurd that I actually began to laugh, though I felt a good long way from real humor.Stop that!I quit laughing.Two nurses appeared at the door as though by magic; they must have been lurking in the hall nearby.Frank leaned over and grabbed my arm.Listen to me, he said through his teeth.You are going to tell me where youve been and what youve been doing!I am telling you!Let go!I sat up in bed and yanked at my arm, pulling it out of his grasp.I told you; I walked through a stone and ended up two hundred years ago.And I met your bloody ancestor, Jack Randall, there!Frank blinked, entirely taken aback.Who?Black Jack Randall, and a bloody, filthy, nasty pervert he was, too!Franks mouth hung open, and so did the nurses.I could hear feet coming down the corridor behind them, and hurried voices.I had to marry Jamie Fraser to get away from Jack Randall, but thenJamieI couldnt help it, Frank, I loved him and I would have stayed with him if I could, but he sent me back because of Culloden, and the baby, and I broke off, as a man in a doctors uniform pushed past the nurses by the door.Frank, I said tiredly, Im sorry.I didnt mean it to happen, and I tried all I could to come backreally, I didbut I couldnt.And now its too late.Despite myself, tears began to well up in my eyes and roll down my cheeks.Mostly for Jamie, and myself, and the child I carried, but a few for Frank as well.I sniffed hard and swallowed, trying to stop, and pushed myself upright in the bed.Look, I said, I know you wont want to have anything more to do with me, and I dont blame you at all.Justjust go away, will you?His face had changed.He didnt look angry anymore, but distressed, and slightly puzzled.He sat down by the bed, ignoring the doctor who had come in and was groping for my pulse.Im not going anywhere, he said, quite gently.He took my hand again, though I tried to pull it away.ThisJamie.Who was he?I took a deep, ragged breath.The doctor had hold of my other hand, still trying to take my pulse, and I felt absurdly panicked, as though I were being held captive between them.I fought down the feeling, though, and tried to speak steadily.James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser, I said, spacing the words, formally, the way Jamie had spoken them to me when he first told me his full nameon the day of our wedding.The thought made another tear overflow, and I blotted it against my shoulder, my hands being restrained.He was a Highlander.He was k killed at Culloden.It was no use, I was weeping again, the tears no anodyne to the grief that ripped through me, but the only response I had to unendurable pain.I bent forward slightly, trying to encapsulate it, wrapping myself around the tiny, imperceptible life in my belly, the only remnant left to me of Jamie Fraser.Frank and the doctor exchanged a glance of which I was only half conscious.Of course, to them, Culloden was part of the distant past.To me, it had happened only two days before.Perhaps we should let Mrs.Randall rest for a bit, the doctor suggested.She seems a wee bit upset just now.Frank looked uncertainly from the doctor to me.Well, she certainly does seem upset.But I really want to find outwhats this, Claire?Stroking my hand, he had encountered the silver ring on my fourth finger, and now bent to examine it.It was the ring Jamie had given me for our marriage; a wide silver band in the Highland interlace pattern, the links engraved with tiny, stylized thistle blooms.No!I exclaimed, panicked, as Frank tried to twist it off my finger.I jerked my hand away and cradled it, fisted, beneath my bosom, cupped in my left hand, which still wore Franks gold wedding band.No, you cant take it, I wont let you!Thats my wedding ring!Now, see here, Claire Franks words were interrupted by the doctor, who had crossed to Franks side of the bed, and was now bending down to murmur in his ear.I caught a few wordsnot trouble your wife just now.The shockand then Frank was on his feet once more, being firmly urged away by the doctor, who gave a nod to one of the nurses in passing.I barely felt the sting of the hypodermic needle, too engulfed in the fresh wave of grief to take notice of anything.I dimly heard Franks parting words, All rightbut Claire, I will know!And then the blessed darkness came down, and I slept without dreaming, for a long, long time.Roger tilted the decanter, bringing the level of the spirit in the glass up to the halfway point.He handed it to Claire with a half smile.Fionas grannie always said whisky is good for what ails ye.Ive seen worse remedies.Claire took the glass and gave him back the half smile in change.Roger poured out a drink for himself, then sat down beside her, sipping quietly.I tried to send him away, you know, she said suddenly, lowering her glass.Frank.I told him I knew he couldnt feel the same for me, no matter what he believed had happened.I said I would give him a divorce; he must go away and forget about metake up the life hed begun building without me.He wouldnt do it, though.Roger said.It was growing chilly in the study as the sun went down, and he bent and switched on the ancient electric fire.Because you were pregnant?he guessed.She shot him a sudden sharp look, then smiled, a little wryly.Yes, that was it.He said no one but a cad would dream of abandoning a pregnant woman with virtually no resources.Particularly one whose grip on reality seemed a trifle tenuous, she added ironically.I wasnt quite without resourcesI had a bit of money from my uncle Lambbut Frank wasnt a cad, either.Her glance shifted to the bookshelves.Her husbands historical works stood there, side by side, spines gleaming in the light of the desklamp.He was a very decent man, she said softly.She took another sip of her drink, closing her eyes as the alcoholic fumes rose up.And thenhe knew, or suspected, that he couldnt have children himself.Rather a blow, for a man so involved in history and genealogies.All those dynastic considerations, you see.Yes, I can see that, Roger said slowly.But wouldnt he feelI mean, another mans child?He might have.The amber eyes were looking at him again, their clearness slightly softened by whisky and reminiscence.But as it was, since he didntcouldntbelieve anything I said about Jamie, the babys father was essentially unknown.If he didnt know who the man wasand convinced himself that I didnt really know either, but had just made up these delusions out of traumatic shockwell, then, there was no one ever to say that the child wasnt his.Certainly not me, she added, with just a tinge of bitterness.She took a large swallow of whisky that made her eyes water slightly, and took a moment to wipe them.But to make sure, he took me clean away.To Boston, she went on.Hed been offered a good position at Harvard, and no one knew us there.Thats where Brianna was born.The fretful crying jarred me awake yet again.I had gone back to bed at 6:30, after getting up five times during the night with the baby.A bleary eyed look at the clock showed the time now as 7:00.A cheerful singing came from the bathroom, Franks voice raised in Rule, Britannia, over the noise of rushing water.I lay in bed, heavy limbed with exhaustion, wondering whether I had the strength to endure the crying until Frank got out of the shower and could bring Brianna to me.As though the baby knew what I was thinking, the crying rose two or three tones and escalated to a sort of periodic shriek, punctuated by frightening gulps for air.I flung back the covers and was on my feet, propelled by the same sort of panic with which I had greeted air raids during the War.I lumbered down the chilly hall and into the nursery, to find Brianna, aged three months, lying on her back, yelling her small red head off.I was so groggy from lack of sleep that it took a moment for me to realize that I had left her on her stomach.Darling!You turned over!All by yourself!Terrorized by her audacious act, Brianna waved her little pink fists and squalled louder, eyes squeezed shut.I snatched her up, patting her back and murmuring to the top of her red fuzzed head.Oh, you precious darling!What a clever girl you are!Whats that?Whats happened?Frank emerged from the bathroom, toweling his head, a second towel wrapped about his loins.Is something the matter with Brianna?He came toward us, looking worried.As the birth grew closer, we had both been edgy; Frank irritable and myself terrified, having no idea what might happen between us, with the appearance of Jamie Frasers child.But when the nurse had taken Brianna from her bassinet and handed her to Frank, with the words Heres Daddys little girl, his face had grown blank, and thenlooking down at the tiny face, perfect as a rosebudgone soft with wonder.Within a week, he had been hers, body and soul.I turned to him, smiling.She turned over!All by herself!Really?His scrubbed face beamed with delight.Isnt it early for her to do that?Yes, it is.Dr.Spock says she oughtnt to be able to do it for another month, at least!Well, what does Dr.Spock know?Come here, little beauty; give Daddy a kiss for being so precocious.He lifted the soft little body, encased in its snug pink sleep suit, and kissed her button of a nose.Brianna sneezed, and we both laughed.I stopped then, suddenly aware that it was the first time I had laughed in nearly a year.Still more, that it was the first time I had laughed with Frank.He realized it too; his eyes met mine over the top of Briannas head.They were a soft hazel, and at the moment, filled with tenderness.I smiled at him, a little tremulous, and suddenly very much aware that he was all but naked, with water droplets sliding down his lean shoulders and shining on the smooth brown skin of his chest.The smell of burning reached us simultaneously, jarring us from this scene of domestic bliss.The coffee!Thrusting Bree unceremoniously into my arms, Frank bolted for the kitchen, leaving both towels in a heap at my feet.Smiling at the sight of his bare buttocks, gleaming an incongruous white as he sprinted into the kitchen, I followed him more slowly, holding Bree against my shoulder.He was standing at the sink, naked, amid a cloud of malodorous steam rising from the scorched coffeepot.Tea, maybe?I asked, adroitly anchoring Brianna on my hip with one arm while I rummaged in the cupboard.None of the orange pekoe leaf left, Im afraid; just Liptons teabags.Frank made a face; an Englishman to the bone, he would rather lap water out of the toilet than drink tea made from teabags.The Liptons had been left by Mrs.Grossman, the weekly cleaning woman, who thought tea made from loose leaves messy and disgusting.No, Ill get a cup of coffee on my way to the university.Oh, speaking of which, you recall that were having the Dean and his wife to dinner tonight?Mrs.Hinchcliffe is bringing a present for Brianna.Oh, right, I said, without enthusiasm.I had met the Hinchcliffes before, and wasnt all that keen to repeat the experience.Still, the effort had to be made.With a mental sigh, I shifted the baby to the other side and groped in the drawer for a pencil to make a grocery list.Brianna burrowed into the front of my red chenille dressing gown, making small voracious grunting noises.You cant be hungry again, I said to the top of her head.I fed you not two hours ago.My breasts were beginning to leak in response to her rooting, though, and I was already sitting down and loosening the front of my gown.Mrs.Hinchcliffe said that a baby shouldnt be fed every time it cries, Frank observed.They get spoilt if they arent kept to a schedule.It wasnt the first time I had heard Mrs.Hinchcliffes opinions on child rearing.Then shell be spoilt, wont she?I said coldly, not looking at him.The small pink mouth clamped down fiercely, and Brianna began to suck with mindless appetite.I was aware that Mrs.Hinchcliffe also thought breast feeding both vulgar and insanitary.I, who had seen any number of eighteenth century babies nursing contentedly at their mothers breasts, didnt.Frank sighed, but didnt say anything further.After a moment, he put down the pot holder and sidled toward the door.Well, he said awkwardly.Ill see you around six then, shall I?Ought I to bring home anythingsave you going out?I gave him a brief smile, and said, No, Ill manage.Oh, good.He hesitated a moment, as I settled Bree more comfortably on my lap, head resting on the crook of my arm, the round of her head echoing the curve of my breast.I looked up from the baby, and found him watching me intently, eyes fixed on the swell of my half exposed bosom.My own eyes flicked downward over his body.I saw the beginnings of his arousal, and bent my head over the baby, to hide my flushing face.Goodbye, I muttered, to the top of her head.He stood still a moment, then leaned forward and kissed me briefly on the cheek, the warmth of his bare body unsettlingly near.Goodbye, Claire, he said softly.Ill see you tonight.He didnt come into the kitchen again before leaving, so I had a chance to finish feeding Brianna and bring my own feelings into some semblance of normality.I hadnt seen Frank naked since my return; he had always dressed in bathroom or closet.Neither had he tried to kiss me before this mornings cautious peck.The pregnancy had been what the obstetrician called high risk, and there had been no question of Franks sharing my bed, even had I been so disposedwhich I wasnt.I should have seen this coming, but I hadnt.Absorbed first in sheer misery, and then in the physical torpor of oncoming motherhood, I had pushed away all considerations beyond my bulging belly.After Briannas birth, I had lived from feeding to feeding, seeking small moments of mindless peace, when I could hold her oblivious body close and find relief from thought and memory in the pure sensual pleasure of touching and holding her.Frank, too, cuddled the baby and played with her, falling asleep in his big chair with her stretched out atop his lanky form, rosy cheek pressed flat against his chest, as they snored together in peaceful companionship.He and I did not touch each other, though, nor did we truly talk about anything beyond our basic domestic arrangementsexcept Brianna.The baby was our shared focus; a point through which we could at once reach each other, and keep each other at arms length.It looked as though arms length was no longer close enough for Frank.I could do itphysically, at least.I had seen the doctor for a checkup the week before, and he hadwith an avuncular wink and a pat on the bottomassured me that I could resume relations with my husband at any time.I knew Frank hadnt been celibate since my disappearance.In his late forties, he was still lean and muscular, dark and sleek, a very handsome man.Women clustered about him at cocktail parties like bees round a honeypot, emitting small hums of sexual excitement.There had been one girl with brown hair whom I had noticed particularly at the departmental party; she stood in the corner and stared at Frank mournfully over her drink.Later she became tearfully and incoherently drunk, and was escorted home by two female friends, who took turns casting evil looks at Frank and at me, standing by his side, silently bulging in my flowered maternity dress.Hed been discreet, though.He was always home at night, and took pains not to have lipstick on his collar.So, now he meant to come home all the way.I supposed he had some right to expect it; was that not a wifely duty, and I once more his wife?There was only one small problem.It wasnt Frank I reached for, deep in the night, waking out of sleep.It wasnt his smooth, lithe body that walked my dreams and roused me, so that I came awake moist and gasping, my heart pounding from the half remembered touch.But I would never touch that man again.Jamie, I whispered, Oh, Jamie.My tears sparkled in the morning light, adorning Briannas soft red fuzz like scattered pearls and diamonds.It wasnt a good day.Brianna had a bad diaper rash, which made her cross and irritable, needing to be picked up every few minutes.She nursed and fussed alternately, pausing to spit up at intervals, making clammy wet patches on whatever I wore.I changed my blouse three times before eleven oclock.The heavy nursing bra I wore chafed under the arms, and my nipples felt cold and chapped.Midway through my laborious tidying up of the house, there was a whooshing clank from under the floorboards, and the hot air registers died with a feeble sigh.No, next week wont do, I said over the telephone to the furnace repair shop.I looked at the window, where the cold February fog was threatening to seep under the sill and engulf us.Its forty two degrees in here, and I have a three month old baby!The baby in question was sitting in her baby seat, swaddled in all her blankets, squalling like a scalded cat.Ignoring the quacking of the person on the other end, I held the receiver next to Briannas wide open mouth for several seconds.See?I demanded, lifting the phone to my ear again.Awright, lady, said a resigned voice on the other end of the line.Ill come out this afternoon, sometime between noon and six.Noon and six?Cant you narrow it down a little more than that?I have to get out to the market, I protested.You aint the only dead furnace in town, lady, the voice said with finality, and hung up.I glanced at the clock; eleven thirty.Id never be able to get the marketing done and get back in half an hour.Marketing with a small baby was more like a ninety minute expedition into Darkest Borneo, requiring massive amounts of equipment and tremendous expenditures of energy.Gritting my teeth, I called the expensive market that delivered, ordered the necessities for dinner, and picked up the baby, who was by now the shade of an eggplant, and markedly smelly.That looks ouchy, darling.Youll feel much better if we get it off, wont you?I said, trying to talk soothingly as I wiped the brownish slime off Briannas bright red bottom.She arched her back, trying to escape the clammy washcloth, and shrieked some more.A layer of Vaseline and the tenth clean diaper of the day; the diaper service truck wasnt due til tomorrow, and the house reeked of ammonia.All right, sweetheart, there, there.I hoisted her up on my shoulder, patting her, but the screeching went on and on.Not that I could blame her; her poor bottom was nearly raw.Ideally, she should be let to lie about on a towel with nothing on, but with no heat in the house, that wasnt feasible.She and I were both wearing sweaters and heavy winter coats, which made the frequent feedings even more of a nuisance than usual; excavating a breast could take several minutes, while the baby screamed.Brianna couldnt sleep for more than ten minutes at a time.Consequently, neither could I.  When we did drift off together at four oclock, we were roused within a quarter of an hour by the crashing arrival of the furnace man, who pounded on the door, not bothering to set down the large wrench he was holding.Jiggling the baby against my shoulder with one hand, I began cooking the dinner with the other, to the accompaniment of screeches in my ear and the sounds of violence from the cellar below.I aint promising nothin, lady, but you got heat for now.The furnace man appeared abruptly, wiping a smear of grease from his creased forehead.He leaned forward to inspect Brianna, who was lying more or less peacefully across my shoulder, loudly sucking her thumb.Hows that thumb taste, sweetie?he inquired.They say you shouldnt oughta let em suck their thumbs, you know, he informed me, straightening up.Gives em crooked teeth and theyll need braces.Is that so?I said through my own teeth.How much do I owe you?Half an hour later, the chicken lay in its pan, stuffed and basted, surrounded by crushed garlic, sprigs of rosemary, and curls of lemon peel.A quick squeeze of lemon juice over the buttery skin, and I could stick it in the oven and go get myself and Brianna dressed.The kitchen looked like the result of an incompetent burglary, with cupboards hanging open and cooking paraphernalia strewn on every horizontal surface.I banged shut a couple of cupboard doors, and then the kitchen door itself, trusting that that would keep Mrs.Hinchcliffe out, even if good manners wouldnt.Frank had brought a new pink dress for Brianna to wear.It was a beautiful thing, but I eyed the layers of lace around the neck dubiously.They looked not only scratchy, but delicate.Well, well give it a try, I told her.Daddy will like you to look pretty.Lets try not to spit up in it, hm?Brianna responded by shutting her eyes, stiffening, and grunting as she extruded more slime.Oh, well done!I said, sincerely.It meant changing the crib sheet, but at least it wouldnt make the diaper rash worse.The mess attended to and a fresh diaper in place, I shook out the pink dress, and paused to carefully wipe the snot and drool from her face before popping the garment over her head.She blinked at me and gurgled enticingly, windmilling her fists.I obligingly lowered my head and went Pfffft!into her navel, which made her squirm and gurgle with joy.We did it a few more times, then began the painstaking job of getting into the pink dress.Brianna didnt like it; she started to complain as I put it over her head, and as I crammed her chubby little arms into the puffed sleeves, put back her head and let out a piercing cry.What is it?I demanded, startled.I knew all her cries by now and mostly, what she meant by them, but this was a new one, full of fright and pain.Whats the matter, darling?She was screaming furiously now, tears rolling down her face.I turned her frantically over and patted her back, thinking she might have had a sudden attack of colic, but she wasnt doubled up.She was struggling violently, though, and as I turned her back over to pick her up, I saw the long red line running up the tender inside of her waving arm.A pin had been left in the dress, and had scored her flesh as I forced the sleeve up her arm.Oh, baby!Oh, Im so sorry!Mummys so sorry!Tears were running down my own face as I eased the stabbing pin free and removed it.I clutched her to my shoulder, patting and soothing, trying to calm my own feelings of panicked guilt.Of course I hadnt meant to hurt her, but she wouldnt know that.Oh, darling, I murmured.Its all right now.Yes, Mummy loves you, its all right.Why hadnt I thought to check for pins?For that matter, what sort of maniac would package a babys clothes using straight pins?Torn between fury and distress, I eased Brianna into the dress, wiped her chin, and carried her into the bedroom, where I laid her on my twin bed while I hastily changed to a decent skirt and a fresh blouse.The doorbell rang as I was pulling on my stockings.There was a hole in one heel, but no time to do anything about it now.I stuck my feet into the pinching alligator pumps, snatched up Brianna, and went to answer the door.It was Frank, too laden with packages to use his key.One handed, I took most of them from him and parked them on the hall table.Dinner all ready, dear?Ive brought a new tablecloth and napkinsthought ours were a bit shabby.And the wine, of course.He lifted the bottle in his hand, smiling, then leaned forward to peer at me, and stopped smiling.He looked disapprovingly from my disheveled hair to my blouse, freshly stained with spit up milk.Christ, Claire, he said.Couldnt you fix yourself up a bit?I mean, its not as though you have anything else to do, at home all daycouldnt you take a few minutes for a  No, I said, quite loudly.I pushed Brianna, who was wailing again with fretful exhaustion, into his arms.No, I said again, and took the wine bottle from his unresisting hand.NO!I shrieked, stamping my foot.I swung the bottle widely, and he dodged, but it was the doorjamb I struck, and purplish splatters of Beaujolais flew across the stoop, leaving glass shards glittering in the light from the entryway.I flung the shattered bottle into the azaleas and ran coatless down the walk and into the freezing fog.At the foot of the walk, I passed the startled Hinchcliffes, who were arriving half an hour early, presumably in hopes of catching me in some domestic deficiency.I hoped theyd enjoy their dinner.I drove aimlessly through the fog, the cars heater blasting on my feet, until I began to get low on gas.I wasnt going home; not yet.An all night cafe?Then I realized that it was Friday night, and getting on for twelve oclock.I had a place to go, after all.I turned back toward the suburb where we lived, and the Church of St.Finbar.At this hour, the chapel was locked to prevent vandalism and burglary.For the late adorers, there was a push button lock set just below the door handle.Five buttons, numbered one to five.By pushing three of them, in the proper combination, the latch could be sprung to allow lawful entry.I moved quietly along the back of the chapel, to the logbook that sat at the feet of St.Finbar, to record my arrival.St.Finbar?Frank had said incredulously.There isnt such a saint.There cant possibly be.There is, I said, with a trace of smugness.An Irish bishop, from the twelfth century.Oh, Irish, said Frank dismissively.That explains it.But what I cant understand, he said, careful to be tactful, is, er, wellwhy?Why what?Why go in for this Perpetual Adoration business?Youve never been the least devout, no more than I have.And you dont go to Mass or anything; Father Beggs asks me every week where you are.I shook my head.I cant really say, Frank.Its just somethingI need to do.I looked at him, helpless to explain adequately.Itspeaceful there, I said, finally.He opened his mouth as though to speak further, then turned away, shaking his head.It was peaceful.The car park at the church was deserted, save for the single car of the adorer on duty at this hour, gleaming an anonymous black under the arc lights.Inside, I signed my name to the log and walked forward, coughing tactfully to alert the eleven oclock adorer to my presence without the rudeness of direct speech.I knelt behind him, a heavyset man in a yellow windcheater.After a moment, he rose, genuflected before the altar, turned and walked to the door, nodding briefly as he passed me.The door hissed shut and I was alone, save for the Sacrament displayed on the altar, in the great golden sunburst of the monstrance.There were two candles on the altar, big ones.Smooth and white, they burned steadily in the still air, without a flicker.I closed my eyes for a moment, just listening to the silence.Everything that had happened during the day whirled through my mind in a disjointed welter of thoughts and feelings.Coatless, I was shaking with cold from the short walk through the parking lot, but slowly I grew warm again, and my clenched hands relaxed in my lap.At last, as usually happened here, I ceased to think.Whether it was the stoppage of time in the presence of eternity, or only the overtaking of a bone deep fatigue, I didnt know.But the guilt over Frank eased, the wrenching grief for Jamie lessened, and even the constant tug of motherhood upon my emotions receded to the level of background noise, no louder than the slow beating of my own heart, regular and comforting in the dark peace of the chapel.O Lord, I whispered, I commend to your mercy the soul of your servant James.And mine, I added silently.And mine.I sat there without moving, watching the flickering glow of the candle flames in the gold surface of the monstrance, until the soft footsteps of the next adorer came down the aisle behind me, ending in the heavy creak of genuflection.They came once each hour, day and night.The Blessed Sacrament was never left alone.I stayed for a few minutes more, then slid out of the pew, with my own nod toward the altar.As I walked toward the back of the chapel, I saw a figure in the back row, under the shadow of the statue of St.Anthony.It stirred as I approached, then the man rose to his feet and made his way to the aisle to meet me.What are you doing here?I hissed.Frank nodded toward the form of the new adorer, already kneeling in contemplation, and took my elbow to guide me out.I waited until the chapel door had closed behind us before pulling away and whirling to confront him.What is this?I said angrily.Why did you come after me?I was worried about you.He gestured toward the empty car park, where his large Buick nestled protectively next to my small Ford.Its dangerous, a lone woman walking about in the very late night in this part of town.I came to see you home.Thats all.He didnt mention the Hinchcliffes, or the dinner party.My annoyance ebbed a bit.Oh, I said.What did you do with Brianna?Asked old Mrs.Munsing from next door to keep an ear out in case she cried.But she seemed dead asleep; I didnt think there was much chance.Come along now, its cold out.It was; the freezing air off the bay was coiling in white tendrils around the posts of the arc lights, and I shivered in my thin blouse.Ill meet you at home, then, I said.The warmth of the nursery reached out to embrace me as I went in to check Brianna.She was still asleep, but restless, turning her russet head from side to side, the groping little mouth opening and closing like the breathing of a fish.Shes getting hungry, I whispered to Frank, who had come in behind me and was hovering over my shoulder, peering fondly at the baby.Id better feed her before I come to bed; then shell sleep later in the morning.Ill get you a hot drink, and he vanished through the door to the kitchen as I picked up the sleepy, warm bundle.She had only drained one side, but she was full.The slack mouth pulled slowly away from the nipple, rimmed with milk, and the fuzzy head fell heavily back on my arm.No amount of gentle shaking or calling would rouse her to nurse on the other side, so at last I gave up and tucked her back in her crib, patting her back softly until a faint, contented belch wafted up from the pillow, succeeded by the heavy breathing of absolute satiation.Down for the night, is she?Frank drew the baby blanket, decorated with yellow bunnies, up over her.Yes.I sat back in my rocking chair, mentally and physically too exhausted to get up again.Frank came to stand behind me; his hand rested lightly on my shoulder.Hes dead, then?he asked gently.I told you so, I started to say.Then I stopped, closed my mouth and only nodded, rocking slowly, staring at the dark crib and its tiny occupant.My right breast was still painfully swollen with milk.No matter how tired I was, I couldnt sleep until I took care of it.With a sigh of resignation, I reached for the breast pump, an ungainly and ridiculous looking rubber contraption.Using it was undignified and uncomfortable, but better than waking up in an hour in bursting pain, sopping wet from overflowing milk.I waved a hand at Frank, dismissing him.Go ahead.It will only take a few minutes, but I have to  Instead of leaving or answering, he took the pump from my hand and laid it down on the table.As though it moved of its own will, without direction from him, his hand rose slowly through the warm, dark air of the nursery and cupped itself gently around the swollen curve of my breast.His head bowed and his lips fastened softly on my nipple.I groaned, feeling the half painful prickle of the milk rushing through the tiny ducts.I put a hand behind his head, and pressed him slightly closer.Harder, I whispered.His mouth was soft, gentle in its pressure, nothing like the relentless grasp of a babys hard, toothless gums, that fasten on like grim death, demanding and draining, releasing the bounteous fountain at once in response to their greed.Frank knelt before me, his mouth a supplicant.Was this how God felt, I wondered, seeing the adorers before Himwas He, too, filled with tenderness and pity?The haze of fatigue made me feel as though everything happened in slow motion, as though we were under water.Franks hands moved slowly as sea fronds, swaying in the current, moving over my flesh with a touch as gentle as the brush of kelp leaves, lifting me with the strength of a wave, and laying me down on the shore of the nursery rug.I closed my eyes, and let the tide carry me away.The front door of the old manse opened with a screech of rusty hinges, announcing the return of Brianna Randall.Roger was on his feet and into the hall at once, drawn by the sound of girls voices.A pound of best butterthats what you told me to ask for, and I did, but I kept wondering whether there was such a thing as second best butter, or worst butter Brianna was handing over wrapped packages to Fiona, laughing and talking at once.Well, and if ye got it from that auld rascal Wicklow, worst is what its likely to be, no matter what he says, Fiona interrupted.Oh, and yeve got the cinnamon, thats grand!Ill make cinnamon scones, then; dye want to come and watch me do it?Yes, but first I want supper.Im starved!Brianna stood on tiptoe, sniffing hopefully in the direction of the kitchen.What are we havinghaggis?Haggis!Gracious, ye silly Sassenachye dinna have haggis in the spring!Ye have it in the autumn when the sheep are killed.Am I a Sassenach?Brianna seemed delighted at the name.Of course ye are, gowk.But I like ye fine, anyway.Fiona laughed up at Brianna, who towered over the small Scottish girl by nearly a foot.Fiona was nineteen, prettily charming and slightly plump; next to her, Brianna looked like a medieval carving, strong boned and severe.With her long, straight nose and the long hair glowing red gold beneath the glass bowl of the ceiling fixture, she might have walked out of an illuminated manuscript, vivid enough to endure a thousand years unchanged.Roger was suddenly conscious of Claire Randall, standing near his elbow.She was looking at her daughter, with an expression in which love, pride, and something else were mingledmemory, perhaps?He realized, with a slight shock, that Jamie Fraser too must have had not only the striking height and Viking red hair he had bequeathed to his daughter, but likely the same sheer physical presence.It was quite remarkable, he thought.She didnt do or say anything so out of the ordinary, and yet Brianna undeniably drew people.There was some attraction about her, almost magnetic, that drew everyone near into the glow of her orbit.It drew him; Brianna turned and smiled at him, and without consciousness of having moved, he found himself near enough to see the faint freckles high on her cheekbones, and smell the whiff of pipe tobacco that lingered in her hair from her expeditions to the shops.Hullo, he said, smiling.Any luck with the Clans office, or have you been too busy playing dogsbody for Fiona?Dogsbody?Briannas eyes slanted into blue triangles of amusement.Dogsbody?First Im a Sassenach, and now Im a dogsbody.What do you Scots call people when youre trying to be nice?Darrrrlin, he said, rolling his rs exaggeratedly, and making both girls laugh.You sound like an Aberdeen terrier in a bad mood, Claire observed.Did you find anything at the Highland Clans library, Bree?Lots of stuff, Brianna replied, rummaging through the stack of photocopies she had set down on the hall table.I managed to read most of it while they were making the copiesthis one was the most interesting.She pulled a sheet from the stack and handed it to Roger.It was an extract from a book of Highland legends; an entry headed Leap O the Cask.Legends?said Claire, peering over his shoulder.Is that what we want?Could be.Roger was perusing the sheet, and spoke absently, his attention divided.So far as the Scottish Highlands go, most of the history is oral, up to the mid nineteenth century or so.That means there wasnt a great distinction made between stories about real people, stories of historical figures, and the stories about mythical things like water horses and ghosts and the doings of the Auld Folk.Scholars who wrote the stories down often didnt know for sure which they were dealing with, eithersometimes it was a combination of fact and myth, and sometimes you could tell that it was a real historical occurrence being described.This one, for instancehe passed the paper to Claire sounds like a real one.Its describing the story behind the name of a particular rock formation in the Highlands.Claire brushed the hair behind her ear and bent her head to read, squinting in the dim light of the ceiling fixture.Fiona, too accustomed to musty papers and boring bits of history to be interested, disappeared back into her kitchen to see to the dinner.Leap O the Cask, Claire read.This unusual formation, located some distance above a burn, is named after the story of a Jacobite laird and his servant.The laird, one of the few fortunates to escape the disaster of Culloden, made his way with difficulty to his home, but was compelled to lie hidden in a cave on his lands for nearly seven years, while the English hunted the Highlands for the fugitive supporters of Charles Stuart.The lairds tenants loyally kept his presence a secret, and brought food and supplies to the laird in his hiding place.They were careful always to refer to the hidden man only as the Dunbonnet, in order to avoid any chance of giving him away to the English patrols who frequently crossed the district.One day, a boy bringing a cask of ale up the trail to the lairds cave met a group of English dragoons.Bravely refusing either to answer the soldiers questions, or to give up his burden, the boy was attacked by one of the dragoons, and dropped the cask, which bounded down the steep hill, and into the burn below.She looked up from the paper, raising her eyebrows at her daughter.Why this one?We knowor we think we know, she corrected, with a wry nod toward Roger, that Jamie escaped from Culloden, but so did a lot of other people.What makes you think this laird might have been Jamie?Because of the Dunbonnet bit, of course, Brianna answered, as though surprised that she should ask.What?Roger looked at her, puzzled.What about the Dunbonnet?In answer, Brianna picked up a hank of her thick red hair and waggled it under his nose.Dunbonnet!she said impatiently.A dull brown bonnet, right?He wore a hat all the time, because he had hair that could be recognized!Didnt you say the English called him Red Jamie?They knew he had red hairhe had to hide it!Roger stared at her, speechless.The hair floated loose on her shoulders, alive with fiery light.You could be right, Claire said.Excitement made her eyes bright as she looked at her daughter.It was like yoursJamies hair was just like yours, Bree.She reached up and softly stroked Briannas hair.The girls face softened as she looked down at her mother.I know, she said.I was thinking about that while I was readingtrying to see him, you know?She stopped and cleared her throat, as though something might be caught in it.I could see him, out in the heather, hiding, and the sun shining off his hair.You said hed been an outlaw; I justI just thought he must have known pretty wellhow to hide.If people were trying to kill him, she finished softly.Right.Roger spoke briskly, to dispel the shadow in Briannas eyes.Thats a marvelous job of guesswork, but maybe we can tell for sure, with a little more work.If we can find Leap O the Cask on a map  What kind of dummy do you think I am?Brianna said scornfully.I thought of that.The shadow disappeared, replaced by an expression of smugness.Thats why I was so late; I made the clerk drag out every map of the Highlands they had.She withdrew another photocopied sheet from the stack and poked a finger triumphantly near the upper edge.See?Its so tiny, it doesnt show up on most maps, but this one had it.Right there; theres the village of Broch Mordha, which Mama says is near the Lallybroch estate, and thereher finger moved a quarter inch, pointing to a line of microscopic print.See?she repeated.He went back to his estateLallybrochand thats where he hid.Not having a magnifying glass to hand, Ill take your word for it that that says Leap O the Cask, Roger said, straightening up.He grinned at Brianna.Congratulations, then, he said.I think youve found himthat far, at least.Brianna smiled, her eyes suspiciously bright.Yeah, she said softly.She touched the two sheets of paper with a gentle finger.My father.Claire squeezed her daughters hand.If you have your fathers hair, its nice to see you have your mothers brains, she said, smiling.Lets go and celebrate your discovery with Fionas dinner.Good job, Roger said to Brianna, as they followed Claire toward the dining room.His hand rested lightly on her waist.You should be proud of yourself.Thanks, she said, with a brief smile, but the pensive expression returned almost at once to the curve of her mouth.What is it?Roger asked softly, stopping in the hall.Is something the matter?No, not really.She turned to face him, a small line visible between the ruddy brows.Its onlyI was just thinking, trying to imaginewhat do you think it was like for him?Living in a cave for seven years?And what happened to him then?Moved by an impulse, Roger leaned forward and kissed her lightly between the brows.I dont know, darlin, he said.But maybe well find out.PART TWO    Lallybroch   4  THE DUNBONNET  Lallybroch   November 1752  He came down to the house once a month to shave, when one of the boys brought him word it was safe.Always at night, moving soft footed as a fox through the dark.It seemed necessary, somehow, a small gesture toward the concept of civilization.He would slip like a shadow through the kitchen door, to be met with Ians smile or his sisters kiss, and would feel the transformation begin.The basin of hot water, the freshly stropped razor would be laid ready for him on the table, with whatever there was for shaving soap.Now and then it was real soap, if Cousin Jared had sent some from France; more often just half rendered tallow, eye stinging with lye.He could feel the change begin with the first scent of the kitchenso strong and rich, after the wind thin smells of loch and moor and woodbut it wasnt until he had finished the ritual of shaving that he felt himself altogether human once more.They had learned not to expect him to talk until he had shaved; words came hard after a months solitude.Not that he could think of nothing to say; it was more that the words inside formed a logjam in his throat, battling each other to get out in the short time he had.He needed those few minutes of careful grooming to pick and choose, what he would say first and to whom.There was news to hear and to ask aboutof English patrols in the district, of politics, of arrests and trials in London and Edinburgh.That he could wait for.Better to talk to Ian about the estate, to Jenny about the children.If it seemed safe, the children would be brought down to say hello to their uncle, to give him sleepy hugs and damp kisses before stumbling back to their beds.Hell be getting a man soon had been his first choice of conversation when he came in September, with a nod toward Jennys eldest child, his namesake.The ten year old sat at the table with a certain constraint, immensely conscious of the dignity of his temporary position as man of the house.Aye, all I needs another of the creatures to worry over, his sister replied tartly, but she touched her sons shoulder in passing, with a pride that belied her words.Have ye word from Ian, then?His brother in law had been arrestedfor the fourth timethree weeks before, and taken to Inverness under suspicion of being a Jacobite sympathizer.Jenny shook her head, bringing a covered dish to set before him.The thick warm smell of partridge pie drifted up from the pricked crust, and made his mouth water so heavily, he had to swallow before he could speak.Its naught to fret for, Jenny said, spooning out the pie onto his plate.Her voice was calm, but the small vertical line between her brows deepened.Ive sent Fergus to show them the deed of sasine, and Ians discharge from his regiment.Theyll send him home again, so soon as they realize he isna the laird of Lallybroch, and theres naught to be gained by deviling him.With a glance at her son, she reached for the ale jug.Precious chance they have of provin a wee bairn to be a traitor.Her voice was grim, but held a note of satisfaction at the thought of the English courts confusion.The rain spattered deed of sasine that proved transfer of the title of Lallybroch from the elder James to the younger had made its appearance in court before, each time foiling the Crowns attempt to seize the estate as the property of a Jacobite traitor.He would feel it begin to slip away when he leftthat thin veneer of humanitymore of it gone with each step away from the farmhouse.Sometimes he would keep the illusion of warmth and family all the way to the cave where he hid; other times it would disappear almost at once, torn away by a chill wind, rank and acrid with the scent of burning.The English had burned three crofts, beyond the high field.Pulled Hugh Kirby and Geoff Murray from their firesides and shot them by their own doorsteps, with no question or word of formal accusation.Young Joe Fraser had escaped, warned by his wife, who had seen the English coming, and had lived three weeks with Jamie in the cave, until the soldiers were well away from the districtand Ian with them.In October, it had been the older lads he spoke to; Fergus, the French boy he had taken from a Paris brothel, and Rabbie MacNab, the kitchenmaids son, Ferguss best friend.He had drawn the razor slowly down one cheek and round the angle of his jaw, then wiped the lathered blade against the edge of the basin.From the corner of one eye, he caught a faint glimpse of fascinated envy on the face of Rabbie MacNab.Turning slightly, he saw that the three boysRabbie, Fergus, and Young Jamiewere all watching him intently, mouths slightly open.Have ye no seen a man shave before?he asked, cocking one brow.Rabbie and Fergus glanced at each other, but left it to Young Jamie, as titular owner of the estate, to answer.Oh, wellaye, Uncle, he said, blushing.ButI m meanhe stammered slightly and blushed even harderwith my Da gone, and even when hes home, we dinna see him shave himself always, and well, youve just such a lot of hair on your face, Uncle, after a whole month, and its only were so glad to see you again, and  It dawned on Jamie quite suddenly that to the boys he must seem a most romantic figure.Living alone in a cave, emerging at dark to hunt, coming down out of the mist in the night, filthy and wild haired, beard all in a fierce red sproutyes, at their age, it likely seemed a glamorous adventure to be an outlaw and live hidden in the heather, in a dank, cramped cave.At fifteen and sixteen and ten, they had no notion of guilt or bitter loneliness, of the weight of a responsibility that could not be relieved by action.They might understand fear, of a sort.Fear of capture, fear of death.Not the fear of solitude, of his own nature, fear of madness.Not the constant, chronic fear of what his presence might do to themif they thought about that risk at all, they dismissed it, with the casual assumption of immortality that was the right of boys.Aye, well, he had said, turning casually back to the looking glass as Young Jamie stuttered to a halt.Man is born to sorrow and whiskers.One of the plagues of Adam.Of Adam?Fergus looked openly puzzled, while the others tried to pretend they had the slightest idea what Jamie was talking about.Fergus, as a Frenchie, was not expected to know everything.Oh, aye.Jamie pulled his upper lip down over his teeth and scraped delicately beneath his nose.In the beginning, when God made man, Adams chin was as hairless as Eves.And their bodies both smooth as a newborn childs, he added, seeing Young Jamies eyes dart toward Rabbies crotch.Beardless Rabbie still was, but the faint dark down on his upper lip bespoke new sproutings elsewhere.But when the angel wi the flaming sword drove them out of Eden, no sooner had they passed the gate of the garden, when the hair began to sprout and itch on Adams chin, and ever since, man has been cursed with shaving.He finished his own chin with a final flourish, and bowed theatrically to his audience.But what about the other hair?Rabbie demanded.Ye dinna shave there!Young Jamie giggled at the thought, going red again.And a damn good thing, too, his elder namesake observed.Yed need the devil of a steady hand.No need of a looking glass, though, he added, to a chorus of giggles.What about the ladies?Fergus said.His voice broke on the word ladies, in a bullfrog croak that made the other two laugh harder.Certainly les filles have hair there, too, but they do not shave itusually not, anyway, he added, clearly thinking of some of the sights of his early life in the brothel.Jamie heard his sisters footsteps coming down the hall.Oh, well, thats no a curse, he told his rapt audience, picking up the basin and tossing the contents neatly through the open window.God gave that as a consolation to man.If yeve ever the privilege of seeing a woman in her skin, gentlemen, he said, looking over his shoulder toward the door and lowering his voice confidentially, yell observe that the hair there grows in the shape of an arrowpointing the way, ye ken, so as a poor ignorant man can find his way safe home.He turned grandly away from the guffawing and sniggers behind him, to be struck suddenly with shame as he saw his sister, coming down the hall with the slow, waddling stride of advanced pregnancy.She was holding the tray with his supper on top of her swelling stomach.How could he have demeaned her so, for a crude jest and the sake of a moments camaraderie with the boys?Be still!he had snapped at the boys, who stopped giggling abruptly and stared at him in puzzlement.He hastened forward to take the tray from Jenny and set it on the table.It was a savoury made of goats meat and bacon, and he saw Ferguss prominent Adams apple bob in the slender throat at the smell of it.He knew they saved the best of the food for him; it didnt take much looking at the pinched faces across the table.When he came, he brought what meat he could, snared rabbits or grouse, sometimes a nest of plovers eggsbut it was never enough, for a house where hospitality must stretch to cover the needs of not only family and servants, but the families of the murdered Kirby and Murray.At least until spring, the widows and children of his tenants must bide here, and he must do his best to feed them.Sit down by me, he said to Jenny, taking her arm and gently guiding her to a seat on the bench beside him.She looked surprisedit was her habit to wait on him when he camebut sat down gladly enough.It was late, and she was tired; he could see the dark smudges beneath her eyes.With great firmness, he cut a large slab of the savoury and set the plate before her.But thats all for you!Jenny protested.Ive eaten.Not enough, he said.Ye need morefor the babe, he added, with inspiration.If she would not eat for herself, she would for the child.She hesitated a moment longer, but then smiled at him, picked up her spoon, and began to eat.Now it was November, and the chill struck through the thin shirt and breeches he wore.He hardly noticed, intent on his tracking.It was cloudy, but with a thin layered mackerel sky, through which the full moon shed plenty of light.Thank God it wasnt raining; impossible to hear through the pattering of raindrops, and the pungent scent of wet plants masked the smell of animals.His nose had grown almost painfully acute through the long months of living outdoors; the smells of the house sometimes nearly knocked him down when he stepped inside.He wasnt quite close enough to smell the musky scent of the stag, but he heard the telltale rustle of its brief start when it scented him.Now it would be frozen, one of the shadows that rippled across the hillside around him, under the racing clouds.He turned as slowly as he possibly could toward the spot where his ears had told him the stag stood.His bow was in his hand, an arrow ready to the string.He would have one shotmaybewhen the stag bolted.Yes, there!His heart sprang into his throat as he saw the antlers, pricking sharp and black above the surrounding gorse.He steadied himself, took a deep breath, and then the one step forward.The crash of a deers flight was always startlingly loud, to frighten back a stalker.This stalker was prepared, though.He neither startled nor pursued, but stood his ground, sighting along the shaft of the arrow, following with his eye the track of the springing deer, judging the moment, holding fire, and then the bowstring slapped his wrist with stinging force.It was a clean shot, just behind the shoulder, and a good thing, too; he doubted he had the strength to run down a full grown stag.It had fallen in a clear spot behind a clump of gorse, legs stuck out, stiff as sticks, in the oddly helpless way of dying ungulates.The hunters moon lit its glazing eye, so the soft dark stare was hidden, the mystery of its dying shielded by blank silver.He pulled the dirk from his belt and knelt by the deer, hastily saying the words of the gralloch prayer.Old John Murray, Ians father, had taught him.His own fathers mouth had twisted slightly, hearing it, from which he gathered that this prayer was perhaps not addressed to the same God they spoke to in church on Sunday.But his father had said nothing, and he had mumbled the words himself, scarcely noticing what he said, in the nervous excitement of feeling old Johns hand, steady on his own, for the first time pressing down the knife blade into hairy hide and steaming flesh.Now, with the sureness of practice, he thrust up the sticky muzzle in one hand, and with the other, slit the deers throat.The blood spurted hot over knife and hand, pumping two or three times, the jet dying away to a steady stream as the carcass drained, the great vessels of the throat cut through.Had he paused to think, he might not have done it, but hunger and dizziness and the cold fresh intoxication of the night had taken him far past the point of thinking.He cupped his hands beneath the running stream and brought them steaming to his mouth.The moon shone black on his cupped, spilling hands, and it was as though he absorbed the deers substance, rather than drank it.The taste of the blood was salt and silver, and the heat of it was his own.There was no startlement of hot or cold as he swallowed, only the taste of it, rich in his mouth, and the head swimming, hot metal smell, and the sudden clench and rumble of his belly at the nearness of food.He closed his eyes and breathed, and the cold damp air came back, between the hot reek of the carcass and his senses.He swallowed once, then wiped the back of his hand across his face, cleaned his hands on the grass, and set about the business at hand.There was the sudden effort of moving the limp, heavy carcass, and then the gralloch, the long stroke of mingled strength and delicacy that slit the hide between the legs, but did not penetrate the sac that held the entrails.He forced his hands into the carcass, a hot wet intimacy, and again there was an effortful tug that brought out the sac, slick and moon shining in his hands.A slash above and another below, and the mass slid free, the transformation of black magic that changed a deer to meat.It was a small stag, although it had points to its antlers.With luck, he could carry it alone, rather than leave it to the mercy of foxes and badgers until he could bring help to move it.He ducked a shoulder under one leg, and slowly rose, grunting with effort as he shifted the burden to a solid resting place across his back.The moon cast his shadow on a rock, humped and fantastic, as he made his slow, ungainly way down the hill.The deers antlers bobbed above his shoulder, giving him in shadowed profile the semblance of a horned man.He shivered slightly at the thought, remembering tales of witches sabbats, where the Horned One came, to drink the sacrifice of goats or roosters blood.He felt a little queasy, and more than a little light headed.More and more, he felt the disorientation, the fragmenting of himself between day and night.By day, he was a creature of the mind alone, as he escaped his damp immobility by a stubborn, disciplined retreat into the avenues of thought and meditation, seeking refuge in the pages of books.But with the rising of the moon, all sense fled, succumbing at once to sensation, as he emerged into the fresh air like a beast from its lair, to run the dark hills beneath the stars, and hunt, driven by hunger, drunk with blood and moonlight.He stared at the ground as he walked, night sight keen enough to keep his footing, despite the heavy burden.The deer was limp and cooling, its stiff, soft hair scratching against the back of his neck, and his own sweat cooling in the breeze, as though he shared his preys fate.It was only as the lights of Lallybroch manor came into view that he felt at last the mantle of humanity fall upon him, and mind and body joined as one again as he prepared himself to greet his family.5  TO US A CHILD IS GIVEN  Three weeks later, there was still no word of Ians return.No word of any kind, in fact.Fergus had not come to the cave in several days, leaving Jamie in a fret of worry over how things might be at the house.If nothing else, the deer he had shot would have gone long since, with all the extra mouths to feed, and there would be precious little from the kailyard at this time of year.He was sufficiently worried to risk an early visit, checking his snares and coming down from the hills just before sunset.Just in case, he was careful to pull on the woolen bonnet, knitted of rough dun yarn, that would hide his hair from any telltale fingering of late sunbeams.His size alone might provoke suspicion, but not certainty, and he had full confidence in the strength of his legs to carry him out of harms way should he have the ill luck to meet with an English patrol.Hares in the heather were little match for Jamie Fraser, given warning.The house was strangely quiet as he approached.There was none of the usual racket made by children: Jennys five, and the six bairns belonging to the tenants, to say nothing of Fergus and Rabbie MacNab, who were a long way from being too old to chase each other round the stables, screeching like fiends.The house felt strangely empty round him, as he paused just inside the kitchen door.He was standing in the back hall, the pantry to one side, the scullery to the other, and the main kitchen just beyond.He stood stock still, reaching out with all his senses, listening as he inhaled the overpowering smells of the house.No, there was someone here; the faint sound of a scrape, followed by a soft, regular clinking came from behind the cloth padded door that kept the heat of the kitchen from seeping out into the chilly back pantry.It was a reassuringly domestic sound, so he pushed open the door cautiously, but without undue fear.His sister, Jenny, alone and vastly pregnant, was standing at the table, stirring something in a yellow bowl.What are you doing in here?Wheres Mrs.Coker?His sister dropped the spoon with a startled shriek.Jamie!Pale faced, she pressed a hand to her breast and closed her eyes.Christ!Ye scairt the bowels out of me.She opened her eyes, dark blue like his own, and fixed him with a penetrating stare.And what in the name of the Holy Mother are ye doing here now?I wasna expecting ye for a week at least.Fergus hasna come up the hill lately; I got worried, he said simply.Yere a sweet man, Jamie.The color was coming back into her face.She smiled at her brother and came close to hug him.It was an awkward business, with the impending baby in the way, but pleasant, nonetheless.He rested his cheek for a moment on the sleek darkness of her head, breathing in her complex aroma of candle wax and cinnamon, tallow soap and wool.There was an unusual element to her scent this evening; he thought she was beginning to smell of milk.Where is everyone?he asked, releasing her reluctantly.Well, Mrs.Cokers dead, she answered, the faint crease between her brows deepening.Aye?he said softly, and crossed himself.Im sorry for it.Mrs.Coker had been first housemaid and then housekeeper for the family, since the marriage of his own parents, forty odd years before.When?Yesterday forenoon.Twasnt unexpected, poor soul, and it was peaceful.She died in her own bed, like she wanted, and Father McMurtry prayin over her.Jamie glanced reflexively toward the door that led to the servants rooms, off the kitchen.Is she still here?His sister shook her head.No.I told her son they should have the wake here at the house, but the Cokers thought, everything being like it isher small moue encompassed Ians absence, lurking Redcoats, refugee tenants, the dearth of food, and his own inconvenient presence in the cavethey thought better to have it at Broch Mordha, at her sisters place.So thats where everyones gone.I told them I didna feel well enough to go, she added, then smiled, raising an impish brow.But it was really that I wanted a few hours peace and quiet, wi the lot of them gone.And here Ive come, breakin in on your peace, Jamie said ruefully.Shall I go?No, clot heid, his sister said affably.Sit ye down, and Ill get on wi the supper.Whats to eat, then?he asked, sniffing hopefully.Depends on what yeve brought, his sister replied.She moved heavily about the kitchen, taking things from cupboard and hutch, pausing to stir the large kettle hung over the fire, from which a thin steam was rising.If yeve brought meat, well have it.If not, its brose and hough.He made a face at this; the thought of boiled barley and shin beef, the last remnants of the salted beef carcass theyd bought two months before, was unappealing.Just as well I had luck, then, he said.He upended his game bag and let the three rabbits fall onto the table in a limp tumble of gray fur and crumpled ears.And blackthorn berries, he added, tipping out the contents of the dun bonnet, now stained inside with the rich red juice.Jennys eyes brightened at the sight.Hare pie, she declared.Theres no currants, but the berries will do even better, and theres enough butter, thank God.Catching a tiny blink of movement among the gray fur, she slapped her hand down on the table, neatly obliterating the minuscule intruder.Take them out and skin em, Jamie, or the kitchen will be hopping wi fleas.Returning with the skinned carcasses, he found the piecrust well advanced, and Jenny with smears of flour on her dress.Cut them into collops and break the bones for me, will ye, Jamie?she said, frowning at Mrs.McClintocks Receipts for Cookery and Pastry Work, laid open on the table beside the pie pan.Surely ye can make hare pie without looking in the wee book?he said, obligingly taking the big bone crushing wooden mallet from the top of the hutch where it was kept.He grimaced as he took it into his hand, feeling the weight of it.It was very like the one that had broken his right hand several years before, in an English prison, and he had a sudden vivid memory of the shattered bones in a hare pie, splintered and cracked, leaking salty blood and marrow sweetness into the meat.Aye, I can, his sister answered abstractedly, thumbing through the pages.Its only that when ye havena got half the things ye need to make a dish, sometimes theres something else youll come across in here, that ye can use instead.She frowned at the page before her.Ordinarily, Id use claret in the sauce, but weve none in the house, save one of Jareds casks in the priest hole, and I dinna want to broach that yetwe might need it.He didnt need telling what she might use it for.A cask of claret might grease the skids for Ians releaseor at least pay for news of his welfare.He stole a sidewise glance at the great round of Jennys belly.It wasnt for a man to say, but to his not inexperienced eyes, she looked damn near her time.Absently, he reached over the kettle and swished the blade of his dirk to and fro in the scalding liquid, then pulled it out and wiped it clean.Whyever did ye do that, Jamie?He turned to find Jenny staring at him.The black curls were coming undone from their ribbon, and it gave him a pang to see the glimmer of a single white hair among the ebony.Oh, he said, too obviously offhand as he picked up one carcass, Claireshe told me ye ought to wash off a blade in boiling water before ye touched food with it.He felt rather than saw Jennys eyebrows rise.She had asked him about Claire only once, when he had come home from Culloden, half conscious and mostly dead with fever.She is gone, he had said, and turned his face away.Dinna speak her name to me again.Loyal as always, Jenny had not, and neither had he.He could not have said what made him say it today; unless perhaps it was the dreams.He had them often, in varying forms, and it always unsettled him the day after, as though for a moment Claire had really been near enough to touch, and then had drawn away again.He could swear that sometimes he woke with the smell of her on him, musky and rich, pricked with the sharp, fresh scents of leaves and green herbs.He had spilled his seed in his sleep more than once while dreaming, an occurrence that left him faintly shamed and uneasy in mind.To distract both of them, he nodded at Jennys stomach.How close is it?he asked, frowning at her swollen midsection.Ye look like a puffball mushroomone touch, and poof!He flicked his fingers wide in illustration.Oh, aye?Well, and I could wish it was as easy as poof.She arched her back, rubbing at the small of it, and making her belly protrude in an alarming fashion.He pressed back against the wall, to give it room.As for when, anytime, I expect.No telling for sure.She picked up the cup and measured out the flour; precious little left in the bag, he noted with some grimness.Send up to the cave when it starts, he said suddenly.Ill come down, Redcoats or no.Jenny stopped stirring and stared at him.You?Why?Well, Ians not here, he pointed out, picking up one skinned carcass.With the expertise of long practice, he neatly disjointed a thigh and cut it free from the backbone.Three quick smacks with the boning mallet and the pale flesh lay flattened and ready for the pie.And a great lot of help hed be if he was, Jenny said.He took care of his part o the business nine months ago.She wrinkled her nose at her brother and reached for the plate of butter.Mmphm.He sat down to continue his work, which brought her belly close to his eye level.The contents, awake and active, was shifting to and fro in a restless manner, making her apron twitch and bulge as she stirred.He couldnt resist reaching out to put a light hand against the monstrous curve, to feel the surprising strong thrusts and kicks of the inhabitant, impatient of its cramped confinement.Send Fergus for me when its time, he said again.She looked down at him in exasperation and batted his hand away with the spoon.Have I no just been telling ye, I dinna need ye?For Gods sake, man, have I not enough to worry me, wi the house full of people, and scarce enough to feed them, Ian in gaol in Inverness, and Redcoats crawling in at the windows every time I look round?Should I have to worry that yell be taken up, as well?Ye needna be worrit for me; Ill take care.He didnt look at her, but focused his attention on the forejoint he was slicing through.Well, then, have a care and stay put on the hill.She looked down her long, straight nose, peering at him over the rim of the bowl.Ive had six bairns already, aye?Ye dinna think I can manage by now?No arguing wi you, is there?he demanded.No, she said promptly.So youll stay.Ill come.Jenny narrowed her eyes and gave him a long, level look.Yere maybe the most stubborn gomerel between here and Aberdeen, no?A smile spread across her brothers face as he looked up at her.Maybe so, he said.He reached across and patted her heaving belly.And maybe no.But Im coming.Send Fergus when its time.It was near dawn three days later that Fergus came panting up the slope to the cave, missing the trail in the dark, and making such a crashing through the gorse bushes that Jamie heard him coming long before he reached the opening.Milord he began breathlessly as he emerged by the head of the trail, but Jamie was already past the boy, pulling his cloak around his shoulders as he hurried down toward the house.But, milord Ferguss voice came behind him, panting and frightened.Milord, the soldiers  Soldiers?He stopped suddenly and turned, waiting impatiently for the French lad to make his way down the slope.What soldiers?he demanded, as Fergus slithered the last few feet.English dragoons, milord.Milady sent me to tell youon no account are you to leave the cave.One of the men saw the soldiers yesterday, camped near Dunmaglas.Damn.Yes, milord.Fergus sat down on a rock and fanned himself, narrow chest heaving as he caught his breath.Jamie hesitated, irresolute.Every instinct fought against going back into the cave.His blood was heated by the surge of excitement caused by Ferguss appearance, and he rebelled at the thought of meekly crawling back into hiding, like a grub seeking refuge beneath its rock.Mmphm, he said.He glanced down at Fergus.The changing light was beginning to outline the boys slender form against the blackness of the gorse, but his face was still a pale smudge, marked with a pair of darker smudges that were his eyes.A certain suspicion was stirring in Jamie.Why had his sister sent Fergus at this odd hour?If it had been necessary urgently to warn him about the dragoons, it would have been safer to send the boy up during the night.If the need was not urgent, why not wait until the next night?The answer to that was obviousbecause Jenny thought she might not be able to send him word the next night.How is it with my sister?he asked Fergus.Oh, well, milord, quite well!The hearty tone of this assurance confirmed all Jamies suspicions.Shes having the child, no?he demanded.No, milord!Certainly not!Jamie reached down and clamped a hand on Ferguss shoulder.The bones felt small and fragile beneath his fingers, reminding him uncomfortably of the rabbits he had broken for Jenny.Nonetheless, he forced his grip to tighten.Fergus squirmed, trying to ease away.Tell me the truth, man, Jamie said.No, milord!Truly!The grip tightened inexorably.Did she tell you not to tell me?Jennys prohibition must have been a literal one, for Fergus answered this question with evident relief.Yes, milord!Ah.He relaxed his grip and Fergus sprang to his feet, now talking volubly as he rubbed his scrawny shoulder.She said I must not tell you anything except about the soldiers, milord, for if I did, she would cut off my cods and boil them like turnips and sausage!Jamie could not repress a smile at this threat.Short of food we may be, he assured his protg, but not that short.He glanced at the horizon, where a thin line of pink showed pure and vivid behind the black pines silhouette.Come along, then; itll be full light in half an hour.There was no hint of silent emptiness about the house this dawn.Anyone with half an eye could see that things were not as usual at Lallybroch; the wash kettle sat on its plinth in the yard, with the fire gone out under it, full of cold water and sodden clothes.Moaning cries from the barnlike someone being strangledindicated that the sole remaining cow urgently required milking.An irritable blatting from the goat shed let him know that the female inhabitants would like some similar attention as well.As he came into the yard, three chickens ran past in a feathery squawk, with Jehu the rat terrier in close pursuit.With a quick dart, he leaped forward and booted the dog, catching it just under the ribs.It flew into the air with a look of intense surprise on its face, then, landing with a yip, picked itself up and made off.He found the children, the older boys, Mary MacNab, and the other housemaid, Sukie, all crammed into the parlor, under the watchful eye of Mrs.Kirby, a stern and rock ribbed widow, who was reading to them from the Bible.And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression, read Mrs.Kirby.There was a loud, rolling scream from upstairs, that seemed to go on and on.Mrs.Kirby paused for a moment, to allow everyone to appreciate it, before resuming the reading.Her eyes, pale gray and wet as raw oysters, flickered toward the ceiling, then rested with satisfaction on the row of strained faces before her.Notwithstanding, she shall be saved in childbearing, if she continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety, she read.Kitty burst into hysterical sobbing and buried her head in her sisters shoulder.Maggie Ellen was growing bright red beneath her freckles, while her elder brother had gone dead white at the scream.Mrs.Kirby, said Jamie.Be still, if ye please.The words were civil enough, but the look in his eyes must have been the one that Jehu saw just before his boot assisted flight, for Mrs.Kirby gasped and dropped the Bible, which landed on the floor with a papery thump.Jamie bent and picked it up, then showed Mrs.Kirby his teeth.The expression evidently was not successful as a smile, but had some effect nonetheless.Mrs.Kirby went quite pale, and put a hand to her ample bosom.Perhaps yed go to the kitchen and make yourself useful, he said, with a jerk of his head that sent Sukie the kitchenmaid scuttling out like a windblown leaf.With considerably more dignity, but no hesitation, Mrs.Kirby rose and followed her.Heartened by this small victory, Jamie disposed of the parlors other occupants in short order, sending the widow Murray and her daughters out to deal with the wash kettle, the smaller children out to catch chickens under the supervision of Mary MacNab.The older lads departed, with obvious relief, to tend the stock.The room empty at last, he stood for a moment, hesitating as to what to do next.He felt obscurely that he should stay in the house, on guard, though he was acutely aware that he couldas Jenny had saiddo nothing to help, whatever happened.There was an unfamiliar mule hobbled in the dooryard; presumably the midwife was upstairs with Jenny.Unable to sit, he prowled restlessly around the parlor, the Bible in his hand, touching things.Jennys bookshelf, battered and scarred from the last incursion of Redcoats, three months ago.The big silver epergne.That was slightly dented, but had been too heavy to fit in a soldiers knapsack, and so had escaped the pilfering of smaller objects.Not that the English had got so much; the few truly valuable items, along with the tiny store of gold they had left, were safely tucked away in the priest hole with Jareds wine.Hearing a prolonged moan from above, he glanced down involuntarily at the Bible in his hand.Not really wanting to, still he let the book fall open, showing the page at the front where the marriages, births, and deaths of the family were recorded.The entries began with his parents marriage.Brian Fraser and Ellen MacKenzie.The names and the date were written in his mothers fine round hand, with underneath, a brief notation in his fathers firmer, blacker scrawl.Marrit for love, it saida pointed observation, in view of the next entry, which showed Willies birth, which had occurred scarcely two months past the date of the marriage.Jamie smiled, as always, at sight of the words, and glanced up at the painting of himself, aged two, standing with Willie and Bran, the huge deerhound.All that was left of Willie, who had died of the smallpox at eleven.The painting had a slash through the canvasthe work of a bayonet, he supposed, taking out its owners frustration.And if ye hadna died, he said softly to the picture, then what?Then what, indeed.Closing the book, his eye caught the last entryCaitlin Maisri Murray, born December 3, 1749, died December 3, 1749.Aye, if.If the Redcoats had not come on December 2, would Jenny have borne the child too early?If they had had enough food, so that she, like the rest of them, was no more than skin and bones and the bulge of her belly, would that have helped?No telling, is there?he said to the painting.Willies painted hand rested on his shoulder; he had always felt safe, with Willie standing behind him.Another scream came from upstairs, and a spasm of fear clenched his hands on the book.Pray for us, Brother, he whispered, and crossing himself, laid down the Bible and went out to the barn to help with the stock.There was little to do here; Rabbie and Fergus between them were more than able to take care of the few animals that remained, and Young Jamie, at ten, was big enough to be a substantial help.Looking about for something to do, Jamie gathered up an armful of scattered hay and took it down the slope to the midwifes mule.When the hay was gone, the cow would have to be slaughtered; unlike the goats, it couldnt get enough forage on the winter hills to sustain it, even with the picked grass and weeds the small children brought in.With luck, the salted carcass would last them through til spring.As he came back into the barn, Fergus looked up from his manure fork.This is a proper midwife, of good repute?Fergus demanded.He thrust out a long chin aggressively.Madame should not be entrusted to the care of a peasant, surely!How should I know?Jamie said testily.Dye think I had anything to do wi engaging midwives?Mrs.Martin, the old midwife who had delivered all previous Murray children, had diedlike so many othersduring the famine in the year following Culloden.Mrs.Innes, the new midwife, was much younger; he hoped she had sufficient experience to know what she was doing.Rabbie seemed inclined to join the argument as well.He scowled blackly at Fergus.Aye, and what dye mean peasant?Yere a peasant, too, or have ye not noticed?Fergus stared down his nose at Rabbie with some dignity, despite the fact that he was forced to tilt his head backward in order to do so, he being several inches shorter than his friend.Whether I am a peasant or not is of no consequence, he said loftily.I am not a midwife, am I?No, yere a fiddle ma fyke!Rabbie gave his friend a rough push, and with a sudden whoop of surprise, Fergus fell backward, to land heavily on the stable floor.In a flash, he was up.He lunged at Rabbie, who sat laughing on the edge of the manger, but Jamies hand snatched him by the collar and pulled him back.None of that, said his employer.I willna have ye spoilin what little hays left.He set Fergus back on his feet, and to distract him, asked, And what dye ken of midwives anyway?A great deal, milord.Fergus dusted himself off with elegant gestures.Many of the ladies at Madame Elises were brought to bed while I was there  I daresay they were, Jamie interjected dryly.Or is it childbed ye mean?Childbed, certainly.Why, I was born there myself!The French boy puffed his narrow chest importantly.Indeed.Jamies mouth quirked slightly.Well, and I trust ye made careful observations at the time, so as to say how such matters should be arranged?Fergus ignored this piece of sarcasm.Well, of course, he said, matter of factly, the midwife will naturally have put a knife beneath the bed, to cut the pain.Im none so sure she did that, Rabbie muttered.At least it doesna sound much like it.Most of the screaming was inaudible from the barn, but not all of it.And an egg should be blessed with holy water and put at the foot of the bed, so that the woman shall bring forth the child easily, Fergus continued, oblivious.He frowned.I gave the woman an egg myself, but she did not appear to know what to do with it.And I had been keeping it especially for the last month, too, he added plaintively, since the hens scarcely lay anymore.I wanted to be sure of having one when it was needed.Now, following the birth, he went on, losing his doubts in the enthusiasm of his lecture, the midwife must brew a tea of the placenta, and give it to the woman to drink, so that her milk will flow strongly.Rabbie made a faint retching sound.Of the afterbirth, ye mean?he said disbelievingly.God!Jamie felt a bit queasy at this exhibition of modern medical knowledge himself.Aye, well, he said to Rabbie, striving for casualness, they eat frogs, ye know.And snails.I suppose maybe afterbirth isna so strange, considering.Privately, he wondered whether it might not be long before they were all eating frogs and snails, but thought that a speculation better kept to himself.Rabbie made mock puking noises.Christ, whod be a Frenchie!Fergus, standing close to Rabbie, whirled and shot out a lightning fist.Fergus was small and slender for his age, but strong for all that, and with a deadly aim for a mans weak points, knowledge acquired as a juvenile pickpocket on the streets of Paris.The blow caught Rabbie squarely in the wind, and he doubled over with a sound like a stepped on pigs bladder.Speak with respect of your betters, if you please, Fergus said haughtily.Rabbies face turned several shades of red and his mouth opened and closed like a fishs, as he struggled to get his breath back.His eyes bulged with a look of intense surprise, and he looked so ridiculous that it was a struggle for Jamie not to laugh, despite his worry over jenny and his irritation at the boys squabbling.Will ye wee doiters no keep your paws off he began, when he was interrupted by a cry from Young Jamie, who had until now been silent, fascinated by the conversation.What?Jamie whirled, hand going automatically to the pistol he carried whenever he left the cave, but there was not, as he had half expected, an English patrol in the stableyard.What the hell is it?he demanded.Then, following Young Jamies pointing finger, he saw them.Three small black specks, drifting across the brown crumple of dead vines in the potato field.Ravens, he said softly, and felt the hair rise on the back of his neck.For those birds of war and slaughter to come to a house during a birth was the worst sort of ill luck.One of the filthy beasts was actually settling on the rooftree, as he watched.With no conscious thought, he took the pistol from his belt and braced the muzzle across his forearm, sighting carefully.It was a long shot, from the door of the stable to the rooftree, and sighted upward, too.Still  The pistol jerked in his hand and the raven exploded in a cloud of black feathers.Its two companions shot into the air as though blown there by the explosion, and flapped madly away, their hoarse cries fading quickly on the winter air.Mon Dieu!Fergus exclaimed.Cest bien, a!Aye, bonny shooting, sir.Rabbie, still red faced and a little breathless, had recovered himself in time to see the shot.Now he nodded toward the house, pointing with his chin.Look, sir, is that the midwife?It was.Mrs.Innes poked her head out of the second story window, fair hair flying loose as she leaned out to peer into the yard below.Perhaps she had been drawn by the sound of the shot, fearing some trouble.Jamie stepped into the stableyard and waved at the window to reassure her.Its all right, he shouted.Only an accident.He didnt mean to mention the ravens, lest the midwife tell Jenny.Come up!she shouted, ignoring this.The bairns born, and your sister wants ye!Jenny opened one eye, blue and slightly slanted like his own.So ye came, aye?I thought someone should be hereif only to pray for ye, he said gruffly.She closed the eye and a small smile curved her lips.She looked, he thought, very like a painting he had seen in Francean old one by some Italian fellow, but a good picture, nonetheless.Yere a silly fooland Im glad of it, she said softly.She opened her eyes and glanced down at the swaddled bundle she held in the crook of her arm.Dye want to see him?Oh, a him, is it?With hands experienced by years of unclehood, he lifted the tiny package and cuddled it against himself, pushing back the flap of blanket that shaded its face.Its eyes were closed tight shut, the lashes not visible in the deep crease of the eyelids.The eyelids themselves lay at a sharp angle above the flushed smooth rounds of the cheeks, giving promise that it mightin this one recognizable feature, at leastresemble its mother.The head was oddly lumpy, with a lopsided appearance that made Jamie think uncomfortably of a kicked in melon, but the small fat mouth was relaxed and peaceful, the moist pink underlip quivering faintly with the snore attendant on the exhaustion of being born.Hard work, was it?he said, speaking to the child, but it was the mother who answered him.Aye, it was, Jenny said.Theres whisky in the armoirewill ye fetch me a glass?Her voice was hoarse and she had to clear her throat before finishing the request.Whisky?Should ye not be having ale wi eggs beaten up in it?he asked, repressing with some difficulty a mental vision of Ferguss suggestion of appropriate sustenance for newly delivered mothers.Whisky, his sister said definitely.When ye were lyin downstairs crippled and your leg killin ye, did I give ye ale wi eggs beaten up in it?Ye fed me stuff a damn sight worse than that, her brother said, with a grin, but yere right, ye gave me whisky, too.He laid the sleeping child carefully on the coverlet, and turned to get the whisky.Has he a name, yet?he asked, nodding toward the baby as he poured out a generous cup of the amber liquid.Ill call him Ian, for his Da.Jennys hand rested gently for a moment on the rounded skull, lightly furred with a gold brown fuzz.A pulse beat visibly in the soft spot on top; it seemed hideously fragile to Jamie, but the midwife had assured him the babe was a fine, lusty lad, and he supposed he must take her word for it.Moved by an obscure impulse to protect that nakedly exposed soft spot, he picked up the baby once more, pulling the blanket up over its head.Mary MacNab told me about you and Mrs.Kirby, Jenny remarked, sipping.Pity I didna see itshe said the wretched auld besom nearly swallowed her tongue when ye spoke to her.Jamie smiled in return, gently patting the babys back as it lay against his shoulder.Dead asleep, the little body lay inert as a boneless ham, a soft comforting weight.Too bad she didnt.How can ye stand the woman, living in the same house wi ye?Id strangle her, were I here every day.His sister snorted and closed her eyes, tilting her head back to let the whisky slide down her throat.Ah, folk fash ye as much as ye let them; I dinna let her, much.Still, she added, opening her eyes, I canna say as Ill be sorry to be rid of her.I have it in my mind to palm her off on auld Kettrick, down at Broch Mordha.His wife and his daughter both died last year, and hell be wanting someone to do for him.Aye, but if I were Samuel Kettrick, Id take the widow Murray, Jamie observed, not the widow Kirby.Peggy Murrays already provided for, his sister assured him.Shell wed Duncan Gibbons in the spring.Thats fast work for Duncan, he said, a little surprised.Then a thought occurred to him, and he grinned at her.Do either o them know it yet?No, she said, grinning back.Then the smile faded into a speculative look.Unless you were thinking of Peggy yourself, that is?Me?Jamie was as startled as if she had suddenly suggested he might wish to jump out of the second story window.Shes only five and twenty, Jenny pursued.Young enough for more bairns, and a good mother.How much of that whisky have ye had?Her brother bent forward and pretended to examine the level of the decanter, cupping the babys head in one palm to prevent it wobbling.He straightened up and gave his sister a look of mild exasperation.Im living like an animal in a cave, and ye wish me to take a wife?He felt suddenly hollow inside.To prevent her seeing that the suggestion had upset him, he rose and walked up and down the room, making unnecessary small humming noises to the bundle in his arms.How long is it since yeve lain wi a woman, Jamie?his sister asked conversationally behind him.Shocked, he turned on his heel to stare at her.What the hell sort of question is that to ask a man?Youve not gone wi any of the unwed lasses between Lallybroch and Broch Mordha, she went on, paying no attention.Or Id have heard of it.None of the widows, either, I dinna think?She paused delicately.Ye know damn well I havent, he said shortly.He could feel his cheeks flushing with annoyance.Why not?his sister asked bluntly.Why not?He stared at her, his mouth slightly open.Have ye lost your senses?What dye think, Im the sort of man would slink about from house to house, bedding any woman who didna drive me out wi a girdle in her hand?As if they would.No, youre a good man, Jamie.Jenny smiled, half sadly.Ye wouldna take advantage of any woman.Yed marry first, no?No!he said violently.The baby twitched and made a sleepy sound, and he transferred it automatically to his other shoulder, patting, as he glared at his sister.I dinna mean to marry again, so ye just abandon all thought of matchmaking, Jenny Murray!I willna have it, dye hear?Oh, I hear, she said, unperturbed, She pushed herself higher on the pillow, so as to look him in the eye.Ye mean to live a monk to the end of your days?she asked.Go to your grave wi no son to bury you or bless your name?Mind your own business, damn ye!Heart pounding, he turned his back on her and strode to the window, where he stood staring sightlessly out over the stableyard.I ken ye mourn Claire.His sisters voice came softly from behind him.Dye think I could forget Ian, if he doesna come back?But its time ye went on, Jamie.Ye dinna think Claire would mean ye to live alone all your life, with no one to comfort ye or bear your children?He didnt answer for a long time, just stood, feeling the soft heat of the small fuzzy head pressed against the side of his neck.He could see himself dimly in the misted glass, a tall dirty gangle of a man, the round white bundle incongruous beneath his own grim face.She was with child, he said softly at last, speaking to the reflection.When shewhen I lost her.How else could he put it?There was no way to tell his sister, where Claire waswhere he hoped she was.That he could not think of another woman, hoping that Claire still lived, even knowing her truly lost to him for good.There was a long silence from the bed.Then Jenny said quietly, Is that why ye came today?He sighed and turned sideways toward her, leaning his head against the cool glass.His sister was lying back, her dark hair loose on the pillow, eyes gone soft as she looked at him.Aye, maybe, he said.I couldna help my wife; I suppose I thought I might help you.Not that I could, he added, with some bitterness.I am as useless to you as I was to her.Jenny stretched out a hand to him, face filled with distress.Jamie, mo chridhe, she said, but then stopped, eyes widening in sudden alarm as a splintering crash and the sound of screams came from the house below.Holy Mary!she said, growing even whiter.Its the English!Christ.It was as much a prayer as an exclamation of surprise.He glanced quickly from the bed to the window, judging the possibilities of hiding versus those of escape.The sounds of booted feet were already on the stair.The cupboard, Jamie!Jenny whispered urgently, pointing.Without hesitation, he stepped into the armoire, and pulled the door to behind him.The door of the chamber sprang open with a crash a moment later, to be filled with a red coated figure in a cocked hat, holding a drawn sword before him.The Captain of dragoons paused, and darted his eyes all round the chamber, finally settling on the small figure in the bed.Mrs.Murray?he said.Jenny struggled to pull herself upright.I am.And what in flaming hell are ye doing in my house?she demanded.Her face was pale and shiny with sweat, and her arms trembled, but she held her chin up and glared at the man.Get out!Disregarding her, the man moved into the room and over to the window; Jamie could see his indistinct form disappear past the edge of the wardrobe, then reappear, back turned as he spoke to Jenny.One of my scouts reported hearing a shot from the vicinity of this house, not long since.Where are your men?I have none.Her trembling arms would not support her longer, and Jamie saw his sister ease herself back, collapsing on the pillows.Youve taken my husband alreadymy eldest son is no more than ten.She did not mention Rabbie or Fergus; boys of their age were old enough to be treatedor mistreatedas men, should the Captain take the notion.With luck, they would have taken to their heels at the first sight of the English.The Captain was a hard bitten man of middle age, and not overly given to credulity.The keeping of weapons in the Highlands is a serious offense, he said, and turned to the soldier who had come into the room behind him.Search the house, Jenkins.He had to raise his voice in the giving of the order, for there was a rising commotion in the stairwell.As Jenkins turned to leave the room, Mrs.Innes, the midwife, burst past the soldier who tried to bar her way.Leave the poor lady alone!she cried, facing the Captain with fists clenched at her sides.The midwifes voice shook and her hair was coming down from its snood, but she stood her ground.Get out, ye wretches!Leave her be!I am not mistreating your mistress, the Captain said, with some irritation, evidently mistaking Mrs.Innes for one of the maids.I am merely  And her not delivered but an hour since!It isna decent even for ye to lay eyes on her, so much as  Delivered?The Captains voice sharpened, and he glanced from the midwife to the bed in sudden interest.You have borne a child, Mrs.Murray?Where is the infant?The infant in question stirred inside its wrappings, disturbed by the tightened grip of its horror stricken uncle.From the depths of the wardrobe, he could see his sisters face, white to the lips and set like stone.The child is dead, she said.The midwifes mouth dropped open in shock, but luckily the Captains attention was riveted on Jenny.Oh?he said slowly.Was it  Mama!The cry of anguish came from the doorway as Young Jamie broke free of a soldiers grip and hurled himself at his mother.Mama, the babys dead?No, no!Sobbing, he flung himself on his knees and buried his head in the bedclothes.As though to refute his brothers statement, baby Ian gave evidence of his living state by kicking his legs with considerable vigor against his uncles ribs and emitting a series of small snuffling grunts, which fortunately went unheard in the commotion outside.Jenny was trying to comfort Young Jamie, Mrs.Innes was futilely attempting to raise the boy, who kept a death grip on his mothers sleeve, the Captain was vainly trying to make himself heard above Young Jamies grief stricken wails, and over all, the muted sound of boots and shouting vibrated through the house.Jamie rather thought the Captain was inquiring as to the location of the infants body.He clutched the body in question closer, joggling it in an attempt to prevent any disposition on its part to cry.His other hand went to the hilt of his dirk, but it was a vain gesture; it was doubtful that even cutting his own throat would be of help, if the wardrobe were opened.Baby Ian made an irascible noise, suggesting that he disliked being joggled.With visions of the house in flames and the inhabitants slaughtered, the noise sounded as loud to Jamie as his elder nephews anguished howls.You did it!Young Jamie had gotten to his feet, face wet and swollen with tears and rage, and was advancing on the Captain, curly black head lowered like a small rams.You killed my brother, ye English prick!The Captain was somewhat taken aback by this sudden attack, and actually took a step back, blinking at the boy.No, boy, youre quite mistaken.Why, I only  Prick!Cod!A mhic an diabhoil!Entirely beside himself, Young Jamie was stalking the Captain, yelling every obscenity he had ever heard used, in Gaelic or English.Enh, said baby Ian in the elder Jamies ear.Enh, enh!This sounded very much like the preliminary to a full fledged screech, and in a panic, Jamie let go of his dirk and thrust his thumb into the soft, moist opening from which the sounds were issuing.The babys toothless gums clamped onto his thumb with a ferocity that nearly made him exclaim aloud.Get out!Get out!Get out or Ill kill ye!Young Jamie was screaming at the Captain, face contorted with rage.The Redcoat looked helplessly at the bed, as though to ask Jenny to call off this implacable small foe, but she lay as though dead with her eyes closed.I shall wait for my men downstairs, the Captain said, with what dignity he could, and withdrew, shutting the door hastily behind him.Deprived of his enemy, Young Jamie fell to the floor and collapsed into helpless weeping.Through the crack in the door, Jamie saw Mrs.Innes look at Jenny, mouth opening to ask a question.Jenny shot up from the bedclothes like Lazarus, scowling ferociously, finger pressed to her lips to enjoin silence.Baby Ian champed viciously at the thumb, growling at its failure to yield any sustenance.Jenny swung herself to the side of the bed and sat there, waiting.The sounds of the soldiers below throbbed and eddied through the house.Jenny was shaking with weakness, but she reached out a hand toward the armoire where her men lay hidden.Jamie drew a deep breath and braced himself.It would have to be risked; his hand and wrist were wet with saliva, and the babys growls of frustration were growing louder.He stumbled from the wardrobe, drenched with sweat, and thrust the infant at Jenny.Baring her breast with a single wrench, she pressed the small head to her nipple, and bent over the tiny bundle, as though to protect it.The beginnings of a squawk disappeared into the muffled sounds of vigorous sucking, and Jamie sat down on the floor quite suddenly, feeling as though someone had run a sword behind his knees.Young Jamie had sat up at the sudden opening of the wardrobe, and now sat spraddled against the door, his face blank with bewildered shock as he looked from his mother to his uncle and back again.Mrs.Innes knelt beside him, whispering urgently in his ear, but no sign of comprehension showed on the small, tear streaked face.By the time shouts and the creaking of harness outside betokened the soldiers departure, Young Ian lay replete and snoring in his mothers arms.Jamie stood by the window, just out of sight, watching them go.The room was silent, save for the liquid noise of Mrs.Innes, drinking whisky.Young Jamie sat close against his mother, cheek pressed to her shoulder.She had not looked up once since taking the baby, and still sat, head lowered over the child in her lap, her black hair hiding her face.Jamie stepped forward and touched her shoulder.The warmth of her seemed shocking, as though cold dread were his natural state and the touch of another person somehow foreign and unnatural.Ill go to the priest hole, he said softly, and to the cave when its dark.Jenny nodded, but without looking up at him.There were several white hairs among the black, he saw, glinting silver by the parting down the center of her head.I thinkI should not come down again, he said at last.For a time.Jenny said nothing, but nodded once more.6  BEING NOW JUSTIFIED BY HIS BLOOD  As it was, he did come down to the house once more.For two months, he stayed close hidden in the cave, scarcely daring to come out at night to hunt, for the English soldiers were still in the district, quartered at Comar.The troops went out by day in small patrols of eight or ten, combing the countryside, looting what little there was to steal, destroying what they could not use.And all with the blessing of the English Crown.A path led close by the base of the hill where his cavern was concealed.No more than a rude track, it had begun as a deer path, and still largely served that use, though it was a foolish stag that would venture within smelling distance of the cave.Still, sometimes when the wind was right, he would see a small group of the red deer on the path, or find fresh spoor in the exposed mud of the track next day.It was helpful as well for such people as had business on the mountainsidefew enough as those were.The wind had been blowing downwind from the cave, and he had no expectation of seeing deer.He had been lying on the ground just within the cave entrance, where enough light filtered through the overhanging screen of gorse and rowan for him to read on fine days.There were not a great many books, but Jared managed still to smuggle a few with his gifts from France.This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which would else have drowned my cave.After I had been in my cave some time, and found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more composed; and now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store and took a small sup of rum, which however, I did then and always very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.It continued raining all that night, and great part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began to think  The shadows across the page moved as the bushes above him stirred.Instincts attuned, he caught the shift of the wind at onceand on it, the sound of voices.He sprang to his feet, hand on the dirk that never left his side.Barely pausing to put the book carefully on its ledge, he grasped the knob of granite that he used as a handhold and pulled himself up into the steep narrow crevice that formed the caves entrance.The bright flash of red and metal on the path below hit him with a blow of shock and annoyance.Damn.He had little fear that any of the soldiers would leave the paththey were poorly equipped for making their way even through the normal stretches of open, spongy peat and heather, let alone an overgrown, brambly slope like thisbut having them so close meant he could not risk leaving the cave before dark, even to get water or relieve himself.He cast a quick glance at his water jug, knowing as he did so that it was nearly empty.A shout pulled his attention back to the track below, and he nearly lost his grip on the rock.The soldiers had bunched themselves around a small figure, humped under the weight of a small cask it bore on its shoulder.Fergus, on his way up with a cask of fresh brewed ale.Damn, and damn again.He could have done with that ale; it had been months since hed had any.The wind had changed again, so he caught only small snatches of words, but the small figure seemed to be arguing with the soldier in front of him, gesticulating violently with its free hand.Idiot!said Jamie, under his breath.Give it to them and begone, ye wee clot!One soldier made a two handed grab at the cask, and missed as the small dark haired figure jumped nimbly back.Jamie smacked himself on the forehead with exasperation.Fergus could never resist insolence when confronted with authorityespecially English authority.The small figure now was skipping backward, shouting something at his pursuers.Fool!Jamie said violently.Drop it and run!Instead of either dropping the cask or running, Fergus, apparently sure, of his own speed, turned his back on the soldiers and waggled his rump insultingly at them.Sufficiently incensed to risk their footing in the soggy vegetation, several of the Redcoats jumped the path to follow.Jamie saw their leader raise an arm and shout in warning.It had evidently dawned on him that Fergus might be a decoy, trying to lead them into ambush.But Fergus too was shouting, and evidently the soldiers knew enough gutter French to interpret what he was saying, for while several of the men halted at their leaders shout, four of the soldiers hurled themselves at the dancing boy.There was a scuffle and more shouting as Fergus dodged, twisting like an eel between the soldiers.In all the commotion and above the whining wind, Jamie could not have heard the rush of the saber being drawn from its scabbard, but ever after felt as though he had, as though the faint swish and ring of drawn metal had been the first inkling of disaster.It seemed to ring in his ears whenever he remembered the sceneand he remembered it for a very long time.Perhaps it was something in the attitudes of the soldiers, an irritableness of mood that communicated itself to him in the cave.Perhaps only the sense of doom that had clung to him since Culloden, as though everything in his vicinity were tainted; at risk by virtue only of being near him.Whether he had heard the sound of the saber or not, his body had tensed itself to spring before he saw the silver arc of the blade swing through the air.It moved almost lazily, slowly enough for his brain to have tracked its arc, deduced its target, and shouted, wordless, no!Surely it moved slowly enough that he could have darted down into the midst of the swarming men, seized the wrist that wielded the sword and twisted the deadly length of metal free, to tumble harmless to the ground.The conscious part of his brain told him this was nonsense, even as it froze his hands around the granite knob, anchoring him against the overwhelming impulse to heave himself out of the earth and run forward.You cant, it said to him, a thready whisper under the fury and the horror that filled him.He has done this for you; you cannot make it senseless.You cant, it said, cold as death beneath the searing rush of futility that drowned him.You can do nothing.And he did nothing, nothing but watch, as the blade completed its lazy swing, crashed home with a small, almost inconsequential thunk!and the disputed cask tumbled end over end over end down the slope of the burn, its final splash lost in the merry gurgle of brown water far below.The shouting ceased abruptly in shocked silence.He scarcely heard when it resumed; it sounded so much like the roaring in his ears.His knees gave way, and he realized dimly that he was about to faint.His vision darkened into reddish black, shot with stars and streaks of lightbut not even the encroaching dark would blot out the final sight of Ferguss hand, that small and deft and clever pickpockets hand, lying still in the mud of the track, palm turned upward in supplication.He waited for forty eight long, dragging hours before Rabbie MacNab came to whistle on the path below the cave.How is he?he said without preliminary.Mrs.Jenny says hell be all right, Rabbie answered.His young face was pale and drawn; plainly he had not yet recovered from the shock of his friends accident.She says hes not fevered, and theres no trace of rot yet in thehe swallowed audiblyin thestump.The soldiers took him down to the house, then?Not waiting for an answer, he was already making his way down the hillside.Aye, they were all amoil wi itI thinkRabbie paused to distentangle his shirt from a clinging brier, and had to hurry to catch up with his employerI think they were sorry about it.The Captain said so, at least.And he gave Mrs.Jenny a gold sovereignfor Fergus.Oh, aye?Jamie said.Verra generous.And did not speak again, until they reached the house.Fergus was lying in state in the nursery, ensconced in a bed by the window.His eyes were closed when Jamie entered the room, long lashes lying softly against thin cheeks.Seen without its customary animation, his usual array of grimaces and poses, his face looked quite different.The slightly beaked nose above the long, mobile mouth gave him a faintly aristocratic air, and the bones hardening beneath the skin gave some promise that his face might one day pass from boyish charm to outright handsomeness.Jamie moved toward the bed, and the dark lashes lifted at once.Milord, Fergus said, and a weak smile restored his face at once to its familiar contours.You are safe here?God, laddie, Im sorry.Jamie sank to his knees by the bed.He could scarcely bear to look at the slender forearm that lay across the quilt, its frail bandaged wrist ending in nothing, but forced himself to grip Ferguss shoulder in greeting, and rub a palm gently over the shock of dark hair.Does it hurt much?he asked.No, milord, Fergus said.Then a sudden belying twinge of pain crossed his features, and he grinned shamefacedly.Well, not so much.And Madame has been most generous with the whisky.There was a tumbler full of it on the sidetable, but no more than a thimbleful had been drunk.Fergus, weaned on French wine, did not really like the taste of whisky.Im sorry, Jamie said again.There was nothing else to say.Nothing he could say, for the tightening in his throat.He looked hastily down, knowing that it would upset Fergus to see him weep.Ah, milord, do not trouble yourself.There was a note of the old mischief in Ferguss voice.Me, I have been fortunate.Jamie swallowed hard before replying.Aye, youre aliveand thank God for it!Oh, beyond that, milord!He glanced up to see Fergus smiling, though still very pale.Do you not recall our agreement, milord?Agreement?Yes, when you took me into your service in Paris.You told me then that should I be arrested and executed, you would have Masses said for my soul for the space of a year.The remaining hand fluttered toward the battered greenish medal that hung about his neckSt.Dismas, patron saint of thieves.But if I should lose an ear or a hand while doing your service  I would support you for the rest of your life.Jamie was unsure whether to laugh or cry, and contented himself with patting the hand that now lay quiet on the quilt.Aye, I remember.You may trust me to keep the bargain.Oh, I have always trusted you, milord, Fergus assured him.Clearly he was growing tired; the pale cheeks were even whiter than they had been, and the shock of black hair fell back against the pillow.So I am fortunate, he murmured, still smiling.For in one stroke, I am become a gentleman of leisure, non?Jenny was waiting for him when he left Ferguss room.Come down to the priest hole wi me, he said, taking her by the elbow.I need to talk wi ye a bit, and I shouldna stay in the open longer.She followed him without comment, down to the stone floored back hall that separated kitchen and pantry.Set into the flags of the floor was a large wooden panel, perforated with drilled holes, apparently mortared into the floorstones.Theoretically, this gave air to the root cellar below, and in factshould any suspicious person choose to investigate, the root cellar, reached by a sunken door outside the house, did have just such a panel set into its ceiling.What was not apparent was that the panel also gave light and air to a small priest hole that had been built just behind the root cellar, which could be reached by pulling up the panel, mortared frame and all, to reveal a short ladder leading down into the tiny room.It was no more than five feet square, equipped with nothing in the way of furniture beyond a rude bench, a blanket, and a chamber pot.A large jug of water and a small box of hard biscuit completed the chambers accoutrements.It had in fact been added to the house only within the last few years, and therefore was not really a priest hole, as no priest had occupied it or was likely to.A hole it definitely was, though.Two people could occupy the hole only by sitting side by side on the bench, and Jamie sat down beside his sister as soon as he had replaced the panel overhead and descended the ladder.He sat still for a moment, then took a breath and started.I canna bear it anymore, he said.He spoke so softly that Jenny was forced to bend her head close to hear him, like a priest receiving some penitents confession.I cant.I must go.They sat so close together that he could feel the rise and fall of her breast as she breathed.Then she reached out and took hold of his hand, her small firm fingers tight on his.Will ye try France again, then?He had tried to escape to France twice before, thwarted each time by the tight watch the English placed on all ports.No disguise was sufficient for a man of his remarkable height and coloring.He shook his head.No.I shall let myself be captured.Jamie!In her agitation, Jenny allowed her voice to rise momentarily, then lowered it again in response to the warning squeeze of his hand.Jamie, ye canna do that!she said, lower.Christ, man, yell be hangit!He kept his head bent as though in thought, but shook it, not hesitating.I think not.He glanced at his sister, then quickly away.Claireshe had the Sight.As good an explanation as any, he thought, if not quite the real truth.She saw what would happen at Cullodenshe knew.And she told me what would come after.Ah, said Jenny softly.I wondered.So that was why she bade me plant potatoesand build this place.Aye.He gave his sisters hand a small squeeze, then let go and turned slightly on the narrow seat to face her.She told me that the Crown would go on hunting Jacobite traitors for some timeand they have, he added wryly.But that after the first few years, they would no longer execute the men that were capturedonly imprison them.Only!his sister echoed.If ye mun go, Jamie, take to the heather then, but to give yourself up to an English prison, whether theyll hang ye or no  Wait.His hand on her arm stopped her.I havena told it all to ye yet.I dinna mean just to walk up to the English and surrender.Theres a goodly price on my head, no?Be a shame to let that go to waste, dye not think?He tried to force a smile in his voice; she heard it and glanced sharply up at him.Holy Mother, she whispered.So ye mean to have someone betray ye?Seemingly, aye.He had decided upon the plan, alone in the cave, but it had not seemed quite real until now.I thought perhaps Joe Fraser would be best for it.Jenny rubbed her fist hard against her lips.She was quick; he knew she had grasped the plan at onceand all its implications.But Jamie, she whispered.Even if they dinna hang ye outrightand thats the hell of a risk to takeJamie, ye could be killed when they take ye!His shoulders slumped suddenly, under the weight of misery and exhaustion.God, Jenny, he said, dye think I care?There was a long silence before she answered.No, I dont, she said.And I canna say as I blame ye, either.She paused a moment, to steady her voice.But I still care.Her fingers gently touched the back of his head, stroking his hair.So yell mind yourself, wont ye, clot heid?The ventilation panel overhead darkened momentarily, and there was the tapping sound of light footsteps.One of the kitchenmaids, on her way to the pantry, perhaps.Then the dim light came back, and he could see Jennys face once more.Aye, he whispered at last.Ill mind.It took more than two months to complete the arrangements.When at last word came, it was full spring.He sat on his favorite rock, near the caves entrance, watching the evening stars come out.Even in the worst of the year after Culloden, he had always been able to find a moment of peace at this time of the day.As the daylight faded, it was as though objects became faintly lit from within, so they stood outlined against sky or ground, perfect and sharp in every detail.He could see the shape of a moth, invisible in the light, now limned in the dusk with a triangle of deeper shadow that made it stand out from the trunk it hid upon.In a moment, it would take wing.He looked out across the valley, trying to stretch his eyes as far as the black pines that edged the distant cliffside.Then up, among the stars.Orion there, striding stately over the horizon.And the Pleiades, barely visible in the darkening sky.It might be his last sight of the sky for some time, and he meant to enjoy it.He thought of prison, of bars and locks and solid walls, and remembered Fort William.Wentworth Prison.The Bastille.Walls of stone, four feet thick, that blocked all air and light.Filth, stench, hunger, entombment  He shrugged such thoughts away.He had chosen his way, and was satisfied with it.Still, he searched the sky, looking for Taurus.Not the prettiest of constellations, but his own.Born under the sign of the bull, stubborn and strong.Strong enough, he hoped, to do what he intended.Among the growing night sounds, there was a sharp, high whistle.It might have been the homing song of a curlew on the loch, but he recognized the signal.Someone was coming up the patha friend.It was Mary MacNab, who had become kitchenmaid at Lallybroch, after the death of her husband.Usually it was her son Rabbie, or Fergus, who brought him food and news, but she had come a few times before.She had brought a basket, unusually well supplied, with a cold roast partridge, fresh bread, several young green onions, a bunch of early cherries, and a flask of ale.Jamie examined the bounty, then looked up with a wry smile.My farewell feast, eh?She nodded, silent.She was a small woman, dark hair heavily streaked with gray, and her face lined by the difficulties of life.Still, her eyes were soft and brown, and her lips still full and gently curved.He realized that he was staring at her mouth, and hastily turned again to the basket.Lord, Ill be so full Ill not be able to move.Even a cake, now!However did ye ladies manage that?She shruggedshe wasnt a great chatterer, Mary MacNaband taking the basket from him, proceeded to lay the meal on the wooden tabletop, balanced on stones.She laid places for both of them.This was nothing out of the ordinary; she had supped with him before, to give him the gossip of the district while they ate.Still, if this was his last meal before leaving Lallybroch, he was surprised that neither his sister nor the boys had come to share it.Perhaps the farmhouse had visitors that would make it difficult for them to leave undetected.He gestured politely for her to sit first, before taking his own place, crosslegged on the hard dirt floor.Yeve spoken wi Joe Fraser?Where is it to be, then?he asked, taking a bite of cold partridge.She told him the details of the plan; a horse would be brought before dawn, and he would ride out of the narrow valley by way of the pass.Then turn, cross the rocky foothills and come down, back into the valley by Feesyhants Burn, as though he were coming home.The English would meet him somewhere between Struy and Eskadale, most likely at Midmains; it was a good place for an ambush, for the glen rose steeply there on both sides, but with a wooded patch by the stream where several men could conceal themselves.After the meal, she packed the basket tidily, leaving out enough food for a small breakfast before his dawn leaving.He expected her to go then, but she did not.She rummaged in the crevice where he kept his bedding, spread it neatly upon the floor, turned back the blankets and knelt beside the pallet, hands folded on her lap.He leaned back against the wall of the cave, arms folded.He looked down at the crown of her bowed head in exasperation.Oh, like that, is it?he demanded.And whose idea was this?Yours, or my sisters?Does it matter?She was composed, her hands perfectly still on her lap, her dark hair smooth in its snood.He shook his head and bent down to pull her to her feet.No, it doesna matter, because its no going to happen.I appreciate your meaning, but  His speech was interrupted by her kiss.Her lips were as soft as they looked.He grasped her firmly by both wrists and pushed her away from him.No!he said.It isna necessary, and I dinna want to do it.He was uncomfortably aware that his body did not agree at all with his assessments of necessity, and still more uncomfortable at the knowledge that his breeches, too small and worn thin, made the magnitude of the disagreement obvious to anyone who cared to look.The slight smile curving those full, sweet lips suggested that she was looking.He turned her toward the entrance and gave her a light push, to which she responded by stepping aside and reaching behind her for the fastenings to her skirt.Dont do that!he exclaimed.How dye mean to stop me?she asked, stepping out of the garment and folding it tidily over the single stool.Her slender fingers went to the laces of her bodice.If ye wont leave, then Ill have to, he replied with decision.He whirled on his heel and headed for the cave entrance, when he heard her voice behind him.My lord!she said.He stopped, but did not turn around.It isna suitable to call me that, he said.Lallybroch is yours, she said.And will be so long as ye live.If yere its laird, Ill call ye so.It isna mine.The estate belongs to Young Jamie.It isna Young Jamie thats doing what you are, she answered with decision.And it isna your sister thats asked me to do what Im doin.Turn round.He turned, reluctantly.She stood barefoot in her shift, her hair loose over her shoulders.She was thin, as they all were these days, but her breasts were larger than he had thought, and the nipples showed prominently through the thin fabric.The shift was as worn as her other garments, frayed at the hem and shoulders, almost transparent in spots.He closed his eyes.He felt a light touch on his arm, and willed himself to stand still.I ken weel enough what yere thinkin, she said.For I saw your lady, and I know how it was between the two of ye.I never had that, she added, in a softer voice, not wi either of the two men I wed.But I know the look of a true love, and its not in my mind to make ye feel yeve betrayed it.The touch, feather light, moved to his cheek, and a work worn thumb traced the groove that ran from nose to mouth.What I want, she said quietly, is to give ye something different.Something less, mayhap, but something ye can use; something to keep ye whole.Your sister and the bairns canna give ye thatbut I can.He heard her draw breath, and the touch on his face lifted away.Yeve given me my home, my life, and my son.Will ye no let me gie ye this small thing in return?He felt tears sting his eyelids.The weightless touch moved across his face, wiping the moisture from his eyes, smoothing the roughness of his hair.He lifted his arms, slowly, and reached out.She stepped inside his embrace, as neatly and simply as she had laid the table and the bed.Ihavena done this in a long time, he said, suddenly shy.Neither have I, she said, with a tiny smile.But well remember how tis.PART THREE    When I Am Thy Captive   7  A FAITH IN DOCUMENTS  Inverness   May 25, 1968  The envelope from Linklater arrived in the morning post.Look how fat it is!Brianna exclaimed.Hes sent something!The tip of her nose was pink with excitement.Looks like it, said Roger.He was outwardly calm, but I could see the pulse beating in the hollow of his throat.He picked up the thick manila envelope and held it for a moment, weighing it.Then he ripped the flap recklessly with his thumb, and yanked out a sheaf of photocopied pages.The cover letter, on heavy university stationery, fluttered out.I snatched it from the floor and read it aloud, my voice shaking a little.Dear Dr.Wakefield, I read.This is in reply to your inquiry regarding the execution of Jacobite officers by the Duke of Cumberlands troops following the Battle of Culloden.The main source of the quote in my book to which you refer, was the private journal of one Lord Melton, in command of an infantry regiment under Cumberland at the time of Culloden.I have enclosed photocopies of the relevant pages of the journal; as you will see, the story of the survivor, one James Fraser, is an odd and touching one.Fraser is not an important historical character, and not in line with the thrust of my own work, but I have often thought of investigating further, in hopes of determining his eventual fate.Should you find that he did survive the journey to his own estate, I should be happy if you would inform me.I have always rather hoped that he did, though his situation as described by Melton makes the possibility seem unlikely.Sincerely yours, Eric Linklater.The paper rattled in my hand, and I set it down, very carefully, on the desk.Unlikely, huh?Brianna said, standing on tiptoe to see over Rogers shoulder.Ha!He did make it back, we know he did!We think he did, Roger corrected, but it was only scholarly caution; his grin was as broad as Briannas.Will ye be havin tea or cocoa to your elevenses?Fionas curly dark head poked through the study doorway, interrupting the excitement.Theres fresh ginger nut biscuits, just baked.The scent of warm ginger came into the study with her, wafting enticingly from her apron.Tea, please, said Roger, just as Brianna said, Oh, cocoa sounds great!Fiona, wearing a smug expression, pushed in the tea cart, sporting both tea cozy and pot of cocoa, as well as a plate of fresh ginger nut biscuits.I accepted a cup of tea myself, and sat down in the wing chair with the pages of Meltons journal.The flowing eighteenth century handwriting was surprisingly clear, in spite of the archaic spelling, and within minutes, I was in the confines of Leanach farmhouse, imagining the sound of buzzing flies, the stir of close packed bodies, and the harsh smell of blood soaking into the packed dirt floor.in satisfaction of my brothers debt of honor, I could not do otherwise than to spare Frasers life.I therefore omitted his name from the list of traitors executed at the farmhouse, and have made arrangement for his transport to his own estate.I cannot feel myself either altogether merciful toward Fraser in the taking of this action, nor yet altogether culpable with respect to my service toward the Duke, as Frasers situation, with a great wound in his leg festering and pustulent, makes it unlikely that he will survive the journey to his home.Still, honor prevents my acting otherwise, and I will confess that my spirit was lightened to see the man removed, still living, from the field, as I turned my own attentions to the melancholy task of disposing of the bodies of his comrades.So much killing as I have seen these last two days oppresses me, the entry ended simply.I laid the pages down on my knee, swallowing heavily.A great woundfestering and pustulent I knew, as Roger and Brianna could not, just how serious such a wound would have been, with no antibiotics, nothing in the way of proper medical treatment; not even the crude herbal poultices available to a Highland charmer at the time.How long would it have taken, jolting from Culloden to Broch Tuarach in a wagon?Two days?Three?How could he have lived, in such a state, and neglected for so long?He did, though.Briannas voice broke in upon my thoughts, answering what seemed to be a similar thought expressed by Roger.She spoke with simple assurance, as though she had seen all the events described in Meltons journal, and were sure of their outcome.He did get back.He was the Dunbonnet, I know it.The Dunbonnet?Fiona, tut tutting over my cold cup of undrunk tea, looked over her shoulder in surprise.Heard of the Dunbonnet, have ye?Have you?Roger looked at the young housekeeper in astonishment.She nodded, casually dumping my tea into the aspidistra that stood by the hearth and refilling my cup with fresh steaming brew.Oh, aye.My grannie tellt me that tale, often and often.Tell us!Brianna leaned forward, intent, her cocoa cupped between her palms.Please, Fiona!Whats the story?Fiona seemed mildly surprised to find herself suddenly the center of so much attention, but shrugged good naturedly.Och, its just the story of one o the followers o the Bonnie Prince.When there was the great defeat at Culloden, and sae many were killed, a few escaped.Why, one man fled the field and swam the river to get away, but the Redcoats were after him, nonetheless.He came to a kirk along his way, and a service going on inside, and he dashing in, prayed mercy from the minister.The minister and the people took pity on him, and he put on the ministers robe, so when the Redcoats burst in moments later, there he was, standing at the pulpit, preachin the sermon, and the water from his beard and clothes puddled up about his feet.The Redcoats thought they were mistaken, and went on down the road, and so he escapedand everyone in the kirk said twas the best sermon they ever heard!Fiona laughed heartily, while Brianna frowned, and Roger looked puzzled.That was the Dunbonnet?he said.But I thought  Och, no!she assured him.That was no the Dunbonnetonly the Dunbonnet was another o the men who got away from Culloden.He came back to his own estate, but because the Sassenachs were hunting men all across the Highlands, he lay hidden there in a cave for seven years.Hearing this, Brianna slumped back in her chair with a sigh of relief.And his tenants called him the Dunbonnet so as not to speak his name and betray him, she murmured.Ye ken the story?Fiona asked, astonished.Aye, thats right.And did your grannie say what happened to him after that?Roger prompted.Oh, aye!Fionas eyes were round as butterscotch drops.Thats the best part o the story.See, there was a great famine after Culloden; folk were starvin in the glens, turned out of their houses in winter, the men shot and the cots set afire.The Dunbonnets tenants managed better than most, but even so, there came a day when the food ran out, and their bellies garbeled from dawn til darkno game in the forest, nay grain in the field, and the weans dyin in their mothers arms for lack o milk to feed them.A cold chill swept over me at her words.I saw the faces of the Lallybroch inhabitantsthe people I had known and lovedpinched with cold and starvation.Not only horror filled me; there was guilt, too.I had been safe, warm, and well fed, instead of sharing their fatebecause I had done as Jamie wanted, and left them.I looked at Brianna, smooth red head bent in absorption, and the tight feeling in my chest eased a bit.She too had been safe for these past years, warm, well fed, and lovedbecause I had done as Jamie wanted.So he made a bold plan, the Dunbonnet did, Fiona was continuing.Her round face was alight with the drama of her tale.He arranged that one of his tenants should go to the English, and offer to betray him.There was a good price on his head, for hed been a great warrior for the Prince.The tenant would take the gold o the rewardto use for the folk on the estate, o courseand tell the English where the Dunbonnet might be taken.My hand clenched so convulsively at this that the delicate handle of my teacup snapped clean off.Taken?I croaked, my voice hoarse with shock.Did they hang him?Fiona blinked at me in surprise.Why, no, she said.They wanted to, my grannie said, and took him to trial for treason, but in the end, they shut him up in a prison insteadbut the gold went to his tenants, and so they lived through the famine, she ended cheerfully, obviously regarding this as the happy ending.Jesus Christ, Roger breathed.He set his cup down carefully, and sat staring into space, transfixed.Prison.You sound like thats good, Brianna protested.The corners of her mouth were tight with distress, and her eyes slightly shiny.It is, Roger said, not noticing her distress.There werent that many prisons where the English imprisoned Jacobite traitors, and they all kept official records.Dont you see?he demanded, looking from Fionas bewilderment to Briannas scowl, then settling on me in hope of finding understanding.If he went to prison, I can find him.He turned then, to look up at the towering shelves of books that lined three walls of the study, holding the late Reverend Wakefields collection of Jacobite arcana.Hes in there, Roger said softly.On a prison roll.In a documentreal evidence!Dont you see?he demanded again, turning back to me.Going to prison made him a part of written history again!And somewhere in there, well find him!And what happened to him then, Brianna breathed.When he was released.Rogers lips pressed tight together, to cut off the alternative that sprang to his mind, as it had to mineor died.Yes, thats right, he said, taking Briannas hand.His eyes met mine, deep green and unfathomable.When he was released.A week later, Rogers faith in documents remained unshaken.The same could not be said for the eighteenth century table in the late Reverend Wakefields study, whose spindly legs wobbled and creaked alarmingly beneath their unaccustomed burden.This table normally was asked to accommodate no more than a small lamp, and a collection of the Reverends smaller artifacts; it was pressed into service now only because every other horizontal surface in the study already overflowed with papers, journals, books, and bulging manila envelopes from antiquarian societies, universities, and research libraries across England, Scotland, and Ireland.If you set one more page on that thing, its going to collapse, Claire observed, as Roger carelessly reached out, meaning to drop the folder he was carrying on the little inlaid table.Ah?Oh, right.He switched direction in midair, looked vainly for another place to put the folder, and finally settled for placing it on the floor at his feet.Ive just about finished with Wentworth, Claire said.She indicated a precarious stack on the floor with her toe.Have we got in the records for Berwick yet?Yes, just this morning.Where did I put them, though?Roger stared vaguely about the room, which strongly resembled the sacking of the library at Alexandria, just before the first torch was lit.He rubbed his forehead, trying to concentrate.After a week of spending ten hour days thumbing the handwritten registers of British prisons, and the letters, journals, and diaries of their governors, searching for any official trace of Jamie Fraser, Roger was beginning to feel as though his eyes had been sandpapered.It was blue, he said at last.I distinctly remember it was blue.I got those from McAllister, the History Lecturer at Trinity at Cambridge, and Trinity College uses those big envelopes in pale blue, with the colleges coat of arms on the front.Maybe Fionas seen it.Fiona!He stepped to the study door and called down the hall toward the kitchen.Despite the lateness of the hour, the light was still on, and the heartening scent of cocoa and freshly baked almond cake lingered in the air.Fiona would never abandon her post while there was the faintest possibility that someone in her vicinity might require nourishment.Och, aye?Fionas curly brown head poked out of the kitchen.Therell be cocoa ready directly, she assured him.Im only waiting for the cake to be out of the oven.Roger smiled at her with deep affection.Fiona had not the slightest use herself for historynever read anything beyond My Weekly magazinebut she never questioned his activities, tranquilly dusting the heaps of books and papers daily, without bothering about their contents.Thanks, Fiona, he said.I was only wondering, though; have you seen a big blue envelopea fat one, about so?He measured with his hands.It came in the morning post, but Ive misplaced it.Ye left it in the upstairs bath, she said promptly.Theres that great thick book wi the gold writing and the picture of the Bonnie Prince on the front up there, and three letters yed just opened, and theres the gas bill, too, which ye dinna want to be forgetting, its due on the fourteenth o the month.Ive put it all on the top of the geyser, so as to be out of the way.A tiny, sharp ding from the oven timer made her withdraw her head abruptly with a smothered exclamation.Roger turned and went up the stairs two at a time, smiling.Given other inclinations, Fionas memory might have made her a scholar.As it was, she was no mean research assistant.So long as a particular document or book could be described on the basis of its appearance, rather than its title or contents, Fiona was bound to know exactly where it was.Och, its nothing, she had assured Roger airily, when he had tried to apologize earlier for the mess he was making of the house.Yed think the Reverend was still alive, wi such a moil of papers strewn everywhere.Its just like old times, no?Coming down more slowly, with the blue envelope in his hands, he wondered what his late adoptive father might have thought of this present quest.In it up to the eyebrows, I shouldnt wonder, he murmured to himself.He had a vivid memory of the Reverend, bald head gleaming under the old fashioned bowl lamps that hung from the hall ceiling, as he pottered from his study to the kitchen, where old Mrs.Graham, Fionas grandmother, would have been manning the stove, supplying the old mans bodily needs during bouts of late night scholarship, just as Fiona was now doing for him.It made one wonder, he thought, as he went into the study.In the old days, when a mans son usually followed his fathers profession, was that only a matter of conveniencewanting to keep the business in the familyor was there some sort of family predisposition for some kinds of work?Were some people actually born to be smiths, or merchants, or cooksborn to an inclination and an aptitude, as well as to the opportunity?Clearly it didnt apply to everyone; there were always the people who left their homes, went a wandering, tried things hitherto unknown in their family circles.If that werent so, probably there would be no inventors, no explorers; still, there seemed to be a certain affinity for some careers in some families, even in these restless modern times of widespread education and easy travel.What he was really wondering about, he thought to himself, was Brianna.He watched Claire, her curly gold shot head bent over the desk, and found himself wondering how much Brianna would be like her, and how much like the shadowy Scotwarrior, farmer, courtier, lairdwho had been her father?His thoughts were still running on such lines a quarter hour later, when Claire closed the last folder on her stack and sat back, sighing.Penny for your thoughts?she asked, reaching for her drink.Not worth that much, Roger replied with a smile, coming out of his reverie.I was only wondering how people come to be what they are.How did you come to be a doctor, for instance?How did I come to be a doctor?Claire inhaled the steam from her cup of cocoa, decided it was too hot to drink, and set it back on the desk, among the litter of books and journals and pencil scribbled sheets of paper.She gave Roger a half smile and rubbed her hands together, dispersing the warmth of the cup.How did you come to be a historian?More or less honestly, he answered, leaning back in the Reverends chair and waving at the accumulation of papers and trivia all around them.He patted a small gilt traveling clock that sat on the desk, an elegant bit of eighteenth century workmanship, with miniature chimes that struck the hour, the quarter, and the half.I grew up in the midst of it all; I was ferreting round the Highlands in search of artifacts with my father from the time I could read.I suppose it just seemed natural to keep doing it.But you?She nodded and stretched, easing her shoulders from the long hours of stooping over the desk.Brianna, unable to stay awake, had given up and gone to bed an hour before, but Claire and Roger had gone on with their search through the administrative records of British prisons.Well, it was something like that for me, she said.It wasnt so much that I suddenly decided I must become a doctorit was just that I suddenly realized one day that Id been one for a long timeand then I wasnt, and I missed it.She spread her hands out on the desk and flexed her fingers, long and supple, the nails buffed into neat, shiny ovals.There used to be an old song from the First World War, she said reflectively.I used to hear it sometimes when some of Uncle Lambs old army friends would come round and stay up late and get drunk.It went, How You Gonna Keep em Down on the Farm, After Theyve Seen Paree?She sang the first line, then broke off with a wry smile.Id seen Paree, she said softly.She looked up from her hands, alert and present, but with the traces of memory in her eyes, fixed on Roger with the clarity of a second sight.And a lot of other things besides.Caen and Amiens, Preston, and Falkirk, the Hpital des Anges and the so called surgery at Leoch.Id been a doctor, in every way there isId delivered babies, set bones, stitched wounds, treated fevers She trailed off, and shrugged.There was a terrible lot I didnt know, of course.I knew how much I could learnand thats why I went to medical school.But it didnt really make a difference, you know.She dipped a finger into the whipped cream floating on her cocoa, and licked it off.I have a diploma with an M. D.  on itbut I was a doctor long before I set foot in medical school.It cant possibly have been as easy as you make it sound.Roger blew on his own cocoa, studying Claire with open interest.There werent many women in medicine thenthere arent that many women doctors now, come to thatand you had a family, besides.No, I cant say it was easy at all.Claire looked at him quizzically.I waited until Brianna was in school, of course, and we had enough money to afford someone to come in to cook and cleanbut She shrugged and smiled ironically.I stopped sleeping for several years, there.That helped a bit.And oddly enough, Frank helped, too.Roger tested his own cup and found it almost cool enough to drink.He held it between his hands, enjoying the heat of the thick white porcelain seeping into his palms.Early June it might be, but the nights were cool enough to make the electric fire still a necessity.Really?he said curiously.Only from the things youve said about him, I shouldnt have thought hed have liked your wanting to go to medical school or be a doctor.He didnt.Her lips pressed tight together; the motion told Roger more than words might, recalling arguments, conversations half finished and abandoned, an opposition of stubbornness and devious obstruction rather than of open disapproval.What a remarkably expressive face she had, he thought, watching her.He wondered quite suddenly whether his own were as easily readable.The thought was so unsettling that he dipped his face into his mug, gulping the cocoa, although it was still a bit too hot.He emerged from the cup to find Claire watching him, slightly sardonic.Why?he asked quickly, to distract her.What made him change his mind?Bree, she said, and her face softened as it always did at the mention of her daughter.Bree was the only thing really important to Frank.I had, as Id said, waited until Brianna began school before beginning medical school myself.But even so, there was a large gap between her hours and my own, which we filled haphazardly with a series of more or less competent housekeepers and baby sitters; some more, most of them less.My mind went back to the frightful day when I had gotten a call at the hospital, telling me that Brianna was hurt.I had dashed out of the place, not pausing to change out of the green linen scrub suit I was wearing, and raced for home, ignoring all speed limits, to find a police car and an ambulance lighting the night with blood red pulses, and a knot of interested neighbors clustered on the street outside.As we pieced the story together later, what had happened was that the latest temporary sitter, annoyed at my being late yet again, had simply put on her coat at quitting time and left, abandoning seven year old Brianna with instructions to wait for Mommy.This she had obediently done, for an hour or so.But as it began to get dark, she had become frightened in the house alone, and determined to go out and find me.Making her way across one of the busy streets near our house, she had been struck by a car turning into the street.She wasntthank God!hurt badly; the car had been moving slowly, and she had only been shaken and bruised by the experience.Not nearly as shaken as I was, for that matter.Nor as bruised, when I came into the living room to find her lying on the sofa, and she looked at me, tears welling afresh on her stained cheeks and said, Mommy!Where were you?I couldnt find you!It had taken just about all my reserves of professional composure to comfort her, to check her over, re tend her cuts and scrapes, thank her rescuerswho, to my fevered mind, all glared accusingly at meand put her to bed with her teddy bear clutched securely in her arms.Then I sat down at the kitchen table and cried myself.Frank patted me awkwardly, murmuring, but then gave it up, and with more practicality, went to make tea.Ive decided, I said, when he set the steaming cup in front of me.I spoke dully, my head feeling thick and clogged.Ill resign.Ill do it tomorrow.Resign?Franks voice was sharp with astonishment.From the school?What for?I cant stand it anymore.I never took cream or sugar in my tea.Now I added both, stirring and watching the milky tendrils swirl through the cup.I cant stand leaving Bree, and not knowing if shes well cared forand knowing she isnt happy.You know she doesnt really like any of the sitters weve tried.I know that, yes.He sat opposite me, stirring his own tea.After a long moment, he said, But I dont think you should resign.It was the last thing I had expected; I had thought he would greet my decision with relieved applause.I stared at him in astonishment, then blew my nose yet again on the wadded tissue from my pocket.You dont?Ah, Claire.He spoke impatiently, but with a tinge of affection nonetheless.Youve known forever who you are.Do you realize at all how unusual it is to know that?No.I wiped my nose with the shredding tissue, dabbing carefully to keep it in one piece.Frank leaned back in his chair, shaking his head as he looked at me.No, I suppose not, he said.He was quiet for a minute, looking down at his folded hands.They were long fingered, narrow; smooth and hairless as a girls.Elegant hands, made for casual gestures and the emphasis of speech.He stretched them out on the table and looked at them as though hed never seen them before.I havent got that, he said quietly at last.Im good, all right.At what I dothe teaching, the writing.Bloody splendid sometimes, in fact.And I like it a good bit, enjoy what I do.But the thing is He hesitated, then looked at me straight on, hazel eyed and earnest.I could do something else, and be as good.Care as much, or as little.I havent got that absolute conviction that theres something in life Im meant to doand you have.Is that good?The edges of my nostrils were sore, and my eyes puffed from crying.He laughed shortly.Its damned inconvenient, Claire.To you and me and Bree, all three.But my God, I do envy you sometimes.He reached out for my hand, and after a moments hesitation, I let him have it.To have that passion for anythinga small twitch tugged the corner of his mouthor anyone.Thats quite splendid, Claire, and quite terribly rare.He squeezed my hand gently and let it go, turning to reach behind him for one of the books on the shelf beside the table.It was one of his references, Woodhills Patriots, a series of profiles of the American Founding Fathers.He laid his hand on the cover of the book, gently, as though reluctant to disturb the rest of the sleeping lives interred there.These were people like that.The ones who cared so terribly muchenough to risk everything, enough to change and do things.Most people arent like that, you know.It isnt that they dont care, but that they dont care so greatly.He took my hand again, this time turning it over.One finger traced the lines that webbed my palm, tickling as it went.Is it there, I wonder?he said, smiling a little.Are some people destined for a great fate, or to do great things?Or is it only that theyre born somehow with that great passionand if they find themselves in the right circumstances, then things happen?Its the sort of thing you wonder, studying historybut theres no way of telling, really.All we know is what they accomplished.But Claire His eyes held a definite note of warning, as he tapped the cover of his book.They paid for it, he said.I know.I felt very remote now, as though I were watching us from a distance; I could see it quite clearly in my minds eye; Frank, handsome, lean, and a little tired, going beautifully gray at the temples.Me, grubby in my surgical scrubs, my hair coming down, the front of my shirt crumpled and stained with Briannas tears.We sat in silence for some time, my hand still resting in Franks.I could see the mysterious lines and valleys, clear as a road mapbut a road to what unknown destination?I had had my palm read once years before, by an old Scottish lady named GrahamFionas grandmother, in fact.The lines in your hand change as you change, she had said.Its no so much what youre born with, as what ye make of yourself.And what had I made of myself, what was I making?A mess, that was what.Neither a good mother, nor a good wife, nor a good doctor.A mess.Once I had thought I was wholehad seemed to be able to love a man, to bear a child, to heal the sickand know that all these things were natural parts of me, not the difficult, troubled fragments into which my life had now disintegrated.But that had been in the past, the man I had loved was Jamie, and for a time, I had been part of something greater than myself.Ill take Bree.I was so deep in miserable thought that for a moment, Franks words didnt register, and I stared at him stupidly.What did you say?I said, he repeated patiently, that Ill take Bree.She can come from her school to the university, and play at my office until Im ready to come home.I rubbed my nose.I thought you didnt think it appropriate for staff to bring their children to work.He had been quite critical of Mrs.Clancy, one of the secretaries, who had brought her grandson to work for a month when his mother was sick.He shrugged, looking uncomfortable.Well, circumstances alter cases.And Briannas not likely to be running up and down the halls shrieking and spilling ink like Bart Clancy.I wouldnt bet my life on it, I said wryly.But youd do that?A small feeling was growing in the pit of my clenched stomach; a cautious, unbelieving feeling of relief.I might not trust Frank to be faithful to meI knew quite well he wasntbut I did trust him unequivocally to care for Bree.Suddenly the worry was removed.I neednt hurry home from the hospital, filled with dread because I was late, hating the thought of finding Brianna crouched in her room sulking because she didnt like the current sitter.She loved Frank; I knew she would be ecstatic at the thought of going to his office every day.Why?I asked bluntly.It isnt that youre dead keen on my being a doctor; I know that.No, he said thoughtfully.It isnt that.But I do think there isnt any way to stop youperhaps the best I can do is to help, so that there will be less damage to Brianna.His features hardened slightly then, and he turned away.So far as he ever felt he had a destinysomething he was really meant to dohe felt that Brianna was it, Claire said.She stirred her cocoa meditatively.Why do you care, Roger?she asked him suddenly.Why are you asking me?He took a moment to answer, slowly sipping his cocoa.It was rich and dark, made with new cream and a sprinkle of brown sugar.Fiona, always a realist, had taken one look at Brianna and given up her attempts to lure Roger into matrimony via his stomach, but Fiona was a cook the same way Claire was a doctor; born to skill, and unable not to use it.Because Im a historian, I suppose, he answered finally.He watched her over the rim of his cup.I need to know.What people really did, and why they did it.And you think I can tell you that?She glanced sharply at him.Or that I know?He nodded, sipping.You know, better than most people.Most of a historians sources havent yourhe paused and gave her a grinyour unique perspective, shall we say?There was a sudden lessening of tension.She laughed and picked up her own cup.We shall say that, she agreed.The other thing, he went on, watching her closely, is that youre honest.I dont think you could lie, even if you wanted to.She glanced at him sharply, and gave a short, dry laugh.Everyone can lie, young Roger, given cause enough.Even me.Its only that its harder for those of us who live in glass faces; we have to think up our lies ahead of time.She bent her head and shuffled through the papers before her, turning the pages over slowly, one by one.They were lists of names, these sheets, lists of prisoners, copied from the ledger books of British prisons.The task was complicated by the fact that not all prisons had been well run.Some governors kept no official lists of their inmates, or listed them haphazardly in their journals, in among the notations of daily expenditure and maintenance, making no great distinction between the death of a prisoner and the slaughter of two bullocks, salted for meat.Roger thought Claire had abandoned the conversation, but a moment later she looked up again.Youre quite right, though, she said.Im honestfrom default, more than anything.It isnt easy for me not to say what Im thinking.I imagine you see it because youre the same way.Am I?Roger felt absurdly pleased, as though someone had given him an unexpected present.Claire nodded, a small smile on her lips as she watched him.Oh, yes.Its unmistakable, you know.There arent many people like thatwho will tell you the truth about themselves and anything else right out.Ive only met three people like that, I thinkfour now, she said, her smile widening to warm him.There was Jamie, of course.Her long fingers rested lightly on the stack of papers, almost caressing in their touch.Master Raymond, the apothecary I knew in Paris.And a friend I met in medical schoolJoe Abernathy.Now you.I think.She tilted her cup and swallowed the last of the rich brown liquid.She set it down and looked directly at Roger.Frank was right, in a way, though.It isnt necessarily easier if you know what it is youre meant to dobut at least you dont waste time in questioning or doubting.If youre honestwell, that isnt necessarily easier, either.Though I suppose if youre honest with yourself and know what you are, at least youre less likely to feel that youve wasted your life, doing the wrong thing.She set aside the stack of papers and drew up anothera set of folders with the characteristic logo of the British Museum on the covers.Jamie had that, she said softly, as though to herself.He wasnt a man to turn away from anything he thought his job.Dangerous or not.And I think he wont have felt himself wastedno matter what happened to him.She lapsed into silence, then, absorbed in the spidery tracings of some long dead writer, looking for the entry that might tell her what Jamie Fraser had done and been, and whether his life had been wasted in a prison cell, or ended in a lonely dungeon.The clock on the desk struck midnight, its chimes surprisingly deep and melodious for such a small instrument.The quarter hour struck, and then the half, punctuating the monotonous rustle of pages.Roger put down the sheaf of flimsy papers he had been thumbing through, and yawned deeply, not troubling to cover his mouth.Im so tired Im seeing double, he said.Shall we go on with it in the morning?Claire didnt answer for a moment; she was looking into the glowing bars of the electric fire, a look of unutterable distance on her face.Roger repeated his question, and slowly she came back from wherever she was.No, she said.She reached for another folder, and smiled at Roger, the look of distance lingering in her eyes.You go on, Roger, she said.Illjust look a little longer.When I finally found it, I nearly flipped right past it.I had not been reading the names carefully, but only skimming the pages for the letter J.  John, Joseph, Jacques, James.There were James Edward, James Alan, James Walter, ad infinitum.Then it was there, the writing small and precise across the page: Jms.MacKenzie Fraser, of Brock Turac.I put the page down carefully on the table, shut my eyes for a moment to clear them, then looked again.It was still there.Jamie, I said aloud.My heart was beating heavily in my chest.Jamie, I said again, more quietly.It was nearly three oclock in the morning.Everyone was asleep, but the house, in the manner of old houses, was still awake around me, creaking and sighing, keeping me company.Strangely enough, I had no desire to leap up and wake Brianna or Roger, to tell them the news.I wanted to keep it to myself for a bit, as though I were alone here in the lamp lit room with Jamie himself.My finger traced the line of ink.The person who had written that line had seen Jamieperhaps had written this with Jamie standing in front of him.The date at the top of the page was May 16, 1753.It had been close to this time of year, then.I could imagine how the air had been, chilly and fresh, with the rare spring sun across his shoulders, lighting sparks in his hair.How had he worn his hair thenshort, or long?He had preferred to wear it long, plaited or tailed behind.I remembered the casual gesture with which he would lift the weight of it off his neck to cool himself in the heat of exercise.He would not have worn his kiltthe wearing of all tartans had been outlawed after Culloden.Breeks, then, likely, and a linen shirt.I had made such sarks for him; I could feel the softness of the fabric in memory, the billowing length of the three full yards it took to make one, the long tails and full sleeves that let the Highland men drop their plaids and sleep or fight with a sark their only garment.I could imagine his shoulders broad beneath the rough woven cloth, his skin warm through it, hands touched with the chill of the Scottish spring.He had been imprisoned before.How would he have looked, facing an English prison clerk, knowing all too well what waited for him?Grim as hell, I thought, staring down that long, straight nose with his eyes a cold, dark bluedark and forbidding as the waters of Loch Ness.I opened my own eyes, realizing only then that I was sitting on the edge of my chair, the folder of photocopied pages clasped tight to my chest, so caught up in my conjuration that I had not even paid attention to which prison these registers had come from.There were several large prisons that the English had used regularly in the eighteenth century, and a number of minor ones.I turned the folder over, slowly.Would it be Berwick, near the border?The notorious Tolbooth of Edinburgh?Or one of the southern prisons, Leeds Castle or even the Tower of London?Ardsmuir, said the notecard neatly stapled to the front of the folder.Ardsmuir?I said blankly.Where the hell is that?8  HONORS PRISONER  Ardsmuir, Scotland   February 15, 1755  Ardsmuir is the carbuncle on Gods bum, Colonel Harry Quarry said.He raised his glass sardonically to the young man by the window.Ive been here a twelvemonth, and thats eleven months and twenty nine days too long.Give you joy of your new posting, my Lord.Major John William Grey turned from the window over the courtyard, where he had been surveying his new domain.It does appear a trifle incommodious, he agreed dryly, picking up his own glass.Does it rain all the time?Of course.Its Scotlandand the backside of bloody Scotland, at that.Quarry took a deep pull at his whisky, coughed, and exhaled noisily as he set down the empty glass.The drink is the only compensation, he said, a trifle hoarsely.Call on the local booze merchants in your best uniform, and theyll make you a decent price.Its astounding cheap, without the tariff.Ive left you a note of the best stills.He nodded toward the massive oaken desk at the side of the room, planted four square on its island of carpet like a small fortress confronting the barren room.The illusion of fortifications was enhanced by the banners of regiment and nation that hung from the stone wall behind it.The guards roster is here, Quarry said, rising and groping in the top desk drawer.He slapped a battered leather folder on the desktop, and added another on top of that.And the prisoners roll.You have one hundred and ninety six at the moment; two hundred is the usual count, give or take a few deaths from sickness or the odd poacher taken up in the countryside.Two hundred, Grey said.And how many in the guards barracks?Eighty two, by number.In use, about half that.Quarry reached into the drawer again and withdrew a brown glass bottle with a cork.He shook it, heard it slosh, and smiled sardonically.The commander isnt the only one to find consolation in drink.Half the sots are usually incapable at roll call.Ill leave this for you, shall I?Youll need it.He put the bottle back and pulled out the lower drawer.Requisitions and copies here; the paperworks the worst of the post.Not a great deal to do, really, if youve a decent clerk.You havent, at the moment; I had a corporal who wrote a fairish hand, but he died two weeks ago.Train up another, and youll have nothing to do save to hunt for grouse and the Frenchmans Gold.He laughed at his own joke; rumors of the gold that Louis of France had supposedly sent to his cousin Charles Stuart were rife in this end of Scotland.The prisoners are not difficult?Grey asked.I had understood them to be mostly Jacobite Highlanders.They are.But theyre docile enough.Quarry paused, looking out of the window.A small line of ragged men was issuing from a door in the forbidding stone wall opposite.No heart in them after Culloden, he said matter of factly.Butcher Billy saw to that.And we work them hard enough that theyve no vigor left for troublemaking.Grey nodded.Ardsmuir fortress was undergoing renovation, rather ironically using the labor of the Scots incarcerated therein.He rose and came to join Quarry at the window.Theres a work crew going out now, for peat cutting.Quarry nodded at the group below.A dozen bearded men, ragged as scarecrows, formed an awkward line before a red coated soldier, who walked up and down, inspecting them.Evidently satisfied, he shouted an order and jerked a hand toward the outer gate.The prisoners crew was accompanied by six armed soldiers, who fell in before and behind, muskets held in marching order, their smart appearance a marked contrast to the ragged Highlanders.The prisoners walked slowly, oblivious to the rain that soaked their rags.A mule drawn wagon creaked behind, a bundle of peat knives gleaming dully in its bed.Quarry frowned, counting them.Some must be ill; a work crew is eighteen menthree prisoners to a guard, because of the knives.Though surprisingly few of them try to run, he added, turning away from the window.Nowhere to go, I suppose.He left the desk, kicking aside a large woven basket that sat on the hearth, filled with crude chunks of a rough dark brown substance.Leave the window open, even when its raining, he advised.The peat smoke will choke you, otherwise.He took a deep breath in illustration and let it out explosively.God, Ill be glad to get back to London!Not much in the way of local society, I collect?Grey asked dryly.Quarry laughed, his broad red face creasing in amusement at the notion.Society?My dear fellow!Bar one or two passable blowzabellas down in the village, society will consist solely of conversation with your officersthere are four of them, one of whom is capable of speaking without the use of profanityyour orderly, and one prisoner.A prisoner?Grey looked up from the ledgers he had been perusing, one fair brow lifted in inquiry.Oh, yes.Quarry was prowling the office restlessly, eager to be off.His carriage was waiting; he had stayed only to brief his replacement and make the formal handover of command.Now he paused, glancing at Grey.One corner of his mouth curled up, enjoying a secret joke.Youve heard of Red Jamie Fraser, I expect?Grey stiffened slightly, but kept his face as unmoved as possible.I should imagine most people have, he said coldly.The man was notorious during the Rising.Quarry had heard the story, damn him!All of it, or only the first part?Quarrys mouth twitched slightly, but he merely nodded.Quite.Well, we have him.Hes the only senior Jacobite officer here; the Highlander prisoners treat him as their chief.Consequently, if any matters arise involving the prisonersand they will, I assure youhe acts as their spokesman.Quarry was in his stockinged feet; now he sat and tugged on long cavalry boots, in preparation for the mud outside.Seumas, mac an fhear dhuibh, they call him, or just Mac Dubh.Speak Gaelic, do you?Neither do IGrissom does, though; he says it means James, son of the Black One.Half the guards are afraid of himthose that fought with Cope at Prestonpans.Say hes the Devil himself.Poor devil, now!Quarry gave a brief snort, forcing his foot into the boot.He stamped once, to settle it, and stood up.The prisoners obey him without question; but give orders without his putting his seal to them, and you might as well be talking to the stones in the courtyard.Ever had much to do with Scots?Oh, of course; you fought at Culloden with your brothers regiment, didnt you?Quarry struck his brow at his pretended forgetfulness.Damn the man!He had heard it all.Youll have an idea, then.Stubborn does not begin to describe it.He flapped a hand in the air as though to dismiss an entire contingent of recalcitrant Scots.Which means, Quarry paused, enjoying it, youll need Frasers good willor at least his cooperation.I had him take supper with me once a week, to talk things over, and found it answered very well.You might try the same arrangement.I suppose I might.Greys tone was cool, but his hands were clenched tight at his sides.When icicles grew in hell, he might take supper with James Fraser!Hes an educated man, Quarry continued, eyes bright with malice, fixed on Greys face.A great deal more interesting to talk to than the officers.Plays chess.You have a game now and then, do you not?Now and then.The muscles of his abdomen were clenched so tightly that he had trouble drawing breath.Would this bullet headed fool not stop talking and leave?Ah, well, Ill leave you to it.As though divining Greys wish, Quarry settled his wig more firmly, then took his cloak from the hook by the door and swirled it rakishly about his shoulders.He turned toward the door, hat in hand, then turned back.Oh, one thing.If you do dine with Fraser alonedont turn your back on him.The offensive jocularity had left Quarrys face; Grey scowled at him, but could see no evidence that the warning was meant as a joke.I mean it, Quarry said, suddenly serious.Hes in irons, but its easy to choke a man with the chain.And hes a very large fellow, Fraser.I know.To his fury, Grey could feel the blood rising in his cheeks.To hide it, he swung about, letting the cold air from the half open window play on his countenance.Surely, he said, to the rain slick gray stones below, if he is the intelligent man you say, he would not be so foolish as to attack me in my own quarters, in the midst of the prison?What would be the purpose in it?Quarry didnt answer.After a moment, Grey turned around, to find the other staring at him thoughtfully, all trace of humor gone from the broad, ruddy face.Theres intelligence, Quarry said slowly.And then there are other things.But perhaps youre too young to have seen hate and despair at close range.Theres been a deal of it in Scotland, these last ten years.He tilted his head, surveying the new commander of Ardsmuir from his vantage point of fifteen years seniority.Major Grey was young, no more than twenty six, and with a fair complexioned face and girlish lashes that made him look still younger than his years.To compound the problem, he was an inch or two shorter than the average, and fine boned, as well.He drew himself up straight.I am aware of such things, Colonel, he said evenly.Quarry was a younger son of good family, like himself, but still his superior in rank; he must keep his temper.Quarrys bright hazel gaze rested on him in speculation.I daresay.With a sudden motion, he clapped his hat on his head.He touched his cheek, where the darker line of a scar sliced across the ruddy skin; a memento of the scandalous duel that had sent him into exile at Ardsmuir.God knows what you did to be sent here, Grey, he said, shaking his head.But for your own sake, I hope you deserved it!Luck to you!And with a swirl of blue cloak, he was gone.Better the Devil ye ken, than the Devil ye dont, Murdo Lindsay said, shaking his head lugubriously.Handsome Harry was nain sae bad.No, he wasna, then, agreed Kenny Lesley.But yell ha been here when he came, no?He was a deal better than that shite face Bogle, aye?Aye, said Murdo, looking blank.Whats your meaning, man?So if Handsome was better than Bogle, Lesley explained patiently, then Handsome was the Devil we didna ken, and Bogle the one that we didbut Handsome was better, in spite of that, so youre wrong, man.I am?Murdo, hopelessly confused by this bit of reasoning, glowered at Lesley.No, Im not!Ye are, then, Lesley said, losing patience.Yere always wrong, Murdo!Why dye argue, when yere never in the right of it?Im no arguin!Murdo protested indignantly.Yere takin exception to me, not tother way aboot.Only because youre wrong, man!Lesley said.If ye were right, Id have said not a word.Im not wrong!At least I dinna think so, Murdo muttered, unable to recall precisely what he had said.He turned, appealing to the large figure seated in the corner.Mac Dubh, was I wrong?The tall man stretched himself, the chain of his irons chiming faintly as he moved, and laughed.No, Murdo, yere no wrong.But we canna say if yere right yet awhile.Not til we see what the new Devils like, aye?Seeing Lesleys brows draw down in preparation for further dispute, he raised his voice, speaking to the room at large.Has anyone seen the new Governor yet?Johnson?MacTavish?I have, Hayes said, pushing gladly forward to warm his hands at the fire.There was only one hearth in the large cell, and room for no more than six men before it at a time.The other forty were left in bitter chill, huddling together in small groups for warmth.Consequently, the agreement was that whoever had a tale to tell or a song to sing might have a place by the hearth, for as long as he spoke.Mac Dubh had said this was a bard right, that when the bards came to the auld castles, they would be given a warm place and plenty to eat and drink, to the honor of the lairds hospitality.There was never food or drink to spare here, but the warm place was certain.Hayes relaxed, eyes closed and a beatific smile on his face as he spread his hands to the warmth.Warned by restive movement to either side, though, he hastily opened his eyes and began to speak.I saw him when he came in from his carriage, and then again, when I brought up a platter o sweeties from the kitchens, whilst he and Handsome Harry were nattering to ain another.Hayes frowned in concentration.Hes fair haired, wi long yellow locks tied up wi blue ribbon.And big eyes and long lashes, too, like a lassies.Hayes leered at his listeners, batting his own stubby lashes in mock flirtation.Encouraged by the laughter, he went on to describe the new Governors clothesfine as a lairdshis equipage and servantone of they Sassenachs as talks like hes burnt his tongueand as much as had been overheard of the new mans speech.He talks sharp and quick, like hell know whats what, Hayes said, shaking his head dubiously.But hes verra young, forbyehe looks scarce more than a wean, though Id reckon hes older than his looks.Aye, hes a bittie fellow, smaller than wee Angus, Baird chimed in, with a jerk of the head at Angus MacKenzie, who looked down at himself in startlement.Angus had been twelve when he fought beside his father at Culloden.He had spent nearly half his life in Ardsmuir, and in consequence of the poor fare of prison, had never grown much bigger.Aye, Hayes agreed, but he carries himself well; shoulders square and a ramrod up his arse.This gave rise to a burst of laughter and ribald comment, and Hayes gave way to Ogilvie, who knew a long and scurrilous story about the laird of Donibristle and the hogmans daughter.Hayes left the hearth without resentment, and wentas was the customto sit beside Mac Dubh.Mac Dubh never took his place on the hearth, even when he told them the long stories from the books that hed readThe Adventures of Roderick Random, The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, or everyones favorite, Robinson Crusoe.Claiming that he needed the room to accommodate his long legs, Mac Dubh sat always in his same spot in the corner, where everyone might hear him.But the men who left the fire would come, one by one, and sit down on the bench beside him, to give him the warmth that lingered in their clothes.Shall ye speak to the new Governor tomorrow, dye think, Mac Dubh?Hayes asked as he sat.I met Billy Malcolm, coming in from the peat cutting, and he shouted to me as the rats were grown uncommon bold in their cell just now.Six men bitten this sennight as they slept, and two of them festering.Mac Dubh shook his head, and scratched at his chin.He had been allowed a razor before his weekly audiences with Harry Quarry, but it had been five days since the last of these, and his chin was thick with red stubble.I canna say, Gavin, he said.Quarry did say as hed tell the new fellow of our arrangement, but the new man might have his own ways, aye?If Im called to see him, though, I shall be sure to say about the rats.Did Malcolm ask for Morrison to come and see to the festering, though?The prison had no doctor; Morrison, who had a touch for healing, was permitted by the guards to go from cell to cell to tend the sick or injured, at Mac Dubhs request.Hayes shook his head.He hadna time to say morethey were marching past, aye?Best I send Morrison, Mac Dubh decided.He can ask Billy is there aught else amiss there.There were four main cells where the prisoners were kept in large groups; word passed among them by means of Morrisons visits and the mingling of men on the work crews that went out daily to haul stone or cut peats on the nearby moor.Morrison came at once when summoned, pocketing four of the carved rats skulls with which the prisoners improvised games of draughts.Mac Dubh groped under the bench where he sat, drawing out the cloth bag he carried when he went to the moor.Och, not more o the damn thistles, Morrison protested, seeing Mac Dubhs grimace as he groped in the bag.I canna make them eat those things; they all say, do I think them kine, or maybe pigs?Mac Dubh gingerly set down a fistful of wilted stalks, and sucked his pricked fingers.Theyre stubborn as pigs, to be sure, he remarked.Its only milk thistle.How often must I tell ye, Morrison?Take the thistle heads off, and mash the leaves and stems fine, and if theyre too prickly to eat spread on a bannock, then make a tea of them and have them drink it.Ive yet to see pigs drink tea, tell them.Morrisons lined face cracked in a grin.An elderly man, he knew well enough how to handle recalcitrant patients; he only liked to complain for the fun of it.Aye, well, Ill say have they ever seen a toothless cow?he said, resigned, as he tucked the limp greens carefully into his own sack.But youll be sure to bare your teeth at Joel McCulloch, next time ye see him.Hes the worst o them, for not believin as the greens do help wi the scurvy.Say as Ill bite him in the arse, Mac Dubh promised, with a flash of his excellent teeth, if I hear he hasna eaten his thistles.Morrison made the small amused noise that passed for a belly laugh with him, and went to gather up the bits of ointment and the few herbs he had for medicines.Mac Dubh relaxed for the moment, glancing about the room to be sure no trouble brewed.
