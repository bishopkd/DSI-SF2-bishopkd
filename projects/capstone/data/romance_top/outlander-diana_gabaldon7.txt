I demanded, crossing my arms.He blinked, plainly unprepared for resistance, but one of the judges forestalled his reply.Tis the proper procedure for trial by water.The suspected witch shall have the right thumb bound by a cord of hemp to the great toe of the left foot.Likewise, the left thumb shall be bound to the right great toe.And then He cast an eloquent glance at the waters of the loch.Two fishermen stood barefooted in the mud of the shore, trews rolled above their knees and tied with twine.Grinning insinuatingly at me, one of them picked up a small stone and heaved it out across the steely surface.It skipped once and sank.Upon entering the water, the short judge chimed in, a guilty witch will float, as the purity of the water rejects her tainted person.An innocent woman will sink.So Ive the choice of being condemned as a witch or being found innocent but drowned, have I?I snapped.No thank you!I hugged my elbows harder, trying to still the shiver that seemed to have become a permanent part of my flesh.The short judge puffed himself up like a threatened toad.Youll nae speak before this court without leave, woman!Do ye dare to refuse lawful examination?Do I dare refuse to be drowned?Too right I do!Too late I caught sight of Geilie, frantically shaking her head, so that the fair hair swirled around her face.The judge turned to MacRae.Strip her and skelp her, he said flatly.Through a daze of disbelief, I heard a collective inhalation, presumably of shocked dismayin truth, of anticipatory enjoyment.And I realized just what hate really meant.Not theirs.Mine.They didnt bother taking me back to the village square.So far as I was now concerned, I had little left to lose, and I didnt make it easy for them.Rough hands jerked me forward, yanking at the edges of blouse and bodice.Let go of me, you bloody lout!I yelled, and kicked one man handler squarely where it would do most good.He crumpled with a groan, but his doubled form was quickly lost in a boiling eruption of shouting, spitting, glaring faces.More hands seized my arms and hustled me stumbling onward, half lifting me over bodies fallen in the crush, pushing me bodily through gaps too small to walk through.Someone hit me in the stomach, and I lost my breath.My bodice was virtually in shreds by this time, so it was with no great difficulty that the remainder was stripped off.I had never suffered from excessive modesty, but standing half naked before the jeers of that crowd of ill wishers, with the prints of sweaty hands on my bare breasts, filled me with a hatred and humiliation I could not even have imagined.John MacRae bound my hands before me, looping a woven rope about my wrists, leaving a length of several feet.He had the grace to look ashamed as he did it, but would not raise his eyes to mine, and it was clear I could expect neither help nor lenience from that quarter; he was as much at the mercy of the crowd as I was.Geilie was there, no doubt similarly treated; I caught a glimpse of her platinum hair, flying in a sudden breeze.My arms stretched high above my head as the rope was thrown over the branch of a large oak and hauled tight.I gritted my teeth and held tight to my fury; it was the only thing I had to combat my fear.There was an air of breathless expectancy, punctuated by the excited murmurs and shouts from the crowd of watchers.Give it er, John!one shouted.Get on wi it!John MacRae, sensitive to the theatrical responsibilities of his profession, paused, scourge held level at waist height, and surveyed the crowd.He walked forward and gently adjusted my position, so that I faced the trunk of the tree, almost touching the rough bark.Then he drew back two paces, raised the whip and let it fall.The shock of it was worse than the pain.In fact, it was only after several blows that I realized the locksman was doing his level best to spare me what he could.Still, one or two blows were hard enough to break the skin; I felt the sharp tingle in the wake of the impact.I had my eyes shut tight, cheek pressed hard against the wood, trying for all I was worth to be somewhere else.Suddenly, though, I heard something that recalled me at once to the here and now.Claire!There was a little slack in the rope that bound my wrists; enough to let me make a lunge that brought me clear around, facing the mob.My sudden escape disconcerted the locksman, who brought his lash down on empty air, stumbled forward off balance, and knocked his head against a limb.This had a very good effect on the mob, who roared insults and started jeering at him.My hair was in my eyes, stuck to my face with sweat, tears, and the filth of confinement.I shook my head to free it, and managed at least a sidelong glance that confirmed what my ears had heard.Jamie was shoving his way through the hindering crowd, face like thunder, ruthlessly taking advantage of his size and muscle.I felt very much like General MacAuliffe at Bastogne, sighting Pattons Third Army in the offing.In spite of the horrible danger to Geilie, to me, and now to Jamie himself, I had never been so happy to see anyone.The witchs man!Her husband, it is!Stinkin Fraser!Crowner!and similar epithets began to be heard among the more general abuse aimed at me and Geilie.Take him too!Burn em!Burn em all!The crowds hysteria, temporarily dispersed by the locksmans accident, was rising to fever pitch once more.Hampered by the clinging forms of the locksmans assistants, who were trying to restrain him, Jamie had come to a dead halt.A man hanging from each arm, he struggled to force his hand toward his belt.Thinking him reaching for a knife, one man punched him hard in the belly.Jamie doubled slightly, then came up, smashing an elbow to the nose of the man whod hit him.One arm temporarily freed, he ignored the frantic pawings of the man on the other side.He dipped a hand into his sporran, raised his arm and threw.His shout reached me as the object left his hand.Claire!Stand still!Not much place for me to go, I thought dazedly.There was a dark blur headed straight for my face, and I started to flinch backward, but stopped in time.The blur struck my face with a clattering sting and the black beads fell on my shoulders as the jet rosary, flung bola style, neatly ringed my neck.Or not quite neatly; the strand had caught on my right ear.I shook my head, eyes watering from the blow, and the circlet settled into place, crucifix swinging jauntily between my naked breasts.The faces in the front row were staring at it in a kind of horrified bemusement.Their sudden silence affected those further back, and the roaring seethe of noise subsided.Jamies voice, customarily soft spoken, even in anger, rang out in the silence.There was nothing soft about it now.Cut her down!The hangers on had dropped away, and the waves of the crowd parted before him as he strode forward.The locksman watched him come, standing gape jawed and frozen.I said, cut her down!Now!The locksman, freed from his trance by the apocalyptic vision of red haired death bearing down on him, stirred himself and fumbled hastily for his dirk.The rope, sawn through, let go with a shuddering snap and my arms dropped like bolsters, aching with released strain.I staggered and would have fallen, but a strong, familiar hand caught my elbow and pulled me upright.Then my face was against Jamies chest, and nothing mattered to me anymore.I may have lost consciousness for a few moments, or only been so overcome with relief that it seemed that way.Jamies arm was hard around my waist, holding me up, and his plaid had been thrown over me, hiding me at last from the stare of the villagers.There was a confusion of voices all around, but it was no longer the crazed and gleeful blood lust of the mob.The voice of Muttor was it Jeff?cut through the confusion.Who are you?How dare ye to interfere wi the investigations of the court?I could feel, rather than see, the crowd pushing forward.Jamie was large, and he was armed, but he was only one man.I cowered against him under the folds of the plaid.His right arm tightened around me, but his left hand went to the sheath on his hip.The silver blue blade hissed with menace as it came half out of its scabbard, and those in the forefront of the crowd came to a sudden stop.The judges were made of somewhat tougher fabric.Peering out from my hiding place, I could see Jeff glaring at Jamie.Mutt appeared more bemused than annoyed at this sudden intrusion.Do ye dare to draw arms against the justice of God?snapped the tubby little judge.Jamie drew the sword completely, with a flash of steel, then thrust it point first into the ground, leaving the hilt quivering with the force of the blow.I draw it in defense of this woman, and the truth, he said.If any here be against those two, theyll answer to me, and then God, in that order.The judge blinked once or twice, as though unable to credit this behavior, then surged to the attack once more.You have no place in the workings o this court, sir!Ill demand that ye surrender the prisoner at once.Your own behavior will be dealt with presently!Jamie looked the judges over coolly.I could feel his heart hammering beneath my cheek as I clung to him, but his hands were rock steady, one resting on the hilt of his sword, the other on the dirk at his belt.As to that, sir, I swore an oath before the altar of God to protect this woman.And if youre tellin me that ye consider your own authority to be greater than that of the Almighty, then I must inform ye that Im no of that opinion, myself.The silence that followed this was broken by an embarrassed titter, echoed here and there by a nervous laugh.While the sympathies of the crowd had not shifted to our side, still the momentum carrying us to disaster had been broken.Jamie turned me with a hand on my shoulder.I couldnt bear to face the crowd, but I knew I must.I kept my chin as high as I could, and my eyes focused beyond the faces, to a small boat in the center of the loch.I stared at it til my eyes watered.Jamie turned back the plaid, holding it around me, but letting it drop far enough to show my neck and shoulders.He touched the black rosary and set it swinging gently to and fro.Jet will burn a witchs skin, no?he demanded of the judges.Still more, I should think, would the cross of our Lord.But look.He dipped a finger under the beads and lifted up the crucifix.My skin beneath was pure white, unmarked save for the smudges of captivity, and there was a gasp and murmur from the crowd.Raw courage, an ice cold presence of mind, and that instinct for showmanship.Colum MacKenzie had been right to be apprehensive of Jamies ambitions.And given his fear that I might reveal Hamishs parentage, or what he thought I knew of it, what he had done to me was understandable too.Understandable, but not forgivable.The mood of the crowd now swayed to and fro, uncertain.The bloodlust that had driven it earlier was dissipating, but it might still tilt like a cresting wave and crush us.Mutt and Jeff glanced at each other, undecided; taken aback by this last development, the judges had momentarily lost control of the situation.Geillis Duncan stepped forward into the breach.I do not know whether there was hope for her at that point or not.In any case, she now tossed her fair hair defiantly over one shoulder, and threw her life away.This woman is no witch, she said simply.But I am.Jamies show, good as it was, was no match for this.The resulting uproar drowned completely the voices of the judges, questioning and exclaiming.There was no clue to what she thought or felt, no more than there ever was; her high white brow was clear, the big green eyes gleaming in what might be amusement.She stood straight in her ragged garments, daubed with filth, and stared down her accusers.When the tumult had quieted a bit, she began to speak, not deigning to raise her voice, but forcing them to quiet themselves to hear her.I, Geillis Duncan, do confess that I am a witch, and the mistress of Satan.This caused another outcry, and she waited again with perfect patience for them to quiet.In obedience to my Master, I do confess that I killed my husband, Arthur Duncan, by means of witchcraft.At this, she glanced aside, catching my eye, and the hint of a smile touched her lips.Her eyes rested on the woman in the yellow shawl, but did not soften.Of malice, I placed a spell upon the changeling child, that it might die, and the human child it replaced remain with the fairies.She turned and gestured in my direction.I took advantage of the ignorance of Claire Fraser, using her for my purposes.But she had neither part nor knowledge in my doings, nor does she serve my Master.The crowd was muttering again, people jostling to get a better look, pushing nearer.She stretched out both hands toward them, palm outward.Stay back!The clear voice cracked like a whip, to much the same effect.She tilted back her head to the skies and froze, like one listening.Hear!she said.Hear the wind of his coming!Beware, ye people of Cranesmuir!For my Master comes on the wings o the wind!She lowered her head and screamed, a high, eerie sound of triumph.The large green eyes were fixed and staring, trancelike.The wind was rising; I could see the clouds of the storm rolling across the far side of the loch.People began to look uneasily around; a few souls dropped back from the edge of the crowd.Geilie began to spin, twirling round and round, hair whipping in the wind, hand gracefully overhead like a maypole dancers.I watched her in stunned disbelief.As she turned, her hair hid her face.On the last turn, though, she snapped her head to throw the fair mane to one side and I saw her face clearly, looking at me.The mask of trance had vanished momentarily, and her mouth formed a single word.Then her turn took her around to face the crowd once more, and she began her eerie screaming again.The word had been Run!She stopped her spinning suddenly, and with a look of mad exultation, gripped the remnants of her bodice with both hands and tore it down the front.Tore it far enough to show the crowd the secret I had learned, huddled close beside her in the cold filth of the thieves hole.The secret Arthur Duncan had learned, in the hour before his death.The secret for which he had died.The shreds of her loose gown dropped away, exposing the swelling bulge of a six month pregnancy.I still stood like a rock, staring.Jamie had no such hesitations.Seizing me with one hand and his sword with the other, he flung himself into the crowd, knocking people out of the way with elbows, knees, and sword hilt, bulling his way toward the edge of the loch.He let out a piercing whistle through his teeth.Intent on the spectacle under the oak, few people at first realized what was happening.Then, as individuals began to shout and grab at us, there was the sound of galloping hooves on the hard packed dirt above the shore.Donas still didnt care much for people, and was all too willing to show it.He bit the first hand reaching for his bridle, and a man dropped back, crying out and dripping blood.The horse reared, squealing and pawing the air, and the few bold souls still intent on stopping him suddenly lost interest.Jamie flung me over the saddle like a sack of meal and swung up himself in one fluid motion.Clearing a path with vicious swipes of his sword, he turned Donas through the hindering mass of the crowd.As people fell back from the onslaught of teeth, hooves, and blade, we picked up speed, leaving the loch, the village, and Leoch behind.Breath knocked out of me by the impact, I struggled to speak, to scream to Jamie.For I hadnt stood frozen at the revelation of Geilies pregnancy.It was something else I had seen that chilled me to the marrow of my bones.As Geilie had spun, white arms stretched aloft, I saw what she had seen when my own clothes were stripped away.A mark on one arm like the one I bore.Here, in this time, the mark of sorcery, the mark of a magus.The small, homely scar of a smallpox vaccination.* * *    Rain pattered on the water, soothing my swollen face and the rope burns on my wrists.I dipped a handful of water from the stream and sipped it slowly, feeling the cold liquid trickle down my throat with gratitude.Jamie disappeared for a few minutes.He came back with a handful of dark green oblate leaves, chewing something.He spat a glob of macerated green into the palm of his hand, stuffed another wad of leaves into his mouth and turned me away from him.He rubbed the chewed leaves gently over my back, and the stinging eased considerably.What is that?I asked, making an effort to control myself.I was still shaky and snuffling, but the helpless tears were beginning to ebb.Watercress, he answered, voice slightly muffled by the leaves in his mouth.He spat them out and applied them to my back.Youre no the only one knows a bit about grass cures, Sassenach, he said, a bit clearer.Howhow does it taste?I asked, gulping back the sobs.Fair nasty, he replied laconically.He finished his application and laid the plaid softly back across my shoulders.It wont he began, then hesitated, I mean, the cuts are not deep.II think youll no bemarked.He spoke gruffly, but his touch was very gentle, and reduced me to tears once more.Im sorry, I mumbled, dabbling my nose on a corner of the plaid.II dont know whats wrong with me.I dont know why I cant stop crying.He shrugged.I dinna suppose anyones tried to hurt ye on purpose before, Sassenach, he said.Its likely the shock of that, so much as the pain.He paused, picking up a plaid end.I did just the same, lass, he said matter of factly.Puked after, and cried while they cleansed the cuts.Then I shook.He wiped my face carefully with the plaid, then put a hand under my chin and tilted my face up to his.And when I stopped shaking, Sassenach, he said quietly, I thanked God for the pain, because it meant I was still alive.He let go, nodding at me.When ye get to that point, lassie, tell me; for Ive a thing or two I want to be sayin to ye then.He got up and went down to the edge of the burn, to wash out the bloodstained handkerchief in cold water.What brought you back?I asked, when he returned.I had managed to stop crying, but I still shook, and huddled deeper into the folds of the plaid.Alec MacMahon, he said, smiling.I told him to watch over ye while I was gone.When the villagers took you and Mrs.Duncan, he rode all night and the next day to find me.And then I rode like the devil himself comin back.Lord, thats a good horse.He looked approvingly up the slope to Donas, tethered to a tree at the top of the bank, his wet coat gleaming like copper.Ill have to move him, he said, thoughtfully.I doubt anyone will follow, but it isna that far from Cranesmuir.Can ye walk now?I followed him up the steep slope with some difficulty, small rocks rolling under my feet and bracken and bramble catching my shift.Near the top of the slope was a grove of young alders, grown so close together that the lower branches interlaced, forming a green roof over the bracken beneath.Jamie shoved the branches up far enough for me to crawl into the narrow space, then carefully rearranged the crushed bracken before the entrance.He stood back and surveyed the hiding place critically, nodding in satisfaction.Aye, thats good.No one will find ye there.He turned to go, then turned back.Try to sleep, if ye can, and dont worry if Im not back at once.Ill hunt a bit on the way back; weve no food with us, and I dinna want to attract attention by stopping at a croft.Pull the tartan up over your head, and make sure it covers your shift; the white shows for a long way.Food seemed irrelevant; I felt as though I would never want to eat again.Sleep was something else again.My back and arms still ached, the rope burns on my wrists were raw, and I felt sore and bruised all over; but worn out with fear, pain, and simple exhaustion, I fell asleep almost at once, the pungent scent of ferns rising around me like incense.I awoke with something gripping my foot.Startled, I sat up straight, crashing into the springy branches overhead.Leaves and sticks showered down around me, and I flailed my arms wildly, trying to disentangle my hair from the snagging twigs.Scratched, disheveled, and irritated, I crawled out of my sanctuary to find an amused Jamie squatting nearby, watching my emergence.It was near sunset; the sun had dropped below the lip of the burn, leaving the rocky canyon in shadow.The smell of roasting meat rose from a small fire burning among the rocks near the stream, where two rabbits browned on a makeshift spit made of sharpened green sticks.Jamie held out a hand to help me down the slope.I haughtily declined and swept down myself, tripping only once on the trailing ends of the plaid.My earlier nausea had vanished, and I fell ravenously on the meat.Well move up into the forest after supper, Sassenach, Jamie said, tearing a joint from the rabbit carcass.I dinna want to sleep near the burn; I canna hear anyone coming over the noise of the water.There was not much conversation as we ate.The horror of the morning, and the thought of what we had left behind, oppressed us both.And for me there was a profound sense of mourning.I had lost not only the chance of finding out more about the why and wherefore of my presence here, but a friend as well.My only friend.I was often in doubt as to Geilies motives, but I had no doubt at all that she had saved my life that morning.Knowing herself doomed, she had done her best to give me a chance of escape.The fire, almost invisible in daylight, was growing brighter now as darkness filled the burn.I looked into the flames, seeing the crisp skin and browned bones of the rabbits on their spits.A drop of blood from a broken bone fell into the fire, hissing into nothing.Suddenly the meat stuck in my throat.I set it down hastily and turned away, retching.Still without speaking much, we moved out of the burn and found a comfortable place near the edge of a clearing in the forest.Hills rose in undulant mounds all around us, but Jamie had chosen a high spot, with a good view of the road from the village.The dusk momentarily heightened all the colors of the countryside, lighting the land with jewels; a glowing emerald in the hollows, a lovely shadowed amethyst among the clumps of heather, and burning rubies on the red berried rowan trees that crowned the hills.Rowan berries, a specific against witchcraft.Far in the distance, the outline of Castle Leoch was still visible at the foot of Ben Aden.It faded quickly as the light died.Jamie made a fire in a sheltered spot, and sat down next to it.The rain had eased to a faint drizzle that misted the air and spangled my eyelashes with rainbows when I looked at the flames.He sat staring into the fire for a long time.Finally he looked up at me, hands clasped around his knees.I said before that Id not ask ye things ye had no wish to tell me.And Id not ask ye now; but I must know, for your safety as well as mine.He paused, hesitating.Claire, if youve never been honest wi me, be so now, for I must know the truth.Claire, are ye a witch?I gaped at him.A witch?Youyou can really ask that?I thought he must be joking.He wasnt.He took me by the shoulders and gripped me hard, staring into my eyes as though willing me to answer him.I must ask it, Claire!And you must tell me!And if I were?I asked through dry lips.If you had thought I were a witch?Would you still have fought for me?I would have gone to the stake with you!he said violently.And to hell beyond, if I must.But may the Lord Jesus have mercy on my soul and on yours, tell me the truth!The strain of it all caught up with me.I tore myself out of his grasp and ran across the clearing.Not far, only to the edge of the trees; I could not bear the exposure of the open space.I clutched a tree; put my arms around it and dug my fingers hard into the bark, pressed my face to it and shrieked with hysterical laughter.Jamies face, white and shocked, loomed up on the other side of the tree.With the dim realization that what I was doing must sound unnervingly like cackling, I made a terrific effort and stopped.Panting, I stared at him for a moment.Yes, I said, backing away, still heaving with gasps of unhinged laughter.Yes, I am a witch!To you, I must be.Ive never had smallpox, but I can walk through a room full of dying men and never catch it.I can nurse the sick and breathe their air and touch their bodies, and the sickness cant touch me.I cant catch cholera, either, or lockjaw, or the morbid sore throat.And you must think its an enchantment, because youve never heard of vaccine, and theres no other way you can explain it.The things I know I stopped backing away and stood still, breathing heavily, trying to control myself.I know about John Randall because I was told about him.I know when he was born and when hell die, I know about what hes done and what hell do, I know about Sandringham because, because Frank told me.He knew about Randall because heheoh, God!I felt as though I might be sick, and closed my eyes to shut out the spinning stars overhead.And Columhe thinks Im a witch, because I know Hamish isnt his own son.I knowhe cant sire children.But he thought I knew who Hamishs father isI thought maybe it was you, but then I knew it couldnt be, and I was talking faster and faster, trying to keep the vertigo at bay with the sound of my own voice.Everything Ive ever told you about myself was true, I said, nodding madly as though to reassure myself.Everything.I havent any people, I havent any history, because I havent happened yet.Do you know when I was born?I asked, looking up.I knew my hair was wild and my eyes staring, and I didnt care.On the twentieth of October, in the Year of Our Lord nineteen hundred and eighteen.Do you hear me?I demanded, for he was blinking at me unmoving, as though paying no attention to a word I said.I said nineteen eighteen!Nearly two hundred years from now!Do you hear?I was shouting now, and he nodded slowly.I hear, he said softly.Yes, you hear!I blazed.And you think Im raving mad.Dont you?Admit it!Thats what you think.You have to think so, there isnt any other way you can explain me to yourself.You cant believe me, you cant dare to.Oh, Jamie I felt my face start to crumple.All this time spent hiding the truth, realizing that I could never tell anyone, and now I realized that I could tell Jamie, my beloved husband, the man I trusted beyond all others, and he wouldnthe couldnt believe me either.It was the rocksthe fairy hill.The standing stones.Merlins stones.Thats where I came through.I was gasping, half sobbing, becoming less coherent by the second.Once upon a time, but its really two hundred years.Its always two hundred years, in the stories.But in the stories, the people always get back.I couldnt get back.I turned away, staggering, grasping for support.I sank down on a rock, shoulders slumped, and put my head in my hands.There was a long silence in the wood.It went on long enough for the small night birds to recover their courage and start their noises once again, calling to each other with a thin, high zeek!as they hawked for the last insects of the summer.I looked up at last, thinking that perhaps he had simply risen and left me, overcome by my revelations.He was still there, though, still sitting, hands braced on his knees, head bowed as though in thought.The hairs on his arms shone stiff as copper wires in the firelight, though, and I realized that they stood erect, like the bristles on a dog.He was afraid of me.Jamie, I said, feeling my heart break with absolute loneliness.Oh, Jamie.I sat down and curled myself into a ball, trying to roll myself around the core of my pain.Nothing mattered any longer, and I sobbed my heart out.His hands on my shoulders raised me, enough to see his face.Through the haze of tears, I saw the look he wore in battle, of struggle that had passed the point of strain and become calm certainty.I believe you, he said firmly.I dinna understand it a bitnot yetbut I believe you.Claire, I believe you!Listen to me!Theres the truth between us, you and I, and whatever ye tell me, I shall believe it.He gave me a gentle shake.It doesna matter what it is.Youve told me.Thats enough for now.Be still, mo duinne.Lay your head and rest.Youll tell me the rest of it later.And Ill believe you.I was still sobbing, unable to grasp what he was telling me.I struggled, trying to pull away, but he gathered me up and held me tightly against himself, pushing my head into the folds of his plaid, and repeating over and over again, I believe you.At last, from sheer exhaustion, I grew calm enough to look up and say, But you cant believe me.He smiled down at me.His mouth trembled slightly, but he smiled.Yell no tell me what I canna do, Sassenach.He paused a moment.How old are ye?he asked curiously.I never thought to ask.The question seemed so preposterous that it took me a minute to think.Im twenty sevenor maybe twenty eight, I added.That rattled him for a moment.At twenty eight, women in this time were usually on the verge of middle age.Oh, he said.He took a deep breath.I thought ye were about my ageor younger.He didnt move for a second.But then he looked down and smiled faintly at me.Happy Birthday, Sassenach, he said.It took me completely by surprise and I just stared stupidly at him for a moment.What?I managed at last.I said Happy Birthday.Its the twentieth of October today.Is it?I said dumbly.Id lost track.I was shaking again, from cold and shock and the force of my tirade.He drew me close against him and held me, smoothing his big hands lightly over my hair, cradling my head against his chest.I began to cry again, but this time with relief.In my state of upheaval, it seemed logical that if he knew my real age and still wanted me, then everything would be all right.Jamie picked me up, and holding me carefully against his shoulder, carried me to the side of the fire, where he had laid the horses saddle.He sat down, leaning against the saddle, and held me, light and close.A long time later, he spoke.All right.Tell me now.I told him.Told him everything, haltingly but coherently.I felt numb from exhaustion, but content, like a rabbit that has outrun a fox, and found temporary shelter under a log.It isnt sanctuary, but at least it is respite.And I told him about Frank.Frank, he said softly.Then he isna dead, after all.He isnt born.I felt another small wave of hysteria break against my ribs, but managed to keep myself under control.Neither am I.   He stroked and patted me back into silence, making his small murmuring Gaelic sounds.When I took ye from Randall at Fort William, he said suddenly, you were trying to get back.Back to the stones.AndFrank.Thats why ye left the grove.Yes.And I beat you for it.His voice was soft with regret.You couldnt know.I couldnt tell you.I was beginning to feel very drowsy indeed.No, I dinna suppose ye could.He pulled the plaid closer around me, tucking it gently around my shoulders.Do ye sleep now, mo duinne.No one shall harm ye; Im here.I burrowed into the warm curve of his shoulder, letting my tired mind fall through the layers of oblivion.I forced myself to the surface long enough to ask, Do you really believe me, Jamie?He sighed, and smiled ruefully down at me.Aye, I believe ye, Sassenach.But it would ha been a good deal easier if youd only been a witch.* * *    I slept like the dead, awakening sometime after dawn with a terrible headache, stiff in every muscle.Jamie had a few handfuls of oats in a small bag in his sporran, and forced me to eat drammachoats mixed with cold water.It stuck in my throat, but I choked it down.He was slow and gentle with me, but spoke very little.After breakfast, he quickly packed up the small campsite and saddled Donas.Numb with the shock of recent events, I didnt even ask where we were going.Mounted behind him, I was content to rest my face against the broad slope of his back, feeling the motion of the horse rock me into a state of mindless trance.We came down from the braes near Loch Madoch, pressing through the chilly dawn mist to the edge of a still sheet of grey.Wild ducks began to rise from the reeds in untidy flocks that circled the marshes, quacking and calling to rouse late sleepers below.By contrast, a well disciplined wedge of geese passed over us, calling of heartbreak and desolation.The grey fog lifted near midday on the second day, and a weak sun lighted the meadows filled with yellow gorse and broom.A few miles past the loch, we came out onto a narrow road and turned northwest.The way took us up again, rising into low rolling hills that gave way gradually to granite tors and crags.We met few travelers on the road, and prudently turned aside into the brush whenever hoofbeats were heard ahead.The vegetation turned to pine forest.I sniffed deeply, enjoying the crisp resinous air, though it was turning chill toward dusk.We stopped for the night in a small clearing some way from the path.We scooped together a nestlike wallow of pine needles and blankets and huddled close together for warmth, covered by Jamies plaid and blanket.He woke me sometime in the darkness and made love to me, slowly and tenderly, not speaking.I watched stars winking through the lattice of black branches overhead, and fell asleep again with his comforting weight still warm on top of me.In the morning Jamie seemed more cheerful, or at least more peaceful, as though a difficult decision had been reached.He promised me hot tea for supper, which was small comfort then in the frigid air.Sleepily I followed him back to the path, brushing pine needles and small spiders from my skirt.The narrow path faded during the morning to no more than a faint trace through rough sheeps fescue, zigzagging around the more prominent rocks.I had been paying little attention to our surroundings, as I dreamily enjoyed the growing warmth of the sun, but suddenly my eye struck a familiar rock formation and I started out of my torpor.I knew where we were.And why.Jamie!He turned at my exclamation.You didna know?he asked curiously.That we were coming here?No, of course not.I felt mildly sick.The hill of Craigh na Dun was no more than a mile away; I could see the hump backed shape of it through the last shreds of the morning mist.I swallowed hard.I had tried for nearly six months to reach this place.Now that I was here at last, I wanted to be anywhere else.The standing stones on the hilltop were invisible from below, but they seemed to emanate a subtle terror that reached out for me.Well below the summit, the footing grew too uncertain for Donas.We dismounted and tethered him to a scrubby pine, continuing on foot.I was panting and sweating by the time we reached the granite ledge; Jamie showed no signs of exertion, save a faint flush rising from the neck of his shirt.It was quiet here above the pines, but with a steady wind whining faintly in the crevices of the rock.Swallows shot past the ledge, rising abruptly on the air currents in pursuit of insects, dropping like dive bombers, slender wings outspread.Jamie took my hand to pull me up the last step to the wide flat ledge at the base of the cleft rock.He didnt release it, but drew me close, looking carefully at me, as though memorizing my features.Why?I began, gasping for breath.Its your place, he said roughly.Isnt it?Yes.I stared as though hypnotized at the stone circle.It looks just the same.Jamie followed me into the circle.Taking me by the arm, he marched firmly up to the split rock.Is it this one?he demanded.Yes.I tried to pull away.Careful!Dont go too near it!He glanced from me to the rock, clearly skeptical.Perhaps he was right to be.I felt suddenly doubtful of the truth of my own story.II dont know anything about it.Perhaps thewhatever it isclosed behind me.Maybe it only works at certain times of the year.It was near Beltane when I came through last.Jamie glanced over his shoulder at the sun, a flat disc hanging in mid sky behind a thin screen of cloud.Its almost Samhain now, he said.All Hallows Eve.Seems suitable, no?He shivered involuntarily, in spite of the joke.When youcame through.What did ye do?I tried to remember.I felt ice cold, and I folded my hands under my armpits.I walked round the circle, looking at things.Just randomly, though; there was no pattern.And then I came near to the split rock, and I heard a buzzing, like bees  It was still like bees.I drew back as though it had been the rattle of a snake.Its still here!I reared in panic, throwing my arms around Jamie, but he set me firmly away from him, his face white, and turned me once again toward the stone.What then?The keening wind was sharp in my ears, but his voice was sharper still.I put my hand on the rock.Do it, then.He pushed me closer, and when I did not respond, he grasped my wrist and planted my hand firmly against the brindled surface.Chaos reached out and grabbed me.The sun stopped whirling behind my eyes at last, and the shriek faded out of my ears.There was another persistent noise, Jamie calling my name.I felt too sick to sit up or open my eyes, but I flapped my hand weakly, to let him know I was still alive.Im all right, I said.Are ye then?Oh, God, Claire!He clasped me against his chest then, holding me tightly.Jesus, Claire.I thought ye were dead, sure.Youyou began togo, somehow.You had the most awful look on your face, like ye were frightened to death.II pulled ye back from the stone.I stopped ye, I shouldna have done soIm sorry, lassie.My eyes were open enough now to see his face above me, shocked and frightened.Its all right.It was still an effort to speak, and I felt heavy and disoriented, but things were coming clearer.I tried to smile, but felt nothing more than a twitch.At leastwe knowit still works.Oh, God.Aye, it works.He cast a glance of fearful loathing at the stone.He left me long enough to wet a kerchief in a puddle of rainwater that stood in one of the stony depressions.He wet my face, still muttering reassurances and apologies.At last I felt well enough to sit up.You didnt believe me after all, did you?Groggy as I was, I felt somehow vindicated.Its true, though.Aye, its true.He sat next to me, staring at the stone for several minutes.I rubbed the wet cloth over my face, feeling still faint and dizzy.Suddenly he sprang to his feet, walked to the rock and slapped his hand against it.Nothing whatsoever happened, and after a minute his shoulders slumped and he came back to me.Maybe its only women it works on, I said fuzzily.Its always women in the legends.Or maybe its only me.Well, it isna me, he said.Better make sure, though.Jamie!Be careful!I shouted, to no avail.He marched to the stone, slapped it again, threw himself against it, walked through the split and back again, but it remained no more than a solid stone monolith.As for myself, I shuddered at the thought of even approaching that door to madness once again.And yet.Yet when I had begun to pass into the realm of chaos this time, I had been thinking of Frank.And I had felt him, I was sure of it.Somewhere in the void had been a tiny pinprick of light, and he was in it.I knew.I knew also that there had been another point of light, one that sat still beside me, staring at the stone, cheeks gleaming with sweat in spite of the chill of the day.At last he turned to me and grasped both my hands.He raised them to his lips and kissed each one formally.My lady, he said softly.MyClaire.Its no use in waiting.I must part wi ye now.My lips were too stiff to speak, but the expression on my face must have been as easily readable as usual.Claire, he said urgently, its your own time on the other side ofthat thing.Youve a home there, a place.The things that youre used to.Andand Frank.Yes, I said, theres Frank.Jamie caught me by the shoulders, pulling me to my feet and shaking me gently in supplication.Theres nothing for ye on this side, lass!Nothing save violence and danger.Go!He pushed me slightly, turning me toward the stone circle.I turned back to him, catching his hands.Is there really nothing for me here, Jamie?I held his eyes, not letting him turn away from me.He pulled himself gently from my grasp without answering and stood back, suddenly a figure from another time, seen in relief upon a background of hazy hills, the life in his face a trick of the shadowing rock, as if flattened beneath layers of paint, an artists reminiscence of forgotten places and passions turned to dust.I looked into his eyes, filled with pain and yearning, and he was flesh again, real and immediate, lover, husband, man.The anguish I felt must have been reflected in my face, for he hesitated, then turned to the east and pointed down the slope.Do ye see behind the small clump of oak down there?About halfway.I saw the clump, and saw what he was pointing at, the half ruined crofters cottage, abandoned on the haunted hill.I shall go down to the house, and I shall stay there til the evening.To make sureto be sure that youre safe.He looked at me, but made no move to touch me.He closed his eyes, as though he could no longer bear to look at me.Goodbye, he said, and turned to go.I watched him, numb, and then remembered.There was something that I had to tell him.I called after him.Jamie!He stopped and stood motionless for a moment, fighting to control his face.It was white and strained and his lips were bloodless when he turned back to me.Aye?Theres somethingI mean, I have to tell you something beforebefore I go.He closed his eyes briefly, and I thought he swayed, but it might have been only the wind tugging at his kilts.Theres no need, he said.No.Do ye go, lass.Ye shouldna tarry.Go.He made to turn away, but I clutched him by the sleeve.Jamie, listen to me!You must!He shook his head helplessly, lifting a hand as though to push me away.Claireno.I cant.The wind was bringing the moisture to his eyes.Its the Rising, I said urgently, shaking his arm.Jamie, listen.Prince Charliehis army.Colum is right!Do you hear me, Jamie?Colum is right, not Dougal.Eh?What dye mean, lass?I had his attention now.He rubbed his sleeve across his face and the eyes that looked down at me were sharp and clear.The wind sang in my ears.Prince Charlie.There will be a Rising, Dougals right about that, but it wont succeed.Charlies army will do well for a bit, but it will end in slaughter.At Culloden, thats where it will end.Thethe clans In my minds eye I saw the clanstones, the grey boulders that would lie scattered on the field, each stone bearing the single clan name of the butchered men who lay under it.I took a breath and gripped his hand to steady myself.It was cold as a corpses.I shuddered and closed my eyes to concentrate on what I was saying.The Highlandersall the clans that follow Charliewill be wiped out.Hundreds and hundreds of the clansmen will die at Culloden; those that are left will be hunted and killed.The clans will be crushedand theyll not rise again.Not in your timenot even in mine.I opened my eyes to find him staring at me, expressionless.Jamie, stay out of it!I begged him.Keep your people out of it if you can, but for the Lords sakeJamie, if you I broke off.I had been going to say Jamie, if you love me.But I couldnt.I was going to lose him forever, and if I could not speak of love to him before, I could not do it now.Dont go to France, I said, softly.Go to America, or to Spain, to Italy.But for the sake of the people who love you, Jamie, dont set foot on Culloden Field.He went on staring at me.I wondered if he had heard.Jamie?Did you hear me?Do you understand?After a moment, he nodded numbly.Aye, he said quietly, so quietly I could hardly hear him, beneath the whining of the wind.Aye, I hear.He dropped my hand.Go wi Godmo duinne.He stepped off the ledge and made his way down the steep incline, bracing his feet against tufts of grass, catching at branches to keep his balance, not looking back.I watched him until he disappeared into the oak clump, walking slowly, like a man wounded, who knows he must keep moving, but feels his life ebbing slowly away through the fingers he has clenched over the wound.My knees were trembling.Slowly, I lowered myself to the granite shelf and sat cross legged, watching the swallows about their business.Below, I could just see the roof of the cottage that now held my past.At my back loomed the cleft stone.And my future.I sat without moving through the afternoon.I tried to force all emotion from my mind and use reason.Jamie certainly had logic on his side when he argued that I should go back: home, safety, Frank; even the small amenities of life that I sorely missed from time to time, like hot baths and indoor plumbing, to say nothing of larger considerations such as proper medical care and convenient travel.And yet, while I would certainly admit the inconveniences and outright dangers of this place, I would have also to admit that I had enjoyed many aspects of it.If travel was inconvenient, there were no enormous stretches of concrete blanketing the countryside, nor any noisy, stinking autoscontrivances with their own dangers, I reminded myself.Life was much simpler, and so were the people.Not less intelligent, but much more directwith a few sterling exceptions like Colum ban Campbell MacKenzie, I thought grimly.Because of Uncle Lambs work, I had lived in a great many places, many even cruder and more lacking in amenities than this one.I adapted quite easily to rough conditions, and did not really miss civilization when away from it, though I adapted just as easily to the presence of niceties like electric cookers and hot water geysers.I shivered in the cold wind, hugging myself as I stared at the rock.Rationality did not appear to be helping much.I turned to emotion, and began, shrinking from the task, to reconstruct the details of my married livesfirst with Frank, then with Jamie.The only result of this was to leave me shattered and weeping, the tears forming icy trails on my face.Well, if not reason nor emotion, what of duty?I had given Frank a wedding vow, and had meant it with all my heart.I had given Jamie the same, meaning to betray it as soon as possible.And which of them would I betray now?I continued to sit, as the sun sank lower in the sky and the swallows disappeared to their nests.As the evening star began to glow among the black pines branches, I concluded that in this situation reason was of little use.I would have to rely on something else; just what, I wasnt sure.I turned toward the split rock and took a step, then another, and another.Pausing, I faced around and tried it in the other direction.A step, then another, and another, and before I even knew that I had decided, I was halfway down the slope, scrabbling wildly at grass clumps, slipping and falling through the patches of granite scree.When I reached the cottage, breathless with fear lest he had left already, I was reassured to see Donas hobbled and grazing nearby.The horse raised his head and eyed me unpleasantly.Walking softly, I pushed the door open.He was in the front room, asleep on a narrow oak settle.He slept on his back, as he usually did, hands crossed on his stomach, mouth slightly open.The last rays of daylight from the window behind me limned his face like a metal mask; the silver tracks of dried tears glinted on golden skin, and the copper stubble of his beard gleamed dully.I stood watching him for a moment, filled with an unutterable tenderness.Moving as quietly as I could, I lay down beside him on the narrow settle and nestled close.He turned to me in sleep as he so often did, gathering me spoon fashion against his chest and resting his cheek against my hair.Half conscious, he reached to smooth my hair away from his nose; I felt the sudden jerk as he came awake to realize that I was there, and then we overbalanced and crashed together onto the floor, Jamie on top of me.I didnt have the slightest doubt that he was solid flesh.I pushed a knee into his abdomen, grunting.Get off!I cant breathe!Instead, he aggravated my breathless condition by kissing me thoroughly.I ignored the lack of oxygen temporarily in order to concentrate on more important things.We held each other for a long time without speaking.At last he murmured Why?his mouth muffled in my hair.I kissed his cheek, damp and salty.I could feel his heart beating against my ribs, and wanted nothing more than to stay there forever, not moving, not making love, just breathing the same air.I had to, I said.I laughed, a little shakily.You dont know how close it was.The hot baths nearly won.And I wept then, and shook a little, because the choice was so freshly made, and because my joy for the man I held in my arms was mingled with a tearing grief for the man I would never see again.Jamie held me tightly, pressing me down with his weight, as though to protect me, to save me from being swept away by the roaring pull of the stone circle.At length my tears were spent, and I lay exhausted, head against his comforting chest.It had grown altogether dark by this time, but still he held me, murmuring softly as though I were a child afraid of the night.We clung to each other, unwilling to let go even long enough to start a fire or light a candle.At length Jamie rose, and picking me up, carried me to the settle, where he sat with me cradled on his lap.The door of the cottage still hung open, and we could see the stars beginning to burn over the valley below.Do you know, I said drowsily, that it takes thousands and thousands of years for the light of those stars to reach us?In fact, some of the stars we see may be dead by now, but we wont know it, because we still see the light.Is that so?he answered, stroking my back.I didna know that.I must have fallen asleep, head on his shoulder, but roused briefly when he laid me gently on the floor, on a makeshift bed of blankets from the horses saddleroll.He lay down beside me, and drew me close again.Lay your head, lass, he whispered.In the morning, Ill take ye home.* * *    We rose just before dawn, and were on the downward trail when the sun rose, eager to leave Craigh na Dun.Where are we going, Jamie?I asked, rejoicing that I could look forward into a future that held him, even as I left behind the last chance of returning to the man who hadwho would?once love me.Jamie reined in the horse, pausing to look over his shoulder for a moment.The forbidding circle of standing stones was invisible from here, but the rocky hillside seemed to rise impassable behind us, bristling with boulders and gorse bushes.From here, the crumbling husk of the cottage looked like one more crag, a bony knuckle jutting from the granite fist of the hill.I wish I could have fought him for you, he said abruptly, looking back at me.His blue eyes were dark and earnest.I smiled at him, touched.It wasnt your fight, it was mine.But you won it anyway.I reached out a hand, and he squeezed it.Aye, but thats not what I meant.If Id fought him man to man and won, yed not need to feel any regret over it.He hesitated.If ever  There arent any more ifs, I said firmly.I thought of every one of them yesterday, and here I still am.Thank God, he said, smiling, and God help you.Then he added, Though Ill never understand why.I put my arms around his waist and held on as the horse slithered down the last steep slope.Because, I said, I bloody well cant do without you, Jamie Fraser, and thats all about it.Now, where are you taking me?Jamie twisted in his saddle, to look back up the slope.I prayed all the way up that hill yesterday, he said softly.Not for you to stay; I didna think that would be right.I prayed Id be strong enough to send ye away.He shook his head, still gazing up the hill, a faraway look in his eyes.I said Lord, if Ive never had courage in my life before, let me have it now.Let me be brave enough not to fall on my knees and beg her to stay.He pulled his eyes away from the cottage and smiled briefly at me.Hardest thing I ever did, Sassenach.He turned in the saddle, and reined the horses head toward the east.It was a rare bright morning, and the early sun gilded everything, drawing a thin line of fire along the edge of the reins, the curve of the horses neck, and the broad planes of Jamies face and shoulders.He took a deep breath and nodded across the moor, toward a distant pass between two crags.So now I suppose I can do the second hardest thing.He kicked the horse gently, clicking his tongue.Were going home, Sassenach.To Lallybroch.PART FIVE      Lallybroch      26    THE LAIRDS RETURN    At first, we were so happy only to be with each other and away from Leoch than we didnt talk much.Across the flat of the moor, Donas could carry us both without strain, and I rode with my arms about Jamies waist, glorying in the feel of the sun warmed muscle shifting under my cheek.Whatever problems we might be facingand I knew there were plentywe were together.Forever.And that was enough.As the first shock of happiness mellowed into the glow of companionship, we began to talk again.About the countryside through which we were passing, at first.Then, cautiously, about me, and where I had come from.He was fascinated by my descriptions of modern life, though I could tell that most of my stories seemed like fairy tales to him.He loved especially the descriptions of automobiles, tanks, and airplanes, and made me describe them over and over, as minutely as I could.By tacit agreement, we avoided any mention of Frank.As we covered more countryside, the conversation turned back to our present time; Colum, the Castle, then the stag hunt and the Duke.He seems a nice chap, Jamie remarked.As the going became rougher, he had dismounted and walked alongside, which made conversation easier.I thought so too, I answered.But  Oh, aye, ye canna put too much faith in what a man seems these days, he agreed.Still, we got on, he and I.  Wed sit together and talk of an evening, found the fire in the hunting lodge.Hes a good bit brighter than he seems, for the one thing; he knows how that voice makes him seem, and I think he uses it to make himself look a bit of a fool, while all the time the mind is there, workin behind his eyes.Mmm.Thats what Im afraid of.Did youtell him?He shrugged.A bit.He knew my name, of course, from that time before, at the castle.I laughed at the memory of his account of that time.Did you, er, reminisce about old times?He grinned, the ends of his hair floating about his face in the autumn breeze.Oh, just a bit.He asked me once whether I still suffered from stomach trouble.I kept my face straight and answered that as a rule, no, but I thought perhaps I felt a bit of griping coming on just now.He laughed, and said he hoped it did not discommode my beautiful wife.I laughed myself.Right now, what the Duke might or mightnt do didnt seem of overwhelming importance.Nevertheless, he might one day be of use.I told him a little, Jamie went on.That I was outlawed, but not guilty of the charge, though Id have precious little chance of proving it.He seemed sympathetic, but I was cautious about telling him the circumstanceslet alone the fact that theres a price on my head.I hadna yet made up my mind whether to trust him with the rest of it, whenwell, when Old Alec came tearing into the camp like the devil himself was on his tail, and Murtagh and I left the same way.This reminded me.Where is Murtagh?I asked.He came back with you to Leoch?I hoped the little clansman hadnt fallen afoul of either Colum or the villagers of Cranesmuir.He started back wi me, but the beast he was riding was no match for Donas.Aye, a bonny wee lad ye are, Donas mo buidheag.He slapped the shimmering sorrel neck, and Donas snorted and ruffled his mane.Jamie glanced up at me and smiled.Dinna worry for Murtagh.Theres a canty wee bird can mind for himself.Canty?Murtagh?I knew the word meant cheerful, which seemed incongruous to a degree.I dont think Ive ever seen him smile.Have you?Oh, aye.At least twice.How long have you known him?Twenty three years.Hes my godfather.Oh.Well, that explains a bit.I didnt think hed bother on my account.Jamie patted my leg.Of course he would.He likes you.Ill take your word for it.Having thus approached the subject of recent events, I took a deep breath and asked something I badly wanted to know.Jamie?Aye?Geillis Duncan.Will theywill they really burn her?He glanced up at me, frowning slightly, and nodded.I expect so.Not til after the child is born, though.Is that what troubles ye?One of the things.Jamie, look at this.I tried to push up the voluminous sleeve, failed, and settled for pulling the neck of the shirt off my shoulder to display my vaccination scar.God in heaven, he said slowly, after I had explained.He looked sharply at me.So thats whyis she from your own time then?I shrugged helplessly.I dont know.All I can say is that she was likely born sometime after 1920; thats when public inoculation came in.I looked over my shoulder, but low lying clouds hid the crags that now separated us from Leoch.I dont suppose I ever will knownow.Jamie took Donass reins and led him aside, under a small pine grove, on the banks of a small stream.He grasped me around the waist and lifted me down.Dinna grieve for her, he said firmly, holding me.Shes a wicked woman; a murderer, if not a witch.She did kill her husband, no?Yes, I said, with a shudder, remembering Arthur Duncans glazed eyes.I still dinna understand why she should kill him, though, he said, shaking his head in puzzlement.He had money, a good position.And I doubt he beat her.I looked at him in exasperated amazement.And thats your definition of a good husband?Wellyes, he said, frowning.What else might she want?What else?I was so taken aback, I just looked at him for a moment, then slid down on the grass and started to laugh.Whats funny?I thought this was murder.He smiled, though, and put an arm around me.I was just thinking, I said, still snorting a bit, if your definition of a good husband is one with money and position who doesnt beat his wifewhat does that make you?Oh, he said.He grinned.Well, Sassenach, I never said I was a good husband.Neither did you.Sadist, I think ye called me, and a few other things that I wouldna repeat for the sake of decency.But not a good husband.Good.Then I wont feel obliged to poison you with cyanide.Cyanide?He looked down curiously at me.Whats that?The thing that killed Arthur Duncan.Its a bloody fast, powerful poison.Fairly common in my time, but not here.I licked my lips meditatively.I tasted it on his lips, and just that tiny bit was enough to make my whole face go numb.It acts almost instantly, as you saw.I should have known thenabout Geilie, I mean.I imagine she made it from crushed peach pits or cherry stones, though it must have been the devil of a job.Did she tell ye why she did it, then?I sighed and rubbed my feet.My shoes had been lost in the struggle at the loch, and I tended to pick up stickers and cockleburs, my feet not being hardened as Jamies were.That and a good deal more.If theres anything to eat in your saddlebags, why dont you fetch it, and Ill tell you all about it.* * *    We entered the valley of Broch Tuarach the next day.As we came down out of the foothills, I spotted a solitary rider, some distance away, heading roughly in our direction.He was the first person I had seen since we had left Cranesmuir.The man approaching us was stout and prosperous looking, with a snowy stock showing at the neck of a serviceable grey serge coat, its long tails covering all but an inch or two of his breeches.We had been traveling for the best part of a week, sleeping out of doors, washing in the cold, fresh water of the burns, and living quite well off such rabbits and fish as Jamie could catch, and such edible plants and berries as I could find.Between our efforts, our diet was better than that in the Castle, fresher, and certainly more varied, if a little unpredictable.But if nutrition was well served by an outdoor life, appearance was another thing, and I took hasty stock of our looks as the gentleman on horseback hesitated, frowning, then changed direction and trotted slowly toward us to investigate.Jamie, who had insisted on walking most of the way to spare the horse, was a disreputable sight indeed, hose stained to the knees with reddish dust, spare shirt torn by brambles and a weeks growth of beard bristling fiercely from cheek and jaw.His hair had grown long enough in the last months to reach his shoulders.Usually clubbed into a queue or laced back, it was free now, thick and unruly, with small bits of leaf and stick caught in the disordered coppery locks.Face burned a deep ruddy bronze, boots cracked from walking, dirk and sword thrust through his belt, he looked a wild Highlander indeed.I was hardly better.Covered modestly enough in the billows of Jamies best shirt and the remnants of my shirt, barefoot, and shawled in his plaid, I looked a right ragamuffin.Encouraged by the misty dampness and lacking any restraint in the form of comb or brush, my hair rioted all over my head.It had grown as well during my sojourn at the Castle, and floated in clouds and tangles about my shoulders, drifting into my eyes whenever the wind was behind us, as it was now.Shoving the wayward locks out of my eyes, I watched the cautious approach of the gentleman in grey.Jamie, seeing him, brought our own horse to a stop and waited for him to draw near enough for speech.Its Jock Graham, he said to me, from up the way at Murch Nardagh.The man came within a few yards, reined up and sat looking us over carefully.His eyes, pouched with fat, crinkled and rested suspiciously on Jamie, then suddenly sprang wide.Lallybroch?he said unbelievingly.Jamie nodded benignly.With a completely unfounded air of proprietorial pride, he laid a hand on my thigh and said, and my lady Lallybroch.Jock Grahams mouth dropped an inch or two, then was hastily drawn up again into an expression of flustered respect.Ahmylady, he said, belatedly doffing his hat and bowing in my direction.Youll be, er, going home, then?he asked, trying to keep his fascinated gaze from resting on my leg, bared to the knee by a rent in my shift, and stained with elderberry juice.Aye.Jamie glanced over his shoulder, toward the rift in the hill he had told me was the entrance to Broch Tuarach.Youll have been there lately, Jock?Graham pulled his eyes away from me and looked at Jamie.Och?Oh, aye.Aye, Ive been there.Theyre all well.Be pleased to see ye, I expect.Go well, then, Fraser.And with a hasty dig into his horses ribs, he turned aside and headed up the valley.We watched him go.Suddenly, a hundred yards away, he paused.Turning in the saddle, he rose in his stirrups and cupped his mouth to shout.The sound, borne by the wind, reached us thin but distinct.Welcome home!And he disappeared over a rise.* * *    Broch Tuarach means the north facing tower.From the side of the mountain above, the broch that gave the small estate its name was no more than another mound of rocks, much like those that lay at the foot of the hills we had been traveling through.We came down through a narrow, rocky gap between two crags, leading the horse between boulders.Then the going was easier, the land sloping more gently down through the fields and scattered cottages, until at last we struck a small winding road that led to the house.It was larger than I had expected; a handsome three story manor of harled white stone, windows outlined in the natural grey stone, a high slate roof with multiple chimneys, and several smaller whitewashed buildings clustered about it, like chicks about a hen.The old stone broch, situated on a small rise to the rear of the house, rose sixty feet above the ground, cone topped like a witchs hat, girdled with three rows of tiny arrow slits.As we drew near, there was a sudden terrible racket from the direction of the outbuildings, and Donas shied and reared.No horseman, I promptly fell off, landing ignominiously in the dusty road.With an eye for the relative importance of things, Jamie leapt for the plunging horses bridle, leaving me to fend for myself.The dogs were almost upon me, baying and growling, by the time I found my feet.To my panicked eyes, there seemed to be at least a dozen of them, all with teeth bared and wicked.There was a shout from Jamie.Bran!Luke!Sheas!The dogs skidded to a halt within a few feet of me, confused.They milled, growling uncertainly, until he spoke again.Sheas, mo maise!Stand, ye wee heathen!They did, and the largest dogs tail began gradually to wag, once, and then twice, questioningly.Claire.Come take the horse.Hell not let them close, and its me they want.Walk slowly; theyll no harm ye.He spoke casually, not to alarm either horse or dogs further.I was not so sanguine, but edged carefully toward him.Donas jerked his head and rolled his eyes as I took the bridle, but I was in no mood to put up with tantrums, and I yanked the rein firmly down and grabbed the headstall.The thick velvet lips writhed back from his teeth, but I jerked harder.I put my face close to the big glaring golden eye and glared back.Dont try it!I warned, or youll end up as dogsmeat, and I wont lift a hand to save you!Jamie meanwhile was slowly walking toward the dogs, one hand held out fistlike toward them.What had seemed a large pack was only four dogs: a small brownish rat terrier, two ruffed and spotted shepherds, and a huge black and tan monster that could have stood in for the Hound of the Baskervilles with no questions asked.This slavering creature stretched out a neck thicker than my waist and sniffed gently at the proffered knuckles.A tail like a ships cable beat back and forth with increasing fervor.Then it flung back its enormous head, baying with joy, and leaped on its master, knocking him flat in the road.In which Odysseus returns from the Trojan War and is recognized by his faithful hound,  I remarked to Donas, who snorted briefly, giving his opinion either of Homer, or of the undignified display of emotion going on in the roadway.Jamie, laughing, was ruffling the fur and pulling the ears of the dogs, who were all trying to lick his face at once.Finally he beat them back sufficiently to rise, keeping his feet with difficulty against their ecstatic demonstrations.Well, someones glad to see me, at any rate, he said, grinning, as he patted the beasts head.Thats Luke he pointed to the terrier, and Elphin and Mars.Brothers, they are, and bonny sheep dogs.And this, he laid an affectionate hand on the enormous black head, which slobbered in appreciation, is Bran.Ill take your word for it, I said, cautiously extending a knuckle to be sniffed.What is he?A staghound.He scratched the pricked ears, quoting  Thus Fingal chose his hounds:  Eye like sloe, ear like leaf,  Chest like horse, hough like sickle  And the tail joint far from the head.If those are the qualifications, then youre right, I said, inspecting Bran.If his tail joint were any further from his head, you could ride him.I used to, when I was smallnot Bran, I dont mean, but his grandfather, Nairn.He gave the hound a final pat and straightened, gazing toward the house.He took the restive Donass bridle and turned him downhill.In which Odysseus returns to his home, disguised as a beggar, he quoted in Greek, having picked up my earlier remark.And now, he said, straightening his collar with some grimness, I suppose its time to go and deal with Penelope and her suitors.When we reached the double doors, the dogs panting at our heels, Jamie hesitated.Should we knock?I asked, a bit nervous.He looked at me in astonishment.Its my home, he said, and pushed the door open.He led me through the house, ignoring the few startled servants we passed, past the entrance hall and through a small gun room, into the drawing room.It boasted a wide hearth with a polished mantel, and bits of silver and glass gleamed here and there, capturing the late afternoon sun.For a moment, I thought the room was empty.Then I saw a faint movement in one corner near the hearth.She was smaller than I had expected.With a brother like Jamie, I had imagined her at least my height, or even taller, but the woman by the fire barely reached five feet.Her back was to us as she reached for something on the shelf of the china cabinet, and the ends of her dress sash dipped close to the floor.Jamie froze when he saw her.Jenny, he said.The woman turned and I caught an impression of brows black as ink squills, and blue eyes wide in a white face before she launched herself at her brother.Jamie!Small as she was, she jarred him with the impact of her embrace.His arms went about her shoulders in reflex and they clung for a moment, her face tight against his shirtfront, his hand tender on the nape of her neck.On his face was an expression of such mingled uncertainty and yearning joy that I felt almost an intruder.Then she pressed herself closer to him, murmuring something in Gaelic, and his expression dissolved in shock.He grasped her by the arms and held her away from him, looking down.The faces were much alike; the same oddly slanted dark blue eyes and broad cheekbones.The same thin, blade bridged nose, just a trifle too long.But she was dark where Jamie was fair, with cascades of black curly hair, bound back with green ribbon.She was beautiful, with clear drawn features and alabaster skin.She was also clearly in a state of advanced pregnancy.Jamie had gone white at the lips.Jenny, he whispered, shaking his head.Oh, Jenny.Mo cridh.Her attention was distracted just then by the appearance of a small child in the doorway, and she pulled away from her brother without noticing his discomposure.She took the little boys hand and led him into the room, murmuring encouragement.He hung back a little, thumb in mouth for comfort, peering up at the strangers from behind his mothers skirts.For his mother she plainly was.He had her mop of thick, curly black hair and the square set of her shoulders, though the face was not hers.This is wee Jamie, she said, looking proudly down at the lad.And this is your uncle Jamie, mo cridh, the one youre named for.For me?You named him for me?Jamie looked like a fighter who has just been punched very hard in the stomach.He backed away from mother and child until he blundered into a chair, and sank into it as though the strength had gone from his legs.He hid his face in his hands.His sister by this time was aware that something was amiss.She touched him tentatively on the shoulder.Jamie?What is it, my dearie?Are ye ill?He looked up at her then, and I could see his eyes were full of tears.Did ye have to do that, Jenny?Do ye think that Ive not suffered enough for what happenedfor what I let happenthat ye must name Randalls bastard for me, to be a reproach to me so long as I live?Jennys face, normally pale, lost all vestiges of color.Randalls bastard?she said blankly.John Randall, ye mean?The Redcoat captain?Aye, the Redcoat captain.Who else would I mean, for Gods sake!Youll remember him, I suppose?Jamie was recovering enough of his customary poise for sarcasm.Jenny eyed her brother closely, one arched brow lifted in suspicion.Have ye lost your senses, man?she inquired.Or have ye taken a drop too much along the way?I should never have come back, he muttered.He rose then, stumbling slightly and tried to pass without touching her.She stood her ground, however, and gripped him by the arm.Correct me, brother, if Im wrong, Jenny said slowly, but Ive the strong impression youre saying Ive played the whore to Captain Randall, and what Im askin myself is what maggots youve got in your brain to make ye say so?Maggots, is it?Jamie turned to her, mouth twisted with bitterness.I wish it were so; Id rather I was dead and in my grave than to see my sister brought to such a pass.He seized her by the shoulders, and shook her slightly, crying out, Why, Jenny, why?To have ye ruin yourself for me was shame enough to kill me.But this He dropped his hands then, with a gesture of despair that took in the protruding belly, swelling accusingly under the light smocking.He turned abruptly toward the door, and an elderly woman, who had been listening avidly with the child clinging to her skirts, drew back in alarm.I should not have come.Ill go.Youll do no such thing, Jamie Fraser, his sister said sharply.Not before youve listened to me.Sit yourself down, then, and Ill tell ye about Captain Randall, since ye want to know.I dont want to know!I dont want to hear it!As she advanced toward him, he turned sharply away to the window that looked out over the yard.She followed him, saying Jamie, but he repelled her with a violent gesture.No!Dont talk to me!Ive said I canna bear to hear it!Och, is that a fact?She eyed her brother, standing at the window with his legs braced wide apart, hands on the sill and back stubbornly set against her.She bit her lip and a calculating look came over her face.Quick as lightning, she stooped and her hand shot under his kilt like a striking snake.Jamie let out a roar of sheer outrage and stood bolt upright with shock.He tried to turn, then froze as she apparently tightened her grip.Theres men as are sensible, she said to me, with a wicked smile, and beasts as are biddable.Others yell do nothing with, unless ye have em by the ballocks.Now, ye can listen to me in a civil way, she said to her brother, or I can twist a bit.Hey?He stood still, red faced, breathing heavily through clenched teeth.Ill listen, he said, and then Ill wring your wee neck, Janet!Let me go!No sooner did she oblige than he whirled on her.What in hell dye think youre doing?he demanded.Tryin to shame me before my own wife?Jenny was not fazed by his outrage.She rocked back on her heels, viewing her brother and me sardonically.Weel, and if shes your wife, I expect shes more familiar wi your balls than what I am.I havena seen them myself since ye got old enough to wash alone.Grown a bit, no?Jamies face went through several alarming transformations, as the dictates of civilized behavior struggled with the primitive impulse of a younger brother to clout his sister over the head.Civilization at length won out, and he said through his teeth, with what dignity he could summon, Leave my balls out of it.And then, since youll not rest til ye make me hear it, tell me about Randall.Tell me why ye disobeyed my orders and chose to dishonor yourself and your family instead.Jenny put her hands on her hips and drew herself to her full height, ready for combat.Slower than he to lose her temper; still she had one, no doubt of that.Oh, disobey your orders, is it?Thats what eats at ye, Jamie, isnt it?You know best, and well all do as ye say, or well come to rack and ruin, nae doubt.She flounced angrily.And if Id done as you said, that day, youd ha been dead in the dooryard, Faither hanged or in prison for killing Randall, and the lands gone forfeit to the Crown.To say nothing of me, wi my home and family gone, needing to beg in the byroads to live.Not pale at all now, Jamie was flushed with anger.Aye, so ye chose to sell yourself rather than beg!Id sooner have died in my blood and seen Faither and the lands in hell along with me, and well ye know it!Aye, I know it!Youre a ninny, Jamie, and always have been!his sister returned in exasperation.Fine thing for you to say!Youre not content wi ruining your good name and my own, ye must go on with the scandal, and flaunt your shame to the whole neighborhood!Youll not speak to me in that way, James Fraser, brother or no!What dye mean, my shame?Ye great fool, you  What I mean?When youre goin about swelled out to here like a mad toad?He mimicked her belly with a contemptuous swipe of the hand.She took one step back, drew back her hand and slapped him with all the force she could muster.The impact jarred his head back and left a white outline of her fingers printed on his cheek.He slowly raised a hand to the mark, staring at his sister.Her eyes were glittering dangerously and her bosom heaved.The words spilled out in a torrent between clenched white teeth.Toad, is it?Stinking cowardyeve no more courage than to leave me here, thinking ye dead or imprisoned, wi no word from one day to the next, and then ye come strolling in one fine daywith a wife, no lessand sit in my drawing room calling me toad and harlot and  I didna call ye harlot, but I should!How can ye  Despite the differences in their heights, brother and sister were almost nose to nose, hissing at one another in an effort to keep their carrying voices from ringing through the old manor house.The effort was largely wasted, judging from the glimpses I caught of various interested faces peeping discreetly from kitchen, hall, and window.The laird of Broch Tuarach was having an interesting homecoming, to be sure.I thought it best to let them have it out without my presence, and so I stepped quietly into the hall, with an awkward nod to the elderly woman, and continued into the yard.There was a small arbor there with a bench, on which I seated myself, looking about with interest.Besides the arbor, there was a small walled garden, blooming with the last of the summer roses.Beyond it was what Jamie referred to as the doocot; or so I assumed, from the assorted pigeons that were fluttering in and out of the pierced work opening at the top of the building.I knew there was a barn and a shed for silage; these must be to the other side of the house, with the farms granary and the henyard, kailyard, and disused chapel.Which still left a small stone building on this side unaccounted for.The light autumn wind was from that direction; I sniffed deeply, and was rewarded with the rich smell of hops and yeast.That was the brewhouse, then, where the beer and ale for the estate were made.The road past the gate led up and over a small hill.As I looked, a small group of men appeared at the crest, silhouetted in the evening light.They seemed to hover a moment, as though taking leave of each other.This appeared to be the case, for only one came down the hill toward the house, the others striking off through the fields toward a clump of cottages in the distance.As the single man came down the hill, I could see that he limped badly.When he came through the gate, the reason for it was apparent.The right leg was missing below the knee, and he wore a wooden peg in replacement.In spite of the limp, he moved youthfully.In fact, as he drew near to the arbor, I could see that he was only in his twenties.He was tall, nearly as tall as Jamie, but much narrower through the shoulder, thin, in fact, nearly to the point of skinniness.He paused at the entrance to the arbor, leaning heavily on the lattice, and looked in at me with interest.Thick brown hair fell smoothly over a high brow, and deepset brown eyes held a look of patient good humor.The voices of Jamie and his sister had risen while I waited outside.The windows were open to the warm weather, and the disputants were quite audible from the arbor, though not all the words were clear.Interfering, nosy bitch!came Jamies voice, loud on the soft evening air.Havena the decency to His sisters reply was lost in a sudden breeze.The newcomer nodded easily toward the house.Ah, Jamies home, then.I nodded in reply, not sure whether I should introduce myself.It didnt matter, for the young man smiled and inclined his head to me.Im Ian Murray, Jennys husband.And I imagine yell beah  The Sassenach wench Jamies married, I finished for him.My name is Claire.Did you know about it, then?I asked, as he laughed.My mind was racing.Jennys husband?Oh, aye.We heard from Joe Orr, whod got it from a tinker in Ardraigh.Ye canna keep anything secret long in the Highlands.You should know that, even if youve been wed as little as a month.Jennys been wondering for weeks what youd be like.Whore!Jamie bellowed from inside the house.Jennys husband didnt turn a hair, but went on examining me with friendly curiosity.Youre a bonny lass, he said, looking me over frankly.Are ye fond of Jamie?Wellyes.Yes, I am, I answered, a bit taken aback.I was becoming accustomed to the directness that characterized most Highlanders, but it still took me unawares from time to time.He pursed his lips and nodded as though satisfied, and sat down beside me on the bench.Better let them have a few minutes longer, he said, with a wave at the house, where the shouting had now turned to Gaelic.He seemed completely unconcerned as to the cause of the battle.Frasers dinna listen to anything when theyve their danders up.When theyve shouted themselves out, sometimes ye can make them see reason, but not til then.Yes, I noticed, I said dryly, and he laughed.So youve been wed long enough to find that out, eh?We heard as how Dougal made Jamie wed ye, he said, ignoring the battle and concentrating his attention on me.But Jenny said it would take more than Dougal MacKenzie to make Jamie do something he didna care to.Now that I see ye, of course I can see why he did it.He lifted his brows, inviting further explanation, but politely not forcing it.I imagine he had his reasons, I said, my attention divided between my companion and the house, where the sounds of combat continued.I dont wantI mean, I hope Ian correctly interpreted my hesitations and my glance toward the drawing room windows.Oh, I expect youve something to do with it.But shed take it out of him whether you were here or not.She loves Jamie something fierce, ye know, and she worried a lot while he was gone, especially with her father goin so sudden.Yell know about that?The brown eyes were sharp and observant, as though to gauge the depth of confidence between me and Jamie.Yes, Jamie told me.Ah.He nodded toward the house.Then, of course, shes wi child.Yes, I noticed that too, I said.Hard to miss, is it no?Ian answered with a grin, and we both laughed.Makes her frachetty, he explained, not that Id blame her.But it would take a braver man than me to cross words wi a woman in her ninth month.He leaned back, stretching his wooden leg out in front of him.Lost it at Daumier with Fergus nic Leodhas, he explained.Grape shot.Aches a wee bit toward the end of the day.He rubbed the flesh just above the leather cuff that attached the peg to his stump.Have you tried rubbing it with Balm of Gilead?I asked.Water pepper or stewed rue might help too.Ive not tried the water pepper, he answered, interested.Ill ask Jenny does she know how to make it.Oh, Id be glad to make it for you, I said, liking him.I looked toward the house again.If we stay long enough, I added doubtfully.We chatted inconsequentially for a little, both listening with one ear to the confrontation going on beyond the window, until Ian hitched forward, carefully settling his artificial limb under him before rising.I imagine we should go in now.If either of them stops shouting long enough to hear the other, theyll be hurting each others feelings.I hope thats all they hurt.Ian chuckled.Oh, I dinna think Jamie would strike her.Hes used to forbearance in the face of provocation.As for Jenny, she might slap his face, but thats all.She already did that.Weel, the guns are locked up, and all the knives are in the kitchen, except what Jamies wearing.And I dont suppose hell let her close enough to get his dirk away from him.Nay, theyre safe enough.He paused at the door.Now, as for you and me He winked solemnly.Thats a different matter.* * *    Inside, the maids started and flitted nervously away at Ians approach.The housekeeper, though, was still hovering by the drawing room door in fascination, drinking in the scene within, Jamies namesake cradled against her capacious bosom.Such was her concentration that when Ian spoke to her, she jumped as though he had run a hatpin into her, and put a hand to her palpitating heart.Ian nodded politely to her, took the little boy in his arms, and led the way into the drawing room.We paused just inside the door to survey the scene.Brother and sister had paused for breath, both still bristling and glaring like a pair of angry cats.Small Jamie, spotting his mother, struggled and kicked to get down from Ians arms, and once on the floor, made for her like a homing pigeon.Mama!he cried.Up!Jamie up!Turning, she scooped up the little boy and held him like a weapon against her shoulder.Can ye tell your uncle how old ye are, sweetheart?she asked him, throttling her voice down to a coounder which the sound of clashing steel was still all too apparent.The boy heard it; he turned and burrowed his face into his mothers neck.She patted his back mechanically, still glaring at her brother.Since hell not tell ye, I will.Hes two, come last August.And if youre bright enough to countwhich I take leave to doubtyoull see he was conceived six months past the time I last saw yon Randall, which was in our own dooryard, beating the living daylight out of my brother with a saber.Thats so, is it?Jamie glowered at his sister.Ive heard a bit differently.Its common knowledge youve taken the man to your bed; not the once, but as your lover.That childs his.He nodded contemptuously at his namesake, who had turned to peer under his mothers chin at this big, loud stranger.I believe ye when ye say the new bastard youre carrying is not; Randall was in France til this March.So youre not only a whore, but an unchoosy one too.Who fathered this last devils spawn on ye?The tall young man beside me coughed apologetically, breaking the tension in the room.I did, he said mildly.That one too.Advancing stiffly on his wooden leg, he took the little boy from his fuming wife and set him in the crook of his arm.Favors me a bit, some say.In fact, seen side by side, the faces of man and boy were nearly identical, allowing for the round cheeks of the one and the crooked nose of the other.The same high brow and narrow lips.The same feathery brows arched over the same deep, liquid brown eyes.Jamie, staring at the pair of them, looked rather as though hed been hit in the small of the back with a sandbag.He closed his mouth and swallowed once, clearly having no idea what to do next.Ian, he said, a little weakly.Youre married, then?Oh, aye, his brother in law said cheerfully.Wouldnt do, otherwise, would it?I see, Jamie murmured.He cleared his throat and bobbed his head at his newly discovered brother in law.Its, er, its kind of ye, Ian.To take her, I mean.Most kind.Feeling that he might be in need of some moral support at this point, I moved to Jamies side, and touched his arm.His sisters eyes lingered on me speculatively, but she said nothing.Jamie looked around and seemed startled to find me there, as though he had forgotten my existence.And no wonder if he had, I thought.But he seemed relieved by the interruption, at least, and put out a hand to draw me forward.My wife, he said, rather abruptly.He nodded toward Jenny and Ian.My sister, and, her, ah he trailed off, as Ian and I exchanged polite smiles.Jenny was not to be distracted by social niceties.What dye mean, its kind of him to take me?she demanded, ignoring the introductions.As if I didna ken!Ian looked inquiringly at her, and she waved a disdainful hand at Jamie.He means it was kind of ye to wed me in my soiled condition!She gave a snort that would have done credit to someone twice her size.Bletherer!Soiled condition?Ian looked startled, and Jamie suddenly leaned forward and grasped his sister hard about the upper arm.Did ye not tell him about Randall?He sounded truly shocked.Jenny, how could ye do such a thing?Only Ians hand on Jennys other arm restrained her from flying at her brothers throat.Ian drew her firmly behind him, and turning, set small Jamie in her arms, so that she was forced to grasp the child to save him falling.Then Ian put an arm about Jamies shoulders and tactfully steered him a safe distance away.Its hardly a matter for the drawing room, he said, low voiced and deprecating, but ye might be interested to know that your sister was virgin on her wedding night.I was, after all, in a position to say.Jennys wrath was now more or less evenly divided between brother and husband.How dare ye to say such things in my presence, Ian Murray!?she flamed.Or out of it, either!My wedding nights no ones business but mine and yourssure its not his!Next youll be showing him the sheets from my bridal bed!Weel, if I did now, it would shut him up, no?said Ian soothingly.Come now, mi dhu, ye shouldna worrit yourself, its bad for the babe.And the shouting troubles wee Jamie too.He reached out for his son, who was whimpering, not sure yet whether the situation required tears.Ian jerked his head at me and rolled an eye in Jamies direction.Taking my cue, I grabbed Jamie by the arm and dragged him to an armchair in a neutral corner.Ian had Jenny likewise installed on the loveseat, a firm arm across her shoulders to keep her in place.Now, then.In spite of his unassuming manner, Ian Murray had an undeniable authority.I had my hand on Jamies shoulder, and could feel the tension begin to go out of it.I thought that the room looked a bit like the ring of a boxing match, with the fighters twitching restlessly in the corners, each awaiting the signal for action under the soothing hand of a manager.Ian nodded at his brother in law, smiling.Jamie.Its good to see ye, man.Were pleased youre home, and your wife with ye.Are we not, mi dhu?he demanded of Jenny, his fingers tightening perceptibly on her shoulder.She was not one to be forced into anything.Her lips compressed into a thin tight line, as though forming a seal, then opened reluctantly to let one word escape.Depends, she said, and shut them tight again.Jamie rubbed a hand over his face, then raised his head, ready for a fresh round.I saw ye go into the house with Randall, he said stubbornly.And from things he said to me laterhow comes he to know youve a mole on your breast, then?She snorted violently.Do ye remember all that went on that day, or did the Captain beat it out of ye wi his saber?Of course I remember!Im no likely to forget it!Then perhaps youll remember that I gave the Captain a fair jolt in the crutch wi my knee at one point in the proceedings?Jamie hunched his shoulders, wary.Aye, I remember.Jenny smiled in a superior manner.Weel then, if your wife hereye could tell me her name at least, Jamie, I swear youve no manners at allanyway, if she was to give ye similar treatmentand richly you deserve it, I might adddye think youd be able to perform your husbandly duties a few minutes later?Jamie, who had been opening his mouth to speak, suddenly shut it.He stared at his sister for a long moment, then one corner of his mouth twitched slightly.Depends, he said.The mouth twitched again.He had been sitting hunched forward in his chair, but sat back now, looking at her with the half skeptical expression of a younger brother listening to a sisters fairy tales, feeling himself too old to be amazed, but half believing still against his will.Really?he said.Jenny turned to Ian.Go and fetch the sheets, Ian, she ordered.Jamie raised both hands in surrender.No.No, I believe ye.Its just, the way he acted after  Jenny sat back, relaxed in the curve of Ians arm, her son cuddling as close as the bulk of her belly would permit, gracious in victory.Weel, after all hed said outside, he could hardly admit in front of his own men to being incapable, now could he?Hed have to seem as though hed done as he promised, no?And, she admitted, Ill have to say the man was verra unpleasant about it all; he did strike me and tear my gown.In fact, he knocked me half senseless trying, and by the time Id come to myself and got decently covered again, the English had gone, taking you along with them.Jamie gave a long sigh and closed his eyes briefly.His broad hands rested on his knees, and I covered one of them with a gentle squeeze.He took my hand and opened his eyes, giving me a faint smile of acknowledgment before turning back to his sister.All right, he said.But I want to know, Jenny; did ye know when ye went with him that hed not harm you?She was silent for a moment, but her gaze was steady on her brothers face, and at last she shook her head, a slight smile on her lips.She put out a hand to stop Jamies protest, and the gull winged brows rose in a graceful arc of inquiry.And if your life is a suitable exchange for my honor, tell me why my honor is not a suitable exchange for your life?The brows drew together in a scowl, the twin of the one adorning her brothers face.Or are you telling me that I may not love you as much as you love me?Because if ye are, Jamie Fraser, Ill tell ye right now, its not true!Opening his mouth to reply before she was finished, Jamie was taken suddenly at a loss by this conclusion.He closed his mouth abruptly as his sister pressed her advantage.Because I do love ye, for all youre a thick headed, slack witted, lack brained gomerel.And Ill no have ye dead in the road at my feet just because youre too stubborn to keep your mouth shut for the once in your life!Blue eyes glared into blue eyes, shooting sparks in all directions.Swallowing the insults with difficulty, Jamie struggled for a rational reply.He seemed to be making up his mind to something.Finally he squared his shoulders, resigned to it.All right, then, Im sorry, he said.I was wrong, and Ill beg your pardon.He and his sister sat staring at each other for a long moment, but whatever pardon he was expecting from her was not forthcoming.She examined him closely, biting her lip, but said nothing.Finally he grew impatient.Ive said Im sorry!What more dye want of me?he demanded.Do ye want me to go on my knees to ye?Ill do it if I must, but tell me!She shook her head slowly, lip still caught between her teeth.No, she said at last, Ill not have ye on your knees in your own house.Stand up, though.Jamie stood, and she set the child down on the loveseat and crossed the room to stand in front of him.Take off your shirt, she ordered.Ill not!She jerked the shirttail out of his kilt and reached for the buttons.Short of forcible resistance, clearly he was going to obey or submit to being undressed.Retaining as much dignity as he could, he backed away from her, and tightlipped, removed the disputed garment.She circled behind him and surveyed his back, her face displaying the same carefully blank expression I had seen Jamie adopt when concealing some strong emotion.She nodded, as though confirming something long suspected.Weel, and if youve been a fool, Jamie, it seems youve paid for it.She laid her hand gently on his back, covering the worst of the scars.It looks as though it hurt.It did.Did you cry?His fists clenched involuntarily at his sides.Yes!Jenny walked back around to face him, pointed chin lifted and slanted eyes wide and bright.So did I, she said softly.Every day since they took ye away.The broad cheeked faces were once more mirrors of each other, but the expression that they wore was such that I rose and stepped quietly through the kitchen door to leave them alone.As the door swung to behind me, I saw Jamie catch hold of his sisters hands and say something huskily in Gaelic.She stepped into his embrace, and the rough bright head bent to the dark.27    THE LAST REASON    We ate like wolves at dinner, retired to a large, airy bedroom, and slept like logs.The sun would have been high by the time we rose in the morning, save that the sky was covered in clouds.I could tell it was late by the bustling feel of the house, as of people going cheerfully about their business, and by the tempting aromas that drifted up the stairs.After breakfast the men prepared to go out, visiting tenants, inspecting fences, mending wagons, and generally enjoying themselves.As they paused in the hall to don their coats, Ian spotted Jennys large basket resting on the table beneath the hall mirror.Shall I fetch home some apples from the orchard, Jenny?Twould save ye walking so far.Good idea, said Jamie, casting an appraising eye at his sisters expansive frontage.We dinna want her to drop it in the road.Ill drop you where ye stand, Jamie Fraser, she retorted, calmly holding up the coat for Ian to shrug into.Be useful for the once, and take this wee fiend outside wi ye.Mrs.Crooks in the washhouse; ye can leave him there.She moved her foot, dislodging small Jamie, who was clinging to her skirts, chanting up, up monotonously.His uncle obediently grabbed the wee fiend around the middle and swept him out the door, upside down and shrieking with delight.Ah, Jenny sighed contentedly, bending to inspect her appearance in the gold framed mirror.She wet a finger and smoothed her brows, then finished doing up the buttons at her throat.Nice to finish dressing wiout someone clinging to your skirts or wrapped round your knees.Some days I can scarce go to the privy alone, or speak a single sentence wiout being interrupted.Her cheeks were slightly flushed, and her dark hair gleamed against the blue silk of her dress.Ian smiled at her, warm brown eyes glowing at the blooming picture she presented.Weel, youll have time to talk wi Claire, perhaps, he suggested.He cocked one eyebrow in my direction.I expect shes mannerly enough to listen, but for Gods sake, dinna tell her any of your poems, or shell be on the next coach to London before Jamie and I get back.Jenny snapped her fingers under his nose, unperturbed by the teasing.Im none too worried, man.Theres no coach going before next April, and I reckon shell be used to us by that time.Get on wi ye; Jamies waiting.While the men went about their business, Jenny and I spent the day in the parlor, she stitching, I winding up stray bits of yarn and sorting the colored silks.Outwardly friendly, we circled each other cautiously in conversation, watching each other from the corners of our eyes.Jamies sister, Jamies wife; Jamie was the central point, unspoken, about which our thoughts revolved.Their shared childhood linked them forever, like the warp and the weft of a single fabric, but the patterns of their weave had been loosened, by absence and suspicion, then by marriage.Ians thread had been present in their weaving since the beginning, mine was a new one.How would the tensions pull in this new pattern, one thread against another?Our conversation ran on casual lines, but with the words unspoken clearly heard beneath.Youve run the house here alone since your mother died?Oh, aye.Since I was ten.I had the nurturing and the loving of him as a boy.What will you do with the man I helped make?Jamie says as youre a rare fine healer.I mended his shoulder for him when we first met.Yes, I am capable, and kind.I will care for him.I hear ye married very quickly.Did you wed my brother for his land and money?Yes, it was quick.I didnt even know Jamies true surname until just before the ceremony.I didnt know he was laird of this place; I can only have married him for himself.And so it went through the morning, a light luncheon, and into the hours of the afternoon, as we exchanged small talk, tidbits of information, opinions, small and hesitant jokes, taking each others measure.A woman who had run a large household since the age of ten, who had managed the estate since her fathers death and her brothers disappearance, was not a person to be lightly esteemed.I did wonder what she thought of me, but she seemed as capable as her brother of hiding her thoughts when she chose to.As the clock on the mantelpiece began to strike five, Jenny yawned and stretched, and the garment she had been mending slid down the rounded slope of her belly onto the floor.She began clumsily to reach for it, but I dropped to my knees beside her.No, Ill get it.Thank yeClaire.Her first use of my name was accompanied by a shy smile, and I returned it.Before we could return to our conversation, we were interrupted by the arrival of Mrs.Crook, the housekeeper, who poked a long nose into the parlor and inquired worriedly whether we had seen wee Master Jamie.Jenny laid aside her sewing with a sigh.Jenny laid aside her sewing with a sigh.Got away again, has he?Nay worry, Lizzie.Hes likely gone wi his Da or his uncle.Well go and see, shall we, Claire?I could use a breath of air before supper.She rose heavily to her feet and pressed her hands against the small of her back.She groaned and gave me a wry smile.Three weeks, about.I canna wait.We walked slowly through the grounds outside, Jenny pointing out the brewhouse and the chapel, explaining the history of the estate, and when the different bits had been built.As we approached the corner of the dovecote, we heard voices in the arbor.There he is, the wee rascal!Jenny exclaimed.Wait til I lay hands on him!Wait a minute.I laid a hand on her arm, recognizing the deeper voice that underlaid the little boys.Dinna worrit yourself, man, said Jamies voice.Youll learn.Its a bit difficult, isnt it, when your cock doesna stick out any further than your belly button?I stuck my head around the corner, to find him seated on a chopping block, engaged in converse with his namesake, who was struggling manfully with the folds of his smock.What are you doing with the child?I inquired cautiously.Im teachin young James here the fine art of not pissing on his feet, he explained.Seems the least his uncle could do for him.I raised one eyebrow.Talk is cheap.Seems the least his uncle could do is show him.He grinned.Well, weve had a few practical demonstrations.Had a wee accident last time, though.He exchanged accusatory looks with his nephew.Dinna look at me, he said to the boy.It was all your fault.I told ye to keep still.Ahem, said Jenny dryly, with a look at her brother and a matching one at her son.The smaller Jamie responded by pulling the front of his smock up over his head, but the larger one, unabashed, grinned cheerfully and rose from his seat, brushing dirt from his breeks.He set a hand on his nephews swathed head, and turned the little boy toward the house.To everything there is a season,  he quoted,  and a time for every purpose under heaven.First we work, wee James, and then we wash.And thenthank Godits time for supper.The most pressing matters of business attended to, Jamie took time the next afternoon to show me over the house.Built in 1702, it was indeed modern for its time, with such innovations as porcelain stoves for heating, and a great brick oven built into the kitchen wall, so that bread was no longer baked in the ashes of the hearth.The ground floor hallway, the stairwell, and the drawing room walls were lined with pictures.Here and there was a pastoral landscape, or an animal study, but most were of the family and their connections.I paused before a picture of Jenny as a young girl.She sat on the garden wall, a red leaved vine behind her.Lined up in front of her along the top of the wall was a row of birds; sparrows, a thrush, a lark, and even a pheasant, all jostling and sidling for position before their laughing mistress.It was quite unlike most of the formally posed pictures, in which one ancestor or another glared out of their frames as though their collars were choking them.My mother painted that, Jamie said, noting my interest.She did quite a few of the ones in the stairwell, but there are only two of hers in here.She always liked that one best herself.A large, blunt finger touched the surface of the canvas gently, tracing the line of the red leaved vine.Those were Jennys tame birds.Anytime there was a bird found wi a lame leg or a broken wing, whoever found it would bring it along, and in days shed have it healed, and eatin from her hand.That one always reminded me of Ian.The finger tapped above the pheasant, wings spread to keep its balance, gazing at its mistress with dark, adoring eyes.Youre awful, Jamie, I said, laughing.Is there one of you?Oh, aye.He led me to the opposite wall, near the window.Two red haired, tartan clad little boys stared solemnly out of the frame, seated with an enormous staghound.That must be Nairn, Brans grandfather, Jamie, and his older brother Willie, who had died of the smallpox at eleven.Jamie could not have been more than two when it was painted, I thought; he stood between his elder brothers knees, one hand resting on the dogs head.Jamie had told me about Willie during our journey from Leoch, one night by the fire at the bottom of a lonely glen.I remembered the small snake, carved of cherrywood, that he had drawn from his sporran to show me.Willie gave it me for my fifth birthday, he had said, finger gently stroking the sinuous curves.It was a comical little snake, body writhing artistically, and its head turned back to peer over what would have been its shoulder, if snakes had shoulders.Jamie handed me the little wooden object, and I turned it over curiously.Whats this scratched on the underside?S a w n y.  Sawny?Thats me, Jamie said, ducking his head as though mildly embarrassed.Its a pet name, like, a play on my second name, Alexander.Its what Willie used to call me.The faces in the picture were very much alike; all the Fraser children had that forthright look that dared you to take them at less than their own valuation of themselves.In this portrait, though, Jamies cheeks were rounded and his nose still snubbed with babyhood, while his brothers strong bones had begun to show the promise of the man within, a promise never kept.Were you very fond of him?I asked softly, laying a hand on his arm.He nodded, looking away into the flames on the hearth.Oh, aye, he said with a faint smile.He was five years older than I, and I thought he was God, or at least Christ.Used to follow him everywhere; or everywhere hed let me, at least.He turned away and wandered toward the bookshelves.Wanting to give him a moment alone, I stayed, looking out of the window.From this side of the house I could see dimly through the rain the outline of a rocky, grass topped hill in the distance.It reminded me of the fairies dun where I had stepped through a rock and emerged from a rabbit hole.Only six months.But it seemed like a very long time ago.Jamie had come to stand beside me at the window.Staring absently out at the driving rain, he said, There was another reason.The main one.Reason?I said stupidly.Why I married you.Which was?I dont know what I expected him to say, perhaps some further revelation of his familys contorted affairs.What he did say was more of a shock, in its way.Because I wanted you.He turned from the window to face me.More than I ever wanted anything in my life, he added softly.I continued staring at him, dumbstruck.Whatever I had been expecting, it wasnt this.Seeing my openmouthed expression, he continued lightly.When I asked my Da how ye knew which was the right woman, he told me when the time came, Id have no doubt.And I didnt.When I woke in the dark under that tree on the road to Leoch, with you sitting on my chest, cursing me for bleeding to death, I said to myself, Jamie Fraser, for all ye canna see what she looks like, and for all she weighs as much as a good draft horse, this is the woman.I started toward him, and he backed away, talking rapidly.I said to myself, Shes mended ye twice in as many hours, me lad; life amongst the MacKenzies being what it is, it might be as well to wed a woman as can stanch a wound and set broken bones.And I said to myself, Jamie, lad, if her touch feels so bonny on your collarbone, imagine what it might feel like lower down   He dodged around a chair.Of course, I thought it might ha just been the effects of spending four months in a monastery, without benefit of female companionship, but then that ride through the dark togetherhe paused to sigh theatrically, neatly evading my grab at his sleevewith that lovely broad arse wedged between my thighshe ducked a blow aimed at his left ear and sidestepped, getting a low table between usand that rock solid head thumping me in the chesta small metal ornament bounced off his own head and went clanging to the floorI said to myself  He was laughing so hard at this point that he had to gasp for breath between phrases.JamieI saidfor all shes a Sassenach bitchwith a tongue like an adderswith a bum like thatwhat does it matter if shes a f face like a sh sh sheep?I tripped him neatly and landed on his stomach with both knees as he hit the floor with a crash that shook the house.You mean to tell me that you married me out of love?I demanded.He raised his eyebrows, struggling to draw in breath.Have I notjust beensaying so?Grabbing me round the shoulders with one arm, he wormed the other hand under my skirt and proceeded to inflict a series of merciless pinches on that part of my anatomy he had just been praising.Returning to pick up her embroidery basket, Jenny sailed in at this point and stood eyeing her brother with some amusement.And what are you up to, young Jamie me lad?she inquired, one eyebrow up.Im makin love to my wife, he panted, breathless between giggling and fighting.Well, ye could find a more suitable place for it, she said, raising the other eyebrow.That floorll give ye splinters in your arse.* * *    If Lallybroch was a peaceful place, it was also a busy one.Everyone in it seemed to stir into immediate life at cockcrow, and the farm then spun and whirred like a complicated bit of clockwork until after sunset, when one by one the cogs and wheels that made it run began to fall away, rolling off into the dark to seek supper and bed, only to reappear like magic in their proper places in the morning.So essential did every last man, woman, and child seem to the running of the place that I could not imagine how it had fared these last few years, lacking its master.Now not only Jamies hands, but mine as well, were pressed into full employment.For the first time, I understood the stern Scotch strictures against idleness that had seemed like mere quaintness beforeor after, as the case might be.Idleness would have seemed not only a sign of moral decay, but an affront to the natural order of things.There were moments, of course.Those small spaces of time, too soon gone, when everything seems to stand still, and existence is balanced on a perfect point, like the moment of change between the dark and the light, when both and neither surround you.I was enjoying such a moment on the evening of the second or third day following our arrival at the farmhouse.Sitting on the fence behind the house, I could see tawny fields to the edge of the cliff past the broch, and the mesh of trees on the far side of the pass, dimming to black before the pearly glow of the sky.Objects near and far away seemed to be at the same distance, as their long shadows melted into the dusk.The air was chilly with a hint of the coming frost, and I thought I must go in soon, though I was reluctant to leave the still beauty of the place.I wasnt aware of Jamie approaching until he slid the heavy folds of a cloak around my shoulders.I hadnt realized quite how cold it was until I felt the contrasting warmth of the thick wool.Jamies arms came around me with the cloak, and I nestled back against him, shivering slightly.I could see ye shivering from the house, he said, taking my hands in his.Catch a chill, if youre not careful.And what about you?I twisted about to look at him.Despite the increasing bite of the air, he looked completely comfortable in nothing but shirt and kilt, with no more than a slight reddening of the nose to show it was not the balmiest of spring evenings.Ah, well, Im used to it.Scotsmen are none so thin blooded as ye bluenosed Southrons.He tilted my chin up and kissed my nose, smiling.I took him by the ears and adjusted his aim downward.It lasted long enough for our temperatures to have equalized by the time he released me, and the warm blood sang in my ears as I leaned back, balancing on the fence rail.The breeze blew from behind me, fluttering strands of hair across my face.He brushed them off my shoulders, spreading the ruffled locks out with his fingers, so the setting sun shone through the strands.You look like youve a halo, with the light behind ye that way, he said, softly.An angel crowned with gold.And you, I answered softly, tracing the edge of his jaw where the amber light sparked from his sprouting beard.Why didnt you tell me before?He knew what I meant.One eyebrow went up, and he smiled, half his face lit by the glowing sun, the other half in shadow.Well, I knew ye didna want to wed me.Id no wish to burden you or make myself foolish by telling you then, when it was plain youd lie with me only to honor vows youd rather not have made.He grinned, teeth white in the shadow, forestalling my protest.The first time, at least.Ive my pride, woman.I reached out and drew him to me, pulling him close, so that he stood between my legs as I sat on the fence.Feeling the faint chill of his skin, I wrapped my legs around his hips and enfolded him with the wings of my cloak.Under the sheltering fabric, his arms came tight around me, pressing my cheek against the smudged cambric of his shirt.My love, he whispered.Oh, my love.I do want ye so.Not the same thing, is it?I said.Loving and wanting, I mean.He laughed, a little huskily.Damn close, Sassenach, for me, at least.I could feel the strength of his wanting, hard and urgent.He stepped back suddenly, and stooping, lifted me from the fence.Where are we going?We were headed away from the house, toward the cluster of sheds in the shadow of the elm grove.To find a haystack.28    KISSES AND DRAWERS    I gradually found my own place in the running of the estate.As Jenny could no longer manage the long walk to the tenants cottages, I took to visiting them myself, accompanied sometimes by a stable lad, sometimes by Jamie or Ian.I took food and medicines with me, treated the sick as best I could, and made suggestions as to the improvement of health and hygiene, which were received with varying degrees of grace.At Lallybroch itself, I poked about the house and grounds, making myself useful wherever I could, mostly in the gardens.Besides the lovely little ornamental garden, the manor had a small herb garden and an immense kitchen garden or kailyard that supplied turnips, cabbages, and vegetable marrows.Jamie was everywhere; in the study with the account books, in the fields with the tenants, in the horse barn with Ian, making up for lost time.There was something more than duty or interest in it, too, I thought.We would have to leave soon; he wanted to set things running in a path that would continue while he was gone, until heuntil wecould return for good.I knew we would have to leave, yet surrounded by the peaceful house and grounds of Lallybroch and the cheerful company of Jenny, Ian, and small Jamie, I felt as though I had come home at last.After breakfast one morning, Jamie rose from the table, announcing that he thought he would go as far as the head of the valley, to see a horse that Martin Mack had for sale.Jenny turned from the sideboard, brows drawn together.Dye think it safe, Jamie?Theres been English patrols all through the district the last month or so.He shrugged, taking his coat from the chair where he had laid it.Ill be careful.Oh, Jamie, said Ian, coming in with an armful of firewood for the hearth.I meant to askcan ye gang up to the mill this morning?Jock was up yestereen to say somethings gone amiss wi the wheel.I had a quick look, but he and I together couldna shift it.I think theres a bit o rubbish stuck in the works outside, but its well under the water.He stamped his wooden leg lightly, smiling at me.I can still walk, thank God, and ride as well, but I canna swim.I just thrash about, and gang in circles like a doodle bug.Jamie laid the coat back on the chair with a smile at his brother in laws description.None so bad, Ian, if it keeps ye from havin to spend the morning in a freezing millpond.Aye, Ill go.He turned to me.Care to walk up wi me, Sassenach?Its a fine morning, and ye can bring your wee basket.He cocked an ironic eye at the enormous withy basket I used for gathering.Ill go and change my sark.Be wi ye in a moment.He headed for the staircase and bounded athletically up the steps, three at a time.Ian and I exchanged smiles.If there was any regret that such feats were now beyond him, it was hidden beneath his pleasure in seeing Jamies exuberance.Its good to have him back, he said.I only wish we could stay, I said, with regret.The soft brown eyes filled with alarm.Yell no be going at once, surely?I shook my head.No, not at once.But well need to leave well before the snow comes.Jamie had decided that our best course was to go to Beauly, seat of clan Fraser.Perhaps his grandfather, Lord Lovat, could be of help; if not, he might at least arrange us passage to France.Ian nodded, reassured.Oh, aye.But youve a few weeks yet.* * *    It was a beautiful bright autumn day, with air like cider and a sky so blue you could drown in it.We walked slowly so that I could keep an eye out for late blooming eglantine and teasel heads, chatting casually.Its Quarter Day next week, Jamie remarked.Will your new gown be ready then?I expect so.Why, is it an occasion?He smiled down at me, taking the basket while I stooped to pull up a stalk of tansy.Oh, in a way.Nothing like Colums great affairs, to be sure, but all the Lallybroch tenants will come to pay their rentsand their respects to the new Lady Lallybroch.I expect theyll be surprised youve married an Englishwoman.I reckon there are a few fathers might be disappointed at that; Id courted a lass or two hereabouts before I got arrested and taken to Fort William.Sorry you didnt wed a local girl?I asked coquettishly.If ye think Im going to say yes, and you standin there holding a pruning knife, he remarked, youve less opinion of my good sense than I thought.I dropped the pruning knife, which Id taken to dig with, stretched my arms out, and stood waiting.When he released me at last, I stooped to pick up the knife again, saying teasingly, I always wondered how it was you stayed a virgin so long.Are the girls in Lallybroch all plain, then?No, he said, squinting up into the morning sun.It was mostly my father was responsible for that.Wed stroll over the fields in the evenings, sometimes, he and I, and talk about things.And once I got old enough for such a thing to be a possibility, he told me that a man must be responsible for any seed he sows, for its his duty to take care of a woman and protect her.And if I wasna prepared to do that, then Id no right to burden a woman with the consequences of my own actions.He glanced behind us, toward the house.And toward the small family graveyard, near the foot of the broch, where his parents were buried.He said the greatest thing in a mans life is to lie wi a woman he loves, he said softly.He smiled at me, eyes blue as the sky overhead.He was right.I touched his face lightly, tracing the broad sweep downward from cheek to jaw.Rather hard on you, though, if he expected you to wait so long to marry, I said.Jamie grinned, kilt flapping round his knees in the brisk autumn breeze.Well, the Church does teach that self abuse is a sin, but my father said he thought that if it came to a choice between abusin yourself or some poor woman, a decent man might choose to make the sacrifice.When I stopped laughing, I shook my head and said, No.No, I wont ask.You did stay a virgin, though.Strictly by the grace of God and my father, Sassenach.I dinna think I thought much about anything but the lasses, once I turned fourteen or so.But that was when I was sent to foster wi Dougal at Beannachd.No girls there?I asked.I thought Dougal had daughters.Aye, he has.Four.The two younger are no much to look at, but the eldest was a verra handsome lassie.A year or two older than me, Molly was.And not much flattered by my attention, I dinna think.I used to stare at her across the supper table, and shed look down her nose at me and ask did I have the catarrh?Because if so, I should go to bed, and if not, she would be much obliged if Id close my mouth, as she didna care to look at my tonsils while she was eating.I begin to see how you stayed a virgin, I said, hiking my skirts to climb a stile.But they cant all have been like that.No, he said reflectively, giving me a hand over the stile.No, they werent.Mollys younger sister, Tabitha, was a bit friendlier.He smiled reminiscently.Tibby was the first girl I kissed.Or perhaps I should say the first girl who kissed me.I was carrying two pails of milk for her, from the barn to the dairy, plotting all the way how Id get her behind the door, where there wasna room to get away, and kiss her there.But my hands were full, and she had to open the door for me to go through.So it was me ended up behind the door, and Tib who walked up to me, took me by both ears and kissed me.Spilled the milk, too, he added.Sounds a memorable first experience, I said, laughing.I doubt I was her first, he said, grinning.She knew a lot more about it than I did.But we didna get much practice; a day or two later, her mother caught us in the pantry.She didna do more than give me a sharpish look and tell Tibby to go and set the table for dinner, but she must have told Dougal about it.If Dougal MacKenzie had been quick to resent an insult to his sisters honor, I could only imagine what he might have done in defense of his daughters.I shudder to think, I said, grinning.So do I, said Jamie, shuddering.He shot me a sidelong glance, looking shy.Youll know that young men in the morning, sometimes they wake up withwell, with He was blushing.Yes, I know, I said.So do old men of twenty three.You think I dont notice?Youve brought it to my attention often enough.Mmmphm.Well, the morning after Tibs mother caught us, I woke up just at dawn.Id been dreaming about herTib, I mean, not her motherand I wasna surprised to feel a hand on my cock.What was surprising was that it wasnt mine.Surely it wasnt Tibbys?Well, no, it wasna.It was her fathers.Dougal?!Whatever?Well, I opened my eyes wide and he smiled down at me, verra pleasant.And then he sat on the bed and we had a nice little chat, uncle and nephew, foster father to foster son.He said how much he was enjoying my being there, him not having a son of his own, and all that.And how his family was all so fond of me, and all.And how he would hate to think that there might be any advantage taken of such fine, innocent feelings as his daughters might have toward me, but how of course he was so pleased that he could trust me as he would his own son.And all the time he was talking and me lying there, he had his one hand on his dirk, and the other resting on my fine young balls.So I said yes, Uncle, and no, Uncle, and when he left, I rolled myself up in the quilt and dreamed about pigs.And I didna kiss a girl again until I was sixteen, and went to Leoch.He looked over at me, smiling.His hair was laced back with a leather thong, but the shorter ends were sticking up at the crown as usual, glimmering red and gold in the brisk, clear air.His skin had darkened to a golden bronze during our journey from Leoch and Craigh na Dun, and he looked like an autumn leaf, swirling joyfully wind borne.And what of you, my bonny Sassenach?he asked, grinning.Did ye have the wee laddies panting at your heels, or were ye shy and maidenly?A bit less than you, I said circumspectly.I was eight.Jezebel.Who was the lucky lad?The dragomans son.That was in Egypt.He was nine.Och, well, youre no to blame then.Led astray by an older man.And a bloody heathen, no less.The mill came into sight below, picture pretty, with a deep red vine glowing up the side of the yellow plaster wall, and shutters standing open to the daylight, tidy in spite of the worn green paint.The water gushed happily down the sluice under the idle water wheel into the millpond.There were even ducks on the pond, teal and goldeneye paused for a rest on their southern flight.Look, I said, pausing at the top of the hill, putting a hand on Jamies arm to stop him.Isnt it lovely?Be a sight more lovely if the water wheel were turnin, he said practically.Then he glanced down at me and smiled.Aye, Sassenach.Its a bonny place.I used to swim here when I was a ladtheres a wide pool round the bend of the stream.A little further down the hill, the pool became visible through the screen of willows.So did the boys.There were four of them, sporting and splashing and yelling, all naked as jays.Brrr, I said, watching them.The weather was fine for autumn, but there was enough of a nip in the air to make me glad of the shawl Id brought.It makes my blood run cold, just to see them.Och?Jamie said.Well, let me warm it for ye then.With a glance down at the boys in the stream, he stepped back into the shade of a big horse chestnut tree.He put his hands about my waist and drew me into the shadow after him.Ye werena the first lass I kissed, he said softly.But I swear youll be the last.And he bent his head to my upturned face.* * *    Once the miller had emerged from his lair, and hasty introductions were made, I retired to the bank of the millpond, while Jamie spent several minutes listening to an explanation of the problem.As the miller went back into the millhouse, to try turning the stone from within, Jamie stood a moment, staring into the dark, weedy depths of the millpond.Finally, with a shrug of resignation, he began to strip off his clothes.No help for it, he remarked to me.Ians right; theres something stuck in the wheel under the sluice.Ill have to go down and Stopped by my gasp, he turned around to where I sat on the bank with my basket.And whats amiss wi you?he demanded.Have ye no seen a man in his drawers before?Notnot likethat!I managed to get out, between sputters.Anticipating possible submergence, he had donned beneath his kilt a short garment of incredible elderliness, originally of red flannel, now patched with a dazzling array of colors and textures.Obviously, this pair of drawers had originally belonged to someone who measured several inches more around the middle than Jamie.They hung precariously from his hipbones, the folds drooping in Vs over his flat belly.Your grandfathers?I guessed, making a highly unsuccessful effort to suppress my giggling.Or your grandmothers?My fathers, he said coldly, looking down his nose at me.Ye dinna expect me to be swimming bare as an egg before my wife and my tenants, do ye?With considerable dignity, he gathered the excess material up in one hand and waded into the millpond.Treading water near the wheel, he took his bearings, then with a deep breath, upended and submerged, my last sight of him the ballooning bottom of the red flannel drawers.The miller, leaning out of the millhouse window, shouted encouragement and directions whenever the sleek wet head broke the surface for air.The edge of the pond bank was thick with water plants, and I foraged with my digging stick for mallow root and the small, fine leaved dropwort.I had half the basket filled when I heard a polite cough behind me.She was a very old lady indeed, or at least she looked it.She leaned on a hawthorn stick, enveloped in garments she must have worn twenty years before, now much too voluminous for the shrunken frame inside them.Good morn to ye, she said, nodding a head like a bobbin.She wore a starched white kertch that hid most of her hair, but a few wisps of iron grey peeped out beside cheeks like withered apples.Good morning, I said, and started to scramble up, but she advanced a few steps and sank down beside me with surprising grace.I hoped she could get up again.Im I started, but had barely opened my mouth when she interrupted.Yell be the new lady, o course.Im Mrs.MacNabGrannie MacNab, they call me, along o my daughters in law all bein Mrs.MacNabs as weel.She reached out a skinny hand and pulled my basket toward her, peering into it.Mallow rootah, thats good for cough.But ye dinna want to use that one, lassie.She poked at a small brownish tuber.Looks like lily root, but it isna that.What is it?I asked.Adders tongue.Eat that one, lassie, and yell be rollin round the room wi your heels behind yer head.She plucked the tuber from the basket and threw it into the pond with a splash.She pulled the basket onto her lap and pawed expertly through the remaining plants, while I watched with a mixture of amusement and irritation.At last, satisfied, she handed it back.Weel, youre none sae foolish, for a Sassenach lassie, she remarked.Ye ken betony from lambs quarters, at least.She cast a glance toward the pond, where Jamies head appeared briefly, sleek as a seal, before disappearing once again beneath the millhouse.I see his lairdship didna wed ye for your face alone.Thank you, I said, choosing to construe this as a compliment.The old ladys eyes, sharp as needles, were fastened on my midsection.Not wi child yet?she demanded.Raspberry leaves, thats the thing.Steep a handful wi rosehips and drink it when the moons waxing, from the quarter to the full.Then when it wanes from the full to the half, take a bit o barberry to purge your womb.Oh, I said, well  Id a bit of a favor to ask his lairdship, the old lady went on.But as I see hes a bit occupied at present, Ill tell you about it.All right, I agreed weakly, not seeing how I could stop her anyway.Its my grandson, she said, fixing me with small grey eyes the size and shininess of marbles.My grandson Rabbie, that is; Ive sixteen altogether, and the three o them named Robert, but the ones Bob and tother Rob, and the wee ones Rabbie.Congratulations, I said politely.I want his lairdship to take the lad on as stable lad, she went on.Well, I cant say  Its his father, ye ken, she said, leaning forward confidentially.Not as Ill say theres aught wrong wi a bit o firmness; spare the rod and spoil the child, Ive said often enough, and the good Lord kens weel enough that boys were meant to be smacked, or hed not ha filled em sae full o the deil.But when it comes to layin a child out on the hearth, and a bruise on his face the size o my hand, and for naught more than takin an extra bannock from the platter, then  Rabbies father beats him, you mean?I interrupted.The old lady nodded, pleased with my ready intelligence.To be sure.Is that no what Ive been sayin?She held up a hand.Now, in the regular way, o course Id not interfere.A mans sons his ain to do as he sees fit wi, butweel, Rabbies a bit of a favorite o mine.And its no the lads fault as his fathers a drunken sot, shameful as tis for his own mither to say such a thing.She raised an admonitory finger like a stick.Not but what Ronalds father didna take a drop too much from time to time.But lay a hand on me or the bairns he never didnot after the first time, at any rate, she added thoughtfully.She twinkled suddenly at me, little cheeks round and firm as summer apples, so I could see what a very lively and attractive girl she must have been.He struck me the once, she confided, and I snatched the girdle off the fire and crowned him wi it.She rocked back and forth, laughing.Thought Id kilt him for sure, and me wailin and holdin of his heid in my lap, thinkin what would I do, a widow wi twa bairns to feed?But he came round, she said matter of factly, and neer laid a hand on me or the bairnies again.I bore thirteen, ye ken, she said proudly.And raised ten.Congratulations, I said, meaning it.Raspberry leaves, she said, laying a confiding hand on my knee.Mark me, lassie, raspberry leaves will do it.And if not, come to see me, and Ill make ye a bittie drink o coneflower and marrow seed, wi a raw egg beaten up in it.Thatll draw yer mans seed straight up into the womb, ye ken, and youll be swellin like a pumpkin by Easter.I coughed, growing a bit red in the face.Mmmphm.And you want Jamie, er, his lairdship I mean, to take your grandson into his house as stable lad, to get him away from his father?Aye, thats it.Now hes a brankie wee worker, is Rabbie, and his lairdship will no be  The old ladys face froze in the midst of her animated conversation.I turned to look over my shoulder, and froze as well.Redcoats.Dragoons, six of them, on horseback, making their way carefully down the hill toward the millhouse.With admirable presence of mind, Mrs.MacNab stood up and sat down again on top of Jamies discarded clothes, her spreading skirts hiding everything.There was a splash and an explosive gasp from the millpond behind me as Jamie surfaced again.I was afraid to call out or move, for fear of attracting the dragoons attention to the pond, but the sudden dead silence behind me told me he had seen them.The silence was broken by a single word traveling across the water, softly spoken, but heartfelt in its sincerity.Merde, he said.The old lady and I sat unmoving, stone faced, watching the soldiers come down the hill.At the last moment, as they made the final turn around the mill house path, she turned swiftly to me and laid a stick straight finger across her withered lips.I mustnt speak and let them hear that I was English.I didnt have time even to nod in acknowledgment before the mud caked hooves came to a halt a few feet away.Good morrow to you, ladies, said the leader.He was a corporal, but not, I was pleased to see, Corporal Hawkins.A quick glance showed me that none of the men were among those I had seen at Fort William, and I relaxed my grip on the handle of my basket just a fraction.We saw the mill from above, the dragoon said, and thought perhaps to purchase a sack of meal?He divided a bow between us, not sure who to address.Mrs.MacNab was frosty, but polite.Good morrow, she said, inclining her head.But if yeve come for meal, I fear me yell be sair disappointit.The mill wheels nae workin just now.Perhaps next time ye come this way.Oh?Whats amiss, then?The corporal, a short young man with a fresh complexion, seemed interested.He walked down to the edge of the pond to peer at the wheel.The miller, popping up in the mill to report the latest progress with the millstone, saw him and hastily popped back down out of sight.The corporal called to one of his men.Climbing up the slope, he gestured to the other soldier, who obligingly stooped to let the corporal climb on his back.Reaching up, he managed to catch the edge of the roof with both hands, and squirmed up onto the thatch.Standing, he could barely reach the edge of the great wheel.He reached out and rocked it with both hands.Bending down, he shouted through the window to the miller to try turning the millstone by hand.I willed myself to keep my eyes away from the bottom of the sluice.I wasnt sufficiently familiar with the workings of waterwheels to know for sure, but I was afraid that if the wheel gave way suddenly, anything near the underwater works might be crushed.Apparently this was no idle fear, for Mrs.MacNab spoke sharply to one of the soldiers near us.Ye should ca your master doon now, laddie.Hell do no good tae the mill or himsel.Ye shouldna meddle wi things as ye dinna understand.Oh, youve no cause for worry, missus, said the soldier casually.Corporal Silverss father has a wheat mill in Hampshire.What the Corporal doesnt know about waterwheels would fit in me shoe.Mrs.MacNab and I exchanged looks of alarm.The corporal, after a bit more clambering up and down and exploratory rockings and pokings, came down to where we sat.He was perspiring freely, and wiped his red face with a large, grubby handkerchief before addressing us.I cant move it from above, and that fool of a miller doesnt seem to speak any English at all.He glanced at Mrs.MacNabs sturdy stick and gnarled limbs, then at me.Perhaps the young lady could come and talk to him for me?Mrs.MacNab stretched out a protective hand, gripping me by the sleeve.Yell hae to pardon my daughter in law, sorr.Shes gone sair saft in the heid, ever syne her last babe was stillborn.Hasna spoke a word in ower a year, puir lassie.And I canna leave her for a minute, for fear shell throw hersel intae the water in her grief.I did my best to look soft headed, no great effort in my present state of mind.The corporal looked disconcerted.Oh, he said.Well He wandered down to the edge of the pond and stood frowning into the water.He looked just as Jamie had an hour before, and apparently for the same reason.No help for it, Collins, he said to the old trooper.Ill have to go under and see whats holding it.He took off his scarlet coat and began to unfasten the cuffs of his shirt.I exchanged looks of horror with Mrs.MacNab.While there might be sufficient air under the millhouse for survival, certainly there was not room to hide very effectively.I was considering, not very optimistically, the chances of throwing a convincing epileptic fit, when the great wheel suddenly creaked overhead.With a sound like a tree being murdered, the big arc made a swooping half turn, stuck for a moment, then rolled into a steady revolution, scoops merrily pouring bright streamlets into the sluice.The corporal paused in his undressing, admiring the arc of the wheel.Look at that, Collins!Wonder what was stuck in it?As though in answer, something came into sight at the top of the wheel.It hung from one of the scoops, sodden red folds dripping.The scoop hit the stream now churning down the sluice, the object came loose, and Jamies fathers erstwhile drawers floated majestically out onto the waters of the millpond.The elderly trooper fished them out with a stick, presenting them gingerly to his commander, who plucked them off the stick like a man obliged to pick up a dead fish.Hm, he said, holding up the garment critically.Wonder where on earth that came from?Must have been caught around the shaft.Curious that something like that could cause so much trouble, isnt it, Collins?Yessir.The trooper plainly did not consider the interior workings of a Scottish mill wheel to be of absorbing interest, but answered politely.After turning the cloth over a time or two, the corporal shrugged, and used it to wipe the dirt from his hands.Decent bit of flannel, he said, wringing out the sopping cloth.Itll do to polish tack, at least.Something of a souvenir, eh, Collins?And with a polite bow to Mrs.MacNab and me, he turned to his horse.The dragoons had barely disappeared from sight over the brow of the hill when a splashing from the millpond heralded the rising from the depths of the resident water sprite.He was the bloodless white, blue tinged, of Carrara marble, and his teeth chattered so hard that I could barely make out his first words, which were, in any case, in Gaelic.Mrs.MacNab had no trouble making them out, and her ancient jaw dropped.She snapped it shut, though, and made a low reverence toward the emergent laird.Seeing her, he stopped his progress toward the shore, the water still lapping modestly about his hips.He took a deep breath, clenching his teeth to stop the chattering, and plucked a streamer of duckweed off his shoulder.Mrs.MacNab, he said, bowing to his elderly tenant.Sir, she said, bowing back once again.A fine day, is it no?A bit b brisk, he said, casting an eye at me.I shrugged helplessly.Were pleased to see ye back in yer home, sir, and its our hope, the lads and mysel, as youll soon be back to stay.Mine too, Mrs.MacNab, Jamie said courteously.He jerked his head at me, glaring.I smiled blandly.The old lady, ignoring this byplay, folded her gnarled hands in her lap and settled back with dignity.Ive a wee favor I was wishin to ask of your lairdship, she began, havin tae do wi  Grannie MacNab, Jamie interrupted, advancing a menacing half step through the water, whatever your wish is, Ill do it.Provided only that yell give me back my shirt before my parts fall off wi cold.29    MORE HONESTY    In the evenings, when supper was cleared away, we generally sat in the drawing room with Jenny and Ian, talking companionably of this and that, or listening to Jennys stories.Tonight, though, it was my turn, and I held Jenny and Ian rapt as I told them about Mrs.MacNab and the Redcoats.God kens well enough that boys need to be smacked, or hed no fill them sae full o the deil.My imitation of Grannie MacNab brought down the house.Jenny wiped tears of laughter from her eyes.Lord, its true enough.And shed know it too.What has she got, Ian, eight boys?Ian nodded.Aye, at least.I canna even remember all their names; seemed like there was always a couple of MacNabs about to hunt or fish or swim with, when Jamie and I were younger.You grew up together?I asked.Jamie and Ian exchanged wide, complicitous grins.Oh, aye, were familiar, Jamie said, laughing.Ians father was the factor for Lallybroch, like Ian is now.On a number of occasions during my reckless youth, Ive found myself standing elbow to elbow with Mr.Murray there, explaining to one or other of our respective fathers how appearances can be deceiving, or failing that, why circumstances alter cases.And failin that, said Ian, Ive found myself on the same number of occasions, bent over a fence rail alongside Mr.Fraser there, listenin to him yell his heid off while waitin for my own turn.Never!replied Jamie indignantly.I never yelled.Ye call it what ye like, Jamie, his friend answered, but ye were awful loud.Ye could hear the both of ye for miles, Jenny interjected.And not only the yelling.Ye could hear Jamie arguing all the time, right up to the fence.Aye, ye should ha been a lawyer, Jamie.But I dinna ken why I always let you do the talking, said Ian, shaking his head.You always got us in worse trouble than we started.Jamie began to laugh again.You mean the broch?I do.Ian turned to me, motioning toward the west, where the ancient stone tower rose from the hill behind the house.One of Jamies better arguments, that was, he said, rolling his eyes upward.He told Brian it was uncivilized to use physical force in order to make your point of view prevail.Corporal punishment was barbarous, he said, and old fashioned, to boot.Thrashing someone just because they had committed an act with whose ram ramifications, that was itwith whose ramifications ye didnt agree was not at a a constructive form of punishment.All of us were laughing by this time.Did Brian listen to all of this?I asked.Oh, aye.Ian nodded.I just stood there wi Jamie, nodding whenever hed stop for breath.When Jamie finally ran out of words, his father sort of coughed a bit and said I see.Then he turned and looked out of the window for a little, swinging the strap and nodding his head, as though he were thinking.We were standing there, elbow to elbow like Jamie said, sweating.At last Brian turned about and told us to follow him to the stables.He gave us each a broom, a brush, and a bucket, and pointed us in the direction of the broch, said Jamie, taking up the story.Said Id convinced him of my point, so hed decided on a more constructive form of punishment.Ians eyes rolled slowly up, as though following the rough stones of the broch upward.That tower rises sixty feet from the ground, he told me, and its thirty feet in diameter, wi three floors.He heaved a sigh.We swept it from the top to the bottom, he said, and scrubbed it from the bottom to the top.It took five days, and I can taste rotted oat straw when I cough, even now.And you tried to kill me on the third day, said Jamie, for getting us into that.He touched his head gingerly.I had a wicked gash over my ear, where ye hit me wi the broom.Oh, weel, Ian said comfortably, that was when ye broke my nose the second time, so we were even.Trust a Murray to keep score, Jamie said, shaking his head.Lets see, I said, counting on my fingers.According to you, Frasers are stubborn, Campbells are sneaky, MacKenzies are charming but sly, and Grahams are stupid.Whats the Murrays distinguishing characteristic?Ye can count on them in a fight, said Jamie and Ian together, then laughed.Ye can too, said Jamie, recovering.You just hope theyre on your side.And both men went off into fits again.Jenny shook her head disapprovingly at spouse and brother.And we havena even had any wine yet, she said.She put down her sewing and heaved herself to her feet.Come wi me, Claire; well see has Mrs.Crook made any biscuits to have wi the port.* * *    Coming back down the hall a quarter of an hour later with trays of refreshments, I heard Ian say, Youll not mind then, Jamie?Mind what?That we wed without your consentme and Jenny, I mean.Jenny, walking ahead of me, came to a sudden stop outside the drawing room door.There was a brief snort from the love seat where Jamie lay sprawled, feet propped on a hassock.Since I didna tell ye where I was, and ye had no notion whenif everId come back, I can hardly blame ye for not waiting.I could see Ian in profile, leaning over the log basket.His long, good natured face wore a slight frown.Weel, I didna think it right, especially wi me being crippled  There was a louder snort.Jenny couldna have a better husband, if youd lost both legs and your arms as well, Jamie said gruffly.Ians pale skin flushed slightly in embarrassment.Jamie coughed and swung his legs down from the hassock, leaning over to pick up a scrap of kindling that had fallen from the basket.How did ye come to wed anyway, given your scruples?he asked, one side of his mouth curling up.Gracious, man, Ian protested, ye think I had any choice in the matter?Up against a Fraser?He shook his head, grinning at his friend.She came up to me out in the field one day, while I was tryin to mend a wagon that sprang its wheel.I crawled out, all covered wi muck, and found her standin there looking like a bush covered wi butterflies.She looks me up and down and she says He paused and scratched his head.Weel, I dont know exactly what she said, but it ended with her kissing me, muck notwithstanding, and saying, Fine, then, well be married on St.Martins Day.He spread his hands in comic resignation.I was still explaining why we couldna do any such thing, when I found myself in front of a priest, saying, I take thee, Janetand swearing to a lot of verra improbable statements.Jamie rocked back in his seat, laughing.Aye, I ken the feeling, he said.Makes ye feel a bit hollow, no?Ian smiled, embarrassment forgotten.It does and all.I still get that feeling, ye know, when I see Jenny sudden, standing against the sun on the hill, or holding wee Jamie, not lookin at me.I see her, and I think, God, man, she cant be yours, not really.He shook his head, brown hair flopping over his brow.And then she turns and smiles at me He looked up at his brother in law, grinning.Weel, ye know yourself.I can see its the same wi you and your Claire.Shessomething special, no?Jamie nodded.The smile didnt leave his face, but altered somehow.Aye, he said softly.Aye, she is that.* * *    Over the port and biscuits, Jamie and Ian reminisced further about their shared boyhood, and their fathers.Ians father, William, had died just the past spring, leaving Ian to run the estate alone.You remember when your father came on us down by the spring, and made us go wi him to the smithy to see how to fix a wagon tree?Aye, and he couldna understand why we kept squirming and shifting about  And he kept asking ye did ye need to go to the privy  Both men were laughing too hard to finish the story, so I looked at Jenny.Toads, she said succinctly.The two o them each had five or six toads inside his shirt.Oh, Lord, said Ian.When the one crawled up your neck and hopped out of your shirt into the forge, I thought Id die.I cannot imagine why my father didna wring my neck on several occasions, said Jamie, shaking his head.Its a wonder I ever grew up.Ian looked consideringly at his own offspring, industriously engaged in piling wooden blocks on top of each other by the hearth.I dont quite know how Im goin to manage it, when the time comes I have to beat my own son.I meanhes, well, hes so small.He gestured helplessly at the sturdy little figure, tender neck bent to his task.Jamie eyed his small namesake cynically.Aye, hell be as much a devil as you or I, give him time.After all, I suppose even I must ha looked small and innocent at one point.You did, said Jenny unexpectedly, coming to set a pewter cup of cider in her husbands hand.She patted her brother on the head.You were verra sweet as a baby, Jamie.I remember standing over your cot.Ye canna ha been more than two, asleep wi your thumb in your mouth, and we agreed wed never seen a prettier lad.You had fat round cheeks and the dearest red curls.The pretty lad turned an interesting shade of rose, and drained his cider at one gulp, avoiding my glance.Didna last long, though, Jenny said, flashing white teeth in a mildly malicious smile at her brother.How old were ye when ye got your first thrashing, Jamie?Seven?No, eight, Jamie said, thrusting a new log into the smoldering pile of kindling.Christ, that hurt.Twelve strokes full across the bum, and he didna let up a bit, beginning to end.He never did.He sat back on his heels, rubbing his nose with the knuckles of one hand.His cheeks were flushed and his eyes bright from the exertion.Once it was over, Father went off a bit and sat down on a rock while I settled myself.Then when Id quit howling and got down to a sort of wet snuffle, he called me over to him.Now that I think of it, I can remember just what he said.Maybe you can use it on young Jamie, Ian, when the time comes.Jamie closed his eyes, recalling.He stood me between his knees and made me look him in the face, and said, Thats the first time, Jamie.Ill have to do it again, maybe a hundred times, before youre grown to a man.He laughed a bit then and said, My father did it to me at least that often, and youre as stubborn and cockle headed as ever I was.He said, Sometimes I daresay Ill enjoy thrashing you, depending on what youve done to deserve it.Mostly I wont.But Ill do it nonetheless.So remember it, lad.If your head thinks up mischief, your backsides going to pay for it.Then he gave me a hug and said, Youre a braw lad, Jamie.Go away to the house now and let your mother comfort ye.I opened my mouth to say something to that, and he said, quick like, No, I know you dont need it, but she does.Get on wi ye.So I came down and Mother fed me bread with jam on it.Jenny suddenly started to laugh.I just remembered, she said, Da used to tell that story about you, Jamie, about thrashing you, and what he said to you.He said when he sent ye back to the house after, you came halfway down, then all of a sudden stopped and waited for him.When he came down to ye, you looked up at him and said, I just wanted to ask, Faitherdid ye enjoy it this time?And when he said no, you nodded and said, Good.I didna like it much either.We all laughed for a minute together, then Jenny looked up at her brother, shaking her head.He loved to tell that story.Da always said youd be the death of him, Jamie.The merriment died out of Jamies face, and he looked down at the big hands resting on his knees.Aye, he said quietly.Well, and I was, then, wasnt I?Jenny and Ian exchanged glances of dismay, and I looked down at my own lap, not knowing what to say.There was no sound for a moment but the crackling of the fire.Then Jenny, with a quick look at Ian, set down her glass and touched her brother on the knee.Jamie, she said.It wasna your fault.He looked up at her and smiled, a little bleakly.No?Who elses, then?She took a deep breath and said, Mine.What?He stared at her in blank astonishment.She had gone a little paler even than usual, but remained composed.I said it was my fault, as much as anyones.Forfor what happened to you, Jamie.And Father.He covered her hand with his own and rubbed it gently.Dinna talk daft, lass, he said.
