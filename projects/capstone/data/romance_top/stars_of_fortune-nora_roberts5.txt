Sawyer tapped his finger on the map.It stops right here, on Corfu.So, I followed the map.Its done that before?Sasha asked.Oh, yeah, plenty.Nobodys found any of the stars, but for me?Its always taken me somewhere I pick up something fresh on them, or confirm something, or just get an experience.This time?See how its shining?Its beautiful, Annika murmured.Yeah, but that shining?Thats new.It would glow some, but not like this.I had to figure coming here was pretty damn important.Turns out it was.I was hitching my way here, and yall came along.That made four of the six.That night, I went for a walk on the beach, and found Annika.He shifted to her.Your turn.I was sent to help.To be one of you.She bowed her head.I cant explain.I dont have a magick compass, or the powers like Sasha and Bran.I dont have such a smart mind like Riley, but I can help.I dont like fighting, but I will fight with you.Dont send me away.Hey.Sawyer put an arm around her shoulders.Nobodys sending you anywhere.I came to you.She turned into him.You found me.Thats right.We can leave it at that for now.He looked over at Bran as if daring him to disagree.Youre one of us, Annika, and thats more than enough.Not all stories need telling at once.How about you, McCleary?Riley sat back, studied him.Whats your story?A family thing, and the duty that comes with it.And here?An urge I couldnt shake led me to Corfu, then to the cave.Its the closest Ive come.Its the closest Ive ever come.Where are you from?What do you do?Nowhere in particular, and whatever needs doing.You havent had much time together, but more than a couple hours, so thats all Im going to tell you until I decide to tell you more.You dont trust us.Why should he?Sasha glanced at Riley.Its true we havent had much time, but its been intense, even intimate.And today, in the cave, it was life and death.Both you and Sawyer brought guns, but you didnt tell the rest of us.Sawyer shifted.Shit.Combat knife, too.Riley pulled a wicked blade out of her boot.Throwing knife.Which only proves weve yet to reach the point where were fully honest.We know about Bran only because he ...used what he has to get us all out of the cave alive.And we know about the compass because Sawyer felt guilty not telling us after we found out about Bran.Annikas not ready, and Doyle?Youre still annoyed we got in your way.Youre right on that.Youre not, because we didnt get in your way, and you know that, under the annoyance.We were all where we were supposed to be today.We all made the choice to go into the cave.What?Wait.Rileys gilded eyes narrowed.Do you think it was a kind of test?I dont know.Im really new at this.But I think gods are pretty demanding.We all went into the cave.We fought.Well, all of you did.Sasha.Bran reached for her hand, but she drew it away.I didnt fight.I froze.But it wont happen again.Still, we got out, and wesix noware sitting right here.I havent heard anyone say they want out.We faced down a god, and not one of us is walking away from doing it again.So I think we passed the test.Smart brain there, too, Riley said to Annika.Youve got a point.Throughout lore and legend, gods are notoriously demanding.And fickle, and often bloodthirsty.No quest is ever completed without tests and sacrifice and battle.Sashas blood woke the dark.The moment she spoke, Annika looked distressed.Im apology  			No, dont be sorry.Youre right.I felt it myself, and maybe its part of the reason I froze.I dont know.I know she wanted to drain me.Because shes not running on full power, Riley pointed out.If she was, youd be dust.Doyle took another beer.Mortal against god?Who do you lay your money on?Id bet on myself, Riley tossed back, and my four friends here.I dont know about you yet, big guy.Were more than mortals, Bran pointed out.So Id say, however fickle, the gods gave us some edge.Well use it.The star isnt in the cave.I spent considerable time looking, Doyle continued, before things got interesting.There are other caves.Riley frowned into her beer.Ill make some calls, get us a boat, some gear.We talked about trying some of the underwater caves.Maybe thats the next step.I have some things I can put together, in case she goes at us again.We werent prepared enough.Bran pushed to his feet.Thats the bottom of it.We werent prepared, and we need to be.Then we will be.Ill take care of the dishes.Sasha got up to clear.She had some ideas of her own.NINE     			Once shed set the kitchen to rights, Sasha went upstairs for her easel and paints.Shed take an hour for herself, smooth out any remaining jagged edges.She set up on the terrace, commandeering one of the tables and covering it with a drop cloth from her kit.After filling several jars with water, she set out brushes, palette knives, a palette.And began to prep a canvas.She chose a golden, fluid acrylicit would give the painting she saw in her head an underglow.She covered the edges first, then began to scrub the paint into the canvas so it would soak in.She kept the mix thin and lean, brushing it out, wiping it down until it satisfied her.Then she set the canvas on her easel, began a line drawing.Clouds and sea, the curve of sand, the rise of cliff, the shape of the channel that cut through.A sweeping view, she thought, not the more dramatic and focused study shed been compelled to paint, not the storm tossed night, but sparkling day.No figures caught in that storm and one another on the cliff, but the hint of people on shore and sea, bright drops of color and life.She mixed colorsgreens firstthe deep, dark green of cypress, the duskier hue of olive, the richer of citrus trees.All this against the sun bleached brown of the cliffs.It gave her peace, the process of it, and the ability to translate not only what she saw but what she felt with paint and brush and canvas.The blues, dreamy, bold, soft, sharpthe hints of green and aquamarine around the rocks.The pale gold of sand flowing into deeper tones where the sea rolled over it, retreated, rolled again.The clouds she painted cotton white against the pulse of blue sky, then changed brushes to add their shadows, like an echo on the sea.She lost track of time in the work, in the pleasure.With the sparkle in front of her, and on her canvas, the cold, dark shadows of the cave in the hills didnt exist.She stepped back to study what shed done, reached for a detail brush.Stopped when she heard Rileys voice, heard her coming up the terrace steps.Im all over that.Yeah, yeah, probably by nine.Really appreciate it, and tell Ari I owe him.She laughed as she came to the top of the steps.I dont owe him that much.Later.She swiped off her phone, stuck it in her pocket as she saw Sasha and the easel.Hey, sorry.Didnt know you were playing up here.I just got us ...Wow.She stopped in front of the canvas.And let me repeat.Wow.Thats amazing.Its not quite finished.Youre the boss, but it looks perfect to me.I Googled you, you know.You did?Oh, yeah, the first night.Wanted a sense of who was what.I brought up some of your paintings, and they were pretty great.But this?Alive and in person, its freaking awesome.Thanks.I wanted to do something sunny, something clear and beautiful.Like cleansing the palate, I guess.A thought struck her.Ill trade you.Huh?Ill make you a trade for the painting if you want it.I did enough digging to have an idea what an original Sasha Riggs goes for.But ...I figure my firstborns a ways off, so thats safe.Interested, she shoved her hands in her pockets, studied the painting again.Wanted it.What did you have in mind?Teach me to fight.You want me to teach you to fight?Today, in the cave, I froze.Now that Ive calmed down, and finished my pity party, I accept that wasnt altogether my fault.A god had you by the throat, Sash.Its give yourself a break time.Yeah, there was that.But my instinct right along was duck and cover, or run and hide.It wasnt stand and fight.You had the gun, but now that I can look back on it, see it all more clearly than when it was exploding around me, you werent just shooting.You used your fists, your feet.Kicks and spins.And Annika ...Yeah, she had that whole Cirque du Soleil thing going.And I just stood there because I dont know how to fight, not physically fight.You could teach me.You dont have to give me the painting for me to teach you some basics.Thumbs hooked in her pockets now, Riley studied the painting again.But since Im not an idiot, Ill take it.Can we start now?I just need to clean my brushes.I dont see why not.But somewhere more private.You should change into a T shirt or a tank, something that gives you more room.Meet me in the olive grove around back.All right.Thanks, Riley.Hey, fun for meplus the painting.I need a couple of things.She cleaned her brushes, knives, jars, exchanged her shirt for a black tank.By the time she got out to the grove, Riley was there, and pulling on leather gloves.Private enough?Sasha looked back at the villa.You could see if you looked, she thought, but she wouldnt feel nearly as exposed as she would have on one of the terraces or on the lawn in front of the house.Yes.Just enough.Okay, first things first.Make a fist.When Sasha did, Riley shook her head.Just as I figured.You keep your thumb up like that, youre going to  			Ow!Sasha snatched her hand away after Riley bent her thumb back.Exactly.Remember that, and keep your thumb folded down.See?She demonstrated; Sasha mimicked her.Thumb down.Always outside, never inside the fist.Okay, punch me.Im not going to punch you!The smirk came quickly.I can guarantee that.But try.Come on.She tapped her nose.Straight in the face or this lessons over.Irritated, intimidated, Sasha struck out.Riley tipped to the side, and let the halfhearted punch meet air.Like you mean it this time.Its my face, Sash.I can promise youre not going to hurt me.A little faith here.Thats what it came down to, didnt it?All across the board.A little faith.She punched out again, putting enough into it that when Riley sidestepped, she stumbled forward.Okay, see, youre punching like a girl.I am a girl.Nobodys a girl in a fight.Youre a fighter.You need to distribute your weight, your balance, and for right now, youre going to plant your feet.Knees a little soft, but you need to feel solid on the ground.Riley circled her.Thats better.When you punch, dont throw your body at it, bring the punch out from your shoulder.Lift your shoulder as you extend your arm.No, dont straighten your legs.The power comes up from your legs, and when you straighten them or lean forward like that, you lose power and balance.Keep your body centered.And exhale on the punch.Riley nodded or frowned as she circled, as she ordered Sasha to try it with her left.Left again.Left then right.Dont flap your elbows like chicken wings.The jabs not sexy maybe like a cross, but its your most powerful punch.Defense, offense.It punches, it pushes, and best of all it can distract while  			She jabbed out at Sasha with her left, followed it with a right cross.Both fists stopped less than an inch from Sashas face, and came so fast and hard she lost her breath.Didnt see the right coming, did you?I hardly saw either of them.How many fights have you been in?I dont keep count.Here.She held up her gloved hands, palms toward Sasha.Fist in the palm, like the ball in the glove.Left.Come on, rookie, left!Left.Right.Left.Better.Lead with your knuckles, exhale, lift your shoulder.Concentrate.I want you to rotate your arm.You lift, and as you jab, you rotate.All one motion now.Left!Sasha threw jabs until her arms ached.When she lowered them, Riley poked her.Come on, you havent even broken a sweat yet.But she reached in the small duffle shed brought out, handed Sasha a bottle of water.Hydrate anyway.I thought youd show me some martial arts, not just have me punch your hands.Baby steps, Sash.She opened the water, drank.Ive never actually hit anyone before.Riley widened her eyes.Id never have guessed.Oh, shut up.But rolling her aching shoulders, Sasha laughed.* * *  			Bran thought yanking some bloody weeds from the bloody vegetable garden might purge him of the considerable resentment still stuck in his gut.And hed take some of the herbs and roots while he was about it.He could use them.Armed with a hoe and work gloves from the garden shed, his own boline for harvesting, he made his way to the garden gate.Over the odd and homey hum the chickens made, he heard Sasha laugh.The woman plagued him, he thought with no little bitterness.Those big blue eyes filled with her hurt feelings.And worse.Disappointment.As if telling everybody and their brother you were a hereditary witch was part and parcel of everyday conversation over a bloody pint in the bloody pub.He hadnt known her a week, for Christs sake.And lets not be forgetting that being what he was, using what he had, saved her from an ugly fate.But not before shed been hurt, he thought.It fucking killed him shed been hurt.And he didnt have time for that.They were, all of them, going into a situation that risked more than cuts and bruises, so he couldnt afford to find himself worrying about her the way he found himself worrying about her.Each of them had to hold their own, use whatever skill or power at their disposal.There was a lot more at stake than one woman.He could want her, he thought, glancing toward the grove again.That was allowed.Sex never hurt anyone if done right and both were willing.And did a lot more to ease the mood and clear the mind than hoeing rows or pulling weeds.He caught movement and, curious, propped the hoe against the fence, walked to the far corner of the garden.He could see now, through the trees, Sasha in a skinny sleeveless black shirt punching into Rileys open hands.Shed twisted her hair up somehow or other, he noted, leaving the back of her neck exposed.Entertained, and considerably charmed, he leaned on the fence, watched the show.Teaching her a right cross, he realized.Doyle wandered down, stood on the other side of the fence.Whats the deal?Looks like a boxing lesson.Doyle watched a moment.Brunettes got form.The blonde hits like a girl.She does, but Ive got twenty says she wont when Rileys done teaching her.Doyle watched another moment, the way Riley demonstrated technique, or came around to take Sashas shoulders, move her body with the punch.Sucker bet, but Im going to take it anyway.Whats life without a gamble?Done.She wont give up, you see.And Riley, she wont give up on her.She may not turn her into a brawler, but Sasha will learn to hold her own.And thats needed for all of this.You could walk away from it.We all could.None of us will, if thats what youre wondering.We all got our arses handed to us today, yet here we are.With a tug of pride, Bran lifted his chin toward the olive grove.And theres the two of them, getting and giving boxing lessons under the olive trees.The gods, I think they dont understand the mortals stubborn resilience.So they underestimate us.Doyle hooked his thumbs in his pockets, watched Sasha throw a combination of jabs and crosses into Rileys hands.Boxing lesson, such as it is, makes sense.More than a sorcerer with a hoe digging up weeds.You could ...He wiggled his fingers.And get rid of them.The physical helps the brain, and Ive been taught not to use magick to be lazy.Still.As a kind of test, Bran held his hands out, spread them.After no more than a quiet shimmer, not a single weed remained.Quicker that way, Doyle commented.It is.You dont have much of a reaction to the magickal.Dated a witch.Intrigued, Bran lifted his scarred eyebrow, leaned companionably on the fence.Did you now?Redhead, built in a way made you sure Gods a man.It didnt work out between you?For a while it did.She wasnt shy about using what she had.She wasnt shy about anything, Doyle added with a grin.She couldnt help you with this venture?Not for lack of trying.But she told me there would be five others, each with a separate power.Once united, we might forge the sword that would pierce the heart of a vengeful god.Then again, she also told me love would pierce my heart with fang and claw and lead me to the path of death.He let out a half laugh.She had a way, that redhead.So ...you got dibs on the blonde?No.It seemed childish, and he Bloody hell.Yes.Just getting with the program.Hey, that was a decent combination.Frowning, Doyle watched Sasha repeat it.Decent, he repeated.Fuck me, Im going to owe you twenty.I can already see it.* * *  			As it struck him as foolish to put the weeds back, then hoe and yank at them again, Bran harvested the herbs he wanted, then walked up the hillside, through another olive grove for the roots and plants he found useful.Hed continue to work in his room, he decided, as he didnt see the point in pushing what he did and was in everyones face.Clearly theyd need more salve if their first encounter with Nerezza was any indication.Plus, the way his side had begun to pull, he needed another application himself.He considered making salves and basic potions housewiferywith no offense to the housewifein that it was both tedious and necessary.Since it was, the work on the more interesting potion and spell hed only begun would have to wait.As he wasnt in the mood for more conversation, he took the terrace steps, intending to slip into his room, deal with what needed doing.He saw the easel, the painting and, struck, stopped.It was ...glorious, he decided.He could all but smell the sea breeze wafting out of the canvas.Everything glowed, as if lit not only by the sun, but some secret, inner light.There were all manner of magicks, he thought, and she had her own.He heard her comingher laugh, or more a laughing groan, and her voice mixed with Rileys as they came up the steps.Rather than slip into his room, he turned.She glowed, he thought, like the painting.From the sun, the exercise, and he decided, the accomplishment.I was just admiring your work.It isnt finished.Isnt it?And its mine, Riley said, definitely, so dont get any ideas.If you want anything from the village, speak now.Im heading in to get the makings for my world famous margaritas.Actually, there are a couple things.Make a list or come with.Riley nodded at the herbs and plants in his hands.You making dinner?No, I have other uses for this, and since I do, Ill just give you the list Ive already made up, as I was going to ask for the loan of the jeep and go in for them myself.She took the list, glanced at it, shifted her eyes up to his.Ill see what I can do.Thanks for that.He took some money out of his pocket.Let me know if it runs more.Count on that.Ill see you back here at cocktail time.When would that be?When I get back.Ill dig out those bands for you, she told Sasha and strode off.And hows your arm?Its fine, Sasha said, just a little primly.Thank you for what you did.He cupped her elbow, examined it himself.If shed asked himwhich she hadnthe would have advised waiting at least a day before a damn boxing lesson.As it was, the graze showed pinker than he liked.Use the salve again, then once more tonight.By morning it should be well healed.All right.And the ankle?Its fine, Bran.He lifted those hooded eyes, pinned her.And youd tell me, would you, if it was otherwise?We all have to be strong and healthy if were going to face off with Nerezza again.So yes, I would.What are those for?These?For what youd call medicines for the most part.Its best to be prepared.He felt a burning in his side, and for a moment, his vision blurred.What is it?Whats wrong?Oh!Youre bleeding.He glanced down toward the burn, cursed when he saw the spread of blood on his shirt.Fuck me.How bad is it?Let me see.Before he could stop herproving he was more than a little off his gameshed tugged his shirt up.Oh, God!Did this happen today?Why didnt you tell anyone?Why are you an idiot?Its better than it was.I just ran out of salve.And arent I about to make more?Ill see to it.And you continue to be an idiot.I still have plenty.Go in.Sit down.Take off your shirt.She touched her fingers to the rawness around the scatter of open wounds.Its hot to the touch.You think I cant feel it, seeing as its myself?As fed up as she was afraid, she grabbed the plants from him, tossed them on her makeshift worktable.Inside, and sit down.Damn it, youre fussing over a cut on my arm when youve got this?I know what to do for it, he snapped, as she shoved him toward the doors.Good.Youll tell me what that is, and Ill do it.Its no wonder it wasnt done right when you insisted on doing it yourself.You cant possibly reach it all well enough to do it right, and you wouldnt have run out of salve if youd kept enough for yourself.I thought I had.Heat rolled up through him until he feared he might drop from it.I told you this isnt my strengththe healing.But he sat on the side of her bed as the room wanted to spin on him.I thought Id let it run clean, but I missed something.Get this off.She dragged the shirt over his head, then used it to staunch some of the blood.Some look like theyre healing finelike my armand others are raw, a little swollen.But this one around toward your back, its the worst.A puncturea pair of them.Fangs, she thought.I dont have to be a doctor to know infection when I see it.He twisted, winced, then bore down until he could see.And didnt care for the red streaks on his skin.Thats what I missed, though I got some of the salve on it, so now ...I need a couple of things from my room.Youre white as a sheet, she said, easily pushing him back.And youre burning up, clammy.Tell me what you need and Ill get it.I wont touch anything else, she said between her teeth when he hesitated.Itd be best if you didnt.I need a knifeshould be on the table I set up for work.And theres a leather caseI can unlock it from here.Inside are vials and jars.I need the vial with the diamond shaped stopper.Theres a blue liquid inside.Like your eyes.Clear and crystalline blue.And ...Why didnt I think of this before?A small copper bowl.Three white candles wouldnt hurt.Thats another case, much like the first.Theres a triquetra on the top.All right.Ill be right back.Careless, he told himself.But his whole side had been a misery, and he couldnt see the damn punctures on his back.Now, as shed said, there was infection, and that was running through him hot and fast, inflaming the other wounds along the way.He knew what to do, and some good could come out of it.Provided he didnt pass out first, and die while unconscious.And hed be damned if he would.She came rushing back with the bowl, the candles, the vialand three knives.I didnt know which one.My fault.Focusing against the pain made his heart hammer.He couldnt slow it.The silver handle would be best.If youd get a glass of water?Whiskeys betterbut thats a matter of taste.The water will do fine.Three drops from the vialno, make it five, considering.She got a glass of water from the bathroom, carefully added five drops from the vial, re stoppered it.What does this do?Think of it as a kind of antibiotic.He gave the glass a scowl, then downed the contents.Ah, God.Whiskey masks the taste of it, but beggars cant be choosers.You should get Sawyer or Doyle for the next.Why?Because I cant reach the fecking wound with the knife myself.It needs to be opened a certain way, and wed catch the bloodand the poison in itin the bowl.Itll be useful.Poisoned blood, useful?Dont ask if you dont want to know.Itll be messy, but it should do the job.So if youll get either Sawyer or  			Do you think Im so weak?I dont think that at all.He swayed, had to catch himself, grip the bed to sit upright.Its only that  			Because she worried she was weak, she picked up the silver handled knife.How do I open it?All right then, all right.I need to stand.He gripped one of the bedposts, pulled himself up.Fresh sweat popped out on his skin.The candles on the floor, theyre three points of a triangle.She set them out.Do they need to be lighted?Should I get matches?Yes, and no.He stretched out a hand, and the wicks flickered to life.Stand behind me, and hold the bowl under the wound in your left hand, the knife in your right.When I tell you, youre to draw a circle around the two punctures.With the knife?Not deep, just enough to break the skin.And when I tell you, youll open each puncture by carving them with an X.  Sharp and quick now, and if you feel youd hesitate, get one of the men.All right.He gripped the bedpost with both hands, and stared at the candles.Whatever you see or feel, do just as Ive said.He took a moment to steady himself, center himself.Airmed, Brigid, Dian Cecht, hear your son and servant.This pure light I offer you, one by three.As he spoke the flames speared up, shone white as the wax.Banish the dark within my blood.Within this circle, draw it clear.Now, Sasha, the circle.His fingers whitened on the bedpost as the knife point scored over his inflamed flesh.I call upon you, power to power and blood to blood, till the black runs clear, runs true.As you will, so mote it be.He braced himself.Open them, catch all that comes in the bowl.Quick and sharp.It felt as if she scored him with a flaming blade, both burn and cut sliced deep, and hot.Then the fire was in him, a burning hot wire through his blood.His skin quivered; his knees shook and wanted to buckle.Her voice came through the throbbing in his head.Just hold on.Hold on.Its nearly done.He focused on her voiceit quivered as well, but she continued to talk him through.The redness is fading.How much more?Not done.Its better, not finished, but better.He could breathe now, and as the dizziness passed, loosened his vise grip on the bedpost.It looks clear now.Nearly, he told her.Very nearly.How will I know when The three candle flames flashed, a quick, hard burst of light, then glowed quiet.Oh.That should do it.Let me get a towel to Youve stopped bleeding.Just stopped.Well, three healing deities should be able to staunch blood if theyve a mind to.Especially with some fine assistance.He turned, took the bowl from her.Its black.It came out black until ...It made her stomach roil to look at the blood.What should I do now?If you can manage it, you could coat the punctures with the salve.I can reach the rest.And that should take care of things.She took it from the top of her dresser, coated her fingers, spread it as gently as she could on the punctures.Then moved on to the scoring along his ribs.You should take this, she told him.Ill make more.How long does it take to make?A bit of time.Shed helped him, he reminded himself, so he owed her honesty.And a day to cure.Nodding, she took more salve, coated her injured arm with it, closed the jar, and then to his amused surprise, dropped it in one of the pockets of his cargoes.If I need more, Ill ask for it.All right.She looked at the bowl, the way his healthy red blood lay over the sick and black.What will you do with it?Ive some ideas to work out.For now, seal it up.Youve a steady hand, Sasha.And Im grateful.Then dont be careless again.She bent down for the candles, handed them to him.Im going to finish Rileys painting, then Im really going to be ready for one of her famous margaritas.I could do with one myself.He set the candles down, slid the knife in his belt, then picked them up again.Ill see you downstairs.He started to the door, stopped to turn back to her.Ive never thought you weak, not for a moment.I hope youve stopped thinking of yourself that way.I have.Im glad of it.He took his knife, his candles, and the copper bowl with poisoned blood and clean mixed to his room, then went back for the herbs and plants.A day to cure, he reminded himself when he considered putting off making the salve.So he cleansed his knife, sealed the blood.And got to work on the housewifery.TEN     			Riley mixed margaritas on the terrace, and considered playing bartender her kitchen contribution for the day.Along with the full pitcher and glasses, she brought out her maps.She poured the first glass, held up a finger while she sampled, then smiled.Definitely.More where this came from, she said, and sat.I got us an RIB, she began.What is that?Sasha asked.Rigid hulled inflatable boat, Doyle told her.How big?he demanded as Sasha murmured, Inflatable?Twenty eight feet, with a wheelhouse.My contact says shell do seventy knots.Bran considered the pitcher, decided why the hell not, and poured out glasses.The friend of a friend of an uncle?Not this time.Cousin of a friends husband.Outboard?Doyle asked.Yeah.Can you handle an RIB?I can, and have.Good, that makes two of us.When you say inflatable ...Sasha began.Fast, openstable.Its a good dive boat, Riley assured her.I can score us diving equipment, but were going to have to shell out some.I can get shells, all you need, Annika said.Pay, Riley explained.Ive worked us a deal, but its not free.I dont know how to dive.Youll stick with me when the time comes.I figure we start with the easier accessed caves, work our way upor down.Can you snorkel?I havent in years.Itll come back to you.As they spoke Sawyer studied Rileys maps.Ive done some research on some of these caves.The easier accessed wont be a problem, which strikes me as the problem.I dont think were going to find what were after somewhere anybody can get into.Thats a good point.But we should eliminate in any case.Bran glanced around the table for agreement.And practice as well.What about your compass?Sasha tried a sip of the margarita and thought Riley was right.Definitely.Would it help with location or direction?Obligingly, Sawyer took it out, laid it on the map.Where it sat, still and quiet.Battery low?Riley suggested.Ha.Usually it means I cant expect miracles until I put some work into it.Its fair.Annika nodded.To deserve miracles, you must work, and believe.This is very nice, she said to Riley as she drank.World famous for a reason.Okay, I can outfit us, get us going for the cost of fuel, oxygen, and a hundred euro a day.If that works, we can pick up the boat in the morning.More than a fair price.Bran deliberated over the maps.Id say we could explore and/or eliminate several of these caves in a day or two.Then move on to the less accessible.Works for me.Will you be able to dive?Sasha caught the flare of annoyance in Brans eyes, simply pushed forward.He was hurt more seriously than he told us.And theres no point being angry with me.Were a team, she reminded him.So the health of one is of concern to all.What the hell, Irish.Sashas not being fully accurate.It was more serious than I realized, and since its been dealt with now, there was no reason to bring it up.Lets see.Riley circled her finger in the air.Come on, show and tell.Nobody dives if theyre not fit for it.Thats just common sense.Bugger it.He shoved up, tugged up his shirt.Annika made a sound of sympathy, but Riley rose, gave the healing wounds a careful look.Okay, bitch got you good, but youre healing.Next time, ditch the stoic.Its true what he said.He missed treating the one on his backand it got infected, badly.And fast, Sasha added.We should use a buddy system if ...if and when this happens again.Any of us might not see how bad were hurt until it festers.Good thinking.We can pick up the boat at nine tomorrow morning.Is everyone in?Riley got nods or shrugs.Done, she declared, and poured herself another drink.* * *  			Sasha opted to make it an early night.Battling gods in the morning, boxing lessons in the afternoon, margaritas in the evening, followed by putting together a reasonable meal for six could wear a person out.And she didnt want to think about the idea of strapping on an oxygen tank and jumping off a damn inflatable boat.She got into bed with her sketch pad, leaving the terrace doors open so she could hear the sea.And unwound her crowded thoughts by drawing the olive grove, then amused herself by adding Riley and herself in boxing shorts and gloves.She did a study of the blooming prickly pear from memory, and considered the idea of doing a seriessmall, square canvasesof local flora.She drifted off, lights on, before shed finished her study of a mandarin tree.* * *  			In her own room, Riley worked on her laptop.She toggled between research and journal entries.Knowledge was a weapon to her mind, and the more you knew, the better armed.She had maps tacked to the mirror for easy reference.Some books shed downloaded to her tablet, but there were many, a great many, not available by that system.So she had a pile of old books nearby, and had already made arrangements to send for others from her library.The experience in the cave told her they didnt know nearly enough.Yet.Like Sasha, shed left her terrace doors open, and enjoyed the sound of the sea mixed with the quiet snores of Apollo, who sprawled sleeping by her chair.She had her gun, loaded and unholstered, within easy reach.And she laid her hand on it when a new soundfeet padding quietly on stonejoined the others.Her hand relaxed again when Sasha stepped up to the open doors.Hey.Thought you were conked.Brans room is empty.Hes probably still downstairs.I had some work I wanted to ...She trailed off when she got a good look at Sashas eyes in the wash of moonlight.Oh, okay.Dream walking.She got to her feet, and Apollo stirred himself with a heroic and noisy yawn.Do you need Bran?He should know.You should all know.Absolutely.Lets go find him.She walked up to Sasha, laid a hand on Apollos head to stop him from rubbing up against her dreaming friend.We can go down this way.Yes, well go together.She looked at Riley, then walking with her, up at the sky.The moon will soon be full.Yeah, it will.Did you dream about the moon?Not yet.By its light they went down the terrace steps, and together turned toward the sound of voices.The three men sat at the long table, each nursing a beer.No Annika, Riley noted.A men only deal, which stoked suspicion.You boys talking sports and the stock market?Doyle gave her a long look out of hooded eyes.You girls having a slumber party?Maybe well braid Sashas hairwhen she actually wakes up.Wheres Annika Okay, here she comes.Shes dream walking.Bran pushed away from the table.Be careful with her.She came to me, when she couldnt find you.Youre wet, Riley said to Annika.I had a swim.Is something wrong?Not wrong.Very gently, Bran touched Sashas shoulder.Did you want me?I do.I have.I will.There are secrets here, each holds them.I will keep them, even from myself, until ...She cant see them.Though she wonders, and she watches.She watches even now, in the Globe of All.The Globe of All?Bran repeated, glancing at the cupped hand Sasha held out.It is precious to her, but is not hers.What is taken in lies and through bloodshed cannot belong.But it serves her.And we are there.She cupped one hand above the other.Caught in the globe for her to see.Then she should see this.Doyle shot up a middle finger.She will come.Your sword is needed.It will take weapons and warriors, but it will take wile and will, faith and fortitude.Unity that only comes through trust and truth.She watches.She laid a hand on Brans heart.Will you draw the curtain?I can try.There is no try, only do.Sorry, Sawyer said immediately.Yodas never wrong.Riley patted his shoulder.Where should we look, Sasha?Where no one has.She watches, but it waits.Its fire cold under the blue light, it waits, the first of three in the willing heart.She cannot see, and would drain me to sharpen her sight.She wont.Bran clasped her hand in his.I swear it.She destroys what loves because she does not.And when she comes, death marches with her.When and where?Doyle demanded.Can you see that?I ...On a choked gasp, Sasha clamped her head in her hands.She claws at me.Inside my head.She tears and bites.Draw the curtain.Oh, God, draw the curtain.Wake up.Bran gripped her arms, shook her.Sasha, wake up.Locked in.She locks me in.No, you have the key.He pulled her to her toes so her eyes were level with his.You are the key.He kissed her, not gently.Use what you are.He kissed her again, and light snapped around them.Wake up!She sucked in air like a swimmer surfacing from deep water.When her bones melted, Bran scooped her up, then sat cradling her.Youre all right.My head.You came out too fast, and you will fight it.Just breathe through it.Annika, would you get her some water?What happened?Why She broke off when she realized she sat on Brans lap, outside, and in nothing but a night slip.Oh, God.Again?When she tugged the slip down her thighs, Riley let out a bark of laughter that sounded like relief.Relax, youre covered.If Id been the one wandering around dream walking, Id be standing here naked.Ive got plenty of aspirin, and a couple Percocet I hold back for emergencies.I can see to it.Breathe, Bran repeated.And relax.He laid his hands on her head, stroked, ran his fingers through her hair, took them over her forehead, back, over her scalp to the back of her neck.Put it in my hands, he murmured as Annika rushed back with a glass of water.Its only pain.I can ease it if you put it into my hands.I remember.Good.Remembering means youre not fighting it.The less you fight it, the less of an opening you give her.The Globe of All.She sipped the water.What is it?I dont know.But, Riley vowed, Ill find out.She had it, in the cave.In her hand.Did you see it?A glass ball, Sawyer said.I didnt get a good looka little busybut there was movement in it.You said it wasnt hers.I dont know whose it was, Im sorry.Ill find out, Riley assured her.Its what I do.Now whats this about a curtain?What happens when you draw a curtain?Bran continued to rub Sashas head.You block or hide things.Ill work on that.Draw curtains, you could say, around us, so were not as exposed to her.Its better now.Thanks.When she tried to get up, Bran simply held her in place.Youre fine where you are.I cant add more to any of this, at least not right now.I dont understand half of what I said, and Im too tired to think.I need to sleep.Ill take you up.You dont need to  			I need a few things from my room.He walked her up, held her for a moment in the doorway.I can protect you, at least to a point.What?Charms and spells, he said, and drew her back.Id want your permission for that.To block her out.As much as I can.The rest is for you.You are the key, Sasha.You are the master of your own gift.It doesnt feel like it.Yes.Blocking her out doesnt just help me, it helps all of us.Go on to bed then, and Ill start drawing the curtain.He went to his room, gathered what he needed, got out his book.He made up two charms specific to Sasha.By the time he went back to her room, she slept.He slipped a charm under her pillow, then lifted her head to fasten the stones hed fashioned into a necklace on a thin leather cord around her neck.It would serve, for now, he thought.The rest is up to you, he whispered, and laid his fingers on her temple, murmured the spell that would give her quiet, dreamless sleep until morning.Then he left her to do the real work of the night.He found the others still on the terrace.Is she okay?Riley asked him.Sleeping.Whats in the bag?A bit of this, some of that.He stepped back to scan the house.Big, bloody house, and well need to cloak every door and window.We can help.We want to help, Annika said.For more usual protection, there are basic spells, chants, charms.But when dealing with a god ...Still, you could help.Well cast a circle, but first we could use a broom.Seriously?Sawyer grinned.Youre not going to like  			He made a whooshing motion with his hand.Im absolutely not, no.Two brooms would save time if we have them, and as I doubt weve a cauldron handyIll be rectifying that soona large pot of water, three bowls.Glass or metal.While the others went to get what he needed, Bran went down to the lawn, set out white candles in a large ring on the grass.He set the pot Sawyer hauled out to him in the center, crossed the two brooms in front of it, set out the bowls.Carrying his bag, he walked inside the ring.Well form a circle in the circle, he said, and set the bag down.Youll need to clear and open your minds as best you can.And dont break the circle.He glanced up to Sashas doors.She asked for trust, so Im trusting its the right thing to share whats mine.He flung out his arms, and the white candles flamed.Annika applauded, then hunched, crossing her arms over her chest.Im apolsorry.Not at all.Its serious.It is, but there should always be joy.Now he held his palms up, elbows bent at his waist.On this night, in this hour, I call upon the ancient powers.We cast the circle within this light, and here we make magicks white.I am your servant, your soldier, your son.All you bid I have done.These hearts and minds the fates entwined join here with me and cast together our destiny.As you will, so mote it be.Fire bright, candlelight.Under the pot, flames sparked and lit.And the candles shot up white spears of light.Earth lift, air drift.The ground under the bowls rose into smooth mounds.The crossed brooms floated a foot above the ground.Water clear, simmer here.As the water in the pot bubbled and steamed, Bran took crystals from his bag, closed them in his fists.When he opened them, he flicked the powder theyd become into the simmering water.Vapor and blue smoke rose.Here I brew, here I make the veil of white, and all within are blocked from sight.Safe in body, mind, and heart.As he spoke he circled the pot, circled a hand in the air that stirred the wind.No power can this curtain part.And so all within remain concealed, my blood forms the seal.He took the knife from his belt, scored it across his palm.Flicked his blood into the vapor.For an instant it washed red, seemed to pulse.Then it rose thick and white.So it is done, he stated.He frowned down at his palm, closed his fist over the shallow wound.I feel like applauding myself.Riley studied the floating brooms, barely resisted tapping one just to see what happened.You put on a hell of a show, Irish.In the immortal words?You aint seen nothing yet.He smiled at her.Take a broom.She did, ran her fingers over the handle.Feels like a broom.Because it is.If youd take the other, Annika, and youll sweep over every door and window.Every one?Laughing, he patted Rileys shoulder.As I said, big, bloody house.Doyle and Sawyer, youll take a bowl each, fill it from the pot.And youll sprinkle a bit of water along windowsills and thresholds.Think of it as the base layer.As Sawyer did, Doyle took a bowl, dipped it into the pot.Whats your second act?he asked.Bran took the last bowl, dipped it.Then, holding it in two hands, smiled again.Ill be bringing the curtain down from above.So saying, he levitated, rising up over the lawn, then the house.I hate to repeat myself, but holy shit.In any language, Sawyer added.Hes got more than he let on.Considering that, Riley propped the broom on her shoulder.Okay, Anni, lets get sweeping.* * *  			Though it was barely dawn, Sasha made her way down to the kitchen.She thought shed make breakfast, as she wanted to keep her hands busyand hopefully keep everyone elses mind off the fact that shed paraded around half naked the night before.Very first chance, shed invest in some pajamas.She found Riley already in the kitchen inhaling coffee.I thought I was the first up.Riley kept inhaling, shook her head.Ended up researching late, conked a couple hours.Woke up restless and itchy.So coffee.Figured Id break some eggs or whatever for breakfast, but now that youre here ...Ill do it.Even better.Nice necklace.Sasha lifted her hand to it as she walked to the refrigerator.I was wearing it when I woke up.I assume it means something.Closer look.Riley slipped a finger under it, studied the stones and crystals.Research mode tells me these are protective stones.To, like, ward off negative thoughts and intentionsagainst you.Since its easy money Bran put it on you, Id say its potent and aimed at Nerezza.Hows your head this morning?Its fine.I need pajamas.On a hooting laugh, Riley walked back for more coffee.I dont think the little number you were almost wearing had the biggest impact.Not that you werent fetching.Up yours, Riley.Thats the way.Plus, as it turned out, you were only the warm up act.What?Sasha nearly bobbled the eggs shed pulled out.What happened?Bran happened.She leaned against the counter, crossed her ankles.You know, Ive seen all sorts of rituals, ceremonies, and seen some wild stuff in my line, but he topped all of it.
