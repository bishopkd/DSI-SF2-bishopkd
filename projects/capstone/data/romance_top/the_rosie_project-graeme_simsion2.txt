But then it wont matter, said Frances.Ill have been eliminated.Only as a potential partner.We may still be able to have an interesting discussion.But Ill have been eliminated.I nodded.Do you smoke?Occasionally, she said.I put the questionnaire away.Excellent.I was pleased that my question sequencing was working so well.We could have wasted time talking about ice cream flavors and makeup only to find that she smoked.Needless to say, smoking was not negotiable.No more questions.What would you like to discuss?Disappointingly, Frances was not interested in further conversation after I had determined that we were not compatible.This turned out to be the pattern for the remainder of the event.These personal interactions were, of course, secondary.I was relying on the Internet, and completed questionnaires began to flow in shortly after my initial postings.I scheduled a review meeting in my office with Gene.How many responses?he asked.Two hundred and seventy nine.He was clearly impressed.I did not tell him that the quality of responses varied widely, with many questionnaires only partially completed.No photos?Many women had included photos, but I had suppressed them in the database display to allow space for more important data.Lets see the photos, Gene said.I modified the settings to show photos, and Gene scanned a few before double clicking on one.The resolution was impressive.It seemed that he approved, but a quick check of the data showed that the candidate was totally unsuitable.I took the mouse back and deleted her.Gene protested.Wha wha wha?Whatre you doing?She believes in astrology and homeopathy.And she calculated her BMI incorrectly.What was it?Twenty three point five.Nice.Can you undelete her?Shes totally unsuitable.How many are suitable?asked Gene, finally getting to the point.So far, zero.The questionnaire is an excellent filter.You dont think youre setting the bar just a tiny bit high?I pointed out that I was collecting data to support lifes most critical decision.Compromise would be totally inappropriate.You always have to compromise, Gene said.An incredible statement and totally untrue in his case.You found the perfect wife.Highly intelligent, extremely beautiful, and she lets you have sex with other women.Gene suggested that I not congratulate Claudia in person for her tolerance, and asked me to repeat the number of questionnaires that had been completed.The actual total was greater than the number I had told him, as I had not included the paper questionnaires.Three hundred and four.Give me your list, said Gene.Ill pick a few out for you.None of them meet the criteria.They all have some fault.Treat it as practice.He did have a point.I had thought a few times about Olivia the Indian Anthropologist and considered the implications of living with a Hindu vegetarian with a strong ice cream preference.Only reminding myself that I should wait until an exact match turned up had stopped me from contacting her.I had even rechecked the questionnaire from Fabienne the Sex Deprived Researcher.I emailed the spreadsheet to Gene.No smokers.Okay, said Gene, but you have to ask them out.To dinner.At a proper restaurant.Gene could probably tell that I was not excited by the prospect.He cleverly addressed the problem by proposing an even less acceptable alternative.Theres always the faculty ball.Restaurant.Gene smiled as if to compensate for my lack of enthusiasm.Its easy.How about we do dinner tonight?Say it after me.How about we do dinner tonight?I repeated.See, that wasnt so hard.Make only positive comments about their appearance.Pay for the meal.Do not mention sex.Gene walked to the door, then turned back.What about the paper ones?I gave him my questionnaires from Table for Eight, the singles party, and, at his insistence, even the partially completed ones from the speed dating.Now it was out of my hands.six   Approximately two hours after Gene left my office with the completed Wife Project questionnaires, there was a knock on the door.I was weighing student essays, an activity that is not forbidden, but I suspect only because nobody is aware that I am doing it.It was part of a project to reduce the effort of assessment by looking for easily measured parameters such as the inclusion of a table of contents or a typed versus handwritten cover sheet, factors which might provide as good an indication of quality as the tedious process of reading the entire assignment.I slipped the scales under my desk as the door opened, and looked up to see a woman I did not recognize standing in the doorway.I estimated her age as thirty and her body mass index at twenty.Professor Tillman?As my name is on the door, this was not a particularly astute question.Correct.Professor Barrow suggested I see you.I was amazed at Genes efficiency and looked at the woman more carefully as she approached my desk.There were no obvious signs of unsuitability.I did not detect any makeup.Her body shape and skin tone were consistent with health and fitness.She wore glasses with heavy frames that revived bad memories of Apricot Ice Cream Woman, a long black T shirt that was torn in several places, and a black belt with metal chains.It was lucky that the jewelry question had been deleted, because she was wearing big metal earrings and an interesting pendant around her neck.Although I am usually oblivious to dress, hers seemed incompatible with my expectation of a highly qualified academic or professional and with the summer weather.I could only guess that she was self employed or on vacation and, freed from workplace rules, had chosen her clothes randomly.I could relate to this.There had been quite a long gap since either of us spoke and I realized it must be my turn.I looked up from the pendant and remembered Genes instructions.How about we do dinner tonight?She seemed surprised at my question, then replied, Yeah, right.How about we do dinner?How about Le Gavroche and youre paying?Excellent.Ill make a reservation for eight p. m.   Youre kidding.It was an odd response.Why would I make a confusing joke with someone I barely knew?No.Is eight p. m.  tonight acceptable?Let me get this straight.Youre offering to buy me dinner at Le Gavroche tonight?Coming on top of the question about my name, I was beginning to think that this woman was what Gene would call not the sharpest tool in the shed.I considered backing out, or at least employing some delaying tactic until I could check her questionnaire, but could not think of any socially acceptable way to do this, so I just confirmed that she had interpreted my offer correctly.She turned and left and I realized that I did not even know her name.I called Gene immediately.There seemed to be some confusion on his part at first, followed by mirth.Perhaps he had not expected me to handle the candidate so effectively.Her names Rosie, he said.And thats all Im telling you.Have fun.And remember what I said about sex.Genes failure to provide me with more details was unfortunate, because a problem arose.Le Gavroche did not have a table available at the agreed time.I tried to locate Rosies profile on my computer, and for once the photos were useful.The woman who had come to my office did not look like any candidate whose name began with R.  She must have been one of the paper responses.Gene had left and his phone was off.I was forced to take action that was not strictly illegal but doubtless immoral.I justified it on the basis that it would be more immoral to fail to meet my commitment to Rosie.Le Gavroches online reservation system had a facility for VIPs.I made a reservation under the name of the Dean after logging on using relatively unsophisticated hacking software.I arrived at 7:59 p. m.  The restaurant was located in a major hotel.I chained my bike in the foyer, as it was raining heavily outside.Fortunately it was not cold and my Gore Tex jacket had done an excellent job of protecting me.My T shirt was not even damp underneath.A man in uniform approached me.He pointed toward the bike, but I spoke before he had a chance to complain.My name is Professor Lawrence and I interacted with your reservation system at five eleven p. m.   It appeared that the official did not know the Dean or assumed that I was another Professor Lawrence, because he just checked a clipboard and nodded.I was impressed with the efficiency, though it was now 8:01 p. m.  and Rosie was not there.Perhaps she was (b) a little early and already seated.But then a problem arose.Im sorry, sir, but we have a dress code, said the official.I knew about this.It was in bold type on the website: Gentlemen are required to wear a jacket.No jacket, no food, correct?More or less, sir.What can I say about this sort of rule?I was prepared to keep my jacket on throughout the meal.The restaurant would presumably be air conditioned to a temperature compatible with the requirement.I continued toward the restaurant entrance, but the official blocked my path.Im sorry.Perhaps I wasnt clear.You need to wear a jacket.Im wearing a jacket.Im afraid we require something a little more formal, sir.The hotel employee indicated his own jacket as an example.In defense of what followed, I submit the Oxford English Dictionary (Compact, 2nd Edition) definition of jacket: 1(a) An outer garment for the upper part of the body.I also note that the word jacket appears on the care instructions for my relatively new and perfectly clean Gore Tex jacket.But it seemed his definition of jacket was limited to conventional suit jacket.We would be happy to lend you one, sir.In this style.You have a supply of jackets?In every possible size?I did not add that the need to maintain such an inventory was surely evidence of their failure to communicate the rule clearly, and that it would be more efficient to improve their wording or abandon the rule altogether.Nor did I mention that the cost of jacket purchase and cleaning must add to the price of their meals.Did their customers know that they were subsidizing a jacket warehouse?I wouldnt know about that, sir, he said.Let me organize a jacket.Needless to say I was uncomfortable at the idea of being redressed in an item of public clothing of dubious cleanliness.For a few moments, I was overwhelmed by the sheer unreasonableness of the situation.I was already under stress, preparing for the second encounter with a woman who might become my life partner.And now the institution that I was paying to supply us with a mealthe service provider who should surely be doing everything possible to make me comfortablewas putting arbitrary obstacles in my way.My Gore Tex jacket, the high technology garment that had protected me in rain and snowstorms, was being irrationally, unfairly, and obstructively contrasted with the officials essentially decorative woolen equivalent.I had paid $1,015 for it, including $120 extra for the customized reflective yellow.I outlined my argument.My jacket is superior to yours by all reasonable criteria: impermeability to water, visibility in low light, storage capacity.I unzipped the jacket to display the internal pockets and continued, Speed of drying, resistance to food stains, hood ...The official was still showing no interpretable reaction, although I had almost certainly raised my voice.Vastly superior tensile strength ...To illustrate this last point, I took the lapel of the employees jacket in my hands.I obviously had no intention of tearing it, but I was suddenly grabbed from behind by an unknown person who attempted to throw me to the ground.I automatically responded with a safe, low impact throw to disable him without dislodging my glasses.The term low impact applies to a martial arts practitioner who knows how to fall.This person did not and landed heavily.I turned to see him: he was large and angry.In order to prevent further violence, I was forced to sit on him.Get the fuck off me.Ill fucking kill you, he said.On that basis, it seemed illogical to grant his request.At that point another man arrived and tried to drag me off.Concerned that Thug Number One would carry out his threat, I had no choice but to disable Thug Number Two as well.No one was seriously hurt, but it was a very awkward social situation, and I could feel my mind shutting down.Fortunately, Rosie arrived.Jacket Man said, apparently in surprise, Rosie!Obviously he knew her.She looked from him to me and said, Professor TillmanDonwhats going on?Youre late, I said.We have a social problem.You know this man?said Jacket Man to Rosie.What do you think, I guessed his name?Rosie sounded belligerent and I thought this might not be the best approach.Surely we should seek to apologize and leave.I was assuming we would not now be eating in the restaurant.A small crowd had gathered and it occurred to me that another thug might arrive, so I needed to work out a way of freeing up a hand without releasing the original two thugs.In the process one poked the other in the eye, and their anger levels increased noticeably.Jacket Man added, He assaulted Jason.Rosie replied, Right.Poor Jason.Always the victim.I could now see her.She was wearing a black dress without decoration, thick soled black boots, and vast amounts of silver jewelry on her arms.Her red hair was spiky like some new species of cactus.I have heard the word stunning used to describe women, but this was the first time I had actually been stunned by one.It was not just the costume or the jewelry or any individual characteristic of Rosie herself: it was their combined effect.I was not sure if her appearance would be regarded as conventionally beautiful or even acceptable to the restaurant that had rejected my jacket.Stunning was the perfect word for it.But what she did was even more stunning.She took her phone from her bag and pointed it at us.It flashed twice.Jacket Man moved to take it from her.Dont you fucking think about it, Rosie said.Im going to have so much fun with these photos that these guys will never stand on a door again.Professor teaches bouncers a lesson.As Rosie was speaking, a man in a chefs hat arrived.He spoke briefly to Jacket Man and Rosie, and on the basis that we would be permitted to leave without further harassment, Rosie asked me to release my assailants.We all got to our feet, and in keeping with tradition, I bowed, then extended my hand to the two men, who I had concluded must be security personnel.They had only been doing what they were paid for and had risked injury in the course of their duties.It seemed that they were not expecting the formalities, but then one of them laughed and shook my hand, and the other followed his example.It was a good resolution, but I no longer felt like eating at the restaurant.I collected my bike and we walked into the street.I expected Rosie to be angry about the incident, but she was smiling.I asked her how she knew Jacket Man.I used to work there.You selected the restaurant because you were familiar with it?You could say that.I wanted to stick it up them.She began to laugh.Maybe not quite that much.I told her that her solution was brilliant.I work in a bar, she said.Not just a barthe Marquess of Queensbury.I deal with jerks for a living.I pointed out that if she had arrived on schedule, she could have used her social skills and the violence would have been unnecessary.Glad I was late then.That was judo, right?Aikido.As we crossed the road, I switched my bike to my other side, between Rosie and me.Im also proficient in karate, but aikido was more appropriate.No way.It takes forever to learn that stuff, doesnt it?I commenced at seven.How often do you train?Three times per week, except in the case of illness, public holidays, and travel to overseas conferences.What got you into it?asked Rosie.I pointed to my glasses.Revenge of the nerds, she said.This is the first time Ive required it for self defense since I was at school.Its primarily for fitness.I had relaxed a little, and Rosie had provided an opportunity to slip in a question from the Wife Project questionnaire.Do you exercise regularly?Depends what you call regularly.She laughed.Im the unfittest person on the planet.Exercise is extremely important for maintaining health.So my dad tells me.Hes a personal trainer.Constantly on my case.He gave me a gym membership for my birthday.At his gym.He has this idea we should train for a triathlon together.Surely you should follow his advice, I said.Fuck, Im almost thirty.I dont need my dad telling me what to do.She changed the subject.Listen, Im starving.Lets get a pizza.I was not prepared to consider a restaurant after the preceding trauma.I told her that I intended to revert to my original plan for the evening, which was cooking at home.Got enough for two?she asked.You still owe me dinner.This was true, but there had been too many unscheduled events already in my day.Come on.I wont criticize your cooking.I cant cook to save my life.I was not concerned about my cooking being criticized.But the lack of cooking skills on her part was the third fault so far in terms of the Wife Project questionnaire, after the late arrival and the lack of fitness.There was almost certainly a fourth: it was unlikely that her profession as waitress and barmaid was consistent with the specified intellectual level.There was no point in continuing.Before I could protest, Rosie had flagged down a minivan taxi with sufficient capacity for my bike.Where do you live?she asked.seven   Wow, Mr.Neat.How come there are no pictures on the walls?I had not had visitors since Daphne moved out of the building.I knew that I only needed to put out an extra plate and cutlery.But it had already been a stressful evening, and the adrenaline induced euphoria that had immediately followed the Jacket Incident had evaporated, at least on my part.Rosie seemed to be in a permanently manic state.We were in the living area, which adjoins the kitchen.Because after a while I would stop noticing them.The human brain is wired to focus on differences in its environmentso it can rapidly discern a predator.If I installed pictures or other decorative objects, I would notice them for a few days and then my brain would ignore them.If I want to see art, I go to the gallery.The paintings there are of higher quality, and the total expenditure over time is less than the purchase price of cheap posters.In fact, I had not been to an art gallery since the tenth of May, three years before.But this information would weaken my argument and I saw no reason to share it with Rosie and open up other aspects of my personal life to interrogation.Rosie had moved on and was now examining my CD collection.The investigation was becoming annoying.Dinner was already late.You really love Bach, she said.This was a reasonable deduction, as my CD collection consists only of the works of that composer.But it was not correct.I decided to focus on Bach after reading Gdel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter.Unfortunately I havent made much progress.I dont think my brain works fast enough to decode the patterns in the music.You dont listen to it for fun?This was beginning to sound like the initial dinner conversations with Daphne and I didnt answer.Youve got an iPhone?she said.Of course, but I dont use it for music.I download podcasts.Let me guesson genetics.Science in general.I moved to the kitchen to begin dinner preparation and Rosie followed me, stopping to look at my whiteboard schedule.Wow, she said, again.This reaction was becoming predictable.I wondered what her response to DNA or evolution would be.I commenced retrieval of vegetables and herbs from the refrigerator.Let me help, she said.I can chop or something.The implication was that chopping could be done by an inexperienced person unfamiliar with the recipe.After her comment that she was unable to cook even in a life threatening situation, I had visions of huge chunks of leek and fragments of herbs too fine to sieve out.No assistance is required, I said.I recommend reading a book.I watched Rosie walk to the bookshelf, briefly peruse the contents, then walk away.Perhaps she used IBM rather than Apple software, although many of the manuals applied to both.The sound system has an iPod port that I use to play podcasts while I cook.Rosie plugged in her phone, and music emanated from the speakers.It was not loud, but I was certain that if I had put on a podcast without asking permission when visiting someones house, I would have been accused of a social error.Very certain, as I had made this exact mistake at a dinner party four years and sixty seven days ago.Rosie continued her exploration, like an animal in a new environment, which of course was what she was.She opened the blinds and raised them, creating some dust.I consider myself fastidious in my cleaning, but I do not need to open the blinds and there must have been dust in places not reachable without doing so.Behind the blinds are doors, and Rosie released the bolts and opened them.I was feeling very uncomfortable at this violation of my personal environment.I tried to concentrate on food preparation as Rosie stepped out of sight onto the balcony.I could hear her dragging the two big potted plants, which presumably were dead after all these years.I put the herb and vegetable mixture in the large saucepan with the water, salt, rice wine vinegar, mirin, orange peel, and coriander seeds.I dont know what youre cooking, Rosie called out, but Im basically vegetarian.Vegetarian!I had already commenced cooking!Based on ingredients purchased on the assumption that I would be eating alone.And what did basically mean?Did it imply some limited level of flexibility, like my colleague Esther, who admitted, only under rigorous questioning, that she would eat pork if necessary to survive?Vegetarians and vegans can be incredibly annoying.Gene has a joke: How can you tell if someone is a vegan?Just wait ten minutes and theyll tell you.If this were so, it would not be so much of a problem.No!Vegetarians arrive for dinner and then say, I dont eat meat.This was the second time.The Pigs Trotter Disaster had happened six years ago, when Gene suggested that I invite a woman to dinner at my apartment.He argued that my cooking expertise would make me more desirable and I would not have to deal with the pressure of a restaurant environment.And you can drink as much as you like and stagger to the bedroom.The womans name was Bethany, and her Internet profile did not mention vegetarianism.Realizing that the quality of the meal would be critical, I borrowed a recently published book of nose to tail recipes from the library and planned a multicourse meal featuring various parts of the animal: brains, tongue, mesentery, pancreas, kidneys, etc.Bethany arrived on time and seemed very pleasant.We had a glass of wine, and then things went downhill.We started with fried pigs trotter, which had been quite complex to prepare, and Bethany ate very little of hers.Im not big on pigs trotters, she said.This was not entirely unreasonable: we all have preferences and perhaps she was concerned about fat and cholesterol.But when I outlined the courses to follow, she declared herself to be a vegetarian.Unbelievable!She offered to buy dinner at a restaurant, but having spent so much time in preparation, I did not want to abandon the food.I ate alone and did not see Bethany again.Now Rosie.In this case it might be a good thing.Rosie could leave and life would return to normal.She had obviously not filled in the questionnaire honestly, or Gene had made an error.Or possibly he had selected her for her high level of sexual attractiveness, imposing his own preferences on me.Rosie came back inside, looking at me, as if expecting a response.Seafood is okay, she said.If its sustainable.I had mixed feelings.It is always satisfying to have the solution to a problem, but now Rosie would be staying for dinner.I walked to the bathroom, and Rosie followed.I picked up the lobster from the bath, where it had been crawling around.Oh shit, said Rosie.You dont like lobster?I carried it back to the kitchen.I love lobster but ...The problem was now obvious and I could sympathize.You find the killing process unpleasant.Agreed.I put the lobster in the freezer and explained to Rosie that I had researched lobster execution methods, and the freezer method was considered the most humane.I gave her a website reference.While the lobster died, Rosie continued her sniffing around.She opened the pantry and seemed impressed with its level of organization: one shelf for each day of the week, plus storage spaces for common resources, alcohol, breakfast, etc., and stock data on the back of the door.You want to come and sort out my place?You want to implement the Standardized Meal System?Despite its substantial advantages, most people consider it odd.Just cleaning out the refrigerator would do, she said.Im guessing you want Tuesday ingredients?I informed her that, as today was Tuesday, no guessing was required.She handed me the nori sheets and bonito flakes.I requested macadamia nut oil, sea salt, and the pepper grinder from the common resources area.Chinese rice wine, I added.Filed under alcohol.Naturally, said Rosie.She passed me the wine, then began looking at the other bottles in the alcohol section.I purchase my wine in half bottles.So, you cook this same meal every Tuesday, right?Correct.I listed the eight major advantages of the Standardized Meal System.1.No need to accumulate recipe books.2.Standard shopping listhence very efficient shopping.3.Almost zero wastenothing in the refrigerator or pantry unless required for one of the recipes.4.Diet planned and nutritionally balanced in advance.5.No time wasted wondering what to cook.6.No mistakes, no unpleasant surprises.7.Excellent food, superior to most restaurants at a much lower price (see point 3).8.Minimal cognitive load required.Cognitive load?The cooking procedures are in my cerebellumvirtually no conscious effort is required.Like riding a bike.Correct.You can make lobster whatever without thinking?Lobster, mango, and avocado salad with wasabi coated flying fish roe and crispy seaweed and deep fried leek garnish.Correct.My current project is quail boning.It still requires conscious effort.Rosie was laughing.It brought back memories of school days.Good ones.As I retrieved additional ingredients for the dressing from the refrigerator, Rosie brushed past me with two half bottles of Chablis and put them in the freezer with the lobster.Our dinner seems to have stopped moving.Further time is required to be certain of death, I said.Unfortunately, the Jacket Incident has disrupted the preparation schedule.All times will need to be recalculated.I realized at this point that I should have put the lobster in the freezer as soon as we arrived home, but my brain had been overloaded by the problems created by Rosies presence.I went to the whiteboard and started writing up revised preparation times.Rosie was examining the ingredients.You were going to eat all this by yourself?I had not revised the Standardized Meal System since Daphnes departure, and now ate the lobster salad by myself on Tuesdays, deleting the wine to compensate for the additional calorie intake.The quantity is sufficient for two, I said.The recipe cant be scaled down.Its infeasible to purchase a fraction of a live lobster.I had intended the last part as a mild joke, and Rosie reacted by laughing.I had another unexpected moment of feeling good as I continued recalculating times.Rosie interrupted again.If you were on your usual schedule, what time would it be now?Six thirty eight p. m.   The clock on the oven showed 9:09 p. m.  Rosie located the controls and started adjusting the time.I realized what she was doing.A perfect solution.When she was finished, it showed 6:38 p. m.  No recalculations required.I congratulated her on her thinking.Youve created a new time zone.Dinner will be ready at eight fifty five p. m. Rosie time.Beats doing the math, she said.Her observation gave me an opportunity for another Wife Project question.Do you find mathematics difficult?She laughed.Its only the single hardest part of what I do.Drives me nuts.If the simple arithmetic of bar and restaurant bills was beyond her, it was hard to imagine how we could have meaningful discussions.Where do you hide the corkscrew?she asked.Wine is not scheduled for Tuesdays.Fuck that, said Rosie.There was a certain logic underlying Rosies response.I would only be eating a single serving of dinner.It was the final step in the abandonment of the evenings schedule.I announced the change.Time has been redefined.Previous rules no longer apply.Alcohol is hereby declared mandatory in the Rosie Time Zone.eight   As I completed dinner preparation, Rosie set the tablenot the conventional dining table in the living room, but a makeshift table on the balcony, created by taking a whiteboard from the kitchen wall and placing it on top of the two big plant pots, from which the dead plants had been removed.A white sheet from the linen cupboard had been added in the role of tablecloth.Silver cutlerya housewarming gift from my parents that had never been usedand the decorative wineglasses were on the table.She was destroying my apartment!It had never occurred to me to eat on the balcony.The rain from early in the evening had cleared when I came outside with the food, and I estimated the temperature at twenty two degrees Celsius.Do we have to eat right away?asked Rosie, an odd question, since she had claimed that she was starving some hours ago.No, it wont get cold.Its already cold.I was conscious of sounding awkward.Is there some reason to delay?The city lights.The views amazing.Unfortunately its static.Once youve examined it, theres no reason to look again.Like paintings.But it changes all the time.What about in the early morning?Or when it rains?What about coming up here just to sit?I had no answer that was likely to satisfy her.I had seen the view when I bought the apartment.It did not change much in different conditions.And the only times I just sat were when I was waiting for an appointment or if I was reflecting on a problem, in which case interesting surroundings would be a distraction.I moved into the space beside Rosie and refilled her glass.She smiled.She was almost certainly wearing lipstick.I attempt to produce a standard, repeatable meal, but obviously ingredients vary in their quality from week to week.Todays seemed to be of an unusually high standard.The lobster salad had never tasted so good.I remembered the basic rule of asking a woman to talk about herself.Rosie had already raised the topic of dealing with difficult customers in a bar, so I asked her to elaborate.This was an excellent move.She had a number of hilarious stories, and I noted some interpersonal techniques for possible future use.We finished the lobster.Then Rosie opened her bag and pulled out a pack of cigarettes!How can I convey my horror?Smoking is not only unhealthy in itself and dangerous to others in the vicinity, it is a clear indication of an irrational approach to life.There was a good reason for its being the first item on my questionnaire.Rosie must have noticed my shock.Relax.Were outside.There was no point in arguing.I would not be seeing her again after tonight.The lighter flamed and she held it to the cigarette between her artificially red lips.Anyhow, Ive got a genetics question, she said.Proceed.I was back in the world I knew.Someone told me you can tell if a persons monogamous by the size of their testicles.The sexual aspects of biology regularly feature in the popular press, so this was not as stupid a statement as it might appear, although it embodied a typical misconception.It occurred to me that it could be some sort of code for a sexual advance, but I decided to play safe and respond to the question literally.Ridiculous, I said.Rosie seemed very pleased with my answer.Youre a star, she said.Ive just won a bet.I proceeded to elaborate and noted that Rosies expression of satisfaction faded.I guessed that she had oversimplified her question and that my more detailed explanation was in fact what she had been told.There may be some correlation at the individual level, but the rule applies to species.Homo sapiens are basically monogamous but tactically unfaithful.Males benefit from impregnating as many females as possible but are able to support only one set of offspring.Females seek maximum quality genes for their children plus a male to support them.I was just settling into the familiar role of lecturer when Rosie interrupted.What about the testicles?Bigger testicles produce more semen.Monogamous species require only the amount sufficient for their mate.Humans need extra to take advantage of random opportunities and to attack the sperm of recent intruders.Nice, said Rosie.Not really.The behavior evolved in the ancestral environment.The modern world requires additional rules.Yeah, said Rosie.Like being there for your kids.Correct.But instincts are incredibly powerful.Tell me about it, said Rosie.I began to explain.Instinct is an expression of  Rhetorical question, said Rosie.Ive lived it.My mother went gene shopping at her medical graduation party.These behaviors are unconscious.People dont deliberately  I get that.I doubted it.Nonprofessionals frequently misinterpret the findings of evolutionary psychology.But the story was interesting.Youre saying your mother engaged in unprotected sex outside her primary relationship?With some other student, replied Rosie.While she was dating myat this point Rosie raised her hands and made a downward movement, twice, with the index and middle fingers of both handsfather.My real dads a doctor.I just dont know which one.Really, really pisses me off.I was fascinated by the hand movements and silent for a while as I tried to work them out.Were they a sign of distress at not knowing who her father was?If so, it was not one I was familiar with.And why had she chosen to punctuate her speech at that point ...of course!Punctuation!Quotation marks, I said aloud as the idea hit me.What?You made quotation marks around father to draw attention to the fact that the word should not be interpreted in the usual way.Very clever.Well, there you go, she said.And there I was thinking you were reflecting on my minor problem with my whole fucking life.And might have something intelligent to say.I corrected her.Its not a minor problem at all!I pointed my finger in the air to indicate an exclamation mark.You should insist on being informed.I stabbed the same finger to indicate a full stop.This was quite fun.My mothers dead.She died in a car accident when I was ten.She never told anyone who my father wasnot even Phil.Phil?I couldnt think of how to indicate a question mark and decided to drop the game temporarily.This was no time for experimentation.Myhands up, fingers wiggledfather.Whod go apeshit if I told him I wanted to know.Rosie drank the remaining wine in her glass and refilled it.The second half bottle was now empty.Her story was sad but not uncommon.Although my parents continued to make routine, ritual contact, it was my assessment that they had lost interest in me some years ago.Their duty had been completed when I was able to support myself.Her situation was somewhat different, however, as it involved a stepfather.I offered a genetic interpretation.His behavior is completely predictable.You dont have his genes.Male lions kill the cubs from previous matings when they take over a pride.Thanks for that information.I can recommend some further reading if you are interested.You seem quite intelligent for a barmaid.The compliments just keep on coming.It seemed I was doing well, and I allowed myself a moment of satisfaction, which I shared with Rosie.Excellent.Im not proficient at dating.There are so many rules to remember.Youre doing okay, she said.Except for staring at my boobs.This was disappointing feedback.Rosies dress was quite revealing, but I had been working hard to maintain eye contact.I was just examining your pendant, I said.Its extremely interesting.Rosie immediately covered it with her hand.Whats on it?An image of Isis with an inscription: Sum omnia quae fuerunt suntque eruntque ego.I am all that has been, is, and will be.I hoped I had read the Latin correctly; the writing was very small.Rosie seemed impressed.What about the pendant I had on this morning?Dagger with three small red stones and four white ones.Rosie finished her wine.She seemed to be thinking about something.It turned out not to be anything profound.Want to get another bottle?I was a little stunned.We had already drunk the recommended maximum amount.On the other hand, she smoked, so obviously she had a careless attitude to health.You want more alcohol?Correct, she said, in an odd voice.She may have been mimicking me.I went to the kitchen to select another bottle, deciding to reduce the next days alcohol intake to compensate.Then I saw the clock: 11:40 p. m.  I picked up the phone and ordered a taxi.With any luck it would arrive before the after midnight tariff commenced.I opened a half bottle of Shiraz to drink while we waited.Rosie wanted to continue the conversation about her biological father.Do you think there might be some sort of genetic motivation?That its built into us to want to know who our parents are?Its critical for parents to be able to recognize their own children.So they can protect the carriers of their genes.Small children need to be able to locate their parents to get that protection.Maybe its some sort of carryover from that.It seems unlikely.But possible.Our behavior is strongly affected by instinct.So you said.Whatever it is, it eats me up.Messes with my head.Why dont you ask the candidates?Dear Doctor.Are you my father?I dont think so.An obvious thought occurred to me, obvious because I am a geneticist.Your hair is a very unusual color.Possibly  She laughed.There arent any genes for this shade of red.She must have seen that I was confused.This color only comes out of a bottle.I realized what she was saying.She had deliberately dyed her hair an unnaturally bright color.Incredible.It hadnt even occurred to me to include hair dyeing on the questionnaire.I made a mental note to do so.The doorbell buzzed.I had not mentioned the taxi to her, so brought her up to date with my plan.She quickly finished her wine, then stuck her hand out, and it seemed to me that I was not the only one feeling awkward.Well, she said, its been an evening.Have a good life.It was a nonstandard way of saying good night.I thought it safer to stick with convention.Good night.Ive really enjoyed this evening.I added Good luck finding your father to the formula.Thanks.Then she left.I was agitated, but not in a bad way.It was more a case of sensory overload.I was pleased to find some wine left in the bottle.I poured it into my glass and phoned Gene.Claudia answered and I dispensed with pleasantries.I need to speak with Gene.Hes not home, said Claudia.She sounded disoriented.Perhaps she had been drinking.I thought he was having lobster with you.Gene sent me the worlds most incompatible woman.A barmaid.Late, vegetarian, disorganized, irrational, unhealthy, smokersmoker!psychological problems, cant cook, mathematically incompetent, unnatural hair color.I presume he was making a joke.Claudia must have interpreted this as a statement of distress because she said, Are you all right, Don?Of course, I said.She was highly entertaining.But totally unsuitable for the Wife Project.As I said these words, indisputably factual, I felt a twinge of regret at odds with my intellectual assessment.Claudia interrupted my attempt to reconcile the conflicting brain states.Don, do you know what time it is?I wasnt wearing a watch.And then I realized my error.I had used the kitchen clock as my reference when phoning the taxi.The clock that Rosie had reset.It must have been almost 2:30 a. m.  How could I have lost track of time like that?
