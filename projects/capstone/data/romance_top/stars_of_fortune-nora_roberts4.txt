For good luck.Sasha is next.Pick one!Take one of the pieces of eight, Riley told her.You know you want to.Its too  			Believe me, she can spare it.Go ahead.For luck then.Thank you, Annika.Now, Bran.Breakfast was very, very good.Pick one.For sentiment, he took an Irish punt, then kissed her cheek.Youre a fine, good friend, darling.Now, will you trust me with your coins, as Id like to put them somewhere safe.I trust my friends.Youre my friend.And youre a rare flower.Lets get these back in the bag here.The Augustus, Riley began.Its handled it so far.Ill put these away, Annika, and today well buy you your hiking boots and whatever else there is.A gift from us.Oh, thank you.He hefted the bag, looked at Sawyer, Riley, Sasha.Trust me with it?You wouldnt break her trust, Sasha said.Make it right and tight, Irish.Riley blew out a breath when he nodded and walked back into the house.Hey, Sawyer, how about you and Annika handle the KP.Sash and I will deal with the chickens today.Sure.Lets clear the table, get the dishes done.Then well go shopping?Looks like.Riley gestured to Sasha, walked out of earshot.Is she, you know, challenged?Oh, no, its not that.Shes ...I dont know how else to describe what I get from her.Shes pure.Its more than that.Im not saying shes not pure, but shes evading.People just dont find priceless coins on the floor, on the ground, in the back of a drawer.And she had hundreds of coins.Hundreds, and the couple dozen I saw?Even taking out the heifer, she had a tidy little treasure there.Whered she get it?If you think she stole it, I have to say I dont think shes capable of that sort of dishonesty.I dont think she stole them, but, Sash, I make my living finding things, and Im damn good at it.Nobodys good enough or lucky enough to just find coins like that.Riley paused at a little shed, pulled out two buckets, scooped feed into one of them.She wouldve given it to me.Shed have been happy to give me that priceless coin, so money doesnt mean a thing to her.There are secrets in there, and likely major ones.I know.I know it, but I just dont want to push her to tell us.Id rather she told us when shes ready to.Riley angled over a look as they walked past the garden to the clucking chickens.A lot of people, probably most, get pissed when someone holds something back, then lets it spill.I think were all entitled to judge for ourselves when and if were ready to tell our secrets.Everyone has them.Lets all remember that.Okay, do me a favor?If I can.Ive got that five riding with Bran that I can get our new girl in, outfitted, and out inside twenty minutes.Help me keep it moving, will you?Sure.What are friends for?Frowning now, she watched the chickens strut aroundand stare at the humans, she thought, with tiny eyes.I dont know how to feed chickens.Or get eggs from them.Well figure it out.SEVEN     			Riley lost the bet.Despite the team effort, it took twice the time shed calculated to outfit Annika in practical hiking wear.She figured she couldve gotten herself in and out in a fraction of that time, but then again, she didnt insist on touching every freaking thing first.Bran simply held out his hand, and she slapped five euros into it.And found it hard to bitch too much as he took out a credit card to pay for Annikas boots and shoes, and the hat hed snagged for Sasha, as it matched the one shed drawn on herself in her dream sketch.You rich, Irish?Ive enough to cover this.And with what weve locked away, shes more than good for it.He glanced over to see Annika holding up a bright pink rash guard, turning this way and that in the mirror while Sawyer just grinned at her.Better get her out of here before she decides she needs to try on another two dozen things.God, youd think we were trolling at Saks instead of a sporting goods store.Hey, princess!Lets move out.Can we get more?Do they have earrings?I like earrings.Some other time.Some help here, Sawyer.They flanked her, maneuvered hernow clad in boots, cargoes, T shirt, vest, and hatto the door.I can pitch in with this.Sasha moved up behind Bran.Quicker this way, and we can sort it all out later.He picked up the hat, settled it on her head.Suits you.Why dont you go make sure Annika doesnt drag them into another shop?Maybe he was the fidh, Sasha thought as Annika was indeed trying to negotiate her way into a gift shop with a display window full of trinkets.Well come back.Going the direct route, Sasha grabbed Annikas hand and tugged.I like shopping.There are so many pretty things.She frowned down at her boots as they walked to the car.The boots are not pretty.Neither is twisting an ankle on a rough trail, Riley declared, and let out a whoosh of relief when they piled in the jeep with Sasha and Sawyer sandwiching Annika between them in the back.Bran came out, stowed the bags, dropped into the passenger seat.Thank you for all my things, even the boots.Riley punched it, headed out of the village.We may have to look into a bigger ride, Sawyer called out over the wind.Ive got plenty of room.Riley flicked a glance in the rearview mirror, smirked.If we do find the guy in Sashas sketch, no way hes going to fit in here.We havent found him yet.Any feel on that, Sash?I just know we will.She watched the world rush by, and thought how quickly shed grown used to Rileys speedy driving.He rides a dragon.A what now?Sasha shook her head.I dont know where that came from or what it means.Well find him, or hell find us.Riley turned, headed inland.The land rose into hills and forests with bright splashes of wildflowers, a blinking flash of a small settlement.Lambs, fluffballs of white, played in olive groves.She could no longer smell the sea, but instead the warm, sunstruck green of cypress and olive.Riley turned again, onto a spit of a road that slithered and snaked up.And though she hadnt tried to, she felt Annikas heart thunder.Are you all right?Its beautiful.The trees are so many.Yes, they were so many, Sasha thought, and made her think of her little house in the woods.It would be the same when she returned to it.But she wondered if she would be.Riley pulled off into what was essentially a ditch.On foot from here.Armed with their packs, with Riley, her roughly drawn map and compass on point, they left the road, started west.Sasha found it amazing to cross a field where donkeys cropped at grass and wildflowers.So amazed she didnt have time to worry when one walked over to her, stared.Hoping you have something edible to share, I wager.Bran stopped with her, gave the donkey a scratch between his long ears.He has such sweet eyes.I wish I had an apple.Well, lets see.Bran turned her around, tapped at her pack.When he turned her around again, he held out a small, glossy green apple.You really have to show me how to do that.He smiled as he took out his pocketknife, cut the apple in half.I might be persuaded.Here, give it to him.And the firsts continue.Im feeding a donkey.Then wed best get moving before his friends come round looking for theirs.I feel like Annika.Its all so beautiful.They walked on, leaving the field for a rough track where brushwood of myrtle and bay tangled, and tall, slim towers of cypress speared among the olives.They passed a jumble of rocks decorated with the sturdy wildflowers that pushed their way through cracks toward the sun.She felt that way, as if shed pushed through barriers toward the light.Youre happy, Bran commented.Im hiking the hills of Greece on a gorgeous spring day.Theres so much to see.To smell, she added, dragging her hand over a bush of wild rosemary to send its fragrance rising.Im not going to think about where were going.Its enough just to be here.Why did you kiss me?She hadnt meant to ask, and hadnt been able to stop the thought from forming into words.Well, the usual reasons apply.She told herself to leave it there, leave it alone.Then thought the hell with it.You could have kissed Riley or Annika, for the usual reasons.Thats true enough, isnt it?Theyre both appealing, attractive, interesting women in their own ways.But I wasnt inclined to kiss them.And now that youve got me thinking about it, I can tell you theres no doubt Ill be inclined again where youre concerned.He said it so matter of factly, she wasnt sure whether to be amused, insulted, or a little afraid.Dont you have someone back in Ireland, or New York?I do, of course.But not the way you mean.Ive friends on both sides of the ocean, and family as well.But no woman waiting for me to sail home again.If there were, Id never have put my hands on you, and certainly wouldnt take you to bed.I never said I  			When you do, he said easily.Theres more here than a hike in the hills, than a quest.Dont you wonder, fidh, what it is?She didnt know how to do this, Sasha decided, didnt know how to hold up her end of flirty, sexy conversation.And she quit while she was behind.I wonder why Rileys taking the left fork when the caves to the right.Is it then?Bran asked.Riley!Its that way.Up ahead, Riley stopped and turned.Map says left.But its right.You can see She broke off, stared ahead where shed clearly seen the dark mouth of the cave under a stone ledge.It simply wasnt there.I thought I saw ...Maybe you did.The seer or the map?Bran asked the others.After a moments hesitation, Riley nodded.Well take the right fork.It offered a harder climb, and didnt that just figure.The grade went steep, and the track rutted and rocky.Yet flowers bloomed, sturdy and stubborn, and a narrow stream, barely a handspan wide, cut its way down through springing green and dusty rock.A Judas tree bloomed gloriously where the rutted track forked yet again.Which way?Riley asked her.I dont  			Dont think.Bran laid a hand on her shoulder, featherlight.Know.The left this time.They missed the first fork when they told you.Its to the left, but they didnt see ...What lived inside her spreadarms lifted to pull away a veil.Sashas own arms dropped to her sides; her eyes went to cobalt.The devils breath comes through its dripping jaws.In its belly lie the bones of murdered men who scream in the dark, of women who weep for lost children.Only light from fire, from water, from ice, will free them.Sorry.She braced against the trunk of the tree while her head spun with visions, with the echo of her own words.Im a little dizzy.It came on so fast, like a shove off a cliff.Here.Annika offered a bottle.Its water.Its good.Thanks.My boots arent pretty.Oh, for Christs sake Riley began.But Riley was right.You were right, she said to Riley.They arent pretty, but they are strong.And strong is important.Yes.Sasha took a steadying breath.Yes, it is.She handed Annika the bottle.Thank you.To the left, fear pricked at her skin, tiny little thorns, but she couldnt turn away.Were close now.She followed the track, and her instincts.Her legs ached from the hike, but she ignored the pain.Her lungs labored, but she pushed up the track toward what she feared.When the sun flashed in her eyes, she blinked the glare away.Then stood staring at the dark mouth under its wide stone ledge.Does everyone see it?she asked.Straight ahead.Good work, Sash.Riley gave her a light punch on the arm.Wed have gone the wrong way.Maybe someone wanted us to, Sawyer suggested.Bran and I should go in first, get the lay of it.You get one really stupid man remark, Riley commented, and made a check mark in the air.Make another, and I punch your pretty face.Then Ill take mine as well, and say he has a point.All five of us go in straightaway, Bran continued, theres no one out here to get help should something go wrong.Youve got two minutes.Riley held up her arm, tapped her watch.On my mark.Into the belly then.Bran moved forward with Sawyer.Not the belly, Sasha thought.The mouth.The belly lay deeper.They stepped under the ledge and in.Dark spread ahead, light shone behind, as if they walked out of day into night.Each pulled out a flashlight, swept the beam.Got your dripping jaws right here.Sawyer shined his light over the thick stalactites dripping with moisture.Over time the wet had formed a small pool behind the tooth curve of stalagmites.The rhythmic plop of water against water echoed like a quiet heartbeat.Tight quarters here, Bran noted, but  			Yeah, it opens up.No way of knowing how far back it goes.Not from here.Sawyer scanned the area, shifted his weight.What are the chances of talking them into staying out while we go back?None.And more, I think however it goes against the instincts, it must be all of us, whatever the risks.Whether the star is here or not, I think it must be all of us.Yeah, I know it.Ill give them the come ahead.But hed only started back when Riley ducked under the ledge, came in with the others behind her.Times up.Theres your jaws, Sasha, as advertised.Devils Breath.Im betting that pool throws off a mist, and when it carries outside the mouth of the cave, youve got your breath.Leading with her flashlight, she circled the mouth.Little low in here for you tall people.More headroom as you go back, at least initially.She moved through the bars of stone, crouched by the pool.Not deep, fairly clear.Nothing in there I can see.She glanced over at Sasha.All right.Though she dreaded it, Sasha moved to the pool.I dont see anything, in it or from it.Okay.Is everybody up for heading in?She shook her head as Annika waved her flashlight in a circle, watched the beam.Its  			Yeah, pretty.She pushed up, and as Bran had already started back, the others followed.The walls stood no more than six feet apart, but the roof of the cave rose until the men could walk comfortably upright.Noting Sawyer kept Annika close, Sasha decided she didnt have to worry about their playful teammate.Its bigger than I imagined, Sasha said, and nearly jumped as her voice echoed.Bigger, she thought, and darker.The walls widened, offered two chambers.Which way?Bran asked her.What does your instinct tell you?he added when she hesitated.To the right.But  			To the right it is.Hold on.Riley dug chalk out of her pack, marked the wall of the chamber.Always good to know where youve been.The chamber opened, higher and wider yet.Stalactites, stalagmites, and the columns they formed when they met glimmered in the light in golds and reds and umbers.Like jewels, Annika said.Different minerals in the stone.Riley studied the area.But Ill give you pretty here.Sasha played her light over a column, moved to it.You need to see this.It looks like a woman.Look, her head, shoulders, body, all beautifully proportioned.Her faceeyes, nose, mouth.Its not painted or carved.How could the stone have formed this way?She stood, long, dark hair, lithe form in flowing robes.Her eyes looked down, as if watching them.One hand, lifted, gestured to the back of the cave.The other held a globe.No way thats a natural formation, Riley said.It had to be made.Its not painted, Sasha repeated.There are other ways.Bran aimed his light where the figure pointed.Theres a ledge there, and an opening above it.Ill go in, scout it out, Sawyer began, then caught the movement.Riley.Its what I do, she reminded him, and boosted herself onto the ledge and through.Hell.All of us then.Stay close, he ordered Sasha.Annika went in behind them, glanced back at the stone figure.I dont like her, she murmured as Sawyer pulled up the flank.They crawled for about ten feet, where it suddenly occurred to Sasha she might be a little claustrophobic after all.Then Riley called out.Another chamber, and a big one.Theres a drop, about three feet.Sasha heard the scrape of boots on rock, then the thud of a landing.Ill have you, Bran said before he dropped lightly into the dark.With his flashlight showing her the way, he held up a hand for hers.Relax your knees, he warned her.She took the leap, caught her breath.Before Bran could turn to offer Annika a hand, shed jumped down gracefully.Not dark, Sasha realized, or not completely.A light came from somewhere, pale and slightly ...off.But it showed her the size of the cave, the smoothed teeth of rock stretching toward the floor, the others that soared up from it.All red, she thought, all red as blood.A weight dropped on her chest, and her head swam.Dont.She reached out as Riley approached a formation that resembled a raised table.Dont touch it.Dark deeds done.Riley, Bran said sharply.Touch nothing.In silent assent, Riley lifted her free hand, playing the light over the table stone.Theres writing carved here.Ancient Greek.Bones.Human bones piled over here.Sawyer turned from them.Can you hear them screaming?Sasha fisted her hands over her ears.The children.She craved the children.The youth.The innocence.Im getting her out of here.Wait, just wait, Riley snapped at Bran.I can read this.In blood taken.In blood given.So she may live, so she may rise.In the name of Nerezza.As she spoke the name, came a stirring, the dry rustling overhead.Just bats.Dont panic.Rileys warning came seconds before the screams, and the dark flood of wings.Instinctively Sasha covered her head and face, curled up to make herself smaller.She felt the spidery wings brush her hair, shuddered.Just bats, she told herself.Just bats.She gasped at the quick pain as something sliced her arm.Grabbing it, she felt the warm, wet flow of her own blood.They bite!Theyre not just bats.Riley pulled a gun from the holster snugged at the small of her back.Run.She shot one flying toward her face, and the sound crashed through the chamber.Echoed by another as Sawyer fired another gun.Blood fell on the ground, splattered on the altar.And the ground shook.Bats circled, looking down with hungry, somehow human eyes.She formed out of the dark.The black robe swirled around her, and her hair, dense as midnight, curled in sleek coils around her face.The face formed in the stone, and she smiled with terrible beauty.I have waited.While the bats swooped and squealed, she lifted her hands.In one she held the glass ball.I have watched.Her voice rang over the chaos, over the ring of bullets, of shouts and screams.Armed with only her flashlight, Sasha swung out to defend herself, saw Sawyer pivot to take aim at a bat diving toward Annika.In a liquid blur of movement, Annika flipped back, pushed off with her hands and sent the bat smashing into the cave wall with a powerful thrust of her legs.Your blood.She stepped off a pedestal, bent gracefully to run her finger through the blood that had dripped from Sashas arm to the cave floor.It is warm, she said as she licked it delicately from her finger as she might a dab of rich chocolate or cream.Your power is strong and ...tasty.Through your blood I will drink that power.Through that power the path to the stars.Trapped, fighting to avoid fangs, claws, wings, Sasha stumbled back only to find herself pressed against the wall.Across the chamber, Riley shouted, fired.But the bullets passed through the figure walking toward Sasha.Something gripped her mind, something cold and fierce.She fought to pry it loose, felt it give, just a little.Very strong.Now that same force, the cold and fierce, gripped her throat, cutting off her air.All she felt was her own fear, and pushing against it dark hate, bottomless greed.Come with me, and live.Lies.The mother of lies.Nerezza.Somethingsomeoneleaped out of the shadows.A sword flashing silver in the dim red light.It cleaved through the swarming bats, severing them.As if through water, Sasha heard someone shouting.Get out!Go.Give me what I want.Nerezza loomed closer.Or I will crush you, and all you love.Not today.Bran shoved Sasha behind him.While she gasped in breath, choked it out again, he threw up both his hands.Lightning bolted from them, blinding white.Nerezza threw up an arm to shield her eyes, and from her came a roar more beast than human.Get her out!Bran shouted.Get her out of here.This wont hold long.The bats swirled up, reformed, and like a great winged arrow came at him.The swordsman thrust, hacked, sent severed bodies tumbling to the ground while bullets pierced more.Get her out.Brans voice, ice cold, snapped out.Get them all out.The swordsman grabbed Riley, all but tossed her into the tunnel.He caught Annika as she finished a series of flips that sent bats tumbling.Go!Get Sasha, Sawyer ordered, and ranged himself beside Bran.Im not leaving you, man.Then get ready to move.Out of the corner of his eye he saw the swordsman lift Sasha under one arm, glance back with a kind of fierce regret, then boost her with him into the tunnel.Go when I say, Bran said.There wont be time to hesitate.Im right behind you.My word on it.If youre not, Im coming back.Bran felt Nerezza pushing back against his power, knew he didnt have enough.Not here, not yet.Now.Go now!he shouted at Sawyer, then heaved both bolts to the ground.The explosion rocked the chamber, filled it with wild light, thick smoke.Understanding that fierce regret, he dived into the tunnel behind Sawyer.Dont stop, he ordered.I dont know how long a reach she has.The rock shook under them.Contrary to orders, Sawyer paused after he jumped out of the tunnel until Bran came out behind him.White smoke curled out of the opening.Id say youve got a pretty damn long one.Nice work, he added as they ran for the mouth of the cave.Just outside the mouth, the man and his sword stood guard with Riley, arguing bitterly.Thats a sword, this is a gun.Guess who wins.She swiped at the blood on her face, smeared more from the cuts on her hand.I dont want to shoot you, but you can bet your ass I will if you dont get out of my way.Im going back for my friends.If you shoot me, youre going to piss me off.Then he turned when he heard running footsteps.Theyre coming, he said, and stepped aside.The minute they stepped clear, Riley punched Bran in the chestthough she pulled it.Then she threw her arms around both of them.Son of a bitch.Son of a bitch.Dont ever push me out like that again.She dragged Sawyers head down, kissed him soundly on the mouth, then took Brans head in turn.Youve got some splaining to do.This isnt the time or place.He patted her cheek, nudged her aside to go to where Annika sat on the ground beside Sasha, gently tending her wounds with Rileys first aid kit.He crouched down, stroked a finger down her cheek, then over the raw, red bruising around her throat.Im sorry I couldnt get to you more quickly.Im sorry she hurt you.Who are you?What Ive told you.Perhaps a bit more.Her nice shirt is ruined, but the cuts arent very bad.Annika wound a bandage around the long gash in Sashas arm.But she is shocked.In shock, Riley corrected.She got the worst of it.It was going way south before you stepped in with the light show.We just couldnt hold our own.She glanced back at Sawyer.But nice shooting, Tex.Back at you.Who the hell are you people?They looked back at the newcomer.Hed housed his sword in the sheath he wore on his back and stood, legs spread, face scowling.Just as Sasha had depicted him, in detail, in one of her sketches.The breeze caught at his black, disordered sweep of hair, tossing it around a face that might have been carved with razors.The high slash of cheekbones, the sharply sculpted, unsmiling mouth, the long, patrician blade of nose.His eyes were fierce and burning green.Riley ran a measuring gaze over him, from the scarred boots that laced up to midcalf, the long legs in well worn jeans, the blood splattered shirt over a broad torso.She pushed to her feet.Riley Gwin, archaeologist; Sawyer King, dead eye; Annika Waters, adorable ass kicker.Aww, Annika said, delighted.Sasha Riggs, seer.And Bran Killian, magician.To say the fucking least.And who the hell are you?McCleary.Doyle McCleary.And if you lot hadnt been in the way, I might have had the bitch at last.Fat chance, Riley tossed back.We can have a fine argument about all of it, away from here.Do you mind?Bran asked as he tapped Sashas backpack.When she shook her head, he reached in and found, as hed thought he would, the sketch of the six of them.Rising, he walked over to Doyle.First, Ill thank you for the assist.Sasha was hurt, and I dont know if I could have held the bitch and gotten everyone out safe without it.As to who we are, well, theres this.He offered the sketch.Were a team, and youd be the last of us.Who drew this?I did.Sashas voice came hoarsely through her abused throat.Weeks ago.How did  			Not now, Bran interrupted.Were all of us bloody and battered.We have a place where we can talk.Private.How the hell are we going to fit him in the jeep?Riley wondered.I have my own way of getting around.Doyle looked at all of them, back at the cave.Shook his head.Ill go with you, and talk about this.He handed the sketch back to Bran.Then well see.Fair enough.Bran went back to Sasha, started to lift her.She pushed his hands away.I can walk.She got to her feet.She might have been chilled and queasy, but she could damn well walk.To prove it, she started back toward the track.Yeah, some splaining.Riley patted Brans arm, then went after Sasha.She didnt know youre a wizard?Doyle commented.No.I hadnt found the right time to tell her, or the others.Doyle gave what might have been a sympathetic grunt, then walked away.Shell come around.Sawyer reached out a hand to help Annika to her feet.Youve got some wild moves, Anni.I really liked the one where you ran halfway up the wall, flipped backward, then did a handspring.Its fun.I dont like to fight.Maybe not, but youre good at it.When they followed the others, Bran looked after them, then back at the cave.His white smoke blocked the mouth, for now, but was already beginning to thin.It told him he had a great deal of work yet to do.He hefted his pack back into place as he watched Sasha walklimping a bit, he noteddown the rough track.A great deal of work yet, he thought, in several areas.EIGHT     			Doyles way of getting around turned out to be pulled off into the brushwood well down the trail.As he brought it out, Riley fisted her hands on her hips.Classic.Harley Chopper.Twin Vs?Thats right.Bet she moves.Like his boots, the bike showed some battle scarsand like its owner, looked muscular and tough.The dragon!Annika pointed to the red dragon, wings out, talons curled, painted on the side of the engine.You ride the dragon.Sasha said.Yeah.Where am I riding it?Just west of Sidari, Bran told him.It would be easier if you followed us in.All right.That yours?he asked, gesturing to the jeep farther down.It is.Can I ride the dragon, too?Doyle hesitated, then shrugged.I hate saying no to a beautiful woman, so I wont.He swung a leg over, nodded to Annika.Hop on.Sawyer hesitated.You have to hold on to him, he told Annika.And lean into the turnsnot against.Just lean into them a little.Okay?Okay.She got on behind Doyle, and laughed when he turned on the engine.It roars!Hold on to him, Sawyer repeated, then quickened his steps to catch up to the others.Shell be all right.I dont think we just came through that little experience for her to take a header off a bike.Riley got behind the wheel.Relax.Take the front.Bran got into the back.Youre pissed, and I wont argue about it, he said to Sasha as Riley navigated down the excuse for a road.Ill explain once were back at the villa and settled down some.I just want to sleep.And turning away from him, closing her eyes, Sasha surprised herself by doing just that.* * *  			She woke, headachy, her throat burning, her arm throbbing, when Riley bumped up the road to the villa.When she got out, found her legs shaky, she wanted to crawl back into sleep.I need to clean up.You can start without me.Bran took her arm.Sasha.She yanked free.I can feel her on me.I need a shower.Shaky or not, she got her legs moving, rushed straight into the house.Give her a little space, Riley advised, giving the welcoming Apollo a quick rub.She glanced over toward Doyle as Annika jumped off the bike.Look, well get some food first, give her time to settle.She looked down at her hands.I want to clean up some myself.Fine.Well all have a nice wash.Ill take mine down at the beach, Sawyer decided.Oh, yes, a swim!Ill go with you.Great.Grab your suit.She looked blank.My suit?Bathing suit.Oh, yes.I have one.She dashed into the house, and Sawyer went up the terrace steps.Whats her story?Doyle asked Bran.Weve a lot of stories among us.If youd wait a half hour.Were a bloody mess, so well do better cleaned up, and getting some food.There are two rooms left, and you can have your pick.Im a long way from staying.That may be, but youve bat blood and guts and Christ only knows on you same as the rest of us.You can use the shower, do what you do after we talk.Ill show you which rooms are left, and you use whichever you like.I wouldnt mind a shower.Come inside, and you can have the two penny tour along the way.Hell of a house in a hell of a spot.Whose is it?Friend of a friend of an uncleof Rileys.Shes connections.Handy.It has been.McCleary, is it?So your people are from Ireland?Back a ways, Doyle said as they started upstairs.Mine are still thereor most of them.Sligo.Clare.Im told.Well, McCleary.Either of these two rooms are open to you.This ones fine.Then its yours.Be at home, and if youll come down when youre ready, well put some food together and talk this through.He went into his own room, stripped down, and took a good look at his side.The cuts and slices on his arms didnt bother him overmuch, but his side showed a maze of punctures and gashes from when a group of the bastards had swarmed him when hed tried to get to Sasha.Gone now, he thought.Hed burned them to cinders, but theyd gotten some pieces of him along the way.He moved to the dresser, brushed a hand over the drawer to release the locking spell hed put on.He lifted out a case where he kept some potions and brews, took what he needed, locked up the rest again.In the shower, he hissed as the water hit the wounds, then just braced his hands on the tile wall, and let those wounds run clean.Once hed washed, let the water beat most of the aches away, he got out of the shower, examined the wounds again, and laid the salve on thick.Immediately the raw edge of pain eased.He bandaged it as best he could, dressed, then went to face the music.* * *  			Sasha wept in the shower.The jag increased the headache, but she felt steadier purged of tears.She ran the water as hot as she could bear until it no longer felt as if spiders crawled over her skin.She scrubbed that skin, ignoring the pain when she hit cuts and scrapes, washed her hair.Scrubbed again, washed again.And finally felt clean.After wrapping herself in a towel, she wiped the mirror clear of fog, studied her face, traced the bruising at her neck.Shed been weak, she thought, and couldnt, wouldnt be weak again.If she continued thisand she knew she wouldshe had to be smarter, stronger, more prepared.She wouldnt cower back a second time while some demon goddess from hell tried to take her over.She wouldnt be used again or deceived again.People underestimate you because you underestimate yourself, she told her reflection.That stops now.She walked out of the bath, then stopped when she saw Bran at her open terrace doors, looking out.I need you to leave.He turned back, studied her as she stood, hair sleek and wet, her hand clutching the towel between her breasts.And insult and anger in her eyes.I have a salve.He held up the small jar.I can help with the wounds, and with the pain.I dont want  			Stop being a git.Youre not a stupid woman.You want to be pissed, be pissed, he invited as his own temper clawed at him.Stay pissed after I explain, thats your choice to make, but now youll sit down and let me help.Youre not in charge of me.And thank the gods for that.But were all in this together, and Ill do what I can to help the others in turn.But you took the brunt of it.Now sit down, and be pissed and smart.Refusing, she realized, was weak, was letting her hurt and disappointment cloud judgment.She needed to be strong and well to fight.So she sat on the side of the bed.He came over, set the salve down.And laid his hands gently on her head.Thats not  			Your head aches, thats clear to see.She tried getting into your mind, didnt she?And youve been crying.So your head hurts.He brushed his thumbs over her temples, her forehead.Im not as good at this as others, but with you being an empath  			Im not.For Christs sake, woman, dont argue with what I know.Impatience snapped, a whiplash.You block most out, but its there.Use it now, in a kind of reverse, and that will help me help you.Let me feel it, open up and let me feel.Well start with the headache, as youll think clearer then.Because he was right, because thered been impatience rather than pity, she closed her eyes, offered her pain.There now, he murmured, and his fingers stroked her brow, her skull, her temples.Its a dark gray cloud.He ran his hands down, pressed thumbs into the base of her neck.Its whisking away as a breeze comes up.Cool and fresh.Feel it.She did, and the horrible, gripping pressure eased.Yes, thats better.Thats better, she repeated, and nudged his hands aside.Thank you.Youve cuts and scrapes and bruises, and a puncture or two.The salve alone will do for that, but this gash needs more.Annika did a finewhat do they call it?field dressing.Shes an array of disparate talents.Let me feel it.Yes, its hot, and it throbs.And would scar if he couldnt fix it.It surprised him how the thought of that upset him.But its clean.Nothing to fester here.How do you know?You know, and I can see what you know here.Help me cool it now, help me close it.She lost herself in his eyes.It occurred to her later he must have taken her into some light trance, but her feelings seemed to touch his, like fingertips, and the heat of her arm cooled.Thats good now, thats fine.And the salve will do the rest right enough.A little dazed, she looked down to see the gash closed, and no more than a long scrape remaining.But, thats  			Magick?he suggested.Its healing, and youre doing most of the work.What about your leg?Youre favoring the right one.I dont know.I must have twisted or turned my ankle in the cave.When the bats ...We wont think of them now.He crouched, skimmed his hands over her ankle, eased back when she flinched.Tender, is it?Well fix it.She understood now, let him in.Imagined the swelling, the tendons and muscles while his fingers circled and stroked.Then he rose.Your throat, thats the worst of it, and the hardest.She touched you.She didnt.Not physically.And thats the deepest wound, you see?Her power against ours.I think it will hurt to heal this, at first.You have to trust me.Then I will.For this.Keep your eyes on mine.I dont have what you have, but what I have will help you lift this away.He closed his hands lightly, gently, around her throat, covering the raw bruises.It did hurt.A sudden shock of pain stole her breath, had her gripping the side of the bed to hold herself in place.She fought not to cry outweak, weakbut a moan escaped.Im sorry.A little more.He murmured in Irish now, words that meant nothing to her, but the tone, both comfort and distress, helped her bear it.Then, as the rest, it eased.The relief made her head spin.Its better.It needs to be gone.I wont leave her mark on you.I should have stopped it.You did.With blinding bolts of lightning.Thats enough.It doesnt hurt.She shifted away, stood.You should take the salve for the others.Thats for you.I have more.Ill be down as soon as I get dressed.We all have a lot to talk about.We do.But he stood where he was, waited.You lied to me.I never did.The absence of truth  			Isnt always a lie.Sometimes its just personal business.I told you everything about me, everything I knew, and you ...What are you?A warlock?He winced, had to struggle not to be insulted.Some will insist on turning that word away from its originwhich is one who does evil, even the deviland making into a man with powers.Ill take witch, even sorcerer, but I prefer magician, which is what I told you when we met.Accusations, and worse, much worse, disappointed hurt lived in her eyes.You know what I thought you meant.I do, and theres an absence there.Still, I do stage magic to make a living and to entertain myself.And my blood, my craft, my gift, and my honor is in white magicks.But its considerable to share with someone who doesnt trust her own gifts, fidh.What would your reaction have been, I wonder, if Id shown you more than a bit of sleight of hand at first?I dont know.My family keeps our bloodline to ourselves, not out of shame, but caution.I can wish now Id been able to show you what I am, who I am, in its entirety, in a less dramatic way, but Nerezza took the choice out of my hands.She meant to drain me.I never anticipated, and for that ...Im sorry.Im sorry I didnt plan it better, or find a better way.But I cant be sorry for what I am, or for waiting until I felt there was real trust before I told you, or the others.Did you kiss me to help create trust?He cursed, surprising her with the quick flare of anger as he strode around the room.Thats an insult to both of us.Bloody hell.He grabbed her, yanked her to him without any of the care or gentleness hed shown in the healing.The flare of anger remained hot and ready in the kiss.You know it all now, so what was that about, do you suppose?I have to think about it.Fine then, you do that.Ill be down when Im dressed.Thats grand.He strode out, gave the door a quick, bad tempered slam.She turned, walked to the mirror.No marks remained on her throat, and color had come back into her face.She didnt feel weak now, Sasha realized.And that was a damn good start.* * *  			Sawyer put his spin on sandwiches with grilled ham and cheese.Annika once again created a tablescape with napkins folded into flowers arranged along a winding river of plates.Once again wearing one of her flowy dresses, she stopped her work to turn and give Sasha a hard and heartfelt hug.You look pretty, and you feel better.Thanks, and I do.Were you hurt?Only a little, and Bran gave us a salve that smells very nice.Dont have mad at him.Im working on it.Wheres ...I cant remember his name.You mean Doyle.Doyle McCleary.Riding his dragon is fun.He came down, and he wanted to walk around the villa, to see the lay of the land.Cant blame him.Annika, thank you for helping me when I was hurt.Were here to help each other.As simple as that, Sasha thought.Youre exactly right.Lets have some wine.I like wine.Ill get it.She went into the kitchen, where Sawyer flipped the last of the sandwiches onto a platter, and Riley pulled beer from the fridge.Dead Eye here has hidden depths, Riley said.He made salsa.Everything was here.Sawyer turned.Ready to eat?Sasha hadnt thought she could face food, and now found the opposite true.More than, and those look great.Were missing Doyle and Bran.Theyre doing a walkabout.Snooze you lose, Riley announced.Howre you doing?Fine now.How about both of you?Bumps and cuts, and nothing a hot shower and Brans magic salve didnt deal with.Probably shouldnt have said magic, Riley realized.It is what it is.Annika and I are having wine.She chose a bottle, got glasses, and took them out with her.She came around quick, Sawyer observed.Men.Pitying him, Riley screwed a half dozen beers into a bucket shed filled with ice.Shes pissed, cutie.Down to a smolder maybe, but pissedand trying to figure out how she feels about the fact that she was locking lips a few hours ago with a guy who turns out to be a sorcerer.Oh, yeah?Lip lock?Talk about smoldering.She winked at him, hefted the bucket.And noticed when she carried it out, Bran and Doyle rounding the side of the villa.They struck her as pretty easy with each other already.Order up!she called to Sawyer, then plucked out a beer, dropped down into a chair.She waited until Sawyer brought the food, until others had taken wine or beer.Then lifted her own bottle.Heres to a damn good fight.When Sasha just stared, Riley gestured with the bottle.Any fight you walk away from and polish off with a cold beer is a good fight.Cant argue with that.Doyle took a sandwich.Got beer, got foodand appreciate it.But I still dont have answers.Mr.Wizards being vague.Lets get specific.Mr.Wizard.Riley snorted out a laugh.Thats a good one, she insisted as the others kept silent.Sash, you should start rolling the ball, seeing as you got things going.I dont think I got anything going, but all right.She took a sip of wine first.Im an artist.I could see that from the sketch.I live in North Carolina, now.Ive always had ...A gift, Bran finished, as if daring her to contradict him.She just ignored him.Right after the first of the year, I began having dreams, about usall of us hereand about the stars.She took him up to her arrival at the hotel in Corfu.So you just hopped on a plane and ...followed your dreams?I couldnt ignore them, couldnt make them stop, so yes, thats what I did.Riley, you should take it from there.Sure.Most excellent salsa, she added, and dipped a chip in the hill shed put on her plate.Tracking legends, myths, finding antiquities and artifactsthats what I do.The stars have been on my radar for a long time, and Id dug up some information that arrowed here.Id just finished a job, had some time, and decided to see what I could find out on the spot.She waved the bottle, took another hit.The thing isand I didnt mention this beforeI didnt plan to stay in that hotel.Id planned to come to this area all along, but I had this impulse, is the best I can say.Treat yourself to a good hotel for a day or two, Riley, take a break.So there I was, taking a break with a very nice Bellini on the hotel terrace, and up walks the blonde.When shed finished her side of it, she reached for another beer.Over to you, Bran.Hed wrangled with himself over how much to tell them, what he should hold back.And decided, considering all, on full disclosure.Someone in my family, generation by generation, has been tasked to look for the stars, to hold them safe, and to one day return them to where they began, to where they can never be used for ill.So it came to me.We descend from Celene.The goddess?Riley set her beer down.Youre a god?Im not.Impatience sharpened his voice.Im what I told you.Im a magician, and descended from her.She mated with a sorcerera mortaland bore his son.The demigod Movar, Riley prompted, conceived with the sorcerer called Asalri.As you say.And Movar had five sons and three daughters.I know the legend.Or, Riley corrected, your family tree.The gift of magicks has come through the blood, and so has the quest for the stars.I came here because, as with you, Riley, I came upon some information.While once again scouring books until my eyes bled, I came on a passage that spoke of a fallen star, one of fire, waiting in a land of green.You might think Greenland, and I did, or Ireland, but there was more that convinced me it was here.It was written the maidens of Korkyra had hidden it, away from the mother of lies.Not much different from what I found, Riley said.And the timing?You, me, Sasha?It cements it.Id barely arrived, and like you, booked the hotel on impulse as I thought to rent a villa.For the quiet, the privacy, as Id need to work, and hotel rooms arent always ...convenient for certain work.When you make magick, Annika said, and made him smile.When I do.And so I walked out on the hotel terrace, annoyed with myself for changing my plans and direction.Imagine my surprise when I found myself lured over to two beautiful women, with fascinating stories to tell.So you teamed up, Doyle said.Id be the last to ignore power or turn away from the fates.And beyond the stories there were the sketches, Sashas brilliant sketches, which made it clear this was meant.Still, I felt it best to keep what Im telling you now to myself.He frowned at his beer, then shrugged.Others have been deceived by lovely faces, by fascinating stories, by the whiff of power and the promise of trust.So I bided some timeand it cant be said I bided long, can it?Temper flared around the edges of his tone as he looked over at Sasha.A bit of time to be more certain what I felt, what I knew was truth, and that meeting, that joining of forces was for the right of it.He paused, considered having another beer.So we piled ourselves into Rileys borrowed jeep and headed north and west, where I had always planned to go.And Riley, being enterprising and well connected, arranged this place for us.On the way back, after wed gone to get our things from the hotel, there was Sawyer, walking toward this place, on the side of the road.He opted for the beer.And there, he said to Sawyer, you come into it.Its a family thing for me, too.The story of the stars came down through my family.Im not much of a scholar, not like Riley here, so most of what I know is through those stories.And ...He scratched the back of his neck, frowned into the distance.Didnt tell us the whole of it either, did you?Bran asked.Not exactly.Its the sort of thing people dont buy into, and like you said, it hasnt been long since we teamed up.A psychics one thingI mean a lot of people buy into that.Hell, its an industry.No offense.None taken, Sasha assured him.But after today.Mutant bats from hell, evil gods, and, well, Bran, it might not seem so weird.Family deal again.An ancestor, back in maybenobodys exactly surethe fourteenth century.He was a sailor, and his ship went down in a storm.So hes drowning and, the story goes, he was rescued, pulled to shore by a mermaid.Doyle let out a short laugh, and Annika a gasp.Yeah, yeah, I know, but thats the story.He woke up, the only one of the crew to survive, on the rocky shore of some island in the North Sea.And the, uh, mermaid, shed gotten hurt saving him, cut up on the rocks, and too weak to swim.Dying.No, Annika breathed.He was pretty banged up himself, but he got some dry wood, some dry leaves, started a fire.He didnt know if he should try to get her all the way into the water, or if shed just drown, so he scouted up some plants, made a poultice for her cuts.Some of the supplies and pieces of the ship washed up, so he used what he could, built a kind of shelter, fed her what he could, took care of her.Did she get better?Yeah, happy ending.Happy endings are good.One night he woke up, and saw her swimming away.And he was alone.But this isnt happy, Annika objected.Wait for it.Days later, she came back, and he went out into the shallows to meet her.For the first time, she spoke.Shed taken him from the sea because it was his fate, and those who came after him, to look for the three stars.He would tell the story to his sons, and they to their sons until they were found and taken home.She gave him a gift, a compass, and said it would guide him.This, too, he would pass to his son, and his son to his, and down the line.Youve got the compass?Riley demanded.Yeah.He dug in his pocket, held it out on his palm, lifted off the protective cover.Nice piece.Mind?Riley took it, examined it.Bronze case, nice looking roseyouve kept it in good shape.Its old, but Id gauge it more seventeenth century.Yeah, but thats how the story came down.That doesnt explain why you came to Corfu, Doyle pointed out.Well, it will.He hitched up, took a plastic sleeve from his pocket, and carefully drew out the map folded inside.After pushing dishes aside, he unfolded the map on the table.Held out his hand, wiggled his fingers at Riley for the compass.One way or the other, its always accurate.He set the compass on the map.Within seconds the old brass casing glowed, and the rose began to shine.Then the compass slid over the map.Like a Ouija board, Riley said.No.Watching the movement, Bran shook his head.This doesnt open a door.It shows the way to one.Pretty much, and see?
