It faces a state of the art stainless steel  or maybe platinum for all I know   modern fireplace.The fire is lit and flaming gently.On the left beside us, by the entryway, is the kitchen area.All white with dark wood worktops and a large breakfast bar which seats six.Near the kitchen area, in front of the glass wall, is a dining table surrounded by sixteen chairs.And tucked in the corner is a full size, shiny black grand piano.Oh yes he probably plays the piano too.There is art of all shapes and sizes on all the walls.In fact, this apartment looks more like a gallery than a place to live.Can I take your jacket?Christian asks.I shake my head.Im still cold from the wind on the helipad.Would you like a drink?he asks.I blink at him.After last night!Is he trying to be funny?For one second, I think about asking for a margarita  but I dont have the nerve.Im going to have a glass of white wine, would you like to join me?Yes, please, I murmur.I am standing in this enormous room feeling out of place.I walk over to the glass wall, and I realize that the lower half of the wall opens concertina style on to the balcony.Seattle is lit up and lively in the background.I walk back to the kitchen area  it takes a few seconds, its so far from the glass wall  and Christian is opening a bottle of wine.Hes removed his jacket.Pouilly Fum okay with you?I know nothing about wine, Christian.Im sure it will be fine.My voice is soft and hesitant.My heart is thumping.I want to run.This is seriously rich.Seriously over the top Bill Gates style wealthy.What am I doing here?You know very well what youre doing here   my subconscious sneers at me.Yes, I want to be in Christian Greys bed.Here.He hands me a glass of wine.Even the glasses are rich heavy, contempo rary, crystal.I take a sip, and the wine is light, crisp, and delicious.Youre very quiet, and youre not even blushing.In fact  I think this is the palest Ive ever seen you, Anastasia, he murmurs.Are you hungry?I shake my head.Not for food.Its a very big place you have here.Big?Big.Its big, he agrees, and his eyes glow with amusement.I take another sip of wine.Do you play?I point my chin at the piano.Yes.Well?Yes.Of course you do.Is there anything you cant do well?Yes a few things.He takes a sip of his wine.He doesnt take his eyes off me.I feel them following me as I turn and glance around this vast room.Room is the wrong word.Its not a room  its a mission statement.Do you want to sit?I nod, and he takes my hand and leads me to the large off white couch.As I sit, Im struck by the fact that I feel like Tess Durbeyfield looking at the new house that belongs to the notorious Alec DUrberville.The thought makes me smile.Whats so amusing?He sits down beside me, turning to face me.He rests his head on his right hand, his elbow propped on the back of the couch.Why did you give me Tess of the DUrbervilles specifically?I ask.Christian stares at me for a moment.I think hes surprised by my question.Well, you said you liked Thomas Hardy.Is that the only reason?Even I can hear the disappointment in my voice.His mouth presses into a hard line.It seemed appropriate.I could hold you to some impossibly high ideal like Angel Clare or debase you completely like Alec DUrberville, he murmurs, and his gray eyes flash dark and dangerous.If there are only two choices, Ill take the debasement.I whisper, gazing at him.My subconscious is staring at me in awe.He gasps.Anastasia, stop biting your lip, please.Its very distracting.You dont know what youre saying.Thats why Im here.He frowns.Yes.Would you excuse me a moment?He disappears through a wide doorway on the far side of the room.Hes gone for a couple of minutes and returns with a document.This is a non disclosure agreement.He shrugs and has the grace to look a little embarrassed.My lawyer insists on it.He hands it to me.Im completely bemused.If youre going for option two, debasement, youll need to sign this.And if I dont want to sign anything?Then its Angel Clare high ideals, well, for most of the book anyway.What does this agreement mean?It means you cannot disclose anything about us.Anything, to anyone.I stare at him in disbelief.Holy shit.Its bad, really bad, and now Im very curious to know.Okay.Ill sign.He hands me a pen.Arent you even going to read it?No.He frowns.Anastasia, you should always read anything you sign, he admonishes me.Christian, what you fail to understand is that I wouldnt talk about us to anyone, anyway.Even Kate.So its immaterial whether I sign an agreement or not.If it means so much to you, or your lawyer whom you obviously talk to, then fine.Ill sign.He gazes down at me, and he nods gravely.Fair point well made, Miss Steele.I lavishly sign on the dotted line of both copies and hand one back to him.Folding the other, I place it my purse and take a large swig of my wine.Im sounding so much braver than Im actually feeling.Does this mean youre going to make love to me tonight, Christian?Holy shit.Did I just say that?His mouth drops open slightly, but he recovers quickly.No, Anastasia it doesnt.Firstly, I dont make love.I fuck hard.Secondly, theres a lot more paperwork to do, and thirdly, you dont yet know what youre in for.You could still run for the hills.Come, I want to show you my playroom.My mouth drops open.Fuck hard!Holy shit, that sounds so hot.But why are we looking at a playroom?I am mystified.You want to play on your Xbox?I ask.He laughs, loudly.No, Anastasia, no Xbox, no Playstation.Come.He stands, holding out his hand.I let him lead me back out to the corridor.On the right of the double doors, where we came in, another door leads to a staircase.We go up to the second floor and turn right.Producing a key from his pocket, he unlocks yet another door and takes a deep breath.You can leave anytime.The helicopter is on stand by to take you whenever you want to go, you can stay the night and go home in the morning.Its fine whatever you decide.Just open the damn door, Christian.He opens the door and stands back to let me in.I gaze at him once more.I so want to know whats in here.Taking a deep breath I walk in.And it feels like Ive time traveled back to the sixteenth century and the Spanish Inquisition.Holy fuck.The first thing I notice is the smell; leather, wood, polish with a faint citrus scent.Its very pleasant, and the lighting is soft, subtle.In fact, I cant see the source, but its around the cornice in the room, emitting an ambient glow.The walls and ceiling are a deep, dark bur gundy, giving a womb like effect to the spacious room, and the floor is old, old varnished wood.There is a large wooden cross like an X fastened to the wall facing the door.Its made of high polished mahogany, and there are restraining cuffs on each corner.Above it is an expansive iron grid suspended from the ceiling, eight foot square at least, and from it hang all manner of ropes, chains, and glinting shackles.By the door, two long, polished, ornately carved poles, like spindles from a banister but longer, hang like curtain rods across the wall.From them swing a startling assortment of paddles, whips, riding crops, and funny looking feathery implements.Beside the door stands a substantial mahogany chest of drawers, each drawer slim as if designed to contain specimens in a crusty old museum.I wonder briefly what the drawers actually do hold.Do I want to know?In the far corner is an oxblood leather padded bench, and fixed to the wall beside it is a wooden, polished rack that looks like a pool or billiard cue holder, but on closer inspection, it holds canes of varying lengths and widths.Theres a stout six foot long table in the opposite corner  polished wood with intricately carved legs  and two matching stools underneath.But what dominates the room is a bed.Its bigger than king size, an ornately carved rococo four poster with a flat top.It looks late nineteenth century.Under the canopy, I can see more gleaming chains and cuffs.There is no bedding...just a mattress covered in red leather and red satin cushions piled at one end.At the foot of the bed, set apart a few feet, is a large oxblood chesterfield couch, just stuck in the middle of the room facing the bed.An odd arrangement to have a couch facing the bed, and I smile to myself  Ive picked on the couch as odd, when really its the most mundane piece of furniture in the room.I glance up and stare at the ceiling.There are karabiners all over the ceiling at odd intervals.I vaguely wonder what theyre for.Weirdly, all the wood, dark walls, moody lighting, and oxblood leather makes the room kind of soft and romantic I know its anything but, this is Christians version of soft and romantic.I turn, and hes regarding me intently as I knew he would be, his expression completely unreadable.I walk further into the room, and he follows me.The feathery thing has me intrigued.I touch it hesitantly.Its suede, like a small cat of nine tails but bushier, and there are very small plastic beads on the end.Its called a flogger, Christians voice is quiet and soft.A flogger hmm.I think Im in shock.My subconscious has emigrated or been struck dumb or simply keeled over and expired.I am numb.I can observe and absorb but not articulate my feelings about all this, because Im in shock.What is the appropriate response to finding out a potential lover is a complete freaky sadist or masochist?Fear yes that seems to be the over riding feeling.I recognize it now.But weirdly not of him  I dont think hed hurt me, well, not without my consent.So many questions cloud my mind.Why?How?When?How often?Who?I walk toward the bed and run my hands down one of the intricately carved posts.The post is very sturdy, the craftsmanship outstanding.Say something, Christian commands, his voice deceptively soft.Do you do this to people or do they do it to you?His mouth quirks up, either amused or relieved.People?He blinks a couple of times as he considers his answer.I do this to women who want me to.I dont understand.If you have willing volunteers, why am I here?Because I want to do this with you, very much.Oh, I gasp.Why?I wander to the far corner of the room and pat the waist high padded bench and run my fingers over the leather.He likes to hurt women.The thought depresses me.Youre a sadist?Im a Dominant.His eyes are a scorching gray, intense.What does that mean?I whisper.It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself to me, in all things.I frown at him as I try to assimilate this idea.Why would I do that?To please me, he whispers as he cocks his head to one side, and I see a ghost of a smile.Please him!He wants me to please him!I think my mouth drops open.Please Christian Grey.And I realize, in that moment, that yes, thats exactly what I want to do.I want him to be damned delighted with me.Its a revelation.In very simple terms, I want you to want to please me, he says softly.His voice is hypnotic.How do I do that?My mouth is dry, and I wish I had more wine.Okay, I understand the pleasing bit, but I am puzzled by the soft boudoir Elizabethan torture set up.Do I want to know the answer?I have rules, and I want you to comply with them.They are for your benefit and for my pleasure.If you follow these rules to my satisfaction, I shall reward you.If you dont, I shall punish you, and you will learn, he whispers.I glance at the rack of canes as he says this .And where does all this fit in?I wave my hand in the general direction of the room.Its all part of the incentive package.Both reward and punishment.So youll get your kicks by exerting your will over me.Its about gaining your trust and your respect, so youll let me exert my will over you.I will gain a great deal of pleasure, joy, even in your submission.The more you submit, the greater my joy  its a very simple equation.Okay, and what do I get out of this?He shrugs and looks almost apologetic.Me, he says simply.Oh my.Christian rakes his hand through his hair as he gazes at me.Youre not giving anything away, Anastasia, he murmurs, exasperated.Lets go back downstairs where I can concentrate better.Its very distracting having you in here.He holds his hand out to me, and now Im hesitant to take it.Kate had said he was dangerous, she was so right.How did she know?Hes dangerous to my health, because I know Im going to say yes.And part of me doesnt want to.Part of me wants to run screaming from this room and all it represents.I am so out of my depth here.Im not going to hurt you, Anastasia.His gray eyes implore, and I know he speaks the truth.I take his hand, and he leads me out of the door.If you do this, let me show you.Rather than going back downstairs, he turns right out of the playroom, as he calls it, and down a corridor.We pass several doors until we reach the one at the end.Beyond it is a bedroom with a large double bed, all in white  everything, furniture, walls, bedding.Its sterile and cold but with the most glorious view of Seattle through the glass wall.This will be your room.You can decorate it how you like, have whatever you like in here.My room?Youre expecting me to move in?I cant hide the horror in my voice.Not full time.Just say, Friday evening through Sunday.We have to talk about all that, negotiate.If you want to do this, he adds, his voice quiet and hesitant.Ill sleep here?Yes.Not with you.No.I told you, I dont sleep with anyone, except you, when youre stupefied with drink.His eyes are reprimanding.My mouth presses in a hard line.This is what I cannot reconcile.Kind, caring Christian, who rescues me from inebriation and holds me gently while Im throwing up into the azaleas, and the monster who possesses whips and chains in a special room.Where do you sleep?My room is downstairs.Come, you must be hungry.Weirdly, I seem to have lost my appetite, I murmur petulantly.You must eat, Anastasia, he admonishes and, taking my hand, leads me back downstairs.Back in the impossibly big room, I am filled with deep trepidation.I am on the edge of a precipice, and I have to decide whether or not to jump.Im fully aware that this is a dark path Im leading you down, Anastasia, which is why I really want you to think about this.You must have some questions, he says as he wanders into the kitchen area, releasing my hand.I do.But where to start?Youve signed your NDA, you can ask me anything you want, and Ill answer.I stand at the breakfast bar watching him as he opens the refrigerator and pulls out a plate of different cheeses with two large bunches of green and red grapes.He sets the plate down on the worktop and proceeds to cut up a French baguette.Sit.He points to one of the bar stools at the breakfast bar, and I obey his command.If Im going to do this, Im going to have to get used to it.I realize hes been this bossy since I met him.You mentioned paperwork.Yes.What paperwork?Well, apart from the NDA, a contract saying what we will and wont do.I need to know your limits, and you need to know mine.This is consensual, Anastasia.And if I dont want to do this?Thats fine, he says carefully.But we wont have any sort of relationship?I ask.No.Why?This is the only sort of relationship Im interesting in.Why?He shrugs.Its the way I am.How did you become this way?Why is anyone the way they are?Thats kind of hard to answer.Why do some people like cheese and other people hate it?Do you like cheese?Mrs.Jones  my housekeeper   has left this for supper.He takes some large, white plates from a cupboard and places one in front of me.Were talking about cheese Holy crap.What are your rules that I have to follow?I have them written down.Well go through them once weve eaten.Food.How can I eat now?Im really not hungry, I whisper.You will eat, he says simply.Dominating Christian, it all becomes clear.Would you like another glass of wine?Yes, please.He pours wine into my glass and comes to sit beside me.I take a hasty sip.Help yourself to food, Anastasia.I take a small bunch of grapes.This I can manage.He narrows his eyes.Have you been like this for a while?I ask.Yes.Is it easy to find women who want to do this?He raises an eyebrow at me.Youd be amazed, he says dryly.Then why me?I really dont understand.Anastasia, Ive told you.Theres something about you.I cant leave you alone.He smiles ironically.Im like a moth to a flame.His voice darkens.I want you very badly, especially now, when youre biting your lip again.He takes a deep breath and swallows.My stomach somersaults  he wants me in a weird way, true, but this beautiful, strange, kinky man wants me.I think you have that clich the wrong way round.I grumble.I am the moth and he is the flame, and Im going to get burnt.I know.Eat!No.I havent signed anything yet, so I think Ill hang on to my free will for a bit longer, if thats okay with you.His eyes soften, and his lips turn up in a smile.As you wish, Miss Steele.How many women?I blurt out the question, but Im so curious.Fifteen.Oh not as many as I thought.For long periods of time?Some of them, yes.Have you ever hurt anyone?Yes.Holy shit.Badly?No.Will you hurt me?What do you mean?Physically, will you hurt me?I will punish you when you require it, and it will be painful.I think I feel a little faint.I take another sip of wine.Alcohol   this will make me brave.Have you ever been beaten?I ask.Yes.Oh that surprises me.Before I can question him on this revelation further, he interrupts my train of thought.Lets discuss this in my study.I want to show you something.This is so hard to process.Here I was foolishly thinking that Id spend a night of un paralleled passion in this mans bed, and were negotiating this weird arrangement.I follow him into his study, a spacious room with another floor to ceiling window that opens out on to the balcony.He sits on the desk, motions for me to sit on a leather chair in front of him, and hands me a piece of paper.These are the rules.They may be subject to change.They form part of the contract, which you can also have.Read these rules and lets discuss.RULES   Obedience:   The Submissive will obey any instructions given by

sure about accepting money for clothes.It feels wrong.I shift uncomfortably, the word ho rattling round my head.I want to lavish money on you, let me buy you some clothes.I may need you to accompany me to functions, and I want you dressed well.Im sure your salary, when you do get a job, wont cover the kind of clothes Id like you to wear.I dont have to wear them when Im not with you?No.Okay.Think of them as uniform.I dont want to exercise four times a week.Anastasia, I need you supple, strong, and with stamina.Trust me, you need to exercise.But surely not four times a week, how about three?I want you to do four.I thought this was a negotiation?He purses his lips at me.Okay, Miss Steele, another point well made.How about an hour on three days and one day half an hour?Three days, three hours.I get the impression youre going to keep me exercised when Im here.He smiles wickedly, and his eyes glow as if relieved.Yes, I am.Okay, agreed.Are you sure you dont want to intern at my company?Youre a good negotiator.No, I dont think thats a good idea.I stare down at his rules.Waxing!Waxing what?Everything?Ugh.So, limits.These are mine.He hands me another piece of paper.Hard Limits   No acts involving fire play   No acts involving urination or defecation and the products thereof No acts involving needles, knives, piercing, or blood No acts involving gynecological medical instruments  No acts involving children or animals  No acts that will leave any permanent marks on the skin No acts involving breath control  Ugh.He has to write these down!Of course  they all look very sensible, and frankly, necessary any sane person wouldnt want to be involved in this sort of thing surely?Though I now feel a little queasy.Is there anything youd like to add?he asks kindly.Crap.Ive no idea.I am completely stumped.He gazes at me and furrows his brow.Is there anything you wont do?I dont know.What do you mean you dont know?I squirm uncomfortably and bite my lip.Ive never done anything like this.Well, when youve had sex, was there anything that you didnt like doing?For the first time in what seems to be ages, I blush.You can tell me, Anastasia.We have to be honest with each other or this isnt going to work.I squirm uncomfortably again and stare at my knotted fingers.Tell me, he commands.Well Ive not had sex before, so I dont know.My voice is small.I peek up at him, and hes staring at me, mouth open, frozen, and pale   really pale.Never?he whispers.I shake my head.Youre a virgin?he breathes.I nod, flushing again.He closes his eyes and looks to be counting to ten.When he opens them again, hes angry, glaring at me.Why the fuck didnt you tell me?he growls.Christian is running both his hands through his hair and pacing up and down his study.Two hands  thats double exasperation.His usual concrete control seems to have slipped a notch.I dont understand why you didnt tell me, he castigates me.The subject never came up.Im not in the habit of revealing my sexual status to everyone I meet.I mean, we hardly know each other.Im staring at my hands.Why am I feeling guilty?Why is he so mad?I peek up at him.Well, you know a lot more about me now, he snaps, his mouth presses into a hard line.I knew you were inexperienced, but a virgin!He says it like its a really dirty word.Hell, Ana, I just showed you, he groans.May God forgive me.Have you ever been kissed, apart from by me?Of course I have.I try my best to look affronted.Okay maybe twice.And a nice young man hasnt swept you off your feet?I just dont understand.Youre twenty one, nearly twenty two.Youre beautiful.He runs his hand through his hair again.Beautiful.I flush with pleasure.Christian Grey thinks Im beautiful.I knot my fingers together, staring at them hard, trying to conceal my goofy grin.Perhaps hes near sighted, my subconscious has reared her somnambulant head.Where was she when I needed her?And youre seriously discussing what I want to do, when you have no experience.His brows knit together.How have you avoided sex?Tell me, please.I shrug.No ones really, you know.Come up to scratch, only you.And you turn out to be some kind of monster.Why are you so angry with me?I whisper.Im not angry with you, Im angry with myself.I just assumed  He sighs.He regards me shrewdly and then shakes his head.Do you want to go?he asks, his voice gentle.No, unless you want me to go, I murmur.Oh no I dont want to leave.Of course not.I like having you here.He frowns as he says this and then glances at his watch.Its late.And he turns to look at me.Youre biting your lip.His voice is husky, and hes eyeing me speculatively.Sorry.Dont apologize.Its just that I want to bite it too, hard.I gasp how can he say things like that to me and not expect me to be affected.Come, he murmurs.What?Were going to rectify the situation right now.What do you mean?What situation?Your situation.Ana, Im going to make love to you, now.Oh.The floor has fallen away .Im a situation.Im holding my breath.Thats if you want to, I mean, I dont want to push my luck.I thought you didnt make love.I thought you fucked hard.I swallow, my mouth suddenly dry.He gives me a wicked grin, the effects of which travel all the way down there.I can make an exception, or maybe combine the two, well see.I really want to make love to you.Please, come to bed with me.I want our arrangement to work, but you really need to have some idea what youre getting yourself into.We can start your training tonight  with the basics.This doesnt mean Ive come over all hearts and flowers, its a means to an end, but one that I want, and hopefully you do too.His gray gaze is intense.I flush oh my wishes do come true.But I havent done all the things you require from your list of rules.My voice is all breathy, hesitant.Forget about the rules.Forget about all those details for tonight.I want you.Ive wanted you since you fell into my office, and I know you want me.You wouldnt be sitting here calmly discussing punishment and hard limits if you didnt.Please, Ana, spend the night with me.He holds his hand out to me, his eyes are bright, fervent excited, and I put my hand in his.He pulls me up and into his arms so I can feel the length of his body against mine, this swift action taking me by surprise.He runs his fingers round the nape of my neck, winds my ponytail around his wrist, and gently pulls so Im forced to look up at him.He gazes down at me.You are one brave young woman, he whispers.I am in awe of you.His words are like some kind of incendiary device; my blood flames.He leans down and kisses my lips gently, and he sucks at my lower lip.I want to bite this lip, he murmurs against my mouth, and carefully he tugs at it with his teeth.I moan, and he smiles.Please Ana, let me make love to you.Yes, I whisper, because thats why Im here.His smile is triumphant as he releases me and takes my hand and leads me through the apartment.His bedroom is vast.The ceiling height windows look out on a lit up, high rise Seattle.The walls are white, and the furnishings are pale blue.The enormous bed is ultra modern, made of rough, grey wood, like driftwood, four posts, but no canopy.On the wall above it is a stunning painting of the sea.I am quaking like a leaf.This is it.Finally, after all this time, Im going to do it, with none other than Christian Grey.My breath is shallow, and I cant take my eyes off him.He removes his watch and places it on top of a chest of drawers that matches the bed, and removes his jacket, placing it on a chair.Hes dressed in his white linen shirt and jeans.He is heart stoppingly beautiful.His dark copper hair is a mess, his shirt hanging out  his gray eyes bold and dazzling.He steps out of his Converse shoes and reaches down and takes his socks off individually.Christian Greys feet wow what is it about naked feet?Turning, he gazes at me, his expression soft.I assume youre not on the pill.What!Shit.I didnt think so.He opens the top drawer of the chest and removes a packet of condoms.He gazes at me intently.Be prepared, he murmurs.Do you want the blinds drawn?I dont mind.I whisper.I thought you didnt let anyone sleep in your bed.Who says were going to sleep?he murmurs softly.Oh.Holy hell.He strolls slowly toward me.Confident, sexy, eyes blazing, and my heart begins to pound.My bloods pumping around my body.Desire, thick and hot, pools in my belly.He stands in front of me, staring down into my eyes.Hes so freaking hot.Lets get this jacket off, shall we?he says softly, and takes hold of the lapels and gently slides my jacket off my shoulders.He places it on the chair.Do you have any idea how much I want you, Ana Steele?he whispers.My breath hitches.I cannot take my eyes off his.He reaches up and gently runs his fingers down my cheek to my chin.Do you have any idea what Im going to do to you?he adds, caressing my chin.The muscles inside the deepest, darkest part of me clench in the most delicious fashion.The pain is so sweet and sharp I want to close my eyes, but Im hypnotized by his gray eyes staring fervently into mine.Leaning down, he kisses me.His lips are demanding, firm and slow, molding mine.He starts unbuttoning my shirt while he places feather like kisses across my jaw, my chin, and the corners of my mouth.Slowly he peels it off me and lets it fall to the floor.He stands back and gazes at me.Im in the pale blue lacy perfect fit bra.Thank heavens.Oh, Ana, he breathes.You have the most beautiful skin, pale and flawless.I want to kiss every single inch of it.I flush.Oh my Why did he say he couldnt make love?I will do anything he wants.He grasps my hair tie, pulls it free, and gasps as my hair cascades down around my shoulders.I like brunettes, he murmurs, and both of his hands are in my hair, grasping each side of my head.His kiss is demanding, his tongue and lips coaxing mine.I moan, and my tongue tentatively meets his.He puts his arms around me and hauls me against his body, squeezing me tightly.One hand remains in my hair, the other travels down my spine to my waist and down to my behind.His hand flexes over my backside and squeezes gently.He holds me against his hips, and I feel his erection, which he languidly pushes into me.I moan once more into his mouth.I can hardly contain the riotous feelings or is it hormones that rampage through my body.I want him so badly.Gripping his upper arms, I feel his biceps, hes surprisingly strong muscular.Tentatively, I move my hands up to his face and into his hair.Holy Moses.Its so soft, unruly.I tug gently, and he groans.He eases me toward the bed, until I feel it behind my knees.I think hes going to push me down on to it, but he doesnt.Releasing me, he suddenly drops to his knees.He grabs my hips with both his hands and runs his tongue around my navel, then gently nips his way to my hipbone, then across my belly to my other hipbone.Ah, I groan.Seeing him on his knees in front of me, feeling his mouth on me, its so unexpected,, and hot.My hands stay in his hair, pulling gently as I try to quiet my too loud breathing.He gazes up at me through impossibly long lashes, his eyes a scorching smoky gray.His hands reach up and undo the button on my jeans, and he leisurely pulls down the zipper.Without taking his eyes off mine, his hands move beneath the waistband, skimming me and moving to my behind.His hands glide slowly down my backside to my thighs, removing my jeans as they go.I cannot look away.He stops and licks his lips, never breaking eye contact.He leans forward, running his nose up the apex between my thighs.I feel him.There.You smell so good, he murmurs and closes his eyes, a look of pure pleasure on his face, and I practically convulse.He reaches up and tugs the duvet off the bed, then pushes me gently so I fall on to the mattress.Still kneeling, he grasps my foot and undoes my Converse, pulling off my shoe and sock.I raise myself up on my elbows to see what hes doing.Im panting wanting.He lifts my foot by the heel and runs his thumbnail up my instep.Its almost painful, but I feel the movement echoed in my groin.I gasp.Not taking his eyes off mine, again he runs his tongue along my instep and then his teeth.Shit.I groan how can I feel this, there.I fall back on to the bed, moaning.I hear his soft chuckle.Oh, Ana, what I could do to you, he whispers.He removes my other shoe and sock, then stands and removes my jeans.Im lying on his bed dressed only in my bra and panties, and hes staring down at me.Youre very beautiful, Anastasia Steele.I cant wait to be inside you.Holy shit.His words.Hes so seductive.He takes my breath away.Show me how you pleasure yourself.What?I frown.Dont be coy, Ana, show me, he whispers.I shake my head.I dont know what you mean.My voice is hoarse.I hardly recognize it, laced with desire.How do you make yourself come?I want to see.I shake my head.I dont, I mumble.He raises his eyebrows, astonished for a moment, and his eyes darken, and he shakes his head in disbelief.Well, well have to see what we can do about that.His voice is soft, challenging, a delicious sensual threat.He undoes the buttons of his jeans and slowly pulls his jeans down, his eyes on mine the whole time.He leans down over me and, grasping each of my ankles, quickly jerks my legs apart and crawls onto the bed between my legs.He hovers over me.I am squirming with need.Keep still, he murmurs, and then he leans down and kisses the inside of my thigh, trailing kisses up, over the thin lacy material of my panties, kissing me.Oh I cant keep still.How can I not move?I wriggle beneath him.Were going to have to work on keeping you still, baby.He trails kisses up my belly, and his tongue dips into my navel.Still hes heading north, kissing me across my torso.My skin is burning.Im flushed, too hot, too cold, and Im clawing at the sheet beneath me.He lay down beside me, and his hand trails up from my hip, to my waist, and up to my breast.He gazes down at me, his expression unreadable, and gently cups my breast.You fit my hand perfectly, Anastasia, he murmurs and dips his index finger into the cup of my bra and gently yanks it down freeing my breast, but the under wire and fabric of the cup force it upward.His finger moves to my other breast and repeats the process.My breasts swell, and my nipples harden under his steady gaze.I am trussed up by my own bra.Very nice, he whispers appreciatively, and my nipples harden even more.He blows very gently on one as his hand moves to my other breast, and his thumb slowly rolls the end of my nipple, elongating it.I groan, feeling the sweet sensation all the way to my groin.I am so wet .Oh please, I beg internally as my fingers clasp the sheet tighter.His lips close around my other nipple and he tugs, I nearly convulse.Lets see if we can make you come like this, he whispers, continuing his slow, sensual assault.My nipples bear the delicious brunt of his deft fingers and lips, setting alight every single nerve ending in my body so that my whole body sings with the sweet agony.He just doesnt stop.Oh please, I beg, and I pull my head back, my mouth open as I groan, my legs stiffening.Holy hell, whats happening to me?Let go, baby, he murmurs.His teeth close round my nipple, and his thumb and finger pull hard, and I fall apart in his hands, my body convulsing and shattering into a thousand pieces.He kisses me, deeply, his tongue in my mouth absorbing my cries.Oh my.That was extraordinary.Now I know what all the fuss is about.He gazes down at me, a satisfied smile on his face, while Im sure theres nothing but gratitude and awe on mine.You are very responsive, he breathes.Youre going to have to learn to control that, and its going to be so much fun teaching you how.He kisses me again.My breathing is still ragged as I come down from my orgasm.His hand moves down my waist, to my hips, and then cups me, intimately...Jeez.His finger slips through the fine lace and slowly circles around me  there.Briefly he closes his eyes, and his breathing hitches.Youre so deliciously wet.God, I want you.He thrusts his finger inside me, and I cry out as he does it again and again.He palms my clitoris, and I cry out once more.He pushes inside me harder and harder still.I groan.Suddenly, he sits up and tugs my panties off and throws them on the floor.Pulling off his boxer briefs, his erection springs free.Holy cow He reaches over to his bedside table and grabs a foil packet, and then he moves between my legs, spreading them further apart.He kneels up and pulls a condom on to his considerable length.Oh noWill it?How?Dont worry, he breathes, his eyes on mine, You expand too.He leans down, his hands on either side of my head, so hes hovering over me, staring down into my eyes, his jaw clenched, eyes burning.Its only now that I register hes still wearing his shirt.You really want to do this?he asks softly.Please, I beg.Pull your knees up, he orders softly, and Im quick to obey.Im going to fuck you now, Miss Steele, he murmurs as he positions the head of his erection at the entrance of my sex.Hard, he whispers, and he slams into me.Aargh!I cry as I feel a weird pinching sensation deep inside me as he rips through my virginity.He stills, gazing down at me, his eyes bright with ecstatic triumph.His mouth is open slightly, and his breathing is harsh.He groans.Youre so tight.You okay?I nod, my eyes wide, my hands on his forearms.I feel so full.He stays still, letting me acclimatize to the intrusive, overwhelming feeling of him inside me.Im going to move, baby, he breathes after a moment, his voice tight.Oh.He eases back with exquisite slowness.And he closes his eyes and groans, and thrusts into me again.I cry out a second time, and he stills.More?he whispers, his voice raw.Yes, I breathe.He does it once more, and stills again.I groan.My body accepting him Oh, I want this.Again?he breathes.Yes.Its a plea.And he moves, but this time he doesnt stop.He shifts onto his elbows so I can feel his weight on me, holding me down.He moves slowly at first, easing himself in and out of me.And as I grow accustomed to the alien feeling, my hips move tentatively to meet his.He speeds up.I moan, and he pounds on, picking up speed, merciless, a relentless rhythm, and I keep up, meeting his thrusts.He grasps my head between his hands and kisses me hard, his teeth pulling at my lower lip again.He shifts slightly, and I can feel something building deep inside me, like before.I start to stiffen as he thrusts on and on.My body quivers, bows, a sheen of sweat gathers over me .Oh my I didnt know it would feel like this didnt know it could feel as good as this.My thoughts are scattering...theres only sensation...only him...only me oh please I stiffen.Come for me, Ana, he whispers breathlessly, and I unravel at his words, exploding around him as I climax and splinter into a million pieces underneath him.And as he comes, he calls out my name, thrusting hard, then stilling as he empties himself into me.I am still panting, trying to slow my breathing, my thumping heart, and my thoughts are in riotous disarray.Wow that was astounding.I open my eyes, and he has his forehead pressed against mine, his eyes closed, his breathing ragged.Christians eyes flicker open and gaze down at me, dark but soft.Hes still inside me.Leaning down, he gently presses a kiss against my forehead then slowly pulls out of me.Ooh.I wince at the unfamiliarity.Did I hurt you?Christian asks as he lies down beside me propped on one elbow.He tucks a stray strand of my hair behind my ear.And I have to grin, widely.You are asking me if you hurt me?The irony is not lost on me, he smiles sardonically.Seriously, are you okay?His eyes are intense, probing, demanding even.I stretch out beside him, feeling loose limbed, my bones like jelly, but Im relaxed, deeply relaxed.I grin at him.I cant stop grinning.Now I know what all the fuss is about.Two orgasms coming apart at the seams, like the spin cycle on a washing machine, wow.I had no idea what my body was capable of, could be wound so tightly and released so violently, so gratifyingly.The pleasure was indescribable.Youre biting your lip, and you havent answered me.Hes frowning.I grin up at him impishly.He looks glorious with his tousled hair, burning narrowed gray eyes, and serious, dark expression.Id like to do that again, I whisper.For a moment, I think I see a fleeting look of relief on his face, before the shutters come down, and he gazes at me through hooded eyes.Would you now, Miss Steele?he murmurs dryly.He leans down and kisses me very gently at the corner of my mouth.Demanding little thing arent you.Turn on your front.I blink at him momentarily, and then I turn over.He unhooks my bra and runs his hand down my back to my behind.You really have the most beautiful skin, he murmurs.He shifts so that one of his legs pushes between mine, and hes half lying across my back.I can feel the buttons of his shirt pressing into me as he gathers my hair off my face and kisses my bare shoulder.Why are you wearing your shirt?I ask.He stills.After a beat, he shuffles out of his shirt, and he lies back down on me.I feel his warm skin against mine.Hmm it feels heavenly.He has a light dusting of hair across his chest, which tickles my back.So you want me to fuck you again?he whispers in my ear, and he begins to trail feather light kisses around my ear and down my neck.His hand moves down, skimming my waist, over my hip, and down my thigh to the back of my knee.He pushes my knee up higher, and my breath hitches oh my, whats he doing now?He shifts so hes between my legs, pressed against my back, and his hand travels up my thigh to my behind.He caresses my cheek slowly, and then trails his fingers down between my legs.Im going to take you from behind, Anastasia, he murmurs, and with his other hand, he grasps my hair at the nape in a fist and pulls gently, holding me in place.I cannot move my head.I am pinioned beneath him, helpless.You are mine, he whispers.Only mine.Dont forget it.His voice is intoxicating, his words heady, seductive.I feel his growing erection against my thigh.His long fingers reach round to gently massage my clitoris, circling slowly.His breath is soft against my face as he slowly nips me along my jaw.You smell divine, he nuzzles behind my ear.His hand rubs against me, round and round.Reflexively, my hips start to circle, mirroring his hand, as excruciating pleasure spikes through my blood like adrenaline.Keep still, he orders, his voice soft but urgent, and slowly he inserts his thumb inside me, rotating it round and round, stroking the front wall of my vagina.The effect is mind blowing  all my energy concentrating on this one small space inside my body.I moan.You like this?he asks softly, his teeth grazing my outer ear, and he starts to flex his thumb slowly, in, out, in, out his fingers still circling.I close my eyes, trying to keep my breathing under control, trying to absorb the disordered, chaotic sensations that his fingers are unleashing on me, fire coursing through my body.I moan again.Youre so wet, so quickly.So responsive.Oh, Anastasia, I like that.I like that a lot,  he whispers.I want to stiffen my legs, but I cant move.Hes pinning me down, keeping up a constant, slow, tortuous rhythm.Its absolutely exquisite.I moan again, and he moves suddenly.Open your mouth, he commands and thrusts his thumb in my mouth.My eyes fly open, blinking wildly.See how you taste, he breathes against my ear.Suck me, baby.His thumb presses on my tongue, and my mouth closes round him, sucking wildly.I taste the saltiness on his thumb and the faint metallic tang of blood .Holy fuck.This is wrong, but holy hell is it erotic.I want to fuck your mouth, Anastasia, and I will soon, his voice is hoarse, raw, his breathing more disjointed.Fuck my mouth!I moan, and I bite down on him.He gasps, and he pulls my hair tighter, painfully, so I release him.Naughty, sweet girl, he whispers, and then reaches over to the bedside table for a foil packet.Stay still, dont move, he orders as he releases my hair.He rips the foil while Im breathing hard, my blood singing in my veins.The anticipation is exhilarating.He leans down, his weight on me again, and he grabs my hair holding my head immobile.I cannot move.Im enticingly ensnared by him, and hes poised and ready to take me once more.Were going to go real, slow this time, Anastasia, he breathes.And slowly he eases into me, slowly, slowly, until hes buried in me.Stretching, filling, relentless.I groan loudly.It feels deeper this time, delectable.I groan again, and he deliberately circles his hips and pulls back, pauses a beat, and then eases his way back in.He repeats this motion again and again.Its driving me insane  his teasing, deliberately slow thrusts, and the intermittent feeling of fullness is overwhelming.You feel so good, he groans, and my insides start to quiver.He pulls back and waits.Oh no, baby, not yet, he murmurs, and as the quivering ceases, he starts the whole delicious process again.Oh, please, I beg.Im not sure I can take much more.My body is wound so tight, craving release.I want you sore, baby, he murmurs, and he continues his sweet, leisurely torment, backward, forward.Every time you move tomorrow, I want you to be reminded that Ive been here.Only me.You are mine.I groan.Please, Christian, I whisper.What do you want, Anastasia?Tell me.I groan again.He pulls out and moves slowly back into me, circling his hips once more.Tell me, he murmurs.You, please.He increases the rhythm infinitesimally, and his breathing becomes more erratic.My insides start quickening, and Christian picks up the rhythm.You.Are.So.Sweet, he murmurs between each thrust.I.  Want.You.So.Much.I moan.You.Are.Mine.Come for me, baby, he growls.His words are my undoing, tipping me over the precipice.My body convulses around him, and I come, loudly calling out a garbled version of his name into the mattress, and Christian follows with two sharp thrusts, and he freezes, pouring himself into me as he finds his release.He collapses on top of me, his face in my hair.Fuck.Ana, he breathes.He pulls out of me immediately and rolls onto his side of the bed.I pull my knees up to my chest, utterly spent, and immediately drift off or pass out into an exhausted sleep.When I wake, its still dark.I have no idea how long Ive slept.I stretch out beneath the duvet, and I feel sore, deliciously sore.Christian is nowhere to be seen.I sit up, staring out at the cityscape in front of me.There are fewer lights on amongst the skyscrapers, and theres a whisper of dawn in the east.I hear the music.The lilting notes of the piano, a sad, sweet lament.Bach, I think, but Im not sure.I wrap the duvet round me and quietly pad down the corridor toward the big room.Christian is at the piano, completely lost in the music hes playing.His expression is sad and forlorn, like the music.His playing is stunning.Leaning against the wall at the entrance, I listen enraptured.Hes such an accomplished musician.He sits naked, his body bathed in the warm light cast by a solitary freestanding lamp beside the piano.With the rest of the large room in darkness, its like hes in his own isolated little pool of light, untouch able lonely, in a bubble.I pad quietly toward him, enticed by the sublime, melancholy music.Im mesmerized watching his long skilled fingers as they find and gently press the keys, thinking how those same fingers have expertly handled and caressed my body.I flush and gasp at the memory and press my thighs together.He glances up, his unfathomable gray eyes bright, his expression unreadable.Sorry, I whisper.I didnt mean to disturb you.A frown flits across his face.Surely, I should be saying that to you, he murmurs.He finishes playing and puts his hands on his legs.I notice now that hes wearing PJ pants.He runs his fingers through his hair and stands.His pants hang from his hips, in that way oh my.My mouth goes dry as he casually strolls around the piano toward me.He has broad shoulders, narrow hips, and his abdomi nal muscles ripple as he walks.He really is stunning.You should be in bed, he admonishes.That was a beautiful piece.Bach?Transcription by Bach, but its originally an oboe concerto by Alessandro Marcello.It was exquisite, but very sad, such a melancholy melody.His lips quirk up in a half smile.Bed, he orders.Youll be exhausted in the morning.I woke and you werent there.I find it difficult to sleep, and Im not used to sleeping with anyone, he murmurs.I cant fathom his mood.He seems a little despondent, but its difficult to tell in the darkness.Perhaps it was the tone of the piece he was playing.He puts his arm around me and gently walks me back to the bedroom.How long have you been playing?You play beautifully.Since I was six.Oh.Christian as a six year old boy my mind conjures an image of a beautiful, copper haired little boy with gray eyes and my heart melts  a moppet haired kid who likes impossibly sad music.How are you feeling?he asks when we are back in the room.He switches on a sidelight.Im good.We both glance down at the bed at the same time.Theres blood on the sheets  evidence of my lost virginity.I flush, embarrassed, pulling the duvet tighter around me.Well, thats going to give Mrs.Jones something to think about, Christian mutters as he stands in front of me.He puts his hand under my chin and tips my head back, staring down at me.His eyes are intense as he examines my face.I realize that Ive not seen his naked chest before.Instinctively, I reach out to run my fingers through the smattering of dark hair on his chest to see how it feels.Immediately, he steps back out of my reach.Get into bed, he says sharply.Ill come and lie down with you.His voice softens.I drop my hand and frown.I dont think Ive ever touched his torso.He opens a chest of drawers and pulls out a t shirt and quickly slips it on.Bed, he orders again.I climb back onto the bed, trying not to think about the blood.He clambers in beside me and pulls me into his embrace, wrapping his arms around me so that Im facing away from him.He kisses my hair gently, and he inhales deeply.Sleep, sweet Anastasia, he murmurs, and I close my eyes, but I cant help feel a re sidual melancholy either from the music or his demeanor.Christian Grey has a sad side.Light fills the room, coaxing me from deep sleep to wakefulness.I stretch out and open my eyes.Its a beautiful May morning, Seattle at my feet.Wow, what a view.Beside me, Christian Grey is fast asleep.Wow, what a view.Im surprised hes still in bed.Hes facing me, and I have an unprecedented opportunity to study him.His lovely face looks younger, relaxed in sleep.His sculptured, pouty lips are parted slightly, and his shiny, clean hair is a glorious mess.How could anyone look this good and still be legal?I remember his room upstairs perhaps hes not legal.I shake my head, so much to think about.Its tempting to reach out and touch him, but like a small child, hes so lovely when hes asleep.I dont have to worry about what Im saying, what hes saying, what plans he has, especially his plans for me.I could gaze at him all day, but I have needs  bathroom needs.Slipping out of bed, I find his white shirt on the floor and shrug it on.I walk through a door thinking that it might be the bathroom, but Im in a vast walk in closet as big as my bedroom.Lines and lines of expensive suits, shirts, shoes, and ties.How can anyone need this many clothes?I tut with disapproval.Actually, Kates wardrobe probably rivals this.Kate!Oh no.I didnt think about her all evening.I was supposed to text her.Crap.Im going to be in trouble.I wonder briefly how shes getting on with Elliot.Returning to the bedroom, Christian is still asleep.I try the other door.Its the bathroom, and its bigger than my bedroom.Why does one man need so much space?Two sinks, I notice with irony.Given he doesnt sleep with anyone, one of them cant have been used.I stare at myself in the gigantic mirror above the sinks.Do I look different?I feel different.I feel a little sore, if Im honest, and my muscles   jeez its like Ive never done any exercise in my life.You dont do any exercise in your life, my subconscious has woken.Shes staring at me with pursed lips, tapping her foot.So youve just slept with him, given him your virginity, a man who doesnt love you.In fact, he has very odd ideas about you, wants to make you some sort of kinky sex slave.ARE YOU CRAZY?Shes shouting at me.I wince as I look in the mirror.I am going to have to process all this.Honestly, fancy falling for a man whos beyond beautiful, richer than Croesus, and has a Red Room of Pain waiting for me.I shudder.Im bewildered and confused.My hair is its usual wayward self.Just fucked hair doesnt suit me.I try and bring order to the chaos with my fingers but fail miserably and give up  maybe Ill find hair ties in my purse.Im starving.I head back out to the bedroom.Sleeping beauty is still sleeping, so I leave him and head for the kitchen.Oh no Kate.I left my purse in Christians study.I fetch it and reach for my cell phone.Three texts.*RU OK Ana*  *Where RU Ana*  *Damn it Ana*  I call Kate.When she doesnt answer, I leave her a groveling message to tell her I am alive and have not succumbed to Bluebeard, well not in the sense she would be worried about  or perhaps I have.Oh this is so confusing.I have to try and categorize and analyze my feelings for Christian Grey.Its an impossible task.I shake my head in defeat.I need alone time, away from here to think.I find two welcome hair ties at the same time in my bag and quickly tie my hair in pigtails.Yes!The more girly I look, perhaps the safer Ill be from Bluebeard.I take my iPod out of the bag and plug my headphones in.Theres nothing like music to cook by.I slip it into the breast pocket of Christians shirt, turn it up loud, and start dancing.Holy hell, Im hungry.I am daunted by his kitchen.Its so sleek and modern and none of the cupboards have handles.It takes me a few seconds to deduce that I have to push the cupboard doors to open them.Perhaps I should cook Christian breakfast.He was eating an omelet the other day um, yesterday at the Heathman.Jeez, so much has happened since then.I check in the fridge, where there are plenty of eggs, and decide I want pancakes and bacon.I set about making some batter, dancing my way round the kitchen.Being busy is good.It allows a bit of time to think but not too deeply.Music blaring in my ears also helps to stave off deep thought.I came here to spend the night in Christian Greys bed, and managed it, even though he doesnt let anyone in his bed.I smile, mission accomplished.Big time.I grin.Big, big time, and Im distracted by the memory of last night.His words, his body, his lovemaking I close my eyes as my body hums at the recollection, and my muscles contract deliciously deep in my belly.My subconscious scowls at me fucking  not lovemaking  she screams at me like a harpy .I ignore her, but deep down I know she has a point.I shake my head to concentrate on the task at hand.There is a state of the art range.I think I have the hang of it.I need somewhere to keep the pancakes warm, and I start on the bacon.Amy Studt is singing in my ear about misfits.This song used to mean so much to me, thats because Im a misfit.I have never fitted in anywhere and now I have an indecent proposal to consider from King Misfit himself.Why is he this way?Nature or Nurture?Its so alien to anything I know.I put the bacon under the grill, and while its cooking, I whisk some eggs.I turn, and Christian is sitting on one of the bar stools at the breakfast bar, leaning on it, his face supported by his steepled hands.Hes still wearing the t shirt hes slept in.Just fucked hair really, really suits him, as does his designer stubble.He looks both amused and bewildered.I freeze, flush, then gather myself and pull the headphones out of my ears, my knees weak at the sight of him.Good morning, Miss Steele.Youre very energetic this morning, he says dryly.I slept well, I stutter my explanation.His lips try to mask his smile.I cant imagine why.He pauses and frowns.So did I, after I came back to bed.Are you hungry?Very, he says with an intense look, and I dont think hes referring to food.Pancakes, bacon, and eggs?Sounds great.I dont know where you keep your placemats.I shrug, trying desperately hard not to look flustered.Ill do that.You cook.Would you like me to put some music on so you can continue your err dancing?I stare down at my fingers, knowing that I am turning puce.Please, dont stop on my account.Its very entertaining.His tone is one of wry amusement.I purse my lips.Entertaining eh?My subconscious has doubled over in laughter at me.I turn and continue to whisk the eggs, probably beating them a little harder than they need.In a moment, hes beside me.He gently pulls my pigtail.I love these, he whispers.They wont protect you.Hmm Bluebeard  How would you like your eggs?I ask tartly.He smiles.Thoroughly whisked and beaten, he smirks.I turn back to the task at hand, trying to hide my smile.Hes hard to stay mad at.Especially when hes being so uncharacteristically playful.He opens a drawer and takes out two black slate placemats for the breakfast bar.I pour the egg mix into a pan, pull out the bacon and turn it over, and put it back under the grill.When I turn back round, there is orange juice on the table, and hes making coffee.Would you like some tea?Yes, please.If you have some.I find a couple of plates and place them in the warming tray of the range.Christian reaches into a cupboard and pulls out some Twinings English Breakfast tea.I purse my lips.Bit of a foregone conclusion wasnt I?Are you?Im not sure weve concluded anything yet, Miss Steele, he murmurs.What does he mean by that?Our negotiations?Our, err relationship whatever that is?Hes still so cryptic.I serve up the breakfast onto the heated plates and lay them on the placemats.I hunt in the refrigerator and find some maple syrup.I glance up at Christian, and hes waiting for me to sit down.Miss Steele.He motions to one of the bar stools.Mr.Grey.I nod in acknowledgement.I climb up and wince slightly as I sit down.Just how sore are you?he asks as he sits down.His gray eyes dark.I flush.Why does he ask such personal questions?Well, to be truthful, I have nothing to compare this to, I snap at him.Did you wish to offer your commiserations?I ask too sweetly.I think hes trying to stifle a smile, but I cant be sure.No.I wondered if we should continue your basic training.Oh.I stare at him dumbfounded as I stop breathing and everything inside me clenches tight.Ooh thats so nice.I suppress my groan.Eat, Anastasia.My appetite has become uncertain again more more sex yes please.This is delicious, incidentally.He grins at me.I try a forkful of omelet but can barely taste it.Basic training!I want to fuck your mouth.Does that form part of basic training?Stop biting your lip.Its very distracting, and I happen to know youre not wearing anything under my shirt which makes it even more distracting, he growls.I dunk my teabag in the small pot that Christian has provided.My mind is in a whirl.What sort of basic training did you have in mind?I ask, my voice slightly too high, betraying my wish to sound as natural, disinterested, and calm as I can with my hormones wreaking havoc through my body.Well, as youre sore, I thought we could stick to oral skills.I choke on my tea, and I stare at him, eyes wide and gaping.He pats me gently on the back and passes me some orange juice.I cannot tell what hes thinking.Thats if you want to stay, he adds.I glance up at him, trying to recover my equilibrium.His expression is unreadable.Its so frustrating.Id like to stay for today.If thats okay.I have to work tomorrow.What time do you have to be at work tomorrow?Nine.Ill get you to work by nine tomorrow.I frown.Does he want me to stay another night?Ill need to go home tonight  I need clean clothes.We can get you some here.I dont have spare cash to spend on clothes.His hand comes up, and he grasps my chin, tugging it so my lip is released from the grip of my teeth.Im not even aware Ive been biting my lip.What is it?he asks.I need to be home this evening.His mouth is a hard line.Okay, this evening, he acquiesces.Now eat your breakfast.My thoughts and my stomach are in turmoil.My appetite has vanished.I stare at my half eaten breakfast.Im just not hungry.Eat, Anastasia.You didnt eat last night.Im really not hungry, I whisper.His eyes narrow.I would really like you to finish your breakfast.What is it with you and food?I blurt.His brow knits.I told you, I have issues with wasted food.Eat, he snaps.His eyes are dark, pained.Holy Crap.What is that all about?I pick up my fork and eat slowly, trying to chew.I must remember not to put so much on my plate if hes going to be weird about food.His expression softens as I carefully make my way through my breakfast.I note that he cleans his plate.He waits for me to finish, and then he clears my plate.You cooked, Ill clear.Thats very democratic.Yes.He frowns.Not my usual style.After Ive done this, well take a bath.Oh, okay.Oh my Id much rather have a shower.My cell rings, interrupting my reverie.Its Kate.Hi.I wander over to the glass doors of the balcony, away from him.Ana, why didnt you text last night?Shes angry.Im sorry, I was overtaken by events.Youre okay?Yes, Im fine.Did you?Shes fishing for information.I roll my eyes at the expectation in her voice.Kate, I dont want to talk over the phone.Christian glances up at me.You did I can tell.How can she tell?Shes bluffing, and I cant talk about this.Ive signed a damned agreement.Kate, please.What was it like?Are you okay?Ive told you Im okay.Was he gentle?Kate, please!I cant hide my exasperation.Ana, dont hold out on me, Ive been waiting for this day for nearly four years.Ill see you this evening.I hang up.That is going to be one difficult square to circle.Shes so tenacious, and she wants to know  in detail, and I cant tell her because Ive signed a  what was it called?NDA.Shell freak and rightly so.I need a plan.I head back to watch Christian move gracefully around his kitchen.The NDA, does it cover everything?I ask tentatively.Why?he turns and gazes at me while putting the Twinings away.I flush.Well, I have a few questions, you know, about sex.I stare down at my fingers.And Id like to ask Kate.You can ask me.Christian, with all due respect.My voice fades.I cant ask you.Ill get your biased, kinky as hell, distorted world view regarding sex.I want an impartial opinion.Its just about mechanics.I wont mention the Red Room of Pain.He raises his eyebrows.Red Room of Pain?Its mostly about pleasure, Anastasia.Believe me, he says.Besides, his tone is harsher.Your room mate is making the beast with two backs with my brother.Id really rather you didnt.Does your family know about your um predilection?No.Its none of their business.He saunters toward me until hes standing in front of me.What do you want to know?he asks, and raising his hand runs his fingers gently down my cheek to my chin, tilting my head back so he can look directly into my eyes.I squirm inwardly.I cannot lie to this man.Nothing specific at the moment, I whisper.Well, we can start with  how was last night for you?His eyes burn, filled with curiosity.Hes anxious to know.Wow.Good, I murmur.His lips lift slightly.Me too, he murmurs.Ive never had vanilla sex before.Theres a lot to be said for it.But then, maybe its because its with you.He runs his thumb across my lower lip.I inhale sharply.Vanilla sex?Come, lets have a bath.He leans down and kisses me.My heart leaps and desire pools way down low way down there.The bath is a white stone, deep, egg shaped affair, very designer.Christian leans over and fills it from the faucet on the tiled wall.He pours some expensive looking bath oil into the water.It foams as the bath fills and smells of sweet sultry Jasmine.He stands and gazes at me, his eyes dark, then peels his t shirt off and casts it on the floor.Miss Steele.He holds his hand out.Im standing in the doorway, wide eyed and wary, my arms wrapped around myself.I step forward while surreptitiously admiring his physique.He is just yummy.My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head.I take his hand, and he bids me to step into the bath while I am still wearing his shirt.I do as Im told.Ill have to get used to it if Im going to take him up on his outrageous offer if!The water is enticingly hot.Turn around, face me, he orders, his voice soft.I do as Im bid.Hes watching me intently.I know that lip is delicious, I can attest to that, but will you stop biting it?he says through clenched teeth.You chewing it makes me want to fuck you, and youre sore, okay?I gasp, automatically unlocking my lip, shocked.Yeah, he challenges.Got the picture.He glares at me.I nod frantically .I had no idea I could affect him so.Good.He reaches forward and takes my iPod out of the breast pocket, and he puts it by the sink.Water and iPods  not a clever combination, he mutters.He reaches down, grasps the hem of my white shirt, lifts it above my head, and discards it on the floor.He stands back to gaze at me.Im naked for heavens sake.I flush crimson and stare down at my hands, level with the base of my belly, and I desperately want to disappear into the hot water and foam, but I know he wont want that.Hey, he summons me.I peek up at him, and his head is cocked to one side.Anastasia, youre a very beautiful woman, the whole package.Dont hang your head like youre ashamed.You have nothing to be ashamed of, and its a real joy to stand here and gaze at you.He takes my chin in his hand and tilts my head up to reach his eyes.They are soft and warm, heated even.Oh my.Hes so close.I could just reach up and touch him.You can sit down now.He halts my scattered thoughts, and I scoot down into the warm, welcoming water.Ooh it stings.Which takes me by surprise, but it smells heavenly too, and the initial smarting pain soon ebbs away.I lie back and briefly close my eyes, relaxing in the soothing warmth.When I open them, he is gazing down at me.Why dont you join me?I ask, bravely I think  my voice husky.I think I will.Move forward, he orders.He strips out of his PJ pants and climbs in behind me.The water rises as he sits and pulls me against his chest.He places his long legs over mine, his knees bent and his ankles level with mine, and he pulls his feet apart, opening my legs.I gasp in surprise.His nose is in my hair and he inhales deeply.You smell so good, Anastasia.A tremor runs through my whole body.I am naked, in a bath with Christian Grey.Hes naked.If someone had told me Id be doing this when I woke up in his hotel suite yesterday, I would not have believed them.He reaches for a bottle of body wash from the built in shelf beside the bath and squirts some into his hand.He rubs his hands together, creating a soft, foaming lather, and he closes his hands around my neck and starts to rub the soap into my neck and shoulders, massaging firmly with his long, strong fingers.I groan.His hands on me feel good.You like that?I hear his smile.Hmm.He moves down my arms, then under them to my underarms washing gently.Im so glad Kate insisted I shave.His hands glide across to my breasts, and I inhale sharply as his fingers encircle them and start kneading gently, taking no prisoners.My body bows instinctively, pushing my breasts into his hands.My nipples are tender.Very tender, no doubt from his less than delicate treatment of them last night.He doesnt linger long and glides his hands down to my stomach and belly.My breathing increases, and my heart is racing.His growing erection presses against my behind.Its such a turn on knowing that its my body making him feel this way.Ha not your mind.My subconscious sneers.I shake off the unwelcome thought.He stops and reaches for a washcloth as I pant against him, wanting needing.My hands rest on his firm, muscular thighs.Squirting more soap on to the washcloth, he leans down and washes between my legs.I hold my breath.His fingers skillfully stimulating me through the cloth, its heavenly, and my hips start moving at their own rhythm, pushing against his hand.As the sensations take over, I tilt my head back, my eyes rolling to the back of my head, my mouth slack, and I groan.The pressure is building slowly, inexorably inside me  oh my.Feel it, baby, Christian whispers in my ear and very gently grazes my earlobe with his teeth.Feel it for me.My legs are pinioned by his to the side of the bath, holding me prisoner, giving him easy access to this most private part of myself.Oh please, I whisper.I try to stiffen my legs as my body goes rigid.I am in a sexual thrall to this man, and he doesnt let me move.I think youre clean enough now, he murmurs, and he stops.What!No!No!No!My breathing is ragged.Why are you stopping?I gasp.Because I have other plans for you Anastasia.What oh my but I was thats not fair.Turn around.I need washing, too, he murmurs.Oh!Turning to face him, Im shocked to find he has his erection firmly in his grasp.My mouth drops open.I want you to become well acquainted, on first name terms if you will, with my favorite and most cherished part of my body.Im very attached to this.Its so big and growing.His erection is above the water line, the water lapping at his hips.I glance up at him and come face to face with his wicked grin.Hes enjoying my astounded expression.I realize that Im staring.I swallow.That was inside me!It doesnt seem possible.He wants me to touch him.Hmm okay, bring it on.I smile at him and reach for the body wash, squirting some soap onto my hand.I do as hes done, lathering the soap in my hands until they are foamy.I do not take my eyes off his.My lips are parted to accommodate my breathing very deliberately I gently bite my bottom lip and then run my tongue across it, tracing where my teeth have been.His eyes are serious and dark, and they widen as my tongue skims my lower lip.I reach forward and place one of my hands around him, mirroring how hes holding himself.His eyes close briefly.Wow feels much firmer than I expect.I squeeze, and he places his hand over mine.Like this, he whispers, and he moves his hand up and down with a firm grip round my fingers, and my fingers tighten around him.He closes his eyes again, and his breath hitches in his throat.When he opens them again, his gaze is scorching molten gray.Thats right, baby.He releases my hand, leaving me to continue alone, and closes his eyes as I move up and down his length.He flexes his hips slightly into my hand and reflexively I grasp him tighter.A low groan escapes from deep within his throat.Fuck my mouth hmm.I remember him pushing his thumb in my mouth and asking me to suck, hard.His mouth drops open slightly as his breathing increases.I lean forward, while he has his eyes closed, and place my lips around him and tentatively suck, running my tongue over the tip.Whoa Ana.His eyes fly open, and I suck harder.Hmm hes soft and hard at once, like steel encased in velvet, and surprisingly tasty   salty and smooth.Christ, he groans, and he closes his eyes again.Moving down, I push him into my mouth.He groans again.Ha!My inner goddess is thrilled.I can do this.I can fuck him with my mouth.I twirl my tongue around the tip again, and he flexes his hips.His eyes are open now, blistering with heat.His teeth are clenched as he flexes again, and I push him deeper into my mouth, supporting myself on his thighs.I feel his legs tense beneath my hands.He reaches up and grabs my pigtails and starts to really move.Oh baby that feels good, he murmurs.I suck harder, flicking my tongue across the head of his impressive erection.Wrapping my teeth behind my lips, I clamp my mouth around him.His breath hisses between his teeth, and he groans.Jesus.How far can you go?he whispers.Hmm I pull him deeper into my mouth so I can feel him at the back of my throat and then to the front again.My tongue swirls around the end.Hes my very own Christian Grey flavor popsicle.I suck harder and harder, pushing him deeper and deeper, swirling my tongue round and round.Hmm I had no idea giving pleasure could be such a turn on, watching him writhe subtly with carnal longing.My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.Anastasia, Im going to come in your mouth, his breathy tone is warning.If you dont want me to, stop now.He flexes his hips again, his eyes are wide, wary, and filled with salacious need  need for me.Need for my mouth...oh my.Holy crap.His hands are really gripping my hair.I can do this.I push even harder and, in a moment of extraordinary confidence, I bare my teeth.It tips him over the edge.He cries out and stills, and I can feel warm, salty liquid oozing down my throat.I swallow quickly.Ugh Im not sure about this.But one look at him, and hes come apart in the bath because of me, and I dont care.I sit back and watch him, a triumphant, gloating smile tugging at the corners of my lips.His breathing is ragged.Opening his eyes, he glares at me.Dont you have a gag reflex?he asks, astonished.Christ, Ana that was good, really good, unexpected though.He frowns.You know, you never cease to amaze me.I smile and consciously bite my lip.He eyes me speculatively.Have you done that before?No.And I cant help the small tinge of pride in my denial.Good, he says complacently and, I think, relieved.Yet another first, Miss Steele.He looks appraisingly at me.Well, you get an A in oral skills.Come, lets go to bed, I owe you an orgasm.Orgasm!Another one!Quickly, he clambers out of the bath, giving me my first full glimpse of the Adonis, divinely formed, that is Christian Grey.My inner goddess has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly.His erection tamed, but still substantial wow.He wraps a small towel around his waist, covering the essentials, and holds out a larger fluffy white towel for me.Climbing out of the bath, I take his proffered hand.He wraps me in the towel, pulls me into his arms, and kisses me hard, pushing his tongue into my mouth.I long to reach round and embrace him touch him but he has my arms trapped in the towel.Im soon lost in his kiss.He cradles my head, his tongue exploring my mouth, and I get a sense hes expressing his gratitude  maybe  for my first blowjob?Whoa?He pulls away, his hands on either side of my face, staring intently into my eyes.He looks lost.Say yes, he whispers fervently.I frown, not understanding.To what?Yes to our arrangement.To being mine.Please, Ana, he whispers, emphasizing the last word and my name, pleading.He kisses me again, sweetly, passionately, before he stands back and stares at me, blinking slightly.He takes my hand and leads me back to his bedroom, leaving me reeling, so I follow him meekly.Stunned.He really wants this.In his bedroom, he stares down at me as we stand by his bed.Trust me?he asks suddenly.I nod, wide eyed with the sudden realization that I do trust him.Whats he going to do to me now?An electric thrill hums through me.Good girl, he breathes, his thumb brushing my bottom lip.He steps away into his closet and comes back with a silver grey silk woven tie.Knit your hands together in front of you, he orders as he peels the towel off me and throws it on the floor.I do as he asks, and he binds my wrists together with his tie, knotting it firmly.His eyes are bright with wild excitement.He tugs at the binding.Its secure.Some boy scout he must have been to learn these knots.What now?My pulse has gone through the roof, my heart beating a frantic tattoo.He runs his fingers down my pigtails.You look so young with these, he murmurs and moves forward.Instinctively, I move back until I feel the bed against the back of my knees.He drops his towel, but I cant take my eyes off his face.His expression is ardent, full of desire.Oh, Anastasia, what shall I do to you?he whispers as he lowers me on to the bed, lying beside me, and raising my hands above my head.Keep your hands up here, dont move them, understand?His eyes burn into mine, and Im breathless from their intensity.This is not a man I want to cross ever.Answer me, he demands, his voice soft.I wont move my hands.Im breathless.Good girl, he murmurs and deliberately licks his lips slowly.Im mesmerized by his tongue as it sweeps slowly over his upper lip.Hes staring into my eyes, watching me, appraising.He leans down and plants a chaste, swift kiss on my lips.Im going to kiss you all over, Miss Steele, he says softly, and he cups my chin, pushing it up giving him access to my throat.His lips glide down my throat, kissing, sucking, and nipping, to the small dip at the base of my neck.My body leaps to attention everywhere.My recent bath experience has made my skin hyper sensitive.My heated blood pools low in my belly, between my legs, right down there.I groan.I want to touch him.I move my hands and rather awkwardly, given Im restrained, feel his hair.He stops kissing me and glares up at me, shaking his head from side to side, tutting as he does.He reaches for my hands and places them above my head again.Dont move your hands, or we just have to start all over again, he scolds me mildly.Oh, hes such a tease.I want to touch you.My voice is all breathy and out of control.I know, he murmurs.Keep your hands above your head, he orders, his voice forceful.He cups my chin again and starts to kiss my throat as before.Oh hes so frustrating.His hands run down my body and over my breasts as he reaches the dip at the base of my neck with his lips.He swirls the tip of his nose around it then begins a very leisurely cruise with his mouth, heading south, following the path of his hands, down my sternum to my breasts.Each one is kissed and nipped gently and my nipples tenderly sucked.Holy crap.My hips start swaying and moving of their own accord, grinding to the rhythm of his mouth on me, and Im desperately trying to remember to keep my hands above my head.Keep still, he warns, his breath warm against my skin.Reaching my navel, he dips his tongue inside, and then gently grazes my belly with his teeth.My body bows off the bed.Hmm.You are so sweet, Miss Steele.His nose glides along the line between my belly and my pubic hair, biting me gently, teasing me with his tongue.Sitting up suddenly, he kneels at my feet, grasping both my ankles and spreading my legs wide.Holy shit.He grabs my left foot, bends my knee, and brings my foot up to his mouth.Watching and assessing my every reaction, he tenderly kisses each of my toes then bites each one of them softly on the pads.When he reaches my little toe, he bites harder, and I convulse, whimpering.
