Send him and Not Jake.Hed just get Ricky into more trouble.Joe wasnt up to work yet, not afterJames moved past what hed done to the man.Matthew and Eddie.They were solid, and theyd made that run before so they should be able to keep his brother in line.He might not trust them like he trusted Michael, but they could take orders, and hed be reasonably sure that theyd obey.Especially after theyd seen Joes hands.Will do, boss.Good.He headed for the house, satisfied that hed made the right decision.A little space would do both him and Ricky good.He hadnt thought about Carrigan for a whole ten minutes.What was she doing right now?He wouldnt put it past her father and brother to have shipped her out of town again, well beyond his reach.My fault.Never should have gone to that stupid wedding.Normally, he never would have made such a reckless decision, but the woman made him crazy.A little over forty eight hours since seeing her and he was already twitchy, his temper fraying over every little thing.He wanted her safe in his arms.Ironic, because in his arms was where she was in the most danger.He had no doubt that Aiden meant his threatit meant war to continue his affair with Carrigan.The problem washe wasnt sure it wasnt worth it.No, he had to stop pussyfooting around.Carrigan was worth it.Hed never had a woman make him feel the way she did.Hed happily set the world afire and watch it burn if she asked it of him.She wouldnt, though.He knew her well enough to know that.Shed never been put first in her life before, and the truth was that he was a shitty leader for being willing to do it.He just didnt give a fuck.He couldnt call her.The stakes were too high.He wouldnt put her in that position unless he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that she wanted to be there.She had to be the one to reach out to him.And she hadnt.The problem was that he didnt know if it was because she didnt want to or if she couldnt.He could understand her being furious with him.Hed screwed up, but it didnt change anything between themat least not as far as he was concernedand not knowing where she stood pissed him the hell off.He parked and they headed into the house.Brief Eddie and Matthew.Make sure they know how important this shit isand how disappointed Ill be if something goes wrong.After Michael nodded and disappeared down a side hall, James went in search of his brother.It didnt take long for him to find Ricky.Hed posted up in the giant family room on the leather couch, his boots propped on the coffee table, basketball on the TV.James stopped and looked around the room.This used to be the place where he and his brothers spent most of their time.Where theyd fought and bonded over whatever sports was in season.Where theyd eventually grown apart, so they were more strangers than family.He didnt come in here much anymore.Ricky.Yeah?He didnt look away from the screen.I got a job for you.That got his little brothers attention.He turned around, wariness written all over his face.What kind of job?It was like pulling teeth.The kind where I give you orders and you obey them.Unless you already forgot how the other day played out?No, no.I was just asking.Jesus, James, I was just fucking with you.No, he wasnt.He was pushing, testing boundaries, looking for weakness.Was this what parenting was like?James almost laughed at the thought.It might be similar, but he doubted most kids were willing to do actual violence to their parents during their rebellious teenage years.Ricky was.James waited for his brother to drop his gaze before he spoke again.The shipment that comes in two days from now needs an escort over to Northern California.Youll take two men and make sure it gets there without a problem.Rickys mouth tightened, but he gave a jerky nod.Sure thing.He didnt believe the obedient act for a second, but there wasnt a damn thing he could do about it.He couldnt punish his brother for having a shitty attitude, or because he suspected Ricky was up to no good.His men would think he was crazier than his old man, and it would only be a matter of time before they put him in the ground.Getting him out of town for a week or so is exactly what both of us need right now.Have you gone to see him?James stopped but he didnt turn to face his brother.There was no need to ask who Ricky was talking abouttheir old man.No.Not since that first time.Hed shown up at the jail, needing some sort of reassurance that he was doing the right thing as he stepped into the role thrust upon him.Victor had turned James away, leaving the message that he was a disappointment and always had been.Bitterness clawed up his throat, as familiar as the back of his hand.Hed never lived up to his old mans exacting standards, and hed never stopped trying, either.Now he was doing things his own way.And making one hell of a mess of it.His phone buzzed, saving him from the conversation.He dug it from his pocket, and his breath whooshed out at the sight of Carrigans name.Shed called.He thumbed it on as he walked out of the room.Its good to hear from you.James.Her voice was so broken, so unlike her, that he froze.James, I need you.Now.He didnt stop to think or question.He grabbed his jacket and keys from the rack by the door and hit the sidewalk at a run.Im on my way.Tell me where.This was different from the last time shed called him.Shed been upset then.But this sounded so much worse.Did someone hurt you?She laughed, a jagged wet sound.Not how you mean.She rattled off an address.He did some quick mental calculations.I can be there in fifteen minutes.Hed have to break a few traffic laws to pull it off, but hed manage.Okaythank you.Hang in there, lovely.Im coming.He slid into the drivers seat of a black Beemer that he kept for times when he didnt want to draw attention to himself, and dropped his phone next to him so if she called again, he wouldnt miss it.Then he floored it.He made the trip in ten minutes.The address was a little coffee shop in Mission Hill.James pulled up outside, but there was nothing that he could see to raise any red flags.Since Carrigan didnt fly out the door and throw herself into his car, he parked and walked inside.The street was technically OMalley territory, but since it bordered the southwestern outskirts of where they did business, it didnt get the kind of attention it would if it were on the boundary bumping up again Sheridan or Halloran space.That didnt mean he went in relaxed, though.Something was wrong with Carriganseriously wrong.It could be a trap.Didnt matter.She needed him and so he was here.Hed promised her he would be, and nothing that had happened between them had changed that fact.A quick survey of the place found it empty except for a two person table in the back corner where Carrigan sat hunched over, her hands cupped around a giant mug.He dropped into the seat across from her, categorizing everything he saw.There were dark circles beneath her eyes and her hands shook on the mug, but she looked okay.He knew better than most that it didnt mean she was actually okay, though.What happened?She started, as if shed been so lost in thought, she hadnt realized he was there.Her green eyes were full of shadows.Do you know Dmitri Romanov?The name wasnt familiar.But all that meant was that James had never worked with the man personally.No.Im going to marry him.Every cell in his being rejected the words.No.He took a deep breath and forced the anger out of his voice.If this is about the wedding Its not.Id already decided before what happened that Id marry Dmitri.This just expedited things.Shed already decided on a husband and hadnt told him.It shouldnt surprise himhe knew her father had given her a list, and he knew she was working through itbut knowing she was dating these guys and hearing her say she was going to marry one of them were two completely different things.Carrigan.I dont have a choice.You know that.I know that.Hell, everyone in Boston knows that.It was nice to pretend maybe things could be different, but He didnt like this new side of her.Up to this point, every time he interacted with her, shed been a spitfire and so full of life she made him feel like maybe they could exist in this reality without being broken.Something had happened in the last forty eight hours to change that, and his fists clenched with the need to destroy it.What happened?Is this because of your brother?No.Well, sort of.She huddled the coffee closer.He said I needed to chose and get it over with, and God knows I cant choose you.Would she choose him if she could?Before he could ask, she moved on, Dmitri was the best choice.The only choice, really.And I should be grateful that he doesnt play games.She didnt sound grateful.She sounded hopeless.Who is this guy?He runs some kind of business down in New York.I dont really know, but for him to be on my fathers list, hes not a good man.She made a face.Though I knew that thirty seconds after meeting him.Hes a shark.And she was going to marry him.James tried to keep his voice even, but it was damn near impossible.Is he the reason youre like this?She didnt answer directly.This thing between us is over, James.It has to be.I just wanted to say good bye.*** Carrigan watched the emotions play over Jamess face before they settled into one she was familiar withrage.He sat back and crossed his arms over his chest.Explain.This wasnt going how shed planned.Hell, she hadnt had much of a plan when she walked out of the restaurant an hour ago.All shed known was that Dmitri had threatened James, and every instinct she had told her that he was a man who didnt bluff.If she didnt cut things off immediately, hed kill James.It was worse than the threat of war with her family or anything her brothers could bring to bear against Halloran.It was straight out assassination.Shed do whatever it took to keep that from happening.So she forced her spine straight and her shoulders back.This has been fun Fun.but we both knew it could never go anywhere.It wasnt in the cards for them, no matter how much her heart cried out for him.Youre a goddamn liar.He suddenly leaned forward and wrapped his hands around hers, pinning her between the mug and his skin.You want this.You want me.Yes!She pressed her lips together.Youre not listening to me.Yes, I am.Youre saying that things are over, and it sure as fuck sounds like your brothers words coming out of your mouth when you do.He stood, yanking her half out of her seat and nearly spilling her coffee in the process.Come with me.It was a mistake.If she went with him now, shed be putting him in danger.She might be signing his goddamn death warrant.You dont understand He took the mug out of her hands and set it on the table.You still want me.Of course she did.She was starting to suspect shed want this man for the rest of her life and beyond.That has nothing to do with anything.It has everything to do with everything.He pulled her closer, inch by inch, until there was barely a breath of distance between them.I cant let you go, lovely.I wont.Come away with me tonight.Well figure things out, and the world will look better tomorrow.He was wrong.He was so wrong it wasnt even funny.Even if tonight was the most perfect a night could be, nothing would be different tomorrow.It was a lesson Carrigan had learned all too well over the years.But if she had to give him up forever, who would blame her for taking one more night before she had to say good bye?She looked away.She knew who would.Dmitri.He wouldnt be forgiving.Its too risky.Its a risk Im willing to take.Are you?He didnt know what was at stake.But, looking up into his eyes, she realized that maybe she was wrong.James might not know the dirty details about Dmitri and his threats, but he didnt live a life free of danger.Death could come for them any day.It was still a risk, and a stupid one at that, but she found herself nodding all the same.I cant say no to this man.I dont ever want to.Just tonight.Well get this figured out.He kept a hold of her hand as he led her from the coffee shop to where hed parked a black car she didnt recognize, and then held her door while she climbed in.She typed out a quick text to Liam.With James.I promise Ill keep my phone on.It dinged almost as soon as shed pushed send.Where?Carrigan hesitated.What if Liam told her brothers?But then she remembered how things had played out beforehe wouldnt betray her.He just wanted to keep her safe.She glanced at James.Where are you taking me?He eyed the phone in her hand.The beach house.York.Blue house on the ocean drive.She set the phone aside.Shed kept her promiseat least one of them.Okay.Anything I should be worried about?No.She hoped.She seemed to be doing a lot of hoping these days.But as James reached over and took her hand, she let her worry go.It would still be there tomorrow.God knew she couldnt escape her problems as easily as she and James could escape Bostons city limits.She could feel Jamess questions crowding the space between them, but he kept his silence as they drove north.It left her too much opportunity to go over the last forty eight hours.So much had changed, and yet nothing at all.Saturday James had still been forbidden, even if her family didnt know about their relationship.Shed been considering marrying Dmitri, though he hadnt gotten into the heavy handed tactics yet.And shed still wanted James more than anything else in the world.She was just as conflicted now as she had been then, with just as few places to turn for help.Add it all up, and Carrigan couldnt shake the truthno matter which way she turned, she was destined for a life of misery and loss.Twenty James parked in almost the exact same spot he had five days ago, and turned the Beemer off.Were going to talk about it.He still didnt know what the hell was going on to put the bone deep fear into Carrigan, but he fully planned on finding out.She said no one had touched her, and he believed it.But he also knew far too well how to hurt someone without ever laying a finger on them.Shed agreed to come to the beach house.It was a start.He got out and opened her door for her.A car pulled up behind them, a dark sedan with a man in the drivers seat.She glanced over.Its Liam.I promised.As much as he didnt like the idea of OMalleys man knowing that this place existedlet alone where it washe nodded.It was the price of getting her here, and he would gladly pay it.Come on.He guided her across the street with a hand on the small of her back.That little touch grounded him.Shes here.We will figure this out.He knew better, but he couldnt kill the hope in the back of his mind.After locking the door and closing the shades, he turned to her.Lovely, I Not tonight.She stepped into his arms, and he automatically put them around her.He couldnt get over how right this washow right Carrigan was.She made him feel ten feet tall, like he could do whatever it took to make things rightlike nothing was impossible.I want to know whats got you so worked up.And I dont want to talk about it.Please, James.She looked up, her red lips kissably close.Please just give me tonight.The only time I really feel safe is when Im with you.The words were a balm to his soul, chasing away the shadows that he thought had taken up permanent residence.It would be easy, so fucking easy, to give her exactly what she wanted and soak up this feeling.But it was a Band Aid.Hed gone through the same motions enough times to recognize it for what it was.So he framed her face with his hands and kissed her forehead.There had to be some way to balance this.We dont have to talk about what spooked you tonight.But we are going to talk.Tension worked its way into her body, and he resented its presence.She twisted the hem of his shirt between nervous fingers.Talk about what?Whatever you want.As soon as the words were out of his mouth, he fought against the instinctive urge to take them back.There were things hed donethings hed seenthat he never wanted to drag out of the darkness where hed put them.But he would for Carrigan.He knew the second her expression went tight where shed gostraight for the heart.Your scars.Fuck.He took a step back, needing some distance between them and a strong fucking drink.Drink?Sure.She sat on the couch and crossed her long legs, watching him.It struck him that she expected to get what she wanted.She knew damn well that hed rather walk barefoot over burning coals than bring up these ugly memories, and she was betting on him letting her have her way tonight instead of getting into those memories.Well, tough shit.If it were anyone else, theyd be right.But this wasnt anyone else.This woman made him feel things hed thought were long dead and gone, and he wasnt going to shy away from an ugly experience if it meant he was hurdling over the last of her barriers.She trusted him.Shed come to him time and again when she was in trouble or upset.Hed told her about his mothersomething he talked about even less than he talked about his scars.He could tell her this, too.James found whiskey in the upper cabinet and poured himself a healthy dose in a cup.Then he grabbed the gin and vermouth from the lower cabinet and put together her martini.Once it was done, there was nothing left to stall with, but he felt as centered as he was going to be for this conversation.He set her drink on the coffee table and took the other side of the couch.Fine, lovely.Ill bare my soul for youbut these things go both ways.She tensed.I dont know.He waited while she took a nervous sip of her drink, and waited some more while she looked everywhere but at him.Carrigan was a direct sort and, sure enough, it didnt take her long to gather up her courage and meet his gaze.Youre on.Perfect.He drained half his whiskey and set the glass down, doing his damnedest to ignore the shaking in his hands.You know my father is a monster.All of Boston does.Hes got a reputation for being an artist when it comes to torture.Ive heard the rumors.She nodded, a small line appearing between her brows.And I looked into it more after what happened over the summer.People dont like talking about it, but I still managed to learn more than I wanted to know.Of course shed looked into it.It was completely natural for her to want to know what would have been in store for her if she and Callista hadnt escaped that night.It made him sick to think about.He pushed to his feet, filled with too much agitation to just sit here and calmly talk about her being tortured and murdered.She might have made her peace with it.He hadnt.He stalked to the window and twitched back the curtain to stare into the night.My old man wasnt a good person when my mother was alive.He still did the same unforgivable shit that hes been doing the last fifteen years.He was still at least half as crazy as he is now.But when she was alive, he never touched us.It was like this one last bastion of goodness that he had going for him.He might be a monster and a shitty father, but he wasnt that much of a monster.I heard her say that one night while she was praying for his immortal soul.He felt his lips quirk into a smile, but there was no joy behind it.And then she died and everything changed.He paused, trying to get control of his breathing.If he dwelled on it too long, he could feel the whip against his back, the tip tearing through flesh.It had been a long time ago, but there werent enough years to completely banish the memories.His skin tightened, his whole body tense in fear of another blow.Hes gone.Its not happening anymore.It wont happen again.Cold comfort.It was like the last glimmer of light in his soul died with her.He took it into his head that wed been coddled and were pussies, and to my old man, there was only one way to fix it.She didnt say anything, and he couldnt bring himself to look at her and see pity on her face.Hed survived.He hadnt been broken, not completely.James took a deep breath.So one day he drags us down to the basement where he interrogates Halloran enemies, and he tells us He could still see the mad gleam in Victors eyes, hear the rasp of his voice.Jamess skin broke out in goose bumps.He tells us that any sons of his have to prove that they wont break.And then he took us, one by one, and told us to pickthe whip or the canes.Brendan chose the canes, and he had to be carried out of the room afterward.So I chose the whip.Her soft gasp reached him, but he still didnt turn around.It wasnt the last time it happened, but it was the worst.After that, we knew if we stepped out of line, that was the fate that waited for us.Her tentative touch made him face her.He braced himself for the pity, but that wasnt what he saw when he finally turned.No, there was pure and unadulterated rage.Her green eyes practically glowed with it.She took his hands.Say the fucking word and Ill see it taken care of.Shock left his mouth hanging open.What?Some things arent done, James.Some lines arent crossed.Family might be the weight that pulls you under, but they protect their own.These She ran a finger over his shirt, directly across one of the deepest scars.He tortured his own flesh and blood, his children.You protect your children at all costs.To hurt them on purpose?She shook her head, the fire in her eyes only growing.The punishment is death.Youd kill my father for me.He was still trying to catch up with the unexpected reaction.She was so fierce, so furious, so ready to do violence on his behalf.And she wasnt backing down.Shed do it.Shed find a way to get to my old man in prison and see justice done, and she wouldnt blink or feel bad while she was doing it.He framed her face with his hands, his entire body shuddering with the strength of his realization.I love you, Carrigan OMalley.He kissed her before she could say anything else.He wouldnt let her kill Victor.She carried enough.He wouldnt be the reason she added to that burden.But that shed offered and meant every wordit was a priceless gift that he could never repay.No one had ever gone to bat for him.Brendan might have stepped up more often than not to direct their old mans rage away from his younger brothers, but this was different.Carrigan wasnt family.She didnt have a damn thing to gain by this.The only reason shed be driven to demand Victors blood was because she felt just as deeply for him as he did for her.It didnt matter if she said the actual words aloud.Her actions made that shit more than clear.Her arms snaked around her neck, and she drew back enough to say, This conversation isnt over.I know.He kissed her again, delving into her mouth and showing her all the things hed never have the words to say.How much he appreciated her, that he loved how fierce she was, how much he never wanted to let her go.He didnt know what the fuck they were going to do about their current situation, but he was determined to find a way around it.He couldnt do anything less for the woman in his arms.*** Carrigans fury didnt abate as she kissed James.If anything, his words only drove it higher.He loves me.Shed known there was a feeling growing inside her, getting stronger every time she saw him, but shed refused to put a title on it.Love.It was love.And she was putting him in danger right now for even being here with him.One night.Ill figure everything out tomorrow.Things would fall into place where they would.Right now there was just her and James and several hours of freedom.She tugged on his shirt, pulling it up and over his head, needing to be skin to skin.Apparently he had the same idea because he had her dress off seconds later.He lifted her, and she quickly wrapped her legs around his waist while he carried her through the house to the same bedroom theyd been in the other night.Im never going to get enough of you, lovely.Never.Thats what she was afraid of.Because she felt the same waythat this was the end all, be all, and everything after this would be like living in a shadow.She kissed him harder.There is no tomorrow.There is just right now, in this moment, with this man.The feeling of a clock counting down in the back of her head intensified.This might be her last chance to have him, to feel his hands on her body, to have him whispering filthy things in her ear.To tell him how she felt.She opened her mouth to do just that, but some instinct held her back.If he knew she loved him, too, hed never let her go.Hed fight to his dying breath for her.Which was the damn problemhis dying breath.I cant let him die for me.So she kept silent as he laid her on the bed and kissed her as if he never needed to breathe.His clever fingers did away with her bra and he sat back, pulling her panties with him.He stopped with them around her ankles, her feet pressed against his chest.What do you need from me tonight?She pressed her lips together to keep from confessing everythingher fear and her shitty future and all the worries crowding to the forefront of her brain now that they werent losing themselves in each other.She focused on his blue eyes.How had she ever thought they were cold?They werent.They were the hottest flame.Really, there was only one answer.Everything.He nodded like shed confessed to more than a single word.Maybe she had.Everything and more, lovely.He tossed her panties to the side.She didnt give him a chance to retreat, though.Carrigan unbuttoned his jeans and pulled them down just enough to free his cock.His whole body went tense, and she looked up the long line of his chest, meeting his gaze and waiting to see if hed stop her.He didnt.So she took him into her mouth, sucking him down until his curse rang to the ceiling.He fisted his hands in her hair.Ive been thinking about that hot, wet mouth around my cock, lovely.Ive come more times than I can count to that fantasy.She hummed her approval, taking him deeper, never taking her eyes off his face.He watched her, his jaw tight and his eyes hooded.The fantasy doesnt even come close.Slip that hand between your legs.Does sucking me off get you wet?Yes.She ran her tongue along the underside of his cock as she obeyed him.Though a part of her wanted to finish him like this, to see him lose control completely, she needed to lose herself in him more.James, I need you.And if I tell you to finish me this way?His control was better than hers.It had been since they started this dance around each other all those months ago.But she had an ace up her sleeve, and she didnt hesitate to use it now.Please, James.I want to come around your cock.Please.He cursed long and low.I couldnt deny you even if I wanted to.He grabbed a condom from the nightstand, put it on, and crawled onto the bed, settling between her legs.He shoved against her, the angle wrong to push inside her, his cock sliding over her clit.This is what you need, lovely.He hitched her leg up, opening her further.Yes!She grabbed his shoulders, arching up to meet his thrusts, trying to move to eliminate that last tiny distance between them.But he was having none of it.He nipped her neck.Not yet.Damn it, stop teasing me.Never.He slid over her again, the sensation not enough to push her into oblivion.I love the way you writhe for me, how your body goes soft and tight at the same time, like youll never get enough.He kept his free hand on her hip, pinning her in place and preventing her from changing the angle.I love how youll do damn near anything to get me inside you.She would, too.She grabbed a fistful of his hair, yanking it a little harder than she would have normally.And youre a goddamn tease.You love it.Another stroke.Maybe.He shifted, his cock notching in her entrance, and pushed just the tip into her.She hissed out a breath, needing so much more, but he seemed content to hold that position.James!He sank another inch into her.This is what you need.What you cant go another second without.Yes.Oh my God, yes.Another inch.And another.Slowly and surely, until he had sunk into her to the hilt.And then he kissed her, his tongue working hers, taking what he already knew was his.She moved against him, only able to shift the slightest bit because of his weight pinning her to the mattress.That barest amount created a delicious friction, though, so she kept doing it.Pleasure built with each breath, low and deep and more profound than anything shed ever felt before.She clutched his shoulders, her legs sliding over his, sweat slicking her skin.James, I I know, lovely.He thrust a little, spiraling her pleasure higher.I feel it, too.She was so damn close, but she never wanted it to end.She ran her hands down his back, lightly raking her nails over his skin, to dig into his ass.Please dont stop.Im never going to stop.He thrust again, and that was all it took.She undulated wildly beneath him, taking him as deep as she could in this position, holding him so close she wasnt sure where she ended and where he began.He moved back, spreading her legs even further and pounding into her.Ive said it before, lovely, and Ill say it again.Youre mine and mine alone.Twenty One James traced Carrigans tattoo and then moved down the center of her stomach.Her muscles twitched beneath his finger, but she just turned her head and looked at him.Tired pleasure radiated from every line of her body.I needed that.I know.He kissed her shoulder.Having her beneath him had been almost cleansing.He felt new and whole and vulnerable in a way he wasnt prepared to deal with.Hed told her he loved her.She hadnt said it back, but she also hadnt run screaming from the room.He knew she cared about him.There was time to build things between them.He wasnt about to let her go without a fight.Do you ever think about justleaving?She closed her eyes.Sometimes I fantasize about getting in a car and driving until I find some tiny little town where no ones heard of the OMalleys and where everyone knows everyone else and things are just simpler.Ive thought about it.But hed never left for the same reason she hadnt.Family.I figure those small town people have their own problems and secrets and bullshit.Its the human condition.Maybe.Or maybe thats just what we have to tell ourselves not to take out a gun and put it in our mouths.He froze.What?No fucking way was she talking about what he thought she was talking about.Not me.She opened her eyes and grabbed his hand.Im not talking about me.I swear.I love life too much to go down like that.Ill have to be dragged from this world, kicking and screaming, no matter how shitty things get.But I worry about my sisters.He watched the expressions play across her face.Theyre strong.Thats what I keep telling myself, but I dont know if I believe it anymore.My brothers death changed a lot of things.Everyone is so much more brittle now.She stroked her hand down his arm, starting at his shoulder and moving over every muscle.My brothers are so angry and afraid, even if they try to cover the latter with the former.I dont think my baby sister has spent more than a half an hour sober since we were hustled out of town after all that shit went down.And Sloan Her eyes darkened.Shes a ghost of the woman she used to be.He knew all about how the death of someone beloved could change everythingruin everything.But this wasnt about him.It was about saying what was necessary to comfort Carrigan.It wont always be like this.Oh, no doubt something even more horrible will come along and push our already teetering family off the cliff.Thats not what I meant.He was seriously worthless as this comforting bullshit, but that wasnt going to stop him from trying.Your family is strong.Your parents will hold things together and your siblings will find their feet.Life will go on, whether anyone wants it to or not.This tragedy wont break youany of you.He brushed her hair back.I dont know if Ive said how fucking sorry I am that it happened.I didnt give the order, but it doesnt matter.It was Halloran men who did it.Ricky who did it.I wont lie and say its okay.Her eyes shone, but no tears fell.Devlin was too good for this life.I think any one of us would have stepped in front of that bullet to give him a second chance at life.Butits not your fault.When you live the lives we do, your family has a nasty tendency not to tell the right hand what the left hand is doing.Wasnt that the fucking truth.He traced over her cheekbone and down to her bottom lip with his thumb.I know.But I am sorry.I wish We all do.She sat up, the move knocking his hands away.Theres no use talking about it.Its over and done with.Practically ancient history.What the fuck?James sat up, too.He didnt realize what she planned until she lurched off the bed and reached for her dress.What are you doing?I gave you tonight.Were done now.It took him a full five seconds to hear and process her words.No fucking way.Get your ass back in my bed.She shimmied into her dress.This has been funtoo much funbut its over now.He could barely believe she was doing this now.It was stone cold.James scrubbed a hand over his face.Its over when I say its over.We have a long way to go before that, lovely.I said I love you and I fucking meant it.She froze, her back to him.Well, thats just too damn bad.Im not responsible for how you feel.I didnt ask you to fall for me.I know how to keep my emotions in check.Liar.He was on his feet before making the decision to move.Youre running scared.Again.What Im doing is going home before my brothers follow through on their threats to start another goddamn war.We lost too much last time.Im not letting that rest on my head.It was an excuse, and not even a good one.If shed wanted to avoid the threat of war, she never would have called him in the first place, let alone come out here with him.Dont you ever get tired of dancing to whatever tune your family sets?No.She stepped into her heels.Unlike some people, my family will always come first.She was going to throw that in his face?He crossed his arms over his chest.Whatever you have to tell yourself to sleep at night.He wanted to grab her, to shake her until some sense popped into that gorgeous head of hers, but hed never laid a hand on a woman in anger and he sure as fuck wasnt about to start now.Tying her up until she saw reason wasnt an option, either.He was left with nothing but standing there and watching her get ready to walk out of his life.He couldnt shake the feeling that if she left now, it would be for good.So he tried to be calm and rational.Carrigan, sit down and well talk this through.Talking never did anyone a damn bit of good.She stopped in the doorway, her knuckles white where they fisted the hem of her dress.Good bye, James.For good this time.Then she was gone, disappearing as if shed never been there to begin with.And he just watched her go.As soon as he heard the door close behind her, he slowly got dressed.It didnt take a genius to realize what she was doingmaking yet another personal sacrifice for her family.Shed said as much.She might even be trying to protect him, too.It didnt matter.All that mattered was that shed walked out without talking about it, without giving him a chance to find a way out of this mess.She might care about him, but she didnt trust him.And fuck if that didnt hurt.He rubbed a hand over his chest, knowing damn well that it wouldnt do anything to combat the dull ache that started there the second she walked out of this room.There would be no more phone calls.She wouldnt come running to him again, no matter how deep into shit she got.No, she was off to marry this Dmitri Romanov and sail away into the sunset.Fuck.He walked through the still mostly dark house, letting the memories wash over him.Play fighting with his brothers in the living room.Watching his mother knit in the rocking chair, looking more at peace than he ever saw her in Boston.The loud meals served around the tiny dining room table, while he and Brendan and Ricky all competed for her undivided attention.Shed always managed to make each of them feel like they were the center of her world.And their old manJames touched the thickest scar running across his upper chest.He could feel the ridge of it through the thin fabric of his T shirt.His father hadnt dared touch them while she walked this earth.Hed always thought that it was because her death broke the man, but now he wondered.Victor had been batshit crazy for as long as James could remember.Had his mother been the reason he stayed his hand?The shield between her boys and their sadistic fuck of a father?The more he thought about it, the more it seemed to fit.Hed never seen her in a swimsuit.Whenever he thought about it now, hed chalked it up to the summers that were never quite warm enough.But what if it wasnt?His hands clenched.Had Victor hurt her as a proxy and then turned his attentions on his boys when she was no longer available?His stomach lurched, and he had to close his eyes and concentrate on breathing.It was the past.Knowing that didnt magically make the hurt go away, but it helped him focus.Right now he had bigger problems than worrying about if his old man beat his mother fifteen years ago.He would find out, though.In the meantimeJames turned to the front door.Hed give Carrigan some time.Chasing her down now wouldnt do either one of them a damn bit of good.She was freaked out and she had reason to be.As much as it stung that she didnt believe in him enough to give him the chance to fix things, a part of him understood.A very small part.The rest wanted to track her down, but it would only make her run farther and faster from him.No, hed find a way around this, and then hed come for her.He walked out of the house and locked the door behind him.The first order of business was to get through the exchange tomorrow with those pieces of shit bringing in women.Then hed deal with the mess with Carrigan.It wasnt like shed be married in the next twenty four hours, after all.*** Sloan drifted up the stairs, moving down the hallway on bare feet, taking silent count.Keira had stumbled home sometime after one and was currently passed out in her bed.But she was safe.Cillian hadnt come back from wherever hed gone when he left this afternoon, but she suspected he was wherever hed been spending all this time latelymost likely a bar.Aidenwell, Aiden was the easiest of her siblings to keep track of.He rarely left their fathers study anymore, except when business demanded it.More and more hed taken up the mantle of leadership, and she sometimes wondered if she was the only one who could see how heavily it weighed on him.But he wouldnt accept a shoulder to lean on because it would mean he was weak.She shook her head and walked into the formal living room.It was one of the few public rooms on the front of the house with windows looking down over the sidewalk.Not that she could see much between the trees and darkness, but it didnt stop her from trying.Carrigan hadnt come home yet.She glanced at her watch, a diamond MICHELE that shed gotten on her sixteenth birthday from her parents.Most days it felt more like a shackle than a way to tell time.Two a. m.  Too late.She knew something had happened at the wedding, but she didnt know what.Not that she was surprised about her familys unwillingness to talk about itthey never had been free with their information unless forced.All she knew was that it involved Carrigan and had whipped both Cillian and Aiden into a fury that still hadnt abated two days later.And now her sister had pulled another of her disappearing acts.Sloan touched the glass, as if that would do something to draw her home and to safety faster.Things were happening too quickly, spiraling out of control.She sighed.Even though it had been banishment for all intents and purposes, she craved the simplicity of their house in Connecticut.When they were there, the drama and worries that populated daily life in Boston seemed worlds away.She could almost believe they were normal people who didnt believe in arranged marriages and who didnt do unmentionable things on the illegal side of their operations.But it was a childish dream.Just like her hope for one day marrying a man she lovedand who loved her.And her wish to be a schoolteacher.And countless other things that had fallen by the wayside as she turned eighteen and had to face the factsshe was expected to marry a man of her fathers choosing, and to devote her life to making him happy and giving him children.There was no room there for a career of her own.And love?Love wasnt even on the radar.Movement below drew her attention to where Carrigan and Liam appeared from beneath the tree directly in front of the town house and hurried up the steps to the front door.A few seconds later, the sound of it opening and shutting whispered through the near silent halls.If she hadnt been waiting for it, she wouldnt have known that itd happened.Sloan walked back through the hallway to the top of the stairs, reaching it just as her sister did.Carrigan.Holy shit!Carrigan jerked back, her hand on her chest.I didnt see you there.Which was the point.Her mother had already lectured her about how unseemly her nighttime wanderings were.So she made sure that Aileen didnt know about them anymore.
