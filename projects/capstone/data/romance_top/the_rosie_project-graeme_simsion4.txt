Yeah.To him.To anybody.Im getting a bit sick of certain people thinking Im stupid.I consider you remarkably intelligent  Dont say it.Say what?For a barmaid.You were going to say that, werent you?Rosie had predicted correctly.My mother was a doctor.So is my father, if youre talking about genes.And you dont have to be a professor to be smart.I saw your face when I said I got seventy four on the GAMSAT.You were thinking, He wont believe this woman is that smart.But he did.So, put your prejudices away.It was a reasonable criticism.I had little contact with people outside academia and had formed my assumptions about the rest of the world primarily from watching films and television as a child.I recognized that the characters in Lost in Space and Star Trek were probably not representative of humans in general.Certainly, Rosie did not conform to my barmaid stereotype.It was quite likely that many of my other assumptions about people were wrong.This was no surprise.The DNA analyzer was ready.Do you have a preference?I asked.Whichever.I dont want to make any decisions.I realized that she was referring to the sequence of testing rather than the choice of father.I clarified the question.I dont know, she said.Ive been thinking about it all afternoon.Alans dead, which would suck.And Natalie would be my sister, which Ive got to tell you is pretty weird.But its a sort of closure, if that makes sense.I like Peter, but I dont really know anything about him.Hes probably got a family.It struck me once again that this Father Project had not been well thought through.Rosie had spent the afternoon trying to subdue unwanted emotions, yet the motivation for the project seemed to be entirely emotional.I tested Peter Enticott first, as the hair from Natalies brush required more time for preprocessing.No match.I had found several roots in the wad of hair, so there was no need to have stolen the toothbrush.As I processed them, I reflected that Rosies first two candidates, including the one she had felt was a high probability, Eamonn Hughes, had not matched.It was my prediction that Alans daughter would not match either.I was right.I remembered to look at Rosie for her reaction.She looked very sad.It seemed we would have to get drunk again.Remember, she said, the samples not from him; its his daughters.Ive already factored it in.Naturally.So thats it.But we havent solved the problem.As a scientist I am not accustomed to abandoning difficult problems.Were not going to, said Rosie.Weve tested everyone I ever heard of.Difficulties are inevitable, I said.Major projects require persistence.Save it for something that matters to you.Why do we focus on certain things at the expense of others?We will risk our lives to save a person from drowning, yet not make a donation that could save dozens of children from starvation.We install solar panels when their impact on CO2 emissions is minimaland indeed may have a net negative effect if manufacturing and installation are taken into accountrather than contributing to more efficient infrastructure projects.I consider my own decision making in these areas to be more rational than that of most people, but I also make errors of the same kind.We are genetically programmed to react to stimuli in our immediate vicinity.Responding to complex issues that we cannot perceive directly requires the application of reasoning, which is less powerful than instinct.This seemed to be the most likely explanation for my continued interest in the Father Project.Rationally, there were more important uses for my research capabilities, but instinctively I was driven to assist Rosie with her more immediate problem.As we drank a glass of Muddy Water pinot noir at Jimmy Watsons before Rosie had to go to work, I tried to persuade her to continue with the project, but she argued, rationally enough, that there was now no reason to consider any member of her mothers graduation class more likely than any other.She guessed that there would be a hundred or more students and pointed out that thirty years ago, as a result of entrenched gender bias, the majority would be male.The logistics of finding and testing fifty doctors, many of whom would be living in other cities or countries, would be prohibitive.Rosie said she didnt care that much.Rosie offered me a lift home, but I decided to stay and drink.thirteen   Before abandoning the Father Project, I decided to check Rosies estimate of the number of father candidates.It occurred to me that some possibilities could be easily eliminated.The medical classes I teach contain numerous foreign students.Given Rosies distinctly pale skin, I considered it unlikely that her father was Chinese, Vietnamese, black, or Indian.I began with some basic researchan Internet search for information about the medical graduation class, based on the three names I knew.The results exceeded my expectations, but problem solving often requires an element of luck.It was no surprise that Rosies mother had graduated from my current university.At the time, there were only two medical courses in Melbourne.I found two relevant photos.One was a formal photo of the entire graduation class, with the names of the 146 students.The other was taken at the graduation party, also with names.There were only 124 faces, presumably because some students did not attend.Since the gene shopping had occurred at the party or after, we would not have to worry about the nonattendees.I verified that the 124 were a subset of the 146.I had expected that my search would produce a list of graduates and probably a photo.An unexpected bonus was a Where are they now?discussion board.But the major stroke of luck was the information that a thirtieth anniversary reunion had been scheduled.The date was only three weeks away.We would need to act quickly.I ate dinner at home and rode to the Marquess of Queensbury.Disaster!Rosie wasnt working.The barman informed me that Rosie worked only three nights per week, which struck me as insufficient to provide an adequate income.Perhaps she had a day job as well.I knew very little about her, beyond her job, her interest in finding her father, and her age, which, based on the fact that her mothers graduation party was thirty years earlier, must be twenty nine.I had not asked Gene how he had met her.I did not even know her mothers name to identify her in the photo.The barman was friendly, so I ordered a beer and some nuts and reviewed the notes I had brought.There were sixty three males in the graduation party photo, a margin of only two over the females, insufficient to support Rosies claim of discrimination.Some were unambiguously non Caucasian, though not as many as I expected.It was thirty years ago, and the influx of Chinese students had not yet commenced.There was still a large number of candidates, but the reunion offered an opportunity for batch processing.I had by now deduced that the Marquess of Queensbury was a gay bar.On the first visit, I had not observed the social interactions, as I was too focused on finding Rosie and initiating the Father Project, but this time I was able to analyze my surroundings in more detail.I was reminded of the chess club that I belonged to when I was at school: people drawn together by a common interest.It was the only club I had ever joined, excluding the University Club, which was more of a dining facility.I did not have any gay friends, but this was related to my overall small number of friends rather than to any prejudice.Perhaps Rosie was gay?She worked in a gay bar, although the clients were all males.I asked the barman.He laughed.Good luck with that one, he said.It didnt answer the question, but he had moved on to serve another customer.As I finished lunch at the University Club the following day, Gene walked in, accompanied by a woman I recognized from the singles partyFabienne the Sex Deprived Researcher.It appeared that she had found a solution to her problem.We passed each other at the dining room entrance.Gene winked at me and said, Don, this is Fabienne.Shes visiting from Belgium and were going to discuss some options for collaboration.He winked again and quickly moved past.Belgium.I had assumed Fabienne was French.Belgian explained it.Gene already had France.I was waiting outside the Marquess of Queensbury when Rosie opened the doors at 9:00 p. m.   Don.Rosie looked surprised.Is everything okay?I have some information.Better be quick.Its not quick, theres quite a lot of detail.Im sorry, Don, my boss is here.Ill get into trouble.I need this job.What time do you finish?Three a. m.   I couldnt believe it!What sort of jobs did Rosies patrons have?Maybe they all worked in bars that opened at 9:00 p. m.  and had four nights a week off.A whole invisible nocturnal subculture, using resources that would otherwise stand idle.I took a huge breath and made a huge decision.Ill meet you then.I rode home, went to bed, and set the alarm for 2:30 a. m.  I canceled the run I had scheduled with Gene for the following morning to retrieve an hour.I would also skip karate.At 2:50 a. m.  I was riding through the inner suburbs.It was not a totally unpleasant experience.In fact, I could see major advantages for myself in working at night.Empty laboratories.No students.Faster response times on the network.No contact with the Dean.If I could find a pure research position, with no teaching, it would be entirely feasible.Perhaps I could teach via video link at a university in another time zone.I arrived at Rosies workplace at exactly 3:00 a. m.  The door was locked and a Closed sign was up.I knocked hard.Rosie came to the door.Im beat, she said.This was hardly surprising.Come in.Im almost done.Apparently the bar closed at 2:30 a. m.  but Rosie had to clean up.You want a beer?she said.A beer!At 3:01 a. m.  Ridiculous.Yes, please.I sat at the bar watching her clean up.The question I had asked sitting in the same place the previous day popped into my mind.Are you gay?I asked.You came here to ask me that?No, the question is unrelated to the main purpose of my visit.Pleased to hear it, alone at three in the morning in a bar with a strange man.Im not strange.Not much, she said, but she was laughing, presumably making a joke to herself based on the two meanings of strange.I still didnt have an answer to the gay question.She opened a beer for herself.I pulled out my folder and extracted the party photo.Is this the party where your mother was impregnated?Shit.Where did this come from?I explained about my research and showed her my spreadsheet.All names are listed.Sixty three males, nineteen obviously non Caucasian, as determined by visual assessment and supported by names, three already eliminated.Youve got to be kidding.Were not testing ...thirty one people.Forty one.Whatever.I dont have an excuse to meet any of them.I told her about the reunion.Minor problem, said Rosie.Were not invited.Correct, I said.The problem is minor and already solved.There will be alcohol.So?I indicated the bar and the collection of bottles on shelves behind it.Your skills will be required.Youre kidding me.Can you secure employment at the event?Hang on, hang on.This is getting seriously crazy.You think were going to turn up at this party and start swabbing peoples glasses.Oh man.Not us.You.I dont have the skills.But otherwise, correct.Forget it.I thought you wanted to know who your father was.I told you, she said.Not that much.Two days later, Rosie appeared at my apartment.It was 8:47 p. m. , and I was cleaning the bathroom, as Eva the short skirted cleaner had canceled owing to illness.I buzzed her upstairs.I was wearing my bathroom cleaning costume of shorts, surgical boots, and gloves but no shirt.Wow.She stared at me for a few moments.This is what martial arts training does, is it?She appeared to be referring to my pectoral muscles.Then suddenly she jumped up and down like a child.We got the gig!I found the agency and I offered them shit rates and they went yeah, yeah, yeah, dont tell anyone.Ill report them to the union when its over.I thought you didnt want to do this.Changed my mind.She gave me a stained paperback.Memorize this.Ive got to get to work.She turned and left.I looked at the bookThe Bartenders Companion: A Complete Guide to Making and Serving Drinks.It appeared to specify the duties of the role I was to perform.I memorized the first few recipes before finishing the bathroom.As I prepared for sleep, having skipped the aikido routine to spend further time studying the book, it occurred to me that things were getting crazy.It was not the first time that my life had become chaotic, and I had established a protocol for dealing with the problem and the consequent disturbance to rational thinking.I called Claudia.She was able to see me the next day.Because I am not officially one of her clients, we have to have our discussions over coffee rather than in her office.And I am the one accused of rigidity!I outlined the situation, omitting the Father Project component, as I did not want to admit to the surreptitious collection of DNA, which Claudia was likely to consider unethical.Instead, I suggested that Rosie and I had a common interest in movies.Have you talked to Gene about her?asked Claudia.I told her that Gene had introduced Rosie as a candidate for the Wife Project and that he would only encourage me to have sex with her.I explained that Rosie was totally unsuitable as a partner but was presumably under the illusion that I was interested in her on that basis.Perhaps she thought that our common interest was an excuse for pursuing her.I had made a major social error in asking her about her sexual orientation: it would only reinforce that impression.Yet Rosie had never mentioned the Wife Project.We had been sidetracked so quickly by the Jacket Incident, and after that things had unfolded in a totally unplanned way.But I saw a risk that at some point I would hurt her feelings by telling her that she had been eliminated from consideration for the Wife Project after the first date.So thats what youre worried about, said Claudia.Hurting her feelings?Correct.Thats excellent, Don.Incorrect.Its a major problem.I mean that youre concerned about her feelings.And youre enjoying time together?Immensely, I said, realizing it for the first time.And is she enjoying herself?Presumably.But she applied for the Wife Project.Dont worry about it, said Claudia.She sounds pretty resilient.Just have some fun.A strange thing happened the next day.For the first time ever, Gene made an appointment to see me in his office.I had always been the one to organize conversations, but there had been an unusually long gap as a result of the Father Project.Genes office is larger than mine, owing to his higher status rather than any actual requirement for space.The Beautiful Helena let me in, as Gene was late in returning from a meeting.I took the opportunity to check his world map for pins in India and Belgium.I was fairly certain that the Indian one had been there before, but it was possible that Olivia was not actually Indian.She had said she was Hindu, so she could have been Balinese or Fijian or indeed from any country with a Hindu population.Gene worked on nationalities rather than ethnicities, in the same way that travelers count the countries they have visited.North Korea predictably remained without a pin.Gene arrived and commanded the Beautiful Helena to fetch us coffees.We sat at his table, as if in a meeting.So, said Gene, youve been talking to Claudia.This was one of the negatives of not being an official client of Claudia: I did not have the protection of confidentiality.I gather youve been seeing Rosie.As the expert predicted.Yes, I said, but not for the Wife Project.Gene is my best friend, but I still felt uncomfortable about sharing information about the Father Project.Fortunately he did not pursue it, probably because he assumed I had sexual intentions toward Rosie.In fact I was amazed that he didnt immediately raise the topic.What do you know about Rosie?he asked.Not very much, I said honestly.We havent talked much about her.Our discussion has focused on external issues.Give me a break, he said.You know what she does, where she spends her time.Shes a barmaid.Okay, said Gene.Thats all you know?And she doesnt like her father.Gene laughed for no obvious reason.I dont think hes Robinson Crusoe.This seemed a ludicrous statement about Rosies paternity until I recalled that the reference to the fictional shipwreck survivor could be used as a metaphorical phrase meaning not alone or in this context not alone in not being liked by Rosie.Gene must have noticed my puzzled expression as I worked it out, and elaborated: The list of men that Rosie likes is not a long one.Shes gay?Might as well be, said Gene.Look at the way she dresses.Genes comment seemed to refer to the type of costume she was wearing when she first appeared in my office.But she dressed conventionally for her bar work, and on our visits to collect DNA had worn unexceptional jeans and tops.On the night of the Jacket Incident she had been unconventional but extremely attractive.Perhaps she did not want to send out mating signals in the environment in which Gene had encountered her, presumably a bar or restaurant.Much of womens clothing is designed to enhance their sexual attraction in order to secure a mate.If Rosie was not looking for a mate, it seemed perfectly rational for her to dress otherwise.There were many things that I wanted to ask Gene about Rosie, but I suspected that asking would imply a level of interest that Gene would misinterpret.But there was one critical question.Why was she prepared to participate in the Wife Project?Gene hesitated a while.Who knows?he said.I dont think shes a lost cause, but just dont expect too much.Shes got a lot of issues.Dont forget the rest of your life.Genes advice was surprisingly perceptive.Did he know how much time I was spending with the cocktail book?fourteen   My name is Don Tillman and I am an alcoholic.I formed these words in my head but I did not say them out loud, not because I was drunk (which I was) but because it seemed that if I said them, they would be true, and I would have no choice but to follow the rational path, which was to stop drinking permanently.My intoxication was a result of the Father Projectspecifically the need to gain competence as a drinks waiter.I had purchased a cocktail shaker, glasses, olives, lemons, a zester, and a substantial stock of liquor as recommended in The Bartenders Companion in order to master the mechanical component of cocktail making.It was surprisingly complex, and I am not naturally a dexterous person.In fact, with the exception of rock climbing, which I have not practiced since I was a student, and martial arts, I am clumsy and incompetent at most forms of sports.The expertise in karate and aikido is the result of considerable practice over a long period.I practiced first for accuracy, then speed.At 11:07 p. m. , I was exhausted and decided that it would be interesting to test the cocktails for quality.I made a classic martini, a vodka martini, a margarita, and a cocksucking cowboycocktails noted by the book as being among the most popular.They were all excellent and tasted far more different from one another than ice cream varieties.I had squeezed more lime juice than was required for the margarita and made a second so as not to waste it.Research consistently shows that the risks to health outweigh the benefits of drinking alcohol.My argument is that the benefits to my mental health justify the risks.Alcohol seems to both calm me down and elevate my mood, a paradoxical but pleasant combination.And it reduces my discomfort in social situations.I generally manage my consumption carefully, scheduling two days abstinence per week, although the Father Project had caused this rule to be broken a number of times.My level of consumption does not of itself qualify me as an alcoholic.However, I suspect that my strong antipathy toward discontinuing it might do so.The Mass DNA Collection Subproject was proceeding satisfactorily, and I was working my way through the cocktail book at the required rate.Contrary to popular belief, alcohol does not destroy brain cells.As I prepared for bed, I felt a strong desire to telephone Rosie and report on progress.Logically it was not necessary, and it is a waste of effort to report that a project is proceeding to plan, which should be the default assumption.Rationality prevailed.Just.Rosie and I met for coffee twenty eight minutes before the reunion function.To my first class honors degree and PhD, I could now add a Responsible Service of Alcohol certificate.The exam had not been difficult.Rosie was already in server uniform and had brought a male equivalent for me.I picked it up early and washed it, she said.I didnt want a karate exhibition.She was obviously referring to the Jacket Incident, even though the martial art I had employed was aikido.I had prepared carefully for the DNA collectionziplock bags, tissues, and preprinted adhesive labels with the names from the graduation photo.Rosie insisted that we did not need to collect samples from those who had not attended the graduation party, so I crossed out their names.She seemed surprised that I had memorized them, but I was determined not to cause errors due to lack of knowledge.The reunion was held at a golf club, which seemed odd to me, but I discovered that the facilities were largely for eating and drinking rather than supporting the playing of golf.I also discovered that we were vastly overqualified.There were regular bar personnel who were responsible for preparing the drinks.Our job was merely to take orders, deliver drinks, and, most important, collect the empty glasses.The hours spent in developing my drink making skills had apparently been wasted.The guests began arriving, and I was given a tray of drinks to distribute.I immediately perceived a problem.No name tags!How would we identify the DNA sources?I managed to find Rosie, who had also realized the problem but had a solution, based on her knowledge of social behavior.Say to them, Hi, Im Don and Ill be looking after you this evening, Doctor She demonstrated how to give the impression that the sentence was incomplete, encouraging them to contribute their names.Extraordinarily, it turned out to work 72.5 percent of the time.I realized that I needed to do this with the women as well, to avoid appearing sexist.Eamonn Hughes and Peter Enticott, the candidates we had eliminated, arrived.As a family friend, Eamonn must have known Rosies profession, and she explained to him that I worked evenings to supplement my academic income.Rosie told Peter Enticott that she did bar work part time to finance her PhD.Perhaps they both assumed that we had met through working together.Actually swabbing the glasses discreetly proved the most difficult problem, and I was able to get at most one sample from each tray that I returned to the bar.Rosie was having even more problems.I cant keep track of all the names, she said frantically, as we passed each other with drinks trays in our hands.It was getting busy and she seemed a little emotional.I sometimes forget that many people are not familiar with basic techniques for remembering data.The success of the subproject would be in my hands.There will be adequate opportunity when they sit down, I said.There is no reason for concern.I surveyed the tables set for dinner, ten seats per table, plus two with eleven seats, and calculated the attendance at ninety two.This, of course, included female doctors.Partners had not been invited.There was a small risk that Rosies father was a transsexual.I made a mental note to check the women for signs of male features and test any that appeared doubtful.Overall, however, the numbers looked promising.When the guests sat down, the mode of service moved from provision of a limited selection of drinks to taking orders.Apparently, this arrangement was unusual.Normally, we would just bring bottles of wine, beer, and water to the table, but as this was an upmarket function, the club was taking orders and we had been told to push the top shelf stuff, apparently to increase the clubs profits.It occurred to me that if I did this well, I might be forgiven for any other errors.I approached one of the tables of eleven.I had already introduced myself to seven of the guests and obtained six names.I commenced with a woman whose name I already knew.Greetings, Dr.Collie.What can I get you to drink?She looked at me strangely, and for a moment I thought I had made an error with the word association method I was using and that her name was perhaps Doberman or Poodle.But she did not correct me.Just a white wine, thanks.I recommend a margarita.Worlds most popular cocktail.Youre doing cocktails?Correct.In that case, she said, Ill have a martini.Standard?Yes, thanks.Easy.I turned to the unidentified man beside her and tried the Rosie name extraction trick.Greetings, my name is Don and Ill be looking after you this evening, Doctor  You said youre doing cocktails?Correct.Have you heard of a Rob Roy?Of course.Well, put me down for one.Sweet, dry, or perfect?I asked.One of the men opposite my customer laughed.Take that, Brian.Perfect, said the man I now knew as Dr.Brian Joyce.There were two Brians but I had already identified the first.Dr.Walsh (female, no transsexual characteristics) ordered a margarita.Standard, premium, strawberry, mango, melon, or sage and pineapple?I asked.Sage and pineapple?Why not?My next customer was the only remaining unidentified man, the one who had laughed at Brians order.He had previously failed to respond to the name extraction trick.I decided not to repeat it.What would you like?I asked.Ill have a double coddled Kurdistani sailmaker with a reverse twist, he said.Shaken, not stirred.I was unfamiliar with this drink but assumed the professionals behind the bar would know it.Your name, please?Sorry?I require your name.To avoid errors.There was a silence.Dr.Jenny Broadhurst, beside him, said, His names Rod.Dr.Roderick Broadhurst, correct?I said by way of confirmation.The rule against partners did not apply, of course, to people who were in a relationship with someone from the same class.There were seven such couples and Jenny was predictably sitting beside her husband.What started Rod, but Jenny interrupted.Quite correct.Im Jenny and Ill have a sage and pineapple margarita too, please.She turned to Rod.Are you being a jerk?About the sailmaker?Pick on someone with your own complement of synapses.Rod looked at her, then at me.Sorry, mate, just kidding.Ill have a martini.Standard.I collected the remainder of the names and orders without difficulty.I understood that Jenny had been trying to tell Rod discreetly that I was unintelligent, presumably because of my waiter role.She had used a neat social trick, which I noted for future use, but had made a factual error which Rod had not corrected.Perhaps one day he or she would make a clinical or research mistake as a result of this misunderstanding.Before I returned to the bar, I spoke to them again.There is no experimental evidence of a correlation between synapse numbers and intelligence level within primate populations.I recommend reading Williams and Herrup, Annual Review of Neuroscience.I hoped this would be helpful.Back at the bar, the cocktail orders caused some confusion.Only one of the three bar persons knew how to make a Rob Roy, and then only a conventional one.I gave her the instructions for the perfect version.Then there was an ingredient problem with the sage and pineapple margarita.The bar had pineapple (tinnedthe book had said fresh if possible, so I decided that this would be acceptable) but no sage.I headed for the kitchen, where they could not even offer me dried sage.Obviously this was not what The Bartenders Companion had called a well stocked bar, ready for any occasion.The kitchen staff were also busy, but we settled on coriander leaves and I took a quick mental inventory of the bars ingredients to avoid further problems of this kind.Rosie was also taking orders.We had not yet progressed to the stage of collecting glasses, and some people seemed to be drinking quite slowly.I realized that our chances would be improved if there was a high turnover of drinks.Unfortunately, I was unable to encourage faster consumption, as I would be violating my duty as the holder of a Responsible Service of Alcohol certificate.I decided to take a middle ground by reminding them of some of the delicious cocktails available.As I took orders, I observed a change in the dynamic of the ecosystem, evidenced by Rosies looking annoyed as she came past me.Table five wont let me take their order.They want to wait for you.It appeared that almost everyone wanted cocktails rather than wine.No doubt the proprietors would be pleased with the profit results.Unfortunately it appeared that staff numbers had been calculated on the basis that most orders would be for beer or wine, and the bar personnel were having trouble keeping up.Their knowledge of cocktails was surprisingly poor, and I was having to dictate recipes along with the orders.The solution to both problems was simple.Rosie went behind the bar to assist while I took all the orders myself.A good memory was a huge asset, as I did not need to write anything down or process just one table at a time.I took orders for the whole room, then relayed them back to the bar at consistent intervals.If people needed time to think, I left them and returned rather than waiting.I was actually running rather than walking, and increased my word rate to the maximum that I considered comprehensible.The process was very efficient and seemed to be appreciated by the diners, who would occasionally applaud when I was able to propose a drink to meet a particular requirement or replayed a tables orders when they were concerned that I might have misheard.People were finishing their drinks, and I found that I could swab three glasses between the dining room and the bar.The remainder I grouped together and indicated to Rosie as I left the tray on the bar, rapidly advising her of the owners names.She seemed a little pressured.I was enjoying myself immensely.I had the presence of mind to check the cream supplies before dessert was served.Predictably, the quantity was insufficient for the number of cocktails I expected to sell to complement the mango mousse and sticky date pudding.Rosie headed for the kitchen to find more.When I returned to the bar, one of the barmen called out to me, Ive got the boss on the phone.Hes bringing cream.Do you need anything else?I surveyed the shelves and made some predictions based on the ten most popular dessert cocktails.Brandy, Galliano, crme de menthe, Cointreau, advocaat, dark rum, light rum.Slow down, slow down, he said.I wasnt slowing down now.I was, as they say, on a roll.fifteen   The boss, a middle aged man (estimated BMI twenty seven), arrived with the additional supplies just in time for dessert and did some reorganization of the process behind the bar.Dessert was great fun, although it was hard to hear orders over the volume of conversation.I sold primarily the cream based cocktails, which most of the diners were unfamiliar with but responded to enthusiastically.As the food waiters cleared the dessert dishes, I made a rough mental calculation of our coverage.It depended a great deal on Rosie, but I believed we had samples from at least eighty five percent of the males.Good, but not optimum use of our opportunity.Having ascertained the names of the guests, I had determined that all but twelve of the Caucasian males from the graduation party were present.The missing twelve included Alan McPhee, unable to attend owing to death, but already eliminated by means of his daughters hairbrush.I headed for the bar, and Dr.Ralph Browning followed me.Can I bother you for another Cadillac?That was maybe the best drink Ive ever had.The bar staff were packing up, but the boss said to Rosie, Make the man a Cadillac.Jenny and Rod Broadhurst appeared from the dining room.Make that three, said Rod.The other bar personnel surrounded the owner, and there was a conversation.These guys have to go, said the boss to me, shrugging his shoulders.He turned to Rosie.Double time?Meanwhile, the diners were forming a throng around the bar, raising their hands for attention.Rosie handed a Cadillac to Dr.Browning, then turned to the boss.Sorry, I need at least two to stay.I cant run a bar for a hundred people by myself.Me and him, said the boss, pointing to me.Finally, I had a chance to use my expertise.Rosie lifted the hinged part of the bar and let me through.Dr.Miranda Ball raised her hand.Same again, please.I called to Rosie, loudly, as the bar area was now very noisy.Miranda Ball.Alabama slammer.One part each sloe gin, whisky, Galliano, triple sec, orange juice, orange slice, and a cherry.Were out of triple sec, yelled Rosie.Substitute Cointreau.Reduce the quantity by twenty percent.Dr.Lucas put his finished drink on the bar and raised his finger.One more.Gerry Lucas.Empty glass, I called.Rosie took the glass: I hoped she realized that we didnt have a sample for him yet.Another anal probe for Dr.Lucas.Got that, she called from the kitchen.Excellent, she had remembered to swab.Dr.Martin van Krieger called out, loudly, Is there a cocktail with Galliano and tequila?The crowd quieted.This sort of question had become common during dinner, and the guests had seemed impressed with my responses.I took a few moments to think.Martin called out again, Dont worry if there isnt.Im reindexing my internal database, I said, to explain the delay.It took a few moments.Mexican gold or Freddy Fudpucker.The crowd applauded.One of each, he said.Rosie knew how to make a Freddy Fudpucker.I gave the boss the Mexican gold recipe.We continued in this mode, with great success.I decided to take advantage of the opportunity to test all male doctors present, including those I had previously filtered out because of incompatible ethnic appearance.At 1:22 a. m.  I was confident that we had tested all but one person.It was time to be proactive.Dr.Anwar Khan.Approach the bar, please.It was an expression I had heard used on television.I hoped it carried the required authority.Dr.Khan had drunk only from his water glass and had carried it with him to the bar.You havent ordered a drink all night, I said.Is that a problem?I dont drink alcohol.Very wise, I said, although I was providing a bad example, with a beer open beside me.I recommend a virgin colada.Virgin Mary.Virgin  At this moment, Dr.Eva Gold put her arm around Dr.Khan.She was obviously affected by alcohol.Loosen up, Anwar.Dr.Khan looked back at her, and then at the crowd, who were, in my assessment, also exhibiting the effects of intoxication.What the hell, he said.Line up the virgins.He put his empty glass on the bar.I did not leave the golf club until very late.The last guests departed at 2:32 a. m. , two hours and two minutes after the scheduled completion time.Rosie, the boss, and I had made 143 cocktails.Rosie and the boss had also sold some beer, which I did not keep track of.You guys can go, said the boss.Well clean up in the morning.He extended his hand to me and I shook it according to custom, although it seemed very late for introductions.Amghad, he said.Nice work, guys.He didnt shake Rosies hand but looked at her and smiled.I noticed that she was looking a little tired.I was still full of energy.Got time for a drink?said Amghad.Excellent idea.Youve got to be kidding, said Rosie.Im going.All the stuffs in your bag.You dont want a lift, Don?I had my cycle and had only drunk three beers over the course of a long evening.I estimated that my blood alcohol would be well below the legal limit, even after a drink with Amghad.Rosie departed.Whats your poison?said Amghad.Poison?What do you want to drink?Of course.But why, why, why cant people just say what they mean?Beer, please.Amghad opened two pale ales and we clicked bottles.How long have you been doing this?he asked.Though some deception had been necessary for the purposes of the Father Project, I was not comfortable with it.This is my first work in the field, I said.Did I make some error?Amghad laughed.Funny guy.Listen, he said.This place here is okay, but its mostly steak and beer and midrange wine.Tonight was a one off, and mainly because of you.He drank some beer and looked at me without speaking for a while.Ive been thinking of opening in North Melbournea little cocktail bar with a bit of flair.New York feel, but something a bit extra behind the bar, if you know what I mean.If youre interested  He was offering me a job!This was flattering, considering my limited experience, and my immediate irrational thought was that I wished Rosie had been present to witness it.I already have a job.Thank you.Im not talking about a job.Im talking about a share in a business.No, thank you, I said.Im sorry.But I think you would find me unsatisfactory.Maybe, but Im a pretty good judge.Give me a call if you change your mind.Im in no hurry.The following day was Sunday.Rosie and I arranged to meet at the lab at 3:00 p. m.  She was predictably late, and I was already at work.I confirmed that we had obtained samples from all attendees at the reunion, meaning we had now tested all but eleven of the Caucasian males in the class.Rosie arrived in tight blue jeans and a white shirt and headed for the refrigerator.No beer until all samples are tested, I said.The work took some time, and I needed to source additional chemicals from the main laboratory.At 7:06 p. m.  Rosie went out for pizza, an unhealthy choice, but I had missed dinner the previous night and calculated that my body would be able to process the extra kilojoules.When she returned, I was testing the fourth to last candidate.As we were opening the pizza, my mobile phone rang.I realized immediately who it was.You didnt answer at home, said my mother.I was worried.This was a reasonable reaction on her part, as her Sunday phone call is part of my weekly schedule.Where are you?At work.Are you all right?Im fine.It was embarrassing to have Rosie listen to a personal conversation, and I did everything I could to terminate it quickly, keeping my responses as brief as possible.Rosie started laughingfortunately not loudly enough for my mother to hearand making funny faces.Your mother?she said, when I was finally able to hang up.Correct.How did you guess?You sound like any sixteen year old boy talking to his mum in front of She stopped.My annoyance must have been obvious.Or me talking to Phil.It was interesting that Rosie also found conversation with a parent difficult.My mother is a good person but very focused on sharing personal information.Rosie picked up a slice of pizza and looked at the computer screen.Im guessing no news.Plenty of news.Five more eliminated, only four to go.Including this one.The result had come up while I was on the phone.Delete Anwar Khan.Rosie updated the spreadsheet.Allah be praised.Worlds most complicated drink order, I reminded her.Dr.Khan had ordered five different drinks, compensating for his abstinence earlier in the evening.At the end of the night, he had left with his arm around Dr.Gold.Yeah, and I messed it up too.Put rum in the virgin colada.You gave him alcohol?I presumed this was in violation of his personal or religious standards.Maybe hell miss out on his seventy two virgins.I was familiar with this religious theory.My public position, as negotiated with the Dean, is that I regard all nonscience based beliefs as having equal merit.But I found this one curious.Seems irrational, I said, wanting virgins.Surely a woman with sexual experience would be preferable to a novice.Rosie laughed and opened two beers.Then she stared at me, in the way that I am not supposed to do to others.Amazing.You.Youre the most amazing person Ive ever met.I dont know why youre doing this, but thanks.She tapped her bottle against mine and drank.It was enjoyable to be appreciated, but this was exactly what I had been worried about when I spoke to Claudia.Now Rosie was asking about my motives.She had applied for the Wife Project and presumably had expectations on that basis.It was time to be honest.Presumably you think its in order to initiate a romantic relationship.The thought had crossed my mind, said Rosie.Assumption confirmed.Im extremely sorry if Ive created an incorrect impression.What do you mean?said Rosie.Im not interested in you as a partner.I should have told you earlier, but youre totally unsuitable.I tried to gauge Rosies reaction, but the interpretation of facial expressions is not one of my strengths.Well, youll be pleased to know I can cope.I think youre pretty unsuitable too, she said.This was a relief.I hadnt hurt her feelings.But it did leave a question unanswered.Then why did you apply for the Wife Project?I was using the word apply loosely, as Gene had not required Rosie to complete the questionnaire.But her answer suggested a more serious level of miscommunication.Wife Project?she said, as if she had never heard of it.
