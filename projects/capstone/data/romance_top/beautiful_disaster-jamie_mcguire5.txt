Throw me a bone, here!he teased.Finch leaned to the side of Travis and winked.Later, Cookie.When Travis turned to face me, his smile faded.Whats the frown for?I shook my head, trying to let the adrenaline run its course.I just dont like that nickname.It has some bad memories attached to it.Term of endearment from the youth minister?No, I grumbled.Travis punched his palm.Do you want me to go beat the piss out of Finch?Teach him a lesson?Ill take him out.I couldnt help but smile.If I wanted to take Finch out, Id just tell him Prada went out of business, and hed finish the job for me.Travis laughed, nudging toward the door.Lets go!Im wasting away, here!We sat at the lunch table together picking on each other with pinches and elbows to the ribs.Travis mood was as optimistic as the night I lost the bet.Everyone at the table noticed, and when he instigated a mini food fight with me, it garnered the attention of those sitting at the tables around us.I rolled my eyes.I feel like a zoo animal.Travis watched me for a moment, noted those staring, and then stood up.I CANT!he yelled.I stared in awe as the entire room jerked their heads in his direction.Travis bobbed his head a couple of times to a beat in his head.Shepley closed his eyes.Oh, no.Travis smiled.get no.satisfaction, he sang, I cant get no.sat is fac tion.Cuz Ive triedand Ive triedand Ive triedand Ive tried, he climbed onto the table as everyone stared, I CANT GET NO!He pointed to the football players at the end of the table and they smiled, I CANT GET NO!they yelled in unison.The whole room clapped to the beat, then.Travis sang into his fist, When Im drivin in my car, and a man comes on thera di ohes tellin me more and moreabout some useless in for ma tion!Supposed to fire my im agin a tion!I CANT GET NO!Uh no, no, no!He danced past me, singing into his imaginary microphone.The whole room chanted in harmony, HEY, HEY, HEY!Thats what Ill say!Travis sang.Travis jerked his hips, and a few whistles and squeals from the girls in the room fired off.He walked by me again, singing the chorus to the other side of the room, the football players his backup singers.Ill help you out!A girl yelled from the back.cuz I tried, and I tried, and I tried, he sang.I CANT GET NO!I CANT GET NO!his backups chanted.Travis stopped in front of me and bent down.When Im watchin my tvand aman comes on and tells me.how white my shirts can be!Well he cant be a man, cause he doesnt smoke.the same cigarettes as me!I cantget no!Uh no, no, no!Everyone clapped to the beat and the football players sang, HEY, HEY, HEY!Thats what I say!Travis sang, pointing to his clapping audience.Some people stood and danced with him, but most just watched with amused amazement.He jumped to the adjacent table and America squealed and clapped, elbowing me.I shook my head; I had died and woken up in High School Musical.The football players were humming the base line, Na, na, nanana!Na, na, na!Na na, nanana!Travis held his fist microphone high, When Imridin round the worldand Im doin thisand Im signin that!!He jumped down, and then leaned across the table into my face, And Im tryin to make some girl.tell me, uh baby better come back, maybe next week, cuz you see Im.On.A losin streak!I CANT GET NO!Uh no, no, no!The room clapped to the beat, the football team yelled their part, HEY, HEY, HEY!I cant get no!I cant get no!Satis faction!he crooned to me, smiling and breathless.The entire room exploded into applause, even a few whistles.I shook my after he kissed my forehead, and then stood up to take a bow.When he returned to his seat in front of me, he chuckled.Theyre not looking at you, now, are they?he panted.Thanks.You really shouldnt have, I smiled.Abs?I looked up to see Parker standing at the end of the table.All eyes were on me once again.We need to talk, Parker said, seeming nervous.I looked at America, Travis, and then to Parker.Please?he asked, shoving his hands in his pockets.I nodded, following him outside.He walked past the windows to the privacy of the side of the building.I didnt mean to draw attention to you again.I know how you hate that.Then you might have just called if you wanted to talk, I said.He nodded, looking to the ground.It wasnt my intention to find you in the cafeteria.I saw the commotion, and then you, and I just went in.Im sorry.I waited, and he spoke again, I dont know what happened with you and Travis.Its none of my businessyou and I have only been on a handful of dates.I was upset at first, but then I realized that it wouldnt have bothered me if I didnt have feelings for you.I didnt sleep with him, Parker.He held my hair while I hurled a pint of Petron in his toilet.Thats as romantic as it got.He laughed once.I dont think weve really gotten a fair shotnot with you living with Travis.The truth is, Abby, I like you.I dont know what it is, but I cant seem to stop thinking about you.I smiled and he took my hand, running his finger over my bracelet.I probably scared you off with this ridiculous present, but Ive never been in this situation before.I feel like Im constantly competing with Travis for your attention.You didnt scare me off with the bracelet.He pressed his lips together.Id like to take you out again in a couple of weeks, after your month is up with Travis.Then we can concentrate on getting to know each other without the distraction.Fair enough.He leaned down and closed his eyes, pressing his lips against mine.Ill call you soon.I waved goodbye, and then returned to the cafeteria, passing Travis.He grabbed me, pulling me onto his lap.Breakin up is hard to do?He wants to try again when Im back at Morgan.Shit, Im going to have to think of another bet, he said, pulling my plate in front of me.The next two weeks flew by.Other than class, I spent every waking moment with Travis, and most of that time we spent alone.He took me to dinner, for drinks and dancing at the Red, bowling, and he was called out to two fights.When we werent laughing ourselves silly, we were play wrestling, or snuggling on the couch with Toto, watching a movie.He made a point to ignore every girl that batted an eyelash at him, and everyone talked about the new Travis.My last night in the apartment, America and Shepley were inexplicably absent, and Travis labored over a special Last Night dinner.He bought wine, set out napkins, and even brought home new silverware for the occasion.He sat our plates on the breakfast bar and pulled his stool to the other side to sit across from me.For the first time, I got the distinct feeling we were on a date.This is really good, Trav.Youve been holding out on me, I said as I chewed the Cajun Chicken Pasta he had prepared.He forced a smile, and I could see he was working hard to keep the conversation light.If I told you before, you would have expected it every night.His smile faded, and his eyes fell to the table.I rolled my food around on my plate.Im going to miss you, too, Trav.Youre still gonna come over, right?You know I will.And youll be at Morgans, helping me study just like you did before.But it wont be the same, he sighed.Youll be dating Parker, were going to get busygo in different directions.Its not going to change that much.He managed a single laugh.Who would have thought from the first time we met that wed be sitting here?You couldnt have told me three months ago that Id be this miserable over saying goodbye to a girl.My stomach sank.I dont want you to be miserable.Then dont go, he said.His expression was so desperate that the guilt formed a lump in my throat.I cant move in here, Travis.Thats crazy.Says who?I just had the best two weeks of my life.Me, too.Then why do I feel like Im never gonna see you again?I didnt have a reply.His jaws tensed, but he wasnt angry.The urge to go to him grew insistent, so I stood up and walked around the bar, sitting on his lap.He didnt look at me, so I hugged his neck, pressing my cheek against his.Youre going to realize what a pain in the ass I was, and then youll forget all about missing me, I said into his ear.He puffed a breath of air as he rubbed my back.Promise?I leaned back and looked into his eyes, touching each side of his face with my hands.I caressed his jaw with my thumb; his expression was heartbreaking.I closed my eyes and leaned down to kiss the corner of his mouth, but he turned so that I caught more of his lips than Id intended.Even though the kiss surprised me, I didnt pull back right away.Travis kept his lips on mine, but he didnt take it any further.I finally pulled away, playing it off with a smile.I have a big day tomorrow.Im going to clean up the kitchen, and then Im going to head to bed.Ill help you, he said.We did the dishes together in silence, with Toto asleep at our feet.He dried the last dish and set it in the rack, and then led me down the hall, holding my hand a bit too tight.The distance from the mouth of the hallway to his bedroom door seemed to take twice as long.We both knew that goodbye was just a few hours away.He didnt even try to pretend not to watch this time as I changed into one of his t shirts for bed.He stripped down to his boxers, and climbed under the blanket, waiting for me to join him.One I did, Travis flipped off the lamp, and then pulled me against him without permission or apology.He tensed his arms and sighed, and I nestled my face into his neck.I shut my eyes tight, trying to savor the moment.I knew I would wish for that moment back every day of my life, so I lived it with everything I had.He looked out the window.The trees cast a shadow across his face.Travis clenched his eyes shut, and a sinking feeling settled over me.It was agonizing seeing him suffer, knowing that not only was I the cause of itI was the only one that could take it away.Trav?Are you okay?I asked.There was a long pause before he finally spoke.Ive never been less okay in my life.I pressed my forehead against his neck, and he squeezed me tighter.This is silly, I said.Were going to see each other every day.You know thats not true.The weight of the grief we both felt was crushing, and an irrepressible need came over me to save us both.I lifted my chin, but hesitated; what I was about to do would change everything.I reasoned that Travis didnt see intimacy as anything but a way to pass the time, and I shut my eyes again and swallowed back my fears.I had to do something, knowing we would both lay awake, dreading every passing minute until morning.My heart pounded as I touched his neck with my lips, and then tasted his flesh in a slow, tender kiss.He looked down with surprise, and then his eyes softened with the realization of what I wanted.He leaned down, pressing his lips against mine with a delicate sweetness.The warmth from his lips traveled all the way to my toes, and I pulled him closer to me.Now that we had taken the first step, I had no intention of stopping there.I parted my lips, letting Travis tongue find its way to mine.I want you, I said.Suddenly, the kiss slowed, and he tried to pull away.Determined to finish what I had started, my mouth worked against his more anxiously.In reaction, Travis backed away until he was on his knees.I rose with him, keeping our mouths melded together.He gripped each of my shoulders to hold me at bay.Wait a sec, he whispered with an amused smile, breathing hard.You dont have to do this, Pidge.This isnt what tonight is about.He was holding back, but I could see it in his eyes that his self control wouldnt last long.I leaned in again, and this time his arms gave way just enough for me to brush my lips against his.Dont make me beg, I whispered against his mouth.With those four words, his reservations vanished.He kissed me, hard and eager.My fingers ran down the length of his back and settled on the elastic of his boxers, nervously running along the gather of the fabric.His lips grew impatient, then, and I fell against the mattress when he crashed into me.His tongue found its way to mine once again, and when I gained the courage to slide my hand between his skin and the boxers, he groaned.Travis yanked the t shirt over my head, and then his hand impatiently traveled down my side, gripping my panties and slipping them down my legs with one hand.His mouth returned to mine once more as his hand slid up the inside of my thigh, and I let out a long, faltering breath when his fingers wandered where no man had touched me before.My knees arched and twitched with each movement of his hand, and when I dug my fingers into his flesh, he positioned himself above me.Pigeon, he said, panting, it doesnt have to be tonight.Ill wait until youre ready.I looked above my head and reached for the top drawer of his night stand, pulling it open.Feeling the plastic between my fingers, I touched the corner to my mouth, tearing the package open with my teeth.His free hand left my back, and then pulled his boxers down, kicking them off as if he couldnt stand them between us.The package crackled in his fingertips, and after a few moments, I felt him between my thighs.I closed my eyes.Look at me, Pigeon.I peered up at him, and his eyes were intent and soft at the same time.He tilted his head, leaning down to kiss me tenderly, and then his body tensed, pushing himself inside of me in a small, slow movement.When he pulled back, I bit my lip with the discomfort; when he rocked into me again, I clenched my eyes shut with the pain.My thighs tightened around his hips, and he kissed me again.Look at me, he whispered.When I opened my eyes, he pressed inside me again, and I cried out with the wonderful burning it caused.Once I relaxed, the motion of his body against mine was more rhythmic.The nervousness I had felt in the beginning had disappeared, and Travis grabbed at my flesh as if he couldnt get enough.I pulled him into me, and he moaned when the way it felt became too much.Ive wanted you for so long, Abby.Youre all I want, he breathed against my mouth.He grabbed my thigh with one hand and propped himself up with his elbow, just inches above me.A thin sheet of sweat began to bead on our skin, and I arched my back as his lips traced my jaw and then followed a single line down my neck.Travis, I sighed.When I said his name, he pressed his cheek against mine, and his movements became more rigid.The noises from his throat grew louder, and he finally pressed inside me one last time, groaning and quivering above me.After a few moments, he relaxed, and let his breathing slow.That was some first kiss, I said with a tired, content expression.He scanned my face and smiled.Your last first kiss.I was too shocked to reply.He collapsed beside me on his stomach, stretching one arm across my middle, and resting his forehead against my cheek.I ran my fingers along the bare skin of his back until I heard his breathing even out.I lay awake for hours, listening to Travis deep breaths and the wind weave through the trees outside.America and Shepley came in the front door quietly, and I heard them tip toe down the hall, murmuring to each other.We had packed my things earlier in the day, and I flinched at how uncomfortable the morning would be.I had thought once Travis slept with me his curiosity would be satiated, but instead he was talking about forever.My eyes snapped shut with the thought of his expression when he learned that what had happened between us wasnt a beginning, it was closure.I couldnt go down that road, and he would hate me when I told him.I maneuvered out from under his arm and got dressed, carrying my shoes with me down the hall to Shepleys room.America sat on the bed, and Shepley was pulling off his shirt in front of the closet.Everything okay, Abby?Shepley asked.Mare?I said, signaling for her to join me in the hall.She nodded, watching me with cautious eyes.Whats going on?I need you to take me to Morgan now.I cant wait til tomorrow.One side of her mouth turned up with a knowing smile.You never could handle goodbyes.Shepley and America helped me with my bags, and I stared out the window of Americas car on my journey back to Morgan Hall.When we set down the last of the bags in my room, America grabbed me.Its going to be so different in the apartment, now.Thanks for bringing me home.The sun will be up in a few hours.You better go, I said, squeezing once before letting go.America didnt look back when she left my room, and I chewed my lip nervously, knowing how angry she would be when she realized what Id done.My shirt crackled as I pulled it over my head, the static in the air had intensified with the coming winter.Feeling a bit lost, I curled into a ball underneath my thick comforter, and inhaled through my nose; Travis scent still lingered on my skin.The bed felt cold and foreign, a sharp contrast to the warmth of Travis mattress.I had spent thirty days in a cramped apartment with Easterns most infamous tramp, and after all the bickering and late night houseguests, it was the only place I wanted to be.The phone calls began at eight in the morning, and then every five minutes for an hour.Abby!Kara groaned.Answer your stupid phone!I reached over and turned it off.It wasnt until I heard the banging on the door that I realized I wouldnt be allowed to spend the day holed up in my room as planned.Kara yanked on the knob.What?America pushed past her, and stood beside my bed.What in the hell is going on?she yelled.Her eyes were red and puffy, and she was still in her pajamas.I sat up.What, Mare?Travis is a fucking wreck!He wont talk to us, hes trashed the apartment, threw the stereo across the roomShep cant talk any sense into him!I rubbed my eyes with the heels of my hand, and blinked.I dont know.Bullshit!Youre going to tell me what in the hell is going on, and youre going to tell me now!Kara grabbed her shower bag and fled.She slammed the door behind her, and I frowned, afraid she would tell the resident advisor, or worse, the Dean of Students.Keep it down, America, Jesus, I whispered.She clenched her teeth.What did you do?I assumed he would be upset with me; I didnt know hed fly into a rage.Idont know, I swallowed.He took a swing at Shep when he found out we helped you leave.Abby!Please tell me!she pleaded, her eyes glossing over.Its scaring me!The fear in her eyes forced only the partial truth.I just couldnt say goodbye.You know its hard for me.Its something else, Abby.Hes gone fucking nuts!I heard him call your name, and then he stomped all over the apartment looking for you.He barged into Sheps room, demanding to know where you were.Then he tried to call you.Over, and over and over, she sighed.His face wasJesus, Abby.Ive never seen him like that.He ripped his sheets off the bed, and threw them away, threw his pillows away, shattered his mirror with his fist, kicked his doorbroke it from the hinges!It was the scariest thing Ive ever seen in my life!I closed my eyes, forcing the tears that pooled in my eyes down my cheeks.America thrust her cell phone at me.You have to call him.You have to at least tell him your okay.Okay, Ill call him.She shoved her phone at me again.No, youre calling him now.I took her phone in my hand and fingered the buttons, trying to imagine what I could possibly say to him.She snatched it out of my hand, dialed, and then handed it to me.I held the phone to my ear, and took a deep breath.Mare?Travis answered, his voice thick with worry.Its me.The line was quiet for several moments before he finally spoke.What the fuck happened to you last night?I wake up this morning, and youre gone and youyou just leave and dont say goodbye?Why?Im sorry.I,  Youre sorry?Ive been going crazy!You dont answer your phone, you sneak out and, whawhy?I thought we finally had everything figured out!I just needed some time to think.About what?he paused.Did I hurt you?No!Its nothing like that!Im reallyreally sorry.Im sure America told you.I dont do goodbyes.I need to see you, he said, his voice desperate.I sighed.I have a lot to do today, Trav.I have to unpack and I have piles of laundry.You regret it, he said, his voice breaking.Its notthats not what it is.Were friends.Thats not going to change.Friends?Then what the fuck was last night?he said, anger bleeding through his voice.I closed my eyes tight.I know what you want.I just cantdo that right now.So you just need some time?he asked in a calmer voice.You could have told me that.You didnt have to run out on me.It just seemed like the easiest way.Easier for who?I couldnt sleep.I kept thinking about what it would be like in the morning, loading Mares car andI couldnt do it, Trav, I said.Its bad enough that you arent going to be here anymore.You cant just drop out of my life.I forced a smile.Ill see you tomorrow.I dont want anything to be weird, okay?I just need to sort some stuff out.Thats all.Okay, he said.I can do that.I hung up the phone, and America glared at me.You SLEPT with him?You bitch!You werent even going to tell me?I rolled my eyes and fell against the pillow.This isnt about you, Mare.This has just become one convoluted clusterfuck.Whats so difficult about it?You two should be deliriously happy, not breaking doors and hiding in your room!I cant be with him, I whispered, keeping my eyes on the ceiling.Her hand covered mine, and she spoke softly.Travis needs work.Trust me, I understand any and all reservations you have about him, but look how much hes already changed for you.Think about the last two weeks, Abby.Hes not Mick.Im Mick!I get involved with Travis and everything weve worked forpoof!I snapped my fingers.Just like that!Travis wouldnt let that happen.Its not up to him, now is it?Youre going to break his heart, Abby.Youre going to break his heart!The one girl he trusts enough to fall for, and youre going to nail him to the wall!I turned away from her, unable to see the expression that went with the pleading tone in her voice.I need the happy ending.Thats why we came here.You dont have to do this.It could work.Until my luck runs out.America threw up her hands, letting them fall into her lap.Jesus, Abby, not this shit again.We talked about this.My phone rang, and I looked at the display.Its Parker.She shook her head.Were still talking.Hello?I answered, avoiding Americas glare.Abs!Day one of freedom!How does it feel?he said.It feelsfree, I said, unable to muster up any enthusiasm.Dinner tomorrow night?Ive missed you.Yeah, I wiped my nose with my sleeve.Tomorrows great.After I hung up the phone, America frowned.Hes going to ask me when I get back, she said.Hes going to want to know what we talked about.What am I supposed to tell him?Tell him that Ill keep my promise.By this time tomorrow, he wont miss me.Two tables over, one table back.America and Shepley were barely visible from my seat, and I hunched over, watching Travis stare at the empty chair I usually occupied before sitting at the end of the lunch table.I felt ridiculous for hiding, but I wasnt prepared to sit across from him for an entire hour.When I finished my meal, I took a deep breath and walked outside to where Travis was finishing his cigarette.I had spent most of the night trying to form a plan to get us to where we were before.If I treated our encounter the way he regarded sex in general, I would have a better chance.The plan risked losing him altogether, but I hoped his enormous male ego would force him to play it off the same way.Hey, I smiled.He grimaced.Hey.I thought youd be at lunch.I had to run in and out, I have to study, I shrugged, doing my best impression of casual.Need some help?Its Calculus.I think Ive got it handled.I can just hang out for moral support he smiled, digging his hand into his pocket.The solid muscles in his arm tensed with the movement, and the thought of them flexing as he thrust himself inside me replayed with vivid detail in my head.Erwhat?I asked, disoriented from the sudden erotic thought that had flashed in my mind.Are we supposed to pretend the other night never happened?No, why?I feigned confusion and he sighed, frustrated with my behavior.I dont knowbecause I took your virginity?He leaned toward me, saying the words in a hushed voice.I rolled my eyes.Im sure its not the first time youve deflowered a virgin, Trav.Just as I had feared, my casual demeanor made him angry.As a matter of fact, it was.CmonI said I didnt want any weirdness between us.Travis took one last drag of his cigarette and flicked it to the ground.Well, if Ive learned anything in the last few days, its that you dont always get what you want.Hey, Abs, Parker said, kissing my cheek.Travis glowered at Parker with a murderous expression.Ill pick you up around six?Parker said.I nodded.Six.See you in a bit, he said, continuing to class.I watched him walk away, afraid to endure the consequences of the last ten seconds.Youre going out with him tonight?Travis seethed.His jaw was clenched, and I could see it working under his skin.I told you he was going to ask me out after I got back to Morgan.He called me yesterday.Things have changed a little bit since that conversation, dont you think?Why?He walked away from me, and I swallowed, trying to keep the tears at bay.Travis stopped and came back, leaning into my face.Thats why you said I wouldnt miss you after today!You knew Id find out about you and Parker, and you thought Id justwhat?Get over you?Do you not trust me, or am I just not good enough?Tell me, damn it!Tell me what the fuck I did to you to make you do this!I stood my ground, staring straight into his eyes.You didnt do anything to me.Since when is sex so life or death to you?Since it was with you!I glanced around, seeing that we were making a scene.People were walking by slowly, staring and whispering to each other.I felt my ears burn, and it spread across my face, making my eyes water.He closed his eyes, trying to compose himself before he spoke again.Is that it?You dont think it meant anything to me?You are Travis Maddox.He shook his head, disgusted.If I didnt know any better, Id think you were shoving my past in my face.I dont think four weeks ago constitutes the past.His face contorted and I laughed.Im kidding!Travis, its fine.Im fine, youre fine.Theres no need to make a big deal of it.All emotion disappeared from his face and he took a deep breath through his nose.I know what youre trying to do.His eyes unfocused for a moment, lost in thought.Ill just have to prove it to you, then.His eyes narrowed as he looked into my eyes, determined as he was before one of his fights.If you think Im just going to go back to fucking around, youre wrong.I dont want anyone else.You wanna be friends?Fine, were friends.But you and I both know that what happened wasnt just sex.He stormed past me and I closed my eyes, exhaling the breath I didnt know Id been holding.Travis glanced back at me, and then continued to his next class.An escaping tear fell down my cheek and I quickly wiped it away.The curious stares of my classmates targeted my back as I plodded to class.Parker was on the second row, and I slid into the desk next to him.A grin stretched across his face.Im looking forward to tonight.I took a breath and smiled, trying to change gears from my conversation with Travis.Whats the plan?Well, Im all settled in my apartment.I thought wed have dinner there.Im looking forward to tonight, too, I said, trying to convince myself.With Americas refusal to help, Kara was a reluctant assistant to aid me in choosing a dress for my date with Parker.As soon as I pulled it on over my head, I yanked it off and slipped on a pair of jeans instead.After brooding about my failed plan all afternoon, I couldnt talk myself into dressing up.Keeping the cool weather in mind, I pulled on an thin, ivory cashmere sweater over a brown tank top, and waited by the door.When Parkers shiny Porsche pulled in front of Morgan, I pushed my way out the door before he had time to make it up the walk.I was going to come get you, he said, disappointed as he held open the door.Then I saved you a trip, I said, buckling my seat belt.He slid in beside me and leaned over, touching each side of my face, kissing me with his plush, soft lips.Wow, he breathed, Ive missed your mouth.His breath was minty, his cologne smelled incredible, his hands were warm and soft, and he looked fantastic in his jeans and green dress shirt, but I couldnt shake the feeling that something was missing.That excitement I had in the beginning was noticeably absent, and I silently cursed Travis for taking that away.I forced a smile.Im going to take that as a compliment.His apartment was exactly as I had imagined: Immaculate, with expensive electronics in every corner, and most likely decorated by his mother.So?What do you think?he said, grinning like a child showing off a new toy.Its great, I nodded.His expression changed from playful to intimate, and he pulled me into his arms, kissing my neck.Every muscle in my body tensed.I wanted to be anywhere than in that apartment.My cell phone rang, and I offered him an apologetic smile before answering.Hows the date goin, Pidge?I turned my back to Parker and whispered into the phone.What do you need, Travis?I tried to make my tone sharp, but it was softened by my relief to hear his voice.I wanna go bowling tomorrow.I need my partner.Bowling?You couldnt have called me later?I felt like a hypocrite for saying the words, knowing I had hoped for an excuse to keep Parkers lips off of me.How am I supposed to know when youre gonna get done?Oh.That didnt come out right he trailed off, sounding amused with himself.Ill call you tomorrow and we can talk about it then, okay?No, its not okay.You said you wanna be friends, but we cant hang out?I rolled my eyes, and Travis huffed.Dont roll your eyes at me.Are you coming or not?How did you know I rolled my eyes?Are you stalking me?I asked, noting the drawn curtains.You always roll your eyes.Yes?No?Youre wasting precious date time.He knew me so well.I fought the urge to ask him to pick me up right then.I couldnt help but smile at the thought.Yes!I said in a hushed voice, trying not to laugh.Ill go.Ill pick you up at seven.I turned to Parker, grinning like the Cheshire Cat.Travis?he asked with a knowing expression.Yes, I frowned, caught.Youre still just friends?Still just friends, I nodded once.We sat at the table, eating Chinese take out.I warmed up to him after awhile, and he reminded me of how charming he was.I felt lighter, almost giggly, a marked change from earlier.As hard as I tried to push the thought from my head, I couldnt deny that it was my plans with Travis that had brightened my mood.After dinner, we sat on the couch to watch a movie, but before the beginning credits were over, Parker had me on my back.I was glad I had chosen to wear jeans; I wouldnt have been able to fend him off as easily in a dress.His lips traveled down to my collarbone, and his hand stopped at my belt.He clumsily worked to pull it open, and once it popped, I slid out from under him to stand up.Okay!I think a single is all youll be hitting tonight, I said, buckling my belt.What?First base.second base?Never mind.Its late, I better go.He sat up and gripped my legs.Dont go, Abs.I dont want you to think thats why I brought you here.Isnt it?Of course not, he said, pulling me onto his lap.Youre all Ive thought about for two weeks.I apologize for being impatient.He kissed my cheek, and I leaned into him, smiling when his breath tickled my neck.I turned to him and pressed my lips against his, trying my hardest to feel something  but I didnt.I pulled away from him and sighed.Parker furrowed his brow.I said I was sorry.I said it was late.We drove to Morgan, and Parker squeezed my hand after he kissed me goodnight.Lets try again.Biasettis tomorrow?I pressed my lips together.Im bowling with Travis tomorrow.Wednesday, then?Wednesdays great, I said, offering a contrived smile.Parker shifted in his seat.He was working up to something.Abby?Theres a date party in a couple weekends at the House.I inwardly cringed, dreading the discussion we would inevitably have.What?he asked, chuckling nervously.I cant go with you, I said, letting myself out of the car.He followed, meeting me at the Morgan entrance.You have plans?I winced.I have plansTravis already asked me.Travis asked you what?To the date party, I explained, a bit frustrated.Parkers face flushed, and he shifted his weight.Youre going to the date party with Travis?He doesnt go to those things.And youre just friends.It doesnt make sense for you to go with him.America wouldnt go with Shep unless I went.He relaxed.Then you can go with me, he smiled, intertwining his fingers in mine.I grimaced at his solution.I cant cancel with Travis, and then go with you.I dont see the problem, he shrugged.You can be there for America, and Travis will get out of having to go.He is a staunch advocate for doing away with date parties.He thinks its a platform for our girlfriends to force us to declare a relationship.It was me that didnt want to go.He talked me into it.Now you have an excuse, he shrugged.He was maddeningly confident that I was going to change my mind.I didnt want to go at all.Parkers patience had run out.I just want to be clear; you dont want to go to the date party.Travis wants to go, he asked you, and you wont cancel with him to go with me, even though you didnt want to go in the first place?I had a hard time meeting his glare.I cant do that to him, Parker, Im sorry.Do you understand what a date party is?Its something you go to with your boyfriend.His patronizing tone made any empathy Id felt for him disappear.Well, I dont have a boyfriend, so technically I shouldnt go at all.I thought we were going to try again.I thought we had something.I am trying.What do you expect me to do?Sit at home alone while youre at my fraternitys date party with someone else?Should I ask another girl?You can do what you want, I said, irritated with his threat.He looked up and shook his head.I dont want to ask another girl.I dont expect you not to go to your own party.Ill see you there.You want me to ask someone else?And youre going with Travis.Do you not see how completely absurd that is?I crossed my arms, ready for a fight.I told him I would go before you and I ever went out, Parker.I cant cancel on him.You cant, or you dont want to?Same difference.Im sorry that you dont understand.I pulled the door open to Morgan, and Parker put his hand on mine.All right, he sighed in resignation.This is obviously an issue Im going to have to work through.Travis is one of your best friends, I do understand that.I dont want it to affect our relationship.Okay?Okay, I said, nodding.He opened the door and gestured me to walk through, kissing my cheek before I walked inside.See you Wednesday at six?Six, I smiled, waving as I walked up the stairs.America was walking out of the shower room when I turned the corner, and her eyes brightened when she recognized me.Hey, chickie!Howd it go?It went, I said, deflated.Uh oh.Dont tell Travis, okay?She huffed.I wont.What happened?Parker asked me to the date party.America tightened her towel.Youre not bailing on Trav, are you?No, and Parkers not happy about it.Understandable, she said, nodding.Its also too damn bad.America pulled the strands of her long, wet hair over one shoulder, and drops of water trickled down her bare skin.She was a walking contradiction.She applied to Eastern so we could move together.She was my self proclaimed conscience, intent on stepping in when I gave into my imbedded tendencies to fly off track.It went against everything we talked about for me to get involved with Travis, and she had become his overly enthusiastic cheerleader.I leaned against the wall.Would you be mad if I didnt go at all?No, I would be unbelievably and irrevocably pissed off.Thats grounds for a full blown cat fight, Abby.Then I guess Im going, I said, shoving my key in the lock.My cell phone rang, and a picture of Travis making a funny face appeared on the display.Hello?You home, yet?Yeah, he dropped me off about five minutes ago.Ill be there in five more.Wait!Travis?I said after hed hung up.America laughed.You just had a disappointing date with Parker, and you smiled when Travis called.Are you really that dense?I didnt smile, I protested.Hes coming here.Will you meet him outside and tell him I went to bed?You did, too, and nogo tell him yourself.Yes, Mare, me going out there to tell him Im in bed is so gonna work.She turned her back to me, walking to her room.I threw up my hands, letting them fall to my thighs.Mare!Please?Have fun, Abby, she smiled, disappearing into her room.I walked down the stairs to see Travis on his motorcycle, parked at the front steps.He wore a white t shirt with black artwork, setting off the tattoos on his arms.Arent you cold?I asked, tugging my jacket tighter.You look nice.Did you have a good time?Uhyeah, thanks, I said, distracted.What are you doing here?He pulled back the throttle, and the engine snarled.I was going to take a ride to clear my head.I want you to come with me.Its cold, Trav.You want me to go get Sheps car?Were going bowling tomorrow.Cant you wait until then?I went from being with you every second of the day to seeing you for ten minutes if Im lucky.I smiled and shook my head.Its only been two days, Trav.I miss you.Get your ass on the seat and lets go.I couldnt argue.I missed him, too.More than I would ever admit to him.I zipped up my jacket and climbed on behind him, slipping my fingers through the belt loops of his jeans.He pulled my wrists to his chest and then folded them across one another.Once he was satisfied that I was holding him tightly enough, he took off, racing down the road.I rested my cheek against his back and closed my eyes, breathing in his scent.It reminded me of his apartment, and his sheets, and the way he smelled when he walked around with a towel around his waist.The city blurred past us, and I didnt care how fast he was driving, or how cold the wind was as it whipped across my skin; I wasnt even paying attention to where we were.The only thing I could think about was his body against mine.We had no destination or time frame, and we drove the streets long after they had been abandoned by everyone but us.Travis pulled into a gas station and parked.You want anything?he asked.I shook my head, climbing off the bike to stretch my legs.He watched me rake my fingers through the tangles in my hair, and smiled.Quit it.Youre fucking beautiful.Just point me to the nearest eighties rock video, I said.He laughed, and then yawned, swatting at the moths that buzzed around him.The nozzle clicked, sounding louder than it should in the quiet night.We seemed to be the only two people on earth.I pulled out my cell phone to check the time.Oh my God, Trav.Its three in the morning.You wanna go back?he asked, his face shadowed with disappointment.I pressed my lips together.We better.Were still going bowling tonight?I told you I would.And youre still going to Sig Tau with me in a couple weeks, right?Are you insinuating that I dont follow through?I find that a little insulting.He pulled the nozzle from his tank and hooked it on its base.I just never know what youre going to do anymore.He sat on his bike and helped me to climb on behind him.I hooked my fingers in his belt loops and then thought better of it, wrapping my arms around him.He sighed and leaned the bike upright, reluctant to start the engine.His knuckles turned white as he gripped the handle bars.He took a breath, beginning to speak, and then shook his head.Youre important to me, you know, I said, squeezing him.I dont understand you, Pigeon.I thought I knew women, but youre so fucking confusing I dont know which way is up.I dont understand you, either.Youre supposed to be Easterns ladies man.Im not getting the full freshmen experience they promised in the brochure, I teased.Well, thats a first.Ive never had a girl sleep with me to get me to leave her alone, he said, keeping his back to me.Thats not what it was, Travis, I lied, ashamed that he had guessed my intentions without realizing how right he was.He shook his head and started the engine, pulling out onto the street.He drove uncharacteristically slow, stopping at all the yellow lights, taking the long way to campus.When we pulled in front of the entrance of Morgan Hall, the same sadness I felt the night I left the apartment consumed me.It knew it was ridiculous to be so emotional, but each time I did something to push him away, I was terrified it would work.He walked me to the door, and I pulled out my keys, avoiding his eyes.As I fumbled with the metal in my hand, his hand was suddenly at my chin, his thumb softly touching my lips.Did he kiss you?he asked.I pulled away, surprised that his fingers caused a burning feeling that seared every nerve from my mouth to my toes.You really know how to screw up a perfect night, dont you?You thought it was perfect, huh?Does that mean you had a good time?I always do when Im with you.He looked to the ground and his eyebrows pulled together.Did he kiss you?Yes, I sighed, irritated.His eyes closed tight.Is that all?That is none of your business!I said, yanking open the door.Travis pushed it closed and stood in my way, his expression apologetic.I need to know.No you dont!Move, Travis!Pigeon,  You think because Im no longer a virgin, Ill screw anyone thatll have me?Thanks!I said, shoving him.I didnt say that, damn it!Is it too much to ask for a little peace of mind?Why would it give you peace of mind to know if Im sleeping with Parker?How can you not know?Its obvious to everyone else but you!he said, exasperated.I guess Im just an idiot, then.Youre on a roll tonight, Trav, I said, reaching for the door handle.He gripped my shoulders.The way I feel about youits crazy.You got the crazy part right, I snapped, pulling away from him.I practiced this in my head the whole time we were on the bike, so just hear me out, he said.Travis,  I know were fucked up, all right?Im impulsive, and hot tempered, and you get under my skin like no one else.You act like you hate me one minute, and then you need me the next.I never get anything right, and I dont deserve youbut I fucking love you, Abby.I love you more than Ive loved anyone or anything, ever.When youre around, I dont need booze, or money, or the fighting, or the one night standsall I need is you.Youre all I think about.Youre all I dream about.Youre all I want.My plan to feign ignorance was an epic fail.I couldnt pretend to be impervious when he had laid all of his cards on the table.When we met, something inside both of us had changed, and whatever that was, it made us need each other.For reasons unknown to me, I was his exception, and as much as I had tried to fight my feelings, he was mine.He shook his head, cupped each side of my face, and looked into my eyes.Did you sleep with him?Hot tears filled my eyes as I shook my head no.He slammed his lips against mine, and his tongue entered my mouth without hesitation.Unable to control myself, I gripped his shirt in my fists, and pulled him to me.He hummed in his amazing, deep voice, and gripped me so tight that it was difficult to breathe.He pulled back, breathless.Call Parker.Tell him you dont wanna see him anymore.Tell him youre with me.I closed my eyes.I cant be with you, Travis.Why the hell not?he said, letting go.I shook my head, afraid of his reaction to the truth.He laughed once.Unbelievable.The one girl I want, and she doesnt want me.I swallowed, knowing I would have to get closer to the truth than I had in months.When America and I moved out here, it was with the understanding that my life was going to turn out a certain way.Or, that it wouldnt turn out a certain way.The fighting, the gambling, the drinkingits what I left behind.When Im around youits all right there for me in an irresistible, tattooed package.I didnt move hundreds of miles away to live it all over again.He pulled my chin up so that I would face him.I know you deserve better than me.You think I dont know that?But if there was any woman made for meits you.Ill do whatever I have to do, Pidge.Do you hear me?Ill do anything.I turned away from his grip, ashamed that I couldnt tell him the truth.I was the one that wasnt good enough.I would be the one to ruin everything; to ruin him.He would hate me one day, and I couldnt see the look in his eye when he came to that conclusion.He held the door shut with his hand.Ill stop fighting the second I graduate.I wont drink a single drop again.Ill give you the happy ever after, Pigeon.If you just believe in me, I can do it.I dont want you to change.Then tell me what to do.Tell me and Ill do it, he pleaded.Any thoughts of being with Parker were long gone, and I knew it was because of my feelings for Travis.I thought about the different paths my life would take from that moment  trusting Travis with a leap of faith and risking the unknown, or pushing him away and knowing exactly where I would end up, which included a life without him  either decision terrified me.Can I borrow your phone?I asked.Travis pulled his brows together, confused.Sure, he said, pulling his phone from his pocket, handing it to me.I dialed, and then closed my eyes as it rang in my ear.Travis?What the hell?Do you know what time it is?Parker answered.His voice was deep and raspy, and I instantly felt my heart vibrating in my chest.It hadnt occurred to me that he would know I had called from Travis phone.My next words somehow found their way to my trembling lips.Im sorry for calling you so early, but this couldnt wait.Icant go to dinner with you on Wednesday.Its almost four in the morning, Abby.Whats going on?I cant see you at all, actually.Abs.Impretty sure Im in love with Travis, I said, bracing for his reaction.After a few moments of shocked silence, he hung up in my ear.My eyes still focused on the pavement, I handed Travis his phone, and then reluctantly peered up at his expression.A combination of confusion, shock, and adoration scrolled across his face.He hung up, I grimaced.He scanned my face with careful hope in his eyes.You love me?Its the tattoos, I shrugged.A wide smile stretched across his face, making his dimple sink into his cheek.Come home with me, he said, enveloping me in his arms.My eyebrows shot up.You said all that to get me in bed?I must have made quite an impression.The only thing Im thinking about right now is holding you in my arms all night.Lets go, I smiled.Despite the excessive speed and the shortcuts, the ride to the apartment seemed endless.When we finally arrived, Travis carried me up the stairs.I giggled against his lips as he fumbled to unlock the door.When he set me on my feet and closed the door behind us, he let out a long, relieved sigh.It hasnt seemed like home since you left, he said, kissing my lips.Toto scampered down the hall and wagged his tiny tail, pawing at my legs.I cooed at him as I lifted him off the floor.Shepleys bed squeaked, and then his feet stomped across the floor.His door flew open as he squinted from the light.Fuck no, Trav, youre not pulling this shit!Youre in love with Ab, his eyes focused and he recognized his mistake, by.Hey, Abby.Hey, Shep, I smiled, setting Toto on the floor.Travis pulled me past his still shocked cousin, and kicked the door shut behind us, pulling me into his arms and kissing me without a second thought, as if we had done it a million times before.I pulled his shirt over his head, and he slipped my jacket off my shoulders.I stopped kissing him long enough to remove my sweater and tank top, and then crashed into him again.We undressed each other, and within seconds he lowered me to his mattress.I reached above my head to pull open the drawer and plunged my hand inside, searching for anything that crackled.Shit, he said, panting and frustrated.I got rid of them.What?All of them?I breathed.I thought you didntif I wasnt with you, I wasnt going to need them.Youre kidding me!I said, letting my head fall against the headboard.His forehead fell against my chest.Consider yourself the opposite of a foregone conclusion.I smiled, and kissed him.Youve never been with anyone without one?He shook his head.Never.I looked around for a moment, lost in thought.He laughed once at my expression.What are you doing?Ssh, Im counting.Travis watched me for a moment, and then leaned down to kiss my neck.I cant concentrate while youre doing tha I sighed, the twenty fifth and two days, I breathed.Travis chuckled.What the hell are you talkin about?Were good, I said, sliding down so I was directly beneath him.He pressed his chest against mine, and kissed me tenderly.Are you sure?I let my hands glide from his shoulders to his backside and pulled him against me.He closed his eyes, and let out a long, deep groan.Oh my God, Abby, he breathed.He rocked into me again, another hum emanating from his throat.Holy shit, you feel amazing.Is it different?He looked into my eyes.Its different with you, anyway, but, he took in a deep breath and tensed again, closing his eyes for a moment, Im never going to be the same after this.His lips searched every inch of my neck, and when he found his way to my mouth, I sunk my fingertips into the muscles of his shoulders, losing myself in the intensity of the kiss.Travis brought my hands above my head and intertwined his fingers with mine, squeezing my hands with each thrust.His movements became a bit rougher, and I dug my nails into his hands, my insides tensing with incredible force.I cried out, biting my lip and clenching my eyes shut.Abby, he whispered, sounding conflicted, I need aI need to,  Dont stop, I begged.He rocked into me again, groaning so loudly that I covered his mouth.After a few labored breaths, he looked into my eyes, and then kissed me over and over.His hands cupped each side of my face and then he kissed me again, slower, more tender.He touched his lips to mine, and then my cheeks, my forehead, my nose, and then finally returned to my lips.I smiled and sighed, exhaustion setting in.Travis pulled me next to him, situating the covers over us.I rested my cheek against his chest, and he kissed my forehead once more, locking his fingers together behind me.Dont leave this time, okay?I wanna wake up just like this in the morning.I kissed his chest, feeling guilty that he had to ask.Im not going anywhere.I awoke on my stomach, naked and tangled in Travis Maddoxs sheets.I kept my eyes closed, feeling his fingers caressing my arm and back.He exhaled with a deep, contented sigh, speaking in a hushed voice.I love you, Abby.Im going to make you happy, I swear it.The bed concaved as he shifted, and then his lips were on my back in slow, small kisses.I remained still, and just as he had made his way up to the skin just below my ear, he left me to walk across the room.His footsteps leisurely plodded down the hall, and the pipes whined with the water pressure of the shower.I opened my eyes and sat up, stretching.Every muscle in my body ached, muscles that I never knew I had.I held the sheet to my chest, looking out the window, watching the yellow and red leaves spiral from their branches to the ground.His cell phone vibrated somewhere on the floor, and after clumsily searching the crumpled clothes on the floor, I found it in his jeans pocket.The display was lit with only a number, no name.Hello?Is uhis Travis there?a woman asked.Hes in the shower, can I take a message?Of course he is.Tell him that Megan called, would ya?Travis walked in, tightening his towel around his water splotched waist, and smiled as I held out his phone.Its for you, I said.He kissed me before looking at the display, and then shook his head.Yeah?It was my girlfriend, what do you need, Megan?He listened for a moment and then smiled, Well, Pigeons special, what can I say?After a long pause, he rolled his eyes.I could only imagine what she was saying.Dont be a bitch, Megan.Listen, you cant call my phone anymore.Well, lovell do that to ya, he said, looking at me with a soft expression.Yes, with Abby.I mean it, Meg, no more phone callsLater.He tossed his phone on the bed, and then sat beside me.She was a little pissy.Did she say anything to you?No, she just asked for you.I erased the few numbers I had on my phone, but I guess that doesnt stop them from calling me.If they dont figure it out on their own, Ill set them straight.He watched me expectantly, and I couldnt help but smile.I had never seen this side of him.I trust you, you know.He pressed his lips to mine.I wouldnt blame you if you expected me to earn it.Ive got to get in the shower.Ive already missed one class.See?Im a good influence already.I stood up, and he tugged on the sheet.Megan said theres a Halloween party this weekend at The Red Door.I went with her last year, it was pretty fun.Im sure it was, I said, raising an eyebrow.I just mean a lot of people come out.They have a pool tournament and cheap drinkswanna go?Im not reallyI dont do the dress up thing.I never have.I dont, either.I just go, he shrugged.Are we still going bowling tonight?I asked, wondering if the invitation was just to get some alone time with me that he no longer needed.Well, hell yeah!Im gonna kick your ass, too!I narrowed my eyes at him.Not this time youre not.I have a new superpower.He laughed.And whats that?Harsh language?I leaned over to kiss his neck once, and then ran my tongue up to his ear, kissing his earlobe.He froze in place.Distraction, I breathed into his ear.He grabbed my arms and flipped me onto my back.Youre going to miss another class.After finally talking him into leaving the apartment long enough to attend History class, we raced to campus, and slid into the seat just before Professor Cheney began.Travis turned his red baseball cap backwards to plant a kiss on my lips, in full view of everyone in the classroom.On our way to the cafeteria, he took my hand in his, intertwining our fingers as we walked.He seemed so proud to be holding my hand, announcing to the world that we were finally together.Finch noticed, looking at our hands, and then to me with a ridiculous grin.He wasnt the only one, our simple display of affection generated stares and murmuring of everyone we passed.At the door of the cafeteria, Travis blew out his last puff of smoke, looking to me when I hesitated.America and Shepley were already inside, and Finch had lit another cigarette, leaving me to go in with Travis alone.I was certain the gossip had soared to a new level since Travis had kissed me in full view of everyone in our History class, and I dreaded walking out onto the stage the cafeteria presented.What, Pigeon?he said, tugging on my hand.Everyone is watching us.He pulled my hand to his mouth and kissed my fingers.Theyll get over it.Its just the initial shock.Remember when we first started hanging out?Their curiosity died down after awhile and they got used to seeing us together.Cmon, he said, pulling me through the door.One of the reasons I had chosen Eastern U was for its modest population, but the exaggerated interest in scandal that came with it was at times exhausting.It was a running joke; everyone was aware of how ridiculous the rumor mill was, and yet they all shamelessly participated in it.We sat down in our usual spots with our food.America smiled at me with a knowing expression.She chatted as if everything was normal, but the football players at the other end of the table were staring at me like I was on fire.Travis tapped my apple with his fork.You gonna eat that, Pidge?No, you can have it, Baby.Heat consumed my ears when Americas head jerked to look at me.It just came out, I said, shaking my head.I peeked up at Travis, whose expression was a mixture of amusement and adoration.We had exchanged the term a few times that morning, and it hadnt occurred to me that it was new to everyone else until it tumbled from my mouth.You two have just reached the level of annoyingly cute, America grinned.Shepley tapped my shoulder.You staying over tonight?he asked, his words garbled among the bread in his mouth.I promise I wont come out of my room cussing at you.You were defending my honor, Shep.Youre forgiven, I said.Travis took a bite of the apple and chewed, looking happy as Id ever seen him.The peace in his eyes had returned, and even as the dozens of people watched our every move, everything feltright.I thought of all the times I had insisted being with Travis was the wrong decision, and how much time I had wasted fighting my feelings for him.Looking across the table at his soft, brown eyes, and the dimple dancing in his cheek as he chewed, I couldnt remember what I was so worried about.
