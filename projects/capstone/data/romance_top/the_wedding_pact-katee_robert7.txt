It was probably for the best.If Teague knew something might be wrong, hed set aside everything except for solving the problem.Theyd put it on the back burner so that he could be happy without strings attached today.They pulled up to the reception hallthe same one that had been used to announce Teague and Callies weddingand everyone piled out of the limo.Half the guests had somehow beaten them there, and the tables were filling up as they made their way up to the main table on the platform.Carrigan gave the crowd a cursory glance, and then almost tripped over her feet when she caught sight of a familiar blond head of hair.No way.She touched Sloans arm.Ill be right back.Okay.Dont be too long, though.I think our mother has dinner set up to go off immediately, followed by the toasts.One of which Carrigan was giving.She nodded without taking her eyes off the blond man.That was definitely James.I know.I wont miss it.She moved away before her sister could say something else, winding through the tables and trying to get a better look.This is stupid.Just walk over and tap him on the shoulder and then youll see that its not James, because theres no way James could be here.But then he looked over his shoulder, caught her eye, and winked.She changed course, determined to drag his ass out of here before one of her brothers or, worse, her father, realized he was in the room.James stood and walked toward the door leading deeper into the buildingnot the exit.Thats it.Im going to kill him.Carrigan checked to make sure no one was following, and then ducked after him.She barely made it three steps when an arm wrapped around her waist and a hand over her mouth cut off her curse.Relax, lovely.Its me.She damn well knew it was him.It wasnt like she was wandering down the hall for her health.She elbowed him and slipped free.What the hell is wrong with you?Nothing.Why do you ask?He rubbed his stomach with a grimace.You sure do like beating me up.I dont respond well to being grabbed without warning.She waved it away.Back to more important thingswhy are you here?He crossed his arms over his chest.I was invited.You were invited.She hadnt realized it was possible to actually feel her blood boil.Youre a smart man, James.Why do I feel youre about to use that as a backhanded compliment?She ignored the question.And, as a smart man, you have to be aware that the invitation was a gesture only.No one wants you here, and just by being here, youre upping the chances of causing a conflict that will jeopardize the peace.Ah, lovely.He grinned, his total lack of concern making her blood pressure spike.If I didnt know any better, Id think youre sweet on me.Im not.I dont believe in caring about idiots who have death wishes.She smacked his arm.You need to leave.Now.Bossy, bossy.He turned and walked farther down the hall, forcing her to chase him like a yippy dog.Pretty wedding.Yeah, it was.She glanced over her shoulder.So far no one had come looking for her, but it was only a matter of time.James What could she say?That it would kill a little part of her if something happened to him?It was nothing more than the truth, and it still pissed her off that hed taken a risk like this.Leave.James peered through a door and then kept it open with his foot.Not until I get what I came for.Of course hed come here for a specific reason.She should have known.Carrigan sighed.Okay, fine.Hurry up and get what you came for and then you can get out of here.She frowned when he laughed.Whats so funny?Lovely, I came here for you.He grabbed her wrist and hauled her against his chest, simultaneously taking a step back that brought them into the room hed just been looking in.She got the vague impression of a storage closet, and then he shoved the door shut and his mouth was on hers.Shock had her opening for him, shock and the fact that she was hot and wanting just by his touching her.Torn between shoving him off and yelling at him some more, and kissing him until she forgot all the reasons this was a bad idea, it was no contest.She slid her hands down his chest to hook his belt.I need you.Youve read my mind.He pulled at her dress, bunching it up.The further it rose, the greater the barrier between them.How much fucking fabric does one dress need?Too much.She pulled away and turned around.Unzip me.He wasted no time in obeying, dragging the zipper down and shoving the offending dress off her shoulders to puddle on the floor.Then he was there, pressed against her bare back, his hand slipping around and into her panties.Youre wet for me.Always.I think you have a thing for storage closets.He kissed the back of her neck, left bare by her complicated updo.I like it.And then her panties were gone, joining her dress on the floor.He kicked her legs wider, taking advantage of the position to push two fingers into her.She rolled her hips, moaning, and he growled against her skin.Quiet, lovely.This isnt some loud as fuck dance club.This is your brothers wedding.He fucked her slowly with his fingers.Someones going to come looking for you before too long, so you need to be good and quiet so they dont walk in and see you taking my cock like you cant live without it.She couldnt catch her breath.Oh God.He slowed even further, dragging his fingers out of her.Do you want me to stop?He circled her clit.You can put that ridiculous dress back on and walk back to the reception and pretend you werent about to come all over my hand.His breath brushed the sensitive spot where her neck met her shoulder.Or I can go down on my knees and lick that pretty pussy of yours until you have to cover your mouth to keep from screaming.He kept going, his words the only thing that penetrated the rushing in her ears.And then, while youre still recovering, Ill bend you over and fuck you until youre coming again, this time around my cock.His hand started to slide up her stomach and she grabbed his wrist.Dont you dare stop.She guided him back between her legs, whimpering when he pushed into her again.James.Fuck, lovely, when you say my name like that, you damn well know Im not going to stop until Ive done everything I promised and more.Seventeen James tried to keep an ear on the hallway outside them, but with Carrigan in his arms making that delicious whimpering sound, he lost it.Everything went out the damn window except for his need to bury himself inside her until they both lost control.He kept working her with one hand and used the other to get his pants off.On second thought, Im just going to fuck you right now.Every minute I spend without being buried inside you is one minute too many.He grabbed a condom out of his pocket and was forced to stop touching her long enough to roll it on.Too long.He ran one hand up her spine, bending her forward, and used his other to notch his cock in her entrance.She was wet and ready for him, so he wasted no time sliding home.James went stock still, the sheer bliss of being inside her never failing to take his breath away.The things you do to me.He moved, gripping her chin and maneuvering her so that her back was flush against his chest.His shirt was one barrier too many between them, but he wasnt going to waste the energy to get it off.Instead, he kissed her.Youre mine, lovely.Mine alone.Crazy words.Words he had no right to.She made a sound of protest, but he wasnt about to let her start thinking right now.James slid his hand down to cup her breast, pinching her nipple even as he slipped his free hand between her legs again, stroking her clit.Brace your hands on the wall.The new position allowed him deeper, and he wasted no time taking full advantage of it, fucking her ruthlessly even as he rubbed her clit.Remember, lovely, be quiet.You never know who might be listening.There was that whimper again.His balls went tight at the sound, and words came out of his mouth in an unfiltered river.I want you so much, I cant fucking see straight.He slammed into her hard, the sound of flesh meeting flesh filling the room.Every time I watch you walk away, all I can think about is dragging you back into my bed, my car, a fucking storage closet.Being inside you is as close to perfection as Ill ever get.She let go of the wall and slapped a hand over her mouth as she came, and he was forced to grab her hips to keep them both from slamming into the wall.Her pussy milked him, taking away his last breath of control.He slammed into her once, twice, and a third time, coming so hard he saw stars.James caught them both from falling with a hand on the wall, keeping another around her waist.Shit.That about sums it up.She pulled away and turned around.She had the look of a woman well pleasured, but there was a hint of panic lingering in her green eyes.This doesnt change anything.He wanted to argue, to rail at her for being so damn determined to drive herself off the cliff, but that wasnt why hed come here tonight.He caught her chin and kissed her, moving back almost as soon as hed made contact.I wanted to see you.End of story.But it wasnt.Not by a long shot.Promise me youll leave.She rummaged around and found her panties.Weve already been gone too long.So determined to see the back of me.She yanked on her dress and, even in his frustration, he made sure he zipped it up slowly so he didnt damage the fabric.Carrigan turned around as soon as he was done.Apparently Im going to have to be the one who has enough common sense for both of us.You cant be here.This cant happen like this.Not where we could be caught.Her reasoning was sound, but that didnt stop the bitterness on the back of his tongue.Got it.Im your dirty little secret.Do you want a war?She shook her head.You know what, no.Im not doing this.Not now and not like this.If you want to have a conversation like reasonable adults, call me later.She was right.He knew she was right.But that didnt kill the urge to drag her back into his arms and kiss her until she stopped telling him all the reasons they were shitty for each other.He opened the closet door and motioned for her to precede him.After you.YouGod, you drive me so crazy.She grabbed the front of his shirt and kissed him, moving away before he could do anything about it.Right into the hallway where two of her brothers stood, shock written across both their faces.Well, fuck.Aiden grabbed her arm and the younger one grabbed him, slamming him against the wall.Im going to fucking kill you.James didnt fight back, just let the little shit shake him.Cillian, no!Aiden gave Carrigan a shake, too, and that set Jamess temper off.He grabbed the kid and glared at the OMalley heir.You can be pissed at me all you want, but you hurt her and Ill take your fucking hand off at the wrist.Aiden didnt let her go, but he didnt shake her again, either.I think its time you left.Hell, James agreed with him.He caught Carrigans gaze.Unfinished business, lovely.She frowned, obviously worried her brother was going to take him out back and shoot him.I think youre right.He shoved Cillian away and made a show of dusting off his shirt.Ill be seeing you around.He turned and made it all of one step before Aidens voice stopped him.My sister might be ready to forget what you almost did to her, but I damn well havent.You fucking touch her again and it really will be war.*** Carrigans brothers dragged her back to the reception.Aiden stopped just inside the door, his grip on her arm tight enough to bruise.You will go to the banquet table, sit your ass down, and smile like nothings wrong.You will give your planned toast.And then you will sit there like someone who isnt a fucking traitor until its time to go home.After that, well deal with this.Shed never feared her brother before, but shed never seen him with another mans murder in his eyes, or with that bone deep disgust he turned on her.Shed fucked up, and they both knew it.Carrigan gave a jerky nod, and walked to the wedding partys table on shaking legs.Teague sent her a questioning look, and she somehow managed to dredge up a smile for him.The food looks great.The rest of the reception passed in a blur.Every time she looked up, she found Aiden or Cillian glaring at her, a physical reminder of the talk she had coming.She tried to dredge up some righteous indignation.Good lord, she tried.But there was nothing.Shed been sleeping with the enemy.Worse, she could still feel the imprint of his mouth on her skin, his hands on her body, his cock inside her.Even knowing the trouble that was coming, she still wanted James almost more than she wanted her next breathwhich just proved she was too stupid to live.They saw Teague and Callie off in a flurry of bubbles.Carrigan was an island of misery in the midst of all the joy, her glowering brothers flanking her as she walked to the waiting town car and they got in on either side of her.She barely had time to take a breath before Aiden started in.What.The.Fuck.Is.Wrong.With.You?James fucking Halloran?Seriously, Carrigan?How fucking stupid can you be?She crossed her arms over her chest, staring straight ahead.Im not stupid.They didnt know James.They didnt understand that what he and she shared was something she couldnt make herself pass up.You dont understand.No, I goddamn well dont.He kidnapped you.Christ only knows what he did to you when you were in his house.Carrigan turned to glare at him.Christ has nothing to do with it.I know what happenedand, more importantly, what didnt happento me.And its a moot point now anyway.No, its not a fucking moot point.He pointed a finger out the side window.That guy is the enemy.He might be someone youre attracted to or whatever the fuck was going on back there, but hes a Halloran.Hes not for you, and you damn well know it.Yeah, she did.Not too long ago, that forbidden aspect would have been enough to make James even more attractive to her.Was that all this is?The lure of the untouchable?She hunched lower in her seat, every instinct crying against that belief.It was different with James.He was different.Maybe shed originally entertained thoughts of him because he was the one man her father would lose his shit over, but that had quickly morphed into somethinggenuine.Aiden gripped her shoulder.Look at me, Carrigan.She wanted to dig in her heels and shut her eyes like she had when they were kids and he pissed her off.But they werent kids anymore.They were adults, and she was facing real life consequences.So she turned and met his gaze, doing her damnedest not to drop her eyes.Her brothers face seemed to have acquired new lines in the last few hours, and every single one of them was because of her.Aiden He is not for you.Ill keep this from our father, because we both know what hed do if he knew.Nothing good.Seamuss potential reactions ranged from locking her in the attic for the rest of her life to marrying her off right away to the first man he could find that wasnt an enemy of the OMalleys.Nowhere on the list was him smiling, patting her on the head, and telling her that he just wanted her to be happy.Her happiness was, and always had been, secondary.On her other side, she could practically feel Cillian seething.He shifted.You cant seriously be thinking of letting this go, Aiden.He defiled our sister.Are you serious right now?She turned and smacked him.Im a grown ass woman, and no one defiled me.Except that time he threw your ass into a trunk and kidnapped you.Since when are we so willing to forget that?Aiden, you have to tell Father.I dont have to do a damn thingand neither do you.The boy shed grown up with, the one shed played countless hours of imaginary games with, was gone, replaced by a cold son of a bitch that Carrigan would think twice before crossing.Apparently Cillian felt the same way, because he jerked back.Aiden looked at her, and then Cillian.Neither one of you is going to do anything that might jeopardize the peace deals we have going.Not a single fucking thing, do you hear me?That means you keep your mouth shut.He jerked his chin at Cillian.And you keep the hell away from Halloran.We can fix this, but youre going to do exactly what I say.She didnt want to.She wanted to rail and scream and hit in protest.But it wouldnt do a damn bit of good.She was as trapped as shed always been.Damn you, James.Why did you have to come to the wedding?Things were going good.And hed been her dirty little secret.She tried to smother the shame the thought brought.Today had more than proven that James wasnt ever going to be accepted by her family.He wasnt on the list.Hell, he was so far off the list, he was probably the last person in the world her father would allow her to marry.She pressed a hand to her throat.Oh God, where had that thought come from?She liked how he made her feel, in bed and out, but that was a long way from considering a serious relationshipany relationshipwith him.Promise me, Carrigan.Aidens hand tightened on her arm.Promise me that youll focus on our fathers list and leave Halloran alone.She didnt have a choice.If she fought him on this, hed throw her to the wolves.She cleared her throat.I promise.Even as the words settled in the space between them, she wasnt sure if she was lying or not.The town car pulled up in front of their home, saving her from this conversation.Cillian was out of the car before it stopped moving, slamming the door behind him and striding down the street.She had a feeling she knew where he was going, but there was nothing she could do about it.Carrigan could actually feel her siblings fracturing around herfrom Aiden down to Keiraand she was partly to blame.She followed Aiden out onto the shaded sidewalk, but apparently he wasnt through with her.Which one of the men is the top of your list?She wished she could pretend she misunderstood him.I havent met them all.When he just stared, she sighed.Really, there was no contest.Dmitri Romanov.He might be dangerous, but at least he was upfront about it.Call him.She jerked back.Excuse me?Call him.See him again.Get this fucking thing moving.The faster youre married, the faster we can sweep this whole clusterfuck under the rug.And the faster the cage door would close behind her.She took a deep breath.Aiden Youre being deliberately dense.That wasnt a request, Carrigan.It was a fucking order.Glaring, she fished her cell phone out of her clutch and scrolled through her most recent calls.This is bullshit.You dont get to play righteous fury right now.Stop stalling and call him.She was stalling, and for what?If it was two weeks or two days, her time had nearly run out.With a sigh, she called Dmitri, hoping hed let it go to voice mail.Hello, Carrigan.Damn it.Shed had such shitty luck today, and apparently it wasnt going to change now.Dmitri.She held Aidens gaze while she spoke, part of her surprised that her voice was so even despite the inner turmoil she could barely breathe past.Id like to see you again.Excellent.Are you free Tuesday?I had to make a trip back to New York to take care of some business, but I should be back in Boston by then.She didnt ask what business he had to take care of personally.She didnt want to know.That would be wonderful.Dinner this time?Of course.Ill send my driver to pick you up at seven.High handed.She gritted her teeth and bit out the next words.I look forward to seeing you.She hung up and turned to Aiden.Are you happy now?Not even close.Dont fuck this up, Carrigan.You have no idea whats at stake.She would if he talked to her instead of stepping up like he was their father and she was his little minion.But that was how Seamus operated, so why would Aiden do anything differently?Youre just like our father.The words came out poisonous and low, and she instantly wanted to take them back.He just stepped aside with a short nod.I do what I have to in order to keep our family safe.Youd do well to remember that.He turned on his heel and walked up the stairs and into the town house, leaving her staring after him.She was doing what was best for the family.She hadnt run like shed considered.She hadnt fought her fathers ridiculous list.The only thing shed taken for herself in all these years was the occasional night of freedom.And James.She pushed the thought away.She didnt know what she was going to do about him, but her brother was rightthere was no future there.Even if by some miracle he fell in love with her and sheWell, it was impossible.Her family would never give their blessing.His family wanted her dead.That wasnt the material that happily ever after was made of.Maybe it really would be best to cut things off now.It seemed like every hour she spent with him attached more strings to her heart.Too many more and hed rip it out of her chest when he walked away.Eighteen Cillian didnt have a destination in mind when he set out.All he wanted to do was escape the monster in his head.Seeing his sister touching a Halloran had sent him back to that dark street, to the sound of gunshots, to watching Devlin bleed out.It was a Halloran who gave the order that resulted in their little brothers death, and she was kissing one.He couldnt even stand to look at her right now.The band around his chest that never quite seemed to go away tightened until black dots danced across his vision.Hed thought Carrigan understood, but how could she?She hadnt been there on that street so strikingly similar to this one, hadnt seen the headlights cut through the darknessthe only warning they got before things went tits up.And she sure as fuck hadnt been there on her knees, helplessly watching Devlin bleed out.Theyd both lost a brother, but he was only now starting to realize that the demons inside him that rose that night werent ones easily exorcised.Lights broke up the relative darkness of the street and he glanced up, not even a little surprised to find himself outside Jamesons.His feet always seemed to take him here when he wasnt paying attention, as if he could somehow change the events of that night if he walked through it enough times.He almost turned around and left.There was nothing for him here and he damn well knew it.But the siren call of the last happy night hed shared with his brothers was too much to resist.Maybe if he went inside, he could actually manage to draw a full breath again.He pushed through the door, the heat of the room making him realize just how cold hed been.The place was packed tonight, though the crowd seemed subdued.Or maybe that was just him.He made his way through the full tables and snagged a seat at the bar.The normal bartender, Benji, was nowhere to be found.Hell, no one was behind the polished wood.He took in the peoples drinks on either side of him.Benji must have run out back for something.But when the door to the storage room opened, it wasnt Benji who backed through.Cillians first glimpse was of a mane of dark hair, wild and untamed.Then she turned around and every cell of his being went still.She was the most striking woman hed ever seen.Her features were timeless, and combined with her dusky skin tone, seemed to indicate Middle Eastern descent.And the body he got a glimpse of when she hauled the giant box onto the barFuck.More curves than a racetrack, her clothes seemingly designed to bring that to his attention without trying at all.The writing across the front of her faded T shirt was mostly gone, and her holey jeans probably hadnt come that way.He had to know more about her.He leaned forward, deciding to start with something simple.Hey, sweetheart, how about a drink?A minute passed, and then another.Nothing.She just kept unpacking bottles into the fridge below the bar.Cillian frowned.Hey, Im talking to you.I heard you, pretty boy.She didnt look up.And since your eyes dont seem to be working, let me clarify somethingIm not your bar wench.I never said Leave me alone.Im working.He sat back on his stool, stunned.Hed thought he was being perfectly polite.Charming, even.Hed never had a woman shut him down so effectively when he didnt actually deserve itthere had been plenty of times he deserved it, but tonight wasnt one of them.The storage door opened again, and this time it was a familiar face who came through.Benji grinned when he saw Cillian.Back again?Like I can stay away.You knew I would be.That I did, that I did.He moved around the woman, a careful swing of his body that left as much space between them as possible, and ambled over.The usual?Yeah.Even though he told himself not to, his gaze angled toward her again.Shed moved further down the bar and was now unloading a second box of beer bottles.Whats the new girls story?Olivia?Benji raised furry eyebrows.I wouldnt.He couldnt look away from her.Olivia.The name made him think of someone old worldor just plain olddefinitely not a fit for the woman in front of him.Why not?Shes not like the other bartenders who come through here.Benji paused.Dont step on toes.Easier said than done.He seemed to have offended her just by sitting down at her bar.Cillian had frequented a lot of bars, clubs, and pubs, and the universal rule seemed to be that bartenders were flirty and snarky and good times.They had to be, since tips could make or break them.They sure as hell didnt snarl at a man just trying to get a drink.It couldnt be clearer that there was something about him she blatantly didnt like, and damn if a perverse part of him didnt want to know why.A glass hit his hand, breaking his thought process.Benji crossed his big arms over his chest.Shes not for you.I like the girl, and shes a hard worker.I wont have you running her off because you dont know how to take no for an answer.Cillian jerked back, stung.Why the fuck is everyone so goddamn determined to think the worst of me?Im not a creep.Then stop staring at her like one.He immediately dropped his gaze, and then realized what hed done.Why the hell was he fighting this?He needed a complicated woman in his life like he needed a punch to the face.This Olivia didnt want a damn thing to do with him?Good.Hed have his drink like he normally did, tip well, and then leave.He stared at the apple juice, all too aware of the impulse to look over at her again.To watch her.Like a fucking creep.He sighed.I get your point, Benji.Good.Enjoy your drink.The big bartender moved down the bar, refilling drinks and chatting.Cillian was surrounded by people, but it didnt make a damn bit of difference tonight.It never did.And now there was this prickly woman on the edge of his vision, her presence poking at him like a toothache.I dont need this shit.He shotgunned the juice and threw a twenty on the bar.There was no escape for him tonight, and he damn well knew it.He might as well go home, lie on his bed, and face the demons waiting for him when he lost his battle with sleep.Morning might come, but relief from the nightmares never did.*** Carrigan met Dmitris car outside, torn between feeling like a sacrificial victim and a call girl.Shed put aside her virginal wear for the date.Dmitri had already proven that he wasnt stupid enough to be fooled by the persona, and she hated wearing it.So shed picked a jade green dress that hit her at mid thigh and hugged her body.It wasnt the sexiest thing in her closet, but it was the first time shed left the house feeling like her in longer than she cared to remember.She always wore one mask or another.Tonight she was setting them aside.Let Dmitri think of that what he would.Liam stood next to her, disapproval embodied in human form.Hed been like this since she got back the other day, and she deserved it.Carrigan took a deep breath.Im sorry.I shouldnt have disappeared and turned off my phone.Not for me to say.He didnt look over.But if I were going to speak my mind, Id say that was a dipshit thing to do and we both know it.My job is to keep you safe, and I cant do that if I dont know where you are.I know.But he wasnt through.In all these years of you dicking around, have I ever reported you?He is seriously pissed.She wanted to snap back, but she fought the impulse down.He needed to say this and, after what shed done, it was the least she could do to listen.It wasnt like he was the first one to lecture her on her shitty life choices.Of the men in her life, Liam was probably the least judgmental.He deserved a chance to give his opinion, no matter how little she wanted to hear it.No.Have I ever passed judgment or said shit to make you feel like Im one of your goddamn brothers, expecting you to act a certain way?No.She hated the guilt worming through her.The last thing she needed was to feel bad for disappointing yet another man in her life.She hadnt even realized she cared about what Liam thought of her.He had the tendency to fade into the backgroundthere when she needed him and invisible when she didnt.They werent friends.Theyd never be close.But she hated that shed damaged what little respect he seemed to have for her.Im sorry, Liam.I screwed up.It wont happen again.But apparently now that hed broken his customary bodyguard silence, he wasnt done.I dont like this any more than you, but we both have a job to do.I know.He nodded, still not looking at her.This Dmitri guy isnt safe.Probably not.One encounter with him and she knew enough to know safe didnt make the top twenty list of descriptions for Dmitri Romanov.Okay.He rolled his shoulders.You need me, you text.I dont care if hes the king of England.Ill get you out of there.Hed be defying her fathers wishes to do it.She turned to face him fully, wanting tohug him?Show him how grateful she was by reaching out?Neither fit in the realm of their roles.So she just stood taller and nodded.Thank you, Liam.Will you be making any excursions afterward?She shot him a look.I was under the impression Im confined to house arrest.He snorted.Since when has that ever stopped you?It was a fair point.But hadnt she just reasoned last night that things with James had to be over out of sheer self preservation?Turning around less than twenty four hours later and running into his arms wouldnt do a damn thing to put some distance between them.Well see.A black car pulled up to the curb, and a nondescript man got out.Ms.OMalley.He hurried around to open the door for her, but Liam beat him to it.The man sputtered.I was told You were told wrong.She slid into the backseat and then scooted over to make room for Liam.He was right.Hed been there every step of the way and done his damnedest to keep her safe.She wouldnt ditch him again.Especially since he alone didnt see her time with James as one giant betrayal to the family.I wonder why that is?It didnt matter.What mattered was that he was apparently on her side when she desperately needed someone in her corner.The driver seemed to have recovered from his confusion because he was back in the car and pulling away from the curb.She sat back and crossed her legs, trying to relax.Shed dealt with dangerous men before.She could do it again.At least this one was willing to negotiate and give her some freedom in return for her dancing to his tune.It just didnt seem like the silver lining it might have a few months ago.Shed had a taste of freedomreal freedomwith James, and now everything else seemed like a sad substitute by comparison.She was starting to fear that the man might have actually ruined her.Carrigan stared out the window, not really seeing anything.It seemed like they made the trip between one blink and the next, because the next thing she knew, the car had stopped and the driver was opening her door with a defiant look at Liam.She stared at the sidewalk, suddenly sure she was about to take a step that she couldnt take back.If she said yes to Dmitri, that was it.It was over.Everything was over.The man might offer her a measure of freedom, but he wasnt the type to be crossed.The second she stepped out of line, hed smash her like a bug.I dont want you, you cant make me, please dont make me get out of this car.It was the voice of a small child afraid of the darka child shed thought shed put behind her once and for all.Face your fears.To do anything else is inexcusable.She steeled herself and took the drivers hand, letting him help her out of the car.Behind her, Liam was already on his feet.He nodded at the door.Remember what I said.One text and hed get her out of there.She nodded.Thanks.And then there was nothing left for her to stall with.She squared her shoulders and walked into Slingshot.Like before, it was completely deserted and, like before, she was struck by the wild fear that hed invited her here to kill her.Stop being an idiot.You invited him.Right.Maybe that would have actually put the power in her courtexcept hed taken control of the situation the second the invitation left her lips.Shed arrived in his car to a place of his choosing at a time he picked.So much for leaving herself any bargaining power at all.She followed the pretty blond hostess back into the depths of the restaurant.There, at the same table with his back to the wall, sat Dmitri.He stood as she approached and moved around to greet her.Carrigan.You look as lovely as ever.He pressed a kiss to her cheek.I must admit I prefer you in color.Dmitri.She ignored the sideways compliment and took a seat in the chair hed pulled out for her.Thank you.I was surprised to hear from you so soon.No, he wasnt.He knew hed given her the best offer she was going to get.But she smiled all the same.You play coy so prettily.He chuckled.And youre too smart by half.How was your brothers wedding?The memory of James at her back, whispering in her ear as he fucked her, swept over Carrigan.She reached for her water, hoping like hell that the low light hid her blush.It went off without a hitch.Both he and Callie are very happy.In addition to their being happy, theyve managed to forge an alliance that will protect both their interests.A rare meeting of personal and professional.You could say that.She waited for the waiter to fill their wineglasses and melt back into the shadows around them before she continued.Thats what youre looking for with this arrangement, isnt it?An alliance, yes.A love match?He shrugged and took a drink of his wine.Such a thing only exists for fools and fairy tales.A cynical outlook, but she didnt blame him.It was one she shared, after all.Her mind tried to shy away to the thought of James again, but she forced herself to stay focused on the present.James wasnt here.Hed never be here, never be the man across the table from her, never be able to offer her what Dmitri was.Even if he hadshe couldnt accept.Not without restarting a war that theyd all been working so hard to put to bed.Carrigan was selfish, but she wasnt that selfish.Not to mention he hasnt asked.Shut up.She sipped her wine, trying to get her head on straight.I dont expect a love match.Nor should you.I respect the woman you are, Carrigan.I find you beautiful and I like the passion I can see in your eyes, even though you try to hide it.I think our marriage could evolve into genuine affection.Somehow, she didnt think so.This man was so cold, she doubted he had genuine affection for anything.Except for power.He seemed to like that well enough.And the sex?His eyebrows rose, and he laughed.You do cut right to the chase, dont you?I like to have all the cards on the table before I make a decision.Carrigan, youve already made the decision and you know it.He motioned with his wineglass, every inch the waiting predator.But, by all means, lets discuss the sex.I mentioned last time we spoke that I require an heir and at least one backup.I remember.The thought of bringing children into the world solely to serve as political pieces made her nauseous, but it wasnt a surprise.Children were an expected part of her future, no matter what her personal feelings on the matter were.He smiled, and while it wasnt his sharks smile, there wasnt any real warmth there, either.It doesnt have to be all bad.Ill leave sex on the table at your discretion once the required children are established.Its not necessary, but I think we would both enjoy it.He didnt really want her.He might say all the right things about her being beautiful, but he could take her or leave her.There was no passion there.Carrigan hadnt really expected it to be there to be butthe lack still stood out.Ill consider it.Perfect.He sat back.Now, on to less pleasant things.This affair youre having with James Halloran has to stop.Immediately.She blinked, her mind taking several seconds to catch up to and process his words.James.He was talking about James.How could you possibly?How I know isnt the issue.Your choice in bedmates is.Certain things must be kept up for appearances sake.Im not keen on being cuckolded in general, but Ive reconsidered since our last conversation.Im now willing to look the other way as long as youre discreet.Holy shit, is this guy for real?How generous of you.That being said, your willingness to lie down with the enemy, as it were, puts a less than desirable shade on you.He sat back.And before you claim its none of my business, Ill remind you that considering marriage to you makes it my business.Technically, he was rightbut still.She set her glass aside.Are you planning on remaining faithful?Its a moot point.Ill ensure there are no bastard children running around.Thats enough.His dark eyes saw too much.But I wont be sleeping with the enemy, either.There it was again.Everyone loved to remind her that James was the enemy.What they couldnt explain was why he was the only one who seemed to have her backthe only one who asked nothing of her but her time.It was the ones who claimed to be concerned for her who demanded the most.Marry this man.Do this thing.Dont touch the one person who actually makes you feel alive.She met Dmitris gaze.And if I dont give him up?You dont have a choice.Your father requires you to marry, and youve already decided on me.Give Halloran up.His gray eyes didnt so much as flicker.If you dont, Ill have him removed.Permanently.Nineteen James spent all Tuesday in a foul mood.It was his own damn fault and he knew it, but not knowing what was going on with Carriganand knowing hed been the one to put her in that positiondrove him nuts.So he did the only thing he could do and put his frustration to good use.He took Michael and went on rounds.If his time at Tit for Tat was anything to go by, it had been too long since hed done them.Really, as soon as he realized Ricky was taking advantage, he should have touched base with the managers of his various businesses.Should have, but didnt, because he was too busy chasing Carrigan.Even when he wasnt with her, he was thinking about her, and it threw him off his game at a time when he needed to keep shit from falling through the cracks.Sure, Ricky had said hed follow orders like a good little soldier, but James didnt believe him for a second.His brother would do whatever he thought benefited him bestincluding stabbing James in the back when the opportunity popped up.So he couldnt give him the opportunity.To his relief, no one else had any problems beyond the shit that popped up here and there.Tommy had to run off some Sheridan boys last week, but it had been drunk men acting like assholes and not an actual skirmish.Harmless stuff, especially since Tommy had defused the situation before anyone got violent.He still needed to figure out what he was going to do to keep Ricky busyand soon.The longer his brother sat idle, the more likely he was to say to hell with it and go back to doing exactly what hed been doing before James was forced to take such extreme measures.I just have to keep him away from the girls.He turned to Michael, sitting in the passenger seat of the Chevelle, his hands in his lap, like he was afraid of touching anything.Whens the next shipment coming in to replace what we lost in the Sheridan attack?Got a hundred AKs two days from now.He thought fast.Those the ones we owe our friends on the West Coast?Yep.They didnt transfer goods often, but his father had created a trade with some group back west.Guns forsomething.James wasnt sure.He wasnt too keen on sending guns off to people he didnt know, where theyd be used for God knew what, but he had enough enemies.Courting more was stupid, even if they were three thousand miles away.His father had made a deal, and hed follow through on it.After thatWell, once it was done hed reevaluate.But this might be a blessing in disguise.Hed get Ricky out of Boston for a while, and maybe the distance between them would be enough to dim some of his brothers anger.He doubted it, but it couldnt hurt to try.Plus, then he wouldnt have to be looking over his shoulder for a knifeat least for a week or so.Put my brother on it.
