..She blanched a little.What I make for you needs to be of you.To hold what you areyour light, your heart, your strength.Now he took out a small ritual knife hed cleansed.Just a tiny prick from your fingertip.Third finger of your left hand is best.Saying nothing, she held out her hand, reached out for Sawyers with the other.With his eyes on hers, Bran used the tip of the knife, held her finger over the vial so three drops slid inside.There now.As he might with a child, he kissed her fingertip.And the tiny wound healed.It didnt hurt.Because youre very brave.And your courage is in your blood as well.What will you make me?A surprise.Now he kissed her cheek, then turned, looked at Sasha.I could use your help with it.She went with him.You dont seem very concerned about this Malmon, Sasha said.Hes a man, however dangerous.He walked into his room.As he slept in Sashas now, hed arranged his as strictly a workspace.At the moment, his cauldron sat on a waist high stone pedestal in the center of the room.Bran, its one thing to fight, even kill those things Nerezza sends at us.But human beings?Killers, he thought, but only nodded.There are ways to defend, even attack, without spilling blood.Im working on just that here for Annika.She looked in the cauldron, frowned at the amber liquid.What is it?Thats where I could use your help.Ive nearly done the mix, but what I add, how I proceed depends on what shape it will take.What will it do?Deflect.Destroy, yes, what is conjured from the dark, as it will deflect with light.A shield?Im considering.He circled the cauldron as he spoke.A small shieldshes agile enough to learn to use it, move with it.But she wouldnt have her hands free.Also a consideration.A kind of breastplate, perhaps, but then it would be stationary, only move as she moves.She wouldnt be able to defend herself from both front and flank, or only as she turns, and even as quick as she is ...She could see Annika in a breastplatethe lithe and lovely warrior princess.How would it work, exactly?With a beam of light.The beam strikes whats made of dark.Deflects, destroys.The shield might be  			Can it be two?she interrupted.Two shields?No, I was thinking bracelets.Like cuffs.I may not know my superheroes like Sawyer, but I know Wonder Woman.He laughed as Sasha brought up her arms, punched them out.Wonder Woman.Well then, of course.Shell have her magic bracelets, have her hands free, and be able to deflect and defend from any angle.Thats quite brilliant, fidh.Can you make them pretty?Shell wear whatever you give her, but pretty would make her happy.I can do that.He cupped a hand under Sashas chin, tugged her up for a kiss.In fact, well add what will look like a design, and will add power and protection.He moved across the room to his books, chose one, began to flip through it.Here.This will do well, I think.He gestured to her.Is it Celtic?It is, yes.My blood, and the power and protection will be imbued by me.Would you draw them?Two bracelets carrying this design.As you see them.All right.Let me get a sketch pad.She hurried to her room and back, already imagining the cuffs.About an inch wide, she thought, slightly rounded, with a thin edginglike a tight braid.And Brans Celtic symbols circling them.You didnt say how theyll clasp.He only smiled.Magick.No beginning or end, he added.A true circle.As he spoke, he chose a curl of wire.Bronze.For a warrior.With his free hand he levitated the cauldron a few inches, flashed fire under it.No blade, no steel.All light.And in light the power to defend, to deflect.To destroy what comes from the dark source, to defend against what wishes to harm.The blood of the warrior.He held up the vial, turned it over to let the three drops spill into the cauldron.And of the magician.Using the same knife, he used the tip on his own finger, added three drops of blood.Power and light bound by blood, cored by the ancients.Now he let the wire drift into the quietly bubbling liquid.Stirred by wind.He blew on his outstretched palm, and the liquid stirred.Sparked by fire.The flames rose and lapped the pot, glowing red.With water from both storm and sea to cure.And earth from holy ground to bless.Water first, spilled brilliantly blue from the bottle he chose, then earth, deeply, richly brown.Do you have the sketch?Shed drawn them, but could barely breathe now.Power thumped in the air, and the air had gone as blue as the water hed poured.In it, he was the light, radiating it.When he turned his head to look at her, his eyes were onyx.She held out the sketch.He said nothing as he studied it, but nodded.He held it high in both hands.Power of thee, power through me.Forge the weapons for the light, through them run the magicks bright.Blessed by thee, given by me to a warrior in this fight.With them grant her might for right.In this image form them, with our blood burn then.Spark now fire, wild and free!The sketch flared, flamed in his hand, and the flash that remained of it shot into the cauldron.As I will, so mote it be.He held his hands over that flash, those sparks.Cool now.And it is done.It was just a room now, in the quiet light of coming evening, with the cauldron sitting quiet on the stone pedestal.I cant breathe, she told him.He turned quickly, the eyes that had been so wildly intense now filled with concern.No, I dont mean She waved him off.Its just.Breathless.That was magnificent, and Im breathless.Its a complex and layered business to create a tangible thing from elements and will.It takes considerable energy.I could see that.Does it frighten you?Not when its you.No.He held out a hand.Come, see what weve conjured.I didnt  			Your sketch.So what came from youbeauty and imageryis also in this.He took her hand, and with his other, reached into the cauldron.The cuffs were exactly as shed drawn them, down to the etched symbols, the thinly braided edges.The bronze glowed in the lowering light.Can I ...Of course.She ran her fingertip over them.Theyre beautiful.Shell love them for that alone.I love ...I love that you made them for her, that you understood she needed another way, and made something strong and beautiful and from light.You ...Swamped in emotion, she looked up into his eyes.You really do leave me breathless.Beyond the power, Bran.Whatever happens, this time with you?Its changed my life.Its opened it.Youve changed mine.He took her face in his hands, kissed her gently.Enriched it.Ill make you a vow, fidh, though I dont have the sight.When we take the stars to where they belong, well stand together, just like this, in their light.Thats a vow I want both of us to keep.Then trust we will.She leaned against him a moment, staring out at the sky, the seathe promontory where she knew theyd also stand together in the teeth of a storm.Its getting lateI lost track.You and I are on kitchen detail.Thats a bloody shame, as I can think of something Id like to do with you much more.Hold the thoughtbut Riley needs a meal before sunset.And you should give Annika her bracelets.If you must be practical.Then youll take a walk with me later.A walks what youd like to do with me much more?First.He took the bracelets she gave back to him, then her hand.I think well have had enough of battle plans and tasks, he said as they started down.And Id like a walk in the moonlight with you.Then its a date.She saw Annika playing tug of war with Apollo with a thick hunk of rope.You should take them to her, and Ill get started on dinner.When she left him to it, Bran started across the lawn.Apollo broke off the game long enough to bound toward him for a greeting.And Annikas eyes widened when she saw the bracelets in Brans hand.Oh!This is what you made for me?She pressed her palms together, laid them on her lips.Look how they glow in the sun.Theyre of light.And blood?Yours and mine.Theyre only for you, and can only belong to you, or your bloodsomeone from you, he qualified.Thank you.She took one, almost reverently, then puzzled over it.I dont know how to wear it.Is it for the wrist?Thats right.He took her hand, and the one he still held.If you want it, itll go on.But understand, its both weapon and shield.To help me fightwithout the gun or a knife.Thats right.Without a gun or knife, but with power and light.I will fight.When Bran put her fingers through the cuff, it shimmered over her hand, onto her wrist, settled there, firm and true.Annika did the same with the second.Theyre beautiful.Only you can take them off.She shook her head.Ill wear them always.Thank you.She wrapped her arms around him.Thank you.Youre welcome.Let me show you how they work.Yes, please.He lifted a hand, and formed a dark, spinning ball just above his palm, then sent it into the air.Then taking her arm, bent at the elbow, turned it toward the ball.To start, you have to think, to aim, to be deliberate.But then itll be instinct.Deflect the ball.Deflect?Your light, Annika, against the dark.Use it.He helped her this time, this first time.The thin beam of light shot from her cuff, struck the ball.I feel it, she murmured.Thats right.Do it again.She surprised him, lifting her other arm, and sent the ball wheeling.Youre a quick one.I feel it, she repeated.But what if I make a mistake?What if it strikes someone?I dont want to hurt anyone.It only harms the dark, or someone with dark purpose.It comes from me as well, and I have a vow.Sacred to me.To harm no one.What I am, what I have, I wont use to harm any but the dark.Its my vow, too.I take it with you.I will fight the dark.She lifted her arms, shot out light from both so the practice ball winged right, then left.Yes, a very quick one.Destroy it.Destroy?Ill give you another.Destroy this one.This light, brighter, sharper, struck the ball, and with a flash it vanished.If the things come back, attack us, I can do this.Theyre evil, so I can do this.Her eyes went hard, grim.I can do this and break no vow.You do this, as I do, to keep one.To destroy the dark, to find and protect the stars.These are more than a gift.Even more than a weapon.You gave me purpose.Those sea witch eyes, usually so full of fun, met his with intensity and strength.I wont fail you.I know it.I like that theyre pretty.Sasha designed them for you.He conjured another ball.Practice.Ive got kitchen duty.Ill work very hard.Could you make a second, now?The evil doesnt come alone.Good point.He made three, gave her a pat on the shoulder, then left her to it.He could hear the snap and sizzle from her light as he crossed the lawn.Sawyer stood on the edge of the terrace, his hands in his pockets, a baffled grin on his face.You made her freaking Wonder Woman.Sashas idea.It suits well, I think.Are you kidding?Look at her go.Bran glanced back, watched Annika do a running forward flip, firing at one ball from midair.Striking the other two on landing.Makes me feel like a git for ever thinking she needed to use a gun.As he had with Annika, he gave Sawyers shoulder a pat, and went to the kitchen.* * *  			Annika showed off her new moves before dinner, proving herself a tireless as well as a quick study.I wouldnt mind a pair of those.Hands on hips, Riley watched Annika flash the trio of balls while executing a series of tumbles.Three nights a month youd need four.She sent Sawyer a sidelong look.Har har, she said and took his beer.Are you sure she cant miss and zap one of us?Very.As instructed, Bran slid the fish from grill to platter.Youd feel somethinglike a bit of static electricity.Does that include wolf form?Its still you, isnt it?Yeah, it is.Maybe we should test it out anyway.Sawyer can be the target.And a har har back.No joke, we should Riley broke off as her phone signaled.Hold on.Sasha brought out a bowl of sauted vegetables in pasta and a round of bread on the cutting board.Thats dinner, she announced.Sawyer gave a whistle of approval when Annika blasted all three balls out of the air.Talk about dead eye.Riley shoved her phone away as she sat.The word from two sources is Malmon is currently in Londonso something we shouldnt have to worry about for now.She looked out, judging the position of the sun and her time.I like to sleep in, when I can, after the last night.I guess thats not happening.We drill at dawn.Doyle heaped food on his plate.I like to drill.Annika plopped into the chair beside Sawyer.Some of its like dancing.* * *  			Through the globe Nerezza watched them.It infuriated her that the images were blurred, as if through layers of gauze.The witch, she thought, had drawn a curtain, and had more power than shed bargained for.Not enough, not nearly enough, but infuriating.She set the globe aside, picked up her goblet to drink.Let them think they were protected.Let them feast and laugh.For when she was done, the laughter would be screams.She called one of her creatures so it perched on the arm of her chair while she skimmed her fingertip over the rough ridges of its face.She could send an attack, just to watch them scramble like ants, but it seemed wiser to let them have that feast, to let them believe theyd won some battle.And let them lead her to the Fire Star.When they didif they couldshe would take it.She would rip them to pieces, crush their bones to dust, paint the sea with their blood.She wearied of waiting, wearied of only watching through the curtain of magic.She stroked her creature nearly into slumber.Then snapped the head from its body with one vicious twist.She added some of its blood to the goblet as a woman might add cream to her tea.She imagined, as she drank, it was the witchs blood, and his power ran in to twine with her own.SEVENTEEN     			She swam through cool blue water, strong and sure.It called to her, like a song, and she wanted only to answer.Even when her lungs burned and begged for airjust one gulp of airshe swam on.She saw the change of light, a kind of beckoning, and risked all to dive still deeper.Even when her arms weakened, her kicks faltered, she never thought of the surface.Only the light.Only the song.Close, so close.Tears burned behind her eyes as her body betrayed her.She could see the mouth of the cave, but knew now she couldnt reach it.She wasnt strong enough.As the light began to blur, the song to dim, hands grabbed her.She sucked in air that scored her throat, gagged on dream water filling her lungs.And stared into Brans dark eyes.Thank the gods.He dragged her to him, rocked them both.You stopped breathing.I was drowning.Youre here.Here with me.There was a light, and I wanted to reach it.Had to.I was swimming for it, but I wasnt strong enough.I was drowning.A dream.Not a prophecy.He wouldnt permit it.Youre stressed, thats all.We dive tomorrow Today, he thought, as dawn crept close.And youre stressed.I was alone.Not diving, not with a tank.And I wasnt strong enough.You wont be alone.Well stay back today.Ill stay with you here.Its not what were meant to do.You know that.The dream doesnt make sense.I wouldnt dive without a tank.And I wasnt afraid, Bran.More ...mesmerized.Until I realized I couldnt do it.Do what?Get to the light.The cave.Stress, she said with a nod.Sometimes a dreams a dream.Im still the weak linkphysically.Im sorry I scared you.Only to the marrow of my bones.Come, rest a little longer.If I get up now, I can get coffee in before Doyle starts cracking the whip.I think itd be worth it.Well have coffee then.In that moment, with his fear still circling the edges, she could have had anything in his power to give.Sasha, if when were diving, anything reminds you of the dream, you need to let me know.You wont be alone.Thats a promise.* * *  			She felt calm.The dream left her no residual upset or worries.In fact, it barely felt real.And after twenty minutes under the crack of Doyles whip, absolutely nothing was real except sweat and quivering muscles.She managed six ( ish) push upshalf ass push ups according to Doyleand three quarters of one pull up.By the time she stepped onto the boat, she felt shed been running at top speed for half the day.She doubted anything could feel better at that moment than lowering her sore butt onto a padded bench, lifting her face to the sun, and letting the salty breeze flow over her.And all while the greens of Corfu gleamed against the blue.Other boats swayed in their slips or sailed across the wateras they would soon do.She could see the colors of shops and restaurants, the movement of people already strolling.On the rails of narrow balconies on a small hotel, beach towels flapped.The breeze carried a mix of voices and languages to her, the scent of sunscreen and lemons, strong Greek coffee, a tang of smoke.And wasnt that a wonder of its own, she mused, all that life, so different from what shed known, bustling on around them?Families on holiday, shopkeepers opening their doors for the days business, couples sitting at tables at pavement cafes, enjoying the sights and sounds and scents just as she was as they lingered over breakfast.None of them knew, she thought, there were dark hearts wanting power so greedily they would destroy all else.The little girl in the pretty pink capris with a ribbon trailing from her curly ponytail, bouncing along between her parents, or the old man with the weathered face and peaked cap drawing deep on his cigarette while his coffee steamed in front of him.The impossibly handsome man swabbing the deck of a nearby boat, and flashing a grin at the trio of girls who sent him flirtatious looks as they passed by.They didnt know worlds hung in the balance.For them, it was only a beautiful spring morning on an island floating green on a blue sea.Youre far away.Bran sat beside her.No, actually.Im right here.Right here and right now, and its really wonderful.Im going to come back, she decided on the spot.When there is only the right here and right now.Im going to have coffee right over there, and browse those shops.Im going to buy an insanely colorful scarf, and something utterly useless and beautiful, then drink kumquat wine in the middle of the day.She angled her head, smiled.Maybe youll come drink it with me.I could be persuaded.Doyle eased the boat out of the marina, away from the bustle, the scents, all that life.Sasha grabbed her sketch pad to draw a quick perspective of the village from the water.She would remember the bright colors, the sun bleached ones when she painted it.A dreamy watercolor, she decided, so that edge of a world seemed just slightly mystical and unreal.She flipped the page overanother sketch of the cliffs, all those browns and greens, the texturesand the beach where people already staked their claim for the day.Lost in the work, she barely noticed Bran get up to help Riley and Annika with the diving equipment, hardly heard over the motor, the wind, Doyle and Sawyer discussing the maps.Content, half dreaming, she took off her shoes, stood to remove her shirt, shorts.Shed pulled her hair back in a tail for the dive, and now set her hat on her clothes, all neatly folded on the bench.Despite the bright sun, she set her sunglasses on the pile.The light was a white flash striking the water, deepening the blue to breathless.The foam of it in the boats wake, the lap and splash of it against the hull as it took them into a gentle curve toward land struck like music.It pulled at her, at everything inside her.She stood on the bench, then on the rail.Then simply dived into the song.Bran turned first, had a split second to see her disappear under the water.Stop the boat!He grabbed a life ring, heaved it back, shooting power with it so it dropped on the surface where Sasha had gone in.Shes gone over.Sashas gone over, he said as he kicked off his shoes.She dreamed she drowned.For Christs sake.Wait!Riley grabbed his arm.Get your tank.She might need the air.Doyle!Already turning.Bran strapped on the tank, cursing the precious seconds it took, then rolled into the water.Get tanks, weigh anchor.We need to  			I can find her, Annika interrupted Rileys frantic orders.As Sasha had, she simply dived in.Holy shit.Strapping his tank over his T shirt, Sawyer kept the life ring in view.Nerezza mustve done something to them.Lets move.He was in the water moments after Annika.Doyle tossed Riley a face mask.Shes got a sorcerer in love with her.Hell get to her.Riley snapped on the sheath with her diving knife.Lets make damn sure of it.She swam through the cool blue water, consumed by the song.It played in her head, her heart, through her blood, more beautiful than any sound ever heard.She saw the light up ahead, a lovely glow through the blue, pulsing, pulsing with the music.She dived deeper, yearning for it.Deeper still even when her lungs ached.She could all but feel the warmth of it, just beyond the reach of her fingertips, struggled to swim closer while her strokes faltered.Not strong enough.Despair flooded her at her own weakness, at the frail human need for air when all she craved was nearly within her grasp.It all blurredlight, pulse, songas her body went limp.She began to sink in the blue, her hand stretched toward the beauty.Hands grabbed her.Helpless, she breathed in water as she was propelled forward.Blinding light, sudden warmth.Then nothing.Annika dragged her up, broke the surface of the water.In the cave, that water seemed to sing as it flowed up and over rock.Light shimmered blue as moonbeams.She has no breath.Weeping, Annika hugged Sasha to her as Bran shot up beside her.Can you help her?Yes, yes.He wouldnt lose her.Boosting himself onto the wide lip of rock, he pulled Sasha up.He pressed a hand on her heart, pushed power there.And lowering to her, gave her his breath.For an instant that lasted a lifetime, he knew true fear.He wouldnt be enough.He would be too late.Then her heart stirred under his hand.She coughed up water.He turned her gently as the others surfaced, and kept his hand pressed to her heart when she gasped in air.There you are now.Ill never tell you its just a dream again.There you are, a ghr.He lifted her, cradled her, as she shook, laid his brow on hers, rocked them both.What happened?Riley climbed up, took a hard look at Sashas face.You decided to go diving without a tank.I ...like the dream.She groped for Brans hand.I was on the boat, sketching, then ...I heard the music.It was like dreaming again.I had to find the song, the light.Nerezza.Riley bit off the name.No, no.It wasnt dark or cold.It wasnt evil.It was beautiful.Evil hides in beauty.Doyle hauled himself up with them.No.Id know.I can feel.It called for me.None of you heard it?Something, when we got closer to the cave.Riley looked up, around.This cave that isnt on any map.And the light.Bran stroked her cheek, wishing to will the color back into it.It guided us to you.You saved me, she told him, but he shook his head.Annika.She got to you first, pulled you in here.Shes faster than any of us in the water.He glanced back at her.Understandably.I couldnt let the sea take her.Annika knuckled a tear away.Her sinuous, luminous tail curved through the water.With legs I would have been too late.Sawyer, still treading water, his gaze still riveted on the sway of sapphire, emerald, hints of ruby, slowly reached out to touch the shimmery, translucent fin with a fingertip.Youre a mermaid.Well, kick my ass.That explains a lot.I couldnt tell you.I wasnt supposed to.Annika.Sasha crawled to the edge where Annika rested her arms.You saved my life.I can see a long way in the water.Like you can see on land.So I could find you, but with legs I would be slower.And still, you had no breath when I brought you up.Bran gave you his.You did this for me.She laid her hand over Annikas.Does it mean you ...you have to stay in the water now?No.I can have the legs for the land for three turns of the moon.Three months, she corrected.I swore not to tell humans, even those who would seek the stars with me.But life is sacred, even more than an oath.Anybody gives you grief, they have to go through us, Sawyer told her.He brushed a tear off her cheek.Youre a hero.Youre not mad with me?Are you kidding?You saved a life, and you gave up something important to you to do it.It was your secret.How does this ...He ran that same finger down the side of her torso over the hip of the tail.Sorry, he said quickly, and pulled his hand back.I dont mind.Im happy.Sasha is alive, and no one is angry.Now that weve established that, Doyle began, maybe we should find out just why Sasha nearly drowned to get where we are.Hard Ass has a point, Riley agreed.Its a hell of a place.She pushed to her feet.Deep inside the cliff, from my sense of direction.But accessible enough, with equipment, she added with a pointed finger at Sasha, that other divers should have found it.But its not on any of the dive maps.The simple answer?Steadier again as Sashas color had come back, Bran pushed to his feet.It isnt meant for others.It drew Sasha through what she has.Drew us all.You think the stars here?He nodded at Riley.I think if its not, a path to it is.But this fits Sashas prophecy.Were bloody well between the earth and the sea, arent we?You got that.Hands on hips, Riley scanned the cave.Small pool, wide area.A lot of rock.The walls are almost smooth, and the ceiling ...She frowned as she looked up, studied.Its almost a perfect dome shape, and the stalactites, grouped together like that?Ive never seen anything like it.Dome, a grouping like a chandelier.A holy place.Sawyer finally pulled himself out of the pool to join them.It shouldnt have light like this, as deep as it isand no sky to reflect it.He glanced down at Annika.Do you want to come upsit on the edge?Her tail swished along the water in a sparkling arc, then cleaved under.She pushed herself up.Stand, she said, and brushed water from her thigh.I like the legs.Yeah, well, theyre winners.Were going to need to have a discussion about all that, Riley decided, but since were here, well focus.If its here, and buried, were going to need tools.I can get those, but we dont want to hack at everything.Best thing is to spread out, look for anything that seems out of place.Ill start on the other side of the pool.I dont know what to look for.You got us this far, Bran reminded Sasha.Something out of place, she thought.She didnt know what was in place, as she didnt spend a lot of time in strange underwater caves.But something had brought her herebrought all of them here.Why couldnt she hear the music now, or feel that tug pulling her in the right direction?She searched with the others, running her hands over rocks, climbing over stepping ledges of them.As Riley said, the walls were smooth, almost the texture of glass.And warm, she noted, where surely they should have been cool to the touch.The air should be cool, she realizedeven coldconsidering they were beneath the surface of the sea.Where did the warmth and the light come from?She looked up at the bowl of the ceiling, the rich colors of the rock, the odd grouping of the stalactites, gleaming with wet.Even as she watched, a drop slid down the cone, fell to the rock strewn floor of the cave.She heard the drop striking rock as distinctly as a plucked harp string.Then another.As she watched, drops ran down, shimmering with lightwater striking water, water striking rockwith quick and pretty notes.A song.Not possible, of course.The speed of the liquid, the light of it, the soundthat music rising above everything.She walked closer, still looking up, held out a hand.A drop fell into her palm, warm, luminousbut not wet.It held in the cup of her hand, a perfect circle, clear as glass, with its song striking her heart.Still holding the tiny globe, she knelt on the floor of the cave.She heard someone say her name, shook her head.Not now, not now.Couldnt they see she held love, trust, hope, right in the palm of her hand?So much of it, in a single drop, and for all the worlds.She laid it, like an offering, on the small altar of stone.It rose up from it, the flame and the fire.Brilliant and beautiful, red and pure as heart blood.Thousands by thousands of facets flashed with that fire, freed now from the stone, the fiercely shining star.The Fire Star, for the new queen.Here flames passion and the fire of truth.She picked it up, held that wildly burning light in her cupped hands.Here is power and strength and fiery justice to light the heavens of all the worlds in the name of Aegle, the radiant.She held it up and out, and the tears flooding her eyes were of pure joy.It is found.It is freed.And all we are must hold it safe until we return it with its sisters to Oilen na Gloine, so they will shine for all, forever, over all worlds.She looked down at the star, sighed.And when she looked up, her eyes were clear of visions.Im not dreaming.No, fidh.Bran, whod come to stand with her, laid his hands on her shoulders.You found it.Its real.Take it.We need to protect it from her.Shell come for it.I dont think she can come here.Riley moved closer, touched her fingertips to the flame.Not to this place.Its all light and heat, she noted.Theres no solidity.But ...I swear I can feel it hum.Does it have weight?No, but I can feel it.I cant explain.Here.Riley took it from Sashas hand.Mass without weight, she added.Active flame that doesnt burn.I cant physically feel the shape of it, but I can sense it.We can save the scientific analysis for later, Doc.Doyle kept one eye on the pool, one hand on his diving knife.If she comes at us here, weve got nothing but a couple of knives, magic bracelets, and whatever Bran can pull out of his hat.We not only need to get this to the surface, but stowed away where she cant get at it.And when we get it to the surface?Sawyer gestured to Riley, took his turn holding the Fire Star.What then?Do you see what kind of light its pumping out?People on the mainland are going to see it, so just how do we keep it on the down low?I can shield it, Bran said.Hopefully.And Doyles right, were not well fortified here, if she can get through to us.We need to get the star back to the villa, as quickly as we can.Then youd better take it.Sawyer offered it to Bran.Youre the most fortified wherever we are.Sasha, you should stick with him.Use my tank to get back to the boat.I can make it that far  			No, I cant take your oxygen.Ive got the compass if I need it, but Im a strong swimmer.I can get Sawyer back to the boat, very fast.A mermaid ride?Thats e ticket.He grinned at Annika.No way Im turning that down.That works best.Bran cupped his free hand over the star.To protect, to respect, to shield, to hold.He circled his hand around the star, forming a globe.Inside, the star shimmered, but quietly now.Nice, Riley told him.Im happy you think so.Ive worked on that for quite some time.And since its the first Ive used it on the actual star, I cant say for certain how long it might hold.We should go.Suit up.Sawyer picked up his tanks.Dont give me that look, he said to Sasha.Ive got transportation if I need it with Aqua Girl here.You and Bran get the star back to the boat.Weve got your back.Ill take point with Riley.Doyle hooked on his own tanks.Annika and Sawyer on their six.As soon as everyones on board, we head back.He looked at Bran.For Christs sake, dont drop that thing.He jumped into the pool, and when Riley followed suit, did a surface dive and was gone.Bran gave Sashas hand a squeeze.Ready?We have to be.Im with you.Holding the shielded star close to his side, he went in the water with her.Sasha swam away from the light, but looked back toward it twice until she saw Sawyer, then Annika, iridescent tail flashing, coming behind them.She pushed herself, quickening her strokes so Bran wouldnt have to slow his own to keep pace with her.Away from the cave and the light she got a better sense of just how far and deep shed traveled.Fresh concern for Sawyer had her turning to look back.Something flashed toward her, sharp teeth gleaming like silver, eyes glowing virulent yellow.Defenseless, she could do nothing but try to evade.Bran swept a hand through the water.She felt the power of the current even as what came at themand what came with himspun away.When Bran gestured for her to go up, to surface, she shook her head.She saw both Riley and Doyle slashing at oncoming beasts with their diving knives.She wouldnt desert friends.She prepared to fight, bare handed, saw Sawyer slam his knife into the belly of what looked like a small shark with a massive maw.Annikas tail slashed out, swept a line of them away with a force that turned them to oily black smudges on the water.Something hit her like a battering ram in the back, sent her tumbling helplessly in the water.Three circled her, maws wide, teeth gleaming.She punched out, kicked out, adrenaline screaming through her as her fist seemed to sink into the spongy ooze of their bodies.Lightning struck; their bodies exploded.Annika streaked by, tail slashing attackers, as she pulled Sawyer with her.Bran wrapped one arm around Sasha, and rode the lightning to the surface.He all but shoved her up the ladder onto the boat where Sawyer leaned over the rail coughing up water.Annika, he managed.She went back.Riley.Doyle.Before Sasha understood, Bran pushed the star into her hand, and plunged back into the water.No!Stop.Though he staggered a bit, Sawyer grabbed her arm before she could go over the side.Take the star into the wheelhouse.Keep under cover as much as you can.I need a fucking tank.He unhooked hers, would have put it on, but Riley surfaced, gripped the ladder.Setting the tank aside, Sawyer leaned over to help pull her up.How bad?he demanded.Bran blasted some of them.If he hadnt As Sawyer had for her, she reached down, grasped Doyles arm.Bran.Annika.Clutching the star, Sasha ran to the side of the boat.Right behind me.Find something to hold on to, Doyle warned them.Were getting out of here fast.Lightning snapped out of the water, and Bran with it.Even as he pulled himself up, Annika flew up, the powerful sweep of her tail shooting off light.In midair, she flipped to the boat, landed on her hands, then just tumbled to the deck.Shes bleeding.Sawyer dropped to his knees beside her.Who isnt?Riley demanded, but she lowered as well.How bad is it?she asked Annika.Not very bad.Not like before.But ...Her eyes widened, and she pointed toward the sky.Look!More came, like a swarm of wasps.Doyle started the engines, pushed them for top speed.As they bulleted over the water, Sawyer shook his head.Not going to be fast enough.Go, up front with Doyle.Bran pushed Sasha forward.Were not going to outrun them in this.Accepting, Riley gripped her knife.Yeah, we can.Maybe, Sawyer added as he pulled out the compass.Stay down, he told Annika, braced himself against her.Everybody hold the hell on.Sasha turned into Bran, holding the star between them.Held tight as Sawyer reeled off a series of numbers.It was like being pushed through space, so fast it stole the breath.Her legs buckled; her head spun as the world whirled around her.Then she was falling, as if from a great height, to land with a rattling thump that would have knocked her down if Bran hadnt held her.Son of a bitch, it worked!Sawyer gave the compass a loud kiss.Son of a bitch!Were back at the villa.Riley cradled a wounded arm.And were still in the freaking boat.They stood, all six, on the deck of the boat.And the boat moored on the lawn between villa and seawall.Apollo ran circles around it, barking joyfully.Ive never shifted that many people.Sawyer shrugged.I figured wed just try for the whole deal.Well worry about it later.Were still in the freaking boat, Riley repeated.And it wont take her long to send them after us again, Doyle pointed out.We need to get the star inside, and get ready for a fight.Please take it.Sasha held the star out to Bran.Its safest with you.We need to dress the wounds.I remember what to get.Longitude and latitude, right?Riley hoisted herself off the boat.The numbers you said before you took us on the ride.Yeah.Always have the coordinates of home base right here.Sawyer tapped his temple.The whole freaking boat, she said again and, clutching her bleeding arm, started for the villa.Doyle jumped off the side, looked at Bran.Youre sure about your plan for the star?As sure as I can be.Ill need some time for it.And need some time to call a storm.One that will knock her back, give us a clear path to go.Wherever we need to go.When youre ready, well hold them off for you.Us, Sasha corrected.Ill be with him.I saw it, she said before Bran could argue.I painted it.I lived it.She turned toward the terrace steps.Its not negotiable.Rather than argue, he took the star inside.Hed do what he needed to do when the time came to do it.Alone.EIGHTEEN     			Sasha wondered if tending wounds would ever become routine.Would she become so used to blood and gouged flesh that the sight, the smell, the feel of it would no longer cause her stomach to tighten, her pulse to quicken?She knew what to dosome was simply instinct, but Bran was a good teacher.She cleaned the gash on Rileys arm first, judged under normal circumstances the wound would require at least a dozen stitches.Calmly she coated the gash with Brans salve while Bran worked on Sawyer, and Doyle kept watch, sword at the ready now, at the doorway.She wont send them yet, or come.As she spoke, Sasha added drops to a glass of water, handed it to Riley.Drink it all.Coming at us when were bleeding gives her an advantage.Expecting her to come at us when were bleeding negates the advantage.And we confused her, Sasha added.Or Sawyer did.We vanished, boat and all.She has to think about that.And shes very angry.We have the star.Our finding it was one thing, but she wasnt able to snatch it right out of our hands as she thought she would.She began to tend to Rileys other woundsall minor when compared to the gashand realized everyone had stopped to look at her.How do you know?Doyle demanded.I dont know, but I do.I can feel her rage.And ...she hasnt been able, yet, to break through the shield Bran put around the house.I think she will, but not when shes blind with anger.We have a little time.Youve connected with her.Youve opened enough to make that connection.Be careful, fidh, Bran warned.As she may feel, as you do, and do the same with you.Theres only hate and anger and this terrible need.Shes mad with it.Madness can still be canny, Bran reminded her.Shell come harder now.Sawyer winced as Bran tended the gouges that scored his side.Once she regroups.We have something she wants.She was just playing around before, giving us grief.She wanted us to find the star, because she couldnt.Id say thats a bulls eye.Riley rose, rolled the shoulder of her injured arm, flexed her biceps.Good job.I barely feel it.We could go somewhere else.Annika turned so Sasha could clean the wounds on her back.Mostly nicks and scratchesBrans bracelets worked well.Sawyer could take us somewhere else, away.I think I could.I have to admit, six people and a boats a first for me, but I think I could do it.When the time comes I believe I can give you and your compass a boost.But ...Bran looked at Doyle, got a nod.We know the ground here, and for the moment are safe.We need some time to regroup, just as she does.And the star comes first, Riley concluded.But if weve got time, I want a damn beer and some food.She walked to the fridge, pulled out leftovers, cheese, olives.An army runs on its stomach, right?Foods energy.Sawyer managed a weak smile.I dont have much left after puking up a couple gallons of seawater, then hauling your asses and the boat.Ill make you food.Annika took Sawyers hand, rubbed it against her cheek.I didnt get you back fast enough.Anni, without you, I wouldntve gotten back at all.Ive got this.Riley pulled bread out of a cupboard, then chips.What Id like is a little more detail on how a mermaids walking around.I couldnt tell you before.Im the last one whod poke you on that one.But hows it work?We have magicians, too.She smiled at Bran.And we also look for the stars, to protect them, to one day take them back to the sky.For some, this is their purpose.So it is for my family.And in every ...I dont know the word.But one is chosen, and trained.Unto every generation a Slayer is born?I do not kill.Now Sawyer smiled more easily.Its a quote.How are you chosen?The Light chooses.A ceremony when we are of age.The Light is taken from its chest by the sorcerer, and it will shine on the one chosen.Then there is the choice.We force no one, so its a choice.I chose to accept.Its sung that the one who seeks joins with five more who walk on the land, so the one who seeks is given the legs, and may walk on the land.But this gift must be held secret.Revealing is only allowed to protect the star, or to save a life.Once revealed, the seeker has only three turns of the moon to continue, and another must take her place.What if youwefind the stars?Sasha asked.Then I can be with my family, and the stars will shine over all the worlds.No one from mine has done this, but no one until now has found the five others.And we have the Fire Star.We have to keep it safe.We will.Bran turned to the globe hed set on the counter, with the star shimmering inside.I have a place where it will be safe, where she cant reach it.Not with us?Doyle turned away from his watch.Im sworn to guard it.As am I.  If we keep it with us, we risk her getting through uswe all know she wont stop trying just that.But if its not with us, even if she gets through, she wont have it.I dont much like the idea of not being able to keep an eye on it, Riley said.Just where are you talking about?Its best to show you.Ill be a minute.When he left the room, Riley scowled into her beer.If its not with us, whats to stop her from finding the hiding place, just walking the hell away with it?Im not risking that.And she damn well wont get through me.Like the others, Sawyer studied the star.Ive got to lean with Riley and Doyle on this.Ive spent damn near ten years looking, and now weve got the first of them, and burying it somewhere doesnt sit right.Weve handled what shes thrown at us so far.Bleeding, nearly drowning, Sasha pointed out.And with the opinion shes just been playing with us.What happens when she gets serious?If its away from us, how can we know its safe?Tentatively, Annika reached out a hand for the globe.When her fingers brushed it, the star inside pulsed.Were still not a team, not a unit.Even after all this.Weary, Sasha turned to the sink to wash blood and salve from her hands.You dont trust, not enough to wait to see and understand what he means to do.You dont trust what we are if you really believe we can only keep it safe if we can see it, or touch it.She turned back, grabbed up Rileys beer, took a deep gulp.For Gods sake.For Gods sake!Im standing here after yet another battle withI dont know what to call themher minions?Thatll do.Her minions.Cleaning up blood while this god star sits on the kitchen counter as casually as a toaster.Im standing here with a mermaid, a lycan, a man who can zip through time and spaceand whatever the hell Doyles got going he hasnt decided to tell us.I was fine living my life.Fine!My work, my house, the quiet.Id learned to deal with what I hador to ignore it so I could just live the life I thought I wanted.Now Im fighting some power crazed god whod like to end my life altogether.Im in love with a magician and shooting a crossbow.And Im drinking beer when I dont even like beer.Every one of you, every single one, has been on thisthis questor known about it for years.Ive known for weeks, so why am I the only one here who can reach down and pull out some goddamn trust when the person with power tells us he has a way?Ass, Sawyer muttered, consider yourself kicked.I dont want to kick anyones ass.I dont want to rant like this, and I cant seem to stop.God, I think I need to sit down.As she started to, she saw Bran in the doorway, his gazedark and intenselocked on her face.Just had a little meltdown, she managed, and did sit.Id apologize to everyone, but I think I had some valid points mixed in with the tirade.More valid points than tirade, Riley told her.Annika poured a glass of wine, brought it to Sasha.Im apology.Ill give you waiting to hear the plan.Doyle leaned back on the counter, nodded to Bran.So lets hear it.I thought of it sitting on the terrace of the hotel, the first day.It needed some work, he added, and laid the painting on the table.My paintingthe one you said youd bought.Before I met you, yes.I sent for it.I told you I knew these woods, this path.Because Ive walked that path through those woods, toward that light.I have a place there, of my own.In Ireland.Yes, near the coast in Clare.A place I happened upon some time ago.It spoke to me, so I built a home there, though Sligo had always been mine before.This place, at the end of the path and into the light called to me.And to you, or why else would you have painted it?Why else would I have wandered into that gallery and seen it, and known it for mine?Theres a purpose in things, and this is clearly purposeful.The star will be safe there.I believe with all I am it will be beyond her there.Okay.Riley shoved up to pace.Okay, I get it.Thats a powerful and strong connection.And Im giving Sash her valid points.We should have more trust.But how do we get it there?Tap Sawyer for another zipcan you get us all that way?If I had the coordinates, yeah, I think so.Ive a better way, the way Im sure it stays beyond her.I can send it through the painting.Thats fucking genius.Is that even possible?Riley demanded.Because its fucking genius, and makes me want to kick my own ass for doubting you had a solid plan.Its my place, and Sashas vision of it, here.Its possible, yes.Doyle stepped over to the table.Through the painting to the coast of Clare.Where your people were from.Bran gave Doyle a long, cool study.I think thats not without purpose either.Doyle looked up into Brans eyes, then shifted his gaze to Sasha.Trust comes hard, but you have mine for this.Were six, all linked to each other, to a purpose, to a quest, Bran added, brushing a hand over Sashas.We must all agree.Sawyer scanned the room, nodded.So say we all.Then.Bran walked over, lifted the star in its shielding globe.He set it gently on the painting, in the glow of light at the end of the path.If so say we all, each lay a hand on the globe, and say this.Together:  			To protect this bright fire, this pure light, I send it safe where no eye can see, no hand can touch, no darkness shadow.As they echoed his words, Bran lifted his own hands up, seemed to draw power out of thin air.It swirled around the globe.As he lowered his hands, fingers spread over the hands of the others, the star began to sink into the painting.Its fire sparked and simmered on that quiet path in sudden and brilliant reds and golds.Then it poured toward the light, illuminated all.And went quiet.I could feel it.Riley lifted her hand, turned it over.The heatits all yours, Branthe power of it.And nownothing.Its safe.But the paintings a kind of portal to it, right?
