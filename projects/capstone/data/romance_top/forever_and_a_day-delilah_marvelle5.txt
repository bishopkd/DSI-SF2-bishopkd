Your mouth is much bigger than the rest of you.I think you have a tendency to forget that.Moving around her, he purposefully bumped her aside with his large frame, making her stumble.Robinson.She darted in front of him and shoved at his muscled weight.Grabbing hold of his exposed wrist, she tried to grab the pail.Give it to me.He yanked it up high into the air, breaking her grasp on his wrist with a swift tug, and stared her down with lethal calmness.If you think that I will ever let you pump water in my stead, knowing what its done to my hands, you are delusional, woman.Delusional.You are never touching this pail again.Now bite down on that tongue of yours for one long breath and get thee upstairs.Rounding her, he lowered the pail back down to his side and stalked toward the closed door.Bless him for being the only man in the ward to have thought of saving a womans hands.She jogged after him, grabbed hold of his arm and drew him back toward herself.Robinson.My hands are used to the work.If you want, you can go back to the pump on the morrow, after we  He jerked his arm out from her grasp.If I want to pump water for you, regardless of whether my hand is raw or not, you have no say.He shoved past her.Jumping toward him, Georgia forcefully ripped the pail out of his left hand, and flung it aside with an echoing clang against the nearest wall.Youre done.He narrowed his gaze as he rounded her to go get the pail.Oh, no, you dont.Gritting her teeth, she grabbed him hard by the linen of his shirt with both hands and used every ounce of her strength to shove him hard against the wall behind them.Tipping her full weight into that muscled mass, she made him stumble back against the wall with a solid thud.His hands jumped up to steady her and keep her from altogether falling aside and onto the floor.Georgia glared up at him, disregarding that she was draped against him like some wanton in need of a quick dollar.Ive been doin this all my life, she rasped, tightening her hold on his linen shirt to balance herself.Long before you and your gentlemanly ways ever came along, and as you can see, me and my hands are still here.Theres no need for you to puss up your hands in some stupid effort to prove yourself to me.You want to prove yourself?Do so by havin some respect for your hand, because thats all I want and thats all I need from you right now.His eyes darkened.Let me tell you what I want and what I need, and I can assure you, it doesnt involve water.He grabbed her hard by the waist and forcefully spun them around so fast, her heart popped.He shoved her back against the wall, making her gasp.Pinning her solidly into place with his body, he lowered his gaze and methodically watched his own hands trail up her waist and round up to her breasts, before sliding up to the curve of her throat.He sensually grazed her skin with his knuckles before sliding both hands into her knotted hair.She could barely breathe against the feel of his hands.Tightening his fingers against her hair, he tilted her face toward his.His chest rose and fell heavily against her own heaving bosom as he pressed her harder against the wall.My hands matter not to me.You matter to me.Do you understand?You.If I wish to make my hands bleed to ensure that your life is a bit easier, allow me that.Or, by God, I will rip all of your clothes off in an effort to make you feel half of what is pounding through my veins here and now.Do you understand?She swallowed, her heavy breaths mingling with his in the quiet narrow corridor.Her world faded knowing that this incredible man desired not just her body, but her mind and her heart.Georgia Milton.From Orange Street.The erotic tension in his muscled body that held her dominantly in place and the way those strong fingers dug into her hair made her want to rip his clothes off.If you want to rip off all of my clothes she breathed out then do so.But youre not goin back to that pump.He lowered his chin.You would let me rip off all of your clothes?She swallowed, unable to breathe or think or care about anything but physically embracing this raw, carnal passion pulsing between them.You wouldnt have to.I would willingly take them off.He held her gaze for a long, searing moment.Are you telling me that you want this?He pressed even closer to her, so that she could feel all of him.Tell me you want me, Georgia.I need to hear you say it.She felt herself growing wet in response to his unashamed grinding.She tilted her face up toward him despite the strong hold he had on her against the wall.I want you.His hold tightened, those fingers digging into her.You are supposed to tell me to desist, Georgia.For Gods sake, tell me to desist, before I ravage you here and now.Dont think I wont.Tis all Ive been able to think about.He was such a gentleman in the most inconvenient of times.You havent done anythin yet.Do somethin, already.He stared her down before lowering his mouth to hers, crushing it against her lips.Shifting his body against hers, he pressed his erection into her corseted stomach and demanded more of her mouth, never once pausing as he tilted his head to mold and remold himself against her.They kissed more and more ruthlessly, their tongues battling and their heated breaths mingling until they were both gasping against each others lips.She felt herself physically unfolding to the point of trembling.Blindly sliding her hands down his firm chest, she rounded his muscled thigh and rubbed it.It had been four long years since shed known passion.She never thought shed be able to cradle it again.Until now.Finding the rigid length pressing against the flap of his trousers, she achingly rubbed at the rounded tip of his hard cock, trying to feel him through the smooth wool.His fingers tightened their savage hold, tugging on her hair, making her scalp burn.He broke their kiss.Georgia.His breaths were ragged as he sensually moved against her stroking hand with the slow, even roll of his hips.Not here.Upstairs.I want to lay you out and count every freckle.She rubbed him through his trousers again.Whilst counting the freckles would be fun, every man drags a woman off into bed.But youre not every man, Robinson, and Im not every woman.Which is why well do it here and well do it now.He captured her gaze, his hips pausing.In public?She paused from stroking him.Have you no sense of adventure, oh, Sal pirate of mine?This here be the high seas I speak of.It isnt the adventure or the high seas Im worried about.He glanced toward the closed door leading out into the street and pressed into her.What if someone walks in?Then they do.She frantically unbuttoned his flap, shoved his undergarments aside and slid his warm, hard length out.A shaky breath of disbelief escaped her as she slid her fingers around that velvety hard length.She couldnt believe that she was touching him like this.He searched her face and tightened his hold on her.Georgia, you cant be bloody serious.She paused and drawled up at him, Youre spoilin the mood, you know.I kind of feel like Eve arguin with a priest over what to do with an apple.You mind that tongue.He pressed her back against the wall and growled out, You may be Eve, but Im no priest.He fisted and jerked up her skirt, whipping it up past her thigh.Forcefully sliding his large, warm hand up between her thighs, he spread her with his fingers.Something tells me I should start here.What do you think?She gasped as he used her own moisture to rapidly flick her.She could barely breathe as his finger rubbed faster and faster.He intently held her gaze.More?Yes.More.Her chest tightened, her breaths coming in jagged takes as sensations rippled up her stomach and down past her thighs.She trembled and pushed her hips against that hand, desperately needing more.Gripping his arms in an effort to balance herself, she held his fierce gaze, feeling her moisture slowly slather his fingers as he flicked and rubbed, flicked and rubbed.Georgia bit down on an anguished moan and felt herself being pushed toward that incredible edge of bliss.Her body quaked at his heated movements.It was as if she was unleashing the man buried within.It made her feel incredibly powerful and feral knowing that she was penetrating that soul with her own passion.Do it, she whispered.Releasing her wetness, he grabbed hold of her thighs with both hands.With a wince, he yanked her up and onto his hips, straddling her around his waist.She paused.Your hand.Im not thinking about the hand.He shoved her skirts out of the way and draped them back, the tensing of his long, muscled arms holding her against the wall and himself.Im thinking about this.The ache and burn within her exposed upper thighs increased as she tightened her straddle, widening herself to him.Positioning the tip of his cock at her wetness with a quick hand, Robinson savagely thrust himself into her so hard, her back and body slammed against the plaster, vibrating the entire wall.She gasped, her core threatening to ripple and burst against his rigid length as he slammed into her again and again and again, heightening each ripple to a throat clenching crescendo.He pounded into her, knocking the breath out of her with his large, muscled body.His wide chest rose and fell with each seething breath as he quickened each ram with the bang of his hips.Although her back and shoulders pinched against each unrelenting thrust, sending her repeatedly into the plaster full force, it only seemed to erotically punctuate the pleasure raking through her overwhelmed senses.Feeling herself edging and edging into her own climax, she clung to him, reveling in watching that rugged face flush against his impending pleasure.His upper lip beaded with perspiration as his square jaw tightened in desperate control.She could feel his shoulders flexing, tensing and growing tighter beneath her hands as she frantically fisted his linen shirt, trying to remain coherent.Georgia he gritted out between each breath and thrust.He lowered his head and dug his chin into her hair, readjusting his hands on her waist.For Gods sake, do it.Do it, before I  She panted for breaths she could no longer take, racing to finish upon his command as an unrestrained moan burst through her lips, unleashing the rippling pleasure shed been grasping for.She gave in to the trembling core between her thighs and the sensation of her body tightening in pleasure.She cried out and cried out again, bucking against him and grinding down on his length, unable to believe she was still climaxing.When it ended, she rested her head limply back against the plaster, letting Robinson feverishly jerk in and out of her wetness.She had never had it last so long.It was unreal.Pull out when its time, she rasped in between fading, heavy breaths.Robinson slowed his thrusts to a mere in and out as he captured her gaze with lust heavy eyes.Holding her more firmly against the wall, he dug rigid fingers beneath her thighs and masterfully stroked in and out, in and out, holding her gaze the whole time as if showing her who was in command.Suddenly, he slid himself out of her, dragging her body off his waist and thighs.He settled her booted feet back onto the uneven wood floor, pushing down her skirts to fall back into place.Pinning her against the wall, he stared at her mouth as his hand jerked between them.He tensed.I want you to swallow me, he rasped.Will you?He closed his eyes.Sensing that he was near release, Georgia dragged herself down his muscled body and took his rigid, velvety length as he had asked.Using her hands and mouth, she stroked him rapidly.Seething out breaths, he stilled, his muscles tensing around her possessively as he grabbed her hair and trembled from his release, the warmth of his seed spurting into her mouth.He groaned and groaned again as she sucked and swallowed him until there was nothing left.Releasing him, she slowly rose back onto her feet and somewhat shyly leaned against the wall, hoping that it had been just as incredibly marvelous for him as it had for her.He grabbed her and collapsed against her; his muscled chest heaved beneath the linen of his shirt.He nuzzled his face into her hair.Georgia, he breathed out.Marry me.Marry me so we can be together always.She drew in an astonished breath.Oh, dear God.She had seduced far more than his body.She had already seduced his soul.And it was wrong.It was so bloody wrong and not in the least bit fair to him or her.Reaching down between them with trembling hands, and after pushing him back into place, she buttoned the flap.I cant marry a man without a name.It wouldnt be legal.Then give me a name, he insisted against her hair.I will take any name you give me.It still wouldnt be legal.Reaching up, Georgia cupped his face and kissed his nose and then his forehead and then the bruises still covering the right side of his jaw and cheekbone.You and I must wait.We must wait until your family comes and decide then.And what if no one comes?What then?Then her dark wish would be hers to keep and kiss and hold.Ill not make an orphan out of a man unless he truly is one.He leaned away out of her grasp.Why would you give yourself to me in so intimate a manner, only to take yourself back the moment I asked you to be mine?Do you think that because I have no name, I also have no heart?She swallowed back the anguish he was forcing her to feel and stepped toward him.Oh, Robinson.Cease this.No one has more heart than you.And yet it isnt enough.Is it?You require a name, and a man with a past, over this mere heart.He shifted his jaw and stepped farther back, his gray eyes boring into her.In a low, harsh tone that was almost eerily not his own, he bit out, How many men have you allowed to touch you in the way I just did?I want to know.She stared.I dont do this sort of thing on the hour, Robinson.He leaned toward her and narrowed his gaze.Is that supposed to be your answer?Or perhaps there are far too many to count.Is that it?She stumbled back.There was a cutting razor edge that was slicing its way out of his naive soul.Was this who he really was?A man who had been bruised to the core by other women?She narrowed her own gaze.One.Theres your damn number.One.And that one was my husband, mind you.Now I ask you, cease belittin me, considerin Id venture to say, Mr.Crusoe, given your remarkable performance, your numbers probably well above my mere one.He glanced away, his flushed features softening as he lowered his gaze.After a long moment of silence, he closed his eyes, placing shaky fingers to his forehead, and choked out, I didnt mean to I He reopened his eyes and met her gaze, tears streaking them.Forgive me, Georgia.Forgive me for suggesting that you He winced, rapidly blinking as if a headache was overtaking him.Im ruining this.Im ruining everything.Imstupid.She stepped toward him, her heart squeezing seeing his panic in having wronged her.Shh.No, you arent.Im fine.I just dont want you talkin to me like that.It isnt fair given that I only want what is best for you.Dont you understand that seizing you for myself whilst you have yet to belong to yourself isnt right?She leaned toward him, wagging her fingers toward his hand.No more pride, please.Show me.He quietly held it out, unfurling it, palm up.The entire width of his large palm, just below his fingers, had been scraped clean of its skin, welted with crusting blood.Oh, Robinson, she whispered, grasping it gently.Dont suffer like that for me again.He leaned toward her, his features twisting.I suffer more knowing that I just accused you of  The entrance door banged open, making them jump away from each other in astonishment.Matthew casually strode in with a wool sack draped over his broad coated shoulder and a folded newspaper in his bare hand.He jerked to a halt, scanning them.Am Iinterrupting something?Georgias cheeks burned as she tried to remain indifferent.Thank God he hadnt walked in moments earlier.No.I was merelylookin at his hand.Matthew paused.Whatever the hell is wrong with it?He injured it.Did he?Matthew dropped the sack onto the floor, slapping the folded newspaper into Georgias hands, and strode toward Robinson.Hand it up, Brit.Im good with wounds.Robinson edged toward the staircase, setting it behind his back.A man has his pride, you know.Not whilst hes living in the Five Points.Matthew stepped toward him and forcefully grabbed his arm out from behind his back.Pulling it upward toward himself, he shook his head.Damn.You scraped off half the skin.Hold it up.Digging into his patched waistcoat pocket, Matthew retrieved a small bottle and uncorked it with his teeth in one solid pull.Chant with me now, he said enthusiastically with the cork still wedged between his teeth.Pain is ever so beautiful and divine.Why?Because it means youre still breathing.Now hold still.Georgia bit her lip hard, her fingers crinkling the newspaper Matthew had given her to hold.She watched with a half squint as Matthew poured the entire contents of his whiskey onto the open wound.Christ.Robinson swung away, hissing out a breath through bared teeth as he repeatedly shook his hand against the effects of the liquid dripping off.It burns worse than the damn wound itself.It always does.Recorking his empty bottle with the pop of his palm, Matthew tucked it back into his waistcoat.So.I just got back from Wall Street.The clerk over at the bank informed me hell have a name and address those notes were issued to in as little as eight days.Eight days?Robinson met her gaze.Georgias heart dropped.Though he wanted her now, yes, the moment his family came and paraded him back to his lavish lifestyle, reintroducing him to who he really was, it would all come to an end.Matthew grabbed the newspaper from her and snapped it open, smacking the back of his hand against the extended page.Congratulations are in order, Crusoe.You are officially the latest in frenzied gossip to have hit this city.Even the damn clerk at the bank knew all about you, which is why he was exceptionally helpful.The New York Evening Post is rather popular within business circles.Georgia leaned over and grabbed the newspaper from Matthew.She held it up, scanning the framed words.British Gentleman in Dire Need of Assistance  The article gave a small but accurate description of his appearance, right down to the clothes he had been wearing when he first appeared at the hospital, and asked anyone who recognized him to call upon Dr.William Carter at the New York Hospital for further information.She lowered the paper, handing it off to Robinson.Bless that bastards beating heart.That was impressively quick.He must have high and mighty connections.Robinson held up the paper.Matthew strode back over to the wool sack he dropped earlier, swinging up the sack.Here.He tossed it toward her.I dug some clothes out of my trunk.Hopefully theyll fit.Georgia caught the weight.Thank you, Matthew.Robinson glanced up from the paper he was still reading.Yes.Thank you.I appreciate this.No worries.Oh, and Georgia Matthew sauntered backward toward the main entrance door and tapped at his neck with a bare finger.You, uh, might want to clean up some of the blood he smeared all over your throat.You look a bit too ravaged.He smirked.Did you have fun?Her eyes widened as she clutched the sack up higher against her chest, wishing she could crawl into that sack and dump herself in the river.Leave.Matthew adjusted the faded leather patch against his cheekbone.Im not being an arse.I just want you smiling again, the way you used to.He paused.Take him over to the dancing hole sometime.Itll be good for you.He pointed at her knowingly.Just remember that Im not playing uncle to some half Brit babe around these parts.Youll have to move out west with that, because I have a reputation to uphold with the boys.Im still Irish, mind you.Georgia pressed her lips together, completely mortified, as Matthew turned and disappeared out into the street, leaving the door wide open.She glanced over at Robinson, dreading what the poor man must be thinking.Robinson refolded the newspaper and wordlessly reached out to remove the sack from her hands.Without meeting her gaze, he turned toward the stairs.She swallowed, watching him take one stair at a time as if he was waiting for her to say something.Matthew, drat him, was right.Four sorry years had ticked by since shed last danced in the arms of a man and it wasnt as if avoiding the dancing hole was going to bring Raymond back.Tis Friday, she called up after him, hoping to break the awkward silence.After I finish the laundry and we have ourselves a bit of supper, would you be up for dancin?Theres more to life here than blisters and blood, you know.He glanced down at her, his features tightening.He turned to fully face her, leaning his broad shoulder against the wall of the staircase.Do you want me to go?Or are you asking me because Matthew insisted on it?She blinked up at him.Well, I  You are under no obligation to make me think I matter when I dont.I justI need to know what is real and what belongs to me, given that I barely exist in my own head.I will confess that I am already attached to you, Georgia, and not solely in the physical sense.In truth, I dont think I would be able to walk away from you or this.Even if you told me.Tears burned her eyes at his unexpected confession.He was truly a beautiful soul.If you promise not to break my heart, Robinson, I promise not to break yours.He pushed himself away from the wall, still intently holding her gaze.He adjusted the sack in his arms and said in a soft, low tone, Your heart is safe with me.He paused and held up his hand, showing her the gash, which glistened from the whiskey Matthew had poured on it.I should probably wrap this, he murmured, half nodding.Im sorry I didnt listen to you earlier.I was justworried about your hands.He half nodded again and, with that, quietly turned and walked up the remaining stairs with his sack.Georgia set a heavy hand on the wood banister and leaned against it, staring up after him as he disappeared through the open door of her tenement.It scared her knowing that her poor, poor heart could be broken again by allowing herself to love this nameless man.But maybe, just maybe, they would end up together and take each other and the west by storm.Everyone complains of his 						memory, but no one complains of his 						judgment.Franois de La Rochefoucauld, Maximes Morales (1678) LONG AFTER ROBINSON HAD finished helping Georgia gather up 						all of the laundered clothes from the rooftop, and they had eaten a 						surprisingly good meal of oysters and cabbage shed prepared, Robinson 						donned Matthews frayed linen shirt, along with a pair of patched wool 						trousers.Though the trousers were a bit snug against his backside, they 						were still comfortable enough for him to sit without ripping 						anything.Georgia hurried toward him, 						draped in a plain blue cotton gown that brightened not only her face but 						those playful, pretty green eyes.She unpinned her lopsided, bundled hair.Hand it over, she said, gesturing to the brush he held.Youre takin 						much too long, Miss Robinson Crusoe.It was like they had been 						married for years.He should be so blessed.Im almost done.Dipping the brush bristles into 						the clean basin of water set on the sideboard, while ensuring he didnt get 						his bandaged hand wet, he leaned toward the small cracked mirror hanging on 						the wall.He brushed his black hair back with a few side sweeps and observed 						the scruffy, dark facial hair that was noticeably in need of tending.I 						need to shave and bathe.I dont stink, do I?I would have told you.Either 						way, tomorrow morn is bathin day.Ill draw up a hip bath for the both of 						us.He lowered the brush.You mean 						weget to bathe together?Naked?She rolled her eyes and snatched 						the brush out of his hand.I meant we can share the water.A hip bath 						barely allows for one body, let alone two.Now get to waitin on the landin 						before we hit another wall and never leave.Ill be right out.Right.He awkwardly rounded 						her at the image she had conjured.Striding into the kitchen, he opened the 						door and quickly stepped out into the small corridor.Blowing out an 						exasperated breath, he fingered the linen on his bandaged hand, waiting for 						Georgia to finish tending to her appearance.He hadnt even been able to 						function around her, let alone think about anything but the way he had 						savagely taken her against that wall, banging his lust into her like some 						dog.Clearly, he was not a gentleman.Not at heart, anyway.Echoing footfalls thudding up 						the stairs made him turn.His brows rose as John eventually came into view, 						his tall, lean frame garbed in a gray waistcoat, a faded black coat whitened 						at the seams from use and a yellowing, lopsided, droopy cravat that was in 						serious need of assistance.In his bare hand, he even held a single wilting 						daisy that swayed its white petals and yellow cap against his brisk 						movements.Stepping up onto the landing 						beside him, John cleared his throat and announced coolly, Im here to see 						Georgia.Despite that sorry, lopsided 						cravat, Robinson felt somewhat underdressed in comparison, what with only a 						frayed laced shirt and overly snug trousers.She and I are going out, he 						managed, setting his shoulders.John glanced away and asked, 						Where to?Dancing.John snapped his gaze back to 						his face.You mean shes taking you to the dancing hole?He eyed him.Yes.Why?John rapidly blinked and lowered 						his gaze, fingering the flower in his hand.She must really like you, he 						muttered.She never goes.Not given its history.Robinson shifted toward him, his 						brows coming together.What history?John glanced up, leaned toward 						him and said in a quiet but harsh tone, Whatever you do, Brit, dont feck 						with her heart.I may have stupidly disappointed her by not wanting to chase 						her dream of going west, but I never once fecked with her heart.Not even 						after she tore me asunder without giving me a chance to right 						things.Robinson stared at him.Apparently, something very dark had happened to Georgia over at the dancing 						hole.Something she had yet to share with him.He flexed his hands, hating 						that he hadnt been around all this time to protect her from the 						world.Georgia suddenly appeared in the 						doorway, her thick red hair bound in two youthful, pretty, long braids.Im 						ready.She paused with her iron key in hand and scanned John.Why, John.Youre standin in a full coat and cravat.Who died?No one.I felt like dressing 						up, is all.John held out the sagging daisy.I hear youre going over to 						the dancing hole.Its been a while for me, too.Can I go with 					you?Robinson slowly shook his head.The bastard didnt even know how to go about trying.Georgia sighed, took 						the flower John offered and tucked it into her hair behind her ear.Im 						with Robinson and dont plan on dancin with anyone but 					Robinson.Biting back a grin, Robinson 						tried not to puff out his chest too much.If Georgia was already announcing to other 						men that she was his, he liked the way the night was headed.John lowered his gaze and 						offered quietly, Im not tryin to impose.I just hate the idea of sitting 						here by myself in the tenement tonight.Oh, the bastard sure knew how to 						pump a womans compassion.Georgia sighed, turned away and 						bolted the door, slipping the key back into the small pocket beneath her 						arm.Whisking back toward them, she grabbed not only Robinsons arm but 						Johns.You can come along if you want.Just dont you be startin any 						trouble.She tightened her hold, bringing them closer against herself.Id 						actually like the two of you to get to know each other outside of fists.You 						might find that you have a lot in common.John stared dubiously at him 						from over Georgias strawberry braids.Robinson returned the glare as they 						all walked in unison down the remaining stairs, bumping shoulders against 						the narrow space.Striding out the entrance door, 						they made their way into the inky, humid night.Despite the late hour, 						crowds of men with coarse, unshaven faces, accompanied with coiffed women 						whose lips and cheeks were smeared with cheap rouge, filled the streets, 						appearing and disappearing into the shadows around them.Georgia veered them to the left, 						still tightly holding on to their arms.We really shouldnt walk in 						silence.Its awkward even for me.So.What should we talk 					about?Lets talk about how Ill be 						getting each and every dance, John offered smugly.Because Brits are about 						as deaf to music as they are to women and life itself.Robinson refrained from reaching 						over and smacking him.With that sort of attitude, youll be dancing with 						the wall, or at best, a few chairs.John leaned toward him from in 						front of Georgia.You think youre funny, dont you?Well, youre not.You 						sound stupid, you feck.Georgia shook both their arms.Whilst Im flattered to be the center of all this lovely attention, it 						isnt impressive listenin to grown men bicker like women in a shop 						quarreling over who gets the last bonnet.Both he and John fell into 						silence, because God only knew neither of them wanted to sound like 						women.After directing them around a 						corner left, they all walked in silence through the darkness of narrow 						pathways and squat wood buildings lit by streetlamps and passing carts with 						flickering lanterns.In the approaching distance, the 						loud cheers of a crowd and the rhythmic stamping of feet drifted toward 						them.A brightly lit entrance from a cellar with its large oak door held 						ajar by a barrel spilled fuzzy, yellow light across the pavement, fingering 						its way to the dirt road where men with cigars between their teeth lingered.The jolting strings of a violin and the quick, rattling shakes of a 						tambourine pierced the humid air.Georgia released their arms.She 						glanced back at them and with a slow grin she lifted a foot, playfully 						tapping it.I can already feel that fiddle makin its way to my feet.Gathering her skirts, she disappeared down the small set of paved 						stairs.Brushing past him with the turn 						of a hard shoulder, John tossed out, I suggest you not make an idiot out of 						yourself.Dancing with a woman is an art.He disappeared down through the 						cellar entrance after Georgia.How hard can it be?Robinson 						yelled back grudgingly, jumping down the stairs.He ducked against the low 						frame of the door and entered into a large open space that had been cleared 						of furnishings, save a few chairs set against the uneven walls, and rows of 						casks laden with tankards.The entire timbered ceiling was 						covered with smudged lanterns, illuminating not only every nail, crack and 						splinter but all the flushed, glistening faces of men and women, both Negro 						and white, as they merrily whirled and danced in time to the loud stamping 						of feet and the violin and tambourine that tried to cut through the 						noise.He glanced toward a row of 						people leaning against the wall on both sides of him.They clapped and 						stomped their feet, some pausing to openly scan him.Georgia pushed her way past 						John, who was holding out a hand toward her.Later, John.Im dancin the 						first few sets with Robinson.With that, she grabbed hold of 						his arm and 						hurried them into the crowd, her braids swinging against her slim 						shoulders.Robinson pointed back over at 						John and yelled out smugly over the music, I see a lovely looking wall over 						there!I suggest you go spark up a conversation.Who knows, you might get 						lucky!John narrowed his gaze and swung 						away, disappearing toward a table lined with bottles of whiskey.He tossed a 						quarter at a man and snatched up two bottles.Following Georgia into the chaos 						of limbs and whirling skirts and clapping hands, she turned toward him and 						twirled once before lifting her skirts above her ankles and letting her 						booted feet merrily take flight to the music.She grinned, her braids 						hopping along with the rest of her.I cant believe Im actually doin 						this.Its been years!Has it?Well, at least you 						remember doing it.I dont even know what the hell Im supposed to do.He 						awkwardly held a hand behind his back and tried to force his booted feet to 						find the rhythm in the melody that flitted like a million butterfly wings he 						couldnt make sense of.He stumbled against the worn leather boots of a 						bearded fellow beside him and winced, holding up a hand in apology to the 						man, who reached out and patted him on the back to assure him it was fine.The music only seemed to flit faster and faster and he felt as if he was 						about to snap his own legs in an effort to keep up.Georgia grabbed hold of his 						waist and steered him closer toward herself.Dont lift your knees so 						high!she shouted, reaching down and tapping his closest knee down.Otherwise, youre missin beats and the steps that go with it!Robinson lessened the height of 						his knees, feeling like a court jester drunk out of striped trousers.He 						gargled out a laugh.I simply cannot dance!he shouted back, leaning 						toward her.Im about to fall over like an oversize bit of 					timber!She laughed.Youre doin 						fine!She leaned toward him and grabbed hold of his face, nuzzling her nose 						against his before letting go.That amazing, loving little 						nuzzle made him want to not only dance but break out into a roaring song.No 						longer caring if he looked like the fool that he felt, he stomped and 						clapped and gave way to the music.With a grin, he watched Georgia spin left 						and then right and then left again, her quick moving feet timed perfectly to 						the jovial music.Her beautiful, flushed face and 						bright green eyes watched him in between every whirl and twirl, the 						radiating happiness that bubbled out of her, infecting him with a sense of 						freedom and happiness he wanted to seize and hold for the rest of his 						life.Whatever history haunted this 						place, it appeared to be of no consequence, for he saw nothing but genuine 						happiness bursting through that smile and dance.Pride overwhelmed him 						knowing that he was here to share in that joy.When the music eventually 						stopped and he with it, a loud cheer boomed around them, momentarily 						deafening him.Georgia cupped the side of her 						mouth with a hand and jumped over and up, yelling past the bobbing heads, 						Play us a lovers melody of old!Ive brought myself a lover tonight, dont 						you know, and I want this to be a night to remember!She veered back toward 						him and grabbed his arm, squeezing it tight.I just announced to the world 						youre mine.Are you happy now?You honor me.He grinned and 						glanced down at Georgia as men and women hooted and clapped.The lanky Negro whod been 						playing the violin jumped up onto his chair, adjusting his knit cap on his 						brow, and pointed the tip of his bow at Georgia with a saucy grin and a 						flirtatious wink.Quickly tucking the end of the instrument beneath his 						chin, he held up his bow, announcing he was about to begin and, with a 						graceful guiding hand that slid the bow across and back against the strings, 						commenced a beautifully sweet slow melody full of so much longing that it 						sought to melt the heart of every soul in the room.Georgia turned toward him with a 						shy smile, reached up and primly set one hand on his shoulder.With the 						other, she carefully took his bandaged hand into hers, ensuring she wasnt 						touching the rawness beneath, and announced, This is how a lady in your 						realm would dance to music.Am I right?He paused.I honestly wouldnt 						know.But I like it.He curved his other hand around 						her corseted waist and instinctively set it against the middle of her back.Drawing in a breath, he wordlessly whisked her away from the men and women 						crowding to their right and guided them to the left with a smooth, circling 						boxed step.He adjusted their step and held her rigidly against himself, 						pushing and guiding her body and feet with his arms.He instinctively took a 						forward balanced step, then a back balanced step, then a side balanced step, 						moving them left and right, before starting the steps all over again, across 						the planked floor.It was thewaltz.Yes.He knew it.Oddly, he knew 						it very well, and though the dance itself didnt match the music being 						played, it felt like the only step worthy of it.With each smooth step and 						elegant turn, he realized that he not only knew how to dance this waltz but 						that he could do it fluidly and exceptionally well.Georgias lips parted as she 						attempted to follow his sweeping movements.She glanced down at their feet 						and then up again, meeting his gaze.What is this?The waltz, he provided, 						whisking her past the other couples who had paused from their dancing to 						watch them.Or at least I think that is what its called.I like it.Do you?Very much.It makes me feel 						allcivilized.Dont you feel civilized?He lowered his head toward her 						and drawled, Yes.Because we certainly werent earlier, up against that 						wall.Finding they had more room on 						the floor, for others were moving back and away to watch, Robinson smiled 						and moved her forward with a step, then back, then side to side from left to 						right.Images of well dressed crowds and dancing couples whisking forward 						and back on a gleaming wood floor lighted by crystal chandeliers and rows of 						mirrors flashed within his thoughts.He was there with them.He kept dancing with Georgia, 						trying to hold that image, not clear on where it came from.Her uncertain 						steps slowly matched his own until she completely submitted to the repeated 						movements of their bodies swaying together.She quietly watched him the 						whole while, her flushed features searching his face.When the violin ceased, he 						brought them to a sweeping halt and blew out a slow breath as a wave of 						applause filled the air.Georgia lingered in his arms and tightened her hold 						on his shoulder, still holding his gaze, even as the violin and the bugle 						commenced a new, rowdier tune bringing everyone stomping back onto the dance 						floor around them.She mouthed something up at him, 						her brows and face softening, and though he couldnt hear it against the 						crowd and the music, he didnt need to hear her words.He could see the 						enchantment in those eyes.It was a heartrending form of enchantment that 						promised him love.Onlysomething was unraveling.Something made him feel as if that forever and a day he sought within 						Georgias arms was about to be snatched away.Though he tried to push all 						thoughts of it away, he was beginning to wonder how it was possible to dance 						with a woman without remembering how.It whispered of dark possibilities he had refused 						to consider out of his desperate need to be near Georgia.What if he had danced like this, 						so intimately, so lovingly, with the faceless woman who lingered in the back 						of his mind?What if he had lied to Georgia when he had first met her on the 						street just so he could crawl into her bed and then toss her?Perhaps the 						man who had emerged and had claimed her so savagely against that wall was, 						in fact, him.A man who sought to onlyfuck women.He swallowed and released her, 						stepping outside of her arms.He turned and quickly veered off the planked 						floor, a headache pinching his skull.His chest tightened as he frantically 						pushed his way past people, unable to breathe.He hurried toward the entrance 						that led up and out to the street, the light and the darkness blurring into 						each other.Jumping out onto the landing of the pavement, he threw back his 						head and stood there, dragging in rancid breaths of air that only seemed to 						make everything blur all the more.Robinson?Georgia hurried up 						the stairs and out toward him.She grabbed his arm.What is it?He winced against the headache 						that continued to penetrate his skull, wishing desperately he could figure 						out who he was and what he should do.Im overwhelmed, that is all.I need 						to rest.She hesitated and whispered, 						This is my fault.Dont apologize.He glanced 						away.I didnt want it to end.Im just  Hey, Brit, John hollered out.Hey.John staggered past Georgia with an almost empty whiskey bottle.He 						gestured with the bottle.You, uh, dropped something.Robinson paused and patted his 						trousers, wondering if the dollar hed placed in his pocket was still there.It was.What did I drop?Robinson swiveled toward him 						just as John belted out, This!and sent his other full fist swinging, pummeling it 						straight into Robinsons stomach.Pain exploded up into his 						clenching chest, momentarily arresting his ability to breathe against the 						burning ripple that froze his stomach muscles.He stumbled, his boots 						skidding against the pavement in an effort to regain his stance and his 						breath.John!Georgia shoved John hard and off to the side, 						making the bottle slip out of his other hand.Glass shattered as whiskey 						sprayed everywhere, resounding like the crack of a pistol shot in the 						night.Yanking out the flower from 						behind her ear, Georgia whipped it at John and jumped forward, smacking his 						face hard.How could you?How could you ruin this night for me knowin I 						havent been here in four goddamn years?Whiskey slathered or not, what are 						you tryin to prove?John leaned toward Georgia and 						grabbed her by the face.Im ready tohead west, John choked out, 						momentarily swaying.I wasnt earlier, but I am now.Gritting his teeth, Robinson 						jumped toward John and knocked that hand away from her and shoved him with a 						full violent thrust.Dont touch her.Georgia, we should go before I lower 						myself to his level.Right you are in that.She 						grabbed Robinsons arm and stalked them past John.We ought to get you into 						bed, anyway.Come.Yes, get him into your bed!John called out mockingly after them, waving about a swiveling hand.And 						while youre at it, Georgialet the Brit feck you up the arse in the name of 						Ireland like the goddamn traitorous slut that you are.Robinson twisted away from 						Georgias grasp and stalked back toward John, his pulse roaring in his ears.You and that piss drunk mouth are dead.Digging into his coat pocket, 						John unfolded a razor with a flick of two fingers.Bleed, you son of 						a Angling 						forward, John stumbled and lunged toward Robinson with the outstretched 						blade.Shit!Robinson skid aside just as the blade cut straight through the air of where 						hed been.Knowing he had to stop that razor from lunging again, Robinson 						jumped back toward John and instinctively snatched hold of his outstretched 						wrist with both hands, rigidly freezing the blade and his arm so it wouldnt 						move.Gnashing his teeth, he used his weight and every ounce of his strength 						to twist Johns wrist hard and off to the side until the tendons and the 						bone kept it from going any farther.Despite Johns grunting 						resistance, he eventually stumbled forward and against him, the razor 						slipping from his fingers.It clattered to the pavement at their booted 						feet.Robinson shoved him back hard 						and scrambled toward the pavement, snatching up the razor before John could 						get to it.Refolding it with a flick into its handle, he turned and whipped 						the blade far out into the street, where it echoed into the shadows far 						beyond and disappeared from sight.He pushed out breath after breath, his 						pulse still roaring in disbelief that the bastard had almost sliced 						him.John stumbled back, catching 						himself against the gas lamppost beside them.Robinson swung toward him and 						narrowed his gaze.If you go near Georgia ever again, Ill do more than 						fist you up.Ill break your arm and detach it from your shoulder and toss 						it down the street so that your little razor has itself a friend.Are we 						plain in this?John pushed himself away from 						the lamppost, jerking toward him.You deserve to be sliced.Sliced!he roared 						through his slurring.Do you think I didnt see youpounding and grunting 						into her?Do you think that I didnt place myself against a wall and 						restrain myself fromkilling you and her with the cleaver I grabbed from the 						kitchen?Robinson pointed at John, his 						chest heaving in disbelief.How we choose to love each other is none of 						your goddamn business.You are pathetic and vile!With gnashed teeth, John lunged 						at him again, flopping a fist toward his head.Robinson darted aside, his heart 						pounding.Jumping back and forward, he threw out a raging fist, his bandaged 						knuckles connecting up and into that nose with full force.A sharp pop 						sounded in the night air as his arm jumped back.His hand writhed at the 						contact, causing him to push out a seething breath and stagger back.Wincing, he shook his bandaged hand out.Gash aside, had he never hit a man 						before?John covered his nose with a 						quick hand, stumbling and wheeling forward.He gasped as blood slowly seeped 						through his clamped fingers, glistening in the low glow of light from the 						lamppost.Georgia grabbed his arm.Robinson, youve made your point.Now lets go.He yanked his arm from hers.I 						just have one last point to make, dearest.Rounding John fast, Robinson 						took advantage of his hunched position by grabbing hold of his shoulders and 						shoving John straight down toward the pavement in full force.That is for watching us, 						you prick.John stumbled to the ground, 						catching himself with his bloodied hands.Collapsing against the pavement, 						he rolled onto his back and choked up at him, She deserves far more respect 						than youve been giving herand you know it.You know it.Robinsons chest knotted with 						regret.Though a vicious and dark part of him wanted to send a double fist 						crashing down into that sniveling face and into his gut, he knew John was 						right.Georgia did deserve far more than hed been giving her.She deserved 						her field, she deserved her apple trees and, above all, she deserved a man 						who knew his own goddamn name.Rounding John and the pavement, 						he gently took Georgias hand and kissed it, wordlessly leading her down the 						street, their movements echoing in the darkness.Whoever the hell he really 						was, and whatever the hell his reasons for originally engaging her on the 						street had been, he only hoped he was worthy of Georgia.ROBINSON SAT QUIETLY IN Georgias 						dimly lit kitchen, fingering the scrap of linen shed resoaked in whiskey 						and rewrapped around his hand.Though the wound no longer bled after the 						blow hed delivered to John, it still stung.Christ help him if he really 						did have a wife.Orchildren.Oh, God.What if he had children?Georgia reappeared in the 						doorway of the low closet, her slim body outlined by the glow of the oil 						lamp she had lit beside her bed.Robinson?He glanced up and drew in a 						breath, noting that she wasnt wearing a corset or a chemise beneath that thin linen 						nightdress.Through the wavering light filtering from her room, he could see 						the outline of breasts and nipples, slim thighs and sinewy limbs peering out 						through the sheer, plain cotton that swept down to the floor.He met her gaze, trying to 						pretend he hadnt noticed her near nudity, even though every muscle in his 						body roared with tension.Yes?She leaned her braided hair 						against the frame of the door.You were rather soft on John.Considerin.Im impressed.He was drunk, he muttered, 						lowering his gaze.She sighed and tapped on the 						door.Remove your clothes, save your undergarments, and get into bed.Ill 						not let you sleep in that chair another night.The bed is small, but theres 						more than enough room for the both of us.He shook his head.The chair is 						fine.Robinson  No.The chair is more than 						fine.She bit her bottom lip before 						dragging it loose to say, You need better rest than what youve been 						gettin.Ill be fine.She leaned against the doorway, 						swinging out playfully toward him, those small breasts jiggling beneath the 						fabric of her nightdress.Well keep it respectable and only sleep.I 						promise.He averted his gaze from those 						breasts he wanted to cup.The damned woman didnt even realize that 						everything about her made him want to toss the last of whatever gentlemanly 						ways he had.Robinson removed his boots and 						let them thud against the floorboards.I am not getting into that bed with 						you, Georgia.Leaning far back against the 						chair, he crossed his arms, stretching the rough, yellowing linen of his 						shirt.You and I should not touch again.Not until my mind is what it 						should be.My own.She tsked, her nose crinkling.You really need sleep.He glared at her.What if Im 						married, Georgia?What if I have a house full of children and have yet to 						know it?What becomes of this or of them?By God.I have knowingly made a whore of not only 						you but 						myself.Her grin faded.Is that whats 						been weighin on you?What sort of man goes pounding 						a woman into a wall, only to then almost break a mans skull?She shook her braided head.Padding over to his chair, she leaned over and kissed his cheek soundly with 						soft, warm lips.The stinging scent of lye and starch still clung to her 						skin after their long day of laundry.Should you change your mind and 						wish to sleep on the straw mattress beside me, she murmured, nuzzling her 						nose against his cheek, Ill not think any less of you.In my eyes, you 						will always be a gentleman worth knowin and havin.Brushing her roughened fingers 						alongside the curve of his unshaven face, which caused his body and his jaw 						to tighten, she straightened and lingered.Is there anythin else botherin 						you?Be honest.He glanced up at her.After a 						long moment, he asked, What happened to you at the dancing hole?Why is it 						John knows and I dont?She quietly stepped back, her 						features tightening.Id prefer to tell you another time.All 						right?Do you not want me 						asking?Nah.Tis all right to ask and 						Im glad you did.Im just not in the mood to cry.She lowered her gaze, 						fingering the waistline of her nightdress.Set aside whatever guilt you 						feel about tonight and know that waltz made me forget for one beautiful 						moment that Id ever danced with any man but you.Somethin I never thought 						possible after my Raymond.So thank you for that.I needed to know that I 						could move on and leave him behind.And tonight, I got my answer.She 						blinked rapidly, nodded and padded her way back into the closet.Good 						night.Good night, Georgia.He 						swallowed, tilting his head back against the hard wood of the chair, and 						squeezed his eyes shut.Something kept chanting that time was ticking toward 						his departure, calling his mind out of the void and into a different 						reality.Scarcely knowing where he was, or 						what to believe, for a few moments Verezzi stood bewildered, and unable to 						arrange the confusion  of ideas which floated in his brain Percy Bysshe Shelley, Zastrozzi: A Romance (1810) A RAPID POUNDING AGAINST the entrance door startled Robinson into bolting up 						out of the chair and onto his feet.He staggered, all of the muscles in his 						shoulders and thighs tightly knotted and sore from sleeping in an awkward 						position.He winced and then groaned, knowing he couldnt keep living like 						this.Hed be dead by the end of the week.Thunder boomed in the distance, 						making him pause as the floor, as well as the windows, rattled.The rushing 						of rain whipped at the glass when the thunder silenced, wind pelting it hard 						on an angle.It was morning already.Though not a very welcoming one given 						the menacing weather.Georgia?John yelled out from 						the other side, rattling the door.Georgia!Wheres Robinson?Get him out here, 						will you?And hurry it up!He was going to bury that 						bastard in an unmarked ditch outside of New York.Stalking toward the door, 						Robinson unbolted the locks one by one and swung the door open.What?Johns hardened blue eyes met 						his gaze.His swollen nose and bruised face were sleeked with rain, his 						unshaven square jaw dripping wet like the rest of him.Drenched, frayed 						clothing clung to his lean body, and his almost whitened leather boots 						trailed not only puddles of water but clumps of mud onto Georgias 						doorstep.Robinson stared him down.I 						suggest you and the mud leave.Because Im done with this.Im done with 						you.Im not here to put up fists, 						John muttered, shifting from boot and boot.Im sorry about therazor.I 						was being stupid and had far more whiskey than I should have.Marshals were 						going door to door in the building looking for you.No one wanted to talk, 						thinking Georgia was in trouble, but as it turns out theyre here to help 						you.So II told them which door you were at.He stepped back and thumbed 						toward the stairs behind him, where four large men in drenched uniforms were 						jogging up the stairs, their muddied boots echoing around them.Robinsons breath hitched as all 						four men in full military regalia, with swords at their sides, filed onto 						the landing.This be the one, John 						announced in a low tone, gesturing toward Robinson.One of the uniformed men 						formally inclined his head toward Robinson and gestured toward the stairwell 						behind them with a gloved hand.His Grace will be most pleased to know you 						are safe and is anxiously waiting for you to join him 					downstairs.Robinson stepped back.His 						Grace?He knew what that meant.It meant the man was aduke.It meant that the 						man was of British nobility.Swallowing, he took another step back.How did 						he know that?Who is this man to me?The mustached officer closest to 						him leaned in and offered, The Duke of Wentworth is your father, my 						lord.A displaced sensation of 						familiarity clamped down on him.Imageless memories pierced his 						thoughts, bringing a rush of not only an estate but servants.My lord?the officer inquired from somewhere before him.Are you unwell?Do you require assistance down the stairs?Robinson refocused his thoughts.No.I am quite well, thank you.I just He held up a shaky hand, feeling 						exhausted and overwhelmed.Im trying to remember things, that is 						all.Another officer held out a 						sizable leather satchel that tinkered with what appeared to be coins.This 						here is for Mrs.Milton.It bears gold coins amounting to an even hundred.His Grace asks that the moment these coins are delivered into her hands in 						honor of her generosity toward you, that you join him in the carriage 						outside.Oh, God.This couldnt be 						happening.Everything was unraveling too fast for him to make sense of it 						all.Robinson grabbed the weighty 						satchel.Georgia?
