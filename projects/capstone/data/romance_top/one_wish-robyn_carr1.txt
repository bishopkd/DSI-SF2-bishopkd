  				Grace Dillons flower shop was very quiet on the day after Christmas.She had no orders to fill, no deliveries to make, and shed be very surprised if her shop phone rang at all.Most people were trying to recover from Christmas; many families were away for the holidays or had company to entertain.Grace drove to North Bend to grab an early skate before the rink got busy.Figure skating classes were suspended over Christmas break and people, mostly kids who wanted to try out their new skates, would dominate the rink later in the day.Grace loved these secret early morning skates.She had a deal with Jake Galbraith, the rink owner.She could call him and if it was convenient, hed let her skate for an hour or two while they were getting ready to open.He didnt want to charge her, but she paid him fifty dollars an hour anyway.It was a point of pride.He smiled at her when she came in and told her to have a good skate.She stretched and then stepped onto the deserted ice, closely following the Zamboni ice resurfacer that had just finished.She warmed up with forward and backward crossovers, backward half swizzle pumps, figure eights, scratch spins and axels.She noticed Jake was watching, leaning his forearms on the boards.She performed a forward spiral and a leaning tower spiral.She executed a perfect sit spin next.She circled the ice a few times, adding a jump here and there.She had been famous for her straddle split jump, touching her toes with her fingers.When she looked for Jake again, he had disappeared.Suddenly, the music started, filling the rink with the strains of Rhapsody in Blue.She glided into an arabesque, arms stretched, fingers pointed, wrists flexible.She saw that Jake had returned, was watching her every move.She went for a double axel and fell on her ass.She got up, laughing to herself.She glided around the rink a few times, tried the jump again and landed it, but it wasnt pretty.The music changed to another Gershwin tune.Shed practiced to this music as a little girl; it was familiar and comfortable.Her earliest memories of skating always filled her with nostalgia and comfort.That was before the competition got really fierce.Shed been on the ice for an hour when the music segued into Alicia Keyss Girl on Fire and it lit her up.Her signature music.She was on fire!She skated like she was competing.When she was fifteen, stronger but lighter and more flexible, she could really catch the air.She noticed other people watchinga guy leaned on his broom and gazed at her, a couple of teenage girls who worked in the skate rental shop had stopped working to watch, the Zamboni driver leaned a shoulder against the rink glass, hands in his pockets.Two hours slid by effortlessly.She slowed and got off the ice when she heard the sounds of people arriving to skate.Beautiful, Jake said.Its been a while since Ive seen you.Holidays are busy at the shop, she said.She tried to get to the rink on Sunday mornings, but the past month had been franticwreaths, centerpieces, two weddings and increased day to day traffic in the shop.You should spend more time on the ice.I have a long list of people looking for a good coach.She shook her head.I dont think Id be a good coach.I dont have time for one thing.And Id never go back on the circuit, even with students.I left that world.I thought the day would come that you might be interested in going back, maybe not in competition for yourself, but coaching.I think on name alone youd make a fortune.I left the name behind, too, she reminded him with a smile.We have an agreement.I havent said a word.People ask me, who is that girl, but I just say youre training and asked not to be identified.Some of them guess and would show up to watch you if they had any idea when you would be skating.The ice misses you.Watching you skate is like seeing music.Nice try.I dont train anymore.I spent as much time on my ass as on my blades.I look like crap.Your worst is better than a lot of bests I see.Ive missed you.Maybe youll have more time in the new year.Well see.She took off her skates and pulled on her Ugg boots.Sometimes she questioned her decision to leave it all behind, because being on the ice made her so happy.Then shed remind herself that while a couple of hours felt great, the difficult routine of a competitive figure skater was grueling, exhausting.As a coach shed never be able to push young girls the way shed been pushed.She pulled out a hundred dollars in cash for her two hours alone on the rink.Jake had told her he put the money in a special scholarship fund for young wannabe Olympians who couldnt otherwise afford lessons.She told him however he wanted to spend it was fine with her.As long as he didnt sell her out.As she left the rink she reflected that her life in Thunder Point was so much more peaceful than it had been in competition and her freedom was hard won.She had friends now, even if they didnt know who she had been before.At least no one thought of her as tragic or complicated or as one of the saddest yet most triumphant stories told on the competitive skating circuit.No one was threatened by her, hated her, feared or resented her.No one called her a rich bitch or a dirty liar.Of course, the weight of her secrets sometimes wore on her.Jake Galbraith had recognized her at once.All she had to do was ask the cost of a private rink for a couple of hours and he knew immediately who she was.She hadnt confided in anyone in Thunder Point.When she got into the van she saw that she had a message on her cell phone.She listened to it before leaving the parking lot.It was Mikhail, her old coach.He still kept tabs on her.They stayed in touch.Often, they left each other a series of brief messages because he could be anywhere in the world.I am wishing you happy Christmas, the Russian said.I think I am day late.If so, you will understand.Grace waited until she was back in her tiny apartment above the flower shop before returning the call.I thought you had forgotten all about me, she said to his voice mail.It was a happy Christmas.I was a maid of honor for my friend Iris yesterdaythats how I spent the day.Ive never been in a wedding before.It was small and intimate, a beautiful experience.And this morning I went skating.I fell three times.Then she mimicked his accent.What can I say?I am clumsy oaf with no training.Then she laughed, wished him the best New Year ever and said goodbye.Graces beloved father and coach died rather suddenly when she was only fourteen and he was sixty.Her mother, once a competitive and professional figure skater, responded by hiring an even better coach, a very short Russian of huge reputation who could take Grace all the way.There was no time for grieving, they had work to do.Mikhail Petrov was a tough, brilliant coach and they were together for nine years.He had been very unhappy with her decision to leave competition and for a couple of years he pestered her to return to the sport.Before you forget everything I taught you!Her mother, Winnie Dillon Banks, who had herself been a teenage skating wonder, was worse than devastated.She was furious.If you quit now, after all Ive invested in you, you are dead to me.After the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, Grace walked away from everything and everyone.All shed ever wished for was to be like everyone else.To not be constantly judged every time she took a breath.She wanted to be normal.* * *  				In the afternoon, when Grace was just about to ruin her dinner with a big bowl of popcorn while looking through various online floral arrangements on her laptop, there was a light tapping at her back door.She pulled the curtain to peek out through the window in the door and was shocked to see Iris.She opened the door.Dont newlyweds lay around in bed for several days after the wedding?Doing it until their parts give out?Grace asked, only half teasing.Maybe when one of the newlyweds isnt the town deputy, Iris said.We did eat breakfast in bed and Seth didnt go to the office until about one.I cleaned the house, thawed something for dinner and...She paused.I called Troy to tell him.You didnt tell him before, huh?Grace asked.Iris shook her head.Troy Headly, high school history teacher and the fantasy of all the high school girls, had had a very big crush on Iris.They had dated for only a few months last spring when Iris told him theirs would have to be a friendship only relationship.She was the high school guidance counselor and before getting involved with a teacher in the same school, she had to be powerfully sure.And she hadnt been.But Troy had pursued Iris right up until Seth was in the picture.Even then, it was pretty obvious he still had a serious thing for Iris and wouldnt mind if Seth fell off the face of the earth.Howd he take it?Grace asked.Like a man, Iris said.Is it too early for wine?Certainly not!Grace pulled a bottle of Napa Cellars sauvignon blanc from her little refrigerator and opened it.Was it awful?Nah, it was fine.Good, really.He was surprised we got married so soon, but then so was everyone.So were we, when you get down to it.He congratulated me and said he hoped Id be very happyall the right things.Then I asked him if he was going to be all right and he laughed, but he didnt sound amused.He said he was surprised to find himself disappointed an old girlfriend got married.Its hard for me to think of myself as his girlfriendit was never that serious.Even Troy admits hes not looking for a wife!Not now.He likes the single life.Grace poured the wine and put the bowl of popcorn between them.A gourmet treat, she said.Or maybe dinner.So, is it different?Being married?Not yet, Iris said.Ask me again when we merge bank accounts.Weve been solitary, single adults for a long time.Right now were each taking care of our own obligations until Seth either rents or sells his town house.Theres plenty of closet space at my house, but we could have issues when his manly furniture looks for space among my decidedly female things.Youre staying in your house, Grace said in relief.Its perfect for us.I like to ride my bike to work in good weather.I love your house, Grace said.Arent you ever going to have a honeymoon?Eventually.Were looking for deals online right now.Were going to sneak away in a couple of months, hopefully somewhere warm and sunny, when Seth can get away from the town and I can escape my office at school.But what about you, Grace?Why arent you seeing anyone?Grace burst out laughing.It wasnt the first time Iris had asked.First of all, who?Second, when?Dont you ever meet a groomsman at any of the weddings you do?Never.They all come long after Im gone and Im not invited to the receptions.Besides, isnt that the kiss of death?Hooking up with someone in the wedding party at the reception?No thanks.We have to get you out more, Iris said.Right, Grace said doubtfully.Maybe I could help you chaperone the prom and meet some very promising eighteen year old?Nah, I dont think so.Well go clubbing or something.Clubbing?Grace sputtered.In Thunder Point?Okay, well go up to North Bend.And graze.Im sure Seth would appreciate that!Well, I wont take any phone numbers or bring anyone home...Iris, Grace said, lifting her wineglass.Let it go.Ill handle my own love life.In my own time, in my own way.Theres always Troy, Iris said, sipping.Nah, were pals.Theres no chemistry.On his side.We had a beer together once, followed by grilled cheese and tomato soup.It was swell.Besides, Im not interested in your sloppy seconds.I read, you know.Rebound boyfriends are not a good idea.You cant just work all the time, Iris said.No?Grace asked.I thought you could.* * *  				Growing up, everyone thought Grace was a spoiled rich kid, but she had been raised on hard, committed, constant work.If she took a day off she felt ashamed.Her program would suffer.But her work hadnt been the kind average people understood.Her full name was Isabella Grace Dillon Banks.Shed given up most of her name and went by Grace Dillon because Izzy Banks was very well known in some circles.Probably not among her Thunder Point acquaintances, but for those who watched champion figure skating competitions around the world, Izzy Banks was known, both for her skating and for her involvement in dramas and scandals that rocked the skating world.Graces mother, Winnie Dillon Banks, was a wealthy heiress whose grandfather made money in tobacco.She was a well known skater in her time, though never as successful as Grace in competitions.Winnies best show as a competitive skater had been second place in Nationals.But she saw in her daughter her chance to win and became the ultimate stage mother.Grace had a privileged, isolated childhood where skating was everything.Grace was born to an ice skating icon and her coach.Winnie Dillon began a love affair with her coach, Leon Banks, when she was twenty two.Some cynical rivals and professional observers suggested she succumbed to marriage and motherhood when all signals pointed to her competing days being over.Winnie and Leon had their daughter on skates before she was four years old.They pushed and trained her hard.In those early days, when skating was simply fun, when she yearned to be the best, Grace was happy.She begged to skate and hated her time off.Shed have been on the ice eight hours a day if her father had let her.She was coddled and loved and indulged.She had a few friends, other little girls who were training and taking lessons and part of a skating club, some of them Leons other students.Grace loved her parents very much and didnt quite understand until after her fathers death that theirs had been a difficult marriage.Her father was much older than Winnie and more focused on his students than his wife.Her mother was a demanding diva and socialite; she dragged a reluctant Leon to charity events and parties.Her parents disagreed on almost everything, especially Graces training and education.Grace never went to traditional school, public or privateshe had tutors.Leon thought this might be a mistake, feared she wouldnt be a well adjusted child.At the age of twelve the level of competition turned serious.But Grace was winning everything in her age category and was quickly viewed as unbeatable.She trained on the ice several hours a day, took gymnastics, ballet and practiced yoga.The family moved from Atlanta to Chicago and finally settled in San Francisco, following the best opportunities for her training and education, as well as for Leons coaching prospects.Her father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer when Grace was fourteen.Winnie sought a tougher, stronger, more famous coach the moment Leon fell ill.It was almost as if shed chosen Mikhail before he was needed.Then Leon passed away rather swiftly, within months of his diagnosis.Winnie and Grace took a few days off, then it was back on the ice.Your success meant everything to your father, Winnie kept saying.It was true that Leon wanted the best for his daughter, but it was Winnie to whom winning was everything.No matter the personal cost.And skating became less for fun and more for life.Winnie blew a gasket whenever Grace didnt take first place.Grace left the world of competitive skating when she was twenty three, right after the Vancouver Games.She went to Portland to stay with a sweet older couple who had once worked for her mother.Ross and Mamie Jenkins had known Grace since birth.Theyd been part of Winnies staff, Ross a driver and Mamie in housekeeping.They had retired to open a flower shop a few years before Grace quit the circuit.When she needed them, they took her in.She collapsed.She was exhausted and depressed and afraid of the future.Mamie pampered her and gave her time; it seemed as if shed slept for a month.Then one evening Mamie spoke up.If you lay around one more day, you wont be able to walk.You have to do somethingits your choice.Get a job, go to school, something.Grace didnt want to be around people and she didnt believe she had any marketable skills.So she started helping in the flower shop, in the back, learning to make beautiful bouquets and arrangements.Portland was a funky, interesting, welcoming citynot too big, not too small, not uppity or flashy.Little by little, Grace came out of the back room to deal with customers, sometimes delivering flowers, even helping Mamie and Ross with weddings.No one made a fuss over her or asked her a lot of questions.Every time a major skating competition was covered by the mainstream or sports networks, Grace was glued to the TV, watching every move.And invariably thered be some short vignette about Izzy Banks, the girl who had it all and threw it all away.Izzy Banks, the brat on the ice, the fiercest competitor in figure skating, obviously couldnt take the pressure, one sportscaster noted of her.Brat.Boy, that stung.Her mother would usually get in touch, proving that Winnie couldnt ignore the competitions any more than Grace could.Shed pressure Grace to return home, return to skating, and the few conversations they had would end in a fight and they wouldnt speak again for months.A year before the 2014 Winter Games in Russia, when the dramatic story of her life might be publicly examined yet again, Grace went in search of a new place to settle and tackle life on her own.A little money had been set aside for her by her father and she found Pretty Petals, the shop Iriss mother had owned.Shed been in Thunder Point almost a year when the winter competition took place.When Grace couldnt watch it, shed record it.There had been the usual newsy dish about the more stunning events of the life of Izzy Banks, but no one seemed to recognize Grace.There were, thankfully, more interesting sports scandals that year.And Thunder Point was more a football than figure skating town.All shed ever wanted was a life she could control.A life that didnt include backbreaking labor, cruel rivals, endless travel across too many time zones, the occasional crazed fan or terrible loneliness.She wanted to know what it felt like to have real friends, not a staff of coaches, therapists, a security detail and competitors.Shed never had a boyfriend.She did, however, have more than one gold medal.Shed won every significant competition in the world.* * *  				It drizzled in the days following Christmas, typical Oregon Coast weather in winter.Graces only part time employee, a local married woman with a child in elementary school, came into the shop to resign.The womans life had grown too busy and complex, she complained.Grace knew it was going to create a challenge, even though all the woman had done was manage the front of the store.Grace was going to be back to doing it all, just as she had when the shop was new.Shed had the doorbell installed so she could lock the front door and go upstairs.The doorbell would buzz in her loft.And she could always close the shop to make deliveries when necessary.Shed ask around for a delivery boy.Business was typically down the week following a holiday and the days were much shorter so Grace closed the shop at four one afternoon and drove out to Coopers for a beer.She wasnt surprised to see Troy was back from visiting his family in Morro Bay.She was also not surprised that there was no one around the bar.People didnt hang out on the beach in cold, wet weather like this.But she had to admit surprise at seeing a big pile of books and papers beside his laptop on the bar next to his cup of coffee.She jumped on a bar stool.Welcome home.Did you have fun with the family?she asked.More or less.My sister has three little undisciplined kids and I slept on her couch.It was brutal.What can I get you?Beer?Was that a question or order?he asked.Beer, please.She glanced at the books.Homework?Lesson plans, he said, closing everything up, stacking it all and pushing it to one side.Were caught up in a couple of my classes so were going to have some fun.Im going to offer them a chance for extra credit if they research the history of something that interests themlike a rock band or in line skating or maybe a sport like kayaking.Im writing up a few examples.That almost sounds fun, but not enough fun.Did you get in any skiing over the holiday?Nope, he said, drawing her a draft.We played some golf, but the weather wasnt great.I might make a drive up to Mount Hood before I get back to work, maybe for a day.If I had more time and money Id check out Tahoe.So, you were the maid of honor.I was.Kind of short notice.I heard it wasnt exactly planned in advance...Thats how I heard it, too.Iris said they decided and just did it.They got a marriage license, called a judge Seth knew, told Seths family and got it done.I didnt even have time to order special flowers.She sipped a little of her beer.How are you handling it?Fine, he said.Good.Thats good.He leaned both hands on the bar.I went out with my little brother and got roaring drunk.Then I bought a Jeep I cant really afford.Oh, she said.Gosh, I hope you dont get your heart broken too often or youll go broke.Id wanted that Jeep anyway.And I deserved a good drunk.Is that what caused...She reached out toward the remnants of what looked like a healing bruise on his forehead.He ducked away from her fingers.I forgot I was sleeping on the couch, fell off and hit the coffee table.She couldnt help herself.She laughed.And my heart isnt broken, he insisted.Just a little coronary bruise.Gimme a week or two and itll be like nothing ever happened.Bullshit, she thought.He looked completely miserable.Youre very resilient, she said.She sipped her beer.I guess weve all been there, he said.Where?Heartbreak hotel.Hmm.Well, I dont think I have.I havent had my heart broken.Not by a guy, at least.Troy appeared to be momentarily frozen.Theres no polite way to ask this, but has your heart been broken by a girl?She giggled.There were times, and this was one of them, that it would feel so good to dump the story on someone, explain how a heart can be broken by ruthless competitors or the media.No, Troy.Im perfectly straight.Im into guys, I just havent been seriously involved.I guess its not in my nature to be tied down to one guy.No boyfriend, then?Are you fishing?she asked.Ive had some terrific boyfriends, just nothing serious.No steadies, engagements or live ins.Why havent I ever met any of them?he asked.She shrugged.I guess you werent around at the same time one of them was.I have a date later tonight, as a matter of fact.Oh?Whats he like?Troy asked.Hes kind of like a medieval knight, but has a gentle, sophisticated side.Big and brawny, very physical but disciplined.Hes also clever.Wise.Fantastic, Troy said.Where are you going?Were staying in, actually.We might watch a movie.Troy lifted an eyebrow.If I popped over unannounced, would I meet him?Very probably.Hes a little possessive but I completely ignore that.Like I said, Im not one to get serious.Lets talk about your girlfriends.I dont kiss and tell.She straightened.Humph.Yet you expect me to!I think you were bragging and maybe stretching the truth.Youre a little weird, Grace.The last time we hung out was Halloween and you were a witch, complete with missing teeth.And you put a hex on me.She smiled, remembering.Shed told him she was going to shrink his thing.Howd that work out?Turns out youre not much of a witch.So when you say your heart was never broken...Come on, Ive had my share of disappointments like everyone else, just havent had a romance end badly.We can moan about our various letdowns another time, when were both drowning our sorrows and feeling sorry for ourselves.Lets not do that now, okay?I have a feeling if you get started...Did Iris ask you to check on me?Absolutely not.She said you were very grown up and wished her every happiness.And I must say, buying a Jeep you cant afford is definitely mature.Then she grinned at him.Its a great Jeep.Maybe Ill take you off road in it sometime.Besides, I only have one person to worry about so if I have trouble paying the bills, its not like Im taking milk out of the babys mouth.She leaned her head on her hand.Youre all about fun, arent you, Troy?I work two jobs, Grace.I like to think of myself as active.And your favorite activity is?Its a toss up between diving and white water rafting or kayaking.One of the things that brought me to Oregon is the great river trips.I was torn between Colorado, Idaho and Oregon.Oregon had the job.In a town on the water.And youre a teacher for the time off?And the high pay, he said, smiling.Iris says youre the most dedicated teacher she knows, Grace said.Iris should raise her standards.Okay, so youre still a little pissy.I said Id need a week or two, he reminded her.He lifted his coffee cup to his lips.Whats your favorite thing to do with time off?She didnt answer right away.I need more balance in my life, she finally said.That shop gets too much of my time.But its a good workout.Flower arranging?he asked doubtfully.I beg your pardon!I stand all day, haul heavy buckets full of fresh cut flowers in water, deliver hundreds of pounds of arrangements to weddings and other events, get in and out of the back of that van all day, lift heavy pots and props and thats before I have to clean up and do the books.Its not for sissies.And for fun?I like to dance, she said.I dont very often, but its fun.I bet you were a cheerleader, he said.I was never a cheerleader.I think I couldve been.But I wasnt interested.You are the first girl in the history of the world, then.Im sure Im not, she said.When I was that age I was into ballet, sort of.They are not the same moves at all.That, like flower arranging, takes strength.Plus, I have a bike.He raised his eyebrows.A Harley?A mountain bike.Retired for the winter due to ice, rain, cold and slick roads.She drank the rest of her beer and put her money on the bar.Id love to stay and keep you company but I have a date.She started for the door and turned back to him.Im glad youre doing well, Troy.Id like to see what that Jeep can do off road.Maybe when the weather warms up.And dries up.Its a date, he said.But Grace knew it wasnt a date.She went back to the shop but didnt go inside.She went upstairs to her apartment, put some leftover lasagna from Carries deli into the microwave, changed into her soft pajamas and turned on the TV.While her lasagna cooled on the plate she went through the channel guide and settled on some reruns until her favorite shows came on.With her dinner on a tray and her e reader in her hand, she opened an old and beloved bookThe Wolf and the Doveand settled in with Wulfgar, her medieval knight.She loved him.And she trusted him.Two  				When Cooper asked Troy about his plans for New Years Eve, Troy agreed to work.He hadnt gone skiing and was getting a little boredmight as well make money.Even though the night was clear and cold, it was a party night and Coopers wasnt where the party was.Cliff was packing a full house at his restaurant and would stay open past midnight to accommodate his revelers, but Coopers on the beach didnt have patrons past eight oclock.At a little after eight Troy locked up and walked next door to Coopers house and brought him the contents of the till.Cooper and his wife, Sarah, were bundled up and had been sitting on the deck where an outdoor hearth blazed under a star studded black sky.I hear Cliff is going to shoot off some fireworks over the bay if the wind stays down, Cooper said.If were awake, well have the best seats in town.The problem with having a house like thisyou never want to leave it.You look pretty comfortable.The fireworks might wake you up, Troy said.We had invitations for New Years Eve, he said.Im sure, Troy said, grinning.Getting old, Cooper?Oh, yeah, I guess so.But look at youworking tonight and all washed up before nine...Troy was ready to move on.Im going to stop at the store, grab a six pack and drop in on a friend.Let me save you a trip, Cooper said.He got up, went to the refrigerator and pulled out a six of Heineken bottles.Will this cut it?I wasnt going to spend that much, Troy said with a laugh.What do I owe you?Gimme a break, Cooper said, waving him off.Just get outta here and happy New Year.I hope the friend is female.Shes female, but just a friend.I hope shes home or Ill end up at my apartment alone with a six pack like a loser, Troy replied.I guess calling ahead didnt cross your mind?I didnt think about it, Troy said.Like I said, nothing special.Just a friend.But Troy had thought about it.He was completely prepared to find Grace not at home and he didnt really care.Or she could be entertaining, which hed kind of like to interrupt.Since Grace never brought out these boyfriends, he figured the only way he was likely to get a glimpse of one was to surprise her.What hed really like to know was if Grace was as lonely as he was.Because two lonely people could negotiate a deal that would get them through.Why not?Hed been thinking about her for the past couple of days, ever since she stopped by Coopers while he was working.Grace had been in Thunder Point a little longer than he had, but he was just discovering her.Hed run across her a few times with Iris; she made him laugh.She was cute.Pretty, actually, but not the kind of gorgeous or sexy that slapped him upside the head.If he was honest with himself, women like that made him nervous.Grace had a wholesome look about her, kind of freshly scrubbed and glowing.She was very small, like a woman in a girls body.But when she started talking, all traces of the girl vanishedshe was clever and had a sassy, cynical wit.There was a sharp edge to her, like shed lived a lot.She was full of the devil.He privately acknowledged he was looking for a woman to spend some time with.The truth was, he hadnt often been without one.This might be one of his longest stretches; hed been too damn focused on a woman he couldnt have.He wasnt above brief liaisons but he preferred something a little steadier.For that, he had pretty rigid standards.First of all, appearance was important.Not the only criteria, but someone who made an effort, put her best foot forward, kept up her looks.Next, she had to like to play.Troy loved extreme sports and it was not required that a woman he was dating be into the extreme, but it was important she liked trying new things, liked being outside, enjoyed physical activity.Iris had fit those requirements.She appreciated the outdoors, liked hiking, biking, paddle boarding.And shed liked watching his videos of his own more adventurous experiences.Shed covered her eyes sometimes, but shed watched his white water challenges, rock climbing, diving with sharks, whales, squid.Troy wanted a woman who was a good sport, at least.Of course she had to be intelligent and have a sense of humor.And since he was on the rebound, it was probably a good idea if she wasnt the clingy, needy type.That made Grace, who didnt get serious, a contender.She seemed to be casually dating someone and that sort of thing was usually a turnoff, but not at the moment.He knocked on her second floor apartment door, not really expecting her to answer.He saw the curtain move and then the door opened.She was wearing yoga pants, heavy socks, an oversize, long sleeved T shirt and her hair was pulled back into a ponytail.He tilted his head and smiled at her.You dont have a date tonight?Well, not at the moment.Troy tried looking past her.Is the medieval knight here?She put a hand on her hip.Did you want to come in, Troy?He lifted the six pack.If youre not too busy.I brought beer.Sorry, I shouldve called.She held the door open for him.Im surprised you dont have a date.Its not like Im desperate, he said, entering.He held out a beer for her, took one for himself, then opened her little refrigerator to stow the rest.Oh oh, he said.It was stuffed.Small to begin with, there was no room for a six pack.Here, Ill do it.Some maneuvering was involved in getting four bottles of beer into the little fridge and ditching the cardboard pack.Youre sure Im not interrupting anything?Come in, Troy, she said, moving through the dinky kitchen to the couch.There was a movie on Pause and a plate of something snacky on the coffee table.He peered at it.Pizza rolls.I was just watching a chick flick but itll keep.Now whats up with you?And take off your shoes.He did as he was told, then sat on the far end of the couch.Really, nothing.I worked at Coopers, which is why I dont have a date or anything.It was dead tonight, and it was still early.I had about three choicesCliffs, Waylans or your place.You could have taken that new Jeep up to North Bend or even Bandon.Found a lively bar.Party a little.She picked up the plate and offered him a pizza roll.Thanks.He chewed it and nodded.Not bad.I didnt feel like dealing with a bunch of strangers, he said.I just felt like some company before I go home.He grinned at her.And I thought maybe Id run into one of your boyfriends.Oh, so thats your ulterior motive and the reason you didnt call.I didnt want to go out tonight.I went for a run.A run?You dont get enough exercise?Short hours in the shop today.The nice thing about being a one person operation, I can close early or open late if I want as long as I have a cell number for the shop.That way I can take orders anytime.In fact, if Im available and someone needs something, I can run downstairs and make up an arrangement.But I knew there wouldnt be any calls tonight and, God, it was beautiful on the beach.There were a few people out thereSarah Cooper and her dog, a couple of teenagers, one older couple Ive never metmaybe part timers.And me.I like to work out, but there isnt a gym around here that matches my oddball hours.You work out?he asked.Not regularly.Just a bike ride or jog.I dont lift anymoremy arms and legs get enough of a workout in the shop.My flower girl calisthenics are enough.I add cardio just so I can drink a beer and eat pizza rolls.She offered him the last one.After putting the empty plate back on the coffee table, she curled into her corner of the sofa, her knees under her chin.Tell me about Christmas, tell me about your family.Are you close?I guess.As long as we dont have too much togetherness.What does that mean?He took a pull on his beer.I love my family.I do.We dont all get together that often and when were gearing up for a family thing, I get excited.Then on the third or fourth day I want to kill my sister and shove my brother in a hole.She sat forward a little.Really?My sister can be a bossy bitch and my brother is a screwup.Jess was married at nineteen and they started trying to repopulate the worldmy niece was born when Jess was twenty.Then came a nephew and another niece and she thinks she runs a tight ship but if you ask me, the ship is sinking.The kids are out of control, my brother in law, Rick, works as much overtime as he canhes a firefighterthe house is upside down and I think Rick likes the firehouse because its the only place theres enough quiet to watch a game.And my brother, Sam, can be such an idiot.Hes twenty one going on seven and my mother would cut his meat for him if she could.Hes spoiled and irresponsible.He doesnt even walk his plate to the sink and he has to eat on the hour.He looks in the refrigerator and sees eight slices of leftover pizza, so does he ask if anyone wants some?Of course nothe eats them all.Her eyes were large.Should I be sorry I asked?Troy took a breath.Nah, Im just coming off another successful family gathering.I shouldve stayed in the motel with my folksit gets a little tight at my sisters  				Your parents stayed in a motel?Why?Because theyre smart!But take em one day at a time and theyre great, theyre really great.Jesss kids might be loud and messy and hyperactive, but theyre also happy!Ricks such a great guy, I dont know how Jess captured him.And when I got moody and wouldnt tell anyone what was bothering me, Sam took me out on the town.Not that its much of a town.We mustve hit three whole bars.Of course Sam wasnt really trying to cheer me up as much as he was hoping to get laid, but then...His voice trailed off.Then...?she asked.When I was twenty one, that was always foremost on my mind.No apologies.She giggled.And now?Not always foremost.So you love your family, when you dont hate them?Im crazy about them all the timewe just get on each others nerves.Were typical, I think.Ill say thishalf the time I want to punch my brother and slap my sister, but if anyone ever laid a hand on either one of them, Id take em out.Really, I dont know how my folks lived through us.What about your family?he asked.She didnt answer right away.Instead, she got up, took the plate and her bottle to the little kitchen area, retrieved two fresh beers and returned to her corner of the couch.Theres very little to tell.My father died when I was fourteen and Im an only child.My grandparents are gone, one set before I was even born and the other set before I was eighteen.There are some very distant relatives, but if I met some of them even once, I dont remember.I did get a letter from someone who claimed to be a cousin or half cousin or something, but he only wanted a loan.She laughed.He apparently didnt know anything about me.How did you respond?She smiled.I wrote back that it was very kind of him to reach out, but I wasnt making loans at this time.No one, huh?he asked.Your mother?Also gone, she lied, looking away.She just wasnt willing to get into all that.Plus, shed told Iris that she was alone.There are friends, but probably not as many as you have.The couple who owned the flower shop in Portland where I worked, were close and stay in touch.I talk to them every week and visit now and then.They not only trained me in the shop but took me under their wing.Good people.Theyre in their sixties and never had children, which probably explains why they think of me as family, though were not.And there are a couple of other friends who also stay in touchMikhail, to name one, but he travels all the time so I never see him.That might be one of the reasons I became good friends with Iriswe have that absence of family in common.And theres the fact that I bought her flower shop, of course.Sometimes I look at people like Iris...and...well, youand I feel a little abnormal, like I should try harder...Iris?And me?Youre both so connected to people.Iris doesnt have family, but she has more good friends than anyone I know.The whole town loves her.The school definitely leans on her.And your family isnt around here, but I bet you talk to them every week.Pretty much, he admitted.Youre really involved with people, too.The school, Coopers, even Waylans.All over town, people yell hello!But the reality is, I was raised an only child, had a very solitary upbringing and Im probably a little too comfortable being alone.People around here are pretty friendly to you, arent they?They are.Thats what I love about this town.But Im kind of a loner.But youve had a lot of boyfriends, he reminded her.This is true.And theyve all been amazing.I spend time with a guy who actually owns a plantation in South Carolina, a guy with a British title of some kindviscount I think.Theres Malonehe owns a lobster boat on the East Coast, theres a bar owner, a guy in the ski patrol, a navy SEAL...very interesting, sexy guys.But I own a flower shopmy time is precious.He tilted his head and peered at her.I think youre bullshitting me, Grace.She got off the couch and went to the wall unit, opening a cupboard under the TV and there, lined up neatly, was a tidy row of bookspaperbacks and a few hardcovers.Below the books was a similar collection of DVDs.She left the doors standing open and went back to the couch.She gracefully extended a hand toward the bookcase.My keeper shelves.From medieval knights to navy SEALs.And theres Wrath...Im afraid hes a vampire, but a very nice and sexy vampire.Theyre all mine.Should we have a little talk about your medication, Gracie?She smiled.I know theyre pretend boyfriends, Troy.But they never cheat and I havent had to get one single screening for an STD.Then she giggled.I dont have space for a lot of storage and books so I do most of my reading on an e reader, but I have a special collection there.I cant be without them.What would I do if my e reader wasnt charged or I lost it?Troy felt a tug of some kind inside, somewhere in his chest.He knew it was a warning signit was too soon to feel affectionate toward her.In fact, hed prefer to never feel anything but friendly.But he couldnt deny it felt good to know that Grace wasnt involved with anyone.Her claim to never having been very involved was unusual for a woman her age and beauty.And he liked it.How are you fixed for real dates?he asked.I have a very demanding schedule.When you own your own business every day off is a day without pay.I dont have much help at the shop.Ive had a couple of part timers over the past couple of years, but right now I have no onethe last one had to quit.She wasnt that much help anyway, but at least she kept the shop open while I delivered flowers.I have to try to figure that out.Like I said, I need a more balanced life.Have you thought about a high school or college student?Or maybe two who could job share, putting together two part time schedules that equal one full time employee?There are so many at the high school who dont want to go to college or who do but have trouble affording tuition.Good idea, but when I advertise for help, hardly anyone answers.You need help advertising in the right place.Theres a work study program at school.If you can train your student employee in a trade, theyll get a credit toward graduation and get a morning or afternoon off to work.Didnt Iris ever suggest this?Grace looked a little excited.No!Should I ask her to help me with this?Yes, he said.Not tonight.Tonight we drink beer and eat something.Whatve you got?I could run out for something...How hungry are you?Because I make some amazing nachos.And since I have some black olives, taco meat left over from taco salad and sour cream...Oh, yeah, he said.Didnt you have any dinner?I had a couple of Coopers mini pizzas...And you say its the little brother who eats on the hour?She went to her tiny kitchen.Are you sure you dont want me to run down the street for something?I hate to ask you to feed me, he said.Dont go, she said.Its not much trouble and it sounds good.She bent over to dig around in her little refrigerator and Troy felt a fever coming on.Those yoga pants had a real nice fit.He had to look away, take a breath.Sometimes, he reminded himself, you dont notice whats right in front of you.Hed spent all that time thinking Iris was right for him.Even though she made it clear it was a no go, he never bothered to get to know any other women and here was Grace, right under his nose.Making him hot.She was complicated, he knew that.She said her life was boring, not much to tell, solitary...and he knew that was just a cover.And he didnt mind at all.Then let me help, he said, joining her.They put together a fabulous plate of nachos, ran out of salsa very quickly since that little fridge couldnt hold much and cupboard space was at a premium.They spent the next hour talking about the town, the rivers Troy liked to run in the summer, the kids he taught.Every time he asked Grace a question about herself she gave him a brief answer and steered the conversation back to him.You know there are dorm rooms bigger than this loft, he said to her.You live like a college student.I know.Im keeping my life simple and my expenses down until the shop does better, and its doing better all the time.There arent that many weddings in Thunder Point, but I get a lot of weddings out of town.Theyre killers but they pay like mad.Where do you live?In a small old apartment on the edge of town thats decorated with castoffs from my folks.Youre saving for the flower shop and Im saving for travel.He noticed her eyes widened and wondered where it came from.Envy?Longing?Surprise?Something else?He told her about the dive trips in summer, ski trips in winter, hunting trips with old Marine Corps buddies here and there.Marines?she asked.I did a year of community college, enlisted, went to Iraq and got out.Thats how I finished collegeGI Bill.I was a lowly jarhead but I made some excellent friends.Theres good hunting in the mountains not far from here.Ill take you sometime if you like.Oh, Ive never touched a gun, she said.I couldnt hunt.Then Ill take you for the scenery.Just then, as they were talking about guns, something that sounded like gunshots punctuated the night.Almost as if choreographed, they both turned to open the shutters behind the couch.In the sky above the bay, fireworks blasted the dark sky, exploding into bright fireballs and falling in sparkling streamers.Fireworks, she said in a breath.The wind has been too high in the couple of years Ive been here, Troy said.I think Cliff hires someone to do it.Not bad, for a dumpy little town.This place surprises me all the time.Troy turned to her and caught her chin in his finger and thumb.He leaned his forehead against hers.Me, too.Listen, Troy, she said, and there was no mistaking nervousness in her voice.I. ..There are things...He stopped her by kissing her gently.He slid his hand around her head to the nape of her neck under her ponytail.His kiss was soft, brief and gentle.Instinct told him he was dealing with a major unknown emotional situation and should go slowly, carefully.He moved over her lips very tenderly.What things?he asked.She took a breath.I didnt exactly tell the whole story about my family, about growing up...I know, he said.How?Do you know things about me?Is there something...Shh, he said.Im a high school teacher.I can smell excuses and evasion a mile away.Its an acquired skill.So theres more to you?Thats okay, Gracie.Dont panic.Youll tell me when you feel safe.Okay?she said, more of a question than a reply.He chuckled.Okay.Were just friends.And were getting to know each other.Take it easy.Then he leaned in again, taking another taste of her lips as the popping, exploding sound of fireworks provided the background music.Again he was gentle and sweet because the last thing he wanted was to scare her off.Im not experienced, she whispered when their lips parted.Well, except for the navy SEAL, knight and vampire?he asked with a laugh in his voice.She smiled against his lips.Yes, except for them there arent many experiences.I made out with a guy named Johnny when I was fifteen.For about ten hours I think.He was fantastic and turned out to be gay.Such has been my luck.He gave her a little kiss.Im not.Yeah, I was afraid of that.Dont be afraid, he said.Its all good.Should we be down on the dock, watching the fireworks?she asked.Uh uh, he said, shaking his head.We should be right here.Then his arms tightened around her and he covered her mouth again with kisses that had become hot, demanding and promising.* * *  				Troy left at around one in the morning but Grace stayed on the couch.She grabbed a pillow and blanket and decided to spend the night right there, where it all happened, where the kissing and snuggling and whispering took place.She was still licking her lips, touching them with her fingertips, contemplating his skill, his taste.The last time shed been kissed was in Portland by a nephew of Ross and Mamies.That was over two years ago.His name was Gary, last name long forgotten.Hed attached himself to her mouth like a plunger and attempted a tonsillectomy with his tongue.Hed gotten away with that three times before she finally told him to stop.There were some things for which she had very little training and one of them was romantic relationships.She hadnt been in a position to have boyfriends.And if she did have a crush, which happened rarely, her flirting felt conspicuous and clumsy.Shed had a crush on Troy, as it happened, but because she was Iriss friend and Troy had been trailing Iris for a year, she never let on.Growing up, she trained mostly alone, the only exception being her fathers younger studentsalmost exclusively girls.There were men on the skating competition circuit and other athletes competing in some of the national and world competitions.Some of the figure skaters she competed against were so much more womanlytall, with breasts, worldly, sexy, flirtatious.And they hated her.They had plenty of reasonsshe was raised with money while many of them had parents who worked several jobs to pay for their training, not that that had anything much to do with ones ability to perform a perfect double axel.She often competed against older skaters because her talent meant she was a force to be reckoned with.But the other girls tended to act as if she could buy the medals.Her biggest rival was a girl her age named Fiona Temple.Fiona beat her once and only once, but that was all it took for Fiona to believe the only thing that stood in the way of her stardom was Izzy Banks.Fiona hated her and spread rumors about her whenever she could.Fionas parents leaked stories to the media.Grace would never forget the time, age twelve, when Fiona told other skaters Grace was a rich bitch and how everything was easier for her.Grace had cried and told Winnie all about it.Never let them see you cry!Winnie had said.Never!Lift your chin and beat her instead!Beat the tights off her!Thats what she wanted to do, but it was so hard not to feel hurt.So she lifted her nose in the air, ignored them, and they started calling her a stuck up snot who had everything handed to her.And then she did something that caused a world of trouble.Winnie had warned her to keep her mouth shut, but she couldnt stay silent.She accused a famous skating coach of sexual misconduct with one of his students, a minor.She quickly learned speaking out gets you treated like a leper, even if its true.True or not, a smarter person would have proof to offer before opening her stupid mouth.When she asked her coachs advice Mikhail had been blunt.He is piece of shit but it will get you nothing to say so.That world famous coach was not prosecuted and ultimately sued Izzy and Winnie.They settled, giving him money.A year after Grace retired from competitive skating the coach was arrested and eventually convicted of sexual misconduct with minors.Shed been right.Vindicated.For what good it did her.She hadnt been completely without friends growing up, but her few relationships had been superficial and strained.When the girls doubled up in hotel rooms to save money, Winnie rented spacious quarters for the two of them and Mikhail, removing Grace yet again from her contemporaries.The only skaters she didnt actually fear were on the mens team.And most of them truly wanted to be nothing more than friends.She couldnt look to her parents as models for a healthy, strong love match.Her mother had married her father because she needed a keeper.Her father had married her mother as he had married a young skater before her, one who bore him a child twenty years before Grace came along.As much as she had always adored her father, she understoodhe had a type.Young, vulnerable, needy, willing to do whatever he demanded because they were convinced hed help them win.She could, however, look to her parents to see what she didnt want in a relationship.Her other advisors on romance were in the bookcasethe romances and some classic chick flicks.She and Iris had debated them often enough.Some were pure fantasy, some unreasonably coincidental, but some of her favorite contemporary romances revolved around very strong women and men with integrity.And then of course she studied their fictional presumptions, mistakes, missteps, blunders, and from them she learned.Or at least hoped she had.She had been unprepared for Troy.She had wished for someone like Troy for a long time but assumed that kind of man would never happen into her life.Troy had kissed with such amazing skill and tenderness.And there was passionhot, deep, panting, groaning passion.Grace wanted to fall in love with him, something she attributed to her lack of experience.But she thought about what hed said to her.You arent with anyone, Im not with anyone and it seems like we might as well enjoy the moment.Right?So.He was just lonely and had finally accepted that Iris had moved on.She didnt care.She loved his mouth, his arms, his hands.She would try very hard not to fall in love with him.Grace snuggled down into her blanket on the couch and thought it didnt matter at all.
