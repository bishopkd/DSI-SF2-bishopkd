Eli picked up the ring box and turned it so that the diamond was facing him.I know shes worth it.Shes worth anything.Everything.Then its the right thing.Connor reached out and patted his brother on the shoulder in a clumsy gesture of encouragement.He was out of practice at this older brother stuff.But he was trying.Can I ask you something really personal?Connor shifted in his chair, lifting his coffee cup to his lips and taking a large gulp to give himself a little time to answer the question.Youre going to ask whether or not I give you the okay, right?Probably.Then go right ahead.Would you get married again?I mean, if you could go back, knowing what you know now, how bad it hurts in the end when things go wrong.Would you do it again?He thought back.To the years hed had with his wife, to full flower beds and nice smells in his kitchen.Someone in his bed at night, someone to share his life with.It was all kind of vague, impressions of a happy time.Feelings more than specific instances.And he didnt see her face.But the thoughts were...happy.Which was weird.Yes.I would.Eli looked down.That answer means a lot to me.He looked back up and met Connors gaze.You really dont want to have that again?I dont know if I can, he said, because this wasnt the time to BS and cover up his dysfunction with a stupid joke.As much as he would like to.When you talk about going back...thats a different man.Im not the same as I was.The memories are...It was good.But I dont know if its something I can do anymore.Still planning on dying alone and celibate?Connor just about choked on his coffee.Alone, anyway, he said, clearing his throat.Eli raised both brows in surprise.Is that a confession?Youre not my priest.Hell, youre not even my sheriff yet.I dont have to confess anything to you.Fair enough.Im going to ask her after the election party.Oh, thank God.Lets make this all about you again.I really dont like talking about me.Shut up, Connor.Is it a good time to propose?A bad time?There is no bad time.Because that woman is head over heels in love with you.One thing I can tell you, Eli, with certainty, is that you love each other deep.When Im around you, it almost makes me want to try it again.There, that was my allotted amount of sincerity and advice.You didnt answer my question, though, Eli said, rubbing his hand over his forehead.Ask her after the election party.Her answer will be yes either way.Eli closed his hand around the ring box and slid it back toward him, putting it back in his jacket pocket.Okay, I will.He stood, latte in hand.Eli, Connor said.What?Congratulations.He watched Eli walk back out of the coffee shop, and he stayed in his chair for a few minutes.He was happy for Eli.Genuinely so, which came as a little bit of a shock.Almost as shocking as the fact that he just had memories of the past that felt happy.He picked up his coffee and took another sip before standing, waving at Cassie, the owner of the shop, and walking out the door.There was a touch of bitterness to his happiness, though.Much like his coffee.Because what hed said to Eli was true.He was too changed to simply go back to what hed had.And then there was what he had now.With Liss.Which was...Yeah, it was the best sex hed ever had.He hadnt known sex could be this good.She just seemed to want everything he gave her, not just wanted, begged for it.That was a damn powerful aphrodisiac.Then, during the day, she was still his best friend.A pretty damn good arrangement.That might explain a good amount of the happiness he had felt today.Lately.He pushed open the door to the coffee shop and walked out onto the street, making his way down the sidewalk past the collection of little shops that were popping up with alarming regularity lately.Tourism in Copper Ridge was booming.Thanks in large part to the renovated old town, events organized by the county, and city council and bed and breakfasts like Sadies.He turned to face the street, ready to jaywalk back to his truck, and paused.There was a secondhand clothing store just next to the knickknack tourist trap he was parked in front of.Rethread.If he was the type of guy who got any enjoyment out of puns, he mightve laughed.He crossed the street, drawing closer to the store windows, and stopped completely as a flash of pink caught his eye.Right there in the window, on a pale mannequin that was contorted into a very strange shape, was a pale pink, skinny strapped prom dress.The conversation hed had with Liss on his porch a couple of weeks ago played back in his mind.Shed said that in hindsight she thought the dress was ugly, but hed seen the lie in her eyes even then.Because she was still hurt over it.She still loved it.And this might look nothing like the dress she had described to him, but it was how hed pictured it.And he had no clue if it would fit her.But he had to buy it.CONNOR POUNDED THE LAST nail into the barn a full four days before the election and the election night party.And he felt satisfied.Of course, given that the whole crew was in place, and most of the details had been finished by a specialty team, him putting in the last nail was more symbolic than it was necessary.But he was in a place where he was happy to take that.He hadnt finished a whole lot of things in the past few years, but he had finished this.Fate had blazed through and burned yet one more thing in his life to the ground, but he had rebuilt.And it was better than the barn that had come before it.There was a stone arch curving over the doorway and built partly up the first floor, adding detail to the red cedar planking that had been used to build the rest of the structure.The red metal roof shone bright in the sun, and the weather vane on topshaped like a cowwas swaying back and forth lazily in the halfhearted afternoon breeze.There was enough room for all of his equipment and a finished office on the top floor to help foster the idea that the running of the ranch was communal.Having it all centered in Connors house kept the others too much on the peripheral.Which he had been happy about when hed been letting everything slide.But he was ready for a little help, a little accountability.He pushed open the door and walked inside.The space was empty, a blank canvas.It smelled like fresh wood and stain, the sweet smell of grass and hay blowing in the wide open side doors and mixing in, almost christening it for use.Only a few months ago, all that had been here was ash.He could hardly believe it now.Could hardly believe that so much destruction could be erased.That something as perfect as the old barn could be created again, stronger, better.He heard footsteps behind him and he turned, half expecting to see Eli.But it wasnt Eli.It was Liss.This is...Connor, this is beautiful, she said, her eyes sparkling with unshed tears.He cleared his throat, his chest suddenly tight.Yeah.They did a good job.And it will be done in time for Elis big election party.Well be able to celebrate his new position in style.I dropped my ballot in the box yesterday, Liss said, smiling now.Hes got this.He better.Otherwise Im going to think this place is pretty dumb.I mean, if Eli can take care of me, he can more than manage Logan County.Though it might justify me going deeper into my hermitage.No.No more hermitage, she said, closing the distance between them, standing close to him but not touching him.He was tempted to close the small gap between them, to wrap his arms around her and pull her close against his body.But he had a feeling that violated the First Amendment of Connor and Lisss relationship Constitution.The separation of friendship and sex.Meaning there were normal friendship boundaries unless they were actually in the act.Right now that separation seemed a little bit stupid.Then Eli had better win.Otherwise Im building a cabin up in the mountains.Ordering all of my supplies out of a catalog.That sounds kind of lonely, she said.Ill get a sheep or something.Seems like the thing to do in a situation like that.Anyway, sure, there will be people, but there will also not be pants.Youre planning on leaving civilization for a sheep and the chance to run around without pants?You know, Connor, if you really want to stop wearing pants at home, Ill let you, she said, the corners of her mouth turning up into a wicked smile.This was sex talk, which made him wonder if they were in sex territory.Which meant that maybe, just maybe, he could put his arm around her.So he did.You might be okay with that, but I imagine Kate would pitch a fit if she stopped by unannounced and saw that.It might keep her from stopping by unannounced, she said.That is a very good point.She was smiling up at him, and she was just so pretty that he couldnt stand another moment of being this close to her without kissing her.So he did that, too.She made a small noise in the back of her throat and he felt it burn all the way through him like a shot of whiskey hitting his blood.He cupped her face, deepening the kiss.It just felt so good.So good to be this close to someone.So good to be this close to her.So when is Sadie going to attack my barn with decorations and things?he asked, his forehead still pressed against hers.We will probably start tonight so that its finished in time.She roped you into helping?Yes, she did.Me, Kate, Alison, Lydia and Jeanette.Oh, yeah, and Jack.How did she get Jack involved?Did you not hear how many women are going to be there?She did not have to twist his arm.Connor huffed out a laugh.Well, when he gets in your way, just send him up my way and Ill give him a beer and sit him in front of the TV.Will do.He pulled away from her, suddenly conscious of the fact that really anyone could walk in on them.Hey, she said.This is beautiful.Really.And Im so happy for you.And Im proud of you.I could not have done it without your boot up my ass.And I mean that sincerely.She smiled.What are friends for?A lot more things than I thought, he said, surprised at how easy it was to tease her.Surprised at how good it felt.She pursed her lips, pulling a face.Watch it, Garrett.Or what?Or I might kiss you again.I wouldnt mind that.He heard voices and footsteps coming from outside and was thankful that they werent kissing again.Was thankful they were standing with a respectable distance between them now.Eli and Sadie walked into the barn a moment later, talking loudly about how amazing everything looked.Really, they did an incredible job, Eli said, looking around.Connor looked at Liss, who took a surreptitious step away from him, stuffing her hands into her pockets.Yeah, they did, Connor said.Im so excited!Sadie said.I cant wait to get my hands on this.Im going to have Kate making flower arrangements, she finished, smiling broadly.You have a death wish, dont you?Connor asked.Sadie waved a hand.It will be good for her.She was practically raised by wolves.Excuse me, Eli said.She was raised by us.He gestured between Connor and himself.Sadie made a sympathetic face at Eli.Oh, she said, patting his face, honey, I know.He narrowed his eyes but didnt say anything.Do you have time to start decorating tonight, Liss?Sadie asked.I am at your disposal, Liss said.And Connor felt a tug of something that reminded him a lot of jealousy.Because he had sort of wanted Liss at his disposal tonight.Great.I was thinking we could come out after dinner.Its going to be fun!I can come and help, Eli said.No, you arent allowed to.Because its for you, for your election night, and it will make a really bad gift if you help.Plus, I dont want you to help because youre a control freak.And theres only room for one driver on this train.And thats me.I am not a control freak, Eli said.He paused for a moment.Wait, yes, I am.Good point.Ill go to Connors house and drink beer instead.Perfect, Sadie said.And well stay in here and eat pie and drink hot cider.What if I want hot cider?Eli asked, frowning.We might be able to make arrangements.Sadie wiggled her brows.Itll be like prohibition.If you come to the back door of our barn speakeasy, you might be able to finagle some hot beverages.Or, Connor said, I will come to the front door and get a cup if I ask.Because it is my damn barn.Poor Connor.Ill bring you cider.Liss patted him on the shoulder, and he jumped.It was totally appropriate contact, completely normal contact passing between the two of them, but it felt more intimate now, and something she probably shouldnt do in front of the others.He pulled away.He could sense that he had done the wrong thing.But there wasnt much he could do about it here and now.All right, Connor will give you a few more minutes to admire your barn before we string lights and vomit cheer all over it.I know how resistant you are to cheer, Sadie said, smiling unrepentantly.See you later tonight, Liss.I better go, too, Liss said, forcing a smile.See you later, Connor.And she left with Eli and Sadie, which left him alone.Knowing full well he had done something wrong, and not really sure what he could do to fix it.Well, he still had the dress.And he suddenly had a very good idea for how to give it to her.* * * JACK HAD ONLY STAYED long enough to string the lights over the crossbeams on the barns high ceiling, and in the tall branches of the trees outside.After that he had feigned a dramatic muscle injury and limped off, saying only a beer would cure it.Sadie had her phone docked into some little speakers and was playing country music.Alison had brought pie, and Sadie had provided a slow cooker filled with apple cider, both of which were sitting on a rough hewn wooden table placed in the back of the room.Leave it to Sadie to throw an entire party that centered around preparing for a party.Lights had also been strung outside, and tables set up with a few inside, as well.But there was enough space for dancing, and a temporary stage for both music and announcements.And every single one of those tables that had been set up needed, per Sadie, three small flower arrangements, placed in Mason jars, and one larger one in a tall glass milk bottle.Liss was sitting in a folding chair in front of a card table, arranging fatally dried flowers and burlap ribbons in jars.Kate was sitting on the floor, her expression a near comical scowl as she attempted to follow Sadies example arrangement to the letter.Its really a shame she didnt need anyone to shoe a horse, catch a wandering calf or repair barbed wire to prepare for this party, Kate muttered.That, I could have done.I would have fared better if she just needed her taxes prepared, Liss said.Kate looked up at her.I think youre doing better than I am.I should have left after the lights were done.Jack had the right idea.No, Jack is a lazy bum.Or he just knows his limitations.And his limitations are flower arrangements.True, Liss said.Less complaining, more arranging, Sadie chirped from across the room.You know, Sadie, Kate said, I always wanted a sister.But it turns out its overrated.Im not your sister.Yet, Sadie said, smiling.She will be, Kate said, her tone hushed.Not even Eli is stupid enough to let her get away.For some reason that comment hit her close to the bone.Maybe because of the way Connor had pulled away from her in front of Sadie and Eli earlier.Because the fact remained Connor would be stupid enough to let her get away.Which was fine, wasnt it?Because this was all just physical.And when that burned away, their friendship would remain.So he would only let her get away in part.He would keep most of her.Its just that their interactions would always include clothes when this was over.She swallowed hard.Do you think youll get married in the barn?Jeanette asked Sadie from where she was sitting.Sadies cheeks turned a delicate shade of pink.We are not engaged.So that would be getting ahead of myself.But of course you are ahead of yourself, Lydia said.Of course I am, Sadie said.I may or may not have a few secret files with inspiration pictures in them.I knew it, Lydia said.And Im glad.Im glad he has you.Because hes most definitely the happiest Ive ever seen him.True, Alison said, cutting a few more slices of pie.Hes happier with you than I am without my husband.The room got quiet.Its okay to laugh at that, she added.Jeanette did.Lets hear it for good decisions, she said, raising her mug.To choosing good husbands and getting rid of bad ones.For some reason Liss looked down at Kate, who was looking back at her.I would just like to get a first date, she said, quietly enough that only Liss could hear.Sometimes dating is overrated, Liss said.Now she just felt weird and unsettled.To answer your question, though, Sadie said.Yes, I would like a really country wedding.On the ranch, of course.I mean, why get married anywhere else when you have access to all of this?She sighed.Six months ago I could not have imagined being in a position where I might want to get married.Its amazing how love changes things.The unsettled feeling grew, widened, into a sensation of gnawing envy.Kate gave Liss another rueful smile.Were going to have to arrange flowers for their wedding, she said, shaking her head sadly.It suddenly occurred to Liss, as she sat there with dried flowers in her hands, just how much she wanted to arrange flowers for her own wedding someday.But not just a generic wedding, to a generic groom.A wedding in this barn.A wedding to the man who owned it.She was going to cry.She was going to cry right here and now, in front of everybody.No, no, you arent.She bit the inside of her cheek and kept fiddling with the flowers.There was nothing she could do about what she wanted, nothing she could do about the situation she and Connor found themselves in.The one where she wanted a whole lot more than he ever would.Her mind kept going back to when hed pulled away from her earlier today.That action had spoken a lot louder than any words ever could.She was an idiot.How had she not realized it would end up like this?Well, she knew why.Because she hadnt wanted to acknowledge just how much he meant to her.Just how much she wanted from him.Frankly, she still didnt.Are you okay?Kate asked.She looked concerned and also horrified that she had stepped into a forest of delicate emotions.I will be, she said, not sure if she was telling the truth or not.The idea of arranging flowers for their wedding is really that sad?Liss laughed.Yes, if its anything like this.I might fake my own death and change my name.But then you would miss the wedding, Liss said.I would make a dramatic return for the happy day.Liss smiled.The entire Garrett family meant a lot to her.The entire Garrett family was like her family.And on the heels of the realization of just how much she wanted from Connor, she also realized she couldnt risk it.Because if something happened between her and Connor, something bad, she wouldnt just lose his friendship, she would lose the whole family.I might make you take me with you, she said.Id be happy to, Kate said.Good.Then its a plan.And I dont think its an extreme reaction to flower arrangements at all.Liss looked around the room at everyone here, people she was linked to, people the Garrett clan was strongly linked to.Yes, she wanted more, but the risk would outweigh the reward.Because there was no way Connor could give what she desired.So yes, maybe she loved him.But this, the relationships in this room, they were love, too.If she couldnt have everything, then she would just have this.LISS HAD SKIPPED sex with Connor the night of the barn decorating, claiming exhaustion as an excuse.Shed been feeling too raw after her realizations to risk getting naked with him.But she knew her resolve wouldnt last.She didnt really want it to last, anyway.Because she had to make the most of whatever this was, for as long as she had it.But she was exhausted after a day of taking abuse from a couple of very difficult clients at work.She hadnt gotten off until after six, trying to resolve various issues, and what she needed was some time to herself, and possibly a bath to build up some resolve before she actually came face to face with Connor.She dumped her purse on her bed and went digging for her pajamas.So she wouldnt be looking all that sexy when she did come into contact with Connor.But he didnt seem to mind what she was wearing.He was more interested in what she wasnt wearing.That made her smile a little bit.She found her flannel pajama bottoms in the bottom drawer of the dresser and straightened, turning around and facing the bed.Then she paused when she saw a white garment bag hanging over the back of her door.There was a note taped to it.She crossed the room and grabbed hold of the note.It was attached to the garment bag with a rolled up piece of duct tape.She laughed and unfolded it.It was short, and to the point, written in Connors very square handwriting.Hopefully the dress in the bag fits.If it does, and you dont think Im an idiot, meet me in the barn.He hadnt signed it, but he hadnt needed to.Unbearably curious now, she pulled the zipper tab on the bag, drawing it down slowly and revealing a wedge of pale pink.Her breath caught, and she undid the zipper faster, parting the two sides of the bag to reveal the dress inside.She slid her hands down the back of the skirt, pulling it more fully out of the bag.It could have been the exact same dress she had purchased for the prom she had never attended.Satin, with vertical seams that ran from the bodice down the skirt.Spaghetti straps with clear beads sewn into them.It was definitely dated.Not in the least bit fashionable.She still thought it was beautiful.You shady bastard.How did you manage?She took it off the hanger and stripped her clothes off quickly.For a moment she was afraid to put it on.Just in case that was the end of the fantasy.And she couldnt get it zipped over her hips or something.She took a deep breath and grabbed hold of the tiny little impractical zipper, pulling it down and stepping into the center of the pool of satin, pulling it up her body, working her arms through the straps.She turned and looked at herself in the mirror that hung on the opposite wall.She took a breath and zipped it up.It fit.Which meant she had a date in the barn.* * * LISS OPENED THE DOOR to the barn slowly, her breath catching as she saw the inside, the lights that were strung overhead casting a golden glow on everything.The tables were set with the flower arrangements theyd labored over, each chair placed around the table decorated with a burlap ribbon.Everything in the barn looked and smelled new, sawdust and pine lingering in the air.But the thing that made her heart stop was the sight of Connor, wearing a pair of black dress pants and a white shirt, tucked into the waistband of those pants.The shirt wasnt buttoned all the way, the collar left open, and he certainly wasnt wearing a tie.But for Connor, this was the ultimate in formal wear.She stopped right in the doorway, laughing, and she wasnt really sure why.What did you do?she asked.He stuffed his hands into his pockets.I saw the dress in the window of a secondhand place, and I knew you had to have it.He cleared his throat.But then I thought it was kind of stupid to have a prom dress and no prom.He shrugged.So I thought since the barn was already decorated...Lisss throat was so tight she didnt think she could speak.She could barely breathe.So she didnt say anything.She just walked toward the man who meant more to her than any other person on earth.I didnt hang up any balloons or anything, he said.But I did spike the punch.She laughed, a kind of shaky, thin laugh.You made punch?No, actually I just brought wine coolers.Because Im trying to cut back.Well, its the thought that counts.Except this went well beyond the thought.It was the most romantic thing anyone had ever done for her, and she knew he wasnt thinking of it as romance.The thought was like a knife cutting into her heart, as easily as shed sliced through those peaches the other day.Since its prom, I figure we should dance, he said, sounding grim.We dont have to dance, she said.But she wanted to.I know we dont.He moved away from her and crossed the room, going to where Sadie had left the speakers theyd been using last night.Fortunately, Sadie left her thing in here.Because nothing I own could hook up to this.He pressed Play, and a slow, instrumental song filled the room.Then he turned and held out his hand.Since youre my prom date, Felicity Foster, Id like to have this dance.Okay, she said, because it was all she could say.She curled her fingers around his, and he pulled her close, wrapping his arm around her waist.I dont know how to dance, he said, moving slightly, out of time with the music.I dont care.Because the rhythm didnt matter, the steps didnt matter, only her partner mattered.She slipped her hand out of his and wrapped both of her arms around his neck, and he put both of his hands on her hips.She rested her head against his chest, listening to the steady beat of his heart beneath her cheek.Yes, she had wanted to go to prom back in high school.But he had been the date shed dreamed of.Not the one shed had.And Connor had gone with someone else.She squeezed her eyes shut and tried not to think about what it wouldve been like if he had asked her back then.And she realized there was no point in regretting it.Because she had been young then, and so had he.And as much as she had liked him back then, as much as her teenage hormones had panted after him, it was nothing compared to the way she felt about him now.He was a man now.So different from the boy he had been.Shaped by the ensuing years and by the losses and triumphs that had marked each one.Connor the boy had the top spot in her fantasies, but Connor the man held her heart.And it didnt matter where they were fifteen years ago.All that mattered was where they were now.She angled her head upward and kissed him.Deeper, longer, and with a lot more skill than she could have managed back on her real prom night, too.He tightened his hold on her, returning the kiss, his hands moving from her hips down to cup her butt.He pulled her tightly against his body, against the hard ridge of his arousal.The song is over, she said, her lips still pressed against his.Yes, it is.Does that mean prom is over?Prom, maybe.But not prom night.Oh, good.You know...You know what happens on prom night, she said, sliding her hand beneath the collar of his shirt.I dont know.I just dropped my date off before midnight, so if youre expecting something else...She pressed a kiss to his neck.I am expecting to get lucky.Im wearing a pink satin gown.How can I fail?Oh, honey, he said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, youre you.You couldnt fail no matter what you were wearing.How did you find a dress in my size?she asked.I have to know.It was actually too big.But I bought it then had a look in your laundry, and the woman at the store trimmed it down according to the size I gave her.She blinked hard, trying not to cry.That was...That was...She took a deep breath to try to ease the pressure in her chest.I dont...You gave this back to me and I. ..I cant give anything back to you.I can never make us even.Maybe theres nothing old for you to give me, but youve given me new things.And for a guy whose been spending all his time in the past, thats a hell of a thing.Connor, I dont...This is just too thoughtful.I cant repay it.Theres no scoresheet with us, Liss.Not now, not ever.Im not used to that, she said, sniffing.Liss, he said, bending down and brushing a kiss to her lips, I hate that you gave that away for your mom.I hate that she made you feel like you owed her something just for being alive.Youre not a burden.She closed her eyes.Connor...dont make me cry.I need you to know that.I need you to understand why I wanted to do this for you.I need you to understand that it wasnt a lot of trouble, that it isnt amazing that I thought of you.Who wouldnt think of you?A lot of people, she said, her words thick.Stupid people.He kissed her again, and she just stopped thinking.She stopped doing anything but relishing the moment.There was no point worrying about the future or the past when the present was so damn good.She put her hands on the buttons of his shirt and started to undo them, pushing the fabric open and sliding her palms over his bare skin, relishing the feel of his heat and skin, of his muscles and the slight roughness of his chest hair.She pushed the shirt off his shoulders and onto the floor and just looked at him for a moment.You are...Connor, you have no idea.His lips curved into a lopsided smile.Show me.She reached behind her back and undid her zipper, letting the dress fall to the floor.She took a deep breath and met his gaze.She didnt feel insecure or uncertain at all, another perk of being in her thirties instead of being a teenager.She wasnt shy about showing him her body, and he wasnt shy about showing her how much he appreciated it.Im pretty sure you didnt have any underwear that looked like that when we were in high school.She looked down at the strapless, pink lace bra she was wearing, and at the matching thong.Then she looked back up at Connor.No reason to.Since no one was seeing them.And right now Im the only one who gets to see them, he said.Possessive.He growled and closed the space between them, wrapping his arm around her waist and tugging her hard against his body.Damn right Im possessive.Why is that?She needed affirmation, and she needed it now.Because Im the only man whos going to touch you, Liss.Why do you care?Because youre mine, he said, his tone firm, uncompromising.Why?Maybe it was a stupid question, maybe there was no good answer to it.But she wanted to hear something that wasnt because youre helpful, because you make things convenient, because you do my accounting.She needed something deeper, was starving for it.Hungry for something she knew he wouldnt give her, but she would take whatever she could get.Whatever was closest.Because I cant stop, he said, tracing her lower lip with his thumb then following the same trail with his tongue.I cant stop thinking about you, I cant stop wanting you, I cant stop having you.He shook his head.Dammit, Liss, nothing has ever been like this.His words rolled over her like warm oil, smooth and soothing and heating her blood at the same time.Liss shivered beneath his touch, her heart beating faster.It wasnt love, but it was enough.Right now it was enough.He kissed her again, hungrier this time, deeper.Connor...I need...I need...I know, baby.He turned around to one of the tables that was inside the barn.We can never tell Sadie.His tone was grave as he took the flower arrangements off the table, and the tablecloth off the surface and spread it on the floor.Obviously, Im not as prepared as you were with your picnic.But problem solved.You could have had me on the floor, Connor.But then I wouldve spent the rest of the evening picking splinters out of your ass, and as nice as that sounds, thats not how I want to spend the rest of the evening.Yeah, not my idea of a good time, either.He slid his hand down to her butt, palmed her cheek, squeezed it hard.Yeah, I can think of much better things we could be doing.He took her hand and led her to the makeshift blanket, drawing her down onto the floor with him.He made quick work of her clothes and his, retrieving his wallet before he discarded his pants, producing a condom just in time.You did think of some things, she said.The important things.Thankfully.He bent his head to her breast, sucking her nipple deep into his mouth.Yeah, thankfully.Because I have got to have you.Have me.I want you.Connor, I want you so much, she said.She forgot about hiding any part of herself, forgot about concealing her feelings, from herself or from him.Because there was no room for that now.He saw her already, anyway.So clearly that he had known, even when shed told him that the prom dress shed never gotten to wear was ugly, that what she really meant was the loss still hurt.Hed known, and he had taken steps to fix it.And she had nothing else to give him but her honesty.So she would.If she couldnt give it with her lips, she would give it with her body.She shifted beneath him, arching her hips so that the blunt head of his cock met with her slick flesh, sliding over her clit, sending a shock of pleasure through her.Nothing feels like this, she said, like the way it feels to have you inside of me.Damn straight, baby.When Im inside you its like theres nothing else.He ran his hand down her thigh, slid her leg up over his hip and pushed inside her slowly, stretching her, filling her.She squeezed her eyes shut, tears pressing against her lids, and she fought to hold them at bay.Dont hold back, she said, the words choked.He shuddered, and it was as if her words snapped the thread that had been holding his control in check.He bucked hard against her, the motion bringing him into contact with her clit again.He slid his hands beneath her butt, raising her hips, bringing her up against him every time he thrust down deep.Liss, he said, his voice a growl.Liss, he said again, broken this time, desperate.He lowered his head, burying his face in her neck, and she felt him start to shake.It was his surrender, his loss of control, that destroyed what was left of hers.He thrust into her one last time, coming on a growl just as her own release tore through her, leaving her breathless, spent and dizzy.They were both breathing hard, and Connor lifted his head, kissing her, deep, slowly.Liss, he said, just her name.Nothing else.But nothing else could have made her feel more special.Nothing more than a pink prom dress and the most perfect moment with the man she loved.The man she had always loved.And the man she always would love.No matter what.* * * A TABLECLOTH DIDNT do much to shield a person from the hardness of a barn floor.But at the moment Connor couldnt say he cared.He didnt care about anything beyond the warm weight of Lisss naked body over his.Doing this for her...It had felt essential.The need to do something for her, to show her he cared, a drive he hadnt quite understood.Except maybe it was part of trying to move forward.Because he was trying to do that.And he wanted her to do it, too.If they could take on some of her old hurts, maybe he would have better luck tackling some of his own.He wrapped his arms around her, holding on to her tight.Something about what had just happened had changed things between them, or at least it had changed something in him.Something in this moment of laying the past to rest made him want to do the same.I. ..The word died in his throat, blocking any more from coming out.He had never talked about this.Had never told another soul.But maybe this place, this new place that had been built over the ashes of a tragedy, was magic in some way.Maybe it was the best place, the best moment, to say them.He tried to breathe through the knot in his chest, sweat beading on his forehead, panic galloping through his chest like a herd of wild horses.He felt dizzy, his mouth dry, his stomach heaving.The silence was costing him.And he couldnt hold it anymore.Her due date was September fifteenth, he said.They werent exactly the words he had meant to say.But they were all he could manage.Whose?Lisss voice sounded...horrified.Terrified.But then, he had never expected anything else.It was just one of the reasons he had never talked about this.But she had shared with him.And he needed to say this, needed to share it, because the secret, the pain, was like a living beast inside him, eating away at any ounce of happiness that tried to take hold of his soul.And maybe telling her wouldnt help.But maybe it would.Jessie.Liss didnt say anything; she just wrapped her arms around him, tightened her hold on him.She didnt speak, so he continued.We were having a hard time.The whole last year our marriage was really rough.She didnt like the amount of time I spent on the ranch.And I did a bunch of inconsiderate, boneheaded shit.I didnt think anything of finishing up work and going down to Aces with the guys.I didnt remember to water her flowers.Hell, that year I forgot her birthday.Not that I forgot the date of her birthday, I just didnt realize what day it was and...She was pretty fed up with me.And I cant say I blame her.Me?I was just pissed because I felt like I was the same.And she was angry that I hadnt changed.But...then she found out she was pregnant.And I was pretty damn grateful, let me tell you.Because I thought that was my lifeline.My second chance.He released his hold on Liss, but she kept hers on him.He put a hand on his forehead, squeezing his temples tight.I dont know, maybe she never would have left me, with or without the baby.But the baby...We had a baby coming.And I. ..I told her I was going to change.And I did.I was going to be a father, and I suddenly saw myself in a completely different way.Saw the man my father had been, the man whose wife had left him with his kids.And I. ..I knew I didnt want that.So I promised her that I would change.I promised I would be better.It was my wake up call.I was going to fix things.He took a deep breath.I had barely started to try to get things back together.I never had the chance.I never even got to tell everyone about the baby.We never got to tell anyone.She was eleven and a half weeks pregnant.Just three more fucking days and we were going to tell everyone.But whats the point of doing a birth announcement when youre planning a funeral?He felt Lisss shoulders shake, and he realized she was crying.He cleared his throat and continued.Whats the point of announcing something thats never going to happen?I didnt want...I didnt want to add to anyone elses pain.Because you all felt her loss like I did.I didnt want you being sad about the baby, too.He felt a drop of moisture on his chest.See?I made you cry.I told you, sweetheart, you shouldnt waste your tears on me.She took a deep, shaking breath.Dont you know, Connor?Its not a waste.Theres no one more worthy of my tears than you.Pointless tears.They dont fix anything, he said, his own eyes burning.But sometimes you have to cry, anyway, she said, burying her face deeper into his chest.I never did, he said, his throat so tight now he could barely breathe.I just kind of screamed at the universe.At God.Whoever was responsible.I dont even remember that whole day after.I was a husband.I was going to be a father.And then, all of a sudden I was nothing.Just a dumb ass guy with nothing to look forward to, and no one to come home to.The last word broke, something shifting in his chest.I had all of these plans.And then it was all just blank.Wiped away in one second.The ache in his throat was almost unbearable now, the tightness in his chest so intense he couldnt breathe.Something had to give.Something had to break.Or he was going to.He tried to breathe but it caught, his shoulders shaking.I lost my wife.I lost my baby.And for the first time a tear rolled down his cheek as he said words hed barely ever let himself think.I cant have them back.And I dont want to move on, because then I might forget.But I have to.Another tear rolled down his cheek, and he turned his face into Lisss neck and wrapped his arms around her again.Not right now, she said, her voice thick.Right now all you have to do is lie here with me.Another sob shook his body, but he held more tightly to her.To Liss.And as the world around him fell away, and the dark pit threatened to swallow him whole, it was Liss who kept him anchored.Liss who kept them safe while he grieved.There was no alcohol to numb the pain.It was pure, undiluted agony.It was everything he had been avoiding for the past three years.He might have spent time in hell, but right now he was walking straight through the darkest part.But he wasnt alone.LISS DIDNT KNOW how long they lay together on the floor of the barn.Until Connor stopped crying.Until she stopped crying.She felt as if her chest had been opened up, her heart scrubbed raw, before she was stitched back together.At some point, Connor sat up then stood, extending his hand and helping her up, before erasing the evidence of their activities.Liss dressed slowly, and Connor did the same.Then he turned to her.Why dont we go to the house?Okay, she said.They walked back in silence, and Liss felt a growing sense of dread as they moved nearer to the porch.Because she felt as if this was leading up to something big.After this, there were pretty much only two things that could happen.Either he would push her away, because he felt too exposed, or he would pull her closer.Her experience of Connor was that he tended to push people away.Everyone.His revelation was a prime example of that.He hadnt shared.He had locked all of that pain inside himself, left screaming in his soul, a demon only he was fighting.Until tonight.And it was you he shared it with.She could only hope that he wasnt regretting it.She kinda felt like a jerk making any of this about her.It was about him.But everything was all tangled up.Another problem with being a lover, and not just a friend.If she were just a friend, she would feel the stability of their relationship now.It wouldnt matter what he did after this.What he said.If he needed to be alone, she would understand.But if that happened tonight, there was no way she wouldnt take it personally.They walked up the front porch steps, and she felt a strange sense of dj vu.Of that first night theyd kissed.A feeling like they were on the edge of a change, terrified of what the outcome might be.Connor didnt seem to be suffering from the same sensation, since he just opened the door with no ceremony.She followed him into the living room and stood there, not entirely sure what she should do.Are you tired?he asked.Exhausted.And that was true.Why dont we go up to bed?His question hung in the air for a few moments, the significance of it slowly sinking in.We?Yeah, he said, holding out his hand.She didnt question him; she simply extended her hand and wrapped her fingers around his.He tugged slightly, and she followed his lead, up the stairs and down the hall toward his bedroom.Connor...I bought a different bed.Just...last year.I thought that might be relevant.She wasnt sure if she wouldve thought of that.Okay.I havent ever had sex with anyone in this bed.Okay.You dont seem that concerned.I dont...I guess I wasnt.Well, thats good.You thought about it, though.So it matters to you.He shrugged.Just because it matters to me doesnt mean it matters.I make a whole lot of things bigger than they should be.Tell me.I just thought it might help.So I got a new bed.Because to me...You know, we bought it when she moved in.So I just wanted you to know, this isnt that bed.Its just my bed.And I want you in it.Thank you.I just told you I want you in my bed, woman.And the best you have is thank you?Its better than apologizing.Which is kind of your thing, she said, her lips curving into a smile.Her chest still hurt from their conversation, her eyes still burning, but smiling with him still felt right.Still felt natural.Sorry if I rocked your world back there, he said, his voice rough.You did.In a lot of ways.She cleared her throat.Thank you for my dress.He cupped the back of her head and pulled her close, kissing her deep.Thank you for listening to me.Thank you for talking to me.She put her hand on his chest, her palm right over his heart.You dont ever have to worry about protecting me.Were friends.Now and always.And that means we are here to help each other carry this stuff.You never have to carry double when I could share it with you.He put his hand over hers, pressing hard.Thank you.Thats better than sorry, right?Better, she said, a smile curving her lips.Lets go to bed, Liss.* * * CONNOR KNEW THERE was nothing to be afraid of in sleep.It wasnt as if the bogeyman could reach your dreams and get you.Still, when his front porch and a flash of light went through his mind, his heart rate sped up, panic invading his body.But when he opened the door, it wasnt Eli standing there.It was Liss.Looking at him.Wanting something from him.Something he didnt think he could dig deep enough to find...He woke up breathing hard, a cold sweat covering his body.There was a delicate hand resting on his chest, silky curls spread over his shoulder.Liss was there still.And he was holding her.He wasnt alone.And his mattress wasnt cold.He lifted his hand and brushed her cheek with his knuckles, relishing the feel of her softness beneath his touch.It was funny how he had expected to wake up alone.And funnier still just how much of a relief it was to wake up with someone.And he hadnt been confused, even for a second, about who it was.Because Liss was...Liss.She smelled like wildflowers, courtesy of her perfume, and a little bit like sea salt thanks to the wind that tangled in her hair every time she walked outside.Even in the dark, he would always know it was her.He didnt want to close his eyes again.He just wanted to stay awake and look at Liss, highlighted by the pale moon that was shining through the window.
