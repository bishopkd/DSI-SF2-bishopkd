It was cool under the trees; the horse and I both exhaled with relief as we entered the shade.It was one of those rare hot days in Scotland, when the sun blazes out of a bleached muslin sky and the early haze is burnt away by eight oclock.The copse was loud with birds; a gang of titmice was foraging in the oak clump to the left, and I could hear what I thought was a thrasher in the near distance.I had always been an enthusiastic amateur birder.If I were marooned here til it suited my overbearing, domineering, pig headed jackass of a husband to finish risking his stupid neck, Id use the time to see what I could spot.I hobbled the gelding and turned him loose to graze in the lush grass at the edge of the copse, knowing he wouldnt go far.The grass ceased abruptly a few feet from the trees, smothered by the encroaching heather.It was a glade of mixed conifers and oak saplings, perfect for bird watching.I wandered through it, still mentally fuming at Jamie, but growing gradually calmer as I listened for the distinctive tsee of a flycatcher and the harsh chatter of the mistle thrush.The glade ended quite suddenly on the far side, on the edge of a small precipice.I thrust my way through the saplings and the sound of bird song was drowned in rushing water.I stood on the lip of a small burn, a steep rocky canyon with waterfalls bounding down the jagged walls to splash in the brown and silver pools below.I sat down on the edge of the bank and let my feet dangle over the water, enjoying the sun on my face.A crow shot past overhead, closely pursued by a pair of redstarts.The bulky black body zigzagged through the air, trying to avoid the tiny dive bombers.I smiled, watching the furious small parents chivying the crow to and fro, and wondered whether crows, left to their own devices, really did fly in a straight line.That one, if it kept to a straight path, would head straight for  I stopped dead.I had been so intent on arguing with Jamie that it had not until this minute dawned on me that the situation I had been vainly trying to bring about for two months had finally occurred.I was alone.And I knew where I was.Looking across the burn, my eyes were dazzled by the morning sun blazing through the red ash trees on the far bank.So that was east.My heart began to beat faster.East was over there, Lag Cruime was directly behind me.Lag Cruime was four miles to the north of Fort William.And Fort William was no more than three miles due west of the hill of Craigh na Dun.So, for the first time since my meeting with Murtagh, I knew approximately where I wasno more than seven miles from that bloody hill and its accursed stone circle.Seven milesperhapsfrom home.From Frank.I started back into the copse, but changed my mind.I dared not take the road.This close to Fort William and the several small villages that surrounded it, there was too much risk of meeting someone.And I could not take a horse down the precipitous course of the burn.In fact, I had some doubt that it could be managed on foot; the rock walls were sheer in some spots, plunging directly into the foaming water of the stream, with no real footing save the tops of scattered rocks sticking out of the rushing water.But it was by far the most direct path in the direction I wanted.And I did not dare to take too circuitous a route; I might easily lose my way in the wild growth or be overtaken by Jamie and Dougal, returning.My stomach gave a sudden lurch as I thought of Jamie.God, how could I do it?Leave him without a word of explanation or apology?Disappear without a trace, after what he had done for me?With that thought I finally decided to leave the horse.At least he would think I had not left him willingly; he might believe I had been killed by wild beastsI touched the dagger in my pocketor possibly kidnapped by outlaws.And finding no trace of me, eventually he would forget me, and wed again.Perhaps the lovely young Laoghaire, back at Leoch.Absurdly enough, I found that the thought of Jamie sharing Laoghaires bed upset me as much as the thought of leaving him.I cursed myself for idiocy, but I couldnt help imagining her sweet round face, flushed with ardent longing, and his big hands burying themselves in that moonbeam hair  I unclenched my teeth and resolutely wiped the tears off my cheeks.I hadnt time nor energy for senseless reflections.I must go, and now, while I could.It might be the best chance I would get.I hoped that Jamie would forget me.I knew that I would never be able to forget him.But for now, I must put him out of my mind, or I wouldnt be able to concentrate on the job at hand, which was tricky enough.Cautiously, I picked my way down the steep bank to the edge of the water.The noise of the rushing stream drowned out the birds in the copse above.The going was rough, but there was at least room to walk by the waters edge here.The bank was muddy, and strewn with rocks, but passable.Further down, I saw that I would have to step out actually into the water, and make my way precariously from rock to rock, balancing above the flood, until the bank widened enough to go ashore again.I picked my way painfully along, estimating how much time I might have.Jamie had said only that they would return before sundown.Three or four miles to Lag Cruime, but I had no way of knowing what the roads were like, nor how long the business with Horrocks might take.If he was there.But he would be, I argued with myself.Hugh Munro had said so, and outlandish as that grotesque figure had been, Jamie plainly considered him a reliable source of information.My foot slipped off the first rock in the stream, plunging me into icy water to the knee and soaking my skirt.I withdrew to the bank, tucked my skirts as high as I could and removed both shoes and stockings.I slipped these into the pocket made by my tucked up skirt and set my foot again on the rock.I found that by gripping with my toes, I could manage to step from rock to rock without slipping.The bunches of my skirt made it difficult to see where I was going to step next, though, and more than once I found myself sliding into the water.My legs were chilled, and as my feet grew numb, it got harder to maintain my grip.Luckily the bank widened again, and I stepped gratefully ashore into warm, sticky mud.Short periods of more or less comfortable squelching alternated with much longer periods of precarious rock hopping through the freezing rapids, and I found to my relief that I was much too busy to think very much about Jamie.After a time, I had the routine worked out.Step, grip, pause, look around, locate next step.Step, grip, pause, and so on.I must have become over confident, or perhaps only tired, because I got careless, and undershot my goal.My foot skidded helplessly down the near side of the slime coated rock.I waved my arms wildly, trying to move back to the rock I had been on, but my balance had shifted too far.Skirts, petticoats, dagger and all, I plunged into the water.And kept on plunging.While the stream overall was only a foot or two deep, there were intermittent deep pools, where the scouring water had scooped out deep depressions in the rock.The one on which Id lost my footing was perched on the edge of one such pool, and when I hit the water, I sank like a rock myself.I was so stunned by the shock of the icy water rushing into my nose and mouth that I didnt cry out.Silvery bubbles shot out of the bodice of my dress and rushed past my face toward the surface above.The cotton fabric soaked through almost at once, and the freezing grip of the water paralyzed my breathing.I began almost at once to fight my way up to the surface, but the weight of my garments pulled me down.I yanked frantically at the laces of my bodice, but there was no hope of getting everything off before I drowned.I made a number of savage and uncharitable silent observations about dressmakers, womens fashions, and the stupidity of long skirts, while kicking frenziedly to keep the entangling folds away from my legs.The water was crystal clear.My fingers brushed the rock wall, sliding through the dark slick streamers of duckweed and algae.Slippery as waterweed, thats what Jamie said about my  The thought jarred me out of my panic.Suddenly I realized that I shouldnt be exhausting myself trying to kick to the surface.The pool couldnt be more than eight or nine feet deep; what I needed to do was relax, float down to the bottom, brace my feet and spring upward.With luck, that would get my head clear for a breath, and even if I went down again, I could continue bouncing off the bottom until I worked my way close enough to the edge to get a decent grip on a rock.The descent was agonizingly slow.As I was no longer fighting upward, my skirts rose round me in billows, floating in front of my face.I batted them away; I must keep my face clear.My lungs were bursting and there were dark spots behind my eyes by the time my feet touched the smooth bottom of the pool.I let my knees bend slightly, pressing my skirts down around me, then shoved upward with all my might.It worked, just barely.My face broke the surface at the top of my leap, and I had just time for the briefest of life saving gulps before the water closed over me again.But it was enough.I knew I could do it again.I pressed my arms down to my sides to streamline myself and make the descent more rapid.Once more, Beauchamp, I thought.Bend your knees, brace yourself, jump!I shot upward, arms extended overhead.I had seen a flash of red overhead when I broke water last; there must be a rowan tree overhanging the water.Perhaps I could get hold of a branch.As my face broke water, something seized my outstretched hand.Something hard, warm, and reassuringly solid.Another hand.Coughing and spluttering, I groped blindly with my free hand, too glad of rescue to regret the interruption of my escape attempt.Glad, at least until, wiping the hair out of my eyes, I looked up into the beefy, anxious Lancashire face of young Corporal Hawkins.21    UNE MAUVAIS QUART DHEURE AFTER ANOTHER    I delicately removed a strand of still damp waterweed from my sleeve and placed it squarely in the center of the blotter.Then, seeing the inkstand handy, I picked up the weed and dipped it in, using the result to paint interesting patterns on the thick blotting paper.Getting fully into the spirit of the thing, I finished off my masterpiece with a rude word, carefully sprinkled it with sand and blotted it before propping it up against the bank of pigeon holes.I stepped back to admire the effect, then looked around for any other diversions that might take my mind off the impending advent of Captain Randall.Not bad for the private office of a captain, I thought, eyeing the paintings on the wall, the silver desk fittings, and the thick carpet on the floor.I moved back onto the carpet, in order to drip more effectively.The ride to Fort William had dried my outer garments fairly well, but the underlying layers of petticoat were still wringing wet.I opened a small cupboard behind the desk and discovered the Captains spare wig, neatly bestowed on one of a pair of wrought iron stands, with a matched silverbacked set of looking glass, military brushes, and tortoiseshell comb laid out in orderly ranks before it.Carrying the wig stand over to the desk, I gently sifted the remaining contents of the sander over it before replacing it in the cupboard.I was seated behind the desk, comb in hand, studying my reflection in the looking glass, when the Captain came in.He gave me a glance that took in my disheveled appearance, the rifled cupboard, and the disfigured blotter.Without blinking, he drew up a chair and sat down across from me, lounging casually with one booted foot resting on the opposite knee.A riding crop dangled from one fine, aristocratic hand.I watched the braided tip, black and scarlet, as it swung slowly back and forth over the carpet.The idea has its attractions, he said, watching my eyes follow the sweep of the whip.But I could probably think of something better, given a few moments to collect myself.I daresay you could, I said, fingering a thick sheaf of hair out of my eyes.But you arent allowed to flog women, are you?Only under certain circumstances, he said politely.Which your situation doesnt meetyet.Thats rather public, though.I had thought we might get better acquainted in private, first.He reached to the sideboard behind him for a decanter.We sipped the claret in silence, eyeing each other over the wine.I had forgotten to offer you felicitations on your marriage, he said suddenly.Forgive my lack of manners.Think nothing of it, I said graciously.Im sure my husbands family will be most obliged to you for offering me hospitality.Oh, I rather doubt it, he said, with an engaging smile.But then, I didnt think Id tell them you were here.What makes you think they dont know?I asked, beginning to feel rather hollow, despite my earlier resolve to brazen it out.I cast a quick glance at the window, but it was on the wrong side of the building.The sun wasnt visible, but the light looked yellow; perhaps mid afternoon?How long before Jamie found my abandoned horse?And how long after that before he followed my trail into the streamand promptly lost it?Disappearing without a trace had its drawbacks.In fact, unless Randall decided to send word of my whereabouts to Dougal, there was no way on earth the Scots could know where I had gone.If they knew, the Captain said, arching one elegantly shaped brow, they would presumably be calling on me already.Considering the sorts of names Dougal MacKenzie applied to me on the occasion of our last meeting, I scarcely think he feels me a suitable chaperon for a kinswoman.And the clan MacKenzie seems to think youre of such value that theyd rather adopt you as one of their own than see you fall into my hands.I can hardly imagine they would allow you to languish in durance vile here.He looked me over disapprovingly, taking in every detail of my waterlogged costume, unkempt hair, and generally disheveled appearance.Damned if I know what they want you for, he observed.Or, if youre so valuable to them, why the devil they let you wander about the countryside by yourself.I thought even barbarians took better care of their womenfolk than that.A sudden gleam came into his eyes.Or have you perhaps decided to part company with them?He sat back, intrigued by this new speculation.The wedding night was more of a trial than you anticipated?he inquired.I must confess, I was somewhat put out to hear that you preferred the alternative of bedding one of those hairy, half naked savages to further discussions with me.That argues a high devotion to duty, Madam, and I must congratulate whomever employs you on their ability to inspire it.But, he leaned still further back in his chair, balancing the claret cup on his knee, I am afraid I still must insist on the name of your employer.If you have indeed parted company with the MacKenzies, the most likely supposition is that youre a French agent.But whose?He stared at me intently, like a snake hoping to fascinate a bird.By now I had had enough claret to fill part of the hollow space inside me, though, and I stared back.Oh, I said, elaborately polite, Im included in this conversation, am I?I thought you were doing quite well by yourself.Pray continue.The graceful line of his mouth tightened a bit, and the deep crease at the corner grew deeper, but he didnt say anything.Setting his glass aside, he rose, and taking off his wig, went to the cupboard, where he placed it on an empty stand.I saw him pause for a moment, as he saw the dark grains of sand adorning his other wig, but his expression didnt change noticeably.Unwigged, his hair was dark, thick, fine textured, and shiny.It was also disturbingly familiar looking, though it was shoulder length and tied back with a blue silk ribbon.He removed this, plucked the comb from the desk and tidied the hair flattened by the wig, then retied the ribbon with some care.I helpfully held up the looking glass, so that he could judge the final effect.He took it from me in a marked manner and restored it to its place, shutting the cupboard door with what was almost a slam.I couldnt tell whether this delay was in hopes of unnerving mein which case; it was workingor merely because he couldnt decide what to do next.The tension was slightly relieved by the entrance of an orderly, bearing a tray of tea things.Still silent, Randall poured out and offered me a cup.We sipped some more.Dont tell me, I said finally.Let me guess.Its a new form of persuasion youve inventedtorture by bladder.You ply me with drinkables until I promise to tell you anything in exchange for five minutes with a chamber pot.He was so taken by surprise that he actually laughed.It quite transformed his face, and I had no difficulty seeing why there were so many scented envelopes with feminine handwriting in the bottom left hand drawer of his desk.Having let the facade crack, he didnt stifle the laugh, but let it go.Finished, he stared at me again, a half smile lingering on his mouth.Whatever else you may be, Madam, at least youre a diversion, he remarked.He yanked at a bellpull hanging by the door, and when the orderly reappeared, instructed him to convey me to the necessary facilities.But take care not to lose her on the way, Thompson, he added, opening the door for me with a sardonic bow.I leaned weakly against the door of the privy to which I was shown.Being out of his presence was a relief, but a short lived one.I had had ample opportunity to judge Randalls true character, both from the stories I had heard and from personal experience.But there were those damnable flashes of Frank that kept showing through the gleaming, ruthless exterior.It had been a mistake to make him laugh, I thought.I sat down, ignoring the stench in my concentration on the problem at hand.Escape seemed unlikely.The vigilant Thompson aside, Randalls office was in a building located near the center of the compound.And while the fort itself was no more than a stone stockade, the walls were ten feet high and the double gates well guarded.I thought of feigning illness and remaining in my refuge, but dismissed itand not only because of the unpleasantness of the surroundings.The unpalatable truth was that there was little point in delaying tactics, unless I had something to delay for, and I didnt.No one knew where I was, and Randall didnt mean to tell anyone.I was his, for as long as he cared to amuse himself with me.Once again, I regretted making him laugh.A sadist with a sense of humor was particularly dangerous.Thinking frantically in search of something useful I might know about the Captain, I latched onto a name.Half heard and carelessly remembered, I hoped I had it right.It was a pitifully small card to play, but the only one I had.I drew a deep breath, hastily let it out again, and stepped out of my sanctuary.Back in the office, I added sugar to my tea and stirred it carefully.Then cream.Having drawn out the ceremony as long as I could, I was forced to look at Randall.He was sitting back in his favorite pose, cup elegantly suspended in midair, the better to look at me over.Well?I said.You neednt worry about spoiling my appetite, since I havent got one.What do you mean to do about me?He smiled and took a careful sip of the scalding tea before replying.Nothing.Really?I lifted my brows in surprise.Invention failed you, has it?I shouldnt care to think so, he said, polite as usual.His eyes traveled over me once more, far from polite.No, he said, his gaze lingering on the edge of my bodice, where the tucked kerchief left the upper swell of my breasts visible, much as I would like to give you a badly needed lesson in manners, I am afraid the pleasure must be postponed indefinitely.Im sending you to Edinburgh with the next posting of dispatches.And I shouldnt care to have you arrive damaged in any visible way; my superiors might consider it careless of me.Edinburgh?I couldnt hide my surprise.Yes.Youve heard of the Tolbooth, I imagine?I had.One of the most noisome and notorious prisons of the period, it was famous for filth, crime, disease, and darkness.A good many of the prisoners held there died before they could be brought to trial.I swallowed hard, forcing down the bitter bile that had risen at the back of my throat, mingling with the swallow of sweet tea.Randall sipped his own tea, pleased with himself.You should feel quite cozy there.After all, you seem to prefer a certain dank squalor in your surroundings.He cast a condemning glance at the soggy hem of my petticoat, sagging below my gown.Should be quite homelike, after Castle Leoch.I rather doubted that the cuisine at the Tolbooth was as good as that to be had at Colums board.And general questions of amenities aside, I couldntcould notallow him to send me to Edinburgh.Once immured in the Tolbooth, I would never get back to the stone circle.The time to play my card had arrived.Now or never.I raised my own cup.Just as you like, I said calmly.What do you suppose the Duke of Sandringham will have to say about it?He upset the hot tea on his doeskin lap and made several very gratifying noises.Tsk, I said, reprovingly.He subsided, glaring.The teacup lay on its side, its brown contents soaking into the pale green carpet, but he made no move toward the bellpull.A small muscle jumped in the side of his neck.I had already found the pile of starched handkerchiefs in the upper lefthand drawer of the desk, alongside an enameled snuffbox.I pulled one out and handed it to him.I do hope it doesnt stain, I said sweetly.No, he said, ignoring the handkerchief.He eyed me closely.No, it isnt possible.Why not?I asked, affecting nonchalance, wondering what wasnt possible.I would have been told.And if you were working for Sandringham, why the devil would you act in such a damned ridiculous manner?Perhaps the Duke is testing your loyalty, I suggested at random, preparing to leap to my feet if necessary.His fists were bunched at his side, and the discarded riding crop was within much too easy a reach on the desk nearby.He snorted in response to this suggestion.You may be testing my gullibility.Or my tolerance to irritation.Both, Madam, are extremely low.His eyes narrowed speculatively, and I braced myself for a quick dash.He lunged, and I flung myself to one side.Getting hold of the teapot, I threw it at him.He dodged, and it hit the door with a satisfying crash.The orderly, who must have been lingering just outside, poked a startled head in.Breathing heavily, the Captain motioned him impatiently into the room.Hold her, he ordered brusquely, crossing toward the desk.I began to breathe deeply, both in hopes of calming myself and in anticipation of not being able to do it in a moment.Instead of hitting me, though, he merely pulled out the lower right hand drawer, which I had not had time to investigate, and pulled out a long strand of thin rope.What kind of gentleman keeps rope in his desk drawers?I inquired indignantly.A prepared one, Madam, he murmured, tying my wrists securely behind me.Go, he said impatiently to the orderly, jerking his head toward the door.And dont come back, no matter what you hear.This sounded distinctly ominous, and my forebodings were abundantly justified as he reached into the drawer once more.There is something unnerving about a knife.Men who are fearless in personal combat will shrink from a naked blade.I shrank myself, until my bound hands collided with the whitewashed wall.The wicked gleaming point lowered and pressed between my breasts.Now, he said pleasantly, you are going to tell me everything you know about the Duke of Sandringham.The blade pressed a little harder, making a dent in the fabric of my gown.Take as long as you like about it, my dear.I am in no hurry whatsoever.There was a small pop!as the point punctured the fabric.I felt it, cold as fear, a tiny spot directly over my heart.Randall slowly drew the knife in a semicircle under one breast.The homespun came free and fell away with a flutter of white chemise, and my breast sprang out.Randall seemed to have been holding his breath; he exhaled slowly now, his eyes fixed on mine.I sidled away from him, but there was very little room to maneuver.I ended up pressed against the desk, bound hands gripping the edge.If he came close enough, I thought, I might be able to rock backward on my hands and kick the knife out of his hand.I doubted that he meant to kill me; certainly not until he had found out just what I knew about his relations with the Duke.Somehow that conclusion was of relatively little comfort.He smiled, with that unnerving resemblance to Franks smile; that lovely smile which I had seen charm students and melt the stoniest college administrator.Possibly under other circumstances, I would have found this man charming, but just at presentno.He moved in fast, thrusting a knee between my thighs and pushing my shoulders back.Unable to keep my balance, I fell heavily backward on the desk, crying out as I landed painfully on my bound wrists.He pressed himself between my legs, scrabbling with one hand to raise my skirts while the other fastened on my bared breast, rolling and pinching.I kicked frantically, but my skirts got in the way.He grasped my foot and ran a hand up my leg, pushing damp petticoats, skirt, and chemise out of the way, tossing them up above my waist.His hand dropped to his breeches.Shades of Harry the deserter, I thought furiously.What in Gods name is the British army coming to?Glorious traditions, my aunt Fanny.In the midst of an English garrison, screaming was unlikely to attract any helpful attention, but I filled my lungs and had a try, more as a pro forma protest than anything else.I had expected a slap or shake in return, to shut me up.Instead, unexpectedly, he appeared to like it.Go ahead and scream, sweeting, he murmured, busy with his flies.Ill enjoy it much more if you scream.I looked him straight in the eye and snapped Get stuffed!with perfect clarity and terrible inaptness.A lock of dark hair came loose and fell across his forehead in rakish disarray.He looked so like his six times great grandson that I was seized by a horrible impulse to open my legs and respond to him.He twisted my breast savagely and the impulse disappeared at once.I was furiously angry, disgusted, humiliated, and revolted, but curiously not very frightened.I felt a heavy, flopping movement against my leg and suddenly realized why.He wasnt going to enjoy it unless I screamedand possibly not then.Oh, like that, is it?I said, and was rewarded at once with a sharp slap across the face.I shut my mouth grimly and turned my head away lest I be tempted into any more injudicious remarks.I realized that rape or not, I was in considerable danger from his unstable temper.Looking away from the sight of Randall, I caught a sudden flicker of movement at the window.Ill thank ye, said a cool, level voice, to take your hands off my wife.Randall froze with a hand still on my breast.Jamie was crouched in the window frame, a large, brass handled pistol braced across one forearm.Randall stood frozen for a second, as though unable to believe his ears.As his head turned slowly toward the window, his right hand, shielded from Jamies view, left my breast, sliding stealthily toward the knife, which he had laid on the desk next to my head.What did you say?he said, incredulously.As his hand fastened on the knife, he turned far enough to see who had spoken.He stopped again for a moment, staring, then began to laugh.Lord help us, its the young Scottish wildcat!I thought Id dealt with you once and for all!Back healed after all, did it?And this is your wife, you say?Quite a tasty little wench, she is, quite like your sister.Still shielded by his partly turned body, Randalls knife hand swiveled; the blade was now pointed at my throat.I could see Jamie over his shoulder, braced in the window like a cat about to spring.The pistol barrel didnt waver, nor did he change expression.The only clue to his emotions was the dusky red creeping up his throat; his collar was unbuttoned and the small scar on his neck flamed crimson.Almost casually, Randall slowly raised the knife into view, point almost touching my throat.He half turned toward Jamie.Perhaps youd better toss that pistol over hereunless youre weary of married life.If youd prefer to be a widower, of course Their eyes locked tight as a lovers embrace, neither man moved for a long minute.Finally, Jamies body relaxed its springlike tension.He let out his breath in a long sigh of resignation and tossed the pistol into the room.It hit the floor with a clunk and slid almost to Randalls feet.Randall bent and scooped up the gun in a quicksilver motion.As soon as the knife left my throat, I tried to sit up, but he placed a hand on my chest and shoved me flat again.He held me down with one hand, using the other to aim the pistol at Jamie.The discarded knife lay somewhere on the floor near my feet, I thought.Now, if only I had prehensile toes.The dirk in my pocket was as unreachable as if it were on Mars.The smile had not left Randalls features since Jamies appearance.Now it broadened, enough to show the pointed dog teeth.Well, thats a bit better.The pressing hand left my chest to return to the swelling flies of his breeches.I was engaged when you arrived, my dear fellow.Youll forgive me if I get on with what I was doing before I attend to you.The red color had spread completely over Jamies face, but he stood motionless, the gun pointed at his middle.As Randall finished his maneuvers, Jamie launched himself at the open mouth of the pistol.I tried to scream, to stop him, but my mouth was dry with terror.Randalls knuckles whitened as he squeezed the trigger.The hammer clicked on an empty chamber, and Jamies fist drove into Randalls stomach.There was a dull crunching sound as his other fist splintered the officers nose, and a fine spray of blood spattered my skirt.Randalls eyes rolled up in his head, and he dropped to the floor like a stone.Jamie was behind me, pulling me up, sawing at the rope around my wrists.You bluffed your way in here with an empty gun?I croaked hysterically.If it were loaded, I would ha just shot him in the first place, wouldnt I?!Jamie hissed.Feet were coming down the corridor toward the office.The rope came free and Jamie yanked me to the window.It was an eight foot drop to the ground, but the footsteps were almost to the door.We jumped together.I landed with a bone shaking jar and rolled in a tumble of skirts and petticoats.Jamie jerked me to my feet and pressed me against the wall of the building.Feet were passing the corner of the building; six soldiers came into view, but didnt look in our direction.As soon as they were safely past, Jamie took my hand and motioned toward the other corner.We sidled along the building, stopping short of the corner.I could see where we were now.About twenty feet away, a ladder led up to a sort of catwalk that ran along the inside of the forts outer wall.He nodded toward it; this was our objective.He brought his head close to mine and whispered, When ye hear an explosion, run like hell and get up that ladder.Ill be behind ye.I nodded understanding.My heart was going like a trip hammer; glancing down, I saw that one breast was still exposed.Not much to be done about it just at present.I rucked up my skirts, ready to run.There was an almighty roar from the other side of the building, like a mortar explosion.Jamie gave me a shove and I was off, running as fast as I could go.I jumped for the ladder, caught it and scrambled up; I felt the wood jerk and tremble as Jamies weight hit the ladder below me.Turning at the top of the ladder, I had a birds eye view of the fort.Black smoke was billowing up from a small building near the back wall, and men were running toward it from every direction.Jamie popped up beside me.This way.He ran crouching along the catwalk, and I followed.We stopped near the flag staff set in the wall.The ensign flapped heavily above us, halyard beating a rhythmic tattoo against the pole.Jamie was peering over the wall, looking for something.I looked back over the camp.The men were clustering at the small building, milling and shouting.Off to one side, I spotted a small wooden platform, set three or four feet high, with steps leading up.A heavy wooden post rose out of the center, cross beamed, with rope manacles dangling from the arms of the cross.Suddenly Jamie gave a whistle; looking over the wall, I saw Rupert, mounted and leading Jamies horse.He looked up at the sound of the whistle and maneuvered the horses close to the wall below us.Jamie was cutting the halyard from the flagpole.The heavy red and blue folds of the flag drooped and slid down, landing with a swishing thud next to me.Twisting a rope end rapidly around one of the struts, Jamie tossed the rest down the outside of the wall.Come on!he said.Hold tight with both hands, brace your feet against the wall!Go!I went, bracing my feet and paying out rope; the thin cordage slipped and burned in my hands.I dropped next to the horses and hurried to mount.Jamie vaulted into the saddle behind me a moment later, and we took off at a gallop.We slowed our pace a mile or two from the camp, when it became apparent that we had lost any pursuers.After a short conference, Dougal decided that we had better make for the border of the Mackintosh lands, as being the closest safe clan territory.Doonesburys within riding distance by tonight, and likely to be safe enough.Therell be word out on us tomorrow, but well be across the border before it reaches there.It was mid afternoon by then; we set off at a steady pace, our horse with its double load lagging slightly behind the others.My horse, I supposed, was still happily eating grass in the copse, waiting to be led home by whoever was lucky enough to find it.* * *    How did you find me?I asked.I was beginning to shake in reaction, and folded my arms around myself to still the quivering.My clothes had dried completely by this time, but I felt a chill that went bone deep.I thought better of leaving ye alone, and sent a man back to stay wi ye.He didna see ye leave, but he saw the English soldiers cross the ford, and you wi them.Jamies voice was cold.I couldnt blame him, I supposed.My teeth were beginning to chatter.Im s surprised that you didnt just think I was an English spy and l leave me there.Dougal wanted to.But the man who saw ye with the soldiers said you were struggling.I had to go and see, at least.He glanced down at me, not changing expression.Youre lucky, Sassenach, that I saw what I did in that room.At least Dougal must admit that youre not in league wi the English.D Dougal, eh?And what about you?Wh what do you think?I demanded.He did not reply, but only snorted briefly.He did at last take pity on me to the extent of jerking off his plaid and flinging it over my shoulders, but he would not put his arm around me nor touch me more than strictly necessary.He rode in grim silence, handling the reins with an angry jerkiness quite unlike his usual smooth grace.Upset and unsettled myself, I was in no frame of mind to put up with moods.Well, what is it, then?Whats the matter?I asked impatiently.Dont sulk, for heavens sake!I spoke more sharply than I intended, and I felt him stiffen still further.Suddenly he turned the horses head aside and reined up at the side of the road.Before I knew what was happening, he had dismounted and jerked me from the saddle as well.I landed awkwardly, staggering to keep my balance as my feet hit the ground.Dougal and the others paused, seeing us stop.Jamie made a short, sharp gesture, sending them on, and Dougal waved in acknowledgment.Dont take too long, he called, and they set off again.Jamie waited until they were out of earshot.Then he yanked me around to face him.He was clearly furious, on the verge of explosion.I felt my own wrath rising; what right did he have to treat me like this?Sulking!he said.Sulking, is it?Im using all the self control Ive got, to keep from shakin ye til your teeth rattle, and you tell me not to sulk!What in the name of God is the matter with you?I asked angrily.I tried to shake off his grip, but his fingers dug into my upper arms like the teeth of a trap.Whats the matter wi me?Ill tell ye what the matter is, since ye want to know!he said through clenched teeth.Im tired of having to prove over and over that youre no an English spy.Im tired of having to watch ye very minute, for fear of what foolishness youll try next.And Im verra tired of people trying to make me watch while they rape you!I dinna enjoy it a bit!And you think I enjoy it?I yelled.Are you trying to make out its my fault?!At this, he did shake me slightly.It is your fault!Did ye stay put where I ordered ye to stay this mornin, this would never have happened!But no, ye wont listen to me, Im no but your husband, why mind me?You take it into your mind to do as ye damn please, and next I ken, I find ye flat on your back wi your skirts up, an the worst scum in the land between your legs, on the point of takin ye before my eyes!His Scots accent, usually slight, was growing broader by the second, sure sign that he was upset, had I needed any further indication.We were almost nose to nose by this time, shouting into each others face.Jamie was flushed with fury, and I felt the blood rising in my own face.Its your own fault, for ignoring me and suspecting me all the time!I told you the truth about who I am!And I told you there was no danger in my going with you, but would you listen to me?No!Im only a woman, why should you pay any attention to what I say?Women are only fit to do as theyre told, and follow orders, and sit meekly around with their hands folded, waiting for the men to come back and tell them what to do!He shook me again, unable to control himself.And if yed done that, we wouldna be on the run, with a hundred Redcoats on our tail!God, woman, I dinna know whether to strangle ye or throw ye on the ground and hammer ye senseless, but by Jesus, I want to do something to you.At this, I made a determined effort to kick him in the balls.He dodged, and jammed his own knee between my legs, effectively preventing any further attempts.Try that again and Ill slap you til your ears ring, he growled.Youre a brute and a fool, I panted, struggling to escape his grip on my shoulders.Do you think I went out and got captured by the English on purpose?I do think ye did it on purpose, to get back at me for what happened in the glade!My mouth fell open.In the glade?With the English deserters?Aye!Ye think I should ha been able to protect ye there, an youre right.But I couldna do it; you had to do it yourself, and now youre tryin to make me pay for it by deliberately putting yourself, my wife, in the hands of a man thats shed my blood!Your wife!Your wife!You dont care a thing about me!Im just your property; it only matters to you because you think I belong to you, and you cant stand to have someone take something that belongs to you!Ye do belong to me, he roared, digging his fingers into my shoulders like spikes.And you are my wife, whether ye like it or no!I dont like it!I dont like it a bit!But that doesnt matter either, does it?As long as Im there to warm your bed, you dont care what I think or how I feel!Thats all a wife is to yousomething to stick your cock into when you feel the urge!At this, his face went dead white and he began to shake me in earnest.My head jerked violently and my teeth clacked together, making me bite my tongue painfully.Let go of me!I shouted.Let go, youI deliberately used the words of Harry the deserter, trying to hurt himyou rutting bastard!He did let go, and fell back a pace, eyes blazing.Ye foul tongued bitch!Yell no speak to me that way!Ill speak any way I want to!You cant tell me what to do!Seems I cant!Yell do as ye wish, no matter who ye hurt by it, wont ye?Ye selfish, willful  Its your bloody pride thats hurt!I shouted.I saved us both from those deserters in the glade, and you cant stand it, can you?You just stood there!If I hadnt had a knife, wed both be dead now!Until I spoke the words, I had had no idea that I had been angry with him for failing to protect me from the English deserters.In a more rational mood, the thought would never have entered my mind.It wasnt his fault, I would have said.It was just luck that I had the knife, I would have said.But now I realized that fair or not, rational or not, I did somehow feel that it was his responsibility to protect me, and that he had failed me.Perhaps because he so clearly felt that way.He stood glaring at me, panting with emotion.When he spoke again, his voice was low and ragged with passion.You saw that post in the yard of the fort?I nodded shortly.Well, I was tied to that post, tied like an animal, and whipped til my blood ran!Ill carry the scars from it til I die.If Id not been lucky as the devil this afternoon, thats the least as would have happened to me.Likely theyd have flogged me, then hanged me.He swallowed hard, and went on.I knew that, and I didna hesitate for one second to go into that place after you, even thinking that Dougal might be right!Do ye know where I got the gun I used?I shook my head numbly, my own anger beginning to fade.I killed a guard near the wall.He fired at me; thats why it was empty.He missed and I killed him wi my dirk; left it sticking in his wishbone when I heard you cry out.I would have killed a dozen men to get to you, Claire.His voice cracked.And when ye screamed, I went to you, armed wi nothing but an empty gun and my two hands.Jamie was speaking a little more calmly now, but his eyes were still wild with pain and rage.I was silent.Unsettled by the horror of my encounter with Randall, I had not at all appreciated the desperate courage it had taken for him to come into the fort after me.He turned away suddenly, shoulders slumping.Youre right, he said quietly.Aye, youre quite right.Suddenly the rage was gone from his voice, replaced by a tone I had never heard in him before, even in the extremities of physical pain.My pride is hurt.And my pride is about all Ive got left to me.He leaned his forearms against a rough barked pine and let his head drop onto them, exhausted.His voice was so low I could barely hear him.Youre tearin my guts out, Claire.Something very similar was happening to my own.Tentatively, I came up behind him.He didnt move, even when I slipped my arms around his waist.I rested my cheek on his bowed back.His shirt was damp, sweated through with the intensity of his passion, and he was trembling.Im sorry, I said, simply.Please forgive me.He turned then, to hold me tightly.I felt his trembling ease bit by bit.Forgiven, lass, he murmured at last into my hair.Releasing me, he looked down at me, sober and formal.Im sorry too, he said.Ill ask your pardon for what I said; I was sore, and I said more nor I meant.Will ye forgive me too?After his last speech, I hardly felt that there was anything for me to forgive, but I nodded and pressed his hands.Forgiven.In an easier silence, we mounted again.The road was straight for a long way here, and far ahead I could see a small cloud of dust that must be Dougal and the other men.Jamie was back with me again; he held me with one arm as we rode, and I felt safer.But there was still a vague sense of injury and constraint; things were not yet healed between us.We had forgiven each other, but our words still hung in memory, not to be forgotten.22    RECKONINGS    We reached Doonesbury well after dark.It was a fair sized coach stop with an inn, fortunately.Dougal closed his eyes briefly in pain as he paid the innkeeper; it would take quite a bit of extra silver to insure his silence as to our presence.The silver, however, also insured a hearty supper, with plenty of ale.Despite the food, supper was a grim affair, eaten mostly in silence.Sitting there in my ruined gown, modestly covered by Jamies extra shirt, I was plainly in disgrace.Except for Jamie, the men behaved as though I were completely invisible, and even Jamie did no more than shove bread and meat in my direction from time to time.It was a relief at last to go up to our chamber, small and cramped though it was.I sank on the bed with a sigh, disregarding the state of the bedclothes.Im done in.Its been a long day.Aye, it has that.Jamie unfastened his collar and cuffs and unbuckled his sword belt, but made no move to undress further.He pulled the strap from the scabbard and doubled it, flexing the leather meditatively.Come to bed, Jamie.What are you waiting for?He came to stand by the bed, swinging the belt gently back and forth.Well, lass, Im afraid weve a matter still to settle between us before we sleep tonight.I felt a sudden stab of apprehension.What is it?He didnt answer at once.Deliberately not sitting down on the bed by me, he pulled up a stool and sat facing me instead.Do ye realize, Claire, he said quietly, that all of us came close to bein killed this afternoon?I looked down at the quilt, shamefaced.Yes, I know.My fault.Im sorry.Aye, so ye realize, he said.Do ye know that if a man among us had done such a thing, to put the rest in danger, he would ha likely had his ears cropped, or been flogged, if not killed outright?I blanched at this.No, I didnt know.Well, I know as youre not yet familiar wi our ways, and its some excuse.Still I did tell ye to stay hid, and had ye done so, it would never have happened.Now the English will be lookin high and low for us; we shall have to lie hid during the days and travel at night now.He paused.And as for Captain Randallaye, thats something else again.Hell be looking for you especially, you mean, now that he knows youre here?He nodded absently, looking off into the fire.Aye.Heits personal, with him, ye know?Im so sorry, Jamie, I said.Jamie dismissed this with a wave of the hand.Eh, if it were only me yed hurt by it, I wouldna say more about it.Though since were talkin, he shot me a sharp glance, Ill tell ye that it near killed me to see that animal with his hands on you.He looked off into the fire, grim faced, as though reliving the afternoons events.I thought of telling him about Randallsdifficulties, but was afraid it would do more harm than good.I desperately wanted to hold Jamie and beg him to forgive me, but I didnt dare to touch him.After a long moment of silence, he sighed and stood up, slapping the belt lightly against his thigh.Well, then, he said.Best get on wi it.Youve done considerable damage by crossing my orders, and Im going to punish ye for it, Claire.Yell recall what I told ye when I left ye this morning?I recalled all right, and I hastily flung myself across the bed so my back was pressed to the wall.What do you mean?Ye know quite well what I mean, he said firmly.Kneel down by the bed and lift your skirts, lass.Ill do no such thing!I took a good hold on the bedpost with both hands and wormed my way further into the corner.Jamie watched me through narrowed eyes for a moment, debating what to do next.It occurred to me that there was nothing whatever to stop him doing anything he liked to me; he outweighed me by a good five stone.He at last decided on talk rather than action, though, and carefully laid the strap aside before crawling over the bedclothes to sit beside me.Now, Claire he began.Ive said Im sorry!I burst out.And I am.Ill never do such a thing again!Well, thats the point, he said slowly.Ye might.And its because ye dinna take things as serious as they are.Ye come from a place where things are easier, I think.Tis not a matter of life or death where ye come from, to disobey orders or take matters into your own hands.At worst, ye might cause someone discomfort, or be a bit of a nuisance, but it isna likely to get someone killed.I watched his fingers pleating the brownish plaid of his kilt as he arranged his thoughts.Its the hard truth that a light action can have verra serious consequences in places and times like theseespecially for a man like me.He patted my shoulder, seeing that I was close to tears.I know ye would never endanger me or anyone else on purpose.But ye might easily do so without meanin it, like ye did today, because ye do not really believe me yet when I tell ye that some things are dangerous.Youre accustomed to think for yourself, and I know, he glanced sidewise at me, that youre not accustomed to lettin a man tell ye what to do.But you must learn to do so, for all our sakes.All right, I said slowly.I understand.Youre right, of course.All right; Ill follow your orders, even if I dont agree with them.Good.He stood up, and picked up the belt.Now then, get off the bed, and well get it over with.My mouth dropped open in outrage.What?!I said Id follow your orders!He sighed, exasperated, then sat down again on the stool.He looked at me levelly.Now, listen.Ye understand me, ye say, and I believe it.But theres a difference between understandin something with your mind and really knowing it, deep down.I nodded, reluctantly.All right.Now, I will have to punish you, and for two reasons: first, so that ye will know.He smiled suddenly.I can tell ye from my own experience that a good hiding makes ye consider things in a more serious light.I took a tighter hold on the bedpost.The other reason, he went on, is because of the other men.Yell have noticed how they were tonight?I had; it had been so uncomfortable at dinner that I was glad to escape to the room.Theres such a thing as justice, Claire.Youve done wrong to them all, and youll have to suffer for it.He took a deep breath.Im your husband; its my duty to attend to it, and I mean to do it.I had strong objections to this proposal on several levels.Whatever the justice of the situationand I had to admit that at least some of it lay on his sidemy sense of amour propre was deeply offended at the thought of being beaten, by whomever and for whatever reason.I felt deeply betrayed that the man I depended on as friend, protector, and lover intended to do such a thing to me.And my sense of self preservation was quietly terrified at the thought of submitting myself to the mercies of someone who handled a fifteen pound claymore as though it were a flywhisk.I will not allow you to beat me, I said firmly, keeping a tight hold on the bedpost.Oh, you wont?He raised sandy brows.Well, Ill tell ye, lass, I doubt youve much to say about it.Youre my wife, like it or not.Did I want to break your arm, or feed ye naught but bread and water, or lock ye in a closet for daysand dont think ye dont tempt me, eitherI could do that, let alone warm your bum for you.Ill scream!Likely.If not before, certainly during.I expect theyll hear ye at the next farm; youve got good lungs.He grinned odiously and came across the bed after me.He pried my fingers loose with some difficulty, and pulled firmly, hauling me to the side of the bed.I kicked him in the shins, but did no damage, not having shoes on.Grunting slightly, he managed to turn me facedown on the bed, twisting my arm to hold me there.I mean to do it, Claire!Now, if youll cooperate wi me, well call the account square with a dozen strokes.And if not?I quavered.He picked up the strap and slapped it against his leg with a nasty thwapping sound.Then I shall put a knee in your back and beat you til my arm tires, and I warn ye, youll tire of it long before I do.I bounced off the bed and whirled to face him, fists clenched.You barbarian!Youyou sadist!I hissed furiously.Youre doing this for your own pleasure!Ill never forgive you for this!Jamie paused, twisting the belt.He replied levelly, I dinna know whats a sadist.And if I forgive you for this afternoon, I reckon youll forgive me, too, as soon as ye can sit down again.As for my pleasure His lip twitched.I said I would have to punish you.I did not say I wasna going to enjoy it.He crooked a finger at me.Come here.* * *    I was reluctant to leave the sanctuary of the room next morning, and fiddled about, tying and untying ribbons and brushing my hair.I had not spoken to Jamie since the night before, but he noticed my hesitation and urged me to come out with him to breakfast.You dinna need to fear meetin the others, Claire.Theyll chaff ye a bit, likely, but it wont be bad.Chin up.He chucked me under the chin, and I bit his hand, sharply but not deep.Ooh!He snatched his fingers back.Be careful, lass; you dont know where theyve been.He left me, chuckling, and went in to breakfast.He might well be in a good mood, I thought bitterly.If it were revenge hed wanted the night before, hed had it.It had been a most unpleasant night.My reluctant acquiescence had lasted precisely as far as the first searing crack of leather on flesh.This was followed by a short, violent struggle, which left Jamie with a bloody nose, three lovely gouges down one cheek, and a deeply bitten wrist.Not surprisingly, it left me half smothered in the greasy quilts with a knee in my back, being beaten within an inch of my life.Jamie, damn his black Scottish soul, turned out to be right.The men were restrained in their greetings, but friendly enough; the hostility and contempt of the night before had vanished.As I was dishing eggs at the sideboard, Dougal came up and slipped a fatherly arm around my shoulders.His beard tickled my ear as he spoke in a confidential rumble.I hope Jamie wasna too harsh wi ye last night, lass.It sounded as though ye were bein murderrt, at least.I flushed hotly and turned away so he wouldnt see it.After Jamies obnoxious remarks, I had resolved to keep my mouth firmly shut through the whole ordeal.However, when it came to the event, I would have challenged the Sphinx itself to keep a shut mouth while on the receiving end of a strap wielded by Jamie Fraser.Dougal turned to call to Jamie, seated at the table eating bread and cheese.Hey now, Jamie, it wasna necessary to half kill the lass.A gentle reminder would ha sufficed.He patted me firmly on the posterior in illustration, making me wince.I glowered at him.A blistered bum never did anyone no permanent harm, said Murtagh, through a mouthful of bread.No, indeed, said Ned, grinning.Come have a seat, lassie.Ill stand, thank you, I said with dignity, making them all roar with laughter.Jamie was careful not to meet my eyes, as he studiously cut up a bit of cheese.There was a bit more good natured chaff during the day, and each of the men made some excuse to pat my rump in mock sympathy.On the whole, though, it was bearable, and I grudgingly began to consider that Jamie might have been right, though I still wanted to strangle him.Since sitting down was completely out of the question, I busied myself during the morning with small chores such as hemming and button sewing, which could be done at the window sill, with the excuse of needing the light to sew by.After lunch, which I ate standing, we all went to our rooms to rest.Dougal had decided that we would wait til full dark to set out for Bargrennan, the next stop on our journey.Jamie followed me to our room, but I shut the door firmly in his face.Let him sleep on the floor again.He had been fairly tactful last night, buckling his belt back on and leaving the room without speaking immediately after hed finished.He had come back an hour later, after Id put out the light and gone to bed, but had had sense enough not to try to come into bed with me.After peering into the darkness where I lay unmoving, he had sighed deeply, wrapped himself in his plaid, and gone to sleep on the floor near the door.Too angry, upset, and physically uncomfortable to sleep, I had lain awake most of the night, alternately thinking over what Jamie had said with wanting to get up and kick him in some sensitive spot.Were I being objective, which I was in no mood to be, I might admit that he was right when he said that I didnt take things with the proper seriousness.He was wrong, though, when he said it was because things were less precarious in my own placewherever that was.In fact, I thought, it was more likely the opposite was true.This time was in many ways still unreal to me; something from a play or a fancy dress pageant.Compared to the sights of mechanized mass warfare I had come from, the small pitched battles I had seena few men armed with swords and musketsseemed picturesque rather than threatening to me.I was having trouble with the scale of things.A man killed with a musket was just as dead as one killed with a mortar.It was just that the mortar killed impersonally, destroying dozens of men, while the musket was fired by one man who could see the eyes of the one he killed.That made it murder, it seemed to me, not war.How many men to make a war?Enough, perhaps, so they didnt really have to see each other?And yet this plainly was waror serious business at leastto Dougal, Jamie, Rupert, and Ned.Even little rat faced Murtagh had a reason for violence beyond his natural inclinations.And what about those reasons?One king rather than another?Hanovers and Stuarts?To me, these were still no more than names on a chart on the schoolroom wall.What were they, compared with an unthinkable evil like Hitlers Reich?It made a difference to those who lived under the kings, I supposed, though the differences might seem trivial to me.Still, when had the right to live as one wished ever been considered trivial?Was a struggle to choose ones own destiny less worthwhile than the necessity to stop a great evil?I shifted irritably, gingerly rubbing my sore bottom.I glared at Jamie, curled into a ball by the door.He was breathing evenly, but lightly; perhaps he couldnt sleep either.I hoped not.I had been inclined at first to take this whole remarkable misadventure as melodrama; such things just did not happen in real life.I had had many shocks since I stepped through the rock, but the worst to date had been this afternoon.Jack Randall, so like and so horribly unlike Frank.His touch on my breasts had suddenly forged a link between my old life and this one, bringing my separate realities together with a bang like a thunderclap.And then there was Jamie: his face, stark with fear in the window of Randalls room, contorted with rage by the roadside, tight with pain at my insults.Jamie.Jamie was real, all right, more real than anything had ever been to me, even Frank and my life in 1945.Jamie, tender lover and perfidious black guard.Perhaps that was part of the problem.Jamie filled my senses so completely that his surroundings seemed almost irrelevant.But I could no longer afford to ignore them.My recklessness had almost killed him this afternoon, and my stomach turned over at the thought of losing him.I sat up suddenly, intending to go and wake him to tell him to come to bed with me.As my weight fell full on the results of his handiwork, I just as suddenly changed my mind and flounced angrily back onto my stomach.A night spent thus torn between fits of rage and philosophy had left me worn out.I slept all afternoon, and stumbled blearily down for a light supper when Rupert roused me just before dark.Dougal, no doubt writhing at the expense, had procured another horse for me.A sound beast, if inelegantly built, with a kindly eye and a short, bristly mane; at once I named it Thistle.I had not reckoned on the effects of a long horseback ride following a severe beating.I eyed Thistles hard saddle dubiously, suddenly realizing what I was in for.A thick cloak plopped across the saddle, and Murtaghs shiny black rat eye winked conspiratorially at me from the opposite side.I determined that I would at least suffer in dignified silence, and grimly set my jaw as I hoisted myself into the saddle.There seemed to be an unspoken conspiracy of gallantry among the men; they took turns stopping at frequent intervals to relieve themselves, allowing me to dismount for a few minutes and surreptitiously rub my aching fundament.Now and again, one would suggest stopping for a drink, which necessitated my stopping as well, since Thistle carried the water bottles.We jolted along for a couple of hours in this manner, but the pain grew steadily worse, keeping me shifting in the saddle incessantly.Finally I decided to hell with dignified suffering, I simply must get off for a while.Whoa!I said to Thistle, and swung down.I pretended to examine her front left foot, as the other horses came to a milling stop around us.Im afraid shes had a stone in her shoe, I lied.Ive got it out, but Id better walk her a bit; dont want her to go lame.No, we cant have that, said Dougal.All right, walk for a bit, then, but someone must stay wi ye.Tis a quiet enough road, but I canna have ye walkin alone.Jamie immediately swung down.Ill walk with her, he said quietly.Good.Dinna tarry too long; we must be in Bargrennan before dawn.The sign of the Red Boar; landlords a friend.With a wave, he gathered the others and they set off at a brisk trot, leaving us, in the dust.* * *    Several hours of torture by saddle had not improved my temper.Let him walk with me.I was damned if Id speak to him, the sadistic, violent brute.He didnt look particularly brutish in the light of the half moon rising, but I hardened my heart and limped along, carefully not looking at him.My abused muscles at first protested the unaccustomed exercise, but after a half hour or so I began to move much more easily.Youll feel much better by tomorrow, Jamie observed casually.Though you wont sit easy til the next day.And what makes you such an expert?I flared at him.Do you beat people all that frequently?Well, no, he said, undisturbed by my attitude.This is the first time Ive tried it.Ive considerable experience on the other end, though.You?I gaped at him.The thought of anyone taking a strap to this towering mass of muscle and sinew was completely untenable.He laughed at my expression.When I was a bit smaller, Sassenach.Ive had my backside leathered more times than I could count, between the ages of eight and thirteen.Thats when I got taller than my father, and it got unhandy for him to bend me over a fence rail.Your father beat you?Aye, mostly.The schoolmaster, too, of course, and Dougal or one of the other uncles now and then, depending on where I was and what Id been doing.I was growing interested, in spite of my determination to ignore him.What did you do?He laughed again, a quiet but infectious sound in the still night air.Well, I canna remember everything.I will say I generally deserved it.I dont think my Da ever beat me unfairly, at least.He paced without speaking for a minute, thinking.Mm.Lets see, there was once for stoning the chickens, and once for riding the cows and getting them too excited for milking, and then for eating all of the jam out of the cakes and leaving the cakes behind.Ah, and letting the horses out of the barn by leaving the gate unlatched, and setting the thatch of the dovecote on firethat was an accident, I didna do it on purposeand losing my schoolbooksI did do that on purposeand He broke off, shrugging, as I laughed despite myself.The usual sorts of things.Most often, though, it was for opening my mouth when I should ha kept it closed.He snorted at some memory.Once my sister Jenny broke a pitcher; I made her angry, teasing, and she lost her temper and threw it at me.When my Da came in and demanded to know whod done it, she was too scared to speak up, and she just looked at me, with her eyes all wide and frightenedshes got blue eyes, like mine, but prettier, wi black lashes all around.Jamie shrugged again.Anyway, I told my father Id done it.That was very noble of you, I said, sarcastically.Your sister must have been grateful.Aye, well, she might have been.Only my fatherd been on, the other side of the open door all along, and hed seen what really happened.So she got whipped for losing her temper and breaking the pitcher, and I got whipped twice; once for teasing her and again for lying.Thats not fair!I said indignantly.My father wasna always gentle, but he was usually fair, Jamie said imperturbably.He said the truth is the truth, and people should take responsibility for their own actions, which is right.He shot me a sidelong glance.But he said it was good hearted of me to take the blame, so while hed have to punish me, I could take my choice between being thrashed or going to bed without my supper.He laughed ruefully, shaking his head.Father knew me pretty well.I took the thrashing with no questions.Youre nothing but a walking appetite, Jamie, I said.Aye, he agreed without rancor, always have been.You too, glutton, he said to his mount.Wait a bit, til we stop for a rest.He twitched the rein, pulling his horses questing nose from the tempting tufts of grass along the roadside.Aye, Father was fair, he went on, and considerate about it, though I certainly didna appreciate that at the time.He wouldnt make me wait for a beating; if I did something wrong, I got punished at onceor as soon as he found out about it.He always made sure I knew what I was about to get walloped for, and if I wanted to argue my side of it, I could.Oh, so thats what youre up to, I thought.You disarming schemer.I doubted he could charm me out of my set intention of disemboweling him at the first opportunity, but he was welcome to try.Did you ever win an argument?I asked.No.It was generally a straightforward enough case, with the accused convicted out of his own mouth.But sometimes I got the sentence reduced a bit.He rubbed his nose.Once I told him I thought beating your son was a most uncivilized method of getting your own way.He said Id about as much sense as the post I was standing next to, if as much.He said respect for your elders was one of the cornerstones of civilized behavior, and until I learned that, Id better get used to looking at my toes while one of my barbaric elders thrashed my arse off.This time I laughed along with him.It was peaceful on the road, with that sort of absolute quiet that comes when you are miles from any other person.The sort of quiet so hard to come by in my own more crowded time, when machines spread the influence of man, so that a single person could make as much noise as a crowd.The only sounds here were the stirrings of plants, the occasional skreek of a nightbird, and the soft thudding steps of the horses.I was walking a little easier now, as my cramped muscles began to stretch freely with the exercise.My prickly feelings began to relax a little, too, listening to Jamies stories, all humorous and self deprecating.I didna like being beaten at all, of course, but if I had a choice, Id rather my Da than the schoolmaster.Wed mostly get it across the palm of the hand with a tawse, in the schoolhouse, instead of on the backside.Father said if he whipped me on the hand, Id not be able to do any work, whereas if he whipped my arse, Id at least not be tempted to sit down and be idle.We had a different schoolmaster each year, usually; they didna last longusually turned farmer or moved on to richer parts.Schoolmasters are paid so little, theyre always skinny and starving.Had a fat one once, and I could never believe he was a real schoolmaster; he looked like a parson in disguise.I thought of plump little Father Bain and smiled in agreement.One I remember especially, because hed make ye stand out in the front of the schoolroom with your hand out, and then hed lecture ye at great length about your faults before he started, and again in between strokes.Id stand there wi my hand out, smarting, just praying hed stop yammering and get on with the job before I lost all my courage and started crying.I imagine thats what he wanted you to do, I said, feeling some sympathy in spite of myself.Oh, aye, he replied matter of factly.It took some time for me to realize that, though.And once I did, as usual I couldna keep my mouth shut.He sighed.What happened?I had all but forgotten to be furious by this time.Well, he had me up one dayI got it a lot because I couldna write properly with my right hand, kept doing it with my left.Hed smacked me three timestakin nearly five minutes to do it, the bastardand he was goin on at me for being a stupid, idle, stubborn young lout before givin me the next.My hand burned something fierce, because it was the second time that day, and I was scared because I knew Id get an awful thrashing when I got homethat was the rule; if I got a beating at school, Id get another directly I came home, for my father thought schooling importantanyway, I lost my temper.His left hand curled involuntarily around the rein, as though protecting the sensitive palm.He paused and glanced at me.I seldom lose my temper, Sassenach, and generally regret it when I do.And that, I thought, was likely to be as close to an apology as Id get.Did you regret it that time?Well, I doubled up my fists and glared up at himhe was a tall, scrawny fellow, maybe twenty, I suppose, though he looked quite old to meand I said Im not afraid o you, and ye cant make me cry, no matter how hard you hit me!He drew a deep breath and blew it out slowly.I suppose it was a bit of a mistake in judgment to tell him that while he was still holding the strap.Dont tell me, I said.He tried to prove you were wrong?Oh, aye, he tried.Jamie nodded, head dark against the cloud lit sky.His voice held a certain grim satisfaction on the word tried.He didnt succeed, then?The shaggy head shook back and forth.No.At least he couldna make me cry.He surely made me regret not keeping quiet, though.He paused for a moment, turning his own face toward me.The cloud cover had parted for a moment and the light touched the edges of jaw and cheek, making him look gilded, like one of Donatellos archangels.When Dougal was describing my character to ye, before we wed, did he by chance mention that Im sometimes a bit stubborn?The slanted eyes glinted, much more Lucifer than Michael.I laughed.Thats putting it mildly.As I recall, what he said is that all the Frasers are stubborn as rocks, and youre the worst of the lot.Actually, I said, a little dryly, Id noticed something of the kind myself.He smiled as he reined the horse around a deep puddle in the road, leading mine by the checkrein after him.Mmph, well, Ill no just say Dougals wrong, he said, once the hazard had been negotiated.But if Im stubborn, I come by it honest.My father was just the same, and wed get in wrangles from time to time that we couldna get out of without the application of force, usually wi me bent over the fence rail.Suddenly, he put out a hand to grab my horses rein, as the beast reared and snorted.Hey now!Hush!Stad, mo dhu!His own, less spooked, only jerked and tossed its head nervously.What is it?I could see nothing, despite the patches of moonlight that mottled road and field.There was a pine grove up ahead, and the horses seemed disinclined to go any nearer to it.I dont know.Stay here and keep quiet.Mount your horse and hold mine.If I call to ye, drop the checkrein and run for it.Jamies voice was low and casual, calming me as well as the horses.With a muttered Sguir!to the horse and a slap on the neck to urge it closer to me, he faded into the heather, hand on his dirk.I strained eyes and ears to discern whatever it was still troubling the horses; they shifted and stamped, ears and tails twitching in agitation.The clouds by now had shredded and flown on the nightwind, leaving only scattered trails across the face of a brilliant half moon.In spite of the brightness, I could see nothing on the road ahead, or in the menacing grove.It seemed a late hour and an unprofitable road for highwaymen, scarce as these were anywhere in the Highlands; there were too few travelers to make an ambush worthwhile.The grove was dark, but not still.The pines roared softly to themselves, millions of needles scouring in the wind.Very ancient trees, pines, and eerie in the gloom.Gymnosperms, cone bearers, winged seed scatterers, older and sterner by far than the soft leaved, frail limbed oaks and aspens.A suitable home for Ruperts ghosts and evil spirits.Only you, I thought crossly to myself, could work yourself up into being afraid of a lot of trees.Where was Jamie, though?The hand gripping my thigh made me squeak like a startled bat; a natural consequence of trying to scream with your heart in your mouth.With the unreasonable fury of the irrationally afraid, I struck out at him, kicking him in the chest.Dont sneak up on me like that!Hush, he said, come with me.Tugging me unceremoniously from the saddle, he swung me down and hastily tethered the horses, who whickered uneasily after us as he led me into the tall grass.What is it?I hissed, stumbling blindly over roots and rocks.Quiet.Dont speak.Look down and watch my feet.Step where I step, and stop when I touch you.Slowly and more or less silently, we made our way into the edges of the pine grove.It was dark under the trees, with only crumbs of light falling through to the needle litter underfoot.Even Jamie couldnt walk silently on that, but the rustle of dry needles was lost in that of the green ones overhead.There was a rift in the litter, a mass of granite rising from the forest floor.Here Jamie put me in front of him, guiding my hands and feet to climb the sloping crumble of the mound.At the top, there was enough room to lie belly flat, side by side.Jamie put his mouth next to my ear, barely breathing.Thirty feet ahead, to the right.In the clearing.See them?Once I saw them, I could hear as well.Wolves, a small pack, eight or ten animals, perhaps.No howling, not these.The kill lay in the shadow, a blob of dark with an upthrust leg, stick thin and vibrating under the impact of teeth yanking at the carcass.There was only the occasional soft growl and yip as a cub was batted away from an adults morsel, and the contented sounds of feeding, crunching, and the crack of a bone.As my eyes grew more accustomed to the moon flecked scene, I could pick out several shaggy forms stretched under the trees, glutted and peaceful.Bits of grey fur shone here and there, as those still at the carcass pushed and rooted for tender bits overlooked by the earlier diners.A broad, yellow eyed head thrust suddenly up into a blotch of light, ears pricked.The wolf made a soft, urgent noise, something between a whine and a growl, and there was a sudden stillness under the trees below.The saffron eyes seemed fixed on my own.There was no fear in the animals posture, nor curiosity, only a wary acknowledgment.Jamies hand on my back warned me not to move, though I felt no desire to run.I could have stayed locked in the wolfs eyes for hours, I think, but sheI was sure it was a female, though I didnt know how I knewflicked her ears once, as though dismissing me, and bent once more to her meal.We watched them for a few minutes, peaceful in the scattered light.At last, Jamie signaled that it was time to go, with a touch on my arm.He kept the hand on my arm to support me as we made our way back through the trees to the road.It was the first time I had willingly allowed him to touch me since he had rescued me from Fort William.Still charmed by the sight of the wolves, we did not speak much, but began to feel comfortable with each other again.As we walked, considering the stories he had told me, I couldnt help but admire the job he had done.Without one word of direct explanation or apology, he had given me the message he intended.I gave you justice, it said, as I was taught it.And I gave you mercy, too, so far as I could.While I could not spare you pain and humiliation, I make you a gift of my own pains and humiliations, that yours might be easier to bear.Did you mind a lot?I said abruptly.Being beaten, I mean.Did you get over it easily?He squeezed my hand lightly before letting it go.Mostly I forgot it as soon as it was over.Except for the last time; that took awhile.Why?Ah, well.I was sixteen, for one thing, and a man grownI thought.For another, it hurt like hell.You dont have to tell me about it if you dont want to, I said, sensing his hesitation.Is it a painful story?Not nearly as painful as the beating, he said, laughing.No, I dont mind tellin ye.Its a long story, is all.Its a long way to Bargrennan yet.So it is.Well, then.You recall I told ye I spent a year at Castle Leoch when I was sixteen?It was an agreement between Colum and my fatherso Id be familiar wi my mothers clan.I fostered wi Dougal for two years, and then went to the Castle for a year, to learn manners, and Latin and such.Oh.I wondered how youd come to be there.Aye, that was the way of it.I was big for my age, or tall at least; a good swordsman even then, and a better horseman than most.Modest, too, I said.Not very.Cocky as hell, and even faster with my tongue than I am now.The mind boggles, I said, amused.Well it might, Sassenach.I found I could make people laugh wi my remarks, and I made them more frequent, without carin much what I said, or to whom.I was cruel sometimes, to the other lads, not meanin it, just not able to resist if I thought of something clever to say.He looked up at the sky, to gauge the time.Blacker still, now that the moon had gone down.I recognized Orion floating near the horizon, and was strangely comforted by the familiar sight.So, one day I went too far.I was with a couple of the other lads, going down a corridor when I saw Mistress FitzGibbons at the other end.She was carryin a big basket, near as big as she was, and bumping to and fro as she walked.You know what she looks like now; she wasna much smaller then.He rubbed his nose, embarrassed.Well, I made a number of ungallant remarks concerning her appearance.Funny, but most ungallant.They amused my companions considerably.I didna realize she could hear me as well.I recalled the massive dame of Castle Leoch.While I had never seen her other than good humored, she did not appear to be the sort of person to be insulted with impunity.What did she do?Nothingthen.I didna know shed heard, until she got up at the Hall gathering next day and told Colum all about it.Oh, dear.I knew how highly Colum regarded Mrs.Fitz, and didnt think he would take any irreverence directed at her lightly.What happened?The same thing that happened to Laoghaireor almost.He chuckled.I got verra bold though, and I stood up and said I chose to take my beating wi fists.I was tryin to be verra calm and grown up about it all, though my heart was going like a blacksmiths hammer, and I felt a bit sick when I looked at Anguss hands; they looked like stones, and big ones at that.There were a few laughs from the folk gathered in the Hall; I wasna so tall then as I am now, and I weighed less than half as much.Wee Angus could ha torn my head off with one blow.Anyway, Colum and Dougal both frowned at me, though I thought they were really a bit pleased Id had the nerve to ask it.Then Colum said no, if I was goin to behave like a child, Id to be punished like one.He gave a nod, and before I could move, Angus bent me across his knee, turned up the edge of my kilt and blistered me with his strap, in front of the entire Hall.Oh, Jamie!Mmmphm.Youll have noticed Angus is verra professional about his work?He gave me fifteen strokes, and to this day I could tell ye exactly where each one landed.He shuddered reminiscently.I had the marks for a week.He reached out and broke a clump of pine needles from the nearest tree, spreading them like a fan between thumb and fingers.The scent of turpentine was suddenly sharper.Well, I wasna allowed just to go quietly away and tend to my wounds, either.When Angus finished wi me, Dougal took me by the scruff of the neck and marched me to the far end of the Hall.Then I was made to come all the way back on my knees, across the stones.I had to kneel before Colums seat and beg Mrs.Fitzs pardon, then Colums, then apologize to everyone in the Hall for my rudeness, and finally, Id to thank Angus for the strapping.I nearly choked over that, but he was verra gracious about it; he reached down and gave me a hand to get up.Then I was plunked down on a stool next to Colum, and bid to sit there til Hall was ended.He hunched his shoulders protectively.That was the worst hour I ever had.My face was on fire, and so was my arse, my knees were skinned and I couldna look anywhere but at my feet, but the worst of it was that I had to piss something awful.I almost died; Id ha burst before I wet myself in front of everyone on top of it all, but it was a near thing.I sweated right through my shirt.I suppressed my urge to laugh.Couldnt you have told Colum what was the matter?I asked.He knew perfectly well what was the matter; so did everyone else in the Hall, the way I was squirming on that stool.People were making wagers as to whether Id last or not.He shrugged.Colum would, have let me go, if Id asked.Butwell, I got stubborn about it.He grinned a bit sheepishly, teeth white in a dark face.Thought Id rather die than ask, and nearly did.When at last Colum said I could go, I made it out of the Hall, but only as far as the nearest door.Threw myself behind the wall and spurted streams; I thought Id never stop.So, he spread his hands deprecatingly, dropping the clump of pine needles, now you know the worst thing that ever happened to me.I couldnt help it; I laughed until I had to sit down at the side of the road.Jamie waited patiently for a minute, then sank down on his knees.What are you laughing for?he demanded.It wasna funny at all.But he was smiling himself.I shook my head, still laughing.No, it isnt.Its an awful story.Its justI can see you sitting there, being stubborn about it, with your jaw clenched and steam coming out of your ears.Jamie snorted, but laughed a little too.Aye.Its no verra easy to be sixteen, is it?So you did help that girl Laoghaire because you felt sorry for her, I said, when I had recovered my composure.You knew what it was like.He was surprised.Aye, I said so.Its a lot easier to get punched in the face at three and twenty than to have your bum strapped in public at sixteen.Bruised pride hurts worse than anything, and it bruises easy then.I wondered.Id never seen anyone grin in anticipation of being punched in the mouth.Couldna very well do it afterward.Mmh.I nodded agreement.I thought I said, then stopped in embarrassment.Ye thought what?Oh, about me and Laoghaire, ye mean, he said, divining my thought.You and Alec and everyone else, including Laoghaire.Id have done the same if shed been plain.He nudged me in the ribs.Though I dinna expect youll believe that.Well, I did see you together that day in the alcove, I defended myself, and somebody certainly taught you how to kiss.Jamie shuffled his feet in the dust, embarrassed.He ducked his head shyly.Well now, Sassenach, Im no better than most men.Sometimes I try, but I dinna always manage.Ye know that bit in St.Paul, where he says tis better to marry than burn?Well, I was burnin quite badly there.I laughed again, feeling light hearted as a sixteen year old myself.So you married me, I teased, to avoid the occasion of sin?Aye.Thats what marriage is good for; it makes a sacrament out of things yed otherwise have to confess.I collapsed again.Oh, Jamie, I do love you!This time it was his turn to laugh.He doubled over, then sat down at the roadside, fizzing with mirth.He slowly fell over backward and lay in the long grass, wheezing and choking.What on earth is the matter with you?I demanded, staring at him.At long last, he sat up, wiping his streaming eyes.He shook his head, gasping.Murtagh was right about women.Sassenach, I risked my life for ye, committing theft, arson, assault, and murder into the bargain.In return for which ye call me names, insult my manhood, kick me in the ballocks and claw my face.Then I beat you half to death and tell ye all the most humiliating things have ever happened to me, and you say ye love me.He laid his head on his knees and laughed some more.Finally he rose and held out a hand to me, wiping his eyes with the other.Youre no verra sensible, Sassenach, but I like ye fine.Lets go.* * *    It was getting lateor early, depending on your viewpoint, and it was necessary to ride, if we were to make Bargrennan by dawn.I was enough recovered by this time to bear sitting, though the effects were still noticeable.We rode in a companionable silence for some way.Left to my own thoughts, I considered for the first time at leisure what would happen if and when I ever managed to find my way back to the circle of standing stones.Married to him by coercion and dependent on him from necessity, I had undeniably grown very fond of Jamie.More to the point, perhaps, were his feelings about me.Linked at first by circumstance, then by friendship, and finally by a startlingly deep bodily passion, still he had never made even a casual statement to me about his feelings.And yet.He had risked his life for me.That much he might do for the sake of his marriage vow; he would, he said, protect me to the last drop of his blood, and I believed he meant it.I was more touched by the events of the last twenty four hours, when he had suddenly admitted me to his emotions and his personal life, warts and all.If he felt as much for me as I thought perhaps he did, what would he feel if I suddenly disappeared?The remnants of physical discomfort receded as I grappled with these uncomfortable thoughts.We were within three miles of Bargrennan when Jamie suddenly broke the silence.I havena told you how my father died, he said abruptly.Dougal said he had a strokean apoplexy, I mean, I said, startled.I supposed that Jamie, alone with his thoughts as well, had found them dwelling on his father as a result of our earlier conversation, but I could not imagine what led him to this particular subject.Thats right.But ithe He paused, considering his words, then shrugged, abandoning carefulness.He drew a deep breath and let it out.You should know about it.Its to do withthings.The road here was wide enough to ride easily abreast, provided only that we kept a sharp eye out for protruding rocks; my excuse to Dougal about my horse had not been chosen at random.It was at the Fort, Jamie said, picking his way around a bad patch, where we were yesterday.Where Randall and his men took me from Lallybroch.Where they flogged me.Two days after the first time, Randall summoned me to his officetwo soldiers came for me, and took me from the cells up to his roomthe same where I found you; its how I knew where to go.Just outside, we met my father in the courtyard.Hed found out where theyd taken me, and come to see if he could get me out some wayor at least to see for himself that I was all right.Jamie kicked a heel gently into his horses ribs, urging it on with a soft click of his tongue.There was no trace of daylight yet, but the look of the night had changed.Dawn could be no more than an hour away.I hadna realized until I saw him just how alone Id felt thereor how scairt.The soldiers would not give us any time alone together, but at least they let me greet him.He swallowed and went on.I told him I was sorryabout Jenny, I meant, and the whole sorry mess.He told me to hush, though, and hugged me tight to him.He asked me was I hurt badlyhe knew about the floggingand I said Id be all right.The soldiers said I must go then, so he squeezed my arms tight, and told me to remember to pray.He said he would stand by me, no matter what happened, and I must just keep my head up and try not to worrit myself.He kissed my cheek and the soldiers took me away.That was the last time I ever saw him.His voice was steady, but a little thick.My own throat felt tight, and I would have touched him if I could, but the road narrowed through a small glen and I was forced to fall back behind him for a moment.By the time I came alongside again he had composed himself.So, he said, taking a deep breath, I went in to see Captain Randall.He sent the soldiers out, so we were alone, and offered me a stool.He said my father had offered security for my bond, to have me released, but that my charge was a serious one, and I could not be bonded without a written clearance signed by the Duke of Argyll, whose boundaries we were under.I reckoned that was where my father was headed, then, to see Argyll.In the meantime, Randall went on, there was the matter of this second flogging I was sentenced to.He stopped a minute, as though uncertain how to go on.Hewas strange in his manner, I thought.Verra cordial, but with something under it I didna understand.He kept watching me, as though he expected me to do something, though I was just sitting still.He half apologized to me, saying he was sorry that our relations had been so difficult to the present, and that he wished the circumstances had been different, and so on.Jamie shook his head.I couldna imagine what he was talking about; two days earlier, hed been trying his best to beat me to death.When he finally got down to it, though, he was blunt enough.What did he want, then?I asked.Jamie glanced at me, then away.The dark hid his features, but I thought he seemed embarrassed.Me, he said baldly.I started so violently that the horse tossed its head and whickered reproachfully.Jamie shrugged again.He was quite plain about it.If I wouldah, make him free of my body, hed cancel the second flogging.If I would notthen Id wish Id never been born, he said.I felt quite sick.I was already wishing something of the sort, he said, with a glint of humor.My belly felt as though Id swallowed broken glass, and if I hadna been sitting, my knees would have knocked together.But what My voice was hoarse, and I cleared my throat and started over.But what did you do?He sighed.Well, Ill no lie to ye, Sassenach.I considered it.The first stripes were still so raw on my back I could scarce bear a shirt, and I felt giddy whenever I stood up.The thought of going through that againbeing bound and helpless, waiting for the next lash He shuddered involuntarily.Id no real idea, he said wryly, but I rather thought being buggered would be at least a bit less painful.Men have died under the lash sometimes, Sassenach, and from the look on his face, I thought he meant me to be one of them, were that my choice.He sighed again.Butwell, I could still feel my fathers kiss on my cheek, and thought of what hed say, andwell, I couldna do it, thats all.I did not stop to think what my death might mean to my father.He snorted, as though finding something faintly amusing.Then, too, I thought, the mans already raped my sisterdamned if hell have me too.I didnt find this amusing.I was seeing Jack Randall again, in a new and revolting light.Jamie rubbed the back of his neck, then dropped his hand to the pommel.So, I took what little courage I had left by then, and said no.I said it loud, too, and added whatever filthy names I could think of to call him, all at the top of my lungs.He grimaced.I was afraid Id change my mind if I thought about it; I wanted to make sure there was no chance of going back.Though I dinna suppose, he added thoughtfully, that theres any really tactful way to refuse an offer like that.No, I agreed dryly.I dont suppose hed have been pleased, no matter what you said.He wasnt.He backhanded me across the mouth, to shut me up.I fell downI was still a bit weakand he stood over me, just staring down at me.Id better sense than to try and get up, so I just lay there until he called the soldiers to take me back to my cell.He shook his head.He didna change expression at all; just said as I left, Ill see you on Friday, as though we had an appointment to discuss business or somesuch.The soldiers had not returned Jamie to the cell he had shared with three other prisoners.Instead, he was put into a small room by himself, to await Fridays reckoning with no distractions save the daily visit of the garrisons physician, who came to dress his back.He wasna much of a doctor, Jamie said, but he was kindly enough.The second day he came, along wi the goose grease and charcoal, he brought me a small Bible that belonged to a prisoner whod died.Said he understood I was a Papist, and whether I found the word of God any comfort or not, at least I could compare my troubles with Jobs.He laughed.Oddly enough, it was some comfort.Our Lord had to put up wi being scourged too; and I could reflect that at least I wasna going to be hauled out and crucified afterward.On the other hand, he said judiciously, Our Lord wasna forced to listen to indecent proposals from Pontius Pilate, either.Jamie had kept the small Bible.He rummaged in his saddlebag, and handed it across now for me to look at.It was a worn, leather covered volume, about five inches long, printed on paper so flimsy the print showed through from one side of each page to the other.On the flyleaf was written ALEXANDER WILLIAM RODERICK MACGREGOR, 1733.The ink was faded and blurred, and the covers warped as though the book had gotten wet on more than one occasion.I turned the little book over curiously.Small as it was, it must have cost something in effort to keep it by him, through the travels and adventures of the last four years.Ive never seen you read it, I handed it back.No, thats not why I keep it, he said.He tucked it away, stroking the edge of the worn cover with a thumb as he did so.He patted the saddlebag absently.Theres a debt owing to Alex MacGregor; I mean to collect it sometime.Anyway, he continued, returning to his story, Friday came at last, and I dont know whether I was glad or sorry to see it.The waiting and the fear were almost worse than I thought the pain would be.When it came, though He made that odd half shrugging gesture of his, easing the shirt across his back.Well, youve seen the marks.You know what it was like.Only because Dougal told me.He said he was there.Jamie nodded.Aye, he was there.And my father as well, though I didna know it at the time.Id no mind for anything much beyond my own problems, then.Oh, I said slowly, and your father  Mmm.Thats when it happened.Some of the men there told me after that they thought I was dead, halfway through, and I reckon my father thought so too.He hesitated, and his voice was thick when he resumed.When I fell, Dougal told me, my father made a small sound and put his hand to his head.Then he dropped like a rock.And did not get up again.The birds were moving in the heather, trilling and calling from the still dark leaves of the trees.Jamies head was bowed, face still invisible.I did not know he was dead, he said softly.They didna tell me until a month laterwhen they thought I was strong enough to bear it.So I did not bury him, as his son should have done.And I have never seen his gravebecause I am afraid to go home.Jamie, I said.Oh, Jamie, dear.After what seemed a long silence, I said, But you dontyou cantfeel responsible.Jamie, there was nothing you could have done; or done differently.No?he said.No, maybe not; though I wonder would it still have happened, had I chosen the other way.But to know that does not much help the way I feeland I feel as though I had done him to death with my own hands.Jamie I said again, and stopped, helpless.He rode silently for a bit, then straightened up and squared his shoulders once more.Ive not told anyone about it, he said abruptly.But I thought that now ye should knowabout Randall, I mean.Youve a right to know what it is that lies between him and me.What it is that lies between him and me.The life of a good man, the honor of a girl, and an indecent lust that found its vent in blood and fear.And, I supposed, with a lurch of the stomach, that there was now one more item weighting the scales.Me.For the first time, I began to realize what Jamie had felt, crouching in the window of Randalls room, with an empty gun in his hand.And I began to forgive him for what he had done to me.As though reading my mind, he said, not looking at me, Do you knowI mean, can ye understand, maybe, why I thought it needful to beat you?I waited a moment before answering.I understood, all right, but that was not quite all there was to it.I understand, I said.And so far as that goes, I forgive you.What I cant forgive, I said, my voice rising slightly in spite of myself, is that you enjoyed it!He bent forward in the saddle, clasping the pommel, and laughed for a long time.He reveled in the release of tension before finally tossing his head back and turning to me.The sky was noticeably lighter now, and I could see his face, lined with exhaustion, strain, and mirth.The scratches down his cheek were black in the dim light.Enjoyed it!Sassenach, he said, gasping, you dont know just how much I enjoyed it.You were soGod, you looked lovely.I was so angry, and you fought me so fierce.I hated to hurt you, but I wanted to do it at the same timeJesus, he said, breaking off and wiping his nose, yes.Yes, I did enjoy it.Though come to that, he said, you might give me some credit for exercising restraint.I was getting rather angry again.I could feel my cheeks flushing hotly against the cool dawn air.Restraint, was it?I was under the impression that what you were exercising was your good left arm.You almost crippled me, you arrogant Scottish bastard!Did I want to cripple ye, Sassenach, youd know it, he answered dryly.I meant afterward.I slept on the floor, if ye recall.I eyed him narrowly, breathing through my nose.Oh, so that was restraint, was it?Well, I didna think it right to roger you in that state, however fierce I wanted to.And I did want to, he added, laughing again.Terrible strain on my natural instincts.Roger me?I said, diverted by the expression.I would hardly call it love making under the circumstances, would you?Whatever you might call it, I said evenly, its a good thing you didnt try it, or youd now be missing a few valued bits of your anatomy.That thought occurred to me.And if you think you deserve applause for nobly refraining from committing rape on top of assault I choked on my choler.We rode a half mile or so in silence.Then he heaved a sigh.I can see I should not have started this conversation.What I was tryin to do was to work up to asking ye would you allow me to share your bed again, once we get to Bargrennan.He paused shyly.Its a bit cold on the floor.I rode for a good five minutes before answering.When I had decided what to say, I reined in, turning across the road, so as to force Jamie to stop as well.Bargrennan was in sight, rooftops just visible in the dawning light.I urged my horse parallel with the other, so that I was no more than a foot away from Jamie.I looked him in the eye for a minute before speaking.Will you do me the honor of sharing my bed, O lord and master?I asked politely.Obviously suspecting something, he considered a moment, then nodded, just as formally.I will.Thank you.He was raising the reins to go when I stopped him.Theres just one more thing, master, I said, still polite.Aye?I whipped my hand from the concealed pocket in my skirt, and the dawn light struck sparks from the blade of the dagger pressed against his chest.If, I said through my teeth, you ever raise a hand to me again, James Fraser, Ill cut out your heart and fry it for breakfast!There was a long silence, broken only by the shiftings and creakings of horses and harness.Then he held out his hand, palm up.Give it to me.When I hesitated, he said impatiently, Im no going to use it on ye.Give it to me!He held the dirk by the blade, upright so that the rising sun caught the moonstone in the hilt and made it glow.Holding the dagger like a crucifix, he recited something in Gaelic.I recognized it from the oath taking ceremony in Colums hall, but he followed it with the English translation for my benefit:  I swear on the cross of my Lord Jesus, and by the holy iron which I hold, that I give ye my fealty and pledge ye my loyalty.If ever my hand is raised against you in rebellion or in anger, then I ask that this holy iron may pierce my heart.He kissed the dirk at the juncture of haft and tang, and handed it back to me.I dont make idle threats, Sassenach, he said, raising one brow, and I dont take frivolous vows.Now, can we go to bed?23    RETURN TO LEOCH    Dougal was waiting for us at the sign of the Red Boar, impatiently pacing to and fro outside.Made it, did ye?he asked, watching with approval as I dismounted without assistance, staggering only slightly.Gallant lassten miles without a whimper.Get up to your bed then; yeve earned it.Jamie and I will stable the horses.He patted me, very gently, on the rump in dismissal.I was only too glad to follow his suggestion, and was asleep almost before my head touched the pillow.I didnt stir when Jamie crawled in beside me, but woke suddenly in the late afternoon, convinced that there was something important I had forgotten.Horrocks!I exclaimed suddenly, sitting bolt upright in bed.Hah?Jamie, startled out of a sound sleep, shot sideways out of bed, ending on the floor in a crouch, hand on the dirk he had left on top of his piled clothes.What?he demanded, staring wildly around the room.What is it?I stifled a giggle at the sight of him, crouched naked on the floor, red hair standing on end like quills.You look like a fretful porpentine, I said.He gave me a dirty look and rose to his feet, replacing the dirk on the stool that held his clothes.You couldna wait til I woke to tell me that?he inquired.You thought it would make more impression if ye woke me out of a sound sleep by shouting Hedgehog!in my ear?Not hedgehog,  I explained.Horrocks.I remembered all at once that Id forgotten to ask you about him.Did you find him?He sat down on the bed and sank his head in his hands.He rubbed his face vigorously, as though to restore circulation.Oh, aye, he said through the muffling fingers.Aye, I found him.I could tell from the tone of voice that the deserters information had not been good.Would he not tell you anything after all?I asked sympathetically.That had always been a possibility, though Jamie had gone prepared to part with not only his own money, and some provided by Dougal and Colum, but even his fathers ring if necessary.Jamie lay back on the bed beside me, staring up at the ceiling.No, he said.No, he told me all right.And at a reasonable price.I rolled up onto an elbow in order to look down at his face.Well, then?I demanded.Who did shoot the sergeant major?He looked up at me and smiled, a trifle grimly.Randall, he said, and shut his eyes.Randall?I said blankly.But why?I dont know, he said, eyes still shut.I could guess, perhaps, but it doesna much matter.Damn all chance of proving it.I had to agree that this was true.I sank back on the bed beside him and stared up at the black oak beams of the low ceiling.What can you do then?I asked.Go to France?Or perhapsa bright thought occurred to meperhaps to America?You could likely do well in the New World.Across the ocean?A brief shudder ran through him.No.No, I couldna do that.Well, what then?I demanded, turning my head to look at him.He opened one eye enough to give me a jaundiced look.Id thought for a start that I might get another hours sleep, he said, but apparently not.Resigned, he pulled himself up in bed, leaning against the wall.I had been too tired to pull the bedclothes off before retiring, and there was a suspicious black spot on the quilt near his knee.I kept a wary eye on it as he talked.Youre right, he agreed, we could go to France.I started, having momentarily forgotten that whatever he decided to do, I was now included in the decision.But there isna that much for me there, he said, idly scratching his thigh.Only soldiering, and thats no life for you.Or to Rome, to join King Jamess court.That might be managed; Ive some Fraser uncles and cousins with a foot in that camp, who would help me.Ive no great taste for politics, and less for princes, but aye, its a possibility.Id rather try first to clear myself in Scotland, though.If I did, at the worst I might end up as a small crofter in the Fraser lands; at best, I might be able to go back to Lallybroch.His face clouded, and I knew he was thinking of his sister.For myself, he said softly, I wouldna go, but it isnt only me anymore.He looked down at me and smiled, his hand gently smoothing my hair.I forget sometimes, that theres you now, Sassenach, he said.I felt extraordinarily uncomfortable.I felt like a traitor, in fact.Here he was, making plans that would affect his entire life, taking my comfort and safety into account, when I had been doing my best to abandon him completely, dragging him into substantial danger in the process.I had meant none of it, but the fact remained.Even now, I was thinking that I should try to talk him out of going to France, as that would carry me farther away from my own goal: the stone circle.Is there any way to stay in Scotland, though?I asked, looking away from him.I thought the black spot on the quilt had moved, but I wasnt sure.I fixed my eyes on it, staring hard.Jamies hand traveled under my hair and began idly to fondle my neck.Aye, he said thoughtfully.There may be.Thats why Dougal waited up for me; hes had some news.Really?What sort?I turned my head to look up at him again; the movement brought my ear within reach of his fingers, and he began to stroke lightly around it, making me want to arch my neck and purr like a cat.I repressed the impulse, though, in favor of finding out what he meant to do.A messenger from Colum, he said.He didna think to find us here, but he passed Dougal on the road by accident.Dougals to return at once to Leoch, and leave Ned Gowan to manage the rest of the rents.Dougals suggested we should go with him.Back to Leoch?It wasnt France, but it wasnt a lot better.Why?Theres a visitor expected shortly, an English noble thats had dealings wi Colum before.Hes a powerful man, and it might be he could be persuaded to do something for me.Ive not been tried or condemned on the charge of murder.He might be able to have it dismissed, or arrange to have me pardoned.He grinned wryly.It goes a bit against the grain to be pardoned for something Ive not done, but its better than being hanged.Yes, thats true.The spot was moving.I squinted, trying to focus on it.Which English noble is it?The Duke of Sandringham.I jerked upright with an exclamation.What is it, Sassenach?Jamie asked, alarmed.I pointed a trembling finger at the black spot, which was now proceeding up his leg at a slow but determined pace.Whats that?!I said.He glanced at it, and casually flicked it off with a fingernail.Oh, that?Its only a bedbug, Sassenach.Nothing to  He was interrupted by my abrupt exit.At the word bedbug, I had shot out from under the covers, and stood pressed against the wall, as far away as possible from the teeming nest of vermin I now envisioned as our bed.Jamie eyed me appreciatively.Fretful porpentine, was it?he asked.He tilted his head, examining me inquisitively.Mmm, he said, running a hand over his head to smooth down his own hair.Fretful, at least.Youre a fuzzy wee thing when ye wake, to be sure.He rolled over toward me, reaching out a hand.Come here, my wee milkweed.Well not leave before sunset.If were not going to sleep  In the end, we did sleep a bit more, peacefully entangled on the floor, atop a hard but bugless bed composed of my cloak and Jamies kilt.* * *    It was a good thing that we had slept while we had the chance.Anxious to reach Castle Leoch before the Duke of Sandringham, Dougal kept to a fast pace and a grueling schedule.Traveling without the wagons, we made much better time, despite bad roads.Dougal pushed us, though, stopping only for the briefest of rests.By the time we rode once more through the gates of Leoch, we were nearly as bedraggled as the first time we had arrived there, and certainly as tired.I slid off my horse in the courtyard, then had to catch the stirrup to keep from falling.Jamie caught my elbow, then realizing that I couldnt stand, swung me up into his arms.He carried me through the archway, leaving the horses to the grooms and stableboys.Are ye hungry, Sassenach?he asked, pausing in the corridor.The kitchens lay in one direction, the stairs to the bedchambers in the other.I groaned, struggling to keep my eyes open.I was hungry, but knew I would end up facedown in the soup if I tried to eat before sleeping.There was a stir to one side and I groggily opened my eyes to see the massive form of Mrs.FitzGibbons, looming disbelievingly alongside.Why, whats the matter wi the poor child?she demanded of Jamie.Has she had an accident o some sort?No, its only shes married me, he said, though if ye care to call it an accident, ye may.He moved to one side, to push through what proved to be an increasing throng of kitchen maids, grooms, cooks, gardeners, men at arms, and assorted castle inhabitants, all inquisitively drawn to the scene by Mrs.Fitzs loud questions.Making up his mind, Jamie pressed to the right, toward the stairs, making disjointed explanations to the hail of questions from every side.Blinking owlishly against his chest, I could do no more than nod to the surrounding welcomers, though most of the faces seemed friendly as well as curious.As we came around a corner of the hallway, I saw one face that seemed a good deal friendlier than the rest.It was the girl Laoghaire, face shining and radiant as she heard Jamies voice.Her eyes grew wide and the rosebud mouth dropped unbecomingly open, though, as she saw what he carried.There was no time for her to ask questions, though, before the stir and bustle around us halted abruptly.Jamie stopped too.Raising my head, I saw Colum, whose startled face was now on a level with mine.What he began.Theyre married, said Mrs.Fitz, beaming.How sweet!You can give them your blessing, sir, while I get a room ready.She turned and made off for the stairs, leaving a substantial gap in the crowd, through which I could see the now pasty white face of the girl Laoghaire.Colum and Jamie were both talking together, questions and explanations colliding in midair.I was beginning to wake up, though it would have been overstating matters to say I was entirely myself.Well, Colum was saying, not altogether approvingly, if youre married, youre married.Ill have to talk to Dougal and Ned Gowantherell be legal matters to attend to.There are a few things youre entitled to when ye wed, by the terms of your mothers dower contract.I felt Jamie straighten slightly.Since ye mention it, he said casually, I believe thats true.And one of the things Im entitled to is a share of the quarterly rents from the MacKenzie lands.Dougals brought back what hed collected so far; perhaps youll tell him to leave aside my share when he does the reckoning?Now, if yell excuse me, Uncle, my wife is tired.And hoisting me into a more solid position, he turned to the stairs.* * *    I staggered across the room, still wobbly legged, and collapsed gratefully on the huge tester bed our newly married status apparently entitled us to.It was soft, inviting, andthanks to the ever vigilant Mrs.Fitzclean.I wondered whether it was worth the effort to get up and wash my face before succumbing to the urge to sleep.I had just about decided that I might get up for Gabriels Trump, but not much else, when I saw that Jamie, who had not only washed face and hands but combed his hair to boot, was headed toward the door.Arent you going to sleep?I called.I thought he must be at least as tired as I, if less saddle sore.In a bit, Sassenach.Ive a small errand to do, first.He went out, leaving me staring at the oaken door with a very unpleasant sensation in the pit of my stomach.I was remembering the look of gay anticipation on Laoghaires face as she came around the corner, hearing Jamies voice, and the look of angry shock that replaced it when she saw me cradled in his arms.I remembered the momentary tightening of his joints as he saw her, and wished most fervently that I had been able to see his face at that moment.I thought it likely he had gone now, unrested but washed and combed, to find the girl and break the news of his marriage.Had I seen his face, I would at least have some idea what he meant to say to her.Absorbed in the events of the last month, I had forgotten the girl entirelyand what she might mean to Jamie, or he to her.Granted, I had thought of her when the question of our abrupt marriage first occurred, and Jamie then had given no sign that she constituted an impediment so far as he was concerned.But, of course, if her father would not allow her to marry an outlawand if Jamie needed a wife, in order to collect his share of the MacKenzie rentswell, one wife would do as well as another, in that case, and doubtless he would take what he could get.I thought I knew Jamie well enough now to see that practicality with him went deepas it must, with a man who had spent the last few years of his life on the run.He would not, I thought, be swayed in his decisions by sentiment or the attraction of rose leaf cheeks and hair like liquid gold.But that didnt mean that neither sentiment nor attraction existed.There was, after all, the little scene I had witnessed in the alcove, Jamie holding the girl on his knee and kissing her ardently (Ive held women in my arms before, his voice came back to me, and theyve made my heart pound and my breath come short).I found that my hands were clenched, making bunched ridges in the green and yellow quilt.I released it and wiped my hands over my skirt, realizing in the process just how filthy they were, grimed with the dirt of two days of holding reins, with no respite in between for washing.I rose and went to the basin, forgetting my tiredness.I found, a bit to my surprise, that I strongly disliked the memory of Jamie kissing Laoghaire.I remembered what he had said about that, tooTis better to marry than burn, and I was burning badly then.I burned a bit myself, flushing strongly as I remembered the effect of Jamies kisses on my own lips.Burning, indeed.I splashed water on my face, spluttering, trying to dissipate the feeling.I had no claim on Jamies affections, I reminded myself firmly.I had married him from necessity.And he had married me for his own reasons, one of them being the frankly stated desire to alter his virginal state.Another reason apparently being that he needed a wife in order to collect his income, and could not induce a girl of his own kind to marry him.A reason much less flattering than the first, if no more lofty.Quite awake by now, I slowly changed from my stained traveling garments into a fresh shift, provided, as was the basin and ewer, by Mrs.Fitzs minions.How she had managed to make accommodation for two newlyweds in the time between Jamies abrupt announcement to Colum and the time we had mounted the stairs was one of the mysteries of the ages.Mrs.Fitz, I reflected, would have done quite well in charge of the Waldorf Astoria or the London Ritz.Such reflections made me suddenly more lonely for my own world than I had been in many days.What am I doing here?I asked myself for the thousandth time.Here, in this strange place, unreachable distances from everything familiar, from home and husband and friends, adrift and alone among what amounted to savages?I had begun to feel safe and even intermittently happy during the last weeks with Jamie.But now I realized that the happiness was likely an illusion, even if the safety was not.I had no doubt that he would abide by what he conceived to be his responsibilities, and continue to protect me from any harm that threatened.But here, returned from the dreamlike isolation of our days among the wild hills and dusty roads, the filthy inns and fragrant haystacks, he must surely feel the pull of his old associations, as I felt mine.We had grown very close in the month of our marriage, but I had felt that closeness crack under the strains of the last few days, and thought it might now shatter completely, back among the practical realities of life at Castle Leoch.I leaned my head against the stone of the window casement, looking out across the courtyard.Alec McMahon and two of his stable lads were visible at the far side, rubbing down the horses we had ridden in.The beasts, fed and watered adequately for the first time in two days, exuded contentment as willing hands curried the glossy sides and cleansed the dirt from hock and fetlock with twists of straw.A stableboy led away my fat little Thistle, who followed him happily toward the well earned rest of her stable.And with her, I thought, went my hopes of any imminent escape and return to my own place.Oh, Frank.I closed my eyes, letting a tear slide down the side of my nose.I opened my eyes wide on the courtyard then, blinked and shut them tight, trying frantically to recall Franks features.Just for a moment, when I closed my eyes, I had seen not my beloved husband, but his ancestor, Jack Randall, full lips curved in a mocking smile.And shying mentally from that image, my mind had summoned at once a picture of Jamie, face set in fear and anger, as I had seen him in the window of Randalls private office.Try as I might, I could not bring back Franks remembered image with any certainty.I felt suddenly quite cold with panic, and clasped my hands about my elbows.And what if I had succeeded in escaping and finding my way back to the circle of stone?I thought.What then?Jamie would, I hoped, soon find solacewith Laoghaire, perhaps.I had worried before about his reaction to finding me gone.But aside from that hasty moment of regret on the edge of the burn, it had not before occurred to me to wonder how I would feel to part with him.I fiddled idly with the ribbon drawstring that gathered the neck of my shift, tying and untying it.If I meant to leave, as I did, I was doing neither of us a favor by allowing the bond between us to strengthen any further.I should not allow him to fall in love with me.If he meant to do any such thing, I thought, remembering once more Laoghaire and the conversation with Colum.If he had married me so coldbloodedly as it seemed, perhaps his emotions were safer than mine.Between fatigue, hunger, disappointment, and uncertainty, I had by this time succeeded in reducing myself to such a state of confused misery that I could neither sleep or sit still.Instead, I roamed unhappily about the room, picking up objects and putting them down at random.The draft from the opening door upset the delicate equilibrium of the comb I had been balancing on its end, heralding Jamies return.He looked faintly flushed and oddly excited.Oh, youre awake, he said, obviously surprised and disconcerted to find me so.Yes, I said unkindly, were you hoping Id be asleep so you could go back to her?His brows drew together for a moment, then raised in inquiry.Her?To Laoghaire, ye mean?Hearing her name spoken in that casual Highland liltLheersuddenly made me irrationally angry.Oh, so you have been with her!I snapped.Jamie looked puzzled and wary, and slightly annoyed.Aye, he said.I met her by the stair as I went out.Are ye well, Sassenach?Ye look a bit fashed, all in all.He eyed me appraisingly.I picked up the looking glass, and found that my hair was standing out in a bushy mane round my head and there were dark circles under my eyes.I put it down again with a thump.No, Im perfectly all right, I said, with an effort at controlling myself.And how is Laoghaire?I asked, assuming casualness.Oh, quite bonny, he said.He leaned back against the door, arms crossed, watching me speculatively.A bit surprised to hear we were married, I reckon.Bonny, I said, and took a deep breath.I looked up to find him grinning at me.Youd not worrit yourself over the lassie, would ye now, Sassenach?he asked shrewdly.Shes naught to youor me, he added.Oh, no?She wouldntor couldntmarry you.You had to have someone, so you took me when the chance offered.I dont blame you for thatnot much I didntbut I  He crossed the room in two steps and took me by the hands, interrupting me.He put a finger under my chin and forced my gaze up.Claire, he said evenly, I shall tell ye in my own time why Ive wed yeor I wont.I asked honesty of you, and Ive given ye the same.And I give it to you now.The girl has no claim on me beyond that of courtesy.He squeezed my chin lightly.But that claim she has, and Ill honor it.He released my chin and chucked me softly under it.Dye hear me, Sassenach?Oh, I hear!I jerked free, rubbing my chin resentfully.And Im sure youll be very courteous to her.But next time draw the drapes of the alcoveI dont want to see it.The coppery brows shot up, and his face reddened slightly.Are ye suggesting Ive played ye false?he said, unbelievingly.Weve been back to the Castle less than an hour, Im covered wi the sweat and dust of two days in the saddle, and so tired my knees wabble, and yet ye think Ive gone straight out to seduce a maid of sixteen?He shook his head, looking stunned.I canna tell whether ye mean to compliment my virility, Sassenach, or insult my morals, but I dinna care much for either suggestion.Murtagh told me women were unreasonable, but Jesus God!He ran a large hand through his hair, making the short ends stick up wildly.Of course I dont mean I think youve been seducing her, I said, struggling to inject an air of calmness into my tone.All I mean It occurred to me that Frank had handled this kind of thing much more gracefully than I was managing to do, and yet I had been angry then too.Likely there was no good way to suggest such a possibility to ones mate.I simply mean thatthat I realize that you married me for your own reasonsand those reasons are your own business, I added hastily, and that I have no claim at all on you.Youre at perfect liberty to behave as you wish.If youif theres an attraction elsewhereI meanI wont stand in your way, I finished lamely.The blood was hot in my cheeks and I could feel my ears burning.Looking up, I found that Jamies ears were burning as well, visibly, and so was the rest of him from the neck up.Even his eyes, bloodshot from lack of sleep, seemed to be flaming slightly.No claim on me!he exclaimed.And what dye think a wedding vow is, lassie?Just words in a church?He brought one big fist down on the chest with a crash that shook the porcelain ewer.No claim, he muttered, as though to himself.At liberty to behave as I wish.And youll not stand in my way?!He bent to pull off his boots, then picked them up and threw them, one after the other, as hard as he could at the wall.I winced as each one thudded off the stones and bounced to the floor.He yanked off his plaid and tossed it heedlessly behind him.Then he started toward me, glaring.So youve no claim on me, Sassenach?Youll free me to take my pleasure where I like, is that it?Well, is it?he demanded.Er, well, yes, I said, taking a step backward despite myself.Thats what I meant.He grabbed my arms, and I found the combustion had spread to his hands as well.His callused palms were so hot on my skin that I jerked involuntarily.Well, if youve no claim on me, Sassenach, he said, Ive one on you!Come here.He took my face in his hands and set his mouth on mine.There was nothing either gentle or undemanding about that kiss, and I fought against it, trying to pull back from him.He bent and scooped me up with an arm under my knees, ignoring my attempts to get down.I hadnt realized just how bloody strong he really was.Let go of me!I said.What do you think youre doing?Well, I should ha thought that was reasonably clear, Sassenach, he said through his teeth.He lowered his head, the clear gaze piercing me like a hot iron.Though if ye want telling, he said, I mean to take ye to bed.Now.And keep ye there until youve learned just what claim I have on you.And he kissed me again, deliberately hard, cutting off my protest.I dont want to sleep with you!I said, when at last he freed my mouth.I dinna intend to sleep, Sassenach, he replied evenly.Not just yet.He reached the bed and set me carefully on the rose patterned quilt.You know bloody well what I mean!I rolled, meaning to escape from the other side, but was stopped by a solid grip on my shoulder that flipped me back to face him.I dont want to make love with you, either!Blue eyes blazed down at me from close range, and my breath came thick in my throat.I didna ask your preferences in the matter, Sassenach, he answered, voice dangerously low.You are my wife, as Ive told ye often enough.If ye didna wish to wed me, still ye chose to.And if ye didna happen to notice at the time, your part of the proceedings included the word obey.Youre my wife, and if I want ye, woman, then Ill have you, and be damned to ye!His voice rose throughout, until he was near shouting.I rose to my knees, fists balled at my sides, and shouted back at him.The contained misery of the last hour had reached explosion point and I let him have it, point blank.I will be damned if Ill have you, you bullying swine!You think you can order me to your bed?Use me like a whore when you feel like it?Well, you cant you fucking bastard!Do that, and youre no better than your precious Captain Randall!He glared at me for a moment, then stood abruptly aside.Leave, then, he said, jerking his head toward the door.If thats what ye think of me, go!Ill not hinder ye.I hesitated for a moment, watching him.His jaw was clenched with anger and he was looming over me like the Colossus of Rhodes.His temper this time was under tight rein, though he was as angry now as he had been by the roadside near Doonesbury.But he meant it.If I chose to leave, he wouldnt stop me.I lifted my chin, my own jaw clenched as tightly as his.No, I said.No.I dont run away from things.And Im not afraid of you.His gaze fastened on my throat, where my pulse was going at a frantic rate.Aye, I see, he said.He stared down at me, and his face gradually relaxed into a look of grudging acquiescence.He sat down gingerly on the bed, keeping a good distance between us, and I sat back warily.He breathed deeply several times before speaking, his face fading a bit toward its natural ruddy bronze.I dont run either, Sassenach, he said gruffly.Now, then.What does fucking mean?My surprise must have shown plainly, for he said irritably, If ye must call me names, thats one thing.But I dinna care to be called things I cant answer.I know its a damn filthy word, from the way ye said it, but what does it mean?Taken off guard, I laughed, a little shakily.Itit meanswhat you were about to do to me.One brow lifted, and he looked sourly amused.Oh, swiving?Then I was right; it is a damn filthy word.And whats a sadist?Ye called me that the other day.I suppressed the urge to laugh.Its, er, its a person whowho, er, gets sexual pleasure from hurting someone.My face was crimsoning, but I couldnt stop the corners of my mouth from turning up slightly.Jamie snorted briefly.Well, ye dinna flatter me overmuch, he said, but I canna fault your observations.He took a deep breath and leaned back, unclenching his hands.He stretched his fingers deliberately, then laid his hands flat on his knees and looked directly at me.What is it, then?Why are ye doing this?The girl?Ive told ye the plain truth there.But its not a matter for proof.Its a question of whether ye believe me or no.Do ye believe me?Yes, I believe you, I admitted grudgingly.But thats not it.Or not all of it, I added, in an attempt at honesty.ItsI think its finding that you married me for the money youd get.I looked down, tracing the pattern of the quilt with my finger.I know Ive no right to complainI married you for selfish reasons, too, butI bit my lip and swallowed to steady my voicebut I have a small bit of pride, too, you know.I stole a glance at him, and found him staring at me with an expression of complete dumbfoundedness.Money?he said blankly.Yes, money!I blazed, angered at his pretense of ignorance.When we came back, you couldnt wait to tell Colum you were married and collect your share of the MacKenzie rents!He stared at me for a moment longer, mouth opening gradually as though to say something.Instead, he began to shake his head slowly back and forth, and then began to laugh.He threw his head back and roared, in fact, then sank his head between his hands, still laughing hysterically.I flung myself back on the pillows in indignation.Funny, was it?Still shaking his head and wheezing intermittently, he stood up and set hands to the buckle of his belt.I flinched involuntarily as he did so, and he saw it.Face still flushed with a mixture of anger and laughter, he looked down at me in total exasperation.No, he said dryly, I dinna mean to beat you.I gave ye my word Id not do so againthough I didna think Id regret it quite so soon.He laid the belt aside, groping in the sporran attached to it.My share of the MacKenzie rents comes to about twenty pounds a quarter, Sassenach, he said, digging through the oddments inside the badgerskin.And thats Scots, not sterling.About the price of half a cow.Thatsthats all?I said stupidly.But  Thats all, he confirmed.And all I ever will have from the MacKenzies.Yell have noticed Dougals a thrifty man, and Colums twice as tight fisted wi his coin.But even the princely sum of twenty pound a quarter is hardly worth marrying to get, I should think, he added sarcastically, eyeing me.I wouldna have asked for it straight away, at that, he added, bringing out a small paper wrapped parcel, but there was something I wanted to buy with it.Thats where my errand took me; meeting Laoghaire was an accident.And what did you want to buy so much?I asked suspiciously.He sighed and hesitated for a moment, then tossed the small package lightly into my lap.A wedding ring, Sassenach, he said.I got it from Ewen the armorer; he makes such things in his own time.Oh, I said in a small voice.Go ahead, he said, a moment later.Open it.Its yours.The outlines of the little package blurred under my fingers.I blinked and sniffed, but made no move to open it.Im sorry, I said.Well, so ye should be, Sassenach, he said, but his voice was no longer angry.Reaching, he took the package from my lap and tore away the wrapping, revealing a wide silver band, decorated in the Highland interlace style, a small and delicate Jacobean thistle bloom carved in the center of each link.So much I saw, and then my eyes blurred again.I found a handkerchief thrust into my hand, and did my best to stanch the flow with it.Itsbeautiful, I said, clearing my throat and dabbling at my eyes.Will ye wear it, Claire?His voice was gentle now, and his use of my name, mostly reserved for occasions of formality or tenderness, nearly made me break down again.You needna do so, he said, looking at me seriously over his cupped palm.The marriage contract between us is satisfiedits legal.Youre protected, safe from anything much save a warrant, and even from that, so long as youre at Leoch.If ye wish, we may live apartif thats what ye were trying to say wi all yon rubbish about Laoghaire.You need have little more to do wi me, if thats your honest choice.He sat motionless, waiting, holding the tiny circlet near his heart.So he was giving me the choice I had started out to give him.Forced on me by circumstance, he would force himself on me no longer, if I chose to reject him.And there was the alternative, of course: to accept the ring, and all that went with it.The sun was setting.The last rays of light shone through a blue glass flagon that stood on the table, streaking the wall with a shaft of brilliant lapis.I felt as fragile and as brilliant as the glass, as though I would shatter with a touch, and fall in glittering fragments to the floor.If I had meant to spare either Jamies emotions or my own, it seemed I was very much too late.I couldnt speak, but held out my right hand to him, fingers trembling.The ring slipped cool and bright over my knuckle and rested snug at the base of my fingera good fit.Jamie held my hand a moment, looking at it, then suddenly pressed my knuckles hard against his mouth.He raised his head, and I saw his face for an instant, fierce and urgent, before he pulled me roughly onto his lap.He held me hard against him then, without speaking, and I could feel the pulsebeat in his throat, hammering like my own.His hands went to my bare shoulders, and he held me slightly away, so that I was looking upward into his face.His hands were large and very warm, and I felt slightly dizzy.I want ye, Claire, he said, sounding choked.He paused a moment, as though unsure what to say next.I want ye so muchI can scarcely breathe.Will He swallowed, then cleared his throat.Will ye have me?By now I had found my voice.It squeaked and wobbled, but it worked.Yes, I said.Yes, Ill have you.I think he began, then stopped.He fumbled loose the buckle of his kilt, but then looked up at me, bunching his hands at his sides.He spoke with difficulty, controlling something so powerful that his hands shook with the effort.Ill notI cantClaire, I canna be gentle about it.I had time only to nod once, in acknowledgment or permission, before he bore me back before him, his weight pinning me to the bed.He did not pause to undress further.I could smell the road dust in his shirt, and taste the sun and sweat of travel on his skin.He held me, arms outstretched, wrists pinioned.One hand brushed the wall, and I felt the tiny scrape of one wedding ring chiming against the stone.One ring for each hand, one silver, one gold.And the thin metal suddenly heavy as the bonds of matrimony, as though the rings were tiny shackles, fastening me spread eagled to the bed, stretched forever between two poles, held in bondage like Prometheus on his lonely rock, divided love the vulture that tore at my heart.He spread my thighs with his knee and sheathed himself to the root in a single thrust that made me gasp.He made a sound that was almost a groan, and gripped me tighter.Youre mine, mo duinne, he said softly, pressing himself into my depths.Mine alone, now and forever.Mine, whether ye will it or no.I pulled against his grip, and sucked in my breath with a faint ah as he pressed even deeper.Aye, I mean to use ye hard, my Sassenach, he whispered.I want to own you, to possess you, body and soul.I struggled slightly and he pressed me down, hammering me, a solid, inexorable pounding that reached my womb with each stroke.I mean to make ye call me Master, Sassenach.His soft voice was a threat of revenge for the agonies of the last minutes.I mean to make you mine.I quivered and moaned then, my flesh clutching in spasms at the invading, battering presence.The movement went on, disregarding, on and on for minutes, striking me over and over with an impact on the edge between pleasure and pain.I felt dissolved, as though I existed only at the point of the assault, being forced to the edge of some total surrender.No!I gasped.Stop, please, youre hurting me!Beads of sweat ran down his face and dropped on the pillow and on my breasts.Our flesh met now with the smack of a blow that was fast crossing the edge into pain.My thighs were bruising with the repeated impact, and my wrists felt as though they would break, but his grip was inexorable.Aye, beg me for mercy, Sassenach.Ye shallna have it, though; not yet.His breath came hot and fast, but he showed no signs of tiring.My entire body convulsed, legs rising to wrap around him, seeking to contain the sensation.I could feel the jolt of each stroke deep in my belly, and cringed from it, even as my hips rose traitorously to welcome it.He felt my response, and redoubled his assault, pressing now on my shoulders to keep me pinned under him.There was no beginning and no end to my response, only a continuous shudder that rose to a peak with each thrust.The hammering was a question, repeated over and over in my flesh, demanding my answer.He pushed my legs flat again, and bore me down past pain and into pure sensation, over the edge of surrender.Yes!I cried.Oh God, Jamie, yes!He gripped my hair and forced my head back to meet his eyes, glowing with furious triumph.Aye, Sassenach, he muttered, answering my movements rather than my words.Ride ye I will!His hands dropped to my breasts, squeezing and stroking, then slid down my sides.His whole weight rested on me now as he cupped and raised me for still greater penetration.I screamed then and he stopped my mouth with his, not a kiss, but another attack, forcing my mouth open, bruising my lips and rasping my face with bearded stubble.He thrust harder and faster, as though he would force my soul as he forced my body.In body or soul, somewhere he struck a spark, and an answering fury of passion and need sprang from the ashes of surrender.I arched upward to meet him, blow for blow.I bit his lip and tasted blood.I felt his teeth then on my neck and dug my nails into his back.I raked him from nape to buttocks, spurring him to rear and scream in his turn.We savaged each other in desperate need, biting and clawing, trying to draw blood, trying each to pull the other into ourselves, tearing each others flesh in the consuming desire to be one.My cry mingled with his, and we lost ourselves finally in each other in that last moment of dissolution and completion.* * *    I returned only slowly to myself, lying half on Jamies breast, sweated bodies still glued together, thigh to thigh.He breathed heavily, eyes closed.I could hear his heart under my ear, beating with the preternaturally slow and powerful rhythm that follows climax.He felt me wake, and drew me close, as though to preserve a moment longer the union we had reached in those last seconds of our perilous joining.I curled beside him, putting my arms around him.He opened his eyes then and sighed, the long mouth curling in a faint smile as his glance met mine.I raised my brows in silent question.Oh, aye, Sassenach, he answered a bit ruefully.I am your masterand youre mine.Seems I canna possess your soul without losing my own.He turned me on my side and curled his body around me.The room was cooling in the evening breeze from the window, and he reached to draw a quilt over us.Youre too quick by half, lad, I thought drowsily to myself.Frank never did find that out.I fell asleep with his arms locked hard around me and his breathing warm in my ear.* * *    I was lame and sore in every muscle when I woke next morning.I shuffled to the privy closet, then to the wash basin.My innards felt like churned butter.It felt as though I had been beaten with a blunt object, I reflected, then thought that that was very near the truth.The blunt object in question was visible as I came back to bed, looking now relatively harmless.Its possessor woke as I sat down next to him, and examined me with something that looked very much like male smugness.Looks as though it was a hard ride, Sassenach, he said, lightly touching a blue bruise on my inner thigh.A bit saddle sore, are ye?I narrowed my eyes and traced a deep bite mark on his shoulder with my finger.You look a bit ragged around the edges yourself, my lad.Ah, weel, he said in broad Scots, if ye bed wi a vixen, ye must expect to get bit.He reached up and grasped me behind the neck, pulling me down to him.Come here to me, vixen.Bite me some more.Oh, no, you dont, I said, pulling back.I cant possibly; Im too sore.James Fraser was not a man to take no for an answer.Ill be verra gentle, he wheedled, dragging me inexorably under the quilt.And he was gentle, as only big men can be, cradling me like a quails egg, paying me court with a humble patience that I recognized as reparationand a gentle insistence that I knew was a continuation of the lesson so brutally begun the night before.Gentle he would be, denied he would not.He shook in my arms at his own finish, shuddering with the effort not to move, not to hurt me by thrusting, letting the moment shatter him as it would.Afterward, still joined, he traced the fading bruises his fingers had left on my shoulders by the roadside two days before.Im sorry for those, mo duinne, he said, gently kissing each one.I was in a rare temper when I did it, but its no excuse.Its shameful to hurt a woman, in a rage or no.Ill not do it again.I laughed a bit ironically.Youre apologizing for those?What about the rest?Im a mass of bruises, from head to toe!Och?He drew back to look me over judiciously.Well now, these Ive apologized for, touching my shoulder, those, slapping my rear lightly, ye deserved, and Ill not say Im sorry for it, because Im not.As for these, he said, stroking my thigh, Ill not apologize for that, either.Ye paid me full measure already.He rubbed his shoulder, grimacing.Ye drew blood in at least two places, Sassenach, and my back stings like holy hell.Well, bed with a vixen I said, grinning.You wont get an apology for that.He laughed in response and pulled me on top of him.I didna say I wanted an apology, did I?If I recall aright, what I said was Bite me again.PART FOUR      A Whiff of Brimstone      24    BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMBS    The hubbub occasioned by our sudden arrival and the announcement of our marriage was overshadowed almost at once by an event of greater importance.We were sitting at supper in the great Hall the next day, accepting the toasts and good wishes being offered in our honor.Buidheachas, mo caraid.Jamie bowed gracefully to the latest toaster, and sat down amid the increasingly sporadic applause.The wooden bench shook under his weight, and he closed his eyes briefly.Getting a bit much for you?I whispered.He had borne the brunt of the toasting, matching each cup drained on our behalf, while I had so far escaped with no more than token sips, accompanied by bright smiles at the incomprehensible Gaelic toasts.He opened his eyes and looked down at me, smiling himself.Am I drunk, do ye mean?Nay, I could drink this stuff all night.You practically have, I said, peering at the array of empty wine bottles and stone ale jars lined up on the board in front of us.Its getting rather late.The candles on Colums table burned low in their holders, and the guttered wax glowed gold, the light marking the MacKenzie brothers with odd patches of shadow and glinting flesh as they leaned together, talking in low voices.They could have joined the company of carved gnomic heads that edged the huge fireplace, and I wondered how many of those caricatured figures had in fact been drawn from the patronizing features of earlier MacKenzie lairdsperhaps by a carver with a sense of humoror a strong family connection.Jamie stretched slightly in his seat, grimacing in mild discomfort.On the other hand, he said, my bladders going to burst in another moment or two.Ill be back shortly.He put his hands on the bench and hopped nimbly up and over it, disappearing through the lower archway.I turned my attention to my other side, where Geillis Duncan sat, demurely sipping at a silver cup of ale.Her husband, Arthur, sat at the next table with Colum, as befitted the procurator fiscal of the district, but Geilie had insisted on sitting next to me, saying that she had no wish to be wearied by hearing man talk all through supper.Arthurs deepset eyes were half closed, blue pouched and sunk with wine and fatigue.He leaned heavily on his forearms, face slack, ignoring the conversation of the MacKenzies next to him.While the light threw the sharp cut features of the laird and his brother into a high relief, it merely made Arthur Duncan look fat and ill.Your husband isnt looking very well, I observed.Has his stomach trouble got worse?The symptoms were rather puzzling; not like ulcer, I thought, nor cancernot with that much flesh still on his bonesperhaps just chronic gastritis, as Geilie insisted.She cast the briefest of glances at her spouse before turning back to me with a shrug.Oh, hes well enough, she said.No worse, at any rate.But what about your husband?Er, what about him?I replied cautiously.She dug me familiarly in the ribs with a rather sharp elbow, and I realized that there were a fair number of bottles at her end of the table as well.Well, what dye think?Does he look as nice out of his sark as he does in it?Um I groped for an answer, as she craned her neck toward the entryway.And you claiming you didna care a bit for him!Cleverboots.Half the girls in the castle would like to tear your hair out by the rootsId be careful what I ate, if I were you.What I eat?I looked down in bafflement at the wooden platter before me, empty but for a smear of grease and a forlorn boiled onion.Poison, she hissed dramatically in my ear, along with a considerable wafting of brandy fumes.Nonsense, I said, rather coldly, drawing away from her.No one would want to poison me simply because Iwell, because I was floundering a bit, and it occurred to me that I might have had a few sips more than I had realized.Now, really, Geilie.This marriageI didnt plan it, you know.I didnt want it!No lie there.It was merely asort ofnecessary business arrangement, I said, hoping the candlelight hid my blushes.Ha, she said cynically.I ken the look of a lass thats been well bedded.She glanced toward the archway where Jamie had disappeared.And damned if I think those are midge bites on the laddies neck, either.She raised one silver brow at me.If it was a business arrangement, Id say ye got your moneys worth.She leaned close again.Is it true?she whispered.About the thumbs?Thumbs?Geilie, what in Gods name are you babbling about?She looked down her small, straight nose at me, frowning in concentration.The beautiful grey eyes were slightly unfocused, and I hoped she wouldnt fall over.Surely ye know that?Everyone knows!A mans thumbs tell ye the size of his cock.Great toes, too, of course, she added judiciously, but those are harder to judge, usually, what wi the shoon and all.Yon wee fox cub, she nodded toward the archway, where Jamie had just reappeared, he could cup a good sized marrow in those hands of his.Or a good sized arse, hm?she added, nudging me once more.Geillis Duncan, willyoushutup!I hissed, face flaming.Someone will hear you!Oh, no one who she began, but stopped, staring.Jamie had passed right by our table, as though he didnt see us.His face was pale, and his lips set firmly, as though bent on some unpleasant duty.Whatever ails him?Geilie asked.He looks like Arthur after hes eaten raw turnips.I dont know.I pushed back the bench, hesitating.He was heading for Colums table.Should I follow him?Plainly something had happened.Geilie, peering back down the room, suddenly tugged at my sleeve, pointing in the direction from which Jamie had appeared.A man stood just within the archway, hesitating even as I was.His clothes were stained with mud and dust; a traveler of some sort.A messenger.And whatever the message, he had passed it on to Jamie, who was even now bending to whisper it in Colums ear.No, not Colum.Dougal.The red head bent low between the two dark ones, the broad handsome features of the three faces taking on an unearthly similarity in the light of the dying candles.And as I watched, I realized that the similarity was due not so much to the inheritance of bone and sinew that they shared, but to the expression of shocked grief that they now held in common.Geilies hand was digging into the flesh of my forearm.Bad news, she said, unnecessarily.* * *    Twenty four years, I said softly.It seems a long time to be married.Aye, it does, Jamie agreed.A warm wind stirred the branches of the tree above us, lifting the hair from my shoulders to tickle my face.Longer than Ive been alive.I glanced at him leaning on the paddock fence, all lanky grace and strong bones.I tended to forget how young he really was; he seemed so self assured and capable.Still, he said, flicking a straw into the churned mud of the paddock, I doubt Dougal spent more than three years of that with her.He was generally here, ye ken, at the Castleor here and there about the lands, doing Colums business for him.Dougals wife, Maura, had died at their estate of Beannachd.A sudden fever.Dougal himself had left at dawn, in company with Ned Gowan and the messenger who had brought the news the night before, to arrange the funeral and dispose of his wifes property.Not a close marriage, then?I asked curiously.Jamie shrugged.As close as most, I should reckon.She had the children and the running of the house to keep her busy; I doubt she missed him greatly, though she seemed glad enough to see him when he came home.Thats right, you lived with them for a time, didnt you?I was quiet, thinking.I wondered whether this was Jamies idea of marriage; separate lives, joining only infrequently for the breeding of children.Yet, from the little he had said, his own parents marriage had been a close and loving one.With that uncanny trick of reading my thoughts, he said, It was different wi my own folk, ye ken.Dougals was an arranged marriage, like Colums and a matter more of lands and business than the wanting of each other.But my parentswell, they wed for love, against the wishes of both families, and so we werenot cut off, exactly; but more by ourselves at Lallybroch.My parents didna go often to visit relatives or do business outside, and so I think they turned more to each other than husband and wife usually do.He laid a hand low on my back and urged me closer to him.He bent his head and brushed his lips across the top of my ear.It was an arrangement between us, he said softly.Still, I would hopeperhaps one day He broke off awkwardly, with a crooked smile and a gesture of dismissal.Not wanting to encourage him in that direction, I smiled back as neutrally as I could, and turned toward the paddock.I could feel him there beside me, not quite touching, big hands gripping the top rail of the fence.I gripped the rail myself, to keep from taking his hand.I wanted more than anything to turn to him, offer him comfort, assure him with body and words that what lay between us was more than a business arrangement.It was the truth of it that stopped me.What it is between us, he had said.When I lie with you, when you touch me.No, it wasnt usual at all.It wasnt a simple infatuation, either, as I had first thought.Nothing could be less simple.The fact remained that I was bound, by vows and loyalty and law, to another man.And by love as well.I could not, could not tell Jamie what I felt for him.To do that and then to leave, as I must, would be the height of cruelty.Neither could I lie to him.Claire.He had turned to me, was looking down at me; I could feel it.I didnt speak, but raised my face to him as he bent to kiss me.I couldnt lie to him that way either, and didnt.After all, I thought dimly, I had promised him honesty.We were interrupted by a loud Ahem!from behind the paddock fence.Jamie, startled, whirled toward the sound, instinctively thrusting me behind him.Then he stopped and grinned, seeing Old Alec MacMahon standing there in his filthy trews, viewing us sardonically with his one bright blue eye.The old man held a wicked looking pair of gelding shears, which he raised in ironic salute.I was goin to use these on Mahomet, he remarked.Perhaps they could be put to better use here, eh?He snicked the thick blades invitingly.Itd keep your mind on your work, and off your cock, laddie.Dont even jest about it, man, said Jamie, grinning.Wanting me, were ye?Alec waggled an eyebrow like a woolly caterpillar.No, what gives ye to think that?I thought Id like to try gelding a blooded two year old all by mysel, for the joy of it.He wheezed briefly at his own wit, then waved the shears toward the Castle.Off wi ye, lassie.Ye can have him back at supperfor what good hell be to ye by then.Apparently not trusting the nature of this last remark, Jamie reached out a long arm and neatly snagged the shears.Ill feel safer if Ive got these, he said, cocking an eyebrow at Old Alec.Go along, Sassenach.When Ive finished doing all of Alecs work for him, Ill come and find ye.He leaned down to kiss my cheek, and whispered in my ear, The stables.When the suns mid sky.* * *    The stables of Castle Leoch were better built than many of the cottages I had seen on our journey with Dougal.Stone floored and stone walled, the only openings were the narrow windows at one end, the door at the other, and the narrow slits under the thick thatched roof, intended for the convenience of the owls who kept down the mice in the hay.They let in plenty of air, though, and enough light that the stables were pleasantly dim rather than gloomy.Up in the hayloft, just under the roof, the light was even better, striping the piled hay with yellow bars and lighting the drifting dust motes like showers of gold dust.The air came in through the chinks in warm drafts, scented with stock and sweet william and garlic from the gardens outside, and the pleasant animal smell of the horses wafted up from below.Jamie stirred under my hand and sat up, the movement bringing his head from the shadow into a blaze of sunlight like the lighting of a candle.What is it?I asked sleepily, turning my head in the direction he was looking.Wee Hamish, he said softly, peering over the edge of the loft into the stable below.Wants his pony, I expect.I rolled awkwardly onto my stomach beside him, dragging the folds of my shift over me for modestys sake; a silly thought, as no one below could see more than the top of my head.Colums son Hamish was walking slowly down the aisle of the stable between the stalls.He seemed to hesitate near some stalls, though he ignored the curious heads of chestnut and sorrel poking out to inspect him.Clearly he was looking for something, and it wasnt his fat brown pony, placidly munching straw in its stall near the stable door.Holy God, hes going for Donas!Jamie seized his kilt and wrapped it hurriedly about himself before swinging down from the edge of the loft.Not bothering with the ladder, he hung by his hands and then dropped to the floor.He landed lightly on the straw scattered stones, but with enough of a thud to make Hamish whirl around with a startled gasp.The small freckled face relaxed somewhat as he realized who it was, but the blue eyes stayed wary.Needing a bit of help, coz?Jamie inquired pleasantly.He moved toward the stalls and leaned against one of the uprights, managing to insert himself between Hamish and the stall the boy had been heading for.Hamish hesitated, but then drew himself up, small chin thrust out.Im going to ride Donas, he said, in a tone that tried for determination, but fell somewhat short.Donashis name meant demon, and was in no way meant as flatterywas in a horse box to himself at the far end of the stable, safely separated by an empty stall from the nearest neighboring horses.A huge, evil tempered sorrel stallion, he was ridable by no one, and only Old Alec and Jamie dared go near him.There was an irritable squeal from the shadows of his stall, and an enormous copper head shot suddenly out, huge yellow teeth clacking together as the horse made a vain attempt to bite the bare shoulder so temptingly displayed.Jamie stayed motionless, knowing that the stallion couldnt reach him.Hamish jumped back with a squeak, clearly scared speechless by the sudden appearance of that monstrous shimmering head, with its rolling, bloodshot eyes and flaring nostrils.I dinna think so, observed Jamie mildly.He reached down and took his small cousin by the shoulder, steering him away from the horse, who kicked his stall in protest.Hamish shuddered in concert with the boards of the stall as the lethal hooves crashed against the wood.Jamie turned the boy around to face him and stood looking down at him, hands on his kilted hips.Now then, he said firmly.Whats this all about?Why are ye wanting aught to do wi Donas?Hamishs jaw was set stubbornly, but Jamies face was both encouraging and adamant.He punched the boy gently on the shoulder, getting a tiny smile response.Come on, duine, Jamie said, softly.Ye know I wilna tell anyone.Have ye done something foolish?A faint flush came up on the boys fair skin.No.
