Then they drink and dance.I did see some of that at the reception, she said with a laugh.He took her hand and they began to walk down the road to his parents house.Sunday is different.Its the only day Paco sits in his favorite chair and spends hours on the newspaper.Or he might read his magazinesall about agriculture.The television stays off and doesnt come on until 60 Minutes when he argues with the TV and accuses them of having everything wrong, but he never misses it.We have that in common, she said.My father does the same.She enjoyed the walk, the hand holding, the fact that they had everything and nothing in common.Thered been those divorces, but that seemed to be where it ended.Their families were completely different but both had built family businesses.Her family was so vanilla and ordinary while he had that rich Basque culture.Between them there seemed to be a unique understanding that allowed them to explore each others lives and emotions.When they got to the house they found it bursting at the seams.She had trouble counting them allit was the mother lode.Matt reintroduced her to people shed met at the wedding receptionthe women were in the kitchen, the kids were all over the place, everyone was smiling a little wildly as they said hello and she knew, then and there, they were hopeful that Mad Matt had found a woman.What the devil was she to do about that?They had gone over thatthey werent about that, they werent able to couple up, even though just for a moment she thought about how comforting that could be.They set a place for you, he whispered to her.Thats when she was able to count.There were nineteen plates on the long oak table.Nineteen!Soon she was settled into her place next to Matt, beside his mother, his father not far away.There was a momentary silence for a brief blessing.Then everyone was again talking at once.Paco was pontificating to one of his sons in law while simultaneously loading up his plate, mothers reprimanded children, women laughed, kids argued.She looked at them, seeing a few pale brunettes and blondes among the in laws and children.Serving platters and tureens crowded the table and people moved them around quickly.Much to her disbelief, Corinne picked up Gingers plate and served her, heaping a little of every dish, filling her bowl with soup, tearing off crusty bread with her hands and placing it on the bread plate.Her glass was filled with white wine.Oh, no, she protested.I have a long drive ahead!Without a word, Corinne switched wineglasses, taking Gingers full one and pouring a small amount into her empty one, then placing it in front of Ginger.Dont worry, you dont have to eat it all, Matt whispered to her.And you dont have to drink the wine.I want you to have a safe drive.The plate Corinne had filled was placed in front of her and she stared at it in disbelief.There was enough food for at least three meals before her.She looked at it uncertainly.She picked up her fork, not knowing where to start.The table fell silent, even the children.They were all staring at hershe could feel their eyes.Ginger sampled what she believed to be a chicken dish, though what kind she had no idea.She slid the fork into her mouth and the flavors seduced her instantly.Mmm, she said, letting her eyes close briefly.Everyone immediately began talking again, laughing, gossiping, lecturing.She looked at Matt in confusion, her brow furrowed.He laughed and whispered, Everyone wants to know if you like our stuff.Our Basque stuff.She overfilled your plate, dont hurt yourself.Be glad shes not spooning it into your mouth.Is this like an initiation?Yeah, something like that.Dont worry now.You gave the approved response.She wanted to ask if Natalie almost fainted from the beauty of the food, but of course she couldnt.Maybe during one of those late night phone chats shed brave it.Mick would have loved it; hed have written a song about it because everything was all about him.He would have played his guitar and sung for them.She ate a respectable amount, joined the conversation to talk about the flower shop and Grace, spoke admiringly of the new chicks and lambs, even commented on the amazing June weather.She poked at a rich desert, feeling stuffed.When dinner was done she insisted on helping in the kitchen where there was no dishwasher and many difficult roasters and pots to scrape.They shooed her away but she wouldnt go.First of all, she liked them and second, it was bad manners to ignore the cleanup.Eventually, before the meat and sauces were blasted out of the huge pans, Matt rescued her.He held her denim jacket and said, Come on, everyone, Ginger has a long drive ahead and needs to be on the road.They all chimed in.Of course!Please go before you miss the light!Thank you for everything!You are too wonderful to help!She hugged each one, thanking them for making her so welcome, for sharing their amazing Sunday dinner.Matt walked her outside where she paused beside her car and took a deep breath of the clean air.Then she turned her startled eyes to Matt.Oh, Matt!I wanted to see where you were going to build your house!How did I forget that?Next time, he said with a smile.We were too busy for that today.Next time?Your family will think Im a freeloader!My family?he asked, laughing.Youre lucky they didnt hold you down and stuff you!You complimented them very nicely without even knowing it.My mother will be ecstatic.Thank her again for me, will you please?Of course.Im glad you had a good time.Will you do something for me?Whats that?she asked, wondering if she should send Corinne a thank you note.Will you call me when youre home?You dont have to call the second you arrive, but tonight?Maybe we can do a postmortem on your visit to the crazy Lacoumette farm.It was far from crazy, she said.Im so glad I saw you last night.So glad I came today.He had a hand on her waist and leaned his forehead against hers.It was a nice day.Perfect, she agreed.Will you kiss me goodbye?he asked.It wont obligate you to anything.She put a hand against his cheek.I dont have anything.Not yet, maybe.But were pretty lucky, you and me.Our time together has been good.For both of us, I think.She pressed her lips against his.Briefly.Softly.Okay, she said.Forty eight.Im flattered.Drive carefully.Slowly.Call later.I will.* * * Inside the house, several people were crowded at one small window, carefully peering through the sheers, not moving the curtains.Corinne and Paco, Ginny and Ellie, Lori and George.A couple of kids.They watched the goodbye at the car.They look like dawn and dusk, Corinne said.The princess and the dark knight, Ginny said.Matt and a second chance, Ellie said.Shes so lovely in her heart, isnt she?Do you think he knows hes in love with her?Lori asked.Hes a blockhead.He wont know for months, Paco said.Paco!three people admonished at once.Hes stubborn!You think I dont know my son?They saw the kiss, saw him smooth her hair, watched him turn from the car and walk toward the house.They all scrambled away from the window.Even Paco moved at warp speed to his chair, looking all innocent.When Matt walked in the house, everyone was occupied.No one looked at him.Uncle Matt, do you know youre in love with her?Ellies nine year old daughter asked him.What?Matt said.Paco said you wont know for months because youre a There was a sudden plague in the room, a burst of heavy coughing.Ellie whisked her daughter away.* * * By the time Ginger made the freeway, there were tears on her cheeks.The Lacoumettes were so wonderful, all of them.Matt was such a lovely, strong man and what she felt for him was growing in her heart.She wondered what it might have been like to begin her romantic life with someone like him.If her baby was destined to die, how would her life have been different if shed had a loving husband to hold her through the pain and tears?She might be falling in love with him a little.She was very afraid to love again.She was afraid she wasnt very good at it.And when she screwed it up and made mistakes, the next pain would be even worse.A New Hope        Eight On Monday morning, Ginger made it to the shop early.Of course Grace was already there.Who knew how early she had arrived?She was standing in the back room wearing a wedding dress.A sheet was spread out on the floor beneath her to keep the hem of the dress and its train clean.Iris and her mother in law, Gwen, were looking at the dress.Good morning, Ginger said uncertainly.Its going to be madness this week, Grace said.Utter madness.Um, beautiful dress, Ginger said.Not quite yet, its not.Its my mothers dress.Its not really to my taste and its certainly not right for a wedding on the beach, but it would make her happy if I wear it.She has no problem with me altering it, but...I dont know that I can, Gwen said.Its a little complicated.What do you want to do to it?Ginger asked.I like the basic lines, but these puffy sleeves are atrocious.These gathers in the back over the butt, ack.And we cant have a trainthis thing is long and heavy and Im not dragging it through the sand.The deep cowl neckline and bodicenice.I think I want about four yards of satin removed from this thing.Little cap sleeves, gathers smoothed and no train but maybe three inches longer in the back than in the front and maybe some lace appliqu right under the bust, Ginger suggested.But not an empire waistthats too sixteenth century.Fitted, sliding right down your hips.Some seed pearls around this stunning dcolletage would be nice.Youre not showing yet so it should be sleek.Simple, clean, brilliant white satin, smooth lines.A couple of small flowers in your hair.Everyone just stared at her.What?she said.Just an idea...Perfect.Grace looked at Gwen.Can you do that?I dont know, the older woman said.It terrifies me.This is a designer gown!I can do it, Ginger said.I sew.But I dont have a machine with me or any supplies.I didnt even bring a pair of scissorsand this fabric would need especially sharp scissors.Im just not set up for it...Ill fix you up, Gwen said.Im a quilter, I have everything and what I dont have we can buy.We can do it at my house and Ill help with the handwork.Oh, my God, it will be beautiful!But Im not cutting it, not me!I think that dress must have cost a million dollars!For all I know...Grace muttered.Ginger, please be sure the front door to the store is locked.Its locked, she said.Iris and Gwen helped Grace out of the dress.Are you sure?Are you willing to alter it?Im sure I can do it, Ginger said.Are you sure you trust me with it?You may have saved my lifeagain.But your mother may not recognize it with all those changes, Ginger pointed out.Shell recognize that beautiful cowl neckline but nothing else.Thats not the most important thing, Grace said.If I can swear to her its her dress, thats all that matters.Good then, Ginger said.Well save and preserve the removed pieces so your daughter can use them someday.And well need an industrial strength steamerno iron is getting near that fabric.Anything you need.Grace got into her jeans and shirt.I have to get out to the house.A nurse is meeting me there at nineshes going to take care of mother during the day.Peyton and Scott recommended her.Another woman is coming at threeshe could be an evening and weekend nurse if we need her.We dont need round the clock coverage yet but Peyton says theres an excellent agency with lots of good part timers when we do have a need.Troys parents will be here on Wednesday and his brother, sister and her family arrive on Thursday.She stopped dressing and stood stone still.Im sorry, Ginger.Its going to be madness.Ginger smiled despite her nerves.Its going to be beautiful.Try not to worry.School was out.Troy was around to make sure his family had everything they needed and Iris was off for the summer and offered to help in the flower shop.Ginger and Iris wanted the wedding flowers to be perfect.And, as if having an important wedding wasnt a big enough issue with Ginger, the dress was top priority.It will be such an intimate event, Ginger said.There is no such thing on the beach, Iris said.Trust me, Ive lived here all my life.If they marry on the beach, everyone will know about it and theyll either be invited, come even if theyre not invited or be hurt that they werent invited.I warned Graceshes going to have to tell Carrie and Rawley to be prepared to cater to a crowd.God, I hope the weather holds...What happens if it doesnt?Ginger asked.They get married in the living room and depending on the weather, food is served on the deck or in the foyer.Oh, my, Ginger said.Itll hold, Iris said, tenderly placing the dress in the large hang up bag.The week started out crazy and definitely didnt ease up, but Ginger was so happy to have something new to talk to Matt about that she didnt care.She explained all the excitement and complications of the week, how every hand was needed to make this happen quickly so Troys family could meet Graces family before health issues got in the way or, God forbid, Grace was as ripe as a melon!Youre on speaker, she told Matt.No ones here at the moment, but youre on speaker because Im sewing seed pearls around the neckline of this dress.The dress lives with Gwen during the day and then after dinner I bring it home so I can look it over, fit it to Grace and do a little handwork at night.You must be exhausted, he said.Not yet, but Im working on it.I just want this wedding to be wonderful for Grace.And if you could have seen my hand tremble as I was about to take the scissors to this one of a kind gown...I tried not to let it show I was scared to death.But its going to be beautiful.Youre full of surprises.Tell me everything you did this week, she said.While I go blind on these itty bitty pearls, tell me everything.I dont want you to fall asleep while youre supposed to be sewing.Tell me, she said.Its June, the farm is stable.We aerate, irrigate, spray for bugs here and there.George has turned out the lambs, Paco is watching for potato worms and other pests.We make our own compost and its a double edged swordwe dont run the risk of transplanting pests from commercial products but sometimes we create a haven for our own pests because we stay away from the chemicals that will kill them.Our potatoes are well known for being big, healthy and tasty.During summer, we mind the pears and potatoes, we have a small cherry orchard, some apple trees.Were watching the crops.George has needed a hand with the lambsa little docking and castrating.Um, docking?Cropping their tails.If theyre left long, they get messy back there, if you get my drift.Poopy is the drift, I take it.He laughed heartily at that.You dont want poop on your sweater.Why do you castrate them?Where do you plan to get more babies?George has a couple of very happy rams.They take care of the whole flock?she asked, stopping her sewing for a second.She had seen the flock.It seemed there were hundreds of them.Theyre very happy, he clarified.The lambs of these rams grow bigger and faster.George has a very successful business, his sheep are high quality and healthy.Ill spend a couple of days this week helping him vaccinate, too.Wow.I wish I could watch all these things.Maybe not the castrating part.I think farming sounds fun.I think its fun.No offense, I have no interest in watching you sew seed pearls onto a wedding dress.No offense taken.Watching sewing is like watching paint dry.When is this wedding, exactly?he asked.Saturday at four.I just want her to be beautiful and happy, then my work is done.Its a nice time at the farm.We just watch the weather, which has been predictable, and do our chores, which are manageable.When can you come back up here?I can think of things to show you.Its only peak of summer and dead of winter Im not running around like a maniac getting things done.I can show you the plans for the house.You already have plans?she asked.Not official.I have a rendering.Im trying to keep it from being just another farmhouse.How do you do that?Glass.Views.Modern kitchen and bathrooms.Sliding cupboard shelves...She laughed.Theres no reason it cant be a beautiful house just because its on a farm, right?Tell me about it, she said.Almost an hour later, after having made suggestions to the construction of Matts beautiful house, she was ready to put the wedding dress away, get in her pajamas, get an ice water for her bedside table.This had become a nightly event, talking each other almost to sleep, filling each other in on everything from their deep emotional issues to the mundane events of seed pearls and sheep docking.Are you okay?he asked her.Surrounded by wedding plans and pregnant women?I am, she said.As Ray Anne says, were stuck with life so we have to live it.Ive been okay since I came to Thunder Point.Im glad, he said.I better go then.Pears, potatoes and sheep get up early.She snuggled down into bed and wondered if this habit, the phone calls that reached into the night, was a rite of passage.She needed to get back to having girlfriends to share some of this information with.Since she married Mick, they had drifted away or she had drifted away from them.Shed ask Grace.Maybe Iris.In eighth grade she had a boyfriend named Bruce and she remembered talking to him for what seemed like hours.Sometimes they just found recorded songs to play to each other because they had nothing more to say.Sometimes they just listened to each other breathe.They werent nearly as exciting face to face.Matt was so protective.Are you okay?Surrounded by wedding plans and pregnant women?What a darling.Her cell chimed and she smiled.She clicked on.Forget something?she asked.Yeah.I forgot to tell you how awesome it was that you came to my gig.Mick!Holy crap!You looked so awesome.More beautiful than ever.It made me remember how much you inspire me.Im never better than when youre in the house.Oh, babe.What do you want?she asked.Im going to be in the area for a few weeks and I thought we should get together.You can come to a couple of shows.We have a lot of history, good history.Might be time to have another look at that.Its good for me so its gotta be good for you.Right?She started to laugh.She couldnt help itit was so Mick.If it was good for him it must be good for everyone else.Right?I was there to meet a guy.We didnt know you were the show or we wouldve picked another bar.What?A guy?Since when?Since a very long time ago.I dont live in Portland anymore.And the last thing Im ever going to do is get together with you to talk about our history.Lose my number!What?Where do you live?he asked.Houston!she yelled, hitting the end icon.She turned the phone to vibrate and turned off the light.It vibrated at once.A text was coming in.Why hadnt she changed her number?Because she hadnt needed to!Mick never called.Baby, whats wrong?Wasnt that the right song for you?For us?I thought it was just right!I thought about At This Moment.Whats wrong?She couldnt resist.She knew it was futile, that hed never get it, that he was a self absorbed cretin, but she just couldnt resist.Whats wrong?Gosh, lets see.You divorced me when I was pregnant with your child, you brought me flowers at the hospital and I didnt hear from you again until you sent a card a month after his funeral!And it wasnt even in your own handwriting!What could possibly be wrong, you stupid, arrogant asshole!Hey, I paid tribute to him in the next four concerts!I played Tears In Heaven!I must have had a mental break, she thought.Brain damage, thats what it was.How in the world did I ever think this idiot was a real man?Go away.Never contact me again.My boyfriend will kill you.Then my brothers will chop you into little pieces.Whoa, baby, you got some hostility.It was hard to sleep after a phone call like that.Then when Ginger did finally nod off, she was restless with anxiety dreams, the one that finally shook her awake being the worst.It was so vivid, so colorful.And shamefully real.Their house and the freestanding garage where Mick liked to jam with his friends were both full of people, spilling out into the yard.A lot of people gathered around to listen to him play, sing, talk about the business, gossip about artists he knew.Yeah, thats when I met The Boss...he really liked a few of my songs...wouldnt be surprised if he wanted to buy a few.It was getting a little loud.Mick was playing some rock, the speakers making the walls shake.She was getting nervous.They were supposed to keep the weed outside and the noise down.They were going to wake the baby!And the windows were open!These fumescould hurt the baby!The noise wasnt good for him!She went to Mick and appealed to him to clear the place out if he couldnt manage them, the people who gathered around.But he didnt acknowledge her.Her ears were ringing and she decided it would be best if she gathered up the baby and went to her mothers house, but she couldnt find the baby.She should call the police or run to the house next doorbut the neighbors were also in her yard, enjoying the music.She was trying to get to her car but her legs wouldnt carry her and her car wasnt where it was supposed to be and she had no baby.She wanted to call for help but she just cried like a little fool.Mick was telling her to settle down, she wanted this.This is what you signed on for, he reminded her, frowning at her, going back to his guitar and singing.Then he was kissing someone, some woman shed never seen before.Her stomach was in a knot and she was gasping for breath.Her head hurt.In the way dreams can be wild, she was pregnant, then she was searching for the baby and couldnt find him.Her eyes flew open.She was trying to catch her breath, as if shed been running.Her heart was pounding relentlessly and it took her a second to realize it was all a dream.Instinctively, she rolled over, looked at her phone, saw Matts number and hit the redial.His groggy voice answered instantly.What?he said.Whats the matter!Oh, God, she said, suddenly aware she was calling him in the middle of the night.I wasnt thinking.Im sorry.Im so sorry.Its nothing.Its something, he said.What is it?Its nothing, she said, willing herself to be calmer.She tried to slow her breathing.I had a bad dream.I just reached for the phone.And woke you.Jeeztheyre going to lock me up.Im crackers.She ran a hand through her hair.My God, Im just plain nuts.Its okay, he said more calmly.Its okay.Just tell me whats wrong and well talk it through.She looked at the clock.Never mind.You have to wake up in two hours and Im fine.I can sleep in.Till, like, four thirty.She laughed in spite of herself, wiping her cheeks.I bet you wish anyone but me had knocked you out at your sisters wedding.That is a privilege I would grant only you, he said.What did you dream?Was it about the baby?Yes and no.It was about my early years with Mick, back when we moved in together.Our house was a party house.It was my house.I rented it.When he was around, every night was spent rehearsing.There were always people aroundsometimes a few, sometimes a crowdgroupies, musicians, you know.Music, noise, smoke, drugs.I wasnt into drugs, by the way.I tried some pot once, drank a little too much a few times, years before starting a family, but...I was in a fraternity, he said.You dont have to explain.Sounds like a never ending college party, right?I thought it would change when we got married, but it didnt.Why did I think it would change?He never said it would.In my dream, I was concerned about the baby, about the noise and the smoke and the baby and he was telling me to chill.And then I couldnt find the baby, she finished in a weak whisper.Matt, I never had the baby in that house with the parties.I left when I was barely pregnant.I told Mick I was going to stay with my parents until he could wrap his head around the fact that we were having a family and the lifestyle wasnt healthy.I couldnt be around all that second hand smoke and I needed to sleep!Thats when he told me it wouldnt work for him.He was sorry I didnt get it, but that whole family and baby thing just wasnt for him.He was quiet for a second.The stress, he said.I think all the stress is getting to you, Ginger.The wedding, the dress, the pregnant girlfriends...No, no, thats not it.He called me.Right after we hung up, Mick called.What did he want?Matt asked, sounding more alert now.She laughed a little.He thought it was so great that I came to hear him sing.He thought we should get together.To talk about our good history.And you said...?I called him an arrogant asshole and hung up on him, then he texted me and said I had some hostility.Jesus, he muttered.You know, Ive made some incredible blunders, but that defies imagination.It does, doesnt it?He used to bring his guitar to holiday dinners with my parents and brothers and serenade them.He didnt notice that they rolled their eyes and wandered away.Always a show, eh?Matt asked.How did I not know how ridiculous he was?Matt laughed.My ex used to tiptoe through the goat shit in her spike heels when shed come to a family dinner with me.High heels, tight, short skirt, nails like red talons.Everyone in the family looked at her like she was a clown, dressed for the circus, but I didnt even notice how inappropriate she was.Well, not for a year or so...What do you suppose happens to us?I dont know what happened to you but I was pumping about a thousand pounds of fresh testosterone, he said.I figured it out, just not quick enough.Is that why you divorced?Because you finally figured it out?He thought for a second.No, Ginger.Because she wasnt just fancy and self absorbed on the outside.Id have been happy to carry her through the muck and offal of the farm.But then I found out she was like that on the inside.I never would have guessed how much we have in common.You have no idea.Now put your little head down.See if you can get some sleep...Ill say good night, she said.You dont have to say good night.Leave the line open.Ill be right here if you need me.We cant do that, she said.Our phones will run out of juice and then we wont be able to call anyone.You think youll be okay?Im fine.Kind of embarrassed.That was impulsive.Im not usually that impetuous, calling a man I hardly know in the middle of the night.Hardly know?I cant think of a woman I know better, he said.We know each other very well.If we sign off will you promise if you need to talk, youll just call back?No matter what time it is?Sure, she said.But Ill try not to.Sometimes talking helps, he said.God, never tell anyone in my family I said that, okay?Okay, she said with a laugh.* * * Matt held the phone against his chest.Look out, he told himself.Danger, danger.He wanted to be there with her.If he was there, she could roll over, and hed comfort her.He wanted to get his arms around her, hold her, whisper to her that what she was feeling seemed reasonable.And that she was no longer alone.Hed take that job in a heartbeat.A New Hope        Nine The fatigue of ALS mightve slowed Winnie down but it didnt keep her from staging her own wedding festivities.She rested in the morning after breakfast and a bath, generously tended to by her new full time nurse, Lin Su.Then she was good for a little company and lunch and with an afternoon rest, she had at least a few hours of socializing and dinner.Winnies schedule of meals and rests had to be carefully monitored and protected to ensure she wasnt weak or fatigued because she had planned activities!As if Im surprised, Grace said.Grace had every reason to expect the Headly family to be wonderful.After all, Troy was.What she wasnt prepared for was to find them more wonderful than she could have imagined.Troys mother, Donna, was thoughtful, funny and clearly a strong head of the family.Burt Headly was a big, good natured cuddle bear, always smiling, always hugging, perpetually laughing, grandchildren climbing on him all the time.When Troy and twenty one year old Sam stood beside their father, the resemblance in looks and temperament was so obvious people would put them in the same family without knowing them.Troys sister, Jess, was very like her mother in both looks and that quiet authority.Her husband, Rick, the firefighter from Morro Bay, fit into the family perfectlystrong, good natured, patient.And the three children, ages two, four and six, had piles of energy but Troy, Rick and Burt ran them up and down the beach until they were sandy, gamey and worn out.When they came to what was Winnies house, the Headly adults kept a hand on each child, careful that they wouldnt mess up the place or tire Winnie.Donna and Jess were the most interested in Graces skating career.I would give anything to see you skate, Jess said.And Id be happy to do that for you, but Troy might have a fit, she said, smoothing a hand over her tummy.Its not as though Id take a hard fall and hurt the baby, but hes gotten very protective.I have the matter taken care of, Winnie said.I had my assistant from San Francisco send us the DVDs.Mother, you didnt, Grace said.We cant ask the whole family to watch home movies!But wed love to, Donna said.And after the baby comes, once youre on your feet and have had a chance to practice a little, we want the real thing.The girls are going to be so excited!Jess said.After a family dinner that Donna and Grace joined forces to cook, the women and kids sat around the great room with the DVDs playing on the big flat screen, exclaiming over each jump, spiral, arabesque, axel and double axel.After just a few minutes, the men were on the deck with drinks, except for Mikhail, who was giving commentary on the skating.Pretty soon the little girls and Jesss four year old son were twirling around the living room, making them all laugh.Troy, Donna and Burt hustled everyone out of Winnies house before it was very late and Grace was able to help her mother get ready for bed.When were not in wedding mode, Lin Su will be able to settle me for the night, Winnie said apologetically.Im happy to do it, Mama.Ive had many reasons to resent this blasted condition, but I think tonight brought home to me the best reason to resent it.She sighed.I think you and Troy will have lots of children.I think youll be wonderful with them, even if you dont have the stamina to turn them into great athletes.She sniffed.I hope heaven has a good window, Grace.I really want to watch them grow.Oh, Mama...Were not going to snivel and drown in self pity, Winnie said.Instead were going to get you married.You picked a good one.How you did that without my advice, Ill never know.Grace laughed through sentimental tears.Its a wonder, isnt it?His family, Winnie said.Nice people.I think they like you.I hope so.Theyre going to tell all their friends that youre a champion, Winnie said.Youll be a better mother than I was.Im not so sure about that...Work on it, then.I was better than my mother, youll be better than I was, your daughters will be better than you.But Grace...Izzy, she said, adding the name Grace had gone by as a girl.Tell me one thing.I was a hard mother, I know, but did you ever doubt I loved you?Grace shook her head.No.Your love was fierce.Ah, Winnie said, satisfied, settling back and letting her eyes close softly.A little controlling, Grace added.A little?came a voice from the bedroom doorway.Mikhail stood there watching them.He held up a DVD in a plastic sleeve.If the Empress is ready for bed, we will watch another show together.Now the house is quiet and the little dancers have gone home to bed.I can tuck her in for you.Do you feel up to it, Mama?Grace asked.Im fine, Grace.But you must be tired.I rememberthat was the first thing about being a little pregnantso tired.Go and rest.Leave any more cleanup to the babys father.Grace kissed her mothers forehead while Mikhail settled into the comfy chair beside the bed.Grace didnt bother with anything in the kitchen or great room.She wasnt too tired to think about the way things had turned out.She felt reasonably sure this ALS, with the limits it put on Winnies life, had softened her.Winnie had always been a difficult, stubborn woman; their relationship had been challenging.If Winnie wasnt sick right now the chances were good that theyd be fighting over all these detailsthe wedding, the grooms family, everything.That was the history theyd hadone power struggle after another with very brief periods of affection.Now, when it was almost too late, Winnie was becoming the kind of mother Grace had always longed for.Tolerant.Warm.Rather than cry about it, shed be grateful for this.It was a gift.* * * Winnie sat up in the bed.The television was a gray blur; the DVD had stopped playing.She looked at her phoneit was the middle of the night.It was the snoring combined with her full bladder that had roused her.She turned on the light and stretched a leg toward Mikhails knee, giving him a kick.He jolted awake, startled.Shits of the gods, he grumbled.You should go to bed.Youre snoring.You are sure it wasnt you, snoring?he said.The snoring had a Russian accent.Go to bed, she said, looking at her phone.What are you doing?he asked.I call Grace when I have to get up, when I need something, she said.Ach, let the girl rest.I will get what you need.She smirked.The toilet?I will take you.Dont be ridiculous!Im not peeing in front of you!Of course not!he barked.I take you, you hold the bars, I leave, I close door, you sit, you make it rain, you do what you doI suppose you dont shake it off like a man.Then you can pull yourself up on the bars.Then what?Whistle?She was shocked silent for a moment.But then she smiled.Ill call Grace.No, let the child sleep.You want I should get you some water?First the bathroom, she said, scooting to the very edge of the bed.He stooped, put her slippers on her slender feet and pulled her up.Lean on me, he said.Im not a young man to carry you, but you can still walk ten steps.Youll be fine, then back in the bed, yes?Mikhail, she said with a laugh.Make it rain?Really?You have trouble to understand meaning of this?I trust you know what to do.Im going to do it right here if you keep making me laugh, she said.Please, no, he said.I am wearing the stocking feet.Winnie did all she could to comply, though a middle of the night trip to the bathroom had never been so entertaining.She did as he suggested, holding the handicap rail beside the commode until he left.Then, adjusting her nightgown, lowered herself, made it rainwith a little laughter at the thoughtand then stood.And flushed.Oh, how she wished she could whistle.There was a little light tapping.Yes, come in.Im waiting for you, she said.Im going to get a whistle!Shits of the gods, he muttered.Come, your highness, he said, tucking her arm in his.Is not good for your rest to have so much talking in the night.In bed you go.Come, come.He held the sheets back, lifted her feet to help her, took the slippers off and covered her up.Then he returned to the chair, pulled the throw over him and stretched his legs out.He crossed his arms over his chest.What are you doing?Going again to sleep.Go to bed!Thats uncomfortable!Ach, is perfect.Is excellent.I never had better sleep.Stop with the talking.Youll never sleep!You are correct!I will never sleep!Someone cannot shut her royal mouth!Enough!She looked at him for a long moment, then reluctantly turned off the light and lay down.In the dark he said, If I am right here, Ill know if youre dead, he said.How will you know?she asked.It will finally be quiet.* * * Troy, his brother and dad, Cooper and Spencer, set up on the beach for the wedding.There were tables for the food, provided by Carrie.An arch that Iris and Ginger had covered with flowers had to be anchored.There was a stack of beach blankets that Cooper stored in the basement of the bar and a pile of canvas and aluminum beach chairs for people to use.There were a few picnic tables around, too heavy to move closer to the party but useful just the same.The flower van was parked in the drive of Winnies house; the catering van would be parked on the beach as the time drew near.In addition to food and flowers, Cooper arranged for a couple of kegs and several large bottles of wine.Twenty or so people had been formally invited, another twenty five had been informally invited, still another twenty five would probably show up.Troy was told to get ready downstairs in their little apartment while Grace would be on the main level with her mother.Because it was her mothers event, too, a beautician had been called to do hair and makeup.Winnie could not have done it herself and God knew Grace couldnt do it for her.Iris and Ginger came over early to bring flowers and help; Ginger brought the dress.Several times during the week Grace had looked at her wedding gown, a work in progress.Shed tried it on a couple of times and been happy with it.It was so different now, less than an hour before the vows, Graces hair pulled back and caught up in curls that cascaded down in back, makeup finished.She stepped into the dress, Iris closed up the many small buttons in the back, and she turned toward the mirror on the inside of the closet door.Oh, my God, Winnie said in a breath.Stunning.Beyond stunning.Its beautiful, Ginger, Iris said.Youre amazing.Thank you, she said a bit shyly.It was a joy.It almost looks like Pippa Middletons dress, Grace said.Oh, Ginger, Im never going to be able to thank you properly for all youve done for me.Well, that goes both ways, she said.I came to this little town to get a break, a changed perspective, and look what I found.A job I love, good friends, a new lease on life.A lot of that is made possible by you, Grace.You do love that little flower shop, she said.You treat it like your own.I love it, she said.If you think I could stay on awhile, Im willing.Theres a place for you as long as you want it.Thank you, Ive been very happy there.When the wedding is done and things calm down a little I might look for a small apartment or something.I should give Ray Anne her life back.She laughed conspiratorially.Ray Anne and Al must really have to plot to have any time alone together.Graces eyes lit up.I know what I can do, she said.When the wedding is over and Troys family leaves, hes giving up his apartment.Theres no point in paying rent there while were living here.The first thing were going to do is bring his big leather sectional and TV over here for our downstairs.Im going to need to find something furnished.Grace raised one brow.Does it have to be large?Could a studio do the trick?Sure.Of course.I hope Ill continue to spend lots of time with Ray Anne and some of my new friends.Its just where I hang my hat...How about my loft above the store?Grace asked.Troys parents are using it while theyre in town, but soon it will be empty.I dont have any plans for it.It was first shock and then her features were taken over by disbelief.Youd let me rent it from you?No, Im afraid not, Ginger.I will only let you have it if you continue to work in the shop and it will be rent free.I couldnt!she protested.Thats just too much.Nonsense, Winnie said.What use does Grace have for it now?Well, we could store my furs there...Mother!Grace said with a laugh.She looked at Ginger.There wont be furs to store, she said.My mother was very fond of them, overly fond, but we agree there is no use for furs here.Well keep her warm.But youll keep at least one to remember me by, wont you?Winnie asked.Absolutely, Grace said.If it will make a good rug.Youre incorrigible.I spoiled you as a child and what has it gotten me?There was a light tapping at the door.Mikhail poked his head in.There is time before the vows and a groom is pacing out here.Put his mind at ease, my dove.Tell him you still agree to this marriage.Is he showered and dressed?Grace asked.Because no one touches me unless he is showered and dressed.Im showered and dressed!Troy yelled from the other room.He has the nerves.Come and soothe him, pupsik.Hes making me want a drink.Grace walked out to the great room where she noticed that Sam and Rick were sitting patiently on the sofa while Troy appeared to be pacing.When they saw her, they jumped to their feet.What in the world is the matter?she asked him.Are you having second thoughts?Me?God, no!I just want to get this done before you come to your senses!Well, I was all settled until I met your family and now...She grinned at him.Im thinking I could be better off with young Sam.Sam grinned hugely.Awesome.Dont even joke about that, Troy said.He has no morals.Then he reached for her hand.Come with me.They walked outside onto the deck.Below them on the beach they could see the wedding activitiesCarries buffet tables, the bridal arch, people beginning to gather.She smoothed his collar; he wore the shirt she had ordered for him, a black linen Tommy Bahama beachcomber style, a stark contrast to her white.He ran a finger around the low cut cowl neck of the wedding gown.Youre so beautiful, he said.He pulled a box out of his pants pocket.Lets see if this works.He opened the box to her gaze, and she sighed.It was a beautiful string of pearls.It couldnt be more perfect.I had a little help.I asked the girls.Do you like them?Theyre beautiful.I feel bad, Troyweve been so rushed, I havent gotten you a gift.His hand slid down over her tummy.Oh, I think you have.Its going to be the gift that keeps on giving, too, she said with a little laugh.She turned so he could fasten the pearls around her neck.Then he put his lips there.She leaned back against him for a moment.Tired, honey?he asked, his arms circling her waist, holding her.When this is done, Im going to sleep for a month.He turned her to face him.Did you eat anything?She nodded.I know how something like this will go.I might not get a chance to sample our own wedding food.Were going to have a nice big plate made up and Ill sneak it into the house for later.We can have a picnic in bed.She laughed and touched his cheek.Your favorite kind of picnic.Luckily, the bride and groom get to sneak away.We dont have to be the last to leave.Iris and Seth are going to take the arch and van back to the flower shop and Carrie assures me there is nothing for us to help withshes got it covered.She has a little help.Once we go down there, were off duty.Except for Winnie.Rick has Coopers little Rhino all cleaned up and parked in the garage.Hes going to be in charge of getting her up and down the hill.Lin Su is going to come to the beach for a while, then shell help Winnie settle in for the night.You can start your month of sleep right after you promise to love me forever.I think I did that already.Gracie, I didnt think I could be this happy.Thank you.I love you.Took you a while to get right with that idea, didnt it?A couple of days, maybe.You havent doubted me since, have you?She shook her head.Not for a second.You ever doubt me?No, Gracie.Not for a second.He glanced at the beach.In fifteen minutes the judge will be here, everyone will be ready and we can do it.Should I pull the trigger on this event?Do it, she said.He left her on the deck and went inside.He told Rick to deliver Winnie to the beach where a comfortable chair waited for hershe insisted there would be no wheelchair at her daughters wedding.It wouldnt do much good in the sand anyway.Iris got her flowers and handed a beautiful bouquet to Grace.Ginger and Mikhail got ready to make their way down all those stairs.Showtime, Troy said.* * * Ginger wept a little when the vows were exchanged, but not because she was seized by sadness from her own past.Just the opposite.Shed never been to a wedding quite like this.It was more than a union of lovers, almost as if best friends were joining together to make a perfect family life.She was so moved by the loving exchange between Grace and Troy, by the joy shared among the guests, a tear or two escaped.And she was hardly the only one.As she glanced around she saw that many shared her sentiment.They were indeed a beautiful bride and groom.The only person who didnt seem to be completely charmed by the casual beach wedding was Ray Anne.I dont go to weddings in flip flops, she groused.I cant even move in these shoes.Quite a few of her friends and Al found humor in the fact that if Ray couldnt dress up and wear her spike heels, it put her out of sorts.Everyone else seemed to be delighted by the circumstances.Even the bride was soon carrying her sandals in one hand, lifting her gown with the other.But Ginger noticed that before long Al was carrying Ray Anne across the beach to the stairs to Coopers bar where his truck was parked.Ginger enjoyed the goings on.Children ran and played and there were lots of childrenTroys nieces and nephew and tons of local kids whose parents were at the wedding.People gathered around the few picnic tables, on beach chairs, enjoying an endless supply of drinks and delicious finger foods.She had on a strappy sundress shed found in her closet from years ago, something she hadnt fit into in a long time but had always loved.It was flattering with a jagged hem that fell in an asymmetrical pattern below her knees, like many overlying scarves.The straps crisscrossed in the back.It was an emerald color that really brought out her green eyes.And the late afternoon sun and breeze gave her a rosy glow.She started out in sandals but in no time she was barefoot like so many others.She enjoyed the party, brief though it was.Sam flirted with her.Well, Sam flirted with everyone and a couple of hours into the reception he seemed to have found himself an interested young woman.Ginger didnt know if she was a guest or one of the many who happened down the beach and took advantage of the party.She was wearing a summer dress so Ginger guessedguest.This was by far the largest gathering she had attended so she was able to visit with new friends and meet a few people for the first time.The couple who had once worked for Winnie and had later trained Grace in the flower business were there.Cooper had taken it upon himself to tend bar, assisting Rawley and Carrie.All her new women friends had their men presentLou brought her husband, Gina was with Mac, the former town deputy.The Grants were there and Spencer, Devon and the kids.All the usual suspects.It was around seven, the sun barely lowering in the sky, when the crowd began to thin.Winnie was whisked away in the Rhino, Mikhail was climbing the stairs to her house, the bride and groom were saying goodbye, the bridal arch was carefully loaded into the flower van.Cooper and some of the men were taking charge of trash while Carrie was packing up the little remaining food and Rawley dismantled the serving tables.They were drifting away in all directionssome going up the stairs to Coopers because there was a parking lot behind the bar, some heading down the beach to the marina lot, some taking off in their beach mobiles or vans.Since Ginger had come from the flower shop in the van with Iris, she was on her own.Iris offered to drop her at home or the shop, but Ginger was quite content to walk slowly across the beach and just enjoy the early evening.The beach was a beautiful place, in all its moodsgray and chilly, stormy, sunny or wet.She strolled, kicking along the cold waters edge.When she got near the marina, she saw a familiar face.He was leaning against the front bumper of his truck, one leg crossed over the other, holding a bottled water, watching her, smiling.Matt.Let me guess.Youre stalking me, she said.Nah.Just happened to be in the neighborhood.What are you doing here?I wondered how youd feel after the wedding.You wouldnt go to Peytons ceremony.Memories, you said.You should have told me you wanted to drive down.I couldve invited you.I was allowed a guest.I knew youd be busy, he said.Working.She tilted her head to one side.What if Id been with a guy?If youd planned that, you would have mentioned it.I dont know everything about you, Ginger, but I know youre honest.And up front.Youve told me a lot more about your issues than Ive told you about mine.
