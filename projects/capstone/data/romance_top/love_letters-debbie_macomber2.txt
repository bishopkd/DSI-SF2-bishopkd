The anger had gone out of his eyes, replaced with hopelessness.His look nearly broke her.I know you dont want to be here, she whispered.You can say that again, he bit off.Maggie had been looking forward to this weekend for months.It was exactly the break they needed.Roy worked too hard.He left the house before either of the boys was awake and often wasnt home until their sons were ready for bed.One thing she would say about her husband.He loved his children and was a good father.No matter how tired he was, Roy took time to play with his sons, to read to them or share in bath time.But right after they were down he crashed, exhausted, from a long day of running the familys construction company.His father had recently retired, and since then much of the responsibility for the business had fallen on Roys shoulders.Fearing they were growing further and further apart, Maggie had convinced Roy to take this time off, setting the date far enough in advance that hed be able to work it into his schedule.When her in laws had heard about this mini vacation, they had offered to stay with the boys and as a bonus had paid for the weekend.It couldnt have worked out better  until  well, that was certainly a topic she didnt want to dwell on.I wouldnt be here at all if it wasnt for my parents, Roy reminded her.He walked over to the window and looked out.Maggie had the strong impression he wasnt enjoying the view; probably he hadnt even noticed the beauty spread out before him like a masterfully designed patchwork quilt.The green and blue colors blended together, creating a radiant picture of the beauty of the Pacific Northwest.I know youd rather be anyplace but here with me.He couldnt have made it any more clear.He frowned and looked away.Suddenly it felt as if this attempt to save their marriage was utterly useless.Tears sprang to her eyes.Shed managed to keep them at bay on the endless drive over Snoqualmie Pass and through the heavy traffic by Tacoma before they reached Cedar Cove, but no longer.Silently, wet tendrils rolled down her cheeks and she slumped onto the side of the bed and hung her head.It all seemed so pointless.Although she didnt make a sound, Roy must have sensed her distress because he turned around and exhaled.After a moment he sat down next to her on the bed, the mattress dipping with his weight.He placed his arm around her shoulders and leaned his head against hers.Desperate for his warmth and love, Maggie turned toward her husband and wrapped her arms around his middle, clinging to him.She buried her face in his shoulder and softly sobbed.Roy comforted her and stroked the back of her head.Im sorry, he whispered.Unable to speak for the emotion that clogged her throat, she nodded.Im trying, Maggs.I know.Her words were little more than a whisper.Give me time, okay?Again she nodded.Lifting her head, she wiped the moisture from her face.She wrapped a strand of long dark hair around her ear and sniffled once.Roy offered her a tentative smile and she responded with one of her own.Ill unpack our suitcases, she whispered, thinking if she did something physical it would help ease the emotion that threatened to break down into sobs.Okay.He lifted both pieces of luggage onto the bed for her.It took only a few minutes to hang up their clothes and set out what else they needed.She noticed that Roy had brought along a paperback novel.Maggie couldnt remember the last time shed seen her husband reading for pleasure.For herself, Maggie read voraciously.It used to be they would talk about the books theyd read and would often read one at the same time, but that had been years ago, before Roy became so heavily involved in the construction company  before the boys were born.Are you ready for lunch?Roy asked, as if he felt the need to lighten the mood.Sure.Actually, she wasnt the least bit hungry, and she doubted that Roy was, either.This was his way of letting her know he was making an effort.Maggie deeply appreciated the fact that he was willing to try.Ill ask Jo Marie for a suggestion.What are you in the mood for?her husband asked.Maggie had to think about it.Seeing that were close to salt water, how about fish and chips?He nodded eagerly.Good idea.Roy led the way down the stairs and into the kitchen, where they found Jo Marie.She was on the phone but smiled when she saw them and raised her index finger, indicating that she would be only a moment.Sure enough, she was off the phone a short while later.Were looking for a recommendation for lunch.Some place that serves fish and chips, Maggie added.Oh, theres a great place not far from the Pancake Palacein fact, the two restaurants share the same parking lot.I dont think Ive ever tasted better fish than Queens.She handed them a brochure shed had printed up with a list of local restaurants and circled Queens.Thanks, Maggie said, as they headed toward the front door.My pleasure.The innkeeper offered Maggie a thumbs up as if to say she was pleased that whatever was wrong between the two had been resolved.Oh, how Maggie wished that were the case.Roy held open the car door for her, which was a surprise.Maggie forgot the last time hed done that.Generally, they were both too busy ushering the boys to the car to see to those kinds of niceties.Thank you.Roy then surprised her again by leaning down and kissing her.Once more, Maggie felt tears gather in her eyes but quickly blinked them away while her husband walked around to the other side of the vehicle.He started the engine and glanced down at the brochure Jo Marie had drawn.It doesnt seem that far away.Fish and chips does sound good.Roy reached over and gently squeezed her hand, and for just a moment, a very brief moment, Maggie could almost pretend that everything would work out between them.Even in the worst of it she had to believe Roy wanted their marriage to survive   They found Queens without a problem.It was a hole in the wall sort of place without fancy furnishings or an extensive menu.The special for the day, fresh salmon, was listed on an erasable whiteboard close to the cash register.Once inside, a waitress with a name tag that said Nikki handed them plastic coated menus.They were instructed to seat themselves.Seeing that it was a bit beyond the lunch hour, there were plenty of booths to choose from.Maggie read over the menu and chose the two piece fish and chips option.One piece would probably be enoughshe hadnt enjoyed much of an appetite latelybut she wasnt sure of the size of the fish.When Nikki came for their order, Maggie asked for a two piece combo and Roy ordered the three piece plate, which offered coleslaw along with the chips.It didnt take long for their order to come up.Right away, Roy dug into his meal.Maggie, too, but with less gusto.After her first bite, she had to admit Jo Marie was right.These were some of the best fish and chips shed ever tasted.I was surprised at Collin, Roy commented, after hed licked some ketchup off his fingertips.He didnt cry when he saw that we were both leaving.I was surprised, too, Maggie admitted.Their three year old didnt like being left behind.To hear him sob, one would think he was being abandoned for life.My mother probably had something to do with that, Roy said, and reached for another french fry.Knowing her, she might have told him he could have ice cream for dinner.She does love spoiling the boys.Its a grandmothers job, and my mother takes it seriously.Maggie wished they had family closer.Roys parents had retired and spent the winters in Arizona and the summer months traveling in their motor home.It was their goal to visit every national park in the country.They were well on their way to achieving their dream.Maggies parents lived in California.How is Collin doing in his soccer?Roy asked.Great.Just the other day, he asked me if his daddy was going to coach him the way you do Jaxon.Roy smiled, and for the first time that day his smile reached his eyes.Her husband had coached Collins older brothers team for the last two years.It was hard for Collin to stand on the sidelines when he was just as eager to play soccer as his big brother.During one game, Collin couldnt hold back any longer.Right in the middle of the game, he dashed from the sidelines and ran onto the field.Itd taken Roy and the referee to catch him.Maggie reminded Roy of the incident.He chuckled and shook his head.Hes going to be a good little player.I think Collin might even be more athletically inclined than Jaxon.Roy thought for a moment and then shrugged.Its hard to tell, but what I do know is that Jax plays with heart.He does everything with heart.Their sons were true joys.Maggie loved being a stay at home mother.It was difficult to watch Roy work as many hours as he did.He was often gone twelve to fourteen hours a day.But she doubted that his hours would change if she worked outside the home.Lately  no, she wouldnt let her mind dwell on that; she couldnt, or shed slowly go mad.Roy was a man driven to succeed.Maggie felt it was her job to be his support, his helper, and to be at home for their children, especially in these formative early years.Thankfully, Roys business enabled her to do that.Many times, especially recently, she didnt think that Roy understood her role in his home or life.From the outside looking in, it wasnt much.She didnt get a paycheck, didnt manage his schedule or handle the paperwork.Her role was to simply see to everything else so that Roy could go off to the job without worrying about what was happening at home.She took care of the house and the boys, and offered her husband encouragement and emotional support.They talked nonstop about the boys while they enjoyed their lunch.Maggie found that she could laugh, and it felt amazingly good.She could almost forget   All at once, Roy went quiet.Do you realize all weve talked about are Jaxon and Collin?We mentioned your parents, she reminded him.True, he agreed, but only in relation to them staying with the boys.He was right.What would you like to talk about?she asked, not understanding his concern.To her, the important fact was that they were communicating.Theyd done far too little of that in the last few months.Its good, I suppose, Roy said.I love my sons, and I know you do, too.Youre a good mother, Maggie, a very good mother.Our sons are lucky to have you.Roy didnt pay compliments easily, and his words meant a great deal.She nearly choked up when she spoke.Thank you.And youre a wonderful father.It wasnt an exaggeration or a ricocheted compliment.She meant every word.We need to take the boys out of the equation for a few minutes, Roy suggested.You wanted this time away for us to work on our marriage, right?Yes.Then lets talk.Okay.The word stuck in her throat like a peach pit.Her husband was silent for a long moment.Weve both made mistakes.She looked away and nodded.I dont want to focus on our mistakes.At this point, it isnt going to help.Instead of tearing each other down, Id like to look for ways to build each other up.Roy went silent, then pushed his half eaten lunch aside.Youre right.She smiled.It was far too infrequent for her husband to admit she was right about anything, especially lately.Whats that smile about?Roy asked.And dont bother denying it.I saw you grin just now.Is it because I was willing to admit youre right?She blinked several times and, try as she might, couldnt squelch a smile.Okay, Maggie said, lets focus here.We agree; we love our children.This time is for us, though, just you and me.Talking about the boys is off limits.Okay.They smiled across the table at each other.Maggie thought to mention the work project that had taken up so much of Roys efforts in the last three months.Unfortunately, that led to other, more sensitive, subjects shed hoped to avoid.Katherine, for one.She bristled just thinking of the other woman.No, the subject of Katherine was definitely one to be avoided, and unfortunately the other woman was tied to the job.Roy looked like he was about to say something important.He opened his mouth and then quickly closed it as if he, too, had thought better of it.They sat in silence for a full five minutes.As each second ticked away, Maggie had the sad realization that while they deeply loved each other and their two sons, they had become strangers.Their relationship had dissolved to the point that they lived together and shared a bed, but they had become little more than roommates.Maggie felt her heart swell inside her chest as the sadness nearly overwhelmed her.You used to talk to me, she whispered, gazing down at her plate.Oh come on, Maggs, dont go there.Okay, fine, I wont.This is exactly what I feared would happen; youre going to use this weekend to remind me what a horrible husband I am and how badly Ive let you down.No  I dont want that.Fine, Ill admit it.Im a rotten husband, but the truth is, you havent been much of a wife, either.His words came at her like nails out of a roofers gun, striking her squarely in the chest.The pain was so sharp and the hit so solidly on target that she could barely breathe.Roy instantly looked contrite.I didnt mean that the way it sounded.I think you did, she whispered, and reached for her purse.She was about to slide out of the booth when her phone rang.She hesitated, and reached inside her purse and froze.The phone chirped again, louder this time, more insistent, as if the message was highly important, urgent.Maggie read the name on caller ID and then glanced toward her husband.Its your mother.Roy frowned and scooted from the booth.She wouldnt be phoning this soon if it wasnt serious.5     After my conversation with Peggy, I had the feeling that Id given my friend the wrong impression regarding my curiosity about Mark.I loved my husband, and that wasnt going to change.I thought about the letter I received from him, the one hed asked a friend to give me in case something happened to him while he was on his tour of duty.I kept his last letter to me in the nightstand next to my bed.I read it shortly after I got definitive word that Paul wouldnt be returning from Afghanistan.His remains had been identified and returned to Washington, D. C. , where he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.Id attended the ceremony early in June.I hadnt looked at the letter since that time.I simply couldnt bear to read Pauls last words, his love letter to me, again.For a number of months after I learned Paul and several others had gone down in a helicopter I physically felt his presence with me.He seemed close and so very real.It was almost as if I could reach out and touch him.In retrospect, I believe that was my minds way of dealing with this overwhelming sense of grief.I so desperately wanted Paul to be alive that I conjured him up in my mind.At times I could almost hear him speak  not with audible words that I heard with my ears, but words that spoke to my heart.That hadnt happened in a long while now, not since I received his letter.I missed that.At times I desperately longed for another chance to feel him with me  and didnt.Instead, I was alone, so very alone.In an effort to distract myself from thinking about Paul, I busied myself with projects Id been putting off.Although it was summer, I tackled spring cleaning chores that I hadnt quite gotten around to doing.Today it was the kitchen cupboards.I took the glasses down from a cupboard and set them along the countertop.Need any help with that?I turned around to find Mark standing in the doorway leading into the kitchen.I hesitated, standing on top of the step stool I kept in the kitchen.The time Mark found me on a ladder, hed nearly gone ballistic.Wed had a terrible argument about it.Hed ended up walking off the job and Id threatened to sue him.Thankfully, it didnt take long for the anger to cool on both sides.Since then, Mark had eased up on his dictatorial ways and Id stopped making threats.Wed treaded pretty lightly with each other ever since.Im tackling some spring cleaning.Its August, he reminded me.It seems youve been doing a lot of spring cleaning lately.So Im a tad bit late.I wasnt making excuses, although if he asked, I had several good ones.I didnt know why it concerned him, anyway.So what if I was behind schedule?You know what they say: Better late than never.He eyed the step stool and seemed to debate whether he should say anything.Apparently, he decided against it.He reached for a mug sitting on the crowded counter and headed toward my coffeepot.Mind if I help myself?Go ahead.Should I brew you one while Im here?It seemed Mark had something on his mind; otherwise, he wouldnt be interested in coffee or in me joining him.If I knew anything about Mark, it was that he wasnt one to sit around and shoot the breeze.Nor was he one who indulged in idle conversation.If he had something on his mind, it didnt stay there long.Coffee?he repeated, holding up a second mug.I didnt realize that I hadnt answered him.Sure, I could use a break.After he brewed two cups he walked outside with his coffee, which led me to believe I was supposed to follow him, so I did.I found him on the back deck off the living area, where my guests most often congregated.He leaned against the railing with his elbows braced against the freshly painted surface.It sure is a beautiful afternoon.His gaze scanned the waterfront.It is.August was often like this.The green trees and the crystal blue waters never seemed more vibrant.I hadnt traveled extensively, but Paul had, and hed reassured me that there was no place on earth as lush and gorgeous as Puget Sound when the sun was overhead.I didnt figure Mark had come to discuss the weather; I had known him long enough to understand that he didnt like to be rushed.Hed tell me whatever was on his mind when he was good and ready.Did your guests arrive?All but Peter McConnell.Mark turned around, his face tightening.Peter McConnell?Not the same Peter McConnell who lives in Cedar Cove?Yes, one and the same.Peter phoned for a reservation earlier this morning.Marks gaze narrowed.Peter has a house in town.Yes, I know.I believe this has something to do with some plumbing work hes having done on his house.Mark made a harrumphing sound as if to say he didnt believe a word of it.And you mean to say he hasnt got a single friend in this entire town who was willing to put him up for the night?Not even his own daughter?I didnt ask him.Besides, Im not about to turn away a paying customer.Mark stood his ground.In this case, I think it might be a good idea.I could feel my ire rising.I inhaled a steadying breath and then, as calmly as I could manage, I said, Mark, stop right now.Youre stepping over the line.What line?The one I just drew in the sand.I could feel my ears heating up, which was a good indication I was about to blow my cool.Who I choose to accept as a guest in my inn is my business.I spoke slowly, making sure he heard and understood each and every word.Mark looked back at the water view and didnt speak for several seconds.Tension seemed to vibrate between us.Finally, he exhaled and said, I dont trust the man, and if you knew him better, you wouldnt, either.I hadnt heard anything about Peter McConnell one way or the other.I glared back at Mark.Apparently, he got the message, because he looked away first.If I were you Id collect my fee up front.He owes you money?Just take my word for it, Jo Marie.I will, I promised, my irritation vanishing as quickly as it came.Did you have something else on your mind?He returned my stare with a blank look, as if the reason hed stopped by had slipped his mind.Oh yeah.I have an estimate for the gazebo.You already gave it to me; I trust you to be fair.He dug into his shirt pocket and withdrew a folded piece of paper.I got everything tallied here.The price of lumber went up in the last week, so I had to revise the figure I gave you earlier.If you want to hold off building the gazebo, Ill understand.I read over the formal estimate.The earlier bid hed given me was off the top of his head.This time hed priced the materials, added the cost of his labor, and written me a formal proposal.From the look of it, hed taken the better part of the morning putting it together.The bottom line was only a two hundred dollar increase over the estimate hed told me earlier.Its fine.You want me to get started, then?I do.He grinned as if he was glad for the business, although to hear him, he had more work than he knew what to do with, which was probably true.Did you see the reader board at the hardware store?I asked.He gave me an odd look.Yeah.What about it?Theyre looking for an experienced sales associate.That kind of work would be right up your alley.Mark frowned.Why would I want to work at the hardware store?The answer should be obvious.Youd be good at it, Mark.You know how to fix just about anything.You could help a lot of people.He shook his head as if the very idea went against the grain.I help a lot of people now.But youd have a regular paycheck and benefits.I have all the benefits I need, thank you very much.Okay, okay, dont get bent out of shape; it was just an idea.A bad one.He scratched the side of his head and frowned as if Id insulted him by the mere suggestion.I heard a car door shut in the distance and figured that either the Porters had returned from lunch or Peter McConnell was ready to check into his room.Despite what Id said, Id take Marks warning seriously, but I wasnt going to turn McConnell away simply because Mark didnt trust the man.Mark walked around to the front of the inn with me.Id guessed right.It was Peter.Right away, the Mark Taylor who Id always known to be taciturn and short tempered took on an entirely new persona.He raised his arm and waved to Peter, and called out a cheery greeting.Peter.How you doing, buddy?I looked at Mark as if seeing him for the first time.My latest arrival stopped and looked as shocked as I was.Peter was in his late forties, I guessed  maybe early fifties.His hair was completely gray, and he was reasonably good looking.I had to assume he lived alone, since hed requested a room for one.Peter looked from me to Mark and then back again.Oh hi, Mark.Listen, if youre worried about what I owe you   Forget about it, Mark cajoled, as if however much was due him was of little consequence.Mark glanced over his shoulder and shot me a warning look.I wasnt entirely sure what his message was, but I could tell he wanted me to keep quiet.Jo Marie was telling me youre having some work done at the house.Plumbing.The waters been shut off and wont be turned back on until tomorrow morning.Better on the house than having a doc work on your plumbing, Mark said, and laughed as if hed found himself highly amusing.Then he looked at me and whispered under his breath, I wonder if he paid his water bill.I wouldnt know, I whispered back.Mark turned his attention back to the other man.Listen, old buddy, theres no need to pay for a night at the inn.You can spend it with me at my house.Ive got a spare room.Peter hesitated.You sure?Why not?Were friends, right?Right  but I wouldnt want to inconvenience you.His look said he was skeptical, and frankly, I didnt blame him.Its no problem, Mark said, with a wave of his hand.Im glad to do it.Still, Peter hesitated.I guess that would be all right, and it would save me a couple hundred bucks.No way did I charge that much for a room.I opened my mouth to contradict him but changed my mind.You okay with that, Jo Marie?Mark asked, directing the question at me with narrowed eyes.Sure, thats no problem on my end.But I intended on letting Mark know I was onto his game.That your truck over there?Peter asked, looking over his shoulder.Sure is.Go to my place and Ill join you in a minute.Mark was silent until Peter was out of earshot, and then, before I had a chance to say anything, Mark spoke.You can get upset with me later, and as for the money youre losing, you can deduct it from my bid for the gazebo.Why are you doing this?I asked.The man made no sense to me.Clearly, he disliked Peter McConnell.By his own words he didnt trust the other man, and yet hed invited him to spend the night in his home.Mark didnt look the least bit pleased.The hell if I know.He shook his head and walked away, leaving me to wonder if all common sense had deserted Mark Taylor.I retrieved our coffee mugs and returned to the kitchen, where I found Ellie Reynolds looking a bit lost and nervous.Oh hi, I said.Can I get you anything?No.Ive been waiting most of the afternoon for a phone call from Tom.And youre antsy.She shrugged.Weve never met, you see.Shed told me that earlier.And youve come a long way to meet him, I added, and the implication was more than just the distance.From the small amount of information Ellie had told me I knew that shed defied her mother in order to meet Tom.He cant have his phone in the shipyard.I have to wait until hes off work to hear from him, and that wont be for a couple more hours.I went for a walk and had lunch, but Im so nervous now I dont know what to do with myself.I wasnt sure what to tell her.I see youre cleaning out cupboards, she said, eyeing the glassware lined up along my countertop and the roll of shelving paper.Would you mind if I helped you?She wanted to help me clean.Ah   Thats what I do, you know.I didnt know.Youre a housekeeper?No, Im a professional organizer.People call me to organize their basements and garages or the entire house.Im actually good at that sort of thing.I always have been.And youve arranged kitchens?I could use the help, but it wasnt in me to ask a guest for this kind of professional advice without being willing to pay for it.Oh yes, Ive reorganized dozens of kitchens.Id be happy to pay you.Nonsense.Youd be saving me from going stir crazy.Without waiting for my approval, she looked at the cupboard where Id stored the glasses.Right away I knew what she was thinking.I store them here because theyre close to the breakfast room.Makes sense, but my guess is, you carry them out on a tray, right?Right.Why not put them in the cupboard above the dishwasher?I looked across the room and realized it made perfect sense.My goodness, I should have thought of that myself.For the next hour, Ellie had me switching things around the kitchen in an order I would never have thought of doing.Like she claimed, she was good at organizing, really good.We were so involved in our discussion that we almost didnt hear her cell phone.When she did, she took it out of her pocket and tapped on the surface.Her face broke into a huge smile.Its Tom.Seeing the joy that lit up her face reminded me of the way I felt when I received a call from Paul half a world away.That sense of happiness, of being connected, of being loved.It did me good to see that in someone else and know that I had experienced that same contentment once myself.6     Hello, Ellie said, gripping the phone and pressing it so hard against the side of her face that her ear ached.Hi, Tom answered, and he sounded as excited as Ellie was herself.So you got into Cedar Cove okay.Yes.Im at the Rose Harbor Inn now.Your flight was smooth?He was asking about more than just the time in the air, she realized.No problems.She didnt mention the troubles with her overprotective mother.I know your mom was dead set against this.My mother doesnt rule my life.Not from a lack of trying, however.I was sincere about talking to her, reassuring her.No.Ellie was adamant.Experience had taught her that nothing Tom said or did would ease Virginia Reynoldss worries.Over the years her mother had ruined Ellies dating prospects far too often.Shed lost count of the number of promising relationships that had gone down in flames, all because of her mothers fears.What angered Ellie was how she had let it happen.Well, not this time.Not with Tom.Im excited to see you, Tom said, his voice dipping slightly.Me, too  see you, I mean, she said with a nervous laugh.Ill be off work in another couple hours, but Id like to run home and change clothes before I come to the inn.I made dinner reservations at DDs on the Cove.We can walk there from the inn, but Id rather drive in case we want to go somewhere after dinner.Its perfect.I walked down to the waterfront shortly after I arrived.After being cooped up on the plane and then the bus, Ellie had felt the need to exercise her legs.Walking had helped her burn off nervous energy.I wont be more than fifteen minutes longer than the time I gave you.No problem.Im not going anywhere, Ellie assured him.The anticipation was all part of the excitement.Meeting Tom was like Christmas times ten.Are you nervous?she asked.Theyd spoken frequently, and she knew the sound of his voice, and she could hear the unease in him now.Very.Me, too.I dont want to disappoint you, he said.Thats my big fear, too.You couldnt  it isnt possible.Youre beautiful  inside and out; more than I ever expected to find in a woman.Ellie felt the same way about him.He made her feel cherished and loved.Compliments didnt roll off his tongue with practiced ease as if hed said the same words to a dozen women before her.He seemed just as ill at ease about this first meeting as she was, which reassured her.Promise me one thing, Tom whispered.I will if I can, she whispered back.That no matter what happens this weekend, that youll  He hesitated, as if he wasnt sure how best to continue.That Ill what?she urged, eager to reassure him nothing would change between them.Again he paused.I have to go.Personal phone calls are frowned upon.My supervisor is giving me the eagle eye.Ill be at the inn to pick you up as soon as I can manage.Ill be waiting, and Tom, please dont worry.Everything is going to work out.Thats my hope.Bye for now.Bye, she repeated.She returned her phone to her purse and heaved a sigh, wondering what it was that had Tom this concerned.Despite reassurances, he seemed to think shed be disappointed in him, and that wasnt possible.It simply wasnt possible.Seeing that Tom was going out of his way to make sure he looked his best for her, Ellie decided she should do the same.Grabbing her purse, she headed down the stairs once again.The woman shed met on the bus from the airport, Martha, had mentioned that her daughter owned a beauty salon on the main street running through Cedar Cove.Ellie had worn her hair straight and parted down the middle from the time she was in grade school.Shed taken this first leap toward independence  and that gave her courage to take an additional step and then another.Her heart beat hard and strong.It felt good to venture beyond what shed always known and always done.Jo Marie remained busy in her kitchen, implementing the suggestions Ellie had given her.She stood on the step stool, placing taupe shelf liner paper on the cupboards flat surface, although Ellie thought the current liner didnt look old or worn in the least.In fact, it looked almost new.Im going out for a while, Ellie told the innkeeper.Are you meeting Tom?Jo Marie asked.Not quite yet.Hes still at work.I thought Id walk down to Harbor Street.Theres a hair salon there  the lady I met on the bus mentioned that her daughter owned it.Marilyn?Yes, thats Marthas daughters name.Shes fabulous.The salon is across the street from the bakery and next to the Veterans of Foreign Wars post; you wont be able to miss it.Ellie was glad to hear it.Her sense of direction wasnt the best.Do you know if Marilyn takes walk ins, or should I call and make an appointment first?Jo Marie bit into her bottom lip.Ive always made an appointment, but I believe she takes walk ins as well.I guess Ill find out.If you need to wait, do it.Marilyns worth it.Thanks.I will.Ellie started to leave and then stopped.I was thinking of changing my hairstyle.Change it how?Jo Marie asked, cocking her head to one side as if looking at her with fresh eyes.It suits you the way you wear it now.Im looking for sexy, Ellie explained with a soft laugh.Alluring and glamorous.Youre all that and more already.The innkeepers words were sincere and took Ellie by surprise.She thanked her and then headed out the door.She walked down the very hill she had climbed shortly after her arrival.Shed crossed Harbor Street then and gone directly toward the waterfront, exploring the park and strolling along the marina, admiring the overflowing hanging flower baskets that lined the sidewalk.The wire framed baskets were a colorful arrangement of summer flowers in yellow, red, and white.On this second trip onto Harbor Street, instead of heading toward the marina, she went left and down the city walkway.It didnt take her long to find Marilyns, the hair boutique the woman on the bus had mentioned.The salon was bustling.It seemed every chair was filled, every seat taken.Ellie almost turned around and walked outclearly, Marilyn did a lively business and it wasnt likely she had an opening, especially on Friday afternoon on such short noticebut the receptionist looked up just then and caught Ellies eye.Can I help you?the blond woman asked, her smile warm and welcoming.Im in town  meeting a friend, and I wondered if by chance there was an opening for this afternoon.Are you looking for a haircut or a shampoo and set?the receptionist asked.Actually, Im not sure.Ellies fingers went to her hair, pulling it forward as if the thick locks would offer a suggestion.Ive worn my hair exactly like this since I was in third grade.What Im looking for is a new look.Wellthe other woman placed her pencil sideways in her mouth and stared at the computer screenMarilyn would be the best one for the job, but I know shes booked solid today.She wanted to leave a bit early this afternoon.Ellie knew the reason.Her mothers just arrived and shes probably looking forward to visiting with her.The receptionist looked up, surprise written on her face.I met Martha on the bus driving in from the airport.Shes the one who mentioned Marilyns to me and suggested I stop by.You know Martha?Not really, Ellie clarified.She didnt want to give the wrong impression.Marilyns mother sat in the seat across from me.The receptionist raised her index finger.Let me talk to Marilyn a moment.She left the area and walked over to one of the stylists stations.Marilyn was working on a woman who was having her hair colored.The woman in the chair had her hair sectioned off and secured with large clips.Marilyn stood next to her, wearing rubber gloves and holding onto a squeeze bottle filled with the hair dye.Ellie couldnt hear what was being said, but whatever it was caused Marilyn to turn away and glance in Ellies direction.Ellie resisted the urge to hold up her palm and wave.Marilyn said something to the receptionist, who nodded and then returned to Ellie.She said shell do it.She will?Ellie felt like cheering.She needs to finish the color job on Mrs.Weaver first, and  Ill gladly wait, Ellie said, cutting her off.Two of the chairs in the waiting area had been vacated by the time she finished at the reception desk.She claimed one and reached for a copy of People magazine, flipping through the pages.Halfway through a second gossip magazine, the receptionist returned.Marilyn is ready for you now.Surprised, Ellie looked up.Oh.It seemed hardly any time had passed.She replaced the magazine and then followed the other woman to the far end of the salon.Marilyn was a petite woman with frosted brown hair and steel gray eyes.You must be Ellie, she said, reaching for the plastic cape.I am.She thought it was a nice touch for the receptionist to mention her name.I was telling the woman at the desk that I met your mother this morning on the bus from Sea Tac Airport, Ellie explained.Mom mentioned you.She did?Ellie didnt bother to hide her surprise.I called at noon to check on them.Cameron, my son, was thrilled to pick her up.I wanted to make sure he hadnt frightened Mom half to death.He only got his drivers license recently, she added.Mom told me all about your chat.Ellie had appreciated the older womans words of advice.Your mother is wise and wonderful.Marilyn smiled.I think so, too.Id hoped to leave a bit early today, but when I tell Mom Im later than expected because you stopped by, shell understand.Shes the one who mentioned your salon.She talked about you with real pride.Marilyn shook her head and grinned.That sounds like Mom.Youd think I was the hair stylist to the stars to hear her speak.She wrapped the plastic cape around Ellies shoulders and ran her fingers through her hair.Apparently, she liked what she saw.Your hair is healthy, good and thick.I know.It sometimes took as long as twenty minutes to blow it dry.Monica said youre looking for something new.Yes, please.Youd look great with an inverted bob.Once more, Marilyn riffled her fingers through the hair at the back of Ellies head.I like that style  but I dont know how it would be on me.Marilyn stepped back.The nice thing about hair is that it grows.If you find you dont like the cut, then give it a few weeks.My guess is that youre going to love it.She draped a towel over Ellies shoulders and led her to the shampoo bowl.Forty minutes later, Ellie stared at her reflection in the mirror and couldnt believe the difference a simple haircut could make.What did I tell you?Marilyn gloated.Youre an entirely new woman.Thats exactly how I feel.When Ellie had stepped into the salon, she hadnt believed this kind of transformation was even possible.It embarrassed her that she couldnt stop staring at her reflection in the mirror.Its going to be easy to manage, too, Marilyn promised.Ellie paid the bill and left a generous tip for Marilyn before she left.Mom said youre a special young woman, and she was right, Marilyn said, as she walked Ellie to the door.Good luck meeting your young man.Thank you.I have a good feeling about this.Life has a way of working out for the best, the stylist said, and gave Ellies shoulder a gentle squeeze.She removed her apron and said, Now Im off to enjoy a long overdue visit with my mother.Ellie wished her own relationship with her mother was as emotionally healthy as the one Martha and Marilyn shared.Walking back to the inn, Ellie found herself humming a song shed heard on the radio.She couldnt remember the words, but the music had stayed with her.It felt as if her life had become a song.Tom had done that for her.It didnt seem possible that she could or even should feel this strongly about a man she hadnt met in the traditional way.The thing was, she knew Tom.They might never have met in person, but it felt as if shed known him her entire life.They shared a closeness, an easy intimacy.He might never have held or kissed her, but she swore she knew what it would be like to feel his arms around her and the taste of his lips on hers.Whoa, she was getting ahead of herself.Way ahead.Jo Marie was still working in her kitchen when Ellie returned.She glanced at her and said, Can I help  For one short second she stared.Ellie, is that really you?She lifted her hand toward her head.Do you like it?I didnt recognize you at first.This is an amazing transformation.Unbelievable.Ellie was thrilled by the innkeepers reaction.Im so glad you like it.I do, but, more important, do you?I love it.Marilyn was great.She took one look at me and knew right away what style would best suit me.I wasnt sure if Id like my hair stacked in the back like this, you know  cut in layers.Jo Marie ran her hand along the smooth edge of the back.It looks amazing.Thanks so much  Ellie said.I guess I should go get changed.I bought a new outfit for my first date with Tom.Ellie headed up the stairs to get ready, butterflies exploding in her stomach.This time would be different.In fact, she had the feeling it might end up being the most romantic night of her life.Tom was different.Shed felt it almost from the first moment when theyd started communicating online.One thing was sure: Ellie wasnt about to let her mothers fears ruin this relationship.The short conversation with Tom lingered in her mind.Hed wanted to say something, wanted her to make him a promise, but had stopped before he could ask.Ellie could only wonder what had held him back.Well, no worries there.Shed find out soon enough.7     After lunch, Maggie and Roy decided to take a walk along Harbor Street.When theyd left Rose Harbor Inn for lunch shed noticed a number of antiques shops along the main street of the town and wanted to investigate.Would you mind checking out a couple of the stores?Maggie asked her husband.Sure, he said, readily agreeing.Who knows, we might find priceless canning jars or a discarded yarn project thats half knit.Maggie glanced at him to be sure he was joking, and when she saw his smile, she returned it with one of her own.Shopping was one of his least favorite ways to spend time, but his willingness showed her that he was doing his best to recapture what theyd lost over the last few years.I enjoy looking at old buttons.Buttons?Some of the older buttons from the 1960s and before are lovely.I especially like the pearl ones.When I was a kid I used to collect baseball cards, Roy mentioned.If Id kept them, theyd probably be worth a fortune now.He was right.What became of them?He shrugged.I dont remember.I traded off a few when I was twelve or thirteen and kept the rest in an old cigar box I got from my grandfather.I havent thought about them in years.I havent got a clue where they went.As they walked down the hill, Roy reached for her hand, gripping it in his own.The simple gesture was like healing salve on a throbbing burn.Even now Maggie wasnt sure how their marriage could have taken such a drastic detour when they continued to love each other.It had hit her all over again at lunch how far apart theyd grown.When Roy had suggested they leave the boys out of the conversation, shed been shocked to realize they had nothing left to say to each other.Finally, Roy talked about the job that had demanded so much of his time.She noticed how careful he was to avoid the subject of Katherine.The other woman, a high school flame, held a job with one of his plumbing suppliers.That was how theyd connected on Facebook and become friends again.Maggie was convinced itd all started out innocent enough, at least in the beginning.She stopped herself, refusing to dwell on Katherine.Roy had severed the relationship and she had to learn to trust him again in the same way that he had to put his trust back in her.Still, the entire time he talked about the construction project, Maggie felt a burning sensation close to her heart.Her husband hadnt been unfaithful, at least not in the physical sense.But Katherine and Roy were emotionally involved, texting and communicating day after day, meeting for drinks and exchanging sexually explicit emails.It was when she found the emails that Maggie had blown up.The most painful one suggested Maggie was a cold fish in bed.Another was a cruel joke.How do you turn a fox into a cow?Marry her.Just thinking about the messages Maggie had read on his phone from the other woman was enough to fill her mouth with bile.She couldnt allow her mind to dwell on all the lonely nights shed gone to bed by herself because her husband was busy with paperwork or other business.He didnt have time to talk to her, but hed spent copious amounts of time flirting with another woman.It hadnt gotten to the point of being physical, but it was clear to Maggie that that was exactly where the relationship was headed.Far too clear.Im enjoying quilting, shed told him at lunch.No doubt he found the subject of little interest, but hed listened politely and suggested that for Christmas she might like a new sewing machine.She appreciated the offer and the fact that he felt their marriage would survive until the holidays.The bile didnt settle well, and she had to deal with heartburn.The acid built up in her as they strolled down Harbor Street.I need an antacid, she said, and noticed a pharmacy located a block down on the corner.It must have been the grease from the fish.They walked to the end of the street and went inside together.While she searched the aisle for what she needed, Roy looked over the magazine rack where the novels were positioned and picked out a paperback thriller by one of his favorite authors.I cant remember the last time I got involved in a book, he said.The one I brought with me is months old, and Ive forgotten the storyline.Actually, shed been thinking the same thing.She couldnt remember the last time she saw him reading, or doing anything that didnt involve his job.Thats part of the problem, dont you think?He frowned, as if the comment confused him.Not reading?Not taking time for ourselves.She didnt for herself, either.It was difficult, especially with two young boys who were constantly in need of care and attention.You quilt.That helps keep me sane.She had a minimum of an hour every afternoon while the boys went down for a nap, but Jaxon was fast outgrowing nap time.Hed start kindergarten in another month.The plan was for Maggie to find part time employment once both boys were in school full time.It wasnt necessary for the money as much as her emotional well being.While Maggie enjoyed her role as a wife and mother, she needed to get out of the house and socialize with other women and develop her own interests.Part of the problem, she realized, was that Roy didnt seem to understand or appreciate the role she had in their home.Theyd once had a tremendous argument because hed needed her to return a pair of jeans for him.She hadnt found the time.Shed been on the run all day.Collin had a dentist appointment, Jaxons preschool needed cupcakes for a bake sale, and it was her turn with the car pool.She hadnt gotten groceries in two weeks.When Roy discovered she hadnt returned his jeans for the right size, hed demanded to know what shed done all day.To hear him talk, shed been lying around the house eating chocolate dipped strawberries all afternoon.Again she forced herself to stop focusing her attention on the negative.It seemed her mind automatically lingered on old hurts.This was supposed to be a time to heal and rebuild, not stew over past slights or misunderstandings.Maggie stepped to the counter and paid for their purchases.Right away she chewed two antacids.As they exited the small pharmacy, Roy pointed down the street.That shop looks interesting.It does, she agreed.This was exactly the kind of antiques store she enjoyed exploring most.The window display was of blue glass from the time of the Depression.No doubt it was priced beyond what shed be comfortable paying.Look at that Star Wars lunch box, Roy said, pointing toward a second window display.I had one just like that when I was in school.Its hard to think of it as an antique, isnt it?she teased.Im too young to be considered an antique, he insisted, shaking his head as if to dispel the thought.Way too young, she agreed, and resisted squeezing his cheek.Youve still got a baby face.He rewarded her with a smile.And you dont look a day over thirty.Im barely thirty three, she reminded him.Really?I thought you were still thirty one.Time flies when youre having fun.
