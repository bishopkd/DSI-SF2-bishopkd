Adeles baby girl was in the car seat in the back.Are you absolutely sure you dont want to go back in there and maybe have a little more sex before you leave?Adele asked.Ive had all the sex I can take for a while.Ah.Spoken like a wife!And a mother?Peyton asked.Oh, my God, youre pregnant?Just a little, she said.I wasnt going to tell anyone, but youre not just anyone.This is fabulous!Ill be counting the days!Our kids will be so close to the same age!Have a girl, will you?Ill see what I can do.Now dont tell anyone, all right?Because we should concentrate on the wedding, not the pregnancy.Everyone will know the second you say no thank you to a glass of wine.Its not like I drink that much wine, Peyton said.You didnt notice last night.You appeared to have wine!No, that was citrus green tea in a wineglass.She grinned.I can fake my way through this.Oh, this is going to be so fun!Thank you for getting rid of that ass Ted and finding adorable Scott.I love him.What ever happened to Ted?Last time I talked to his daughter, she said they had a very nice housekeeper and he was playing grandfather.Apparently hes better with her little one than he ever was with his kids.A transformation, it sounds like.Good for him.No regrets?Are you kidding me?she asked.Scott is my dream man.The drive to the farm, near Portland, was four hours from Thunder Point.Adele lived in San Francisco and had arrived two days ago; her husband would be driving up on Friday morning in a catering truck stocked with prepared disheshe was a restaurateur and would be catering much of the reception, but not allPeytons mother, sisters, aunts, grandmother and cousins would not be held back from sharing their special Basque dishes.But Lucas was an amazing chef and wanted to do this for Peyton.He would follow Adele back to the city on Sunday.Peyton and her youngest sister were best friends.It was odd in a large family how the siblings paired up and there was no formula to it.Peyton was always there for Adele and vice versa.They talked all the way to the farmabout their men, their jobs, the wedding, the other siblings, their parents.When they arrived, all was as expected.There were vans, RVs, trailers and trucks with camper shells everywhere.The kitchen was full of women, talking, laughing, some arguing here and there.Adele walked in ahead of Peyton, carrying baby Rose, named for her great grandmother and at least three women on Lucass side of the family.Peyton followed with her wedding dress hidden by a garment bag so that Scott wouldnt see it.Were here, Adele said.Peytons pregnant.Peyton gasped but the women shrieked and came running, fussing over her, hugging her, laughing and shouting, Way to go, Adele, Peyton said when the din died down.Its an icebreaker.Theyre going to find out within twenty four hours anyway.Its not like youre a virgin bride.And besides, theyre Basque women.They have a couple of pregnant brides every year.We have the passion, she added with a heavy accent.Now Ill have to call Scott so he can tell the grandmothers.Im never telling you another secret.Yes, you will, Adele said with a grin.Im very responsible.Most of the time.* * *  				Grace and Ginger were under way with the flowers by seven on Friday morning.Grace was so glad to be leaving town.Troy had texted her once in the past twenty four hoursAre you okay?She texted back one word.Fine.Was she angry?Damn straight.This was all so familiar.Her mother had furs and jewelry, so that made her life simple?Easy?The reverse was also not truethere was family money and that made her tragic, evil and doomed?No.It made her an individual.Were all very different with our own challenges and joys.What could Troy give her since she had everything?Well, she didnt have a father for her baby.My mistake, she mused.I thought he could love me no matter what.She didnt betray her feelings, something shed become an expert at.Shed done it for years, starting when she was a young girl.She could be terrified and her heart breaking, but she could smile for the judges like she had the world on a string.She knew how to cope.Or cover.She used the time to get Gingers story.When she gave her the job in the shop, she had no idea what Ginger had been through, the selfish husband, the babys death.I think the job at the flower shop has saved me, she told Grace.Its like a brand new chapter for me.I havent been happy in so long, but I get excited to go to work every day.I hope youll need me for a while.Are you kidding?Youre doing wonderfully.And my mother will be moving here in a month or so and you know all about that.I want to be able to see about her if she needs me or wants me.Its so nice to know theres someone who can take care of the flowers.I might have had to go to part time hours, but with you in the shop and Justin to deliver, Im in great shape.I can give my mother some time.When you get down to it, thats the one thing you cant buy or trade or borrow.And youre close to your mother?Ginger asked.Yes and no.My mother was always so proud of me and my father died when I was young, so it was just the two of us, no siblings.But she was also demanding and impatient and sometimes she angered too easily.But now her life is slowly ending and all she wants is to be comfortable and near me.This is our chance to close on a good note.A second chance.We should never take that for granted.Your husband, Grace said.You said you shouldve known.Why did you marry him if you shouldve known?Oh, its a long story, but the truth is, I loved the wrong man.I wanted him so much and put up with so much to have him.And in the end he wasnt worth it.Listen, it was very nice of Peyton to invite us to the wedding, but do you think shed be offended if I didnt go?Im completely over my ex, but a wedding might just make me very sad.I could go to the reception for a little while, just to see the wedding party with their flowers, but not the wedding ceremony.Would it hurt Peytons feelings?Not at all.Im goingshes a friend of mine.But the way we usually service a wedding is to deliver the flowers early, arrange and stage them in the church and make sure the bride and her wedding party have theirs, leave the centerpieces and any other decorations either with the catering staff or if the tables are ready, put them out, then leave.Just that much takes quite a while.When weve done our work and are ready to go clean up, I can drop you anywhere you like.And on Sunday morning, you want me to drive the van back to Thunder Point?she asked.I might be going back in the van, also.I dont know if Troy will make it.He has stuff going on.Hed like to, Im sure, but its iffy.I can stay with my friends, Mamie and Ross.Ill know for sure about Troy on Saturday night.That okay?Sure.Anything you want.* * *  				On Friday afternoon, Troy leaned in the doorway of Iriss office, arms crossed over his chest.She looked up and raised an eyebrow.What now?she asked.Are men born stupid or does it come over time?he asked.Sadly, I think youre born with it.Thats what I was afraid of.Think I can still make it right with Grace?I dont know, Troy.How badly did you screw it up?I carefully explained all my doubts and feelings, he said.I was very articulate.I listed them and suggested there was plenty of time for me to process them.I was eloquent!She told me to go away and process.She showed me the door.I thought I had been extremely sensible and sensitive.Is that so?Iris said.Turns out Grace is a little bit pregnant.I didnt panic, not me.I said we didnt have to make any decisions about what to do right away.I got the distinct impression that wasnt the best response.Iris rolled her eyes.Wow.What an idiot.Youre lucky she didnt fire up that Taser.I think Im figuring that part out.I bet you know exactly what I should have said instead.Why dont you tell me and Ill tell you if youre right.No, I dont think so, Troy, Iris said.I think you should puzzle this out for yourself.I dont want to mix you up with my words.Youve been whispering in Graces ear for months now.You know what makes her happy and what doesnt.Get your head out of your butt and think like a hero instead of an escaped convict whos trying to dodge the law.Youre not going to be put in prison, you know.If youre smart and lucky, youll get to share lives.Right, he said.Good advice.Ill let you know how it turns out.You do that, Troy.He left and she looked back at her paperwork.She smiled.Peyton had confessed she was a little pregnant when Iris confessed she was a little pregnant.And now Grace was, too.I guess we know what everyone was doing the first week in April, she said softly.* * *  				Grace was looking forward to seeing Peyton and Scotts wedding reception in the orchard but on Friday night, after putting out her table arrangements at the restaurant where the grooms dinner was held, Grace was so happy for a quiet evening with Mamie and Ross.Although she talked to them almost every week, she had held the news of her mothers health until she could tell them in person.Mamie and Ross had spent twenty years in Winnies employ.They felt much closer to Grace than to Winnie, but they immediately promised they would be visiting Winnie when she was relocated in Thunder Point.Im so happy you two have reconciled, Mamie said.For both your sakes.We are, too, Mamie.The sad truth is, if Winnie werent ill I dont know if wed have this relationship.But Ill do my best to be sure shes comfortable and well cared for.Winnie is making it surprisingly easy and I think Mikhail has a lot to do with it.He came immediately and is in no hurry to leave her.Like your mother, he has very few people hes tied to.For many years they kept each other close.Your mother always listened to Mikhail.On Saturday, Ginger borrowed her mothers car and drove to Mamies shop and all of them worked together on the flowers for the wedding.They had the altar arrangements and bouquets at the church by noon and the rest were delivered to the Lacoumette farm.Then Grace went back to Mamies house to clean up for the four oclock wedding.She wore a peach dress and nude sandals she loved and wore her hair down because Troy loved it that way.But she had not heard from Troy.Their plan had been that he would meet her at the wedding.They would spend the night in one of the coastal inns and let Ginger take the van back to Thunder Point on Sunday while they rode together in the Jeep, but she had a sense of foreboding.Maybe in the course of all his processing he had decided that getting involved with someone like Grace had been a mistake.Grace came from a different world, a world he wasnt comfortable even thinking about.It could be worse, she thought.He could try to marry her for her money.It just felt so hopeless.What could she do?Nothing.It was on him now.When she got to the church, she was distracted for a while, chuckling to herself when she saw the parking lot.It was full of trucks, RVs, SUVsall big vehicles, some that family members would be staying in while attending the Lacoumette wedding and reception.If they didnt look like a band of Gypsies, she didnt know what did.There was Peytons car, parked in front.She knew that Peyton had ridden to the farm with her sister and Scott was driving up here in that fancy Lexus.There were only a couple of late model cars.These farmers and fishermen and vintners were hardworking country folks and although Grace had heard it was a very successful family, youd never know it by looking at them.They just werent showy.There was no Jeep anywhere and her heart sank.She turned her phone to Silent, but, ever the optimist, she sat near the back of the packed church and on the aisle.If he came, he would find her.The church was so beautiful.She hoped someone would mention the flowers, the aisle drapes, the bridal bouquetsshe was so proud of them.Peyton had such good taste and when she finally walked down the aisle and all heads turned to her, she was stunning in her strapless gown.But Grace watched Scott.Even from a great distance she could see the glow in his eyes.He adored Peyton.He worshipped her.This was what every woman should have on her wedding day.The ceremony was not long.It was an ecumenical service performed by both a Catholic priest and a protestant minister.Grace silently chuckled as she noticed some of the Basque family members whispering and she remembered that Peyton had said some would be disgruntled by her not having a mass but they wouldnt boycott.The family disagreed often and heartily, but at the end of the day they were one for all.A large family, Grace thought.Maybe thats the answer to all these issues.A huge family, like the Lacoumette family, so many of them they were like countries tied together by treaties and pacts.Oh, hell, she thought.She had a hard enough time functioning in a family of two.Peyton and Scott spoke vows they had created themselves.They were blessed by both the priest and the minister and then, after less than a half hour, they embraced passionately and cheers erupted inside the church.Down the aisle they fled, followed by their wedding party, then family and friends, out the door, where a receiving line formed and someone from the family released white doves.By Peytons surprised expression, she had not expected it.No Jeep.No Troy.She would not cry.While there were a few pictures taken in the church, most of the caravan headed back to the farm, and it was not a short drive.It was nearly an hour away from this ornate, historical church.Grace was happy to see that Ginger had decided to come to the reception.By five they were serving wine and tapas in the reception tent and the flowers looked beautiful, as did the plentiful fruit blossoms everywhere.The band was playing and Grace noticed that some of the Basque men had changed into their native dresstrading their suits and tuxes for white pants and shirts, red vests and caps.They were getting ready to party.By six the bride and groom had arrived, and another cheer erupted.The music picked up its pace, the champagne flowed, all glasses were filled and the noise was wonderfully happy.Caterers brought plates to the wedding party.The rest of the guests, mostly the Basque population of the Pacific Northwest, fell on the buffet like locusts.But the food was never ending, as was the wine, it seemed.And the dancing, even during dinner while others ate, was extraordinary.Paco Lacoumette took the floor and was joined one at a time by his brothers, his sons, nephews, even his klutzy son in law, and showed them all what this clan could do.It was like a flash mob, so much fun.The cheers were enough to almost bring the tent down.Grace sat with a few of the people from Thunder Point: Spencer and Devon and their kids, Cooper and Sarah and little Summer.They asked if Troy was coming and she said she had hoped so, but he wasnt sure.He had something going on today.Well, it wasnt work.Rawleys holding down the fort.I could do that, Cooper said of the men dancing.A couple more glasses of wine and Im sure you will, Sarah agreed.Why didnt I come from a clan like this?Spencer asked.These people know how to have fun.From the looks of this place, they know how to work, too, Cooper added.Grace took her plate as if shed be going back for more, but she put it in the bussing cart and wandered out of the tent.The sun was setting, the party was going strong and she walked toward the orchard.She wanted a good look at it before it was dark.The house and garden stood between the big party tent and row after row of blossoming pear trees.She looked at Mrs.Lacoumettes garden with envy and crouched downvegetables, flowers, herbs.Everything was just coming inthe vegetables werent even showing their faces yet, but she longed for this.Thats what she would do nextget a house with room for a garden and teach her child how to grow things.Grace?a voice called.She looked up and saw Troy.He looked like hed slept in his suithis tie was crooked and there was a smear of dirt on his face.His duffel was sitting on the path behind him.I thought that was you.She stood.Troy.You came?Why werent you here for the wedding?He waved over his shoulder and a noisy tow truck pulling his Jeep edged away from the party, leaving Troy behind.The car broke down.The tow driver dropped me here.In all the calls I had to make to get service, my phone went dead.What happened?You have grease on your  				What didnt happen?he said, pulling out a handkerchief.I was running late to start with, then the damn thing just crashed.Transmission.It wasnt going anywhere.I bet a million dollars the jerk who sold me that Jeep put a rebuilt transmission in it.I have to go to the guys garage in the morning before we head home to see whats up.I might have to tow it home, get Eric at the service station to look at it.Jesus, Im sorry.I didnt think you were coming, she said.I didnt hear from you.In fact, youve been pretty quiet.Did you know that when men are in love theres a kind of atrophy of the brain that causes them to do stupid things?Even when they know better?I didnt know that.Im living proof, he said, taking her hand and walking with her along the path to the orchard.Gracie, can you forgive me?For having doubts?she asked.For not grabbing you and kissing you and begging you to marry me the second you told me theres a baby.Oh.That.Well, yes, I guess so.You want to get married?Because you dont have to.Im going to have it no matter what you say or do.Grace, I want to marry you even if there is no baby!I love you.I cant sleep unless youre next to me.And I may not be rich but I have important things.There are a million things I can give you that nobody else can.It appears I can give you children, without hardly trying.That made her smile.In fact, trying not to, she said.Did I mention Im good with kids?he asked her.Im not a teacher for the time off.I love what I do.I get a kick out of the kids.Id like a few of my own.A few?she asked.I get that Im slightly less than fifty percent of the vote, but I think well be good parents.As a matter of fact, I think we have a lot in common.A couple of days ago you were worried that it wasnt enough.Yeah, I got hung up on things that had nothing to do with us.We have fun together.Really, Ive never had this much fun with a girlfriend before, and we dont even have to do anything to laugh a lot.Who wouldve guessed a picnic in the Jeep would get you excited?Good thing, too, since it looks like thats about all that Jeeps going to be good for.I spend half my time off in that little dorm room you live in and its not too crowdedthat means something.Every day when I wake up if youre not right next to me, I start thinking about when Im going to see you.Youve had a lot of girlfriends, Troy.What makes this different?He stopped walking and turned her toward him.You do, Gracie.Ive dated a lot, but Ive never been this serious about a woman.Ive always known Id settle down when the right woman came into my life and a couple of times I asked myself, Is this her?Is this the right one?I never asked with you.I knew.I knew right away.But we had to learn about each other.You had to learn to trust me.Yes, and the minute I did...Brain atrophy, he explained.At least its not permanent.And if you get it again?Try a club, he suggested.And then he pulled her against him and kissed her stupid, a kiss that seemed to last forever.His hands roamed up and down her back.and her arms went around his neck.Their bodies were flush together so that only an earthquake could distract them.And then theres this, he whispered against her lips.The way we fit together.The way you cant breathe for a minute after you come.The way I cant stop after once and almost cant after twice.We were made for each other, thats the truth.Sometimes I can taste you in my dreams.And what if I want six kids?she asked very softly.Bring em on.Youre the only man Ive ever been with.Except for the knight, the Navy SEAL and the vampire.Youre not going to need those boys anymore, Gracie.Im going to keep you busy.He kissed her again.I bought you a ring.Its not flashy.Or big.You bought me a ring?You cant have it unless you promise to marry me and get old with me.I dont know...let me think...I can promise you hand holding and picnics and laughter.I can give you children and loyalty and love.I will stick by you through hard times and beside you through good.And I will never again doubt you, I swear.Ill trust you and you can always trust me.Ill be a good husband and a strong father for our kids.Do it, Grace.Forgive me, trust me, marry me.I cant make it without you.Okay.But only because I love you so much in spite of your flaws.He sighed in relief and pulled a ring box out of his pocket.Without letting an inch separate them, he slipped it on her ring finger.It was a lovely solitaire, certainly not too little on her small hand.She thought it was the most beautiful thing shed ever seen.But it could have been a cigar band and she would have been filled with love for him.Be my life, be my love, be my wife.Yes, she said.* * * * *  				Keep reading for an excerpt from THE

and seventh floors at the far west end of the hospital, the steps least traveled by interns and residents racing from floor to floor, from emergency to emergency.She sat on the landing between two flights, feet on the stairs, arms crossed on her knees, her face buried in her arms.She didnt understand how her heart could feel as if it was breaking every day.She thought of herself as much stronger.Well now, some things never change, a familiar voice said.She looked up at her closest friend, Jaycee Kent.They had gone to med school together, though residency had separated them.Jaycee was an OB and Maggie, a neurosurgeon.Andthey had hidden in stairwells to cry all those years ago when med school life was kicking their asses.Most of their fellow students and instructors were men.They refused to let the men see them cry.Maggie gave a wet, burbly huff of laughter.Howd you find me?Maggie asked.How do you know youre not in my spot?Because youre happily married and have a beautiful daughter?And my hours suck, Im sleep deprived, have as many bad days as good and Jaycee sat down beside Maggie.And at least my hormones are cooperating at the moment.Maggie, youre just taking call for someone, right?Just to stay ahead of the bills?Since the practice shut down, Maggie said.And since the lawsuit was filed.You need a break.Youre recovering from a miscarriage and your hormones are wonky.You need to get away, especially away from the emergency room.Take some time off.Lick your wounds.Heal.He dumped me, Maggie said.Jaycee was clearly shocked.What?He broke up with me.He said he couldnt take it anymore.My emotional behavior, my many troubles.He suggested professional help.Jaycee was quiet.Im speechless, she finally said.What a huge ass.Well, I was crying all the time, she said, sniffing some more.If I wasnt with him, I cried when I talked to him on the phone.I thought I was okay with the idea of no children.Im almost thirty seven, I work long hours, I was with a good man who was just off a bad marriage and already had a child  Ill give you everything but the good man, Jaycee said.Hes a doctor, for Gods sake.Doesnt he know that all youve been through can take a toll?Remove all the stress and you still had the miscarriage!People tend to treat a miscarriage like a heavy period but its a death.You lost your baby.You have to take time to grieve.Gospel, Maggie said, rummaging for a tissue and giving her nose a hearty blow.I really felt it on that level.When I found out I was pregnant, it took me about fifteen minutes to start seeing the baby, loving her.Or him.Not to beat a dead horse, but you have some hormone issues playing havoc on your emotions.Listen, shoot out some emails tonight.Tell the ones on the need to know list youre taking a week or two off.No one knows about the pregnancy but you and Andrew.You dont have to explaineveryone knows about your practice, your ex partners, the lawsuit.Frankly, your colleagues are amazed youre still standing.Get out of town or something.Get some rest.You might be right, Maggie said.These cement stairwells are killing me.Jaycee put an arm around her.Just like old times, huh?* * *  The last seven or eight miles to Sullivans Crossing was nothing but mud and Maggies cream colored Toyota SUV was coated up to the windows.This was not exactly a surprise.It had rained all week in Denver, now that she thought about it.March was typically the most unpredictable and sloppiest month of the year, especially in the mountains.If it wasnt rain it could be snow.But Maggie had had such a lousy year the weather barely crossed her mind.Last year had produced so many medical, legal and personal complications that her practice had shut down a few months ago.Shed been picking up work from other practices, covering for doctors on call here and there and working ER Level 1 Trauma while she tried to figure out how to untangle the mess her life had become.This, on her best friend and doctors advice, was a much needed break.After sending a few emails and making a few phone calls she was driving to her dads house.She knew she was probably suffering from depression.Exhaustion and general misery.It would stand to reason.Her schedule could be horrific and the tension had been terrible lately.It was about a year ago that two doctors in her practice had been accused of fraud and malpractice and suspended from seeing patients pending an investigation that would very likely lead to a trial.Even though she had no knowledge of the incidents, there was a scandal and it stank on her.Thered been wild media attention and she was left alone trying to hold a wilting practice together.Then the parents of a boy who died from injuries sustained in a terrible car accident while on her watch filed a wrongful death suit.Against her.It seemed impossible fate could find one more thing to stack on her already teetering pile of troubles.Hah.Never challenge fate.She found out she was pregnant.It was an accident, of course.Shed been seeing Andrew for a couple of years.She lived in Denver and he in Aurora, since they both had demanding careers, and they saw each other when they coulda night here, a night there.When they could manage a long weekend, it was heaven.She wanted more but Andrew was an ER doctor and also the divorced father of an eight year old daughter.But they had constant phone contact.Multiple texts and emails every day.She counted on him; he was her main support.Maggie wasnt sure shed ever marry and have a family but she was happy with her surprise.It was the one good thing in a bad year.Andrew, however, was not happy.He was still in divorce recovery, though it had been three years.He and his ex still fought about support and custody and visits.Maggie didnt understand why.Andrew didnt seem to know what to do with his daughter when he had her.He immediately suggested terminating the pregnancy.He said they could revisit the issue in a couple of years if it turned out to be that important to her and if their relationship was thriving  She couldnt imagine terminating.Just because Andrew was hesitant?She was thirty six!How much time did she have to revisit the issue?Although she hadnt told Andrew, she decided she was going to keep the baby no matter what that meant for their relationship.Then she had a miscarriage.Grief stricken and brokenhearted, she sank lower.Exactly two people knew about the pregnancy and miscarriageAndrew and Jaycee.Maggie cried gut wrenching tears every night.Sometimes she couldnt even wait to get home from work and started crying the second she pulled the car door closed.And there were those stairwell visits.She cried on the phone to Andrew; cried in his arms as he tried to comfort her, all the while knowing he was relieved.And then he said, You know what, Maggie?I just cant do it anymore.We need a time out.I cant prop you up, cant bolster you.You have to get some help, get your emotional life back on track or something.Youre sucking the life out of me and Im not equipped to help you.Are you kidding me?she had demanded.Youre dropping me when Im down?When Im only three weeks beyond a miscarriage?And in typical Andrew fashion he had said, Thats all I got, baby.It was really and truly the first moment she had realized it was all about him.And that was pretty much the last straw.She packed a bunch of suitcases.Once she got packing, she couldnt seem to stop.She drove southwest from Denver to her fathers house, south of Leadville and Fairplay, and she hadnt called ahead.She did call her mother, Phoebe, just to say she was going to Sullys and she wasnt sure how long shed stay.At the moment she had no plan except to escape from that life of persistent strain, anxiety and heartache.It was early afternoon when she drove up to the country store that had been her great grandfathers, then her grandfathers, now her fathers.Her father, Harry Sullivan, known by one and all as Sully, was a fit and hardy seventy and showed no sign of slowing down and no interest in retiring.She just sat in her car for a while, trying to figure out what she was going to say to him.How could she phrase it so it didnt sound like shed just lost a baby and had her heart broken?Beau, her fathers four year old yellow Lab, came trotting around the store, saw her car, started running in circles barking, then put his front paws up on her door, looking at her imploringly.Frank Masterson, a local whod been a fixture at the store for as long as Maggie could remember, was sitting on the porch, nursing a cup of coffee with a newspaper on his lap.One glance told her the campground was barely occupiedonly a couple of pop up trailers and tents on campsites down the road toward the lake.She saw a man sitting outside his tent in a canvas camp chair, reading.She had expected the sparse populationit was the middle of the week, middle of the day and the beginning of March, the least busy month of the year.Frank glanced at her twice but didnt even wave.Beau trotted off, disappointed, when Maggie didnt get out of the car.She still hadnt come up with a good entry line.Five minutes passed before her father walked out of the store, across the porch and down the steps, Beau following.She lowered the window.Hi, Maggie, he said, leaning on the cars roof.Wasnt expecting you.It was spur of the moment.He glanced into her backseat at all the luggage.How long you planning to stay?She shrugged.Didnt you say I was always welcome?Anytime?He smiled at her.Sometimes I run off at the mouth.I need a break from work.From all that crap.From everything.Understandable.What can I get you?Is it too much trouble to get two beers and a bed?she asked, maybe a little sarcastically.Coors okay by you?Sure.Go on and park by the house.Theres beer in the fridge and I havent sold your bed yet.Thats gracious of you, she said.You want some help to unload your entire wardrobe?he asked.Nope.I dont need much for now.Ill take care of it.Then Ill get back to work and well meet up later.Sounds like a plan, she said.* * *  Maggie dragged only one bag into the house, the one with her toothbrush, pajamas and clean jeans.When she was a little girl and both her parents and her grandfather lived on this property, she had been happy most of the time.The general store, the locals and campers, the mountains, lake and valley, wildlife and sunshine kept her constantly cheerful.But the part of her that had a miserable mother, a father who tended to drink a little too much and bickering parents had been forlorn.Then, when she was six, her mother had had enough of hardship, rural living, driving Maggie a long distance to a school that Phoebe found inadequate.Throw in an unsatisfactory husband and that was all she could take.Phoebe took Maggie away to Chicago.Maggie didnt see Sully for several years and her mother married Walter Lancaster, a prominent neurosurgeon with lots of money.Maggie had hated it all.Chicago, Walter, the big house, the private school, the blistering cold and concrete landscape.She hated the sound of traffic and emergency vehicles.One thing she could recall in retrospect, it brought her mother to life.Phoebe was almost entirely happy, the only smudge on her brightness being her ornery daughter.They had switched roles.By the time Maggie was eleven she was visiting her dad regularlyfirst a few weekends, then whole months and some holidays.She lived for it and Phoebe constantly held it over her.Behave yourself and get good grades and youll get to spend the summer at that god awful camp, eating worms, getting filthy and risking your life among bears.Why didnt you fight for me?she had continually asked her father.Aw, honey, Phoebe was right, I wasnt worth a damn as a father and I just wanted what was best for you.It wasnt always easy, neither, hed explained.Sometime in junior high Maggie had made her peace with Walter, but she chose to go to college in Denver, near Sully.Phoebes desire was that she go to a fancy Ivy League college.Med school and residency were a different storyits tough getting accepted at all and you go to the best career school and residency program that will have you.She ended up in Los Angeles.Then she did a fellowship with Walter, even though she hated going back to Chicago.But Walter was simply one of the best.After that she joined a practice in Denver, close to her dad and the environment she loved.A year later, with Walter finally retired from his practice and enjoying more golf, Phoebe and Walter moved to Golden, Colorado, closer to Maggie.Walter was also seventy, like Sully.Phoebe was a vibrant, social fifty nine.Maggie thought she was possibly closer to Walter than to Phoebe, especially as they were both neurosurgeons.She was grateful.After all, hed sent her to good private schools even when she did every terrible thing she could to show him how unappreciated his efforts were.She had been a completely ungrateful brat about it.But Walter turned out to be a kind, classy guy.He had helped a great many people who proved to be eternally grateful and Maggie had been impressed by his achievements.Plus, he mentored her in medicine.Loving medicine surprised her as much as anyone.Sully had said, I think its a great idea.If I was as smart as you and some old coot like Walter was willing to pick up the tab, Id do it in a New York minute.Maggie found she loved science but med school was the hardest thing shed ever taken on, and most days she wasnt sure she could make it through another week.She couldve just quit, done a course correction or flunked out, but noshe got perfect grades along with anxiety attacks.But the second they put a scalpel in her hand, shed found her calling.She sat on Sullys couch, drank two beers, then lay down and pulled the throw over her.Beau pushed in through his doggie door and lay down beside the couch.The window was open, letting in the crisp, clean March air, and she dropped off to sleep immediately to the rhythmic sound of Sully raking out a trench behind the house.She started fantasizing about summer at the lake but before she woke she was dreaming of trying to operate in a crowded emergency room where everyone was yelling, bloody rags littered the floor, people hated each other, threw instruments at one another, and patients were dying one after another.She woke up panting, her heart hammering.The sun had set and a kitchen light had been turned on which meant Sully had been to the house to check on her.There was a sandwich covered in plastic wrap on a plate.A note sat beside it.It was written by Enid, Franks wife.Enid worked mornings in the store, baking and preparing packaged meals from salads to sandwiches for campers and tourists.Welcome Home, the note said.Maggie ate the sandwich, drank a third beer and went to bed in the room that was hers at her fathers house.She woke to the sound of Sully moving around and saw that it was not quite 5:00 a. m.  so she decided to go back to sleep until she didnt have anxiety dreams anymore.She got up at noon, grazed through the refrigerators bleak contents and went back to sleep.At about two in the afternoon the door to her room opened noisily and Sully said, All right.Enough is enough.* * *  Sullys store had been built in 1906 by Maggies great grandfather, Nathaniel Greely Sullivan.Nathaniel had a son and a daughter, married off the daughter and gave the son, Horace, the store.Horace had one son, Harry, who really had better things to do than run a country store.He wanted to see the world and have adventures so he joined the Army and went to Vietnam, among other places, but by the age of thirty three, he finally married and brought his pretty young wife, Phoebe, home to Sullivans Crossing.They immediately had one child, Maggie, and settled in for the long haul.All of the store owners had been called Sully but Maggie was always called Maggie.The store had once been the only place to get bread, milk, thread or nails within twenty miles, but things had changed mightily by the time Maggies father had taken it on.It had become a recreational facilityfour one room cabins, dry campsites, a few RV hookups, a dock on the lake, a boat launch, public bathrooms with showers, coin operated laundry facilities, picnic tables and grills.Sully had installed a few extra electrical outlets on the porch so people in tents could charge their electronics and now Sully himself had satellite TV and Wi Fi.Sullivans Crossing sat in a valley south of Leadville at the base of some stunning mountains and just off the Continental Divide Trail.The camping was cheap and well managed, the grounds were clean, the store large and well stocked.They had a post office; Sully was the postmaster.And now it was the closest place to get supplies, beer and ice for locals and tourists alike.The people who ventured there ranged from hikers to bikers to cross country skiers, boating enthusiasts, rock climbers, fishermen, nature lovers and weekend campers.Plenty of hikers went out on the trails for a day, a few days, a week or even longer.Hikers who were taking on the CDT or the Colorado Trail often planned on Sullys as a stopping point to resupply, rest and get cleaned up.Those hearties were called the thru hikers, as the Continental Divide Trail was 3100 miles long while the Colorado Trail was almost five hundred, but the two trails converged for about 200 miles just west of Sullys.Thus Sullys was often referred to as the crossing.People who knew the place referred to it as Sullys.Some of their campers were one timers, never seen again, many were regulars within an easy drive looking for a weekend or holiday escape.They were all interesting to Maggiemen, women, young, old, athletes, wannabe athletes, scout troops, nature clubs, weirdos, the occasional creepbut the ones who intrigued her the most were the long distance hikers, the thru hikers.She couldnt imagine the kind of commitment needed to take on the CDT, not to mention the courage and strength.She loved to hear their stories about everything from wildlife on the trail to how many toenails theyd lost on their journey.There were tables and chairs on the stores wide front porch and people tended to hang out there whether the store was open or closed.When the weather was warm and fair there were spontaneous gatherings and campfires at the edge of the lake.Long distance hikers often mailed themselves packages that held dry socks, extra food supplies, a little cash, maybe even a book, first aid items, a new lighter for their campfires, a fresh shirt or two.Maggie loved to watch them retrieve and open boxes theyd packed themselvesit was like Christmas.Sully had a great big map of the CDT, Colorado Trail and other trails on the bulletin board in the front of the store; it was surrounded by pictures either left or sent back to him.Hed put out a journal book where hikers could leave news or messages.The journals, when filled, were kept by Sully, and had become very well known.People could spend hours reading through them.Sullys was an escape, a refuge, a gathering place or recreational outpost.Maggie and Andrew liked to come for the occasional weekend to skithe cross country trails were safe and well marked.Occupancy was lower during the winter months so theyd take a cabin, and Sully would never comment on the fact that they were sharing not just a room but a bed.Before the pregnancy and miscarriage, their routine had been rejuvenatingtheyd knock themselves out for a week or even a few weeks in their separate cities, then get together for a weekend or few days, eat wonderful food, screw their brains out, get a little exercise in the outdoors, have long and deep conversations, meet up with friends, then go back to their separate worlds.Andrew was shy of marriage, having failed at one and being left a single father.Maggie, too, had had a brief unsuccessful marriage, but she wasnt afraid of trying again and had always thought Andrew would eventually get over it.She accepted the fact that she might not have children, coupled with a man who, right up front, declared he didnt want more.But then there was one on the way and does he step up?she muttered to herself as she walked into the store through the back door.He complains that Im too sad for him to deal with.The bastard.Whos the bastard, darling?Enid asked from the kitchen.She stuck her head out just as Maggie was climbing onto a stool at the counter, and smiled.Its so good to see you.Its been a while.I know, Im sorry about that.Its been harrowing in Denver.Im sure Dad told you about all that mess with my practice.He did.Those awful doctors, tricking people into thinking they needed surgery on their backs and everything!Is one of them the bastard?Without a doubt, she answered, though they hadnt been on her mind at all.And that lawsuit against you, Enid reminded her, tsking.Thatll probably go away, Maggie said hopefully, though there was absolutely no indication it would.At least it was civil.The DA had found no cause to indict her.But really, how much is one girl supposed to take?The event leading to the lawsuit was one of the most horrific nights shed ever been through in the ERfive teenage boys in a catastrophic car wreck, all critical.Shed spent a lot of time in the stairwell after that one.Im not worried, she lied.Then she had to concentrate to keep from shuddering.Good for you.I have soup.I made some for your dad and Frank.Mushroom.With cheese toast.Theres plenty if youre interested.Yes, please, she said.Ill get it.Enid went around the corner to dish it up.The store didnt have a big kitchen, just a little turning around room.It was in the southwest corner of the store; there was a bar and four stools right beside the cash register.On the northwest corner there was a small bar where they served adult beverages, and again, a bar and four stools.No one had ever wanted to attempt a restaurant but it was a good idea to provide food and drinkcampers and hikers tended to run out of supplies.Sully sold beer, wine, soft drinks and bottled water in the cooler section of the store, but he didnt sell bottled liquor.For that matter, he wasnt a grocery store but a general store.Along with foodstuffs there were T shirts, socks and a few other recreational suppliesrope, clamps, batteries, hats, sunscreen, first aid supplies.For the mother lode you had to go to Timberlake, Leadville or maybe Colorado Springs.In addition to tables and chairs on the porch there were a few comfortable chairs just inside the front door where the potbellied stove sat.Maggie remembered when she was a little girl, men sat on beer barrels around the stove.There was a giant ice machine on the back porch.The ice was free.Enid stuck her head out of the little kitchen.She bleached her hair blond but had always, for as long as Maggie could remember, had black roots.She was plump and nurturing while her husband, Frank, was one of those grizzled, skinny old ranchers.Is that nice Dr.Mathews coming down on the weekend?Enid asked.I broke up with him.Dont ever call him nice again, Maggie said.Hes a turd.Oh, honey!You broke up?He said I was depressing, she said with a pout.He can kiss my ass.Well, I should say so!I never liked him very much, did I mention that?No, you didnt.You said you loved him and thought wed make handsome children together.She winced as she said it.Obviously I wasnt thinking, Enid said, withdrawing back into the kitchen.In a moment she brought out a bowl of soup and a thick slice of cheese toast.Her soup was cream of mushroom and it was made with real cream.Maggie dipped her spoon into the soup, blew on it, tasted.It was heaven.Why arent you my mother?she asked.I just didnt have the chance, thats all.But well pretend.Maggie and Enid had that little exchange all the time, exactly like that.Maggie had always wanted one of those soft, nurturing, homespun types for a mother instead of Phoebe who was thin, chic, active in society, snobby and prissy.Phoebe was cool while Enid was warm and cuddly.Phoebe could read the hell out of a menu while Enid could cure anything with her chicken soup, her grandmothers recipe.Phoebe rarely cooked and when she did it didnt go well.But lest Maggie completely throw her mother under the bus, she reminded herself that Phoebe had a quick wit, and though she was sarcastic and ironic, she could make Maggie laugh.She was devoted to Maggie and craved her loyalty, especially that Maggie like her more than she liked Sully.She gave Maggie everything she had to give.It wasnt Phoebes fault they were not the things Maggie wanted.For example, Phoebe sent Maggie to an extremely good college prep boarding school that had worked out on many levels, except that Maggie would have traded it all to live with her father.Foolishly, perhaps, but still And while Phoebe would not visit Sullys campground under pain of death, she had thrown Maggie a fifty thousand dollar wedding that Maggie hadnt wanted.And Walter had given her and Sergei a trip to Europe for their honeymoon.Maggie had appreciated the trip to Europe quite a lot.But she should never have married Sergei.Shed been very busy and distracted and he was handsome, sexyespecially that accent!Theyd looked so good together.She took him at face value and failed to look deeper into the man.He was superficial and not trustworthy.Fortunately, or would that be unfortunately, it had been blessedly short.Nine months.This is so good, Maggie said.Your soup always puts me right.How long are you staying, honey?Im not sure.Till I get a better idea.Couple of weeks, maybe?Enid shook her head.You shouldnt come in March.You should know better than to come in March.Hes going to work me like a pack of mules, isnt he?No question about it.Only person who isnt afraid to come around in March is Frank.Sully wont put Frank to work.Frank Masterson was one of Sullys cronies.He was about the same age while Enid was just fifty five.Frank said he had had the foresight to marry a younger woman, thereby assuring himself a good caretaker for his old age.Frank owned a nearby cattle ranch that these days was just about taken over by his two sons, which freed up Frank to hang out around Sullys.Sometimes Sully would ask, Why dont you just come to work with Enid in the morning and save the gas since all you do is drink my coffee for free and butt into everyones business?When the weather was cold hed sit inside, near the stove.When the weather was decent he favored the porch.He wandered around, chatted it up with campers or folks who stopped by, occasionally lifted a heavy box for Enid, read the paper a lot.He was a fixture.Enid had a sweet, heart shaped face to go with her plump body.It attested to her love of baking.Besides making and wrapping sandwiches to keep in the cooler along with a few other lunchable items, she baked every morningsweet rolls, buns, cookies, brownies, that sort of thing.Frank ate a lot of that and apparently never gained an ounce.Maggie could hear Sully scraping out the gutters around the store.Seventy and up on a ladder, still working like a farm hand, cleaning the winter detritus away.That was the problem with Marcha lot to clean up for the spring and summer.She escaped out to the porch to visit with Frank before Sully saw her sitting around and put her to work.What are you doing here?Frank asked.Im on vacation, she said.Hm.Damn fool time of year to take a vacation.Aint nothing to do now.Dr.Mathews comin?No.Were not seeing each other anymore.Hm.That why youre here during mud season?Lickin your wounds?Not at all.Im happy about it.Yup.You look happy, all right.I might be better off cleaning gutters, she thought.So she turned the conversation to politics because she knew Frank had some very strong opinions and she could listen rather than answer questions.She spotted that guy again, the camper, sitting in his canvas camp chair outside his pop up tent/trailer under a pull out awning.His legs were stretched out and he was reading again.She noticed he had long legs.She was just about to ask Frank how long that guy had been camping there when she noticed someone heading up the trail toward the camp.He had a big backpack and walking stick and something strange on his head.Maggie squinted.A bombardiers leather helmet with earflaps?Frank, look at that, she said, leaning forward to stare.The man was old, but old wasnt exactly rare.There were a lot of senior citizens out on the trails, hiking, biking, skiing.In fact, if they were fit at retirement, they had the time and means.As the man got closer, age was only part of the issue.I best find Sully, Frank said, getting up and going into the store.As the man drew near it was apparent he wore rolled up dress slacks, black socks and black shoes that looked like theyd be shiny church or office wear once the mud was cleaned off.And on his head a weird WWII aviators hat.He wore a ski jacket that looked to be drenched and he was flushed and limping.Sully appeared on the porch, Beau wagging at his side, Frank following.What the hell?Yeah, thats just wrong, Maggie said.Ya think?Sully asked.He went down the steps to approach the man, Maggie close on his heels, Frank bringing up the rear and Enid on the porch waiting to see what was up.Well there, buddy, Sully said, his hands in his pockets.Where you headed?Is this Camp Lejeune?Everyone exchanged glances.Uh, that would be in North Carolina, son, Sully said, though the man was clearly older than Sully.Youre a little off track.Come up on the porch and have a cup of coffee, take off that pack and wet jacket.And that silly hat, for Gods sake.We need to make a phone call for you.What are you doing out here, soaking wet in your Sunday shoes?Maybe I should wait a while, see if they come, the man said, though he let himself be escorted to the porch.Who?Maggie asked.My parents and older brother, he said.Im to meet them here.Bet they have `em some real funny hats, too, Frank muttered.Seems like you got a little confused, Sully said.Whats your name, young man?Thats a problem, isnt it?Ill have to think on that for a while.Maggie noticed the camper had wandered over, curious.Up close he was distracting.He was tall and handsome, though there was a small bump on the bridge of his nose.But his hips were narrow, his shoulders wide and his jeans were torn and frayed exactly right.They met glances.She tore her eyes away.Do you know how you got all wet?Did you walk through last nights rain?Sleep in the rain?Sully asked.I fell in a creek, he said.He smiled though he also shivered.On account a those shoes, Frank pointed out.He slipped cause he aint got no tread.Well, there you go, Maggie said.Professor Frank has it all figured out.Lets get that wet jacket off and get a blanket.Sully, you better call Stan the Man.Will do.Anyone need a hand here?Maggie heard the camper ask.Can you grab the phone, Cal?Sully asked.Sully put the man in what had been Maggies chair and started peeling off his jacket and outer clothes.He leaned the backpack against the porch rail and within just seconds Enid was there with a blanket, cup of coffee and one of her bran muffins.Cal brought the cordless phone to the porch.The gentleman immediately began to devour that muffin as Maggie looked him over.Least hell be reglar, Frank said, reclaiming his chair.Maggie crouched in front of the man and while speaking very softly, she asked if she could remove the hat.Before quite getting permission she pulled it gently off his head to reveal wispy white hair surrounding a bald dome.She gently ran her fingers around his scalp in search of a bump or contusion.Then she pulled him to his feet and ran her hands around his torso and waist.You mustve rolled around in the dirt, sir, she said.I bet youre ready for a shower.He didnt respond.Sir?Anything hurt?she asked him.He just shook his head.Can you smile for me?Big, wide, smile?she asked, checking for the kind of paralysis caused by a stroke.Whered you escape from, young man?Sully asked him.Wheres your home?Wakefield, Illinois, he said.You know it?Cant say I do, Sully said.But I bet its beautiful.More beautiful than Lejeune, for sure.Can I have cream?he asked, holding out his cup.Enid took it.Of course you can, sweetheart, she said.Ill bring it right back.In a moment the gentleman sat with his coffee with cream, shivering under a blanket while Sully called Stan Bronoski.There were a number of people Sully could have reached out toa local ranger, state police aka highway patrol, even fire and rescue.But Stan was the son of a local rancher and was the police chief in Timberlake, just twenty miles south and near the interchange.It was a small department with a clever deputy who worked the internet like a pro, Officer Paul Castor.Beau gave the old man a good sniffing, then moved down the stairs to Cal who automatically began petting him.Sully handed the phone to Maggie.Stan wants to talk to you.He sounds like someone who wandered off, Stan said to Maggie.But I dont have any missing persons from nearby.Ill get Castor looking into it.Im on my way.Does he have any ID on him?We havent really checked yet, Maggie said into the phone.Why dont I do that while you drive.Heres Sully.Maggie handed the phone back to her dad and said, Pass the time with Stan while I chat with this gentleman.Maggie asked the man to stand again and deftly slid a thin wallet out of his back pocket.She urged him to sit, and opened it up.Well now, she said.Mr.Gunderson?Roy Gunderson?Hm?he said, his eyes lighting up a bit.Sully repeated the name into the phone to Stan.And so, Roy, did you hurt anything when you fell?Maggie asked.He shook his head and sipped his coffee.I fell?he finally asked.Maggie looked at Sully, lifting a questioning brow.A Mr.Gunderson from Park City, Utah, Sully said.Wandered off from his home a few days ago.On foot.He mustve gotten a ride or something, Cal said.His drivers license, which was supposed to be renewed ten years ago, says his address is in Illinois.Stan says hell probably have more information by the time he gets here, but this must be him.Dementia, he says.You can say that again, Maggie observed.I cant imagine what the last few days have been like for him.He must have been terrified.He look terrified to you?Frank asked.He might as well be on a cruise ship.Tell Stan well take care of him till he gets here.Maggie went about the business of caring for Mr.Gunderson, getting water and a little soup into him while the camper, Cal, chatted with Sully and Frank, apparently well known to them.When this situation was resolved she meant to find out more about him, like how long hed been here.She took off Roys shoes and socks and looked at his feetno injuries or frostbite but some serious swelling and bruised toenails.She wondered where he had been and how hed gotten the backpack.He certainly hadnt brought it from home or packed it himself.That would be too complicated for a man in his condition.It was a miracle he could carry it!Two hours later, the sun lowering in the sky, an ambulance had arrived for Roy Gunderson.He didnt appear to be seriously injured or ill but he was definitely unstable and Stan wasnt inclined to transport him alone.He could bolt, try to get out of a moving car or interfere with the driver, although Stan had a divider cage in his police car.What Maggie and Sully had learned, no thanks to Roy himself, was that hed been cared for at home by his wife, wandered off without his GPS bracelet, walked around a while before coming upon a rather old Chevy sedan with the keys in the ignition, so he must have helped himself.The car was reported stolen from near his house, but had no tracking device installed.And since Mr.Gunderson hadnt driven in years, no one put him with the borrowed motor vehicle for a couple of days.The car was found abandoned near Salt Lake City with Roys jacket in it.From there the old man had probably hitched a ride.His condition was too good to have walked for days.Roy was likely left near a rest stop or campgrounds where he helped himself to a backpack.Where hed been, what hed done, how hed survived was unknown.The EMTs were just about to load Mr.Gunderson into the back of the ambulance when Sully sat down on the porch steps with a loud huff.Dad?Maggie asked.Sully was grabbing the front of his chest.Over his heart.He was pale as snow, sweaty, his eyes glassy, his breathing shallow and ragged.Dad!Maggie shouted.What We Find
