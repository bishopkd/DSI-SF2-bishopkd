I noticed that.So, youre here because...?You might want someone to talk to, he said with a shrug.How was it?It was perfect, she said, smiling.Very informal and perfect.It was almost like a bunch of people were having a party on the beach and two broke away from the gathering to get married.People were standing around, visiting, having a drink.Then the judgethe same judge who married Iris and Seth, I take itstood by the arch, cleared his throat and it began.Troy and Grace stepped up in front of him, the traditional vows were repeated, they said a few sweet things to each other and that was it.A kissextralong, I think.Then it was back to mingling and enjoying the day.She looked up and around.Perfect day for it.It does seem perfect.Want to go for a ride?Where?Up the coast a little bit.Or maybe down the coast.Just to a lookout to watch the sunset.Sure.You came a long way on a bet.I mightve been busy.I know.In fact I thought you might be.I thought maybe it would go on for hours.Or maybe youd be out with friends from the wedding or something.It was just a spur of the moment thing.And if I was busy?Youd turn right around and go back?I could.Or I could call Peyton and see if shed put up with me for the night.She has mysteriously stopped lecturing me.I suspect Scott.With a hand at the small of her back, he directed her to the passenger side of the truck and helped her up and in.Then he got in the drivers side and buckled up.Do you care where we go?You decide.We could just go to Coopers.I thought after a day full of people you wouldnt mind a little quiet.Good idea, she said.Im tired, thats for sure.It was a packed week of work, sewing, trying to keep track of wedding day details to help Grace, lots of flowers.Iris and I decorated the arch they usedit was so beautiful.And its such a funny placeThunder Point.They invited a few people and everyone else heard about it or saw it and just came.Grace was ready for that, she said with a laugh.She and Troy ordered up enough food and drink to accommodate a huge crowd.In my family, if one person has an event, there is no possible way to keep it small.If youre invited and dont go, you better be prepared to bring your X rays to prove you had a broken bone.And if youre not invited, youre obligated to start a riot within the family.Nothing like a good feud.Does that really happen?she asked.You must have a very small family, if you have to ask.Its just us, mostly.The extended family is shrinking.All of Ray Annes immediate family have been gone a long time and she never had children.My grandparents are gone.My folks are in their sixties, my brothers almost forty...All it takes is one renegade who decides to have a bunch of kids and suddenly youre a country, he said.She laughed.In the Basque culture, thats not really a renegade, now is it?My generation hasnt been as prolific as some.Most of my brothers and sisters want a reasonable couple of kids.Except Ellieshe already has five and wants more.She started real young.Peyton wasnt going to have anythen she met Scott and got knocked up before the wedding.But she doesnt have time for too many.Plus, she loves that little clinic.Shes not going to trade off her medical profession for the mommy track.What about you?she asked.Do you want children?I certainly did, he said.But Im a little old fashioned.First Im going to have to find a happy marriage.And just like you, thats not going to happen soon.Were stung, Ginger.Were both still in recovery.Bad time to try to partner up with happily ever after in mind.I suppose it is, she said.This looks like a good spot, he said, pulling into a wide lookout.He maneuvered the truck around and backed in.Its going to be kind of hard to see like this, she said.Wait, youre going to love this.He jumped out of the truck and ran around to her side, helping her out.He directed her to the back, lowering the tailgate to the truck bed.Inside the bed of the truck were a couple of lounge pillows, blankets and a cooler.Wow, was all she could say.This was how my parents went to the drive in movie.For myself, Ive never been to a drive in movie, but my dad explained courting in his daycouples couldnt be alone in the backseat of a car, which is why drive ins were invented, I think.So they got cozy in the back of a truck.Im kind of dressed up, she said.He smiled.And beautifully, too.Ive got you covered, he said, and jumped into the truck bed.He unrolled and spread out a sleeping bag on the bottom of the bed, shook out a blanket and covered the lounge pillows, then jumped out.He laced his fingers together to assist her in getting in.Hand on my head and up you go.Is this legal?she asked.What?Parking at the lookout?Why not?I dont know.Seems kind of...Naughty?he asked with a grin.Come on, up you go.She climbed in, laughing as she kneeled and then, adjusting her skirt, crawled to the front of the bed where the pillows were.She couldnt stop laughing as she sat down against the pillows, smoothed her skirt and relaxed.He sat beside her, and when she rubbed her arms because she was a little chilly, he grabbed another blanket and spread it over her, tucking it around her shoulders.This is genius, she said.He lifted the lid of the cooler.Drink?What have you got in there?she asked, peering into the cooler.Water, soda, tea, a couple of juice drinks.Ill pass.After all, being a guy, you can pee out of the back of a truck.Life isnt that simple for a girl.Were completely alone, he said, mischief in his smile.You could safely manage nearby.Just as he said that, a car pulled in the lookout not far from them and an older couple got out and walked to the edge of the lookout.The gentleman had a very large camera hanging around his neck.They waved hello, then went about the business of photographing the sinking sun over the Pacific.Well, well be alone again in a few minutes.Ill pass, she said.But it was sunset.And sunset over the Pacific was a good show.There wasnt exactly a crowd, but there were quite a few cars that pulled in to watch.Some folks got out and walked around, some stayed in their cars, and every time a car pulled into the lookout, Ginger laughed.At one point she wanted her cell phone to take her own picture and realized that, of course, she hadnt taken a bag to the wedding and had no phone.Matt got his out of his pocket and handed it to her.Click away and send them to yourself.Cars came and went, and Ginger took a few pictures of the sunset.It was better out here than at Coopers, probably because it felt closer, there being no beach or bay between her and the setting sun.She snuggled under the warm blanket and before long darkness overtook them.And they were alone.Matt put an arm around her and pulled her closer, up against his big, warm body.If you do that, I might fall asleep on you, she said.He gently kissed her forehead.You fall asleep if you want to.Youre safe.She felt safe.In fact, she felt cherished.Protected.It was a feeling she hadnt had very often.They were alone, quiet in the dark, and she felt a contentment wash over her.Shed like to stay here, just like this, forever.He turned toward her and gently kissed her forehead, her temple, her cheek, her ear.She lifted her lips, and he touched them with his.Then he adjusted slightly to take her into his arms and cover her mouth with a sweet and thorough kiss, holding her close.Oh, God, he was a very good kisser.She let her lips part slightly.Very.Good.She escaped the warmth of the blanket to wrap her arms around his neck and hold him closer.She gave herself to his mouth, his arms, and it was pure heaven.She tried to think when she last enjoyed physical affection like this and it was blurry.Long before she got pregnant.Oh, thered been sex.But that feeling of being adored, of being swept away, of falling into some kind of bliss, that was long ago.Headlights strafed them, causing them to reluctantly break apart.A highway patrol cruiser pulled up beside them.The spotlight at the top of the car shone on them.The trooper got out and stood up, looking at them over the top of the vehicle.You folks okay there?Well, we were, Matt said with a laugh.Whats going on there?he asked.We were making out, if you need to know.Drinking?he asked.No, sir, Matt said.Youre welcome to check.Got a cooler of drinks herewater, soda, et cetera.Were enjoying the sunset.And then some.Well, I hate to throw a wet blanket on this party, but I dont think its wise, using this spot for romance.You arent breaking any laws, but youre real isolated.Youd be better off getting a room.At least the door locks.Point taken, Matt said.The trooper drove away, and Matt put his arms around her again.You afraid to be out here alone?With just me?I have a feeling you could keep me safe.He kissed her again.Long and wet and deep.Ginger, I dont know whether to congratulate myself or apologize.Ive been wanting to do that for a while now, but we both know Im a mess.She ran her fingers over his scruffy cheek.Please dont apologize.I wont, he said.I should get you home.Whenever youre ready.They were quiet on the drive back, but held hands all the way.When he parked in front of Ray Annes house, he leaned across the console to give her a brief kiss.And when he helped her out of the truck, he stood there with her for a moment, embracing her and kissing her deeply.She couldnt help it, she was melting into him and wanting him.Wanting him so much.I had a nice surprise today, she whispered against his lips.Grace is giving up her little apartment over the shop.She offered it to me.She smiled at him.Im going to have my own place soon.How soon?he asked, surprise in his voice.A couple of days, actually.Ray Anne has been so generous, but shes used to living alone.And she does have a boyfriend.He lifted her hand and held it close between their bodies.Do you have a boyfriend, miss?Not sure, she said.But I think I want one.He gave her another quick kiss, then turned her toward the house.Ill call you tomorrow.A New Hope        Ten He ran.He couldve stayed overnight at his sisters house and had a more leisurely drive in the morning, maybe even a little more time with Ginger, but instead Matt hit the road and headed north, though it was almost nine.He was a little panicked.Most definitely conflicted.He was falling in love with Ginger and it was a bad idea for him to be in love.If he recalled, he had two gearsnot in love and thinking straight or in love and a complete idiot.He wanted to fall into Ginger and drown in her.She was going to let him.And now she was getting her own place.Where they would be alone.It was dark and he didnt have the radio on, so he tried interviewing himself to see if he could figure out what was happening to him.Was he over Natalie?Most definitely.He might still find her beautiful but he didnt want her back.So then, what was the problem?Well, he thought hed known Natalie.He had trusted her, more or less.What had he failed to see?He had known she wasnt perfect, and that was okay with him because he wasnt perfect, either, and damn, she seemed good enough for him.So she wasnt into the farm.He thought hed been okay with that, but what if he wasnt?What if hed secretly expected her to come around?So she wanted to have more fun?Didnt wives always want a little more than what they were getting?There wasnt any Achilles heel he couldnt live with, or so hed thought.Hed had no illusionsshe wasnt going to wear overalls and rubber boots and dig in the ground.Ever.She would never share his passion.But he mightve thought shed eventually develop a grudging respect for it.He knew his brothers looked at him with a combination of envy and amusement.Natalie wasnt practical or earthy, but she was gorgeous and laughed at his jokes.She would always wear sexy, inconvenient clothes and ridiculous high heels.And the most amazing underwear...and when she wrapped those long legs around him, hed leave the earth for a while.Of course he now realized you cant build a real relationship on hot underwear and sexual abandon.There had to be more.A lot more.He was falling in love with something morea woman he could really talk to, a woman with values that matched more closely to his own, a woman who wanted a family.A quiet, gentle, loving woman with an inner strength so powerful it humbled him; a woman he respected.Admired.A woman who turned him on, made him so hot he wondered if hed snap!He realized he was terrified of that, with good reason.Once he fell into Ginger and experienced her, he was not going to be able to go back.Ginger wanted a stable home life, a solid man to lean on, a grounded future.He wanted to be that man.What if he was getting all the wrong signals?Again?She seemed so transparent, but...It was pretty easy to look back at his brief marriage and realize Natalie hadnt really surprised him that much.She wasnt much of a giver, that Natalie.She mightve done some selfish things that shocked him but when he looked back, they shouldnt have.He shouldve seen it coming.She was focused on herself, her needs.He always knew it was all about Natalie being happy, being entertained, being satisfied, having lots of attention heaped on her.And there was the problem.When he fell for a woman all the blood drained from his brain and his eyes glazed over.He stopped thinking logically.He stopped being pragmatic.What if he let go, let himself fall for Ginger?And what if it was a big mistake?What if there were some other things he couldnt see right now, lurking, that would keep them from having a successful long term relationship?Like?Oh, hell, he didnt know.If he knew, he could check them out, examine them.Sometimes these things sneaked up on you.He was going to have to be still and quiet for a little while.It would be a good time to dig, aerate, fertilize, trim and prune.He should be by himself and spend some time in his head.Thinking of all the possibilities, because Ginger was getting her own place.With a door that closed.With a bed in it.If he was wrong about a woman he felt that strongly for again, it was going to be ugly.* * * Ginger hoped Matt had stayed over at his sisters house Saturday night and would call her on Sunday.She hoped he had because it had been far too late by the time he could have begun his four hour drive north.But her phone didnt ring.So she told herself a different storyhed gotten up early and headed back to the farm, got caught up in the after church family circus with twenty people at the table.So later, he would call her later.She stayed busy, longing to talk to him.Theyd just had that romance at the lookout, the kissing, the whispering, and she wanted to hear him talk about it.He was gentle but there was such a power there; she could feel the tension in his arms, his body, as he was reining it in, keeping all those runaway emotions under control.She walked the beach in the early afternoon.She stopped off at Coopers bar, which was hopping because it was a sunny Sunday.Even Troy was working, getting out kayaks and paddleboards for rent.I cant believe youre working, she said.You just got married last night!I know, but I was up early.We had a great breakfast with the family and now theyre all headed home.Grace is exhausted and shes taking a nap.I think we wore out Winnie, too.The only person with energy to spare is Mikhailhes looking for things to do.Last I saw him, he was headed into town on foot, determined to look around.You should be with Grace, she said.Shh, dont tell, but I got restless.I dont want a nap.Im going to go over to the loft in a little while and clean it up for you.You do want it, right?I do, she said excitedly.Ive only been in it a couple of times.Can I go, too?Help?Sure, he said with a shrug.Im going to give Cooper a couple more hours.Should I call you?You can.Or...I think Ill go to the shop and make sure everything is right for tomorrow morning.Ill be over there already.So, back to town she went.There wasnt a lot to do in the shop, though the Saturday rush for the wedding had left it a little messy.The arch was standing in the alley beside the back door, as promised, and had to be dismantled and put away.There was the usual sweeping and wiping down to do.She listened to the work cell, but there were only congratulatory messages for Grace and no orders.She looked at her own cell phone several times, wondering why Matt wasnt calling.There was a kernel of fear in her.She couldnt wait any longer.She texted him.Are you home safely?Then she stared at the phone, waiting.He didnt reply.If she didnt hear from him soon, she would call Peyton.In the meantime, she began to tidy the back room and office.The phone that a couple of months ago she didnt even care to recharge was now in her pocket.She was waiting for it to chime or ring.And she hated that!She went from tidying and wiping to scrubbing, putting a lot of muscle into it, making that scarred old worktable shine.Waiting.It brought to mind how she waited to hear from Mick, to hear he was nearby and could see her or out of town on some gig but thinking of her.Waiting for his affection, waiting for him to come to bed in the wee hours, waiting, always waiting for some affirmation from him.Didnt he feel horrible about leaving her alone and pregnant?Didnt he want to at least discuss the divorce?Make a compromise?Didnt he wonder how she was getting along?Wonder about the baby?She almost reached out to him ten thousand times and it took a will of iron not to but she could remember the agony of that waiting so clearly, it mightve been yesterday.And had that agony ever touched him?Not in the slightest way.This next song is going to be it, babe, its going to push me to the top.Her phone chimed, and she pulled it out.Twenty five minutes had passed when Matt responded.Safe and sound.She waited, staring at the phone screen.Was there nothing more?No, talk to you later?Hope you werent worried?Had a good time last night?Nothing.She felt her eyes well with tears and told herself to stop!She couldnt be that woman again, that woman in love and desperate to have her passions returned.She couldnt cry for attention from a man, hoping hed call, hoping hed notice, hoping hed care.It was too painful, living in a one sided relationship.She turned off her phone.She blew her nose.It wasnt long before Troy arrived, knocked on the locked back door of the shop and then took Ginger upstairs.It was such a darling little apartment.One room, really, the bedroom separated from the living room by an arch.There was plenty of room for one person, a large bathroom, the linen closet, which held a stacked washer and dryer along with shelves, a galley kitchen with a few cupboards and a table for two.But there was a regular size sectional and wall unit holding a TV.The bed was queen size and there was a wall unit of drawers and closet space.This is adorable, she told Troy.He was busy moving around the little apartment, checking the bathroom, bedroom, kitchen.Well, I should have known.My mother wouldnt leave a speck of dust behind.He flipped open the lid of the washer.I guess this means you even have clean sheets on the bed.Ill run this load of sheets, make sure the bathroom is clean and Youll do no such thing, she said.Ill take care of that.I know you have your own apartment to clean up.Didnt I hear you say youre taking the living room furniture for your game room in the new house?There will be no games in the game room, he said.That will be our living room.Its a good apartment for us.What do you need from here?Ginger asked.I think Grace took everything we could use when we moved to Winnies house.I cleaned out the fridge before my folks came and since we dont have our own kitchen, Grace left some kitchen things here.Im going to move out of my place this week now that I dont need the space for family.This is very thoughtful of you and Grace, Ginger said.And if you ever have family coming to town, just say the word.I always have space at Ray Annes house.I can give you back this guest room whenever you need it.Thanks, well try not to impose, he said.I guess you can have it whenever you want.And heres the key.Is there anything else here you want to take with you?Grace moved all her personal things out early last week.Everything left here is for your use.You shouldnt need too much.He picked up the container of laundry detergent and gave it a shake.You only have a couple more loads in this, he said.You are a very good landlord, she told him with a smile.I imagine youll be a perfect tenant.He looked around.She was really smart to do this, wasnt she?Right over the store and all.She was smart about everything.I thought Id have to do some cleaning but there are even vacuum tracks.Its all yoursmove in whenever you want.Im going back out to the beach to see if I can get Cooper to help me move.With his truck.He grinned.And Ill walk back to Ray Annes and give her the good newsshe can have her life back.Im sure she loved having you.Im sure shell love having time with Al more.But no worries, Im sure Ill see Ray Anne every day.As she was walking back through town to Ray Annes she thought about her new life.That was easy.I am not going to be lonely; I am not pining over some man who wants me one minute, cant remember my phone number the next.Im a whole person.I have a great job, a super loft to live in, good friends, a little family nearby...But she gave him forty eight hours to remember he had kissed her passionately and promised to call.Forty eight hours to get a text, a message, a call.Then shed changed her cell phone number.* * * How do you like that little space upstairs?Grace asked Ginger.Oh, its perfect, she said.My mother is sending a couple of boxes of thingsmy favorite books, DVDs, stuff I wouldnt have thought to bring since I was only staying a couple of weeks.The last time I was home I went through my closet and brought all the clothes that still fit me.And there are a few boxes in my closet, things packed up from my rental house when I moved out.I worked in housewares and in bridal registriesI have some of the prettiest wineglasses, earthenware, sheets and towels, and small items that there will be plenty of room for.Ive always used the cooler to refrigerate things I didnt have room for in that little fridge, Grace said.Ive already figured that out, she said.Poor Ray Anne, she didnt know whether to jump for joy or cry when I told her I had my own place.Ive had to reassure her that were still close, we can get together for dinner, for a glass of wine, for girls night...Grace wandered over to the front window and looked out.I think shes convinced this will be better in the long run.She needs personal space and I need to not hide in the bedroom with the door closed when Al is on the property, she said with a laugh.Grace turned from the window.She wore a melancholy expression.Mikhail, she said.Hes taken to long walks while Winnie is having her morning washing and primping rituals and again in the afternoon while shes taking her nap.But he gets her breakfast, makes sure she has lunch and, although he doesnt think I know this, he sleeps in the chair in her bedroom at night.Ohhh, Ginger said.That is so sweet.I had no idea how devoted he is to my mother.Are they in love?I dont think so, not the love wed identify with.I dont know if theyre like best friends, brother and sister or an aging couple.I think Mikhail is grateful to Winnie for all the years they were a team, while I was in training.He became like a father to me after my own father died.And of course, he took direction from Winnie, who had hired him.And Winnie took direction from Mikhail, who had great training instincts.I think hes going to hang in there till the end.I dont want him to be lonely.And when you say the end?No one knows.There are oddsmost people dont live many years after theyre diagnosed and Winnie was diagnosed a few years ago.On the other hand, there are cases of people who live many years.How is she feeling?Ginger asked.She feels pretty good.If it werent for weakness, trembling and fatigue, youd never know.Her mindsharp as a tack.She chuckled.They sure can throw the gibes back and forth, Winnie and Mikhail.They bicker like an old married couple.You have so much to deal with, Ginger said.Youre very strong.We all have so much to deal with, Grace said.Havent you figured this out yet?No one has it easy.I always thought the pressure I had on the circuit was the most extraordinary pressure in the world and no one would ever understand.Then I met others who had challenges entirely different from mine and even more difficult.Then I met you.Youre one of the most amazing women Ive ever known.And the most loving and giving.Aw, she said, blushing.Maybe a little too loving and giving sometimes, she thought.Ive been meaning to askI heard a rumor that Matt Lacoumette showed up Saturday night.True, she said, busying herself with some receipts on the counter.I ran into him on my way home from the wedding.And?Grace asked, a twinkle in her eye.And what?Ginger asked.Did you spend any time with him?A little bit, she said.In fact, we drove up the coast a few miles to a lookout where a lot of people enjoyed the sunset.It was beautiful.I have a picture, she said, taking out her cell phone and flipping through some pictures.There were lots of pictures of floral arrangements shed created and thentwo pictures of the sunset, texted from Matts phone.And one selfieMatts arm around her, both of them smiling into the camera.Well now, Grace said.Theres a happy couple.Just friends, she said.But youve spent a lot of time on the phone, right?And you went to see him at the farm?I was on my way back from Portland and it was on the way, Ginger said.Its a wonderful farm.So, maybe this will turn into something a little more than friendship?Grace suggested by way of a question.Ginger only shrugged, looking back at her receipts.What does Matt say about that?After all, he drove all the way to Thunder Point to see you.I dont know.I havent heard from Matt.Really?But you gave him your new cell number, right?Ginger gave Grace her full attention.I didnt, she said.You dont like Matt?Grace asked, looking a little surprised and confused.Sure, I like him.Ever been in love with the wrong guy, Grace?Matts the wrong guy?Grace asked.I dont know, but I know what its like to love the wrong guy.To stalk him, follow him, call him, wait for his calls and even when theyre long overdue, melting into one big puddle because he finally deigned to go to the trouble of making a phone call.I did that already and I put that far behind meI dont want to ever be that lonely, desperate girl againits just too painful and shameful.So, Matt and I talked almost every night.Then we went to see the sunset, talked and laughed and kissed.Truthfully, we made out like crazyit was so nice.I havent had that in my life for well over a year, over two years, maybe.Its been so long since I had strong feelings for a guy that werent all gnarled up with regret.You know those feelings, right?Think about him all day, cant wait to talk to him at night...Or in my case, cant wait for him to sneak up the back stairs...Grace admitted, smiling devilishly.Oh, that must have been so romantic, Ginger said.It was so romantic.So, you had those feelings?She nodded.And then I realized that once again, I was having those feelings all by myself.Are you sure about that?You tell me.We told each other deeply personal things, kissed like romantic fools, he said hed call and he didnt.Well, maybe Maybe he was in a car accident?Ginger asked.Worried, I texted, asking if he made it home safely.And he texted back three words.Safe and sound.There was nothing more.I waited for days.Grace got a very naughty smile on her face.And you changed your number.Well, that was really overdue.I told you my ex called, right?He shouldnt have my number...You did this for a bigger reason than that.You can hang up on your ex.She laughed softly.Oh, I did.Hes such an idiotyou know what he said?Something like, Gee, Ginger, youre a little hostile.She laughed harder.Really?Me?Hostile?I wonder why?You did this to show Matt.Show him what?If he wanted to find me, hed know where to look, right?If he wanted my new number, he knows where I work.No, Im not punishing Matt.Youre not fooling me, Grace said.And good for you!Ha!I did that to Troy, you know.Right before we got engaged.I told him I was pregnant and he said he had a lot to think about, to process, that he needed time to think before he could decide where we go from here.Before he decided?Like it was up to him and didnt really have much to do with me!I was only the pregnant one, but heyTroy would figure it out and let me know what we would do next.I told him to take a hike, stay away from me and be sure to let me know when hed processed.I was so done putting up with indecisiveness from a man!I didnt know you did that.Well, I probably dont look that stubborn.And you certainly dont.Oh, Ill be the first to admit I feel a little sad that its been days and Matt hasnt tried to contact me.Maybe he has the flu.Or was finally put in jail and needs his phone calls to get a lawyer.Hopefully the latter.Grace, this isnt about him.I dont think Matt has any ulterior motives.This is about me.Im never going to that place againthat insecure, lonely, desperate, unloved place.Im not waiting and hoping.If I ever have a man in my life again, its not going to be because Im fantasizing, its going to be because hes made sure I know it.She took a breath.Very likely I will be alone.But with this new start of mine, with a good job, friends, familyIm not going to be that sad, disappointed person.I dont want to be that person ever again.Grace leaned a hip onto the front counter, half sitting.Her hands were folded across that raised thigh.Fair enoughyou should never be sad or lonely.Youre too wonderful.But I want to tell you something.Coming from me, I dont know, you might want to get a second opinion since I have so little experience.Troy was my first real love.But theres something I learned.In love were vulnerable, Ginger.It would be nice if it were more certain and immediate, but the truth iswe have our worries, doubts and fears.We have to inch our way along.We have to discover trust.Sometimes we have to just believe in someone.And sometimes we have to know when to let them go.I guess thats what Im trying to learn, Ginger said.Its possible Matts just not ready.After all, he went through some heartache, too.A New Hope        Eleven Matt brought a cooler full of dead chickens into the kitchen for his mother.She was going to pluck, wash, butcher and freeze them.Since hed been hanging around the farm, she snagged him for butcher duty.Help me with this, she said, throwing a headless hen in her work sink.It wont take that long.And I wanted to ask you why you put in such long days and such silent nights.He frowned.Silent nights?Youre at my table every night.And youre back to being quiet and withdrawn.You think we dont see?I have things on my mind, Mama.Nothing for you to worry about.Im not depressed at all.Ah, she said, plucking away with hands that moved over that chicken carcass like greased lightning.Maybe you think about that pretty friend of Peytons, that Ginger.She looks like ginger, doesnt she?Kind of golden.Ive been thinking about the farm, the house Id like to build.Its a big step, building a house, he said.And how is that pretty Ginger?Im sure shes fine, he said.I should call her.Oh, I thought you liked her.I do like her, he said.Corinne laughed softly, feathers flying.She held up a naked, plump hen.Im behind the times, but usually when a man likes a woman, he pays attention to her.She lives in Thunder Point.I cant exactly carry her books home from school, Matt said irritably.I understand that.Just so youre not confusing her with Natalie, Corinne said.Theyre not alike.I know that, he said.Im going to go clean the mess in the barn.Then Im going out.Of course.Friday night, Corinne said.No dinner tonight?Ill take care of my own dinner.Have a nice time.Ill see you Sunday?Maybe, he said.I put in a long week.He wasnt going to share dinner if they were going to be watching him.You did.I think you worked harder than Paco, not easy to do.The farm is quiet for now.You should take advantage of it.I was catching up.Ill see you soon.And youre welcome for killing ten hens.Nasty work.You made a quick job of it.Why couldnt she thank him?he wondered.All his parents could do was get in his business.He scrubbed up in the barn, then got in his truck.He had a problem with that pretty Ginger.First, he had granted himself a couple of days to think about things, about her.Then he realized he had ignored her, hadnt called when he said he would and probably either pissed her off or hurt her feelings, and that took a couple more days of silence.Here it was Friday and last Saturday night he had promised to call her the next day.When he was younger hed have pretended that hed forgotten or hed have made up some excuse.Ginger was too smart to fall for that.Hed been all knotted up inside because he was starting to need her, want her so much, maybe love her.He wanted to examine that for a little while, privately, with none of the confusion that came with having those long, quiet, intimate talks.Or the scent of her skin.Or the taste of her lips.Or her softness.Or the way she felt in his arms.He wanted to be sure he wasnt setting both of them up for disappointment before he went one step further.Then his mother, who knew everything, said, As long as you dont confuse her with Natalie.And he snapped out of it.Ginger had emotional sturdiness; she knew how she felt.She wasnt always thinking of herself first.In fact, how she could help others seemed very important to her.Whether they talked or kissed, she was so honest about her feelings, far more honest than he had been.This was a high quality woman.And hed been screwing around, wondering what to do next?Before leaving the farm, sitting in his truck, he called her.This number is no longer in service.He tried it five more times.Then he called Peyton, who was still at the clinic.Hey, Peyton, Gingers phone is disconnected.Somethings wrong.Nothings wrong.She got a new number.Huh?Okay, I need the number, he said.Why?You lose it?Ah.Yeah.Lost it.That hesitation ruined him.You liar, she said.She didnt give it to you.Why didnt she give it to you?Did she get a new number because of you?No!No!I think it was her ex.She said he called her...or something.When did you talk to her last?Peyton demanded.Come on, is this really your job, deciding who gets her phone number?Give me a break, will you?I want to talk to her.Right away.You screwed this up, didnt you?Peyton, he said in a threatening tone.Then he calmed himself and took a breath.Okay, listen, I mightve done a stupid thing...Shocker, Peyton said.Matt wanted to reach through the phone and strangle her.Okay, listen, we were together last Saturday night after the wedding.I took her out, we had a great time.I wanted to see her again right away, it was that great.But I thought maybe I should think this through since my track record is, you know Shitty?Peyton filled in.I was going to say spotty.Jesus, could you be any less supportive?I took a little time to think it through, okay?I was starting to have those feelings, you know?I scared myself a little.I made a big mistake with Natalie.I didnt want to do that to Ginger.Shes too sweet to have some idiot like me make a poor decision and get her into something not good for either one of us.So yeah, I shouldnt have waited to call her, but I had to think it through.So thats it.I know Ginger isnt like Natalie and Im not like I was with Natalie and I thought about things and...I need that number now.Wow, thats kind of mature, Matt.Fessing up like that.Admitting youre wrong and everything.So?The number?No, she said.And disconnected.He looked at the phone and told his sister he hated her.It took him a while to get the number for the flower shop because he couldnt remember Pretty Petals.Then when he called, Ginger didnt answer.He assumed it was Grace and he said, Hi.Is Ginger there, please?Sure.Can I tell her whos calling?The moment of truth, he thought.Its Matt.Matt Lacoumette.Oh, hi, Matt.Hold on.Shes pulling in displays.He heard Grace summon Ginger, and then she came on the line.Hi, Matt.How are you?I dont know, he said.You tell me.Did you change your number because of me?Because youre angry?No, of course not.I changed it because it needed to be changed and no, Im not angry.But I cant really talk right nowwere closing up the shop and its busy.When can we talk?Hmm, lets see.I have plans tonight, right after I get cleaned up.Im going out to dinner with Ray Anne and some friends.Maybe I could give you a call later, if its not too late.Ginger, I was calling you to tell you I know I screwed up.I didnt call when I said I would.I hardly answered your text.I ignored you.You really scared me when my call wouldnt go through.I should explain.I was thinking about us, about whether Matt!Matt!I cant wait to hear all about it but I really cant talk right now.Its a little busy here and I dont want to keep my friends waiting.I have to sign off.Well catch up later.She disconnected.Matt sat there in shock.All confidence was gone.The Ginger he was falling in love with just announced it to the world.She would not be taken for granted.She wasnt going to put up with vague messages and broken promises.Shed already been there once.She was all done with that.And like a shotgun blast he understood everything.The whole time he was getting closer to Ginger hed been focused on Natalie and a relationship that hadnt worked from the start.That was mistake number one.Then hed built a barrier of self protection, aloofness.Distance from the woman he knew better after a couple of months than hed known his own wife in a year.Mistake number two.So, mistake number three would be sitting there like a doofus, acting confused and licking his wounds.A little fight replaced his sudden lack of confidence.* * * Ginger hung up and went back outside the shop.She rolled up the awning and dragged a big pot of colorful mums into the store.She stopped dragging when she ran smack into Grace.Its not as though I meant to eavesdrop, Grace said.Bull.You probably wanted me to put it on speaker.That wouldve been helpful.Sowhat did he want?Apparently he wants to grovel.I wonder when he figured it out?I think about ten minutes ago.I have to say, Im very relieved...Whats his story?Well, obviously I dont have the whole story, but I think the gist isMatts a little gun shy.He married the wrong girl.I think he sort of knew it all along and married her anyway, and of course it didnt work out.And he likes me, which I think scares him.My educated guess is he doesnt want to screw up again.Youd have to understand his family a little better to appreciate where hes coming from.I know you met them, but its entirely different when you sit down to Sunday dinner with them.Theyre so enmeshed in each others personal lives, its hard to have a secret.I imagine theyve all given multiple opinions about where Matt went wrong with his first wife.Matt pretends to be completely independent and to not really care what anyone thinks, but trust mehe doesnt want his family to see him make another mistake.And so?He didnt call for almost a week?What was he doing?Brooding, Ginger said, going back outside to fetch a couple more displays.I guess you snapped him out of it, Grace said.Possibly, Ginger said.But the important thing was to snap me out of it.Theres nothing more pathetic than a girl with a ridiculous, moody crush, singing love songs to herself, kissing her own hand and fantasizing, checking the phone every five minutes to see if he called yet.I tried just turning off the phone, but then Id turn it back on to check for messages every fifteen minutes.You want to make out with me in the bed of a pickup truck then string me along for a week?No, not going to happen.Ginger went back outside, pulled in another pot of colorful summer flowers, stopped short just inside the door.All this happened in the bed of a pickup truck?Grace asked.Ginger, might you have left out some details before.It was so lovely.He had a sleeping bag to spread out, a cooler of soft drinks, a couple of blankets because it gets cold when the sun goes down.He said it was how his parents used to go to the drive in movie and it was fun.And then all the other people who had driven to the lookout to watch the sunset were gone and it was just ustalking, laughing, kissing.A trooper pulled in to make sure we were all right.She laughed.Good thing it hadnt gone any further, right?Will you call him tonight?Sure.If it isnt too late when I get home.Im not playing games here.I dont mean to punish him.I just think guidelines are important.You could just give him your number, Grace said.I could have, couldnt I?When I talk to him next, Ill give it to him if he asks.You might not be playing games, Grace said.But you were sending a message, dont bother to deny it.And he got it.I think were done out here, Ginger said, speaking of the front walk in front of the shop.Ready for the closed sign?Ready.Im just going to clean up my office and shut down the computer, then Im headed home.I suppose youre going upstairs to wash off the flowers before dinner with the girls?I am.By the way, have I told you how much I love it up there?Its like a little cocoon.Its just perfect for me.I nestle in at night, flip through the channels or listen to music, relax, read, check emails on my laptop, fall asleep in my little nest.Its so wonderful, Grace.I know, she said, grinning.You tell me five times a day.Have I told you how wonderful it is having you in charge of the shop, opening and closing, taking orders, giving me so much freedom?Five times a day, Ginger said.Ginger went upstairs to shower and change.Tonight was dinner at a Greek restaurant in Bandon and she was looking forward to it very much.It would be Ray Anne, Lou, Carrie, Gina and Ginas daughter and stepdaughter, Ashley and Eve.Three generations, more or less.With the college girls home for the summer, their group had grown and become even more fun.Ginger got the biggest kick out of these college girls and their stories, even as their mother, grandmother and aunt cringed.She was feeling much better about herself since she started living independently and, in truth, since Matt had tracked her down and apologized.She looked good, felt good and didnt look at her watch even once.She was home at a little after nine, kicked off her shoes, dropped onto the couch while still chuckling over one of the funny stories told over dinner.And she thought, Look at meI have a life.She would not have believed a few short months ago, when she was mired in depression and hopelessness, that she could have thislaughter and enthusiasm and anticipation.She couldnt believe shed ever look like she was among the living, much less look in the mirror and actually admire the reflection.She heard tapping at her back door and wondered if Ray Anne needed something or if someone was looking for flowers.But she opened the door to Matts frowning but so handsome face.If you dont want me in your life anymore, you have to tell me to my face, he said.She laughed and stepped back so he could come in.Thats funny?he asked irritably.Well, yes.Not talking to a guy never worked for me before.Usually they could care less.I just got home, Matt.You came all this way?I was going to call you.You were?I said I would, she told him.And there is no reason I wouldnt.You came all this way because I got a new phone number?I came all this way because I have to apologize, he said.Again she smiled.Their first dinner together, the beginning of a most unexpectedly lovely relationship, had been about apology.Since you really excel at apologies, I look forward to it.He shut the door behind him, slid an arm around her waist and deftly brought her mouth up to his, kissing her.She was bent over his arm and hung on to his shoulders to keep from crumpling to the floor.His kiss was hot and demanding and delicious.Then he moved, his hands on her face, holding her against him, covering her mouth with an almost desperate heat.Her lips opened for him, and he swept the inside of her mouth with his tongue, and she not only allowed this but welcomed it.She held him close, moaning.Sighing.It was a very long time before he let her go even enough to speak.He panted eagerly.Well.Youre pretty messed up, she said.We really have to talk.Maybe a little later...And she went back to his lips, her arms around his neck.I couldnt give you up if I wanted to, he whispered.I dont want to.Then he sighed and put his lips against her neck, holding her close.God, I thought youd given up on me.But youre the one who disappeared, not me.I know.I know.Im not good at this, havent you figured that out yet?She laughed as she ran her fingers through his thick, black hair.Oh, I dont know, youre pretty good...She pulled back a little so she could look into those troubled, coal black eyes.I dont know what youre holding inside, but if you dont get it out pretty soon, youre going to start getting headaches.Worse headaches.How did you know?he asked.She shrugged.I dont have headaches anymore.She kissed his cheek tenderly.If you cant trust me with whatever it is, there must be someone you can talk to.A priest, maybe?He laughed.Definitely not a priest.Then he kissed her neck, holding her against him.I feel better already.He ran his hand down her back and over her butt.Much better.Maybe we could sit down.Would you like something to drink?He looked down into her eyes.Can I have something to drink later?Right now all I want is you.And I want you real damn bad.You should have given me a little notice...For what?You feel like velvet and you taste like...hmm.Heaven.What is that smell in your hair?Its like dessert.Vanilla.I dont have any birth control...His laugh was deep and a little evil.He looked into her eyes again, and his were getting fiery.Ill take care of you, he said.Im prepared.She shook her head.How does that not surprise me?Dont most men bring flowers or champagne or chocolates?Okay, forget the flowers...Ill do that next time.This timeI was in a little panic.She pressed herself against him.I think the panic has passed.Are you ready for this?Ill be careful.Ill take good care of you.I trust you, Matt.
