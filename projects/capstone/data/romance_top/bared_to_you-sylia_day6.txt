12  Gideon found me in the shower the next morning.He strode into the master bath gloriously nude, moving with that sleek confident grace Id admired from the beginning.His hair framed his face and shoulders in a sexy disheveled mane, a look that screamed a woman had clenched the rough black silk in greedy hands.Watching the flexing of his muscles as he moved, I didnt even pretend not to stare at the magnificent package between his legs.Despite the heat of the water, my nipples beaded tight and goose bumps raced across my skin.His knowing smile as he joined me told me he knew exactly what kind of effect he had on me.I retaliated by running soapy hands all over his godlike body; then sitting on the bench and sucking him off with such enthusiasm he had to support himself with both palms pressed flat against the tile.His raw, raspy instructions echoed in my mind the entire time I dressed for work, which I did quickly before he had a chance to finish his shower and fuck the hell out of me as hed threatened to just before spurting fiercely down my throat.Hed had no nightmares during the night.Sex as a sedative seemed to be working, and I was extremely grateful for that.I hope you dont think youve gotten away, he said when he prowled after me into the kitchen.Immaculately dressed in a black pinstriped suit, he accepted the cup of coffee I handed him and gave me a look that promised all sorts of wicked things.I saw him in his supremely civilized attire and thought of the insatiable male whod slipped into my bed during the night.My blood quickened.I was sore, my muscles thrumming with remembered pleasure, and I was still thinking about more.Keep looking at me like that, he warned, leaning casually into the counter and sipping his coffee.See what happens.Im going to lose my job over you.Id give you another one.I snorted.As what?Your sex slave?What a provocative suggestion.Lets discuss.Fiend, I muttered, rinsing out my mug in the sink and putting it in the dishwasher.Ready?For work?He finished his coffee and I held out my hand for his mug, but he bypassed me and rinsed it out himself.Another mortal task that made him seem accessible, less of a fantasy Id never have a chance of holding on to.He faced me.I want to take you out to dinner tonight, and then take you home to my bed.I dont want you to burn out on me, Gideon.He was a man used to being alone, a man who hadnt had a meaningful physical relationship in a long time, if ever.How long before his flight instincts kicked in?Besides, we really needed to stay out of the public eye as a couple  Dont make excuses.His features hardened.You dont get to decide I cant do this.I kicked myself for offending him.He was trying and I needed to make sure he got credit for that, not discouragement.Thats not what I meant.I just dont want to crowd you.Plus we still need to   Eva.He sighed, the hard tension leaving him with that frustrated exhalation.You have to trust me.Im trusting you.Ive had to or we wouldnt be here now.Okay.I nodded, swallowing hard.Dinner and your place it is, then.I honestly cant wait.Gideons words about trust lingered in my mind all morning, which was a good thing when the Google alert digest hit my inbox.There was more than one photo this time around.Each article and blog post had several shots of me and Cary hugging good bye outside the restaurant where wed had lunch the day before.The captions speculated on the nature of our relationship and some noted that we lived together.Others suggested I was reeling in billionaire playboy Cross while keeping my up and coming model boyfriend on the side.The reason for the publicity became apparent when I saw the picture of Gideon mingled with the ones of me and Cary.It had been taken last night, while I was watching movies with Cary and Trey and while Gideon was supposedly at a business dinner.In the photo, Gideon and Magdalene Perez smiled intimately at each other, her hand on his forearm as they stood outside a restaurant.The captions ranged between kudos for Gideons bevy of beautiful socialites to speculation that he was hiding a broken heart over my infidelity by dating other women.You have to trust me.I closed my inbox, my breathing too quick and my heartbeat too fast.Jealous confusion twisted my gut.I knew he couldnt possibly have been physically intimate with another woman and I knew he cared for me.But I hated Magdalene with a passion certainly shed given me good reason to during our bathroom chat and I couldnt stand seeing her with Gideon.Couldnt stand seeing him smiling so fondly at her, especially after the way shed treated me.But I put it away.I shoved it into a box in my mind and I focused on my job.Mark was meeting with Gideon tomorrow to go over the RFP for the Kingsman campaign and I was organizing the information flowing between Mark and the contributing departments.Hey, Eva.Mark poked his head out of his office.Steve and I are meeting at Bryant Park Grill for lunch.He asked if youd come.Hed like to see you again.Id love to.My whole afternoon brightened at the thought of enjoying lunch at one of my favorite restaurants with two really charming guys.Theyd distract me from thinking about the conversation I was hours away from having with Gideon about my past.My privacy was clearly gone.I would have to grow a set of balls and talk to Gideon before we went out to dinner.Before he was seen in public with me any further.He needed to know the risk he was taking by being associated with me.When I received an interoffice envelope a short while later, I assumed it was a small mock up of one of the Kingsman ads, but found a note card from Gideon instead.Noon.My office.Really?I muttered, irritated by the lack of salutation and closing.Not to mention the lack of a request.And who could forget the fact that Gideon hadnt even mentioned running into Magdalene at dinner?Had he invited her as his date in my stead?Thats what she was there for, after all.To be one of the women he socialized with outside of his hotel room.I flipped Gideons card over and wrote the same number of words with no signature:  Sorry.Have plans.A bratty reply, but he deserved it.When a quarter to noon rolled around, Mark and I headed down to the ground floor.When I was stopped by security and the guard called up to Gideon to tell him I was in the lobby, my irritation kicked into a temper.Lets go, I said to Mark, striding toward the revolving door and ignoring the pleas of the security guard to wait a moment.I felt bad putting him in the middle.I saw Angus and the Bentley at the curb at the same moment I heard Gideon snap out my name like a whipcrack behind me.I faced him as he joined us on the sidewalk with his face impassive and his gaze icy.Im going to lunch with my boss, I told him, my chin lifting.Where are you headed, Garrity?Gideon asked without taking his eyes off me.Bryant Park Grill.Ill see that she gets there.With that, he took my arm and steered me firmly toward the Bentley and the rear door that Angus held open for me.Gideon crowded in behind me, forcing me to scramble across the seat.The door shut and we were off.I yanked the skirt of my sheath dress back into place.What are you doing?Besides embarrassing me in front of my boss!He draped one arm over the back of the seat and leaned toward me.Is Cary in love with you?What?No!Have you fucked him?Have you lost your mind?Mortified, I shot a glance at Angus and found him acting like he was deaf.Screw you, billionaire playboy with your bevy of beautiful socialites.So you did see the photos.I was so mad I was panting.The nerve.I turned my head away, dismissing him and his idiotic accusations.Carys like a brother to me.You know that.Ah, but what are you to him?The photos were amazingly clear, Eva.I know love when I see it.Angus slowed for a herd of pedestrians crossing the street.I shoved the door open and looked at Gideon over my shoulder, letting him take a good look at my face.Obviously, you dont.I slammed the door shut and set off briskly, righteous in my anger.Id fought back my own questions and jealousy with herculean effort, and what did I get for it?An irrationally pissed off Gideon.Eva.Stop right there.I flipped him the bird over my shoulder and raced up the short steps into Bryant Park, a lushly green and tranquil oasis in the midst of the city.Just crossing up and over from the sidewalk was like being transported to a completely different realm.Dwarfed by the towering skyscrapers surrounding it, Bryant Park was a garden land behind a beautiful old library.A place where time slowed, children laughed over the innocent joy of a carousel ride, and books were treasured companions.Unfortunately for me, the gorgeous ogre from one world chased me into the other.Gideon caught me by the waist.Dont run, he hissed in my ear.Youre acting like a nut job.Maybe because you drive me fucking crazy.His arms tightened into steel bands.Youre mine.Tell me Cary knows that.Right.Like Magdalene knows youre mine.I wished he had something near my mouth that I could bite.Youre causing a scene.We couldve done this in my office, if you werent so damned stubborn.I had plans, asshat.And youre fucking them up for me.My voice broke, tears welling as I felt the number of eyes on us.I was going to get fired for being an embarrassing spectacle.Youre fucking up everything.Gideon instantly released me, turning me to face him.His grip on my shoulders ensured I still couldnt get away.Christ.He crushed me against him, his lips in my hair.Dont cry.Im sorry.I beat my fist against his chest, which was as effectual as hitting a rock wall.Whats wrong with you?You can go out with a catty bitch who calls me a whore and thinks shes going to marry you, but I cant have lunch with a dear friend whos been pulling for you from the beginning?Eva.He cupped the back of my head with one hand and pressed his cheek to my temple.Maggie just happened to be at the same restaurant where I had dinner with my business associates.I dont care.You want to talk about a look on someones face.The look on yoursHow could you look at her like that after what she said to me?Angel His lips moved ardently over my face.That look was for you.Maggie caught me outside and I told her I was heading home to you.I cant help how I look when Im thinking about us being alone together.And you expect me to believe she smiled about that?She told me to tell you hello, but I figured that wouldnt go over well, and there was no way I was ruining our night over her.My arms slid around his waist beneath his jacket.We need to talk.Tonight, Gideon.There are things I have to tell you.If a reporter looks in the right place and gets luckyWe have to keep our relationship private or end it.Either would be better for you.Gideon cupped my face and pressed his forehead to mine.Neither is an option.Whatever it is, well figure it out.I pushed up onto my toes and pressed my mouth to his.Our tongues stroked and dipped, the kiss wildly passionate.I was vaguely aware of the multitude of people milling around us, the buzz of numerous conversations, and the steady rumble of the ceaseless midtown traffic, but none of it mattered while I was sheltered by Gideon.Cherished by him.He was both tormentor and pleasurer, a man whose mood swings and volatile passions rivaled my own.There, he whispered, running his fingertips down my cheek.Let that go viral.Youre not listening to me, you crazy stubborn man.I have to go.Well ride home together after work.He backed away, holding my hand until distance pulled our fingers apart.When I turned toward the ivy draped restaurant, I saw Mark and Steven waiting for me by the entrance.They made such a pair with Mark in his suit and tie, and Steven in his worn jeans and boots.Steven stood with his hands in his pockets and big grin on his attractive face.I feel like I should applaud.That was better than watching a chick flick.My face heated and I shifted on my feet.Mark opened the door and waved me inside.I think you can ignore my previous words of wisdom about Crosss womanizing.Thanks for not firing me, I replied wryly as we waited for the hostess to check our reservation and table.Or at least feeding me first.Steven patted my shoulder.Mark cant afford to lose you.Pulling out a chair for me, Mark smiled.How else will I give Steven regular updates on your love life?Hes a soap opera addict, you know.He loves romantic dramas.I snorted.Youre kidding.Steven ran a hand over his chin and smiled.Ill never admit it one way or the other.A mans got to have his secrets.My mouth curved, but I was painfully aware of my own hidden truths.And how quickly time was passing before Id have to reveal them.Five oclock found me steeling myself to divulge my secrets.I was tense and somber when Gideon and I slid into the Bentley, and my disquiet only worsened when I felt him studying the side of my averted face.When he took my hand and lifted it to his lips, I felt like crying.I was still trying to adjust after our argument in the park, and that was the least of what we had to deal with.We didnt speak until we arrived at his apartment.When we entered his home, he led me straight through his beautiful, expansive living room and down the hall to his bedroom.There, laid out on the bed, was a fabulous cocktail dress the color of Gideons eyes and a floor length black silk robe.I had a little time to shop before dinner yesterday, he explained.My apprehension lifted slightly, softened by pleasure at his thoughtfulness.Thank you.He set my bag on a chair by the dresser.Id like you to get comfortable.You can wear the robe or something of mine.Ill open a bottle of wine and well just settle in.When youre ready, well talk.Id like to take a quick shower.I wished we could separate what happened in the park from what I had to tell him so that each issue was dealt with on its own merits, but I didnt have a choice.Every day was another opportunity for someone else to tell Gideon what he needed to hear from me.Whatever you want, angel.Make yourself at home.As I kicked off my heels and moved into the bathroom, I felt the weight of his concern, but my revelations would have to hold until I could compose myself better.In an effort to gain that control, I took my time in the shower.Unfortunately, it made me remember the one wed taken together just that morning.Had that been both our first and last as a couple?When I was ready, I found Gideon standing by the couch in the living room.Hed changed into black silk pajama bottoms that hung low around his hips.Nothing else.A small blaze flickered in the fireplace and a bottle of wine sat in an ice filled bucket on the coffee table.A grouping of ivory candles had been clustered as a centerpiece, their golden glow the only illumination besides the fire.Excuse me, I said from the threshold of the room.Im looking for Gideon Cross, the man who doesnt have romance in his repertoire.He grinned sheepishly, a boyish smile so at odds with the mature sexuality of his bared body.I dont think about it that way.I just try to guess what might please you, and then I give it a shot and hope for the best.You please me.I crossed to him, the black robe swaying around my legs.I loved that hed put on something that matched what he had given me.I want to, he said soberly.Im working on it.Stopping in front of him, I drank in the beauty of his face and the sexy way the ends of his hair caressed the top of his shoulders.I ran my palms down his biceps, squeezing the hard muscle gently before stepping into him and pressing my face into his chest.Hey, he murmured, wrapping his arms around me.Is this about me being an ass at lunch?Or whatever it is you need to say to me?Talk to me, Eva, so I can tell you itll be okay.I nuzzled my nose between his pecs, feeling the tickle of crisp chest hair against my cheek and breathing in the reassuring, familiar scent of his skin.You should sit down.I have to tell you things about me.Ugly things.Gideon reluctantly let me go when I pulled away from him.I curled up on his couch with my legs tucked underneath me and he poured us both glasses of golden wine before taking a seat.Leaning toward me, he draped one arm over the back of the sofa and held his glass with the other hand, giving me every bit of his attention.Okay.Here goes.I took a deep breath before starting, feeling dizzy from the elevated rate of my pulse.I couldnt remember the last time Id been so nervous or sick to my stomach.My mother and father never married.I really dont know too much about how they met, because neither of them talks about it.I know my mom came from money.Not as much as she married into, but more than most people have.She was a debutante.Had the whole white dress and presentation thing.Getting pregnant with me was a mistake that got her disowned, but she kept me.I looked down into my glass.I really admire her for that.There was a lot of pressure for her to make the baby make me go away, but she went through with the pregnancy anyway.Obviously.His fingers sifted through my shower damp hair.Lucky me.I caught his fingers and kissed his knuckles, then held his hand in my lap.Even with a kid in tow, she was able to land herself a millionaire.He was a widower with a son just two years older than me, so I think they both thought theyd found the perfect arrangement.He traveled a lot and was rarely home, and my mom spent his money and took over raising his son.I understand the need for money, Eva, he murmured.I have to have it, too.I need the power of it.The security.Our eyes met.Something passed between us with that small admission.It made it easier for me to say what came next.I was ten the first time my stepbrother raped me   The stem of his glass snapped in his hand.He moved so swiftly he was a blur, catching the bowl of his goblet against his thigh before it spilled its contents.I scrambled to my feet when he rose to his.Did you cut yourself?Are you okay?Im fine, he bit out.He went into the kitchen and threw the broken glass away, shattering it further.I set my own glass down carefully, my hands shaking.I heard cupboards opening and closing.A few minutes later Gideon returned with a tumbler of something darker in his hand.Sit down, Eva.I stared at him.His frame was rigid, his eyes icy cold.He scrubbed a hand over his face and said more gently, Sit downplease.My weakened knees gave out and I sat on the edge of the sofa, pulling the robe tighter around me.Gideon remained standing, taking a large swallow of whatever was in his hand.You said the first time.How many times were there?I took conscious breaths, trying to calm myself.I dont know.I lost count.Did you tell anyone?Did you tell your mother?No.My God, if shed known, she wouldve gotten me out of there.But Nathan made sure I was too afraid to tell her.I tried to swallow past a tight, dry throat and winced at the painful sandpapery burn.When my voice came again, it was barely a whisper.There was a time when it got so bad I almost told her anyway, but he knew.Nathan could tell I was close.So he broke my cats neck and left her on my bed.Jesus Christ.His chest was heaving.He wasnt just fucked up, he was insane.And he was touching youEva.The servants had to know, I went on numbly, staring at my twisted hands.I just wanted to get it over with, to get it all out so I could put it back into the box in my mind where I forgot about it in my day to day life.The fact that they didnt say anything either told me they were scared, too.They were grownups and they didnt say a word.I was a child.What could I do if they wouldnt do anything?How did you get out?he asked hoarsely.When did it end?When I was fourteen.I thought I was having my period, but there was too much blood.My mother panicked and took me to the emergency room.Id had a miscarriage.In the course of the exam they found evidence ofother trauma.Vaginal and anal scarring   Gideon set his glass down on the end table with a harsh thud.Im sorry, I whispered, feeling like I might be sick.Id spare you the details, but you need to know what someone might dig up.The hospital reported the abuse to child services.Its all a matter of public record, which has been sealed, but there are people who know the story.When my mom married Stanton, he went back and tightened those seals, paid out in return for nondisclosure agreementsstuff like that.But you have a right to know that this could come out and embarrass you.Embarrass me?he snapped, vibrating with rage.Embarrassment isnt on the list of what Id feel.Gideon   I would destroy the career of any reporter who wrote about this, and then Id dismantle the publication that ran the piece.He was so cold with fury, he was icy.Im going to find the monster who hurt you, Eva, wherever he is, and Im going to make him wish he was dead.A shiver moved through me, because I believed him.It was in his face.His voice.In the energy he exuded and his sharply honed focus.He wasnt just dark and dangerous in his looks.Gideon was a man who got what he wanted, whatever it took.I pushed to my feet.Hes not worth the effort.Not worth your time.You are.Youre worth it.Damn it.Goddamn it to hell.I moved closer to the fireplace, needing the warmth.Theres also a money trail.Cops and reporters always follow the money.Someone may wonder why my mother left her first marriage with two million dollars, but her daughter from a previous relationship left with five.Without looking, I felt his sudden stillness.Of course, I went on, that blood moneys probably grown to considerably more than that now.I wont touch it, but Stanton manages the brokerage account I dumped it in and everyone knows he has the Midas touch.If you ever had any concern that I wanted your money   Stop talking.I turned to face him.I saw his face, his eyes.Saw the pity and horror.But it was what I didnt see that hurt the most.It was my greatest nightmare realized.Id feared that my past might negatively impact his attraction to me.Id told Cary that Gideon might stay with me for all the wrong reasons.That he might stay by my side, but that Id still for all intents and purposes lose him anyway.And it seemed I had.13  I tightened the belt on my robe.Im going to get dressed and go.What?Gideon glared.Go where?Home, I said, weary to the bone.I think you need to digest all this.His arms crossed.We can do that together.I dont think we can.My chin lifted, grief overwhelming my shame and heartrending disappointment.Not while youre looking at me like you feel sorry for me.Im not made of fucking stone, Eva.I wouldnt be human if I didnt care.The emotions Id run through since lunch coalesced into a searing pain in my chest and a cleansing burst of anger.I dont want your goddamn pity.He shoved both hands through his hair.What the hell do you want, then?You!I want you.You have me.How many times do I have to tell you that?Your words dont mean shit when you cant back them up.From the moment we met, youve been hot for me.You havent been able to look at me without making it damn clear you want to fuck my brains out.And thats gone, Gideon.My eyes burned.That lookits gone.You cant be serious.He stared at me as if Id grown two heads.I dont think you know how your desire makes me feel.My arms wrapped around me, covering my breasts.I suddenly felt naked in the worst way.It makes me feel beautiful.It makes me feel strong and alive.I I cant bear to be with you if you dont feel that way about me anymore.Eva, I His voice faded into silence.He was hard faced and distant, his fists clenched at his sides.I loosened the sash of my robe and shrugged the whole garment off me.Look at me, Gideon.Look at my body.Its the same one you couldnt get enough of last night.The same one you were so desperate to get into that you took me to that damn hotel room.If you dont want this anymoreif you dont get hard looking at it   Is this hard enough for you?He broke the drawstring of his pants pushing them down to expose the heavy, thickly veined length of his erection.We both lunged at the same time, colliding.Our mouths slid over each other as he lifted me to wrap my legs around his hips.He stumbled to the couch and fell, catching our combined weight with one outstretched hand.I sprawled beneath him, breathless and sobbing, while he slid to his knees on the floor and tongued my cleft.He was rough and impatient, lacking the finesse Id become used to, and I loved that he was.Loved it more when he levered over me and shoved his cock into me.I wasnt yet fully wet and the burn made me gasp, then his thumb was on my clit, rubbing in circles that had my hips churning.Yes, I moaned, raking my nails down his back.He wasnt icy anymore.He was on fire.Fuck me, Gideon.Fuck me hard.Eva.His mouth covered mine.He fisted my hair, holding me still as he lunged again and again, pounding hard and deep.He kicked off the armrest with one foot, powering into me, driving toward his orgasm with single minded ferocity.Mineminemine  The rhythmic slap of his heavy balls against the curve of my buttocks and the harshness of his possessive litany drove me insane with lust.I felt myself quickening with every twinge of pain, felt my sex tightening with my growing arousal.With a long, guttural groan he started coming, his flexing body quaking as he emptied himself inside me.I held him as he climaxed, stroking his back, pressing kisses along his shoulder.Hold on, he said roughly, pushing his hands beneath me and flattening my breasts against him.Gideon pulled me up, and then sat down with me straddling his hips.I was slick from his orgasm, making it easy for him to push back inside me.His hands brushed the hair away from my face; then wiped my tears of relief.Im always hard for you, always hot for you.Im always half crazy with wanting you.If anything could change that, I wouldve done it before we got this far.Understand?My hands wrapped around his wrists.Yes.Now, show me that you still want me after that.His face was flushed and damp, his eyes dark and turbulent.I need to know that losing control doesnt mean Ive lost you.I pulled his palms from my face and urged them down to my breasts.When he cupped them, I splayed my hands on his shoulders and rocked my hips.He was semi hard, yet quickly thickened as I began to undulate.His fingers on my nipples, rolling and tugging, sent waves of pleasure through me, the gentle stimulation arrowing to my core.When he urged me closer and took a hardened tip in his mouth I cried out, my body igniting with need for more.Clenching my thighs, I lifted.I closed my eyes to focus on the way he felt as he slid out; then bit my lip at the way he stretched me sliding back in.Thats it, he murmured, licking across my chest to my other nipple, fluttering his tongue over the tight, aching tip.Come for me.I need you to come riding my cock.Rolling my hips, I relished the exquisite feel of him filling me so perfectly.I had no shame, no regrets as I worked myself into a frenzy on his stiff penis, adjusting the angle so that the thick crown rubbed right where I needed it.Gideon, I breathed.Oh, yesoh please  Youre so beautiful.He gripped the back of my neck in one hand and my waist in the other, arching his hips to push a little deeper.So sexy.Im going to come for you again.Thats what you do to me, Eva.Its never enough.I whimpered as everything tightened, as the sweet tension built from the deep rhythmic strokes.I was panting and frantic, pumping my hips.Reaching between my legs, I rubbed my clit with the pads of my fingers, hastening my climax.He gasped, his head thrown back into the sofa cushion, his neck corded with strain.I feel you getting ready to come.Your cunt gets so hot and tight, so greedy.His words and his voice pushed me over.I cried out when the first hard tremor hit me; then again as the orgasm rippled through my body, my sex spasming around Gideons steely erection.Teeth grinding audibly, he held on until the clenches began to fade; then he clutched my hips aloft and pumped upward into me.Once, twice.On the third deep thrust, he growled my name and spurted hotly, laying the last of my fears and doubts to rest.I dont know how long we sprawled on the couch like that, connected and close, my head on his shoulder and his hands caressing the curve of my spine.Gideon pressed his lips to my temple and murmured, Stay.Yes.He hugged me.Youre so brave, Eva.So strong and honest.Youre a miracle.My miracle.A miracle of modern therapy, maybe, I scoffed, my fingers playing in his luxuriant hair.And even with that, I was really fucked up for a while and there are still some triggers I dont think Ill ever get past.God.The way I came on to you in the beginningI couldve ruined us before we even got started.And the advocacy dinner  He shuddered and buried his face in my neck.Eva, dont let me blow this.Dont let me chase you away.Lifting my head, I searched his face.He was impossibly gorgeous.I had trouble taking it in at times.You cant second guess everything you do or say to me because of Nathan and what he did.Itll break us apart.Itll end us.Dont say that.Dont even think about it.I smoothed his knit brow with strokes of my thumb.I wish I couldve never told you.I wish you didnt have to know.He caught my hand and pressed my fingertips to his lips.I have to know everything, every part of you, inside and out, every detail.A woman has to have some secrets, I teased.You wont have any with me.He captured me by my hair and an arm banded around my hips, urging me against him, reminding me as if I could forget that he was still inside me.Im going to possess you, Eva.Its only fair since youve possessed me.And what about your secrets, Gideon?His face smoothed into an emotionless mask, an act so easily accomplished I knew it had become second nature to him.I started from scratch when I met you.Everything I thought I was, everything I thought I needed He shook his head.Were figuring out who I am together.Youre the only one who knows me.But I didnt.Not really.I was figuring him out, learning him bit by bit, but he was still a mystery to me in so many ways.EvaIf you just tell me what you want  His throat worked on a swallow.I can get better at this, if you give me the chance.Just dontdont give up on me.Jesus.He could shred me so easily.A few words, a desperate look, and I was cut wide open.I touched his face, his hair, his shoulders.He was as broken as I was, in a way I didnt yet know about.I need something from you, Gideon.Anything.Just tell me what it is.Every day, I need you to tell me something I dont know about you.Something insightful, no matter how small.I need you to promise me that you will.Gideon eyed me warily.Whatever I want?I nodded, unsure of myself and what I hoped to get out of him.He exhaled harshly.Okay.I kissed him softly, a silent show of thanks.Nuzzling his nose against mine, he asked, Lets go out to dinner.Or do you want to order in?Are you sure we should go out?I want to go on a date with you.There was no way I could say no to that, not when I knew what a big step it was for him.A big step for both of us, really, since the last time wed gone on a date itd ended in disaster.Sounds romantic.And irresistible.His joyful smile was my reward, as was the shower we took to clean up.I loved the intimacy of washing his body as much as I loved the feel of his palms gliding over me.When I took his hand and put it between my legs, urging two of his fingers inside me, I saw the familiar and very welcome heat in his eyes as he felt the slick essence hed left behind.He kissed me and murmured, Mine.Which prompted me to slide both hands over his cock and whisper the same claim back to him.In the bedroom, I lifted my new blue dress off the bed and hugged it to me.You picked this out, Gideon?I did, yes.Do you like it?Its beautiful.I smiled.My mother said you had excellent tasteexcept for your preference for brunettes.He glanced at me just before his very fine, very firm naked ass disappeared into his massive walk in closet.What brunettes?Ooh, nicely done.Look in the top drawer on the right, he called out.Was he trying to distract me from thinking about all the brunettes hed been photographed with including Magdalene?I left the dress on the bed and opened the drawer.Inside were a dozen Carine Gilson lingerie sets, all in my size, in a wide range of colors.There were also garters and silk stockings still in their packages.I looked up at Gideon as he reappeared with his clothes in hand.I have a drawer?You have three in the dresser and two in the bathroom.Gideon.I smiled.Working up to a drawer usually takes a few months.How would you know?He laid his clothes on the bed.Youve lived with a man other than Cary?I shot him a look.Having a drawer isnt living with someone.Thats not an answer.He walked over and brushed me gently aside to grab a pair of boxer briefs.Sensing his withdrawal and darkening mood, I replied before he moved away.I havent lived with any other men, no.Leaning over, Gideon pressed a brusque kiss to my forehead before returning to the bed.He paused at the footboard with his back to me.I want this relationship to mean more to you than any others youve had.It does.By far.I tightened the knot of the towel between my breasts.Im struggling with that a little.Its become important so quickly.Maybe too quickly.I keep thinking its too good to be true.Turning, he faced me.Maybe it is.If so, we deserve it.I went to him and let him pull me into his arms.It was where I wanted to be more than anywhere else.He pressed a kiss to the crown of my head.I cant stand the thought that youre waiting for this to end.Thats what youre doing, isnt it?Thats what you sound like.Im sorry.We just have to make you feel secure.He ran his fingers through my hair.How do we do that?I hesitated a moment, then went for it.Would you go to couples therapy with me?The stroking of his fingers paused.He stood silently for a moment, breathing deeply.Just think about it, I suggested.Maybe look into it, see what its about.Am I doing this wrong?You and me?Am I fucking it up that much?I pulled back to look at him.No, Gideon.Youre perfect.Perfect for me, anyway.Im crazy about you.I think youre   He kissed me.Ill do it.Ill go.I loved him in that moment.Wildly.And the moment after that.And all through the ride to what turned out to be a dazzling, intimate dinner at Masa.We were one of only three parties in the restaurant and Gideon was greeted by name on sight.The food we were served was otherworldly good and the wine too expensive to think about or I wouldnt have been able to swallow it.Gideon was darkly charismatic; his charm was relaxed and seductive.I felt beautiful in the dress hed chosen and my mood was light.He knew the worst of what there was to know about me, but he was still with me.His fingertips caressed my shoulderdrew circles on my napeslid down my back.He kissed my temple and nuzzled beneath my ear, his tongue lightly touching the sensitive skin.Beneath the table, his hand squeezed my thigh and cupped the back of my knee.My entire body vibrated with awareness of him.I wanted him so badly I ached.How did you meet Cary?he asked, eyeing me over the lip of his wineglass.Group therapy.I set my hand over his to still its upward slide on my leg, smiling at the mischievous glimmer in his eyes.My dads a cop and hed heard of this therapist who supposedly had mad skills with wild kids, which I was.Cary was seeing Dr.Travis, too.Mad skills, huh?Gideon smiled.Dr.Travis isnt like any other therapist Ive ever met.His office is an old gymnasium he converted.He had an open door policy with his kids and hanging out there was more real to me than lying on a couch.Plus he had a no bullshit rule.It was straight up honesty both ways or hed get pissed.Ive always liked that about him, that he cared enough to get emotional.Did you choose SDSU because your dads in Southern California?My mouth twisted wryly as he revealed another bit of knowledge about me that I hadnt given him.How much have you dug up on me?Whatever I could find.Do I want to know how extensive that is?He lifted my hand to his lips and kissed the back.Probably not.I shook my head, exasperated.Yes, thats why I attended SDSU.I didnt get to spend a lot of time with my dad while I was growing up.Plus my mother was smothering me to death.And you never told your dad about what happened to you?No.I rolled the stem of my wineglass between my fingers.He knows I was an angry troublemaker with self esteem issues, but he doesnt know about Nathan.Why not?Because he cant change what happened.Nathan was lawfully punished.His father paid a large sum for damages.Justice was served.Gideon spoke coolly.I disagree.What more can you expect?He drank deeply before replying.Its not fit to describe over dinner.Oh.Because that sounded ominous, especially when paired with the ice of his gaze, I returned my attention to the food in front of me.There was no menu at Masa, only omakase, so every bite was a surprise delight, and the dearth of patrons made it seem almost as if we had the whole place to ourselves.After a moment, he said, I love watching you eat.I shot him a look.Whats that supposed to mean?You eat with gusto.And your little moans of pleasure make me hard.I bumped my shoulder into his.By your own admission, youre always hard.Your fault, he said, grinning, which made me grin, too.Gideon ate with more deliberation than I did and didnt bat an eye at the astronomical check.Before we stepped outside, he slid his jacket over my shoulders and said, Lets go to your gym tomorrow.I glanced at him.Yours is nicer.Of course it is.But Ill go wherever you like.Someplace without helpful trainers named Daniel?I asked sweetly.He looked at me with an arched brow and a wry curving of his lips.Watch yourself, angel.Before I think of a suitable consequence for mocking my possessiveness where youre concerned.I noted he didnt threaten me with a spanking again.Did he understand that administered pain with sex was a major trigger for me?It took me back to a mental place I never wanted to return to.On the ride back to Gideons place, I curled into him in the back of the Bentley, my legs slung over one of his thighs and my head on his shoulder.I thought about the ways Nathans abuse still affected my life my sex life in particular.How many of those ghosts could Gideon and I exorcise together?After that brief glimpse of toys Id seen in the hotel room drawer, it was clear he was more experienced and sexually adventurous than I was.And the pleasure Id derived from the ferocity of his lovemaking on the couch earlier proved to me that he could do things to me no one else could.I trust you, I whispered.His arms tightened around me.With his lips in my hair, he murmured, Were going to be good for each other, Eva.When I fell asleep in his arms later that night, it was with those words in my head.DontNo.No, dont Please.Gideons cries had me jackknifing up in the bed, my heart thudding violently.I fought for breath, glancing wild eyed at the man thrashing next to me.He snarled like a feral beast, his hands fisted and his legs kicking restlessly.I moved back, afraid hed strike out at me unknowingly in his dreams.Get off of me, he panted.Gideon!Wake up.Getoff His hips arched upward with a hiss of pain.He hovered there, teeth gritted, his back bowed as if the bed was on fire beneath him.Then he collapsed, the mattress jolting as he bounced off of it.Gideon.I reached for the bedside lamp, my throat burning.I couldnt reach it, had to throw the tangled blankets off to get closer.Gideon was writhing in agony, thrashing so violently he shook the bed.The room lit up in a sudden flare of illumination.I turned toward him  And found him masturbating with shocking viciousness.His right hand gripped his cock with white knuckled force, pumping brutally fast.His left hand clenched the fitted sheet.Torment and pain twisted his beautiful face.Fearing for his safety, I shoved his shoulder with both hands.Gideon, goddamn it.Wake up!My scream broke through the nightmare.His eyes flew open and he jerked upright, his eyes darting frantically.What?he gasped, his chest heaving.His face was flushed, his lips and cheeks red with arousal.What is it?Jesus.I shoved my hands through my hair and slid out of bed, snatching up the black robe Id hung over the footboard.What was in his mind?What could make someone have such violently sexual dreams?My voice shook.You were having a nightmare.You scared the hell out of me.Eva.He looked down at his erection and his color darkened with shame.I stared at him from my safe place by the window, tying the sash of my robe with a yank.What were you dreaming about?He shook his head, his gaze lowered with humiliation, a vulnerable posture I didnt know or recognize in him.It was as if someone else had taken over Gideons body.I dont know.Bullshit.Somethings in you, somethings eating at you.What is it?He rallied visibly as his brain struggled free of sleep.It was just a dream, Eva.People have them.I stared at him, hurt blooming that he would take that tone with me, as if I was being irrational.Screw you.His shoulders squared, and he tugged the sheet over his lap.Why are you mad?Because youre lying.His chest expanded on a deep breath; then he released it in a rush.Im sorry I woke you.I pinched the bridge of my nose, feeling a headache gathering strength.My eyes stung with the need to cry for him, to cry for whatever torment hed once lived through.And to cry for us, because if he didnt let me in, our relationship had nowhere to go.One more time, Gideon: what were you dreaming about?I dont remember.He ran a hand through his hair and slid his legs off the edge of the bed.I have some business on my mind and its probably keeping me up.Im going to work in my home office for a while.Come back to bed, and try to get some sleep.There were a few right answers to that question, Gideon.Lets talk about it tomorrow wouldve been one.Lets talk about it over the weekend wouldve been another.And even Im not ready to talk about it would be okay.But you have some nerve acting like you dont know what Im talking about while speaking to me like Im unreasonable.Angel   Dont.My arms wrapped around my waist.Do you think it was easy telling you about my past?Do you think it was painless cutting myself open and letting the ugliness spill out?It wouldve been simpler to cut you off and date someone less prominent.I took the risk because I want to be with you.Maybe someday youll feel the same way about me.I left the room.Eva!Eva, damn it, come back here.Whats wrong with you?I walked faster.I knew how he felt: the sickness in the gut that spread like cancer, the helpless anger, and the need to curl up in private and find the strength to shove the memories back into the deep dark hole they still lived in.It wasnt an excuse for lying or deflecting the blame onto me.I snatched my purse off the chair where Id dropped it on the way in from dinner and I rushed out the front door into the foyer to the elevator.The car doors were closing with me inside when I saw him step into the living room through the open front door.His nakedness ensured he couldnt come after me, while the look in his eyes ensured I wouldnt stay.Hed donned his mask again, that striking implacable face that kept the world a safe distance away.Shaking, I leaned heavily against the brass handrail for support.I was torn between my concern for him, which urged me to stay, and my hard won knowledge, which assured me that his coping strategy wasnt one I could live with.The road to recovery for me was paved with hard truths, not denials and lies.Swiping at my wet cheeks when I passed the third floor, I took deep breaths and collected myself before the doors opened on the lobby level.The doorman whistled down a passing cab for me and was such a consummate professional that he acted like I was dressed for work rather than sporting bare feet and a black dressing gown.I thanked him sincerely.And I was so grateful to the cabbie for getting me home quickly that I tipped him well and didnt care about the furtive looks I got from my own doorman and the front desk staffer.I didnt even care about the look I got from the stunning, statuesque blonde who stepped out of the elevator I was waiting for, until I smelled Carys cologne on her and realized the T shirt she was wearing was one of his.She took in my half dressed state with an amused glance.Nice robe.Nice shirt.The blonde took off with a smirk.When I reached my floor, I found Cary lounging in the open doorway in a robe of his own.He straightened and opened his arms to me.Come here, baby girl.I walked straight into him and hugged him tight, smelling a womans perfume and hard sex all over him.Whos the chick that just left?Another model.Dont worry about her.He drew me into the apartment, and shut and locked the door.Cross called.He said you were heading back and he has your keys.He wanted to be sure I was here and awake to let you in.For what its worth, he sounded torn up and anxious.You wanna talk about it?Setting my purse down on the breakfast bar, I went into the kitchen.He had another nightmare.A really bad one.When I asked him about it he denied, he lied, then he acted like I was nuts.Ah, the classics.The phone started ringing.I flicked the switch on the base that turned the ringer off and Cary did the same to the handset hed left on the counter.Then I pulled out my smartphone, closed the alert that said Id missed numerous calls from Gideon, and sent him a text message; Home safe.Hope you sleep well the rest of the night.I powered the phone off and tossed it back in my purse; then I grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge.The kicker is that I told him all my junk earlier tonight.Carys brows shot up.So you did it.Howd he take it?Better than I had any right to expect.Nathan ought to hope they never run into each other.I finished the bottle.And Gideon agreed to the couples counseling you suggested.I thought wed turned a corner.Maybe we did, but we hit a brick wall anyway.You seem okay, though.He leaned into the breakfast bar.No tears.Really calm.Should I be worried?I rubbed my belly to ease the fear that had rooted there.No, Ill be all right.I justI want it to work out between us.I want to be with him, but lying about serious issues is a deal breaker for me.God.I couldnt let myself even consider that we might not get past this.I was already feeling antsy.The need to be with Gideon was a frantic beat in my blood.Youre a tough cookie, baby girl.Im proud of you.He came to me, linked our arms, and turned off the kitchen lights.Lets crash and start a new day when we wake up.I thought things were going well with you and Trey.His grin was glorious.Honey, I think Im in love.With who?I leaned my cheek against his shoulder.Trey or the blonde?Trey, silly.The blonde just provided a workout.I had a lot to say about that, but it wasnt the time to get into Carys history of sabotaging his own happiness.And maybe focusing on how good things were with Trey was the best way to handle this instance of it.So youve finally fallen for a good guy.We should celebrate.Hey, thats my line.14  The next morning dawned with an odd surreality.I made it to work, and then through most of my prelunch day in a kind of chilly fog.I couldnt get warm enough, despite wearing a cardigan over my blouse and a scarf that didnt match either one.It took me a few minutes longer to process requests than it should have, and I couldnt shake a feeling of dread.Gideon made no contact with me whatsoever.Nothing on my smartphone or e mail after my text last night.Nothing in my e mail inbox.No interoffice note.The silence was excruciating.Especially when the days Google alert hit my inbox and I saw the photos and phone videos of me and Gideon in Bryant Park.Seeing how we looked together the passion and need, the painful longing on our faces, and the gratefulness of reconciliation was bittersweet.Pain twisted in my chest.Gideon.If we couldnt work this out, would I ever stop thinking about him and wishing we had?I struggled to pull myself together.Mark was meeting with Gideon today.Maybe thats why Gideon hadnt felt pressed to contact me.Or maybe he was just really busy.I knew he had to be, considering his business calendar.And as far as I knew, we still had plans to go to the gym after work.I exhaled in a rush and told myself that things would straighten out somehow.They just had to.It was quarter to noon when my desk phone rang.Seeing from the readout that the call was coming from reception, I sighed with disappointment and answered.Hey, Eva, Megumi said cheerily.You have a Magdalene Perez here to see you.Do I?I stared at my monitor, confused and irritated.Had the Bryant Park photos lured Magdalene out from under whatever troll bridge she called home?Regardless of the reason, I had no interest in talking to her.Keep her up there for me, will you?I have to take care of something first.Sure.Ill tell her to have a seat.I hung up, then pulled out my smartphone and scrolled through the contact list until I found the number to Gideons office.I dialed and was relieved when Scott answered.Hey, Scott.Its Eva Tramell.Hi, Eva.Would you like to speak to Mr.Cross?Hes in a meeting at the moment, but I can buzz him.No.No, dont bother him.Its a standing order.He wont mind.It soothed me immensely to hear that.I hate to throw this in your lap, but I have a request for you.Anything you need.Thats also a standing order.The amusement in his voice relaxed me further.Magdalene Perez is down here on the twentieth floor.Frankly, the only thing she and I have in common is Gideon, and thats not a good thing.If she has something to say, its your boss she should be talking to.Could you please have someone escort her up?Absolutely.Ill take care of it now.Thanks, Scott.I appreciate you.Its my pleasure, Eva.I hung up the phone and sagged back in my seat, feeling better already and proud of myself for not letting jealousy get the better of me.While I still really hated the idea of her having any of Gideons time, I hadnt lied when Id said I trusted him.I believed he had strong, deep feelings for me.I just didnt know if they were enough to override his survival instinct.Megumi called me again.Oh my God, she said, laughing.You shouldve seen her face when whoever that was came to get her.Good.I grinned.I figured she was up to no good.Is she gone, then?Yep.Thanks.I crossed the narrow strip of hallway to Marks door and poked my head in to see if he wanted me to pick him up some lunch.He frowned, thinking about it.
