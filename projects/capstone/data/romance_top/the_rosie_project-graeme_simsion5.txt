Gene sent you to me as a candidate for the Wife Project.A wild card.He did what?You havent heard of the Wife Project?I asked, trying to establish the correct starting point.No, she said, speaking in the tone that is traditionally used for giving instructions to a child.I have never heard of the Wife Project.But Im about to.In detail.Of course, I said.But we should time share it with pizza consumption and beer drinking.Of course, said Rosie.I explained in some detail about the Wife Project, including the review with Gene and field visits to dating establishments.I finished as we consumed the final slices of pizza.Rosie had not really asked any questions except to make exclamations such as Jesus and Fuck.So, said Rosie, are you still doing it?The Wife Project?I explained that the project was still technically active, but in the absence of any qualified candidates there had been no progress.What a shame, said Rosie.The perfect woman hasnt checked in yet.I would assume that there is more than one candidate who meets the criteria, I said, but its like finding a bone marrow donor.Not enough registrations.I can only hope that enough women realize their civic duty and take the test.It was an interesting comment.I didnt really feel it was a duty.In the last few weeks, reflecting on the Wife Project and its lack of success, I had felt sad that there were so many women who were looking for partners and desperate enough to register, even though there was only a low probability that they would meet the criteria.Its entirely optional, I said.How nice for them.Heres a thought for you.Any woman who takes that test is willing to be treated as an object.You can say thats their choice.But if you spent two minutes looking at how much society forces women to think of themselves as objects, you might not think so.What I want to know is, do you want a woman who thinks like that?Is that the sort of wife you want?Rosie was sounding angry.You know why I dress the way I do?Why these glasses?Because I dont want to be treated as an object.If you knew how insulted I am that you think I was an applicant, a candidate  Then why did you come to see me that day?I asked.The day of the Jacket Incident?She shook her head.Remember at your apartment, on your balcony, I asked you a question about the size of testicles?I nodded.It didnt strike you as odd that here I was, on a first date, asking about testicles?Not really.On a date Im too focused on not saying odd things myself.Okay, strike that.She seemed a little calmer.The reason I asked the question was that I had a bet with Gene.Gene, who is a sexist pig, bet me that humans were naturally nonmonogamous, and that the evidence was the size of their testicles.He sent me to a genetics expert to settle the bet.It took me a few moments to process fully the implications of what Rosie was saying.Gene had not prepared her for the dinner invitation.A womanRosiehad accepted an offer of a date with me without being prewarned, set up.I was suffused with an irrationally disproportionate sense of satisfaction.But Gene had misled me.And it seemed he had taken advantage of Rosie financially.Did you lose much money?I asked.It seems exploitative for a professor of psychology to make a bet with a barmaid.Im not a fucking barmaid.I could tell by the use of the obscenity that Rosie was getting angry again.But she could hardly contradict the evidence.I realized my errorone that would have caused trouble if I had made it in front of a class.Barperson.Bartender is the established nonsexist term, she said.Thats not the point.Its my part time job.Im doing my PhD in psychology, okay?In Genes department.Does that make sense now?Of course!I suddenly remembered where I had seen her beforearguing with Gene after his public lecture.I recalled that Gene had asked her to have coffee with himas he habitually did with attractive womenbut that she had refused.For some reason I felt pleased about this.But if I had recognized her when she first came to my office, the whole misunderstanding could have been avoided.Everything now made sense, including the performance she had given in her medical school inquiry.Except for two things.Why didnt you tell me?Because I am a barmaid, and Im not ashamed of it.You can take me or leave me as a barmaid.I assumed she was speaking metaphorically.Excellent, I said.That explains almost everything.Oh, thats fine, then.Why the almost?Dont feel you have to leave anything hanging.Why Gene didnt tell me.Because hes an asshole.Gene is my best friend.God help you, she said.With matters clarified, it was time to finish the project, although our chances of finding the father tonight were looking poor.Fourteen candidates remained and we had only three samples left.I got up and walked to the machine.Listen, said Rosie.Im going to ask you again.Why are you doing this?I remembered my reflection on this question and the answer I had reached involving scientific challenge and altruism to adjacent humans.But as I began my explanation, I realized that it was not true.Tonight we had corrected numerous invalid assumptions and errors in communication.I should not create a new one.I dont know, I said.I turned back to the machine and began to load the sample.My work was interrupted by a sudden smashing of glass.Rosie had thrown a beaker, fortunately not one containing an untested sample, against the wall.I am so so over this.She walked out.The next morning there was a knock at my office door.Rosie.Enter, I said.I assume you want to know the final three results.Rosie walked unnaturally slowly to my desk, where I was reviewing some potentially life changing data.No, she said.I figured they were negative.Even you would have phoned if youd gotten a match.Correct.She stood and looked at me without saying anything.I am aware that such silences are provided as opportunities for me to speak further, but I could think of nothing useful to say.Finally, she filled the gap.Heysorry I blew up last night.Totally understandable.Its incredibly frustrating to work so hard for no result.But very common in science.I remembered that she was a science graduate, as well as a barmaid.As you know.I meant your Wife Project.I think its wrong, but youre no different from every other man I know in objectifying womenjust more honest about it.Anyway, youve done so much for me  A communication error.Fortunately now rectified.We can proceed with the Father Project without the personal aspect.Not till I understand why youre doing it.That difficult question again.But she had been happy to proceed when she thought that my motivation was romantic interest even though she did not reciprocate that interest.There has been no change in my motivation, I said, truthfully.It was your motivation that was a concern.I thought you were interested in me as a partner.Fortunately, that assumption was based on false information.Shouldnt you be spending the time on your objectification project?The question was perfectly timed.The data I was looking at on my screen indicated a major breakthrough.Good news.I have an applicant who satisfies all requirements.Well, said Rosie, you wont be needing me.This was a truly strange response.I hadnt needed Rosie for anything other than her own project.sixteen   The candidates name was Bianca Rivera and she met all criteria.There was one obstacle, which I would need to devote time to.She noted that she had twice won the state ballroom dancing championship, and she required her partner to be an accomplished dancer.It seemed perfectly reasonable for her to have some criteria of her own, and this one was easy to satisfy.And I had the perfect place to take her.I called Regina, the Deans assistant, and confirmed that she was still selling tickets for the faculty ball.Then I emailed Bianca and invited her as my partner.She accepted!I had a datethe perfect date.Now I had ten days to learn to dance.Gene entered my office as I was practicing my dance steps.I think the longevity statistics were based on marriages to live women, Don.He was referring to the skeleton I was using for practice.I had obtained it on loan from the Anatomy Department, and no one had asked what I required it for.Judging from the pelvis size, it was almost certainly a male skeleton, but this was irrelevant for dancing practice.I explained its purpose to Gene, pointing out the scene from the film Grease that was showing on the wall of my office.So, said Gene, Ms.Rightsorry, Dr.Right, PhD, just popped into your inbox.Her names not Wright, I said, its Rivera.Photo?Not necessary.The meeting arrangements are quite precise.Shes coming to the faculty ball.Oh shit.Gene went silent for a while and I resumed dancing practice.Don, the faculty ball is a week from Friday.Correct.You cant learn to dance in nine days.Ten.I started yesterday.The steps are trivial to remember.I just need to practice the mechanics.Theyre considerably less demanding than martial arts.I demonstrated a sequence.Very impressive, said Gene.Sit down, Don.I sat.I hope youre not too pissed off at me about Rosie, he said.I had almost forgotten.Why didnt you tell me she was a psychology student?And about the bet?From what Claudia said, you guys seemed to be having a good time.I thought if she wasnt telling you, it was for a reason.She may be a bit twisted but shes not stupid.Perfectly reasonable, I said.On matters of human interaction, why argue with a professor of psychology?Im glad one of you is all right with it, said Gene.I have to tell you, Rosie was a little unhappy with me.A little unhappy with life.Listen, Don, I persuaded her to go to the ball.Alone.If you knew how often Rosie takes my advice, youd realize what a big deal that was.I was going to suggest you do the same.Take your advice?No, go to the ballalone.Or invite Rosie as your partner.I now saw what Gene was suggesting.Gene is so focused on attraction and sex that he sees it everywhere.This time he was totally in error.Rosie and I discussed the question of a relationship explicitly.Neither of us is interested.Since when do women discuss anything explicitly?said Gene.I visited Claudia for some advice on my crucial date with Bianca.I assumed that she would be there in her role as Genes wife, and I advised her that I might require assistance on the night.It turned out she wasnt even aware of the ball.Just be yourself, Don.If she doesnt want you for yourself, then shes not the right person for you.I think its unlikely that any woman would accept me for myself.What about Daphne?asked Claudia.It was true: Daphne was unlike the women I had dated.This was excellent therapyrefutation by counterexample.Perhaps Bianca would be a younger, dancing version of Daphne.And what about Rosie?asked Claudia.Rosie is totally unsuitable.I wasnt asking that, said Claudia.Just whether she accepts you for yourself.I thought about it for a few moments.It was a difficult question.I think so.Because she isnt evaluating me as a partner.Its probably good that you feel like that, said Claudia.Feel!Feel, feel, feel!Feelings were disrupting my sense of well being.In addition to a nagging desire to be working on the Father Project rather than the Wife Project, I now had a high level of anxiety related to Bianca.Throughout my life I have been criticized for a perceived lack of emotion, as if this were some absolute fault.Interactions with psychiatrists and psychologistseven including Claudiastart from the premise that I should be more in touch with my emotions.What they really mean is that I should give in to them.I am perfectly happy to detect, recognize, and analyze emotions.This is a useful skill and I would like to be better at it.Occasionally an emotion can be enjoyedthe gratitude I felt for my sister, who visited me even during the bad times, the primitive feeling of well being after a glass of winebut we need to be vigilant that emotions do not cripple us.I diagnosed brain overload and set up a spreadsheet to analyze the situation.I began by listing the recent disturbances to my schedule.Two were unquestionably positive.Eva, the short skirted cleaner, was doing an excellent job and had freed up considerable time.Without her, most of the recent additional activities would not have been possible.And anxiety notwithstanding, I had my first fully qualified applicant for the Wife Project.I had made a decision that I wanted a partner and for the first time I had a viable candidate.Logic dictated that the Wife Project, to which I had planned to allocate most of my free time, should now receive maximum attention.Here, I identified problem number one.My emotions were not aligned with logic.I was reluctant to pursue the opportunity.I did not know whether to list the Father Project as positive or negative, but it had consumed enormous time for zero outcome.My arguments for pursuing it had always been weak, and I had done far more than could reasonably be expected of me.If Rosie wanted to locate and obtain DNA from the remaining candidates, she could do so herself.She now had substantial practical experience with the collection procedure.I could offer to perform the actual tests.Once again, logic and emotion were not in step.I wanted to continue the Father Project.Why?It is virtually impossible to make useful comparisons of levels of happiness, especially across long periods of time.But if I had been asked to choose the happiest day of my life, I would previously have nominated, without hesitation, the first day I spent at the American Museum of Natural History in New York when I traveled there for a conference during my PhD studies.The second best day was the second day there, and the third best the third day there.But after recent events, the answer was not so clear.It was difficult to choose between the Natural History Museum and the night of cocktail making at the golf club.Should I therefore consider resigning my job and accepting Amghads offer of a partnership in a cocktail bar?Would I be permanently happier?The idea seemed ludicrous.The cause of my confusion was that I was dealing with an equation that contained large negative values, most seriously the disruption to my schedule, and large positive values, the consequential enjoyable experiences.My inability to quantify these factors accurately meant that I could not determine the net resultnegative or positive.And the margin of error was huge.I marked the Father Project as being of undetermined net value and ranked it the most serious disturbance.The last item on my spreadsheet was the immediate risk that my nervousness and ambivalence about the Wife Project would impede my social interaction with Bianca.I was not concerned about the dancing: I was confident that I could draw on my experience of preparing for martial arts competitions, with the supplementary advantage of an optimum intake of alcohol, which for martial arts is not permitted.My concern was more with social faux pas.It would be terrible to lose the perfect relationship because I failed to detect sarcasm or looked into her eyes for more or less than the conventional period of time.I reassured myself that Claudia was essentially correct: if these things concerned Bianca excessively, she was not the perfect match, and I would at least be in a position to refine the questionnaire for future use.I visited a formal costume rental establishment as recommended by Gene and specified maximum formality.I did not want a repeat of the Jacket Incident.seventeen   The ball was on a Friday evening at a reception center on the river.For efficiency, I had brought my costume to work and practiced the cha cha and rumba with my skeleton while I waited to leave.When I went to the lab to get a beer, I felt a strong twinge of emotion.I was missing the stimulation of the Father Project.The morning suit, with its tails and tall hat, was totally impractical for cycling, so I took a taxi and arrived at exactly 7:55 p. m. , as planned.Behind me, another taxi pulled up and a tall, dark haired woman stepped out.She was wearing the worlds most amazing dress: multiple bright colorsred, blue, yellow, greenwith a complex structure including a split up one side.I had never seen anyone so spectacular.Estimated age thirty five, BMI twenty two, consistent with the questionnaire responses.Neither a little early nor a little late.Was I looking at my future wife?It was almost unbelievable.As I stepped out of the taxi, she looked at me for a moment, then turned and walked toward the door.I took a deep breath and followed.She stepped inside and looked around.She saw me again and looked more carefully this time.I approached her, close enough to speak, being careful not to invade her personal space.I looked into her eyes.I counted one, two.Then I lowered my eyes a little, downward, but only a tiny distance.Hi, I said.Im Don.She looked at me for a while before extending her hand to shake with low pressure.Im Bianca.Youve ...really dressed up.Of course, the invitation specified formal.After approximately two seconds she burst into laughter.You had me for a minute there.So deadpan.You know, you write good sense of humor on the list of things youre looking for, but you never expect to get a real comedian.I think you and I are going to have fun.Things were going extremely well.The ballroom was hugedozens of tables with formally dressed academics.Everyone turned to look at us, and it was obvious that we had made an impression.At first I thought it must be Biancas spectacular dress, but there were numerous other interestingly dressed women.Then I noticed that the men were almost without exception dressed in black suits with white shirts and bow ties.None wore tails or a hat.It accounted for Biancas initial reaction.It was annoying, but not a situation I was unfamiliar with.I doffed my hat to the crowd and they shouted greetings.Bianca seemed to enjoy the attention.We were at table twelve, according to the seating index, right on the edge of the dance floor.A band was tuning up.Observing their instruments, I concluded that my skills at cha cha, samba, rumba, foxtrot, waltz, tango, and lambada would not be required.I would need to draw on the work of the second day of the dancing projectrock n roll.Genes recommendation to arrive thirty minutes after the official start time meant that all but three of the seats at the table were already occupied.One of these belonged to Gene, who was walking around, pouring champagne.Claudia was not present.I identified Laszlo Hevesi from Physics, who was dressed totally inappropriately in combat pants and a hiking shirt, sitting next to a woman whom I recognized with surprise as Frances from the speed dating night.On Laszlos other side was the Beautiful Helena.There was also a dark haired man of about thirty (BMI approximately twenty) who appeared not to have shaved for several days, and beside him, the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.In contrast to the complexity of Biancas costume, she was wearing a green dress with zero decoration, so minimal that it did not even have straps to hold it in place.It took me a moment to realize that its wearer was Rosie.Bianca and I took the two vacant seats between Stubble Man and Frances, following the alternating male female pattern that had been established.Rosie began the introductions, and I recognized the protocol that I had learned for conferences and never actually used.Don, this is Stefan.She was referring to Stubble Man.I extended my hand and shook, matching his pressure, which I judged as excessive.I had an immediate negative reaction to him.I am generally not competent at assessing other humans, except through the content of their conversation or written communication.But I am reasonably astute at identifying students who are likely to be disruptive.Your reputation precedes you, Stefan said.Perhaps my assessment was too hasty.Youre familiar with my work?You might say that.He laughed.I realized that I could not pursue the conversation until I introduced Bianca.Rosie, Stefan, allow me to present Bianca Rivera.Rosie extended her hand and said, Delighted to meet you.They smiled hard at each other and Stefan shook Biancas hand also.My duty done, I turned to Laszlo, whom I had not spoken to for some time.Laszlo is the only person I know with poorer social skills than mine, and it was reassuring to have him nearby for contrast.Greetings, Laszlo, I said, assessing that formality would not be appropriate in his case.Greetings, Frances.You found a partner.How many encounters were required?Gene introduced us, said Laszlo.He was staring inappropriately at Rosie.Gene gave a thumbs up signal to Laszlo, then moved between Bianca and me with the champagne bottle.Bianca immediately upended her glass.Don and I dont drink, she said, turning mine down as well.Gene gave me a huge smile.It was an odd response to an annoying version control oversight on my part: Bianca had apparently responded to the original questionnaire.Rosie asked Bianca, How do you and Don know each other?We share an interest in dancing, Bianca said.I thought this was an excellent reply, not referring to the Wife Project, but Rosie gave me a strange look.How nice, she said.Im a bit too busy with my PhD to have time for dancing.You have to be organized, said Bianca.I believe in being very organized.Yes, said Rosie, I  The first time I made the final of the nationals was in the middle of my PhD.I thought about dropping the triathlon or the Japanese cookery course, but ...Rosie smiled, but not in the way she usually did.No, that would have been silly.Men love a woman who can cook.I like to think weve moved beyond that sort of stereotyping, said Bianca.Dons quite a cook himself.Claudias suggestion that I mention my competence in cooking on the questionnaire had obviously been effective.Rosie provided some evidence.Hes fabulous.We had the most amazing lobster on his balcony.Oh, really?It was helpful that Rosie was recommending me to Bianca, but Stefan was displaying the disruptive student expression again.I applied my lecture technique of asking him a question first.Are you Rosies boyfriend?Stefan did not have a ready answer, and in a lecture that would have been my cue to continue, with the student now healthily wary of me.But Rosie answered for him.Stefan is doing his PhD with me.I believe the term is partner, said Stefan.For this evening, said Rosie.Stefan smiled.First date.It was odd that they did not seem to have agreed on the nature of their relationship.Rosie turned back to Bianca.And yours and Dons first date too?Thats right, Rosie.How did you find the questionnaire?Bianca looked quickly at me, then turned back to Rosie.Wonderful.Most men only want to talk about themselves.It was so nice to have someone focusing on me.I can see how that would work for you, said Rosie.And a dancer, Bianca said.I couldnt believe my luck.But you know what they say: the harder I work, the luckier I get.Rosie picked up her champagne glass, and Stefan said, How long have you been dancing, Don?Won any prizes?I was saved from answering by the arrival of the Dean.She was wearing a complex pink dress, the lower part of which spread out widely, and was accompanied by a woman of approximately the same age dressed in the standard male ball costume of black suit and bow tie.The reaction of the ball goers was similar to that at my entrance, without the friendly greetings at the end.Oh dear, said Bianca.I had a low opinion of the Dean, but the comment made me uncomfortable.You have a problem with gay women?said Rosie, slightly aggressively.Not at all, said Bianca.My problems with her dress sense.Youll have fun with Don, then, said Rosie.I think Don looks fabulous, said Bianca.It takes flair to pull off something a little different.Anyone can wear a dinner suit or a plain frock.Dont you think so, Don?I nodded in polite agreement.Bianca was exhibiting exactly the characteristics I was looking for.There was every chance she would be perfect.But for some reason, my instincts were rebelling.Perhaps it was the no drinking rule.My underlying addiction to alcohol was causing my unconscious to send a signal to reject someone who stopped me from drinking.I needed to overcome it.We finished our entres and the band played a few loud chords.Stefan walked over to them and took the microphone from the singer.Good evening, everyone, he said.I thought you should know that we have a former finalist in the national dancing championships with us this evening.You may have seen her on television.Bianca Rivera.Lets give Bianca and her partner Don a few minutes to entertain us.I had not expected my first performance to be so public, but there was the advantage of an unobstructed dance floor.I have given lectures to larger audiences and participated in martial arts bouts in front of crowds.There was no reason to be nervous.Bianca and I stepped onto the dance floor.I took her in the standard jive hold that I had practiced on the skeleton, and immediately felt the awkwardness, approaching revulsion, that I feel when forced into intimate contact with another human.I had mentally prepared for this, but not for a more serious problem.I had not practiced with music.I am sure I executed the steps accurately, but not at precisely the correct speed, and not at the same time as the beat.We were immediately tripping over each other and the net effect was a disaster.Bianca tried to lead, but I had no experience with a living partner, let alone one who was trying to be in control.People began laughing.I am an expert at being laughed at and, as Bianca pulled away from me, I scanned the audience to see who was not laughing, an excellent means of identifying friends.Gene and Rosie and, surprisingly, the Dean and her partner were my friends tonight.Stefan was definitely not.Something major was required to save the situation.In my dancing research, I had noted some specialized moves that I had not intended to use but remembered because they were so interesting.They had the advantage of not being highly dependent on synchronized timing or body contact.Now was the time to deploy them.I performed the running man, milking the cow, and the fishing imitation, reeling Bianca in, though she did not actually move as required.In fact she was standing totally still.Finally, I attempted a body contact maneuver, traditionally used for a spectacular finish, in which the male swings the female on either side, over his back, and between his legs.Unfortunately this requires cooperation on the part of the partner, particularly if she is heavier than a skeleton.Bianca offered no such cooperation and the effect was as if I had attacked her.Unlike aikido, dancing training apparently does not include practice in falling safely.I offered to help her up, but she ignored my hand and walked toward the bathroom, apparently uninjured.I went back to the table and sat down.Stefan was still laughing.You bastard, Rosie said to him.Gene said something to Rosie, presumably to prevent inappropriate public anger, and she seemed to calm down.Bianca returned to her seat, but only to collect her bag.The problem was synchronization, I tried to tell her.The metronome in my head is not set to the same frequency as the band.Bianca turned away, but Rosie seemed prepared to listen to my explanation.I turned off the sound during practice so I could focus on learning the steps.Rosie did not reply, and I heard Bianca speaking to Stefan.It happens.This isnt the first time, just the worst.Men say they can dance ...She walked toward the exit without saying good night to me, but Gene followed and intercepted her.This gave me an opportunity.I righted my glass and filled it with wine.It was a poorly made gordo blanco with excessive residual sugar.I drank it and poured another.Rosie got up from her seat and walked over to the band.She spoke to the singer, then the drummer.She returned and pointed at me in a stylized manner.I recognized the action: I had seen it twelve times.It was the signal that Olivia Newton John gave to John Travolta in Grease to commence the dance sequence that I had been practicing when Gene interrupted me nine days earlier.Rosie pulled me toward the dance floor.Dance, she said.Just fucking dance.I started dancing without music.This was what I had practiced.Rosie followed according to my tempo.Then she raised her arm and started waving it in time with our movements.I heard the drummer start playing and could tell in my body that he was in time with us.I barely noticed the rest of the band start up.Rosie was a good dancer and considerably easier to manipulate than the skeleton.I led her through the more difficult moves, totally focused on the mechanics and on not making errors.The Grease song finished and everyone clapped.But before we could return to the table, the band started again and the audience clapped in time: Satisfaction.It may have been due to the effect of the gordo blanco on my cognitive functions, but I was suddenly overwhelmed by an extraordinary feelingnot of satisfaction but of absolute joy.It was the feeling I had in the Museum of Natural History and when I was making cocktails.We started dancing again, and this time I allowed myself to focus on the sensations of my body moving to the beat of the song from my childhood and of Rosie moving to the same rhythm.The music finished and everyone clapped again.I looked for Bianca, my date, and located her near the exit with Gene.I had presumed she would be impressed that the problem was solved, but even from a distance and with my limited ability to interpret expressions, I could see that she was furious.She turned and left.The rest of the evening was incredible, changed totally by one dance.Everyone came up to Rosie and me to offer compliments.The photographer gave us each a photo without charging us.Stefan left early.Gene obtained some high quality champagne from the bar, and we drank several glasses with him and a Hungarian postdoc named Klara from Physics.Rosie and I danced again, and then I danced with almost every woman at the ball.I asked Gene if I should invite the Dean or her partner, but he considered this to be a question beyond even his social expertise.In the end I did not, as the Dean was visibly in a bad mood.The crowd had made it clear that they would rather dance than listen to her scheduled speech.At the end of the night, the band played a waltz, and when it was finished, I looked around and it was just Rosie and me on the dance floor.And everyone applauded again.It was only later that I realized that I had experienced extended close contact with another human without feeling uncomfortable.I attributed it to my concentration on correctly executing the dance steps.You want to share a taxi?asked Rosie.It seemed a sensible use of fossil fuel.In the taxi, Rosie said to me, You should have practiced with different beats.Youre not as smart as I thought you were.I just looked out the window of the taxi.Then she said, No way.No fucking way.You did, didnt you?Thats worse.Youd rather make a fool of yourself in front of everyone than tell her she didnt float your boat.It would have been extremely awkward.I had no reason to reject her.Besides not wanting to marry a parakeet, said Rosie.I found this incredibly funny, no doubt as a result of alcohol and decompensation after the stress.We both laughed for several minutes, and Rosie even touched me a few times on the shoulder.I didnt mind, but when we stopped laughing, I felt awkward again and averted my gaze.Youre unbelievable, said Rosie.Look at me when Im talking.I kept looking out the window.I was already overstimulated.I know what you look like.What color eyes do I have?Brown.When I was born, I had blue eyes, she said.Baby blues.Like my mother.She was Irish but she had blue eyes.Then they turned brown.I looked at Rosie.This was incredible.Your mothers eyes changed color?My eyes.It happens with babies.That was when my mother realized that Phil wasnt my father.She had blue eyes and so does Phil.And she decided to tell him.I suppose I should be grateful he wasnt a lion.I was having trouble making sense of all that Rosie was saying, doubtless owing to the effects of the alcohol and her perfume.However, she had given me an opportunity to keep the conversation on safe ground.The inheritance of common genetically influenced traits such as eye color is more complex than is generally understood, and I was confident that I could speak on the topic for long enough to occupy the remainder of our journey.But I realized that this was a defensive action and impolite to Rosie, who had risked considerable embarrassment and damage to her relationship with Stefan for my benefit.I rolled back my thoughts and reparsed her statement: I suppose I should be grateful he wasnt a lion.I assumed she was referring to our conversation on the night of the Balcony Meal when I informed her that lions kill the offspring of previous matings.Perhaps she wanted to talk about Phil.This was interesting to me too.The entire motivation for the Father Project was Phils failure in that role.But Rosie had offered no real evidence beyond his opposition to alcohol, ownership of an impractical vehicle, and selection of a jewelry box as a gift.Was he violent?I asked.No.She paused for a while.He was justall over the place.One day Id be the most special kid in the world, next day he didnt want me there.This seemed very general, and hardly a justification for a major DNA investigation project.Can you provide an example?Where do I start?Okay, the first time was when I was ten.He promised to take me to Disneyland.I told everyone at school.And I waited and waited and waited and it never happened.The taxi stopped outside a block of flats.Rosie kept talking, looking at the back of the drivers seat.So I have this whole thing about rejection.She turned to me.How do you deal with it?The problem has never occurred, I told her.It was not the time to begin a new conversation.Bullshit, said Rosie.It appeared that I would need to answer honestly.I was in the presence of a psychology graduate.There were some problems at school, I said.Hence the martial arts.But I developed some nonviolent techniques for dealing with difficult social situations.Like tonight.I emphasized the things that people found amusing.Rosie didnt respond.I recognized the therapy technique but could not think of anything to do but elaborate.I didnt have many friends.Basically zero, except my sister.Unfortunately she died two years ago because of medical incompetence.What happened?said Rosie, quietly.An undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy.Oh, Don, said Rosie, very sympathetically.I sensed that I had chosen an appropriate person to confide in.Was she ...in a relationship?No.I anticipated her next question.We never found out the source.What was her name?This was, on the surface, an innocuous question, though I could see no purpose in Rosies knowing my sisters name.The indirect reference was unambiguous, as I had only one sister.But I felt very uncomfortable.It took me a few moments to realize why.Although there had been no deliberate decision on my part, I had not said her name since her death.Michelle, I said to Rosie.After that, neither of us spoke for a while.The taxi driver coughed artificially.I presumed he wasnt asking for a beer.You want to come up?said Rosie.I was feeling overwhelmed.Meeting Bianca, dancing, rejection by Bianca, social overload, discussion of personal mattersnow, just when I thought the ordeal was over, Rosie seemed to be proposing more conversation.I was not sure I could cope.Its extremely late, I said.I was sure this was a socially acceptable way of saying that I wanted to go home.The taxi fares go down again in the morning.If I understood correctly, I was now definitely far out of my depth.I needed to be sure that I wasnt misinterpreting her.Are you suggesting I stay the night?Maybe.First you have to listen to the story of my life.Warning!Danger, Will Robinson.Unidentified alien approaching!I could feel myself slipping into the emotional abyss.I managed to stay calm enough to respond.Unfortunately I have a number of activities scheduled for the morning.Routine, normality.Rosie opened the taxi door.I willed her to go.But she had more to say.Don, can I ask you something?One question.Do you find me attractive?Gene told me the next day that I got it wrong.But he was not in a taxi, after an evening of total sensory overload, with the most beautiful woman in the world.I believed I did well.I detected the trick question.I wanted Rosie to like me, and I remembered her passionate statement about men treating women as objects.She was testing to see if I saw her as an object or as a person.Obviously the correct answer was the latter.I havent really noticed, I told the most beautiful woman in the world.eighteen   I texted Gene from the taxi.It was 1:08 a. m. , but he had left the ball at the same time as I did and had further to travel.Urgent: Run tomorrow 6 a. m.  Gene texted back: Sunday at 8.Bring Biancas contact info.I was about to insist on the earlier date when I realized that I could profitably use the time to organize my thoughts.It seemed obvious that Rosie had invited me to have sex with her.I was right to have avoided the situation.We had both drunk a substantial quantity of champagne, and alcohol is notorious for encouraging unwise decisions about sex.Rosie had the perfect example.Her mothers decision, doubtless prompted by alcohol, was still causing Rosie significant distress.My own sexual experience was limited.Gene had advised that it was conventional to wait until the third date, and my relationships had never progressed beyond the first.In fact, Rosie and I had technically had only one datethe night of the Jacket Incident and the Balcony Meal.I did not use the services of brothels, not for any moral reason, but because I found the idea distasteful.This was not a rational reason, but since the benefits I was seeking were only primitive, a primitive reason was sufficient.But I now seemed to have an opportunity for what Gene would call no strings attached sex.The required conditions were in place: Rosie and I had clearly agreed that neither of us had an interest in a romantic relationship, then Rosie had indicated that she wanted to have sex with me.Did I want to have sex with Rosie?There seemed no logical reason not to, leaving me free to obey the dictates of my primitive desires.The answer was an extremely clear yes.Having made this completely rational decision, I could think of nothing else.On Sunday morning, Gene met me outside his house.I had brought Biancas contact details and checked her nationalityPanamanian.Gene was very pleased about the latter.Gene wanted full details of my encounter with Rosie, but I had decided it was a waste of effort to explain it twice: I would tell him and Claudia together.As I had no other subject to discuss and Gene had difficulty in running and speaking concurrently, we spent the next forty seven minutes in silence.When we returned to Genes house, Claudia and Eugenie were having breakfast.I sat down and said, I require some advice.Can it wait?said Claudia.We have to take Eugenie to horse riding and then were meeting people for brunch.No.I may have made a social error.I broke one of Genes rules.Gene said, Don, I think the Panamanian bird has flown.Put that one down to experience.The rule applies to Rosie, not Bianca.Never pass up a chance to have sex with a woman under thirty.Gene told you that?said Claudia.Carl had entered the room and I prepared to defend myself against his ritual attack, but he stopped to look at his father.I thought I should consult with you because youre a psychologist and with Gene because of his extensive practical experience, I said.Gene looked at Claudia, then at Carl.In my misspent youth, he said.Not my teens.He turned back to me.I think this can wait till lunch tomorrow.What about Claudia?I asked.Claudia got up from the table.Im sure theres nothing Gene doesnt know.This was encouraging, especially coming from his wife.You said what?said Gene.We were having lunch in the University Club as scheduled.I said that I hadnt noticed her appearance.I didnt want her to think I saw her as a sexual object.Jesus, said Gene.The one time you think before you speak is the one time you shouldnt have.I should have said she was beautiful?I was incredulous.Got it in one, said Gene, incorrectly, as the problem was that I hadnt gotten it right the first time.Thatll explain the cake.I must have looked blank.For obvious reasons.Shes been eating chocolate cake.At her desk.For breakfast.This seemed to me to be an unhealthy choice, consistent with smoking, but not an indicator of distress.But Gene assured me that it was to make herself feel better.Having supplied Gene with the necessary background information, I presented my problem.Youre saying shes not the one, said Gene.Not a life partner.Totally unsuitable.But shes extremely attractive.
