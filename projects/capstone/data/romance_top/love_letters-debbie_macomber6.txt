He just stared at her as if he refused to believe what shed told him.And who could blame him?She would be the last person anyone would suspect of having a one night stand.Even now she couldnt comprehend why it was called that.As far as she remembered, shed done very little standing.And until just this morning her husband had refused to even talk about that night.She heard the cars engine start, and that pulled her back to the present.Her husband followed the car in front of him onto the ferry.They were directed onto the second level and parked near the stairwell that led to the observation level and the cafeteria.He turned off the engine and said, You seem a million miles away.She smiled, hoping to reassure him that all was well.Roy reached for her hand, gently folding it in his own.I didnt want to talk about what happened  and the aftermath of it.You were right when you said I wanted to sweep everything under the rug.She hung her head.I cant blame you  I wanted to do the same thing, too.But eventually it would have destroyed us.I feel better than I have in weeks.Maggie forced a smile.With everything in her, she wanted to assure him she felt that same sense of peace, but it would be a lie.A very big lie.In all her life, Maggie had never felt less like putting on a happy face.Lets go up front, Roy suggested.Maggies legs felt like they wouldnt support her as she climbed the stairwell to the observation deck.The ferry had upholstered beige booths against both sides of the windows and chair seating in rows in the middle.Roy led her toward the doors leading outside.As they stepped onto the deck, the wind whipped Maggies hair about her face as the sun shone down bright and warm.The ferry released a loud honk as it glided away from the dock and toward Seattle.Seagulls followed, looking for handouts from the passengers.A teenager stretched his arm high above his head, holding on to a french fry.To the passengers delight, a large gull swooped down and grabbed it from his fingers.Maggie looked down at the waves slapping against the sides of the huge boat.The dark green water mesmerized her.How easy it would be to jump from here and disappear in the deep waters of Puget Sound.That way shed never have to face the future.Never have to face the consequences of a single indiscretion.She didnt deserve this misery.It took all the restraint she possessed not to rant at God that this was unfair.It was all wrong.Roy came to stand behind her, his hands on her shoulders, protecting her from the wind.Leaning close, he whispered, I love you, Maggie, heart and soul, I love you.She leaned back and tucked her head beneath his chin and closed her eyes.Right now his love was secure, but she wondered how long hed love her once she told him she was pregnant.You asked me earlier if I still meant the things I wrote in that letter back when we were in college, Roy continued.I shouldnt have hesitated.I knew then and I know now, every word was true.We were meant to be together.Youre my soul mate.Maggie turned around and buried her face in her husbands chest as he hugged her close.She found it difficult not to break down in tears.Im going inside to use the restroom, she told Roy.She needed a definitive answer.Ill come inside with you.Do you want a cup of coffee?he asked.Tea, she said, wanting to keep him occupied if this test took longer than she expected.You know how I like it.Ill find us a seat.I wont be long, she promised.Thankfully, the restroom wasnt crowded.Maggie went into the narrow stall and removed the pregnancy test from inside her purse and quickly read the instructions.Five minutes.That was all it would take either to reassure her or for her world to implode.Five short minutes.Only they werent short minutes.They ticked by in agonizing seconds, one by one, until she thought she would go mad, waiting.In truth, it didnt take the required time.The test strip confirmed her suspicions long before the final seconds of her cell phone timer ticked off.It was blue.She was pregnant.17     This is  my father, Ellie repeated, when she found she could speak again.The man standing in front of her looked as awkward and uncomfortable as she felt.Frowning, she turned to Tom, waiting for him to explain.None of this made sense.Hed mentioned a surprise for her, but surely this couldnt be it.Hello, Ellie, the other man said.She didnt return the greeting.Instead, her gaze held Toms, and when she spoke, it was to him.I dont understand.I know this is something of a shock   Something?she repeated, incredulously.Give me a chance to explain.Please do.Tom gestured toward a picnic table, silently suggesting they all sit down as if this was a big family reunion and everyone should be hugging and greeting one another.Ellie shook her head.No  no  This wasnt a family outing where shed whip out a tablecloth and set down a few plates while he cooked hot dogs on the barbecue.After your mother and I divorced, I married Toms mother, the man who claimed to be her father said.Ellie stretched out her arm as though to ward him off.I asked Tom.He should be the one to tell me what this is about.I  wanted to find you for my dad, Tom said.Find me?she repeated.Find me?All at once everything started stacking up in her mind in neat, orderly columns.The book club friend request on the social media platform, the skillful strategy as he introduced himself and kept the communication open, carefully wooing her.Bit by bit, day by day, a little at a time gaining her confidence.Their meeting hadnt been accidental or a quirk of fate but carefully orchestrated.Hed sought her out, discovered her interests, and then manipulated their meeting.Ellie backed up two steps.You planned this from the start  you hid who you are and used me.Was he in on this as well?she demanded, nodding toward her father.This is as much a surprise to me as it is to you, Scott Reynolds murmured.I didnt know anything about it until just recently  this morning, in fact.No wonder he looked so ill at ease and uncomfortable.In other words, her father had never had any intention of contacting her.Meeting her wasnt his doing, his wish.Hed walked out on her and her mother and found a new family, a new life.Countless times Tom had talked about his stepfather, whom he always referred to as Dad.Dad this.Dad that.Her father.Tom had been raised by her father.Tom had no real feelings for her.He didnt love her.It was her father he cared for so deeply.Its only right that you know the man responsible for your life, Tom said.You told me so yourself.Please, Ellie, give me a chance to explain.Tom had taken the confidences shed shared with him and used them against her.Let you explain?she repeated, her mind whirling like the blades of a helicopter, only she wasnt being lifted off the ground and taken away.Instead, she was left to face  she didnt know what.Scott is a good man.At least give him the opportunity  No, Ellie cried, and for emphasis, shook her head.She turned on Tom, her voice shaking with emotion.You used me.No, he protested, quick to defend himself.It wasnt like that.Ellie refused to believe him.It was no accident that you sought me out on Facebook.You said so yourself.Okay, in the beginning.Dad talked about you and your mother with such regret and sorrow.I felt it was only right that he have a chance to know his own flesh and blood.Ellie wasnt willing to listen to any of this.She noticed her father had nothing to say, which was just as well.I find it interesting that it was you who went in search of me and not him.She pointed at the older man.He couldnt be bothered with me, right?She glared at this stranger, accusing him with her eyes.All the years shed been without him, all the years shed yearned to know her father, and all thered been was silence.Even now he had nothing to say for himself.He seemed to find it difficult to even look at her.He was ashamed of himself, as well he should be.He abandoned his own flesh and created a home for other children.Almost right away another realization hit her between the eyes, this one more painful than all the other neatly compiled facts coming together in her brain.Tom had urged her to come to Cedar Cove, but it wasnt because he cared for her or wanted to make her part of his life.He had an agenda.Getting her to love him was a means to an end.His means; his end.Once more she retreated, backing away from the two men.Tom had involved her heart, gained her confidence for his own selfish purposes.He didnt care about her; he didnt love her.Almost everything her mother had warned her against was happening.Her big leap of faith, her single act of independence, had turned around and bitten her in the face.Tears filled her eyes.I dont believe this   Ellie, please.Please, listen, give me a chance to explain.No.She glared at Tom and then her father.I dont want to see either one of you again.Ever.With that, she took off in a rush, unable to get away fast enough.Tom hurried after her.It isnt like that, Ellie.Please listen.Okay, okay, youre right.Finding you was calculated, but then I fell in love with you.She wanted to laugh.Do you honestly expect me to believe that?Yes.In the beginning my goal was to set up a meeting between Dad and you, but as time went on and we became more involved I realized I wanted you for myself.His face was a blur as she glared at him through the moisture filling her eyes.Then you should have told me who you were.Youre right, I should have.Give me another chance.Please.Ellie wrapped her arms around her middle as if to ward off a chill.I need to think this through.And for now I need you to go away.I cant, he pleaded.I cant leave things between us like this.Give me time, she insisted.I need time to process this.He hesitated and then asked, How long do you need?An hour, a day?Ellie couldnt give him a timetable.Let me put it like this: Ill call you, dont call me.No, he insisted, and stopped her, gripping hold of her by the shoulders.His eyes bore into hers, demanding that she pay attention.Youre right, he said.I went about this all wrong, and for that I apologize.Im sorry; I would never purposely do anything to hurt you.Distressed as she was, Ellie wanted to push him away, but her heart desperately yearned to believe him.Shed already made a fool of herself once because of Tom and she was terrified of making the same mistake again.I fell in love with you, Ellie.His eyes were intent, serious.Im not making this up; Im speaking from my heart.How badly she wanted to believe him, but she was afraid.When she didnt respond, he tried again.Put my feelings for you aside.Your father loves you.Ellie had no proof of that, none whatsoever.She tried to jerk her arms free, but Tom held on tightly.Its true, he insisted.I didnt know about you until after my mother died.That fact alone belied everything hed just said.My father loved me so much that I was constantly on his mind, right?He couldnt stop talking about me.If Tom thought he was proving his point, hed achieved the exact opposite.He told my mother.That makes me feel worlds better, she murmured sarcastically.After Mom died, Dad said he had a lot of regrets in his life but the biggest regret was not knowing his daughter.Its a little late, dont you think?She was unable to hide her sarcasm.Somewhere along the lines of twenty years too late.He showed me your baby photo.He still carries it in his wallet.He could have called me.He could have written me letters.He tried countless times to reach you, but your grandparents made it impossible, Tom insisted.If you dont believe me, ask your mother.I intend to do exactly that.Talk to him, Ellie, Tom pleaded.At least give him a chance to tell you what happened between your mother and him.No.Do you think it was easy for him to come down here today?Dont you think it was as difficult for him as it is for you?Ellie shook her head.I thought you said his one regret was me  If what you say is true and you had to practically drag him here, then he couldnt have wanted to meet me that badly.I didnt have to drag him.He came of his own free will because he loves you.She snorted with disbelief.Tom dropped his hands, releasing her.He told me that this would happen.That you would hate him  that your grandparents and your mother would have turned you against him, and he was right.My mother has been there every day of my life, supporting and encouraging me.My grandparents were decent, honorable people who loved me.They suffocated you and dictated your every move, he challenged.Ellie was too confused to think straight.You dont know what youre talking about, she insisted, backing away from him.Go ahead, Tom said, run away.Turn your back on your father and on me.You say you need time, then great, take as long as you need.If you want to talk, Ill be here, and so will your father.Hate me if that will make you feel better.Ive no doubt that Im exactly the kind of person your mother warned you against.But if you walk away from your father now, I promise you, Ellie Reynolds, youll regret it the rest of your life.He left her then, rushing back to the waterfront and her father.Ellie watched for just a moment and saw him join the father shed never known.Scott Reynolds sat on a park bench with his shoulders hunched forward as though he wore a mantle of steel.Ellie hurried back toward the inn.By the time she arrived, she was breathless from the steep climb and so badly shaken that every part of her body started to quiver.Because she didnt want Jo Marie to see her when she was this upset, Ellie stayed outside.She made her way onto the porch and sat down in one of the chairs lining the deck, and looked out over the waterfront.From this viewpoint she could see the park, but she forcefully kept her gaze away from where shed left Tom and her father.A rogue tear wove its way down her cheek and was quickly followed by another.She wanted to believe Tom cared for her, but she was afraid to trust him, and who could blame her?The tears refused to stop, and her nose started to run.Reaching for her purse to search for a tissue, Ellie was surprised to find that Rover had joined her, resting at her side, his chin on his paws.You wont believe what happened, she whispered, as she found what she needed and blew her nose.Rover?It was Jo Marie.Ellie grabbed a fresh tissue and wiped the moisture from her face, although she couldnt avoid sniffling.Ellie?Jo Marie said, as she approached her.My goodness, whats wrong?Not wanting to talk, Ellie shook her head, indicating that explaining anything at the moment was beyond her.Jo Marie gave her shoulder a gentle squeeze.I have just the thing, she said, and disappeared back into the house.To Ellies surprise, Rover didnt follow the innkeeper.Instead, he remained steadfastly at her side, going so far as to place his chin on top of her foot.She found the action of great comfort.Have you ever loved someone who bitterly disappointed you?she asked the dog.A few minutes later, Jo Marie returned with a tray containing a big pot of tea, cups, and a small plate of cookies.She set it down on the table.I cant think of a single thing more comforting than tea with cookies.Despite everything, Ellie managed a smile.The other woman poured; steam rose from the delicate china pot and then the teacup as Jo Marie prepared to hand it to Ellie.Milk or sugar?she asked.Ellie declined and took the cup.She held on to the saucer and blew into the steaming liquid.I never knew my father, she whispered.My parents divorced before I had any memories of him.You had no contact with him.Not ever?No, until now  He was just here  down by the waterfront.Here in Cedar Cove?Ellie nodded.Hes Toms father.Jo Marie tried to swallow a gasp but didnt quite succeed.Toms your half brother?No, Tom is my fathers stepson.He raised Tom and his brother, Earl, as if they were his sons.The only reason Tom  She paused, hardly able to say the words.He wanted to reunite me and my father, Ellie finally managed.Oh, Ellie, I dont think thats the only reason.Tom had said as much, but Ellie didnt know what to believe.I saw the way he looked at you this morning, Jo Marie said gently.Toms crazy about you.Ellie shook her head, dismissing the other womans words of reassurance.My father didnt know what Tom was doing any more than I did.He could barely look at me  Tom said my father had tried to contact me through the years but my mother and grandparents intervened and wouldnt allow it  but he could have gone through the courts.If hed really wanted me in his life, he would have moved heaven and earth to make it happen.Yes, Jo Marie agreed, as she settled into the chair beside Ellie.We all have regrets, though, dont we?she asked.I imagine you would have welcomed the opportunity to know your father.As a kid, I would have done anything to hear from him, to talk to him.I needed my father and he wasnt available.I was an inconvenience.Jo Marie sipped her tea.Whats so different now?she asked.Ellie turned to look at her.What do you mean?Hes here now.It must have taken a great deal of courage to meet you, after all this time, knowing how deeply hes failed you.Tom had said basically the same thing.Hed gone so far as to claim if she turned her back on her father now she would always regret it.Dont you think you should give him a chance?Jo Marie asked.But Tom   Deal with Tom later, the innkeeper urged.My mother warned me about him  she told me I shouldnt trust him.Oh, Ellie, your mothers been hurt, badly hurt, and while her intentions are good, shes tainted your view of men and life.I dont mean to bad mouth her, and I hope I havent spoken out of turn.What Jo Marie said was true, and Ellie immediately recognized it.Youre right, she whispered.I should at least give my father a chance to explain  we should talk.I dont think youll regret it.Ellie reached for her phone and sent Tom a text message.Id like to talk to my father.Tell me where I should meet him.But you need to stay away.18     Poor Ellie.I wanted to wrap my arms around her and tell her it would all work out in the end.Mostly I wanted to give Tom a piece of my mind for pulling this trick on her.It didnt take me long to forgive him, though.After Ellie and I talked a bit and I returned to the kitchen I was less perturbed with him.Instinctively, I knew he meant well, although I questioned his methods.It was apparent Tom cared deeply for his stepfather.After meeting Tom and seeing him with Ellie, I had to believe he held some deep affection for her.I said as much, which I think helped Ellie.What was that saying?Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.I was fairly certain it went something like that.My guess was that Tom had gotten himself in deeper than hed ever intended.I noticed Mark wasnt working on the gazebo, and I suspected Id chased him off with my invitation to Sunday dinner.It seemed most every effort I made to get to know him better backfired.Clearly, meeting my family put him on edge.I wanted Mark to realize that I considered him a good friend, a prickly one, but still my friend.Even more, I hoped that hed consider the invitation to meet my family as a roundabout way of showing him I genuinely wanted us to know each other better.Until that morning, I didnt realize how close I felt to Mark.Not in a romantic way but as a friend.Why else would I have told him that I felt I was losing my grip on my memories of my dead husband?The oddest look had come over Mark, and, really, who could blame him?It embarrassed me that Id chosen to blurt it out.One look at him told me how uncomfortable the information had made him.He wasnt someone who shared confidences, and it appeared he didnt know how to deal with it when others did.Mark was on my mind a good deal lately, and that made me uncomfortable.Mostly he frustrated me, and at the same time he was my friend.We saw each other nearly every day, especially if he was working on a project at the inn.Id come to rely on him, probably more than I should.The door off the porch opened and Ellie came in carrying the teacup and saucer.Are you feeling better?I asked, taking the china from her and placing it on the kitchen countertop.She nodded.Much better.Thank you for listening, Jo Marie.Anytime.I resisted the urge to hug her.Shed endured a shock, and while my tendency was to comfort and mother her, that wasnt what she wanted.From what I knew about her, Ellie had been nearly mothered to death.She had to reach this decision about her father and Tom all on her own.I didnt want to influence her one way or the other.Im going to my room, Ellie said.I can feel a headache coming on, and I think Ill feel better if I lie down for a few minutes.Call me if you need anything, I told her, wanting to be helpful but at the same time give her the space she needed.I will, and again, thank you.Ellie headed toward the stairs leading to the second floor.Once more I felt the urge to do something physical and decided I needed to check out the attic, which was accessible from the third floor.Itd been on my to do list for quite some time and I kept putting it off.First the cupboards, now this.Id straightened out my drawers the night before, burying Pauls sweatshirt in the bottom of my dresser.If it wasnt going to comfort me as it had so often in the past, then Id put it where it was out of the way.Id never explored the attic.When I purchased the inn from the Frelingers, theyd mentioned that theyd stored a number of small pieces of furniture and other items there.I wanted to take an inventory in case I decided to have a garage sale.I might put the items I didnt need on consignment, too.Of course, it depended on what was stashed up there.I made my way up to the third floor, where three of the smaller bedrooms were.A rope dangling from the ceiling pulled down a ladder that granted me access to the upper area.Id stuck my head into the attic to look one time but hadnt given it more than a cursory inspection.It was long past time I did.Getting up the ladder wasnt a problem, and, luckily, I wasnt a tall woman.As it was, I had to hunch over in order to move about.If I ran into rodents or saw evidence of their presence I wasnt sure Id be able to handle it.Thankfully, the Frelingers kept everything in an orderly fashion.I found a couple of oak nightstands; a few lamps; a chest, which turned out to be empty; and three or four oil paintings.The artwork was actually pretty good.I remembered Mrs.Frelinger mentioning that shed taken an art class and wondered if these paintings were her own work.Although the light, a single bulb that dangled from the rafters, wasnt great, when I picked up one of the paintings I saw that it wasnt her name on the seascape.None of the items I found were of any use to me.While a garage sale was a good idea, I didnt have enough goods to warrant all the effort that would entail.My gaze skirted back to the seascape.It wasnt all that bad.The walls of the inn were full of artwork, mostly from local artists.The Frelingers had started the collection, and Id added to it until there wasnt a single wall for this seascape unless I moved something else.It was a shame, because it really was quite lovely and deserved to be hung prominently.Then, out of the blue, an idea came to me.The walls in Marks home were barren, bereft of anything personal, as if he didnt want to encumber himself with anything or anyone.To me, however, artwork was important.A single painting could change the entire feel of a room.With that in mind, I decided I would offer this painting to him.Friend to friend, no strings attached.Getting the framed oil painting out of the attic proved to be something of a challenge.I managed with difficulty.When I came down the ladder, Rover was patiently waiting for me.Hed lain on the floor at the bottom of the steep ladder and cocked his head up at me.When he saw the painting, he moved away and barked, letting me know he wasnt pleased with my disappearing into that hole in the ceiling.The painting is for Mark, I explained.Right away, Rover raced down the stairs.By the time I joined him, he sat at the door next to where I kept his leash.He seemed to understand that I intended to walk to Marks place.Instead of hauling the picture all the way to Marks only to discover he wasnt home, I phoned first.The handyman answered on the fourth ring, just before his cell went to voice mail.Hi, he said, and before you ask, I havent changed my mind about dinner on Sunday.Okay, fine.No problem.I didnt call about that.I had another reason entirely.Which is?I have something for you.He hesitated.Youre okay with me not meeting your family?He sounded like he didnt believe me and had anticipated an argument.Im fine with it, I assured him, doing my best to sound ever so understanding.If my voice was any sweeter, hed be swimming in a bowl of honey.He hesitated again.Then what did you want?While he dawdled when it came to getting a job finished, he was far more direct with phone calls.I already told you.I have something for you, I said, a bit annoyed by his attitude.The least he could do was be more gracious.What?The question was filled with suspicion.An oil painting I found in the attic.I was about to describe it for him when he cut me off.A what?Honestly, Mark, is something wrong with your hearing?He was doing this on purpose and it annoyed me.The honey was quickly melting away.Why do I need a painting?Because you dont have one, I snapped.I dont want one.Its a gift, I insisted, growing more agitated by the moment.Youd think I was the unreasonable one by offering him a very nice piece of artwork.To hear his tone of voice, I should be dragged out of town to be tarred and feathered.He went quiet, as if deciding if he wanted to be troubled or not.Fine, whatever, I said.If you dont want the painting, it isnt going to hurt my feelings.Well, to be accurate, it was going to irritate me, but I wouldnt tell him that.The line went silent and seemed to hum as if we didnt have a good connection, only I knew we did.Whats the painting of, anyway?Id have happily explained earlier, if Id been able to get a word in between his protests and accusations.Its a seascape.Hmm   What does that mean?I demanded.Rover grew impatient waiting at the door.His chin was raised, looking toward the leash, eager to get going on our walk.Listen, I said, doing my best to hide my frustration, Im taking Rover for a walk and Ill swing by your place and you can take a look at it.If you want it, fine, its yours free of charge, and if not, no biggie, Ill bring it back to the house.How big is it?he asked.Not big, and it isnt that heavy.Will you be around?Ill be here.Great, then Rover and I will see you in a few minutes.By now I was more than eager to get off the phone.Blast the man, but he was difficult.It isnt necessary, you know.Id been about to disconnect.Sorry, I didnt catch that, I said, gritting my teeth.I should have pretended not to hear him and hung up.He exhaled.I wanted to be sure you understood that I wasnt going to change my mind about that dinner   Mark, honestly, I found the painting in the attic and thought youd like it.This isnt about dinner, my family, or anything else.Howd you get it down from the attic?he asked, sounding deceptively calm.I wasnt fooled.Mark had a thing about me climbing ladders.I brought it down.Im safe; dont worry about it.I made sure my voice cooled considerably.Okay, fine.A couple minutes later, I started out of the inn, hauling the painting.It wasnt heavy, but no more than a block away I wished Id driven my car instead of carrying it myself.Rover was accustomed to walking faster and didnt take kindly to the slower pace.He tugged at his leash, pulling me with him.Slow down, I muttered, as I shifted my weight.Holding on to the painting and the leash made for a cumbersome walk.I went a few more steps, and once again I was forced to stop for fear I was about to drop the artwork.The leash had wrapped itself around my fingers, squeezing off the blood flow.Jo Marie   I peeked around the top of the frame to find Mark walking toward me at a clipped pace.What in the name of heaven are you doing carrying this?I had to agree it wasnt the brightest idea Id ever had, and while I didnt appreciate the lecture, I had to admit I was glad to see him.He mumbled something under his breath, and it was probably best I didnt ask him to repeat himself.As soon as he reached me he took the oil painting out of my hands.Together, we started to his house.Thanks, I murmured, feeling a bit sheepish for being so foolish.I assumed youd be delivering it by car until I remembered you saying something about walking Rover.So that was what caused him to meet me.Hed gone far more than halfway.Arent you even going to look at it?I asked.In the light of day, the picture was lovelier than Id realized.The sun, the sand, the waves crashing against the shoreline, with seagulls flying against the backdrop of a robins egg blue sky.I already did.Sometimes getting him to communicate was like attempting to milk a billy goat.And what did you think?Its okay.As he did with the cookies and muffins, he made it sound like he was helping me out by taking this lovely picture off my hands.The man really did perturb me at times.Where are you going to hang it?I asked next, half skipping in order to keep up with him.Rover loved the quicker pace and trotted along with his head held high, as if he knew exactly where we were going.Dont know yet, Mark answered.Would you like a suggestion?He laughed softly.I have the feeling youre about to give it to me whether I want it or not.True.His living room wall would be perfect, and I told him as much.Why there?You need something to say This is a home.Your house looks like the Sierra Desert.He didnt bother to disguise his amusement.Youre joking, right?No.I was completely serious, and I let it show.I suppose youre about to suggest I hire a decorator next.No.But this is your home, Mark.It should at least feel like one instead of a   I dont need stuff.I agree.Stuff holds down a person.Are you planning on moving anytime soon?I asked, and instantly felt a sense of loss.If Mark decided to leave Cedar Cove, Id miss him.As much as he irritated and frustrated me, I would miss him.Over the summer, especially since hed broken his leg, Id come to rely on Marks friendship.Id lived alone the majority of my adult life and wasnt accustomed to depending on anyone, but Id come to depend on Mark, and the realization shook me.I wont be leaving anytime soon.I was glad to hear it.But you will move on?Probably.I generally get bored with a town after a while.Oh.I didnt know that about him.He stopped walking and gave me an odd look.You okay?Of course.I immediately brushed off his question.You got a funny look just then.Ive sort of gotten to think of Cedar Cove as a good place to settle down for a while, though.I grinned.Me, too.We didnt talk the rest of the way to his house.Mark led me through the kitchen door, which he apparently kept unlocked.I followed him into the main area of the house, which looked almost identical to the way it had the last time I saw it.He had a sofa, a recliner, an end table, and a television, and that was it.I take it Peter McConnell is back in his house again.Yes.Good thing, too, because Id had about as much of him as I could take.I couldnt keep from smiling.That amuses you?No.You do.Very funny.With my hands on my hips I appraised the bare walls, but really there wasnt any question where it belonged.The wall on the opposite side of the television was perfect.What do you think?Mark asked.There, I said, pointing to where I felt the picture was best suited.He shrugged, and if he agreed or disagreed I couldnt guess.Do you want me to help you hang it?I asked.You mean now?He made it sound like an unreasonable demand.Yes, I insisted.Otherwise, youll put it off for another six months or longer.I could easily see it leaning against the wall at Christmas, exactly where it was now.I guess.He disappeared and I heard the back screen slam closed.A good five minutes passed before he returned with a hammer and a couple nails.Within a matter of minutes he had the painting hung, and I had to admit it was perfect.Well, I said, stepping back to admire it.It looks really good, dont you think?He shrugged.Oh come on, Mark, admit it.The painting adds ambiance to this place.Okay, okay, youre right.Its a nice touch.It surprised me that he was willing to admit it.I appreciate it, Jo Marie.I was even more surprised when he thanked me.I must have done a double take, because he took one look at me and started to laugh.Whats so funny?I asked.You.He grinned and seemed to struggle not to break out in laughter a second time.You should have seen the look that came over you just now.He scrunched up his own face, mocking me.Very funny.I suppose youre going to demand that I pay the piper, he said, growing serious all of a sudden.Pay the piper?You want me to meet your family on Sunday.I hoped he would, but if not, Id accept that, too.Not this time, I said.Youll meet my family sooner or later.His eyes narrowed slightly, as if he wasnt sure he believed me.Youre a rare woman, Jo Marie.Sometimes I wonder if I appreciate you near enough.19     The Bremerton ferry docked on the Seattle waterfront and Roy followed the line of cars that motored off the boat.Within a matter of minutes he located a parking lot only a few blocks away from the dock.The secret of what Maggie had discovered weighed on her like the heaviest of yokes.She didnt know how she was going to get through the day, let alone the rest of this getaway weekend.The next eight months seemed like an eternity.He paid for the parking with his credit card, set the slip on his dashboard, and then reached for her hand.Itd been a long time since theyd held hands.Instinctively, Maggie knew he wouldnt be nearly this caring or loving when he discovered she was pregnant.Where shall we head first?Roy asked.I dont know, she said, and smiled at him, hoping he wasnt paying too close attention to her.Her mouth trembled slightly with the effort to appear happy and carefree.What interests you?Lets visit the market, he suggested.Sure.Pike Place Market was a staple for anyone visiting Seattle, right along with the Space Needle, the monorail, the waterfront, and the aquarium.I hope we get to see one of the fishmongers toss a salmon, Roy said, and gently squeezed her hand.They made the climb up the steps leading from the waterfront to First Avenue, stopping now and again at vendor stalls along the Hill Climb.The market was a mixture of fresh fish, garden ripened vegetables, myriad floral bouquets, figurines made from ash from the volcanic eruption of Mount Saint Helens, and just about everything else.Roy purchased a jar of honey, and Maggie found a photo of the Space Needle in the middle of an electric storm.The camera captured a bolt of lightning just as it struck the Needle.She was instantly drawn to it because that was how she felt, as if she, too, had been struck.But like the Space Needle, she would withstand this lightning bolt.The original Starbucks was directly across the street from the market, so they stopped in for a latte, decaf for her, and picked up a pound of cheese from a local cheesemaker, along with a loaf of bread and fresh green grapes.Well feast later, Roy promised.Once theyd deposited their goods in the car, Roy said, Okay, what next?With her mind in turmoil, Maggie couldnt think of a single thing to do.I  I dont know.Theres so much to choose from, Roy said, and looped his arm around her shoulders.Would you like to have lunch at the Space Needle?Do you think we could get a table without a reservation?Notwithstanding the very real possibility she wouldnt be able to hold food in her stomach.Good point.Roy turned toward the waterfront.The day was amazing.The sun was out, and the area was alive with activity.A boat pulled a parasailer, with a parachute the colors of the American flag.Sailboats sliced through the green waters of Puget Sound.White and green ferries hauled cars and passengers to a number of islands that dotted the Sound.A Ferris wheel was a recent addition, and the line of tourists waiting for a ride was amazingly long.What about a tour of Underground Seattle?Roy suggested.Seattle has an underground?Roy nodded.I read a brochure about it on the ferry.Apparently, Seattle had a large fire in 1890 and most of the buildings in town burned to the ground.When the city was rebuilt, the local government decided to elevate the waterfront area by one floor because of flooding problems with the change in tides.Maggie vaguely remembered reading about the Seattle fire years ago in her Washington State history class.And there are underground tours now?Thats what the brochure said.Still, Maggie wasnt sure.Is there anything to see  I mean, if the city burned down, what was left?I cant say, but I think it might be worth checking into, dont you?Sure, if thats what youd like to do, she said, but at this point she was willing to agree to anything in order to keep her husbands mind occupied.Roy could so easily read her that it wouldnt take much for him to realize that something was terribly wrong.Her husband pulled the brochure from his hip pocket and opened it across the hood of their vehicle for her to read.It says here that we purchase the tickets in Pioneer Square.The brochure also listed the times of the tours.Roy checked his watch.Well have plenty of time.Itll be fun just to walk around a bit and explore the city.It will, Maggie agreed.They headed in the direction of Pioneer Square.Roy was in a talkative mood.Maggie did her best to pay attention, but her mind drifted to what she was going to do about this pregnancy.Sooner or later, shed need to tell Roy.But when?If she held off as long as she could, she feared hed think of it as an even greater betrayal.If she let him know right away, it would ruin this newfound communication and recommitment to each other.After weeks of this horrible tension between them, Maggie yearned to hold on to his love and goodwill for as long as possible.What do you think?Roy asked.The first part of what her husband said was completely lost on her.Sorry, I didnt hear that.My goodness, Maggie, you seem preoccupied.Is everything all right?Its fine.Wonderful.She pasted on another big smile.Youre not feeling sick again, are you?Not in the least.Good.His leaned over and kissed her.Pioneer Square wasnt nearly as busy as the market or the waterfront area.Small cafs and restaurants outlined the square.That must be close to where the Seahawks play, Roy said, pointing toward CenturyLink Field.Im hoping to get us tickets for a game this year.Id like that, Maggie said.One day Ill take the boys.Give them a couple years so they can fully appreciate it.At the price of the tickets, plus the three hour drive from Yakima, it became an expensive weekend excursion.Theyll love it, Roy said.Now that the kids are five and three, its a whole new world.Before long, theyll both be in school.Lets not rush it, she said, thinking that there were more diapers in their future, only Roy didnt know it yet.And she wasnt about to mention the pregnancy now.You said not long ago that you might look for a part time position once Collin is in school.I will, Maggie said, and silently realized that that, too, would now be delayed for a few years.Unless she was forced to find a job in order to support herself  if she was no longer married.It was one thing to seek her husbands forgiveness for an indiscretion but another to expect him to love, accept, and raise a child that might not be his.A chill went down her arms at the thought of Roy leaving her.She swallowed a sob, which caught Roys attention.Sweetheart?She managed another phony smile.If she made it through this day without giving herself away, it would be a miracle.Are you sure youre feeling okay?he asked, looking concerned.Its just that Im a little overwhelmed by everything.He frowned, as if he found that hard to believe.They purchased the tickets for the Underground Seattle tour and then, because they had almost an hour to wait, Roy suggested they eat lunch.The restaurant he chose seemed to have a wide selection of entres.No more fish and chips for you, her husband teased.Im more in the mood for soup, Maggie said.Soup?her husband repeated, and seemed surprised.Then Maggie remembered that when she was pregnant with both boys the only thing shed been able to keep down the first few months was soup.It wouldnt take much for him to put two and two together.On second thought, the crab cakes sound good.They didnt, but she needed to steer him away from any suspicion that she might be pregnant.Somehow shed manage to keep the crab down.The waiter came for their order and Roy asked for a French dip.Oh dear, this was going to be difficult.The smell of cooked beef always caused her problems when she was pregnant.It might not have been as bad before she had proof positive, but every symptom shed ever suffered was sure to make itself apparent now.When she looked up, Maggie noticed the waiter was ready to take her order.The Dungeness crab cakes, she said.Excellent choice, he said, as he wrote it down and left them.Roys phone rang and he automatically reached for it.Maggie froze, fearing it was Katherine.She already knew that the other woman hadnt taken kindly to having their relationship abruptly severed and had tried a couple times to reach Roy.Who is it?she asked.His gaze met hers, and his look told Maggie that her suspicions were well grounded.Dont worry, Im not going to answer it.I thought you blocked her number.I did, but she isnt calling from her cell.This is the landline from her house.He pinched his lips together, revealing his disapproval.I dont know when shes going to get the message; were finished.Im sorry, sweetheart, but you know its over, right?Maggie believed him and then was left to wonder if her news would drive him back to Katherines more than willing arms.As soon as the call went to voice mail, Roy spent a few minutes on his phone, blocking the other womans home number.I dont want you to have a single doubt about my commitment to you, he said, reaching across the table and gripping hold of her fingers with his own.I feel better about us than I have in months.I dont know what I was thinking ever getting involved with her.Maggie looked away.Thank you for loving me, she whispered.Ill always love you, Maggie.I knew it when we were in college, which is one reason I wrote that letter.Im glad you kept it all these years.Me, too.I love you  Ill always love you, Roy.Always.No matter what happens in the future.Remember that, okay?Moisture filled her eyes and spilled down her cheeks before she could keep them at bay.Maggie quickly wiped the tears away.Look at me, getting all emotional, she said, attempting to laugh at herself.It seemed Roy was about to say something more when the waiter returned with their entres.Enjoy, he said.Maggie took one look at Roys sandwich and nearly gagged.If he noticed, he didnt say anything.Then, as if he hadnt eaten in weeks, Roy wolfed down his lunch while she picked at her crab cakes.The waiter noticed her lack of appetite when he came to clear away their plates.Was there something wrong with the entre, Miss?he asked.Maggie assured him with a quick shake of her head.I guess I wasnt as hungry as I thought.He removed her plate, and Maggie made a show of looking at her wrist.Its just about time for the tour, she said, more than grateful for the distraction.Roy stood and paid their tab.Then, together, they walked over to where a small group of tourists had assembled, awaiting the tour.The guide collected their tickets and then led them through a restaurant and down the stairs to the underground area.As Maggie suspected, there wasnt a whole lot to see, but the guide was full of stories regarding Seattles early history, telling anecdote after anecdote that had the group entertained and laughing.That was great, Maggie heard the woman in front of her comment as they left the tour.Really good, someone else said.What did you think?Maggie asked Roy.It was okay.Roy, it was wonderful.Like the others, Maggie had been amused and educated at the same time.And, bless her, the guide had helped Maggie keep her mind off how unsettled her stomach felt.I think its time we got back to the inn, Roy surprised her by suggesting.Are you sure?We still have time to visit the Seattle Center if you like.Another time, he said.Is that all right with you?Its fine; whatever you want.She didnt know why she protested.Getting back to the inn was exactly what she wanted.She yawned once, feeling like she needed a nap.If she fell asleep in the car on the drive back, Roy was sure to guess.She never took naps  unless she was sick or pregnant.They walked back to the parking lot, and she noticed that once more Roy reached for her hand the way he had earlier in the day.She chanced a look in his direction but couldnt read his thoughts.Testing the waters, she offered him a tentative smile.He smiled back.Her relief was instantaneous.She could keep her secret a little bit longer.What if I buy us a bottle of wine?Roy suggested.
