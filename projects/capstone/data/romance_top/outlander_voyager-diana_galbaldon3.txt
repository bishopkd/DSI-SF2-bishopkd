He patted the flat little back, and smoothed Willies hair, and murmured things in Gaelic that he hoped the boy would not understand.At length, he took the boys arms from his neck and put him gently away.Come wi me to my room, Willie; I shall give ye something to keep.He had long since moved from the hayloft, taking over Hughess snuggery beside the tack room when the elderly head groom retired.It was a small room, and very plainly furnished, but it had the twin virtues of warmth and privacy.Besides the bed, the stool, and a chamber pot, there was a small table, on which stood the few books that he owned, a large candle in a pottery candlestick, and a smaller candle, thick and squat, that stood to one side before a small statue of the Virgin.It was a cheap wooden carving that Jenny had sent him, but it had been made in France, and was not without artistry.Whats that little candle for?Willie asked.Grannie says only stinking Papists burn candles in front of heathen images.Well, I am a stinking Papist, Jamie said, with a wry twist of his mouth.Its no a heathen image, though; its a statue of the Blessed Mother.You are?Clearly this revelation only added to the boys fascination.Why do Papists burn candles before statues, then?Jamie rubbed a hand through his hair.Aye, well.Itsmaybe a way of prayingand remembering.Ye light the candle, and say a prayer and think of people ye care for.And while it burns, the flame remembers them for ye.Who do you remember?Willie glanced up at him.His hair was standing on end, rumpled by his earlier distress, but his blue eyes were clear with interest.Oh, a good many people.My family in the Highlandsmy sister and her family.Friends.My wife.And sometimes the candle burned in memory of a young and reckless girl named Geneva, but he did not say that.Willie frowned.You havent got a wife.No.Not anymore.But I remember her always.Willie put out a stubby forefinger and cautiously touched the little statue.The womans hands were spread in welcome, a tender maternity engraved on the lovely face.I want to be a stinking Papist, too, Willie said firmly.Ye canna do that!Jamie exclaimed, half amused, half touched at the notion.Your grandmama and your auntie would go mad.Would they froth at the mouth, like that mad fox you killed?Willie brightened.I shouldna wonder, Jamie said dryly.I want to do it!The small, clear features were set in determination.I wont tell Grannie or Auntie Isobel; I wont tell anybody.Please, Mac!Please let me!I want to be like you!Jamie hesitated, both touched by the boys earnestness, and suddenly wanting to leave his son with something more than the carved wooden horse he had made to leave as a farewell present.He tried to remember what Father McMurtry had taught them in the schoolroom about baptism.It was all right for a lay person to do it, he thought, provided that the situation was an emergency, and no priest was to hand.It might be stretching a point to call the present situation an emergency, buta sudden impulse made him reach down the jug of water that he kept on the sill.The eyes that were like his watched, wide and solemn, as he carefully brushed the soft brown hair back from the high brow.He dipped three fingers into the water and carefully traced a cross on the lads forehead.I baptize thee William James, he said softly, in the name o the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.Amen.Willie blinked, crossing his eyes as a drop of water rolled down his nose.He stuck out his tongue to catch it, and Jamie laughed, despite himself.Why did you call me William James?Willie asked curiously.My other names are Clarence Henry George.He made a face; Clarence wasnt his idea of a good name.Jamie hid a smile.Ye get a new name when youre baptized; James is your special Papist name.Its mine, too.It is?Willie was delighted.Im a stinking Papist now, like you?Aye, as much as I can manage, at least.He smiled down at Willie, then, struck by another impulse, reached into the neck of his shirt.Here.Keep this, too, to remember me by.He laid the beechwood rosary gently over Willies head.Ye canna let anyone see that, though, he warned.And for Gods sake, dinna tell anyone youre a Papist.I wont, Willie promised.Not a soul.He tucked the rosary into his shirt, patting carefully to be sure that it was hidden.Good.Jamie reached out and ruffled Willies hair in dismissal.Its almost time for your tea; yed best go on up to the house now.Willie started for the door, but stopped halfway, suddenly distressed again, with a hand pressed flat to his chest.You said to keep this to remember you.But I havent got anything for you to remember me by!Jamie smiled slightly.His heart was squeezed so tight, he thought he could not draw breath to speak, but he forced the words out.Dinna fret yourself, he said.Ill remember ye.17  MONSTERS RISING  Loch Ness   August 1968  Brianna blinked, brushing back a bright web of hair caught by the wind.Id almost forgotten what the sun looks like, she said, squinting at the object in question, shining with unaccustomed ferocity on the dark waters of Loch Ness.Her mother stretched luxuriously, enjoying the light wind.To say nothing of what fresh air is like.I feel like a toadstool thats been growing in the dark for weeksall pale and squashy.Fine scholars the two of you would make, Roger said, but grinned.All three of them were in high spirits.After the arduous slog through the prison records to narrow the search to Ardsmuir, they had had a run of luck.The records for Ardsmuir were complete, in one spot, andin comparison to most othersremarkably clear.Ardsmuir had been a prison for only fifteen years; following its renovation by Jacobite prison labor, it had been converted into a small permanent garrison, and the prison population dispersedmostly transported to the American Colonies.I still cant imagine why Fraser wasnt sent along to America with the rest, Roger said.He had had a moments panic there, going over and over the list of transported convicts from Ardsmuir, searching the names one by one, nearly letter by letter, and still finding no Frasers.He had been certain that Jamie Fraser had died in prison, and had been in a cold sweat of fear over the thought of telling the Randall womenuntil the flip of a page had showed him Frasers parole to a place named Helwater.I dont know, Claire said, but its a bloody good thing he wasnt.Heshe was she caught herself quickly, but not quickly enough to stop Roger noticing the slipterribly, terribly seasick.She gestured at the surface of the loch before them, dancing with tiny waves.Even going out on something like that would turn him green in minutes.Roger glanced at Brianna with interest.Are you seasick?She shook her head, bright hair lifting in the wind.Nah.She patted her bare midriff smugly.Cast iron.Roger laughed.Want to go out, then?Its your holiday, after all.Really?Could we?Can you fish in there?Brianna shaded her eyes, looking eagerly out over the dark water.Certainly.Ive caught salmon and eels many a time in Loch Ness, Roger assured her.Come along; well rent a wee boat at the dock in Drumnadrochit.The drive to Drumnadrochit was a delight.The day was one of those clear, bright summer days that cause tourists from the South to stampede into Scotland in droves during August and September.With one of Fionas larger breakfasts inside him, one of her lunches stowed in a basket in the boot, and Brianna Randall, long hair blowing in the wind, seated beside him, Roger was strongly disposed to consider that all was right with the world.He allowed himself to dwell with satisfaction on the results of their researches.It had meant taking additional leave from his college for the summer term, but it had been worth it.After finding the record of James Frasers parole, it had taken another two weeks of slog and inquiryeven a quick weekend trip by Roger and Bree to the Lake District, another by all three of them to Londonand then the sight that had made Brianna whoop out loud in the middle of the British Museums sacrosanct Reading Room, causing their hasty departure amid waves of icy disapproval.The sight of the Royal Warrant of Pardon, stamped with the seal of George III, Rex Angleterre, dated 1764, bearing the name of James Alexdrl MKensie Frazier.Were getting close, Roger had said, gloating over the photocopy of the Warrant of Pardon.Bloody close!Close?Brianna had said, but then had been distracted by the sight of their bus approaching, and had not pursued the matter.Roger had caught Claires eye on him, though; she knew very well what he meant.She would, of course, have been thinking of it; he wondered whether Brianna had.Claire had disappeared into the past in 1945, vanishing through the circle of standing stones on Craigh na Dun and reappearing in 1743.She had lived with Jamie Fraser for nearly three years, then returned through the stones.And she had come back nearly three years past the time of her original disappearance, in April of 1948.All of which meantjust possiblythat if she were disposed to try the trip back through the stones once more, she would likely arrive twenty years past the time she had leftin 1766.And 1766 was only two years past the latest known date at which Jamie Fraser had been located, alive and well.If he had survived another two years, and if Roger could find him  There it is!Brianna said suddenly.Boats for Rent.She pointed at the sign in the window of the dockside pub, and Roger nosed the car into a parking slot outside, with no further thought of Jamie Fraser.I wonder why short men are so often enamored of very tall women?Claires voice behind him echoed Rogers thoughts with an uncanny accuracyand not for the first time.Moth and flame syndrome, perhaps?Roger suggested, frowning at the diminutive barmans evident fascination with Brianna.He and Claire were standing before the counter for rentals, waiting for the clerk to write up the receipt while Brianna bought bottles of Coca Cola and brown ale to augment their lunch.The young barman, who came up approximately to Briannas armpit, was hopping to and fro, offering pickled eggs and slices of smoked tongue, eyes worshipfully upturned to the yellow haltered goddess before him.From her laughter, Brianna appeared to think the man cute.I always told Bree not to get involved with short men, Claire observed, watching this.Did you?Roger said dryly.Somehow I didnt envision you being all that much in the motherly advice line.She laughed, disregarding his momentary sourness.Well, Im not, all that much.When you notice an important principle like that, though, it seems ones motherly duty to pass it along.Something wrong with short men, is there?Roger inquired.They tend to turn mean if they dont get their way, Claire answered.Like small yapping dogs.Cute and fluffy, but cross them and youre likely to get a nasty nip in the ankle.Roger laughed.This observation is the result of years of experience, I take it?Oh, yes.She nodded, glancing up at him.Ive never met an orchestra conductor over five feet tall.Vicious specimens, practically all of them.But tall menher lips curved slightly as she surveyed his six feet three inch frametall men are almost always very sweet and gentle.Sweet, eh?said Roger, with a cynical glance at the barman, who was cutting up a jellied eel for Brianna.Her face expressed a wary distaste, but she leaned forward, wrinkling her nose as she took the bite offered on a fork.With women, Claire amplified.Ive always thought its because they realize that they dont have anything to prove; when its perfectly obvious that they can do anything they like whether you want them to or not, they dont need to try to prove it.While a short man Roger prompted.While a short one knows he cant do anything unless you let him, and the knowledge drives him mad, so hes always trying something on, just to prove he can.Mmphm.Roger made a Scottish noise in the back of his throat, meant to convey both appreciation of Claires acuity, and general suspicion of what the barman might be wanting to prove to Brianna.Thanks, he said to the clerk, who shoved the receipt across the counter to him.Ready, Bree?he asked.The loch was calm and the fishing slow, but it was pleasant on the water, with the August sun warm on their backs and the scent of raspberry canes and sun warmed pine trees wafting from the nearby shore.Full of lunch, they all grew drowsy, and before long, Brianna was curled up in the bow, asleep with her head pillowed on Rogers jacket.Claire sat in the stern, blinking, but still awake.What about short and tall women?Roger asked, resuming their earlier conversation as he sculled slowly across the loch.He glanced over his shoulder at the amazing length of Briannas legs, awkwardly curled under her.Same thing?The little ones nasty?Claire shook her head meditatively, the curls beginning to work their way loose from her hairclip.No, I dont think so.It doesnt seem to have anything to do with size.I think its more a matter of whether they see men as The Enemy, or just see them as men, and on the whole, rather like them for it.Oh, to do with womens liberation, is it?No, not at all, Claire said.I saw just the same kinds of behavior between men and women in 1743 that you see now.Some differences, of course, in how they each behave, but not so much in how they behave to each other.She looked out over the dark waters of the loch, shading her eyes with her hand.She might have been keeping an eye out for otters and floating logs, but Roger thought that far seeing gaze was looking a bit farther than the cliffs of the opposite shore.You like men, dont you?he said quietly.Tall men.She smiled briefly, not looking at him.One, she said softly.Will you go, thenif I can find him?he rested his oars momentarily, watching her.She drew a deep breath before answering.The wind flushed her cheeks with pink and molded the fabric of the white shirt to her figure, showing off a high bosom and a slender waist.Too young to be a widow, he thought, too lovely to be wasted.I dont know, she said, a little shakily.The thought of itor rather, the thoughts of it!On the one hand, to find Jamieand then, on the other, togo through again.A shudder went through her, closing her eyes.Its indescribable, you know, she said, eyes still closed as though she saw inside them the ring of stones on Craigh na Dun.Horrible, but horrible in a way that isnt like other horrible things, so you cant say.She opened her eyes and smiled wryly at him.A bit like trying to tell a man what having a baby is like; he can more or less grasp the idea that its painful, but he isnt equipped actually to understand what it feels like.Roger grunted with amusement.Oh, aye?Well, theres some difference, you know.Ive actually heard those bloody stones.He shivered himself, involuntarily.The memory of the night, three months ago, when Gillian Edgars had gone through the stones, was not one he willingly called to mind; it had come back to him in nightmares several times, though.He heaved strongly on the oars, trying to erase it.Like being torn apart, isnt it?he said, his eyes intent on hers.Theres something pulling at you, ripping, dragging, and not just outsideinside you as well, so you feel your skull will fly to pieces any moment.And the filthy noise.He shuddered again.Claires face had gone slightly pale.I didnt know you could hear them, she said.You didnt tell me.It didnt seem important.He studied her a moment, as he pulled, then added quietly, Bree heard them as well.I see.She turned to look back over the loch, where the wake of the tiny boat spread its V shaped wings.Far behind, the waves from the passage of a larger boat reflected back from the cliffs and joined again in the center of the loch, making a long, humped form of glistening watera standing wave, a phenomenon of the loch that had often been mistaken for a sighting of the monster.Its there, you know, she said suddenly, nodding down into the black, peat laden water.He opened his mouth to ask what she meant, but then realized that he did know.He had lived near Loch Ness for most of his life, fished for eels and salmon in its waters, and heardand laughed atevery story of the fearsome beastie that had ever been told in the pubs of Drumnadrochit and Fort Augustus.Perhaps it was the unlikeliness of the situationsitting here, calmly discussing whether the woman with him should or should not take the unimaginable risk of catapulting herself into an unknown past.Whatever the cause of his certainty, it seemed suddenly not only possible, but sure, that the dark water of the loch hid unknown but fleshly mystery.What do you think it is?he asked, as much to give his disturbed feelings time to settle, as out of curiosity.Claire leaned over the side, watching intently as a log drifted into view.The one I saw was probably a plesiosaur, she said at last.She didnt look at Roger, but kept her gaze astern.Though I didnt take notes at the time.Her mouth twisted in something not quite a smile.How many stone circles are there?she asked abruptly.In Britain, in Europe.Do you know?Not exactly.Several hundred, though, he answered cautiously.Do you think theyre all  How should I know?she interrupted impatiently.The point is, they may be.They were set up to mark something, which means there may be the hell of a lot of places where that something has happened.She tilted her head to one side, wiping the windblown hair out of her face, and gave him a lopsided smile.That would explain it, you know.Explain what?Roger felt fogged by the rapid shifts of her conversation.The monster.She gestured out over the water.What if theres another of thoseplacesunder the loch?A time corridorpassagewhatever?Roger looked out over the purling wake, staggered by the idea.It would explain a lot.There was a smile hiding at the corner of her mouth, behind the veil of blowing hair.He couldnt tell whether she was serious or not.The best candidates for monster are all things that have been extinct for hundreds of thousands of years.If theres a time passage under the loch, that would take care of that little problem.It would also explain why the reports are sometimes different, Roger said, becoming intrigued by the idea.If its different creatures who come through.And it would explain why the creatureor creatureshavent been caught, and arent seen all that often.Maybe they go back the other way, too, so they arent in the loch all the time.What a marvelous idea!Roger said.He and Claire grinned at each other.You know what?she said.Ill bet that isnt going to make it on the list of popular theories.Roger laughed, catching a crab, and droplets of water sprayed over Brianna.She snorted, sat up abruptly, blinking, then sank back down, face flushed with sleep, and was breathing heavily within seconds.She was up late last night, helping me box up the last set of records to go back to the University of Leeds, Roger said, defensive on her behalf.Claire nodded abstractedly, watching her daughter.Jamie could do that, she said softly.Lie down and sleep anywhere.She fell silent.Roger rowed steadily on, toward the point of the loch where the grim bulk of the ruins of Castle Urquhart stood amid its pines.The thing is, Claire said at last, it gets harder.Going through the first time was the most terrible thing Id ever had happen to me.Coming back was a thousand times worse.Her eyes were fixed on the looming castle.I dont know whether it was because I didnt come back on the right dayit was Beltane when I went, and two weeks before, when I came back.GeilieGillian, I meanshe went on Beltane, too.In spite of the heat of the day, Roger felt slightly cold, seeing again the figure of the woman who had been both his ancestor and his contemporary, standing in the light of a blazing bonfire, fixed for a moment in the light, before disappearing forever into the cleft of the standing stones.Thats what her notebook saidthat the door is open on the Sun Feasts and the Fire Feasts.Perhaps its only partly open as you near those times.Or perhaps she was wrong altogether; after all, she thought you had to have a human sacrifice to make it work.Claire swallowed heavily.The petrol soaked remains of Greg Edgars, Gillians husband, had been recovered from the stone circle by the police, on May Day.The record concluded of his wife only, Fled, whereabouts unknown.Claire leaned over the side, trailing a hand in the water.A small cloud drifted over the sun, turning the loch a sudden gray, with dozens of small waves rising on the surface as the light wind increased.Directly below, in the wake of the boat, the water was darkly impenetrable.Seven hundred feet deep is Loch Ness, and bitter cold.What can live in a place like that?Would you go down there, Roger?she asked softly.Jump overboard, dive in, go on down through that dark until your lungs were bursting, not knowing whether there are things with teeth and great heavy bodies waiting?Roger felt the hair on his arms rise, and not only because the sudden wind was chilly.But thats not all the question, she continued, still staring into the blank, mysterious water.Would you go, if Brianna were down there?She straightened up and turned to face him.Would you go?The amber eyes were intent on his, unblinking as a hawks.He licked his lips, chapped and dried by the wind, and cast a quick look over his shoulder at Brianna, sleeping.He turned back to face Claire.Yes.I think I would.She looked at him for a long moment, and then nodded, unsmiling.So would I.       PART FIVE    You Cant Go Home Again   18  ROOTS  September 1968  The woman next to me probably weighed three hundred pounds.She wheezed in her sleep, lungs laboring to lift the burden of her massive bosom for the two hundred thousandth time.Her hip and thigh and pudgy arm pressed against mine, unpleasantly warm and damp.There was no escape; I was pinned on the other side by the steel curve of the planes fuselage.I eased one arm upward and flicked on the overhead light in order to see my watch.Ten thirty, by London time; at least another six hours before the landing in New York promised escape.The plane was filled with the collective sighs and snorts of passengers dozing as best they might.Sleep for me was out of the question.With a sigh of resignation, I dug into the pocket in front of me for the half finished romance novel I had stashed there.The tale was by one of my favorite authors, but I found my attention slipping from the bookeither back to Roger and Brianna, whom I had left in Edinburgh, there to continue the hunt, or forward, to what awaited me in Boston.I wasnt sure just what did await me, which was part of the problem.I had been obliged to come back, if only temporarily; I had long since exhausted my vacation, plus several extensions.There were matters to be dealt with at the hospital, bills to be collected and paid at home, the maintenance of the house and yard to be attended toI shuddered to think what heights the lawn in the backyard must have attained by nowfriends to be called on  One friend in particular.Joseph Abernathy had been my closest friend, from medical school on.Before I made any finaland likely irrevocabledecisions, I wanted to talk to him.I closed the book in my lap and sat tracing the extravagant loops of the title with one finger, smiling a little.Among other things, I owed a taste for romance novels to Joe.I had known Joe since the beginning of my medical training.He stood out among the other interns at Boston General, just as I did.I was the only woman among the budding doctors; Joe was the only black intern.Our shared singularity gave us each a special awareness for the other; both of us sensed it clearly, though neither mentioned it.We worked together very well, but both of us were waryfor good reasonof exposing ourselves, and the tenuous bond between us, much too nebulous to be called friendship, remained unacknowledged until near the end of our internship.I had done my first unassisted surgery that dayan uncomplicated appendectomy, done on a teenaged boy in good health.It had gone well, and there was no reason to think there would be postoperative complications.Still, I felt an odd kind of possessiveness about the boy, and didnt want to go home until he was awake and out of Recovery, even though my shift had ended.I changed clothes and went to the doctors lounge on the third floor to wait.The lounge wasnt empty.Joseph Abernathy sat in one of the rump sprung stuffed chairs, apparently absorbed in a copy of U. S.  News & World Report.He looked up as I entered, and nodded briefly to me before returning to his reading.The lounge was equipped with stacks of magazinessalvaged from the waiting roomsand a number of tattered paperbacks, abandoned by departing patients.Seeking distraction, I thumbed past a six month old copy of Studies in Gastroenterology, a ragged copy of Time magazine, and a neat stack of Watchtower tracts.Finally picking up one of the books, I sat down with it.It had no cover, but the title page read The Impetuous Pirate.A sensuous, compelling love story, boundless as the Spanish Main!said the line beneath the title.The Spanish Main, eh?If escape was what I wanted, I couldnt do much better, I thought, and opened the book at random.It fell open automatically to page 42.Tipping up her nose scornfully, Tessa tossed her lush blond tresses back, oblivious to the fact that this caused her voluptuous breasts to become even more prominent in the low necked dress.Valdezs eyes widened at the sight, but he gave no outward sign of the effect such wanton beauty had on him.I thought that we might become better acquainted, Seorita, he suggested, in a low, sultry voice that made little shivers of anticipation run up and down Tessas back.I have no interest in becoming acquainted with aafilthy, despicable, underhanded pirate!she said.Valdezs teeth gleamed as he smiled at her, his hand stroking the handle of the dagger at his belt.He was impressed at her fearlessness; so bold, so impetuousand so beautiful.I raised an eyebrow, but went on reading, fascinated.With an air of imperious possession, Valdez swooped an arm about Tessas waist.You forget, Seorita, he murmured, the words tickling her sensitive earlobe, you are a prize of war; and the Captain of a pirate ship has first choice of the booty!Tessa struggled in his powerful arms as he bore her to the berth and tossed her lightly onto the jeweled coverlet.She struggled to catch her breath, watching in terror as he undressed, laying aside his azure blue velvet coat and then the fine ruffled white linen shirt.His chest was magnificent, a smooth expanse of gleaming bronze.Her fingertips ached to touch it, even though her heart pounded deafeningly in her ears as he reached for the waistband of his breeches.But no, he said, pausing.It is unfair of me to neglect you, Seorita.Allow me.With an irresistible smile, he bent and gently cupped Tessas breasts in the heated palms of his calloused hands, enjoying the voluptuous weight of them through the thin silken fabric.With a small scream, Tessa shrank away from his probing touch, pressing back against the lace embroidered feather pillow.You resist?What a pity to spoil such fine clothing, Seorita He took a firm grasp on her jade silk bodice and yanked, causing Tessas fine white breasts to leap out of their concealment like a pair of plump partridges taking wing.I made a sound, causing Dr.Abernathy to look sharply over the top of his U. S.  News & World Report.Hastily rearranging my face into a semblance of dignified absorption, I turned the page.Valdezs thick black curls swept her chest as he fastened his hot lips on Tessas rose pink nipples, making waves of anguished desire wash through her being.Weakened by the unaccustomed feelings that his ardor aroused in her, she was unable to move as his hand stealthily sought the hem of her gown and his blazing touch traced tendrils of sensation up the length of her slender thigh.Ah, mi amor, he groaned.So lovely, so pure.You drive me mad with desire, mi amor.I have wanted you since I first saw you, so proud and cold on the deck of your fathers ship.But not so cold now, my dear, eh?In fact, Valdezs kisses were wreaking havoc on Tessas feelings.How, how could she be feeling such things for this man, who had cold bloodedly sunk her fathers ship, and murdered a hundred men with his own hands?She should be recoiling in horror, but instead she found herself gasping for breath, opening her mouth to receive his burning kisses, arching her body in involuntary abandon beneath the demanding pressure of his burgeoning manhood.Ah, mi amor, he gasped.I cannot wait.ButI do not wish to hurt you.Gently, mi amor, gently.Tessa gasped as she felt the increasing pressure of his desire making its presence known between her legs.Oh!she said.Oh, please!You cant!I dont want you to![Fine time to start making protests, I thought. ]Dont worry, mi amor.Trust me.Gradually, little by little, she relaxed under the touch of his hypnotic caresses, feeling the warmth in her stomach grow and spread.His lips brushed her breast, and his hot breath, murmuring reassurances, took away all her resistance.As she relaxed, her thighs opened without her willing it.Moving with infinite slowness, his engorged shaft teased aside the membrane of her innocence  I let out a whoop and lost my grasp on the book, which slid off my lap and fell on the floor with a plop near Dr.Abernathys feet.Excuse me, I murmured, and bent to retrieve it, my face flaming.As I came up with The Impetuous Pirate in my sweaty grasp, though, I saw that far from preserving his usual austere mien, Dr.Abernathy was grinning widely.Let me guess, he said.Valdez just teased aside the membrane of her innocence?Yes, I said, breaking out into helpless giggling again.How did you know?Well, you werent too far into it, he said, taking the book from my hand.His short, blunt fingers flicked the pages expertly.It had to be that one, or maybe the one on page 73, where he laves her pink mounds with his hungry tongue.He what?See for yourself.He thrust the book back into my hands, pointing to a spot halfway down the page.Sure enough, lifting aside the coverlet, he bent his coal black head and laved her pink mounds with his hungry tongue.Tessa moaned and I gave an unhinged shriek.Youve actually read this?I demanded, tearing my eyes away from Tessa and Valdez.Oh, yeah, he said, the grin widening.He had a gold tooth, far back on the right side.Two or three times.Its not the best one, but it isnt bad.The best one?There are more like this?Sure.Lets see He rose and began digging through the pile of tattered paperbacks on the table.You want to look for the ones with no covers, he explained.Those are the best.And here I thought you never read anything but Lancet and the Journal of the AMA,I said.What, I spend thirty six hours up to my elbows in peoples guts, and I want to come up here and read Advances in Gallbladder Resection?Hell, noId rather sail the Spanish Main with Valdez.He eyed me with some interest, the grin still not quite gone.I didnt think you read anything but The New England Journal of Medicine, either, Lady Jane, he said.Appearances are deceiving, huh?Must be, I said dryly.Whats this Lady Jane?Oh, Hoechstein started that one, he said, leaning back with his fingers linked around one knee.Its the voice, that accent that sounds like you just drank tea with the Queen.Thats what youve got, keeps the guys from bein worse than they are.See, you sound like Winston Churchillif Winston Churchill was a lady, that isand that scares them a little.Youve got somethin else, thoughhe viewed me thoughtfully, rocking back in his chair.You have a way of talking like you expect to get your way, and if you dont, youll know the reason why.Whered you learn that?In the war, I said, smiling at his description.His eyebrows went up.Korea?No, I was a combat nurse during the Second World War; in France.I saw a lot of Head Matrons who could turn interns and orderlies to jelly with a glance.And later, I had had a good deal of practice, where that air of inviolate authorityassumed though it might behad stood me in good stead against people with a great deal more power than the nursing staff and interns of Boston General Hospital.He nodded, absorbed in my explanation.Yeah, that makes sense.I used Walter Cronkite, myself.Walter Cronkite?I goggled at him.He grinned again, showing his gold tooth.You can think of somebody better?Besides, I got to hear him for free on the radio or the TV every night.I used to entertain my mamashe wanted me to be a preacher.He smiled, half ruefully.If I talked like Walter Cronkite where we lived in those days, I wouldnt have lived to go to med school.I was liking Joe Abernathy more by the second.I hope your mother wasnt disappointed that you became a doctor intstead of a preacher.Tell you the truth, Im not sure, he said, still grinning.When I told her, she stared at me for a minute, then heaved a big sigh and said, Well, at least you can get my rheumatism medicine for me cheap.I laughed wryly.I didnt get that much enthusiasm when I told my husband I was going to be a doctor.He stared at me, and finally said if I was bored, why didnt I volunteer to write letters for the inmates of the nursing home.Joes eyes were a soft golden brown, like toffee drops.There was a glint of humor in them as they fixed on me.Yeah, folks still think its fine to say to your face that you cant be doing what youre doing.Why are you here, little lady, and not home minding your man and child?he mimicked.He grinned wryly, and patted my hand.Dont worry, theyll give it up sooner or later.They mostly dont ask me to my face anymore why I aint cleanin the toilets, like God made me to.Then the nurse had come with word that my appendix was awake, and I had left, but the friendship begun on page 42 had flourished, and Joe Abernathy had become one of my best friends; possibly the only person close to me who truly understood what I did, and why.I smiled a little, feeling the slickness of the embossing on the cover.Then I leaned forward and put the book back into the seat pocket.Perhaps I didnt want to escape just now.Outside, a floor of moonlit cloud cut us off from the earth below.Up here, everything was silent, beautiful and serene, in marked contrast to the turmoil of life below.I had the odd feeling of being suspended, motionless, cocooned in solitude, even the heavy breathing of the woman next to me only a part of the white noise that makes up silence, one with the tepid rush of the air conditioning and the shuffle of the stewardesses shoes along the carpet.At the same time, I knew we were rushing on inexorably through the air, propelled at hundreds of miles per hour to some endas for it being a safe one, we could only hope.I closed my eyes, in suspended animation.Back in Scotland, Roger and Bree were hunting Jamie.Ahead, in Boston, my joband Joewere waiting.And Jamie himself?I tried to push the thought away, determined not to think of him until the decision was made.I felt a slight ruffling of my hair, and one lock brushed against my cheek, light as a lovers touch.But surely it was no more than the rush of air from the vent overhead, and my imagination that the stale smells of perfume and cigarettes were suddenly underlaid by the scents of wool and heather.19  TO LAY A GHOST  Home at last, to the house on Furey Street, where I had lived with Frank and Brianna for nearly twenty years.The azaleas by the door were not quite dead, but their leaves hung in limp, shabby clusters, a thick layer of fallen leaves curling on the dry baked bed underneath.It was a hot summerthere wasnt any other kind in Bostonand the August rains hadnt come, even though it was mid September by now.I set my bags by the front door and went to turn on the hose.It had been lying in the sun; the green rubber snake was hot enough to burn my hand, and I shifted it uneasily from palm to palm until the rumble of water brought it suddenly alive and cooled it with a burst of spray.I didnt like azaleas all that much to start with.I would have pulled them out long since, but I had been reluctant to alter any detail of the house after Franks death, for Briannas sake.Enough of a shock, I thought, to begin university and have your father die in one year, without more changes.I had been ignoring the house for a long time; I could go on doing so.All right!I said crossly to the azaleas, as I turned off the hose.I hope youre happy, because thats all you get.I want to go have a drink myself.And a bath, I added, seeing their mud spattered leaves.I sat on the edge of the big sunken tub in my dressing gown, watching the water thunder in, churning the bubble bath into clouds of perfumed sea foam.Steam rose from the boiling surface; the water would be almost too hot.I turned it offone quick, neat twist of the tapand sat for a moment, the house around me still save for the crackle of popping bath bubbles, faint as the sounds of a far off battle.I realized perfectly well what I was doing.I had been doing it ever since I stepped aboard the Flying Scotsman in Inverness, and felt the thrum of the track come alive beneath my feet.I was testing myself.I had been taking careful note of the machinesall the contrivances of modern daily lifeand more important, of my own response to them.The train to Edinburgh, the plane to Boston, the taxicab from the airport, and all the dozens of tiny mechanical flourishes attendingvending machines, street lights, the planes mile high lavatory, with its swirl of nasty blue green disinfectant, whisking waste and germs away with the push of a button.Restaurants, with their tidy certificates from the Department of Health, guaranteeing at least a better than even chance of escaping food poisoning when eating therein.Inside my own house, the omnipresent buttons that supplied light and heat and water and cooked food.The question wasdid I care?I dipped a hand into the steaming bathwater and swirled it to and fro, watching the shadows of the vortex dancing in the marble depths.Could I live without all the conveniences, large and small, to which I was accustomed?I had been asking myself that with each touch of a button, each rumble of a motor, and was quite sure that the answer was yes.Time didnt make all the difference, after all; I could walk across the city and find people who lived without many of these conveniencesfarther abroad and there were entire countries where people lived in reasonable content and complete ignorance of electricity.For myself, I had never cared a lot.I had lived with my uncle Lamb, an eminent archaeologist, since my own parents death when I was five.Consequently, I had grown up in conditions that could conservatively be called primitive, as I accompanied him on all his field expeditions.Yes, hot baths and light bulbs were nice, but I had lived without them during several periods of my lifeduring the war, for instanceand never found the lack of them acute.The water had cooled enough to be tolerable.I dropped the dressing gown on the floor and stepped in, feeling a pleasant shiver as the heat at my feet made my shoulders prickle in cool contrast.I subsided into the tub and relaxed, stretching my legs.Eighteenth century hip baths were barely more than large barrels; one normally bathed in segments, immersing the center of the body first, with the legs hanging outside, then stood up and rinsed the upper torso while soaking the feet.More frequently, one bathed from a pitcher and basin, with the aid of a cloth.No, conveniences and comforts were merely that.Nothing essential, nothing I couldnt do without.Not that conveniences were the only issue, by a long chalk.The past was a dangerous country.But even the advances of so called civilization were no guarantee of safety.I had lived through two major modern warsactually served on the battlefields of one of themand could see another taking shape on the telly every evening.Civilized warfare was, if anything, more horrifying than its older versions.Daily life might be safer, but only if one chose ones walk in it with care.Parts of Roxbury now were as dangerous as any alley I had walked in the Paris of two hundred years past.I sighed and pulled up the plug with my toes.No use speculating about impersonal things like bathtubs, bombs, and rapists.Indoor plumbing was no more than a minor distraction.The real issue was the people involved, and always had been.Me, and Brianna, and Jamie.The last of the water gurgled away.I stood up, feeling slightly light headed, and wiped away the last of the bubbles.The big mirror was misted with steam, but clear enough to show me myself from the knees upward, pink as a boiled shrimp.Dropping the towel, I looked myself over.Flexed my arms, raised them overhead, checking for bagginess.None; biceps and triceps all nicely defined, deltoids neatly rounded and sloping into the high curve of the pectoralis major.I turned slightly to one side, tensing and relaxing my abdominalsobliques in decent tone, the rectus abdominis flattening almost to concavity.Good thing the family doesnt run to fat, I murmured.Uncle Lamb had remained trim and taut to the day of his death at seventy five.I supposed my fatherUncle Lambs brotherhad been constructed similarly, and wondered suddenly what my mothers backside had looked like.Women, after all, had a certain amount of excess adipose tissue to contend with.I turned all the way round and peered back over my shoulder at the mirror.The long columnar muscles of my back gleamed wetly as I twisted; I still had a waist, and a good narrow one, too.As for my own backsideWell, no dimples, anyway, I said aloud.I turned around and stared at my reflection.It could be a lot worse, I said to it.Feeling somewhat heartened, I put on my nightgown and went about the business of putting the house to bed.No cats to put out, no dogs to feedBozo, the last of our dogs, had died of old age the year before, and I had not wanted to get another, with Brianna off at school and my own hours at the hospital long and irregular.Adjust the thermostat, check the locks of windows and doors, see that the burners of the stove were off.That was all there was to it.For eighteen years, the nightly route had included a stop in Briannas room, but not since she had left for university.Moved by a mixture of habit and compulsion, I pushed open the door to her room and clicked on the light.Some people have the knack of objects, and others havent.Bree had it; scarcely an inch of wall space showed between the posters, photographs, dried flowers, scraps of tie dyed fabric, framed certificates and other impedimenta on the walls.Some people have a way of arranging everything about them, so the objects take on not only their own meaning, and a relation to the other things displayed with them, but something more besidesan indefinable aura that belongs as much to their invisible owner as to the objects themselves.I am here because Brianna placed me here, the things in the room seemed to say.I am here because she is who she is.It was odd that she should have that, really, I thought.Frank had had it; when I had gone to empty his university office after his death, I had thought it like the fossilized cast of some extinct animal; books and papers and bits of rubbish holding exactly the shape and texture and vanished weight of the mind that had inhabited the space.For some of Briannas objects, the relation to her was obviouspictures of me, of Frank, of Bozo, of friends.The scraps of fabric were ones she had made, her chosen patterns, the colors she likeda brilliant turquoise, deep indigo, magenta, and clear yellow.But other thingswhy should the scatter of dried freshwater snail shells on the bureau say to me Brianna?Why that one lump of rounded pumice, taken from the beach at Truro, indistinguishable from a hundred thousand othersexcept for the fact that she had taken it?I didnt have a way with objects.I had no impulse either to acquire or to decorateFrank had often complained of the Spartan furnishings at home, until Brianna grew old enough to take a hand.Whether it was the fault of my nomadic upbringing, or only the way I was, I lived mostly inside my skin, with no impulse to alter my surroundings to reflect me.Jamie was the same.He had had the few small objects, always carried in his sporran for utility or as talismans, and beyond that, had neither owned nor cared for things.Even during the short period when we had lived luxuriously in Paris, and the longer time of tranquillity at Lallybroch, he had never shown any disposition to acquire objects.For him as well, it might have been the circumstances of his early manhood, when he had lived like a hunted animal, never owning anything beyond the weapons he depended on for survival.But perhaps it was natural to him also, this isolation from the world of things, this sense of self sufficiencyone of the things that had made us seek completion in each other.Odd all the same, that Brianna should have so much resembled both her fathers, in their very different ways.I said a silent good night to the ghost of my absent daughter, and put out the light.The thought of Frank went with me into the bedroom.The sight of the big double bed, smooth and untroubled under its dark blue satin spread, brought him suddenly and vividly to mind, in a way I had not thought of him in many months.I supposed it was the possibility of impending departure that made me think of him now.This roomthis bed, in factwas where I had said goodbye to him for the last time.Cant you come to bed, Claire?Its past midnight.Frank looked up at me over the edge of his book.He was already in bed himself, reading with the book propped upon his knees.The soft pool of light from the lamp made him look as though he were floating in a warm bubble, serenely isolated from the dark chilliness of the rest of the room.It was early January, and despite the furnaces best efforts, the only truly warm place at night was bed, under heavy blankets.I smiled at him, and rose from my chair, dropping the heavy wool dressing gown from my shoulders.Am I keeping you up?Sorry.Just reliving this mornings surgery.Yes, I know, he said dryly.I can tell by looking at you.Your eyes glaze over and your mouth hangs open.Sorry, I said again, matching his tone.I cant be responsible for what my face is doing when Im thinking.But what good does thinking do?he asked, sticking a bookmark in his book.Youve done whatever you couldworrying about it now wont changeah, well.He shrugged irritably and closed the book.Ive said it all before.You have, I said shortly.I got into bed, shivering slightly, and tucked my gown down round my legs.Frank scooted automatically in my direction, and I slid down under the sheets beside him, huddling together to pool our warmth against the cold.Oh, wait; Ive got to move the phone.I flung back the covers and scrambled out again, to move the phone from Franks side of the bed to mine.He liked to sit in bed in the early evening, chatting with students and colleagues while I read or made surgical notes beside him, but he resented being wakened by the late calls that came from the hospital for me.Resented it enough that I had arranged for the hospital to call only for absolute emergencies, or when I left instructions to keep me informed of a specific patients progress.Tonight I had left instructions; it was a tricky bowel resection.If things went wrong, I might have to go back in in a hurry.Frank grunted as I turned out the light and slipped into bed again, but after a moment, he rolled toward me, throwing an arm across my middle.I rolled onto my side and curled against him, gradually relaxing as my chilled toes thawed.I mentally replayed the details of the operation, feeling again the chill at my feet from the refrigeration in the operating room and the initial, unsettling feeling of the warmth in the patients belly as my gloved fingers slid inside.The diseased bowel itself, coiled like a viper, patterned with the purple splotches of ecchymosis and the slow leakage of bright blood from tiny ruptures.Id been thinking.Franks voice came out of the darkness behind me, excessively casual.Mm?I was still absorbed in the vision of the surgery, but struggled to pull myself back to the present.About what?My sabbatical.His leave from the university was due to start in a month.He had planned to make a series of short trips through the northeastern United States, gathering material, then go to England for six months, returning to Boston to spend the last three months of the sabbatical writing.Id thought of going to England straight off, he said carefully.Well, why not?The weather will be dreadful, but if youre going to spend most of the time in libraries   I want to take Brianna with me.I stopped dead, the cold in the room suddenly coalescing into a small lump of suspicion in the pit of my stomach.She cant go now; shes only a semester from graduation.Surely you can wait until we can join you in the summer?Ive put in for a long vacation then, and perhaps   Im going now.For good.Without you.I pulled away and sat up, turning on the light.Frank lay blinking up at me, dark hair disheveled.It had gone gray at the temples, giving him a distinguished air that seemed to have alarming effects on the more susceptible of his female students.I felt quite astonishingly composed.Why now, all of a sudden?The latest one putting pressure on you, is she?The look of alarm that flashed into his eyes was so pronounced as to be comical.I laughed, with a noticeable lack of humor.You actually thought I didnt know?God, Frank!You are the mostoblivious man!He sat up in bed, jaw tight.I thought I had been most discreet.You may have been at that, I said sardonically.I counted six over the last ten yearsif there were really a dozen or so, then you were quite the model of discretion.His face seldom showed great emotion, but a whitening beside his mouth told me that he was very angry indeed.This one must be something special, I said, folding my arms and leaning back against the headboard in assumed casualness.But stillwhy the rush to go to England now, and why take Bree?She can go to boarding school for her last term, he said shortly.Be a new experience for her.Not one I expect she wants, I said.She wont want to leave her friends, especially not just before graduation.And certainly not to go to an English boarding school!I shuddered at the thought.I had come within inches of being immured in just such a school as a child; the scent of the hospital cafeteria sometimes evoked memories of it, complete with the waves of terrified helplessness I had felt when Uncle Lamb had taken me to visit the place.A little discipline never hurt anyone, Frank said.He had recovered his temper, but the lines of his face were still tight.Might have done you some good.He waved a hand, dismissing the topic.Let that be.Still, Ive decided to go back to England permanently.Ive a good position offered at Cambridge, and I mean to take it up.You wont leave the hospital, of course.But I dont mean to leave my daughter behind.Your daughter?I felt momentarily incapable of speech.So he had a new job all set, and a new mistress to go along.Hed been planning this for some time, then.A whole new lifebut not with Brianna.My daughter, he said calmly.You can come to visit whenever you like, of course   Youbloodybastard!I said.Do be reasonable, Claire.He looked down his nose, giving me Treatment A, long suffering patience, reserved for students appealing failing grades.Youre scarcely ever home.If Im gone, there will be no one to look after Bree properly.You talk as though shes eight, not almost eighteen!For heavens sake, shes nearly grown.All the more reason she needs care and supervision, he snapped.If youd seen what Id seen at the universitythe drinking, the drugging, the   I do see it, I said through my teeth.At fairly close range in the emergency room.Bree is not likely to   She damn well is!Girls have no sense at that ageshell be off with the first fellow who   Dont be idiotic!Brees very sensible.Besides, all young people experiment, thats how they learn.You cant keep her swaddled in cotton wool all her life.Better swaddled than fucking a black man!he shot back.A mottled red showed faintly over his cheekbones.Like mother, like daughter, eh?But thats not how its going to be, damn it, not if Ive anything to say about it!I heaved out of bed and stood up, glaring down at him.You, I said, have not got one bloody, filthy, stinking thing to say, about Bree or anything else!I was trembling with rage, and had to press my fists into the sides of my legs to keep from striking him.You have the absolute, unmitigated gall to tell me that you are leaving me to live with the latest of a succession of mistresses, and then imply that I have been having an affair with Joe Abernathy?That is what you mean, isnt it?He had the grace to lower his eyes slightly.Everyone thinks you have, he muttered.You spend all your time with the man.Its the same thing, so far as Bree is concerned.Dragging her intosituations, where shes exposed to danger, andand to those sorts of people   Black people, I suppose you mean?I damn well do, he said, looking up at me with eyes flashing.Its bad enough to have the Abernathys to parties all the time, though at least hes educated.But that obese person I met at their house with the tribal tattoos and the mud in his hair?That repulsive lounge lizard with the oily voice?And young Abernathys taken to hanging round Bree day and night, taking her to marches and rallies and orgies in low dives   I shouldnt think there are any high dives, I said, repressing an inappropriate urge to laugh at Franks unkind but accurate assessment of two of Leonard Abernathys more outr friends.Did you know Lennys taken to calling himself Muhammad Ishmael Shabazz now?Yes, he told me, he said shortly, and I am taking no risk of having my daughter become Mrs.Shabazz.I dont think Bree feels that way about Lenny, I assured him, struggling to suppress my irritation.She isnt going to, either.Shes going to England with me.Not if she doesnt want to, I said, with great finality.No doubt feeling that his position put him at a disadvantage, Frank climbed out of bed and began groping for his slippers.I dont need your permission to take my daughter to England, he said.And Brees still a minor; shell go where I say.Id appreciate it if youd find her medical records; the new school will need them.Your daughter?I said again.I vaguely noticed the chill in the room, but was so angry that I felt hot all over.Brees my daughter, and youll take her bloody nowhere!You cant stop me, he pointed out, with aggravating calmness, picking up his dressing gown from the foot of the bed.The hell I cant, I said.You want to divorce me?Fine.Use any grounds you likewith the exception of adultery, which you cant prove, because it doesnt exist.But if you try to take Bree away with you, Ill have a thing or two to say about adultery.Do you want to know how many of your discarded mistresses have come to see me, to ask me to give you up?His mouth hung open in shock.I told them all that Id give you up in a minute, I said, if you asked.I folded my arms, tucking my hands into my armpits.I was beginning to feel the chilliness again.I did wonder why you never askedbut I supposed it was because of Brianna.His face had gone quite bloodless now, and showed white as a skull in the dimness on the other side of the bed.Well, he said, with a poor attempt at his usual self possession, I shouldnt have thought you minded.Its not as though you ever made a move to stop me.I stared at him, completely taken aback.Stop you?I said.What should I have done?Steamed open your mail and waved the letters under your nose?Made a scene at the faculty Christmas party?Complained to the Dean?His lips pressed tight together for a moment, then relaxed.You might have behaved as though it mattered to you, he said quietly.It mattered.My voice sounded strangled.He shook his head, still staring at me, his eyes dark in the lamplight.Not enough.He paused, face floating pale in the air above his dark dressing gown, then came round the bed to stand by me.Sometimes I wondered if I could rightfully blame you, he said, almost thoughtfully.He looked like Bree, didnt he?He was like her?Yes.He breathed heavily, almost a snort.I could see it in your facewhen youd look at her, I could see you thinking of him.Damn you, Claire Beauchamp, he said, very softly.Damn you and your face that cant hide a thing you think or feel.There was a silence after this, of the sort that makes you hear all the tiny unbearable noises of creaking wood and breathing housesonly in an effort to pretend you havent heard what was just said.I did love you, I said softly, at last.Once.Once, he echoed.Should I be grateful for that?The feeling was beginning to come back to my numb lips.I did tell you, I said.And then, when you wouldnt goFrank, I did try.Whatever he heard in my voice stopped him for a moment.I did, I said, very softly.He turned away and moved toward my dressing table, where he touched things restlessly, picking them up and putting them down at random.I couldnt leave you at the firstpregnant, alone.Only a cad would have done that.And thenBree.He stared sightlessly at the lipstick he held in one hand, then set it gently back on the glassy tabletop.I couldnt give her up, he said softly.He turned to look at me, eyes dark holes in a shadowed face.Did you know I couldnt sire a child?Ihad myself tested, a few years ago.Im sterile.Did you know?I shook my head, not trusting myself to speak.Bree is mine, my daughter, he said, as though to himself.The only child Ill ever have.I couldnt give her up.He gave a short laugh.I couldnt give her up, but you couldnt see her without thinking of him, could you?Without that constant memory, I wonderwould you have forgotten him, in time?No.The whispered word seemed to go through him like an electric shock.He stood frozen for a moment, then whirled to the closet and began to jerk on his clothes over his pajamas.I stood, arms wrapped around my body, watching as he pulled on his overcoat and stamped out of the room, not looking at me.The collar of his blue silk pajamas stuck up over the astrakhan trim of his coat.A moment later, I heard the closing of the front doorhe had sufficient presence of mind not to slam itand then the sound of a cold motor turning reluctantly over.The headlights swept across the bedroom ceiling as the car backed down the drive, and then were gone, leaving me shaking by the rumpled bed.Frank didnt come back.I tried to sleep, but found myself lying rigid in the cold bed, mentally reliving the argument, listening for the crunch of his tires in the drive.At last, I got up and dressed, left a note for Bree, and went out myself.The hospital hadnt called, but I might as well go and have a look at my patient; it was better than tossing and turning all night.And, to be honest, I would not have minded had Frank come home to find me gone.The streets were slick as butter, black ice gleaming in the streetlights.The yellow phosphor glow lit whorls of falling snow; within an hour, the ice that lined the streets would be concealed beneath fresh powder, and twice as perilous to travel.The only consolation was that there was no one on the streets at 4:00 A. M.  to be imperiled.No one but me, that is.Inside the hospital, the usual warm, stuffy institutional smell wrapped itself round me like a blanket of familiarity, shutting out the snow filled black night outside.Hes okay, the nurse said to me softly, as though a raised voice might disturb the sleeping man.All the vitals are stable, and the counts okay.No bleeding.I could see that it was true; the patients face was pale, but with a faint undertone of pink, like the veining in a white rose petal, and the pulse in the hollow of his throat was strong and regular.I let out the deep breath I hadnt realized I was holding.Thats good, I said.Very good.The nurse smiled warmly at me, and I had to resist the impulse to lean against him and dissolve.The hospital surroundings suddenly seemed like my only refuge.There was no point in going home.I checked briefly on my remaining patients, and went down to the cafeteria.It still smelled like a boarding school, but I sat down with a cup of coffee and sipped it slowly, wondering what I would tell Bree.It might have been a half hour later when one of the ER nurses hurried through the swinging doors and stopped dead at the sight of me.Then she came on, quite slowly.I knew at once; I had seen doctors and nurses deliver the news of death too often to mistake the signs.Very calmly, feeling nothing whatever, I set down the almost full cup, realizing as I did so that for the rest of my life, I would remember that there was a chip in the rim, and that the B of the gold lettering on the side was almost worn away.said you were here.Identification in his walletpolice saidsnow on black ice, a skidDOA the nurse was talking, babbling, as I strode through the bright white halls, not looking at her, seeing the faces of the nurses at the station turn toward me in slow motion, not knowing, but seeing from a glance at me that something final had happened.He was on a gurney in one of the emergency room cubicles; a spare, anonymous space.There was an ambulance parked outsideperhaps the one that had brought him here.The double doors at the end of the corridor were open to the icy dawn.The ambulances red light was pulsing like an artery, bathing the corridor in blood.I touched him briefly.His flesh had the inert, plastic feel of the recently dead, so at odds with the lifelike appearance.There was no wound visible; any damage was hidden beneath the blanket that covered him.His throat was smooth and brown; no pulse moved in its hollow.I stood there, my hand on the motionless curve of his chest, looking at him, as I had not looked for some time.A strong and delicate profile, sensitive lips, and a chiseled nose and jaw.A handsome man, despite the lines that cut deep beside his mouth, lines of disappointment and unspoken anger, lines that even the relaxation of death could not wipe away.I stood quite still, listening.I could hear the wail of a new ambulance approaching, voices in the corridor.The squeak of gurney wheels, the crackle of a police radio, and the soft hum of a fluorescent light somewhere.I realized with a start that I was listening for Frank, expectingwhat?That his ghost would be hovering still nearby, anxious to complete our unfinished business?I closed my eyes, to shut out the disturbing sight of that motionless profile, going red and white and red in turn as the light throbbed through the open doors.Frank, I said softly, to the unsettled, icy air, if youre still close enough to hear meI did love you.Once.I did.Then Joe was there, pushing through the crowded corridor, face anxious over his green scrub suit.He had come straight from surgery; there was a small spray of blood across the lenses of his glasses, a smear of it on his chest.Claire, he said, God, Claire!and then I started to shake.In ten years, he had never called me anything but Jane or L. J.  If he was using my name, it must be real.My hand showed startlingly white in Joes dark grasp, then red in the pulsing light, and then I had turned to him, solid as a tree trunk, rested my head on his shoulder, andfor the first timewept for Frank.I leaned my face against the bedroom window of the house on Furey Street.It was hot and humid on this blue September evening, filled with the sound of crickets and lawn sprinklers.What I saw, though, was the uncompromising black and white of that winters night two years beforeblack ice and the white of hospital linen, and then the blurring of all judgments in the pale gray dawn.My eyes blurred now, remembering the anonymous bustle in the corridor and the pulsing red light of the ambulance that had washed the silent cubicle in bloody light, as I wept for Frank.Now I wept for him for the last time, knowing even as the tears slid down my cheeks that we had parted, once and for all, twenty odd years before, on the crest of a green Scottish hill.My weeping done, I rose and laid a hand on the smooth blue coverlet, gently rounded over the pillow on the leftFranks side.Goodbye, my dear, I whispered, and went out to sleep downstairs, away from the ghosts.It was the doorbell that woke me in the morning, from my makeshift bed on the sofa.Telegram, mama, the messenger said, trying not to stare at my nightgown.Those small yellow envelopes have probably been responsible for more heart attacks than anything besides fatty bacon for breakfast.My own heart squeezed like a fist, then went on beating in a heavy, uncomfortable manner.I tipped the messenger and carried the telegram down the hall.It seemed important not to open it until I had reached the relative safety of the bathroom, as though it were an explosive device that must be defused under water.My fingers shook and fumbled as I opened it, sitting on the edge of the tub, my back pressed against the tiled wall for reinforcement.It was a brief messageof course, a Scot would be thrifty with words, I thought absurdly.HAVE FOUND HIM STOP, it read.WILL YOU COME BACK QUERY ROGER.I folded the telegram neatly and put it back into its envelope.I sat there and stared at it for quite a long time.Then I stood up and went to dress.20  DIAGNOSIS  Joe Abernathy was seated at his desk, frowning at a small rectangle of pale cardboard he held in both hands.Whats that?I said, sitting on the edge of his desk without ceremony.A business card.He handed the card to me, looking at once amused and irritated.It was a pale gray laid finish card; expensive stock, fastidiously printed in an elegant serif type.Muhammad Ishmael Shabazz III, the center line read, with address and phone number below.Lenny?I asked, laughing.Muhammad Ishmael Shabazz the third?Uh huh.Amusement seemed to be getting the upper hand.The gold tooth flashed briefly as he took the card back.He says hes not going to take a white mans name, no slave name.Hes going to reclaim his African heritage, he said sardonically.All right, I say; I ask him, you gonna go round with a bone through your nose next thing?Its not enough hes got his hair out to herehe gestured, fluffing his hands on either side of his own close cropped headand hes going round in a thing down to his knees, looks like his sister made it in Home Ec class.No, Lennyexcuse me, Muhammadhes got to be African all the way.Joe waved a hand out the window, at his privileged vista over the park.I tell him, look around, man, you see any lions?This look like Africa to you?He leaned back in his padded chair, stretching out his legs.He shook his head in resignation.Theres no talkin to a boy that age.True, I said.But whats this third about?A reluctant gleam of gold answered me.Well, he was talking all about his lost tradition and his missing history and all.He says, How am I going to hold my head up, face to face with all these guys I meet at Yale named Cadwallader IV and Sewell Lodge, Jr., and I dont even know my own grandaddys name, I dont know where I come from?Joe snorted.I told him, you want to know where you come from, kid, look in the mirror.Wasnt the Mayflower, huh?He picked up the card again, a reluctant grin on his face.So he says, if hes taking back his heritage, why not take it back all the way?If his grandaddy wouldnt give him a name, hell give his grandaddy one.And the only trouble with that, he said, looking up at me under a cocked brow, is that it kind of leaves me man in the middle.Now I have to be Muhammad Ishmael Shabazz, Junior, so Lenny can be a proud African American.He thrust himself back from the desk, chin on his chest, staring balefully at the pale gray card.Youre lucky, L. J. , he said.At least Bree isnt giving you grief about who her granddaddy was.All you have to worry about is will she be doing dope and getting pregnant by some draft dodger who takes off for Canada.I laughed, with more than a touch of irony.Thats what you think, I told him.Yeah?He cocked an interested eyebrow at me, then took off his gold rimmed glasses and wiped them on the end of his tie.So how was Scotland?he asked, eyeing me.Bree like it?Shes still there, I said.Looking for her history.Joe was opening his mouth to say something when a tentative knock on the door interrupted him.Dr.Abernathy?A plump young man in a polo shirt peered doubtfully into the office, leaning over the top of a large cardboard box he held clutched to his substantial abdomen.Call me Ishmael, Joe said genially.What?The young mans mouth hung slightly open, and he glanced at me in bewilderment, mingled with hope.Are you Dr.Abernathy?No, I said, he is, when he puts his mind to it.I rose from the desk, brushing down my skirts.Ill leave you to your appointment, Joe, but if you have time later  No, stay a minute, L.  J. , he interrupted, rising.He took the box from the young man, then shook his hand formally.Youd be Mr.Thompson?John Wicklow called to tell me youd be coming.Pleased to meet you.Horace Thompson, yes, the young man said, blinking slightly.I brought, er, a specimen He waved vaguely at the cardboard box.Yes, thats right.Id be happy to look at it for you, but I think Dr.Randall here might be of assistance, too.He glanced at me, the glint of mischief in his eyes.I just want to see can you do it to a dead person, L.  J.   Do what to a dead I began, when he reached into the opened box and carefully lifted out a skull.Oh, pretty, he said in delight, turning the object gently to and fro.Pretty was not the first adjective that struck me; the skull was stained and greatly discolored, the bone gone a deep streaky brown.Joe carried it to the window and held it in the light, his thumbs gently stroking the small bony ridges over the eye sockets.Pretty lady, he said softly, talking as much to the skull as to me or Horace Thompson.Full grown, mature.Maybe late forties, middle fifties.Do you have the legs?he asked, turning abruptly to the plump young man.Yeah, right here, Horace Thompson assured him, reaching into the box.We have the whole body, in fact.Horace Thompson was probably someone from the coroners office, I thought.Sometimes they brought bodies to Joe that had been found in the countryside, badly deteriorated, for an expert opinion as to the cause of death.This one looked considerably deteriorated.Here, Dr.Randall.Joe leaned over and carefully placed the skull in my hands.Tell me whether this lady was in good health, while I check her legs.Me?Im not a forensic scientist.Still, I glanced automatically down.It was either an old specimen, or had been weathered extensively; the bone was smooth, with a gloss that fresh specimens never had, stained and discolored by the leaching of pigments from the earth.Oh, all right.I turned the skull slowly in my hands, watching the bones, naming them each in my mind as I saw them.The smooth arch of the parietals, fused to the declivity of the temporal, with the small ridge where the jaw muscle originated, the jutting projection that meshed itself with the maxillary into the graceful curve of the squamosal arch.She had had lovely cheekbones, high and broad.The upper jaw had most of its teethstraight and white.Deep eyes.The scooped bone at the back of the orbits was dark with shadow; even by tilting the skull to the side, I couldnt get light to illuminate the whole cavity.The skull felt light in my hands, the bone fragile.I stroked her brow and my hand ran upward, and down behind the occiput, my fingers seeking the dark hole at the base, the foremen magnum, where all the messages of the nervous system pass to and from the busy brain.Then I held it close against my stomach, eyes closed, and felt the shifting sadness, filling the cavity of the skull like running water.And an odd faint senseof surprise?Someone killed her, I said.She didnt want to die.I opened my eyes to find Horace Thompson staring at me, his own eyes wide in his round, pale face.I handed him the skull, very gingerly.Where did you find her?I asked.Mr.Thompson exchanged glances with Joe, then looked back at me, both eyebrows still high.Shes from a cave in the Caribbean, he said.There were a lot of artifacts with her.We think shes maybe between a hundred fifty and two hundred years old.Shes what?Joe was grinning broadly, enjoying his joke.Our friend Mr.Thompson here is from the anthropology department at Harvard, he said.His friend Wicklow knows me; asked me would I have a look at this skeleton, to tell them what I could about it.The nerve of you!I said indignantly.I thought she was some unidentified body the coroners office dragged in.Well, shes unidentified, Joe pointed out.And certainly liable to stay that way.He rooted about in the cardboard box like a terrier.The end flap said PICT SWEET CORN.Now what have we got here?he said, and very carefully drew out a plastic sack containing a jumble of vertebrae.She was in pieces when we got her, Horace explained.Oh, de headbone connected to deneckbone, Joe sang softly, laying out the vertebrae along the edge of the desk.His stubby fingers darted skillfully among the bones, nudging them into alignment.De neckbone connected to debackbone  Dont pay any attention to him, I told Horace.Youll just encourage him.Now hearde wordof de Lawd!he finished triumphantly.Jesus Christ, L.  J. , youre somethin else!Look here.Horace Thompson and I bent obediently over the line of spiky vertebral bones.The wide body of the axis had a deep gouge; the posterior zygapophysis had broken clean off, and the fracture plane went completely through the centrum of the bone.A broken neck?Thompson asked, peering interestedly.Yeah, but more than that, I think.Joes finger moved over the line of the fracture plane.See here?The bones not just cracked, its gone right there.Somebody tried to cut this ladys head clean off.With a dull blade, he concluded with relish.Horace Thompson was looking at me queerly.How did you know shed been killed, Dr.Randall?he asked.I could feel the blood rising in my face.I dont know, I said.Ishefelt like it, thats all.Really?He blinked a few times, but didnt press me further.How odd.She does it all the time, Joe informed him, squinting at the femur he was measuring with a pair of calipers.Mostly on live people, though.Best diagnostician I ever saw.He set down the calipers and picked up a small plastic ruler.A cave, you said?We think it was aer, secret slave burial, Mr.Thompson explained, blushing, and I suddenly realized why he had seemed so abashed when he realized which of us was the Dr.Abernathy he had been sent to see.Joe shot him a sudden sharp glance, but then bent back to his work.He kept humming Dem Dry Bones faintly to himself as he measured the pelvic inlet, then went back to the legs, this time concentrating on the tibia.Finally he straightened up, shaking his head.Not a slave, he said.Horace blinked.But she must have been, he said.The things we found with hera clear African influence  No, Joe said flatly.He tapped the long femur, where it rested on his desk.His fingernail clicked on the dry bone.She wasnt black.You can tell that?From bones?Horace Thompson was visibly agitated.But I thoughtthat paper by Jensen, I meantheories about racial physical differenceslargely exploded He blushed scarlet, unable to finish.Oh, theyre there, said Joe, very dryly indeed.If you want to think blacks and whites are equal under the skin, be my guest, but it aint scientifically so.He turned and pulled a book from the shelf behind him.Tables of Skeletal Variance, the title read.Take a look at this, Joe invited.You can see the differences in a lot of bones, but especially in the leg bones.Blacks have a completely different femur to tibia ratio than whites do.And that ladyhe pointed to the skeleton on his deskwas white.Caucasian.No question about it.Oh, Horace Thompson murmured.Well.Ill have to thinkI meanit was very kind of you to look at her for me.Er, thank you, he added, with an awkward little bow.We silently watched him bundle his bones back into the PICT SWEET box, and then he was gone, pausing at the door to give us both another brief bob of the head.Joe gave a short laugh as the door closed behind him.Want to bet he takes her down to Rutgers for a second opinion?Academics dont give up theories easily, I said, shrugging.I lived with one long enough to know that.Joe snorted again.So you did.Well, now that weve got Mr.Thompson and his dead white lady sorted out, what can I do for you, L.  J. ?I took a deep breath and turned to face him.I need an honest opinion, from somebody I can depend on to be objective.No, I amended, I take that back.I need an opinion and thendepending on the opinionmaybe a favor.No problem, Joe assured me.Especially the opinion.My specialty, opinions.He rocked back in his chair, unfolded his gold rimmed glasses and set them firmly atop his broad nose.Then he folded his hands across his chest, fingers steepled, and nodded at me.Shoot.Am I sexually attractive?I demanded.His eyes always reminded me of coffee drops, with their warm golden brown color.Now they went completely round, enhancing the resemblance.Then they narrowed, but he didnt answer immediately.He looked me over carefully, head to toe.Its a trick question, right?he said.I give you an answer and one of those womens libbers jumps out from behind the door, yells Sexist pig!And hits me over the head with a sign that says Castrate Male Chauvinists.Huh?No, I assured him.A sexist male chauvinist answer is basically what I want.Oh, okay.As long as were straight, then.He resumed his perusal, squinting closely as I stood up straight.Skinny white broad with too much hair, but a great ass, he said at last.Nice tits, too, he added, with a cordial nod.That what you want to know?Yes, I said, relaxing my rigid posture.Thats exactly what I wanted to know.It isnt the sort of question you can ask just anybody.He pursed his lips in a silent whistle, then threw back his head and roared with delight.Lady Jane!Youve got you a man!I felt the blood rising in my cheeks, but tried to keep my dignity.I dont know.Maybe.Just maybe.Maybe, hell!Jesus Christ on a piece of toast, L.  J. , its about time!Kindly quit cackling, I said, lowering myself into his visitors chair.It doesnt become a man of your years and station.My years?Oho, he said, peering shrewdly at me through the glasses.Hes younger than you?Thats what youre worried about?Not a lot, I said, the blush beginning to recede.But I havent seen him in twenty years.Youre the only person I know whos known me for a long time; have I changed terribly since we met?I looked at him straight on, demanding honesty.He looked at me, took off his glasses and squinted, then replaced them.No, he said.You wouldnt, though, unless you got fat.I wouldnt?Nah.Ever been to your high school reunion?I didnt go to a high school.His sketchy brows flicked upward.No?Well, I have.And I tell you what, L. J. ; you see all these people you havent seen for twenty years, and theres this split second when you meet somebody you used to know, when you think, My God, hes changed!, and then all of a sudden, he hasntits just like the twenty years werent there.I meanhe rubbed his head vigorously, struggling for meaningyou see theyve got some gray, and some lines, and maybe they arent just the same as they were, but two minutes past that shock, and you dont see it anymore.Theyre just the same people they always were, and you have to make yourself stand back a ways to see that they arent eighteen anymore.Now, if people get fat, he said meditatively, they change some.Its harder to see who they were, because the faces change.But youhe squinted at me againyoure never going to be fat; you dont have the genes for it.I suppose not, I said.I looked down at my hands, clasped together in my lap.Slender wristbones; at least I wasnt fat yet.My rings gleamed in the autumn sun from the window.Is it Brees daddy?he asked softly.I jerked my head up and stared at him.How the hell did you know that?I said.He smiled slightly.Ive known Bree how long?Ten years, at least.He shook his head.Shes got a lot of you in her, L.  J. , but Ive never seen anything of Frank.Daddys got red hair, huh?he asked.And hes one big son of a bitch, or everything I learned in Genetics 101 was a damn lie.Yes, I said, and felt a kind of delirious excitement at that simple admission.Until I had told Bree herself and Roger about Jamie, I had said nothing about him for twenty years.The joy of suddenly being able to talk freely about him was intoxicating.Yes, hes big and red haired, and hes Scottish, I said, making Joes eyes go round once more.And Brees in Scotland now?I nodded.Bree is where the favor comes in.Two hours later, I left the hospital for the last time, leaving behind me a letter of resignation, addressed to the Hospital Board, all the necessary documents for the handling of my property until Brianna should be of age, and another one, to be executed at that time, turning everything over to her.As I drove out of the parking lot, I experienced a feeling of mingled panic, regret, and elation.I was on my way.21  Q. E. D  Inverness   October 5, 1968  I found the deed of sasine.Rogers face was flushed with excitement.He had hardly been able to contain himself, waiting with open impatience at the train station in Inverness while Brianna hugged me and my bags were retrieved.He had barely got us stuffed into his tiny Morris and the cars ignition started before blurting out his news.What, for Lallybroch?I leaned over the seat back between him and Brianna, in order to hear him over the noise of the motor.Yes, the one Jamieyour Jamiewrote, deeding the property to his nephew, the younger Jamie.Its at the manse, Brianna put in, twisting to look at me.We were afraid to bring it with us; Roger had to sign his name in blood to get it out of the SPA collection.Her fair skin was pinkened by excitement and the chilly day, raindrops in her ruddy hair.It was always a shock to me to see her again after an absencemothers always think their children beautiful, but Bree really was.I smiled at her, glowing with affection tinged with panic.Could I really be thinking of leaving her?Mistaking the smile for one of pleasure in the news, she went on, gripping the back of the seat in excitement.And youll never guess what else we found!What you found, Roger corrected, squeezing her knee with one hand as he negotiated the tiny orange car through a roundabout.She gave him a quick glance and a reciprocal touch with an air of intimacy about it that set off my maternal alarm bells on the spot.Like that already, was it?I seemed to feel Franks shade glaring accusingly over my shoulder.Well, at least Roger wasnt black.I coughed and said, Really?What is it?They exchanged a glance and grinned widely at each other.Wait and see, Mama, said Bree, with irritating smugness.See?she said, twenty minutes later, as I bent over the desk in the manses study.On the battered surface of the late Reverend Wakefields desk lay a sheaf of yellowed papers, foxed and browned at the edges.They were carefully enclosed in protective plastic covers now, but obviously had been carelessly used at one time; the edges were tattered, one sheet was torn roughly in half, and all the sheets had notes and annotations scribbled in the margins and inserted in the text.This was obviously someones rough draftof something.Its the text of an article, Roger told me, shuffling through a pile of huge folio volumes that lay on the sofa.It was published in a sort of journal called Forresters, put out by a printer called Alexander Malcolm, in Edinburgh, in 1765.I swallowed, my shirtwaist dress feeling suddenly too tight under the arms; 1765 was almost twenty years past the time when I had left Jamie.I stared at the scrawling letters, browned with age.They were written by someone of difficult penmanship, here cramped and there sprawling, with exaggerated loops on g and y.  Perhaps the writing of a left handed man, who wrote most painfully with his right hand.See, heres the published version.Roger brought the opened folio to the desk and laid it before me, pointing.See the date?Its 1765, and it matches this handwritten manuscript almost exactly; only a few of the marginal notes arent included.Yes, I said.And the deed of sasine  Here it is.Brianna fumbled hastily in the top drawer and pulled out a much crumpled paper, likewise encased in protective plastic.Protection here was even more after the fact than with the manuscript; the paper was rain spattered, filthy and torn, many of the words blurred beyond recognition.But the three signatures at the bottom still showed plainly.By my hand, read the difficult writing, here executed with such care that only the exaggerated loop of the y showed its kinship with the careless manuscript, James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.And below, the two lines where the witnesses had signed.In a thin, fine script, Murtagh FitzGibbons Fraser, and, below that, in my own large, round hand, Claire Beauchamp Fraser.I sat down quite suddenly, putting my hand over the document instinctively, as though to deny its reality.Thats it, isnt it?said Roger quietly.His outward composure was belied by his hands, trembling slightly as he lifted the stack of manuscript pages to set them next to the deed.You signed it.Proof positiveif we needed it, he added, with a quick glance at Bree.She shook her head, letting her hair fall down to hide her face.They didnt need it, either of them.The vanishing of Geilie Duncan through the stones five months before had been all the evidence anyone could need as to the truth of my story.Still, having it all laid out in black and white was rather staggering.I took my hand away and looked again at the deed, and then at the handwritten manuscript.Is it the same, Mama?Bree bent anxiously over the pages, her hair brushing softly against my hand.The article wasnt signedor it was, but with a pseudonym.She smiled briefly.The author signed himself Q. E. D.  It looked the same to us, but we arent either of us handwriting experts and we didnt want to give these to an expert until youd seen them.I think so.I felt breathless, but quite certain at the same time, with an upwelling of incredulous joy.Yes, Im almost sure.Jamie wrote this.Q. E. D. , indeed!I had an absurd urge to tear the manuscript pages out of their plastic shrouds and clutch them in my hands, to feel the ink and paper he had touched; the certain evidence that he had survived.Theres more.Internal evidence.Rogers voice betrayed his pride.See there?Its an article against the Excise Act of 1764, advocating the repeal of the restrictions on export of liquor from the Scottish Highlands to England.Here it ishis racing finger stopped suddenly on a phrasefor as has been known for ages past, Freedom and Whisky gang tegither.See how hes put that Scottish dialect phrase in quotes?He got it from somewhere else.He got it from me, I said softly.I told him thatwhen he was setting out to steal Prince Charless port.I remembered.Roger nodded, eyes shining with excitement.But its a quote from Burns, I said, frowning suddenly.Perhaps the writer got it therewasnt Burns alive then?He was, said Bree smugly, forestalling Roger.But Robert Burns was six years old in 1765.And Jamie would be forty four.Suddenly, it all seemed real.He was alivehad been alive, I corrected myself, trying to keep my emotions in check.I laid my fingers flat against the manuscript pages, trembling.And if I said, and had to stop to swallow again.And if time goes on in parallel, as we think it does Roger stopped, too, looking at me.Then his eyes shifted to Brianna.She had gone quite pale, but both lips and eyes were steady, and her fingers were warm when she touched my hand.Then you can go back, Mama, she said softly.You can find him.The plastic hangers rattled against the steel tubing of the dress rack as I thumbed my way slowly through the available selection.Can I be helpin ye at all, miss?The salesgirl peered up at me like a helpful Pekingese, blue ringed eyes barely visible through bangs that brushed the top of her nose.Have you got any more of these old fashioned sorts of dresses?I gestured at the rack before me, thick with examples of the current crazelaced bodiced, long skirted dresses in gingham cotton and velveteen.The salesgirls mouth was caked so thickly that I expected the white lipstick to crack when she smiled, but it didnt.Oh, aye, she said.Got a new lot o the Jessica Gutenburgs in just today.Arent they the grooviest, these old style gowns?She ran an admiring finger over a brown velvet sleeve, then whirled on her ballet flats and pointed toward the center of the store.Just there, aye?Where it says, on the sign.The sign, stuck on the top of a circular rack, said CAPTURE THE CHARM OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY in large white letters across the top.Just below, in curlicue script, was the signature, Jessica Gutenburg.Reflecting on the basic improbability of anyone actually being named Jessica Gutenburg, I waded through the contents of the rack, pausing at a truly stunning number in cream velvet, with satin inserts and a good deal of lace.Look lovely on, that would.The Pekingese was back, pug nose sniffing hopefully for a sale.Maybe so, I said, but not very practical.Youd get filthy just walking out of the store.I pushed the white dress away with some regret, proceeding to the next size ten.Oh, I just love the red ones!The girl clasped her hands in ecstasy at the brilliant garnet fabric.So do I, I murmured, but we dont want to look too garish.Wouldnt do to be taken for a prostitute, would it?The Peke gave me a startled look through the thickets, then decided I was joking, and giggled appreciatively.Now, that one, she said decisively, reaching past me, thats perfect, that is.Thats your color, here.Actually, it was almost perfect.Floor length, with three quarter sleeves edged with lace.A deep, tawny gold, with shimmers of brown and amber and sherry in the heavy silk.I lifted it carefully off the rack and held it up to examine it.A trifle fancy, but it might do.The construction seemed halfway decent; no loose threads or unraveling seams.The machine made lace on the bodice was just tacked on, but that would be easy enough to reinforce.Want to try it on?The dressing rooms are just over there.The Peke was frisking about near my elbow, encouraged by my interest.Taking a quick look at the price tag, I could see why; she must work on commission.I took a deep breath at the figure, which would cover a months rent on a London flat, but then shrugged.After all, what did I need money for?Still, I hesitated.I dont know I said doubtfully, it is lovely.But  Oh, dont worry a bit about its being too young for you, the Pekingese reassured me earnestly.You dont look a day over twenty five!Wellmaybe thirty, she concluded lamely, after a quick glance at my face.Thanks, I said dryly.I wasnt worried about that, though.I dont suppose you have any without zippers, do you?Zippers?Her small round face went quite blank beneath the makeup.Ermno.Dont think we do.Well, not to worry, I said, taking the dress over my arm and turning toward the dressing room.If I go through with this, zippers will be the least of it.22  ALL HALLOWS EVE  Two golden guineas, six sovereigns, twenty three shillings, eighteen florins ninepence, ten halfpence, andtwelve farthings.Roger dropped the last coin on the tinkling pile, then dug into his shirt pocket, lean face absorbed as he searched.Oh, here.He brought out a small plastic bag and carefully poured a handful of tiny copper coins into a pile alongside the other money.Doits, he explained.The smallest denomination of Scottish coinage of the time.I got as many as I could, because thats likely what youd use most of the time.You wouldnt use the large coins unless you had to buy a horse or something.I know.I picked up a couple of sovereigns and tilted them in my hand, letting them clink together.They were heavygold coins, nearly an inch in diameter.It had taken Roger and Bree four days in London, going from one rare coin dealer to the next, to assemble the small fortune gleaming in the lamplight before me.You know, its funny; these coins are worth a lot more now than their face value, I said, picking up a golden guinea, but in terms of what theyll buy, they were worth then just about as much as now.This is six months income for a small farmer.I was forgetting, Roger said, that you know all this already; what things were worth and how they were sold.Its easy to forget, I said, eyes still on the money.From the corner of my vision, I saw Bree draw suddenly close to Roger, and his hand go out to her automatically.I took a deep breath and looked up from the tiny heaps of gold and silver.Well, thats that.Shall we go and have some dinner?Dinnerat one of the pubs on River Streetwas a largely silent affair.Claire and Brianna sat side by side on the banquette, with Roger opposite.They barely looked at each other while they ate, but Roger could see the frequent small touches, the tiny nudges of shoulder and hip, the brushing of fingers that went on.How would he manage, he wondered to himself.If it were his choice, or his parent?Separation came to all families, but most often it was death that intervened, to sever the ties between parent and child.It was the element of choice here that made it so difficultnot that it could ever be easy, he thought, forking in a mouthful of hot shepherds pie.As they rose to leave after supper, he laid a hand on Claires arm.Just for the sake of nothing, he said, will you try something for me?I expect so, she said, smiling.What is it?He nodded at the door.Close your eyes and step out of the door.When youre outside, open them.Then come in and tell me whats the first thing you saw.Her mouth twitched with amusement.All right.Well hope the first thing I see isnt a policeman, or youll have to come bail me out of jail for being drunk and disorderly.So long as it isnt a duck.Claire gave him a queer look, but obediently turned toward the door of the pub and closed her eyes.Brianna watched her mother disappear through the door, hand extended to the paneling of the entry to keep her bearings.She turned to Roger, copper eyebrows raised.What are you up to, Roger?Ducks?Nothing, he said, eyes still fixed on the empty entrance.Its just an old custom.SamhainHalloween, you know?thats one of the feasts when it was customary to try to divine the future.And one of the ways of divination was to walk to the end of the house, and then step outside with your eyes closed.The first thing you see when you open them is an omen for the near future.Ducks are bad omens?Depends what theyre doing, he said absently, still watching the entry.If they have their heads under their wings, thats death.Whats keeping her?Maybe wed better go see, Brianna said nervously.I dont expect there are a lot of sleeping ducks in downtown Inverness, but with the river so close  Just as they reached the door, though, its stained glass window darkened and it swung open to reveal Claire, looking mildly flustered.Youll never believe whats the first thing I saw, she said, laughing as she saw them.Not a duck with its head under its wing?asked Brianna anxiously.No, her mother said, giving her a puzzled look.A policeman.I turned to the right and ran smack into him.He was coming toward you, then?Roger felt inexplicably relieved.Well, he was until I ran into him, she said.Then we waltzed round the pavement a bit, clutching each other.She laughed, looking flushed and pretty, with her brown sherry eyes sparkling in the amber pub lights.Why?Thats good luck, Roger said, smiling.To see a man coming toward you on Samhain means youll find what you seek.Does it?Her eyes rested on his, quizzical, then her face lit with a sudden smile.Wonderful!Lets go home and celebrate, shall we?The anxious constraint that had lain on them over dinner seemed suddenly to have vanished, to be replaced with a sort of manic excitement, and they laughed and joked on the trip back to the manse, where they drank toasts to past and futureLoch Minneaig Scotch for Claire and Roger, Coca Cola for Briannaand talked excitedly about the plans for the next day.Brianna had insisted on carving a pumpkin into a jack o lantern, which sat on the sideboard, grinning benevolently on the proceedings.Youve got the money, now, Roger said, for the tenth time.And your cloak, Brianna chimed in.Yes, yes, yes, Claire said impatiently.Everything I needor everything I can manage, at least, she amended.She paused, then impulsively reached out and took both Bree and Roger by the hand.Thank you both, she said, squeezing their hands.Her eyes shone moist, and her voice was suddenly husky.Thank you.I cant say what I feel.I cant.Butoh, my dears, I will miss you!Then she and Bree were in each others arms, Claires head tucked into her daughters neck, the both of them hugged tight, as though simple force could somehow express the depth of feeling between them.Then they broke apart, eyes wet, and Claire laid a hand on her daughters cheek.Id better go up now, she whispered.There are things to do, still.Ill see you in the morning, Baby.She rose on tiptoe to plant a kiss on her daughters nose, then turned and hurried from the room.After her mothers exit, Brianna sat down again with her glass of Coke, and heaved a deep sigh.She didnt speak, but sat looking into the fire, turning the glass slowly between her hands.Roger busied himself, setting the room to rights for the night, closing the windows, tidying the desk, putting away the reference books he had used to help Claire prepare for her journey.He paused by the jack o lantern, but it looked so jolly, with the candlelight streaming from its slanted eyes and jagged mouth, that he couldnt bring himself to blow it out.I shouldnt think its likely to set anything on fire, he remarked.Shall we leave it?There was no answer.When he glanced at Brianna, he found her sitting still as stone, eyes fixed on the hearth.She hadnt heard him.He sat down beside her and took her hand.She might be able to come back, he said gently.We dont know.Brianna shook her head slowly, not taking her eyes from the leaping flames.I dont think so, she said softly.She told you what it was like.She may not even make it through.Long fingers drummed restlessly on a denimed thigh.Roger glanced at the door, to be sure that Claire was safely upstairs, then sat down on the sofa next to Brianna.She belongs with him, Bree, he said.Can ye not see it?When she speaks of him?I see it.I know she needs him.The full lower lip trembled slightly.ButI need her!Briannas hands clenched suddenly tight on her knees, and she bent forward, as though trying to contain some sudden pain.Roger stroked her hair, marveling at the softness of the glowing strands that slid through his fingers.He wanted to take her into his arms, as much for the feel of her as to offer comfort, but she was rigid and unresponsive.Youre grown, Bree, he said softly.You live on your own now, dont you?You may love her, but you dont need her anymorenot the way you did when you were small.Has she no right to her own joy?Yes.ButRoger, you dont understand!she burst out.She pressed her lips tight together and swallowed hard, then turned to him, eyes dark with distress.Shes all thats left, Roger!The only one who really knows me.She and DaddyFrankshe corrected herselfthey were the ones who knew me from the beginning, the ones who saw me learn to walk and were proud of me when I did something good in school, and who She broke off, and the tears overflowed, leaving gleaming tracks in the firelight.This sounds really dumb, she said with sudden violence.Really, really dumb!But its she groped, helpless, then sprang to her feet, unable to stay still.Its likethere are all these things I dont even know!she said, pacing with quick, angry steps.Do you think I remember what I looked like, learning to walk, or what the first word I said was?No, but Mama does!And thats so stupid, because what difference does it make, it doesnt make any difference at all, but its important, it matters because she thought it was, andoh, Roger, if shes gone, there wont be a soul left in the world who cares what Im like, or thinks Im special not because of anything, but just because Im me!Shes the only person in the world who really, really cares I was born, and if shes gone She stood still on the hearthrug, hands clenched at her sides, and mouth twisted with the effort to control herself, tears wet on her cheeks.Then her shoulders slumped and the tension went out of her tall figure.And thats just really dumb and selfish, she said, in a quietly reasonable tone.And you dont understand, and you think Im awful.No, Roger said quietly.I think maybe not.He stood and came behind her, putting his arms around her waist, urging her to lean back against him.She resisted at first, stiff in his arms, but then yielded to the need for physical comfort and relaxed, his chin propped on her shoulder, head tilted to touch her own.I never realized, he said.Not til now.Dye remember all those boxes in the garage?Which ones?she said, with a sniffling attempt at a laugh.There are hundreds.The ones that say Roger on them.He gave her a slight squeeze and brought his arms up, crisscrossed on her chest, holding her snug against himself.Theyre full of my parents old clobber, he said.Pictures and letters and baby clothes and books and old bits of rubbish.The Reverend packed them up when he took me to live with him.Treated them just like his most precious historical documentsdouble boxing, and mothproofing and all that.He rocked slowly back and forth, swaying from side to side, carrying her with him as he watched the fire over her shoulder.I asked him once why he bothered to keep themI didnt want any of it, didnt care.But he said wed keep it just the same; it was my history, he saidand everyone needs a history.Brianna sighed, and her body seemed to relax still further, joining him in his rhythmic, half unconscious sway.Did you ever look inside them?He shook his head.It isnt important whats in them, he said.Only that theyre there.He let go of her then, and stepped back so that she turned to face him.Her face was blotched and her long, elegant nose a little swollen.Youre wrong, you know, he said softly, and held out his hand to her.It isnt only your mother who cares.Brianna had gone to bed long since, but Roger sat on in the study, watching the flames die down in the hearth.Halloween had always seemed to him a restless night, alive with waking spirits.Tonight was even more so, with the knowledge of what would happen in the morning.The jack o lantern on the desk grinned in anticipation, filling the room with the homely scent of baking pies.The sound of a footfall on the stair roused him from his thoughts.He had thought it might be Brianna, unable to sleep, but the visitor was Claire.I thought you might still be awake, she said.She was in her nightdress, a pale glimmer of white satin against the dark hallway.He smiled and stretched out a hand, inviting her in.No.I never could sleep on All Hallows.Not after all the stories my father told me; I always thought I could hear ghosts talking outside my window.She smiled, coming into the firelight.And what did they say?Seest thou this great gray head, with jaws which have no meat?Roger quoted.You know the story?The little tailor who spent the night in a haunted church, and met the hungry ghost?I do.I think if Id heard that outside my window, Id have spent the rest of the night hiding under the bedclothes.Oh, I usually did, Roger assured her.Though once, when I was seven or so, I got up my nerve, stood up on the bed and peed on the windowsillthe Reverend had just told me that pissing on the doorposts is supposed to keep a ghost from coming in the house.Claire laughed delightedly, the firelight dancing in her eyes.Did it work?Well, it would have worked better had the window been open, Roger said, but the ghosts didnt come in, no.They laughed together, and then one of the small awkward silences that had punctuated the evening fell between them, the sudden realization of enormity gaping beneath the tightrope of conversation.Claire sat beside him, watching the fire, her hands moving restlessly among the folds of her gown.The light winked from her wedding rings, silver and gold, in sparks of fire.Ill take care of her, you know, Roger said quietly, at last.You do know that, dont you?Claire nodded, not looking at him.I know, she said softly.He could see the tears, caught trembling at the edge of her lashes, glowing with firelight.She fumbled in the pocket of her gown, and drew out a long white envelope.Youll think me a dreadful coward, she said, and I am.But II honestly dont think I can do itsay goodbye to Bree, I mean.She stopped, to bring her voice under control, and then held out the envelope to him.I wrote it all down for hereverything I could.Will you?Roger took the envelope.It was warm from resting next to her body.From some obscure feeling that it must not be allowed to grow cold before it reached her daughter, he thrust it into his own breast pocket, feeling the crackle of paper as the envelope bent.Yes, he said, hearing his own voice thicken.Then youll go  Early, she said, taking a deep breath.Before dawn.Ive arranged for a car to pick me up.Her hands twisted together in her lap.If I She bit her lip, then looked at Roger pleadingly.I dont know, you see, she said.I dont know whether I can do it.Im very much afraid.Afraid to go.Afraid not to go.Justafraid.I would be, too.He held out his hand and she took it.He held it for a long time, feeling the pulse in her wrist, light and fast against his fingers.After a long time, she squeezed his hand gently and let go.Thank you, Roger, she said.For everything.She leaned over and kissed him lightly on the lips.Then she rose and went out, a white ghost in the darkness of the hall, borne on the Halloween wind.Roger sat on for some time alone, feeling her touch still warm on his skin.The jack o lantern was nearly burned out.The smell of candle wax rose strongly in the restless air, and the pagan gods looked out for the last time, through eyes of guttering flame.23  CRAIGH NA DUN  The early morning air was cold and misty, and I was glad of the cloak.It had been twenty years since Id worn one, but with the sorts of things people wore nowadays, the Inverness tailor whod made it for me had not found an order for a woolen cloak with a hood at all odd.I kept my eyes on the path.The crest of the hill had been invisible, wreathed in mist, when the car had left me on the road below.Here?the driver had said, peering dubiously out of his window at the deserted countryside.Sure, mum?Yes, Id said, half choked with terror.This is the place.Aye?He looked dubious, in spite of the large note I put in his hand.Dye want me to wait, mum?Or to come later, to fetch ye back?I was sorely tempted to say yes.After all, what if I lost my nerve?At the moment, my grip on that slippery substance seemed remarkably feeble.No, I said, swallowing.No, that wont be necessary.If I couldnt do it, I would just have to walk back to Inverness, that was all.Or perhaps Roger and Brianna would come; I thought that would be worse, to be ignominiously retrieved.Or would it be a relief?The granite pebbles rolled beneath my feet and a clod of dirt fell in a small rushing shower, dislodged by my passage.I couldnt possibly really be doing this, I thought.The weight of the money in my reinforced pocket swung against my thigh, the heavy certainty of gold and silver a reminder of reality.I was doing it.I couldnt.Thoughts of Bree as I had seen her late last night, peacefully asleep in her bed, assaulted me.The tendrils of remembered horror reached out from the hilltop above, as I began to sense the nearness of the stones.Screaming, chaos, the feeling of being torn in pieces.I couldnt.I couldnt, but I kept on climbing, palms sweating, my feet moving as though no longer under my control.It was full dawn by the time I reached the top of the hill.The mist lay below, and the stones stood clear and dark against a crystal sky.The sight of them left me wet palmed with apprehension, but I walked forward, and passed into the circle.They were standing on the grass in front of the cleft stone, facing each other.Brianna heard my footsteps and whirled around to face me.I stared at her, speechless with astonishment.She was wearing a Jessica Gutenburg dress, very much like the one I had on, except that hers was a vivid lime green, with plastic jewels stitched across the bosom.Thats a perfectly horrible color for you, I said.Its the only one they had in a size sixteen, she answered calmly.What in the name of goodness are you doing here?I demanded, recovering some remnant of coherence.We came to see you off, she said, and a hint of a smile flickered on her lips.I looked at Roger, who shrugged slightly and gave me a lopsided smile of his own.Oh.Yes.Well, I said.The stone stood behind Brianna, twice the height of a man.I could look through the foot wide crack, and see the faint morning sun shining on the grass outside the circle.Youre going, she said firmly, or I am.You!Are you out of your mind?No.She glanced at the cleft stone and swallowed.It might have been the lime green dress that made her face look chalk white.I can do itgo through, I mean.I know I can.When Geilie Duncan went through the stones, I heard them.Roger did too.She glanced at him as though for reassurance, then fixed her gaze firmly on me.I dont know whether I could find Jamie Fraser or not; maybe only you can.But if you wont try, then I will.My mouth opened, but I couldnt find anything to say.Dont you see, Mama?He has to knowhas to know he did it, he did what he meant to for us.Her lips quivered, and she pressed them together for a minute.We owe it to him, Mama, she said softly.Somebody has to find him, and tell him.Her hand touched my face, briefly.Tell him I was born.Oh, Bree, I said, my voice so choked I could barely speak.Oh, Bree!She was holding my hands tight between her own, squeezing hard.He gave you to me, she said, so low I could hardly hear her.Now I have to give you back to him, Mama.The eyes that were so like Jamies looked down at me, blurred by tears.If you find him, she whispered, when you find my fathergive him this.She bent and kissed me, fiercely, gently, then straightened and turned me toward the stone.Go, Mama, she said, breathless.I love you.Go!From the corner of my eye, I saw Roger move toward her.I took one step, and then another.I heard a sound, a faint roaring.I took the last step, and the world disappeared.PART SIX    Edinburgh   24  A.  MALCOLM, PRINTER  My first coherent thought was, Its raining.This must be Scotland.My second thought was that this observation was no great improvement over the random images jumbling around inside my head, banging into each other and setting off small synaptic explosions of irrelevance.I opened one eye, with some difficulty.The lid was stuck shut, and my entire face felt cold and puffy, like a submerged corpses.I shuddered faintly at the thought, the slight movement making me aware of the sodden fabric all around me.It was certainly raininga soft, steady drum of rain that raised a faint mist of droplets above the green moor.I sat up, feeling like a hippopotamus emerging from a bog, and promptly fell over backward.I blinked and closed my eyes against the downpour.Some small sense of who I wasand where I waswas beginning to come back to me.Bree.Her face emerged suddenly into memory, with a jolt that made me gasp as though Id been punched in the stomach.Jagged images of loss and the rip of separation pulled at me, a faint echo of the chaos in the stone passage.Jamie.There it was; the anchor point to which I had clung, my single hold on sanity.I breathed slow and deep, hands folded over my pounding heart, summoning Jamies face.For a moment, I thought I had lost him, and then it came, clear and bold in my minds eye.Once again, I struggled upright, and this time stayed, propped by my outstretched hands.Yes, certainly it was Scotland.It could hardly by anything else, of course, but it was also the Scotland of the past.At least, I hoped it was the past.It wasnt the Scotland Id left, at any rate.The trees and bushes grew in different patterns; there was a patch of maple saplings just below me that hadnt been there when Id climbed the hillwhen?That morning?Two days ago?I had no idea how much time had passed since I had entered the standing stones, or how long I had lain unconscious on the hillside below the circle.Quite a while, judging from the sogginess of my clothing; I was soaked through to the skin, and small chilly rivulets ran down my sides under my gown.One numbed cheek was beginning to tingle; putting my hand to it, I could feel a pattern of incised bumps.I looked down and saw a layer of fallen rowan berries, gleaming red and black among the grass.Very appropriate, I thought, vaguely amused.I had fallen down under a rowanthe Highland protection against witchcraft and enchantment.I grasped the smooth trunk of the rowan tree, and laboriously hauled myself to my feet.Still holding onto the tree for support, I looked to the northeast.The rain had faded the horizon to a gray invisibility, but I knew that Inverness lay in that direction.No more than an hours trip by car, along modern roads.The road existed; I could see the outline of a rough track that led along the base of the hill, a dark, silvery line in the gleaming green wetness of the moor plants.However, forty odd miles on foot was a far cry from the journey by car that had brought me here.I was beginning to feel somewhat better, standing up.The weakness in my limbs was fading, along with the feeling of chaos and disruption in my mind.It had been as bad as Id feared, this passage; perhaps worse.I could feel the terrible presence of the stones above me, and shuddered, my skin prickling with cold.I was alive, though.Alive, and with a small feeling of certainty, like a tiny glowing sun beneath my ribs.He was here.I knew it now, though I hadnt known it when I threw myself between the stones; that had been a leap of faith.But I had cast out my thought of Jamie like a lifeline tossed into a raging torrentand the line had tightened in my grasp, and pulled me free.I was wet, cold, and felt battered, as though I had been washing about in the surf against a rocky shore.But I was here.And somewhere in this strange country of the past was the man I had come to find.The memories of grief and terror were receding, as I realized that my die was cast.I could not go back; a return trip would almost surely be fatal.As I realized that I was likely here to stay, all hesitations and terrors were superseded by a strange calm, almost exultant.I could not go back.There was nothing to do but go forwardto find him.Cursing my carelessness in not having thought to tell the tailor to make my cloak with a waterproof layer between fabric and lining, I pulled the water soaked garment closer.Even wet, the wool held some warmth.If I began to move, I would grow warmer.A quick pat reassured me that my bundle of sandwiches had made the trip with me.That was good; the thought of walking forty miles on an empty stomach was a daunting one.With luck, I wouldnt have to.I might find a village or a house that had a horse I could buy.But if not, I was prepared.My plan was to go to Invernessby whatever means offered itselfand there take a public coach to Edinburgh.There was no telling where Jamie was at the moment.He might be in Edinburgh, where his article had been published, but he might easily be somewhere else.If I could not find him there, I could go to Lallybroch, his home.Surely his family would know where he wasif any of them were left.The sudden thought chilled me, and I shivered.I thought of a small bookstore that I passed every morning on my way from the parking lot to the hospital.They had been having a sale on posters; I had seen the display of psychedelic examples when I left Joes office for the last time.Today is the first day of the rest of your life, said one poster, above an illustration of a foolish looking chick, absurdly poking its head out of an eggshell.In the other window, another poster showed a caterpillar, inching its way up a flower stalk.Above the stalk soared a brilliantly colored butterfly, and below was the motto A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.The most irritating thing about clichs, I decided, was how frequently they were true.I let go of the rowan tree, and started down the hill toward my future.It was a long, jolting ride from Inverness to Edinburgh, crammed cheek by jowl into a large coach with two other ladies, the small and whiny son of one of the ladies, and four gentlemen of varying sizes and dispositions.Mr.Graham, a small and vivacious gentleman of advanced years who was seated next to me, was wearing a bag of camphor and asafoetida about his neck, to the eyewatering discomfort of the rest of the coach.Capital for dispelling the evil humors of influenza, he explained to me, waving the bag gently under my nose like a censer.I have worn this daily through the autumn and winter months, and havent been sick a day in nearly thirty years!Amazing!I said politely, trying to hold my breath.I didnt doubt it; the fumes probably kept everyone at such a distance that germs couldnt reach him.The effects on the little boy didnt seem nearly so beneficial.After a number of loud and injudicious remarks about the smell in the coach, Master Georgie had been muffled in his mothers bosom, from which he now peeped, looking rather green.I kept a close eye on him, as well as on the chamber pot beneath the seat opposite, in case quick action involving a conjunction of the two should be called for.I gathered that the chamber pot was for use in inclement weather or other emergency, as normally the ladies modesty required stops every hour or so, at which point the passengers would scatter into the roadside vegetation like a covey of quail, even those who did not require relief of bladder or bowels seeking some relief from the stench of Mr.Grahams asafoetida bag.After one or two changes, Mr.Graham found his place beside me superseded by Mr.Wallace, a plump young lawyer, returning to Edinburgh after seeing to the disposition of the estate of an elderly relative in Inverness, as he explained to me.I didnt find the details of his legal practice nearly as fascinating as he did, but under the circumstances, his evident attraction to me was mildly reassuring, and I passed several hours in playing with him upon a small chess set that he produced from a pocket and laid upon his knee.My attention was distracted both from the discomforts of the journey and the intricacies of chess by anticipation of what I might find in Edinburgh.A.  Malcolm.The name kept running through my mind like an anthem of hope.A.  Malcolm.It had to be Jamie, it simply had to!James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.Considering the way the Highland rebels were treated after Culloden, it would be very reasonable for him to use an assumed name in a place like Edinburgh, Roger Wakefield had explained to me.Particularly himhe was a convicted traitor, after all.Made rather a habit of it, too, it looks like, he had added critically, looking over the scrawled manuscript of the antitax diatribe.For the times, this is bloody near sedition.Yes, that sounds like Jamie, I had said dryly, but my heart had leapt at the sight of that distinctively untidy scrawl, with its boldly worded sentiments.My Jamie.I touched the small hard rectangle in my skirt pocket, wondering how long it would be, before we reached Edinburgh.The weather kept unseasonably fine, with no more than the occasional drizzle to hinder our passage, and we completed the journey in less than two days, stopping four times to change horses and refresh ourselves at posthouse taverns.The coach debouched into a yard at the back of Boyds Whitehorse tavern, near the foot of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.The passengers emerged into the watery sunshine like newly hatched chrysalids, rumpled of wing and jerky in movement, unaccustomed to mobility.After the dimness of the coach, even the cloudy gray light of Edinburgh seemed blinding.I had pins and needles in my feet from so long sitting, but hurried nonetheless, hoping to escape from the courtyard while my erstwhile companions were busy with the retrieval of their belongings.No such luck; Mr.Wallace caught up with me near the street.Mrs.Fraser!he said.Might I beg the pleasure of accompanying you to your destination?You will surely require some assistance in the removal of your luggage.He looked over his shoulder toward the coach, where the ostlers were heaving the bags and portmanteaux apparently at random into the crowd, to the accompaniment of incoherent grunts and shouts.Er I said.Thank you, but Ier, Im leaving my luggage in charge of the landlord.Mymy I groped frantically.My husbands servant will come fetch it later.His plump face fell slightly at the word husband, but he rallied gallantly, taking my hand and bowing low over it.I quite see.May I express my profound appreciation for the pleasure of your company on our journey, then, Mrs.Fraser?And perhaps we shall meet again.He straightened up, surveying the crowd that eddied past us.Is your husband meeting you?I should be delighted to make his acquaintance.While Mr.Wallaces interest in me had been rather flattering, it was rapidly becoming a nuisance.No, I shall be joining him later, I said.So nice to have met you, Mr.Wallace; Ill hope to see you again sometime.I shook Mr.Wallaces hand enthusiastically, which disconcerted him enough for me to slither off through the throng of passengers, ostlers and food sellers.I didnt dare pause near the coachyard for fear he would come out after me.I turned and darted up the slope of the Royal Mile, moving as quickly as my voluminous skirts would allow, jostling and bumping my way through the crowd.I had had the luck to pick a market day for my arrival, and I was soon lost to sight from the coachyard among the luckenbooths and oyster sellers who lined the street.Panting like an escaped pickpocket, I stopped for breath halfway up the hill.There was a public fountain here, and I sat down on the rim to catch my breath.I was here.Really here.Edinburgh sloped up behind me, to the glowering heights of Edinburgh Castle, and down before me, to the gracious majesty of Holyrood Palace at the foot of the city.The last time I had stood by this fountain, Bonnie Prince Charlie had been addressing the gathered citizenry of Edinburgh, inspiring them with the sight of his royal presence.He had bounded exuberantly from the rim to the carved center finial of the fountain, one foot in the basin, clinging to one of the spouting heads for support, shouting On to England!The crowd had roared, pleased at this show of youthful high spirits and athletic prowess.I would myself have been more impressed had I not noticed that the water in the fountain had been turned off in anticipation of the gesture.I wondered where Charlie was now.He had gone back to Italy after Culloden, I supposed, there to live whatever life was possible for royalty in permanent exile.What he was doing, I neither knew nor cared.He had passed from the pages of history, and from my life as well, leaving wreck and ruin in his wake.It remained to be seen what might be salvaged now.I was very hungry; I had had nothing to eat since a hasty breakfast of rough parritch and boiled mutton, made soon after dawn at a posthouse in Dundaff.I had one last sandwich remaining in my pocket, but had been reluctant to eat it in the coach, under the curious gaze of my fellow travelers.I pulled it out and carefully unwrapped it.Peanut butter and jelly on white bread, it was considerably the worse for wear, with the purple stains of the jelly seeping through the limp bread, and the whole thing mashed into a flattened wodge.It was delicious.I ate it carefully, savoring the rich, oily taste of the peanut butter.How many mornings had I slathered peanut butter on bread, making sandwiches for Briannas school lunches?Firmly suppressing the thought, I examined the passersby for distraction.They did look somewhat different from their modern equivalents; both men and women tended to be shorter, and the signs of poor nutrition were evident.Still, there was an overwhelming familiarity to themthese were people I knew, Scots and English for the most part, and hearing the rich burring babble of voices in the street, after so many years of the flat nasal tones of Boston, I had quite an extraordinary feeling of coming home.I swallowed the last rich, sweet bite of my old life, and crumpled the wrapper in my hand.I glanced around, but no one was looking in my direction.I opened my hand, and let the bit of plastic film fall surreptitiously to the ground.Wadded up, it rolled a few inches on the cobbles, crinkling and unfolding itself as though alive.The light wind caught it, and the small transparent sheet took sudden wing, scudding over the gray stones like a leaf.The draft of a set of passing wheels sucked it under a draymans cart; it winked once with reflected light, and was gone, disappearing without notice from the passersby.I wondered whether my own anachronistic presence would cause as little harm.You are dithering, Beauchamp, I said to myself.Time to get on.I took a deep breath and stood up.Excuse me, I said, catching the sleeve of a passing bakers boy.Im looking for a printera Mr.Malcolm.Alexander Malcolm.A feeling of mingled dread and excitement gurgled through my middle.What if there was no printshop run by Alexander Malcolm in Edinburgh?There was, though; the boys face screwed up in thought and then relaxed.Oh, aye, mumjust down the way and to your left.Carfax Close.And hitching his loaves up under his arm with a nod, he plunged back into the crowded street.Carfax Close.I edged my way back into the crowd, pressing close to the buildings, to avoid the occasional shower of slops that splattered into the street from the windows high above.There were several thousand people in Edinburgh, and the sewage from all of them was running down the gutters of the cobbled street, depending on gravity and the frequent rain to keep the city habitable.The low, dark opening to Carfax Close yawned just ahead, across the expanse of the Royal Mile.I stopped dead, looking at it, my heart beating hard enough to be heard a yard away, had anyone been listening.It wasnt raining, but was just about to, and the dampness in the air made my hair curl.I pushed it off my forehead, tidying it as best I could without a mirror.Then I caught sight of a large plate glass window up ahead, and hurried forward.The glass was misty with condensation, but provided a dim reflection, in which my face looked flushed and wide eyed, but otherwise presentable.My hair, however, had seized the opportunity to curl madly in all directions, and was writhing out of its hairpins in excellent imitation of Medusas locks.I yanked the pins out impatiently, and began to twist up my curls.There was a woman inside the shop, leaning across the counter.There were three small children with her, and I watched with half an eye as she turned from her business to address them impatiently, swatting with her reticule at the middle one, a boy who was fiddling with several stalks of fresh anise that stood in a pail of water on the floor.It was an apothecarys shop; glancing up, I saw the name Haugh above the door, and felt a thrill of recognition.I had bought herbs here, during the brief time I had lived in Edinburgh.The decor of the window had been augmented sometime since by the addition of a large jar of colored water, in which floated something vaguely humanoid.A fetal pig, or perhaps an infant baboon; it had leering, flattened features that pressed against the rounded side of the jar in a disconcerting fashion.Well, at least I look better than you!I muttered, shoving in a recalcitrant pin.I looked better than the woman inside, too, I thought.Her business concluded, she was stuffing her purchase into the bag she carried, her thin face frowning as she did so.She had the rather pasty look of a city dweller, and her skin was deeply lined, with sharp creases running from nose to mouth, and a furrowed forehead.Deil tak ye, ye wee ratten, she was saying crossly to the little boy as they all clattered out of the shop together.Have I no told ye time and again to keep yer paws in yer pockets?Excuse me.I stepped forward, interrupting, impelled by a sudden irresistible curiosity.Aye?Distracted from maternal remonstration, she looked blankly at me.Up close, she looked even more harried.The corners of her mouth were pinched, and her lips folded inno doubt because of missing teeth.I couldnt help admiring your children, I said, with as much pretense of admiration as I could manage on short notice.I beamed kindly at them.Such pretty babies!Tell me, how old are they?Her jaw dropped, confirming the absence of several teeth.She blinked at me, then said, Oh!Well, thats maist kind o ye, mum.AhMaisri here is ten, she said, nodding at the eldest girl, who was in the act of wiping her nose on her sleeve, Joeys eighttak yer finger out o yer nose, ye clattie imp!she hissed, then turned and proudly patted her youngest on the head.And wee Pollys just turned six this May.Really!I gazed at the woman affecting astonishment.You scarcely look old enough to have children of that age.You must have married very young.She preened slightly, smirking.Och, no!Not so young as all that; why, I was all o nineteen when Maisri was born.Amazing, I said, meaning it.I dug in my pocket and offered the children each a penny, which they took with shy bobs of thanks.Good day to youand congratulations on your lovely family, I said to the woman, and walked away with a smile and a wave.Nineteen when the eldest was born, and Maisri was ten now.She was twenty nine.And I, blessed by good nutrition, hygiene, and dentistry, not worn down by multiple pregnancies and hard physical labor, looked a good deal younger than she.I took a deep breath, pushed back my hair, and marched into the shadows of Carfax Close.It was a longish, winding close, and the printshop was at the foot.There were thriving businesses and tenements on either side, but I had no attention to spare for anything beyond the neat white sign that hung by the door.A.  MALCOLM   PRINTER AND BOOKSELLER  it said, and beneath this, Books, calling cards, pamphlets, broadsheets, letters, etc.I stretched out my hand and touched the black letters of the name.A.  Malcolm.Alexander Malcolm.James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.Perhaps.Another minute, and I would lose my nerve.I shoved open the door and walked in.There was a broad counter across the front of the room, with an open flap in it, and a rack to one side that held several trays of type.Posters and notices of all sorts were tacked up on the opposite wall; samples, no doubt.The door into the back room was open, showing the bulky angular frame of a printing press.Bent over it, his back turned to me, was Jamie.Is that you, Geordie?he asked, not turning around.He was dressed in shirt and breeches, and had a small tool of some kind in his hand, with which he was doing something to the innards of the press.Took ye long enough.Did ye get the  It isnt Geordie, I said.My voice was higher than usual.Its me, I said.Claire.He straightened up very slowly.He wore his hair long; a thick tail of a deep, rich auburn sparked with copper.I had time to see that the neat ribbon that tied it back was green, and then he turned around.He stared at me without speaking.A tremor ran down the muscular throat as he swallowed, but still he didnt say anything.It was the same broad, good humored face, dark blue eyes aslant the high, flat cheekbones of a Viking, long mouth curling at the ends as though always on the verge of smiling.The lines surrounding eyes and mouth were deeper, of course.The nose had changed just a bit.The knife edge bridge was slightly thickened near the base by the ridge of an old, healed fracture.It made him look fiercer, I thought, but lessened that air of aloof reserve, and lent his appearance a new rough charm.I walked through the flap in the counter, seeing nothing but that unblinking stare.I cleared my throat.When did you break your nose?The corners of the wide mouth lifted slightly.About three minutes after I last saw yeSassenach.There was a hesitation, almost a question in the name.There was no more than a foot between us.I reached out tentatively and touched the tiny line of the break, where the bone pressed white against the bronze of his skin.He flinched backward as though an electric spark had arced between us, and the calm expression shattered.Youre real, he whispered.I had thought him pale already.Now all vestiges of color drained from his face.His eyes rolled up and he slumped to the floor in a shower of papers and oddments that had been sitting on the presshe fell rather gracefully for such a large man, I thought abstractedly.It was only a faint; his eyelids were beginning to flutter by the time I knelt beside him and loosened the stock at his throat.I had no doubts at all by now, but still I looked automatically as I pulled the heavy linen away.It was there, of course, the small triangular scar just above the collarbone, left by the knife of Captain Jonathan Randall, Esquire, of His Majestys Eighth Dragoons.His normal healthy color was returning.I sat cross legged on the floor and hoisted his head onto my thigh.His hair felt thick and soft in my hand.His eyes opened.That bad, is it?I said, smiling down at him with the same words he had used to me on the day of our wedding, holding my head in his lap, twenty odd years before.That bad, and worse, Sassenach, he answered, mouth twitching with something almost a smile.He sat up abruptly, staring at me.God in heaven, you are real!So are you.I lifted my chin to look up at him.I th thought you were dead.I had meant to speak lightly, but my voice betrayed me.The tears spilled down my cheeks, only to soak into the rough cloth of his shirt as he pulled me hard against him.I shook so that it was some time before I realized that he was shaking, too, and for the same reason.I dont know how long we sat there on the dusty floor, crying in each others arms with the longing of twenty years spilling down our faces.His fingers twined hard in my hair, pulling it loose so that it tumbled down my neck.The dislodged pins cascaded over my shoulders and pinged on the floor like pellets of hail.My own fingers were clasped around his forearm, digging into the linen as though I were afraid he would disappear unless physically restrained.As though gripped by the same fear, he suddenly grasped me by the shoulders and held me away from him, staring desperately into my face.He put his hand to my cheek, and traced the bones over and over again, oblivious to my tears and to my abundantly running nose.I sniffed loudly, which seemed to bring him to his senses, for he let go and groped hastily in his sleeve for a handkerchief, which he used clumsily to swab first my face, then his own.Give me that.I grabbed the erratically waving swatch of cloth and blew my nose firmly.Now you.I handed him the cloth and watched as he blew his nose with a noise like a strangled goose.I giggled, undone with emotion.He smiled too, knuckling the tears away from his eyes, unable to stop staring at me.Suddenly I couldnt bear not to be touching him.I lunged at him, and he got his arms up just in time to catch me.I squeezed until I could hear his ribs crack, and felt his hands roughly caressing my back as he said my name over and over.At last I could let go, and sat back a little.He glanced down at the floor between his legs, frowning.Did you lose something?I asked, surprised.He looked up and smiled, a little shyly.I was afraid Id lost hold altogether and pissed myself, but its all right.Ive just sat on the alepot.Sure enough, a pool of aromatic brown liquid was spreading slowly beneath him.With a squeak of alarm, I scrambled to my feet and helped him up.After trying vainly to assess the damage behind, he shrugged and unfastened his breeches.He pushed the tight fabric down over his haunches, then stopped and looked at me, blushing slightly.Its all right, I said, feeling a rich blush stain my own cheeks.Were married.I cast my eyes down, nonetheless, feeling a little breathless.At least, I suppose we are.He stared at me for a long moment, then a smile curved his wide, soft mouth.Aye, we are, he said.Kicking free of the stained breeches, he stepped toward me.I stretched out a hand toward him, as much to stop as to welcome him.I wanted more than anything to touch him again, but was unaccountably shy.After so long, how were we to start again?He felt the constraint of mingled shyness and intimacy as well.Stopping a few inches from me, he took my hand.He hesitated for a moment, then bent his head over it, his lips barely brushing my knuckles.His fingers touched the silver ring and stopped there, holding the metal lightly between thumb and forefinger.I never took it off, I blurted.It seemed important he should know that.He squeezed my hand lightly, but didnt let go.I want He stopped and swallowed, still holding my hand.His fingers found and touched the silver ring once more.I want verra much to kiss you, he said softly.May I do that?The tears were barely dammed.Two more welled up and overflowed; I felt them, full and round, roll down my cheeks.Yes, I whispered.He drew me slowly close to him, holding our linked hands just under his breast.I havena done this for a verra long time, he said.I saw the hope and the fear dark in the blue of his eyes.I took the gift and gave it back to him.Neither have I, I said softly.His hands cupped my face with exquisite gentleness, and he set his mouth on mine.I didnt know quite what I had been expecting.A reprise of the pounding fury that had accompanied our final parting?I had remembered that so often, lived it over in memory, helpless to change the outcome.The half rough, timeless hours of mutual possession in the darkness of our marriage bed?I had longed for that, wakened often sweating and trembling from the memory of it.But we were strangers now, barely touching, each seeking the way toward joining, slowly, tentatively, seeking and giving unspoken permission with our silent lips.My eyes were closed, and I knew without looking that Jamies were, as well.We were, quite simply, afraid to look at each other.Without raising his head, he began to stroke me lightly, feeling my bones through my clothes, familiarizing himself again with the terrain of my body.At last his hand traveled down my arm and caught my right hand.His fingers traced my hand until they found the ring again, and circled it, feeling the interlaced silver of the Highland pattern, polished with long wear, but still distinct.His lips moved from mine, across my cheeks and eyes.I gently stroked his back, feeling through his shirt the marks I couldnt see, the remnants of old scars, like my ring, worn but still distinct.Ive seen ye so many times, he said, his voice whispering warm in my ear.Youve come to me so often.When I dreamed sometimes.When I lay in fever.When I was so afraid and so lonely I knew I must die.When I needed you, I would always see ye, smiling, with your hair curling up about your face.But ye never spoke.And ye never touched me.I can touch you now.I reached up and drew my hand gently down his temple, his ear, the cheek and jaw that I could see.My hand went to the nape of his neck, under the clubbed bronze hair, and he raised his head at last, and cupped my face between his hands, love glowing strong in the dark blue eyes.Dinna be afraid, he said softly.Theres the two of us now.We might have gone on standing there gazing at each other indefinitely, had the shop bell over the door not rung.I let go of Jamie and looked around sharply, to see a small, wiry man with coarse dark hair standing in the door, mouth agape, holding a small parcel in one hand.Oh, there ye are, Geordie!Whats kept ye?Jamie said.Geordie said nothing, but his eyes traveled dubiously over his employer, standing bare legged in his shirt in the middle of the shop, his breeches, shoes, and stockings discarded on the floor, and me in his arms, with my gown all crumpled and my hair coming down.Geordies narrow face creased into a censorious frown.I quit, he said, in the rich tones of the West Highlands.The printings one thingIm wi ye there, and yell no think otherwisebut Im Free Church and my daddy before me and my grandsire before him.Workin for a Papist is one thingthe Popes coins as good as any, aye?but workin for an immoral Papist is another.Do as ye like wi your own soul, man, but if its come to orgies in the shop, its come too far, thats what I say.I quit!He placed the package precisely in the center of the counter, spun on his heel and stalked toward the door.Outside, the Town Clock on the Tolbooth began to strike.Geordie turned in the doorway to glare accusingly at us.And it not even noon yet!he said.The shop door slammed behind him.Jamie stared after him for a moment, then sank slowly down onto the floor again, laughing so hard, the tears came to his eyes.And its not even noon yet!he repeated, wiping the tears off his cheeks.Oh, God, Geordie!He rocked back and forth, grasping his knees with both hands.I couldnt help laughing myself, though I was rather worried.I didnt mean to cause you trouble, I said.Will he come back, do you think?He sniffed and wiped his face carelessly on the tail of his shirt.Oh, aye.He lives just across the way, in Wickham Wynd.Ill go and see him in a bit, andand explain, he said.He looked at me, realization dawning, and added, God knows how!It looked for a minute as though he might start laughing again, but he mastered the impulse and stood up.Have you got another pair of breeches?I asked, picking up the discarded ones and draping them across the counter to dry.Aye, I haveupstairs.Wait a bit, though.He snaked a long arm into the cupboard beneath the counter, and came out with a neatly lettered notice that said GONE OUT.Attaching this to the outside of the door, and firmly bolting the inside, he turned to me.Will ye step upstairs wi me?he said.He crooked an arm invitingly, eyes sparkling.If ye dinna think it immoral?Why not?I said.The impulse to explode in laughter was just below the surface, sparkling in my blood like champagne.Were married, arent we?The upstairs was divided into two rooms, one on either side of the landing, and a small privy closet just off the landing itself.The back room was plainly devoted to storage for the printing business; the door was propped open, and I could see wooden crates filled with books, towering bundles of pamphlets neatly tied with twine, barrels of alcohol and powdered ink, and a jumble of odd looking hardware that I assumed must be spare parts for a printing press.The front room was spare as a monks cell.There was a chest of drawers with a pottery candlestick on it, a washstand, a stool, and a narrow cot, little more than a camp bed.I let out my breath when I saw it, only then realizing that I had been holding it.He slept alone.A quick glance around confirmed that there was no sign of a feminine presence in the room, and my heart began to beat with a normal rhythm again.Plainly no one lived here but Jamie; he had pushed aside the curtain that blocked off a corner of the room, and the row of pegs revealed there supported no more than a couple of shirts, a coat and long waistcoat in sober gray, a gray wool cloak, and the spare pair of breeches he had come to fetch.He had his back turned to me as he tucked in his shirt and fastened the new breeches, but I could see the self consciousness in the tense line of his shoulders.I could feel a similar tension in the back of my own neck.Given a moment to recover from the shock of seeing each other, we were both stricken now with shyness.I saw his shoulders straighten and then he turned around to face me.The hysterical laughter had left us, and the tears, though his face still showed the marks of so much sudden feeling, and I knew mine did, too.Its verra fine to see ye, Claire, he said softly.I thought I neverwell.He shrugged slightly, as though to ease the tightness of the linen shirt across his shoulders.He swallowed, then met my eyes directly.The child?he said.Everything he felt was evident on his face; urgent hope, desperate fear, and the struggle to contain both.I smiled at him, and put out my hand.Come here.I had thought long and hard about what I might bring with me, should my journey through the stones succeed.Given my previous brush with accusations of witchcraft, I had been very careful.But there was one thing I had had to bring, no matter what the consequences might be if anyone saw them.I pulled him down to sit beside me on the cot, and pulled out of my pocket the small rectangular package I had done up with such care in Boston.I undid its waterproof wrapping, and thrust its contents into his hands.There, I said.He took them from me, gingerly, like one handling an unknown and possibly dangerous substance.His big hands framed the photographs for a moment, holding them confined.Briannas round newborn face was oblivious between his fingers, tiny fists curled on her blanket, slanted eyes closed in the new exhaustion of existence, her small mouth slightly open in sleep.I looked up at his face; it was absolutely blank with shock.He held the pictures close to his chest, unmoving, wide eyed and staring as though he had just been transfixed by a crossbow bolt through the heartas I supposed he had.Your daughter sent you this, I said.I turned his blank face toward me and gently kissed him on the mouth.That broke the trance; he blinked and his face came to life again.Myshe His voice was hoarse with shock.Daughter.My daughter.Sheknows?She does.Look at the rest.I slid the first picture from his grasp, revealing the snapshot of Brianna, uproariously festooned with the icing of her first birthday cake, a four toothed smile of fiendish triumph on her face as she waved a new plush rabbit overhead.Jamie made a small inarticulate sound, and his fingers loosened.I took the small stack of photographs from him and gave them back, one at a time.Brianna at two, stubby in her snowsuit, cheeks round and flushed as apples, feathery hair wisping from under her hood.Bree at four, hair a smooth bell shaped gleam as she sat, one ankle propped on the opposite knee as she smiled for the photographer, proper and poised in a white pinafore.At five, in proud possession of her first lunchbox, waiting to board the school bus to kindergarten.She wouldnt let me go with her; she wanted to go alone.Shes very b brave, not afraid of anything I felt half choked as I explained, displayed, pointed to the changing images that fell from his hands and slid down to the floor as he began to snatch each new picture.Oh, God!he said, at the picture of Bree at ten, sitting on the kitchen floor with her arms around Smoky, the big Newfoundland.That one was in color; her hair a brilliant shimmer against the dogs shiny black coat.His hands were shaking so badly that he couldnt hold the pictures anymore; I had to show him the last fewBree full grown, laughing at a string of fish shed caught; standing at a window in secretive contemplation; red faced and tousled, leaning on the handle of the ax she had been using to split kindling.These showed her face in all the moods I could capture, always that face, long nosed and wide mouthed, with those high, broad, flat Viking cheekbones and slanted eyesa finer boned, more delicate version of her fathers, of the man who sat on the cot beside me, mouth working wordlessly, and the tears running soundless down his own cheeks.He splayed a hand out over the photographs, trembling fingers not quite touching the shiny surfaces, and then he turned and leaned toward me, slowly, with the improbable grace of a tall tree falling.He buried his face in my shoulder and went very quietly and thoroughly to pieces.I held him to my breast, arms tight around the broad, shaking shoulders, and my own tears fell on his hair, making small dark patches in the ruddy waves.I pressed my cheek against the top of his head, and murmured small incoherent things to him as though he were Brianna.I thought to myself that perhaps it was like surgeryeven when an operation is done to repair existing damage, the healing still is painful.Her name?He raised his face at last, wiping his nose on the back of his hand.He picked up the pictures again, gently, as though they might disintegrate at his touch.What did ye name her?Brianna, I said proudly.Brianna?he said, frowning at the pictures.What an awful name for a wee lassie!I started back as though struck.It is not awful!I snapped.Its a beautiful name, and besides you told me to name her that!What do you mean, its an awful name?I told ye to name her that?He blinked.You most certainly did!When wewhen wethe last time I saw you.I pressed my lips tightly together so I wouldnt cry again.After a moment, I had mastered my feelings enough to add, You told me to name the baby for your father.His name was Brian, wasnt it?Aye, it was.A smile seemed to be struggling for dominance of the other emotions on his face.Aye, he said.Aye, youre right, I did.Its onlywell, I thought it would be a boy, is all.And youre sorry she wasnt?I glared at him, and began snatching up the scattered photographs.His hands on my arms stopped me.No, he said.No, Im not sorry.Of course not!His mouth twitched slightly.But I willna deny shes the hell of a shock, Sassenach.So are you.I sat still for a moment, looking at him.I had had months to prepare myself for this, and still my knees felt weak and my stomach was clenched in knots.He had been taken completely unawares by my appearance; little wonder if he was reeling a bit under the impact.I expect I am.Are you sorry I came?I asked.I swallowed.Dodo you want me to go?His hands clamped my arms so tightly that I let out a small yelp.Realizing that he was hurting me, he loosened his grip, but kept a firm hold nonetheless.His face had gone quite pale at the suggestion.He took a deep breath and let it out.No, he said, with an approximation of calmness.I dont.I He broke off abruptly, jaw clamped.No, he said again, very definitely.His hand slid down to take hold of mine, and with the other he reached down to pick up the photographs.He laid them on his knee, looking at them with head bent, so I couldnt see his face.Brianna, he said softly.Ye say it wrong, Sassenach.Her name is Brianna.He said it with an odd Highland lilt, so that the first syllable was accented, the second barely pronounced.Breeanah.Breeanah?I said, amused.He nodded, eyes still fixed on the pictures.Brianna, he said.Its a beautiful name.Glad you like it, I said.He glanced up then, and met my eyes, with a smile hidden in the corner of his long mouth.Tell me about her.One forefinger traced the pudgy features of the baby in the snowsuit.What was she like as a wee lassie?What did she first say, when she learned to speak?His hand drew me closer, and I nestled close to him.He was big, and solid, and smelled of clean linen and ink, with a warm male scent that was as exciting to me as it was familiar.Dog, I said.That was her first word.The second one was No!The smile widened across his face.Aye, they all learn that one fast.Shell like dogs, then?He fanned the pictures out like cards, searching out the one with Smoky.Thats a lovely dog with her there.What sort is that?A Newfoundland.I bent forward to thumb through the pictures.Theres another one here with a puppy a friend of mine gave her  The dim gray daylight had begun to fade, and the rain had been pattering on the roof for some time, before our talk was interrupted by a fierce subterranean growl emanating from below the lace trimmed bodice of my Jessica Gutenburg.It had been a long time since the peanut butter sandwich.Hungry, Sassenach?Jamie asked, rather unnecessarily, I thought.Well, yes, now that you mention it.Do you still keep food in the top drawer?When we were first married, I had developed the habit of keeping small bits of food on hand, to supply his constant appetite, and the top drawer of any chest of drawers where we lived generally provided a selection of rolls, small cakes, or bits of cheese.He laughed and stretched.Aye, I do.Theres no much there just now, though, but a couple of stale bannocks.Better I take ye down to the tavern, and The look of happiness engendered by perusing the photographs of Brianna faded, to be replaced by a look of alarm.He glanced quickly at the window, where a soft purplish color was beginning to replace the pale gray, and the look of alarm deepened.The tavern!Christ!Ive forgotten Mr.Willoughby!He was on his feet and groping in the chest for fresh stockings before I could say anything.Coming out with the stockings in one hand and two bannocks in the other, he tossed the latter into my lap and sat down on the stool, hastily yanking on the former.Whos Mr.Willoughby?I bit into a bannock, scattering crumbs.Damn, he said, more to himself than me, I said Id come for him at noon, but it went out o my head entirely!It must be four oclock by now!It is; I heard the clock strike a little while ago.Damn!he repeated.Thrusting his feet into a pair of pewter buckled shoes, he rose, snatched his coat from the peg, and then paused at the door.Youll come wi me?he asked anxiously.I licked my fingers and rose, pulling my cloak around me.Wild horses couldnt stop me, I assured him.25  HOUSE OF JOY  Who is Mr.Willoughby?I inquired, as we paused under the arch of Carfax Close to peer out at the cobbled street.Erhes an associate of mine, Jamie replied, with a wary glance at me.Best put up your hood, its pouring.It was in fact raining quite hard; sheets of water fell from the arch overhead and gurgled down the gutters, cleansing the streets of sewage and rubbish.I took a deep breath of the damp, clean air, feeling exhilarated by the wildness of the evening and the closeness of Jamie, tall and powerful by my side.I had found him.I had found him, and whatever unknowns life now held, they didnt seem to matter.I felt reckless and indestructible.I took his hand and squeezed it; he looked down and smiled at me, squeezing back.Where are we going?To The Worlds End.The roar of the water made conversation difficult.Without further speech, Jamie took me by the elbow to help me across the cobbles, and we plunged down the steep incline of the Royal Mile.Luckily, the tavern called The Worlds End was no more than a hundred yards away; hard as the rain was, the shoulders of my cloak were scarcely more than dampened when we ducked beneath the low lintel and into the narrow entry hall.The main room was crowded, warm and smoky, a snug refuge from the storm outside.There were a few women seated on the benches that ran along the walls, but most of the patrons were men.Here and there was a man in the well kept dress of a merchant, but most men with homes to go to were in them at this hour; the tavern hosted a mix of soldiers, wharf rats, laborers and apprentices, with here and there the odd drunkard for variety.Heads looked up at our appearance, and there were shouts of greeting, and a general shuffling and pushing, to make room at one of the long tables.Clearly Jamie was well known in The Worlds End.A few curious glances came my way, but no one said anything.I kept my cloak pulled close around me, and followed Jamie through the crush of the tavern.Nay, mistress, well no be stayin, he said to the young barmaid who bustled forward with an eager smile.Ive only come for himself.The girl rolled her eyes.Oh, aye, and no before time, either!Mithers put him doon the stair.Aye, Im late, Jamie said apologetically.I hadbusiness that kept me.The girl looked curiously at me, but then shrugged and dimpled at Jamie.Och, its no trouble, sir.Harry took him doon a stoup of brandy, and weve heard little more of him since.Brandy, eh?Jamie sounded resigned.Still awake, is he?He reached into the pocket of his coat and brought out a small leather pouch, from which he extracted several coins, which he dropped into the girls outstretched hand.I expect so, she said cheerfully, pocketing the money.I heard him singin a whiles since.Thankee, sir!With a nod, Jamie ducked under the lintel at the back of the room, motioning me to follow.A tiny, barrel ceilinged kitchen lay behind the main taproom, with a huge kettle of what looked like oyster stew simmering in the hearth.It smelled delicious, and I could feel my mouth starting to water at the rich aroma.I hoped we could do our business with Mr.Willoughby over supper.A fat woman in a grimy bodice and skirt knelt by the hearth, stuffing billets of wood into the fire.She glanced up at Jamie and nodded, but made no move to get up.He lifted a hand in response, and headed for a small wooden door in the corner.He lifted the bolt and swung the door open to reveal a dark stairway leading down, apparently into the bowels of the earth.A light flickered somewhere far below, as though elves were mining diamonds beneath the tavern.Jamies shoulders filled the narrow stairwell, obstructing my view of whatever lay below us.When he stepped out into the open space below, I could see heavy oak rafters, and a row of huge casks, standing on a long plank set on hurdles against the stone wall.Only a single torch burned at the foot of the stair.The cellar was shadowy, and its cavelike depths seemed quite deserted.I listened, but didnt hear anything but the muffled racket of the tavern upstairs.Certainly no singing.Are you sure hes down here?I bent to peer beneath the row of casks, wondering whether perhaps the bibulous Mr.Willoughby had been overcome with an excess of brandy and sought some secluded spot to sleep it off.Oh, aye.Jamie sounded grim, but resigned.The wee buggers hiding, I expect.He knows I dinna like it when he drinks in public houses.I raised an eyebrow at this, but he merely strode into the shadows, muttering under his breath.The cellar stretched some way, and I could hear him, shuffling cautiously in the dark, long after I lost sight of him.Left in the circle of torchlight near the stairs, I looked around with interest.Besides the row of casks, there were a number of wooden crates stacked near the center of the room, against an odd little chunk of wall that stood by itself, rising some five feet out of the cellar floor, running back into the darkness.I had heard of this feature of the tavern when we had stayed in Edinburgh twenty years before with His Highness Prince Charles, but what with one thing and another, I had never actually seen it before.It was the remnant of a wall constructed by the city fathers of Edinburgh, following the disastrous Battle of Flodden Field in 1513.Concludingwith some justicethat no good was likely to come of association with the English to the south, they had built a wall defining both the city limits and the limit of the civilized world of Scotland.Hence The Worlds End, and the name had stuck through several versions of the tavern that had eventually been built upon the remnants of the old Scots wishful thinking.Damned little bugger.Jamie emerged from the shadows, a cobweb stuck in his hair, and a frown on his face.He must be back of the wall.Turning, he put his hands to his mouth and shouted something.It sounded like incomprehensible gibberishnot even like Gaelic.I dug a finger dubiously into one ear, wondering whether the trip through the stones had deranged my hearing.A sudden movement caught the corner of my eye, causing me to look up, just in time to see a ball of brilliant blue fly off the top of the ancient wall and smack Jamie squarely between the shoulderblades.He hit the cellar floor with a frightful thump, and I dashed toward his fallen body.Jamie!Are you all right?The prone figure made a number of coarse remarks in Gaelic and sat up slowly, rubbing his forehead, which had struck the stone floor a glancing blow.The blue ball, meanwhile, had resolved itself into the figure of a very small Chinese, who was giggling in unhinged delight, sallow round face shining with glee and brandy.Mr.Willoughby, I presume?I said to this apparition, keeping a wary eye out for further tricks.He appeared to recognize his name, for he grinned and nodded madly at me, his eyes creased to gleaming slits.He pointed to himself, said something in Chinese, and then sprang into the air and executed several backflips in rapid succession, bobbing up on his feet in beaming triumph at the end.Bloody flea.Jamie got up, wiping the skinned palms of his hands gingerly on his coat.With a quick snatch, he caught hold of the Chinamans collar and jerked him off his feet.Come on, he said, parking the little man on the stairway and prodding him firmly in the back.We need to be going, and quick now.In response, the little blue clad figure promptly sagged into limpness, looking like a bag of laundry resting on the step.Hes all right when hes sober, Jamie explained apologetically to me, as he hoisted the Chinese over one shoulder.But he really shouldna drink brandy.Hes a terrible sot.So I see.Where on earth did you get him?Fascinated, I followed Jamie up the stairs, watching Mr.Willoughbys pigtail swing back and forth like a metronome across the felted gray wool of Jamies cloak.On the docks.But before he could explain further, the door above opened, and we were back in the taverns kitchen.The stout proprietor saw us emerge, and came toward us, her fat cheeks puffed with disapproval.Now, Mr.Malcolm, she began, frowning, ye ken verra weel as youre welcome here, and yell ken as weel that Im no a fussy woman, such not bein a convenient attitude when maintainin a public hoose.But Ive telt ye before, yon wee yellow mannie is no  Aye, yeve mentioned it, Mrs.Patterson, Jamie interrupted.He dug in his pocket and came up with a coin, which he handed to the stout publican with a bow.And your forbearance is much appreciated.It willna happen again.I hope, he added under his breath.He placed his hat on his head, bowed again to Mrs.Patterson, and ducked under the low lintel into the main tavern.Our reentry caused another stir, but a negative one this time.People fell silent, or muttered half heard curses under their breath.I gathered that Mr.Willoughby was perhaps not this locals most popular patron.Jamie edged his way through the crowd, which gave way reluctantly.I followed as best I could, trying not to meet anyones eyes, and trying not to breathe.Unused as I was to the unhygienic miasma of the eighteenth century, the stench of so many unwashed bodies in a small space was nearly overwhelming.Near the door, though, we met trouble, in the person of a buxom young woman whose dress was a notch above the sober drab of the landlady and her daughter.Her neckline was a notch lower, and I hadnt much trouble in guessing her principal occupation.Absorbed in flirtatious conversation with a couple of apprentice lads when we emerged from the kitchen, she looked up as we passed, and sprang to her feet with a piercing scream, knocking over a cup of ale in the process.Its him!she screeched, pointing a wavering finger at Jamie.The foul fiend!Her eyes seemed to have trouble focusing; I gathered that the spilled ale wasnt her first of the evening, early as it was.Her companions stared at Jamie with interest, the more so when the young lady advanced, stabbing her finger in the air like one leading a chorus.Him!The wee poolie I telt ye ofhim that did the disgustin thing to me!I joined the rest of the crowd in looking at Jamie with interest, but quickly realized, as did they, that the young woman was not talking to him, but rather to his burden.Ye neffit qurd!she yelled, addressing her remarks to the seat of Mr.Willoughbys blue silk trousers.Hiddie pyke!Slug!This spectacle of maidenly distress was rousing her companions; one, a tall, burly lad, stood up, fists clenched, and leaned on the table, eyes gleaming with ale and aggro.Shim, aye?Shall I knivvle him for ye, Maggie?Dinna try, laddie, Jamie advised him shortly, shifting his burden for better balance.Drink your drink, and well be gone.Oh, aye?And youre the little keds pimpmaster, are ye?The lad sneered unbecomingly, his flushed face turning in my direction.At least your other whores no yellowles ha a look at her.He flung out a paw and grabbed the edge of my cloak, revealing the low bodice of the Jessica Gutenburg.Looks pink enough to me, said his friend, with obvious approval.Is she like it all over?Before I could move, he snatched at the bodice, catching the edge of the lace.Not designed for the rigors of eighteenth century life, the flimsy fabric ripped halfway down the side, exposing quite a lot of pink.Leave off, ye whoreson!Jamie swung about, eyes blazing, free fist doubled in threat.Who ye miscallin, ye skrae shankit skoot?The first youth, unable to get out from behind the table, leapt on top of it, and launched himself at Jamie, who neatly sidestepped the lad, allowing him to crash face first into the wall.Jamie took one giant step toward the table, brought his fist down hard on top of the other apprentices head, making the lads jaw go slack, then grabbed me by the hand and dragged me out the door.Come on!he said, grunting as he shifted the Chinamans slippery form for a better grip.Theyll be after us any moment!They were; I could hear the shouting as the more boisterous elements poured out of the tavern into the street behind us.Jamie took the first opening off the Royal Mile, into a narrow, dark wynd, and we splashed through mud and unidentifiable slops, ducked through an archway, and down another twisting alleyway that seemed to lead through the bowels of Edinburgh.Dark walls flashed past, and splintered wooden doors, and then we were round a corner, in a small courtyard, where we paused for breath.Whaton earthdid he do?I gasped.I couldnt imagine what the little Chinese could have done to a strapping young wench like the recent Maggie.From all appearances, she could have squashed him like a fly.Well, its the feet, ye ken, Jamie explained, with a glance of resigned irritation at Mr.Willoughby.Feet?I glanced involuntarily at the tiny Chinese mans feet, neat miniatures shod in felt soled black satin.Not his, Jamie said, catching my glance.The womens.What women?I asked.Well, so far its only been whores, he said, glancing through the archway in search of pursuit, but ye canna tell what he may try.No judgment, he explained briefly.Hes a heathen.I see, I said, though so far, I didnt.What  There they are!A shout at the far end of the alley interrupted my question.Damn, I thought theyd give it up.Come on, this way!We were off once more, down an alley, back onto the Royal Mile, a few steps down the hill, and back into a close.I could hear shouts and cries behind us on the main street, but Jamie grasped my arm and jerked me after him through an open doorway, into a yard full of casks, bundles, and crates.He looked frantically about, then heaved Mr.Willoughbys limp body into a large barrel filled with rubbish.Pausing only long enough to drop a piece of canvas on the Chineses head for concealment, he dragged me behind a wagon loaded with crates, and pulled me down beside him.I was gasping from the unaccustomed exertion, and my heart was racing from the adrenaline of fear.Jamies face was flushed with cold and exercise, and his hair was sticking up in several directions, but he was scarcely breathing hard.Do you do this sort of thing all the time?I asked, pressing a hand to my bosom in a vain effort to make my heart slow down.Not exactly, he said, peering warily over the top of the wagon in search of pursuit.The echo of pounding feet came faintly, then disappeared, and everything was quiet, save for the patter of rain on the boxes above us.Theyve gone past.Wed best stay here a bit, to make sure, though.He lifted down a crate for me to sit on, procured another for himself, and sat down sighing, pushing the loose hair out of his face with one hand.He gave me a lopsided smile.Im sorry, Sassenach.I didna think it would be quite so  Eventful?I finished for him.I smiled back and pulled out a handkerchief to wipe a drop of moisture from the end of my nose.Its all right.I glanced at the large barrel, where stirrings and rustlings indicated that Mr.Willoughby was returning to a more or less conscious state.Erhow do you know about the feet?He told me; hes a taste for the drink, ye ken, he explained, with a glance at the barrel where his colleague lay concealed.And when hes taken a drop too much, he starts talkin about womens feet, and all the horrible things he wants to do wi them.What sort of horrible things can you do with a foot?I was fascinated.Surely the possibilities are limited.No, they arent, Jamie said grimly.But it isna something I want to be talking about in the public street.A faint singsong came from the depths of the barrel behind us.It was hard to tell, amid the natural inflections of the language, but I thought Mr.Willoughby was asking a question of some sort.Shut up, ye wee poutworm, Jamie said rudely.Another word, and Ill walk on your damn face myself; see how ye like that.There was a high pitched giggle, and the barrel fell silent.He wants someone to walk on his face?I asked.Aye.You, Jamie said briefly.He shrugged apologetically, and his cheeks flushed a deeper red.I hadna time to tell him who ye were.Does he speak English?Oh, aye, in a way, but not many people understand him when he does.I mostly talk to him in Chinee.I stared at him.You speak Chinese?He shrugged, tilting his head with a faint smile.Well, I speak Chinee about as well as Mr.Willoughby speaks English, but then, he hasna got all that much choice in who he talks to, so he puts up wi me.My heart showed signs of returning to normal, and I leaned back against the wagon bed, my hood farther forward against the drizzle.Where on earth did he get a name like Willoughby?I asked.While I was curious about the Chinese, I was even more curious about what a respectable Edinburgh printer was doing with one, but I felt a certain hesitance in prying into Jamies life.Freshly returned from the supposed deador its equivalentI could hardly demand to know all the details of his life on the spot.Jamie rubbed a hand across his nose.Aye, well.Its only that his real names Yi Tien Cho.He says it means Leans against heaven.Too hard for the local Scots to pronounce?Knowing the insular nature of most Scots, I wasnt surprised that they were disinclined to venture into strange linguistic waters.Jamie, with his gift for tongues, was a genetic anomaly.He smiled, teeth a white gleam in the gathering darkness.Well, its no that, so much.Its only, if ye say his name just a wee bit off, like, it sounds verra much like a coarse word in Gaelic.I thought Willoughby would maybe do better.I see.I thought perhaps under the circumstances, I shouldnt ask just what the indelicate Gaelic word was.I glanced over my shoulder, but the coast seemed clear.Jamie caught the gesture and rose, nodding.Aye, we can go now; the lads will ha gone back to the tavern by now.Wont we have to pass by The Worlds End on the way back to the printshop?I asked dubiously.Or is there a back way?It was full dark by now, and the thought of stumbling through the middens and muddy back passages of Edinburgh was unappealing.Ahno.We willna be going to the printshop.I couldnt see his face, but there seemed a certain reserve in his manner.Perhaps he had a residence somewhere else in the city?I felt a certain hollowness at the prospect; the room above the printshop was very clearly a monks cell; but perhaps he had an entire house somewhere elsewith a family in it?There had been no time for any but the most essential exchange of information at the printshop.I had no way of knowing what he had done over the last twenty years, or what he might now be doing.Still, he had plainly been gladto say the leastto see me, and the air of frowning consideration he now bore might well have to do with his inebriated associate, rather than with me.He bent over the barrel, saying something in Scots accented Chinese.This was one of the odder sounds I had ever heard; rather like the squeaks of a bagpipe tuning up, I thought, vastly entertained by the performance.Whatever hed said, Mr.Willoughby replied to it volubly, interrupting himself with giggles and snorts.At last, the little Chinese climbed out of the barrel, his diminutive figure silhouetted by the light of a distant lantern in the alleyway.He sprang down with fair agility and promptly prostrated himself on the ground before me.Bearing in mind what Jamie had told me about the feet, I took a quick step back, but Jamie laid a reassuring hand on my arm.Nay, its all right, Sassenach, he said.Hes only makin amends for his disrespect to ye earlier.Oh.Well.I looked dubiously at Mr.Willoughby, who was gabbling something to the ground under his face.At a loss for the proper etiquette, I stooped down and patted him on the head.Evidently that was all right, for he leapt to his feet and bowed to me several times, until Jamie told him impatiently to stop, and we made our way back to the Royal Mile.The building Jamie led us to was discreetly hidden down a small close just above the Kirk of the Canongate, perhaps a quarter mile above Holyrood Palace.I saw the lanterns mounted by the gates of the palace below, and shivered slightly at the sight.We had lived with Charles Stuart in the palace for nearly five weeks, in the early, victorious phase of his short career.Jamies uncle, Colum MacKenzie, had died there.The door opened to Jamies knock, and all thoughts of the past vanished.The woman who stood peering out at us, candle in hand, was petite, dark haired and elegant.Seeing Jamie, she drew him in with a glad cry, and kissed his cheek in greeting.My insides squeezed tight as a fist, but then relaxed again, as I heard him greet her as Madame Jeanne.Not what one would call a wifenor yet, I hoped, a mistress.Still, there was something about the woman that made me uneasy.She was clearly French, though she spoke English wellnot so odd; Edinburgh was a seaport, and a fairly cosmopolitan city.She was dressed soberly, but richly, in heavy silk cut with a flair, but she wore a good deal more rouge and powder than the average Scotswoman.What disturbed me was the way she was looking at mefrowning, with a palpable air of distaste.Monsieur Fraser, she said, touching Jamie on the shoulder with a possessive air that I didnt like at all, if I might have a word in private with you?Jamie, handing his cloak to the maid who came to fetch it, took a quick look at me, and read the situation at once.Of course, Madame Jeanne, he said courteously, reaching out a hand to draw me forward.But firstallow me to introduce my wife, Madame Fraser.My heart stopped beating for a moment, then resumed, with a force that I was sure was audible to everyone in the small entry hall.Jamies eyes met mine, and he smiled, the grip of his fingers tightening on my arm.Yourwife?I couldnt tell whether astonishment or horror was more pronounced on Madame Jeannes face.But Monsieur Fraseryou bring her here?I thoughta womanwell enough, but to insult our own jeune filles is not goodbut thena wife Her mouth hung open unbecomingly, displaying several decayed molars.Then she shook herself suddenly back into an attitude of flustered poise, and inclined her head to me with an attempt at graciousness.BonsoirMadame.Likewise, Im sure, I said politely.Is my room ready, Madame?Jamie said.Without waiting for an answer, he turned toward the stair, taking me with him.We shall be spending the night.He glanced back at Mr.Willoughby, who had come in with us.He had sat down at once on the floor, where he sat dripping rain, a dreamy expression on his small, flat face.Er?Jamie made a small questioning motion toward Mr.Willoughby, his eyebrows raised at Madame Jeanne.She stared at the little Chinese for a moment as though wondering where he had come from, then, returned to herself, clapped her hands briskly for the maid.See if Mademoiselle Josie is at liberty, if you please, Pauline, she said.And then fetch up hot water and fresh towels for Monsieur Fraser and hiswife.She spoke the word with a sort of stunned amazement, as though she still didnt quite believe it.Oh, and one more thing, if you would be so kind, Madame?Jamie leaned over the banister, smiling down at her.My wife will require a fresh gown; she has had an unfortunate accident to her wardrobe.If you could provide something suitable by morning?Thank you, Madame Jeanne.Bonsoir!I didnt speak, as I followed him up four flights of winding stairs to the top of the house.I was much too busy thinking, my mind in a whirl.Pimpmaster, the lad in the pub had called him.But surely that was only an epithetsuch a thing was absolutely impossible.For the Jamie Fraser I had known, it was impossible, I corrected myself, looking up at the broad shoulders under the dark gray serge coat.But for this man?I didnt know quite what I had been expecting, but the room was quite ordinary, small and cleanthough that was extraordinary, come to think of itfurnished with a stool, a simple bed and chest of drawers, upon which stood a basin and ewer and a clay candlestick with a beeswax candle, which Jamie lighted from the taper he had carried up.He shucked off his wet coat and draped it carelessly on the stool, then sat down on the bed to remove his wet shoes.God, he said, Im starving.I hope the cooks not gone to bed yet.Jamie I said.Take off your cloak, Sassenach, he said, noticing me still standing against the door.Youre soaked.Yes.Wellyes.I swallowed, then went on.Theres justerJamie, why have you got a regular room in a brothel?I burst out.He rubbed his chin, looking mildly embarrassed.Im sorry, Sassenach, he said.I know it wasna right to bring ye here, but it was the only place I could think of where we might get your dress mended at short notice, besides finding a hot supper.And then I had to put Mr.Willoughby where he wouldna get in more trouble, and as we had to come here anywaywellhe glanced at the bedits a good deal more comfortable than my cot at the printshop.But perhaps it was a poor idea.We can leave, if ye feel its not  I dont mind about that, I interrupted.The question iswhy have you got a room in a brothel?Are you such a good customer that  A customer?He stared up at me, eyebrows raised.Here?God, Sassenach, what dye think I am?Damned if I know, I said.Thats why Im asking.Are you going to answer my question?He stared at his stockinged feet for a moment, wiggling his toes on the floorboard.At last he looked up at me, and answered calmly, I suppose so.Im not a customer of Jeannes, but shes a customer of mineand a good one.She keeps a room for me because Im often abroad late on business, and Id as soon have a place I can come to where I can have food and a bed at any hour, and privacy.The room is part of my arrangement with her.I had been holding my breath.Now I let out about half of it.All right, I said.Then I suppose the next question is, what business has the owner of a brothel got with a printer?The absurd thought that perhaps he printed advertising circulars for Madame Jeanne flitted through my brain, to be instantly dismissed.Well, he said slowly.No.I dinna think thats the question.Its not?No.With one fluid move, he was off the bed and standing in front of me, close enough for me to have to look up into his face.I had a sudden urge to take a step backward, but didnt, largely because there wasnt room.The question is, Sassenach, why have ye come back?he said softly.Thats a hell of a question to ask me!My palms pressed flat against the rough wood of the door.Why do you think I came back, damn you?I dinna ken.The soft Scottish voice was cool, but even in the dim light, I could see the pulse throbbing in the open throat of his shirt.Did ye come to be my wife again?Or only to bring me word of my daughter?As though he sensed that his nearness unnerved me, he turned away suddenly, moving toward the window, where the shutters creaked in the wind.You are the mother of my childfor that alone, I owe ye my soulfor the knowledge that my life hasna been in vainthat my child is safe.He turned again to face me, blue eyes intent.But it has been a time, Sassenach, since you and I were one.Youll have had your lifethenand I have had mine here.Youll know nothing of what Ive done, or been.Did ye come now because ye wanted toor because ye felt ye must?My throat felt tight, but I met his eyes.I came now because beforeI thought you were dead.I thought youd died at Culloden.His eyes dropped to the windowsill, where he picked at a splinter.Aye, I see, he said softly.WellI meant to be dead.He smiled, without humor, eyes intent on the splinter.I tried hard enough.He looked up at me again.How did ye find out I hadna died?Or where I was, come to that?I had help.A young historian named Roger Wakefield found the records; he tracked you to Edinburgh.And when I saw A.  Malcolm, I knewI thoughtit might be you, I ended lamely.Time enough for the details later.Aye, I see.And then ye came.But stillwhy?I stared at him without speaking for a moment.As though he felt the need of air, or perhaps only for something to do, he fumbled with the latch of the shutters and thrust them halfway open, flooding the room with the sound of rushing water, and the cold, fresh smell of rain.Are you trying to tell me you dont want me to stay?I said, finally.Because if soI mean, I know youll have a life nowmaybe you haveother ties With unnaturally acute senses, I could hear the small sounds of activity throughout the house below, even above the rush of the storm, and the pounding of my own heart.My palms were damp, and I wiped them surreptitiously against my skirt.He turned from the window to stare at me.Christ!he said.Not want ye?His face was pale now, and his eyes unnaturally bright.I have burned for you for twenty years, Sassenach, he said softly.Do ye not know that?Jesus!The breeze stirred the loose wisps of hair around his face, and he brushed them back impatiently.But Im no the man ye knew, twenty years past, am I?He turned away, with a gesture of frustration.We know each other now less than we did when we wed.Do you want me to go?The blood was pounding thickly in my ears.No!He swung quickly toward me, and gripped my shoulder tightly, making me pull back involuntarily.No, he said, more quietly.I dinna want ye to go.I told ye so, and I meant it.ButI must know.He bent his head toward me, his face alive with troubled question.Do ye want me?he whispered.Sassenach, will ye take meand risk the man that I am, for the sake of the man ye knew?I felt a great wave of relief, mingled with fear.It ran from his hand on my shoulder to the tips of my toes, weakening my joints.Its a lot too late to ask that, I said, and reached to touch his cheek, where the rough beard was starting to show.It was soft under my fingers, like stiff plush.Because Ive already risked everything I had.But whoever you are now, Jamie Fraseryes.Yes, I do want you.The light of the candle flame glowed blue in his eyes, as he held out his hands to me, and I stepped wordless into his embrace.I rested my face against his chest, marveling at the feel of him in my arms; so big, so solid and warm.Real, after the years of longing for a ghost I could not touch.Disentangling himself after a moment, he looked down at me, and touched my cheek, very gently.He smiled slightly.Youve the devils own courage, aye?But then, ye always did.I tried to smile at him, but my lips trembled.What about you?How do you know what Im like?You dont know what Ive been doing for the last twenty years, either.I might be a horrible person, for all you know!The smile on his lips moved into his eyes, lighting them with humor.I suppose ye might, at that.But, dye know, SassenachI dinna think I care?I stood looking at him for another minute, then heaved a deep sigh that popped a few more stitches in my gown.Neither do I.   It seemed absurd to be shy with him, but shy I was.The adventures of the evening, and his words to me, had opened up the chasm of realitythose twenty unshared years that gaped between us, and the unknown future that lay beyond.Now we had come to the place where we would begin to know each other again, and discover whether we were in fact the same two who had once existed as one fleshand whether we might be one again.A knock at the door broke the tension.It was a small servingmaid, with a tray of supper.She bobbed shyly to me, smiled at Jamie, and laid both suppercold meat, hot broth, and warm oatbread with butterand the fire with a quick and practiced hand, then left us with a murmured Good een to ye.We ate slowly, talking carefully only of neutral things; I told him how I had made my way from Craigh na Dun to Inverness, and made him laugh with stories of Mr.Graham and Master Georgie.He in turn told me about Mr.Willoughby; how he had found the little Chinese, half starved and dead drunk, lying behind a row of casks on the docks at Burntisland, one of the shipping ports near Edinburgh.We said nothing much of ourselves, but as we ate, I became increasingly conscious of his body, watching his fine, long hands as he poured wine and cut meat, seeing the twist of his powerful torso under his shirt, and the graceful line of neck and shoulder as he stooped to retrieve a fallen napkin.Once or twice, I thought I saw his gaze linger on me in the same waya sort of hesitant aviditybut he quickly glanced away each time, hooding his eyes so that I could not tell what he saw or felt.As the supper concluded, the same thought was uppermost in both our minds.It could scarcely be otherwise, considering the place in which we found ourselves.A tremor of mingled fear and anticipation shot through me.At last, he drained his wineglass, set it down, and met my eyes directly.Will ye He stopped, the flush deepening on his features, but met my eyes, swallowed once, and went on.Will ye come to bed wi me, then?I mean, he hurried on, its cold, and were both damp, and  And there arent any chairs, I finished for him.All right.I pulled my hand loose from his, and turned toward the bed, feeling a queer mix of excitement and hesitance that made my breath come short.He pulled off his breeches and stockings quickly, then glanced at me.Im sorry, Sassenach; I should have thought yed need help wi your laces.So he didnt undress women often, I thought, before I could stop myself, and my lips curved in a smile at the thought.Well, its not laces, I murmured, but if youd give a hand in the back there I laid aside my cloak, and turned my back to him, lifting my hair to expose the neck of the dress.There was a puzzled silence.Then I felt a finger sliding slowly down the groove of my backbone.Whats that?he said, sounding startled.Its called a zipper, I said, smiling, though he couldnt see me.See the little tab at the top?Just take hold of that, and pull it straight down.The zipper teeth parted with a muted ripping noise, and the remnants of Jessica Gutenburg sagged free.I pulled my arms out of the sleeves and let the dress drop heavily around my feet, turning to face Jamie before I lost my nerve.He jerked back, startled by this sudden chrysalis shedding.Then he blinked, and stared at me.I stood in front of him in nothing but my shoes and gartered rose silk stockings.I had an overwhelming urge to snatch the dress back up, but I resisted it.I stiffened my spine, raised my chin, and waited.He didnt say a word.His eyes gleamed in the candlelight as he moved his head slightly, but he still had that trick of hiding all his thoughts behind an inscrutable mask.Will you bloody say something?I demanded at last, in a voice that shook only a little.His mouth opened, but no words came out.He shook his head slowly from side to side.Jesus, he whispered at last.Claireyou are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.You, I said with conviction, are losing your eyesight.Its probably glaucoma; youre too young for cataracts.He laughed at that, a little unsteadily, and then I saw that he was in fact blindedhis eyes shone with moisture, even as he smiled.He blinked hard, and held out his hand.I, he said, with equal conviction, ha got eyes like a hawk, and always did.Come here to me.A little reluctantly, I took his hand, and stepped out of the inadequate shelter of the remains of my dress.He drew me gently in, to stand between his knees as he sat on the bed.Then he kissed me softly, once on each breast, and laid his head between them, his breath coming warm on my bare skin.Your breast is like ivory, he said softly, the word almost breest in the Highland Scots that always grew broad when he was truly moved.His hand rose to cup one breast, his fingers tanned into darkness against my own pale glow.Only to see them, sae full and sae roundChrist, I could lay my head here forever.But to touch ye, my Sassenachyou wi your skin like white velvet, and the sweet long lines of your body He paused, and I could feel the working of his throat muscles as he swallowed, his hand moving slowly down the curving slope of waist and hip, the swell and taper of buttock and thigh.Dear God, he said, still softly.I couldna look at ye, Sassenach, and keep my hands from you, nor have ye near me, and not want ye.He lifted his head then, and planted a kiss over my heart, then let his hand float down the gentle curve of my belly, lightly tracing the small marks left there by Briannas birth.Youreally dont mind?I said hesitantly, brushing my own fingers over my stomach.He smiled up at me with something half rueful in his expression.He hesitated for a moment, then drew up the hem of his shirt.Do you?he asked.The scar ran from midthigh nearly to his groin, an eight inch length of twisted, whitish tissue.I couldnt repress a gasp at its appearance, and dropped to my knees beside him.I laid my cheek on his thigh, holding tight to his leg, as though I would keep him nowas I had not been able to keep him then.I could feel the slow, deep pulse of the blood through his femoral artery under my fingersa bare inch away from the ugly gully of that twisting scar.It doesna fright ye, nor sicken ye, Sassenach?he asked, laying a hand on my hair.I lifted my head and stared up at him.Of course not!Aye, well.He reached to touch my stomach, his eyes holding mine.And if ye bear the scars of your own battles, Sassenach, he said softly, they dinna trouble me, either.He lifted me to the bed beside him then, and leaned to kiss me.I kicked off my shoes, and curled my legs up, feeling the warmth of him through his shirt.My hands found the button at the throat, fumbling to open it.I want to see you.Well, its no much to see, Sassenach, he said, with an uncertain laugh.But whatever it is, its yoursif ye want it.He pulled the shirt over his head and tossed it on the floor, then leaned back on the palms of his hands, displaying his body.I didnt know quite what I had been expecting.In fact, the sight of his naked body took my breath away.He was still tall, of course, and beautifully made, the long bones of his body sleek with muscle, elegant with strength.He glowed in the candlelight, as though the light came from within him.He had changed, of course, but the change was subtle; as though he had been put into an oven and baked to a hard finish.He looked as though both muscle and skin had drawn in just a bit, grown closer to the bone, so he was more tightly knit; he had never seemed gawky, but the last hint of boyish looseness had vanished.His skin had darkened slightly, to a pale gold, burned to bronze on face and throat, paling down the length of his body to a pure white, tinged with blue veins, in the hollow of his thighs.His pubic hair stood out in a ferocious auburn bush, and it was quite obvious that he had not been lying; he did want me, and very badly.My eyes met his, and his mouth quirked suddenly.I did say once I would be honest with ye, Sassenach.I laughed, feeling tears sting my eyes at the same time, a rush of confused emotion surging up in me.So did I.  I reached toward him, hesitant, and he took my hand.The strength and warmth of it were startling, and I jerked slightly.Then I tightened my grasp, and he rose to his feet, facing me.We stood still then, awkwardly hesitating.We were intensely aware of each otherhow could we not be?It was quite a small room, and the available atmosphere was completely filled with a charge like static electricity, almost strong enough to be visible.I had a feeling of empty bellied terror, like the sort you get at the top of a roller coaster.Are you as scared as I am?I finally said, sounding hoarse to my own ears.He looked me over carefully, and raised one eyebrow.I dinna think I can be, he said.Youre covered wi gooseflesh.Are ye scairt, Sassenach, or only cold?Both, I said, and he laughed.Get in, then, he said.He released my hand and bent to turn back the quilt.I didnt stop shaking when he slid under the quilt beside me, though the heat of his body was a physical shock.God, youre not cold!I blurted.I turned toward him, and the warmth of him shimmered against my skin from head to toes.Instinctively drawn, I pressed close against him, shivering.I could feel my nipples tight and hard against his chest, and the sudden shock of his naked skin against my own.He laughed a little uncertainly.No, Im not.I suppose I must be afraid, aye?His arms came around me, gently, and I touched his chest, feeling hundreds of tiny goose bumps spring up under my fingertips, among the ruddy curling hairs.When we were afraid of each other before, I whispered, on our wedding nightyou held my hands.You said it would be easier if we touched.He made a small sound as my fingertip found his nipple.Aye, I did, he said, sounding breathless.Lord, touch me like that again.His hands tightened suddenly, holding me against him.Touch me, he said again softly, and let me touch you, my Sassenach.His hand cupped me, stroking, touching, and my breast lay taut and heavy in his palm.I went on trembling, but now he was doing it, too.When we wed, he whispered, his breath warm against my cheek, and I saw ye there, so bonny in your white dressI couldna think of anything but when wed be alone, and I could undo your laces and have ye naked, next to me in the bed.Do you want me now?I whispered, and kissed the sunburned flesh in the hollow above his collarbone.His skin was faintly salty to the taste, and his hair smelled of woodsmoke and pungent maleness.He didnt answer, but moved abruptly, so I felt the hardness of him, stiff against my belly.It was terror as much as desire that pressed me close against him.I wanted him, all right; my breasts ached and my belly was tight with it, the unaccustomed rush of arousal slippery between my legs, opening me for him.But as strong as lust, was the desire simply to be taken, to have him master me, quell my doubts in a moment of rough usage, take me hard and swiftly enough to make me forget myself.I could feel the urge to do it tremble in the hands that cupped my buttocks, in the involuntary jerk of his hips, brought up short as he stopped himself.Do it, I thought, in an agony of apprehension.For Gods sake, do it now and dont be gentle!I couldnt say it.I saw the need of it on his face, but he couldnt say it, either; it was both too soon and too late for such words between us.But we had shared another language, and my body still recalled it.I pressed my hips against him sharply, grasping his, the curves of his buttocks clenched hard under my hands.I turned my face upward, urgent to be kissed, at the same moment that he bent abruptly to kiss me.My nose hit his forehead with a sickening crunch.My eyes watered profusely as I rolled away from him, clutching my face.Ow!Christ, have I hurt ye, Claire?Blinking away the tears, I could see his face, hovering anxiously over me.No, I said stupidly.My nose is broken, though, I think.No, it isnt, he said, gently feeling the bridge of my nose.When ye break your nose, it makes a nasty crunching sound, and ye bleed like a pig.Its all right.I felt gingerly beneath my nostrils, but he was right; I wasnt bleeding.The pain had receded quickly, too.As I realized that, I also realized that he was lying on me, my legs sprawled wide beneath him, his cock just touching me, no more than a hairsbreadth from the moment of decision.I saw the realization dawn in his eyes as well.Neither of us moved, barely breathing.Then his chest swelled as he took a deep breath, reached and took both my wrists in one hand.He pulled them up, over my head, and held me there, my body arched taut and helpless under him.Give me your mouth, Sassenach, he said softly, and bent to me.His head blotted out the candlelight, and I saw nothing but a dim glow and the darkness of his flesh as his mouth touched mine.Gently, brushing, then pressing, warm, and I opened to him with a little gasp, his tongue seeking mine.I bit his lip, and he drew back a little, startled.Jamie, I said against his lips, my own breath warm between us.Jamie!That was all I could say, but my hips jerked against him, and jerked again, urging violence.I turned my head and fastened my teeth in the flesh of his shoulder.He made a small sound deep in his throat and came into me hard.I was tight as any virgin and cried out, arching under him.Dont stop!I said.For Gods sake, dont stop!His body heard me and answered in the same language, his grasp of my wrists tightening as he plunged hard into me, the force of it reaching my womb with each stroke.Then he let go of my wrists and half fell on me, the weight of him pinning me to the bed as he reached under, holding my hips hard, keeping me immobile.I whimpered and writhed against him, and he bit my neck.Be still, he said in my ear.I was still, only because I couldnt move.We lay pressed tight together, shuddering.I could feel the pounding against my ribs, but didnt know whether it was my heart, or his.Then he moved in me, very slightly, a question of the flesh.It was enough; I convulsed in answer, held helpless under him, and felt the spasms of my release stroke him, stroke him, seize and release him, urging him to join me.He reared up on both hands, back arched and head thrown back, eyes closed and breathing hard.Then very slowly, he bent his head forward and opened his eyes.He looked down at me with unutterable tenderness, and the candlelight gleamed briefly on the wetness on his cheek, maybe sweat or maybe tears.Oh, Claire, he whispered.Oh, God, Claire.And his release began, deep inside me, without his moving, shivering through his body so that his arms trembled, the ruddy hairs quivering in the dim light, and he dropped his head with a sound like a sob, his hair hiding his face as he spilled himself, each jerk and pulse of his flesh between my legs rousing an echo in my own.When it was over, he held himself over me, still as stone for a long moment.Then, very gently, he lowered himself, pressed his head against mine, and lay as if dead.I stirred at last from a deep, contented stupor, lifting my hand to lay it over the spot where his pulse beat slow and strong, just at the base of his breastbone.Its like bicycle riding, I expect, I said.My head rested peacefully in the curve of his shoulder, my hand idly playing with the red gold curls that sprang up in thickets across his chest.Did you know youve got lots more hairs on your chest than you used to?No, he said drowsily, I dinna usually count them.Have bye sickles got lots of hair, then?It caught me by surprise, and I laughed.No, I said.I just meant that we seemed to recall what to do all right.Jamie opened one eye and looked down at me consideringly.It would take a real daftie to forget that, Sassenach, he said.I may be lacking practice, but I havena lost all my faculties yet.We were still for a long time, aware of each others breathing, sensitive to each small twitch and shifting of position.We fitted well together, my head curled into the hollow of his shoulder, the territory of his body warm under my hand, both strange and familiar, awaiting rediscovery.The building was a solid one, and the sound of the storm outside drowned most noises from within, but now and then the sounds of feet or voices were dimly audible below us; a low, masculine laugh, or the higher voice of a woman, raised in professional flirtation.Hearing it, Jamie stirred a little uncomfortably.I should maybe have taken ye to a tavern, he said.Its only  Its all right, I assured him.Though I must say, of all the places Id imagined being with you again, I somehow never thought of a brothel.I hesitated, not wanting to pry, but curiosity got the best of me.Youerdont own this place, do you, Jamie?He pulled back a little, staring down at me.Me?God in heaven, Sassenach, what dye think I am?Well, I dont know, do I?I pointed out, with some asperity.The first thing you do when I find you is faint, and as soon as Ive got you back on your feet, you get me assaulted in a pub and chased through Edinburgh in company with a deviant Chinese, ending up in a brothelwhose madam seems to be on awfully familiar terms with you, I might add.The tips of his ears had gone pink, and he seemed to be struggling between laughter and indignation.You then take off your clothes, announce that youre a terrible person with a depraved past, and take me to bed.What did you expect me to think?Laughter won out.Well, Im no a saint, Sassenach, he said.But Im no a pimp, either.Glad to hear it, I said.There was a momentary pause, and then I said, Do you mean to tell me what you are, or shall I go on running down the disreputable possibilities until I come close?Oh, aye?he said, entertained by this suggestion.Whats your best guess?I looked him over carefully.He lay at ease amid the tumbled sheets, one arm behind his head, grinning at me.Well, Id bet my shift youre not a printer, I said.The grin widened.Why not?I poked him rudely in the ribs.Youre much too fit.Most men in their forties have begun to go soft round the middle, and you havent a spare ounce on you.Thats mostly because I havena got anyone to cook for me, he said ruefully.If you ate in taverns all the time, ye wouldna be fat, either.Luckily, it looks as though ye eat regularly.He patted my bottom familiarly, and then ducked, laughing, as I slapped at his hand.Dont try to distract me, I said, resuming my dignity.At any rate, you didnt get muscles like that slaving over a printing press.Ever tried to work one, Sassenach?He raised a derisive eyebrow.No.I furrowed my brow in thought.I dont suppose youve taken up highway robbery?No, he said, the grin widening.Guess again.Embezzlement.No.Well, likely not kidnapping for ransom, I said, and began to tick other possibilities off on my fingers.Petty thievery?No.Piracy?No, you couldnt possibly, unless youve got over being seasick.Usury?Hardly.I dropped my hand and stared at him.You were a traitor when I last knew you, but that scarcely seems a good way of making a living.Oh, Im still a traitor, he assured me.I just havena been convicted lately.Lately?I spent several years in prison for treason, Sassenach, he said, rather grimly.For the Rising.But that was some time back.Yes, I knew that.His eyes widened.Ye knew that?That and a bit more, I said.Ill tell you later.But putting that all aside for the present and returning to the point at issuewhat do you do for a living these days?Im a printer, he said, grinning widely.And a traitor?And a traitor, he confirmed, nodding.Ive been arrested for sedition six times in the last two years, and had my premises seized twice, but the court wasna able to prove anything.And what happens to you if they do prove it, one of these times?
