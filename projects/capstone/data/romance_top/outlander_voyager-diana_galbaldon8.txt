By way of Robert the Bruce and the storywhich your husband was inclined to think apocryphalregarding his inspiration to persevere in his quest for the throne of Scotland.Presumably, the Bruce was in hiding in a cave, pursued by his enemies, and  Yes, I know the story, I interrupted.It was Jamess opinion that spiders do not frequent caves in which humans dwell; an opinion with which I basically concurred, though pointing out that in the larger type of cave, such as occurs on this island  There are caves here?I was surprised, and then felt foolish.But of course, there must be, if there are cave fish, like the one in the spring.I always thought Caribbean islands were made of coral, though.I shouldnt have thought youd find caves in coral.Well, it is possible, though not highly likely, Stern said judiciously.However, the island of Hispaniola is not a coral atoll but is basically volcanic in originwith the addition of crystalline schists, fossiliferous sedimentary deposits of a considerable antiquity, and widespread deposits of limestone.The limestone is particularly karstic in spots.You dont say.I poured a fresh cup of spiced wine.Oh, yes.Lawrence leaned over to pick up his bag from the floor of the veranda.Pulling out a notebook, he tore a sheet of paper from it and crumpled it in his fist.There, he said, holding out his hand.The paper slowly unfolded itself, leaving a mazed topography of creases and crumpled peaks.That is what this island is likeyou remember what Father Fogden was saying about the Maroons?The runaway slaves who have taken refuge in these hills?It is not lack of pursuit on the part of their masters that allows them to vanish with such ease.There are many parts of this island where no manwhite or black, I daresayhas yet set foot.And in the lost hills, there are caves still more lost, whose existence no one knows save perhaps the aboriginal inhabitants of this placeand they are long gone, Mrs.Fraser.I have seen one such cave, he added reflectively.Abandawe, the Maroons call it.They consider it a most sinister and sacred spot, though I do not know why.Encouraged by my close attention, he took another gulp of sangria and continued his natural history lecture.Now that small islandhe nodded at the floating island visible in the sea beyondthat is the Ile de la TortueTortuga.That one is in fact a coral atoll, its lagoon long since filled in by the actions of the coral animalculae.Did you know it was once the haunt of pirates?he asked, apparently feeling that he ought to infuse his lecture with something of more general interest than karstic formations and crystalline schists.Real pirates?Buccaneers, you mean?I viewed the little island with more interest.Thats rather romantic.Stern laughed, and I glanced at him in surprise.I am not laughing at you, Mrs.Fraser, he assured me.A smile lingered on his lips as he gestured at the Ile de la Tortue.It is merely that I had occasion once to talk with an elderly resident of Kingston, regarding the habits of the buccaneers who had at one point made their headquarters in the nearby village of Port Royal.He pursed his lips, decided to speak, decided otherwise, then, with a sideways glance at me, decided to risk it.You will pardon the indelicacy, Mrs.Fraser, but as you are a married woman, and as I understand, have some familiarity with the practice of medicine He paused, and might have stopped there, but he had drunk nearly two thirds of the pitcher; the broad, pleasant face was deeply flushed.You have perhaps heard of the abominable practices of sodomy?he asked, looking at me sideways.I have, I said.Do you mean  I assure you, he said, with a magisterial nod.My informant was most discursive upon the habits of the buccaneers.Sodomites to a man, he said, shaking his head.What?It was a matter of public knowledge, he said.My informant told me that when Port Royal fell into the sea some sixty years ago, it was widely assumed to be an act of divine vengeance upon these wicked persons in retribution for their vile and unnatural usages.Gracious, I said.I wondered what the voluptuous Tessa of The Impetuous Pirate would have thought about this.He nodded, solemn as an owl.They say you can hear the bells of the drowned churches of Port Royal when a storm is coming, ringing for the souls of the damned pirates.I thought of inquiring further into the precise nature of the vile and unnatural usages, but at this point in the proceedings, Mamacita stumped out onto the veranda, said curtly, Food, and disappeared again.I wonder which cave Father Fogden found her in, I said, shoving back my chair.Stern glanced at me in surprise.Found her?But I forgot, he said, face clearing, you dont know.He peered at the open door where the old woman had vanished, but the interior of the house was quiet and dark as a cave.He found her in Habana, he said, and told me the rest of the story.Father Fogden had been a priest for ten years, a missionary of the order of St.Anselm, when he had come to Cuba fifteen years before.Devoted to the needs of the poor, he had worked among the slums and stews of Habana for several years, thinking of nothing more than the relief of suffering and the love of Goduntil the day he met Ermenegilda Ruiz Alcantara y Meroz in the marketplace.I dont suppose he knows, even now, how it happened, Stern said.He wiped away a drop of wine that ran down the side of his cup, and drank again.Perhaps she didnt know, either, or perhaps she planned it from the moment she saw him.In any case, six months later the city of Habana was agog at the news that the young wife of Don Armando Alcantara had run awaywith a priest.And her mother, I said, under my breath, but he heard me, and smiled slightly.Ermenegilda would never leave Mamacita behind, he said.Nor her dog Ludo.They would never have succeeded in escapingfor the reach of Don Armando was long and powerfulsave for the fact that the English conveniently chose the day of their elopement to invade the island of Cuba, and Don Armando had many things more important to worry him than the whereabouts of his runaway young wife.The fugitives rode to Bayamomuch hampered by Ermenegildas dresses, with which she would not partand there hired a fishing boat, which carried them to safety on Hispaniola.She died two years later, Stern said abruptly.He set down his cup, and refilled it from the sweating pitcher.He buried her himself, under the bougainvillaea.And here theyve stayed since, I said.The priest, and Ludo and Mamacita.Oh, yes.Stern closed his eyes, his profile dark against the setting sun.Ermenegilda would not leave Mamacita, and Mamacita will never leave Ermenegilda.He tossed back the rest of his cup of sangria.No one comes here, he said.The villagers wont set foot on the hill.Theyre afraid of Ermenegildas ghost.A damned sinner, buried by a reprobate priest in unhallowed groundof course she will not lie quiet.The sea breeze was cool on the back of my neck.Behind us, even the chickens in the patio had grown quiet with falling twilight.The Hacienda de la Fuente lay still.You come, I said, and he smiled.The scent of oranges rose up from the empty cup in my hands, sweet as bridal flowers.Ah, well, he said.I am a scientist.I dont believe in ghosts.He extended a hand to me, somewhat unsteadily.Shall we dine, Mrs.Fraser?After breakfast the next morning, Stern was ready to set off for St.Luis.Before leaving, though, I had a question or two about the ship the priest had mentioned; if it were the Porpoise, I wanted to steer clear of it.What sort of ship was it?I asked, pouring a cup of goats milk to go with the breakfast of fried plantain.Father Fogden, apparently little the worse for his excesses of the day before, was stroking his coconut, humming dreamily to himself.Ah?he said, startled out of his reverie by Sterns poking him in the ribs.I patiently repeated my query.Oh.He squinted in deep thought, then his face relaxed.A wooden one.Lawrence bent his broad face over his plate, hiding a smile.I took a breath and tried again.The sailors who killed Arabelladid you see them?His narrow brows rose.Well, of course I saw them.How else would I know they had done it?I seized on this evidence of logical thought.Naturally.And did you see what they were wearing?I meanI saw him opening his mouth to say clothes, and hastily forestalled himdid they seem to be wearing any sort of uniform?The crew of the Porpoise commonly wore slops when not performing any ceremonial duty, but even these rough clothes bore the semblance of a uniform, being mostly all of a dirty white and similar in cut.Father Fogden laid down his cup, leaving a milky mustache across his upper lip.He brushed at this with the back of his hand, frowning and shaking his head.No, I think not.All I recall of them, though, is that the leader wore a hookmissing a hand, I mean.He waggled his own long fingers at me in illustration.I dropped my cup, which exploded on the tabletop.Stern sprang up with an exclamation, but the priest sat still, watching in surprise as a thin white stream ran across the table and into his lap.Whatever did you do that for?he said reproachfully.Im sorry, I said.My hands were trembling so that I couldnt even manage to pick up the shards of the shattered cup.I was afraid to ask the next question.Fatherhas the ship sailed away?Why no, he said, looking up in surprise from his damp robe.How could it?Its on the beach.Father Fogden led the way, his skinny shanks a gleaming white as he kirtled his cassock about his thighs.I was obliged to do the same, for the hillside above the house was thick with grass and thorny shrubs that caught at the coarse wool skirts of my borrowed robe.The hill was crisscrossed with sheep paths, but these were narrow and faint, losing themselves under the trees and disappearing abruptly in thick grass.The priest seemed confident about his destination, though, and scampered briskly through the vegetation, never looking back.I was breathing hard by the time we reached the crest of the hill, even though Lawrence Stern had gallantly assisted me, pushing branches out of my way, and taking my arm to haul me up the steeper slopes.Do you think there really is a ship?I said to him, low voiced, as we approached the top of the hill.Given our hosts behavior so far, I wasnt so sure he might not have imagined it, just to be sociable.Stern shrugged, wiping a trickle of sweat that ran down his bronzed cheek.I suppose there will be something there, he replied.After all, there is a dead sheep.A qualm ran over me in memory of the late departed Arabella.Someone had killed the sheep, and I walked as quietly as I could, as we approached the top of the hill.It couldnt be the Porpoise; none of her officers or men wore a hook.I tried to tell myself that it likely wasnt the Artemis, either, but my heart beat still faster as we came to a stand of giant agave on the crest of the hill.I could see the Caribbean glowing blue through the succulents branches, and a narrow strip of white beach.Father Fogden had come to a halt, beckoning us to his side.There they are, the wicked creatures, he muttered.His blue eyes glittered bright with fury, and his scanty hair fairly bristled, like a moth eaten porcupine.Butchers!he said, hushed but vehement, as though talking to himself.Cannibals!I gave him a startled look, but then Lawrence Stern grasped my arm, drawing me to a wider opening between two trees.Oy!There is a ship, he said.There was.It was lying tilted on its side, drawn up on the beach, its masts unstepped, untidy piles of cargo, sails, rigging, and water casks scattered all about it.Men crawled over the beached carcass like ants.Shouts and hammer blows rang out like gunshots, and the smell of hot pitch was thick on the air.The unloaded cargo gleamed dully in the sun; copper and tin, slightly tarnished by the sea air.Tanned hides had been laid flat on the sand, brown stiff blotches drying in the sun.It is them!Its the Artemis!The matter was settled by the appearance near the hull of a squat, one legged figure, head shaded from the sun by a gaudy kerchief of yellow silk.Murphy!I shouted.Fergus!Jamie!I broke from Sterns grasp and ran down the far side of the hill, his cry of caution disregarded in the excitement of seeing the Artemis.Murphy whirled at my shout, but was unable to get out of my way.Carried by momentum and moving like a runaway freight, I crashed straight into him, knocking him flat.Murphy!I said, and kissed him, caught up in the joy of the moment.Hoy!he said, shocked.He wriggled madly, trying to get out from under me.Milady!Fergus appeared at my side, crumpled and vivid, his beautiful smile dazzling in a sun dark face.Milady!He helped me off the grunting Murphy, then grabbed me to him in a rib cracking hug.Marsali appeared behind him, a broad smile on her face.Merci aux les saints!he said in my ear.I was afraid we would never see you again!He kissed me heartily himself, on both cheeks and the mouth, then released me at last.I glanced at the Artemis, lying on her side on the beach like a stranded beetle.What on earth happened?Fergus and Marsali exchanged a glance.It was the sort of look in which questions are asked and answered, and it rather startled me to see the depths of intimacy between them.Fergus drew a deep breath and turned to me.Captain Raines is dead, he said.The storm that had come upon me during my night in the mangrove swamp had also struck the Artemis.Carried far off her path by the howling wind, she had been forced over a reef, tearing a sizable hole in her bottom.Still, she had remained afloat.The aft hold filling rapidly, she had limped toward the small inlet that opened so near, offering shelter.We were no more than three hundred yards from the shore when the accident happened, Fergus said, his face drawn by the memory.The ship had heeled suddenly over, as the contents of the aft hold had shifted, beginning to float.And just then, an enormous wave, coming from the sea, had struck the leaning ship, washing across the tilting quarterdeck, and carrying away Captain Raines, and four seamen with him.The shore was so near!Marsali said, her face twisted with distress.We were aground ten minutes later!If only  Fergus stopped her with a hand on her arm.We cannot guess Gods ways, he said.It would have been the same, if we had been a thousand miles at sea, save that we would not have been able to give them decent burial.He nodded toward the far edge of the beach, near the jungle, where five small mounds, topped with crude wooden crosses, marked the final resting places of the drowned men.I had some holy water that Da brought me from Notre Dame in Paris, Marsali said.Her lips were cracked, and she licked them.In a little bottle.I said a prayer, and sprinkled it on the graves.Dyedye think they would have l liked that?I caught the quaver in her voice, and realized that for all her self possession, the last two days had been a terrifying ordeal for the girl.Her face was grimy, her hair coming down, and the sharpness was gone from her eyes, softened by tears.Im sure they would, I said gently, patting her arm.I glanced at the faces crowding around, searching for Jamies great height and fiery head, even as the realization dawned that he was not there.Where is Jamie?I said.My face was flushed from the run down the hill.I felt the blood begin to drain from my cheeks, as a trickle of fear rose in my veins.Fergus was staring at me, lean face mirroring mine.He is not with you?he said.No.How could he be?The sun was blinding, but my skin felt cold.I could feel the heat shimmer over me, but to no effect.My lips were so chilled, I could scarcely form the question.Where is he?Fergus shook his head slowly back and forth, like an ox stunned by the slaughterers blow.I dont know.51  IN WHICH JAMIE SMELLS A RAT  Jamie Fraser lay in the shadows under the Porpoises jolly boat, chest heaving with effort.Getting aboard the man of war without being seen had been no small task; his right side was bruised from being slammed against the side of the ship as he hung from the boarding nets, struggling to pull himself up to the rail.His arms felt as though they had been jerked from their sockets and there was a large splinter in one hand.But he was here, and so far unseen.He chewed delicately at his palm, groping for the end of the splinter with his teeth, as he got his bearings.Russo and Stone, Artemis hands who had served aboard men of war, had spent hours describing to him the structure of a large ship, the compartments and decks, and the probable location of the surgeons quarters.Hearing something described and being able to find your way about in it were two different things, though.At least the miserable thing rocked less than the Artemis, though he could still feel the subtle, nauseating heave of the deck beneath him.The end of the splinter worked free; nipping it between his teeth, he drew it slowly out and spat it on the deck.He sucked the tiny wound, tasting blood, and slid cautiously out from under the jolly boat, ears pricked to catch the sound of an approaching footstep.The deck below this one, down the forward companionway.The officers quarters would be there, and with luck, the surgeons cabin as well.Not that she was likely to be in her quarters; not her.Shed cared enough to come tend the sickshe would be with them.He had waited until dark to have Robbie MacRae row him out.Raines had told him that the Porpoise would likely weigh anchor with the evening tide, two hours from now.If he could find Claire and escape over the side before thathe could swim ashore with her, easilythe Artemis would be waiting for them, concealed in a small cove on the other side of Caicos Island.If he couldntwell, he would deal with that when he came to it.Fresh from the cramped small world of the Artemis, the belowdecks of the Porpoise seemed huge and sprawling; a shadowed warren.He stood still, nostrils flaring as he deliberately drew the fetid air deep into his lungs.There were all the nasty stenches associated with a ship at sea for a long time, overlaid with the faint floating stink of feces and vomit.He turned to the left and began to walk softly, long nose twitching.Where the smell of sickness was the strongest; that was where he would find her.Four hours later, in mounting desperation, he made his way aft for the third time.He had covered the entire shipkeeping out of sight with some difficultyand Claire was nowhere to be found.Bloody woman!he said under his breath.Where have ye gone, ye fashious wee hidee?A small worm of fear gnawed at the base of his heart.She had said her vaccine would protect her from the sickness, but what if she had been wrong?He could see for himself that the man of wars crew had been badly diminished by the deadly sicknessknee deep in it, the germs might have attacked her too, vaccine or not.He thought of germs as small blind things, about the size of maggots, but equipped with vicious razor teeth, like tiny sharks.He could all too easily imagine a swarm of the things fastening onto her, killing her, draining her flesh of life.It was just such a vision that had made him pursue the Porpoisethat, and a murderous rage toward the English buggerer who had had the filth eating insolence to steal away his wife beneath his very nose, with a vague promise to return her, once theyd made use of her.Leave her to the Sassenachs, unprotected?Not bloody likely, he muttered under his breath, dropping down into a dark cargo space.She wouldnt be in such a place, of course, but he must think a moment, what to do.Was this the cable tier, the aft cargo hatch, the forward stinking God knew what?Christ, he hated boats!He drew in a deep breath and stopped, surprised.There were animals here; goats.He could smell them plainly.There was also a light, dimly visible around the edge of a bulkhead, and the murmur of voices.Was one of them a womans voice?He edged forward, listening.There were feet on the deck above, a patter and thump that he recognized; bodies dropping from the rigging.Had someone above seen him?Well, and if they had?It was no crime, so far as he knew, for a man to come seeking his wife.The Porpoise was asail; he had felt the thrum of the sails, passing through the wood all the way to the keel as she took the wind.They had long since missed the rendezvous with the Artemis.That being so, there was likely nothing to lose by appearing boldly before the captain and demanding to see Claire.But perhaps she was hereit was a womans voice.It was a womans figure, too, silhouetted against the lanterns light, but the woman wasnt Claire.His heart leapt convulsively at the gleam of the light on her hair, but then fell at once as he saw the thick, square shape of the woman by the goat pen.There was a man with her; as Jamie watched, the man bent and picked up a basket.He turned and came toward Jamie.He stepped into the narrow aisle between the bulkheads, blocking the seamans way.Here, what do you mean the man began, and then, raising his eyes to Jamies face, stopped, gasping.One eye was fixed on him in horrified recognition; the other showed only as a bluish white crescent beneath the withered lid.God preserve us!the seaman said.What are you doing here?The seamans face gleamed pale and jaundiced in the dim light.Ye ken me, do ye?Jamies heart was hammering against his ribs, but he kept his voice level and low.I have not the honor to know your own name, I think?I should prefer to leave that particular circumstance unchanged, your honor, if youve no objection.The one eyed seaman began to edge backward, but was forestalled as Jamie gripped his arm, hard enough to elicit a small yelp.Not quite so fast, if ye please.Where is Mrs.Malcolm, the surgeon?It would have been difficult for the seaman to look more alarmed, but at this question, he managed it.I dont know!he said.You do, Jamie said sharply.And yell tell me this minute, or I shall break your neck.Well, now, I cant be tellin you anything if you break my neck, can I?the seaman pointed out, beginning to recover his nerve.He lifted his chin pugnaciously over his basket of manure.Now, you leave go of me, or Ill call The rest was lost in a squawk as a large hand fastened about his neck and began inexorably to squeeze.The basket fell to the deck, and balls of goat manure exploded out of it like shrapnel.Ak!Harry Tompkinss legs thrashed wildly, scattering goat dung in every direction.His face turned the color of a beetroot as he clawed ineffectually at Jamies arm.Judging the results clinically, Jamie let go as the mans eye began to bulge.He wiped his hand on his breeches, disliking the greasy feel of the mans sweat on his palm.Tompkins lay on the deck in a sprawl of limbs, wheezing faintly.Yere quite right, Jamie said.On the other hand, if I break your arm, I expect youll still be able to speak to me, aye?He bent, grasped the man by one skinny arm and jerked him to his feet, twisting the arm roughly behind his back.Ill tell you, Ill tell you!The seaman wriggled madly, panicked.Damn you, youre as wicked cruel as she was!Was?What do you mean, was?Jamies heart squeezed tight in his chest, and he jerked the arm, more roughly than he had meant to do.Tompkins let out a screech of pain, and Jamie slackened the pressure slightly.Let go!Ill tell you, but for pitys sake, let go!Jamie lessened his grasp, but didnt let go.Tell me where my wife is!he said, in a tone that had made stronger men than Harry Tompkins fall over their feet to obey.Shes lost!the man blurted.Gone overboard!What!He was so stunned that he let go his hold.Overboard.Gone overboard.Lost.When?he demanded.How?Damn you, tell me what happened!He advanced on the seaman, fists clenched.The seaman was backing away, rubbing his arm and panting, a look of furtive satisfaction in his one eye.Dont worry, your honor, he said, a queer, jeering tone in his voice.You wont be lonesome long.Youll join her in hell in a few daysdancing from the yardarm over Kingston Harbor!Too late, Jamie heard the footfall on the boards behind him.He had no time even to turn his head before the blow fell.He had been struck in the head frequently enough to know that the sensible thing was to lie still until the giddiness and the lights that pulsed behind your eyelids with each heartbeat stopped.Sit up too soon and the pain made you vomit.The deck was rising and falling, rising and falling under him, in the horrible way of ships.He kept his eyes tight closed, concentrating on the knotted ache at the base of his skull in order not to think of his stomach.Ship.He should be on a ship.Yes, but the surface under his cheek was wronghard wood, not the linen of his berths bedding.And the smell, the smell was wrong, it was  He shot bolt upright, memory shooting through him with a vividness that made the pain in his head pale by comparison.The darkness moved queasily around him, blinking with colored lights, and his stomach heaved.He closed his eyes and swallowed hard, trying to gather his scattered wits about the single appalling thought that had lanced through his brain like a spit through mutton.Claire.Lost.Drowned.Dead.He leaned to the side and threw up.He retched and coughed, as though his body was trying forcibly to expel the thought.It didnt work; when he finally stopped, leaning against the bulkhead in exhaustion, it was still with him.It hurt to breathe, and he clenched his fists on his thighs, trembling.There was the sound of a door opening, and bright light struck him in the eyes with the force of a blow.He winced, closing his eyes against the glare of the lantern.Mr.Fraser, a soft, well bred voice said.I amtruly sorry.I wish you to know that, at least.Through a cracked eyelid, he saw the drawn, harried face of young Leonardthe man who had taken Claire.The man wore a look of regret.Regret!Regret, for killing her.Fury pulled him up against the weakness, and sent him lunging across the slanted deck in an instant.There was an outcry as he hit Leonard and bore him backward into the passage, and a good, juicy thunk!as the buggers head hit the boards.People were shouting, and shadows leapt crazily all round him as the lanterns swayed, but he paid no attention.He smashed Leonards jaw with one great blow, his nose with the next.The weakness mattered nothing.He would spend all his strength and die here glad, but let him batter and maim now, feel the bones crack and the blood hot and slick on his fists.Blessed Michael, let him avenge her first!There were hands on him, snatching and jerking, but they didnt matter.They would kill him now, he thought dimly, and that didnt matter, either.The body under him jerked and twitched between his legs, and lay still.When the next blow came, he went willingly into the dark.The light touch of fingers on his face awakened him.He reached drowsily up to take her hand, and his palm touched  Aaaah!With an instinctive revulsion, he was on his feet, clawing at his face.The big spider, nearly as frightened as he was, made off toward the shrubbery at high speed, long hairy legs no more than a blur.There was an outburst of giggling behind him.He turned around, his heart pounding like a drum, and found six children, roosting in the branches of a big green tree, all grinning down at him with tobacco stained teeth.He bowed to them, feeling dizzy and rubber legged, the start of fright that had got him up now dying in his blood.Mesdemoiselles, messieurs, he said, croaking, and in the half awake recesses of his brain wondered what had made him speak to them in French?Had he half heard them speaking, as he lay asleep?French they were, for they answered him in that language, strongly laced with a gutteral sort of creole accent that he had never heard before.Vous tes matelot?the biggest boy asked, eyeing him with interest.His knees gave way and he sat down on the ground, suddenly enough to make the children laugh again.Non, he replied, struggling to make his tongue work.Je suis guerrier.His mouth was dry and his head ached like a fiend.Faint memories swam about in the parritch that filled his head, too vague to grasp.A soldier!exclaimed one of the smaller children.His eyes were round and dark as sloes.Where is your sword and pistola, eh?Dont be silly, an older girl told him loftily.How could he swim with a pistola?It would be ruined.Dont you know any better, guava head?Dont call me that!the smaller boy shouted, face contorting in rage.Shitface!Frog guts!Caca brains!The children were scrabbling through the branches like monkeys, screaming and chasing each other.Jamie rubbed a hand hard over his face, trying to think.Mademoiselle!He caught the eye of the older girl and beckoned to her.She hesitated for a moment, then dropped from her branch like a ripe fruit, landing on the ground before him in a puff of yellow dust.She was barefoot, wearing nothing but a muslin shift and a colored kerchief round her dark, curly hair.Monsieur?You seem a woman of some knowledge, Mademoiselle, he said.Tell me, please, what is the name of this place?Cap Hatien, she replied promptly.She eyed him with considerable curiosity.You talk funny, she said.I am thirsty.Is there water nearby?Cap Hatien.So he was on the island of Hispaniola.His mind was slowly beginning to function again; he had a vague memory of terrible effort, of swimming for his life in a frothing cauldron of heaving waves, and rain pelting his face so hard that it made little difference whether his head was above or below the surface.And what else?This way, this way!The other children had dropped out of the tree, and a little girl was tugging his hand, urging him to follow.He knelt by the little stream, splashing water over his head, gulping delicious cool handfuls, while the children scampered over the rocks, pelting each other with mud.Now he rememberedthe rat faced seaman, and Leonards surprised young face, the deep red rage and the satisfying feel of flesh crushed against bone under his fist.And Claire.The memory came back suddenly, with a sense of confused emotionloss and terror, succeeded by relief.What had happened?He stopped what he was doing, not hearing the questions the children were flinging at him.Are you a deserter?one of the boys asked again.Have you been in a fight?The boys eyes rested curiously on his hands.His knuckles were cut and swollen, and his hands ached badly; the fourth finger felt as though he had cracked it again.Yes, he said absently, his mind occupied.Everything was coming back; the dark, stuffy confines of the brig where they had left him to wake, and the dreadful waking, to the thought that Claire was dead.He had huddled there on the bare boards, too shaken with grief to notice at first the increasing heave and roll of the ship, or the high pitched whine of the rigging, loud enough to filter down even to his oubliette.But after a time, the motion and noise were great enough to penetrate even the cloud of grief.He had heard the sounds of the growing storm, and the shouts and running overhead, and then was much too occupied to think of anything.There was nothing in the small room with him, nothing to hold to.He had bounced from wall to wall like a dried pea in a weans rattle, unable to tell up from down, right from left in the heaving dark, and not much caring, either, as waves of seasickness rolled through his body.He had thought then of nothing but death, and that with a fervor of longing.He had been nearly unconscious, in fact, when the door to his prison had opened, and a strong smell of goat assailed his nostrils.He had no idea how the woman had got him up the ladder to the afterdeck, or why.He had only a confused memory of her babbling urgently to him in broken English as she pulled him along, half supporting his weight as he stumbled and slid on the rain wet decking.He remembered the last thing she had said, though, as she pushed him toward the tilting taffrail.She is not dead, the woman had said.She go therepointing at the rolling seayou go, too.Find her!and then she had bent, got a hand in his crutch and a sturdy shoulder under his rump, and heaved him neatly over the rail and into the churning water.You are not an Englishman, the boy was saying.Its an English ship, though, isnt it?He turned automatically, to look where the boy pointed, and saw the Porpoise, riding at anchor far out in the shallow bay.Other ships were scattered throughout the harbor, all clearly visible from this vantage point on a hill just outside the town.Yes, he said to the boy.An English ship.One for me!the boy exclaimed happily.He turned to shout to another lad.Jacques!I was right!English!Thats four for me, and only two for you this month!Three!Jacques corrected indignantly.I get Spanish and Portuguese.Bruja was Portuguese, so I can count that, too!Jamie reached out and caught the older boys arm.Pardon, Monsieur, he said.Your friend said Bruja?Yes, she was in last week, the boy answered.Is Bruja a Portuguese name, though?We werent sure whether to count it Spanish or Portuguese.Some of the sailors were in my mamans taverna, one of the little girls chimed in.They sounded like they were talking Spanish, but it wasnt like Uncle Geraldo talks.I think I should like to talk to your maman, chrie, he said to the little girl.Do any of you know, perhaps, where this Bruja was going when she left?Bridgetown, the oldest girl put in promptly, trying to regain his attention.I heard the clerk at the garrison say so.The garrison?The barracks are next door to my mamans taverna, the smaller girl chimed in, tugging at his sleeve.The ship captains all go there with their papers, while the sailors get drunk.Come, come!Maman will feed you if I tell her to.I think your maman will throw me out the door, he told her, rubbing a hand across the heavy stubble on his chin.I look like a vagabond.He did.There were stains of blood and vomit on his clothes despite the swim, and he knew by the feel of his face that it was bruised and bloodshot.Maman has seen much worse than you, the little girl assured him.Come on!He smiled and thanked her, and allowed them to lead him down the hill, staggering slightly, as his land legs had not yet returned.He found it odd but somehow comforting that the children should not be frightened of him, horrible as he no doubt looked.Was this what the goat woman had meant?That Claire had swum ashore on this island?He felt a welling of hope that was as refreshing to his heart as the water had been to his parched throat.Claire was stubborn, reckless, and had a great deal more courage than was safe for a woman, but she was by no means such a fool as to fall off a man of war by accident.And the Brujaand Ianwere nearby!He would find them both, then.The fact that he was barefoot, penniless, and a fugitive from the Royal Navy seemed of no consequence.He had his wits and his hands, and with dry land once more beneath his feet, all things seemed possible.52  A WEDDING TAKES PLACE  There was nothing to be done, but to repair the Artemis as quickly as possible, and make sail for Jamaica.I did my best to put aside my fear for Jamie, but I scarcely ate for the next two days, my appetite impeded by the large ball of ice that had taken up residence in my stomach.For distraction, I took Marsali up to the house on the hill, where she succeeded in charming Father Fogden by recallingand mixing for hima Scottish receipt for a sheep dip guaranteed to destroy ticks.Stern helpfully pitched in with the labor of repair, delegating to me the guardianship of his specimen bag, and charging me with the task of searching the nearby jungle for any curious specimens of Arachnida that might come to hand as I looked for medicinal plants.While thinking privately that I would prefer to meet any of the larger specimens of Arachnida with a good stout boot, rather than my bare hands, I accepted the charge, peering into the internal water filled cups of bromeliads in search of the bright colored frogs and spiders who inhabited these tiny worlds.I returned from one of these expeditions on the afternoon of the third day, with several large lily roots, some shelf fungus of a vivid orange, and an unusual moss, together with a live tarantulacarefully trapped in one of the sailors stocking caps and held at arms lengthlarge and hairy enough to send Lawrence into paroxysms of delight.When I emerged from the jungles edge, I saw that we had reached a new stage of progress; the Artemis was no longer canted on her side, but was slowly regaining an upright position on the sand, assisted by ropes, wedges, and a great deal of shouting.Its nearly finished, then?I asked Fergus, who was standing near the stern, doing a good bit of the shouting as he instructed his crew in the placement of wedges.He turned to me, grinning and wiping the sweat from his forehead.Yes, milady!The caulking is complete.Mr.Warren gives it as his opinion that we may launch the ship near evening, when the day is grown cool, so the tar is hardened.Thats marvelous!I craned my neck back, looking up at the naked mast that towered high above.Have we got sails?Oh, yes, he assured me.In fact, we have everything except  A shout of alarm from MacLeod interrupted whatever he had been about to say.I whirled to look toward the distant road out of the palmettos, where the sun winked off the glint of metal.Soldiers!Fergus reacted faster than anyone, leaping from the scaffolding to land in a thudding spray of sand beside me.Quick, milady!To the wood!Marsali!he shouted, looking wildly about for the girl.He licked sweat from his upper lip, eyes darting from the jungle to the approaching soldiers.Marsali!he shouted, once more.Marsali appeared round the edge of the hull, pale and startled.Fergus grasped her by the arm and shoved her toward me.Go with milady!Run!I snatched Marsalis hand and ran for the forest, sand spurting beneath our feet.There were shouts from the road behind us, and a shot cracked overhead, followed by another.Ten steps, five, and then we were in the shadow of the trees.I collapsed behind the shelter of a thorny bush, gasping for breath against the stabbing pain of a stitch in my side.Marsali knelt on the earth beside me, her cheeks streaked with tears.What?she gasped, struggling for breath.Who are they?Whatwill theydo?To Fergus.What?I dont know.Still breathing heavily, I grasped a cedar sapling and pulled myself to my knees.Peering through the underbrush on all fours, I could see that the soldiers had reached the ship.It was cool and damp under the trees, but the lining of my mouth was dry as cotton.I bit the inside of my cheek, trying to encourage a little saliva to flow.I think it will be all right.I patted Marsalis shoulder, trying to be reassuring.Look, there are only ten of them, I whispered, counting as the last soldier trotted out of the palmetto grove.Theyre French; the Artemis has French papers.It may be all right.And then again, it might not.I was well aware that a ship aground and abandoned was legal salvage.It was a deserted beach.And all that stood between these soldiers and a rich prize were the lives of the Artemiss crew.A few of the seamen had pistols to hand; most had knives.But the soldiers were armed to the teeth, each man with musket, sword, and pistols.If it came to a fight, it would be a bloody one, but the odds were heavily on the mounted soldiers.The men near the ship were silent, grouped close together behind Fergus, who stood out, straight backed and grim, as the spokesman.I saw him push back his shock of hair with his hook, and plant his feet solidly in the sand, ready for whatever might come.The creak and jingle of harness seemed muted in the damp, hot air, and the horses moved slowly, hooves muffled in the sand.The soldiers came to a halt ten feet away from the little knot of seamen.A big man who seemed to be in command raised one hand in an order to stay, and swung down from his horse.I was watching Fergus, rather than the soldiers.I saw his face change, then freeze, white under his tan.I glanced quickly at the soldier coming toward him across the sand, and my own blood froze.Silence, mes amis, said the big man, in a voice of pleasant command.Silence, et restez, sil vous plat.Silence, my friends, and do not move, if you please.I would have fallen, were I not already on my knees.I closed my eyes in a wordless prayer of thanksgiving.Next to me, Marsali gasped.I opened my eyes and clapped a hand over her open mouth.The commander took off his hat, and shook out a thick mass of sweat soaked auburn hair.He grinned at Fergus, teeth white and wolfish in a short, curly red beard.You are in charge here?Jamie said in French.You, come with me.The resthe nodded at the crew, several of whom were goggling at him in open amazementyou stay where you are.Dont talk, he added, off handedly.Marsali jerked at my arm, and I realized how tightly I had been holding her.Sorry, I whispered, letting go, but not taking my eyes from the beach.What is he doing?Marsali hissed in my ear.Her face was pale with excitement, and the little freckles left by the sun stood out on her nose in contrast.How did he get here?I dont know!Be quiet, for Gods sake!The crew of the Artemis exchanged glances, waggled their eyebrows, and nudged each other in the ribs, but fortunately also obeyed orders and didnt speak.I hoped to heaven that their obvious excitement would be construed merely as consternation over their impending fate.Jamie and Fergus had walked over toward the shore, conferring in low voices.Now they separated, Fergus coming back toward the hull with an expression of grim determination, Jamie calling the soldiers to dismount and gather round him.I couldnt tell what Jamie was saying to the soldiers, but Fergus was close enough for us to hear.These are soldiers from the garrison at Cap Hatien, he announced to the crew members.Their commanderCaptain Alessandro he said, lifting his eyebrows and grimacing hideously to emphasize the name, says that they will assist us in launching the Artemis.This announcement was greeted with faint cheers from some of the men, and looks of bewilderment from others.But how did Mr.Fraser began Royce, a rather slow witted seaman, his heavy brows drawn together in a puzzled frown.Fergus allowed no time for questions, but plunged into the midst of the crew, putting an arm about Royces shoulders and dragging him toward the scaffolding, talking loudly to drown out any untoward remarks.Yes, is it not a most fortunate accident?he said loudly.I could see that he was twisting Royces ear with his sound hand.Most fortunate indeed!Captain Alessandro says that a habitant on his way from his plantation saw the ship aground, and reported it to the garrison.With so much help, we will have the Artemis aswim in no time at all.He let go of Royce and clapped his hand sharply against his thigh.Come, come, let us set to work at once!Manzettiup you go!MacLeod, MacGregor, seize your hammers!Maitland He spotted Maitland, standing on the sand gawking at Jamie.Fergus whirled and clapped the cabin boy on the back hard enough to make him stagger.Maitland, mon enfant!Give us a song to speed our efforts!Looking rather dazed, Maitland began a tentative rendition of The Nut Brown Maid.A few of the seamen began to climb back onto the scaffolding, glancing suspiciously over their shoulders.Sing!Fergus bellowed, glaring up at them.Murphy, who appeared to be finding something extremely funny, mopped his sweating red face and obligingly joined in the song, his wheezing bass reinforcing Maitlands pure tenor.Fergus stalked up and down beside the hull, exhorting, directing, urgingand making such a spectacle of himself that few telltale glances went in Jamies direction.The uncertain tap of hammers started up again.Meanwhile, Jamie was giving careful directions to his soldiers.I saw more than one Frenchman glance at the Artemis as he talked, with a look of dimly concealed greed that suggested that a selfless desire to help their fellow beings was perhaps not the motive uppermost in the soldiers minds, no matter what Fergus had announced.Still, the soldiers went to work willingly enough, stripping off their leather jerkins and laying aside most of their arms.Three of the soldiers, I noticed, did not join the work party, but remained on guard, fully armed, eyes sharp on the sailors every move.Jamie alone remained aloof, watching everything.Should we come out?Marsali murmured in my ear.It seems safe, now.No, I said.My eyes were fixed on Jamie.He stood in the shade of a tall palmetto, at ease, but erect.Behind the unfamiliar beard, his expression was unreadable, but I caught the faint movement at his side, as the two stiff fingers flickered once against his thigh.No, I said again.It isnt over yet.The work went on through the afternoon.The stack of wooden rollers mounted, cut ends scenting the air with the tang of fresh sap.Ferguss voice was hoarse, and his shirt clung wetly to his lean torso.The horses, hobbled, wandered slowly under the edge of the forest, browsing.The sailors had given up singing now, and had settled to work, with no more than an occasional glance toward the palmetto where Captain Alessandro stood in the shade, arms folded.The sentry near the trees paced slowly up and down, musket carried at the ready, a wistful eye on the cool green shadows.He passed close enough on one circuit for me to see the dark, greasy curls dangling down his neck, and the pockmarks on his plump cheeks.He creaked and jingled as he walked.The rowel was missing from one of his spurs.He looked hot, and fairly cross.It was a long wait, and the inquisitiveness of the forest midges made it longer still.After what seemed forever, though, I saw Jamie give a nod to one of the guards, and come from the beach toward the trees.I signed to Marsali to wait, and ducking under branches, ignoring the thick brush, I dodged madly toward the place where he had disappeared.I popped breathlessly out from behind a bush, just as he was doing up the laces of his flies.His head jerked up at the sound, his eyes widened, and he let out a yell that would have summoned Arabella the sheep back from the dead, let alone the waiting sentry.I dodged back into hiding, as crashing boots and shouts of inquiry headed in our direction.Cest bien!Jamie shouted.He sounded a trifle shaken.Ce nest quun serpent!The sentry spoke an odd dialect of French, but appeared to be asking rather nervously whether the serpent was dangerous.Non, cest innocent, Jamie answered.He waved at the sentry, whose inquiring head I could just see, peering reluctantly over the bush.The sentry, who seemed unenthusiastic about snakes, however innocent, disappeared promptly back to his duty.Without hesitation, Jamie plunged into the bush.Claire!He crushed me tight against his chest.Then he grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me, hard.Damn you!he said, in a piercing whisper.I thought ye were dead for sure!How dare ye do something harebrained like jump off a ship in the middle of the night!Have ye no sense at all?Let go!I hissed.The shaking had made me bite my lip.Let go, I say!What do you mean, how dare I do something harebrained?You idiot, what possessed you to follow me?His face was darkened by the sun; now a deep red began to darken it further, washing up from the edges of his new beard.What possessed me?he repeated.Youre my wife, for the Lords sake!Of course I would follow ye; why did ye not wait for me?Christ, if I had time, Id The mention of time evidently reminded him that we hadnt much, and with a noticeable effort, he choked back any further remarks, which was just as well, because I had a number of things to say in that vein myself.I swallowed them, with some difficulty.What in bloody hell are you doing here?I asked instead.The deep flush subsided slightly, succeeded by the merest hint of a smile amid the unfamiliar foliage.Im the captain, he said.Did ye not notice?Yes, I noticed!Captain Alessandro, my foot!What do you mean to do?Instead of answering, he gave me a final, gentle shake and divided a glare between me and Marsali, who had poked an inquiring head out.Stay here, the both of ye, and dinna stir a foot or I swear Ill beat ye senseless.Without pausing for a response, he whirled and strode back through the trees, toward the beach.Marsali and I exchanged stares, which were interrupted a second later, when Jamie, breathless, hurtled back into the small clearing.He grabbed me by both arms, and kissed me briefly but thoroughly.I forgot.I love you, he said, giving me another shake for emphasis.And Im glad youre no dead.Dinna do that again!Letting go, he crashed back into the brush and disappeared.I felt breathless, myself, and more than a little rattled, but undeniably happy.Marsalis eyes were round as saucers.What shall we do?she asked.Whats Da going to do?I dont know, I said.My cheeks were flushed, and I could still feel the touch of his mouth on mine, and the unfamiliar tingling left by the brush of beard and mustache.My tongue touched the small stinging place where I had bitten my lip.I dont know what hes going to do, I repeated.I suppose well have to wait and see.It was a long wait.I was dozing against the trunk of a huge tree, near dusk, when Marsalis hand on my shoulder brought me awake.Theyre launching the ship!she said in an excited whisper.They were; under the eyes of the sentries, the remaining soldiers and the crew of the Artemis were all manning the ropes and rollers that would move her down the beach into the waters of the inlet.Even Fergus, Innes, and Murphy joined in the labor, missing limbs notwithstanding.The sun was going down; its disc shone huge and orange gold, blinding above a sea gone the purple of whelks.The men were no more than black silhouettes against the light, anonymous as the slaves of an Egyptian wall painting, tethered by ropes to their massive burden.The monotonous Heave!of the bosuns shout was succeeded by a weak cheer as the hull slid the last few feet, drawn away from the shore by tow ropes from the Artemiss jolly boat and cutter.I saw the flash of red hair as Jamie moved up the side and swung aboard, then the gleam of metal as one of the soldiers followed him.They stood guard together, red hair and black no more than dots at the head of the rope ladder, as the crew of the Artemis entered the jolly boat, rowed out and came up the ladder, interspersed with the rest of the French soldiers.The last man disappeared up the ladder.The men in the boats sat on their oars, looking up, tense and alert.Nothing happened.Next to me, I heard Marsali exhale noisily, and realized I had been holding my own breath much too long.What are they doing?she said, in exasperation.As though in answer to this, there was one loud, angry shout from the Artemis.The men in the boats jerked up, ready to lunge aboard.No other signal came, though.The Artemis floated serenely on the rising waters of the inlet, perfect as an oil painting.Ive had enough, I said suddenly to Marsali.Whatever those bloody men are doing, theyve done it.Come on.I drew in a fresh gulp of the cool evening air, and walked out of the trees, Marsali behind me.As we came down the beach, a slim black figure dropped over the ships side and galloped through the shallows, gleaming gouts of green and purple seawater spouting from his footsteps.Mo chridhe chrie!Fergus ran dripping toward us, face beaming, and seizing Marsali, swung her off her feet with exuberance and whirled her round.Done!he crowed.Done without a shot fired!Trussed like geese and packed like salted herrings in the hold!He kissed Marsali heartily, then set her down on the sand, and turning to me, bowed ceremoniously, with the elaborate flourish of an imaginary hat.Milady, the captain of the Artemis desires you will honor him with your company over supper.The new captain of the Artemis was standing in the middle of his cabin, eyes closed and completely naked, blissfully scratching his testicles.Er, I said, confronted with this sight.His eyes popped open and his face lit with joy.The next moment, I was enfolded in his embrace, face pressed against the red gold curls of his chest.We didnt say anything for quite some time.I could hear the thrum of footsteps on the deck overhead, the shouts of the crew, ringing with joy at the imminence of escape, and the creak and flap of sails being rigged.The Artemis was coming back to life around us.My face was warm, tingling from the rasp of his beard.I felt suddenly strange and shy holding him, he naked as a jay and myself as bare under the remnants of Father Fogdens tattered robe.The body that pressed against my own with mounting urgency was the same from the neck down, but the face was a strangers, a Viking marauders.Besides the beard that transformed his face, he smelled unfamiliar, his own sweat overlaid with rancid cooking oil, spilled beer, and the reek of harsh perfume and unfamiliar spices.I let go, and took a step back.Shouldnt you dress?I asked.Not that I dont enjoy the scenery, I added, blushing despite myself.IerI think I like the beard.Maybe, I added doubtfully, scrutinizing him.I dont, he said frankly, scratching his jaw.Im crawling wi lice, and it itches like a fiend.Eew!While I was entirely familiar with Pediculus humanus, the common body louse, acquaintance had not endeared me.I rubbed a hand nervously through my own hair, already imagining the prickle of feet on my scalp, as tiny sestets gamboled through the thickets of my curls.He grinned at me, white teeth startling in the auburn beard.Dinna fash yourself, Sassenach, he assured me.Ive already sent for a razor and hot water.Really?It seems rather a pity to shave it off right away.Despite the lice, I leaned forward to peer at his hirsute adornment.Its like your hair, all different colors.Rather pretty, really.I touched it, warily.The hairs were odd; thick and wiry, very curly, in contrast to the soft thick smoothness of the hair on his head.They sprang exuberantly from his skin in a profusion of colors; copper, gold, amber, cinnamon, a roan so deep as almost to be black.Most startling of all was a thick streak of silver that ran from his lower lip to the line of his jaw.Thats funny, I said, tracing it.You havent any white hairs on your head, but you have right here.I have?He put a hand to his jaw, looking startled, and I suddenly realized that he likely had no idea what he looked like.Then he smiled wryly, and bent to pick up the pile of discarded clothes from the floor.Aye, well, little wonder if I have; I wonder Ive not gone white haired altogether from the things Ive been through this month.He paused, eyeing me over the wadded white breeches.And speaking of that, Sassenach, as I was saying to ye in the trees  Yes, speaking of that, I interrupted.What in the name of God did you do?Oh, the soldiers, ye mean?He scratched his chin meditatively.Well, it was simple enough.I told the soldiers that as soon as the ship was launched, wed gather everyone on deck, and at my signal, they were to fall on the crew and push them into the hold.A broad grin blossomed through the foliage.Only Fergus had mentioned it to the crew, ye see; so when each soldier came aboard, two of the crewmen snatched him by the arms while a third gagged him, bound his arms, and took away his weapons.Then we pushed all of them into the hold.Thats all.He shrugged, modestly nonchalant.Right, I said, exhaling.And as for just how you happened to be here in the first place  At this juncture we were interrupted by a discreet knock on the cabins door.Mr.Fraser?ErCaptain, I mean?Maitlands angular young face peered round the jamb, cautious over a steaming bowl.Mr.Murphys got the galley fire going, and heres your hot water, with his compliments.Mr.Fraser will do, Jamie assured him, taking the tray with bowl and razor in one hand.A less seaworthy captain doesna bear thinking of.He paused, listening to the thump of feet above our heads.Though since I am the captain, he said slowly, I suppose that means I shall say when we sail and when we stop?Yes, sir, thats one thing a captain does, Maitland said.He added helpfully, The captain also says when the hands are to have extra rations of food and grog.I see.The upward curl of Jamies mouth was still visible, beard notwithstanding.Tell me, Maitlandhow much dye think the hands can drink and still sail the ship?Oh, quite a lot, sir, Maitland said earnestly.His brow wrinkled in thought.Maybean extra double ration all round?Jamie lifted one eyebrow.Of brandy?Oh, no, sir!Maitland looked shocked.Grog.If it was to be brandy, only an extra half ration, or theyd be rolling in the bilges.Double grog, then.Jamie bowed ceremoniously to Maitland, unhampered by the fact that he was still completely unclad.Make it so, Mr.Maitland.And the ship will not lift anchor until I have finished my supper.Yes, sir!Maitland bowed back; Jamies manners were catching.And shall I desire the Chinee to attend you directly after the anchor is weighed?Somewhat before that, Mr.Maitland, thank ye kindly.Maitland was turning to leave, with a last admiring glance at Jamies scars, but I stopped him.One more thing, Maitland, I said.Oh, yes, mum?Will you go down to the galley and ask Mr.Murphy to send up a bottle of his strongest vinegar?And then find where the men have put some of my medicines, and fetch them as well?His narrow forehead creased in puzzlement, but he nodded obligingly.Oh, yes, mum.This directly minute.Just what dye mean to do wi the vinegar Sassenach?Jamie observed me narrowly, as Maitland vanished into the corridor.Souse you in it to kill the lice, I said.I dont intend to sleep with a seething nest of vermin.Oh, he said.He scratched the side of his neck meditatively.Ye mean to sleep with me, do you?He glanced at the berth, an uninviting hole in the wall.I dont know where, precisely, but yes, I do, I said firmly.And I wish you wouldnt shave your beard just yet, I added, as he bent to set down the tray he was holding.Why not?He glanced curiously over his shoulder at me, and I felt the heat rising in my cheeks.Erwell.Its a bitdifferent.Oh, aye?He stood up and took a step toward me.In the cramped confines of the cabin, he seemed even biggerand a lot more nakedthan he ever had on deck.The dark blue eyes had slanted into triangles of amusement.How, different?he asked.Well, itum I brushed my fingers vaguely past my burning cheeks.It feels different.When you kiss me.On myskin.His eyes locked on mine.He hadnt moved, but he seemed much closer.Ye have verra fine skin, Sassenach, he said softly.Like pearls and opals.He reached out a finger and very gently traced the line of my jaw.And then my neck, and the wide flare of collarbone and back, and down, in a slow moving serpentine that brushed the tops of my breasts, hidden in the deep cowl neck of the priests robe.Ye have a lot of verra fine skin, Sassenach, he added.One eyebrow quirked up.If thats what ye were thinking?I swallowed and licked my lips, but didnt look away.Thats more or less what I was thinking, yes.He took his finger away and glanced at the bowl of steaming water.Aye, well.It seems a shame to waste the water.Shall I send it back to Murphy to make soup, or shall I drink it?I laughed, both tension and strangeness dissolving at once.You shall sit down, I said, and wash with it.You smell like a brothel.I expect I do, he said, scratching.Theres one upstairs in the tavern where the soldiers go to drink and gamble.He took up the soap and dropped it in the hot water.Upstairs, eh?I said.Well, the girls come down, betweentimes, he explained.It wouldna be mannerly to stop them sitting on your lap, after all.And your mother brought you up to have nice manners, I expect, I said, very dryly.Upon second thoughts, I think perhaps we shall anchor here for the night, he said thoughtfully, looking at me.Shall we?And sleep ashore, where theres room.Room for what?I asked, regarding him with suspicion.Well, I have it planned, aye?he said, sloshing water over his face with both hands.You have what planned?I asked.He snorted and shook the excess water from his beard before replying.I have been thinking of this for months, now, he said, with keen anticipation.Every night, folded up in that godforsaken nutshell of a berth, listening to Fergus grunt and fart across the cabin.I thought it all out, just what I would do, did I have ye naked and willing, no one in hearing, and room enough to serve ye suitably.He lathered the cake of soap vigorously between his palms, and applied it to his face.Well, Im willing enough, I said, intrigued.And theres room, certainly.As for naked  Ill see to that, he assured me.Thats part o the plan, aye?I shall take ye to a private spot, spread out a quilt to lie on, and commence by sitting down beside you.Well, thats a start, all right, I said.What then?I sat down next to him on the berth.He leaned close and bit my earlobe very delicately.As for what next, then I shall take ye on my knee and kiss ye.He paused to illustrate, holding my arms so I couldnt move.He let go a minute later, leaving my lips slightly swollen, tasting of ale, soap, and Jamie.So much for step one, I said, wiping soapsuds from my mouth.What then?Then I shall lay ye down upon the quilt, twist your hair up in my hand and taste your face and throat and ears and bosom wi my lips, he said.I thought I would do that until ye start to make squeaking noises.I dont make squeaking noises!Aye, ye do, he said.Here, hand me the towel, aye?Then, he went on cheerfully, I thought I would begin at the other end.I shall lift up your skirt and His face disappeared into the folds of the linen towel.And what?I asked, thoroughly intrigued.And kiss the insides of your thighs, where the skins so soft.The beard might help there, aye?He stroked his jaw, considering.It might, I said, a little faintly.What am I supposed to be doing while you do this?Well, ye might moan a bit, if ye like, to encourage me, but otherwise, ye just lie still.He didnt sound as though he needed any encouragement whatever.One of his hands was resting on my thigh as he used the other to swab his chest with the damp towel.As he finished, the hand slid behind me, and squeezed.My beloveds arm is under me, I quoted.And his hand behind my head.Comfort me with apples, and stay me with flagons, For I am sick of love.There was a flash of white teeth in his beard.More like grapefruit, he said, one hand cupping my behind.Or possibly gourds.Grapefruit are too small.Gourds?I said indignantly.Well, wild gourds get that big sometimes, he said.But aye, thats next.He squeezed once more, then removed the hand in order to wash the armpit on that side.I lie upon my back and have ye stretched at length upon me, so that I can get hold of your buttocks and fondle them properly.He stopped washing to give me a quick example of what he thought proper, and I let out an involuntary gasp.Now, he went on, resuming his ablutions, should ye wish to kick your legs a bit, or make lewd motions wi your hips and pant in my ear at that point in the proceedings, I should have no great objection.I do not pant!Aye, ye do.Now, about your breasts  Oh, I thought youd forgotten those.Never in life, he assured me.No, he went blithely on, thats when I take off your gown, leaving ye in naught but your shift.Im not wearing a shift.Oh?Well, no matter, he said, dismissing this.I meant to suckle ye through the thin cotton, til your nipples stood up hard in my mouth, and then take it off, but its no great concern; Ill manage without.So, allowing for the absence of your shift, I shall attend to your breasts until ye make that wee bleating noise  I dont  And then, he said, interrupting, since ye will, according to the plan, be naked, andprovided Ive done it right so farpossibly willing as well  Oh, just possibly, I said.My lips were still tingling from step one.then I shall spread open your thighs, take down my breeks, and He paused, waiting.And?I said, obligingly.The grin widened substantially.And well see what sort of noise it is ye dont make then, Sassenach.There was a slight cough in the doorway behind me.Oh, your pardon, Mr.Willoughby, Jamie said apologetically.I wasna expecting ye so soon.Perhaps yed care to go and have a bit of supper?And if ye would, take those things along and ask Murphy will he burn them in the galley fire.He tossed the remains of his uniform to Mr.Willoughby, and bent to rummage in a sealocker for fresh clothing.I never thought to meet Lawrence Stern again, he remarked, burrowing through the tangled linen.How does he come to be here?Oh, he is the Jewish natural philosopher you told me about?He is.Though I shouldna think there are so many Jewish philosophers about as to cause great confusion.I explained how I had come to meet Stern in the mangroves.and then he brought me up to the priests house, I said, and stopped, suddenly reminded.Oh, I almost forgot!You owe the priest two pounds sterling, on account of Arabella.I do?Jamie glanced at me, startled, a shirt in his hand.You do.Maybe youd best ask Lawrence if hell act as ambassador; the priest seems to get on with him.All right.Whats happened to this Arabella, though?Has one of the crew debauched her?I suppose you might say that.I drew breath to explain further, but before I could speak, another knock sounded on the door.Can a man not dress in peace?Jamie demanded irritably.Come, then!The door swung open, revealing Marsali, who blinked at the sight of her nude stepfather.Jamie hastily swathed his midsection in the shirt he was holding, and nodded to her, sangfroid only slightly impaired.Marsali, lass.Im glad to see ye unhurt.Did ye require something?The girl edged into the room, taking up a position between the table and a sea chest.Aye, I do, she said.She was sunburned, and her nose was peeling, but I thought she seemed pale nonetheless.Her fists were clenched at her sides, and her chin lifted as for battle.I require ye to keep your promise, she said.Aye?Jamie looked wary.Your promise to let me and Fergus be married, so soon as we came to the Indies.A small wrinkle appeared between her fair eyebrows.Hispaniola is in the Indies, no?The Jew said so.Jamie scratched at his beard, looking reluctant.It is, he said.And aye, I suppose if Iwell, aye.I did promise.Butyoure still sure of yourselves, the two of ye?She lifted her chin higher, jaw set firmly.We are.Jamie lifted one eyebrow.Wheres Fergus?Helping stow the cargo.I kent wed be under way soon, so I thought Id best come and ask now.Aye.Well.Jamie frowned, then sighed with resignation.Aye, I said.But I did say as ye must be blessed by a priest, did I no?Theres no priest closer than Bayamo, and thats three days ride.But perhaps in Jamaica  Nay, youre forgetting!Marsali said triumphantly.Weve a priest right here.Father Fogden can marry us.I felt my jaw drop, and hastily closed it.Jamie was scowling at her.We sail first thing in the morning!It wont take long, she said.Its only a few words, after all.Were already married, by law; its only to be blessed by the Church, aye?Her hand flattened on her abdomen where her marriage contract presumably resided beneath her stays.But your mother Jamie glanced helplessly at me for reinforcement.I shrugged, equally helpless.The task of trying either to explain Father Fogden to Jamie or to dissuade Marsali was well beyond me.He likely wont do it, though.Jamie came up with this objection with a palpable air of relief.The crew have been trifling with one of his parishioners named Arabella.He willna want anything to do wi us, Im afraid.Yes, he will!Hell do it for mehe likes me!Marsali was almost dancing on her toes with eagerness.Jamie looked at her for a long moment, eyes fixed on hers, reading her face.She was very young.Youre sure, then, lassie?he said at last, very gently.Ye want this?She took a deep breath, a glow spreading over her face.I am, Da.I truly am.I want Fergus!I love him!Jamie hesitated a moment, then rubbed a hand through his hair and nodded.Aye, then.Go and send Mr.Stern to me, then fetch Fergus and tell him to make ready.Oh, Da!Thank you, thank you!Marsali flung herself at him and kissed him.He held her with one arm, clutching the shirt about his middle with the other.Then he kissed her on the forehead and pushed her gently away.Take care, he said, smiling.Ye dinna want to go to your bridal covered wi lice.Oh!This seemed to remind her of something.She glanced at me and blushed, putting up a hand to her own pale locks, which were matted with sweat and straggling down her neck from a careless knot.Mother Claire, she said shyly, I wonderwould yecould ye lend me a bit of the special soap ye make wi the chamomile?Iif theres time she added, with a hasty glance at Jamie, I should like to wash my hair.Of course, I said, and smiled at her.Come along and well make you pretty for your wedding.I looked her over appraisingly, from glowing round face to dirty bare feet.The crumpled muslin of her sea shrunk gown stretched tight over her bosom, slight as it was, and the grubby hem hovered several inches above her sandy ankles.A thought struck me, and I turned to Jamie.She should have a nice dress to be married in, I said.Sassenach, he said, with obviously waning patience, we havena  No, but the priest does, I interrupted.Tell Lawrence to ask Father Fogden whether we might borrow one of his gowns; Ermenegildas, I mean.I think theyre almost the right size.Jamies face went blank with surprise above his beard.Ermenegilda?he said.Arabella?Gowns?He narrowed his eyes at me.What sort of priest is this man, Sassenach?I paused in the doorway, Marsali hovering impatiently in the passage beyond.Well, I said, he drinks a bit.And hes rather fond of sheep.But he might remember the words to the wedding ceremony.It was one of the more unusual weddings I had attended.The sun had long since sunk into the sea by the time all arrangements were made.To the disgruntlement of Mr.Warren, the ships master, Jamie had declared that we would not leave until the next day, so as to allow the newlyweds one night of privacy ashore.Damned if Id care to consummate a marriage in one of those godforsaken pesthole berths, he told me privately.If they got coupled in there to start wi, wed never pry them out.And the thought of takin a maidenhead in a hammock  Quite, I said.I poured more vinegar on his head, smiling to myself.Very thoughtful of you.Now Jamie stood by me on the beach, smelling rather strongly of vinegar, but handsome and dignified in blue coat, clean stock and linen, and gray serge breeks, with his hair clubbed back and ribboned.The wild red beard was a bit incongruous above his otherwise sober garb, but it had been neatly trimmed and fine combed with vinegar, and stockinged feet notwithstanding, he made a fine picture as father of the bride.Murphy, as one chief witness, and Maitland, as the other, were somewhat less prepossessing, though Murphy had washed his hands and Maitland his face.Fergus would have preferred Lawrence Stern as a witness, and Marsali had asked for me, but both were dissuaded; first on grounds that Stern was not a Christian, let alone a Catholic, and then, by consideration that while I was religiously qualified, that fact was unlikely to weigh heavily with Laoghaire, once she found out about it.Ive told Marsali she must write to her mother to say shes wed, Jamie murmured to me as we watched the preparations on the beach go forward.But perhaps I shall suggest she doesna say much more about it than that.I saw his point; Laoghaire was not going to be pleased at hearing that her eldest daughter had eloped with a one handed ex pickpocket twice her age.Her maternal feelings were unlikely to be assuaged by hearing that the marriage had been performed in the middle of the night on a West Indian beach by a disgracedif not actually defrockedpriest, witnessed by twenty five seamen, ten French horses, a small flock of sheepall gaily beribboned in honor of the occasionand a King Charles spaniel, who added to the generally festive feeling by attempting to copulate with Murphys wooden leg at every opportunity.The only thing that could make things worse, in Laoghaires view, would be to hear that I had participated in the ceremony.Several torches were lit, bound to stakes pounded into the sand, and the flames streamed seaward in tails of red and orange, bright against the black velvet night.The brilliant stars of the Caribbean shone overhead like the lights of heaven.While it was not a church, few brides had had a more beautiful setting for their nuptials.I didnt know what prodigies of persuasion had been required on Lawrences part, but Father Fogden was there, frail and insubstantial as a ghost, the blue sparks of his eyes the only real signs of life.His skin was gray as his robe, and his hands trembled on the worn leather of his prayer book.Jamie glanced sharply at him, and appeared to be about to say something, but then merely muttered under his breath in Gaelic and pressed his lips tightly together.The spicy scent of sangria wafted from Father Fogdens vicinity, but at least he had reached the beach under his own power.He stood swaying between two torches, laboriously trying to turn the pages of his book as the light offshore wind jerked them fluttering from his fingers.At last he gave up, and dropped the book on the sand with a little plop!Um, he said, and belched.He looked about and gave us a small, saint like smile.Dearly beloved of God.It was several moments before the throng of shuffling, murmuring spectators realized that the ceremony had started, and began to poke each other and straighten to attention.Wilt thou take this woman?Father Fogden demanded, suddenly rounding ferociously on Murphy.No!said the cook, startled.I dont hold wi women.Messy things.You dont?Father Fogden closed one eye, the remaining orb bright and accusing.He looked at Maitland.Do you take this woman?Not me, sir, no.Not that anyone wouldnt be pleased, he added hastily.Him, please.Maitland pointed at Fergus, who stood next to the cabin boy, glowering at the priest.Him?Youre sure?He hasnt a hand, Father Fogden said doubtfully.Wont she mind?I will not!Marsali, imperious in one of Ermenegildas gowns, blue silk encrusted with gold embroidery along the low, square neckline and puffed sleeves, stood beside Fergus.She looked lovely, with her hair clean and bright as fresh straw, brushed to a gloss and floating loose round her shoulders, as became a maiden.She also looked angry.Go on!She stamped her foot, which made no noise on the sand, but seemed to startle the priest.Oh, yes, he said nervously, taking one step back.Well, I dont suppose its an imptimpeddyimpediment, after all.Not as though hed lost his cock, I mean.He hasnt, has he?the priest inquired anxiously, as the possibility occurred to him.I cant marry you if he has.Its not allowed.Marsalis face was already bathed in red by torchlight.The expression on it at this point reminded me strongly of how her mother had looked upon finding me at Lallybroch.A visible tremor ran through Ferguss shoulders, whether of rage or laughter, I couldnt tell.Jamie quelled the incipient riot by striding firmly into the middle of the wedding and placing a hand on the shoulders of Fergus and Marsali.This man, he said, with a nod toward Fergus, and this woman, with another toward Marsali.Marry them, Father.Now.Please, he added, as an obvious afterthought, and stood back a pace, restoring order among the audience by dint of dark glances from side to side.Oh, quite.Quite, Father Fogden repeated, swaying gently.Quite, quite.A long pause followed, during which the priest squinted at Marsali.Name, he said abruptly.I have to have a name.Cant get married without a name.Just like a cock.Cant get married without a name; cant get married without a c  Marsali Jane MacKimmie Joyce!Marsali spoke up loudly, drowning him out.Yes, yes, he said hurriedly.Of course it is.Marsali.Mar sa lee.Just so.Well, then, do you Mar sa lee take this maneven though hes missing a hand and possibly other parts not visibleto be your lawful husband?To have and to hold, from this day forward, forsaking At this point he trailed off, his attention fixed on one of the sheep that had wandered into the light and was chewing industriously on a discarded stocking of striped wool.I do!Father Fogden blinked, brought back to attention.He made an unsuccessful attempt to stifle another belch, and transferred his bright blue gaze to Fergus.You have a name, too?And a cock?Yes, said Fergus, wisely choosing not to be more specific.Fergus.The priest frowned slightly at this.Fergus?he said.Fergus.Fergus.Yes, Fergus, got that.Thats all?No more name?Need more names, surely.Fergus, Fergus repeated, with a note of strain in his voice.Fergus was the only name he had ever hadbar his original French name of Claudel.Jamie had given him the name Fergus in Paris, when they had met, twenty years before.But naturally a brothel born bastard would have no last name to give a wife.Fraser, said a deep, sure voice beside me.Fergus and Marsali both glanced back in surprise, and Jamie nodded.His eyes met Ferguss, and he smiled faintly.Fergus Claudel Fraser, he said, slowly and clearly.One eyebrow lifted as he looked at Fergus.Fergus himself looked transfixed.His mouth hung open, eyes wide black pools in the dim light.Then he nodded slightly, and a glow rose in his face, as though he contained a candle that had just been lit.Fraser, he said to the priest.His voice was husky, and he cleared his throat.Fergus Claudel Fraser.Father Fogden had his head tilted back, watching the sky, where a crescent of light floated over the trees, holding the black orb of the moon in its cup.He lowered his head to face Fergus, looking dreamy.Well, thats good, he said.Isnt it?A small poke in the ribs from Maitland brought him back to an awareness of his responsibilities.Oh!Um.Well.Man and wife.Yes, I pronounce you manno, thats not right, you havent said whether youd take her.She has both hands, he added helpfully.I will, Fergus said.He had been holding Marsalis hand; now he let go and dug hastily in his pocket, coming out with a small gold ring.He must have bought it in Scotland, I realized, and kept it ever since, not wanting to make the marriage official until it had been blessed.Not by a priestby Jamie.The beach was silent as he slid the ring on her finger, all eyes fixed on the small gold circle and the two heads bent close together over it, one bright, one dark.So she had done it.One fifteen year old girl, with nothing but stubbornness as a weapon.I want him, she had said.And kept saying it, through her mothers objections and Jamies arguments, through Ferguss scruples and her own fears, through three thousand miles of homesickness, hardship, ocean storm, and shipwreck.She raised her face, shining, and found her mirror in Ferguss eyes.I saw them look at each other, and felt the tears prickle behind my lids.I want him.I had not said that to Jamie at our marriage; I had not wanted him, then.But I had said it since, three times; in two moments of choice at Craigh na Dun, and once again at Lallybroch.I want him.I wanted him still, and nothing whatever could stand between us.He was looking down at me; I could feel the weight of his gaze, dark blue and tender as the sea at dawn.What are ye thinking, mo chridhe?he asked softly.I blinked back the tears and smiled at him.His hands were large and warm on mine.What I tell you three times is true, I said.And standing on tiptoe, I kissed him as the sailors cheer went up.PART NINE    Worlds Unknown   53  BAT GUANO  Bat guano is a slimy blackish green when fresh, a powdery light brown when dried.In both states, it emits an eye watering reek of musk, ammonia, and decay.How much of this stuff did you say were taking?I asked, through the cloth I had wrapped about my lower face.Ten tons, Jamie replied, his words similarly muffled.We were standing on the upper deck, watching as the slaves trundled barrowloads of the reeking stuff down the gangplank and over to the open hatchway of the after hold.Tiny particles of the dried guano blew from the barrows and filled the air around us with a deceptively beautiful cloud of gold, that sparked and glimmered in the late afternoon sun.The mens bodies were coated with the stuff as well; the runnels of sweat carved dark channels in the dust on their bare torsos, and the constant tears ran down their faces and chests, so that they were striped in black and gold like exotic zebras.Jamie dabbed at his own streaming eyes as the wind veered slightly toward us.Dye ken how to keelhaul someone, Sassenach?No, but if its Fergus you have in mind as a candidate, Im with you.How far is it to Jamaica?It was Fergus, making inquiries in the marketplace on Kings Street in Bridgetown, who had gained the Artemis her first commission as a trading and hauling vessel; the shipment of ten cubic tons of bat guano from Barbados to Jamaica, for use as fertilizer on the sugar plantation of one Mr.Grey, planter.Fergus himself was rather self consciously overseeing the loading of the huge quarried blocks of dried guano, which were tipped from their barrows and handed down one by one into the hold.Marsali, never far from his side, had in this case moved as far as the forecastle, where she sat on a barrel filled with oranges, the lovely new shawl Fergus had bought her in the market wrapped over her face.We are meant to be traders, no?Fergus had argued.We have an empty hold to fill.Besides, he had added logically, clinching the argument, Monsieur Grey will pay us more than adequately.How far, Sassenach?Jamie squinted at the horizon, as though hoping to see land rising from the sparkling waves.Mr.Willoughbys magic needles rendered him seaworthy, but he submitted to the process with no real enthusiasm.Three or four days sail, Warren says, he admitted with a sigh, and the weather holds fair.Maybe the smell will be better at sea, I said.Oh, yes, milady, Fergus assured me, overhearing as he passed.The owner tells me that the stench dissipates itself significantly, once the dried material is removed from the caves where it accumulates.He leapt into the rigging and went up, climbing like a monkey despite his hook.Reaching the top rigging, Fergus tied the red kerchief that was the signal to hands on shore to come aboard, and slid down again, pausing to say something rude to Ping An, who was perched on the lowest crosstrees, keeping a bright yellow eye on the proceedings below.Fergus seems to be taking quite a proprietary interest in this cargo, I observed.Aye, well, hes a partner, Jamie said.I told him if hed a wife to support, he must think of how to do it.And as it may be some time before were in the printing business again, he must turn his hand to what offers.He and Marsali have half the profit on this cargoagainst the dowry I promised her, he added wryly, and I laughed.You know, I said, I really would like to read the letter Marsalis sending to her mother.First Fergus, I mean, then Father Fogden and Mamacita, and now a dowry of ten tons of bat shit.I shall never be able to set foot in Scotland again, once Laoghaire reads it, said Jamie, but he smiled nonetheless.Have ye thought yet what to do wi your new acquisition?Dont remind me, I said, a little grimly.Where is he?Somewhere below, Jamie said, his attention distracted by a man coming down the wharf toward us.Murphys fed him, and Innes will find a place for him.Your pardon, Sassenach; I think this will be someone looking for me.He swung down from the rail and went down the gangplank, neatly skipping around a slave coming up with a barrowload of guano.I watched with interest as he greeted the man, a tall colonial in the dress of a prosperous planter, with a weathered red face that spoke of long years in the islands.He extended a hand toward Jamie, who took it in a firm clasp.Jamie said something, and the man replied, his expression of wariness changing to an instant cordiality.This must be the result of Jamies visit to the Masonic lodge in Bridgetown, where he had gone immediately upon landing the day before, mindful of Jareds suggestion.He had identified himself as a member of the brotherhood, and spoken to the Master of the lodge, describing Young Ian and asking for any news of either the boy or the ship Bruja.The Master had promised to spread the word among such Freemasons as might have occasion to frequent the slave market and the shipping docks.With luck, this was the fruit of that promise.I watched eagerly as the planter reached into his coat and withdrew a paper, which he unfolded and showed to Jamie, apparently explaining something.Jamies face was intent, his ruddy brows drawn together with concentration, but showed neither exultation nor disappointment.Maybe it was not news of Ian at all.After our visit to the slave market the day before, I was half inclined to hope not.Lawrence, Fergus, Marsali, and I had gone to the slave market under the cranky chaperonage of Murphy, while Jamie called on the Masonic Master.The slave market was near the docks, down a dusty road lined with sellers of fruit and coffee, dried fish and coconuts, yams and red cochineal bugs, sold for dye in small, corked glass bottles.Murphy, with his passion for order and propriety, had insisted that Marsali and I must each have a parasol, and had forced Fergus to buy two from a roadside vendor.All the white women in Bridgetown carry parasols, he said firmly, trying to hand me one.I dont need a parasol, I said, impatient at talk of something so inconsequential as my complexion, when we might be near to finding Ian at last.The sun isnt that hot.Lets go!Murphy glowered at me, scandalized.Ye dont want folk to think ye aint respectable, that ye dont care enough to keep yer skin fine!I wasnt planning to take up residence here, I said tartly.I dont care what they think.Not pausing to argue further, I began walking down the road, toward a distant murmur of noise that I took to be the slave market.Yer face willgetred!Murphy said, huffing indignantly alongside me, attempting to open the parasol as he stumped along.Oh, a fate worse than death, Im sure!I snapped.My nerves were strung tight, in anticipation of what we might find.All right, then, give me the bloody thing!I snatched it from him, snapped it open, and set it over my shoulder with an irritable twirl.As it was, within minutes I was grateful for Murphys intransigence.While the road was shaded by tall palms and cecropia trees, the slave market itself was held in a large, stone paved space without the grace of any shade, save that provided by ramshackle open booths roofed with sheets of tin or palm fronds, in which the slave dealers and auctioneers sought occasional refuge from the sun.The slaves themselves were mostly held in large pens at the side of the square, open to the elements.The sun was fierce in the open, and the light bouncing off the pale stones was blinding after the green shade of the road.I blinked, eyes watering, and hastily adjusted my parasol over my head.So shaded, I could see a bewildering array of bodies, naked or nearly so, gleaming in every shade from pale caf au lait to a deep blue black.Bouquets of color blossomed in front of the auction blocks, where the plantation owners and their servants gathered to inspect the wares, vivid amid the stark blacks and whites.The stink of the place was staggering, even to one accustomed to the stenches of Edinburgh and the reeking tween decks of the Porpoise.Heaps of wet human excrement lay in the corners of the slave pens, buzzing with flies, and a thick oily reek floated on the air, but the major component of the smell was the unpleasantly intimate scent of acres of hot bare flesh, baking in the sun.Jesu, Fergus muttered next to me.His dark eyes flicked right and left in shocked disapproval.Its worse than the slums in Montmartre.Marsali didnt say a word, but drew closer to his side, her nostrils pinched.Lawrence was more matter of fact; I supposed he must have seen slave markets before during his explorations of the islands.The whites are at that end, he said, gesturing toward the far side of the square.Come; well ask for news of any young men sold recently.He placed a large square hand in the center of my back and urged me gently forward through the crowd.Near the edge of the market, an old black woman squatted on the ground, feeding charcoal to a small brazier.As we drew near, a little group of people approached her: a planter, accompanied by two black men dressed in rough cotton shirts and trousers, evidently his servants.One of them was holding the arm of a newly purchased female slave; two other girls, naked but for small strips of cloth wrapped about their middles, were led by ropes around their necks.The planter bent and handed the old woman a coin.She turned and drew several short brass rods from the ground behind her, holding them up for the mans inspection.He studied them for a moment, picked out two, and straightened up.He handed the branding irons to one of his servants, who thrust the ends into the old womans brazier.The other servant stepped behind the girl and pinioned her arms.The first man then pulled the irons from the fire and planted both together on the upper slope of her right breast.She shrieked, a high steam whistle sound loud enough to turn a few heads nearby.The irons pulled away, leaving the letters HB in raw pink flesh.I had stopped dead at the sight of this.Not realizing that I was no longer with them, the others had gone on.I turned round and round, looking vainly for any trace of Lawrence or Fergus.I never had any difficulty finding Jamie in crowds; his bright head was always visible above everyone elses.But Fergus was a small man, Murphy, no taller, and Lawrence, no more than middle height; even Marsalis yellow parasol was lost among the many others in the square.I turned away from the brazier with a shudder, hearing screams and whimpers behind me, but not wanting to look back.I hurried past several auction blocks, eyes averted, but then was slowed and finally stopped by a thickening of the crowd around me.The men and women blocking my way were listening to an auctioneer who was touting the virtues of a one armed slave who stood naked on the block for inspection.He was a short man, but broadly built, with massive thighs and a strong chest.The missing arm had been crudely amputated above the elbow; sweat dripped from the end of the stump.No good for field work, thats true, the auctioneer was admitting.But a sound investment for breeding.Look at those legs!He carried a long rattan cane, which he flicked against the slaves calves, then grinned fatly at the crowd.Will you give a guarantee of virility?the man standing behind me said, with a distinct tone of skepticism.I had a buck three year past, big as a mule, and not a foal dropped on his account; couldnt do a thing, the juba girls said.The crowd tittered at that, and the auctioneer pretended to be offended.Guarantee?he said.He wiped a hand theatrically over his jowls, gathering oily sweat on the palm.See for yourselves, O ye of little faith!Bending slightly, he grasped the slaves penis and began to massage it vigorously.The man grunted in surprise and tried to draw back, but was prevented by the auctioneers assistant, who clutched him firmly by his single arm.There was an outburst of laughter from the crowd, and a few scattered cheers as the soft black flesh hardened and began to swell.Some small thing inside me suddenly snapped; I heard it, distinctly.Outraged by the market, the branding, the nakedness, the crude talk and casual indignity, outraged most of all by my own presence here, I could not even think what I was doing, but began to do it, all the same.I felt very oddly detached, as though I stood outside myself, watching.Stop it!I said, very loudly, hardly recognizing my own voice.The auctioneer looked up, startled, and smiled ingratiatingly at me.He looked directly into my eyes, with a knowing leer.Sound breeding stock, maam, he said.Guaranteed, as you see.I folded my parasol, lowered it, and stabbed the pointed end of it as hard as I could into his fat stomach.He jerked back, eyes bulging in surprise.I yanked the parasol back and smashed it on his head, then dropped it and kicked him, hard.Somewhere deep inside, I knew it would make no difference, would not help in any way, would do nothing but harm.And yet I could not stand here, consenting by silence.It was not for the branded girls, the man on the block, not for any of them that I did it; it was for myself.There was a good deal of noise around me, and hands snatched at me, pulling me off the auctioneer.This worthy, recovered sufficiently from his initial shock, grinned nastily at me, took aim, and slapped the slave hard across the face.I looked around for reinforcements, and caught a quick glimpse of Fergus, face contorted in rage, lunging through the crowd toward the auctioneer.There was a shout, and several men turned in his direction.People began to push and shove.Someone tripped me and I sat down hard on the stones.Through a haze of dust, I saw Murphy, six feet away.With a resigned expression on his broad red face, he bent, detached his wooden leg, straightened up, and hopping gracefully forward, brought it down with great force on the auctioneers head.The man tottered and fell, as the crowd surged back, trying to get out of the way.Fergus, baffled of his prey, skidded to a halt by the fallen man and glared ferociously round.Lawrence, dark, grim, and bulky, came striding through the crowd from the other direction, hand on the cane knife at his belt.I sat on the ground, shaken.I no longer felt detached.I felt sick, and terrified, realizing that I had just committed an act of folly that was likely to result in Fergus, Lawrence, and Murphy being badly beaten, if nothing worse.And then Jamie was there.Stand up, Sassenach, he said quietly, stooping over me and giving me his hands.I managed it, knees shaking.I saw Raeburns long mustache twitching at one side, MacLeod behind him, and realized that his Scots were with him.Then my knees gave way, but Jamies arms held me up.Do something, I said in a choked voice into his chest.Please.Do something.He had.With his usual presence of mind, he had done the only thing that would quell the riot and prevent harm.He had bought the one armed man.And as the ironic result of my little outburst of sensibilities, I was now the appalled owner of a genuine male Guinea slave, one armed, but in glowing health and of guaranteed virility.I sighed, trying not to think of the man, presumably now somewhere under my feet, fed, andI hopedclad.The papers of ownership, which I had refused even to touch, said that he was a full blooded Gold Coast Negro, a Yoruba, sold by a French planter from Barbuda, one armed, bearing a brand on the left shoulder of a fleur de lys and the initial A, and known by the name Temeraire.The Bold One.The papers did not suggest what in the name of God I was to do with him.Jamie had finished looking at the papers his Masonic acquaintance had broughtthey were very like the ones I had received for Temeraire, so far as I could see from the rail of the ship.He handed them back with a bow of thanks, a slight frown on his face.The men exchanged a few more words, and parted with another handshake.Is everyone aboard?Jamie asked, stepping off the gangplank.There was a light breeze; it fluttered the dark blue ribbon that tied back the thick tail of his hair.Aye, sir, said Mr.Warren, with the casual jerk of the head that passed for a salute in a merchant ship.Shall we make sail?We shall, if ye please.Thank ye, Mr.Warren.With a small bow, Jamie passed him and came to stand beside me.No, he said quietly.His face was calm, but I could feel the depths of his disappointment.Interviews the day before with the two men who dealt in white indentured labor at the slave market had provided no useful informationthe Masonic planter had been a beacon of last minute hope.There wasnt anything helpful to be said.I put my hand over his where it lay on the rail, and squeezed lightly.Jamie looked down and gave me a faint smile.He took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders, shrugging to settle his coat over them.Aye, well.Ive learned something, at least.That was a Mr.Villiers, who owns a large sugar plantation here.He bought six slaves from the captain of the ship Bruja, three days agobut none of them Ian.Three days?I was startled.Butthe Bruja left Hispaniola more than two weeks ago!He nodded, rubbing his cheek.He had shaved, a necessity before making public inquiries, and his skin glowed fresh and ruddy above the snowy linen of his stock.She did.And she arrived here on Wednesdayfive days ago.So shed been somewhere else, before coming to Barbados!Do we know where?He shook his head.Villiers didna ken.He said he had spoken some time wi the captain of the Bruja, and the man seemed verra secretive about where hed been and what hed been doing.Villiers thought no great thing of it, knowin as the Bruja has a reputation as a crook shipand seein as how the captain was willing to sell the slaves for a good price.Stillhe brightened slightlyVilliers did show me the papers for the slaves hed bought.Yell have seen those for your slave?I wish you wouldnt call him that, I said.But yes.Were the ones you saw the same?Not quite.Three o the papers gave no previous ownerthough Villiers says they were none of them fresh from Africa; all of them have a few words of English, at least.One listed a previous owner, but the name had been scratched out; I couldna read it.The other two gave a Mrs.Abernathy of Rose Hall, Jamaica, as the previous owner.Jamaica?How far  I dinna ken, he interrupted.But Mr.Warren will know.It may be right.In any case, I think we must go to Jamaica nextif only to dispose of our cargo before we all die o disgust.He wrinkled his long nose fastidiously and I laughed.You look like an anteater when you do that, I told him.The attempt to distract him was successful; the wide mouth curved upward slightly.Oh, aye?Theres a beastie eats ants, is there?He did his best to respond to the teasing, turning his back on the Barbados docks.He leaned against the rail and smiled down at me.I shouldna think theyd be verra filling.I suppose it must eat a lot of them.They cant be any worse than haggis, after all.I took a breath before going on, and let it out quickly, coughing.God, whats that?The Artemis had by now slid free of the loading wharf and out into the harbor.As we came about into the wind, a deep, pungent smell struck the ship, a lower and more sinister note in the olfactory dockside symphony of dead barnacles, wet wood, fish, rotted seaweed, and the constant warm breath of the tropical vegetation on shore.I pressed my handkerchief hard over my nose and mouth.What is it?Were passing the burning ground, mum, at the foot o the slave market, Maitland explained, overhearing my question.He pointed toward the shore, where a plume of white smoke rose from behind a screen of bayberry bushes.They burn the bodies of the slaves who dont survive their passage from Africa, he explained.First they unload the living cargo, and then, as the ship is swabbed out, the bodies are removed and thrown onto the pyre here, to prevent sickness spreading into the town.I looked at Jamie, and found the same fear in his face that showed in my own.How often do they burn bodies?I asked.Every day?Dont know, mum, but I dont think so.Maybe once a week?Maitland shrugged and went on about his duties.We have to look, I said.My voice sounded strange to my own ears, calm and clear.I didnt feel that way.Jamie had gone very pale.He had turned round again, and his eyes were fixed on the plume of smoke, rising thick and white from behind the palm trees.His lips pressed tight, then, and his jaw set hard.Aye, was all he said, and turned to tell Mr.Warren to put about.The keeper of the flames, a wizened little creature of indistinguishable color and accent, was vociferously shocked at the notion that a lady should enter the burning ground, but Jamie elbowed him brusquely aside.He didnt try to prevent me following him, or turn to see that I did; he knew I would not leave him alone here.It was a small hollow, set behind a screen of trees, convenient to a small wharf that extended into the river.Black smeared pitch barrels and piles of dry wood stood in grim sticky clumps amid the brilliant greens of tree ferns and dwarf poinciana.To the right, a huge pyre had been built, with a platform of wood, onto which the bodies had been thrown, dribbled with pitch.This had been lit only a short time before; a good blaze had started at one side of the heap, but only small tongues of flame licked up from the rest.It was smoke that obscured the bodies, rolling up over the heap in a wavering thick veil that gave the outflung limbs a horrid illusion of movement.Jamie had stopped, staring at the heap.Then he sprang onto the platform, heedless of smoke and scorching, and began jerking bodies loose, grimly pawing through the grisly remains.A smaller heap of gray ashes and shards of pure white friable bone lay nearby.The curve of an occiput lay on top of the heap, fragile and perfect as an eggshell.Makee fine crop.The soot smeared little creature who tended the fire was at my elbow, offering information in evident hopes of reward.Heor shepointed at the ashes.Put on crop; makee grow grow.No, thank you, I said faintly.The smoke obscured Jamies figure for a moment, and I had the terrible feeling that he had fallen, was burning in the pyre.The horrible, jolly smell of roasting meat rose on the air, and I thought I would be sick.Jamie!I called.Jamie!He didnt answer, but I heard a deep, racking cough from the heart of the fire.Several long minutes later, the veil of smoke parted, and he staggered out, choking.He made his way down the platform and stood bent over, coughing his lungs out.He was covered with an oily soot, his hands and clothes smeared with pitch.He was blind with the smoke; tears poured down his cheeks, making runnels in the soot.I threw several coins to the keeper of the pyre, and taking Jamie by the arm, led him, blind and choking, out of the valley of death.Under the palms, he sank to his knees and threw up.Dont touch me, he gasped, when I tried to help him.He retched over and over again, but finally stopped, swaying on his knees.Then he slowly staggered to his feet.Dont touch me, he said again.His voice, roughened by smoke and sickness, was that of a stranger.He walked to the edge of the dock, removed his coat and shoes, and dived into the water, fully clothed.I waited for a moment, then stooped and picked up the coat and shoes, holding them gingerly at arms length.I could see in the inner pocket the faint rectangular bulge of Briannas pictures.I waited until he came back and hoisted himself out of the water, dripping.The pitch smears were still there, but most of the soot and the smell of the fire were gone.He sat on the wharf, head on his knees, breathing hard.A row of curious faces edged the Artemiss rail above us.Not knowing what else to do, I leaned down and laid a hand on his shoulder.Without raising his head, he reached up a hand and grasped mine.He wasnt there, he said, in his muffled, rasping strangers voice.The breeze was freshening; it stirred the tendrils of wet hair that lay across his shoulders.I looked back, to see that the plume of smoke rising from the little valley had changed to black.It flattened and began to drift out over the sea, the ashes of the dead slaves fleeing on the wind, back toward Africa.54  THE IMPETUOUS PIRATE  I cant own anyone, Jamie, I said, looking in dismay at the papers spread out in the lamplight before me.I just cant.It isnt right.Well, Im inclined to agree wi ye, Sassenach.But what are we to do with the fellow?Jamie sat on the berth next to me, close enough to see the ownership documents over my shoulder.He rubbed a hand through his hair frowning.We could set him freethat would seem the right thingand yet, if we dowhat will happen to him then?He hunched forward, squinting down his nose to read the papers.Hes no more than a bit of French and English; no skills to speak of.If we were to set him free, or even give him a bit of moneycan he manage to live, on his own?I nibbled thoughtfully on one of Murphys cheese rolls.It was good, but the smell of the burning oil in the lamp blended oddly with the aromatic cheese, underlaidas everything waswith the insidious scent of bat guano that permeated the ship.I dont know, I said.Lawrence told me there are a lot of free blacks on Hispaniola.Lots of Creoles and mixed race people, and a good many who own their own businesses.Is it like that on Jamaica, too?He shook his head, and reached for a roll from the tray.I dinna think so.Its true, there are some free blacks who earn a living for themselves, but those are the ones who have some skillsempstresses and fishers and such.I spoke to this Temeraire a bit.He was a cane cutter until he lost his arm, and doesna ken how to do anything else much.I laid the roll down, barely tasted, and frowned unhappily at the papers.The mere idea of owning a slave frightened and disgusted me, but it was beginning to dawn on me that it might not be so simple to divest myself of the responsibility.The man had been taken from a barracoon on the Guinea coast, five years before.My original impulse, to return him to his home, was clearly impossible; even had it been possible to find a ship headed for Africa that would agree to take him as a passenger, the overwhelming likelihood was that he would be immediately enslaved again, either by the ship that accepted him, or by another slaver in the West African ports.Traveling alone, one armed and ignorant, he would have no protection at all.And even if he should by some miracle reach Africa safely and keep himself out of the hands of both European and African slavers, there was virtually no chance of his ever finding his way back to his village.Should he do so, Lawrence had kindly explained, he would likely be killed or driven away, as his own people would regard him now as a ghost, and a danger to them.I dinna suppose ye would consider selling him?Jamie put the question delicately, raising one eyebrow.To someone we could be sure would treat him kindly?I rubbed two fingers between my brows, trying to soothe the growing headache.I cant see that thats any better than owning him ourselves, I protested.Worse, probably, because we couldnt be sure what the new owners would do with him.Jamie sighed.He had spent most of the day climbing through the dark, reeking cargo holds with Fergus, making up inventories against our arrival in Jamaica, and he was tired.Aye, I see that, he said.But its no kindness to free him to starve, that I can see.No.I fought back the uncharitable wish that I had never seen the one armed slave.It would have been a great deal easier for me if I had notbut possibly not for him.Jamie rose from the berth and stretched himself, leaning on the desk and flexing his shoulders to ease them.He bent and kissed me on the forehead, between the brows.Dinna fash, Sassenach.Ill speak to the manager at Jareds plantation.Perhaps he can find the man some employment, or else  A warning shout from above interrupted him.Ship ahoy!Look alive, below!Off the port bow, ahoy!The lookouts cry was urgent, and there was a sudden rush and stir, as hands began to turn out.Then there was a lot more shouting, and a jerk and shudder as the Artemis backed her sails.What in the name of God Jamie began.A rending crash drowned his words, and he pitched sideways, eyes wide with alarm, as the cabin tilted.The stool I was on fell over, throwing me onto the floor.The oil lamp had shot from its bracket, luckily extinguishing itself before hitting the floor, and the place was in darkness.Sassenach!Are ye all right?Jamies voice came out of the murk close at hand, sharp with anxiety.Yes, I said, scrambling out from under the table.Are you?What happened?Did someone hit us?Not pausing to answer any of these questions, Jamie had reached the door and opened it.A babel of shouts and thumps came down from the deck above, punctuated by the sudden popcorn sound of small arms fire.Pirates, he said briefly.Weve been boarded.My eyes were becoming accustomed to the dim light; I saw his shadow lunge for the desk, reaching for the pistol in the drawer.He paused to snatch the dirk from under the pillow of his berth, and made for the door, issuing instructions as he went.Take Marsali, Sassenach, and get below.Go aft as far as ye can getthe big hold where the guano blocks are.Get behind them, and stay there.Then he was gone.I spent a moment feeling my way through the cupboard over my berth, in search of the morocco box Mother Hildegarde had given me when I saw her in Paris.A scalpel might be little use against pirates, but I would feel better with a weapon of some kind in my hand, no matter how small.Mother Claire?Marsalis voice came from the door, high and scared.Im here, I said.I caught the gleam of pale cotton as she moved, and pressed the ivory letter opener into her hand.Here, take this, just in case.Come on; were to go below.With a long handled amputation blade in one hand, and a cluster of scalpels in the other, I led the way through the ship to the after hold.Feet thundered on the deck overhead, and curses and shouts rang through the night, overlaid with a dreadful groaning, scraping noise that I thought must be caused by the rubbing of the Artemiss timbers against those of the unknown ship that had rammed us.The hold was black as pitch and thick with dusty fumes.We made our way slowly, coughing, toward the back of the hold.Who are they?Marsali asked.Her voice had a strangely muffled sound, the echoes of the hold deadened by the blocks of guano stacked around us.Pirates, dye think?I expect they must be.Lawrence had told us that the Caribbean was a rich hunting ground for pirate luggers and unscrupulous craft of all kinds, but we had expected no trouble, as our cargo was not particularly valuable.I suppose they must not have much sense of smell.Eh?Never mind, I said.Come sit down; theres nothing we can do but wait.I knew from experience that waiting while men fought was one of the most difficult things in life to do, but in this case, there wasnt any sensible alternative.Down here, the sounds of the battle were muted to a distant thumping, though the constant rending groan of the scraping timbers echoed through the whole ship.Oh, God, Fergus, Marsali whispered, listening, her voice filled with agony.Blessed Mary, save him!I silently echoed the prayer, thinking of Jamie, somewhere in the chaos overhead.I crossed myself in the dark, touching the small spot between my brows that he had kissed a few minutes before, not wanting to think that it could so easily be the last touch of him I would ever know.Suddenly, there was an explosion overhead, a roar that sent vibrations through the jutting timbers we were sitting on.Theyre blowing up the ship!Marsali jumped to her feet, panicked.Theyll sink us!We must get out!Well drown down here!Wait!I called.Its only the guns!but she had not waited to hear.I could hear her, blundering about in a blind panic, whimpering among the blocks of guano.Marsali!Come back!There was no light at all in the hold; I took a few steps through the smothering atmosphere, trying to locate her by sound, but the deadening effect of the crumbling blocks hid her movements from me.There was another booming explosion overhead, and a third close on its heels.The air was filled with dust loosed from the vibrations, and I choked, eyes watering.I wiped at my eyes with a sleeve, and blinked.I was not imagining it; there was a light in the hold, a dim glow that limned the edge of the nearest block.Marsali?I called.Where are you?The answer was a terrified shriek, from the direction of the light.I dashed around the edge of the block, dodged between two others, and emerged into the space by the ladder, to find Marsali in the clutches of a large, half naked man.He was hugely obese, the rolling layers of his fat decorated with a stipple of tattoos, a jangling necklace of coins and buttons hung round his neck.Marsali slapped at him, shrieking, and he jerked his face away, impatient.Then he caught sight of me, and his eyes widened.He had a wide, flat face, and a tarred topknot of black hair.He grinned nastily at me, showing a marked lack of teeth, and said something that sounded like slurred Spanish.Let her go!I said loudly.Basta, cabrn!That was as much Spanish as I could summon; he seemed to think it funny, for he grinned more widely, let go of Marsali, and turned toward me.I threw one of my scalpels at him.It bounced off his head, startling him, and he ducked wildly.Marsali dodged past him, and sprang for the ladder.The pirate waffled for a moment, torn between us, but then turned to the ladder, leaping up several rungs with an agility that belied his weight.He caught Marsali by the foot as she dived through the hatch, and she screamed.Cursing incoherently under my breath, I ran to the bottom of the ladder, and reaching up, swung the long handled amputation knife at his foot, as hard as I could.There was a high pitched screech from the pirate.Something flew past my head, and a spray of blood spattered across my cheek, wet hot on my skin.Startled, I dropped back, looking down by reflex to see what had fallen.It was a small brown toe, calloused and black nailed, smudged with dirt.The pirate hit the deck beside me with a thud that shivered the floorboards, and lunged.I ducked, but he caught a handful of my sleeve.I yanked away, ripping fabric, and jabbed at his face with the blade in my hand.Jerking back in surprise, he slipped on his own blood and fell.I jumped for the ladder and climbed for my life, dropping the blade.He was so close behind me that he succeeded in catching hold of the hem of my skirt, but I pulled it from his grasp and lunged upward, lungs burning from the dust of the choking hold.The man was shouting, a language I didnt know.Some dim recess of my brain, not occupied with immediate survival, speculated that it might be Portuguese.I burst out of the hold onto the deck, into the midst of a surging chaos.The air was thick with black powder smoke, and small knots of men were pushing and shoving, cursing and stumbling all over the deck.I couldnt take time to look around; there was a hoarse bellow from the hatchway behind me, and I dived for the rail.I hesitated for a moment, balanced on the narrow wooden strip.The sea spun past in a dizzy churn of black below.I grasped the rigging and began to climb.It was a mistake; I knew that almost at once.He was a sailor, I was not.Neither was he hampered by wearing a dress.The ropes danced and jerked in my hands, vibrating under the impact of his weight as he hit the lines below me.He was coming up the underside of the lines, climbing like a gibbon, even as I made my slower way across the upper slope of the rigging.He drew even with me, and spat in my face.I kept climbing, propelled by desperation; there was nothing else to do.He kept pace with me, easily, hissing words through an evil, half toothed grin.It didnt matter what language he was speaking; his meaning was perfectly clear.Hanging by one hand, he drew the cutlass from his sash, and swung it in a vicious cut that barely missed me.I was too frightened even to scream.There was nowhere to go, nothing to do.I squeezed my eyes tight shut, and hoped it would be quick.It was.There was a sort of thump, a sharp grunt, and a strong smell of fish.I opened my eyes.The pirate was gone.Ping An was sitting on the crosstrees, three feet away, crest erect with irritation, wings half spread to keep his balance.Gwa!he said crossly.He turned a beady little yellow eye on me, and clacked his bill in warning.Ping An hated noise and commotion.Evidently, he didnt like Portuguese pirates, either.There were spots before my eyes, and I felt light headed.I clung tight to the rope, shaking, until I thought I could move again.The noise below had slackened now, and the tenor of the shouting had changed.Something had happened; I thought it was over.There was a new noise, a sudden flap of sails, and a long, grinding sound, with a vibration that made the line I was holding sing in my hand.It was over; the pirate ship was moving away.On the far side of the Artemis, I saw the web of the pirates mast and rigging begin to move, black against the silver Caribbean sky.Very, very slowly, I began the long trip back down.The lanterns were still lit below.A haze of black powder smoke lay over everything, and bodies lay here and there about the deck.My glance flickered over them as I lowered myself, searching for red hair.I found it, and my heart leapt.Jamie was sitting on a cask near the wheel, with his head tilted back, eyes closed, a cloth pressed to his brow, and a cup of whisky in his hand.Mr.Willoughby was on his knees alongside, administering first aidin the form of more whiskyto Willie MacLeod, who sat against the foremast, looking sick.I was shaking all over from exertion and reaction.I felt giddy and slightly cold.Shock, I supposed, and no wonder.I could do with a bit of that whisky as well.I grasped the smaller lines above the rail, and slid the rest of the way to the deck, not caring that my palms were skinned raw.I was sweating and cold at the same time, and the down hairs on my face were prickling unpleasantly.I landed clumsily, with a thump that made Jamie straighten up and open his eyes.The look of relief in them pulled me the few feet to him.I felt better, with the warm solid flesh of his shoulder under my hand.Are you all right?I said, leaning over him to look.Aye, its no more than a wee dunt, he said, smiling up at me.There was a small gash at his hairline, where something like a pistol butt had caught him, but the blood had clotted already.There were stains of dark, drying blood on the front of his shirt, but the sleeve of his shirt was also bloody.In fact, it was nearly soaked, with fresh bright red.Jamie!I clutched at his shoulder, my vision going white at the edges.You arent all rightlook, youre bleeding!My hands and feet were numb, and I only half felt his hands grasp my arms as he rose from the cask in sudden alarm.The last thing I saw, amid flashes of light, was his face, gone white beneath the tan.My God!said his frightened voice, out of the whirling blackness.Its no my blood, Sassenach, its yours!I am not going to die, I said crossly, unless its from heat exhaustion.Take some of this bloody stuff off me!Marsali, who had been tearfully pleading with me not to expire, looked rather relieved at this outburst.She stopped crying and sniffed hopefully, but made no move to remove any of the cloaks, coats, blankets, and other impedimenta in which I was swaddled.Oh, I canna do that, Mother Claire!she said.Da says ye must be kept warm!Warm?Im being boiled alive!I was in the captains cabin, and even with the stern windows wide open, the atmosphere belowdecks was stifling, hot with sun and acrid with the fumes of the cargo.I tried to struggle out from under my wrappings, but got no more than a few inches before a bolt of lightning struck me in the right arm.The world went dark, with small bright flashes zigging through my vision.Lie still, said a stern Scots voice, through a wave of giddy sickness.An arm was under my shoulders, a large hand cradling my head.Aye, thats right, lie back on my arm.All right now, Sassenach?No, I said, looking at the colored pinwheels inside my eyelids.Im going to be sick.I was, and a most unpleasant process it was, too, with fiery knives being jabbed into my right arm with each spasm.Jesus H.  Roosevelt Christ, I said at last, gasping.Finished, are ye?Jamie lowered me carefully and eased my head back onto the pillow.If you mean am I dead, the answer is unfortunately no.I cracked one eyelid open.He was kneeling by my berth, looking no end piratical himself, with a bloodstained strip of cloth bound round his head, and still wearing his blood soaked shirt.He stayed still, and so did the cabin, so I cautiously opened the other eye.He smiled faintly at me.No, youre no dead; Fergus will be glad to hear it.As though this had been a signal, the Frenchmans head poked anxiously into the cabin.Seeing me awake, his face broke into a dazzling smile and disappeared.I could hear his voice overhead, loudly informing the crew of my survival.To my profound embarrassment, the news was greeted with a rousing cheer from the upper deck.What happened?I asked.What happened?Jamie, pouring water into a cup, stopped and stared over the rim at me.He knelt down again beside me, snorting, and raised my head for a sip of water.What happened, she says!Aye, what indeed?I tell ye to stay all snug below wi Marsali, and next thing I ken, yeve dropped out of the sky and landed at my feet, sopping wi blood!He shoved his face into the berth and glared at me.Sufficiently impressive when clean shaven and unhurt, he was considerably more ferocious when viewed, stubbled, bloodstained, and angry, at a distance of six inches.I promptly shut my eyes again.Look at me!he said peremptorily, and I did, against my better judgment.Blue eyes bored into mine, narrowed with fury.Dye ken ye came damn close to dying?he demanded.Yeve a bone deep slash down your arm from oxter to elbow, and had I not got a cloth round it in time, yed be feeding the sharks this minute!One big fist crashed down on the side of the berth next to me, making me start.The movement hurt my arm, but I didnt make a sound.Damn ye, woman!Will ye never do as youre told?Probably not, I said meekly.He turned a black scowl on me, but I could see the corner of his mouth twitching under the copper stubble.God, he said longingly.What I wouldna give to have ye tied facedown over a gun, and me wi a ropes end in my hand.He snorted again, and pulled his face out of the berth.Willoughby!he bellowed.In short order, Mr.Willoughby trotted in, beaming, with a steaming pot of tea and a bottle of brandy on a tray.Tea!I breathed, struggling to sit up.Ambrosia.In spite of the stifling atmosphere of the cabin, the hot tea was just what I needed.The delightful, brandy laced stuff slid down my throat and glowed peacefully in the pit of my quivering stomach.Nobody makes tea better than the English, I said, inhaling the aroma, except the Chinese.Mr.Willoughby beamed in gratification and bowed ceremoniously.Jamie snorted again, bringing his total up to three for the afternoon.Aye?Well, enjoy it while ye can.This sounded more or less sinister, and I stared at him over the rim of the cup.And just what do you mean by that?I demanded.Im going to doctor your arm when youre finished, he informed me.He picked up the pot and peered into it.How much blood did ye tell me a person has in his body?he asked.About eight quarts, I said, bewildered.Why?He lowered the pot and glared at me.Because, he said precisely, judging from the amount ye left on the deck, youve maybe four of them left.Here, have some more.He refilled the cup, set down the pot, and stalked out.Im afraid Jamies rather annoyed with me, I observed ruefully to Mr.Willoughby.Not angry, he said comfortingly.Tsei mi scared very bad.The little Chinaman laid a hand on my right shoulder, delicate as a resting butterfly.This hurts?I sighed.To be perfectly honest, I said, yes, it does.Mr.Willoughby smiled and patted me gently.I help, he said consolingly.Later.In spite of the throbbing in my arm, I was feeling sufficiently restored to inquire about the rest of the crew, whose injuries, as reported by Mr.Willoughby, were limited to cuts and bruises, plus one concussion and a minor arm fracture.A clatter in the passage heralded Jamies return, accompanied by Fergus, who carried my medicine box under one arm, and yet another bottle of brandy in his hand.All right, I said, resigned.Lets have a look at it.I was no stranger to horrible wounds, and this onetechnically speakingwas not all that bad.On the other hand, it was my own personal flesh involved here, and I was not disposed to be technical.Ooh, I said rather faintly.While being a bit picturesque about the nature of the wound, Jamie had also been quite accurate.It was a long, clean edged slash, running at a slight angle across the front of my biceps, from the shoulder to an inch or so above the elbow joint.And while I couldnt actually see the bone of my humerus, it was without doubt a very deep wound, gaping widely at the edges.It was still bleeding, in spite of the cloth that had been wrapped tightly round it, but the seepage was slow; no major vessels seemed to have been severed.Jamie had flipped open my medical box and was rootling meditatively through it with one large forefinger.Youll need sutures and a needle, I said, feeling a sudden jolt of alarm as it occurred to me that I was about to have thirty or forty stitches taken in my arm, with no anesthesia bar brandy.No laudanum?Jamie asked, frowning into the box.Evidently, he had been thinking along the same lines.No.I used it all on the Porpoise.Controlling the shaking of my left hand, I poured a sizable tot of straight brandy into my empty teacup, and took a healthy mouthful.That was thoughtful of you, Fergus, I said, nodding at the fresh brandy bottle as I sipped, but I dont think its going to take two bottles.Given the potency of Jareds French brandy, it was unlikely to take more than a teacupful.I was wondering whether it was more advisable to get dead drunk at once, or to stay at least half sober in order to supervise operations; there wasnt a chance in hell that I could do the suturing myself, left handed and shaking like a leaf.Neither could Fergus do it one handed.True, Jamies big hands could move with amazing lightness over some tasks, but  Jamie interrupted my apprehensions, shaking his head and picking up the second bottle.This ones no for drinking, Sassenach, thats for washing out the wound.What!In my state of shock, I had forgotten the necessity for disinfection.Lacking anything better, I normally washed out wounds with distilled grain alcohol, cut half and half with water, but I had used my supply of that as well, in our encounter with the man of war.I felt my lips go slightly numb, and not just because the internal brandy was taking effect.Highlanders were among the most stoic and courageous of warriors, and seamen as a class werent far behind.I had seen such men lie uncomplaining while I set broken bones, did minor surgery, sewed up terrible wounds, and put them through hell generally, but when it came to disinfection with alcohol, it was a different storythe screams could be heard for miles.Erwait a minute, I said.Maybe just a little boiled water.Jamie was watching me, not without sympathy.It willna get easier wi waiting, Sassenach, he said.Fergus, take the bottle.And before I could protest, he had lifted me out of the berth and sat down with me on his lap, holding me tight about the body, pinning my left arm so I couldnt struggle, while he took my right wrist in a firm grip and held my wounded arm out to the side.I believe it was bloody old Ernest Hemingway who said youre supposed to pass out from pain, but unfortunately you never do.All I can say in response to that is that either Ernest had a fine distinction for states of consciousness, or else no one ever poured brandy on several cubic inches of his raw flesh.To be fair, I suppose I must not absolutely have lost consciousness myself, since when I began noticing things again, Fergus was saying, Please, milady!You must not scream like that; it upsets the men.Clearly it upset Fergus; his lean face was pale, and droplets of sweat ran down his jaw.He was right about the men, tooseveral faces were peering into the cabin from door and window, wearing expressions of horror and concern.I summoned the presence of mind to nod weakly at them.Jamies arm was still locked about my middle; I couldnt tell which of us was shaking; both, I thought.I made it into the wide captains chair, with considerable assistance, and lay back palpitating, the fire in my arm still sizzling.Jamie was holding one of my curved suture needles and a length of sterilized cat gut, looking as dubious over the prospects as I felt.It was Mr.Willoughby who intervened, quietly taking the needle from Jamies hands.I can do this, he said, in tones of authority.A moment.And he disappeared aft, presumably to fetch something.Jamie didnt protest, and neither did I.  We heaved twin sighs of relief, in fact, which made me laugh.And to think, I said, I once told Bree that big men were kind and gentle, and the short ones tended to be nasty.Well, I suppose theres always the exception that proves the rule, no?He mopped my streaming face with a wet cloth, quite gently.I dinna want to know how ye did this, he said, with a sigh, but for Gods sake, Sassenach, dont do it again!Well, I didnt intend to do anything I began crossly, when I was interrupted by the return of Mr.Willoughby.He was carrying the little roll of green silk I had seen when he cured Jamies seasickness.Oh, yeve got the wee stabbers?Jamie peered interestedly at the small gold needles, then smiled at me.Dinna fash yourself, Sassenach, they dont hurtor not much, anyway, he added.Mr.Willoughbys fingers probed the palm of my right hand, prodding here and there.Then he grasped each of my fingers, wiggled it, and pulled it gently, so that I felt the joints pop slightly.Then he laid two fingers at the base of my wrist, pressing down in the space between the radius and the ulna.This is the Inner Gate, he said softly.Here is quiet.Here is peace.I sincerely hoped he was right.Picking up one of the tiny gold needles, he placed the point over the spot he had marked, and with a dexterous twirl of thumb and forefinger, pierced the skin.The prick made me jump, but he kept a tight, warm hold on my hand, and I relaxed again.He placed three needles in each wrist, and a rakish, porcupine like spray on the crest of my right shoulder.I was getting interested, despite my guinea pig status.Beyond an initial prick at placement, the needles caused no discomfort.Mr.Willoughby was humming, in a low, soothing sort of way, tapping and pressing places on my neck and shoulder.I couldnt honestly tell whether my right arm was numbed, or whether I was simply distracted by the goings on, but it did feel somewhat less agonizedat least until he picked up the suture needle and began.Jamie was sitting on a stool by my left side, holding my left hand as he watched my face.After a moment, he said, rather gruffly, Let your breath out, Sassenach; its no going to get any worse than that.I let go of the breath I hadnt realized I was holding, and realized as well what he was telling me.It was dread of being hurt that had me rigid as a board in the chair.The actual pain of the stitches was unpleasant, all right, but nothing I couldnt stand.I let my breath out cautiously, and gave him a rough approximation of a smile.Mr.Willoughby was singing under his breath in Chinese.Jamie had translated the words for me a week earlier; it was a pillow song, in which a young man catalogued the physical charms of his partner, one by one.I hoped he would finish the stitching before he got to her feet.Thats a verra wicked slash, Jamie said, eyes on Mr.Willoughbys work.I preferred not to look myself.A parang, was it, or a cutlass, I wonder?I think it was a cutlass, I said.In fact, I know it was.He came after  I wonder what led them to attack us, Jamie said, not paying any attention to me.His brows were drawn in speculation.It canna ha been the cargo, after all.I shouldnt think so, I said.But maybe they didnt know what we were carrying?This seemed grossly unlikely; any ship that came within a hundred yards of us would have knownthe ammoniac reek of bat guano hovered round us like a miasma.Perhaps its only they thought the ship small enough to take.The Artemis itself would bring a fair price, cargo or no.I blinked as Mr.Willoughby paused in his song to tie a knot.I thought he was down to the navel by now, but wasnt paying close attention.Do we know the name of the pirate ship?I asked.Granted, theres likely a lot of pirates in these waters, but we do know that the Bruja was in this area three days ago, and  Thats what Im wondering, he said.I couldna see a great deal in the darkness, but she was the right size, wi that wide Spanish beam.Well, the pirate that was after me spoke I started, but the sound of voices in the corridor made me stop.Fergus edged in, shy of interrupting, but obviously bursting with excitement.He held something shiny and jingling in one hand.Milord, he said, Maitland has found a dead pirate on the forward deck.Jamies red brows went up, and he looked from Fergus to me.Dead?Very dead, milord, said Fergus, with a small shudder.Maitland was peeking over his shoulder, anxious to claim his share of the glory.Oh, yes, sir, he assured Jamie earnestly.Dead as a doornail; his poor heads bashed in something shocking!All three men turned and stared at me.I gave them a modest little smile.Jamie rubbed a hand over his face.His eyes were bloodshot, and a trickle of blood had dried in front of his ear.Sassenach, he began, in measured tones.I tried to tell you, I said virtuously.Between shock, brandy, acupuncture, and the dawning realization of survival, I was beginning to feel quite pleasantly light headed.I scarcely noticed Mr.Willoughbys final efforts.He was wearing this, milord.Fergus stepped forward and laid the pirates necklace on the table in front of us.It had the silver buttons from a military uniform, polished kona nuts, several large sharks teeth, pieces of polished abalone shell and chunks of mother of pearl, and a large number of jingling coins, all pierced for stringing on a leather thong.I thought you should see this at once, milord, Fergus continued.He reached out a hand and lifted one of the shimmering coins.It was silver, untarnished, and through the gathering brandy haze, I could see on its face the twin heads of Alexander.A tetradrachm, of the fourth century B. C.  Mint condition.Thoroughly worn out by the events of the afternoon, I had fallen asleep at once, the pain in my arm dulled by brandy.Now it was full dark, and the brandy had worn off.My arm seemed to swell and throb with each beat of my heart, and any small movement sent tiny jabs of a sharper pain whipping through my arm, like warning flicks of a scorpions tail.The moon was three quarters full, a huge lopsided shape like a golden teardrop, hanging just above the horizon.The ship heeled slightly, and the moon slid slowly out of sight, the Man in the Moon leering rather unpleasantly as he went.I was hot, and possibly a trifle feverish.There was a jug of water in the cupboard on the far side of the cabin.I felt weak and giddy as I swung my feet over the edge of the berth, and my arm registered a strong protest against being disturbed.I must have made some sound, for the darkness on the floor of the cabin stirred suddenly, and Jamies voice came drowsily from the region of my feet.Are ye hurting, Sassenach?A little, I said, not wanting to be dramatic about it.I set my lips and rose unsteadily to my feet, cradling my right elbow in my left hand.Thats good, he said.Thats good?I said, my voice rising indignantly.There was a soft chuckle from the darkness, and he sat up, his head popping suddenly into sight as it rose above the shadows into the moonlight.Aye, it is, he said.When a wound begins to hurt ye, it means its healing.Ye didna feel it when it happened, did you?No, I admitted.I certainly felt it now.The air was a good deal cooler out on the open sea, and the salt wind coming through the window felt good on my face.I was damp and sticky with sweat, and the thin chemise clung to my breasts.I could see ye didnt.Thats what frightened me.Ye never feel a fatal wound, Sassenach, he said softly.I laughed shortly, but cut it off as the movement jarred my arm.And how do you know that?I asked, fumbling left handed to pour water into a cup.Not the sort of thing youd learn firsthand, I mean.Murtagh told me.The water seemed to purl soundlessly into the cup, the sound of its pouring lost in the hiss of the bow wave outside.I set down the jug and lifted the cup, the surface of the water black in the moonlight.Jamie had never mentioned Murtagh to me, in the months of our reunion.I had asked Fergus, who told me that the wiry little Scot had died at Culloden, but he knew no more than the bare fact.At Culloden.Jamies voice was barely loud enough to be heard above the creak of timber and the whirring of the wind that bore us along.Did ye ken they burnt the bodies there?I wondered, listening to them do itwhat it would be like inside the fire when it came my turn.I could hear him swallow, above the creaking of the ship.I found that out, this morning.The moonlight robbed his face of depth and color; he looked like a skull, with the broad, clean planes of cheek and jawbone white and his eyes black empty pits.I went to Culloden meaning to die, he said, his voice scarcely more than a whisper.Not the rest of them.I should have been happy to stop a musket ball at once, and yet I cut my way across the field and halfway back, while men on either side o me were blown to bloody bits.He stood up, then, looking down at me.Why?he said.Why, Claire?Why am I alive, and they are not?I dont know, I said softly.For your sister, and your family, maybe?For me?They had families, he said.Wives, and sweethearts; children to mourn them.And yet they are gone.And I am still here.I dont know, Jamie, I said at last.I touched his cheek, already roughened by newly sprouting beard, irrepressible evidence of life.You arent ever going to know.He sighed, his cheekbone pressed against my palm for a moment.Aye, I ken that well enough.But I canna help the asking, when I think of themespecially Murtagh.He turned restlessly away, his eyes empty shadows, and I knew he walked Drumossie Moor again, with the ghosts.We should have gone sooner; the men had been standing for hours, starved and half frozen.But they waited for His Highness to give the order to charge.And Charles Stuart, perched safely on a rock, well behind the line of battle, having seized personal command of his troops for the first time, had dithered and delayed.And the English cannon had had time to bear squarely on the lines of ragged Highlanders, and opened fire.It was a relief, I think, Jamie said softly.Every man on the field knew the cause was lost, and we were dead.And still we stood there, watching the English guns come up, and the cannon mouths open black before us.No one spoke.I couldna hear anything but the wind, and the English soldiers shouting, on the other side of the field.And then the guns had roared, and men had fallen, and those still standing, rallied by a late and ragged order, had seized their swords and charged the enemy, the sound of their Gaelic shrieking drowned by the guns, lost in the wind.The smoke was so thick, I couldna see more than a few feet before me.I kicked off my shoon and ran into it, shouting.The bloodless line of his lips turned up slightly.I was happy, he said, sounding a bit surprised.Not scairt at all.I meant to die, after all; there was nothing to fear except that I might be wounded and not die at once.But I would die, and then it would be all over, and I would find ye again, and it would be all right.I moved closer to him, and his hand rose up from the shadows to take mine.Men fell to either side of me, and I could hear the grapeshot and the musket balls hum past my head like bumblebees.But I wasna touched.He had reached the British lines unscathed, one of very few Highlanders to have completed the charge across Culloden Moor.An English gun crew looked up, startled, at the tall Highlander who burst from the smoke like a demon, the blade of his broadsword gleaming with rain and then dull with blood.There was a small part of my mind that asked why I should be killin them, he said reflectively.For surely I knew that we were lost; there was no gain to it.But there is a lust to killingyoull know that?His fingers tightened on mine, questioning, and I squeezed back in affirmation.I couldna stopor I would not.His voice was quiet, without bitterness or recrimination.Its a verra old feeling, I think; the wish to take an enemy with ye to the grave.I could feel it there, a hot red thing in my chest and belly, andI gave myself to it, he ended simply.There were four men tending the cannon, none armed with more than a pistol and knife, none expecting attack at such close quarters.They stood helpless against the berserk strength of his despair, and he killed them all.The ground shook under my feet, he said, and I was near deafened by the noise.I couldna think.And then it came to me that I was behind the English guns.A soft chuckle came from below.A verra poor place to try to be killed, no?So he had started back across the moor, to join the Highland dead.He was sitting against a tussock near the middle of the fieldMurtagh.Hed been struck a dozen times at least, and there was a dreadful wound in his headI knew he was dead.He hadnt been, though; when Jamie had fallen to his knees beside his godfather and taken the small body in his arms, Murtaghs eyes had opened.He saw me.And he smiled.And then the older mans hand had touched his cheek briefly.Dinna be afraid, a bhalaich, Murtagh had said, using the endearment for a small, beloved boy.It doesna hurt a bit to die.I stood quietly for a long time, holding Jamies hand.Then he sighed, and his other hand closed very, very gently about my wounded arm.Too many folk have died, Sassenach, because they knew meor suffered for the knowing.I would give my own body to save ye a moments painand yet I could wish to close my hand just now, that I might hear ye cry out and know for sure that I havena killed you, too.I leaned forward, pressing a kiss on the skin of his chest.He slept naked in the heat.You havent killed me.You didnt kill Murtagh.And well find Ian.Take me back to bed, Jamie.Sometime later, as I drowsed on the edge of sleep, he spoke from the floor beside my bed.Ye know, I seldom wanted to go home to Laoghaire, he said contemplatively.And yet, at least when I did, Id find her where Id left her.I turned my head to the side, where his soft breathing came from the darkened floor.Oh?And is that the kind of wife you want?The sort who stays put?He made a small sound between a chuckle and a cough, but didnt answer, and after a few moments, the sound of his breathing changed to a soft, rhythmic snore.55  ISHMAEL  I slept restlessly, and woke up late and feverish, with a throbbing headache just behind my eyes.I felt ill enough not to protest when Marsali insisted on bathing my forehead, but relaxed gratefully, eyes closed, enjoying the cool touch of the vinegar soaked cloth on my pounding temples.It was so soothing, in fact, that I drifted off to sleep again after she left.I was dreaming uneasily of dark mine shafts and the chalk of charred bones, when I was suddenly roused by a crash that brought me bolt upright and sent a shaft of pure white pain ripping through my head.What?I exclaimed, clutching my head in both hands, as though this might prevent it falling off.What is it?The window had been covered to keep the light from disturbing me, and it took a moment for my stunned vision to adapt to the dimness.On the opposite side of the cabin, a large figure was mimicking me, clutching its own head in apparent agony.Then it spoke, releasing a volley of very bad language, in a mixture of Chinese, French, and Gaelic.Damn!it said, the exclamations tapering off into milder English.Goddamn it to hell!Jamie staggered to the window, still rubbing the head he had smashed on the edge of my cupboard.He shoved aside the covering and pushed the window open, bringing a welcome draft of fresh air in along with a dazzle of light.What in the name of bloody hell do you think youre doing?I demanded, with considerable asperity.The light jabbed my tender eyeballs like needles, and the movement involved in clutching my head had done the stitches in my arm no good at all.I was looking for your medicine box, he replied, wincing as he felt the crown of his head.Damn, Ive caved in my skull.Look at that!He thrust two fingers, slightly smeared with blood, under my nose.I dropped the vinegar soaked cloth over the fingers and collapsed back on my pillow.Why do you need the medicine box, and why didnt you ask me in the first place, instead of bumping around like a bee in a bottle?I said irritably.I didna want to wake ye from your sleep, he said, sheepishly enough that I laughed, despite the various throbbings going on in my anatomy.Thats all right; I wasnt enjoying it, I assured him.Why do you need the box?Is someone hurt?Aye.I am, he said, dabbing gingerly at the top of his head with the cloth and scowling at the result.Ye dinna want to look at my head?The answer to this was Not especially, but I obligingly motioned to him to bend over, presenting the top of his head for inspection.There was a reasonably impressive lump under the thick hair, with a small cut from the edge of the shelf, but the damage seemed a bit short of concussion.Its not fractured, I assured him.You have the thickest skull Ive ever seen.Moved by an instinct as old as motherhood, I leaned forward and kissed the bump gently.He lifted his head, eyes wide with surprise.Thats supposed to make it feel better, I explained.A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.Oh.Well, then.He bent down and gently kissed the bandage on my wounded arm.Better?he inquired, straightening up.Lots.He laughed, and reaching for the decanter, poured out a tot of whisky, which he handed to me.I wanted that stuff ye use to wash out scrapes and such, he explained, pouring another for himself.Hawthorn lotion.I havent got any ready made, because it doesnt keep, I said, pushing myself upright.If its urgent, though, I can brew some; it doesnt take long.The thought of getting up and walking to the galley was daunting, but perhaps Id feel better once I was moving.Not urgent, he assured me.Its only theres a prisoner in the hold whos a bit bashed about.I lowered my cup, blinking at him.A prisoner?Where did we get a prisoner?From the pirate ship.He frowned at his whisky.Though I dinna think hes a pirate.What is he?He tossed off the whisky neatly, in one gulp, and shook his head.Damned if I know.From the scars on his back, likely a runaway slave, but in that case, I canna think why he did what he did.What did he do?Dived off the Bruja into the sea.MacGregor saw him go, and then after the Bruja made sail, he saw the man bobbing about in the waves and threw him a rope.Well, that is funny; why should he do that?I asked.I was becoming interested, and the throbbing in my head seemed to be lessening as I sipped my whisky.Jamie ran his fingers through his hair, and stopped, wincing.I dinna ken, Sassenach, he said, gingerly smoothing the hair on his crown flat.It wouldna be likely for a crew like ours to try to board the pirateany merchant would just fight them off; theres no reason to try to take them.But if he didna mean to escape from usperhaps he meant to escape from them, aye?The last golden drops of the whisky ran down my throat.It was Jareds special blend, the next to last bottle, and thoroughly justified the name he had given itCe Gheasacach.Magic Mist.Feeling somewhat restored, I pushed myself upright.If hes hurt, perhaps I should take a look at him, I suggested, swinging my feet out of the berth.Given Jamies behavior of the day before, I fully expected him to press me flat and call for Marsali to come and sit on my chest.Instead, he looked at me thoughtfully, and nodded.Aye, well.If yere sure ye can stand, Sassenach?I wasnt all that sure, but gave it a try.The room tilted when I stood up, and black and yellow spots danced before my eyes, but I stayed upright, clinging to Jamies arm.After a moment, a small amount of blood reluctantly consented to reenter my head, and the spots went away, showing Jamies face looking anxiously down at me.All right, I said, taking a deep breath.Carry on.The prisoner was below in what the crew called the orlop, a lower deck space full of miscellaneous cargo.There was a small timbered area, walled off at the bow of the ship, that sometimes housed drunk or unruly seamen, and here he had been secured.It was dark and airless down in the bowels of the ship, and I felt myself becoming dizzy again as I made my way slowly along the companionway behind Jamie and the glow of his lantern.When he unlocked the door, at first I saw nothing at all in the makeshift brig.Then, as Jamie stooped to enter with his lantern, the shine of the mans eyes betrayed his presence.Black as the ace of spades was the first thought that popped into my slightly addled mind, as the edges of face and form took shape against the darkness of the timbers.No wonder Jamie had thought him a runaway slave.The man looked African, not island born.Besides the deep red black of his skin, his demeanor wasnt that of a man raised as a slave.He was sitting on a cask, hands bound behind his back and feet tied together, but I saw his head rise and his shoulders straighten as Jamie ducked under the lintel of the tiny space.He was very thin, but very muscular, clad in nothing but a ragged pair of trousers.The lines of his body were clear; he was tensed for attack or defense, but not submission.Jamie saw it, too, and motioned me to stay well back against the wall.He placed the lantern on a cask, and squatted down before the captive, at eye level.Amiki, he said, spreading out his empty hands, palm up.Amiki.Bene bene.Friend.Is good.It was taki taki, the all purpose pidgin polyglot that the traders from Barbados to Trinidad spoke in the ports.The man stared impassively at Jamie for a moment, eyes still as tide pools.Then one eyebrow flicked up and he extended his bound feet before him.Bene bene, amiki?he said, with an ironic intonation that couldnt be missed, whatever the language.Is good, friend?Jamie snorted briefly, amused, and rubbed a finger under his nose.Its a point, he said in English.Does he speak English, or French?I moved a little closer.The captives eyes rested on me for a moment, then passed away, indifferent.If he does, hell no admit it.Picard and Fergus tried talking to him last night.He willna say a word, just stares at them.What he just said is the first hes spoken since he came aboard.Habla Espaol?he said suddenly to the prisoner.There was no response.The man didnt even look at Jamie; just went on staring impassively at the square of open doorway behind me.Er, sprechen sie Deutsche?I said tentatively.He didnt answer, which was just as well, as the question had exhausted my own supply of German.Nicht Hollander, either, I dont suppose.Jamie shot me a sardonic look.I canna tell much about him, Sassenach, but Im fairly sure hes no a Dutchman.They have slaves on Eleuthera, dont they?Thats a Dutch island, I said irritably.Or St.Croixthats Danish, isnt it?Slowly as my mind was working this morning, it hadnt escaped me that the captive was our only clue to the pirates whereaboutsand the only frail link to Ian.Do you know enough taki taki to ask him about Ian?Jamie shook his head, eyes intent on the prisoner.No.Besides what I said to him already, I ken how to say not good, how much?give it to me, and drop that, ye bastard, none of which seems a great deal to the point at present.Stymied for the moment, we stared at the prisoner, who stared impassively back.To hell with it, Jamie said suddenly.He drew the dirk from his belt, went behind the cask, and sawed through the thongs around the prisoners wrists.He cut the ankle bindings as well, then sat back on his heels, the knife laid across his thigh.Friend, he said firmly in taki taki.Is good?The prisoner didnt say anything, but after a moment, he nodded slightly, his expression warily quizzical.Theres a chamber pot in the corner, Jamie said in English, rising and sheathing his dirk.Use it, and then my wife will tend your wounds.A very faint flicker of amusement crossed the mans face.He nodded once more, this time in acceptance of defeat.He rose slowly from the cask and turned, stiff hands fumbling at his trousers.I looked askance at Jamie.Its one of the worst things about being bound that way, he explained matter of factly.Ye canna take a piss by yourself.I see, I said, not wanting to think about how he knew that.That, and the pain in your shoulders, he said.Be careful touching him, Sassenach.The note of warning in his voice was clear, and I nodded.It wasnt the mans shoulders he was concerned about.I still felt light headed, and the stuffiness of the surroundings had made my headache throb again, but I was less battered than the prisoner, who had indeed been bashed about at some stage of the proceedings.Bashed though he was, his injuries seemed largely superficial.A swollen knot rose on the mans forehead, and a deep scrape had left a crusted reddish patch on one shoulder.He was undoubtedly bruised in a number of places, but given the remarkably deep shade of his skin and the darkness of the surroundings, I couldnt tell where.There were deep bands of rawness on ankles and wrists, where he had pulled against the thongs.I hadnt made any of the hawthorn lotion, but I had brought the jar of gentian salve.I eased myself down on the deck next to him, but he took no more notice of me than of the deck beneath his feet, even when I began to spread the cool blue cream on his wounds.What was more interesting than the fresh injuries, though, were the healed ones.At close range, I could see the faint white lines of three parallel slashes, running across the slope of each cheekbone, and a series of three short vertical lines on the high, narrow forehead, just between his brows.Tribal scars.African born for sure, then; such scars were made during manhood rituals, or so Murphy had told me.His flesh was warm and smooth under my fingers, slicked with sweat.I felt warm, too; sweaty and unwell.The deck rose gently beneath me, and I put my hand on his back to keep my balance.The thin, tough lines of healed whipstrokes webbed his shoulders, like the furrows of tiny worms beneath his skin.The feel of them was unexpected; so much like the feel of the marks on Jamies own back.I swallowed, feeling queasy, but went on with my doctoring.The man ignored me completely, even when I touched spots I knew must be painful.His eyes were fixed on Jamie, who was watching the prisoner with equal intentness.The problem was plain.The man was almost certainly a runaway slave.He hadnt wanted to speak to us, for fear that his speech would give away his owners island, and that we would then find out his original owner and return him to captivity.Now we knew that he spokeor at least understoodEnglish, it was bound to increase his wariness.Even if we assured him that it was not our intention either to return him to an owner or to enslave him ourselves, he was unlikely to trust us.I couldnt say that I blamed him, under the circumstances.On the other hand, this man was our bestand possibly the onlychance of finding out what had happened to Ian Murray aboard the Bruja.When at length I had bandaged the mans wrists and ankles, Jamie gave me a hand to rise, then spoke to the prisoner.Youll be hungry, I expect, he said.Come along to the cabin, and well eat.Not waiting for a response, he took my good arm and turned to the door.There was silence behind us as we moved into the corridor, but when I looked back, the slave was there, following a few feet behind.Jamie led us to my cabin, disregarding the curious glances of the sailors we passed, only stopping by Fergus long enough to order food to be sent from the galley.Back to bed with ye, Sassenach, he said firmly, when we reached the cabin.I didnt argue.My arm hurt, my head hurt, and I could feel little waves of heat flickering behind my eyes.It looked as though I would have to break down and use a little of the precious penicillin on myself, after all.There was still a chance that my body could throw off the infection, but I couldnt afford to wait too long.Jamie had poured out a glass of whisky for me, and another for our guest.Still wary, the man accepted it, and took a sip, eyes widening in surprise.I supposed Scotch whisky must be a novelty to him.Jamie took a glass for himself and sat down, motioning the slave to the other seat, across the small table.My name is Fraser, he said.I am captain here.My wife, he added, with a nod toward my berth.The prisoner hesitated, but then set down his glass with an air of decision.They be callin me Ishmael, he said, in a voice like honey poured over coal.I aint no pirate.I be a cook.Murphys going to like that, I remarked, but Jamie ignored me.There was a faint line between the ruddy brows, as he felt his way into the conversation.A ships cook?he asked, taking care to make his voice sound casual.Only the tap of his two stiff fingers against his thigh betrayed himand that, only to me.No, mon, I dont got nothin to do with that ship!Ishmael was vehement.They taken me off the shore, say they kill me, I don go long by them, be easy.I aint no pirate!he repeated, and it dawned on me belatedly that of course he wouldnt wish to be taken for a piratewhether he was one or not.Piracy was punishable by hanging, and he could have no way of knowing that we were as eager as he to stay clear of the Royal Navy.Aye, I see.Jamie hit the right balance, between soothing and skeptical.He leaned back slightly in the big wheel backed chair.And how did the Bruja come to take ye prisoner, then?Not where, he added quickly, as a look of alarm flitted across the prisoners face.Ye needna tell me where ye came from; thats of no concern to me.Only I should care to know how ye came to fall into their hands, and how long yeve been with them.Since, as ye say, ye werena one of them.The hint was broad enough to spread butter on.We didnt mean to return him to his owner; however, if he didnt oblige with information, we might just turn him over to the Crown as a pirate.The prisoners eyes darkened; no fool, he had grasped the point at once.His head twitched briefly sideways, and his eyes narrowed.I be catchin fish by the river, he said.Big ship, he come sailin up the river slow, little boats be pullin him.Men in the little boat, they see me, holler out.I drop the fish, be runnin, but they close by.They men jump out, kotch me by the cane field, figure they take me to sell.Thas all, mon.He shrugged, signaling the conclusion of his story.Aye, I see.Jamies eyes were intent on the prisoner.He hesitated, wanting to ask where the river was, but not quite daring to, for fear the man would clam up again.While ye were on the shipdid ye see any boys among the crew, or as prisoners, too?Boys, young men?The mans eyes widened slightly; he hadnt been expecting that.He paused warily, but then nodded, with a faintly derisive glint in his eye.Yes, mon, they have boys.Why?You be wantin one?His glance flicked to me and then back to Jamie, one eyebrow raised.Jamies head jerked, and a slight flush rose on his cheekbones at the implication.I do, he said levelly.I am looking for a young kinsman who was taken by pirates.I should feel myself greatly obliged to anyone who might assist me in finding him.He lifted one eyebrow significantly.The prisoner grunted slightly, his nostrils flaring.That so?What you be doin for me, I be helpin you fin this boy?I should set you ashore at any port of your choosing, with a fair sum in gold, Jamie replied.But of course I should require proof that ye did have knowledge of my nephews whereabouts, aye?Huh.The prisoner was still wary, but beginning to relax.You tell me, monwhat this boy be like?Jamie hesitated for a moment, studying the prisoner, but then shook his head.No, he said thoughtfully.I dinna think that will work.You describe to me such lads as ye saw on the pirate vessel.The prisoner eyed Jamie for a moment, then broke out in a low, rich laugh.You no particular fool, mon, he said.You know that?I know that, Jamie said dryly.So long as ye know it as well.Tell me, then.Ishmael snorted briefly, but complied, pausing only to refresh himself from the tray of food Fergus had brought.Fergus himself lounged against the door, watching the prisoner through half lidded eyes.They be twelve boys talkin strange, like you.Jamies eyebrows shot up, and he exchanged a glance of astonishment with me.Twelve?Like me?He said.White boys, English?Or Scots, dye mean?Ishmael shook his head in incomprehension; Scot was not in his vocabulary.Talkin like dogs fightin, he explained.Grrrr!Wuff!He growled, shaking his head in illustration like a dog worrying a rat, and I saw Ferguss shoulders shake in suppressed hilarity.Scots for sure, I said, trying not to laugh.Jamie shot me a brief dirty look, then returned his attention to Ishmael.Verra well, then, he said, exaggerating his natural soft burr.Twelve Scottish lads.What did they look like?Ishmael squinted dubiously, chewing a piece of mango from the tray.He wiped the juice from the corner of his mouth and shook his head.I only see them once, mon.Tell you all I see, though.He closed his eyes and frowned, the vertical lines on his forehead drawing close together.Four boys be yellow haired, six brown, two with black hair.Two shorter than me, one maybe the size that griffone therehe nodded toward Fergus, who stiffened in outrage at the insultone big, not so big as you  Aye, and how will they have been dressed?Slowly, carefully, Jamie drew him through the descriptions, asking for details, demanding comparisonshow tall?how fat?what color eyes?carefully concealing the direction of his interest as he drew the man further into conversation.My head had stopped spinning, but the fatigue was still there, weighting my senses.I let my eyes close, obscurely soothed by the deep, murmuring voices.Jamie did sound rather like a big, fierce dog, I thought, with his soft growling burr and the abrupt, clipped sound of his consonants.Wuff, I murmured under my breath, and my belly muscles quivered slightly under my folded hands.Ishmaels voice was just as deep, but smooth and low, rich as hot chocolate made with cream.I began to drift, lulled by the sound of it.He sounded like Joe Abernathy, I thought drowsily, dictating an autopsy reportunvarnished and unappetizing physical details, related in a voice like a deep golden lullaby.I could see Joes hands in memory, dark on the pale skin of an accident victim, moving swiftly as he made his verbal notes to the tape recorder.Deceased is a tall man, approximately six feet in height, and slender in build.A tall man, slender.that one, he bein tall, bein thin  I came awake suddenly, heart pounding, hearing the echo of Joes voice coming from the table a few feet away.No!I said, quite suddenly, and all three men stopped and looked at me in surprise.I pushed back the weight of my damp hair and waved weakly at them.Dont mind me; I was dreaming, I think.They returned to their conversation, and I lay still, eyes half closed, but no longer sleepy.There was no physical resemblance.Joe was stocky and bearlike; this Ishmael slender and lean, though the swell of muscle over the curve of his shoulder suggested considerable strength.Joes face was broad and amiable; this mans narrow and wary eyed, with a high forehead that made his tribal scars the more striking.Joes skin was the color of fresh coffee, Ishmaels the deep red black of a burning ember, which Stern had told me was characteristic of slaves from the Guinea coastnot so highly prized as the blue black Senegalese, but more valuable than the yellow brown Yaga and Congolese.But if I closed my eyes entirely, I could hear Joes voice speaking, even allowing for the faint Caribbean lilt of slave English.I cracked my eyelids and looked carefully, searching for any signs of resemblance.There were none, but I did see what I had seen before, and not noticed, among the other scars and marks on the mans battered torso.What I had thought merely a scrape was in fact a deep abrasion that overlay a wide, flat scar, cut in the form of a rough square just below the point of the shoulder.The mark was raw and pink, newly healed.I should have seen it at once, if not for the darkness of the orlop, and the scrape that obscured it.I lay quite still, trying to remember.No slave name, Joe had said derisively, referring to his sons self christening.Clearly, Ishmael had cut away an owners brand, to prevent identification, should he be recaptured.But whose?And surely the name Ishmael was no more than coincidence.Maybe not so farfetched a one, though; Ishmael almost certainly wasnt the mans real name.They be callin me Ishmael, he had said.That, too, was a slave name, given him by one owner or another.And if young Lenny had been climbing his family tree, as it seemed, what more likely than that he should have chosen one of his ancestors given names in symbol?If.But if he was  I lay looking up at the claustrophobic ceiling of the berth, suppositions spinning through my head.Whether this man had any link with Joe or not, the possibility had reminded me of something.Jamie was catechizing the man about the personnel and structure of the Brujafor so the ship that had attacked us had beenbut I was paying no attention.I sat up, cautiously, so as not to make the dizziness worse, and signaled to Fergus.I need air, I said.Help me up on deck, will you?Jamie glanced at me with a hint of worry, but I smiled reassuringly at him, and took Ferguss arm.Where are the papers for that slave we bought on Barbados?I demanded, as soon as we were out of earshot of the cabin.And wheres the slave, for that matter?Fergus looked at me curiously, but obligingly rummaged in his coat.I have the papers here, milady, he said, handing them to me.As for the slave, I believe he is in the crews quarters.Why?he added, unable to restrain his curiosity.I ignored the question, fumbling through the grubby, repellent bits of paper.There it is, I said, finding the bit I remembered Jamie reading to me.Abernathy!It was Abernathy!Branded on the left shoulder with a fleur de lys.Did you notice that mark, Fergus?He shook his head, looking mildly bewildered.No, milady.Then come with me, I said, turning toward the crews quarters.I want to see how big it is.The mark was about three inches long and three wide; a flower, surmounting the initial A, burned into the skin a few inches below the point of the shoulder.It was the right size, and in the right place, to match the scar on the man Ishmael.It wasnt, however, a fleur de lys; that had been the mistake of a careless transcriber.It was a sixteen petaled rosethe Jacobite emblem of Charles Stuart.I blinked at it in amazement; what patriotic exile had chosen this bizarre method of maintaining allegiance to the vanquished Stuarts?Milady, I think you should return to your bed, Fergus said.He was frowning at me as I stooped over Temeraire, who bore this inspection as stolidly as everything else.You are the color of goose turds, and milord will not like it at all if I allow you to fall down on the deck.I wont fall down, I assured him.And I dont care what color I am.I think weve just had a stroke of luck.Listen, Fergus, I want you to do something for me.Anything, milady, he said, grabbing me by the elbow as a shift in the wind sent me staggering across the suddenly tilting deck.But not, he added firmly, until you are safely back in your bed.I allowed him to lead me back to the cabin, for I really didnt feel at all well, but not before giving him my instructions.As we entered the cabin, Jamie stood up from the table to greet us.There ye are, Sassenach!Are ye all right?he asked, frowning down at me.Yeve gone a nasty color, like a spoilt custard.I am perfectly fine, I said, through my teeth, easing myself down on the bunk to avoid jarring my arm.Have you and Mr.Ishmael finished your conversation?Jamie glanced at the prisoner, and I saw the flat black gaze that locked with his.The atmosphere between them was not hostile, but it was charged in some way.Jamie nodded in dismissal.Weve finishedfor the moment, he said.He turned to Fergus.See our guest below, will ye, Fergus, and see to it that hes fed and clothed?He remained standing until Ishmael had left under Ferguss wing.Then he sat down beside my berth and squinted into the darkness at me.Ye look awful, he said.Had I best fetch your kit and be feeding ye a wee tonic or somesuch?No, I said.Jamie, listenI think I know where our friend Ishmael came from.He lifted one brow.You do?I explained about the scar on Ishmael, and the almost matching brand on the slave Temeraire, without mentioning what had given me the idea in the first place.Five will get you ten that they came from the same placefrom this Mrs.Abernathys, on Jamaica.I said.Five will?Och, he said, waving away my confusing reference in the interests of continuing the discussion.Well, ye could be right, Sassenach, and I hope so.The wily black bastard wouldna say where he was from.Not that I can blame him, he added fairly.God, if Id got away from such a life, theres no power on earth would take me back!He spoke with a surprising vehemence.No, I wouldnt blame him either, I said.But what did he tell you, about the boys?Has he seen Young Ian?The frowning lines of his face relaxed.Aye, Im almost sure he has.One fist curled on his knee in anticipation.Two of the lads he described could be Ian.And knowin it was the Bruja, I canna think otherwise.And if youre right about where hes come from, Sassenach, we might have himwe may find him at last!Ishmael, while refusing to give any clue as to where the Bruja had picked him up, had gone so far as to say that the twelve boysall prisonershad been taken off the ship together, soon after his own capture.Twelve lads, Jamie repeated, his momentary look of excitement fading back into a frown.What in the name of God would someone be wanting, to kidnap twelve lads from Scotland?Perhaps hes a collector, I said, feeling more light headed by the moment.Coins, and gems, and Scottish boys.Ye think whoevers got Ian has the treasure as well?He glanced curiously at me.I dont know, I said, feeling suddenly very tired.I yawned rackingly.We may know for sure about Ishmael, though.I told Fergus to see that Temeraire gets a look at him.If they are from the same place I yawned again, my body seeking the oxygen that loss of blood had deprived me of.Thats verra sensible of ye, Sassenach, Jamie said, sounding faintly surprised that I was capable of sense.For that matter, I was a little surprised myself; my thoughts were becoming more fragmented by the moment, and it was an effort to keep talking logically.Jamie saw it; he patted my hand and stood up.Ye dinna trouble yourself about it now, Sassenach.Rest, and Ill send Marsali down wi some tea.Whisky, I said, and he laughed.All right, then, whisky, he agreed.He smoothed my hair back, and leaning into the berth, kissed my hot forehead.Better?he asked, smiling.Lots.I smiled back and closed my eyes.56  TURTLE SOUP  When I woke again, in the late afternoon, I ached all over.I had thrown off the covers in my sleep, and lay sprawled in my shift, my skin hot and dry in the soft air.My arm ached abominably, and I could feel each of Mr.Willoughbys forty three elegant stitches like red hot safety pins stuck through my flesh.No help for it; I was going to have to use the penicillin.I might be proof against smallpox, typhoid, and the common cold in its eighteenth century incarnation, but I wasnt immortal, and God only knew what insanitary substances the Portuguese had been employing his cutlass on before applying it to me.The short trip across the room to the cupboard where my clothes hung left me sweating and shivering, and I had to sit down quite suddenly, the skirt clutched to my bosom, in order to avoid falling.Sassenach!Are ye all right?Jamie poked his head through the low doorway, looking worried.No, I said.Come here a minute, will you?I need you to do something.Wine?A biscuit?Murphys made a wee broth for ye, special.He was beside me in a moment, the back of his hand cool against my flushed cheek.God, youre burning!Yes, I know, I said.Dont worry, though; I have medicine for it.I fumbled one handed in the pocket of the skirt, and pulled out the case containing the syringes and ampules.My right arm was sore enough that any movement made me clench my teeth.Your turn, I said wryly, shoving the case across the table toward Jamie.Heres your chance for revenge, if you want it.He looked blankly at the case, then at me.What?he said.Ye want me to stab ye with one of these spikes?I wish you wouldnt put it quite that way, but yes, I said.In the bum?His lips twitched.Yes, damn you!He looked at me for a moment, one corner of his mouth curling slightly upward.Then he bowed his head over the case, red hair glowing in the shaft of sun from the window.Tell me what to do, then, he said.I directed him carefully, guiding him through the preparation and filling of the syringe, and then took it myself, checking for air bubbles, clumsily left handed.By the time I had given it back to him and arranged myself on the berth, he had ceased to find anything faintly funny about the situation.Are ye sure ye want me to do it?he said doubtfully.Im no verra good with my hands.That made me laugh, in spite of my throbbing arm.I had seen him do everything with those hands, from delivering foals and building walls, to skinning deer and setting type, all with the same light and dextrous touch.Well, aye, he said, when I said as much.But its no quite the same, is it?The closest thing Ive done to this is to dirk a man in the wame, and it feels a bit strange to think of doin such a thing to you, Sassenach.I glanced back over my shoulder, to find him gnawing dubiously on his lower lip, the brandy soaked pad in one hand, the syringe held gingerly in the other.Look, I said.I did it to you; you know what it feels like.It wasnt that bad, was it?He was beginning to make me rather nervous.Mmphm.Pressing his lips together, he knelt down by the bed and gently wiped a spot on my backside with the cool, wet pad.Is this all right?Thats fine.Press the point in at a bit of an angle, not straight inyou see how the point of the needles cut at an angle?Push it in about a quarter inchdont be afraid to jab a bit, skins tougher than you think to get throughand then push down the plunger very slowly, you dont want to do it too fast.I closed my eyes and waited.After a moment, I opened them and looked back.He was pale, and a faint sheen of sweat glimmered over his cheekbones.Never mind.I heaved myself upright, bracing against the wave of dizziness.Here, give me that.I snatched the pad from his hand and swiped a patch across the top of my thigh.My hand trembled slightly from the fever.But  Shut up!I took the syringe and aimed it as well as I could, left handed, then plunged it into the muscle.It hurt.It hurt more when I pressed down on the plunger, and my thumb slipped off.Then Jamies hands were there, one steadying my leg, the other on the needle, slowly pressing down until the last of the white liquid had vanished from the tube.I took one quick, deep breath when he pulled it out.Thanks, I said, after a moment.Im sorry, he said softly, a minute later.His hand came behind my back, easing me down.Its all right.My eyes were closed, and there were little colored patterns on the inside of my eyelids.They reminded me of the lining of a dolls suitcase I had had as a child; tiny pink and silver stars on a dark background.Id forgotten; its hard to do it the first few times.I suppose sticking a dirk in someone is easier, I added.You arent worried about hurting them, after all.He didnt say anything, but exhaled rather strongly through his nose.I could hear him moving about the room, putting the case of syringes away and hanging up my skirt.The site of the injection felt like a knot under my skin.Im sorry, I said.I didnt mean it that way.Well, ye should, he said evenly.It is easier to kill someone to save your own life than it is to hurt someone to save theirs.Yere a deal braver than I am, and I dinna mind your saying so.I opened my eyes and looked at him.The hell you dont.He stared down at me, blue eyes narrowed.The corner of his mouth turned up.The hell I dont, he agreed.I laughed, but it hurt my arm.Im not, and you arent, and I didnt mean it that way, anyway, I said, and closed my eyes again.Mmphm.I could hear the thump of feet on the deck above, and Mr.Warrens voice, raised in organized impatience.We had passed Great Abaco and Eleuthera in the night, and were now headed south toward Jamaica, with the wind behind us.I wouldnt risk being shot and hacked at, and arrested and hanged, if there were any choice about it, I said.Neither would I, he said dryly.But you I began, and then stopped.I looked at him curiously.You really think that, I said slowly.That you dont have a choice about it.Dont you?He was turned slightly away from me, eyes fixed on the port.The sun shone on the bridge of his long, straight nose and he rubbed a finger slowly up and down it.The broad shoulders rose slightly, and fell.Im a man, Sassenach, he said, very softly.If I thought there was a choicethen I maybe couldna do it.Ye dinna need to be so brave about things if ye ken ye canna help it, aye?He looked at me then, with a faint smile.Like a woman in childbirth, aye?Ye must do it, and it makes no difference if youre afraidyell do it.Its only when ye ken ye can say no that it takes courage.I lay quiet for a bit, watching him.He had closed his eyes and leaned back in the chair, auburn lashes long and absurdly childish against his cheeks.They contrasted strangely with the smudges beneath his eyes and the deeper lines at the corners.He was tired; hed barely slept since the sighting of the pirate vessel.I havent told you about Graham Menzies, have I?I said at last.The blue eyes opened at once.No.Who was he?A patient.At the hospital in Boston.Graham had been in his late sixties when I knew him; a Scottish immigrant who hadnt lost his burr, despite nearly forty years in Boston.He was a fisherman, or had been; when I knew him he owned several lobster boats, and let others do the fishing for him.He was a lot like the Scottish soldiers I had known at Prestonpans and Falkirk; stoic and humorous at once, willing to joke about anything that was too painful to suffer in silence.Youll be careful, now, lassie, was the last thing he said to me as I watched the anesthetist set up the intravenous drip that would maintain him while I amputated his cancerous left leg.Be sure yere takin off the right one, now.Dont worry, I assured him, patting the weathered hand that lay on the sheet.Ill get the right one.Ye will?His eyes widened in simulated horror.I thought twas the left one was bad!He was still chuckling asthmatically as the gas mask came down over his face.The amputation had gone well, and Graham had recovered and gone home, but I was not really surprised to see him back again, six months later.The lab report on the original tumor had been dubious, and the doubts were now substantiated; metastasis to the lymph nodes in the groin.I removed the cancerous nodes.Radiation treatment was applied.Cobalt.I removed the spleen, to which the disease had spread, knowing that the surgery was entirely in vain, but not willing to give up.Its a lot easier not to give up, when it isnt you thats sick, I said, staring up at the timbers overhead.Did he give up, then?Jamie asked.I dont think Id call it that, exactly.I have been thinking, Graham announced.The sound of his voice echoed tinnily through the earpieces of my stethoscope.Have you?I said.Well, dont do it out loud til Ive finished here, thats a good lad.He gave a brief snort of laughter, but lay quietly as I auscultated his chest, moving the disc of the stethoscope swiftly from ribs to sternum.All right, I said at last, slipping the tubes out of my ears and letting them fall over my shoulders.What have you been thinking about?Killing myself.His eyes met mine straight on, with just a hint of challenge.I glanced behind me, to be sure that the nurse had left, then pulled up the blue plastic visitors chair and sat down next to him.Pain getting bad?I asked.There are things we can do, you know.You only need to ask.I hesitated before adding the last; he never had asked.Even when it was obvious that he needed medication, he never mentioned his discomfort.To mention it myself seemed an invasion of his privacy; I saw the small tightening at the corners of his mouth.Ive a daughter, he said.And two grandsons; bonny lads.But Im forgetting; youll have seen them last week, aye?I had.They came at least twice a week to see him, bringing scribbled school papers and autographed baseballs to show their grandpa.And theres my mother, living up to the rest home on Canterbury, he said thoughtfully.It costs dearly, that place, but its clean, and the foods good enough she enjoys complainin about it while she eats.He glanced dispassionately at the flat bedsheet, and lifted his stump.A month, dye think?Four?Three?Maybe three, I said.With luck, I added idiotically.He snorted at me, and jerked his head at the IV drip above him.Tcha!And worse luck I wouldna wish on a beggar.He looked around at all the paraphernalia; the automatic respirator, the blinking cardiac monitor, the litter of medical technology.Nearly a hundred dollars a day its costing, to keep me here, he said.Three months, that would begreat heavens, ten thousand dollars!He shook his head, frowning.A bad bargain, I call that.Not worth it.His pale gray eyes twinkled suddenly up at me.Im Scots, ye know.Born thrifty, and not likely to get over it now.So I did it for him, I said, still staring upward.Or rather, we did it together.He was prescribed morphia for the painthats like laudanum, only much stronger.I drew off half of each ampule and replaced the missing bit with water.It meant he didnt get the relief of a full dose for nearly twenty four hours, but that was the safest way to get a big dose with no risk of being found out.We talked about using one of the botanical medicines I was studying; I knew enough to make up something fatal, but I wasnt sure of it being painless, and he didnt want to risk me being accused, if anyone got suspicious and did a forensic examination.I saw Jamies eyebrow lift, and flapped a hand.It doesnt matter; its a way of finding out how someone died.Ah.Like a coroners court?A bit.Anyway, hed be supposed to have morphia in his blood; that wouldnt prove anything.So thats what we did.I drew a deep breath.There would have been no trouble, if Id given him the injection, and left.Thats what hed asked me to do.Jamie was quiet, eyes fixed intently on me.I couldnt do it, though.I looked at my left hand, seeing not my own smooth flesh, but the big, swollen knuckles of a commercial fisherman, and the fat green veins that crossed his wrist.I got the needle in, I said.I rubbed a finger over the spot on the wrist, where a large vein crosses the distal head of the radius.But I couldnt press down the plunger.In memory, I saw Graham Menziess other hand rise from his side, trailing tubes, and close over my own.He hadnt much strength, then, but enough.I sat there until he was gone, holding his hand.I felt it still, the steady beat of the wrist pulse under my thumb, growing slower, and slower still, as I held his hand, and then waiting for a beat that did not come.I looked up at Jamie, shaking off the memory.And then a nurse came in.It had been one of the younger nursesan excitable girl, with no discretion.She wasnt very experienced, but knew enough to tell a dead man when she saw one.And me just sitting there, doing nothingmost undoctorlike conduct.And the empty morphia syringe, lying on the table beside me.She talked, of course, I said.I expect she would.I had the presence of mind to drop the syringe into the incinerator chute after she left, though.It was her word against mine, and the whole matter was just dismissed.My mouth twisted wryly.Except that the next week, they offered me a job as head of the whole department.Very important.A lovely office on the sixth floor of the hospitalsafely away from the patients, where I couldnt murder anyone else.My finger was still rubbing absently across my wrist.Jamie reached out and stopped it by laying his own hand over mine.When was this, Sassenach?he asked, his voice very gentle.Just before I took Bree and went to Scotland.Thats why I went, in fact; they gave me an extended leavesaid Id been working too hard, and deserved a nice vacation.I didnt try to keep the irony out of my voice.I see.His hand was warm on mine, despite the heat of my fever.If it hadna been for that, for losing your workwould ye have come, Sassenach?Not just to Scotland.To me?I looked up at him and squeezed his hand, taking a deep breath.I dont know, I said.I really dont.If I hadnt come to Scotland, met Roger Wakefield, found out that you I stopped and swallowed, overwhelmed.It was Graham who sent me to Scotland, I said at last, feeling slightly choked.He asked me to go somedayand say hello to Aberdeen for him.I glanced up at Jamie suddenly.I didnt!I never did go to Aberdeen.Dinna trouble yourself, Sassenach.Jamie squeezed my hand.Ill take ye there myselfwhen we go back.Not, he added practically, that theres anything to see there.It was growing stuffy in the cabin.He rose and went to open one of the stern windows.Jamie, I said, watching his back, what do you want?He glanced around, frowning slightly in thought.Ohan orange would be good, he said.Theres some in the desk, aye?Without waiting for a reply, he rolled back the lid of the desk, revealing a small bowl of oranges, bright among the litter of quills and papers.Dye want one, too?All right, I said, smiling.That wasnt really what I meant, though.I meantwhat do you want to do, once weve found Ian?Oh.He sat down by the berth, an orange in his hands, and stared at it for a moment.Dye know, he said at last, I dinna think anyone has ever asked me thatwhat it was I wanted to do.He sounded mildly surprised.Not as though you very often had a choice about it, is it?I said dryly.Now you do, though.Aye, thats true.He rolled the orange between his palms, head bent over the dimpled sphere.I suppose its come to ye that we likely canna go back to Scotlandat least for a time?he said.I had told him of Tompkinss revelations about Sir Percival and his machinations, of course, but we had had little time to discuss the matteror its implications.It has, I said.Thats why I asked.I was quiet then, letting him come to terms with it.He had lived as an outlaw for a good many years, hiding first physically, and then by means of secrecy and aliases, eluding the law by slipping from one identity to another.But now all these were known; there was no way for him to resume any of his former activitiesor even to appear in public in Scotland.His final refuge had always been Lallybroch.But even that avenue of retreat was lost to him now.Lallybroch would always be his home, but it was no longer his; there was a new laird now.I knew he would not begrudge the fact that Jennys family possessed the estatebut he must, if he were human, regret the loss of his heritage.I could hear his faint snort, and thought he had probably reached the same point in his thinking that I had in mine.Not Jamaica or the English owned islands, either, he observed ruefully.Tom Leonard and the Royal Navy may think us both dead for the moment, but theyll be quick enough to notice otherwise if we stay for any length of time.Have you thought of America?I asked this delicately.The Colonies, I mean.He rubbed his nose doubtfully.Well, no.I hadna really thought of it.Its true wed likely be safe from the Crown there, but He trailed off, frowning.He picked up his dirk and scored the orange, quickly and neatly, then began to peel it.No one would be hunting you there, I pointed out.Sir Percival hasnt got any interest in you, unless youre in Scotland, where arresting you would do him some good.The British Navy cant very well follow you ashore, and the West Indian governors havent anything to say about what goes on in the Colonies, either.Thats true, he said slowly.But the Colonies He took the peeled orange in one hand, and began to toss it lightly, a few inches in the air.Its verra primitive, Sassenach, he said.A wilderness, aye?I shouldna like to take ye into danger.That made me laugh, and he glanced sharply at me, then, catching my thought, relaxed into a half rueful smile.Aye, well, I suppose draggin ye off to sea and letting ye be kidnapped and locked up in a plague ship is dangerous enough.But at least I havena let ye be eaten by cannibals, yet.I wanted to laugh again, but there was a bitter note to his voice that made me bite my lip instead.There arent any cannibals in America, I said.There are!he said heatedly.I printed a book for a society of Catholic missionaries, that told all about the heathen Iroquois in the north.They tie up their captives and chop bits off of them, and then rip out their hearts and eat them before their eyes!Eat the hearts first and then the eyes, do they?I said, laughing in spite of myself.All right, I said, seeing his scowl, Im sorry.But for one thing, you cant believe everything you read, and for another  I didnt get to finish.He leaned forward and grasped my good arm, tight enough to make me squeak with surprise.Damn you, listen to me!he said.Its no light matter!Wellno, I suppose not, I said, tentatively.I didnt mean to make fun of youbut, Jamie, I did live in Boston for nearly twenty years.Youve never set foot in America!Thats true, he said evenly.And dye think the place ye lived in is anything like what its like now, Sassenach?Well I began, then paused.While I had seen any number of historic buildings near Boston Common, sporting little brass plaques attesting to their antiquity, the majority of them had been built later than 1770; many a lot later.And beyond a few buildings  Well, no, I admitted.Its not; I know its not.But I dont think its a complete wilderness.There are cities and towns now; I know that much.He let go of my arm and sat back.He still held the orange in his other hand.I suppose thats so, he said slowly.Ye dinna hear so much of the townsonly that its such a wild savage place, though verra beautiful.But Im no a fool, Sassenach.His voice sharpened slightly, and he dug his thumb savagely into the orange, splitting it in half.I dinna believe something only because someones set words down in a bookfor Gods sake, I print the damn things!I ken verra well just what charlatans and fools some writers areI see them!And surely I ken the difference between a romance and a fact set down in cold blood!All right, I said.Though Im not sure its all that easy to tell the difference between romance and fact in print.But even if its dead true about the Iroquois, the whole continent isnt swarming with bloodthirsty savages.I do know that much.Its a very big place, you know, I added, gently.Mmphm, he said, plainly unconvinced.Still, he bent his attention to the orange, and began to divide it into segments.This is very funny, I said ruefully.When I made up my mind to come back, I read everything I could find about England and Scotland and France about this time, so Id know as much as I could about what to expect.And here we end up in a place I know nothing about, because it never dawned on me wed cross the ocean, with you being so seasick.That made him laugh, a little grudgingly.Aye, well, ye never ken what ye can do til ye have to.Believe me, Sassenach, once Ive got Ian safely back, I shall never set foot on a filthy, godforsaken floating plank in my life againexcept to go home to Scotland, when its safe, he added, as an afterthought.He offered me an orange segment and I took it, token of a peace offering.Speaking of Scotland, you still have your printing press there, safe in Edinburgh, I said.We could have it sent over, maybeif we settled in one of the larger American cities.He looked up at that, startled.Dye think it would be possible to earn a living, printing?There are that many people?It takes a fair sized city, ye ken, to need a printer or bookseller.Im sure you could.Boston, Philadelphianot New York yet, I dont think.Williamsburg, maybe?I dont know which ones, but there are several places big enough to need printingthe shipping ports, certainly.I remembered the flapping posters, advertising dates of embarkation and arrival, sales of goods and recruitment of seamen, that decorated the walls of every seaside tavern in Le Havre.Mmphm.This one was a thoughtful noise.Aye, well, if we might do that  He poked a piece of fruit into his mouth and ate it slowly.What about you?he said abruptly.I glanced at him, startled.What about me?His eyes were fixed intently on me, reading my face.Would it suit ye to go to such a place?He looked down then, carefully separating the other half of the fruit.I meanyouve your work to do as well, aye?He looked up and smiled, wryly.I learned in Paris that I couldna stop ye doing it.And ye said yourself, ye might not have come, had Menziess death not stopped you, where ye were.Can ye be a healer in the Colonies, dye think?I expect I can, I said slowly.There are people sick and injured, almost anywhere you go, after all.I looked at him, curious.Youre a very odd man, Jamie Fraser.He laughed at that, and swallowed the rest of his orange.Oh, I am, aye?And what dye mean by that?Frank loved me, I said slowly.But there werepieces of me, that he didnt know what to do with.Things about me that he didnt understand, or maybe that frightened him.
