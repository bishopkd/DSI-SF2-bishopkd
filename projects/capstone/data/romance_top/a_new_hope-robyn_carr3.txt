My hours were terrible before we got married and I thought we were happy.She was the one who wanted to be married so bad it made her teeth ache.Why the hell would she marry me?I was the worst person for her to marry.And now she wants to have coffee.Or drinks.She wants us to be friends, to get over it, even try again...He shook his head.Aw, God, dont tell Peyton that, please.I dont want to talk about that with my family.Im not going to say anything to anyone about this conversation.But can I say one thing?Its good to have someone like you to talk to.He reached for her hand.We have some things in common.But Ginger, once weve gone over the details of all this crap in our rearview mirrors, were going to talk about other things.She squeezed his hand across the table.Like what?Like, can you still make little houses?Do you read anything I might like?Is there time in your life for adventure?Would you have a dog?Or a cat?Or a bird?Are you sensitive to insect bites?She laughed at his questions and the twinkle in her eyes was back that fast.Do you have a dog?We have working dogs, a bunch of em.I dont even know how many.Theyre mostly with Georgethey mind the sheep.Theres a golden and a black Lab around the orchardthey hunt and keep predators away from the chickens.There are no animals in the house.Well, I want a dog in the house, she said.On the bed, in fact.And on the sofa!I want a good old happy dog who looks at me with sad loving eyes no matter how late I get home...And dog hair in the soup.And dog hair in the soup, she agreed, laughing.He lifted his beer.Youre all right, Ginger, he said before taking a drink.The conversation blessedly turned from bad marriages and other catastrophes to family humorwhat her brothers did to her miniature people and houses, what his sisters did to him.Peyton and Ginny were older and tried to dress up the little boys like dolls and make them play roles as their babies.He had her laughing hysterically at the tales of ten people and one bathroom.She told of the fun game her older brothers had of tossing her back and forth, until someone missed and she broke an arm.Matt told of numerous fractures on the farm, all from doing things they were forbidden to do, like swing on the rope in the barn from the loft to the ground.They had each driven their own vehicles to the restaurant so that when Ginger went home Matt could just head north to his apartment.He walked her to her car and stood with her right outside the drivers door.He put his forehead against her forehead.For the first time in a long time, Im a little bit happy.Because youre my friend, he said.Me, too.Will you do something for me?Sure, Ginger.What do you need?When you get home tonight will you give me a call?Just so I know you made it without problems.I promise not to keep you on the phone.Sure, he said.He looked at his watch.Ill be waking you up in about four hours.When he called her, it was already after eleven.And then they talked for two hours.* * * Thank God for Ginger, Grace thought for the millionth time.She was in charge of the flower shop while Grace was at the new house preparing a nice dinner for her mother and Mikhail.And sadly, she was hoping that Winnie would prove to be too fatigued to be argumentative, demanding or feisty, because there were things she had to be told right away.Oh, how she hoped her mother liked the house.Theyd all worked so hard.Troy had gone to the airport to fetch them.Winnie and Mikhail had come by private jet.She was standing in the kitchen when she heard the garage door slide up, the hum of the Jeep as Troy pulled in and she went to the kitchen door.She saw Troy get out and go around to the passenger side.He lifted Winnie into his strong arms and carried her into the house.Were here, he announced to Grace.Let the party begin!And Winnie, God bless her, blushed and slapped at him.Stop it, Troy!My partying days are long over.Grace kissed her cheek while Troy still held her very capably.Im so glad youre here.How do you feel?Oh, you know.Just always so tired.And then she looked around the great room and kitchen.Very nice, Grace, she said.And Grace felt every tight muscle in her body relax.She was surprised she didnt sink to the floor in sheer relief.Troy put Winnie on her feet then helped her to the chair near the open French doors, facing the ocean, and Grace pushed the ottoman over, lifting her feet up.Winnie shrugged out of her wrap while Grace sat on the ottoman and pulled off her mothers shoes.She held Winnies feet in her lap and gently massaged them.You used to do this for me when I had a long day of skating, Grace said.Seems so long ago now, Winnie said.Youll want to see the rest of the house but well take it a little bit at a time.Its actually a large house, but everything you need is on this floor.Ive cooked us a little dinner...Im not very hungry, darling, she said.I have a little soup if youre tired and dont want much to eat.But I hope you have enough energy to hear some news.Its going to be a little exciting around here soonand well try to keep it manageable with regard to your health.Were going to get married, Mama.We want to get married anyway but were going to put a little rush on it because Im pregnant.She covered her belly with one hand.Due around Christmas.Winnie looked up and over her shoulder at Troy.You do realize shes never been in a relationship before, dont you?Troys eyes shone.He gave a nod.Shes very good at it, he said.And she obviously knows nothing about birth control, Winnie added.Or I dont, Troy suggested.Im just going to let all that go, Grace said.It wont be flashy, Mama.I think well get married on the beach, right in front of the house, as soon as possible.School is out soon.While youre still up and about and can enjoy it if you squeeze in a good nap.Troys family will come but I think theyll stay in town, maybe at his apartment and my loft above the store.I promise to keep your stress low.My dress, Winnie said.Youll want my dress!Grace shook her head.Its not necessary.Ill find something much simpler.My dress is simple.We can take off the train and pitch the head gear.I hated that head gear anyway.My mother insisted on that.You need something more your style.But the dress is one of a kind.I wouldnt want to get sand and sea all over it...Winnie laughed, and her face looked bright.Why not?Did you think I was going to use it again?Now, if its the matter that you dont really like it...of course well alter it.I dont care what you do to it, but if it can work for you in any incarnation, its yours.Before you decide, look at it.Ill have it sent.She looked around.This is a nice little house, Grace, she said.We have the downstairs, Grace said.Its large enough for me, Troy and a baby.And the top floortwo bedrooms and a small bathperfect for Mikhail.Excellent, he said.I might stay day or two.Maybe we should get the luggage inside and then toast the new house, Troy suggested.Excellent, Mikhail said.Troy, darling, Winnie said.Before you do all that, is there a chair on that deck out there that could accommodate me?If its warm enough, of course.Could you take me out there first?Of course, he said.Gracie, can you pull the cover off that chaise?Absolutely, she said.Then she added, Troy, darling.Troy scooped Winnie up in his arms and carried her to the deck, gently placing her on the chaise.My daughter was definitely thinking of me when she let herself love you, Winnie said.I think Ill be very happy while youre around.Troy winked at Grace.Flirt!Grace mouthed back.And my phone, Winnie demanded.Who has my phone?Mikhail took it out of his pocket and handed it to her.Virginia still works for me, doesnt she?Because I have things for her to do.You know she still works for you, Mama.The luggage was brought in, unpacking was accomplished, drinks and tapas were served.The sun was beginning to set, making the beach and the deck bright.Troy put out the awning to provide a little shade.Winnie tried the soup Grace had on hand but though she claimed it was delicious, her trembling made it a messy dish.Grace made her a new platevery small portions of roasted chicken, scalloped potatoes, steamed asparagusjust a few bites of each.The others loaded up their plates and enjoyed chocolate cheesecake from Carries deli.Troy, Grace and Mikhail carried their plates to the table outside while Winnie balanced a tray on her lap and enjoyed the sound of the waves and the sinking of the sun.Troy showed her the corner where an outdoor hearth would be built and described the activity on the beach in the summer and fall.He explained all the neighbors and his job three doors down at Coopers beach bar.Ive asked Virginia to send my dress, Winnie said.You can do anything you want to itits yours.Rip it up or store it away and forget about it, I dont care.And I asked Virginia to make arrangements to reserve that condo in Bandon for your family.Its the least I can doIve contributed nothing to my only daughters wedding.Shall I send a jet for them?Oh, Jesus, no!Troy said in a panic.Then more calmly he took Winnies hand in both of his and said, Winnie, best not to flash too much around here.People wont know how to act.My family in particularthey arent used to a lot of material wealth.It might make them nervous.It might make them not themselves.Is the condo all right?she asked, suddenly concerned.Its not necessary, he said.Thank you.But we have room for them in town.My parents and brother will be fine in Graces loft and my sister and her family will be very comfortable in my apartment.Theyll be close to the beach and this house.But I promise I wont let them overrun you or tire you out.Im such a burden, Winnie said.I hate being a burden!Youre no trouble at all, Winnie.I dont want you to worry.Its a real pleasure having you here.Were living in your house, after all.Winnie turned her eyes to Grace.She smiled.I think you did all right for yourself here, Grace.This boy is just what we need.It was still early when Winnie was settled in bed.Since there was no staff or nursing help, she had her cell phone handy and could call Graces cell phone if she needed water, or to get up to use the facilities, anything that required assistance.Winnie thanked Troy a hundred times.And Mikhail retired to a room that boasted a very fine flat screen with a satellite connection and access to all sorts of entertainment.The house fell quiet before nine and Grace crawled into bed, content that shed done a good job.She placed her cell phone beside the bed so she could hear if her mother called.Then her fianc crawled in beside her.Naked.Winnie thinks youre a nice boy, Grace said, laughter in her voice.He pulled her close.Thats good.Let her think that.That will make life easier on you than if she knows the truth.That youre just a dirty bad boy?Excellent, he said, affecting a Russian accent.We toast that!* * * Matts curiosity was piqued.Hed never heard the name Mick Cantrell, but that didnt mean anything.He wasnt into music to that degree.Now, if you asked him the name of the head of the Arizona State University Research Farm, he had that.Or even the name of the PhD in Australia studying and publishing on biological farming.And of course he probably knew every Oregon botany PhD publishing in the state.And he was up to speed on environmental policy, growing sustainable food in the US and many other subjects.He was not up to date on rock stars.He researched Mick Cantrell and found a website and many hits on Google.It appeared he was a minor star.He had a lot of pictures posted on his website and Facebook page, a few showing him on stage with a huge audience, but on his events schedule there werent too many listings.His bio made him sound like Bruce Springsteenhe played to thousands, had several CDs, wrote songs for major stars...Matt had heard of the stars but not the songs.But what had Ginger said?He did sell some songs but they never made the charts.It appeared his gigs were mostly around the Pacific Northwest and he happened to be playing in a Portland nightclub in a week.On a Saturday night.What are you up to this weekend?Matt asked Ginger during one of their phone conversations.Im going to be busy with the shop, she said.Graces mother has arrived, theres a fever in the air as they try to pull together a wedding in just over a week.Troys family will descend on the town and everyone will be busy.Im going to do as much as I can to free Grace.I bet shes so grateful you stumbled into her life, Matt said.That makes two of us.I love her flower shop.What will you do this weekend?Me?he asked.Oh.Theres stuff to do.Im needed on the farm.A New Hope        Six Ginger had to string together a series of lies in order to have the weekend she planned, a weekend that could bring disastrous results.But she had to do it, had to.There were things she had to know.She was driving to Portland where she would stay one night with her parents.She planned to have an early dinner with them on Saturday night then, she told them, she was going to meet a couple of girlfriends she hadnt seen in a very long time.She said she probably wouldnt be late.She cringed to see how happy her parents were to hear this!She looked better, said she felt better and now she was putting her life back together with old friends.Her mothers eyes got teary and her chin quivered.Ginger wasnt meeting girlfriends.The idea actually appealed and she made a mental note to pursue that in the not too distant future.Shed get in touch with those few friends who had nothing to do with Mick or with the baby.She might have to reach all the way back to high school or maybe even junior high, but it was a worthy notion.But on Saturday night she dressed to go to Roys Theater.It was part club, part dance hall, part theater.For big acts they could open the whole place up and seat more than a thousand.For popular dance bands, they could accommodate a couple hundred and a large dance floor.And for entertainers somewhere in between, especially those with a strong local grassroots following like tonights act, it could be as many as three hundred in their nightclub.Mick was performing.Roys had always been one of his favorite venues.He was bringing a backup band and singers.Ginger knew that was not a traveling band.It was made up of friends he jammed with and hed give them a couple hundred bucks each.That meant his set list would be deep, including songs he was known for twenty years ago.And of course his own songs, which were only appreciated by his die hard fans.His most popular performances were the classic artistsJames Taylor, Eric Clapton, Gordon Lightfoot, Bruce Springsteen, Harry Nilsson.He even had a Josh Groban piece with a guitar accompaniment that she had heard on the radio from time to time.It was actually cleverly done.She had seen him twice since the divorce.Once when the baby was born, once after the baby died, but not for the funeral.Mick had had a gig on the day of the funeral.When he showed up a few weeks after the funeral there was nearly a brawl when her brothers, outraged by the fact that hed played the dead baby card at his last several concerts, threatened to beat him to death.A long time, then.She couldnt remember the last time shed seen him that things were good between them.Sometime before she was pregnant.She probably shouldve worn baggy jeans and a paint splattered shirt.She didnt.She wore the purple dress with gold piping.You look so beautiful, her mother said.I should get Ray Anne to take me shopping, shes that good.I really love this dress, Ginger said.Do I hope to make him notice me?she asked herself.Because it was unlikely he would even know she was there.Shed find a secluded place away from the house lights.She was in no way reaching out to him.She just had to know one thingafter all theyd endured, did she still feel anything at all for him?There was a line to get into the theater.It wasnt long, but there were some people who wanted to get there early for Mick so they could have seats close to the stage.She even recognized some of them; shed seen them over the years.They werent exactly friends, though some had shown up at her house when there was partying or jamming going on.Shed see them at various concerts.It had been a long time and thankfully no one spoke to her.It was possible she wasnt recognizable.Also possible shed only blended into the background of his celebrity, no more important than part of his crew, a mostly volunteer crew.She caught a whiff of marijuana.Several people held beers and since the club wasnt open yet, they were obviously brought from home.Once inside there were lots of options and she knew each one.There was theater seating in front of the stage for those dedicated enthusiasts.Then there were booths and tables for general music aficionados.And at the back of the room, a couple of long bars, for those live music fans who had nothing better to do on this Saturday night.She found a small table for two at the far left end of one of the bars.It was a dark little table and when someone asked if she needed that extra chair, she gave it up happily.She ordered a glass of white wine and one ice water.Then she blew out the candle on her table.The waitress relit it and when she was gone, Ginger blew it out again.It seemed to be a very long time before that rush ran through the crowd, the anticipation of his appearance when the house lights went down.Her wine was half gone.She couldnt even summon a memory of the way it had felt years ago when shed drive for hours to be one of many, heart fluttering in excitement because he was going to sing!Then afterward theyd party with some of the superfans.Hed like to smoke a little pot, and after a long, long night hed take her to bed and make love to her.She never failed to feel like shed gone to heaven in his arms.Where was it?The rush?The thrill?She expected to at least feel some nostalgia.Instead she felt only embarrassment, but she wasnt sure for what.For being caught up in his charisma?Hell, she was hardly the only onehe had quite a following of young women.Sadly for Mick, he didnt have quite enough charisma to make him famous.He finally strode onto the darkened stage to the roaring applause of his audience, especially those down front.One lone spotlight shone on him.He carried his guitar and sat on an ordinary wooden stool, his microphone wired to him.He looked good in his signature jeans, ordinary T shirt, suede vest.He wore cowboy boots but no hathe wasnt a country singer, though he had some great country numbers and his biggest sale of original songs had actually been to a country artist.But he was too vain to cover up that silky, thick, honey colored hair.He wore it just a little long, but he always said he wasnt the hippy dippy typeno ponytail.Hed chosen blue eyes from the optometrist.Startling blue eyes that were, without the contacts, ordinary hazel.He was damn fine looking, she could admit with complete objectivity.He began to sing one of his old selections, a Harry Nilsson award winner with a lot of fancy guitar work.It was a whole two seconds before the crowd recognized it and burst into applause.In his casual way, he didnt even look up; he concentrated on the music.Or at least appeared to.There was a time when her love for him was so overwhelming it felt like a great balloon had been expanded in her chest and left her aching when it was ripped out.Then there was the profound sadness of not having enough of him; it hurt so much.That was followed by the crushing pain of being rejected, retreating to the safety of her mothers house to give birth alone.Then briefly, the euphoria of holding a part of him in her arms.She had accepted that she couldnt have him in her life, but shed found a certain peace.He had been the love of her life, shed never get over him or find another but she didnt have any more sacrifice in her.She had to find a way to move on.With her son.Then, not long after little Josh died, the hurt and anger rose up in her.Not so much at Mick but at herself because look at what her romantic delusion had cost her!Years of her life gone trying to find ways to finally deserve his love and devotion.And then a baby ripped from her life and no father to grieve him.She shook her head.What a profound waste.She sat in the darkened club, hands folded in her lap, and listened to his sweet, melancholy voice, heard the women cry out in adulation and, no doubt, powerful desire.And she just shook her head.Poor fools, she thought.Hes not real, cant you see that?Hell never give anyone anything.Hell suck the life out of anyone who dares love him.And she felt nothing.* * * Matt purposely stayed in the back of the crowd entering Roys.Of course hed been there beforehed grown up in the area, and this was a popular hangout; Natalie had loved it.He only wanted a glimpse of this Mick, this mediocre guy who could screw up so many lives and then just trot into the sunset strumming his guitar.Who was this dude?The Rhinestone Cowboy?So it was his plan to stand in the back, maybe just inside the door.He might have a drink, listen to two or three songs, take a look at how much people appreciated his modest talent, then get the hell out of there.If only life could cooperate with him for once.He stood at the end of the bar, ordered a Cutty on ice and before the house lights dimmed, he saw Natalie with two of her girlfriends at one of the tables near the front.So it might be only one drink.At least she was far away.And then, because he supposed he deserved to be punished for something, there was Lucy in the theater seating down front.There were so many females down there he wasnt sure if she was with anyone.Well, they were both so far away and the house lights went down, so he was safe.But he wasnt going to stay long.It was too risky.But then he saw Ginger.She sat at a table alone, her hands primly folded in her lap, watching Mick walk onto the stage.She was wearing that dress, that sexy dress.He frowned considering thishow a dress with a high, mandarin collar could be so damn sexy.Her sleek and soft blond hair moved gracefully as she shook her head while watching Mick.Just a little thigh and knee were visible, her calf shapely in her ordinary heels.There she sat with a half glass of wine, pretty much covered up, not dolled up in spike heels with ankle straps, no boobage on display, and he just wanted to grab her into his arms on the spot.Really, she wasnt as beautiful as Natalie on the surface.Why she seemed ten times more so completely confused him.Matt?He turned to find Lucy standing in front of him.Well, he said uncomfortably.Hey.You a fan?she asked.Me?Hell, no.I mean, I just wanted a drink and I thought Id see if there was any talent here.You?Youre a fan of this guy?I like him, yeah.She shook her auburn curls.Not huge, but my girlfriend is really into him.Well, Im not staying so you should get back to your girlfriend...Then he winced.He could be such a rude bastard.You could stay long enough to buy me a drink, she said.See, this was the problem, he found himself thinking.Lucy should tell him to just go fuck himself instead of calling him, asking him to buy her a drink.He wasnt worth her time.She shouldnt waste her time on a guy who wasnt treating her right.What would you like, Lucy?Just a chardonnay, she said, and smiled.He waved to the bartender.He ordered and fished out his wallet.He put a hand on her upper arm and gave her a soft stroke.Listen, Lucy, I want you to be careful tonight, okay?Dont drink too much, dont take chances around here.Lot of hungry wolves here tonight and I cant hang around to look out for you.Thats so sweet, she said.No, its not Well, at least youre not sitting on the farm, drowning your sorrows, a familiar voice said.Right beside him stood Natalie.She must have grown attached to the ebony hair, short and spiky.Now, here was boobageNatalies top was cut down almost to her navel, outlining her small breasts perfectly.Since hed been married to her, he now knew the tricksa little fashion glue would keep the silky fabric from sliding or gaping and exposing her.The outline of her nipples was intentional, as was the slit up the thigh.Her eyes were huge and lashes thickthanks to the augmenting of a few extra lashes and the artwork of liner and shadow.The shoes were attention gettingfour inches, ankle straps, pointy toes.Hell on her feet, though.Isnt this an interesting reunion.Lucy, this is my ex wife, Natalie.Nat, meet Lucy, a friend of mine.In fact, I met Lucy in a place a lot like this, didnt I, Luce?Rosewood Ballroom, she supplied with a smile.He could see by the expression on Natalies face, the narrowing of her eyes, that information speared her in the heart.He was always too tired to party when married to her, but after the divorce hed been to clubs and dance halls?And here hed been trying to stay away from Natalie.Even though little Lucy couldnt hold a candle to his ex in the looks department, it felt good to have her know he wasnt lonely.Or bored.Can I get you something, Nat?he asked, playing off her momentary jealousy.Cosmo, she said, her voice crisp.He hailed the bartender again, fished out money again.He wasnt going to hang around waiting for a bill.It was a friendly parting, I take it?Lucy asked.Actually, it was acrimonious, Natalie said frostily.But, as you can see, were working through that, Matt said, passing the drink.And what do you do, Lucy?Natalie asked.Dental assistant.I work for a local periodontist.And you?Im a model, Natalie said, stretching to her full five eleven in four inch heels.Then she stared daggers at Matt, daring him to point out that shed had only about a dozen jobs for catalogs and ad brochures.There had been nothing with national exposure.The uncomfortable chitchat and buying of drinks lasted through two songs and then the lights went up and Mick Cantrell started working the crowd, coming down from the stage while the lights revealed his backup musicians.He shook some hands, kissed a few cheeks, asked people where they were from.He wore his guitar on his back and microphone hooked around one ear and hovering over his lips.He was so happy to see them all.Who came the farthest?he asked.Ah, there was a pretty young woman whod come all the way from Chicago!Well, there was a big surprise for me tonight.The most beautiful woman Ive ever known is here and I have a gift for her, he said.A little something from Dr.Hook...The band began to play behind him, a spotlight suddenly shone on Ginger, and she actually jumped in surprise.It looked like she was going to make a run for it but seemed to think it through and settle into her chair, polite as always.And he began to sing Sharing the Night Together.Matt thought he saw her wince.But, with hands still folded in her lap, she looked up at Mick and let him sing.She blessed Mick with a small smile.Matt could hear the sighs of women in the audience while Mick crooned that hed like to be holding her, hed like to take somewhere, hed like to share the night together.It was the longest three minutes of Matts life, watching that.That was so beautiful, Lucy said.They must know each other.Mick ended his song by whispering to her and giving her a sweet little kiss on the cheek to the applause of many.Then he turned away from her, heading back to the stage and launching into When You Really Love a Woman.The minute the audience was again focused on the stage, and the light and the attention was off Ginger, she stood and left her table.She was getting out of there.She was going to walk right past him.Though her head was down and she was concentrating on an open exit path, she lifted her gaze briefly and saw him.She stopped short, her eyes wide with not just surprise but chagrin at being caught in a lie.Her cheeks colored under those adorable freckles and she continued at a brisk pace.Well, ladies, youll have to excuse me.I wasnt planning to stay and Im outta here.Enjoy the concert, he said.Wait!Natalie said.We have to talk, you and me.Alone!He turned to her.No, he said.And without further explanation, he turned his back and strode out.It took a moment to spot Ginger.She was moving quickly and was already down the street.Hey!Ginger!Oh, she knew it was him because she never even turned.She strode on, head down.Ginger!he tried again.Nothing.Crap, he muttered and broke into a quick jog, catching up with her in another block.Hey!he said, reaching for her elbow.She turned around, her eyes cloudy, her mouth fixed in a line.Come on, he said.Im not going to let you run away from me like that!Whats the matter?Nothing.Nothing.I She took a breath.Im sorry I didnt tell you Id be in Portland.Thats okay, Ginger.You dont have to tell me all your personal business.But that was humiliating, she said.Catching me looking at my useless ex husband like that.Secretly.He chuckled.First of all, hes not completely useless.He does a pretty good job of stirring up the girls.They dont know it wont get them anywhere.And secondthose girls I was standing between?One was my ex and the other was a young woman I briefly dated and dont want to date anymore.She was speechless for a moment.Seriously?she finally asked.Seriously.For about thirty seconds I was wondering why I couldnt just die.I had absolutely no idea they would be there.Im pretty good at identification and avoidance of trouble.I dont want to be around either one of them.Then what were you doing there?Same as you, I bet.I wanted to catch a glimpse of that character.Mick.I wanted to see what he had.Is that what you were doing there?I dont know.I cant explain it very well.He smiled at her.She was the best sight hed seen in more than a week.Just her presence took all the stale, dark air of the club out of his nostrils.Theres an all night diner a few blocks from hereon Washington.Its called Spoonin or something.Noonans, she corrected with a laugh.Thats it.Good coffee, mediocre pie.Want a cup?With a friend?Yes, she said.Yes, I do.Can I ask a favor?Sure.Can you try to not ask me to explain why in the world Id want a look at my ex husband?Because Im not sure I can do an adequate job of it.Ginger, our talking has been easy.I dont make you talk about things youre not ready to talk about and you dont push me to uncomfortable limits, either.Thats why its working between us.Come on, Ill walk you to your car.* * * Seeing him was a rush, thats all there was to it, Ginger thought.Even though when she first spied him she felt caught in a snare.Oh, God, caught sneaking around to see her ex!She had no intention of being busy at the flower shop; she had planned that trip to see Mick perform at one of their old haunts.But Matt was there.Why did he care to see Mick?He left her at her car.She didnt know where hed left his truck but when she parked beside the diner, he pulled in beside her.This is such a great rescue, she told him.Not something Im known for, he admitted.Im glad to be of service.It was a provocative nighthe sang to you.He held open the door for her.He sang you a love song.They settled into a boothold red vinyl benches, scarred laminate tabletop, jukebox.The waitress was there in an instant and they ordered coffee and pie.He sang a love song to you, Matt said again.Women were fainting all over the place, each one wanting to be you.Its what he does for a living, she said.It probably did more for his image to sing a love song to me than to anyone else.Everyone reacted just as you did.Wow, he sang that woman a love song.And by the way, its not much of a living.I havent figured out that part, Matt admitted.I looked him up on the internet and he sounds like a major star...There are pictures of him singing on a big stage to what looks like millions...Hes opened for a few big bands, she said.Fifteen minutes to a sellout crowd before the big guys take over for a two hour concert.Hes got good PR and it costs a fortune.Well, he didnt turn me on, but he was breaking hearts all over the room.I dont know if hes goodI dont know that much about music.Sounded okay to me.I mean, I hate him, but I think it sounded good.Why do you hate him?she asked.He didnt treat you right, Matt said.He shook his head.He must be a little crazy.Or very stupid.Or I am.She put cream and sugar in her coffee.The women surprised you, huh?The exes?Oh, yeah.They shouldnt have.First of all, I met Lucy in a place just like that.I had gone there looking for women.Or, to be more specific, a woman.And Natalie wanted to go to places like Roys.All.The.Time.Every night of the week, if possible.Them being there was far more predictable than me being there.And yet, you wanted a look at Mick?I did.I wanted to see what kind of fool would give you up.What kind of lamebrain would walk away from his wife, his child?It makes no sense to someone like me.In our family if a guy did that, he might be shunned.But you did, she said.At first he looked at her in shock.Natalie didnt want kids.At least not for quite a while, he said quietly.He stared into his coffee cup for a long moment.Ginger, you wont understand this.I cant explain this without telling you some things I swore I would never talk about.All I can sayI had to.There were lies and betrayals I just couldnt get over.I admit, thats on me.Being married means being able to forgive and I couldnt.She wants another chance.I wouldnt dare.She sat back.Then it wasnt just a simple matter of marrying the wrong person.Is it ever simple?Does seeing her hurt?she asked.The pie arrived.The check was slapped down on the table as if the waitress could tell they were engrossed in a serious conversation.It didnt.No.How about you?Did seeing him hurt?She smiled at him.Thats what I came for.To gauge the pain.I invested a lot in that man.Years and years.Promises and patience and vows and sacrifice and I wanted to know if I still longed for him with every piece of my heart.I looked at him and felt nothing.Well, thats not really true.I felt a little shameI was a complete fool.I should have known betterhe never lied about who he was.He said something to you, Matt said.He kissed your cheek at the end of the song and said something.Uh huh.He said, Wonderful to see you.You look beautiful.Thank you for coming.And then he turned and began to sing to a woman two tables away.She laughed and shook her head.He thought I came for him.Of course.And you went for you.She nodded and cut off a forkful of pie.On its way to her lips she paused.Have you ever had your heart broken so badly you thought you might die?That you wanted to die?He nodded solemnly.Every time Mick couldnt really be mine, when he finally said it just wasnt his scene, my heart hurt so bad I wondered how it hadnt killed me.How does it beat through that?The whole time I mothered my little son I was so grateful to have him, but my heart still ached for the man I had believed in.I decided it would take willpower to let go, but I was getting over himso slowly, but I was getting over him.Then the baby died.She paused for just a second because she couldnt miss the fact that Matts black eyes glittered, like they might be getting wet.He just didnt wake up in the morning, she went on.Softly, simply, sweetly, like he had just moved on.No cries, no struggles, no gasping.Just a gentle sleep.Then I knew pain.And grief.All I could think of while I was going through thatnot winning Mick was nothing!I couldnt even remember what it was I thought I loved.Well, thats been a while now.Its going to be a year this summer since Josh passed away.I thought it was time to see Mick, but I didnt want to talk to him.I didnt want him to see me.I didnt want to hear how hes got a great deal he expects to sign in a month or less.I wanted to see him so I could know once and for all if Im finally past that insanity that is Mick Cantrell.Thats why I went.I just want to be free.And are you free?Pretty much, she said, smiling.She sipped her coffee.He can still manage to annoy me, the arrogant bastard.But for the most part, I rarely even think about him.Matt smiled.He took a bite of his pie, and they sat in silence for a moment, enjoying coffee, pie and the company.There are new lambs and chicks at the farm, he finally said.She gasped, and her face lit up.She smiled brightly.Maybe on your way back to Thunder Point you could drop by.Yes, she said.If it wouldnt be too much trouble for you and your family.A New Hope        Seven Matt sat with Ginger for two hours, two pieces of pie and far too much coffee.They passed through the emotional and sentimental stuff and got back to their comfort zonelaughing and teasing.Thanks to caffeine, he couldnt sleep.He didnt nod off until the time he usually woke up.He slept until eight in the morning and in a panic, called her cell.He couldnt have her beat him to the farm.Dont worry, she said.I slept a little late myself.Im having breakfast with my mom and dad, then Ill be headed your way.I wont be there before ten.Are you sure you remember where the farm is?Im sure, she said, laughing.Dont rush me now.Ill be coming when Im done visiting with my parents.She was the bravest woman hed ever met.Strong to the bone, thats what Ginger was.She was the epitome of womanhood in his mindafter all shed been through, after all shed had to overcome, she could still be so sweet, so funny, so positive.Her scars were not thistles, they were velvet artwork on her heart.In the whole of his extended family he could only remember the loss of one child, one of his distant cousins, an infant who had been born with serious birth defects and had lived only a year.Every woman in the family rushed to the young parents.They came from as far away as San Francisco and Reno with food and prayer beads.The Jews and sitting Shiva had nothing on these Basque women.But as far as he could recall, it was only that one time.And it was fated.The poor child had not been expected to live; a year had been a miracle.Ginger faced her demons head on.She even talked about it.Honestly.Matt hadnt been able to do that yet.He was a master of evasion.I cant explain, but I had to, hed said.How flimsy.Ginger would wonder what kind of problem would cause a man who professed to put marriage and family first to turn and walk away.But she hadnt even questioned him.He sat on the front porch steps, waiting for her.Just like a kid waiting for the Easter Bunny.She finally pulled up in her well used gray Audi.She stepped out and gave him a little wave.He took a deep breath and smiled; she was just about the prettiest thing hed ever seen.She wore a lacy sundress that fell below the knee.On her feet were knee high boots and she wore a blue denim jacket.Her blond hair lifted in the breeze.It curled a little today, like maybe she hadnt straightened it out with the blow dryer or something.He wanted to grab her up in his arms and smother her with kisses.Hi, she said.Youre a little impatient, arent you?I didnt want you waiting for me.That would be bad manners.Want to see the chicks first?Shouldnt I say hello to your mother?Theyre not back from morning mass yet, but the house is already full of good smells.He looked her up and down.Why dont I go get the Rhino?The what?Its like a mini Jeepgets us around the farm.Youre too pretty to tromp through a farm.These are my most comfortable, toughest boots.Im prepared to tromp.Not like Natalie, is she?he thought.Shed show up in her fancy heels and he could tell his mother was biting her tongue against asking what she used for a brain.It was a farm, not a runway.And the dress?Not new.Very durable.Come on, lets go.He kept his hands in his pockets because he really wanted to hold her for a minute.Oh, hell, he wanted to make out for an hour or three.Hed wanted to kiss her last night, even though her ex husband sang her a love song, even though she talked about her misfortunes and how she struggled to get beyond it all.But he had put her in her car to leave without taking any chances.They walked to the coop where a few broody hens were keeping a lot of chicks warm, but the chicks were a couple of weeks old and were peeping and climbing all over the hens and each other.There must be two dozen!she said.Adoption, he said.Sometimes my mother will just let them hatch, sometimes shell take delivery of some new chicks and if she has a broody hen, slide them under the hen at night when shes docile and most of the time the hen will take over.A good broody hen can sit on ten eggs or chicks.Sometimes she incubates a couple dozen and either tries an adoption or keeps them in the brooderits a penuntil theyre bigger and can fend for themselves.Id take one out for you to hold but broody hens are a little temperamental and you dont want me pecked.Thus, the term henpecked, she said.Its no laughing matter.Once theyre big, its pretty communal.You have to remember, these hens are here to work and these chicks are being raised to lay eggs, then theyre dinner.Youre just trying to shock me, she accused.I do understand where the chicken breasts I buy come from.After she sighed and fussed over their cuteness, he told her they should go see the lambs.George has the lambs.Its almost a mile.Should I get the Rhino?Not for me, she said.Lead the way.Unless youre in a hurry?I have all day, Ginger.But some women dont enjoy plodding through a pasture or orchard.I dont have all day, she said with a laugh.I have a four hour drive ahead.But theres no rush.Then she drew in a deep breath.Does it seem like the air is fresher here, on the farm?There are still some blossoms and other flowers, he said.Theres also fertilizer and droppings, so watch your step in your comfortable boots.He walked beside her, shortening his stride so she wouldnt have to jog to keep up.She brought up the prior evening and how awkward it was that they were all there alone and yet ended up being a group of exes.You couldnt plan something like that.Are you anxious to get back to Thunder Point?he asked.To my friends and the shop and Ray Anne, yes, always.It turned out to be such a good move for me.And believe me, I was against it from the start.I just wanted to be left alone.But you did it, he said.Impulsively, he reached for her hand, holding it.You picked yourself up and made yourself do it.I think maybe youre the strongest person I know.No, she said with a laugh, shaking her head.Not me.Yes, you.Look at yourself.You somehow pulled yourself together and tried.Im so impressed by you.You should have seen me the day I arrived in Thunder Point.Ray Anne was appalled.For one thing, it took me far longer to get there than it should have and Ray Anne was ready to call the state troopers to ask if there had been any accidents.I told her I stopped to look at the ocean, which was true.What I didnt tell her was that I had contemplated just throwing myself off a cliff.He scowled.Youre intentionally scaring me.She ignored him.I had lost a lot of weight since the baby died and was swimming in my clothes.I was pale because I hadnt been eating, hadnt left the house in months.My hair was...I cant even describe it.Neglected is probably the kindest word.I could have made a public service commercial for severe depression.Yet, look at you a few weeks later.He gave her hand a squeeze.Ray Anne couldnt stand looking at me!She took me, kicking and screaming, for a makeover.She warned me that it might not help the mess on the inside but we had to spare the public what I was showing on the outside.She had a point.Even I find it easier to look in the mirror.And how about that cliff thing?he asked.Im not suicidal, she said.The only thing I really want, suicide wouldnt get me.I want for it never to have happened.Im afraid thats not possible.He stopped walking and faced her.He took her other hand.I want to tell you something.I cant even explain the dark place I was in a few months ago.I didnt go through nearly what you did but I was in a black, foul temper I couldnt shake.I did a lot of stupid self destructive things and didnt just hurt myselfI hurt other people, too.And then I met you and things began to change.Just knowing you, talking to you, looking forward to the next time wed talk or get togetherit pulled me out of the hell I was living in.Ginger, I dont want to heap any more trouble on you, but if I didnt have you right now, my family would still be calling me Mad Matt.I rely on you.You lift me up.And the best part is, I dont think you really even mean to.Its just your nature.Youre the kindest person I know.Matt, she said.Oh, thats so nice of you to say.Im not being nice, Ginger.We connected.Maybe it was out of shared troubles but maybe thats not all it is.Maybe when were done surviving this, maybe we go on to find new reasons to connect.She laughed softly and blushed a little, looking at her feet.Then she lifted her eyes to his.Theres something I should tell you.There was another reason I went to Roys last night.It was true, I wanted to see him and know that I didnt want him anymore, didnt grieve him.It was also something else.I started to have warm feelings for another man.A dear man who is not dark or angry or mad.I had to be sure that one look at Mick wouldnt throw me back into that spiral I was once caught up in.I wanted to be sure what I was feeling was real.A half smile played on his lips.Was it?I believe so, yes, she said.They stood on the dirt road between the orchard and the pasture that led to Georges barn.Maybe halfway there.Has it changed things for you like it changed things for me?he asked.Yes.Remember we joked about trying again when were maybe fifty?Uh huh.Im down to forty nine and a half.He just smiled.Then he leaned toward her and pressed his cheek against her cheek.He let go of one of her hands and slid his around her waist to the small of her back, just enough to hold her while he felt the softness of her cheek and the tickle of her hair.He hummed softly, content.They stood like that for a long moment.Then he slowly pulled back and while looking into her beautiful eyes, touched her lips with his.He felt her lean into him a little and watched as her eyes slowly closed.He didnt push his luck.He pulled back.Was that okay?he asked.She nodded.Lovely.How do you feel about us now?Maybe forty nine.He laughed loudly.Not even forty eight and a half?We didnt even get a whole year?I obviously have work to do with you.Be careful you dont drive it in the other direction.He laughed and led her down the road toward the lambs.Matt had never had to be careful before.Hed had almost legendary success with the girls, then the women.This one wasnt going to fall into his lap.He didnt want her to, he realized.He wanted to work for her.Earn her.Deserve her.Be good for her.Youre going to love the lambs, he said.* * * It was such a perfect June day to gambol about the farm, Ginger thought.And that was really what they were doing, she and Matt, hand in hand, walking at a leisurely pace, visiting the new lambs and the not so new lambs.The babies were in the lambing pens inside, though they were big enough to be outside in such perfect weather.There were just a few late lambs; most had been born at least a month earlier.The weather wasnt the only thing that was perfect.Ginger had begun thinking that while there were people in her life she trusted and could talk to, for some reason this new friendship with Matt was deeper and more trusting than anything she had known.She assumed it was because they were recovering from similar heartaches.But they only visited those subjects a little bit, then moved on to other thingshis family, his education, her family and how everyone but her seemed consumed in the family business.How long have you known this was what you wanted to dofarm?I think I was born knowing, he said.I never wanted anything else.I only write, research and teach occasionally to stay well rounded.Its important to stay involved in the community.We go to a lot of town meetingsthings like zoning, environmental issues, property tax, lots of things to stay on top of.I grew up knowing these things.I envy that, she said.Im the only person in the family who hasnt found any study or industry that would be fulfilling for a lifetime.Ive had jobs, and while none of them were going to make me rich or successful, I was satisfied.Did your parents ever push you?There was the occasional comment asking if I didnt think about college.I took a few classes.I was interested in literature but not English or composition.I liked some history but most of it put me to sleep.Ive never been any good at geography.And math?Forget it.Science?he asked.Yes, anatomy.Basic biology was okay but I spent four weeks in chemistry before I just panicked and dropped it.He laughed.Because it was hard?Hard and intimidating!I wonder how youd feel about botany...Now that Ive visited a real working farm and work with flowers, I might find it interesting...They looked at George and Loris house, but just from the outside.Ginger remarked on the small garden on one side.Thats George.His wife isnt too interested in that sort of thing.George says she wont plant or cultivate but shes good at picking for dinner.She, like Peyton, is more inclined toward medical pursuits.Lori is a physical therapist and has worked since they got married.Peyton, I have no doubt, will continue to work with Scott even after they have more children.She loves her work.Where is everyone?she asked.I expected a lot of action around here.By now I think theyre all at the big house.Its not the biggest houseGeorges is actually bigger, but it will always be the big house because my parents are there and its built for an army.Only seven rooms, but theyre huge rooms.On Sundays when the farm is quiet, no planting, breeding, lambing or harvest, the family just maintains.There are daily chores but its the only day of the week theres actual rest.They take care of the animals, then go to mass, then have an early dinner.Its the only day of the week the family eats before six.I left a note for my mother that you might join us, but its up to you.There could be a lot of them.Really?Georges family, I have two sisters nearby, Ginny and Ellie, but they divide their time between my parents and their husbands families.You know the food will be great but I dont want to overwhelm you.If youre sure I wouldnt be imposing...Im sure it would be a challenge to get you away from them.My mother especially.She lives to feed people, especially people who are at her table for the first time.That would be so lovely.Does your family have traditions like that?Sunday dinner together?My married brothers have split all the holidays with their wives families, but we have some.Then theres the occasional gatheringa backyard barbecue, a Sunday brunch and numerous company parties, often at one of my brothers homes.Richard has a boat and RVthere are family trips to the lake now and then.Its nothing like your family.I was at the reception, remember.Thats not a typical family dinner.But when were harvesting, thats when everyone turns outwe need the help.They work like mules, men, women and kids.Then they eat like vultures.
