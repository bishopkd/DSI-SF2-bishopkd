Seeing his grandparents quietly 						lingering with a large group of men and women, he tightened his jaw and 						averted his gaze, hurrying past to avoid them.Tis all he seemed to be 						doing these days.Avoiding people.He veered toward the farthest 						corner and paused, finding Lord Seton and Lord Danford leaning against the 						paneled candlelit wall, occupying his usual space.Though everyone in London 						usually steered clear of the two men, given that they were twins notorious 						for placing monstrous bets on anything and almost always emptied the 						pockets of every man in a breath, Roderick rather liked Danford and Seton.They were good men who always donated whatever they won to local charities.They were two of the few gambling men in London who actually made the church 						proud.As Roderick approached, he noted 						that their dark heads were still bent toward each other, their foreheads 						creased in what appeared to be a most serious discussion.Though the two 						brothers were impossible to distinguish by eye, they assisted the public by 						wearing different colored gloves.Rodericks brows came together 						as he veered in.Danford?Seton?Is everything all right?You two look a 						bit frazzled.Both men paused from their 						conversation and glanced at him.Danford pushed away from the 						wall, his coal black eyes taking on that devious sparkle they were known 						for.Frazzled?More like dazzled.Always good to see you, Yardley.Even if it isnt 						all that often anymore, given this damned romance youre having with the 						university.What is this business with you being a professor, anyway?Youre 						making the rest of us look stupid and lazy, as always.Roderick bit back a laugh.I 						just needed something to occupy my time.It keeps me out of trouble.And distracts me from thinking about 						Georgia.Danford paused and waved 						Roderick over with the wag of his black gloved fingers.Speaking of 						trouble  Roderick drew closer.What?Seton, who was closest to 						Roderick, yanked him closer, almost spilling the champagne out onto his 						white gloves.Not what, my friend.But who.Seton leaned toward him, his 						shaven face bearing new mischief.Have you had a chance to meet Miss Tormey 						yet?By God, I did.Saw her over on Rotten Row a few days ago.I had to 						bloody send that woman flowers.She gave me thisthislook that Im still trying to recover 						from.Hmm.Hmm.Hmm.There was that name again.No.I havent met her yet.Who is she?A low, long whistle escaped 						Danfords teeth.That about says it all.Roderick eyed them both.That was 						only a whistle, and not a very good one at that.Seton lowered his voice, leaning 						toward him.Allow me to put this into words, Yardley.If this heavenly 						creature were surrounded by fire spiked walls, I would climb said walls more 						than once to be with her.Roderick smirked and hit the 						mans arm with the back of his gloved hand.More than once?Sounds like 						matrimony to me, you poor bastard.Have you formally introduced 						yourself?Seton glared at him.Mother 						would have a fit.Mine, too, Danford added.Given that we have the same mother.Ha.Roderick eyed him.How old are 						you two bastards, anyway?Halfway to thirty?Since when do you need your 						mothers approval to marry?Set off to Gretna Green.Men do it all the 						time.Speaking of Gretna Greenthere 						she is now.Danford and Seton angled themselves in unison to get a better 						look, resembling identical hounds pointing out the same hare to its 						master.Seton reached out to Roderick, 						gesturing toward his champagne.Hand it up.Its not like youre drinking 						it.Roderick rolled his eyes and 						shoved the glass into his hand.Dont choke.I only ever swallow.Seford 						smirked and held up the glass in a half toast.To Miss Tormey and Gretna 						Green.It would break Mothers heart.He tossed the rest of the champagne 						down his throat and went back to staring.The more I look, the more I 						want.Roderick glanced over to the 						woman in question, but couldnt see past the small group of men lingering 						around her and her chaperone.Adjusting his black evening coat, Roderick 						looked back toward Seton and Danford.Whilst you two can afford to gawk, I 						have a class to teach in the morning.I should probably retire.He pointed 						at each of them.Stay out of trouble.Its hard, I know, but we have to do 						the best we can.Seton grabbed his shoulder with 						a white gloved hand, blocking him with his own body to keep him from going 						anywhere.We should all go over and put ourselves on her dance card.Come 						with me.Im not doing this alone.Roderick shoved Setons heavy 						hand from his shoulder, growing annoyed.Unlike you two, I actually earn my 						wages and havent the time for women or dance cards.Roderick tried to 						round him.Seton jumped back in front of 						him and leaned in, poking his chest.Fifty pounds says the moment you lay 						eyes on her, class will teach itself.Im telling you, Yardley, this woman 						will lift more than your brows.Fifty pounds says she is the most 						attractive woman youve ever seen.Fifty.Are you in?Easier money hed never made.No 						woman could ever be more attractive than Georgia.Fifty, it is.Where the 						hell is she?Ill point out every last flaw down to the nose.Seton grabbed his shoulders and 						jerked him toward the direction he needed to look, better squaring him 						toward where she stood.There.She just came into view again.I dare you to find 						any fault with that.Roderick blinked.A regal looking beauty with 						thick, pinned strawberry curls that had been piled to softly frame her oval 						face made him suck in an astonished breath.By God.The woman reminded him 						ofGeorgia.He hissed out a breath knowing 						there wasnt an hour that passed when Georgia and her haunting words of 						finding him in London didnt come to mind.Hed been waiting for her ever 						since.Edging back, he paused and 						skimmed the womans length, which had just come into full view, trying to 						make sense of what he was seeing.Despite what appeared to be a most 						striking resemblance, it couldnt be based on that figure alone.This redhead was quite elegant, 						draped in a chartreuse off the shoulder full evening gown, trimmed with 						snowy lace that rounded an incredibly low cut neckline boasting a set of 						impressive breasts.Large teardrop diamonds hung from her ears and throat, 						gleaming and shimmering against the vast candlelight.As that curvaceous redhead 						daintily wrote several names onto her poised dance card with the pencil 						hanging from her gloved wrist, she glanced up and scanned the room.Her 						intent gaze rounded its way before settling on him.She paused.Stunning bright green eyes he 						knew all too well captured his gaze.Rodericks breath hitched as an inner 						shiver of awareness rippled throughout the entire length of his 					body.Georgia.A taunting whisper of a smile 						touched her full lips at seeing him openly stare.It was as if she were 						silently announcing, You are damned for the rest 						of your days, Robinson.Start crawling.His throat tightened.His palms 						actually grew moist beneath the tightness of his white evening gloves 						knowing it was Georgia.His conniving son of a bitch of a father.That was 						why the man had insisted on his presence tonight and wouldnt desist until 						he came.He knew Georgia was coming.Casually breaking their gaze, 						she gracefully set her chin as any other lady of the ton would do and 						returned her attention to the group of men gathered around her.A gentleman leaned in toward the 						elderly woman who lingered beside Georgia.Who the hell was 					that?The elderly woman swept a gloved 						hand toward Georgia, who graciously inclined her head, briefly offering her 						hand to the gentleman before bringing up the dance card dangling from her 						gloved wrist.Four other gentlemen lingered, all patiently waiting to add 						themselves to her card, as well.Roderick almost staggered.This 						couldnt be happening.He was not actually watching men of his circle gather around 						his woman 						from Orange Street.Leaning in, Seton eyed him.And?Still staring at Georgia, lest 						she disappear from sight, Roderick blindly reached out and seized Seton by 						the back of his neck, crushing it beneath rigid fingers.Yanking Seton 						close, he pointed to Georgia.What do you know about her?he rasped, 						trying to remain calm.And what are people actually saying about her?Seton shifted toward him.After 						I glimpsed her over on Rotten Row riding with Lady Burton, I started digging 						around to find out more about her and it was well worth the dig.That there 						is Miss Georgiana Colette Tormey.She is the distant cousin of Mr.Astor, 						the richest self made American millionaire who deals in furs across the 						world.Miss Tormey came for the opening of the Season just last week with 						Mrs.Astor acting as her chaperone.Mr.Astor insisted Miss Tormey have her 						Season here in London as opposed to New York.Do you know that conniving 						American bastard is hoping to have her married to one of our own?Boasting 						that nothing would best crown her wealth of thirty bloody thousand a year?Can you imagine running your fingers through all that money and that woman?Apoplexy 						take us all.Georgiana?From New York 						City?Roderick dropped his hand 						heavily from the mans neck.Shit.So this was what shed been up to all 						this time when shed disappeared from his life without so much as an 						explanation, leaving him to fester in his own anguish and damn 					mind.Roderick lowered his chin 						against his silk cravat, still staring her down.By God.She looked nothing 						like herself.If not for those emerald eyes he knew so well, he never would 						have recognized her.Hell, even her breasts had undergone a transformation, 						overfilling her embroidered bodice in the most tantalizing way.Georgia primly turned toward a 						newly arrived set of gentlemen seeking introductions.She graciously 						extended an elegant gloved hand to each and smiled.He had never thought her 						capable of accomplishing this.Or rather, he hadnt let himself hope.Edging 						closer, he purposefully angled himself to better see her past those gathered 						around her.He intently watched her as she 						glanced and spoke in every direction but his.He swiped at his mouth, still 						in disbelief, and almost dug his teeth into his hand to keep himself from 						dashing for her and making an idiot out of himself.Whilst he was beyond 						flabbergasted and more than impressed, a part of him didnt know if he liked 						what he was seeing, because it simply wasnt her.It was an elegant and 						refined, overly gussied up version of Georgia Emily Milton.Where was that 						fire he loved so much?Was it still in there somewhere?He paused and glanced over at 						Seton and Danford, who were leaning toward each other.Ive never been with a redhead 						before, Seton casually intoned, lowering his voice.Do you think she has 						freckles everywhere?Roderick narrowed his gaze and 						snapped his fingers at them.Seton.Danford.They both glanced toward 						him.I have an announcement to 						make.Roderick pointed at each of their heads in warning and said in a tone 						that he hoped dripped with enough blood to make his point, If either of you 						so much as look at her again, let alone make any more inappropriate and 						vulgar comments about her, I will take my fathers ceremonial sword that 						hangs on the wall in the next room and gut you both with the same tip, 						impaling you together onto the doors of St.Paul.Because that there woman, 						who calls herself Miss Tormey, is going to be my wife by the end of this Season.So be sure to inform every last bastard in London of my intentions, lest 						they all die right along with you.Are we plain?Seton blinked.Danford gargled out a laugh and 						popped out a hand.Fifty pounds.Ill let poor Seton recover from his 						loss.Danford glanced over at Seton, adding, A hundred says she will move 						on to a better offer within the week, given that his interest will mobilize other men 						to do the same.Tis fair game for you now, Seton.Fair game.All you have 						to do is tell Mother that the Duke of Wentworths own son is making a run 						for it.You know the way she coos over the duke.Your success is 						assured.Roderick shifted his jaw, dug 						into the inner pocket of his coat and yanked out whatever folded banknotes 						he had, not even bothering to count them.He slapped them all into Danfords 						hand.I will not only see your bet, Danford, but Ill raise it to 						ten thousand pounds.Ten thousand?Seton and Danford echoed in unison, shifting toward 						him.Thats right, boys.Ten thousand.Roderick smoothed his cravat against his throat.Now if you will excuse 						me, I intend to formally introduce myself to Miss Tormey.Im not getting 						any younger.Do not alarm yourself: I am not a 						thief, unless that title be attached to those who take from 					thieves.The 						Arabian Nights Entertainments (as 						published in 1792) MRS.ASTOR PURSED HER THIN lips and glanced toward Georgias dance card.To 						be considered a success, Miss Tormey, every last dance must be spoken for.Especially the waltz.That is as much true in the States as it is here.Why 						must you insist on keeping it unaccounted for?Georgia tried to remain 						indifferent, even though she felt unbearably hot and unnerved in the stuffy 						heat of the room.Everyones breaths seemed to 						press against one another and all of the walls.Even worse, the gown draping 						her body weighed more than six pails of water.The inquisitive gaze of every 						man and woman in the room scraped across her skin and soul.Some of those 						glances were laced with genuine admiration.Some with indifference.Some 						were laced with a mocking haughtiness insinuating she wasnt worthy of 						breathing.Indeed, they were not only looking at her, but coming to their 						own conclusions as to what they thought of her.They were 						vulturesevery last one of themand they were circling and circling, waiting for 						signs of weakness.Though her limbs felt heavy, she 						managed to offer Mrs.Astor a genteel reply, focusing on her diction.I do 						beg forgiveness, Mrs.Astor, but I wish to save the waltz for a gentleman 						worthy of it.She glanced toward where shed last seen Robinson, only to 						find that he had long disappeared.Surely, he had recognized her.She was 						sure of it given the way he had stared and stared.Mrs.Astor shook her head, her 						gray and white coif swaying against the movement.I promised Mr.Astor you 						would be a success, and success isnt found by tossing opportunities.I will 						assign your waltz to the next worthy prospect who approaches.Drat it all.Here she was, 						putting on a show in the name of love that would make Shakespeare stand up 						to applaud, and in the end, she was going to have to give it all away to the 						next flat, hair parted fop who dared call himself a man.Mrs.Astor?a husky male voice casually inquired from behind 						her.Might I formally seek an introduction from the lady standing beside 						you?Georgias heart skittered, her 						eyes widening.By all that was blue.It was Robinson.She bit back a gushing 						smile.He couldnt stay away.Though she wanted to promptly 						turn and acknowledge him in her full glory, she decided to make him work for 						it as she had warned him she would, and remained indifferent even as a long 						drop of sweat trickled down the length of her back beneath her chemise and 						corset.She didnt even look at him.Mrs.Astor glided toward Yardley 						with a more than enthusiastic smile.Tis an honor, indeed, my lord.She 						swept a lace gloved hand to Georgia.This is Miss Georgiana Colette Tormey.She is the distinguished distant cousin to my dear, dear husband, Mr.Astor, 						who regrets having to stay abroad due to business.Miss Tormey?Mrs.Astor 						gestured toward Yardley.This is the Marquess of Yardley, the son of our 						host, His Grace, the Duke of Wentworth.Georgia casually turned to 						Robinson and regally outstretched her gloved hand toward him.Although it 						was difficult, she tried to appear bored.My lord.Those seductive gray eyes 						intently clung to her face with a sensual determination to seize her every 						last breath.He grasped her hand, the warmth of his large gloved hand 						tightening with an urgency that pinched.He lifted her gloved hand to his 						lips and fiercely kissed her knuckles, covertly and quickly nipping her 						glove and the skin with his bottom teeth.He met her gaze again and grinned, 						saying in a most provocative and suggestive tone, I am without 						breath.You flatter me, she drawled, 						withdrawing her hand.His grin faded as his gaze 						dropped to her throat and then her breasts before returning to her face.Is 						the waltz available, Miss Tormey?The heat of the room and having 						him so close overwhelmed her and frayed the last of her vision.Until that 						moment, she never realized a man really could make a woman swoon.RODERICK JUMPED FORWARD and grabbed 						hold of Georgia as she limply spilled toward him.His heart pounded as he 						frantically adjusted his hold on her arm and waist, trying to keep her from 						cascading to the floor.Was it the heat?It had to be, given that he himself 						was sweltering.He gathered her into his arms in 						one smooth motion.Mrs.Astor gasped as others 						paused to stare.Unfolding the fan dangling from her wrist, she hurried 						toward him and frantically waved her fan over Georgias flushed face.Tis 						dreadfully hot in here.I dont blame her.She needs cooler air.Rodericks fingers dug into Georgias limp softness, a pulsing knot 						overtaking his ability to breathe.He whipped toward the entrance hall, 						stalking as fast as he could through the crowd.Though the music and dancing 						continued, the rumbling of voices and whispers around him lifted to a 						crescendo that pierced his ability to think or breathe.He glanced down 						frantically at Georgia as he hurried across the floor, her face still tucked 						and buried against his heaving chest.He tightened his arms around her 						and moved faster and faster, weaving through others.Several men, including Seton, 						who had made a sprint from the back, hurried toward him.Is there anything we can do, my 						lord?someone insisted.Roderick rounded them.Hunt 						down my father.Two of the men darted off, 						disappearing into the crowd.Seton anxiously trotted 						alongside him, trying to keep up and glancing repeatedly toward Georgia.He 						quickly leaned in and tried forcefully wrenching Georgia out of his arms.Allow me to carry her for you.Gritting his teeth, Roderick 						shoved Seton back with the weight of his shoulder.I will see to her 						myself, he growled out, shoving his way past all of them.Despite the crowd pressing in on 						them to catch a glimpse of Georgia, Roderick barreled onward, shouldering 						his way through and forcing men to hop foot out of his path.Heading into the cool stillness 						of the vast corridor, he bounded up the length of the sweeping marble 						stairs, tightening his hold on Georgia, and hurried toward the guest 						chamber.A tap tap tap on his shoulder made him 						jerk to a halt and glance down.Georgias weary but 						sharp looking green eyes searched his face.Sorry about that.His throat tightened as he 						trained his eyes before him and resumed his pace.You are done for the 						night.And needless to say, I am not at all pleased with the way you 						disappeared.Regardless of your reasons.Angling Georgia sideways, 						Roderick hurried into the bedchamber and closed the door behind them.He 						strode over to the four poster bed and draped her across the feathered 						mattress, ensuring her legs were pulled straight and that her skirts covered 						her.Leaning over her, he quickly arranged all of the pillows behind her 						head, tucking her into them, and drew up the linens to cover her.We might as well settle this 						here and now.Georgia grabbed his coat by the lapels and yanked him down 						toward herself with surprising force.He gasped as his body fell into hers, 						crushing her softness beneath his tense muscles.He tried to shift away, but she 						fiercely held on to him, weighing him down toward her.Georgia  I have infiltrated your circle, 						Lord Yardley, she tossed up at him.Now the real fun is set to begin.She 						primly settled herself back against the pillows, nestling herself against 						them, and arranged her skirts with a more than smug smile.What do you 						think of Miss Tormey?Impressive, isnt she?You should see this woman trot 						a horse.Every man was craning his neck on Rotten Row.Every man.Some even 						whistled.Though Ill never tell you who.He heaved out a breath, not 						knowing how he was to even begin apologizing, given all he put her through.Im sorry, Georgia.Im sorry I didnt have more faith in you.Do you know that Lord Seton 						almost fell off his stallion when he first saw me?Do you also know that in 						three short days, he not only found my address but sent me four dozen 						flowers in one basket along with a request to call?All because I looked at 						him and smiled.You aristos are so easy to bed.Though I do plan on letting 						him call.I rather like that adorable dimple that appears on his cheek when 						he smiles.Roderick gave her a long, black 						layered look, not in the least bit amused.You won.I lost.Are you quite 						finished?She paused.Far from it.I told 						you I would make you crawl, and crawl you shall.Erasing all emotion from 						her pretty powdered features, she breathed out a delicate, albeit dramatic, 						breath and regally settled herself back against the pillows.Draping the 						back of her gloved hand gracefully against her forehead, she fluttered her 						eyes shut.Lord Seton is all things divine.As is his brother.I imagine it 						would be like getting two men for the price of one.His lips parted.By all that was 						twisted.She had not only learned the ways of a lady, but the ways of a 						seasoned actress!He leaned in and grabbed her nose, twisting it hard enough 						to ensure it hurt.Ow!She winced and swatted at his hands, shoving them away from her nose.That 						hurt.Im glad for it.That is for blatantly 						trying to make me jealous when I am clearly repentant.He shook his head, 						scanning the pompous amount of shimmering large diamonds covering her 						throat.Those diamonds rested atop plump, cock twitching breasts that pushed 						tauntingly against a very tight bodice.My, my, my.What have you done to 						yourself?I have yet to decide what I think of it.She casually redraped a hand 						across her forehead, feigning boredom.I intend to tote this with pride and 						make you squirm all Season long, which will give you plenty of time to 						decide what you think of it.His eyes clung to hers, daring 						her to make him squirm and crawl.I dont need time.And you will be 						kissing me and telling me that you love me in less than a minute, Georgia.So get to it.Were done playing games.You clearly dont know 						Georgiana.Oh, I think that I 					do.Let us forget what you 						think.Let 						us talk about my breasts instead.You want to touch and fondle them, dont 						you?Admit it.You do.She really was something.He 						waved his forefinger toward them.In truth, I think they are overdone.I 						preferred them the way they were.Small.Less men notice small breasts.As 						such, I ask that you get rid of them.She feigned a laugh.Sadly, 						theyre nonreturnable, because Im not giving up my painted clairs.Id 						sooner remain a spinster than give up the few joys a lady is permitted without 						being considered a slut.Unless, of course, you think sucking on a painted 						clair is the equivalent of sucking on your cock.He lowered his chin.Beneath all 						that finery, she was still his Georgia.Thank bloody God.Enough.You have 						made your point.Georgia haughtily adjusted her 						draped hand against her brow and tossed up at him, I dont think I 						have.He swiped a hand across his 						face, glancing off to the side before shifting back toward her.Jesus 						Christ, Georgia.Do you really intend to draw this out?I have suffered more 						than enough all these months without hearing a word from you and dreading 						you were going to show up at my door naked just to give the ton something to talk 						about.And the sad thing of it?I wanted you to do it.I wanted you to show 						up naked.She paused, peering up at him 						past her limp hand draped against her forehead.That would have actually 						been a good idea.But I have bigger plans.Something that involves a lot 						moresuffering.Shifting against the bed, he 						leaned down closer toward her draped figure and growled down at her, I dare 						you to draw this out.Dare taken.Stripping his gloves, he whipped 						them onto the bed.He then skimmed his hand across 						her throat and leaned down and kissed the smooth, powdered skin just above 						the upper round of her left breast.Im sorry.The tantalizing scent of 						lemon blossomed from her heated skin as he dragged his lips across its 						softness.Take me back, Georgia.For Gods sake, take me back.Take this 						idiot back so that he may spend the rest of his life making it up to 						you.She snorted.You are going to 						have to do better than that, Yardley.He kissed the well of her 						throat, firmly pressing his lips against that throbbing pulse, and then 						licked its entire length, causing her to suck in a breath.If you havent 						noticed, your Robinson depends on you for everything.It would be nothing 						short of cruel to deny him of you.Im not taking you 						back.He lifted his head from the heat 						of her throat and glared at her.Georgia, Christ.Are you serious?Ive 						barely been in your presence for forty minutes and Im already 						exhausted.Yes, well, Im the one who is 						really exhausted after almost a year of dont do this and dont do 						that lest 						you be called a whore.Do you have any idea how hard it is being a 						lady?He lifted a brow.Do you have 						any idea how hard it is being a lord?Especially after having met 						you?She sighed.Now I do.Tis piss 						hard, is what.These bastards expect the world from us yet give us nothing, 						in turn, but superficial airs laced with misery.He bit back a smile, rather 						impressed she had already learned their role in society.Whatever you want, 						you shall have from here on out.You have more than earned it, madam, and I 						look forward to crawling for the rest of my life.He grabbed up her hands, 						stripping her gloves, and kissed their softness repeatedly.He paused and 						held up one of her hands, fingering its smoothness.His gaze snapped to hers 						in disbelief.Your hands.I know.It took a lot of 						scrubbing and daily soaks.Theyre still not what they should be, but in 						time, they will be.His heart squeezed as he glanced 						back down at those hands that seemed so small in comparison to his own.Oh, 						Georgia.He kissed the tips of her fingers and then those knuckles.A part 						of me is so sad to know that I have forced you to change yourself and your 						life merely to be with me.He kissed her hands again.I will miss my 						Georgia.I will miss her so damn much and only pray she wont entirely 						disappear.She slowly smiled, watching him 						kiss her hands.Releasing her hands, he dragged his own down the length of 						her body and back up again, reveling in the feel of her softness and the 						smoothness of her silk embroidered gown.His chest tightened, along with 						every muscle in his body, realizing that this and she were real.She was here in London.With him.God, did I ever miss you, he whispered.I waited and I waited 						for you to come.It was torture of the worst sort.I cannot believe you did 						all of this for me.I am beyond honored.She raked her hands and nails 						through his hair.I cant believe it, either.You owe me.I know I do.He leaned in, 						angling his mouth toward hers.Be forewarned, this is about to get 						rough.Now, now, keep it all buttoned 						up.She sat up on the bed, daintily scooting out of his reach and away.She 						scrambled out of bed, hopping down to the floor with a soft thud and rounded 						the bed with the click click click of slippered heels as she sashayed her way to the 						closed door.He paused and then swung toward 						her direction, the linens dragging up and shifting beneath his movement.Wait.What are you doing?Where are you going?This isnt Orange Street, you 						know.I have a reputation to uphold and I dont trust you any more than I 						trust myself.Opening the door, she pushed it wide with the graceful thrust 						of a gloved hand.That will ensure we dont get into trouble.She paused, glancing toward the 						empty corridor beyond the open door, and then turned toward him, dragging up 						one side of her gown.Gathering the vast amount of material, she exposed the 						shapely length of a leg draped in a white silk stocking that was held in 						place above her knee with a tied bright red garter.Do you like my 						stockings?I just bought them.Theyre silk.After we marry, you may take them off.If youre deserving of it, that is.She primly dropped her skirt with a 						rustle and rearranged her gown.He slid off the bed, his muscles 						roaring in lust.Only Georgia could ever make him crawl and make him love 						every moment of it.Striding toward her, he purposefully towered before 						her.She snapped her gaze up to his 						face.He grinned.How about we close 						the door and tell London to go to hell?She stepped toward him and poked 						him hard in the chest.Go get Robinson before I dirk you, 					Yardley.He tsked and grabbed her by the 						waist, and holding her firmly against himself, he grazed the tip of his 						finger across her powdered cheek.It appears Im not the only one going by 						more than one name, Miss Georgiana Colette 						Tormey.Georgia smacked his shoulder and 						lowered her voice all the more.Georgia is no more until after we marry.Do you 						understand?There is to be no touching or kissing until I legally become Lady 						Yardley.You hear?I hear, he murmured, searching 						her face.Will you at least please pass on one last message from me to 						Georgia, Miss Tormey?Given that I wont be seeing her again until my 						wedding night?A smile touched her lips.What 						is your message, my lord?Glancing toward the door and the 						still empty corridor, Roderick leaned down, grabbed her face and kissed her, 						aggressively parting those soft, warm lips with his own.Closing his eyes 						and giving in to an ecstasy he never thought hed know again, he kissed his 						Georgia passionately and lovingly and erotically, tracing her teeth and her 						tongue and her lips before releasing her.He stepped back, opening his 						eyes, and hissed out a breath, wishing it didnt have to end.Tell her that 						I love her.Georgia lingered before him with 						her eyes still closed, and her chin tilted upward, those full moist lips 						parted as if half expecting his return.She eventually opened her eyes and 						whispered, Ill be sure Georgia knows.Quick footfalls echoed from down 						the corridor heading their way.Yardley?the duke yelled out, those steps now 						breaking into a run.Yardley!Her eyes widened.She gathered 						her skirts and dashed back to the bed, her slippers skidding across the wood 						floor.Scrambling up and onto the mattress, she frantically arranged herself 						and her skirts around her, before draping herself calmly and demurely onto 						the bed.Roderick dragged in a 						much needed breath.He doubted any woman had ever gone this far for a man in 						the name of love.I ardently hope you feel better soon, Miss Tormey.I 						would hate for you to have come all this way only to never see past a bed.Though I have a feeling illness may overtake me soon, as well, and we will 						both be confined to the same bed.What will London say?Shh!Her head jerked up to give him a reprimanding glare before settling 						herself back against the pillows.He grinned.Yardley!The duke skidded into view and stumbled into the 						doorway, his face panicked and flushed.How is Georgia?Quite well, Your Grace, she 						called out, a hand darting up into the air before it dropped back down onto 						the mattress.No need to panic.The duke huffed out a breath.Good.One less thing to worry about.This night is about to turn into a 						mess.Rodericks grin faded as he 						swung fully toward his father, his pulse roaring.Does someone already know 						about Georgia?No.The duke jumped toward him and seized him by the lapels of his coat, shaking 						him.Atwood arrived into town.Hes downstairs.He approached his father 						just this morning, demanding he fess up to what had led to his 						disappearance, but the man is denying everything, along with his legitimacy, 						and there appears to be no goddamn proof of his likeness anywhere.I havent 						told Atwood yet, but I mean to help him.I mean to help him in the name of 						your mother.So, God save me, I am about to not only publicly turn against 						your mothers family, but I am about to dig up that portrait that was buried 						with her thirteen years ago to prove his likeness and who he is.Are you 						with me in this?Will you see me through this, knowing Atwood is all we have 						left of your mother?Bloody hell.All of Londons 						mightiest bridges were about to come falling down.Roderick swallowed 						against the tightness overtaking his throat and half nodded in a daze, 						knowing he had no idea what he was getting himself into.Yes.I am 						with you.Good.Good.I want you to go to 						him.Go!He is in the study and I have to tend to my guests lest this turns 						into a circus.Ill join you as soon as I am able.Keep him in the study, 						and for Gods sake, dont let anyone see him.The man will only scare 						people.I told him he really needs to do something about his appearance.Now 						go.Go to him.Ill be there in about a half hour.His father turned and 						jogged back out.Glancing back at Georgia, who 						had sat up, Roderick pointed at her.Stay where you are.Keep playing the 						game.Ill be back.He dashed out of the room and 						sprinted down the corridor after his father, knowing full well he was going 						to finally see the face of a man he had yet to remember.The face of what 						had started this all.Pounding down the stairs and 						weaving past guests that were lingering outside the ballroom, he jogged 						toward the closed doors of the study.He slid both doors open and quickly 						stepped in, sliding them closed behind himself.The solid broad back of a tall 						man, whose shoulder length, disheveled black hair bore whispers of silver, 						lingered before the portrait of his mother, the Duchess of Wentworth.The 						one he, his father and Yardley used to pray before every Sunday after 						church.It appeared Atwood was praying, too, the way he stood in silence.The black boot length riding coat he wore was heavily frayed to gray and 						even bore a rip at the curve of his shoulder.It was as if he had crawled 						out of the Five Points itself.By God, he was about to meet and 						face yet another blank he had never regained.It was eerie.The floorboards 						creaked beneath Rodericks boots as he slowly made his way toward Atwood.He 						paused several feet behind him.The man continued to blankly 						stare up at his mothers pale face and those soft gray eyes as if in a 						trance.No portrait did her justice.Rodericks voice echoed in the room, sounding a bit more nervous than he 						intended.Atwood turned and fully faced 						him.The yellowing glow of the studys candles illuminated a shaven, lean 						face framed against disheveled, shoulder length black hair.Cool ice blue 						eyes that bespoke of a hard life held Rodericks gaze.His large gloved hand 						gripped the hilt of a dagger that was sheathed and attached to the leather 						belt resting on his hip.Im your nephew, Roderick 						offered to reassure the man that the blade was unnecessary.Yardley.I know who you are, Atwood 						replied in a low but casual tone that was laced with an accent that appeared 						to be an odd combination of American and British.We met.Back in New 						York.Roderick swallowed.Forgive me 						for not being able to remember.I had an incident that  I know.You neednt worry.Im 						not all that memorable, anyway.Atwood eyed him.Allow me to get to the 						point of my visit tonight, nephew of mine.One I have yet to convey to your 						father.After a less than constructive meeting with my father this morning, 						who refused to let my mother see me, I have decided to kill him.Tonight, 						actually.After he leaves this house and heads into his carriage.And I 						intend to have all of London witness it.Why am I telling you this?Because 						when you are brought before the jury, I dont want there to be any doubt as 						to what my motives were.Tell them it wasnt revenge but a savage need for 						peace.Roderick stared, not knowing 						what astonished him more.Those words or how casually he had said them.Dont do this.Killing him will only see you hanged.Exactly.Peace.Oh, no.No, no, no.The man was 						not about to do this and drag him and his father into another nightmare.He 						edged toward him.Killing him and then getting yourself hanged will change 						nothing.Atwood flexed his leather gloved 						hands.I know.Hell, the man was serious.Not 						to mention absolutely insane.Uncle.If you do this, you will not only 						destroy yourself, but you will ruin my father, and me, as well.Youll also 						be destroying the wife I hope to take and the children I hope to have.All 						we would ever know and hear and see would be the blood you rashly spilled 						and the mess you left for us to mop up.His uncle pointed a gloved 						finger to his own head.I am not going to live inside this head a breath 						more.It was as if he were meeting a 						deranged version of himself prior to regaining his memory.No one 						understands you more than I.  Believe me.Living within a head you would 						rather step out of is a curse of the worst sort, but there are ways to allay 						the misery.But not like this.You will find it through the support and love 						of your family.Atwoods face darkened.The 						Sumners are not my family.Right you are in that.The 						Sumners are not.But we are.I am.My father is.My father loves you given 						all that you represent.He loves you enough to unearth his own wifes 						remains, which I know will kill him considering what she meant to him.Despite that, you mean to dirk him?You mean to dirk the last person who 						remains standing in your corner in order to entertain some morbid urge for 						revenge?Atwood searched his face.He 						means to disturb my sisters grave?I wont have it.Tis the only means we have of 						proving your legitimacy.My father told me about my grandfather denying your 						legitimacy, but this would prove it.Tis the only known portrait of you 						in existence with a label of your name and it lies buried with my 						mother.Atwood momentarily closed his 						eyes.She was buried with my portrait?That she was.She carried you 						upon her lips and within her heart until her last breath was taken and spent 						her entire life wanting to find you.If you dont mean to honor the living, 						Uncle, I ask that you at least honor the dead.My mother deserved as 						much.Atwoods features twisted as he 						swung away.After a long moment of silence, he turned back and wordlessly 						unfastened the leather belt from around his hips.He folded the belt around 						the sheath of his dagger and held it out.Take it before I use 					it.Roderick grabbed hold of the 						belt and dagger, a breath escaping his lips.He tightened his hold on the 						worn leather and slowly shook his head.You need to find peace.Atwood set his shoulders and 						slowly rounded him.I hear death is a nice long sleep.Sounds peaceful 						enough to me.Roderick drew in a ragged breath 						and let it out.Take back the life that was so maliciously taken from you 						and create something worthier.Surround yourself with people who will love 						you and support you whilst taking your place back in our circle where you 						belong.That is how you will find and know peace.Give yourself a chance to 						know it.Consider starting a family and commencing anew.A gargled laugh escaped his 						uncle.Taking an aristo for a wife, whod never understand the chaos within 						me, would only beget children whose bedtime stories would involve my 						nightmares.I dont think so.Turning toward him, Roderick 						offered in a sympathetic tone, You underestimate a womans worth and her 						ability to redefine a man.A woman can give you hope in a world that has 						none.She can fight for you when you have ceased fighting for yourself and 						everything you believe in.Atwood glanced toward him.Smitten, are you?Beyond.You should be so 						lucky.Atwood smirked.Distract me.Whats her name?Roderick bit back a smile.Her 						real one?Or the one she is parading under?For I will confess I am about to 						marry two women for the price of one.She is divine intervention.I have 						never known anyone or anything so exquisite.I could use a little divine 						intervention.His uncle strode back toward him and leaned in.The smell of 						leather penetrated the air.Would you be willing to share her with your 						uncle from time to time?When Im feeling particularly lonely?Or are you 						the territorial sort?Roderick tossed aside the 						leather belt and blade with a resounding clatter, lest he use it himself, 						and stared his uncle down, fury streaking through his body and his mind.Do 						I look amused?Atwood snorted and patted his 						cheek, the cool leather grazing his skin.Now, now, you aristos are so 						easily ruffled.I was joking.Were you?Roderick reached out 						and purposefully gripped the mans muscled shoulder hard, digging the tips 						of his fingers into the flesh beneath.Dont cross the only family you have 						left, Atwood.Dont even joke about it.His uncles ice blue eyes seemed 						to be taunting him.You neednt worry, nephew.I only cross those that 						cross me.And you havent crossed meyet.Flinging Rodericks hand away, 						he started backward toward the doors of the study, still holding his gaze.I think Im going to like London.There are just so many civilized people 						crawling around my boots looking to lick them clean.Now if youll excuse 						meI intend to find myself a dance partner and scare the shite out of 						people.Swinging away, he slid open the 						doors with a single sweep of his long arms and disappeared with the 						billowing movement of his long riding coat.Roderick winced, knowing he was 						supposed to keep Atwood in the study, but had a feeling all of London was 						fecked either way.So he let him walk, thankful to no end that he had 						Georgia to see him through whatever mess lay ahead.EPILOGUE       EPILOGUE mnia vincit amor; et nos cedamus 						amori.Love conquers all things: let us, 						too, surrender to Love.Virgil, Eclogues: Book X (70 						BC19 BC) Seven years later, evening 						The Tremayne household in London THE DOOR TO THEIR BEDCHAMBER creaked open 						inchby inchby inchby inch.Georgia sat up against the 						pillows, setting aside her needlework, and tapped at Rodericks open book.Tis set to begin.Roderick slapped his book shut 						and tossed it with the flick of his wrist onto the linen before them, 						shifting toward the door.Adjusting his robe, he called out toward the 						now open door, The answer is still no.So I suggest you go back to the 						nursery and mope about it to your brothers, who have yet to care about 						anything beyond milk.Their daughter, Ballad Jane, 						padded into the room, twirling her dark braids, and eventually paused beside 						their bed, her large green eyes darting from Georgia to Roderick.Uncle 						Atwood wouldnt say no to me.Nor would Uncle Milton.Georgia glanced over at Roderick 						and drawled, Now, how can you argue with that?Roderick threw back his dark 						head and huffed up at the ceiling, The answer is still no.But, Papa Ballad fell 						against the edge of the bed in exasperation, leaning toward him.Reaching 						up, she patted both hands against the mattress she barely reached, each pat 						emphasizing every word she insisted on saying.I really, really want an 						elephant.Preferably a girl elephant.No, not preferably.Definitely.Definitely a girl elephant.It can sleep with me.I dont mind.Really.Please?I 						only want one.Georgia burst into laughter.That child is yours, Robinson.Not mine.You were the one to read her all 						of those stories about India.Now handle it.He sighed.Come here, love.His dark brows came together as he leaned toward the edge of the bed, 						reached down and yanked their daughter up and onto his lap.Settling her into place and 						yanking her white nightdress down over her small stockinged feet, he lowered 						his head to hers, intently holding her gaze.Where on earth are we going to 						keep an elephant in the middle of London?Animals of such size are only 						meant for the wilderness.Even Hyde Park would make the poor thing feel 						unwelcome.How about we get you a dog instead?The biggest one we can find?Or a pony?Would you prefer a pony?Ballad puckered her lips as if 						he were 						being ridiculous.I dont want a dog and I dont want a pony.Everyone has 						dogs and ponies in London and I dont want what everyone else has.I want an 						elephant.No one has any of those.A laugh rumbled out from 						Rodericks lips.There is a reason for it.Papa, pleeeeeease.Ballad 						clasped her six year old hands together and shook them up at him pleadingly.I will never, ever, ever ask for anything again.He sighed.The answer is still 						no and you are old enough to understand why I am saying no.Are we 						done?Ballad dropped her clasped hands 						into her lap.She glanced up at him and swept a finger out toward Georgia.Mama said that if we take up Grandpapas offer of living at his estate in 						Surrey, there would be more than enough room for an elephant, given all the 						acreage he has.Cant we call on Grandpapa and tell him we are moving in?That way, I get to see him every day and I get an elephant.Roderick turned to Georgia, 						glaring at her.You didnt actually promise her an elephant if we moved in 						with my father, did you?Georgia grinned and leaned 						toward him.You wanted a big family, Robinson.It doesnt get any bigger than 						that.She jabbed his shoulder.Butif the elephant is a bit much, and Ill agree that 						it is, I suggest we take the child to India for a few months instead, lest 						we never know peace.Ive always wanted to go.Wouldnt it be 					fun?Fun?Roderick eyed them both, even as his daughters eyes had lit up at 						Georgias suggestion.Crawling into the mouth of a crouching tiger in the 						middle of a sweltering jungle is not what I call fun.How about we go to 						France?Ballad crossed her arms and 						huffed out a breath, grouching, I never get anything.Not the pistol that I 						wanted.Not the sword that I wanted.Not even the monkey.And now this.What 						good is having money if we never use it for anything?Roderick elbowed Georgia hard.We know where that tongue comes from.He paused, shaking his head, and 						eventually blew out a breath.Fine.We go to India.That at least would be 						educational and money well spent.Only, were leaving all of the elephants 						there.Is 						that understood?He gently tapped at Ballads forehead.I also dont want 						any more of this talk about how I never give you anything.Money is a 						privilege, Ballad, not a right.Yes, Papa.Ballad let out a joyful screech, 						throwing up both hands.She scrambled out of his lap and off the bed, 						landing on the floor with an echoing thud.India!Dashing out the door, with 						hands still waving, she disappeared into the corridor shouting, I have the 						best Mama ever!Roderick paused and jerked 						toward Georgia.That little brat forgot to thank the one person who is 						paying the goddamn bill.Georgia grabbed hold of his 						robe, dragging him down toward her onto the mattress.All that really 						matters, Robinson, is that I know who is paying the bill.It could be worse.She 						could be wanting a cougar.Can you imagine?Roderick let out a growl, 						replicating one himself, and shoved his warm hand beneath her nightdress, 						causing her to squeak.And what do you want, Lady Yardley?Move your hand a little lower 						and to the left.And when were done, I want you to go fetch us some 						whiskey.Yes and yes, madam.Anything 						else?Yes.Close the 					door.
