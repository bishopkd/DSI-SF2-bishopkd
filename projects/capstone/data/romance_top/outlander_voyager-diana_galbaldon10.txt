He says that it wasnt himhe wasnt the man she went to Culloden to see.It was a friend of his, Ewan Cameron.Yere lying, he said flatly.Or he is.It makes little difference.Where is he?He gave me a small shake, and I jerked hard, managing to detach my arm from his grip.I tell you, he had nothing to do with what happened to your sister!I was backing away, wondering how to get away from him without setting him loose to blunder about the grounds in search of Jamie, making noise and drawing unwelcome attention to the rescue effort.Eight men were enough to overcome the pillars of Hercules, but not enough to withstand a hundred roused slaves.Where?The Reverend was advancing on me, eyes boring into mine.Hes in Kingston!I said.I glanced to one side; I was near a pair of French doors opening onto the veranda.I thought I could get out without his catching me, but then what?Having him chase me through the grounds would be worse than keeping him talking in here.I looked back at the Reverend, who was scowling at me in disbelief, and then what I had seen on the terrace registered in my minds eye, and I jerked my head back around, staring.I had seen it.There was a large white pelican perched on the veranda railing, head turned back, beak buried comfortably in its feathers.Ping Ans plumage glinted silver against the night in the dim light from the doorway.What is it?Reverend Campbell demanded.Who is it?Whos out there?Just a bird, I said, turning back to him.My heart was beating in a jerky rhythm.Mr.Willoughby must surely be nearby.Pelicans were common, near the mouths of rivers, near the shore, but I had never seen one so far inland.But if Mr.Willoughby was in fact lurking nearby, what ought I to do about it?I doubt very much that your husband is in Kingston, the Reverend was saying, narrowed eyes fixed on me with suspicion.However, if he is, he will presumably be coming here, to retrieve you.Oh, no!I said.No, I repeated, with as much assurance as I could manage.Jamie isnt coming here.I came by myself, to visit GeillisMrs.Abernathy.My husband isnt expecting me back until next month.He didnt believe me, but there was nothing he could do about it, either.His mouth pursed up in a tiny rosette, then unpuckered enough to ask, So you are staying here?Yes, I said, pleased that I knew enough about the geography of the place to pretend to be a guest.If the servants were gone, there was no one to say I wasnt, after all.He stood still, regarding me narrowly for a long moment.Then his jaw tightened and he nodded grudgingly.Indeed.Then I suppose yell have some notion as to where our hostess has taken herself, and when she proposes to return?I was beginning to have a rather unsettling notion of whereif not exactly whenGeillis Abernathy might have gone, but the Reverend Campbell didnt seem the proper person with whom to share it.No, Im afraid not, I said.Iah, Ive been out visiting since yesterday, at the neighboring plantation.Just came back this minute.The Reverend eyed me closely, but I was in fact wearing a riding habitbecause it was the only decent set of clothes I owned, besides the violet ball dress and two wash muslin gownsand my story passed unchallenged.I see, he said.Mmphm.Well, then.He fidgeted restlessly, his big bony hands clenching and unclenching themselves, as though he were not certain what to do with them.Dont let me disturb you, I said, with a charming smile and a nod at the desk.Im sure you must have important work to do.He pursed his lips again, in that objectionable way that made him look like an owl contemplating a juicy mouse.The work has been completed.I was only preparing copies of some documents that Mrs.Abernathy had requested.How interesting, I said automatically, thinking that with luck, after a few moments small talk, I could escape under the pretext of retiring to my theoretical roomall the first floor rooms opened onto the veranda, and it would be a simple matter to slip off into the night to meet Jamie.Perhaps you share our hostesssand my owninterest in Scottish history and scholarship?His gaze had sharpened, and with a sinking heart I recognized the fanatical gleam of the passionate researcher in his eyes.I knew it well.Well, its very interesting, Im sure, I said, edging toward the door, but I must say, I really dont know very much about I caught sight of the top sheet on his pile of documents, and stopped dead.It was a genealogy chart.I had seen plenty of those, living with Frank, but I recognized this particular one.It was a chart of the Fraser familythe bloody thing was even headed Fraser of Lovatbeginning somewhere around the 1400s, so far as I could see, and running down to the present.I could see Simon, the lateand not so lamented, in some quartersJacobite lord, who had been executed for his part in Charles Stuarts Rising, and his descendants, whose names I recognized.And down in one corner, with the sort of notation indicating illegitimacy, was Brian FraserJamies father.And beneath him, written in a precise black hand, James A.  Fraser.I felt a chill ripple up my back.The Reverend had noticed my reaction, and was watching with a sort of dry amusement.Yes, it is interesting that it should be the Frasers, isnt it?Thatwhat should be the Frasers?I said.Despite myself, I moved slowly toward the desk.The subject of the prophecy, of course, he said, looking faintly surprised.Do ye not know of it?But perhaps, your husband being an illegitimate descendant  I dont know of it, no.Ah.The Reverend was beginning to enjoy himself, seizing the opportunity to inform me.I thought perhaps Mrs.Abernathy had spoken of it to you; she being so interested as to have written to me in Edinburgh regarding the matter.He thumbed through the stack, extracting one paper that appeared to be written in Gaelic.This is the original language of the prophecy, he said, shoving Exhibit A under my nose.By the Brahan Seer; youll have heard of the Brahan Seer, surely?His tone held out little hope, but in fact, I had heard of the Brahan Seer, a sixteenth century prophet along the lines of a Scottish Nostradamus.I have.Its a prophecy concerning the Frasers?The Frasers of Lovat, aye.The language is poetic, as I pointed out to Mistress Abernathy, but the meaning is clear enough.He was gathering enthusiasm as he went along, notwithstanding his suspicions of me.The prophecy states that a new ruler of Scotland will spring from Lovats lineage.This is to come to pass following the eclipse of the kings of the white rosea clear reference to the Papist Stuarts, of course.He nodded at the white roses woven into the carpet.There are somewhat more cryptic references included in the prophecy, of course; the time in which this ruler will appear, and whether it is to be a king or a queenthere is some difficulty in interpretation, owing to mishandling of the original  He went on, but I wasnt listening.If I had had any doubt about where Geilie had gone, it was fast disappearing.Obsessed with the rulers of Scotland, she had spent the better part of ten years in working for the restoration of a Stuart Throne.That attempt had failed most definitively at Culloden, and she had then expressed nothing but contempt for all extant Stuarts.And little wonder, if she thought she knew what was coming next.But where would she go?Back to Scotland, perhaps, to involve herself with Lovats heir?No, she was thinking of making the leap through time again; that much was clear from her conversation with me.She was preparing herself, gathering her resourcesretrieving the treasure from the silkies isleand completing her researches.I stared at the paper in a kind of fascinated horror.The genealogy, of course, was only recorded to the present.Did Geilie know who Lovats descendants would be, in the future?I looked up to ask the Reverend Campbell a question, but the words froze on my lips.Standing in the door to the veranda was Mr.Willoughby.The little Chinese had evidently been having a rough time; his silk pajamas were torn and stained, and his round face was beginning to show the hollows of hunger and fatigue.His eyes passed over me with only a remote flicker of acknowledgment; all his attention was for the Reverend Campbell.Most holy fella, he said, and his voice held a tone I had never heard in him before; an ugly taunting note.The Reverend whirled, so quickly that his elbow knocked against a vase; water and yellow roses cascaded over the rosewood desk, soaking the papers.The Reverend gave a cry of rage, and snatched the papers from the flood, shaking them frantically to remove the water before the ink should run.See what yeve done, ye wicked, murdering heathen!Mr.Willoughby laughed.Not his usual high giggle, but a low chuckle.It didnt sound at all amused.I murdering?He shook his head slowly back and forth, eyes fixed on the Reverend.Not me, holy fella.Is you, murderer.Begone, fellow, Campbell said coldly.You should know better than to enter a ladys house.I know you.The Chinamans voice was low and even, his gaze unwavering.I see you.See you in red room, with the woman who laughs.See you too with stinking whores, in Scotland.Very slowly, he lifted his hand to his throat and drew it across, precise as a blade.You kill pretty often, holy fella, I think.The Reverend Campbell had gone pale, whether from shock or rage, I couldnt tell.I was pale, toofrom fear.I wet my dry lips and forced myself to speak.Mr.Willoughby  Not Willoughby.He didnt look at me; the correction was almost indifferent.I am Yi Tien Cho.Seeking escape from the present situation, my mind wondered absurdly whether the proper form of address would be Mr.Yi, or Mr.Cho?Get out at once!The Reverends paleness came from rage.He advanced on the little Chinese, massive fists clenched.Mr.Willoughby didnt move, seemingly indifferent to the looming minister.Better you leave, First Wife, he said, softly.Holy fella liking womennot with cock.With knife.I wasnt wearing a corset, but felt as though I were.I couldnt get enough breath to form words.Nonsense!the Reverend said sharply.I tell you againget out!Or I shall  Just stand still, please, Reverend Campbell, I said.Hands shaking, I drew the pistol Jamie had given me out of the pocket of my habit and pointed it at him.Rather to my surprise, he did stand still, staring at me as though I had just grown two heads.I had never held anyone at gunpoint before; the sensation was quite oddly intoxicating, in spite of the way the pistols barrel wavered.At the same time, I had no real idea what to do.Mr.I gave up, and used all his names.Yi Tien Cho.Did you see the Reverend at the Governors ball with Mrs.Alcott?I see him kill her, Yi Tien Cho said flatly.Better shoot, First Wife.Dont be ridiculous!My dear Mrs.Fraser, surely you cannot believe the word of a savage, who is himself The Reverend turned toward me, trying for a superior expression, which was rather impaired by the small beads of sweat that had formed at the edge of his receding hairline.But I think I do, I said.You were there.I saw you.And you were in Edinburgh when the last prostitute was killed there.Nellie Cowden said youd lived in Edinburgh for two years; thats how long the Fiend was killing girls there.The trigger was slippery under my forefinger.Thats how long he had lived there, too!The Reverends face was losing its paleness, becoming more flushed by the moment.He jerked his head toward the Chinese.Will you take the word of the man who betrayed your husband?Who?Him!The Reverends exasperation roughened his voice.It is this wicked creature who betrayed Fraser to Sir Percival Turner.Sir Percival told me!I nearly dropped the gun.Things were happening a lot too fast for me.I hoped desperately that Jamie and his men had found Ian and returned to the riversurely they would come to the house, if I was not at the rendezvous.I lifted the pistol a little, meaning to tell the Reverend to go down the breezeway to the kitchen; locking him in one of the storage pantries was the best thing I could think of to do.I think youd better I began, and then he lunged at me.My finger squeezed the trigger in reflex.Simultaneously, there was a loud report, the weapon kicked in my hand, and a small cloud of black powder smoke rolled past my face, making my eyes water.I hadnt hit him.The explosion had startled him, but now his face settled into new lines of satisfaction.Without speaking, he reached into his coat and drew out a chased metal case, six inches long.From one end of this protruded a handle of white staghorn.With the horrible clarity that attends crisis of all kinds, I noted everything, from the nick in the edge of the blade as he drew it from the case, to the scent of the rose he crushed beneath one foot as he came toward me.There was nowhere to run.I braced myself to fight, knowing fight was useless.The fresh scar of the cutlass slash burned on my arm, a reminder of what was coming that made my flesh shrink.There was a flash of blue in the corner of my vision, and a juicy thunk!as though someone had dropped a melon from some height.The Reverend turned very slowly on one shoe, eyes wide open and quite, quite blank.For that one moment, he looked like Margaret.Then he fell.He fell all of a piece, not putting out a hand to save himself.One of the satinwood tables went flying, scattering potpourri and polished stones.The Reverends head hit the floor at my feet, bounced slightly and lay still.I took one convulsive step back and stood trapped, back against the wall.There was a dreadful contused depression in his temple.As I watched, his face changed color, fading before my eyes from the red of choler to a pasty white.His chest rose, fell, paused, rose again.His eyes were open; so was his mouth.Tsei mi is here, First Wife?The Chinese was putting the bag that held the stone balls back into his sleeve.Yes, hes hereout there.I waved vaguely toward the veranda.Whathedid you really?I felt the waves of shock creeping over me and fought them back, closing my eyes and drawing in a breath as deep as I could manage.Was it you?I said, my eyes still closed.If he was going to cave in my head as well, I didnt want to watch.Did he tell the truth?Was it you who gave away the meeting place at Arbroath to Sir Percival?Who told him about Malcolm, and the printshop?There was neither answer nor movement, and after a moment, I opened my eyes.He was standing there, watching the Reverend Campbell.Archibald Campbell lay still as death, but was not yet dead.The dark angel was coming, though; his skin had taken on the faint green tinge I had seen before in dying men.Still, his lungs moved, taking air with a high wheezing sound.It wasnt an Englishman, then, I said.My hands were wet, and I wiped them on my skirt.An English name.Willoughby.Not Willoughby, he said sharply.I am Yi Tien Cho!Why!I said, almost shouting.Look at me, damn you!Why?He did look at me then.His eyes were black and round as marbles, but they had lost their shine.In China, he said, there arestories.Prophecy.That one day the ghosts will come.Everyone fear ghost.He nodded once, twice, then glanced again at the figure on the floor.I leave China to save my life.Waking up long timeI see ghosts.All round me, ghosts, he said softly.A big ghost comeshorrible white face, most horrible, hair on fire.I think he will eat my soul.His eyes had been fixed on the Reverend; now they rose to my face, remote and still as standing water.I am right, he said simply, and nodded again.He had not shaved his head recently, but the scalp beneath the black fuzz gleamed in the light from the window.He eat my soul, Tsei mi.I am no more, Yi Tien Cho.He saved your life, I said.He nodded once more.I know.Better I die.Better die than be Willoughby.Willoughby!Ptah!He turned his head and spat.His face contorted, suddenly angry.He talks my words, Tsei mi!He eats my soul!The fit of anger seemed to pass as quickly as it had come on.He was sweating, though the room was not terribly warm.He passed a trembling hand over his face, wiping away the moisture.There is a man I see in tavern.Ask for Mac Doo.I am drunk, he said dispassionately.Wanting woman, no woman come with melaugh, saying yellow worm, point He waved a hand vaguely toward the front of his trousers.He shook his head, his queue rustling softly against the silk.No matter what gwao fei do; all same to me.I am drunk, he said again.Ghost man wants Mac Doo, ask I am knowing.Say yes, I know MacDoo.He shrugged.It is not important what I say.He was staring at the minister again.I saw the narrow black chest rise slowly, fallrise once more, falland remain still.There was no sound in the room; the wheezing had stopped.It is a debt, Yi Tien Cho said.He nodded toward the still body.I am dishonored.I am stranger.But I pay.Your life for mine, First Wife.You tell Tsei mi.He nodded once more, and turned toward the door.There was a faint rustling of feathers from the dark veranda.On the threshold he turned back.When I wake on dock, I am thinking ghosts have come, are all around me, Yi Tien Cho said softly.His eyes were dark and flat, with no depth to them.But I am wrong.It is me; I am the ghost.There was a stir of breeze at the French windows, and he was gone.The quick soft sound of felt shod feet passed down the veranda, followed by the rustle of spread wings, and a soft, plaintive Gwaaa!that faded into the night sounds of the plantation.I made it to the sofa before my knees gave way.I bent down and laid my head on my knees, praying that I would not faint.The blood hammered in my ears.I thought I heard a wheezing breath, and jerked up my head in panic, but the Reverend Campbell lay quite still.I could not stay in the same room with him.I got up, circling as far around the body as I could get, but before I reached the veranda door, I had changed my mind.All the events of the evening were colliding in my head like the bits of glass in a kaleidoscope.I could not stop now to think, to make sense of it all.But I remembered the Reverends words, before Yi Tien Cho had come.If there was any clue here to where Geillis Abernathy had gone, it would be upstairs.I took a candle from the table, lighted it, and made my way through the dark house to the staircase, resisting the urge to look behind me.I felt very cold.The workroom was dark, but a faint, eerie violet glow hovered over the far end of the counter.There was an odd burnt smell in the room, that stung the back of my nose and made me sneeze.The faint metallic aftertaste in the back of my throat reminded me of a long ago chemistry class.Quicksilver.Burning mercury.The vapor it gave off was not only eerily beautiful, but highly toxic as well.I snatched out a handkerchief and plastered it over my nose and mouth as I went toward the site of the violet glow.The lines of the pentacle had been charred into the wood of the counter.If she had used stones to mark a pattern, she had taken them with her, but she had left something else behind.The photograph was heavily singed at the edges, but the center was untouched.My heart gave a thump of shock.I seized the picture, clutching Briannas face to my chest with a mingled feeling of fury and panic.What did she mean by thisthis desecration?It couldnt have been meant as a gesture toward me or Jamie, for she could not have expected either of us ever to have seen it.It must be magicor Geilies version of it.I tried frantically to recall our conversation in this room; what had she said?She had been curious about how I had traveled through the stonesthat was the main thing.And what had I said?Only something vague, about fixing my attention on a personyes, that was itI said I had fixed my attention on a specific person inhabiting the time to which I was drawn.I drew a deep breath, and discovered that I was trembling, both with delayed reaction from the scene in the salon, and from a dreadful, growing apprehension.It might be only that Geilie had decided to try my techniqueif one could dignify it with such a wordas well as her own, and use the image of Brianna as a point of fixation for her travel.OrI thought of the Reverends piles of neat, handwritten papers, the carefully drawn genealogies, and thought I might just faint.One of the Brahan Seers prophecies, he had said.Concerning the Frasers of Lovat.Scotlands ruler will come from that lineage.But thanks to Roger Wakefields researches, I knewwhat Geilie almost certainly knew as well, obsessed as she was with Scottish historythat Lovats direct line had failed in the 1800s.To all visible intents and purposes, that is.There was in fact one survivor of that line living in 1968Brianna.It took a moment for me to realize that the low, growling sound I heard was coming from my own throat, and a moment more of conscious effort to unclench my jaws.I stuffed the mutilated photograph into the pocket of my skirt and whirled, running for the door as though the workroom were inhabited by demons.I had to find Jamienow.They were not there.The boat floated silently, empty in the shadows of the big cecropia where we had left it, but of Jamie and the rest, there was no sign at all.One of the cane fields lay a short distance to my right, between me and the looming rectangle of the refinery beyond.The faint caramel smell of burnt sugar lingered over the field.Then the wind changed, and I smelled the clean, damp scent of moss and wet rocks from the stream, with all the tiny pungencies of the water plants intermingled.The stream bank rose sharply here, going up in a mounded ridge that ended at the edge of the cane field.I scrambled up the slope, my palm slipping in soft sticky mud.I shook it off with a muffled exclamation of disgust and wiped my hand on my skirt.A thrill of anxiety ran through me.Bloody hell, where was Jamie?He should have been back long since.Two torches burned by the front gate of Rose Hall, small dots of flickering light at this distance.There was a closer light as well; a glow from the left of the refinery.Had Jamie and his men met trouble there?I could hear a faint singing from that direction, and see a deeper glow that bespoke a large open fire.It seemed peaceful, but something about the nightor the placemade me very uneasy.Suddenly I became aware of another scent, above the tang of watercress and burnt sugara strong putrid sweet smell that I recognized at once as the smell of rotten meat.I took a cautious step, and all hell promptly broke loose underfoot.It was as though a piece of the night had suddenly detached itself from the rest and sprung into action at about the level of my knees.A very large object exploded into movement close to me, and there was a stunning blow across my lower legs that knocked me off my feet.My involuntary shriek coincided with a truly awful sounda sort of loud, grunting hiss that confirmed my impression that I was in close juxtaposition to something large, alive, and reeking of carrion.I didnt know what it was, but I wanted no part of it.I had landed very hard on my bottom.I didnt pause to see what was happening, but flipped over and made off through the mud and leaves on all fours, followed by a repetition of the grunting hiss, only louder, and a scrabbling, sliding sort of rush.Something hit my foot a glancing blow, and I stumbled to my feet, running.I was so panicked that I didnt realize that I suddenly could see, until the man loomed up before me.I crashed into him, and the torch he was carrying dropped to the ground, hissing as it struck the wet leaves.Hands grabbed my shoulders, and there were shouts behind me.My face was pressed against a hairless chest with a strong musky smell about it.I regained my balance, gasping, and leaned back to look into the face of a tall black slave, who was gaping down at me in perplexed dismay.Missus, what you be doin here?he said.Before I could answer, though, his attention was distracted from me to what was going on behind me.His grip on my shoulders relaxed, and I turned to see.Six men surrounded the beast.Two carried torches, which they held aloft to light the other four, dressed only in loin cloths, who cautiously circled, holding sharpened wooden poles at the ready.My legs were still stinging and wobbly from the blow they had taken; when I saw what had struck me, they nearly gave way again.The thing was nearly twelve feet long, with an armored body the size of a rum cask.The great tail whipped suddenly to one side; the man nearest leapt aside, shouting in alarm, and the saurians head turned, jaws opening slightly to emit another hiss.The jaws clicked shut with an audible snap, and I saw the telltale carnassial tooth, jutting up from the lower jaw in an expression of grim and spurious pleasantry.Never smile at a crocodile, I said stupidly.No, maam, I surely wont, the slave said, leaving me and edging cautiously toward the scene of action.The men with the poles were poking at the beast, evidently trying to irritate it.In this endeavor, they appeared to be succeeding.The fat, splayed limbs dug hard into the ground, and the crocodile charged, roaring.It lunged with astonishing speed; the man before it yelped and jumped back, lost his footing on the slippery mud and fell.The man who had collided with me launched himself through the air and landed on the crocodiles back.The men with the torches danced back and forth, yelling encouragement, and one of the pole men, bolder than the others, dashed forward and whacked his pole across the broad, plated head to distract it, while the fallen slave scrabbled backward, bare heels scooping trenches in the black mud.The man on the crocodiles back was gropingwith what seemed to me suicidal maniafor the beasts mouth.Getting a hold with one arm about the thick neck, he managed to grab the end of the snout with one hand, and holding the mouth shut, screamed something to his companions.Suddenly a figure I hadnt noticed before stepped out of the shadow of the cane.It went down on one knee before the struggling pair, and without hesitation, slipped a rope noose around the lizards jaws.The shouting rose in a yell of triumph, cut off by a sharp word from the kneeling figure.He rose and motioned violently, shouting commands.He wasnt speaking English, but his concern was obvious; the great tail was still free, lashing from side to side with a force that would have felled any man who came within range of it.Seeing the power of that stroke, I could only marvel that my own legs were merely bruised, and not broken.The pole men dashed in closer, in response to the commands of their leader.I could feel the half pleasant numbness of shock stealing over me, and in that state of unreality, it somehow seemed no surprise to see that the leader was the man called Ishmael.Huwe!he said, making violent upward gestures with his palms that made his meaning obvious.Two of the pole men had gotten their poles shoved under the belly; a third now managed a lucky strike past the tossing head, and lodged his pole under the chest.Huwe!Ishmael said again, and all three threw themselves hard upon their poles.With a sucking splat!the reptile flipped over and landed thrashing on its back, its underside a sudden gleaming white in the torchlight.The torchbearers were shouting again; the noise rang in my ears.Then Ishmael stopped them with a word, his hand thrown out in demand, palm up.I couldnt tell what the word was, but it could as easily have been Scalpel!The intonationand the resultwere the same.One of the torchbearers hastily tugged the cane knife from his loincloth, and slapped it into his leaders hand.Ishmael turned on his heel and in the same movement, drove the point of the knife deep into the crocodiles throat, just where the scales of the jaw joined those of the neck.The blood welled black in the torchlight.All the men stepped back then, and stood at a safe distance, watching the dying frenzy of the great reptile with a respect mingled with deep satisfaction.Ishmael straightened, shirt a pale blur against the dark canes; unlike the other men, he was fully dressed, save for bare feet, and a number of small leather bags swung at his belt.Owing to some freak of the nervous system, I had kept standing all this time.The increasingly urgent messages from my legs made it through to my brain at this point, and I sat down quite suddenly, my skirts billowing on the muddy ground.The movement attracted Ishmaels notice; the narrow head turned in my direction, and his eyes widened.The other men, seeing him, turned also, and a certain amount of incredulous comment in several languages followed.I wasnt paying much attention.The crocodile was still breathing, in stertorous, bubbling gasps.So was I.  My eyes were fixed on the long scaled head, its eye with a slit pupil glowing the greenish gold of tourmaline, its oddly indifferent gaze seeming fixed in turn on me.The crocodiles grin was upside down, but still in place.The mud was cool and smooth beneath my cheek, black as the thick stream that flowed between the lizards scales.The tone of the questions and comments had changed to concern, but I was no longer listening.I hadnt actually lost consciousness; I had a vague impression of jostling bodies and flickering light, and then I was lifted into the air, clutched tight in someones arms.They were talking excitedly, but I caught only a word now and then.I dimly thought I should tell them to lay me down and cover me with something, but my tongue wasnt working.Leaves brushed my face as my escort ruthlessly shouldered the canes aside; it was like pushing through a cornfield that had no ears, all stalks and rustling leaves.There was no conversation among the men now; the susurrus of our passage drowned even the sound of footsteps.By the time we entered the clearing by the slave huts, both sight and wits had returned to me.Bar scrapes and bruises, I wasnt hurt, but I saw no point in advertising the fact.I kept my eyes closed and stayed limp as I was carried into one of the huts, fighting back panic, and hoping to come up with some sensible plan before I was obliged to wake up officially.Where in bloody hell were Jamie and the others?If all went wellor worse, if it didntwhat were they going to do when they arrived at the landing place and found me gone, with tracestraces?the place was a bloody wallow!of a struggle where I had been?And what about friend Ishmael?What in the name of all merciful God was he doing here?I knew one thinghe wasnt bloody well cooking.There was a good deal of festive noise outside the open door of the hut, and the scent of something alcoholicnot rum, something raw and pungentfloated in, a high note in the fuggy air of the hut, redolent of sweat and boiled yams.I cracked an eye and saw the reflected glimmer of firelight on the beaten earth.Shadows moved back and forth in front of the open door; I couldnt leave without being seen.There was a general shout of triumph, and all the figures disappeared abruptly, in what I assumed was the direction of the fire.Presumably they were doing something to the crocodile, who had arrived when I did, swinging upside down from the hunters poles.I rolled cautiously up onto my knees.Could I steal away while they were occupied with whatever they were doing?If I could make it to the nearest cane field, I was fairly sure they couldnt find me, but I was by no means so sure that I could find the river again, alone in the pitch dark.Ought I to make for the main house, instead, in hopes of running into Jamie and his rescue party?I shuddered slightly at the thought of the house, and the long, silent black form on the floor of the salon.But if I didnt go to either house or boat, how was I to find them, on a moonless night black as the Devils armpit?My planning was interrupted by a shadow in the doorway that momentarily blocked the light.I risked a peek, then sat bolt upright and screamed.The figure came swiftly in and knelt by my pallet.Don you be makin that noise, woman, Ishmael said.It aint but me.Right, I said.Cold sweat prickled on my jaws and I could feel my heart pounding like a triphammer.Knew it all the time.They had cut off the crocodiles head and sliced out the tongue and the floor of the mouth.He wore the huge, cold eyed thing like a hat, his eyes no more than a gleam in the depths beneath the portcullised teeth.The empty lower jaw sagged, fat jowled and grimly jovial, hiding the lower half of his face.The egungun, he didnt hurt you none?he asked.No, I said.Thanks to the men.Eryou wouldnt consider taking that off, would you?He ignored the request and sat back on his heels, evidently considering me.I couldnt see his face, but every line of his body expressed the most profound indecision.Why you bein here?he asked at last.For lack of any better idea, I told him.He didnt mean to bash me on the head, or he would have done it already, when I collapsed below the cane field.Ah, he said, when I had finished.The reptiles snout dipped slightly toward me as he thought.A drop of moisture fell from the valved nostril onto my bare hand, and I wiped it quickly on my skirt, shuddering.The missus not here tonight, he said, at last, as though wondering whether it was safe to trust me with the information.Yes, I know, I said.I gathered my feet under me, preparing to rise.Can youor one of the mentake me back to the big tree by the river?My husband will be looking for me, I added pointedly.Likely she be takin the boy with her, Ishmael went on, ignoring me.My heart had lifted when he had verified that Geilie was gone; now it fell, with a distinct thud in my chest.Shes taken Ian?Why?I couldnt see his face, but the eyes inside the crocodile mask shone with a gleam of something that was partly amusementbut only partly.Missus likes boys, he said, the malicious tone making his meaning quite clear.Does she, I said flatly.Do you know when shell be coming back?The long, toothy snout turned suddenly up, but before he could reply, I sensed someone standing behind me, and swung around on the pallet.I know you, she said, a small frown puckering the wide, smooth forehead as she looked down at me.Do I not?Weve met, I said, trying to swallow the heart that had leapt into my mouth in startlement.Howhow do you do, Miss Campbell?Better than when last seen, evidently, in spite of the fact that her neat wool challis gown had been replaced with a loose smock of coarse white cotton, sashed with a broad, raggedly torn strip of the same, stained dark blue with indigo.Both face and figure had grown more slender, though, and she had lost the pasty, sagging look of too many months spent indoors.I am well, I thank ye, maam, she said politely.The pale blue eyes had still that distant, unfocused look to them, and despite the new sun glow on her skin, it was clear that Miss Margaret Campbell was still not altogether in the here and now.This impression was borne out by the fact that she appeared not to have noticed Ishmaels unconventional attire.Or to have noticed Ishmael himself, for that matter.She went on looking at me, a vague interest passing across her snub features.It is most civil in ye to call upon me, maam, she said.Might I offer ye refreshment of some kind?A dish of tea, perhaps?We keep no claret, for my brother holds that strong spirits are a temptation to the lusts of the flesh.I daresay they are, I said, feeling that I could do with a brisk spot of temptation at the moment.Ishmael had risen, and now bowed deeply to Miss Campbell, the great head slipping precariously.You ready, bb?he asked softly.The fire is waiting.Fire, she said.Yes, of course, and turned to me.Will ye not join me, Mrs.Malcolm?she asked graciously.Tea will be served shortly.I do so enjoy looking into a nice fire, she confided, taking my arm as I rose.Do you not find yourself sometimes imagining that you see things in the flames?Now and again, I said.I glanced at Ishmael, who was standing in the doorway.His indecision was apparent in his stance, but as Miss Campbell moved inexorably toward him, towing me after her, he shrugged very slightly, and stepped aside.Outside, a small bonfire burned brightly in the center of the clearing before the row of huts.The crocodile had already been skinned; the raw hide was stretched on a frame near one of the huts, throwing a headless shadow on the wooden wall.Several sharpened sticks were thrust into the ground around the fire, each strung with chunks of meat, sizzling with an appetizing smell that nonetheless made my stomach clench.Perhaps three dozen people, men, women and children, were gathered near the fire, laughing and talking.One man was still singing softly, curled over a battered guitar.As we appeared, one man caught sight of us, and turned sharply, saying something that sounded like Hau!At once, the talk and laughter stopped, and a respectful silence fell upon the crowd.Ishmael walked slowly toward them, the crocodiles head grinning in apparent delight.The firelight shone off faces and bodies like polished jet and melted caramel, all with deep black eyes that watched us come.There was a small bench near the fire, set on a sort of dais made of stacked planks.This was evidently the seat of honor, for Miss Campbell made for it directly, and gestured politely for me to sit down next to her.I could feel the weight of eyes upon me, with expressions ranging from hostility to guarded curiosity, but most of the attention was for Miss Campbell.Glancing covertly around the circle of faces, I was struck by their strangeness.These were the faces of Africa, and alien to me; not faces like Joes, that bore only the faint stamp of his ancestors, diluted by centuries of European blood.Black or not, Joe Abernathy was a great deal more like me than like these peopledifferent to the marrow of their bones.The man with the guitar had put it aside, and drawn out a small drum that he set between his knees.The sides were covered with the hide of some spotted animal; goat, perhaps.He began to tap it softly with the palms of his hands, in a half halting rhythm like the beating of a heart.I glanced at Miss Campbell, sitting tranquil beside me, hands carefully folded in her lap.She was gazing straight ahead, into the leaping flames, with a small, dreaming smile on her lips.The swaying crowd of slaves parted, and two little girls came out, carrying a large basket between them.The handle of the basket was twined with white roses, and the lid jerked up and down, agitated by the movements of something inside.The girls set the basket at Ishmaels feet, casting awed glances up at his grotesque headdress.He rested a hand on each of their heads, murmured a few words, and then dismissed them, his upraised palms a startling flash of yellow pink, like butterflies rising from the girls knotted hair.The attitude of the spectators had so far been quiet and respectful.It continued so, but now they crowded closer, necks craning to see what would happen next, and the drum began to beat faster, still softly.One of the women was holding a stone bottle, she took one step forward, handed it to Ishmael, and melted back into the crowd.Ishmael took up the bottle of liquor and poured a small amount on the ground, moving carefully in a circle around the basket.The basket, momentarily quiescent, heaved to and fro, evidently disturbed by the movement or the pungent scent of alcohol.A man holding a stick wrapped in rags stepped forward, and held the stick in the bonfire until the rags blazed up, bright red.At a word from Ishmael, he dipped his torch to the ground where the liquor had been poured.There was a collective Ah!from the watchers as a ring of flame sprang up, burned blue and died away at once, as quickly as it came.From the basket came a loud Cock a doodle dooo!Miss Campbell stirred beside me, eyeing the basket with suspicion.As though the crowing had been a signalperhaps it wasa flute began to play, and the humming of the crowd rose to a higher pitch.Ishmael came toward the makeshift dais where we sat, holding a red headrag between his hands.This he tied about Margarets wrist, placing her hand gently back in her lap when he had finished.Oh, there is my handkerchief!she exclaimed, and quite unselfconsciously raised her wrist and wiped her nose.No one but me seemed to notice.The attention was on Ishmael, who was standing before the crowd, speaking in a language I didnt recognize.The cock in the basket crowed again, and the white roses on the handle quivered violently with its struggles.I do wish it wouldnt do that, said Margaret Campbell, rather petulantly.If it does again, it will be three times, and thats bad luck, isnt it?Is it?Ishmael was now pouring the rest of the liquor in a circle round the dais.I hoped the flame wouldnt startle her.Oh, yes, Archie says so.Before the cock crows thrice, thou wilt betray me.Archie says women are always betrayers.Is that so, do you think?Depends on your point of view, I suppose, I murmured, watching the proceedings.Miss Campbell seemed oblivious to the swaying, humming slaves, the music, the twitching basket, and Ishmael, who was collecting small objects handed to him out of the crowd.Im hungry, she said.I do hope the tea will be ready soon.Ishmael heard this.To my amazement, he reached into one of the bags at his waist and unwrapped a small bundle, which proved to hold a cup of chipped and battered porcelain, the remnants of gold leaf still visible on the rim.This he placed ceremoniously on her lap.Oh, goody, Margaret said happily, clapping her hands together.Perhaps therell be biscuits.I rather thought not.Ishmael had placed the objects given him by the crowd along the edge of the dais.A few small bones, with lines carved across them, a spray of jasmine, and two or three crude little figures made of wood, each one wrapped in a scrap of cloth, with little shocks of hair glued to the head nubbins with clay.Ishmael spoke again, the torch dipped, and a sudden whiff of blue flame shot up around the dais.As it died away, leaving the scent of scorched earth and burnt brandy heavy in the cool night air, he opened the basket and brought out the cock.It was a large, healthy bird, black feathers glistening in the torchlight.It struggled madly, uttering piercing squawks, but it was firmly trussed, its feet wrapped in cloth to prevent scratching.Ishmael bowed low, saying something, and handed the bird to Margaret.Oh, thank you, she said graciously.The cock stretched out its neck, wattles bright red with agitation, and crowed piercingly.Margaret shook it.Naughty bird!she said crossly, and raising it to her mouth, bit it just behind the head.I heard the soft crack of the neck bones and the little grunt of effort as she flung her head up, wrenching off the head of the hapless cock.She clutched the gurgling, struggling trussed carcass tight against her bosom, crooning, Now, then, now, then, its all right, darling, as the blood spurted and sprayed into the teacup and all over her dress.The crowd had cried out at first, but now was quite still, watching.The flute, too, had fallen silent, but the drum beat on, sounding much louder than before.Margaret dropped the drained carcass carelessly to one side, where a boy darted out of the crowd to retrieve it.She brushed absently at the blood on her skirt, picking up the teacup with her red swathed hand.Guests first, she said politely.Will you have one lump, Mrs.Malcolm, or two?I was fortunately saved from answering by Ishmael, who thrust a crude horn cup into my hands, indicating that I should drink from it.Considering the alternative, I raised it to my mouth without hesitation.It was fresh distilled rum, sharp and raw enough to strip the throat, and I choked, wheezing.The tang of some herb rose up the back of my throat and into my nose; something had been mixed with the liquor, or soaked in it.It was faintly tart, but not unpleasant.Other cups like mine were making their way from hand to hand through the crowd.Ishmael made a sharp gesture, indicating that I should drink more.I obediently raised the cup to my lips, but let the fiery liquid lap against my mouth without swallowing.Whatever was happening here, I thought I might need such wits as I had.Beside me, Miss Campbell was drinking from her teetotal cup with genteel sips.The feeling of expectancy among the crowd was rising; they were swaying now, and a woman had begun to sing, low and husky, her voice an offbeat counterpoint to the thump of the drum.The shadow of Ishmaels headdress fell across my face, and I looked up.He too was swaying slowly, back and forth.The collarless white shirt he wore was speckled over the shoulders with black dots of blood, and stuck to his breast with sweat.I thought suddenly that the raw crocodiles head must weigh thirty pounds at least, a terrible weight to support; the muscles of his neck and shoulders were taut with effort.He raised his hands and began to sing as well.I felt a shiver run down my back and coil at the base of my spine, where my tail would have been.With his face masked, the voice could have been Joes; deep and honeyed, with a power that commanded attention.If I closed my eyes, it was Joe, with the light glinting off his spectacles, and catching the gold tooth far back as he smiled.Then I opened my eyes again, half shocked to see instead the crocodiles sinister yawn, and the fire gold green in the cold, cruel eyes.My mouth was dry and there was a faint buzzing in my ears, weaving around the strong, sweet words.He was getting attention, all right; the night by the fire was full of eyes, black wide and shiny, and small moans and shouts marked the pauses in the song.I closed my eyes and shook my head hard.I grabbed the edge of the wooden bench, clinging to its rough reality.I wasnt drunk, I knew; whatever herb had been mixed with the rum was potent.I could feel it creeping snakelike through my blood, and kept my eyes tight closed, fighting its progress.I couldnt block my ears, though, or the sound of that voice, rising and falling.I didnt know how much time had passed.I came back to myself with a start, suddenly aware that the drum and the singing had stopped.There was an absolute silence around the fire.I could hear the small rush of flame, and the rustle of cane leaves in the night wind; the quick darting scuttle of a rat in the palm frond roof of the hut behind me.The drug was still in my bloodstream, but the effects were dying; I could feel clarity coming back to my thoughts.Not so for the crowd; the eyes were fixed in a single, unblinking stare, like a wall of mirrors, and I thought suddenly of the voodoo legends of my timeof zombies and the houngans who made them.What had Geilie said?Every legend has one foot on the truth.Ishmael spoke.He had taken off the crocodiles head.It lay on the ground at our feet, eyes gone dark in the shadow.Ils sont arrives, Ishmael said quietly.They have come.He lifted his wet face, lined with exhaustion, and turned to the crowd.Who asks?As though in response, a young woman in a turban moved out of the crowd, still swaying, half dazed, and sank down on the ground before the dais.She put her hand on one of the carved images, a crude wooden icon in the shape of a pregnant woman.Her eyes looked up with hope, and while I didnt recognize the words she spoke, it was clear what she asked.Aya, gado.The voice spoke from beside me, but it wasnt Margaret Campbells.It was the voice of an old woman, cracked and high, but confident, answering in the affirmative.The young woman gasped with joy, and prostrated herself on the ground.Ishmael nudged her gently with a foot; she got up quickly and backed into the crowd, clutching the small image and bobbing her head, murmuring Mana, mana, over and over.Next was a young man, by his face the brother of the first young woman, who squatted respectfully upon his haunches, touching his head before he spoke.Grandmre, he began, in high, nasal French.Grandmother?I thought.He asked his question looking shyly down at the ground.Does the woman I love return my love?His was the jasmine spray; he held it so that it brushed the top of a bare, dusty foot.The woman beside me laughed, her ancient voice ironic but not unkind.Certainement, she answered.She returns it; and that of three other men, besides.Find another; less generous, but more worthy.The young man retired, crestfallen, to be replaced by an older man.This one spoke in an African language I did not know, a tone of bitterness in his voice as he touched one of the clay figures.Setato hoye, saidwho?The voice had changed.The voice of a man this time, full grown but not elderly, answering in the same language with an angry tone.I stole a look to the side, and despite the heat of the fire, felt the chill ripple up my forearms.It was Margarets face no longer.The outlines were the same, but the eyes were bright, alert and focused on the petitioner, the mouth set in grim command, and the pale throat swelled like a frogs with the effort of strong speech as whoever it was argued with the man.They are here, Ishmael had said.They, indeed.He stood to one side, silent but watchful, and I saw his eyes rest on me for a second before coming back to Margaret.Or whatever had been Margaret.They.One by one the people came forward, to kneel and ask.Some spoke in English, some French, or the slave patois, some in the African speech of their vanished homes.I couldnt understand all that was said, but when the questions were in French or English, they were often prefaced by a respectful Grandfather, or Grandmother, once by Aunt.Both the face and the voice of the oracle beside me changed, as they came to answer their call; male and female, mostly middle aged or old, their shadows dancing on her face with the flicker of the fire.Do you not sometimes imagine that you see things in the fire?The echo of her own small voice came back to me, thin and childish.Listening, I felt the hair rise on the back of my neck, and understood for the first time what had brought Ishmael back to this place, risking recapture and renewed slavery.Not friendship, not love, nor any loyalty to his fellow slaves, but power.What price is there for the power to tell the future?Any price, was the answer I saw, looking out at the rapt faces of the congregation.He had come back for Margaret.It went on for some time.I didnt know how long the drug would last, but I saw people here and there sink down to the ground, and nod to sleep; others melted silently back to the darkness of the huts, and after a time, we were almost alone.Only a few remained around the fire, all men.They were all husky and confident, and from their attitude, accustomed to command some respect, among slaves at least.They had hung back, together as a group, watching the proceedings, until at last one, clearly the leader, stepped forward.They be done, mon, he said to Ishmael, with a jerk of his head toward the sleeping forms around the fire.Now you ask.Ishmaels face showed nothing but a slight smile, yet he seemed suddenly nervous.Perhaps it was the closing in of the other men.There was nothing overtly menacing about them, but they seemed both serious and intentnot upon Margaret, for a change, but upon Ishmael.At last he nodded, and turned to face Margaret.During the hiatus, her face had gone blank; no one at home.Bouassa, he said to her.Come you, Bouassa.I shrank involuntarily away, as far as I could get on the bench without falling into the fire.Whoever Bouassa was, he had come promptly.I be hearin.It was a voice as deep as Ishmaels, and should have been as pleasant.It wasnt.One of the men took an involuntary step backward.Ishmael stood alone; the other men seemed to shrink away from him, as though he suffered some contamination.Tell me what I want to know, you Bouassa, he said.Margarets head tilted slightly, a light of amusement in the pale blue eyes.What you want to know?the deep voice said, with mild scorn.For why, mon?You be goin, I tell you anything or not.The small smile on Ishmaels face echoed that on Bouassas.You say true, he said softly.But these He jerked his head toward his companions, not taking his eyes from the face.They be goin with me?Might as well, the deep voice said.It chuckled, rather unpleasantly.The Maggot dies in three days.Wont be nothin for them here.That all you be wantin with me?Not waiting for an answer, Bouassa yawned widely, and a loud belch erupted from Margarets dainty mouth.Her mouth closed, and her eyes resumed their vacant stare, but the men werent noticing.An excited chatter erupted from them, to be hushed by Ishmael, with a significant glance at me.Abruptly quiet, they moved away, still muttering, glancing at me as they went.Ishmael closed his eyes as the last man left the clearing, and his shoulders sagged.I felt a trifle drained myself.What I began, and then stopped.Across the fire, a man had stepped from the shelter of the sugarcane.Jamie, tall as the cane itself, with the dying fire staining shirt and face as red as his hair.He raised a finger to his lips, and I nodded.I gathered my feet cautiously beneath me, picking up my stained skirt in one hand.I could be up, past the fire, and into the cane with him before Ishmael could reach me.But Margaret?I hesitated, turned to look at her, and saw that her face had come alive once again.It was lifted, eager, lips parted and shining eyes narrowed so that they seemed slightly slanted, as she stared across the fire.Daddy?said Briannas voice beside me.The hairs rippled softly erect on my forearms.It was Briannas voice, Briannas face, blue eyes dark and slanting with eagerness.Bree?I whispered, and the face turned to me.Mama, said my daughters voice, from the throat of the oracle.Brianna, said Jamie, and she turned her head sharply to look at him.Daddy, she said, with great certainty.I knew it was you.Ive been dreaming about you.Jamies face was white with shock.I saw his lips form the word Jesus, without sound, and his hand moved instinctively to cross himself.Dont let Mama go alone, said the voice with great certainty.You go with her.Ill keep you safe.There was no sound save the crackling of the fire.Ishmael stood transfixed, staring at the woman beside me.Then she spoke again, in Briannas soft, husky tones.I love you, Daddy.You too, Mama.She leaned toward me, and I smelled the fresh blood.Then her lips touched mine, and I screamed.I was not conscious of leaping to my feet, or of crossing the clearing.All I knew was that I was clinging to Jamie, my face buried in the cloth of his coat, shaking.His heart was pounding under my cheek, and I thought that he was shaking, too.I felt his hand trace the sign of the cross upon my back, and his arm lock tight about my shoulders.Its all right, he said, and I could feel his ribs swell and brace with the effort of keeping his voice steady.Shes gone.I didnt want to look, but forced myself to turn my head toward the fire.It was a peaceful scene.Margaret Campbell sat quietly on her bench, humming to herself, twiddling a long black tailfeather upon her knee.Ishmael stood behind her, one hand smoothing her hair in what looked like tenderness.He murmured something to her in a low, liquid tonguea questionand she smiled placidly.Oh, Im not a scrap tired!she assured him, turning to look fondly up into the scarred face that hovered in the darkness above her.Such a nice party, wasnt it?Yes, bb, he said gently.But you rest now, eh?He turned and clicked his tongue loudly.Suddenly two of the turbaned women materialized out of the night; they must have been waiting, just within call.Ishmael said something to them, and they came at once to tend Margaret, lifting her to her feet and leading her away between them, murmuring soft endearments in African and French.Ishmael remained, watching us across the fire.He was still as one of Geilies idols, carved out of night.I did not come alone, Jamie said.He gestured casually over his shoulder toward the cane field behind him, implying armed regiments.Oh, you be alone, mon, Ishmael said, with a slight smile.No matter.The loa speak to you; you be safe from me.He glanced back and forth between us, appraising.Huh, he said, in a tone of interest.Never did hear a loa speak to buckra.He shook his head then, dismissing the matter.You be going now, he said, quietly but with considerable authority.Not yet.Jamies arm dropped from my shoulder, and he straightened up beside me.I have come for the boy Ian; I will not go without him.Ishmaels brows went up, compressing the three vertical scars between them.Huh, he said again.You forget that boy; he be gone.Gone where?Jamie asked sharply.The narrow head tilted to one side, as Ishmael looked him over carefully.Gone with the Maggot, mon, he said.And where she go, you don be going.That boy gone, mon, he said again, with finality.You leave too, you a wise man.He paused, listening.A drum was talking, somewhere far away, the pulse of it little more than a disturbance of the night air.The rest be comin soon, he remarked.You safe from me, mon, not from them.Who are the rest?I asked.The terror of the encounter with the loa was ebbing, and I was able to talk once more, though my spine still rippled with fear of the dark cane field at my back.Maroons, I expect, Jamie said.He raised a brow at Ishmael.Or ye will be?The priest nodded, one formal bob of the head.That be true, he said.You hear Bouassa speak?His loa bless us, we go.He gestured toward the huts and the dark hills behind them.The drum callin them down from the hills, those strong enough to go.He turned away, the conversation obviously at an end.Wait!Jamie said.Tell us where she has goneMrs.Abernathy and the boy!Ishmael turned back, shoulders mantled in the crocodiles blood.To Abandawe, he said.And wheres that?Jamie demanded impatiently.I put a hand on his arm.I know where it is, I said, and Ishmaels eyes widened in astonishment.At leastI know its on Hispaniola.Lawrence told me.That was what Geilie wanted from himto find out where it was.What is it?A town, a village?Where?I could feel Jamies arm tense under my hand, vibrating with the urgency to be gone.Its a cave, I said, feeling cold in spite of the balmy air and the nearness of the fire.An old cave.Abandawe a magic place, Ishmael put in, deep voice soft, as though he feared to speak of it out loud.He looked at me hard, reassessing.Clotilda say the Maggot take you to the room upstairs.You maybe be knowin what she do there?A little.My mouth felt dry.I remembered Geilies hands, soft and plump and white, laying out the gems in their patterns, talking lightly of blood.As though he caught the echo of this thought, Ishmael took a sudden step toward me.I ask you, womanyou still bleed?Jamie jerked under my hand, but I squeezed his arm to be still.Yes, I said.Why?What has that to do with it?The oniseegun was plainly uneasy; he glanced from me back toward the huts.A stir was perceptible in the dark behind him; many bodies were moving to and fro, with a mutter of voices like the whisper of the cane fields.They were getting ready to go.A woman bleeds, she kill magic.You bleed, got your woman power, the magic dont work for you.It the old women do magic; witch someone, call the loas, make sick, make well.He gave me a long, appraising look, and shook his head.You ain gone do the magic, what the Maggot do.That magic kill her, sure, but it kill you, too.He gestured behind him, toward the empty bench.You hear Bouassa speak?He say the Maggot die, three days.She taken the boy, he die.You go follow them, mon, you die, too, sure.He stared at Jamie, and raised his hands in front of him, wrists crossed as though bound together.I tell you, amiki, he said.He let his hands fall, jerking them apart, breaking the invisible bond.He turned abruptly, and vanished into the darkness, where the shuffle of feet was growing louder, punctuated with bumps as heavy objects were shifted.Holy Michael defend us, muttered Jamie.He ran a hand hard through his hair, making fiery wisps stand out in the flickering light.The fire was dying fast, with no one left to tend it.Dye ken this place, Sassenach?Where Geillis has gone wi Ian?No, all I know is that its somewhere up in the far hills on Hispaniola, and that a stream runs through it.Then we must take Stern, he said with decision.Come on; the lads are by the river wi the boat.I turned to follow him, but paused on the edge of the cane field to look back.Jamie!Look!Behind us lay the embers of the egunguns fire, and the shadowy ring of slave huts.Farther away, the bulk of Rose Hall made a light patch against the hillside.But farther still, beyond the shoulder of the hill, the sky glowed faintly red.That will be Howes place, burning, he said.He sounded oddly calm, without emotion.He pointed to the left, toward the flank of the mountain, where a small orange dot glowed, no more at this distance than a pinprick of light.And that will be Twelvetrees, I expect.The drum voice whispered through the night, up and down the river.What had Ishmael said?The drum callin them down from the hillsthose strong enough to go.A small line of slaves was coming down from the huts, women carrying babies and bundles, cooking pots slung over their shoulders, heads turbaned in white.Next to one young woman, who held her arm with careful respect, walked Margaret Campbell, likewise turbaned.Jamie saw her, and stepped forward.Miss Campbell!he said sharply.Margaret!Margaret and her attendant stopped; the young woman moved as though to step between her charge and Jamie, but he held up both hands as he came, to show he meant no harm, and she reluctantly stepped back.Margaret, he said.Margaret, do ye not know me?She stared vacantly at him.Very slowly, he touched her, holding her face between his hands.Margaret, he said to her, low voiced, urgent.Margaret, hear me!Dye ken me, Margaret?She blinked once, then twice, and the smooth round face melted and thawed into life.It was not like the sudden possession of the loas; this was a slow, tentative coming, of something shy and fearful.Aye, I ken ye, Jamie, she said at last.Her voice was rich and pure, a young girls voice.Her lips curled up, and her eyes came alive once more, her face still held in the hollow of his hands.Its been lang since I saw ye, Jamie, she said, looking up into his eyes.Will ye have word of Ewan, then?Is he well?He stood very still for a minute, his face that careful blank mask that hid strong feeling.He is well, he whispered at last.Verra well, Margaret.He gave me this, to keep until I saw ye.He bent his head and kissed her gently.Several of the women had stopped, standing silently by to watch.At this, they moved and began to murmur, glancing uneasily at each other.When he released Margaret Campbell and stepped back, they closed in around her, protective and wary, nodding him back.Margaret seemed oblivious; her eyes were still on Jamies face, the smile on her lips.I thank ye, Jamie!she called, as her attendant took her arm and began to urge her away.Tell Ewan Ill be with him soon!The little band of white clothed women moved away, disappearing like ghosts into the darkness by the cane field.Jamie made an impulsive move in their direction, but I stopped him with a hand on his arm.Let her go, I whispered, mindful of what lay on the floor in the salon of the plantation house.Jamie, let her go.You cant stop her; shes better with them.He closed his eyes briefly, then nodded.Aye, youre right.He turned, then stopped suddenly, and I whirled about to see what he had seen.There were lights in Rose Hall now.Torchlight, flickering behind the windows, upstairs and down.As we watched, a surly glow began to swell in the windows of the secret workroom on the second floor.Its past time to go, Jamie said.He seized my hand and we went quickly, diving into the dark rustle of the canes, fleeing through air suddenly thick with the smell of burning sugar.62  ABANDAWE  You can take the Governors pinnace; thats small, but its seaworthy.Grey fumbled through the drawer of his desk.Ill write an order for the dockers to hand it over to you.Aye, well need the boatI canna risk the Artemis; as shes Jaredsbut I think wed best steal it, John.Jamies brows were drawn together in a frown.I wouldna have ye be involved wi me in any visible way, aye?Youll be having trouble enough with things, without that.Grey smiled unhappily.Trouble?Yes, you might call it trouble, with four plantation houses burnt, and over two hundred slaves goneGod knows where!But I vastly doubt that anyone will take notice of my social acquaintance, under the circumstances.Between fear of the Maroons and fear of the Chinaman, the whole island is in such a panic that a mere smuggler is the most negligible of trivialities.Its a great relief to me to be thought trivial, Jamie said, very dryly.Still, well steal the boat.And if were taken, yeve never heard my name or seen my face, aye?Grey stared at him, a welter of emotions fighting for mastery of his features, amusement, fear, and anger among them.Is that right?he said at last.Let you be taken, watch them hang you, and keep quiet about itfor fear of smirching my reputation?For Gods sake, Jamie, what do you take me for?Jamies mouth twitched slightly.For a friend, John, he said.And if Ill take your friendshipand your damned boat!then youll take mine, and keep quiet.Aye?The Governor glared at him for a moment, lips pressed tight, but then his shoulders sagged in defeat.I will, he said shortly.But I should regard it as a great personal favor if you would endeavor not to be captured.Jamie rubbed a knuckle across his mouth, hiding a smile.Ill try verra hard, John.The Governor sat down, wearily.There were deep circles under his eyes, and his impeccable linen was wilted; obviously he had not changed his clothes from the day before.All right.I dont know where youre going, and its likely better I dont.But if you can, keep out of the sealanes north of Antigua.I sent a boat this morning, to ask for as many men as the barracks there can supply, marines and sailors both.Theyll be heading this way by the day after tomorrow at the latest, to guard the town and harbor against the escaped Maroons in case of an outright rebellion.I caught Jamies eye, and raised one brow in question, but he shook his head, almost imperceptibly.We had told the Governor of the uprising on the Yallahs River, and the escape of the slavessomething he had heard about from other sources, anyway.We had not told him what we had seen later that night, lying to under cover of a tiny cove, sails taken down to hide their whiteness.The river was dark as onyx, but with a fugitive gleam from the broad expanse of water.We had heard them coming, and had time to hide before the ship came down upon us; the beating of drums and a savage exultation of many voices echoing through the river valley as the Bruja sailed past us, carried by the downward current.The bodies of the pirates no doubt lay somewhere upriver, left to rot peacefully among the frangipani and cedar.The escaped slaves of the Yallahs River had not gone into the mountains of Jamaica, but out to sea, presumably to join Bouassas followers on Hispaniola.The townsfolk of Kingston had nothing to fear from the escaped slavesbut it was a good deal better that the Royal Navy should concentrate their attention here than on Hispaniola, where we were bound.Jamie rose to take our leave, but Grey stopped him.Wait.Will you not require a safe place for yourfor Mrs.Fraser?He didnt look at me, but at Jamie, eyes steady.I should be honored if you would entrust her to my protection.She could stay here, in the Residence, until you return.No one would trouble heror even need to know she was here.Jamie hesitated, but there was no gentle way to phrase it.She must go with me, John, he said.There is no choice about it; she must.Greys glance flickered to me, then away, but not before I had seen the look of jealousy in his eyes.I felt sorry for him, but there was nothing I could say; no way to tell him the truth.Yes, he said, and swallowed noticeably.I see.Quite.Jamie held out a hand to him.He hesitated for a moment, but then took it.Good luck, Jamie, he said, voice a little husky.God go with you.Fergus had been somewhat more difficult to deal with.He had insisted absolutely on accompanying us, offering argument after argument, and arguing the more vehemently when he found that the Scottish smugglers would sail with us.You take them, but you will go without me?Ferguss face was alive with indignation.I will, Jamie said firmly.The smugglers are widowers or bachelors, all, but youre a marrit man.He glanced pointedly at Marsali, who stood watching the discussion, her face drawn with anxiety.I thought she was oweryoung to be wed, and I was wrong; but I know shes oweryoung to be widowed.Youll stay.And he turned aside, the matter settled.It was full dark when we set sail in Greys pinnace, a thirty foot, single decked sloop, leaving two docksmen bound and gagged in the boathouse behind us.It was a small, single masted ship, bigger than the fishing boat in which we had traveled up the Yallahs River, but barely large enough to qualify for the designation ship.Nonetheless, she seemed seaworthy enough, and we were soon out of Kingston Harbor, heeling over in a brisk evening breeze, on our way toward Hispaniola.The smugglers handled the sailing among them, leaving Jamie, Lawrence and I to sit on one of the long benches along the rail.We chatted desultorily of this and that, but after a time, fell silent, absorbed in our own thoughts.Jamie yawned repeatedly, and finally, at my urging, consented to lie down upon the bench, his head resting in my lap.I was myself strung too tightly to want to sleep.Lawrence too was wakeful, staring upward into the sky, hands folded behind his head.There is moisture in the air tonight, he said, nodding upward toward the silver sliver of the crescent moon.See the haze about the moon?It may rain before dawn; unusual for this time of year.Talk about the weather seemed sufficiently boring to soothe my jangled nerves.I stroked Jamies hair, thick and soft under my hand.Is that so?I said.You and Jamie both seem able to read the weather from the sky.All I know is the old bit about Red sky at night, sailors delight; red sky at morning, sailor take warning.I didnt notice what color the sky was tonight, did you?Lawrence laughed comfortably.Rather a light purple, he said.I cannot say whether it will be red in the morning, but it is surprising how frequently such signs are reliable.But of course there is a scientific principle involvedthe refraction of light from the moisture in the air, just as I observed presently of the moon.I lifted my chin, enjoying the breeze that lifted the heavy hair that fell on my neck.But what about odd phenomena?Supernatural things?I asked him.What about things where the rules of science seem not to apply?I am a scientist, I heard him say in memory, his slight accent seeming only to reinforce his matter of factness.I dont believe in ghosts.Such as what, these phenomena?Well I groped for a moment, then fell back on Geilies own examples.People who have bleeding stigmata, for example?Astral travel?Visions, supernatural manifestationsodd things, that cant be explained rationally.Lawrence grunted, and settled his bulk more comfortably on the bench beside me.Well, I say it is the place of science only to observe, he said.To seek cause where it may be found, but to realize that there are many things in the world for which no cause shall be found; not because it does not exist, but because we know too little to find it.It is not the place of science to insist on explanationbut only to observe, in hopes that the explanation will manifest itself.That may be science, but it isnt human nature, I objected.People go on wanting explanations.They do.He was becoming interested in the discussion; he leaned back, folding his hands across his slight paunch, in a lecturers attitude.It is for this reason that a scientist constructs hypothesessuggestions for the cause of an observation.But a hypothesis must never be confused with an explanationwith proof.I have seen a great many things which might be described as peculiar.Fish falls, for instance, where a great many fishall of the same species, mind you, all the same sizefall suddenly from a clear sky, over dry land.There would appear to be no rational cause for thisand yet, is it therefore suitable to attribute the phenomenon to supernatural interference?On the face of it, does it seem more likely that some celestial intelligence should amuse itself by flinging shoals of fish at us from the sky, or that there is some meteorological phenomenona waterspout, a tornado, something of the kind?that while not visible to us, is still in operation?And yethis voice became more pensivewhyand how!might a natural phenomenon such as a waterspout remove the headsand only the headsof all the fish?Have you seen such a thing yourself?I asked, interested, and he laughed.There speaks a scientific mind!he said, chuckling.The first thing a scientist askshow do you know?Who has seen it?Can I see it myself?Yes, I have seen such a thingthree times, in fact, though in one case the precipitation was of frogs, rather than fish.Were you near a seashore or a lake?Once near a shore, once near a lakethat was the frogsbut the third time, it took place far inland; some twenty miles from the nearest body of water.And yet the fish were of a kind I have seen only in the deep ocean.In none of the cases did I see any sort of disturbance of the upper airno clouds, no great wind, none of the fabled spouts of water that rise from the sea into the sky, assuredly.And yet the fish fell; so much is a fact, for I have seen them.And it isnt a fact if you havent seen it?I asked dryly.He laughed in delight, and Jamie stirred, murmuring against my thigh.I smoothed his hair, and he relaxed into sleep again.It may be so; it may not.But a scientist could not say, could he?What is it the Christian Bible saysBlest are they who have not seen, but have believed?Thats what it says, yes.Some things must be accepted as fact without provable cause.He laughed again, this time without much humor.As a scientist who is also a Jew, I have perhaps a different perspective on such phenomena as stigmataand the idea of resurrection of the dead, which a very great proportion of the civilized world accepts as fact beyond question.And yet, this skeptical view is not one I could even breathe, to anyone save yourself, without grave danger of personal harm.Doubting Thomas was a Jew, after all, I said, smiling.To begin with.Yes; and only when he ceased to doubt, did he become a Christianand a martyr.One could argue that it was surety that killed him, no?His voice was heavy with irony.There is a great difference between those phenomena which are accepted on faith, and those which are proved by objective determination, though the cause of both may be equally rational once known.And the chief difference is this: that people will treat with disdain such phenomena as are proved by the evidence of the senses, and commonly experiencedwhile they will defend to the death the reality of a phenomenon which they have neither seen nor experienced.Faith is as powerful a force as science, he concluded, voice soft in the darkness, but far more dangerous.We sat quietly for a time, looking over the bow of the tiny ship, toward the thin slice of darkness that divided the night, darker than the purple glow of the sky, or the silver gray sea.The black island of Hispaniola, drawing inexorably closer.Where did you see the headless fish?I asked suddenly, and was not surprised to see the faint inclination of his head toward the bow.There, he said.I have seen a good many odd things among these islandsbut perhaps more there than anywhere else.Some places are like that.I didnt speak for several minutes, pondering what might lie aheadand hoping that Ishmael had been right in saying that it was Ian whom Geillis had taken with her to Abandawe.A thought occurred to meone that had been lost or pushed aside during the events of the last twenty four hours.Lawrencethe other Scottish boys.Ishmael told us he saw twelve of them, including Ian.When you were searching the plantationdid you find any trace of the others?He drew in his breath sharply, but did not answer at once.I could feel him, turning over words in his mind, trying to decide how to say what the chill in my bones had already told me.The answer, when it came, was not from Lawrence, but from Jamie.We found them, he said softly, from the darkness.His hand rested on my knee, and squeezed gently.Dinna ask more, Sassenachfor I willna tell ye.I understood.Ishmael had to have been right; it must be Ian with Geilie, for Jamie could bear no other possibility.I laid a hand on his head, and he stirred slightly, turning so that his breath touched my hand.Blest are they who have not seen, I whispered under my breath, but have believed.We dropped anchor near dawn, in a small, nameless bay on the northern coast of Hispaniola.There was a narrow beach, faced with cliffs, and through a split in the rock, a narrow, sandy trail was visible, leading into the interior of the island.Jamie carried me the few steps to shore, set me down, and then turned to Innes, who had splashed ashore with one of the parcels of food.I thank ye, a charaid, he said formally.We shall part here; with the Virgins blessing, we will meet here again in four days time.Inness narrow face contracted in surprised disappointment; then resignation settled on his features.Aye, he said.Ill mind the boatie then, til ye all come back.Jamie saw the expression, and shook his head, smiling.Not just you, man; did I need a strong arm, it would be yours I should call on first.No, all of ye shall stay, save my wife and the Jew.Resignation was replaced by sheer surprise.Stay here?All of us?But will ye not have need of us, Mac Dubh?He squinted anxiously at the cliffs, with their burden of flowering vines.It looks a fearsome place to venture into, without friends.I shall count it the act of greatest friendship for ye to wait here, as I say, Duncan, Jamie said, and I realized with a slight shock that I had never known Inness given name.Innes glanced again at the cliffs, his lean face troubled, then bent his head in acquiescence.Well, its you as shall say, Mac Dubh.But ye ken we are willingall of us.Jamie nodded, his face turned away.Aye, I ken that fine, Duncan, he said softly.Then he turned back, held out an arm, and Innes embraced him, his one arm awkwardly thumping Jamies back.If a ship should come, Jamie said, letting go, then I wish ye to take heed for yourselves.The Royal Navy will be looking for that pinnace, aye?I doubt they shall come here, looking, but if they shouldor if anything else at all should threaten yethen leave.Sail away at once.And leave ye here?Nay, ye can order me to do a great many things, Mac Dubh, and do them I shallbut not that.Jamie frowned and shook his head; the rising sun struck sparks from his hair and the stubble of his beard, wreathing his head in fire.It will do me and my wife no good to have ye killed, Duncan.Mind what I say.If a ship comesgo.He turned aside then, and went to take leave of the other Scots.Innes sighed deeply, his face etched with disapproval, but he made no further protest.It was hot and damp in the jungle, and there was little talk among the three of us as we made our way inland.There was nothing to say, after all; Jamie and I could not speak of Brianna before Lawrence, and there were no plans to be made until we reached Abandawe, and saw what was there.I dozed fitfully at night, waking several times to see Jamie, back against a tree near me, eyes fixed sightless on the fire.At noon of the second day, we reached the place.A steep and rocky hillside of gray limestone rose before us, sprouted over with spiky aloes and a ruffle of coarse grass.And on the crest of the hill, I could see them.Great standing stones, megaliths, in a rough circle about the crown of the hill.You didnt say there was a stone circle, I said.I felt faint, and not only from the heat and damp.Are you quite well, Mrs.Fraser?Lawrence peered at me in some alarm, his genial face flushed beneath its tan.Yes, I said, but my face must as usual have given me away, for Jamie was there in a moment, taking my arm and steadying me with a hand about my waist.For Gods sake, be careful, Sassenach!he muttered.Dinna go near those things!We have to know if Geilies there, with Ian, I said.Come on.I forced my reluctant feet into motion, and he came with me, still muttering under his breath in GaelicI thought it was a prayer.They were put up a very long time ago, Lawrence said, as we came up onto the crest of the hill, within a few feet of the stones.Not by slavesby the aboriginal inhabitants of the islands.The circle was empty, and innocent looking.No more than a staggered circle of large stones, set on end, motionless under the sun.Jamie was watching my face anxiously.Can ye hear them, Claire?he said.Lawrence looked startled, but said nothing as I advanced carefully toward the nearest stone.I dont know, I said.It isnt one of the proper daysnot a Sun Feast, or a Fire Feast, I mean.It may not be open now; I dont know.Holding tightly to Jamies hand, I edged forward, listening.There seemed a faint hum in the air, but it might be no more than the usual sound of the jungle insects.Very gently, I laid the palm of my hand against the nearest stone.I was dimly conscious of Jamie calling my name.Somewhere, my mind was struggling on a physical level, making the conscious effort to lift and lower my diaphragm, to squeeze and release the chambers of my heart.My ears were filled with a pulsating hum, a vibration too deep for sound, that throbbed in the marrow of my bones.And in some small, still place in the center of the chaos was Geilie Duncan, green eyes smiling into mine.Claire!I was lying on the ground, Jamie and Lawrence bending over me, faces dark and anxious against the sky.There was dampness on my cheeks, and a trickle of water ran down my neck.I blinked, cautiously moving my extremities, to be sure I still possessed them.Jamie put down the handkerchief with which he had been bathing my face, and lifted me to a sitting position.Are ye all right, Sassenach?Yes, I said, still mildly confused.Jamieshes here!Who?Mrs.Abernathy?Lawrences heavy eyebrows shot up, and he glanced hastily behind him, as though expecting her to materialize on the spot.I heard hersaw herwhatever.My wits were coming slowly back.Shes here.Not in the circle; close by.Can ye tell where?Jamies hand was resting on his dirk, as he darted quick glances all around us.I shook my head, and closed my eyes, tryingreluctantlyto recapture that moment of seeing.There was an impression of darkness, of damp coolness, and the flicker of red torchlight.I think shes in a cave, I said, amazed.Is it close by, Lawrence?It is, he said, watching my face with intense curiosity.The entrance is not far from here.Take us there.Jamie was on his feet, lifting me to mine.Jamie.I stopped him with a hand on his arm.Aye?Jamieshe knows Im here, too.That stopped him, all right.He paused, and I saw him swallow.Then his jaw tightened, and he nodded.A Mhcheal bheannaichte, don sinn bho dheamhainnean, he said softly, and turned toward the edge of the hill.Blessed Michael, defend us from demons.The blackness was absolute.I brought my hand to my face; felt my palm brush my nose; but saw nothing.It wasnt an empty blackness, though.The floor of the passage was uneven, with small sharp particles that crunched underfoot, and the walls in some places grew so close together that I wondered how Geilie had ever managed to squeeze through.Even in the places where the passage grew wider, and the stone walls were too far away for my outstretched hands to brush against, I could feel them.It was like being in a dark room with another personsomeone who kept quite silent, but whose presence I could feel, never more than an arms length away.Jamies hand was tight on my shoulder, and I could feel his presence behind me, a warm disturbance in the cool void of the cave.Are we headed right?he asked, when I stopped for a moment to catch my breath.There are passages to the sides; I feel them as we pass.How can ye tell where were going?I can hear.Hear them.It.Dont you hear?It was a struggle to speak, to form coherent thoughts.The call here was different; not the beehive sound of Craigh na Dun, but a hum like the vibration of the air following the striking of a great bell.I could feel it ringing in the long bones of my arms, echoing through pectoral girdle and spine.Jamie gripped my arm hard.Stay with me!he said.Sassenachdont let it take ye; stay!I reached blindly out and he caught me tight against his chest.The thump of his heart against my temple was louder than the hum.Jamie.Jamie, hold on to me.I had never been more frightened.Dont let me go.If it takes meJamie, I cant come back again.Its worse every time.It will kill me, Jamie!His arms tightened round me til I felt my ribs crack, and gasped for breath.After a moment, he let go, and putting me gently aside, moved past me into the passage, taking care to keep his hand always on me.Ill go first, he said.Put your hand in my belt, and dinna let go for anything.Linked together, we moved slowly down, farther into the dark.Lawrence had wanted to come, but Jamie would not let him.We had left him at the mouth of the cave, waiting.If we should not return, he was to go back to the beach, to keep the rendezvous with Innes and the other Scots.If we should not return  He must have felt my grip tighten, for he stopped, and drew me alongside him.Claire, he said softly.I must say something.I knew already, and groped for his mouth to stop him, but my hand brushed by his face in the dark.He gripped my wrist, and held tight.If it will be a choice between her and one of usthen it must be me.Ye know that, aye?I knew that.If Geilie should be there, still, and one of us might be killed in stopping her, it must be Jamie to take the risk.For with Jamie dead, I would be leftand I could follow her through the stone, which he could not.I know, I whispered at last.I knew also what he did not say, and what he knew as well; that should Geilie have gone through already, then I must go as well.Then kiss me, Claire, he whispered.And know that you are more to me than life, and I have no regret.I couldnt answer, but kissed him, first his hand, its crooked fingers warm and firm, and the brawny wrist of a sword wielder, and then his mouth, haven and promise and anguish all mingled, and the salt of tears in the taste of him.Then I let go, and turned toward the left hand tunnel.This way, I said.Within ten paces, I saw the light.It was no more than a faint glow on the rocks of the passage, but it was enough to restore the gift of sight.Suddenly, I could see my hands and feet, though dimly.My breath came out in something like a sob, of relief and fear.I felt like a ghost taking shape as I walked toward the light and the soft bell hum before me.The light was stronger, now, then dimmed again as Jamie slid in front of me, and his back blocked my view.Then he bent and stepped through a low archway.I followed, and stood up in light.It was a good sized chamber, the walls farthest from the torch still cold and black with the slumber of the cave.The wall before us had wakened, though.It flickered and gleamed, particles of embedded mineral reflecting the flames of a pine torch, fixed in a crevice.So ye came, did you?Geillis was on her knees, eyes fixed on a glittering stream of white powder that fell from her folded fist, drawing a line on the dark floor.I heard a small sound from Jamie, half relief, half horror, as he saw Ian.The boy lay in the middle of the pentacle on his side, hands bound behind him, gagged with a strip of white cloth.Next to him lay an ax.It was made of a shiny dark stone, like obsidian, with a sharp, chipped edge.The handle was covered with gaudy beadwork, in an African pattern of stripes and zigzags.Dont come any closer, fox.Geilie sat back on her heels, showing her teeth to Jamie in an expression that was not a smile.She held a pistol in one hand; its fellow, charged and cocked, was thrust through the leather belt she wore about her waist.Eyes fixed on Jamie, she reached into the pouch suspended from the belt and withdrew another handful of diamond dust.I could see beads of sweat standing on her broad white brow; the bell hum from the time passage must be reaching her as it reached me.I felt sick, and the sweat ran down my body in trickles under my clothes.The pattern was almost finished.With the pistol carefully trained, she dribbled out the thin, shining stream until she had completed the pentagram.The stones were already laid inside itthey glinted from the floor in sparks of color, connected by a gleaming line of poured quicksilver.There, then.She sat back on her heels with a sigh of relief, and wiped the thick, creamy hair back with one hand.Safe.The diamond dust keeps out the noise, she explained to me.Nasty, isnt it?She patted Ian, who lay bound and gagged on the ground in front of her, his eyes wide with fear above the white cloth of the gag.There, there, mo chridhe.Dinna fret, it will be soon over.Take your hand off him, ye wicked bitch!Jamie took an impulsive step forward, hand on his dirk, then stopped, as she lifted the barrel of the pistol an inch.Ye mind me o your uncle Dougal, a sionnach, she said, tilting her head to one side coquettishly.He was older when I met him than you are now, but youve the look of him about ye, aye?Like yed take what ye pleased and damn anyone who stands in your way.Jamie looked at Ian, curled on the floor, then up at Geilie.Ill take whats mine, he said softly.But ye cant, now, can ye?she said, pleasantly.One more step, and I kill ye dead.I spare ye now, only because Claire seems fond of ye.Her eyes shifted to me, standing in the shadows behind Jamie.She nodded to me.A life for a life, sweet Claire.Ye tried to save me once, on Craigh na Dun; I saved you from the witch trial at Cranesmuir.Were quits now, aye?Geilie picked up a small bottle, uncorked it, and poured the contents carefully over Ians clothes.The smell of brandy rose up, strong and heady, and the torch flared brighter as the fumes of alcohol reached it.Ian bucked and kicked, making a strained noise of protest, and she kicked him sharply in the ribs.Be still!she said.Dont do it, Geilie, I said, knowing that words would do no good.I have to, she said calmly.Im meant to.Im sorry I shall have to take the girl, but Ill leave ye the man.What girl?Jamies fists were clenched tight at his side, knuckles white even in the dim torchlight.Brianna?Thats the name, isnt it?She shook back her heavy hair, smoothing it out of her face.The last of Lovats line.She smiled at me.What luck ye should have come to see me, aye?Id never ha kent it, otherwise.I thought theyd all died out before 1900.A thrill of horror shot through me.I could feel the same tremor run through Jamie as his muscles tightened.It must have shown on his face.Geilie cried out sharply and leapt back.She fired as he lunged at her.His head snapped back, and his body twisted, hands still reaching for her throat.Then he fell, his body limp across the edge of the glittering pentagram.There was a strangled moan from Ian.I felt rather than heard a sound rise in my throat.I didnt know what I had said, but Geilie turned her face in my direction, startled.When Brianna was two, a car had carelessly sideswiped mine, hitting the back door next to where she was sitting.I slowed to a stop, checked briefly to see that she was unhurt, and then bounded out, headed for the other car, which had pulled over a little way ahead.The other driver was a man in his thirties, quite large, and probably entirely self assured in his dealings with the world.He looked over his shoulder, saw me coming, and hastily rolled up his window, shrinking back in his seat.I had no consciousness of rage or any other emotion; I simply knew, with no shadow of doubt, that I couldand wouldshatter the window with my hand, and drag the man out through it.He knew it, too.I thought no further than that, and didnt have to; the arrival of a police car had recalled me to my normal state of mind, and then I started to shake.But the memory of the look on that mans face stayed with me.Fire is a poor illuminator, but it would have taken total darkness to conceal that look on Geilies face; the sudden realization of what was coming toward her.She jerked the other pistol from her belt and swung it to bear on me; I saw the round hole of the muzzle clearlyand didnt care.The roar of the discharge caromed through the cave, the echoes sending down showers of rocks and dirt, but by then I had seized the ax from the floor.I noted quite clearly the leather binding, ornamented with a beaded pattern.It was red, with yellow zigzags and black dots.The dots echoed the shiny obsidian of the blade, and the red and yellow picked up the hues of the flaming torch behind her.I heard a noise behind me, but didnt turn.Reflections of the fire burned red in the pupils of her eyes.The red thing, Jamie had called it.I gave myself to it, he had said.I didnt need to give myself; it had taken me.There was no fear, no rage, no doubt.Only the stroke of the swinging ax.The shock of it echoed up my arm, and I let go, my fingers numbed.I stood quite still, not even moving when she staggered toward me.Blood in firelight is black, not red.She took one blind step forward and fell, all her muscles gone limp, making no attempt to save herself.The last I saw of her face was her eyes; set wide, beautiful as gemstones, a green water clear and faceted with the knowledge of death.Someone was speaking, but the words made no sense.The cleft in the rock buzzed loudly, filling my ears.The torch flickered, flaring sudden yellow in a draft; the beating of the dark angels wings, I thought.The sound came again, behind me.I turned and saw Jamie.He had risen to his knees, swaying.Blood was pouring from his scalp, dyeing one side of his face red black.The other side was white as a harlequins mask.Stop the bleeding, said some remnant of instinct in my brain, and I fumbled for a handkerchief.But by then he had crawled to where Ian lay, and was groping at the boys bonds, jerking loose the leather straps, drops of his blood pattering on the lads shirt.Ian squirmed to his feet, his face ghastly pale, and put out a hand to help his uncle.Then Jamies hand was on my arm.I looked up, numbly offering the cloth.He took it and wiped it roughly over his face, then jerked at my arm, pulling me toward the tunnel mouth.I stumbled and nearly fell, caught myself, and came back to the present.Come!he was saying.Can ye not hear the wind?There is a storm coming, above.Wind?I thought.In a cave?But he was right; the draft had not been my imagination; the faint exhalation from the crack near the entrance had changed to a steady, whining wind, almost a keening that rang in the narrow passage.I turned to look over my shoulder, but Jamie grasped my arm hard and pushed me forward.My last sight of the cave was a blurred impression of jet and rubies, with a still white shape in the middle of the floor.Then the draft came in with a roar, and the torch went out.Jesus!It was Young Ians voice, filled with terror, somewhere close by.Uncle Jamie!Here.Jamies voice came out of the darkness just in front of me, surprisingly calm, raised to be heard above the noise.Here, lad.Come here to me, Ian.Dinna be afraid; its only the cave breathing.It was the wrong thing to say.When he said it, I could feel the cold breath of the rock touch my neck, and the hairs there rose up prickling.The image of the cave as a living thing, breathing all around us, blind and malevolent, struck me cold with horror.Apparently the notion was as terrifying to Ian as it was to me, for I heard a faint gasp, and then his groping hand struck me and clung for dear life to my arm.I clutched his hand with one of mine and probed the dark ahead with the other, finding Jamies reassuringly large shape almost at once.Ive got Ian, I said.For Gods sake, lets get out of here!He gripped my hand in answer, and linked together, we began to make our way back down the winding tunnel, stumbling through the pitch dark and stepping on each others heels.And all the time, that ghostly wind whined at our backs.I could see nothing; no hint of Jamies shirt in front of my face, snowy white as I knew it to be, not even a flicker of the movement of my own light colored skirts, though I heard them swish about my feet as I walked, the sound blending with that of the wind.The thin rush of air rose and fell in pitch, whispering and wailing.I tried to force my mind away from the memory of what lay behind us, away from the morbid fancy that the wind held sighing voices, whispering secrets just past hearing.I can hear her, Ian said suddenly behind me.His voice rose, cracking with panic.I can hear her!God, oh God, shes coming!I froze in my tracks, a scream wedged in my throat.The cool observer in my head knew quite well it was not soonly the wind and Ians frightbut that made no difference to the spurt of sheer terror that rose from the pit of my stomach and turned my bowels to water.I knew she was coming, too, and screamed out loud.Then Jamie had me, and Ian too, gripped tight against him, one in each arm, our ears muffled against his chest.He smelled of pine smoke and sweat and brandy, and I nearly sobbed in relief at the closeness of him.Hush!he said fiercely.Hush, the both of ye!I willna let her touch ye.Never!He pressed us to him, hard; I felt his heart beating fast beneath my cheek and Ians bony shoulder, squeezed against mine, and then the pressure relaxed.Come along now, Jamie said, more quietly.Its but wind.Caves blow through their cracks when the weather changes aboveground.Ive heard it before.There is a storm coming, outside.Come, now.The storm was a brief one.By the time we had stumbled to the surface, blinking against the shock of sunlight, the rain had passed, leaving the world reborn in its wake.Lawrence was sheltering under a dripping palm near the caves entrance.When he saw us, he sprang to his feet, a look of relief relaxing the creases of his face.It is all right?he said, looking from me to a blood stained Jamie.Jamie gave him half a smile, nodding.It is all right, he said.He turned and motioned to Ian.May I present my nephew, Ian Murray?Ian, this is Dr.Stern, whos been of great assistance to us in looking for ye.Im much obliged to ye, Doctor, Ian said, with a bob of his head.He wiped a sleeve across his streaked face, and glanced at Jamie.I knew yed come, Uncle Jamie, he said, with a tremulous smile, but ye left it a bit late, aye?The smile widened, then broke, and he began to tremble.He blinked hard, fighting back tears.I did then, and Im sorry, Ian.Come here, a bhalaich.Jamie reached out and took him in a close embrace, patting his back and murmuring to him in Gaelic.I watched for a moment, before I realized that Lawrence was speaking to me.Are you quite well, Mrs.Fraser?he was asking.Without waiting for an answer, he took my arm.I dont quite know.I felt completely empty.Exhausted as though by childbirth, but without the exultation of spirit.Nothing seemed quite real; Jamie, Ian, Lawrence, all seemed like toy figures that moved and talked at a distance, making noises that I had to strain to understand.I think perhaps we should leave this place, Lawrence said, with a glance at the cave mouth from which we had just emerged.He looked slightly uneasy.He didnt ask about Mrs.Abernathy.I think you are right.The picture of the cave we had left was vivid in my mindbut just as unreal as the vivid green jungle and gray stones around us.Not waiting for the men to follow, I turned and walked away.The feeling of remoteness increased as we walked.I felt like an automaton, built around an iron core, walking by clockwork.I followed Jamies broad back through branches and clearings, shadow and sun, not noticing where we were going.Sweat ran down my sides and into my eyes, but I barely stirred to wipe it away.At length, toward sunset, we stopped in a small clearing near a stream, and made our primitive camp.I had already discovered that Lawrence was a most useful person to have along on a camping trip.He was not only as good at finding or building shelter as was Jamie, but was sufficiently familiar with the flora and fauna of the area to be able to plunge into the jungle and return within half an hour bearing handfuls of edible roots, fungi, and fruit with which to augment the Spartan rations in our packs.Ian was set to gather firewood while Lawrence foraged, and I sat Jamie down with a pan of water, to tend the damage to his head.I washed away the blood from face and hair, to find to my surprise that the ball had in fact not plowed a furrow through his scalp as I had thought.Instead, it had pierced the skin just above his hairline andevidentlyvanished into his head.There was no sign of an exit wound.Unnerved by this, I prodded his scalp with increasing agitation, until a sudden cry from the patient announced that I had discovered the bullet.There was a large, tender lump on the back of his head.The pistol ball had traveled under the skin, skimming the curve of his skull, and come to rest just over his occiput.Jesus H.  Christ!I exclaimed.I felt it again, unbelieving, but there it was.You always said your head was solid bone, and Ill be damned if you werent right.She shot you point blank, and the bloody ball bounced off your skull!Jamie, supporting his head in his hands as I examined him, made a sound somewhere between a snort and a groan.Aye, well, he said, his voice somewhat muffled in his hands, Ill no say Im not thick heided, but if Mistress Abernathy had used a full charge of powder, it wouldna have been nearly thick enough.Does it hurt a lot?Not the wound, no, though its sore.Ive a terrible headache, though.I shouldnt wonder.Hold on a bit; Im going to take the ball out.Not knowing in what condition we might find Ian, I had brought the smallest of my medical boxes, which fortunately contained a bottle of alcohol and a small scalpel.I shaved away a little of Jamies abundant mane, just below the swelling, and soused the area with alcohol for disinfection.My fingers were chilled from the alcohol, but his head was warm and comfortingly live to the touch.Three deep breaths and hold on tight, I murmured.Im going to cut you, but it will be fast.All right.The back of his neck looked a little pale, but the pulse was steady.He obligingly drew in his breath deeply, and exhaled, sighing.I held the area of scalp taut between the index and third fingers of my left hand.On the third breath, I said, Right now, and drew the blade hard and quick across the scalp.He grunted slightly, but didnt cry out.I pressed gently with my right thumb against the swelling, slightly harderand the ball popped out of the incision I had made, falling into my left hand like a grape.Got it, I said, and only then realized that I had been holding my breath.I dropped the little pelletsomewhat flattened by its contact with his skullinto his hand, and smiled, a little shakily.Souvenir, I said.I pressed a pad of cloth against the small wound, wound a strip of cloth round his head to hold it, and then quite suddenly, with no warning whatever, began to cry.I could feel the tears rolling down my face, and my shoulders shaking, but I felt still detached; somehow outside my body.I was conscious mostly of a mild amazement.Sassenach?Are ye all right?Jamie was peering up at me, eyes worried under the rakish bandage.Yes, I said, stuttering from the force of my crying.I d dont k know why Im c crying.I d dont know!Come here.He took my hand and drew me down onto his knee.He wrapped his arms around me and held me tight, resting his cheek on the top of my head.It will be all right, he whispered.Its fine now, mo chridhe, its fine.He rocked me gently, one hand stroking my hair and neck, and murmured small unimportant things in my ear.Just as suddenly as I had been detached, I was back inside my body, warm and shaking, feeling the iron core dissolve in my tears.Gradually I stopped weeping, and lay still against his chest, hiccuping now and then, feeling nothing but peace and the comfort of his presence.I was dimly aware that Lawrence and Ian had returned, but paid no attention to them.At one point, I heard Ian say, with more curiosity than alarm, Youre bleeding all down the back of your neck, Uncle Jamie.Perhaps youll fix me a new bandage, then, Ian, Jamie said.His voice was soft and unconcerned.I must just hold your auntie now.And sometime later I went to sleep, still held tight in the circle of his arms.I woke up later, curled on a blanket next to Jamie.He was leaning against a tree, one hand resting on my shoulder.He felt me wake, and squeezed gently.It was dark, and I could hear a rhythmic snoring somewhere close at hand.It must be Lawrence, I thought drowsily, for I could hear Young Ians voice, on the other side of Jamie.No, he was saying slowly, it wasna really so bad, on the ship.We were all kept together, so there was company from the other lads, and they fed us decently, and let us out two at a time to walk about the deck.Of course, we were all scairt, for wed no notion why wed been takenand none of the sailors would tell us anythingbut we were not mistreated.The Bruja had sailed up the Yallahs River, and delivered her human cargo directly to Rose Hall.Here the bewildered boys had been warmly welcomed by Mrs.Abernathy, and promptly popped into a new prison.The basement beneath the sugar mill had been fitted up comfortably enough, with beds and chamber pots, and aside from the noise of the sugar making above during the days, it was comfortable enough.Still, none of the boys could think why they were there, though any number of suggestions were made, each more improbable than the last.And every now and then, a great black fellow would come down into the place with Mrs.Abernathy.We always begged to know what it was we were there for, and would she not be letting us go, for mercys sake?but she only smiled and patted us and said we would see, in good time.Then she would choose a lad, and the black fellow would clamp onto the lads arm and take him awa wi them.Ians voice sounded distressed, and little wonder.Did the lads come back again?Jamie asked.His hand patted me softly, and I reached up and pressed it.Noor not usually.And that scairt us all something dreadful.Ians turn had come eight weeks after his arrival.Three lads had gone and not returned by then, and when Mistress Abernathys bright green eyes rested on him, he was not disposed to cooperate.I kicked the black fellow, and hit himI even bit his hand, Ian said ruefully, and verra nasty he tasted, tooall over some kind of grease, he was.But it made nay difference; he only clouted me over the head, hard enough to make my ears ring, then picked me up and carried me off in his arms, as though I was no more than a wee bairn.Ian had been taken into the kitchen, where he was stripped, bathed, dressed in a clean shirtbut nothing elseand taken to the main house.It was just at night, he said wistfully, and all the windows lighted.It looked verra much like Lallybroch, when ye come down from the hills just at dark, and Mams just lit the lampsit almost broke my heart to see it, and think of home.He had had little opportunity to feel homesick, though.Herculesor Atlashad marched him up the stairs into what was obviously Mistress Abernathys bedroom.Mrs.Abernathy was waiting for him, dressed in a soft, loose sort of gown with odd looking figures embroidered round the hem of it in red and silver thread.She had been cordial and welcoming, and had offered him a drink.It smelled strange, but not nasty, and as he had little choice in the matter, he had drunk it.There were two comfortable chairs in the room, on either side of a long, low table, and a great bed at one side, swagged and canopied like a kings.He had sat in one chair, Mrs.Abernathy in the other, and she had asked him questions.What sorts of questions?Jamie asked, prompting as Ian seemed hesitant.Well, all about my home, and my familyshe asked the names of all my sisters and brothers, and my aunts and unclesI jerked a bit.So that was why Geilie had betrayed no surprise at our appearance!and all sorts of things, Uncle.Then sheshe asked me had Ihad I ever lain wi a lassie.Just as though she were asking did I have parritch to my breakfast!Ian sounded shocked at the memory.I didna want to answer her, but I couldna seem to help myself.I felt verra warm, like I was fevered, and I couldna seem to move easy.But I answered all her questions, and her just sitting there, pleasant as might be, watching me close wi those big green eyes.So ye told her the truth?Aye.Aye, I did.Ian spoke slowly, reliving the scene.I said I had, and I told her aboutabout Edinburgh, and the printshop, and the seaman, and the brothel, and Mary, andeverything.For the first time, Geilie had seemed displeased with one of his answers.Her face had grown hard and her eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Ian was seriously afraid.He would have run, then, but for the heaviness in his limbs, and the presence of the giant who stood against the door, unmoving.She got up and stamped about a bit, and said I was ruined, then, as I wasna a virgin, and what business did a bittie wee lad like me have, to be goin wi the lassies and spoiling myself?Then she had stopped her ranting, poured a glass of wine and drank it off, and her temper had seemed to cool.She laughed then, and looked at me careful, and said as how I might not be such a loss, after all.If I was no good for what she had in mind, perhaps I might have other uses.Ians voice sounded faintly constricted, as though his collar were too tight.Jamie made a soothing interrogatory sound, though, and he took a deep breath, determined to go on.Well, sheshe took my hand and made me stand up.Then she took off the shirt I was wearing, and sheI swear its true, Uncle!she knelt on the floor in front of me, and took my cock into her mouth!Jamies hand tightened on my shoulder, but his voice betrayed no more than a mild interest.Aye, I believe ye, Ian.She made love to ye, then?Love?Ian sounded dazed.NoI mean, I dinna ken.Itshewell, she got my cock to stand up, and then she made me come to the bed and lie down and she did things.But it wasna at all like it was with wee Mary!No, I shouldna suppose it was, his uncle said dryly.God, it felt queer!I could sense Ians shudder from the tone of his voice.I looked up in the middle, and there was the black man, standing right by the bed, holding a candlestick.She told him to lift it higher, so that she could see better.He paused, and I heard a small glugging noise as he drank from one of the bottles.He let out a long, quivering breath.Uncle.Have ye everlain wi a woman, when ye didna want to do it?Jamie hesitated a moment, his hand tight on my shoulder, but then he said quietly, Aye, Ian.I have.Oh.The boy was quiet, and I heard him scratch his head.Dye ken how it can be, Uncle?How ye can do it, and not want to a bit, and hate doing it, andand still itit feels good?Jamie gave a small, dry laugh.Well, what it comes to, Ian, is that your cock hasna got a conscience, and you have.His hand left my shoulder as he turned toward his nephew.Dinna trouble yourself, Ian, he said.Ye couldna help it, and its likely that it saved your life for ye.The other ladsthe ones who didna come back to the cellardye ken if they were virgins?Wella few I know were for surefor we had a great deal of time to talk, aye?and after a time we kent a lot about one another.Some o the lads boasted of havin gone wi a lassie, but I thoughtfrom what they said about it, ye kenthat they hadna done it, really.He paused for a moment, as though reluctant to ask what he knew he must.Uncledye ken what happened to them?The rest of the lads with me?No, Ian, Jamie said, evenly.Ive no notion.He leaned back against the tree, sighing deeply.Dye think ye can sleep, wee Ian?If ye can, ye should, for it will be a weary walk to the shore tomorrow.Oh, I can sleep, Uncle, Ian assured him.But should I not keep watch?Its you should be resting, after bein shot and all that.He paused and then added, rather shyly, I didna say thank ye, Uncle Jamie.Jamie laughed, freely this time.Youre verra welcome, Ian, he said, the smile still in his voice.Lay your head and sleep, laddie.Ill wake ye if theres need.Ian obligingly curled up and within moments, was breathing heavily.Jamie sighed and leaned back against the tree.Do you want to sleep too, Jamie?I pushed myself up to sit beside him.Im awake; I can keep an eye out.His eyes were closed, the dying firelight dancing on the lids.He smiled without opening them and groped for my hand.No.If ye dinna mind sitting with me for a bit, though, you can watch.The headaches better if I close my eyes.We sat in contented silence for some time, hand in hand.An occasional odd noise or far off scream from some jungle animal came from the dark, but nothing seemed threatening now.Will we go back to Jamaica?I asked at last.For Fergus and Marsali?Jamie started to shake his head, then stopped, with a stifled groan.No, he said, I think we shall sail for Eleuthera.Thats Dutch owned, and neutral.We can send Innes back wi Johns boatie, and he can take a message to Fergus to come and join us.I would as soon not set foot on Jamaica again, all things considered.No, I suppose not.I was quiet for a moment, then said, I wonder how Mr.WilloughbyYi Tien Cho, I meanwill manage.I dont suppose anyone will find him, if he stays in the mountains, but  Oh, he may manage brawly, Jamie interrupted.Hes the pelican to fish for him, after all.One side of his mouth turned up in a smile.For that matter, if hes canny, hell find a way south, to Martinique.Theres a small colony there of Chinese traders.Id told him of it; said Id take him there, once our business on Jamaica was finished.You arent angry at him now?I looked at him curiously, but his face was smooth and peaceful, almost unlined in the firelight.This time he was careful not to move his head, but lifted one shoulder in a shrug, and grimaced.Och, no.He sighed and settled himself more comfortably.I dinna suppose he had much thought for what he did, or understood at all what might be the end of it.And it would be foolish to hate a man for not giving ye something he hasna got in the first place.He opened his eyes then, with a faint smile, and I knew he was thinking of John Grey.Ian twitched in his sleep, snorted loudly, and rolled over onto his back, arms flung wide.Jamie glanced at his nephew, and the smile grew wider.Thank God, he said.He goes back to his mother by the first ship headed for Scotland.I dont know, I said, smiling.He might not want to go back to Lallybroch, after all this adventure.I dinna care whether he wants to or not, Jamie said firmly.Hes going, if I must pack him up in a crate.Are ye looking for something, Sassenach?he added, seeing me groping in the dark.Ive got it, I said, pulling the flat hypodermic case out of my pocket.I flipped it open to check the contents, squinting to see by the waning light.Oh, good; theres enough left for one whopping dose.Jamie sat up a little straighter.Im not fevered a bit, he said, eyeing me warily.And if ye have it in mind to shove that filthy spike into my head, ye can just think again, Sassenach!Not you, I said.Ian.Unless you mean to send him home to Jenny riddled with syphilis and other interesting forms of the clap.Jamies eyebrows rose toward his hairline, and he winced at the resultant sensation.Ow.Syphilis?Ye think so?I shouldnt be a bit surprised.Pronounced dementia is one of the symptoms of the advanced diseasethough I must say it would be hard to tell in her case.Still, better safe than sorry, hm?Jamie snorted briefly with amusement.Well, that may teach Young Ian the price o dalliance.Id best distract Stern while ye take the lad behind a bush for his penance, though; Lawrence is a bonny man for a Jew, but hes curious.I dinna want ye burnt at the stake in Kingston, after all.I expect that would be awkward for the Governor, I said dryly.Much as he might enjoy it, personally.I shouldna think he would, Sassenach.His dryness matched my own.Is my coat within reach?Yes.I found the garment folded on the ground near me, and handed it to him.Are you cold?No.He leaned back, the coat laid across his knees.Its only that I wanted to feel the bairns all close to me while I sleep.He smiled at me, folded his hands gently atop the coat and its pictures, and closed his eyes again.Good night, Sassenach.63  OUT OF THE DEPTHS  In the morning, buoyed by rest and a breakfast of biscuit and plantain, we pressed on toward the shore in good hearteven Ian, who ceased to limp ostentatiously after the first quarter mile.As we came down the defile that led onto the beach, though, a remarkable sight met our eyes.Jesus God, its them!Ian blurted.The pirates!He turned, ready to flee back into the hills, but Jamie grasped him by the arm.Not pirates, he said.Its the slaves.Look!Unskilled in the seamanship of large vessels, the escaped slaves of the Yallahs River plantations had evidently made a slow and blundering passage toward Hispaniola, and having somehow arrived at that island, had promptly run the ship aground.The Bruja lay canted on her side in the shallows, her keel sunk deep in the sandy mud.A very agitated group of slaves surrounded her, some rushing up and down the beach shouting, others dashing off toward the refuge of the jungle, a few remaining to help the last of their number off the beached hulk.A quick glance out to sea showed the cause of their agitation.A patch of white showed on the horizon, growing in size even as we watched.A man of war, Lawrence said, sounding interested.Jamie said something under his breath in Gaelic, and Ian glanced at him, shocked.Out of here, Jamie said tersely.He pulled Ian about and gave him a shove up the defile, then grabbed my hand.Wait!said Lawrence, shading his eyes.Theres another ship coming.A little one.The Governor of Jamaicas private pinnace, to be exact, leaning at a perilous angle as she shot round the curve of the bay, her canvas bellied by the wind on her quarter.Jamie stood for a split second, weighing the possibilities, then grabbed my hand again.Lets go!he said.By the time we reached the edge of the beach, the pinnaces small boat was plowing through the shallows, Raeburn and MacLeod pulling hard at the oars.I was wheezing and gulping air, my knees rubbery from the run.Jamie snatched me up bodily into his arms and ran into the surf, followed by Lawrence and Ian, gasping like whales.I saw Gordon, a hundred yards out in the pinnaces bow, aim a gun at the shore, and knew we were followed.The musket discharged with a puff of smoke, and Meldrum, behind him, promptly raised his own weapon and fired.Taking it in turns, the two of them covered our splashing advance, until friendly hands could pull us over the side and raise the boat.Come about!Innes, manning the wheel, barked the order, and the boom swung across, the sails filling at once.Jamie hauled me to my feet and deposited me on a bench, then flung himself down beside me, panting.Holy God, he wheezed.Did I notell ye tostay awayDuncan?Save your breath, Mac Dubh, Innes said, a wide grin spreading under his mustache.Ye havena enough to be wasting it.He shouted something to MacLeod, who nodded and did something to the lines.The pinnace heeled over, changed her course, and came about, headed straight out of the tiny coveand straight toward the man of war, now close enough for me to see the fat lipped porpoise grinning beneath its bowsprit.MacLeod bellowed something in Gaelic, accompanied by a gesture that left the meaning of what he had said in no doubt.To a triumphant yodel from Innes, we shot past the Porpoise, directly under her bow and close enough to see surprised looking heads poking out from the rail above.I looked back as we left the cove, to see the Porpoise still heading in, massive under her three great masts.The pinnace could never outrace her on the open sea, but in close quarters, the little sloop was light and maneuverable as a feather by comparison to the leviathan man of war.Its the slave ship theyll be after, Meldrum said, turning to look alongside me.We saw the man o war pick her up, three miles off the island.We thought whilst they were otherwise occupied, we might as well nip in and pick ye all off the beach.Good enough, Jamie said with a smile.His chest was still heaving, but he had recovered his breath.I hope the Porpoise will be sufficiently occupied for the time being.A warning shout from Raeburn indicated that this was not to be, however.Looking back, I could see the gleam of brass on the Porpoises deck as the pair of long guns called stern chasers were uncovered and began their process of aiming.Now it was us at gunpoint, and I found the sensation very objectionable.Still, we were moving, and fast, at that.Innes put the wheel hard over, then hard again, tacking a zigzag path past the headland.The stern chasers boomed together.There was a splash off the port bow, twenty yards away, but a good deal too close for comfort, given the fact that a twenty four pound ball through the floor of the pinnace would sink us like a rock.Innes cursed and hunched his shoulders over the wheel, his missing arm giving him an odd, lopsided appearance.Our course became still more erratic, and the next three tries came nowhere near.Then came a louder boom, and I looked back to see the side of the canted Bruja erupt in splinters, as the Porpoise came in range and trained her forward guns on the grounded ship.A rain of grapeshot hit the beach, striking dead in the center of a group of fleeing slaves.Bodiesand parts of bodiesflew into the air like black stick figures and fell to the sand, staining it with red blotches.Severed limbs were scattered over the beach like driftwood.Holy Mary, Mother of God.Ian, white to the lips, crossed himself, staring in horror at the beach as the shelling went on.Two more shots struck the Bruja, opening up a great hole in her side.Several landed harmlessly in the sand, and two more found their mark among the fleeing people.Then we were round the edge of the headland, and heading into the open sea, the beach and its carnage lost to view.Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.Ian finished his prayer in a whisper, and crossed himself again.There was little conversation in the boat, beyond Jamies giving Innes instructions for Eleuthera, and a conference between Innes and MacLeod as to the proper heading.The rest of us were too appalled by what we had just seenand too relieved at our own escapeto want to talk.The weather was fair, with a bright, brisk breeze, and we made good way.By sundown, the island of Hispaniola had dropped below the horizon, and Grand Turk Island was rising to the left.I ate my small share of the available biscuit, drank a cup of water, and curled myself in the bottom of the boat, lying down between Ian and Jamie to sleep.Innes, yawning, took his own rest in the bow, while MacLeod and Meldrum took it in turns to man the helm through the night.A shout woke me in the morning.I rose on one elbow, blinking with sleep and stiff from a night spent on bare, damp boards.Jamie was standing by me, his hair blowing back in the morning breeze.What?I asked Jamie.What is it?I dinna believe it, he said, staring aft over the rail.Its that bloody boat again!I scrambled to my feet, to find that it was true; far astern were tiny white sails.Are you sure?I said, squinting.Can you tell at this distance?I cant, no, Jamie said frankly, but Innes and MacLeod can, and they say its the bloodsucking English, right enough.Theyll have guessed our heading, maybe, and come after us, as soon as theyd dealt with those poor black buggers on Hispaniola.He turned away from the rail, shrugging.Damned little to be done about it, save to hope we stay ahead of them.Innes says theres a hope of giving them the slip off Cat Island, if we reach there by dark.As the day wore on, we kept just out of firing distance, but Innes looked more and more worried.The sea between Cat Island and Eleuthera was shallow, and filled with coral heads.A man of war could never follow us into the mazebut neither could we move swiftly enough through it to avoid being sunk by the Porpoises long guns.Once in those treacherous shoals and channels, we would be sitting ducks.At last, reluctantly, the decision was made to head east, out to sea; we could not risk slowing, and there was a slight chance of giving the man of war the slip in the dark.When dawn came, all sight of land had disappeared.The Porpoise, unfortunately, had not.She was no closer, but as the wind rose along with the sun, she shook out more sail, and began to gain.With every scrap of sail already hoisted, and nowhere to hide, there was nothing we could do but runand wait.All through the long hours of the morning, the Porpoise grew steadily larger astern.The sky had begun to cloud over, and the wind had risen considerably, but this helped the Porpoise, with her huge spread of canvas, a great deal more than it did us.By ten oclock, she was close enough to risk a shot.It fell far astern, but was frightening, nonetheless.Innes squinted back over his shoulder, judging the distance, then shook his head and settled grimly to his course.There was nothing to be gained by tacking now; we must head straight on, as long as we could, taking evasive action only when it was too late for anything else.By eleven, the Porpoise had drawn within a quarter mile, and the monotonous boom of her forward guns had begun to sound every ten minutes, as her gunner tried the range.If I closed my eyes, I could imagine Erik Johansen, bent sweating and powder stained over his gun, the smoking slow match in his hand.I hoped that Annekje had been left on Antigua with her goats.By eleven thirty, it had begun to rain, and a heavy sea was running.A sudden gust of wind struck us sideways, and the boat heeled over far enough to bring the port rail within a foot of the water.Dumped onto the deck by the motion, we disentangled ourselves as Innes and MacLeod skillfully righted the pinnace.I glanced back, as I did every few minutes, despite myself, and saw the seamen scampering aloft in the Porpoise, reefing the topsails.Thats luck!MacGregor shouted in my ear, nodding where I was looking.Thatll slow them.By twelve thirty, the sky had gone a peculiar purple green, and the wind had risen to an eerie whine.The Porpoise had taken in yet more canvas, and in spite of the action, had had a staysail carried away, the scrap of canvas jerked from the mast and whipped away, flapping like an albatross.She had long since stopped firing on us, unable to aim at such a small target in the heavy swell.With the sun gone from sight, I could no longer estimate time.The storm caught us squarely, perhaps an hour later.There was no possibility of hearing anything; by sign language and grimaces, Innes made the men lower the sails; to keep canvas flying, or even reefed, was to risk having the mast ripped from the floorboards.I clung tight to the rail with one hand, to Ians hand with the other.Jamie crouched behind us, arms spread to give us the shelter of his back.The rain lashed past, hard enough to sting the skin, driven almost horizontal by the wind, and so thick that I barely saw the faint shape on the horizon that I thought was Eleuthera.The sea had risen to terrifying heights, with swells rolling forty feet high.The pinnace rode them lightly, carried up and up and up to dizzy heights, then dropped abruptly into a trough.Jamies face was dead white in the storm light, his sodden hair pasted against his scalp.It was near dark that it happened.The sky was nearly black, but there was an eerie green glow all across the horizon that silhouetted the skeletal shape of the Porpoise behind us.Another of the rain squalls slammed us sideways, lurching and swaying atop a huge wave.As we picked ourselves up from yet another bruising spill, Jamie grabbed my arm, and pointed behind us.The Porpoises foremast was oddly bent, the top of it leaning far to one side.Before I had time to realize what was happening, the top fifteen feet of the mast had split off and pitched into the sea, carrying with it rigging and spars.The man of war swung heavily round this impromptu anchor, and came sliding sideways down the face of a wave.The wall of water towered over the ship, and came crashing down, catching her broadside.The Porpoise heeled, spun around once.The next wave rose, and took her stern first, pulling the high aft deck below the water, whipping the masts through the air like snapping twigs.It took three more waves to sink her; no time for escape for her hapless crew, but plenty for those of us watching to share their terror.There was a great bubbling flurry in the trough of a wave, and the man of war was gone.Jamies arm was rigid as iron beneath my hand.All the men stared back, faces gone empty with horror.All save Innes, who crouched doggedly over the wheel, meeting each wave as it came.A new wave rose up beside the rail and seemed to hover there, looming above me.The great wall of water was glassy clear; I could see suspended in it the debris and the men of the wrecked Porpoise, limbs outflung in grotesque ballet.The body of Thomas Leonard hung no more than ten feet from me, drowned mouth open in surprise, his long soft hair aswirl above the gilded collar of his coat.Then the wave struck.I was snatched off the deck, and at once engulfed in chaos.Blind and deaf, unable to breathe, I was tumbled through space, my arms and legs wrenched awry by the force of the water.Everything was dark; there was nothing but sensation, and all of that intense but indistinguishable.Pressure and noise and overwhelming cold.I couldnt feel the pull of my clothing, or the jerk of the ropeif it was still therearound my waist.A sudden faint warmth swathed my legs, distinct in the surrounding cold as a cloud in a clear sky.Urine, I thought, but didnt know whether it was my own, or the last touch of another human body, swallowed as I was in the belly of the wave.My head hit something with a sickening crack, and suddenly I was coughing my lungs out on the deck of the pinnace, still miraculously afloat.I sat up slowly, choking and wheezing.My rope was still in place, yanked so tight about my waist that I was sure my lower ribs were broken.I jerked feebly at it, trying to breathe, and then Jamie was there, one arm around me, the other groping at his belt for a knife.Are ye all right?he bellowed, his voice barely audible above the shrieking wind.No!I tried to shout back, but it came out as no more than a wheeze.I shook my head, fumbling at my waist.The sky was a queer purple green, a color I had never seen before.Jamie sawed at the rope, his bent head spray soaked and the color of mahogany, hair whipped across his face by the fury of the wind.The rope popped and I gulped in air, ignoring a stabbing pain in my side and the stinging of raw skin about my waist.The ship was pitching wildly, the deck swinging up and down like a lawn glider.Jamie fell down on the deck, pulling me with him, and began to work his way on hands and knees toward the mast, some six feet away, dragging me.My garments had been drenched through, plastered to me from my immersion in the wave.Now the blast of the wind was so great that it plucked my skirts away from my legs and flung them up, half dried, to beat about my face like goose wings.Jamies arm was tight as an iron bar across my chest.I clung to him, trying to aid our progress by shoving with my feet on the slippery deckboards.Smaller waves washed over the rail, sousing us intermittently, but no more huge monsters followed them.Reaching hands grasped us and hauled us the last few feet, into the nominal shelter of the mast.Innes had tied the wheel over long since; as I looked forward, I saw lightning strike the sea ahead, making the spokes of the wheel spring out black, leaving an image like a spiders web printed on my retina.Speech was impossibleand unnecessary.Raeburn, Ian, Meldrum, and Lawrence were huddled against the mast, all tied; frightful as it was on deck, no one wanted to go below, to be tossed to and fro in bruising darkness, with no notion of what was happening overhead.I was sitting on the deck, legs splayed, with the mast at my back and the line passed across my chest.The sky had gone lead gray on one side, a deep, lucent green on the other, and lightning was striking at random over the surface of the sea, bright jags of brilliance across the dark.The wind was so loud that even the thunderclaps reached us only now and then, as muffled booms, like ships guns firing at a distance.Then a bolt crashed down beside the ship, lightning and thunder together, close enough to hear the hiss of boiling water in the ringing aftermath of the thunderclap.The sharp reek of ozone flooded the air.Innes turned from the light, his tall, thin figure so sharply cut against the flash that he looked momentarily like a skeleton, black bones against the sky.The momentary dazzle and his movement made it seem for an instant that he stood whole once more, two arms swinging, as though his missing limb had emerged from the ghost world to join him, here on the brink of eternity.Oh, de headbone connected to deneckbone.Joe Abernathys voice sang softly in memory.And de neckbone connected to debackbone I had a sudden hideous vision of the scattered limbs I had seen on the beach by the corpse of the Bruja, animated by the lightning, squirming and wriggling to reunite.Dem bones, dem bones, are gonna walk around.Now, hear de word of de Lawd!Another clap of thunder and I screamed, not at the sound, but at the lightning bolt of memory.A skull in my hands, with empty eyes that had once been the green of the hurricane sky.Jamie shouted something in my ear, but I couldnt hear him.I could only shake my head in speechless shock, my skin rippling with horror.My hair, like my skirts, was drying in the wind; the strands of it danced on my head, pulling at the roots.As it dried, I felt the crackle of static electricity where my hair brushed my cheek.There was a sudden movement among the sailors around me and I looked up, to see the spars and rigging above coated in the blue phosphorescence of St.Elmos fire.A fireball dropped to the deck and rolled toward us, streaming phosphorescence.Jamie struck at it and it hopped delicately into the air and rolled away along the rail, leaving a scent of burning in its wake.I looked up at Jamie to see if he was all right, and saw the loose ends of his hair standing out from his head, coated with fire and streaming backward like a demons.Streaks of vivid blue outlined the fingers of his hand when he brushed the hair from his face.Then he looked down, saw me, and grasped my hand.A jolt of electricity shot through us both with the touch, but he didnt let go.I couldnt say how long it lasted; hours or days.Our mouths dried from the wind, and grew sticky with thirst.The sky went from gray to black, but there was no telling whether it was night, or only the coming of rain.The rain, when it did come, was welcome.It came with the drenching roar of a tropical shower, a drumming audible even above the wind.Better yet, it was hail, not rain; the hailstones hit my skull like pebbles, but I didnt care.I gathered the icy globules in both hands, and swallowed them half melted, a cool benison to my tortured throat.Meldrum and MacLeod crawled about the deck on hands and knees, scooping the hailstones into buckets and pots, anything that would hold water.I slept intermittently, head lolling on Jamies shoulder, and woke to find the wind still screaming.Numb to terror now, I only waited.Whether we lived or died seemed of little consequence, if only the dreadful noise would stop.There was no telling day from night, no way to keep time, while the sun hid its face.The darkness seemed a little lighter now and then, but whether it was by virtue of daylight or moonlight, I couldnt tell.I slept, and woke, and slept again.Then I woke, to find the wind a little quieter.The seas still heaved, and the tiny boat pitched like a cockleshell, throwing us up and dropping us with stomach churning regularity.But the noise was less; I could hear, when MacGregor shouted to Ian to pass a cup of water.The mens faces were chapped and raw, their lips cracked to bleeding by the whistling wind, but they were smiling.Its gone by.Jamies voice was low and husky in my ear, rusted by weather.The storms past.It was; there were breaks in the lead gray sky, and small flashes of a pale, fresh blue.I thought it must be early morning, sometime just past dawn, but couldnt tell for sure.While the hurricane had ceased to blow, there was still a strong wind, and the storm surge carried us at an amazing speed.Meldrum took the wheel from Innes, and bending to check the compass, gave a cry of surprise.The fireball that had come aboard during the storm had harmed no one, but the compass was now a melted mass of silver metal, the wooden casing around it untouched.Amazing!said Lawrence, touching it reverently with one finger.Aye, and inconvenient, forbye, said Innes dryly.He looked upward, toward the ragged remnants of the dashing clouds.Much of a hand at celestial navigation, are ye, Mr.Stern?After much squinting at the rising sun and the remnants of the morning stars, Jamie, Innes, and Stern determined that our heading was roughly northeast.We must turn to the west, Stern said, leaning over the crude chart with Jamie and Innes.We do not know where we are, but any land must surely be to the west.Innes nodded, peering soberly at the chart, which showed a sprinkle of islands like coarse ground pepper, floating on the waters of the Caribbean.Aye, thats so, he said.Weve been headed out to sea for God knows how long.The hulls in one piece, but thats all Id say for it.As for the mast and sailswell, theyll maybe hold for a time.He sounded dubious in the extreme.God knows where we may fetch up, though.Jamie grinned at him, dabbing at a trickle of blood from his cracked lip.So long as its land, Duncan, Im no verra choosy about where.Innes quirked an eyebrow at him, a slight smile on his lips.Aye?And here I thought yed settled for sure on a sailors life, Mac Dubh; yere sae canty on deck.Why, ye havena puked once in the last twa days!Thats because I havena eaten anything in the last twa days, Jamie said wryly.I dinna much care if the island we find first is English, French, Spanish, or Dutch, but I should be obliged if yed find one with food, Duncan.Innes wiped a hand across his mouth and swallowed painfully; the mention of food made everyone salivate, despite dry mouths.Ill do my best, Mac Dubh, he promised.Land!Its land!The call came at last, five days later, in a voice rendered so hoarse by wind and thirst that it was no more than a faint croak, but full of joy, nonetheless.I dashed up on deck to see, my feet slipping on the ladder rungs.Everyone was hanging over the rail, looking at the humped black shape on the horizon.It was far off, but undeniably land, solid and distinct.Where do you think we are?I tried to say, but my voice was so hoarse, the words came out in a tiny whisper, and no one heard.It didnt matter; if we were headed straight for the naval barracks at Antigua, I didnt care.The waves were running in huge, smooth swells, like the backs of whales.The wind was gusting now, and Innes called for the helmsman to bring the bow another point nearer the wind.I could see a line of large birds flying, a stately procession skimming down the distant shoreline.Pelicans, searching the shallows for fish, with the sun gleaming on their wings.I tugged at Jamies sleeve and pointed at them.Look I began, but got no further.There was a sharp crack!and the world exploded in black and fire.I came to in the water.Dazed and half choked, I floundered and fought in a world of dark green.Something was wrapped about my legs, dragging me down.I flailed wildly, kicking to free my leg of the deadly grip.Something floated past my head, and I grabbed for it.Wood, blessed wood, something to hold onto in the surging waves.A dark shape sleeked by like a seal beneath the water, and a red head bobbed up six feet away, gasping.Hold on!Jamie said.He reached me with two strokes, and ducking under the piece of wood I held, dived down.I felt a tugging at my leg, a sharp pain, and then the dragging tension eased.Jamies head popped up again, across the spar.He grasped my wrists and hung there, gulping air, as the rolling swell carried us, up and down.I couldnt see the ship anywhere; had it sunk?A wave broke over my head, and Jamie disappeared temporarily.I shook my head, blinking, and he was there again.He smiled at me, a savage grin of effort, and his grip on my wrists tightened harder.Hold on!he rasped again, and I did.The wood was harsh and splintery under my hands, but I clung for all I was worth.We drifted, half blinded by spray, spinning like a bit of flotsam, so that sometimes I saw the distant shore, sometimes nothing but the open sea from which we had come.And when the waves washed over us, I saw nothing but water.There was something wrong with my leg; a strange numbness, punctuated with flashes of sharp pain.The vision of Murphys peg and the razor grin of an openmouthed shark drifted through my mind; had my leg been taken by some toothy beast?I thought of my tiny hoard of warm blood, streaming from the stump of a bitten limb, draining away into the cold vastness of the sea, and I panicked, trying to snatch my hand from Jamies grasp in order to reach down and see for myself.He snarled something unintelligible at me and held on to my wrists like grim death.After a moment of frenzied thrashing, reason returned, and I calmed myself, thinking that if my leg were indeed gone, I would have lost consciousness by now.At that, I was beginning to lose consciousness.My vision was growing gray at the edges, and floating bright spots covered Jamies face.Was I really bleeding to death, or was it only cold and shock?It hardly seemed to matter, I thought muzzily; the effect was the same.A sense of lassitude and utter peace stole gradually over me.I couldnt feel my feet or legs, and only Jamies crushing grip on my hands reminded me of their existence.My head went under water, and I had to remind myself to hold my breath.The wave subsided and the wood rose slightly, bringing my nose above water.I breathed, and my vision cleared slightly.A foot away was the face of Jamie Fraser, hair plastered to his head, wet features contorted against the spray.Hold on!he roared.Hold on, God damn you!I smiled gently, barely hearing him.The sense of great peace was lifting me, carrying me beyond the noise and chaos.There was no more pain.Nothing mattered.Another wave washed over me, and this time I forgot to hold my breath.The choking sensation roused me briefly, long enough to see the flash of terror in Jamies eyes.Then my vision went dark again.Damn you, Sassenach!his voice said, from a very great distance.His voice was choked with passion.Damn you!I swear if ye die on me, Ill kill you!I was dead.Everything around me was a blinding white, and there was a soft, rushing noise like the wings of angels.I felt peaceful and bodiless, free of terror, free of rage, filled with quiet happiness.Then I coughed.I wasnt bodiless, after all.My leg hurt.It hurt a lot.I became gradually aware that a good many other things hurt, too, but my left shin took precedence in no uncertain terms.I had the distinct impression that the bone had been removed and replaced with a red hot poker.At least the leg was demonstrably there.When I cracked my eyes open to look, the haze of pain that floated over my leg seemed almost visible, though perhaps that was only a product of the general fuzziness in my head.Whether mental or physical in origin, the general effect was of a sort of whirling whiteness, shot with flickers of a brighter light.Watching it hurt my eyes, so I shut them again.Thank God, youre awake!said a relieved sounding Scottish voice near my ear.No Im not, I said.My own voice emerged as a salt crusted croak, rusty with swallowed seawater.I could feel seawater in my sinuses, too, which gave my head an unpleasant gurgling feel.I coughed again, and my nose began to run profusely.Then I sneezed.Eugh!I said, in complete revulsion at the resultant cascade of slime over my upper lip.My hand seemed far off and insubstantial, but I made the effort to raise it, swiping clumsily at my face.Be still, Sassenach; Ill take care of ye.There was a definite note of amusement in the voice, which irritated me enough to open my eyes again.I caught a brief glimpse of Jamies face, intent on mine, before vision vanished once again in the folds of an immense white handkerchief.He wiped my face thoroughly, ignoring my strangled noises of protest and impending suffocation, then held the cloth to my nose.Blow, he said.I did as he said.Rather to my surprise, it helped quite a lot.I could think more or less coherently, now that my head was unclogged.Jamie smiled down at me.His hair was rumpled and stiff with dried salt, and there was a wide abrasion on his temple, an angry dark red against the bronzed skin.He seemed not to be wearing a shirt, but had a blanket of some kind draped about his shoulders.Do ye feel verra bad?he asked.Horrible, I croaked in reply.I was also beginning to be annoyed at being alive, after all, and being required to take notice of things again.Hearing the rasp in my voice, Jamie reached for a jug of water on the table by my bed.I blinked in confusion, but it really was a bed, not a berth or a hammock.The linen sheets contributed to the overwhelming impression of whiteness that had first engulfed me.This was reinforced by the whitewashed walls and ceiling, and the long white muslin draperies that bellied in like sails, rustling in the breeze from the open windows.The flickering light came from reflections that shimmered over the ceiling; apparently there was water close by outside, and sun shining on it.It seemed altogether cozier than Davy Joness locker.Still, I felt a brief moment of intense regret for the sense of infinite peace.I had experienced in the heart of the wavea regret made more keen by the slight movement that sent a bolt of white agony up my leg.I think your leg is broken, Sassenach, Jamie told me unnecessarily.Ye likely shouldna move it much.Thanks for the advice, I said, through gritted teeth.Where in bloody hell are we?He shrugged briefly.I dinna ken.Its a fair sized house, is all I could say.I wasna taking much note when they brought us in.One man said the place is called Les Perles.He held the cup to my lips and I swallowed gratefully.What happened?So long as I was careful not to move, the pain in my leg was bearable.Automatically, I placed my fingers under the angle of my jaw to check my pulse; reassuringly strong.I wasnt in shock; my leg couldnt be badly fractured, much as it hurt.Jamie rubbed a hand over his face.He looked very tired, and I noticed that his hand trembled with fatigue.There was a large bruise on his cheek, and a line of dried blood where something had scratched the side of his neck.The topmast snapped, I think.One of the spars fell and knocked ye overboard.When ye hit the water, ye sank like a stone, and I dived in after you.I got hold of youand the spar, too, thank God.Ye had a bit of rigging tangled round your leg, dragging ye down, but I managed to get that off.He heaved a deep sigh, and rubbed his head.I just held to ye; and after a time, I felt sand under my feet.I carried ye ashore, and a bit later, some men found us and brought us here.Thats all.He shrugged.I felt cold, despite the warm breeze coming in through the windows.What happened to the ship?And the men?Ian?Lawrence?Safe, I think.They couldna reach us, with the mast brokenby the time theyd rigged a makeshift sail, we were long gone.He coughed roughly, and rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth.But theyre safe; the men who found us said theyd seen a small ketch go aground on a mud flat a quarter mile south of here; theyve gone down to salvage and bring back the men.He took a swallow of water, swished it about his mouth, and going to the window, spat it out.Ive sand in my teeth, he said, grimacing, as he returned.And my ears.And my nose, and the crack of my arse, too, I shouldna wonder.I reached out and took his hand again.His palm was heavily calloused, but still showed the tender swelling of rising blisters, with shreds of ragged skin and raw flesh, where earlier blisters had burst and bled.How long were we in the water?I asked, gently tracing the lines of his swollen palm.The tiny C at the base of his thumb was faded almost to invisibility, but I could still feel it under my finger.Just how long did you hold on?Long enough, he said simply.He smiled a little, and held my hand more tightly, despite the soreness of his own.It dawned on me suddenly that I wasnt wearing anything; the linen sheets were smooth and cool on my bare skin, and I could see the swell of my nipples, rising under the thin fabric.What happened to my clothes?I couldna hold ye up against the drag of your skirts, so I ripped them off, he explained.What was left didna seem worth saving.I dont suppose so, I said slowly, but Jamiewhat about you?Wheres your coat?He shrugged, then let his shoulders drop, and smiled ruefully.At the bottom of the sea with my shoon, I expect, he said.And the pictures of Willie and Brianna there, too.Oh, Jamie.Im so sorry.I reached for his hand and held it tightly.He looked away, and blinked once or twice.Aye, well, he said softly.I expect I will remember them.He shrugged again, with a lopsided smile.And if not, I can look in the glass, no?I gave a laugh that was half a sob; he swallowed painfully, but went on smiling.He glanced down at his tattered breeches then, and seeming to think of something, leaned back and worked a hand into the pocket.I didna come away completely empty handed, he said, pulling a wry face.Though I would as soon it had been the pictures I kept, and lost these.He opened his hand, and I saw the gleam and glitter in his ruined palm.Stones of the first quality, cut and faceted, suitable for magic.An emerald, a rubymale, I supposeda great fiery opal, a turquoise blue as the sky I could see out the window, a golden stone like sun trapped in honey, and the strange crystal purity of Geilies black diamond.You have the adamant, I said, touching it gently.It was still cool to the touch, in spite of being worn so close to his body.I have, he said, but he was looking at me, not at the stone, a slight smile on his face.What is it an adamant gives ye?The knowledge of joy in all things?So I was told.I lifted my hand to his face and stroked it lightly, feeling hard bone and lively flesh, warm to the touch, and joyful to behold above all things.We have Ian, I said softly.And each other.Aye, thats true.The smile reached his eyes then.He dropped the stones in a glittering heap on the table and leaned back in his chair, cradling my hand between his.I relaxed, feeling a warm peace begin to steal over me, in spite of the aches and scrapes and the pain in my leg.We were alive, safe and together, and very little else mattered; surely not clothes, nor a fractured tibia.Everything would be managed in timebut not now.For now, it was enough only to breathe, and look at Jamie.We sat in a peaceful silence for some time, watching the sunlit curtains and the open sky.It might have been ten minutes later, or as much as an hour, when I heard the sound of light footsteps outside, and a delicate rap at the door.Come in, Jamie said.He sat up straighter, but didnt let go of my hand.The door opened, and a woman stepped in, her pleasant face lit by welcome, tinged with curiosity.Good morning, she said, a little shyly.I must beg your pardon, not to have waited upon you before; I was in the town, and learned of yourarrivalshe smiled at the wordonly when I returned, just now.We must thank ye, Madame, most sincerely, for the kind treatment afforded to us, Jamie said.He rose and bowed formally to her, but kept hold of my hand.Your servant, maam.Have ye word of our companions?She blushed slightly, and bobbed a curtsy in reply to his bow.She was young, only in her twenties, and seemed unsure quite how to conduct herself under the circumstances.She had light brown hair, pulled back in a knot, fair pink skin, and what I thought was a faint West Country accent.Oh, yes, she said.My servants brought them back from the ship; theyre in the kitchen now, being fed.Thank you, I said, meaning it.Thats terribly kind of you.She blushed rosily with embarrassment.Not at all, she murmured, then glanced shyly at me.I must beg your pardon for my lack of manners, maam, she said.I am remiss in not introducing myself.I am Patsy OlivierMrs.Joseph Olivier, that is.She looked expectantly from me to Jamie, clearly expecting reciprocation.Jamie and I exchanged a glance.Where, exactly, were we?Mrs.Olivier was English, that was clear enough.Her husbands name was French.The bay outside gave no clue; this could be any of the Windward IslesBarbados, the Bahamas, the Exumas, Androseven the Virgin Islands.Orthe thought struck mewe might have been blown south by the hurricane, and not north; in which case, this might even be Antiguain the lap of the British Navy!or Martinique, or the GrenadinesI looked at Jamie and shrugged.Our hostess was still waiting, glancing expectantly from one to the other of us.Jamie tightened his hold on my hand and drew a deep breath.I trust ye willna think this an odd question, Mistress Olivierbut could ye tell me where we are?Mrs.Oliviers brows rose to the edge of her widows peak, and she blinked in astonishment.Wellyes, she said.We call it Les Perles.Thank you, I put in, seeing Jamie taking breath to try again, but what we mean iswhat island is this?A broad smile of understanding broke out on her round pink face.Oh, I see!she said.Of course, you were cast away by the storm.My husband was saying last night that hed never seen such a dreadful blow at this time of year.What a mercy it is that you were saved!But you came from the islands to the south, then?The south.This couldnt be Cuba.Might we have come as far as St.Thomas, or even Florida?We exchanged a quick glance, and I squeezed Jamies hand.I could feel the pulse beating in his wrist.Mrs.Olivier smiled indulgently.You are not on an island at all.You are on the mainland; in the Colony of Georgia.Georgia, Jamie said.America?He sounded slightly stunned, and no wonder.We had been blown at least six hundred miles by the storm.America, I said softly.The New World.The pulse beneath my fingers had quickened, echoing my own.A new world.Refuge.Freedom.Yes, said Mrs.Olivier, plainly having no idea what the news meant to us, but still smiling kindly from one to the other.It is America.Jamie straightened his shoulders and smiled back at her.The clean bright air stirred his hair like kindling flames.In that case, maam, he said, my name is Jamie Fraser.He looked then at me, eyes blue and brilliant as the sky behind him, and his heart beat strong in the palm of my hand.And this is Claire, he said.My wife.1   A HANGING IN EDEN  Charleston, June 1767  I heard the drums long before they came in sight.The beating echoed in the pit of my stomach, as though I too were hollow.The sound traveled through the crowd, a harsh military rhythm meant to be heard over speech or gunfire.I saw heads turn as the people fell silent, looking up the stretch of East Bay Street, where it ran from the half built skeleton of the new Customs House toward White Point Gardens.It was a hot day, even for Charleston in June.The best places were on the seawall, where the air moved; here below, it was like being roasted alive.My shift was soaked through, and the cotton bodice clung between my breasts.I wiped my face for the tenth time in as many minutes and lifted the heavy coil of my hair, hoping vainly for a cooling breeze upon my neck.I was morbidly aware of necks at the moment.Unobtrusively, I put my hand up to the base of my throat, letting my fingers circle it.I could feel the pulse beat in my carotid arteries, along with the drums, and when I breathed, the hot wet air clogged my throat as though I were choking.I quickly took my hand down, and drew in a breath as deep as I could manage.That was a mistake.The man in front of me hadnt bathed in a month or more; the edge of the stock about his thick neck was dark with grime and his clothes smelled sour and musty, pungent even amid the sweaty reek of the crowd.The smell of hot bread and frying pig fat from the food vendors stalls lay heavy over a musk of rotting seagrass from the marsh, only slightly relieved by a whiff of salt breeze from the harbor.There were several children in front of me, craning and gawking, running out from under the oaks and palmettos to look up the street, being called back by anxious parents.The girl nearest me had a neck like the white part of a grass stalk, slender and succulent.There was a ripple of excitement through the crowd; the gallows procession was in sight at the far end of the street.The drums grew louder.Where is he?Fergus muttered beside me, craning his own neck to see.I knew I should have gone with him!Hell be here.I wanted to stand on tiptoe, but didnt, feeling that this would be undignified.I did glance around, though, searching.I could always spot Jamie in a crowd; he stood head and shoulders above most men, and his hair caught the light in a blaze of reddish gold.There was no sign of him yet, only a bobbing sea of bonnets and tricornes, sheltering from the heat those citizens come too late to find a place in the shade.The flags came first, fluttering above the heads of the excited crowd, the banners of Great Britain and of the Royal Colony of South Carolina.And another, bearing the family arms of the Lord Governor of the colony.Then came the drummers, walking two by two in step, their sticks an alternate beat and blur.It was a slow march, grimly inexorable.A dead march, I thought they called that particular cadence; very suitable under the circumstances.All other noises were drowned by the rattle of the drums.Then came the platoon of red coated soldiers and in their midst, the prisoners.There were three of them, hands bound before them, linked together by a chain that ran through rings on the iron collars about their necks.The first man was small and elderly, ragged and disreputable, a shambling wreck who lurched and staggered so that the dark suited clergyman who walked beside the prisoners was obliged to grasp his arm to keep him from falling.Is that Gavin Hayes?He looks sick, I murmured to Fergus.Hes drunk.The soft voice came from behind me, and I whirled, to find Jamie standing at my shoulder, eyes fixed on the pitiful procession.The small mans disequilibrium was disrupting the progress of the parade, as his stumbling forced the two men chained to him to zig and zag abruptly in order to keep their feet.The general impression was of three inebriates rolling home from the local tavern; grossly at odds with the solemnity of the occasion.I could hear the rustle of laughter over the drums, and shouts and jeers from the crowds on the wrought iron balconies of the houses on East Bay Street.Your doing?I spoke quietly, so as not to attract notice, but I could have shouted and waved my arms; no one had eyes for anything but the scene before us.I felt rather than saw Jamies shrug, as he moved forward to stand beside me.It was what he asked of me, he said.And the best I could manage for him.Brandy or whisky?asked Fergus, evaluating Hayes appearance with a practiced eye.The mans a Scot, wee Fergus.Jamies voice was as calm as his face, but I heard the small note of strain in it.Whiskys what he wanted.A wise choice.With luck, he wont even notice when they hang him, Fergus muttered.The small man had slipped from the preachers grasp and fallen flat on his face in the sandy road, pulling one of his companions to his knees; the last prisoner, a tall young man, stayed on his feet but swayed wildly from side to side, trying desperately to keep his balance.The crowd on the point roared with glee.The captain of the guard glowed crimson between the white of his wig and the metal of his gorget, flushed with fury as much as with sun.He barked an order as the drums continued their somber roll, and a soldier scrambled hastily to remove the chain that bound the prisoners together.Hayes was jerked unceremoniously to his feet, a soldier grasping each arm, and the procession resumed, in better order.There was no laughter by the time they reached the gallowsa mule drawn cart placed beneath the limbs of a huge live oak.I could feel the drums beating through the soles of my feet.I felt slightly sick from the sun and the smells.The drums stopped abruptly, and my ears rang in the silence.Ye dinna need to watch it, Sassenach, Jamie whispered to me.Go back to the wagon.His own eyes were fixed unblinkingly on Hayes, who swayed and mumbled in the soldiers grasp, looking blearily around.The last thing I wanted was to watch.But neither could I leave Jamie to see it through alone.He had come for Gavin Hayes; I had come for him.I touched his hand.Ill stay.Jamie drew himself straighter, squaring his shoulders.He moved a pace forward, making sure that he was visible in the crowd.If Hayes was still sober enough to see anything, the last thing he saw on earth would be the face of a friend.He could see; Hayes glared to and fro as they lifted him into the cart, twisting his neck, desperately looking.Gabhainn!A charaid!Jamie shouted suddenly.Hayes eyes found him at once, and he ceased struggling.The little man stood swaying slightly as the charge was read: theft in the amount of six pounds, ten shillings.He was covered in reddish dust, and pearls of sweat clung trembling to the gray stubble of his beard.The preacher was leaning close, murmuring urgently in his ear.Then the drums began again, in a steady roll.The hangman guided the noose over the balding head and fixed it tight, knot positioned precisely, just under the ear.The captain of the guard stood poised, saber raised.Suddenly, the condemned man drew himself up straight.Eyes on Jamie, he opened his mouth, as though to speak.The saber flashed in the morning sun, and the drums stopped, with a final thunk!I looked at Jamie; he was white to the lips, eyes fixed wide.From the corner of my eye, I could see the twitching rope, and the faint, reflexive jerk of the dangling sack of clothes.A sharp stink of urine and feces struck through the thick air.On my other side, Fergus watched dispassionately.I suppose he noticed, after all, he murmured, with regret.The body swung slightly, a dead weight oscillating like a plumb bob on its string.There was a sigh from the crowd, of awe and release.Terns squawked from the burning sky, and the harbor sounds came faint and smothered through the heavy air, but the point was wrapped in silence.From where I stood, I could hear the small plit  plat  plit of the drops that fell from the toe of the corpses dangling shoe.I hadnt known Gavin Hayes, and felt no personal grief for his death, but I was glad it had been quick.I stole a glance at him, with an odd feeling of intrusion.It was a most public way of accomplishing a most private act, and I felt vaguely embarrassed to be looking.The hangman had known his business; there had been no undignified struggle, no staring eyes, no protruding tongue; Gavins small round head tilted sharply to the side, neck grotesquely stretched but cleanly broken.It was a clean break in more ways than one.The captain of the guard, satisfied that Hayes was dead, motioned with his saber for the next man to be brought to the gibbet.I saw his eyes travel down the red clad file, and then widen in outrage.At the same moment, there was a cry from the crowd, and a ripple of excitement that quickly spread.Heads turned and people pushed each against his neighbor, striving to see where there was nothing to be seen.Hes gone!There he goes!Stop him!It was the third prisoner, the tall young man, who had seized the moment of Gavins death to run for his life, sliding past the guard who should have been watching him, but who had been unable to resist the gallows fascination.I saw a flicker of movement behind a vendors stall, a flash of dirty blond hair.Some of the soldiers saw it, too, and ran in that direction, but many more were rushing in other directions, and among the collisions and confusion, nothing was accomplished.The captain of the guard was shouting, face purple, his voice barely audible over the uproar.The remaining prisoner, looking stunned, was seized and hustled back in the direction of the Court of Guard as the redcoats began hastily to sort themselves back into order under the lash of their captains voice.Jamie snaked an arm around my waist and dragged me out of the way of an oncoming wave of humanity.The crowd fell back before the advance of squads of soldiers, who formed up and marched briskly off to quarter the area, under the grim and furious direction of their sergeant.Wed best find Ian, Jamie said, fending off a group of excited apprentices.He glanced at Fergus, and jerked his head toward the gibbet and its melancholy burden.Claim the body, aye?Well meet at the Willow Tree later.Do you think theyll catch him?I asked, as we pushed through the ebbing crowd, threading our way down a cobbled lane toward the merchants wharves.I expect so.Where can he go?He spoke abstractedly, a narrow line visible between his brows.Plainly the dead man was still on his mind, and he had little attention to spare for the living.Did Hayes have any family?I asked.He shook his head.I asked him that, when I brought him the whisky.He thought he might have a brother left alive, but no notion where.The brother was transported soon after the Risingto Virginia, Hayes thought, but hed heard nothing since.Not surprising if he hadnt; an indentured laborer would have had no facilities for communicating with kin left behind in Scotland, unless the bondsmans employer was kind enough to send a letter on his behalf.And kind or not, it was unlikely that a letter would have found Gavin Hayes, who had spent ten years in Ardsmuir prison before being transported in his turn.Duncan!Jamie called out, and a tall, thin man turned and raised a hand in acknowledgment.He made his way through the crowd in a corkscrew fashion, his single arm swinging in a wide arc that fended off the passersby.Mac Dubh, he said, bobbing his head in greeting to Jamie.Mrs.Claire.His long, narrow face was furrowed with sadness.He too had once been a prisoner at Ardsmuir, with Hayes and with Jamie.Only the loss of his arm to a blood infection had prevented his being transported with the others.Unfit to be sold for labor, he had instead been pardoned and set free to starveuntil Jamie had found him.God rest poor Gavin, Duncan said, shaking his head dolorously.Jamie muttered something in response in Gaelic, and crossed himself.Then he straightened, casting off the oppression of the day with a visible effort.Aye, well.I must go to the docks and arrange about Ians passage, and then well think of burying Gavin.But I must have the lad settled first.We struggled through the crowd toward the docks, squeezing our way between knots of excited gossipers, eluding the drays and barrows that came and went through the press with the ponderous indifference of trade.A file of red coated soldiers came at the quick march from the other end of the quay, splitting the crowd like vinegar dropped on mayonnaise.The sun glittered hot on the line of bayonet points and the rhythm of their tramping beat through the noise of the crowd like a muffled drum.Even the rumbling sledges and handcarts stopped abruptly to let them pass by.Mind your pocket, Sassenach, Jamie murmured in my ear, ushering me through a narrow space between a turban clad slave clutching two small children and a street preacher perched on a box.He was shouting sin and repentance, but with only one word in three audible through the noise.I sewed it shut, I assured him, nonetheless reaching to touch the small weight that swung against my thigh.What about yours?He grinned and tilted his hat forward, dark blue eyes narrowing against the bright sunlight.Its where my sporran would be, did I have one.So long as I dinna meet with a quick fingered harlot, Im safe.I glanced at the slightly bulging front of his breeches, and then up at him.Broad shouldered and tall, with bold, clean features and a Highlanders proud carriage, he drew the glance of every woman he passed, even with his bright hair covered by a sober blue tricorne.The breeches, which were borrowed, were substantially too tight, and did nothing whatever to detract from the general effectan effect enhanced by the fact that he himself was totally ignorant of it.Youre a walking inducement to harlots, I said.Stick by me; Ill protect you.He laughed and took my arm as we emerged into a small clear space.Ian!he shouted, catching sight of his nephew over the heads of the crowd.A moment later, a tall, stringy gawk of a boy popped out of the crowd, pushing a thatch of brown hair out of his eyes and grinning widely.I thought I should never find ye, Uncle!he exclaimed.Christ, there are more folk here than at the Lawnmarket in Edinburgh!He wiped a coat sleeve across his long, half homely face, leaving a streak of grime down one cheek.Jamie eyed his nephew askance.Yere lookin indecently cheerful, Ian, for having just seen a man go to his death.Ian hastily altered his expression into an attempt at decent solemnity.Oh, no, Uncle Jamie, he said.I didna see the hanging.Duncan raised one brow and Ian blushed slightly.II wasna afraid to see; it was only I had  something else I wanted to do.Jamie smiled slightly and patted his nephew on the back.Dont trouble yourself, Ian; Id as soon not have seen it myself, only that Gavin was a friend.I know, Uncle.Im sorry for it.A flash of sympathy showed in the boys large brown eyes, the only feature of his face with any claim to beauty.He glanced at me.Was it awful, Auntie?Yes, I said.Its over, though.I pulled the damp handkerchief out of my bosom and stood on tiptoe to rub away the smudge on his cheek.Duncan Innes shook his head sorrowfully.Aye, poor Gavin.Still, its a quicker death than starving, and there was little left for him but that.Lets go, Jamie interrupted, unwilling to spend time in useless lamenting.The Bonnie Mary should be near the far end of the quay.I saw Ian glance at Jamie and draw himself up as though about to speak, but Jamie had already turned toward the harbor and was shoving his way through the crowd.Ian glanced at me, shrugged, and offered me an arm.We followed Jamie behind the warehouses that lined the docks, sidestepping sailors, loaders, slaves, passengers, customers and merchants of all sorts.Charleston was a major shipping port, and business was booming, with as many as a hundred ships a month coming and going from Europe in the season.The Bonnie Mary belonged to a friend of Jamies cousin Jared Fraser, who had gone to France to make his fortune in the wine business and succeeded brilliantly.With luck, the Bonnie Marys captain might be persuaded for Jareds sake to take Ian with him back to Edinburgh, allowing the boy to work his passage as a cabin lad.Ian was not enthused at the prospect, but Jamie was determined to ship his errant nephew back to Scotland at the earliest opportunity.It wasamong other concernsnews of the Bonnie Marys presence in Charleston that had brought us here from Georgia, where we had first set foot in Americaby accidenttwo months before.As we passed a tavern, a slatternly barmaid came out with a bowl of slops.She caught sight of Jamie and stood, bowl braced against her hip, giving him a slanted brow and a pouting smile.He passed without a glance, intent on his goal.She tossed her head, flung the slops to the pig who slept by the step, and flounced back inside.He paused, shading his eyes to look down the row of towering ships masts, and I came up beside him.He twitched unconsciously at the front of his breeches, easing the fit, and I took his arm.Family jewels still safe, are they?I murmured.Uncomfortable, but safe, he assured me.He plucked at the lacing of his flies, grimacing.I would ha done better to hide them up my bum, I think.Better you than me, mate, I said, smiling.Id rather risk robbery, myself.The family jewels were just that.We had been driven ashore on the coast of Georgia by a hurricane, arriving soaked, ragged, and destitutesave for a handful of large and valuable gemstones.I hoped the captain of the Bonnie Mary thought highly enough of Jared Fraser to accept Ian as a cabin boy, because if not, we were going to have a spot of difficulty about the passage.In theory, Jamies pouch and my pocket contained a sizable fortune.In practice, the stones might have been beach pebbles so far as the good they were to us.While gems were an easy, compact way of transporting wealth, the problem was changing them back into money.Most trade in the southern colonies was conducted by means of barterwhat wasnt, was handled by the exchange of scrip or bills written on a wealthy merchant or banker.And wealthy bankers were thin on the ground in Georgia; those willing to tie up their available capital in gemstones rarer still.The prosperous rice farmer with whom we had stayed in Savannah had assured us that he himself could scarcely lay his hand on two pounds sterling in cashindeed, there was likely not ten pounds in gold and silver to be had in the whole colony.Nor was there any chance of selling one of the stones in the endless stretches of salt marsh and pine forest through which we had passed on our journey north.Charleston was the first city we had reached of sufficient size to harbor merchants and bankers who might help to liquidate a portion of our frozen assets.Not that anything was likely to stay frozen long in Charleston in summer, I reflected.Rivulets of sweat were running down my neck and the linen shift under my bodice was soaked and crumpled against my skin.Even so close to the harbor, there was no wind at this time of day, and the smells of hot tar, dead fish, and sweating laborers were nearly overwhelming.Despite their protestations, Jamie had insisted on giving one of our gemstones to Mr.and Mrs.Olivier, the kindly people who had taken us in when we were shipwrecked virtually on their doorstep, as some token of thanks for their hospitality.In return, they had provided us with a wagon, two horses, fresh clothes for traveling, food for the journey north, and a small amount of money.Of this, six shillings and threepence remained in my pocket, constituting the entirety of our disposable fortune.This way, Uncle Jamie, Ian said, turning and beckoning his uncle eagerly.Ive got something to show ye.What is it?Jamie asked, threading his way through a throng of sweating slaves, who were loading dusty bricks of dried indigo into an anchored cargo ship.And how did ye get whatever it is?Ye havena got any money, have you?No, I won it, dicing.Ians voice floated back, his body invisible as he skipped around a cartload of corn.Dicing!Ian, for Gods sake, ye canna be gambling when yeve not a penny to bless yourself with!Holding my arm, Jamie shoved a way through the crowd to catch up to his nephew.You do it all the time, Uncle Jamie, the boy pointed out, pausing to wait for us.Yeve been doing it in every tavern and inn where weve stayed.My God, Ian, thats cards, not dice!And I know what Im doing!So do I, said Ian, looking smug.I won, no?Jamie rolled his eyes toward heaven, imploring patience.Jesus, Ian, but Im glad youre going home before ye get your head beaten in.Promise me ye willna be gambling wi the sailors, aye?Ye canna get away from them on a ship.Ian was paying no attention; he had come to a half crumbled piling, around which was tied a stout rope.Here he stopped and turned to face us, gesturing at an object by his feet.See?Its a dog, Ian said proudly.I took a quick half step behind Jamie, grabbing his arm.Ian, I said, that is not a dog.Its a wolf.Its a bloody big wolf, and I think you ought to get away from it before it takes a bite out of your arse.The wolf twitched one ear negligently in my direction, dismissed me, and twitched it back.It continued to sit, panting with the heat, its big yellow eyes fixed on Ian with an intensity that might have been taken for devotion by someone who hadnt met a wolf before.I had.Those things are dangerous, I said.Theyd bite you as soon as look at you.Disregarding this, Jamie stooped to inspect the beast.Its not quite a wolf, is it?Sounding interested, he held out a loose fist to the so called dog, inviting it to smell his knuckles.I closed my eyes, expecting the imminent amputation of his hand.Hearing no shrieks, I opened them again to find him squatting on the ground, peering up the animals nostrils.Hes a handsome creature, Ian, he said, scratching the thing familiarly under the chin.The yellow eyes narrowed slightly, either in pleasure at the attention ormore likely, I thoughtin anticipation of biting off Jamies nose.Bigger than a wolf, though; its broader through the head and chest, and a deal longer in the leg.His mother was an Irish wolfhound, Ian was hunkered down by Jamie, eagerly explaining as he stroked the enormous gray brown back.She got out in heat, into the woods, and when she came back in whelp  Oh, aye, I see.Now Jamie was crooning in Gaelic to the monster while he picked up its huge foot and fondled its hairy toes.The curved black claws were a good two inches long.The thing half closed its eyes, the faint breeze ruffling the thick fur at its neck.I glanced at Duncan, who arched his eyebrows at me, shrugged slightly, and sighed.Duncan didnt care for dogs.Jamie I said.Balach Boidheach Jamie said to the wolf.Are ye no the bonny laddie, then?What would he eat?I asked, somewhat more loudly than necessary.Jamie stopped caressing the beast.Oh, he said.He looked at the yellow eyed thing with some regret.Well.He rose to his feet, shaking his head reluctantly.Im afraid your aunties right, Ian.How are we to feed him?Oh, thats no trouble, Uncle Jamie, Ian assured him.He hunts for himself.Here?I glanced around at the warehouses, and the stuccoed row of shops beyond.What does he hunt, small children?Ian looked mildly hurt.Of course not, Auntie.Fish.Seeing three skeptical faces surrounding him, Ian dropped to his knees and grabbed the beasts muzzle in both hands, prying his mouth open.He does!I swear, Uncle Jamie!Here, just smell his breath!Jamie cast a dubious glance at the double row of impressively gleaming fangs on display, and rubbed his chin.Iah, I shall take your word for it, Ian.But even sofor Christs sake, be careful of your fingers, lad!Ians grip had loosened, and the massive jaws clashed shut, spraying droplets of saliva over the stone quay.Im all right, Uncle, Ian said cheerfully, wiping his hand on his breeks.He wouldnt bite me, Im sure.His name is Rollo.Jamie rubbed his knuckles across his upper lip.Mmphm.Well, whatever his name is, and whatever he eats, I dinna think the captain of the Bonnie Mary will take kindly to his presence in the crews quarters.Ian didnt say anything, but the look of happiness on his face didnt diminish.In fact, it grew.Jamie glanced at him, caught sight of his glowing face, and stiffened.No, he said, in horror.Oh, no.Yes, said Ian.A wide smile of delight split his bony face.She sailed three days ago, Uncle.Were too late.Jamie said something in Gaelic that I didnt understand.Duncan looked scandalized.Damn!Jamie said, reverting to English.Bloody damn!Jamie took off his hat and rubbed a hand over his face, hard.He looked hot, disheveled, and thoroughly disgruntled.He opened his mouth, thought better of whatever he had been going to say, closed it, and ran his fingers roughly through his hair, jerking loose the ribbon that tied it back.Ian looked abashed.Im sorry, Uncle.Ill try not to be a worry to ye, truly I will.And I can work; Ill earn enough for my food.Jamies face softened as he looked at his nephew.He sighed deeply, and patted Ians shoulder.Its not that I dinna want ye, Ian.You know I should like nothing better than to keep ye with me.But what in hell will your mother say?The glow returned to Ians face.I dinna ken, Uncle, he said, but shell be saying it in Scotland, wont she?And were here.He put his arms around Rollo and hugged him.The wolf seemed mildly taken aback by the gesture, but after a moment, put out a long pink tongue and daintily licked Ians ear.Testing him for flavor, I thought cynically.Besides, the boy added, she kens well enough that Im safe; you wrote from Georgia to say I was with you.Jamie summoned a wry smile.I canna say that that particular bit of knowledge will be ower comforting to her, Ian.Shes known me a long time, aye?He sighed and clapped the hat back on his head, and turned to me.I badly need a drink, Sassenach, he said.Lets find that tavern.The Willow Tree was dark, and might have been cool, had there been fewer people in it.As it was, the benches and tables were crowded with sightseers from the hanging and sailors from the docks, and the atmosphere was like a sweatbath.I inhaled as I stepped into the taproom, then let my breath out, fast.It was like breathing through a wad of soiled laundry, soaked in beer.Rollo at once proved his worth, parting the crowd like the Red Sea as he stalked through the taproom, lips drawn back from his teeth in a constant, inaudible growl.He was evidently no stranger to taverns.Having satisfactorily cleared out a corner bench, he curled up under the table and appeared to go to sleep.Out of the sun, with a large pewter mug of dark ale foaming gently in front of him, Jamie quickly regained his normal self possession.Weve the two choices, he said, brushing back the sweat soaked hair from his temples.We can stay in Charleston long enough to maybe find a buyer for one of the stones, and perhaps book passage for Ian to Scotland on another ship.Or we can make our way north to Cape Fear, and maybe find a ship for him out of Wilmington or New Bern.I say north, Duncan said, without hesitation.Yeve kin in Cape Fear, no?I mislike the thought of staying ower long among strangers.And your kinsman would see we were not cheated nor robbed.Here He lifted one shoulder in eloquent indication of the un Scottishand thus patently dishonestpersons surrounding us.Oh, do lets go north, Uncle!Ian said quickly, before Jamie could reply to this.He wiped away a small mustache of ale foam with his sleeve.The journey might be dangerous; youll need an extra man along for protection, aye?Jamie buried his expression in his own cup, but I was seated close enough to feel a subterranean quiver go through him.Jamie was indeed very fond of his nephew.The fact remained that Ian was the sort of person to whom things happened.Usually through no fault of his own, but still, they happened.The boy had been kidnapped by pirates the year before, and it was the necessity of rescuing him that had brought us by circuitous and often dangerous means to America.Nothing had happened recently, but I knew Jamie was anxious to get his fifteen year old nephew back to Scotland and his mother before something did.Ah  to be sure, Ian, Jamie said, lowering his cup.He carefully avoided meeting my gaze, but I could see the corner of his mouth twitching.Yed be a great help, Im sure, but   We might meet with Red Indians!Ian said, eyes wide.His face, already a rosy brown from the sun, glowed with a flush of pleasurable anticipation.Or wild beasts!Dr.Stern told me that the wilderness of Carolina is alive wi fierce creaturesbears and wildcats and wicked panthersand a great foul thing the Indians call a skunk!I choked on my ale.Are ye all right, Auntie?Ian leaned anxiously across the table.Fine, I wheezed, wiping my streaming face with my kerchief.I blotted the drops of spilled ale off my bosom, pulling the fabric of my bodice discreetly away from my flesh in hopes of admitting a little air.Then I caught a glimpse of Jamies face, on which the expression of suppressed amusement had given way to a small frown of concern.Skunks arent dangerous, I murmured, laying a hand on his knee.A skilled and fearless hunter in his native Highlands, Jamie was inclined to regard the unfamiliar fauna of the New World with caution.Mmphm.The frown eased, but a narrow line remained between his brows.Maybe so, but what of the other things?I canna say I wish to be meeting a bear or a pack o savages, wi only this to hand.He touched the large sheathed knife that hung from his belt.Our lack of weapons had worried Jamie considerably on the trip from Georgia, and Ians remarks about Indians and wild animals had brought the concern to the forefront of his mind once more.Besides Jamies knife, Fergus bore a smaller blade, suitable for cutting rope and trimming twigs for kindling.That was the full extent of our armorythe Oliviers had had neither guns nor swords to spare.On the journey from Georgia to Charleston, we had had the company of a group of rice and indigo farmersall bristling with knives, pistols, and musketsbringing their produce to the port to be shipped north to Pennsylvania and New York.If we left for Cape Fear now, we would be alone, unarmed, and essentially defenseless against anything that might emerge from the thick forests.At the same time, there were pressing reasons to travel north, our lack of available capital being one.Cape Fear was the largest settlement of Scottish Highlanders in the American Colonies, boasting several towns whose inhabitants had emigrated from Scotland during the last twenty years, following the upheaval after Culloden.And among these emigrants were Jamies kin, who I knew would willingly offer us refuge: a roof, a bed, and time to establish ourselves in this new world.Jamie took another drink and nodded at Duncan.I must say Im of your mind, Duncan.He leaned back against the wall of the tavern, glancing casually around the crowded room.Dye no feel the eyes on your back?A chill ran down my own back, despite the trickle of sweat doing likewise.Duncans eyes widened fractionally, then narrowed, but he didnt turn around.Ah, he said.Whose eyes?I asked, looking rather nervously around.I didnt see anyone taking particular notice of us, though anyone might be watching surreptitiously; the tavern was seething with alcohol soaked humanity, and the babble of voices was loud enough to drown out all but the closest conversation.Anyones, Sassenach, Jamie answered.He glanced sideways at me, and smiled.Dinna look so scairt about it, aye?Were in no danger.Not here.Not yet, Innes said.He leaned forward to pour another cup of ale.Mac Dubh called out to Gavin on the gallows, dye see?There will be those who took noticeMac Dubh bein the bittie wee fellow he is, he added dryly.And the farmers who came with us from Georgia will have sold their stores by now, and be takin their ease in places like this, Jamie said, evidently absorbed in studying the pattern of his cup.All of them are honest menbut theyll talk, Sassenach.It makes a good story, no?The folk cast away by the hurricane?And what are the chances that at least one of them kens a bit about what we carry?I see, I murmured, and did.We had attracted public interest by our association with a criminal, and could no longer pass as inconspicuous travelers.If finding a buyer took some time, as was likely, we risked inviting robbery from unscrupulous persons, or scrutiny from the English authorities.Neither prospect was appealing.Jamie lifted his cup and drank deeply, then set it down with a sigh.No.I think its perhaps not wise to linger in the city.Well see Gavin buried decently, and then well find a safe spot in the woods outside the town to sleep.Tomorrow we can decide whether to stay or go.The thought of spending several more nights in the woodswith or without skunkswas not appealing.I hadnt taken my dress off in eight days, merely rinsing the outlying portions of my anatomy whenever we paused in the vicinity of a stream.I had been looking forward to a real bed, even if flea infested, and a chance to scrub off the grime of the last weeks travel.Still, he had a point.I sighed, ruefully eyeing the hem of my sleeve, gray and grubby with wear.The tavern door flung suddenly open at this point, distracting me from my contemplation, and four red coated soldiers shoved their way into the crowded room.They wore full uniform, held muskets with bayonets fixed, and were obviously not in pursuit of ale or dice.Two of the soldiers made a rapid circuit of the room, glancing under tables, while another disappeared into the kitchen beyond.The fourth remained on watch by the door, pale eyes flicking over the crowd.His gaze lighted on our table, and rested on us for a moment, full of speculation, but then passed on, restlessly seeking.Jamie was outwardly tranquil, sipping his ale in apparent obliviousness, but I saw the hand in his lap clench slowly into a fist.Duncan, less able to control his feelings, bent his head to hide his expression.Neither man would ever feel at ease in the presence of a red coat, and for good reason.No one else appeared much perturbed by the soldiers presence.The little knot of singers in the chimney corner went on with an interminable version of Fill Every Glass, and a loud argument broke out between the barmaid and a pair of apprentices.The soldier returned from the kitchen, having evidently found nothing.Stepping rudely through a dice game on the hearth, he rejoined his fellows by the door.As the soldiers shoved their way out of the tavern, Ferguss slight figure squeezed in, pressing against the doorjamb to avoid swinging elbows and musket butts.I saw one soldiers eyes catch the glint of metal and fasten with interest on the hook Fergus wore in replacement of his missing left hand.He glanced sharply at Fergus, but then shouldered his musket and hurried after his companions.Fergus shoved through the crowd and plopped down on the bench beside Ian.He looked hot and irritated.Blood sucking salaud, he said, without preamble.Jamies brows went up.The priest, Fergus elaborated.He took the mug Ian pushed in his direction and drained it, lean throat glugging until the cup was empty.He lowered it, exhaled heavily, and sat blinking, looking noticeably happier.He sighed and wiped his mouth.He wants ten shillings to bury the man in the churchyard, he said.An Anglican church, of course; there are no Catholic churches here.Wretched usurer!He knows we have no choice about it.The body will scarcely keep till sunset, as it is.He ran a finger inside his stock, pulling the sweat wilted cotton away from his neck, then banged his fist several times on the table to attract the attention of the servingmaid, who was being run off her feet by the press of patrons.I told the super fatted son of a pig that you would decide whether to pay or not.We could just bury him in the wood, after all.Though we should have to purchase a shovel, he added, frowning.These grasping townsfolk know we are strangers; theyll take our last coin if they can.Last coin was perilously close to the truth.I had enough to pay for a decent meal here and to buy food for the journey north; perhaps enough to pay for a couple of nights lodging.That was all.I saw Jamies eyes flick round the room, assessing the possibilities of picking up a little money at hazard or loo.Soldiers and sailors were the best prospects for gambling, but there were few of either in the taproomlikely most of the garrison was still searching the town for the fugitive.In one corner, a small group of men was being loudly convivial over several pitchers of brandywine; two of them were singing, or trying to, their attempts causing great hilarity among their comrades.Jamie gave an almost imperceptible nod at sight of them, and turned back to Fergus.What have ye done with Gavin for the time being?Jamie asked.Fergus hunched one shoulder.Put him in the wagon.I traded the clothes he was wearing to a ragwoman for a shroud, and she agreed to wash the body as part of the bargain.He gave Jamie a faint smile.Dont worry, milord; hes seemly.For now, he added, lifting the fresh mug of ale to his lips.Poor Gavin.Duncan Innes lifted his own mug in a half salute to his fallen comrade."Slinte, Jamie replied, and lifted his own mug in reply.He set it down and sighed.He wouldna like being buried in the wood, he said.Why not?I asked, curious.I shouldnt think it would matter to him one way or the other.Oh, no, we couldna do that, Mrs.Claire.Duncan was shaking his head emphatically.Duncan was normally a most reserved man, and I was surprised at so much apparent feeling.He was afraid of the dark, Jamie said softly.I turned to stare at him, and he gave me a lopsided smile.I lived wi Gavin Hayes nearly as long as Ive lived with you, Sassenachand in much closer quarters.I kent him well.Aye, he was afraid of being alone in the dark, Duncan chimed in.He was most mortally scairt of tannagachof spirits, aye?His long, mournful face bore an inward look, and I knew he was seeing in memory the prison cell that he and Jamie had shared with Gavin Hayesand with forty other menfor three long years.Dye recall, Mac Dubh, how he told us one night of the tannasq he met?I do, Duncan, and could wish I did not.Jamie shuddered despite the heat.I kept awake myself half the night after he told us that one.What was it, Uncle?Ian was leaning over his cup of ale, round eyed.His cheeks were flushed and streaming, and his stock crumpled with sweat.Jamie rubbed a hand across his mouth, thinking.Ah.Well, it was a time in the late, cold autumn in the Highlands, just when the season turns, and the feel of the air tells ye the ground will be shivered wi frost come dawn, he said.He settled himself in his seat and sat back, alecup in hand.He smiled wryly, plucking at his own throat.Not like now, aye?Well, Gavins son brought back the kine that night, but there was one beast missingthe lad had hunted up the hills and down the corries, but couldna find it anywhere.So Gavin set the lad to milk the two others, and set out himself to look for the lost cow.He rolled the pewter cup slowly between his hands, staring down into the dark ale as though seeing in it the bulk of the night black Scottish peaks and the mist that floats in the autumn glens.He went some distance, and the cot behind him disappeared.When he looked back, he couldna see the light from the window anymore, and there was no sound but the keening of the wind.It was cold, but he went on, tramping through the mud and the heather, hearing the crackle of ice under his boots.He saw a small grove through the mist, and thinking the cow might have taken shelter beneath the trees, he went toward it.He said the trees were birches, standing there all leafless, but with their branches grown together so he must bend his head to squeeze beneath the boughs.He came into the grove and saw it was not a grove at all, but a circle of trees.There were great tall trees, spaced verra evenly, all around him, and smaller ones, saplings, grown up between to make a wall of branches.And in the center of the circle stood a cairn.Hot as it was in the tavern, I felt as though a sliver of ice had slid melting down my spine.I had seen ancient cairns in the Highlands myself, and found them eerie enough in the broad light of day.Jamie took a sip of ale, and wiped away a trickle of sweat that ran down his temple.He felt quite queer, did Gavin.For he kent the placeeveryone did, and kept well away from it.It was a strange place.And it seemed even worse in the dark and the cold, from what it did in the light of day.It was an auld cairn, the kind laid wi slabs of rock, all heaped round with stones, and he could see before him the black opening of the tomb.He knew it was a place no man should come, and he without a powerful charm.Gavin had naught but a wooden cross about his neck.So he crossed himself with it and turned to go.Jamie paused to sip his ale.But as Gavin went from the grove, he said softly, he heard footsteps behind him.I saw the Adams apple bob in Ians throat as he swallowed.He reached mechanically for his own cup, eyes fixed on his uncle.He didna turn to see, Jamie went on, but kept walking.And the steps kept pace wi him, step by step, always following.And he came through the peat where the water seeps up, and it was crusted with ice, the weather bein so cold.He could hear the peat crackle under his feet, and behind him the crack!crack!of breaking ice.He walked and he walked, through the cold, dark night, watching ahead for the light of his own window, where his wife had set the candle.But the light never showed, and he began to fear he had lost his way among the heather and the dark hills.And all the time, the steps kept pace with him, loud in his ears.At last he could bear it no more, and seizing hold of the crucifix he wore round his neck, he swung about wi a great cry to face whatever followed.What did he see?Ians pupils were dilated, dark with drink and wonder.Jamie glanced at the boy, and then at Duncan, nodding at him to take up the story.He said it was a figure like a man, but with no body, Duncan said quietly.All white, like as it might have been made of the mist.But wi great holes where its eyes should be, and empty black, fit to draw the soul from his body with dread.But Gavin held up his cross before his face, and he prayed aloud to the Blessed Virgin.Jamie took up the story, leaning forward intently, the dim firelight outlining his profile in gold.And the thing came no nearer, but stayed there, watching him.And so he began to walk backward, not daring to face round again.He walked backward, stumbling and slipping, fearing every moment as he might tumble into a burn or down a cliff and break his neck, but fearing worse to turn his back on the cold thing.He couldna tell how long hed walked, only that his legs were trembling wi weariness, when at last he caught a glimpse of light through the mist, and there was his own cottage, wi the candle in the window.He cried out in joy, and turned to his door, but the cold thing was quick, and slippit past him, to stand betwixt him and the door.His wife had been watching out for him, and when she heard him cry out, she came at once to the door.Gavin shouted to her not to come out, but for Gods sake to fetch a charm to drive away the tannasq.Quick as thought, she snatched the pot from beneath her bed, and a twig of myrtle bound wi red thread and black, that shed made to bless the cows.She dashed the water against the doorposts, and the cold thing leapt upward, astride the lintel.Gavin rushed in beneath and barred the door, and stayed inside in his wifes arms until the dawn.They let the candle burn all the night, and Gavin Hayes never again left his house past sunsetuntil he went to fight for Prince Tearlach.Even Duncan, who knew the tale, sighed as Jamie finished speaking.Ian crossed himself, then looked about self consciously, but no one seemed to have noticed.So, now Gavin has gone into the dark, Jamie said softly.But we willna let him lie in unconsecrated ground.Did they find the cow?Fergus asked, with his usual practicality.Jamie quirked one eyebrow at Duncan, who answered.Oh, aye, they did.The next morning they found the poor beast, wi her hooves all clogged wi mud and stones, staring mad and lathered about the muzzle, and her sides heavin fit to burst.He glanced from me to Ian and back to Fergus.Gavin did say, he said precisely, that she looked as though shed been ridden to Hell and back.Jesus.Ian took a deep gulp of his ale, and I did the same.In the corner, the drinking society was making attempts on a round of Captain Thunder, breaking down each time in helpless laughter.Ian put down his cup on the table.What happened to them?he asked, his face troubled.To Gavins wife, and his son?Jamies eyes met mine, and his hand touched my thigh.I knew, without being told, what had happened to the Hayes family.Without Jamies own courage and intransigence, the same thing would likely have happened to me and to our daughter Brianna.Gavin never knew, Jamie said quietly.He never heard aught of his wifeshe will have been starved, maybe, or driven out to die of the cold.His son took the field beside him at Culloden.Whenever a man who had fought there came into our cell, Gavin would askHave ye maybe seen a bold lad named Archie Hayes, about so tall?He measured automatically, five feet from the floor, capturing Hayes gesture.A lad about fourteen, hed say, wi a green plaidie and a small gilt brooch.But no one ever came who had seen him for sureeither seen him fall or seen him run away safe.Jamie took a sip of the ale, his eyes fixed on a pair of British officers who had come in and settled in the corner.It had grown dark outside, and they were plainly off duty.Their leather stocks were unfastened on account of the heat, and they wore only sidearms, glinting under their coats; nearly black in the dim light save where the firelight touched them with red.Sometimes he hoped the lad might have been captured and transported, he said.Like his brother.Surely that would be somewhere in the records?I said.Did theydo theykeep lists?They did, Jamie said, still watching the soldiers.A small, bitter smile touched the corner of his mouth.It was such a list that saved me, after Culloden, when they asked my name before shooting me, so as to add it to their roll.But a man like Gavin would have no way to see the English dead lists.And if he could have found out, I think he would not.He glanced at me.Would you choose to know for sure, and it was your child?I shook my head, and he gave me a faint smile and squeezed my hand.Our child was safe, after all.He picked up his cup and drained it, then beckoned to the serving maid.The girl brought the food, skirting the table widely in order to avoid Rollo.The beast lay motionless under the table, his head protruding into the room and his great hairy tail lying heavily across my feet, but his yellow eyes were wide open, watching everything.They followed the girl intently, and she backed nervously away, keeping an eye on him until she was safely out of biting distance.Seeing this, Jamie cast a dubious look at the so called dog.Is he hungry?Must I ask for a fish for him?Oh, no, Uncle, Ian reassured him.Rollo catches his own fish.Jamies eyebrows shot up, but he only nodded, and with a wary glance at Rollo, took a platter of roasted oysters from the tray.Ah, the pity of it.Duncan Innes was quite drunk by now.He sat slumped against the wall, his armless shoulder riding higher than the other, giving him a strange, hunchbacked appearance.That a dear man like Gavin should come to such an end!He shook his head lugubriously, swinging it back and forth over his alecup like the clapper of a funeral bell.No family left to mourn him, cast alone into a savage landhanged as a felon, and to be buried in an unconsecrated grave.Not even a proper lament to be sung for him!He picked up the cup, and with some difficulty, found his mouth with it.He drank deep and set it down with a muffled clang.Well, he shall have a caithris!He glared belligerently from Jamie to Fergus to Ian.Why not?Jamie wasnt drunk, but he wasnt completely sober either.He grinned at Duncan and lifted his own cup in salute.Why not, indeed?he said.Only it will have to be you singin it, Duncan.None of the rest knew Gavin, and Im no singer.Ill shout along wi ye, though.Duncan nodded magisterially, bloodshot eyes surveying us.Without warning, he flung back his head and emitted a terrible howl.I jumped in my seat, spilling half a cup of ale into my lap.Ian and Fergus, who had evidently heard Gaelic laments before, didnt turn a hair.All over the room, benches were shoved back, as men leapt to their feet in alarm, reaching for their pistols.The barmaid leaned out of the serving hatch, eyes big.Rollo came awake with an explosive "Woof!and glared round wildly, teeth bared."Tha sinn cruinn a chaoidh ar caraid, Gabhainn Hayes," Duncan thundered, in a ragged baritone.I had just about enough Gaelic to translate this as We are met to weep and cry out to heaven for the loss of our friend, Gavin Hayes!Eisd ris!Jamie chimed in.Rugadh e do Sheumas Immanuel Hayes agus Louisa Nic a Liallainn an am baile Chill Mhartainn, ann an sgire Dhun Domhnuill, anns a bhliadhnaseachd ceud deug agus a haon!He was born of Seaumais Emmanuel Hayes and of Louisa Maclellan, in the village of Kilmartin in the parish of Dodanil, in the year of our Lord seventeen hundred and one!Eisd ris!This time Fergus and Ian joined in on the chorus, which I translated roughly as Hear him!Rollo appeared not to care for either verse or refrain; his ears lay flat against his skull, and his yellow eyes narrowed to slits.Ian scratched his head in reassurance, and he lay down again, muttering wolf curses under his breath.The audience, having caught on to it that no actual violence threatened, and no doubt bored with the inferior vocal efforts of the drinking society in the corner, settled down to enjoy the show.By the time Duncan had worked his way into an accounting of the names of the sheep Gavin Hayes had owned before leaving his croft to follow his laird to Culloden, many of those at the surrounding tables were joining enthusiastically in the chorus, shouting Eisd ris!and banging their mugs on the tables, in perfect ignorance of what was being said, and a good thing too.Duncan, drunker than ever, fixed the soldiers at the next table with a baleful glare, sweat pouring down his face.A Shasunnaich na galladh, s olc a thig e dhuibh fanaid air bs gasgaich.Gun toireadh an diabhul fhein leis anns a bhs sibh, direach do Fhirinn!!Wicked Sassenach dogs, eaters of dead flesh!Ill does it become you to laugh and rejoice at the death of a gallant man!May the devil himself seize upon you in the hour of your death and take you straight to hell!Ian blanched slightly at this, and Jamie cast Duncan a narrow look, but they stoutly shouted Eisd ris!along with the rest of the crowd.Fergus, seized by inspiration, got up and passed his hat among the crowd, who, carried away by ale and excitement, happily flung coppers into it for the privilege of joining in their own denunciation.I had as good a head for drink as most men, but a much smaller bladder.Head spinning from the noise and fumes as much as from alcohol, I got up and edged my way out from behind the table, through the mob, and into the fresh air of the early evening.It was still hot and sultry, though the sun was long since down.Still, there was a lot more air out here, and a lot fewer people sharing it.Having relieved the internal pressure, I sat down on the taverns chopping block with my pewter mug, breathing deeply.The night was clear, with a bright half moon peeping silver over the harbors edge.Our wagon stood nearby, no more than its outline visible in the light from the tavern windows.Presumably, Gavin Hayes decently shrouded body lay within.I trusted he had enjoyed his caithris.Inside, Duncans chanting had come to an end.A clear tenor voice, wobbly with drink, but sweet nonetheless, was singing a familiar tune, audible over the babble of talk.To Anacreon in heavn, where he sat in full glee, A few sons of harmony sent a petition, That he their inspirer and patron would be!When this answer arrived from the jolly old Grecian: Voice, fiddle, and flute,  No longer be mute!Ill lend you my name and inspire you to boot.The singers voice cracked painfully on voice, fiddle, and flute, but he sang stoutly on, despite the laughter from his audience.I smiled wryly to myself as he hit the final couplet,  And, besides, Ill instruct you like me to entwine,    The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchuss vine!I lifted my cup in salute to the wheeled coffin, softly echoing the melody of the singers last lines.Oh, say, does that star spangled banner yet wave    Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave?I drained my cup and sat still, waiting for the men to come out.
