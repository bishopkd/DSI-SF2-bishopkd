Her last time on the ranch.She had to be done.God help her, it had to end.She couldnt go on seeing him every day.Couldnt pour her whole life into him and expect things would stop revolving around him.Shed made him everything.And until she changed that, he would remain everything.She held on to the swing so tight the rope burned her palms, but she didnt care.It didnt come close to the pain in her heart.And nothing ever would.She sat out there until she was dried out inside.Until there was a drought inside her.She stayed until she was chilled to her bones, shaking and unable to stop.Then she got off the swing and walked back to the house.Thankfully, when she cracked open the door, Connor wasnt anywhere to be seen.She walked up the stairs, trying not to make noise, and stole into her bedroom.She moved to the bed, sliding beneath the blankets.She felt too brittle to cry now.A sob would crack her, leave her in tiny little pieces that she would never be able to sweep up and put back together.So she just lay there staring at the ceiling, her eyes burning.And along with the burning in her eyes came the pressing sensation that nothing would ever be okay again.She sat up.No, on second thought she wasnt staying here.Not tonight.Not for another second.She couldnt handle it.She took her phone off her nightstand and dialed the number she usually avoided.Her mother.Hello?Hi, Mom.Hello, Felicity.I was just about to go out.Can you call tomorrow?No.Mom.I cant call tomorrow.I need to...I need to come over.I have a date, Felicity.Liss blinked back tears.No.Listen to me.I need to come over.I need a place to stay.Please, Mom.I need you.You can still go out.I just...I need somewhere to stay.Her mother hesitated for a moment.Okay.Why dont you come on over?Thank you, Liss said.She hung up the phone and went to get her duffel bag out of the closet.She would come back for the rest of her things later.Or maybe she would ask Jack if he could help.He wasnt related to Connor, or marrying into his family, so she stood the most chance of getting his help when all this was said and done.Plus, he already knew some of what was happening, since he had borne witness.She stuffed quite a few clothes into the bag then looked and saw the prom dress hanging in her closet.It hurt just to see it.But she was taking it with her.Because it was hers, dammit.It wasnt his.She wrenched it off the hanger and stuffed it into the bag.She looked around the room, trying not to melt into a puddle of tears.Then she opened the door and walked out into the hall and down the stairs.She didnt see Connor.And that was for the best.She paused at the door and flicked on the porch light before walking outside into the night, leaving Connor, and her heart, behind.CONNOR WOKE UP, the same dream hed had the other night playing on repeat in his mind.His bed was empty.His sheets were cold, and he was sweating and shaking.Because in the dream, Liss was standing there, bathed in the porch light, looking at him, wanting something from him, and he couldnt give it.He swung his legs over the side of the mattress and stood up.He made his way over to the window and saw the porch light was on.He had turned it off earlier, he knew it.He turned away from the window and walked across his room, opening the door and stalking down the hall.The house felt wrong.It felt empty.Youre an idiot.What the hell does that mean?Except he knew exactly what it meant.He had lived in an empty house for three years.But Liss had gone to her room.Hed heard her come back inside before hed gone to sleep.She was still here.No, she isnt.He knew it then, as surely as he knew anything else.His heart clenched tight, and he walked down the hall and opened her door without bothering to knock.The bed was empty.The room was empty.He turned and strode back out, taking the stairs two at a time and going to the front door.He stood there, caught in a moment of dj vu.How many times had he done this in the middle of the night?Dreaming Eli would be on the other side.Dont open the door.He never opened the door.Because there was no point.Eli was never there.An image of Liss as shed been in the dream flashed through his mind.Looking at him, begging him.I love you.He flung the door open without another thought, and when he saw nothing but empty space the shock hit him with the force of gunfire.Hed really expected her to be there.Looking at him.Waiting for him.He walked outside, barefoot and in his underwear, down the porch stairs onto the driveway.Her car was gone.He knew it would be.But he had to make sure.Liss was gone.She wasnt there.And he was alone again.She was right.He had made a choice to let her go.But he didnt have it in him to do anything different.* * * ARE YOU DRUNK?Im asleep, Connor said, shifting his position, not entirely certain where he was or who was talking to him.Are you hungover?Connor opened his eyes and immediately shut them again.The sun was shining in his face.And he was very obviously not in his bed.In fact, he was freezing his balls off.He shifted again, becoming aware of how uncomfortable he was.Of just how stiff and sore he felt.I dont think so, he said, rubbing his eyes with the palm of his hand before he opened them again.He was outside.On his porch.Sitting in the uncushioned wooden chair that was right by the door.And Eli was standing there, arms crossed, looking disapproving.No, not hungover.Because last night came back to him far too readily.Way too clearly.And his chest hurt more than his head.Then what the hell are you doing?Was there any point in lying about it?He didnt think so.Liss left.Did she find another place to stay?Not as far as I know.Eli frowned.Then why did she leave?Because I ruin things, Connor said, sitting up straighter, pain shooting through his neck and back.I ruin everything.Yeah, that about sums it up.Sure, but she knows that.And youve been friends for long enough, and its never seemed to bother her.Big surprise, I ruined that, too, Connor said, the bitterness that had lodged itself in his chest flooding out with his words.What did you do?I slept with her.He watched his brothers face run through about four different emotions.None of them positive.You what?Please tell me I dont have to repeat that.No.Sorry.That was reflexive.Because I cant believe it.You slept with Liss?Yes.What the...Connor.If you are ready to get back out there, there were a lot better ways to go about that.It was not that simple.Its complicated.It was and continues to be complicated.Its not complicated...He could hear Lisss words echoing in his brain.Broken, soft, sad.He had made her sad.Hed spent a fair amount of time hating himself over the years, but he hated himself more now than he could ever remember.Eli was right.He should not have dragged her into this.Yes, she had jumped in with both feet, but he had kissed her first.Knowing that he couldnt give more than a physical relationship.Knowing that he was unwilling.And hed told himself all kinds of lies to make it all seem okay.Because it had felt good.Because he had felt good for the first time in so long.At her expense.So what happened?I need coffee, Connor said.I dont think Im ever going to be able to straighten my neck again.He reached back and ran his hand over his sore muscles.Then well talk inside.Eli was being stubborn, and Connor knew from experience that when Eli was stubborn there was no getting around him.Connor stood, staring his younger brother down.Fine.Eli walked past him and pushed the door open, holding it for him.Im the new sheriff, and I would appreciate a little bit of respect.Youre looking in the wrong place, Connor muttered as he walked past him and into the kitchen.Connor set about putting coffee on, ignoring Elis presence as best he could.Heart to heart conversations were not his favorite thing in the world, and he had a feeling he was headed for one.He also knew that short of chasing him out with a shotgun, he wasnt getting rid of Eli until they had it.He switched on the coffeemaker, and the sounds of imminent caffeine filled the room.Just stop, Eli said.Stop making a concerted effort to stay miserable.Connor turned to face his brother.What are you talking about?Connor, you make a serious effort to be unhappy.It doesnt take that much effort to be unhappy when you lose everything, Connor said, bristling against Elis words.Its more than that.Its more than just being sad because you miss her.You push everyone away.You do your very best not to share anything with anyone.You are committed to staying unhappy.And Ive never seen someone take that commitment more seriously than you.Go ahead and tell me how you would have acted differently, Eli.Go right ahead.But you cant guarantee that.You cant know that.Eli rocked back on his heels.I dont have to know it.I just have to convince you to knock it off.For what reason?Connor slammed his hands down on the countertop.Im serious.Give me a reason, Eli.So you dont die alone.How about that, asshole?Thats the way Im headed, anyway, isnt it?No matter what?I mean, show me an indicator that Im not.Dad is dead.Mom left.Jessie died.And Liss is...Shes gone.I cant...I cant keep people with me.Its like trying to grab on to a handful of sand.It just all drains out in the end, and youre left with a fistful of nothing.Whats the point?Eli put his hands on his hips and looked down.He took a deep breath, raised his head and met Connors eyes.The point is that when you can let go of all that, of the fear, and the anger, theres something better on the other side.Trust me.Im a lot further gone than you ever were.Eli leveled his gaze on him, his dark eyes grave.Do you love her, Connor?The question made Connors heart freeze, a cold sweat breaking out over his skin.I dont see what that has to do with anything, he said, unsure of why he couldnt just say no.He had told Liss he didnt love her, so saying it again shouldnt be hard.And yet the words wouldnt come.Its the only thing.If you love somebody, then you work the rest out.I have something pretty cynical I could say about that.There are no guarantees.You arent going to get one.But if you arent going to take any chances you might as well start digging your grave now.Because whats the point?Connor gritted his teeth.The point, Eli, is that I cannot go through something like that again.Or I really will die.Or drink myself into the ground, just like Dad.But you didnt.You went through more than he did, and you didnt.I cant, he ground out.Eli broke his hands over his face then turned away from Connor, taking a deep breath.Connor, is she dead?What the hell, Eli?Eli turned around again.Is she dead?Thats what you asked me when I told you why I couldnt make it work with Sadie.You told me that if she wasnt dead there was still hope.Take your own damn advice.Connor didnt plan his next movements, he simply acted.Next thing he knew he had his hands wrapped around the collar of Elis shirt, and he had his younger brothers back pressed hard against the kitchen wall.Dont you dare talk to me about that.Jessie is dead.Eli stared him down.Liss isnt, he said, his words hard.You arent.So stop existing like you are.That simple?No.Not that simple, Eli said, pulling out of Connors hold and tugging his shirt back down into place.After years of grieving, drinking, quitting drinking, finding someone new.Youve been through hell, I know that.But now youve reached the other side, and you can walk out.So do it.You have no fucking clue, Connor said.I have more of one than you think.You know...I saw the medical report.He took a deep breath.I know.I know about the baby.But I never said anything in case...In case I didnt know, Connor said, feeling the heat drain from his blood.Right.And Im sorry, Connor.Im so sorry.I cant imagine everything youve lost.And Ive never pretended I could.But I can tell you that you have to let go.Connor looked out the kitchen window at the trees, the wind blowing through the branches, so calm and peaceful.Because the storm was too busy raging in his chest.You havent said anything about the baby for three years, so why say something now?Because I. ..Well, with the way things have gone, how youve responded, I figured you knew.But if you didnt want to tell me, I wasnt going to force it.But now...now I have to force some things.Even if you didnt know...its something you have to get through.Its time.Dammit, Connor, youre my older brother and I admire the hell out of you.You were brave, getting married after what our lives were like, after we watched what our parents went through...No, Connor said, cutting him off, I was never all that brave.I never have been.I got married, and I held my wife at arms length until...until it was too late.And I cant...I cant do this with Liss.Shes...There is no holding her at arms length.Because shes been under my skin for years.Shes my best friend and if...if she becomes anything more shell become everything, and I cant handle that.You know, at some point, it might be good to learn from your mistakes instead of just repeating them.You think you can Monday morning quarterback my grief?I think someone has to take the time to point out that grieving is a process, and youre not getting through it.I sure as hell expect that youll love the woman you married for the rest of your life, that youll remember her birthday and that when the anniversary of her death rolls around every year youll go to visit her grave.And I damn sure expect youll think of that baby.How old he would have been, when his birthday might have been.Yeah, I expect that will stay with you forever.But I also expect that at some point you need to start arranging that pain around your life, rather than arranging your life around your pain.Pain sliced through Connors chest like a razor.Get out of my house, he said.Connor, Im reaching my hand out, and I want to save you.Liss wants to save you.For Gods sake take someones hand.An image of being at the bottom of a dark pit filled Connors mind.A hand reaching out in the darkness.But the darkness felt so safe.Such a great place to hide.Get out, Sheriff.He gestured toward the door.Eli stared him down for a moment, as though he were waiting.For something else.For a different answer.For Connor to break down in tears and pull him into a hug.He was shit out of luck there.Suit yourself.See you around.Eli turned and walked out, slamming the front door behind him.And just like that, his house was empty again.* * * LISS HAD BEEN completely stunned last night when her mother had opted to cancel her plans and stay home and listen to what was going on with Lisss life.It hadnt been the most in depth conversation, but it was more than she usually got out of her mom.Still, she knew that she couldnt stay there long term.So she was sitting in The Grind, trying not to cry crocodile tears into her coffee while she looked at apartment listings online, knowing full well that the chance of getting one was slim.Thanks to Marshall.Because, even though she was turning over a new leaf, she was still paying for that period in her life when shed been a little pushover.A hand lowered right in front of her, and another mug of coffee was placed beside her nearly empty one.She looked up and saw Cassie, the owner of The Grind, and one of Lisss clients, looking down at her, her brow wrinkled.Are you okay, Liss?Yes.No.Not at all.Oh, dear.Cassie sat down across from her.Whats up?Its a saga.It so happens that Im on a break.And my break is about saga length.Go for it.Well, I got evicted.About a month and a half ago.But the biggest problem with that is that my credit is bad because of my stupid ex boyfriend.So instead of letting me get thrown out on the streets, Connor Garrett had me move in with him.Hes my friend.He was my friend.Anyway, some things happened...and now Im looking for a place to live again.Cassie frowned.Things happened, huh?Yes.What kinds of things?The kinds of things that happen when men and women are in close quarters, Liss said.Oh.Yes, oh.So basically its all bad.If I look like I lost my best friend, its because I have lost my best friend.And Im homeless.Well, I cant help you with the best friend thing, but I might be able to help you with the homeless thing.Liss wrapped her hands around her coffee cup.You can?Jake just finished renovating the old family farmhouse, so were going to move out to the property.In fact, we started moving yesterday.Anyway, the upstairs apartment, which is huge, since we combined the two into one, will be empty.Oh, thats so nice of you...Its just that...the credit thing...I dont care about that.I know you.And Ill know where you live.I know youre stable.I use you to do my books, so you better be.Cassie told her the rent rate, which was more than fair.See?Im not giving out charity.But I do want to help you.Oh, thats fine.I can afford it.I just havent been able to find anyone to rent to me.Well, I will.Whats the point of living in a small town?If people wont cut corners and do things for you based on knowing you, rather than what a federal bureau says about you?Liss tried to force a smile.Thats a good question.Cassie, thank you so much for this.Of all the things I have to worry about right now, its nice to cross one off the list.Sorry I couldnt do more for you.Liss sighed.I suspect its one of those things that only time will take care of.And time would take care of it.It had to.That was the entire point of cutting Connor out of her life altogether.Just the thought sent a sharp pain slicing through her chest.Yes, that had to get better.Otherwise it would just be a matter of learning to live with the ache.Maybe that was what grief was.Because this was certainly grief for her.For their lost friendship, for the loss of a dream.Which meant that both she and Connor would spend the rest of their lives wandering Copper Ridge with pain in their chests.That seemed appropriate in some ways.Though she didnt wish that on him.Even now, she didnt wish it on him.She didnt wish it on herself, either, but it seemed inevitable.This seemed like the moment to call a friend, maybe Jeanette, get a gallon of ice cream and a spoon and watch chick flicks.It was what people always did in movies to get over broken hearts.But Liss didnt want to do that.She wanted to put on an oversize sweater and crawl under a blanket and never resurface.She could live forever in a cocoon of knitted yarn, never talking to anyone about what happened, never facing reality.She could resurface for hot beverages and cake, and nothing else.That sounded much better than sharing her pain and being social over a movie starring Hugh Grant.Anyway, inevitably, Hugh Grant would start talking about his feelings and sharing with his leading lady, and then Liss would just want to punch him in the teeth for daring to be so much more sensitive than the asshole she had fallen in love with.She sighed heavily and stood, breathing in deep, the sharp pain in her chest a companion to the breath, not as notable as it had been only a moment ago.This was, she had a feeling, her new normal.Pain and breathing.Is there a good time for me to come and look at the apartment?Liss asked Cassie.I can give you a key and you can go up now if you want.Liss hesitated for a moment, because it was a step toward making all of this reality.Leaving Connor for real.Which was exactly why she was going to say yes.That would be great.Thank you.Just a second.I cant leave the shop but youre welcome to poke around.Most of our stuff is gone.Just a few pieces of furniture left.Cassie hustled behind the counter and bent down, pulling a key off a little hook that was screwed into the wood cabinet.She popped back up and reached over the counter, handing the key to Liss.You can go through the store here, and use the inside stairs.Go on up, she said, smiling.Liss managed a smile back, and she felt somewhat triumphant.She followed Cassies instructions and walked up the narrow staircase that led to the apartment over the coffee shop.She put the key in the door and jiggled it, pushing the door open.It was a beautiful space.Exposed brick, wood floors, high ceilings and a large open floor plan.Way too big for one person.She wandered over to the window that faced the main street of Copper Ridge.She could see the row of little businesses that comprised the old town, the American and Oregon flags blowing in the wind, and a slice of brown sand and gray sea beyond.It was beautiful.Better than the house she lived in before.But not better than living with Connor.She had a feeling she would always long for that house.Set back in the trees, in the mountains, a testament to the hard work of the man she loved.The man who didnt love her.She turned away from the window and walked over to the couch that was positioned at the center of the room.She sank onto it slowly, resting her forearms on her thighs, leaning forward and staring straight ahead.She wasnt even sure what she was looking at.Just the empty space, maybe.Really, no matter how beautiful the apartment was, no matter how nice the view was, it didnt really matter.Not right now.But it will.It will matter.She said those words out loud, because she needed to hear them.Yes, this hurt.But she wasnt going to die.And she didnt need to sink in despair and self loathing.Her worst fear had been realized.Shed done something wrong, and it had resulted in the end of a relationship she prized.It was the thing she had worked her entire life to avoid.And yet, now that she was staring it down, she realized two things.One, it hurt a lot more than she could have imagined.And two, it wasnt about her.It was Connors baggage.Connors pain.And maybe, even without all of that, he still wouldnt have loved her.But it didnt mean there was something wrong with her.It didnt mean she should have worked harder.And failing didnt mean she was worth less.A small burst of hope settled in her heart, right next to the ache.Yes, it was terrible.And yes, she still thought the large sweater and cozy blanket seemed like viable options for her future.But she hadnt lost all her faith.She hadnt lost her faith in herself.She would get through this.Because the alternative was becoming...Well, the alternative was becoming like Connor.The alternative was holding on to hurt as if it was a lifeline, as though it was the only thing keeping you rooted to the earth.It was so tempting to hold on to the past.But if her hands were full of all that, she could never grab on to anything new.She would live.Because she deserved to.Because she deserved to be happy.No matter how the relationship with her mother, the relationship with Connor, worked out, she deserved happiness.She deserved something she didnt have to work quite so hard for.She stood up, her legs shaking, and walked back out the door and down the stairs, back into the warmth and noise of the coffee shop.There was something comforting about the sounds down there, something that she hadnt recognized only a few moments earlier.The clanking dishes, the chatter, the smiles on everyones faces, reminded her now that life went on.And thank God for that.She made her way back to the counter, back to Cassie.Its perfect.Ill take it.IT WAS SO EARLY the sun was just now creeping over the edge of the mountains, a golden band highlighting the peaks and ridges, the edges of the fir trees glowing while the valley before him remained dark.Connor maneuvered his horse through the landscape, the only sound the pounding of hooves on grass.The air was so cold it numbed his face, made his eyes burn.Which made it more difficult for him to confront the emotions that were rioting through him.Which was just how he liked it.He didnt want to feel.Didnt want to feel the emptiness in his home, and most especially not the emptiness in his chest.He didnt want to miss a woman whom he could have if he would just break free.That was the worst part.Right now he was in a hell of his own making.Because he was a fucking coward.He pulled back on his horses reins and slowed her, before stopping her completely.In some ways a death was easier than this.Not less painful, but the actions were easier.Because there was no choice to make.It was a blow dealt by life that you couldnt argue against.But this...For Gods sake take someones hand.He heard his brothers voice again, and he squeezed his eyes shut, fighting against the wave of emotion that crashed through him.The simple truth was that at a certain point his grief had become safe.It wasnt comfortable.But it was safe.Because as long as he stayed down deep in the darkest part of his pain, no new pain could touch him.Hed used his barn as evidence that caring was dangerous.Had used it as another piece for his case.But the barn had been rebuilt.And the ranching operation had gone on.And Connor was still standing in the ashes of his life, refusing to budge.He dismounted, sliding off the back of the horse, his feet planting on the soft ground without making a sound.He walked forward a few steps before stumbling, falling down onto his knee.The cold and the wet soaked through his jeans, and he didnt care.What was a little more discomfort?When Jessie had died, there had been no decisions to make.No one had asked his opinion.There had been nothing but pain and alcohol.There had been no one standing around waiting for him to decide whether or not he wanted to live without her.He was living without her.And there was nothing else that could be done.But now...now there was a decision to be made.A terrifying decision.Now he was choosing to walk through the darkness.He couldnt deny that.Hed already had the revelation that he couldnt stand still anymore.But hed applied that only to the easy things.To sex, to the ranch.Hed managed to keep little pieces of himself back there in the past, managed to grab hold of a bit of the present, and at the same time hoarding his grief.He could keep a hold of his grief and still be in the present, but there was no way he could have a future unless he released his hold on everything that was behind him.And that was really the threshold he was on right now.Did he want to exist, taking only little pieces of what felt good now?Or did he want dreams again?Hope for the future, for bigger and better things, no matter how much it might hurt if he lost them?He knew the cost of loss.Knew it better than most.Knew what it was like to lose not just the people he loved the most, but his future, his identity.Knowing that, knowing that pain, how could he possibly open himself up to that again?A picture of Lisss face swam before his eyes, and his heart clenched tight.Dammit.He loved her.He loved her already, whether he wanted to or not.And he was a fool.She had been there for him, for every moment, always.As a friend, whether or not he had been a friend in return, she had been there.And as a lover.She had been everything hed ever asked her to be, and more.Everything he wasnt worthy of.Everything he had no right to ask for.He thought back to the past three years.To every demonstration, no matter how small, of her love for him.Because it had been there.From the beginning.No matter what manner of love, she had loved him.Romantic, friendship, it was all love.And it had been in every meal shed shared with him while he sat there in silence, hungover and grumpy, the worst possible company.It had been there every time she had brought groceries to fill his cabinets, every time she had yelled at him for drinking too much.Every time she had smiled at him, for him, when he hadnt had the strength.She loved him.He had done nothing to deserve it, nothing to earn it, and she loved him.It was a gift that no man deserved, least of all him.And he had it.And he could still have it, if he hadnt fucked it up beyond repair.If only he wasnt afraid.If only he wasnt holding on.You have to let go.More words from Eli.And it was the absolute hard truth.And so he let himself remember.His engagement, that moment hed slipped the ring on her finger.His wedding and all the vows hed made, and meant from the bottom of his heart.His marriage, the good, the bad, the ugly.Finding out he was going to be a father.So terrifying and beautiful.The way that Jessie smiled, the way her blue eyes crinkled up tight.And the way she frowned when she was about to tell him off.And then he remembered the day she died.And he let himself feel it.It was like a storm inside him, and all he could do was lower his head and let it wash over him until it passed.I have to let you go, he said, even though he knew she couldnt hear him.Just in case.He had to say it just in case.Im not going to forget it.But I cant hold on anymore.Because there are people here that I have to hold on to.He stood slowly, rising along with the sun.It flooded the valley with light, the warm rays touching his skin.He closed his eyes and faced the light, taking a deep breath, letting it wash over him.And for the very first time in three years, the light of a new day touched his soul.For the very first time in three years, he felt the sun rise.* * * LISS LOCKED HER NEW apartment door and walked down the stairs, taking the door that led outside, behind The Grind.She had been moved in for a couple of days, and it was going well.In that achy, desolate kind of empty way.She sighed, her breath visible in the cold air.It was inching closer to Thanksgiving, which sounded like absolutely no fun to her.Seeing as she usually spent Thanksgiving with the Garrett clan, and she imagined that this year her invitation would be revoked.Oh, well.She could go eat in the diner by herself.Or perhaps, if she had progressed to chick flick and ice cream stage by then, she could do that.She shoved her hands into her pockets and walked around to the front of the building, heading down the street where she had parked yesterday.That was the only real problem with the apartment.Besides the emptiness and the desolation.The parking.The wind whipped across her face, pulling part of her hair from its bun, the loose strand sticking to her lips.She ran her fingers down the side of her face and tugged it free, shaking her head reflexively.Another gust whipped down the street and pushed more hair into her eyes.She slid her hand up her forehead and pushed it back, raising her gaze as she did.And then her heart stopped.Connor was standing there.Wearing a cowboy hat, a tight black T shirt and faded jeans.And his beard was gone.He was clean shaven for the first time in years.And she had to wonder if she was hallucinating him.Because he was more like the Connor she remembered.And also, she wanted to see him so badly that it wasnt too far fetched to think that he might be nothing more than a very sexy figment of her imagination.But then he started to walk toward her, and even though everything in her screamed for her to turn and go the other way, she started to walk toward him, too.And she didnt vaporize, or turn into mist, so she knew for a fact it had to be him.* * * CONNOR, SHE SAID, because she could say nothing else.He started to walk faster, closing the distance between them, and pulling her into his arms, hugging her tight.She melted into him for a few seconds then pushed back.No, she said.It isnt fair.You arent supposed to come and find me.You arent supposed to stand there looking all sexy when I cant have you.You sure as hell cannot just walk down the street and hug me.A tear slid down her cheek, and she wiped it away.You lost that right, Connor.Dont hurt me anymore.Please, dont do this to me.He took hold of her arms, gripping her tight.I dont want to hurt you.Im done with that.And Im done hurting me, too.She shook her head.I dont believe you.I got up this morning completely sober.And I hurt like hell, but I wasnt hungover.And then I went for a ride.And...I let go.Theres a difference between forgetting and releasing your hold on the past.Im not going to forget.But the funny thing is, I wasnt even really letting myself remember.I was lost in the after bit.I was lost in that moment when Eli came to the door and told me that she was gone.And that moment had become my entire life.I thought by holding on to that, I was holding on to her memory.But that was the furthest thing from the truth.I let myself forget.I let myself forget the good parts.And when I let go...I got my past back.He looked down for a moment then back up at her.Then along with that came some hope for the future.She sucked in a shaking breath, her hands trembling.She wanted to yell at him and send him away, but how could she do that now?Oh, Connor, she said, Im...Im glad to hear that.Im not finished, he said.I wasnt only clinging to my grief to try to preserve her memory.Nothing quite that selfless.I was protecting myself.Because I knew that as long as I wrapped myself up in that old pain, there would be no way any new pain could get inside.When youre living in your darkest day, then you know things cant get worse.If you dont want anything better, you cant be disappointed again.And I was a coward.Because I had you, and I let you get away.Because I was too afraid to make the choice.I told you I was tired of life just handing down sentences to me, but the simple truth is I found that a whole lot easier than getting off my ass and making a decision.But Im tired of it.Im done with it.Im making a choice, he said, his voice rough, dark eyes intent on hers.I love you, Liss.And no matter what the future holds, I want that.No matter what problems we might face, I want to love you through them.Connors words were echoing in her head, and it took her a moment to unravel them.To let the meaning fully sink in.Right now she was the one who was afraid.Because this was far and beyond anything she had ever dared fantasize.Anything she had ever dared dream of.You...you love me?So much.And that terrified me.I couldnt even let myself think it, Liss.Love is different this time around.You were my friend first, and you mean the world to me because of that.And then...then you became my lover.And I crave you.Your body, your heart, your soul.And I know the risk.I know the cost of love, and I want it anyway, and that makes this feel more exhilarating, more terrifying, more precious, than anything else Ive ever experienced.Im not the man I was a decade ago.And because of that what I want, what I expect, what I need, has changed.And what I need now, now and forever, is you.Liss threw her arms around him, kissing him deep on the lips.I need you, she said, tears falling down her cheeks.You have no idea how much.I do.Because its the same thing I feel, too.I love you, Connor.I love everything you are.I know who you were back when we were young, back before all of the sadness.And I have seen your strength, and your weaknesses, too.And I love all of that.I cant guarantee that everything will be smooth from here on out, but if there are going to be storms, well walk through them together.I know that.I believe it.I thought back on everything youve done for me in the past few years.And I am an idiot.I should never have been shocked by hearing you say that you loved me.Because you showed me.Every day you showed me.But I was too caught up in myself to get it.I was too afraid to see it.But Im not now.And Im not afraid to give it back.Is this really happening?she asked, kissing him again to make sure he was here, to make absolutely certain she wasnt hallucinating.When youve wanted something for so long, and you finally get it, sometimes its hard to believe.I know what you mean.It feels surreal to me, too.Ive been in the dark for so long, Im just kind of blinking against the light right now.But it feels really good.It feels weird to kiss you without a beard.Yeah, well, I thought it was time to let that go, too.But if you miss that, I can always grow it back.Id rather grow it for you, then just have it because I was too lazy to take care of myself anymore.I get that.We can discuss the beard later.And...I have to say something about the tattoo.Connor, I will never ask you to not love Jessie.I love her.I always will.Shes in my heart, and I expect her to be in yours.I respect the fact that you loved her enough to marry her.I respect that marriage, the fact that she was your wife.I appreciate that.But I wasnt going to talk about that.Because I already knew how you felt.I think it helps that we both love her.But...of course, its not the same now.Youre the woman I love.And I will always have Jessie in my heart, but shes not my wife now.Shes not here now.Im not in love with her now.Thats you.Only you.I need you to understand that.I have never, and I will never, wish that you were someone else.Like I said, Ive changed.What I need has changed.And youre the woman I need now.You are the woman I love now.He leaned forward, pressing a kiss to her forehead.I think we had to break our friendship down.Like melting metal.It has to lose its shape so you can make it into something new.But its all the same materials.Just like us.Were still made from the same stuff, its just in a new shape.Another tear escaped, and this time she didnt bother to wipe it away.That is the most perfect thing you couldve said.Which brings us back to the tattoo.They are Jessies flowers.But the meaning of them has changed for me over the past few days.Actually, it kind of connects back to the barn.Im listening, she said.Flowers die.People die.Barns burn.But as long as there is life, there is hope.We rebuilt the barn.I want to plant roses again.And Im in love again, when I never thought I could be.He reached out, brushed his thumb over her cheek and wiped her tear away himself.No matter how dark things get, life is still there.Love still grows.She tightened her hold on him, kissed his cheek.I know my love for you has grown.And it will only keep growing.I want to marry you, he said.And Im making an ass out of myself, because I dont have a ring with me.And I didnt get down on one knee.But I want to marry you.Liss blinked.We dont have to get married right away.Im not going to rush you into anything.Im not rushing.It took me eighteen years to get here with you.And I wont waste another minute.So do you want to marry me or not?Of course I want to marry you.I might not be the best husband.I never said I wanted the best husband.I just want my best friend.Then youre in luck.Because you have me.I wont be perfect, but I will love you.Now and forever.She reached up and took his hat off his head, putting it on her own.Thats the best promise I could ever ask for, cowboy.* * * CONNOR GARRETT WAS a grown ass man.And he knew that there was nothing to be nervous about when it came to giving good news to his family.Even so, given that he had asked Liss the question, and put a ring on her finger, only a few hours ago, he was nervous.Eli walked in, holding Sadies hand.Sadie was holding her orange and black Beavers bowl in her other hand.In behind them came Kate, followed by Jack, who was holding pizzas from a local restaurant, since dinner had been his responsibility for tonights game.Everyone stopped and stared at him and Liss when they came into the dining room.Because either directly or indirectly they all knew now what had passed between them.But nobody knew what had happened today.Liss, Sadie said, youre here.Beside him, Liss nodded.Jack looked between them.You guys are...okay?Connor cleared his throat.Actually, were more than okay.He reached down and took Lisss left hand in his, raising it slightly so that they could see the diamond on her fourth finger.I asked Liss to marry me.What?This incredulous question came from Kate, and Connor realized that the only person who might have been in the dark about recent happenings was his younger sister.We were together, then we broke up, and then he proposed, Liss said, offering a quick recap.No one ever tells me anything, Kate said.I would have told you eventually, Eli said.But I was too pissed off at him to tell the story without a lot of swear words.Like thats ever stopped you before, Kate said.The saltier parts of my vocabulary are courtesy of you and Connor, after all.True, Eli said.But back to this...Youre really getting married?Yes, Connor said, and this time he didnt have to force his smile.This time he couldnt hold it back.Eli closed the distance between them and pulled Connor into a hug, clapping him on his back twice before letting him go.Welcome back, he said, a slight mist covering his dark eyes.Connor felt a little mist in his own.Good to be back, he said, looking at Liss.Yeah, its really good to be back.So who wants to play some poker?Jack asked.Me, Kate said, scrabbling for a place at the table.Me, too, Eli said.They all took their usual seats, but he kept hold of Lisss hand.He thought back to the game theyd had a little over a month ago, when hed observed the look that had passed between Eli and Sadie, the one that made him envious down to his bones.He turned his head and looked at Liss, and she smiled at him.And that smile was like the sun breaking over the mountains all over again.He felt for a long time as if hed lost his star, as though hed lost his compass.As if hed lost his way.Oh, he might not be certain of his exact destination.But he knew for a fact he would be walking there with Liss.And that was all he needed to know.
