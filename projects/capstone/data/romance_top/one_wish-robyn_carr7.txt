Your mother doesnt love you the right way, but she loves you.He reached across the console for her hand.You have a chance to write the script here, Gracie.You write the life you want.In fact, I dont really get ityoure completely sane.Howd that happen with that prima donna of a mother?Years of therapy, she said.It was sports therapy, but you cant dump the phobias and anxieties and neuroses without some good old fashioned counseling.And there was Mamiesweet, loving Mamie.She worked for my mother and she coddled me.That explains a lot, he said.I dont want to do all the things that I, on the receiving end, couldnt bear.I understand completely, he said.I want an ordinary, happy life, she said.I am not lazy.I like your life, he said.I like the life you envision.When they finally got back to town, Troy drove the van into the alley behind the shop.No need to park in the front of the store anymorethere was no danger from the mystery man of the note.His Jeep was back there anyway.Troy, I think I need some time alone, she said.I hope you understand.I feel pretty pathetic right now.He leaned toward her and gave her a small kiss.Dont work this too long, honey.Lots of people have superannoying mothers.I know.But I need a little time.And theres no need to worry that anyone is threatening me.Lets at least talk later, he said.Ill call you.* * *  				Troy didnt have to think about it long.He went back to his apartment, cleaned up and changed clothes and drove back to Bandon.He entered the resort property on a guest pass at about six oclock.There was no answer at Winnies cottage and he asked himself where she might be.He drove around a little bit, thinking.There were five restaurants on the propertya couple of clubhouse restaurants and then fine dining.He went to the one with the view of the ocean.The matre d greeted him.Im here to meet Mrs.Dillon Banks, Troy said smoothly as if this visit was planned.I wasnt aware she was expecting a guest.This way, sir.She had a table near the window and she was alone.Her table was a bit secluded from the other diners.She wasnt eating.She had her fingers wrapped around a drink and she looked pensively out the window.Mrs.Banks, he said.She looked up at him.May I join you for a few minutes?I suppose this has something to do with my daughter.Yes, Mr.Headly.Have a seat.Have a drink.Thank you, he said, pulling out the chair opposite her.The waiter was instantly beside him.Bring me whatever Mrs.Banks is having.So, is Izzy all right?Shes a little rattled, but shes resilient.Youll have to forgive me, Mrs.Banksits hard for me to think of her as Izzy.Shes Grace to me.Grace.Yes, she said, sipping her drink.What do you do for a living, Mr.Headly?Im a high school teacher.And a part time bartender at a local beach bar.Not exactly a high profile profession, but I find teaching rewarding.And your relationship with Izz...Grace?Is it serious?Yes, he said.Im very serious about her, though we dont have marriage plans.Im not rushing into anything.That doesnt mean Im hesitant.It just means we deserve time.Tincture of time, my grandmother used to say.Are you hoping for a big inheritance?she asked forthrightly.Until very recently, I didnt know anything about Graces family.Until this very moment, inheritance never crossed my mind.He laughed uncomfortably.By the looks of you, such an event is a very long way off.She didnt make eye contact.She lifted her drink and took a sip.Her hand trembled and she used her other hand to help stabilize it.His drink arrived quickly.He took a sip.He made a face.What is this?She actually smiled.A Manhattan.With bitters.Delicious, he said, putting it down.She chuckled in spite of herself.Well, lets have it, shall we?Why are you here?What do you expect me to say?Ive never seen two women more adept at button pushing, and I have a sister and mother.Theyve had their share of standoffs.But what I saw a couple of hours ago was brutal.So, heres my question.Whats it going to take, Mrs.Banks?Is it possible for you to have some kind of decent relationship with Grace?She thought for a moment.I should be having this conversation with my daughter.Of course you should, but you havent.Grace is unhappy and if Im not mistaken, youre unhappy.There must be a way.Look, I dont expect you to understand.That theres baggage?That you have a history of conflict?That finding a compromise is difficult?Try me.Ive mediated some legendary arguments in my time.Right now, I have at least fifty teenage girls in my classes.Go ahead, lay it on me.She took another sip.Ive made mistakes with my daughter, but this time I cant afford to make another mistake.Sending her that note...It was wrong.I shouldnt have done that.I want my daughter to come home, Mr.Headly.Its imperative that she come home.But I dont want her to come out of pity.For a visit?he asked.For a very long visit.In a rash moment I thought if she felt unsafe on her own she would let me help her.I made a mistake.Shes safe.And I dont think she needs help.She was pretty clearshe doesnt like the career choices you suggested.Shes really good at what she does.And shes happy.Mr.Headly  				Mrs.Banks, he said, leaning toward her.My name is Troy.For just a minute, lets pretend were friends and that we trust each other.At the least, lets assume we both have Graces happiness and safety as our shared priority.She took another bolstering drink.Her hand continued to shake a little.Troy.I have money.Family money.Taking care of it is complicated.With money comes predators.With old money there is responsibility.When that money is IzzGraces, I frankly dont care if she spends it, gives it away, puts it to work or does what Ive been doingpreserve it and grow it.But I dont want her to be robbed or to lose it because of her inexperience.Its time for Grace to trust me.To let me show her how to manage.She has absolutely no experience in the management of wealth.She managed to buy a business and operate it at a profit, he said.Please.Dont be naive.Her father left her a trust.She used it to buy that flower shop.Troy sat back in his chair.What has that got to do with skating or broadcasting or coaching?I thought it would be best if she chose a career path with some longevity in a field she loved.But shes adamant...Youre not going to win that one, he said.I dont know why you cant open a dialogue about what it will one day take to manage your old money.She doesnt have to coach or work for the media for that to happen.And, for Gods sake, this is not urgent.Winnie Banks pierced him with her cold blue stare.Mr.Headly.Troy.I wanted Grace to come to me out of loyalty and love.I had planned to tell her once we were talking againthere isnt much time.Im ill, Mr.Headly.I have ALS.The symptoms are getting stronger every day.He was speechless.She was a young woman, early fifties, he guessed.She appeared strong, except for the tremor.She was beautiful and willful, but with ALS, the mind would be strong until the body finally gave out.You have to tell her, he finally said.Of course, she said.At once.Ive written a letter.I wrote it before we had our altercation today.I was going to have my driver take it to her tomorrow but if youre willing, you can give it to her.A bellman came to their table pushing a wheelchair.If youre not ready, I can come back anytime you like, he said.Its fine, Bruce.Im ready.She transferred herself into the chair.Will you?Take my daughter a letter?He nodded, numb from the news.Mrs.Banks, Im sorry.The letter is in my room.Can you pick it up?A few minutes later, Winnie was resettled in her cottage.Virginia, who was a maid or assistant or keeper of some kind, was there to assist her, some fresh fruit and cheese put out on her small breakfast table.The letter was on the coffee table, addressed but not stamped.She put it in his hand.Are you sure this is ready?he asked her.It begins with an apology, she said, reassuring him.Thats something easier to do in a letter, Ive found.Easier than while facing her anger.Fourteen  				Troy hadnt liked the Manhattan that hed had with Winnie but he could really use a drink.In fact, a drink in a dark bar sounded like just the thing.He didnt feel like running into friends so that eliminated Cliffs and Coopers.He parked in front of Waylans and went inside.How about a Crown.Neat, he told Waylan.And then another one.The letter to Grace was in the center console in the Jeep.There was only one dim light shining in Graces loft.She needed time alone but he was going to have to go to her.There was no way he could have that conversation with Winnie and not tell her; no way he could be in possession of that letter and not give it to her right away.But he thought it was reasonable that he have a couple of belts for both his nerves and need of courage.So he sipped slowly, dreading what had to be done.What a complicated mess.There was a lot of rage between Grace and Winnie, and now they were going to throw heartbreak into the mix.Heartbreak and impending death.And an inheritance?This was quickly getting bigger than he was.He was beginning to wish he hadnt made that drive up to the resort to confront Winnie.It might be easier not knowing.But he had thought he could help; he had thought he could be the voice of reason.The way he saw it, Grace shouldnt have such a hot button at the mere suggestion she think about a career in the figure skating industry.And Winnie should drop the subject after being told about fifty times it was out of the question.Here were two stubborn, pigheaded women.It was nine thirty when Troy called her.Grace answered sleepily.I miss you.Are you calmer now?he asked.I am.I stomped around and cried for a while, then I think I nodded off.Im exhausted.Let me come over and hold you.I dont know how to sleep alone anymore, he said.Okay, but you have to be quiet and sleepy.I dont want to talk, she said.I dont blame you.He drove around to the alley access and parked behind the Pretty Petals van.He used his own key to get in and found the loft was dark.There was an empty wineglass on the coffee table.He took the envelope from his jacket pocket and left it on the small table in her galley kitchen, left his jacket over a chair and went to the bedroom.She stirred and sat up.Hi, she said.Cant stay away from me, can you?I sure cant, he said, taking off his shoes.His pants and shirt quickly followed and he slid into bed.She rolled right into his arms and kissed him.Wow.Whatever that is on your breath, its powerful.I needed a stiff drink, he admitted.Winnie can have that effect on people.Tell me the truth.Did she make you want to run for your life?No.He pulled her into his arms.I can see the challenge, however.Close your eyes.You dont want to talk, remember?Im wiped out, she said with a yawn, snuggling against him.You are such a good pillow.I dont think I know how to sleep alone anymore, either.Just rest, baby.Im right here.Troy didnt sleep all that well, but it felt good to know that Grace did.She snored, a sure sign she was deep into sleep.He woke at five thirty, just like most mornings, and after lying quietly for a while, he got up.He brewed coffee and waited for her to wake up.It was almost an hour.Why are you up?she asked, stretching.You dont have work today!Grace, I have something to tell you, he said, sitting up straighter.I went back to the resort after I dropped you off yesterday.To see your mother.You what?Why would you do that?Get a cup of coffee, honey, and let me tell you.She was back in just seconds, sitting beside him.I went because I was really disturbed by the way you two went after each other.Not that it was uniquemy mom and sister have had a couple of good rows.But they always patched things up, even if it took a few days or even a couple of weeks.It looked like this conflict with your mom has been going on for years.True, she said.I went back to see her, to ask her what it would take to have a civilized relationship with you.You dont have to like each other, but youre mother and daughter.But that conversation didnt really happen.She knows shes made mistakes, Gracie.Big ones.And she has issues.He tapped the letter.She wrote you a letter.She was going to have it delivered to you if that flower delivery she trumped up didnt result in a conversation.She asked me to give it to you.She put down her coffee and snatched it.Do you really think that was your place?Going to see my mother?I dont know, he said honestly.It looked like you were both in pain.And it also looked perfectly ridiculous.I couldnt imagine why on earth you two had to have such a blowup over your future in the skating industry.It made no sense to me.He watched her rip open the envelope.I get it now.She started reading.She frowned angrily and made a grunt of disapproval.But then she read to the bottom of the page and looked at him with a shocked expression.She put down that page and read further.Her eyes glistened and her lips moved as she read.She lifted her gaze from the page to look at Troy.Is this true?Does she lie?Because she was taken from the restaurant where I found her back to her cottage in a wheelchair.Grace shook her head.Shes bossy and controlling and uppity.She doesnt lie.That I know of.Well, except for that note, but when confronted, she admitted it.Read it, he said, nodding to the pages.She read on, getting to the third page.She gave a huff of laughter but had to wipe her eyes at the same time.This is so Winnie.She thinks Im completely incompetent.If I dont go to San Francisco and live with her for at least six months and learn everything there is to know about her finances I will bungle it and be completely wiped out in six months after shes gone.She looked at Troy.A couple of tears ran down her cheeks.She gave her head a little forlorn shake.She really cares about me.In a completely insulting way.If shes so worried, why doesnt she just leave it all to a cat or something?She loves you.Shes just used to telling people what to do.It would get on my nerves, too.Shes a pain in the ass, Grace said with a hiccup of emotion.But she wants to make it right with you.Before...you know.Grace put down the letter.Without explaining what she was doing, she grabbed her personal cell and dialed a number.As he watched, she was pursing her lips.Theyd become red around the edges and her nose grew pink and wet.She wiped at her face.Then she spoke into the phone.Mikhail.Winnie finally found a way to break me.Shes dying.* * *  				Ray Anne had given it a lot of thought.She couldnt make Ginger less sad; she couldnt help her get beyond her grief and there was no way to replace the life that had been taken from her.But it had been nine months since the baby died and she could get her moving.When Ginger got up in the morning, she stumbled into the kitchen in her shapeless T shirt and Capri length leggings, her hair all lank and flat and ratty.Shed barely gotten down three swallows of her first cup of coffee when Ray Anne challenged her.Well, buttercup, Im taking you on an outing.Were going to Eugene for the day.Were going to shop and have a nice lunch and go to the beauty shop.Thanks, Ray, but Id rather just stay here, if you dont mind.But I do mind, honey, because weve gotta do something.What youve been doing isnt working.You need a fresher upper.She smoothed her hand over Gingers hair and resisted the urge to say Ack.A cut, some color, some new clothes.Im going to get in the shower while you have your coffee.Make yourself some cereal or toast or both.Youll need your strength.Ray, really...Im just not interested.Believe me, its necessary.Look, I dont have money to spend on clothes that dont matter, that I wont wear.Im taking care of that for now, but we have to do something about your money situation, too.Once youre fixed up a little bit, were going to find you a job.Im not sure I can...I want you to try.It doesnt have to be a fancy job.We can go out to the beach and see if Cooper and Sarah need help in the bar.Spring is here, summer is on the way and the beach gets real busy.Maybe Cliff needs a waitress or one of the businesses in town needs clerical help.But you cant look like a vagrant if you mean to work with the public.Ginger, you have to do something with your time.You cant sit around and think all the time.Its not helping.But Im not staying here!As far as I can tell, you have no idea what youre going to do or where youre going to do it.So we should just act like you need to get your life moving forward and part of that is work.Even if you leave in a few weeks.Look, Ill just call my mom, have her pack up a couple of boxes of clothes I left there and  				Ginger, honey, Im sure those clothes you left behind dont fit you any better than the ones you brought.Now, you keep an open mind and come along with me.I promise I wont force anything on you that you dont like.Im not going to make you dress like me, she added, then laughed.I dont want you to do this, Ginger said.Im not your problem.I just want to be left alone.I know, baby, she said softly.I know you just want to sink in a hole and die.Want to know how I know?Because Ive sort of been where you are.Not as bad, but still...I dont usually talk about this, but when I was real young, way younger than you, I had a baby that didnt live.She was stillborn, so I didnt get to know her, didnt get used to her.Because I was so young my folks sent me to Portland to stay with your daddy and his family until she was born.I wasnt married, still in high school, no reason everyone had to know, right?Way back then, we worried a lot more about reputations.And I wasnt real sure who the daddy was, so...Well, thereve been times in my life when I made some hasty choices.Ginger just stared at her, eyes wide, mouth open.I held her for a long time before I let her go and the nurses didnt rush me.I wasnt even going to keep herI figured she could do a lot better than me!I didnt have much going for myself back in the day.Oh, that was so long ago.But for the longest time after that I just wanted to die, myself.Then my mom and dad both died a few years later and I was so alone.And then I really did want to sink in a hole and die.I didnt know what to do.I still dont know what to do.So you know what I do when theres a tragedy?When my life is falling apart?I try really hard to do the best I can.I wake up in the morning, put my feet on the floor, walk.I put on clean clothes every day.I fix myself to look like Im getting through life even if everything inside me says I wont make it another day.I mostly pretend, have a good hour here and there, then I collapse and cry because I just cant do it, then I put my feet on the floor again and take another step.Ginger didnt say anything, but a tear ran down her cheek.When you came along, I kind of felt like an auntie.You were a gift to me.We had so much fun playing, dressing up, watching movies, going on little trips together, having sleepovers.We can do this.Ginger shook her head, another tear sliding down her cheek.Now, you dont have to tell me what I already knowgetting a haircut and a pair of jeans that actually fitthat wont help much.Its just a shallow remedy.My friend Lou says I invented shallow.Ray Anne smiled.I think shes secretly jealous I can still walk in those spike heels.Ray...Ray Anne held up a hand.I know, I get a little melodramatic.A little pushy, too.I cant fix what you feel, Gingersnap.I know I cant.But I can get you a good haircut, put you in a decent pair of jeans and get you some underwear thats not shameful just in case you ever have to be taken to an emergency room.And dont you worry about the money because if I can look at my pretty Ginger again, its worth my life savings.And if it makes you feel one inch better, its the right thing to do.Now eat something for breakfastyoure wasting away.Ill be ready to go in forty five minutes.And its going to be a busy day.* * *  				If Ginger went along with this refresher idea, she thought it was merely because Ray Anne, who she had loved so much since she was just a little girl, had revealed herself and her own losses.Ginger couldnt imagine being a pregnant teenager and giving birth to a dead baby.Of course, she also couldnt imagine giving one awaythat notion was impossible to comprehend.But then she was thirty now, and had waited so long to get married and have her baby.And the right husband had clearly been a delusion.So, to make an effort and to be kind, Ginger went with Ray Anne.Their first stop was the beauty salon.While Ray Anne had a manicure, Ginger sat in the beauticians chair.The woman, Char, took the rubber tie out of her hair and combed it out.So, what are we doing today?she asked.Ginger stared at herself.Her hair, which had always been one of her assets, looked like it had gotten thin.It was straight, lank, the color of dirty water, and lying against her too thin face.She thought she resembled an Afghan hound.I dont care, she said.I care, Ray Anne said, jumping up from the manicurists table.She needs some highlights, a couple of shades.Maybe throw in some lowlights.Bring out the bright in that strawberry blonde.And for the love of God, lets get some kind of shape in there!Layer it.And when youre ready to blow it out, dont save money on the mousse.Women in our family need a little body in our locks.Char met eyes with Ginger in the mirror.She raised one brow.That okay with you?Sure, she said, listless.Ginger couldnt deny that it felt good to have someones hands in her hair, massaging her scalp.It had probably been a year since shed had a color and cut.But she paid no attention whatsoever; she was doing this for Ray Anne.If it made Ray feel that she was doing something to help, fine.But an hour and a half later her mouth dropped open at the sight of her own reflection.Her hair was shaped along her jawline, a little shorter in the back, and it looked full and thick.The highlights made her look sun kissed and healthy.It was an easy style to maintaina circular brush, a blow dryer and some styling mousse.Not that shed bother.Now were getting somewhere, Ray Anne said, satisfied.Now, wax her brows back into shape.From there they went to Macys to the makeup counters and Ray Anne went straight to MAC.It had not missed Rays attention that Ginger hadnt packed cosmetics.Nor did she wear any.And every woman, Ray Anne said, can use a little help now and then.My God, this stuff costs a fortune!Ginger said.I just buy my stuff at the grocery store!Yes, I know, precious.Ive been meaning to have a word with you about that.That stuff turns you orange.Now, we dont need to buy the full monty at the expensive counters, but there are some things you cant do without.Your moisturizer, base, powder, lip color and mascara.That cheap mascara clumps.You need the right colors for your skin and hair.We can get things like blusher, eye shadow and lip gloss at the grocery store.Ray Anne sat her down in a chair and gave orders to the saleswoman in her black smock.Do her up.It was transforming.Ginger didnt exactly feel happier in her heart, but when she looked at herself she didnt feel like a walking corpse.Amazing, she said to her own face in the mirror.The image that came to mind was when she was getting ready for the babys funeral and her mother sat her on the closed toilet lid and put a little color in her cheeks and on her lips, saying, This is nothing more than a little superficial frosting, but it makes you look a little less like you died with the baby.And Ginger had cried so hard, she couldnt sit still for her mothers ministrations.She had wanted to die with her baby, it was that raw in her chest.But this was somehow different.All Ray Anne wanted from her was a little attempt to reenter the world of the living.It was so easy to lie in bed, to never leave the house, when every time she looked at herself she saw a dead woman.Ray Annes phone rang a few times while they were out and she briskly answered that she was spending a day with her niece but would look through her listings when she got home and follow up.While they were at Macys, Ray Anne whisked Ginger through lingerie.Do you have a preference in bras and panties?she asked.Ginger merely shook her head and Ray Anne sighed.I dont want you trying on clothes until you have the right underthings and those baggy granny panties arent going to lay right under a nice pair of pants.She poked through some brands and typesbikini, high cut, boy shorts.She handed three pairs to Ginger.Try these on while I have a look through the bras.Ginger did as she was told.She was a little startled by the difference in her body with silky, colorful panties that fit.By the time Ray Anne arrived in the fitting room with bra samples she was able to say something positive.I like them all.Well, that was easy.Ray Anne handed Ginger four bras to try.Then she took all of the underwear with them to the womens wear department next door.Ray Anne didnt even bother selecting but went straight to the saleslady, who she apparently knew.She asked to see a few things in Gingers size.Id take that to be about a four, the saleslady said.Is that right, dear?She had been a ten or twelve.Her hips had been wide, her booty a little on the big and round side and shed always had this issue with her thighs.And that was before shed been pregnant.She had no idea what size she was now.Sure, she said.Ray Anne made her put on new underwear, giving the saleslady the price tags for purchase.Then she took Gingers old underwear away and Ginger had the feeling she was never going to see them again.The saleswoman put Ginger in a pair of slim jeans with a plain white silky tee and, over that, a pink denim bomber jacket with silver buttons.She had to stand up on her toes to be tall enough for the hem of the jeans but the effect was, well, shocking.You look eighteen, Ray Anne said.In fact, she did.Next, another pair of jeans, different brand, a black blouse, a white V necked sweater.Not a heavy sweaterlightweight for spring and summer.Again, amazing.Then came black pants with a tunic style long sleeved top.Sleeves pushed up, it was so pretty.It was something a person could wear out to dinner, if a person ever went out to dinner again in her life.A few more slacks, a few more tops, a few more jackets or sweaters.Then the saleslady held up a dress.I wish youd try this on, she said.Ive been dying to see it on someone with your figure.Its so streamlined.It was dark purple with yellow piping across the shoulders to the edge of capped sleeves and down the side seams.There was a gold, slightly glittery pattern embossed on part of the front.It was diamond shaped and in an abstract design, from right below the mandarin collar to right below the waist.It was the most beautiful thing.Oh, I dont need a dress.Plus, she said, looking at the tag, its much too expensive.Put it on, Ginger, Ray Anne commanded.It was stunning.Ginger felt a little like a princess.Then she reminded herself that she couldnt be a princess or feel that beautiful.She was in mourning.Its irresistible, Ray Anne said.Now just dont bring us any more clothes.Ginger, put on those jeans with the white tee and pink jacket.Youre wearing it to lunch and then home.Ray, dont throw out my jeans.Of course not, darling.You might need them for the next time you paint a house.Well stop in the shoe department and then well have a lovely lunch together.She looked at her watch.Good, the lunch crowd will have passed and not only will it be quiet, its late enough in the day that we can manage with something light for dinner much later.She examined her phone.Looks like Im going to be on the phone and computer after we get back to Thunder Point.For a Realtor and property manager a day with a lot of phone calls is a good day.They were alone in the dressing room and in a whisper she hoped wouldnt be overheard, Ginger spoke.Ray Anne, I appreciate all this so much, I do.But you cant rescue me from grief with a few new outfits and a haircut.Ray Anne gave her a pitying look.No one knows that better than I do, Gingersnap.But the other thing I know is that you have two choicesyou can grieve that useless ex husband and your precious lost baby forever or you can do what you must to move on and make life bearable.Because, honey, were stuck with life.Ginger positioned her arms as though cradling a baby in her arms.When I put my arms like this, I can still feel the weight of his tiny head right there, in the crook.Sugar, thats not ever going away.Youre not going to forget.Youre just going to carry on.Its not easy.Its all you can do.She blinked.Now I think we need some shoes and some guacamole.You get dressed.Im going to deal with the receipts.Fifteen  				When Grace called Mikhail, he asked for the details of this dying.So she read the letter, though she stumbled from time to time.My Dear Izzy,  				First of all, Im very sorry about my harsh words when you retired from skating.I didnt mean it, you know I didnt.Shock and disappointment got the best of me.And I apologize about the mysterious note.I knew it would frighten you.I actually hoped it would.I think I must have had a stroke of some kind, that something like that would make perfect sense to me.Then you would come to me and I would pull all the right stringsyou would feel safe again with my protection.A fools game.I apologize.I wanted you to come home but not because you pitied me.I am sorry about the years of arguments about skating and, if not skating, coaching or consulting or reporting or judging.Every time we get through with one of those conversations, with one of those power struggles, I am filled with hate for myself and anger with you.Its the worst feeling and I always pledge never to allow myself to do that again.And yet I have.There is a reason.Not an excuse, but a reason.I learned a couple of years ago that I have ALS.For a while the symptoms were manageable and it was easy to imagine it would be years before it would matter.And I resolved to use those years to lure you back to your roots.It wasnt so much that I wanted you to compete.It was that I wanted you to be secure.I have always known I wouldnt be alive forever, but never panicked that my time was short.You are the only heir to this old Dillon money.Your half brother is not a part of my family and your father settled with him generously before and after his death.There is no one else, Izzy.Its only you.And to my embarrassment, Ive never acquainted you with the complications and responsibilities associated with this legacy.Ive been managing since my parents died, before you were even a teenager.The work is immense.The threat of cons and predators and incompetent advisors is constant.People will take advantage of you.Steal from you if you even blink.Even charities will use you.Frankly, I dont care if you spend it all on something that makes you happy, but I worry that if I dont do my job you could lose it or be swindled.Thats why I want your undivided attention for a few months.It is complex and youll find there are decisions to be made.This ALS is hard.The symptoms are coming faster now.Im an athlete at the core and even when I stopped competing, my body never betrayed me before.I was always competent and confident and now I dont dare cross the street alone.The jitters and weakness and trembling and unbelievable fatigue are getting the best of me.I dont know how much time there is.We should get this thing between us settled once and for all.Its not important that one of us wins, Izzy.Its very important that we forgive each other.Before its too late.Before we cant go back.Love,  				Mother  				When she was finished, still wiping away the occasional tear as she read, she heard Mikhail curse.She had noticed that Troy wandered into the kitchen for more coffee, lingering at the coffeepot with his back turned to her as if it was painful to listen.Mikhail said something she didnt understand.Sheet of the gods.I will come.Where do I come?She laughed through her tears.Shit of the gods?When he was himself, when he wasnt pushing her to do more, do better, he could make her laugh and love him.Why come, Mikhail?she asked.Theres nothing you can do.I can see her one time.She made my life when she gave me you.I am now best coach.I was not best coach before you.He grunted.But is Winifred.Will be hard.Where do I come?Well, I live in one and a half rooms, but Winnie is in a nice house at a resort in Bandon, close by.She has bedrooms.She will not have me, he said.She is diva.Where is this Brandon?Its Bandon.Oregon.Oregon?Did we skate in this Oregon?Grace smiled.Mikhail was a Russian immigrant; his US geography wasnt great.They used to study the map before every competition.He was much better with Europe and Asia than the US.We did not.Its about an eight hour drive north of San Francisco.She brought her car and driver.Before you buy a ticket, let me be sure Winnie goes for this idea.Just make me a place to stay.Some dirty hotel will do.I just need empty room.Bed would be nice.How can you get away so suddenly?Did you say someone is dying?Ah, is good time.Best matches are coming in fall.Right now I can be spared.For a little while, not forever.I have only terrible athletes now.Maybe they get nervous and work harder if I ignore them, eh?I can throw a little pout so they think I quit, yes?Then we see what we see!Dont tell Winifred.She hates me.She loves you, Grace said.That is love?She has the hardest love in my experience.Yeah.I know.She sighed.I think you can fly into Eugene.That could be closest.But really, you dont have to  				In Russia, is important to pay gratitude.Otherwise, there might not be a place for me when my time comes.When she disconnected, Troy came back to sit beside her on the couch.You okay?he asked.She nodded.Im going to have to see her.Will you come with me?Ill take you, he said.But Im not going to sit with you while you talk to your mother.I think she feels this is personal family business.What am I going to do?Im not going to San Francisco to live with her!You can do whatever you have to do, Gracie.No matter what you decide to do, the sad reality is that its not forever.Be sure that in the end you dont have any regrets.Thats all.* * *  				Grace hung a sign on the flower shop door.Closed for the Day.Open Tomorrow 9:00 a. m.  She put her work cell number at the bottom for phone orders.Troy was determined not to be involved, at least not at this point.He dropped her at the cottage Winnie occupied and he left.He said he wouldnt be far away and she could call him.Hed come back when she needed him.Winnie was comfortably settled on a chaise longue in her bedroom, a soft throw around her shoulders and a pillow under her knees.She had a book in her lap, but it was closed.Virginia let Grace into the room.You look very comfortable, Grace said, kissing her mothers cheek.She lifted the book.The one thing I thought Id do with all this godforsaken leisure time was read, but do you suppose I can concentrate?Grace laughed and sat on the upholstered bench at the end of the bed.Skating wasnt the only gift you gave me, you know.I love to read and I suppose a lot of that is because of you.On all those long trips we took, you always had a book going.You packed books.You read during practice and in the car on long rides.And now I cant seem to focus.You will once we get a few details organized.I wanted to bring you flowers but since I brought you five hundred dollars worth yesterday, it seemed ridiculous.I kept the smashed arrangement and sent the other three to hospitals and nursing homes, she said, having the grace to blush slightly.Theyre beautiful, Izzis it really Grace now?It is.And thank you.She took a breath, shaking her head.Oh, Mother.The drama.You could have just told me the moment you knew.Instead of fighting we could have planned how wed manage the time.I didnt quit skating because of you.I competed as long as I did because of you.And I dont hate skatingI love it.But I was done with so many aspects of the trials.They were rightIzzy Banks couldnt take the pressure.Winnie sighed.They say the mind is not affected by ALS.Theyre wrong.Ive made some foolish decisions in the past couple of years.Ive snapped at you in anger and lived to regret it.But thats not all.Ive flown as far as Switzerland for a miracle cure when my specialist assured me all along the research hasnt caught up with the power of this disease.Well, I guess youre lucky you had that option to fly to Switzerland.Does your specialist do anything for you?Ive been taking a drug to slow the progression, but its not going to cure me and there comes a time...Grace, youll need genetic testing.You should be prepared.Grace nodded.What is Virginias role?Nurse?Shes an assistant.Shes been with me for three years and now she does far more for me than she bargained for.I hired her as a secretary but she exceeded my expectations.Shes a genius with the computer.Grace tilted her head and smiled.Is that so?Shes amazing.And she knows shell be looking for work before long.Grace knew that anyone who worked closely with Winnie or inside the house went through complete background checks and came with high recommendations.Winnie was a genius at hiring the best people.Just look at what Mikhail was able to accomplish for her.When you say before long...How long will I live?I have no idea.Six months?A year?If I live a year, it wont be a good year.Ive already had more time than eighty percent of ALS patients.But Virginia knows her way around files and names and accounts.She can help you with thatshes managed all of my correspondence for a couple of years now.And she will be replaced with a nurse sometime soon.In San Francisco?Grace asked.Its where Ive lived since you were twelve years old, she said.Isnt that big house getting a little overwhelming?What do you mean?Winnie asked.Its just thatdoesnt it take quite an army to keep that place going?Indeed, Winnie said with a curl of the lip.Mother...Mama...I called Mikhail and hes coming.He wants to see you.She stiffened in shock.Why?Well, aside from the fact that hes fond of you?He also believes he owes his reputation to you.It was because you hired him that he had such success.Now, heres what I need to knowhow long are you staying here?In Bandon?I can have this cottage for another week, but I was going to go home as soon as possible.Hopefully, you will be coming with me.Grace shook her head.I have commitments.For this week, I have lots of orders.After that theres a wedding out of townone that Ive been looking forward to.If I had an emergency, there are several florists who would be happy to take my orders.In fact, for the out of town wedding, Mamie and Ross could do the jobthey trained me.Im aware, Winnie said, and not happily.I want to tell you about my business, Mama, she said.Let me make us some tea.Grace started with an idea right after reading her mothers letter and that idea grew as she thought about it.She understood that many people would think running a small flower shop could be a little boutique business, a small scale and simple operation.And that was true, it could be.But it could be more, depending on who operated the business.Iris had told her that when her mother operated that little shop, they could barely squeak by financiallyRose had done little more than create floral arrangements for the locals who were familiar with her.Grace had grown the shop significantly, hiring a marketing firm to assist in PR with computer marketing, coupons, specials, advertising in bridal catalogs and in bridal stores, not to mention a website.Shed implemented a creative and complicated computer program to minimize the time spent on demonstrating what was available along with pricing.She was an expert in buying the finest and most cost effective flora and her designs were definitely among the most beautiful.Why else would brides come from towns surrounding Thunder Point rather than going to their own neighborhood florists?All of her accounting was computerized and she had not run through the trust her father had left.After buying the store and renovating the loft to live in, she had some modest investments that were managed by a wealth management firm.She hoped the work she was doing would keep her quite nicely for the rest of her life, but it was possible she could actually expand if the notion suited her lifestyle.And what about this boyfriend?Winnie asked.Troy?Hes the most wonderful man, but I thought wed talk about my business, Mama.Its really important to me that you know Im not dabbling to pass the time.I love it, Im serious about it, Im good at it.Im one of the best, Mama.I realize its not the career you would choose for me, but its not a waste of time.And depending on how I run it, it can be very successful.Will you come to see it?This week?Of course, Grace, she said.Id like to see your store.Now tell me about this man.Does he know youre very wealthy?Grace sighed.Well, Rome wasnt built in a day.Until yesterday neither of us knew I even had the potential to be wealthy.Apparently Troy found out first.I read your letter this morning.You must have known that I  				Number one, you and I have barely spoken in five years and when we did, it didnt go well and, number two, I have always thought of you as...Her voice trailed off and, unexpectedly, tears gathered in her eyes.Thought of me as what, Grace?Winnie asked.Im twenty eight.Youre fifty one.I thought youd live forever.To at least ninety five.I thought Id live through at least two face lifts, Winnie said sourly.I havent even had my first yet!Grace let go a huff of laughter, but she had to wipe her eyes.I was planning to be the best preserved ninety year old in the city, Winnie said.Just tell me about your young man, Grace.Grace took a deep breath, wiped her eyes and carried on.The woman I bought the shop from became my best friendIris.Shes a high school counselor and shes married to the sheriffs deputy in charge of the substation in our little town.I met Troy through Irishes a high school history teacher.He makes light of it, as if its just something he does to fill the days and finance his adventureshe loves everything from river rafting to skiing to rock climbing.I think hes into every sport but figure skating and surfing.But when Iris talks about Troys teaching she describes him as the most dedicated teacher she knows.He doesnt just teach them history, he keeps an eye on them, paying close attention to any issues that need intervention.He watches for signs of abuse, bullying, drug and alcohol use, any problems teenagers might have.Iris says Troy would make an outstanding guidance counselorhis instincts are right on.There are students whose lives are changed because of Troys skills as an educator.You had good teachers, Winnie said defensively.Probably, but its not the teachers I think about when I look back and examine the choices Ive made, when I think about the opportunities and accomplishments.Its the coaches.Ive had two of the best.* * *  				Grace called Troys cell and asked him if hed join her and her mother for lunch at one of the resort restaurants.He was pleased to do that and he showed up at the cottage to push Winnies wheelchair.Winnie might not be ready to admit it, but Troy charmed her.He made her laugh and her eyes twinkled.If there was a sweeter, kinder and funnier man, Grace had never met him.And he was completely sincere, Grace felt that in her heart.On the way back to Thunder Point, she asked him what he would do if money were no object.Grace, that is such a remote possibility for me, Ive never even thought about it.I have no idea.Probably something fun and irresponsible.But youre the most responsible person I know.You work hard, you save, you measure every penny.Thats because in my life, money has always been hard to come by.I learned to be careful at an early age.Grace and Troy were back in Thunder Point by three, but Grace didnt open the shop.Instead, she made and returned a few phone calls, and then she went upstairs to her apartment and got on the laptop, researching ALS.At six, Troy showed up with crab cakes and salad from Cliffs and a bottle of wine.They talked about all shed learned in just a few hours of research, how much more she should know, including the need for genetic testing.Im going to do a little more reading tonight, Grace said.Would this be a good night for me to spend at my place?he asked.Can you stay?Im not going to read all night.And tomorrow Im going to work in the shop in the morning and in the afternoon Im going to close the shop and drive over to Eugene to pick up Mikhail.Hes going to stay at the resort with my mother for two or three days.And what will you be doing?Will you spend the evening with them?Maybe part of the evening, but I think it would be best if I let them catch up.Would you like to join us?I dont think so.But I hope Ill meet him before he leaves.Why dont you let me keep the shop open till five or so.I can sell what you have on hand, then Im due to help Cooper for the next couple of nights.Troy, did you plan to go somewhere?Is my sudden crisis keeping you from doing something fun with your spring break?You think Id run out on you now?Gracie, I think the way you handle this is one of the most important things youll ever do.Because?she asked, but she knew.She just wanted him to put it into words for her.Because you have this one chance to get things right between the two of you.And you should take it.Right, she agreed.I hope I dont really screw it up.And I hope I dont mess things up with you, because youre pretty important to me.Im a big boy, Gracie.Dont worry about me.Ill stick with you while you go through this.And after Im through it?she asked.After?You might be living an entirely different life.Lets see what all this means.I gather theres a fortune involved.And not a small one.Troy, that doesnt matter.You cant imagine that it would matter.You cant say that yet.Thats one of those questions that will have to be answered when its not just talk, when its real.But for now, while you try to sort all this out, you can count on me.* * *  				That had such an ominous sound, Grace was a little nervous.Concerned enough that she didnt sleep all that well.When he took her in his arms, everything felt the sameeasy and delicious and perfect.But she suspected that Troy, like just about anyone would be, was a bit intimidated by Winnie and her money.Money that she wished to confer on Grace but only after Grace jumped through all the right hoops.What Troy didnt understand and couldnt until it was, as he said, real was that Grace had been happier since shed been on her own than ever before.And shed been happier with Troy than she thought possible.Once she was alone in her shop, when Troy was off doing his own thing, she placed a call to Ray Anne Dysart.Everyone knew Ray Anne was the person to contact for real estate needs.She wasnt sure how to phrase her request exactly.She asked Ray Anne if she had time to stop by Pretty Petals this morning.She wanted to talk about property for rent or sale.Ray Anne walked in not too long after, and with her was a pretty blonde woman.Hi, Grace said with a smile.Grace, meet my niece, Ginger.Not really my niece, but almost.My cousin Dickie is like a brother to me and this is his daughter.Ginger is staying with me for a while.After the brief introductions, Ray Anne was all business.How can I help you?Ready for a little more space than your darling loft?Not exactly.I love my little loft.My mother lives in San Francisco and shes up here for a visit.Shes staying at the Dunes in one of their beautiful little cottages.And shes handicapped.Shes not getting around well and the San Francisco house isnt the best for her disability.She can barely manage the stairs and its only going to get worse, and soon.Of course Id like her to be closer.Im afraid she has a progressive degenerative disease, and we dont know how much time there is.Oh, Grace, Ray Anne said, hand to her heart.
