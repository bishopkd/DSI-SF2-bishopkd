No, thanks.Ill be too nervous to eat until after the presentation with Cross.By then whatever you pick up will be hours old.How about a protein smoothie, then?Itll give you some easy fuel until you can eat.Thatd be great.His smile lit up his dark eyes.Something that goes good with vodka, just to get me in the mood.Anything you dont like?Any allergies?Nada.Okay.See you in an hour.I knew just the place to go.The deli I had in mind was a couple blocks up and offered smoothies, salads, and a variety of made to order paninis with quick service.I headed downstairs and tried not to think about Gideons radio silence.Id kind of expected to hear something after the Magdalene incident.Getting no reaction had me worrying all over again.I pushed out to the street through the revolving door and scarcely paid any attention to the man who climbed out of the back of a town car at the curb until he called my name.Turning, I found myself facing Christopher Vidal.OhHi, I greeted him.How are you?Better, now that Ive seen you.You look fantastic.Thanks.I can say the same to you.As different as he was from Gideon, he was gorgeous in his own way with his mahogany waves, grayish green eyes, and charming smile.He was dressed in loose fitting jeans and a cream V neck sweater, a very sexy look for him.Are you here to see your brother?I asked.Yes, and you.Me?Heading to lunch?Ill join you and explain.I was briefly reminded of Gideons warning to stay away from Christopher, but by now I figured he trusted me.Especially with his brother.Im going to a deli up the street, I said.If youre game.Absolutely.We started walking.What did you want to see me about?I asked, too curious to wait.He reached into one of two large cargo pockets of his jeans and pulled out a formal invitation in a vellum envelope.I came to invite you to a garden party were having at my parents estate on Sunday.A mix of business and pleasure.Many of the artists signed to Vidal Records will be there.I was thinking itd be great networking for your roommate hes got the right look for music video.I brightened.That would be wonderful!Christopher grinned and passed the invite over.And youll both have fun.No one throws a party like my mother.I glanced briefly at the envelope in my hand.Why hadnt Gideon said anything about the event?If youre wondering why Gideon didnt tell you about it, he said, seemingly reading my mind, its because he wont come.He never does.Even though hes the majority shareholder in the company, I think he finds the music industry and musicians too unpredictable for his tastes.By now, you know how he is.Dark and intense.Powerfully magnetic and hotly sexual.Yes, I knew how he was.And he preferred to know what he was getting into at all costs.I gestured at the deli when we reached it, and we stepped inside and got in line.This place smells awesome, Christopher said, his gaze on his phone as he typed out a quick text.The aroma delivers on its promise, trust me.He smiled a delightful boyish smile that I was sure knocked most women on their asses.My parents are really looking forward to meeting you, Eva.Oh?Seeing the photos of you and Gideon over the last week has been a real surprise.A good surprise, he qualified quickly when I winced.Its the first time weve seen him really into someone hes dating.I sighed, thinking he wasnt so into me right now.Had I made a terrible mistake by leaving him alone last night?When we reached the counter, I ordered a grilled vegetable and cheese panini with two pomegranate smoothies, asking them to hold the one with a protein shot for thirty minutes so I could eat in.Christopher ordered the same, and we managed to find a table in the crowded deli.We talked about work, laughing over both a recent baby food commercial faux blooper that had gone viral and some backstage anecdotes about acts Christopher had worked with.The time passed swiftly, and when we parted ways at the entrance of the Crossfire, I said good bye with genuine affection.I headed up to the twentieth floor, and found Mark still at his desk.He offered me a quick smile despite his air of concentration.If you dont really need me, I said, I think itd be good for me to sit this presentation out.Although he tried to hide it, I saw the lightning quick flash of relief.It didnt offend me.Stress was stress, and my volatile relationship with Gideon was something Mark didnt need to think about while he was working on an important account.Youre golden, Eva.You know that?I smiled and set the drink carrier down in front of him.Drink your smoothie.Its really good, and the protein will keep you from feeling too hungry for a little bit longer.Ill be at my desk if you need me.Before I put my purse in the drawer, I texted Cary to ask if he had plans on Sunday or if hed like to go to a Vidal Records party.Then I got back to work.Id started organizing Marks files on the server, tagging them and placing them in directories to make it easier for us to assemble portfolios on the fly.When Mark left for the meeting with Gideon, my heartbeat quickened and a clutch of anticipation tightened my stomach.I couldnt believe my excitement just from knowing what Gideon was doing at that particular moment, and that hed have to think of me when he saw Mark.I hoped Id hear from him after that.My mood picked up at the thought.For the next hour, I was restless waiting to hear how things had gone.When Mark reappeared with a big grin and a spring in his step, I stood up in my cubicle and applauded him.He took a gallant, exaggerated bow.Thank you, Miss Tramell.Im so stoked for you!Cross asked me to give you this.He handed me a sealed manila envelope.Come to my office and Ill give you all the deets.The envelope had weight and rattled.I knew from touch what Id find inside before I opened it, but still the sight of my keys sliding out and into my palm hit me hard.Gasping with a pain more intense than any I could remember, I read the accompanying note card.Thank you, Eva.For everything.Yours, G   A Dear Jane brush off.It had to be.Otherwise, he wouldve given me the keys after work on the way to the gym.There was a dull roaring in my ears.I felt dizzy.Disoriented.I was frightened and agonized.Furious.I was also at work.Closing my eyes and clenching my fists, I pulled myself together and fought off the driving urge to go upstairs and call Gideon a coward.He probably saw me as a threat, someone whod come in, unwanted and uninvited, and shook up his orderly world.Someone whod demanded more from him than just his hot body and hefty bank account.I shut my emotions behind a glass wall where I was aware of them waiting in the background, but I was able to get through the rest of my workday.By the time I clocked out and headed downstairs, I still hadnt heard from Gideon.I was such an emotional disaster at that point I felt only a single, sharp twinge of despair as I exited the Crossfire.I made it to the gym.I shut my brain off and ran full bore on the treadmill, fleeing the anguish that would hit me soon enough.I ran until sweat coursed in rivulets down my face and body, and rubber legs forced me to stop.Feeling battered and exhausted, I hit the showers.Then I called my mother and asked her to send Clancy to the gym to pick me up for our appointment with Dr.Petersen.As I put my work clothes back on, I mustered the energy to get through that last task before I could go home and collapse on my bed.I waited for the town car at the curb, feeling separate and apart from the city teeming around me.When Clancy pulled up and hopped out to open the back door for me, I was startled to see my mom already inside.It was early yet.Id expected to be driven solo to the apartment she shared with Stanton and wait on her twenty minutes or so.That was our usual routine.Hey, Mom, I said wearily, settling on the seat beside her.How could you, Eva?She was crying into a monogrammed handkerchief, her face beautiful even while reddened and wet with tears.Why?Jolted out of my torment by her misery, I frowned and asked, What did I do now?The new cell phone, if shed somehow found about it, wouldnt trigger this much drama.And it was too soon after the fact for her to know about my breakup with Gideon.You told Gideon Cross aboutwhat happened to you.Her lower lip trembled with distress.My head jerked back in shock.How could she know that?My GodHad she bugged my new place?My purse?What?Dont act clueless!How do you know I told him?My voice was a pained whisper.We just talked last night.He went to see Richard about it today.I tried to picture Stantons face during that conversation.I couldnt imagine my stepfather taking it well.Why would he do that?He wanted to know whats been done to prevent information leaks.And he wanted to know where Nathan is  She sobbed.He wanted to know everything.My breath hissed out between my teeth.I wasnt sure what Gideons motivation was, but the possibility that hed dumped me over Nathan and was now making sure that he was safe from scandal hurt worse than anything.I twisted in pain, my spine arching away from the seatback.Id thought it was his past that drove a wedge between us, but it made more sense that it was mine.For once I was grateful for my mothers self absorption, which kept her from seeing how devastated I was.He had a right to know, I managed in a voice so raw it sounded nothing like my own.And he has a right to try and protect himself from any blowback.Youve never told any of your other boyfriends.Ive never dated anyone who makes national headlines by sneezing, either.I stared out the car window at the traffic that boxed us in.Gideon Cross and Cross Industries are global news, Mother.Hes light years away from the guys I dated in college.She spoke more, but I didnt hear her.I shut down for self protection, cutting off the reality that was suddenly too painful to be endured.Dr.Petersens office was exactly as I remembered.Decorated in soothing neutrals, it was both professional and comfortable.Dr.Petersen was the same a handsome man with gray hair and gentle, intelligent blue eyes.He welcomed us into his office with a wide smile, commenting on how lovely my mother looked and how like her I was.He said he was happy to see me again and that I looked well, but I could tell he spoke for my mothers benefit.He was too trained an observer to miss the raging emotions I suppressed.So, he began, settling into his chair across from the sofa my mother and I sat on.What brings you both in today?I told him about the way my mom had been tracking my movements via my cell phone signal and how violated I felt.Mom told him about my interest in Krav Maga and how she took it as a sign that I wasnt feeling safe.I told him about how theyd pretty much taken over Parkers studio, which made me feel suffocated and claustrophobic.She told him Id betrayed her trust by divulging deeply personal matters to strangers, which made her feel naked and painfully exposed.Through it all, Dr.Petersen listened attentively, took notes and spoke rarely, until wed purged everything.Once wed quieted, he asked, Monica, why didnt you tell me about tracking Evas cell phone?The angle of her chin altered, a familiar defensive posture.I didnt see anything wrong with it.Many parents track their children through their cell phones.Underage children, I shot back.Im an adult.My personal time is exactly that.If you were to envision yourself in her place, Monica, Dr.Petersen interjected, would it be possible that you might feel as she does?What if you discovered someone was monitoring your movements without your knowledge or permission?Not if the someone was my mother and I knew it gave her peace of mind, she argued.And have you considered how your actions affect Evas peace of mind?he queried gently.Your need to protect her is understandable, but you should discuss the steps you wish to take openly with her.Its important to gain her input and expect cooperation only when she chooses to give it.You have to honor her prerogative to set limits that may not be as broad as youd like them to be.My mother sputtered indignantly.Eva needs her boundaries, Monica, he continued, and a sense of control over her own life.Those things were taken from her for a long time and we have to respect her right to establish them now in the manner that best suits her.Oh.My mother twisted her handkerchief around her fingers.I hadnt thought of it that way.I reached out for my mothers hand when her lower lip trembled violently.Nothing couldve stopped me from talking to Gideon about my past.But I could have forewarned you.Im sorry I didnt think of it.Youre much stronger than I ever was, my mother said, but I cant help worrying.My suggestion, Dr.Petersen said, would be for you to take some time, Monica, and really think about what sorts of events and situations cause you anxiety.Then write them down.My mother nodded.When you have what will surely not be an exhaustive list but a strong start, he went on, you can sit down with Eva and discuss strategies for addressing those concerns strategies you can both live with comfortably.For example, if not hearing from Eva for a few days troubles you, perhaps a text message or an e mail will alleviate that.Okay.If you like, we can go over the list together.The back and forth between the two made me want to scream.It was insult to injury.I hadnt expected Dr.Petersen to smack some sense into my mom, but Id hoped he would at least take a harder line God knew someone needed to, someone whose authority she respected.When the hour ended and we were on our way out, I asked my mom to wait a moment so I could ask Dr.Petersen one last personal and private question.Yes, Eva?He stood in front of me, looking infinitely patient and wise.I just wondered I paused, needing to swallow past a lump in my throat.Is it possible for two abuse survivors to have a functional romantic relationship?Absolutely.His immediate, unequivocal answer forced the trapped air from my lungs.I shook his hand.Thank you.When I got home, I unlocked my door with the keys Gideon had returned to me and I went straight to my room, offering a lame wave to Cary, who was practicing yoga in the living room to a DVD.I stripped off my clothes as I crossed the distance from my closed bedroom door to the bed, finally crawling between the cool sheets in just my underwear.I hugged a pillow and closed my eyes, so tired and drained I had nothing left.The door opened at my back and a moment later Cary sat beside me.He brushed my hair back from my tear streaked face.Whats the matter, baby girl?I got kicked to the curb today.Courtesy of a fucking note card.He sighed.You know the drill, Eva.Hes going to keep pushing you away, because hes expecting you to fail him like everyone else has.And I keep proving him right.I recognized myself in the description Cary had just given.I ran when the going got tough, because I was so sure it was all going to end badly.The only control I had was to be the one who left, instead of the one who was left behind.Because youre fighting to protect your own recovery.He lay down and spooned against my back, wrapping one leanly muscular arm around me and tucking me tight against him.I snuggled into the physical affection I hadnt realized I needed.He mightve dumped me because of my past, not his.If thats true, its good its over.But I think you two will find each other eventually.At least Im hoping you will.His sigh was soft on my neck.I want there to be happily ever afters for the fucked up crowd.Show me the way, Eva honey.Make me believe.15  Friday found Trey sharing breakfast with Cary and me after an overnighter.As I drank the days first cup of coffee, I watched him interact with Cary and I was genuinely thrilled to see the intimate smiles and covert touches they gave one another.Id had easy relationships like that and hadnt appreciated them at the time.They had been comfortable and uncomplicated, but theyd been superficial in a fundamental way, too.How deep could a love affair get if you didnt know the darkest recesses of your lovers soul?That was the dilemma Id faced with Gideon.Day 2 After Gideon had begun.I found myself wanting to go to him and apologize for leaving him yet again.I wanted to tell him I was there for him, ready to listen or simply offer silent comfort.But I was too emotionally invested.I got wounded too easily.I was too afraid of rejection.And knowing he wouldnt let me get too close only intensified that fear.Even if we did figure things out, Id only tear myself apart trying to live with just the bits and pieces he decided to share with me.At least my job was going well.The celebratory lunch the executives gave in honor of the agency landing the Kingsman account made me genuinely happy.I felt blessed to work in such a positive environment.But when I heard that Gideon had been invited although no one expected him to show up I returned quietly to my desk and focused on work the rest of the afternoon.I hit the gym on the way home; then picked up some items to make fettuccini alfredo for dinner with crme brule for dessert comfort food guaranteed to put me in a carbohydrate coma.I expected sleep to offer me a break from the endless what ifs my brain was recycling, hopefully long into Saturday morning.Cary and I ate in the living room with chopsticks, his idea to cheer me up.He said dinner was great, but I couldnt tell.I snapped out of it when he fell silent, too, and I realized I was being a less than stellar friend.When are the Grey Isles campaign ads going up?I asked.Im not sure, but get this He grinned.You know how it is with male models were tossed around like condoms at an orgy.Its tough to stand out from the crowd, unless youre dating someone famous.Which Im suddenly reported to be doing since those photos of you and me were plastered everywhere.Im the side piece of action in your relationship with Gideon Cross.Youve done wonders for making me a hot commodity.I laughed.You didnt need my help for that.Well, it certainly didnt hurt.Anyway, they called me back for a couple more shoots.I think they might just use me for more than five minutes.Well have to celebrate, I teased.Absolutely.When youre up for it.We ended up hanging out and watching the original Tron.His smartphone rang twenty minutes into the movie and I heard him speaking to his agency.Sure.Ill be there in fifteen, tops.Ill call you when I get there.Got a job?I asked after hed hung up.Yeah.A model showed up for a night shoot so trashed hes worthless.He studied me.You wanna come?I stretched my legs out on the couch.Nope.Im good right here.You sure youre okay?All I need is mindless entertainment.Just the thought of getting dressed again exhausts me.Id be happy wearing my flannel pajama bottoms and holey old tank top all weekend.As much as I hurt inside, total comfort outside seemed like a necessity.Dont worry about me.I know Ive been a mess lately, but Ill get it together.Go on and enjoy yourself.After Cary rushed out, I paused the movie and went to the kitchen for some wine.I stopped by the breakfast bar, my fingertips gliding over the roses Gideon had sent me the previous weekend.Petals fell to the countertop like tears.I thought about cutting the stems and using the flower food packet that came with the bouquet, but it was pointless hanging on to them.Id throw the arrangement away tomorrow, the last reminder of my equally doomed relationship.Id gotten farther with Gideon in one week than I had with other relationships that lasted two years.I would always love him for that.Maybe Id always love him, period.And one day, that might not hurt so badly.Rise and shine, sleepyhead, Cary singsonged as he yanked the comforter off of me.Ugh.Go away.Youve got five minutes to get your ass up and in the shower, or the showers coming to you.Opening one eye, I peeked at him.He was shirtless and wearing baggy pants that barely clung to his hips.As far as wake up calls went, he was prime.Why do I have to get up?Because when youre flat on your back youre not on your feet.Wow.That was deep, Cary Taylor.He crossed his arms and shot me an arch look.We need to go shopping.I buried my face in the pillow.No.Yes.I seem to remember you saying this was a Sunday garden party and rock star gathering in the same sentence.What the hell do I wear to something like that?Ah, well.Good point.What are you wearing?II dont know.I was leaning toward the English tea with hat look, but now Im not so sure.He gave a brisk nod.Right.Lets hit the shops and find something sexy, classy, and cool.Growling a token protest, I rolled out of bed and padded over to the bathroom.It was impossible to shower without thinking of Gideon, without picturing his perfect body and remembering the desperate sounds he made when he came in my mouth.Everywhere I looked, Gideon was there.Id even started hallucinating black Bentley SUVs all around town.I thought I spotted one damn near everywhere I went.Cary and I had lunch; then we bounced all over the city, hitting the best of the Upper East Side thrift stores and Madison Avenue boutiques before taking a taxi downtown to SoHo.Along the way, Cary had two teenage girls ask for his autograph, which tickled me more than him, I think.Told you, he crowed.Told me what?They recognized me from an entertainment news blog.One of the posts about you and Cross.I snorted.Glad my love life is working out for someone.He was due at another job around three and I went with him, spending a few hours in the studio of a loud and brash photographer.Remembering it was Saturday, I slipped into a far corner and made my weekly call to my dad.You still happy in New York?he asked me above the background noise of dispatch talking over the radio in his cruiser.So far so good.A lie, but the truth helped no one.His partner said something I didnt catch.My dad snorted and said, Hey, Chris insists he saw you on television the other day.Some cable channel, celebrity gossip thing.The guys wont leave me alone about it.I sighed.Tell them watching those shows is bad for their brain cells.So youre not dating one of the richest men in America?No.What about your love life?I asked, quickly diverting.Are you seeing anyone?Nothing serious.Hang on.He responded to a call on the radio, then said, Sorry, sweetheart.I have to run.I love you.Miss you like crazy.I miss you, too, Daddy.Be careful.Always.Bye.I killed the call and went back to my former spot to wait for Cary to wrap things up.In the lull, my mind tormented me.Where was Gideon now?What was he doing?Would Monday bring me an inbox full of photos of him with another woman?Sunday afternoon I borrowed Clancy and one of Stantons town cars for the drive out to the Vidal estate in Dutchess County.Leaning back in the seat, I looked out the window, absently admiring the serene vista of rolling meadows and green woodlands that stretched to the distant horizon.I realized I was working on Day 4 After Gideon.The pain Id felt the first few days had turned into a dull throbbing that felt almost like the flu.Every part of my body ached, as if I was going through some sort of physical withdrawal and my throat burned with unshed tears.Are you nervous?Cary asked me.I glanced at him.Not really.Gideon wont be there.Youre sure about that?I wouldnt be going if I thought otherwise.I do have some pride you know.I watched him drum his fingers on the armrest between our two seats.For all the shopping wed done yesterday, hed made only one purchase: a black leather tie.Id teased him mercilessly about it, he of the perfect fashion sense going with something like that.He caught me looking at it.What?You still dont like my tie?I think it works well with the emo jeans and my lounge lizard jacket.Cary my lips quirked you can wear anything.It was true.Cary could pull any look off, a benefit of having a sculpted rangy body and a face that could make angels weep.I set my hand over his restless fingers.Are you nervous?Trey didnt call last night, he muttered.He said he would.I gave his hand a reassuring squeeze.Its just one missed call, Cary.Im sure it doesnt mean anything serious.He couldve called this morning, he argued.Treys not flakey like the others Ive dated.He wouldnt have forgotten to call, which means he just doesnt want to.The rat bastard.Ill be sure to take lots of pictures of you having a great time looking sexy, classy, and cool to torment him with on Monday.His mouth twitched.Ah, the deviousness of the female mind.Its a shame Cross wont see you today.I think I got a semi when you came out of your room in that dress.Eww!I smacked his shoulder and mock glared when he laughed.The dress had seemed perfect to both of us when wed found it.It was cut in a classic garden party style fitted bodice with a knee length skirt that flared out from the waist.It was even white with flowers.But thats where the tea and crumpets style ended.The edginess came from the strapless form, the alternating layers of black and crimson satin underskirts that gave it volume, and the black leather flowers that looked like wicked pinwheels.Cary had picked the red Jimmy Choo peep toe pumps out of my closet and the ruby drop earrings to give it all the finishing touch.Wed decided to leave my hair loose around my shoulders, in case we arrived and learned that hats were required.All in all, I felt pretty and confident.Clancy drove us through an imposing set of monogrammed gates and turned into a circular driveway, following the direction of a valet.Cary and I got out by the entrance, and he took my arm as my heels sank into blue gray gravel on the walk to the house.Upon entering the Vidals sprawling Tudor style mansion, we were warmly greeted by Gideons family in a receiving line his mother, stepfather, Christopher, and their sister.I took in the sight, thinking the Vidal family could only look more perfect if Gideon was lined up with them.His mother and sister had his coloring, both women boasting the same glossy obsidian hair and thickly lashed blue eyes.They were both beautiful in a finely wrought way.Eva!Gideons mother drew me toward her, then air kissed both of my cheeks.Im so pleased to finally meet you.What a gorgeous girl you are!And your dress.I love it.Thank you.Her hands brushed over my hair, cupped my face, and then slid down my arms.It was hard for me to bear it, because touching was sometimes an anxiety trigger for me when the person was a stranger.Your hair, is it naturally blond?Yes, I replied, startled and confused by the question.Who asked a question like that of a stranger?How fascinating.Well, welcome.I hope you have a wonderful time.Were so glad you could make it.Feeling strangely unsettled, I was grateful when her attention moved to Cary and zeroed in.And you must be Cary, she crooned.Here Id been certain my two boys were the most attractive in the world.I see I was wrong about that.You are simply divine, young man.Cary flashed his megawatt smile.Ah, I think Im in love, Mrs.Vidal.She laughed with throaty delight.Please.Call me Elizabeth.Or Lizzie, if youre brave enough.Looking away, I found my hand clasped by Christopher Vidal Senior.In many ways, he reminded me of his son, with his slate green eyes and boyish smile.In others, he was a pleasant surprise.Dressed in khakis, loafers, and a cashmere cardigan, he looked more like a college professor than a music company executive.Eva.May I call you Eva?Please do.Call me Chris.It makes it a little easier to distinguish between me and Christopher.His head tilted to the side as he contemplated me through quirky brass spectacles.I can see why Gideon is so taken with you.Your eyes are a stormy gray, yet theyre so clear and direct.Quite the most beautiful eyes I think Ive ever seen, aside from my wifes.I flushed.Thank you.Is Gideon coming?Not that Im aware of.Why didnt his parents know the answer to that question?We always hope.He gestured at a waiting servant.Please head back to the gardens and make yourself at home.Christopher greeted me with a hug and a kiss on the cheek, while Gideons sister Ireland sized me up in a sulky way that only a teenager could pull off.Youre a blonde, she said.Jeez.Was Gideons preference for dark haired women a damn law or something?And youre a very lovely brunette.Cary offered me his arm and I accepted it gratefully.As we walked away, he asked me quietly, Were they what you expected?His mom, maybe.His stepdad, no.I looked back over my shoulder, taking in the elegant floor length cream sheath dress that clung to Elizabeth Vidals svelte figure.I thought of what little I knew about Gideons family.How does a boy grow up to be a businessman who takes over his stepfathers family business?Cross owns shares in Vidal Records?Controlling interest.Hmm.Maybe it was a bailout?he offered.A helping hand during a trying time for the music industry?Why not just give him the money?I wondered.Because hes a shrewd businessman?With a sharp exhalation, I waved the question away and cleared my mind.I was attending the party for Cary, not Gideon, and I was going to keep that first and foremost in my thoughts.Once wed moved outside, we found a large, elaborately decorated marquee erected in the rear garden.Although the day was beautiful enough to stay out in the sun, I found a seat at a circular table covered in white damask instead.Cary patted my shoulder.You relax.Ill network.Go get em.He moved away, intent on his agenda.I sipped champagne and chatted with everyone who stopped by to strike up a conversation.There were a lot of recording artists at the party whose work I listened to, and I watched them covertly, a bit starstruck.For all the elegance of the surroundings and the endless number of servants, the overall vibe was casual and relaxed.I was starting to enjoy myself when someone Id hoped never to see again stepped out of the house onto the terrace: Magdalene Perez, looking phenomenal in a rose hued chiffon gown that floated around her knees.A hand settled on my shoulder and squeezed, setting my heart racing because it reminded me of the night Cary and I had gone to Gideons club.But the figure that rounded me this time was Christopher.Hey, Eva.He took the chair next to mine and set his elbows on his knees, leaning toward me.Are you having fun?Youre not mingling much.Im having a great time.At least I had been.Thank you for inviting me.Thank you for coming.My parents are stoked youre here.Me, too, of course.His grin made me smile, as did his tie, which had cartoon vinyl records all over it.Are you hungry?The crab cakes are great.Grab one when the tray comes by.Ill do that.Let me know if you need anything.And save a dance for me.He winked, and then hopped up and away.Ireland took his seat, arranging herself with the practiced grace of a finishing school graduate.Her hair fell in a single length to her waist and her beautiful eyes were direct in a way I could appreciate.She looked worldlier than her seventeen years.Hi.Hello.Wheres Gideon?I shrugged at the blunt question.Im not sure.She nodded sagely.Hes good at being a loner.Has he always been that way?I guess.He moved out when I was little.Do you love him?My breath caught for a second.I released it in a rush and said simply, Yes.I thought so when I saw that video of you two in Bryant Park.She bit her lush lower lip.Is he fun?You knowto hang around with?Oh.Well God.Did anyone know Gideon?I wouldnt say hes fun, but hes never boring.The live band began playing Ive Got You Under My Skin and Cary appeared beside me as if by magic.Time to make me look good, Ginger.Ill try my best, Fred.I smiled at Ireland.Excuse me a minute.Three minutes, forty seconds, she corrected, displaying some of her familys expertise in music.Cary led me onto the empty dance floor and pulled me into a swift foxtrot.It took me a minute to get into it, because Id been stiff and tight with misery for days.Then the synergy of longtime partners kicked in and we glided across the floor with sweeping steps.When the singers voice faded with the music, we stopped, breathless.We were pleasantly surprised by applause.Cary gave an elegant bow and I held on to his hand for stability as I dipped into a curtsy.When I lifted my head and straightened, I found Gideon standing in front of me.Startled, I stumbled back a step.He was seriously underdressed in jeans and an untucked white dress shirt that was open at the collar and rolled up at the sleeves, but he was so damn fine he still put every other man in attendance to shame.The tremendous yearning I felt at the sight of him overwhelmed me.Distantly I was aware of the bands singer pulling Cary away, but I couldnt tear my gaze away from Gideon, whose wildly blue eyes burned into mine.What are you doing here?he snapped, scowling.I recoiled from his harshness.Excuse me?You shouldnt be here.He grabbed me by the elbow and started hauling me toward the house.I dont want you here.If hed spit in my face, it couldnt have devastated me more.I yanked my arm free of him and walked briskly toward the house with my head held high, praying I could make it to the privacy of the town car and Clancys protective watch before the tears started falling.Behind me, I heard a come hither female voice call out Gideons name and I sent up a prayer that the woman would stall him long enough for me to get out without further confrontation.I thought I just might make it when I passed into the cool interior of the house.Eva, wait.My shoulders hunched at the sound of Gideons voice and I refused to look at him.Get lost.I can show myself out.Im not done   I am!I pivoted to face him.You dont get to talk to me that way.Who do you think you are?You think I came here for you?That I was hoping Id see you and youd throw me a goddamn scrap or bonesome pathetic acknowledgment of my existence?Maybe Id be able to harass you into a quick, dirty fuck in a corner somewhere in a pitiful effort to win you back?Shut up, Eva.His gaze was scorching hot, his jaw tight and hard.Listen to me   Im only here because I was told you wouldnt be.Im here for Cary and his career.So you can go back to the party and forget about me all over again.I assure you, when I walk out the door, Ill be doing the same to you.Shut your damned mouth.He caught me by the elbows and shook me so hard my teeth snapped together.Just shut up and let me talk.I slapped him hard enough to turn his head.Dont touch me.With a growl, Gideon hauled me into him and kissed me hard, bruising my lips.His hand was in my hair, fisting it roughly, holding me in place so I couldnt turn away.I bit the tongue he thrust aggressively into my mouth, then his lower lip, tasting blood, but he didnt stop.I shoved at his shoulders with everything I had, but I couldnt budge him.Goddamn Stanton!If not for him and my crazy assed mother, Id have had a few Krav Maga classes under my belt by now  Gideon kissed me as if he was starved for the taste of me and my resistance began to melt.He smelled so good, so familiar.His body felt so perfectly right against mine.My nipples betrayed me, hardening into tight points, and a slow, hot trickle of arousal gathered in my core.My heart thundered in my chest.God, I wanted him.The craving hadnt gone away, not even for a minute.He picked me up.Imprisoned by his tight grip, it was hard to breathe and my head began to spin.When he carried me through a door and kicked it shut behind him, I couldnt do more than make a feeble sound of protest.I found myself pressed against a heavy glass door on the other side of a library, Gideons hard and powerful body subduing my own.His arm at my waist slid lower, his hand delving beneath my skirts and finding the curves of my butt exposed by my lacy boy shorts underwear.He wrenched my hips hard to his, making me feel how hard he was, how aroused.My sex trembled with want, achingly empty.All the fight left me.My arms fell to my sides, my palms pressing flat to the glass.I felt the brittle tension drain from his body as I softened in surrender, the pressure of his mouth easing and his kiss turning into a passionate coaxing.Eva, he breathed gruffly.Dont fight me.I cant take it.My eyes closed.Let me go, Gideon.He nuzzled his cheek against mine, his breath gusting hard and fast over my ear.I cant.I know youre disgusted by what you saw the other nightwhat I was doing to myself   Gideon, no!God.Did he think I left him because of that?Thats not why   Im losing my mind without you.His lips were gliding down my neck, his tongue stroking over my racing pulse.He sucked on my skin and pleasure radiated through me.I cant think.I cant work or sleep.My body aches for you.I can make you want me again.Let me try.Tears slipped free and ran down my face.They splashed on the upper swell of my breasts and he licked at them, lapping them away.How would I ever recover if he made love to me again?How would I survive if he didnt?I never stopped wanting you, I whispered.I cant stop.But you hurt me, Gideon.You have the power to hurt me like no one else can.His gaze was stark and confused on my face.I hurt you?How?You lied to me.You shut me out.I cupped his face, needing him to understand this one thing without question.Your past doesnt have the power to push me away.Only you can do that, and you did.I didnt know what to do, he rasped.I never wanted you to see me like that  Thats the problem, Gideon.I want to know who you are, the good and the bad, and you want to keep parts of yourself hidden from me.If you dont open up, were going to lose each other down the road and I wont be able to take it.Im barely surviving it now.Ive crawled through the last four days of my life.Another week, a monthItll break me to give you up.I can let you in, Eva.Im trying.But your first response when I screw up is to run away.You do it every time and I cant stand feeling like any moment Im going to do or say something wrong and youre going to bolt.His mouth was tender again as he brushed his lips back and forth over mine.I didnt argue with him.How could I, when he was right?I hoped youd come back on your own, he murmured, but I cant stay away anymore.Ill carry you out of here if I have to.Whatever it takes to get you back in the same room with me, talking this out.My heart stuttered.You were hoping Id come back?I thoughtYou gave me back my keys.I thought we were over.He pulled back, his face set in fierce lines.Well never be over, Eva.I looked at him, my heart aching like an open wound at how beautiful he was, how broken and in pain he was pain Id caused to some degree.On tiptoes, I kissed the reddened handprint Id left on his cheek, clutching his thick silky hair in my hands.Gideon bent his knees to align our bodies, his breathing harsh and erratic.Ill do whatever you want, whatever you need.Anything.Just take me back.Maybe I should have been scared by the depth of his need, but I felt the same passionate insanity for him.Running my hands down his chest in an effort to soothe his trembling, I gave him the hard truth.We cant seem to stop making each other miserable.I cant keep doing this to you and I cant keep going through these crazy highs and lows.We need help, Gideon.Were seriously dysfunctional.I saw Dr.Petersen on Friday.Hes going to take me on as a patient, and if you agree hell take us both on as a couple.I figured if you can trust him, I can try.Dr.Petersen?I remembered the brief jolt Id felt at seeing a black Bentley SUV when Clancy pulled away from the doctors office.At the time, Id told myself it was wishful thinking.After all, there were countless black SUVs in New York.You had me followed.His chest expanded on a deep breath.He didnt deny it.I bit back my anger.I could only imagine how terrible it must be for him to be so dependent on something someone he couldnt control.What mattered most at that moment were his willingness to try and the fact that it wasnt just talk.Hed actually taken steps.Its going to be a lot of work, Gideon, I warned him.Im not afraid of work.He was touching me restlessly, his hands sliding over my thighs and buttocks as if caressing my bare skin was as necessary to him as breathing.Im only afraid of losing you.I pressed my cheek to his.We completed each other.Even now, as his hands roamed possessively over me, I felt a thawing in my soul, the desperate relief of being held finally by the man who understood and satisfied my deepest, most intimate desires.I need you.His mouth was sliding over my cheek and down my throat.I need to be inside you  No.My God.Not here.But my protest sounded weak even to my own ears.I wanted him anywhere, anytime, any way  It has to be here, he muttered, dropping to his knees.It has to be now.He chafed my skin ripping the lace of my panties away; then he shoved my skirts to my waist and licked my cleft, his tongue parting my folds to stroke over my throbbing clit.I gasped and tried to recoil, but there was nowhere to go.Not with the door at my back and a grimly determined Gideon in front, one hand keeping me pinned while the other lifted my left leg over his shoulder, opening me to his ardent mouth.My head thudded against the glass, heat pulsing through my blood from the point where his tongue was driving me mad.My leg flexed against his back, urging him closer, my hands cupping his head to hold him still as I rocked into him.Feeling the rough satin strands of his hair against my sensitive inner thighs was its own provocation, heightening my awareness of everything around me  We were in Gideons parents house, in the midst of a party attended by dozens of famous people, and he was on his knees, growling his hunger as he licked and sucked my slick, aching cleft.He knew just how to get to me, knew what I liked and needed.He had an understanding of my nature that went above and beyond his incredible oral skills.The combination was devastating and addicting.My body shook, my eyelids heavy from the illicit pleasure.GideonYou make me come so hard.His tongue rubbed over and over the clenching entrance to my body, teasing me, making me grind shamelessly into his working mouth.His hands cupped my bare butt, kneading, urging me onto his tongue as he thrust it inside me.There was reverence in the greedy way he enjoyed me, the unmistakable sense that he worshipped my body, that pleasuring it and taking pleasure from it was as vital to him as the blood in his veins.Yes, I hissed, feeling the orgasm building.I was buzzed by champagne and the heated scent of Gideons skin mixed with my own arousal.My breasts strained within the increasingly too tight confines of my strapless bra, my body trembling on the edge of a desperately needed orgasm.Im so close.A movement on the far side of the room caught my eye and I froze, my gaze locking with Magdalenes.She stood just inside the door, halted midstride, staring wide eyed and open mouthed at the back of Gideons moving head.But he was either oblivious or too impassioned to care.His lips circled my clit and his cheeks hallowed.Sucking rhythmically, he massaged the hypersensitive knot with the tip of his tongue.Everything tightened viciously, then released in a fiery burst of pleasure.The orgasm poured through me in a scorching wave.I cried out, pumping my hips mindlessly into his mouth, lost to the primal connection between us.Gideon held me up as my knees weakened, tonguing my quivering flesh until the last tremor faded.When I opened my eyes again, our audience of one had fled.Standing in a rush, Gideon picked me up and carried me to the couch.He dropped me lengthwise on the cushion; then hauled my hips up to rest on the armrest, arching my spine.I eyed him up the length of my torso.Why not just fold me over and fuck me from behind?Then he ripped open his button fly and pulled his big, beautiful penis out, and I didnt care how he took me just so long as he did.I whimpered as he shoved into me, my body struggling to accommodate the wonderful fullness I craved.Yanking my hips to meet his powerful thrusts, Gideon battered my tender sex with that brutally thick column of rigid flesh, his gaze dark and possessive, his breath leaving him in primitive grunts every time he hit the end of me.A trembling moan left me, the friction of his drives stirring my never sated need to be fucked senseless by him.Only him.A handful of strokes and his head fell back as he gasped my name, his hips rolling to stir me into a frenzy.Squeeze me, Eva.Squeeze my dick.When I complied, the ragged sound he made was so erotic my sex trembled in appreciation.Yeah, angeljust like that.I tightened around him and he cursed.His gaze found mine, the stunning blue hazed with sexual euphoria.A convulsive shudder wracked his powerful frame, followed by an agonized sound of ecstasy.His cock jerked inside me, once, twice, and then he was coming long and hard, spurting hotly into the clutching depths of my body.I didnt have time to climax again, but it didnt matter.I watched him with awe and pure female triumph.I could do this to him.In the moments of orgasm, I owned him as completely as he owned me.16  Gideon folded over me, his hair falling forward to tickle my chest, his lungs heaving.God.I cant go days without this.Even the hours at work are too long.I ran my fingers through the sweat damp roots of his hair.I missed you, too.He nuzzled my breasts.When youre not with me, I feel Dont run anymore, Eva.I cant take it.He pulled me up to stand in front of him, keeping his cock in me until the soles of my heels touched the hardwood floor.Come home with me now.I cant leave Cary.Then well drag him out of here with us.ShhBefore you complain, whatever he hopes to get out of this party, I can make happen.Being here accomplishes nothing.Maybe hes having fun.I dont want you here.He suddenly seemed distant, his tone far too controlled.Do you know how badly it hurts me when you say that?I cried softly, my chest tight with the pain of it.Whats wrong with me that you dont want me around your family?Angel, no.He hugged me, his hands roaming my back in soothing caresses.Theres nothing wrong with you.Its this place.I dont I cant be here.You want to know whats in my dreams?Its this house.Oh.My stomach knotted with worry and confusion.Im sorry.I didnt know.Something in my voice lured him to press a kiss between my eyebrows.Ive been rough with you today.Im sorry.Im edgy and agitated being here, but thats no excuse.I cupped his face and stared into his eyes, seeing the tumultuous emotions he was so used to hiding.Dont ever apologize for being yourself with me.Its what I want.I want to be your safe place, Gideon.You are.You dont know how much, but Ill find a way to tell you.He rested his forehead against mine.Lets go home.I bought some things for you.Oh?I love gifts.Especially when they came from my self professed unromantic boyfriend.Cautiously, he began to pull out of me.I was shocked to feel how wet I was, how copiously hed come.The final few inches of his cock slid out in a rush and semen slicked my inner thighs.A moment later, two audacious droplets fell to the hardwood floor between my spread legs.Oh, shit.He groaned.Thats so damn hot.Im getting hard again.I stared at the brazen display of his virility and felt warm.You cant go again after that.Hell if I cant.Cupping my sex in his hand, he rubbed the slickness all over me, coating the outer lips and massaging it into the folds.Euphoria spread through me like the warmth of fine liquor, a sense of contentment that came solely from the knowledge that Gideon found gratification in me and my body.Im an animal with you, he murmured.I want to mark you.I want to possess you so completely theres no separation between us.My hips began to move in tiny circles as his words and touch reignited the desire hed goaded with the thrusts of his cock.I wanted to come again, knew Id be miserable if I had to wait until we reached his bed.I was a sexual creature with him, too, so physically attuned to him and so positive that he would never physically hurt me, that I wasfree.I encircled his wrist with my fingers and gently directed his hand around my hip to reach for me from behind.Nipping his jaw with my teeth, I gathered the courage he inspired in me and whispered, Touch me here with your fingers.Mark me there.He froze, his chest lifting and falling rapidly.I dont his voice strengthened I dont do anal play, Eva.Looking into his eyes, I saw something dark and volatile.Something very painful.Of all the things for us to have in common  The raw passion of our lust gentled into the warm familiarity of love.With my heart breaking, I confessed, I dont either.At least not voluntarily.Thenwhy?The confusion in his voice moved me deeply.I hugged him, pressing my cheek to his shoulder and listening to the slightly panicked beat of his heart.Because I believe your touch can erase Nathans.Oh, Eva.His cheek pressed to the crown of my head.I snuggled closer.You make me feel safe.We held each other for long moments.I listened to his heartbeat slow and his breathing smooth out.I inhaled deeply, relishing the mix of his personal scent mixed with the scent of hard lust and harder sex.When the tip of his middle finger slid gossamer soft over the pucker of my anus, I stilled and pulled back to look at him.Gideon?Why me?he asked softly, his beautiful eyes dark and stormy.You know Im fucked up, Eva.You saw what Ithat night you woke meYou saw, damn it.How can you trust me with your body this way?I trust my heart and what it tells me.I smoothed the frown line between his brows.You can give my body back to me, Gideon.I believe youre the only one who can.His eyes closed and his damp forehead touched mine.Do you have a safeword, Eva?Startled, I pulled back again to study his face.A few members of my therapy group had talked about Dom/sub relationships.Some required total control to feel safe during sex.Others fell on the opposite side of the line, finding that bondage and humiliation satisfied their deep seated need to feel pain to experience pleasure.For those who practiced that lifestyle, a safeword was an unambiguous way to say stop.But I couldnt see how that had any relevance to me and Gideon.Do you?I dont need one.Between my legs, the gentle stroke of his finger became less tentative.He repeated his question, Do you have a safeword?No.Ive never needed one.Missionary, doggy style, B. O. B thats about the extent of my mad skills in the sack.That brought a touch of amusement to his otherwise severe face.Thank God.I wouldnt survive you otherwise.And still that fingertip massaged me, spurring a dark yearning.Gideon could do that to me, make me forget everything that happened before.I had no negative sexual triggers with him, no hesitation or fears.Hed given that to me.In return, I wanted to give him the body hed freed from my past.The long case clock near the door began to chime the hour.Gideon, weve been gone a long time.Someone will come looking for us.He put the slightest pressure against my sensitive rosette, barely pressing.Do you really care if they do?My hips arched into the touch.Anticipation was making me hot all over again.I dont care about anything but you when youre touching me.His free hand lifted to my hair and held it at the roots, keeping my head still.Did you ever enjoy anal play?Accidentally or by deliberation?No.And yet you trust me enough to ask me for this.He kissed my forehead as he drew the slickness of his semen back to my rear.I gripped his waistband.You dont have to   Yes, I do.His voice had that wickedly assertive bite to it.If you crave something, Ill be the one to give it to you.All of your needs, Eva, are mine to fulfill.Whatever it costs me.Thank you, Gideon.My hips shifted restlessly as he continued to lubricate me gently.I want to be what you need, too.Ive told you what I need, Eva control.He brushed his parted lips back and forth over mine.Youre asking me to lead you back into painful places and I will, if thats what you need.But we have to be extremely careful.I know.Trust is hard for both of us.If we break it, we could lose everything.Think of a word you associate with power.Your safeword, angel.Choose it.The pressure of that single fingertip became more insistent.I moaned, Crossfire.UmmI like it.Very fitting.His tongue dipped into my mouth, barely touching mine before retreating.His finger rimmed my anus over and over, pushing his semen into the puckered hole, a soft growl escaping him as it flexed in a silent plea for more.The next time he pressed against the ring, I pushed out and he slipped his fingertip inside me.The feeling of penetration was shockingly intense.
