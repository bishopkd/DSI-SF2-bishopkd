 MONDAY, MAY 9, 2011    I have three cars.They go fast across the floor.So fast.One is red.One is green.One is yellow.I like the green one.Its the best.Mommy likes them, too.I like when Mommy plays with the cars and me.The red is her best.Today she sits on the couch staring at the wall.The green car flies into the rug.The red car follows.Then the yellow.Crash!But Mommy doesnt see.I do it again.Crash!But Mommy doesnt see.I aim the green car at her feet.But the green car goes under the couch.I cant reach it.My hand is too big for the gap.Mommy doesnt see.I want my green car.But Mommy stays on the couch staring at the wall.Mommy.My car.She doesnt hear me.Mommy.I pull her hand and she lies back and closes her eyes.Not now, Maggot.Not now, she says.My green car stays under the couch.Its always under the couch.I can see it.But I cant reach it.My green car is fuzzy.Covered in gray fur and dirt.I want it back.But I cant reach it.I can never reach it.My green car is lost.Lost.And I can never play with it again.I open my eyes and my dream fades in the early morning light.What the hell was that about?I grasp at the fragments as they recede, but fail to catch any of them.Dismissing it, like I do most mornings, I climb out of bed and find some newly laundered sweats in my walk in closet.Outside, a leaden sky promises rain, and Im not in the mood to be rained on during my run today.I head upstairs to my gym, switch on the TV for the morning business news, and step onto the treadmill.My thoughts stray to the day.Ive nothing but meetings, though Im seeing my personal trainer later for a workout at my officeBastille is always a welcome challenge.Maybe I should call Elena?Yeah.Maybe.We can do dinner later this week.I stop the treadmill, breathless, and head down to the shower to start another monotonous day.TOMORROW, I MUTTER, DISMISSING Claude Bastille as he stands at the threshold of my office.Golf, this week, Grey.Bastille grins with easy arrogance, knowing that his victory on the golf course is assured.I scowl at him as he turns and leaves.His parting words rub salt into my wounds because, despite my heroic attempts during our workout today, my personal trainer has kicked my ass.Bastille is the only one who can beat me, and now he wants another pound of flesh on the golf course.I detest golf, but so much business is done on the fairways, I have to endure his lessons there, tooand though I hate to admit it, playing against Bastille does improve my game.As I stare out the window at the Seattle skyline, the familiar ennui seeps unwelcome into my consciousness.My mood is as flat and gray as the weather.My days are blending together with no distinction, and I need some kind of diversion.Ive worked all weekend, and now, in the continued confines of my office, Im restless.I shouldnt feel this way, not after several bouts with Bastille.But I do.I frown.The sobering truth is that the only thing to capture my interest recently has been my decision to send two freighters of cargo to Sudan.This reminds meRos is supposed to come back to me with numbers and logistics.What the hell is keeping her?I check my schedule and reach for the phone.Damn.I have to endure an interview with the persistent Miss Kavanagh for the WSU student newspaper.Why the hell did I agree to this?I loathe interviewsinane questions from ill informed, envious people intent on probing my private life.And shes a student.The phone buzzes.Yes, I snap at Andrea, as if shes to blame.At least I can keep this interview short.Miss Anastasia Steele is here to see you, Mr.Grey.Steele?I was expecting Katherine Kavanagh.Its Miss Anastasia Steele whos here, sir.I hate the unexpected.Show her in.Well, wellMiss Kavanagh is unavailable.I know her father, Eamon, the owner of Kavanagh Media.Weve done business together, and he seems like a shrewd operator and a rational human being.This interview is a favor to himone that I mean to cash in on later when it suits me.And I have to admit I was vaguely curious about his daughter, interested to see if the apple has fallen far from the tree.A commotion at the door brings me to my feet as a whirl of long chestnut hair, pale limbs, and brown boots dives headfirst into my office.Repressing my natural annoyance at such clumsiness, I hurry over to the girl who has landed on her hands and knees on the floor.Clasping slim shoulders, I help her to her feet.Clear, embarrassed eyes meet mine and halt me in my tracks.They are the most extraordinary color, powder blue, and guileless, and for one awful moment, I think she can see right through me and Im leftexposed.The thought is unnerving, so I dismiss it immediately.She has a small, sweet face that is blushing now, an innocent pale rose.I wonder briefly if all her skin is like thatflawlessand what it would look like pink and warmed from the bite of a cane.Damn.I stop my wayward thoughts, alarmed at their direction.What the hell are you thinking, Grey?This girl is much too young.She gapes at me, and I resist rolling my eyes.Yeah, yeah, baby, its just a face, and its only skin deep.I need to dispel that admiring look from those eyes but lets have some fun in the process!Miss Kavanagh.Im Christian Grey.Are you all right?Would you like to sit?Theres that blush again.In command once more, I study her.Shes quite attractiveslight, pale, with a mane of dark hair barely contained by a hair tie.A brunette.Yeah, shes attractive.I extend my hand as she stutters the beginning of a mortified apology and places her hand in mine.Her skin is cool and soft, but her handshake surprisingly firm.Miss Kavanagh is indisposed, so she sent me.I hope you dont mind, Mr.Grey.Her voice is quiet with a hesitant musicality, and she blinks erratically, long lashes fluttering.Unable to keep the amusement from my voice as I recall her less than elegant entrance into my office, I ask who she is.Anastasia Steele.Im studying English literature with Kate, umKatherineumMiss Kavanagh, at WSU Vancouver.A bashful, bookish type, eh?She looks it: poorly dressed, her slight frame hidden beneath a shapeless sweater, an A line brown skirt, and utilitarian boots.Does she have any sense of style at all?She looks nervously around my officeeverywhere but at me, I note, with amused irony.How can this young woman be a journalist?She doesnt have an assertive bone in her body.Shes flustered, meeksubmissive.Bemused at my inappropriate thoughts, I shake my head and wonder if first impressions are reliable.Muttering some platitude, I ask her to sit, then notice her discerning gaze appraising my office paintings.Before I can stop myself, I find Im explaining them.A local artist.Trouton.Theyre lovely.Raising the ordinary to extraordinary, she says dreamily, lost in the exquisite, fine artistry of Troutons work.Her profile is delicatean upturned nose, soft, full lipsand in her words she has captured my sentiments exactly.Raising the ordinary to extraordinary.Its a keen observation.Miss Steele is bright.I agree and watch, fascinated, as that flush creeps slowly over her skin once more.As I sit down opposite her, I try to bridle my thoughts.She fishes some crumpled sheets of paper and a digital recorder out of her large bag.Shes all thumbs, dropping the damned thing twice on my Bauhaus coffee table.Its obvious shes never done this before, but for some reason I cant fathom, I find it amusing.Under normal circumstances her maladroitness would irritate the hell out of me, but now I hide my smile beneath my index finger and resist the urge to set it up for her myself.As she fumbles and grows more and more flustered, it occurs to me that I could refine her motor skills with the aid of a riding crop.Adeptly used, it can bring even the most skittish to heel.The errant thought makes me shift in my chair.She peeks up at me and bites down on her full bottom lip.Fuck!How did I not notice how inviting that mouth is?S Sorry, Im not used to this.I can tell, baby, but right now I dont give a damn because I cant take my eyes off your mouth.Take all the time you need, Miss Steele.I need another moment to marshal my wayward thoughts.Greystop this, now.Do you mind if I record your answers?she asks, her face candid and expectant.I want to laugh.After youve taken so much trouble to set up the recorder, you ask me now?She blinks, her eyes large and lost for a moment, and Im overcome by an unfamiliar twinge of guilt.Stop being such a shit, Grey.No, I dont mind.I dont want to be responsible for that look.Did Kate, I mean, Miss Kavanagh, explain what the interview was for?Yes, to appear in the graduation issue of the student newspaper, as I shall be giving the commencement address at this years graduation ceremony.Why the hell Ive agreed to do that, I dont know.Sam in PR tells me that WSUs environmental sciences department needs the publicity in order to attract additional funding to match the grant Ive given them, and Sam will go to any lengths for media exposure.Miss Steele blinks once more, as if this is news to herand she looks disapproving.Hasnt she done any background work for this interview?She should know this.The thought cools my blood.Itsdispleasing, not what I expect from someone whos imposing on my time.Good.I have some questions, Mr.Grey.She tucks a lock of hair behind her ear, distracting me from my annoyance.I thought you might, I say dryly.Lets make her squirm.Obligingly, she does, then pulls herself upright and squares her small shoulders.She means business.Leaning forward, she presses the start button on the recorder and frowns as she glances down at her crumpled notes.Youre very young to have amassed such an empire.To what do you owe your success?Surely she can do better than this.What a dull question.Not one iota of originality.Its disappointing.I trot out my usual response about having exceptional people working for me.People I trust, insofar as I trust anyone, and pay wellblah, blah, blahBut Miss Steele, the simple fact is, Im brilliant at what I do.For me its like falling off a log.Buying ailing, mismanaged companies and fixing them, keeping some or, if theyre really broken, stripping their assets and selling them off to the highest bidder.Its simply a question of knowing the difference between the two, and invariably it comes down to the people in charge.To succeed in business you need good people, and I can judge a person, better than most.Maybe youre just lucky, she says quietly.Lucky?A frisson of annoyance runs through me.Lucky?How dare she?She looks unassuming and quiet, but this question?No one has ever suggested that I was lucky.Hard work, bringing people with me, keeping a close watch on them, and second guessing them if I need to, and if they arent up to the task, ditching them.Thats what I do, and I do it well.Its nothing to do with luck!Well, to hell with that.Flaunting my erudition, I quote the words of Andrew Carnegie, my favorite industrialist.The growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership.You sound like a control freak, she says, and shes perfectly serious.What the hell?Maybe she can see through me.Control is my middle name, sweetheart.I glare at her, hoping to intimidate her.Oh, I exercise control in all things, Miss Steele.And Id like to exercise it over you, right here, right now.That attractive blush steals across her face, and she bites that lip again.I ramble on, trying to distract myself from her mouth.Besides, immense power is acquired by assuring yourself, in your secret reveries, that you were born to control things.Do you feel that you have immense power?she asks in a soft, soothing voice, but she arches a delicate brow with a look that conveys her censure.Is she deliberately trying to goad me?Is it her questions, her attitude, or the fact that I find her attractive thats pissing me off?My annoyance grows.I employ over forty thousand people.That gives me a certain sense of responsibilitypower, if you will.If I were to decide I was no longer interested in the telecommunications business and sell, twenty thousand people would struggle to make their mortgage payments after a month or so.Her mouth pops open at my response.Thats more like it.Suck it up, baby.I feel my equilibrium returning.Dont you have a board to answer to?I own my company.I dont have to answer to a board.She should know this.And do you have any interests outside your work?she continues hastily, correctly gauging my reaction.She knows Im pissed, and for some inexplicable reason this pleases me.I have varied interests, Miss Steele.Very varied.Images of her in assorted positions in my playroom flash through my mind: shackled on the cross, spread eagled on the four poster, splayed over the whipping bench.And beholdtheres that blush again.Its like a defense mechanism.But if you work so hard, what do you do to chill out?Chill out?Those words out of her smart mouth sound odd but amusing.Besides, when do I get time to chill out?She has no idea what I do.But she looks at me again with those ingenuous big eyes, and to my surprise I find myself considering her question.What do I do to chill out?Sailing, flying, fuckingtesting the limits of attractive brunettes like her, and bringing them to heelThe thought makes me shift in my seat, but I answer her smoothly, omitting a few favorite hobbies.You invest in manufacturing.Why, specifically?I like to build things.I like to know how things work: what makes things tick, how to construct and deconstruct.And I have a love of ships.What can I say?They transport food around the planet.That sounds like your heart talking, rather than logic and facts.Heart?Me?Oh no, baby.My heart was savaged beyond recognition a long time ago.Possibly.Though there are people whod say I dont have a heart.Why would they say that?Because they know me well.I give her a wry smile.In fact, no one knows me that well, except maybe Elena.I wonder what she would make of little Miss Steele here.The girl is a mass of contradictions: shy, awkward, obviously bright, and arousing as hell.Yes, okay, I admit it.I find her alluring.She recites the next question by rote.Would your friends say youre easy to get to know?Im a very private person.I go a long way to protect my privacy.I dont often give interviews.Doing what I do, living the life Ive chosen, I need my privacy.Why did you agree to do this one?Because Im a benefactor of the university, and for all intents and purposes, I couldnt get Miss Kavanagh off my back.She badgered and badgered my PR people, and I admire that kind of tenacity.But Im glad its you who turned up and not her.You also invest in farming technologies.Why are you interested in this area?We cant eat money, Miss Steele, and there are too many people on this planet who dont have enough food.I stare at her, poker faced.That sounds very philanthropic.Is that something you feel passionately about?Feeding the worlds poor?She regards me with a puzzled look, as if Im a conundrum, but theres no way I want her seeing into my dark soul.This is not an area open to discussion.Move it along, Grey.Its shrewd business, I mutter, feigning boredom, and I imagine fucking that mouth to distract myself from all thoughts of hunger.Yes, her mouth needs training, and I imagine her on her knees before me.Now, that thought is appealing.She recites her next question, dragging me away from my fantasy.Do you have a philosophy?If so, what is it?I dont have a philosophy as such.Maybe a guiding principleCarnegies: A man who acquires the ability to take full possession of his own mind may take possession of anything else to which he is justly entitled.Im very singular, driven.I like controlof myself and those around me.So you want to possess things?Yes, baby.You, for one.I frown, startled by the thought.I want to deserve to possess them, but yes, bottom line, I do.You sound like the ultimate consumer.Her voice is tinged with disapproval, pissing me off again.I am.She sounds like a rich kid whos had all she ever wanted, but as I take a closer look at her clothesshes dressed in clothes from some cheap store like Old Navy or H&MI know that isnt it.She hasnt grown up in an affluent household.I could really take care of you.Where the hell did that thought come from?Although, now that I consider it, I do need a new sub.Its been, whattwo months since Susannah?And here I am, salivating over this woman.I try an agreeable smile.Nothing wrong with consumptionafter all, it drives whats left of the American economy.You were adopted.How much do you think thats shaped the way you are?What does this have to do with the price of oil?What a ridiculous question.If Id stayed with the crack whore, Id probably be dead.I blow her off with a non answer, trying to keep my voice level, but she pushes me, demanding to know how old I was when I was adopted.Shut her down, Grey!My tone goes cold.Thats a matter of public record, Miss Steele.She should know this, too.Now she looks contrite as she tucks an escaped strand of hair behind her ear.Good.Youve had to sacrifice family life for your work.Thats not a question, I snap.She startles, clearly embarrassed, but she has the grace to apologize and she rephrases the question: Have you had to sacrifice family life for your work?What do I want with a family?I have a family.I have a brother, a sister, and two loving parents.Im not interested in extending my family beyond that.Are you gay, Mr.Grey?What the hell!I cannot believe shes said that out loud!Ironically, the question even my own family will not ask.How dare she!I have a sudden urge to drag her out of her seat, bend her over my knee, spank her, and then fuck her over my desk with her hands tied behind her back.That would answer her ridiculous question.I take a deep calming breath.To my vindictive delight, she appears to be mortified by her own question.No, Anastasia, Im not.I raise my eyebrows, but keep my expression impassive.Anastasia.Its a lovely name.I like the way my tongue rolls around it.I apologize.Its, umwritten here.Shes at it again with the hair behind the ear.Obviously its a nervous habit.Are these not her questions?I ask her, and she pales.Damn, she really is attractive, in an understated sort of way.Erno.KateMiss Kavanaghshe compiled the questions.Are you colleagues on the student paper?No.Shes my roommate.No wonder shes all over the place.I scratch my chin, debating whether or not to give her a really hard time.Did you volunteer to do this interview?I ask, and Im rewarded with her submissive look: shes nervous about my reaction.I like the effect I have on her.I was drafted.Shes not well.Her voice is soft.That explains a great deal.Theres a knock at the door, and Andrea appears.Mr.Grey, forgive me for interrupting, but your next meeting is in two minutes.Were not finished here, Andrea.Please cancel my next meeting.Andrea gapes at me, looking confused.I stare at her.Out!Now!Im busy with little Miss Steele here.Very well, Mr.Grey, she says, recovering quickly, and turning on her heel, she leaves us.I turn my attention back to the intriguing, frustrating creature on my couch.Where were we, Miss Steele?Please, dont let me keep you from anything.Oh no, baby.Its my turn now.I want to know if there are any secrets to uncover behind that lovely face.I want to know about you.I think thats only fair.As I lean back and press my fingers to my lips, her eyes flick to my mouth and she swallows.Oh yesthe usual effect.And it is gratifying to know she isnt completely oblivious of my charms.Theres not much to know, she says, her blush returning.Im intimidating her.What are your plans after you graduate?I havent made any plans, Mr.Grey.I just need to get through my final exams.We run an excellent internship program here.What possessed me ever to say that?Its against the rules, Grey.Never fuck the staffBut youre not fucking this girl.She looks surprised, and her teeth sink into that lip again.Why is that so arousing?Oh.Ill bear that in mind, she replies.Though Im not sure Id fit in here.Why do you say that?I ask.Whats wrong with my company?Its obvious, isnt it?Not to me.Im confounded by her response.Shes flustered again as she reaches for the recorder.Shit, shes going.Mentally I run through my schedule for that afternoonthere is nothing that wont keep.Would you like me to show you around?Im sure youre far too busy, Mr.Grey, and I do have a long drive.Youre driving back to Vancouver?I glance out the window.Its one hell of a drive, and its raining.She shouldnt be driving in this weather, but I cant forbid her.The thought irritates me.Well, youd better drive carefully.My voice is sterner than I intend.She fumbles with the recorder.She wants out of my office, and to my surprise, I dont want her to go.Did you get everything you need?I ask in a transparent effort to prolong her stay.Yes, sir, she says quietly.Her response floors methe way those words sound, coming out of that smart mouthand briefly I imagine that mouth at my beck and call.Thank you for the interview, Mr.Grey.The pleasures been all mine, I respondtruthfully, because I havent been this fascinated by anyone for a while.The thought is unsettling.She stands and I extend my hand, eager to touch her.Until we meet again, Miss Steele.My voice is low as she places her hand in mine.Yes, I want to flog and fuck this girl in my playroom.Have her bound and wantingneeding me, trusting me.I swallow.It aint going to happen, Grey.Mr.Grey.She nods and withdraws her hand quickly, too quickly.I cant let her go like this.Its obvious shes desperate to leave.Its irritating, but inspiration hits me as I open my office door.Just ensuring you make it through the door, I quip.Her lips form a hard line.Thats very considerate, Mr.Grey, she snaps.Miss Steele bites back!I grin behind her as she exits, and follow her out.Both Andrea and Olivia look up in shock.Yeah, yeah.Im just seeing the girl out.Did you have a coat?I ask.A jacket.I give Olivia a pointed look and she immediately leaps up to retrieve a navy jacket, passing it to me with her usual simpering expression.Christ, Olivia is annoyingmooning over me all the time.Hmm.The jacket is worn and cheap.Miss Anastasia Steele should be better dressed.I hold it up for her, and as I pull it over her slim shoulders, I touch the skin at the base of her neck.She stills at the contact and pales.Yes!She is affected by me.The knowledge is immensely pleasing.Strolling over to the elevator, I press the call button while she stands fidgeting beside me.Oh, I could stop your fidgeting, baby.The doors open and she scurries in, then turns to face me.Shes more than attractive.I would go as far as to say shes beautiful.Anastasia, I say, in good bye.Christian, she answers, her voice soft.And the elevator doors close, leaving my name hanging in the air between us, sounding odd and unfamiliar, but sexy as hell.I need to know more about this girl.Andrea, I bark as I return to my office.Get me Welch on the line, now.As I sit at my desk and wait for the call, I look at the paintings on the wall of my office, and Miss Steeles words drift back to me.Raising the ordinary to extraordinary.She could so easily have been describing herself.My phone buzzes.I have Mr.Welch on the line for you.Put him through.Yes, sir.Welch, I need a background check.SATURDAY, MAY 14, 2011    *

the executive summary for the hundredth time since I received it two days ago, looking for some insight into the enigmatic Miss Anastasia Rose Steele.I cannot get the damned woman out of my mind, and its seriously beginning to piss me off.This past week, during particularly dull meetings, Ive found myself replaying the interview in my head.Her fumbling fingers on the recorder, the way she tucked her hair behind her ear, the lip biting.Yes.The lip biting gets me every time.And now here I am, parked outside Claytons, a mom and pop hardware store on the outskirts of Portland where she works.Youre a fool, Grey.Why are you here?I knew it would lead to this.All weekI knew Id have to see her again.Id known it since she uttered my name in the elevator.Id tried to resist.Id waited five days, five tedious days, to see if Id forget about her.And I dont do waiting.I hate waitingfor anything.Ive never pursued a woman before.The women Ive had understood what I expected of them.My fear now is that Miss Steele is just too young and that she wont be interested in what I have to offer.Will she?Will she even make a good submissive?I shake my head.So here I am, an ass, sitting in a suburban parking lot in a dreary part of Portland.Her background check has produced nothing remarkableexcept the last fact, which has been at the forefront of my mind.Its the reason Im here.Why no boyfriend, Miss Steele?Sexual orientation unknownperhaps shes gay.I snort, thinking that unlikely.I recall the question she asked during the interview, her acute embarrassment, the way her skin flushed a pale roseIve been suffering from these lascivious thoughts since I met her.Thats why youre here.Im itching to see her againthose blue eyes have haunted me, even in my dreams.I havent mentioned her to Flynn, and Im glad because Im now behaving like a stalker.Perhaps I should let him know.No.I dont want him hounding me about his latest solution based therapy shit.I just need a distraction, and right now the only distraction I want is the one working as a salesclerk in a hardware store.Youve come all this way.Lets see if little Miss Steele is as appealing as you remember.Showtime, Grey.A bell chimes a flat electronic note as I walk into the store.Its much bigger than it looks from the outside, and although its almost lunchtime the place is quiet, for a Saturday.There are aisles and aisles of the usual junk youd expect.Id forgotten the possibilities that a hardware store could present to someone like me.I mainly shop online for my needs, but while Im here, maybe Ill stock up on a few items: Velcro, split ringsYeah.Ill find the delectable Miss Steele and have some fun.It takes me all of three seconds to spot her.Shes hunched over the counter, staring intently at a computer screen and picking at her luncha bagel.Absentmindedly, she wipes a crumb from the corner of her lips and into her mouth and sucks on her finger.My cock twitches in response.What am I, fourteen?My bodys reaction is irritating.Maybe this will stop if I fetter, fuck, and flog herand not necessarily in that order.Yeah.Thats what I need.She is thoroughly absorbed by her task, and it gives me an opportunity to study her.Salacious thoughts aside, shes attractive, seriously attractive.Ive remembered her well.She looks up and freezes.Its as unnerving as the first time I met her.She pins me with a discerning stareshocked, I thinkand I dont know if this is a good response or a bad response.Miss Steele.What a pleasant surprise.Mr.Grey, she says, breathy and flustered.Ah, a good response.I was in the area.I need to stock up on a few things.Its a pleasure to see you again.A real pleasure.Shes dressed in a tight T shirt and jeans, not the shapeless shit she was wearing earlier this week.Shes all long legs, narrow waist, and perfect tits.Her lips are still parted in surprise, and I have to resist the urge to tip her chin up and close her mouth.Ive flown from Seattle just to see you, and the way you look right now, it was really worth the journey.Ana.My names Ana.What can I help you with, Mr.Grey?She takes a deep breath, squares her shoulders like she did in the interview, and gives me a fake smile that Im sure she reserves for customers.Game on, Miss Steele.There are a few items I need.To start with, Id like some cable ties.My request catches her off guard; she looks stunned.Oh, this is going to be fun.Youd be amazed what I can do with a few cable ties, baby.We stock various lengths.Shall I show you?she says, finding her voice.Please.Lead the way.She steps out from behind the counter and gestures toward one of the aisles.Shes wearing chucks.Idly I wonder what shed look like in skyscraper heels.Louboutinsnothing but Louboutins.Theyre with the electrical goods, aisle eight.Her voice wavers and she blushes  She is affected by me.Hope blooms in my chest.Shes not gay, then.I smirk.After you.I hold my hand out for her to lead the way.Letting her walk ahead gives me the space and time to admire her fantastic ass.Her long, thick ponytail keeps time like a metronome to the gentle sway of her hips.She really is the whole package: sweet, polite, and beautiful, with all the physical attributes I value in a submissive.But the million dollar question is, could she be a submissive?She probably knows nothing of the lifestylemy lifestylebut I very much want to introduce her to it.You are getting way ahead of yourself on this deal, Grey.Are you in Portland on business?she asks, interrupting my thoughts.Her voice is high; shes feigning disinterest.It makes me want to laugh.Women rarely make me laugh.I was visiting the WSU farming division.Its based in Vancouver, I lie.Actually, Im here to see you, Miss Steele.Her face falls, and I feel like a shit.Im currently funding some research there in crop rotation and soil science.That, at least, is true.All part of your feed the world plan?She arches a brow, amused.Something like that, I mutter.Is she laughing at me?Oh, Id love to put a stop to that if she is.But how to start?Maybe with dinner, rather than the usual interviewnow, that would be novel: taking a prospect out to dinner.We arrive at the cable ties, which are arranged in an assortment of lengths and colors.Absentmindedly, my fingers trace over the packets.I could just ask her out for dinner.Like on a date?Would she accept?When I glance at her shes examining her knotted fingers.She cant look at methis is promising.I select the longer ties.They are more flexible, after all, as they can accommodate two ankles and two wrists at once.These will do.Is there anything else?she says quicklyeither shes being super attentive or she wants to get me out of the store, I dont know which.Id like some masking tape.Are you redecorating?No, not redecorating.Oh, if you only knew  This way, she says.Masking tape is in the decorating aisle.Come on, Grey.You dont have much time.Engage her in some conversation.Have you worked here long?Of course, I already know the answer.Unlike some people, I do my research.For some reason shes embarrassed.Christ, this girl is shy.I dont have a hope in hell.She turns quickly and walks down the aisle toward the section labeled Decorating.I follow her eagerly, like a puppy.Four years, she mumbles as we reach the masking tape.She bends down and grasps two rolls, each a different width.Ill take that one.The wider tape is much more effective as a gag.As she passes it to me, the tips of our fingers touch, briefly.It resonates in my groin.Damn!She pales.Anything else?Her voice is soft and husky.Christ, Im having the same effect on her that she has on me.Maybe  Some rope, I think.This way.She scoots up the aisle, giving me another chance to appreciate her fine ass.What sort were you after?We have synthetic and natural filament ropetwinecable cord  Shitstop.I groan inwardly, trying to chase away the image of her suspended from the ceiling in my playroom.Ill take five yards of the natural filament rope, please.Its coarser and chafes more if you struggle against itmy rope of choice.A tremor runs through her fingers, but she measures out five yards like a pro.Pulling a utility knife from her right pocket, she cuts the rope in one swift gesture, coils it neatly, and ties it off with a slipknot.Impressive.Were you a Girl Scout?Organized group activities arent really my thing, Mr.Grey.What is your thing, Anastasia?Her pupils dilate as I stare.Yes!Books, she answers.What kind of books?Oh, you know.The usual.The classics.British literature, mainly.British literature?The Bronts and Austen, I bet.All those romantic hearts and flowers types.Thats not good.Anything else you need?I dont know.What else would you recommend?I want to see her reaction.For a do it yourselfer?she asks, surprised.I want to hoot with laughter.Oh, baby, DIY is not my thing.I nod, stifling my mirth.Her eyes flick down my body and I tense.Shes checking me out!Coveralls, she blurts out.Its the most unexpected thing Ive heard her say since the Are you gay?question.You wouldnt want to ruin your clothing.She gestures to my jeans.I cant resist.I could always take them off.Um.She flushes beet red and stares down.I put her out of her misery.Ill take some coveralls.Heaven forbid I should ruin any clothing.Without a word, she turns and walks briskly up the aisle, and I follow in her enticing wake.Do you need anything else?she says, sounding breathless as she hands me a pair of blue coveralls.Shes mortified, eyes still cast down.Christ, she does things to me.Hows the article coming along?I ask, in the hope she might relax a little.She looks up and gives me a brief relieved smile.Finally.Im not writing it, Katherine is.Miss Kavanagh.My roommate, shes the writer.Shes very happy with it.Shes the editor of the newspaper, and she was devastated that she couldnt do the interview in person.Its the longest sentence shes uttered since we first met, and shes talking about someone else, not herself.Interesting.Before I can comment, she adds, Her only concern is that she doesnt have any original photographs of you.The tenacious Miss Kavanagh wants photographs.Publicity stills, eh?I can do that.It will allow me to spend time with the delectable Miss Steele.What sort of photographs does she want?She gazes at me for a moment, then shakes her head, perplexed, not knowing what to say.Well, Im around.Tomorrow, perhaps I can stay in Portland.Work from a hotel.A room at The Heathman, perhaps.Ill need Taylor to come down, bring my laptop and some clothes.Or Elliotunless hes screwing around, which is his usual MO over the weekend.Youd be willing to do a photo shoot?She cannot contain her surprise.I give her a brief nod.Yeah, I want to spend more time with you  Steady, Grey.Kate will be delightedif we can find a photographer.She smiles and her face lights up like a cloudless dawn.Shes breathtaking.Let me know about tomorrow.I pull my wallet from my jeans.My card.It has my cell number on it.Youll need to call before ten in the morning.And if she doesnt, Ill head on back to Seattle and forget about this stupid venture.The thought depresses me.Okay.She continues to grin.Ana!We both turn as a young man dressed in casual designer gear appears at the far end of the aisle.His eyes are all over Miss Anastasia Steele.Who the hell is this prick?Er, excuse me for a moment, Mr.Grey.She walks toward him, and the asshole engulfs her in a gorilla like hug.My blood runs cold.Its a primal response.Get your fucking paws off her.I fist my hands and am only slightly mollified when she doesnt return his hug.They fall into a whispered conversation.Maybe Welchs facts were wrong.Maybe this guy is her boyfriend.He looks the right age, and he cant take his greedy little eyes off her.He holds her for a moment at arms length, examining her, then stands with his arm resting on her shoulder.It seems like a casual gesture, but I know hes staking a claim and telling me to back off.She seems embarrassed, shifting from foot to foot.Shit.I should go.Ive overplayed my hand.Shes with this guy.Then she says something else to him and moves out of his reach, touching his arm, not his hand, shrugging him off.Its clear they arent close.Good.ErPaul, this is Christian Grey.Mr.Grey, this is Paul Clayton.His brother owns the place.She gives me an odd look that I dont understand and continues, Ive known Paul ever since Ive worked here, though we dont see each other that often.Hes back from Princeton, where hes studying business administration.Shes babbling, giving me a long explanation and telling me theyre not together, I think.The bosss brother, not a boyfriend.Im relieved, but the extent of the relief I feel is unexpected, and it makes me frown.This woman has really gotten under my skin.Mr.Clayton.My tone is deliberately clipped.Mr.Grey.His handshake is limp, like his hair.Asshole.Wait upnot the Christian Grey?Of Grey Enterprises Holdings?Yeah, thats me, you prick.In a heartbeat I watch him morph from territorial to obsequious.Wowis there anything I can get you?Anastasia has it covered, Mr.Clayton.Shes been very attentive.Now fuck off.Cool, he gushes, all white teeth and deferential.Catch you later, Ana.Sure, Paul, she says, and he ambles off to the back of the store.I watch him disappear.Anything else, Mr.Grey?Just these items, I mutter.Shit, Im out of time, and I still dont know if Im going to see her again.I have to know whether theres a hope in hell she might consider what I have in mind.How can I ask her?Am I ready to take on a submissive who knows nothing?Shes going to need substantial training.Closing my eyes, I imagine the interesting possibilities this presentsgetting there is going to be half the fun.Will she even be up for this?Or do I have it all wrong?She walks back to the cashiers counter and rings up my purchases, all the while keeping her eyes on the register.Look at me, damn it!I want to see her face again and gauge what shes thinking.Finally she raises her head.That will be forty three dollars, please.Is that all?Would you like a bag?she asks, as I pass her my AmEx.Please, Anastasia.Her namea beautiful name for a beautiful girlflows smoothly over my tongue.She packs the items briskly.This is it.I have to go.Youll call me if you want me to do the photo shoot?She nods as she hands back my charge card.Good.Until tomorrow, perhaps.I cant just leave.I have to let her know Im interested.Ohand Anastasia, Im glad Miss Kavanagh couldnt do the interview.She looks surprised and flattered.This is good.I sling the bag over my shoulder and exit the store.Yes, against my better judgment, I want her.Now I have to waitfucking waitagain.Utilizing willpower that would make Elena proud, I keep my eyes ahead as I take my cell out of my pocket and climb into the rental car.Im deliberately not looking back at her.Im not.Im not.My eyes flick to the rearview mirror, where I can see the shop door, but all I see is the quaint storefront.Shes not in the window, staring out at me.Its disappointing.I press 1 on speed dial and Taylor answers before the phone has a chance to ring.Mr.Grey, he says.Make reservations at The Heathman; Im staying in Portland this weekend, and can you bring down the SUV, my computer, and the paperwork beneath it, and a change or two of clothes.Yes, sir.And Charlie Tango?Have Joe move her to PDX.Will do, sir.Ill be with you in about three and a half hours.I hang up and start the car.So I have a few hours in Portland while I wait to see if this girl is interested in me.What to do?Time for a hike, I think.Maybe I can walk this strange hunger out of my system.ITS BEEN FIVE HOURS with no phone call from the delectable Miss Steele.What the hell was I thinking?I watch the street from the window of my suite at The Heathman.I loathe waiting.I always have.The weather, now cloudy, held for my hike through Forest Park, but the walk has done nothing to cure my agitation.Im annoyed at her for not phoning, but mostly Im angry with myself.Im a fool for being here.What a waste of time its been chasing this woman.When have I ever chased a woman?Grey, get a grip.Sighing, I check my phone once again in the hope that Ive just missed her call, but theres nothing.At least Taylor has arrived and I have all my shit.I have Barneys report on his departments graphene tests to read and I can work in peace.Peace?I havent known peace since Miss Steele fell into my office.WHEN I GLANCE UP, dusk has shrouded my suite in gray shadows.The prospect of a night alone again is depressing.While I contemplate what to do my phone vibrates against the polished wood of the desk and an unknown but vaguely familiar number with a Washington area code flashes on the screen.Suddenly my heart is pumping as if Ive run ten miles.Is it her?I answer.ErMr.Grey?Its Anastasia Steele.My face erupts in a shit eating grin.Well, well.A breathy, nervous, soft spoken Miss Steele.My evening is looking up.Miss Steele.How nice to hear from you.I hear her breath hitch and the sound travels directly to my groin.Great.Im affecting her.Like shes affecting me.Umwed like to go ahead with the photo shoot for the article.Tomorrow, if thats okay.Where would be convenient for you, sir?In my room.Just you, me, and the cable ties.Im staying at The Heathman in Portland.Shall we say nine thirty tomorrow morning?Okay, well see you there, she gushes, unable to hide the relief and delight in her voice.I look forward to it, Miss Steele.I hang up before she senses my excitement and how pleased I am.Leaning back in my chair, I gaze at the darkening skyline and run both my hands through my hair.How the hell am I going to close this deal?SUNDAY, MAY 15, 2011    * * *      With Moby blasting in my ears I run down Southwest Salmon Street toward the Willamette River.Its 6:30 in the morning and Im trying to clear my head.Last night I dreamed of her.Blue eyes, breathy voiceher sentences ending with sir as she knelt before me.Since Ive met her, my dreams have been a welcome change from the occasional nightmare.I wonder what Flynn would make of that.The thought is disconcerting, so I ignore it and concentrate on pushing my body to its limits along the bank of the Willamette.As my feet pound the walkway, sunshine breaks through the clouds and it gives me hope.TWO HOURS LATER AS I jog back to the hotel I pass a coffee shop.Maybe I should take her for coffee.Like a date?Well.No.Not a date.I laugh at the ridiculous thought.Just a chatan interview of sorts.Then I can find out a little more about this enigmatic woman and if shes interested, or if Im on a wild goose chase.Im alone in the elevator as I stretch out.Finishing my stretches in my hotel suite, Im centered and calm for the first time since I arrived in Portland.Breakfast has been delivered and Im famished.Its not a feeling I tolerateever.Sitting down to breakfast in my sweats, I decide to eat before I shower.THERES A BRISK KNOCK on the door.I open it and Taylor stands on the threshold.Good morning, Mr.Grey.Morning.They ready for me?Yes, sir.Theyre set up in room 601.Ill be right down.I close the door and tuck my shirt into my gray pants.My hair is wet from my shower, but I dont give a shit.One glance at the louche fucker in the mirror and I exit to follow Taylor to the elevator.Room 601 is crowded with people, lights, and camera boxes, but I spot her immediately.Shes standing to the side.Her hair is loose: a lush, glossy mane that falls beneath her breasts.Shes wearing tight jeans and chucks with a short sleeved navy jacket and a white T shirt beneath.Are jeans and chucks her signature look?While not very convenient, they do flatter her shapely legs.Her eyes, disarming as ever, widen as I approach.Miss Steele, we meet again.She takes my extended hand and for a moment I want to squeeze hers and raise it to my lips.Dont be absurd, Grey.She turns her delicious pink and waves in the direction of her friend, who is standing too close, waiting for my attention.Mr.Grey, this is Katherine Kavanagh, she says.With reluctance I release her and turn to the persistent Miss Kavanagh.Shes tall, striking, and well groomed, like her father, but she has her mothers eyes, and I have her to thank for my introduction to the delightful Miss Steele.That thought makes me feel a little more benevolent toward her.The tenacious Miss Kavanagh.How do you do?I trust youre feeling better?Anastasia said you were unwell last week.Im fine, thank you, Mr.Grey.She has a firm, confident handshake, and I doubt shes ever faced a day of hardship in her privileged life.I wonder why these women are friends.They have nothing in common.Thank you for taking the time to do this, Katherine says.Its a pleasure, I reply, and glance at Anastasia, who rewards me with her telltale flush.Is it just me who makes her blush?The thought pleases me.This is Jos Rodriguez, our photographer, Anastasia says, and her face lights up as she introduces him.Shit.Is this the boyfriend?Rodriguez blooms under Anas sweet smile.Are they fucking?Mr.Grey.Rodriguez gives me a dark look as we shake hands.Its a warning.Hes telling me to back off.He likes her.He likes her a lot.Well, game on, kid.Mr.Rodriguez, where would you like me?My tone is a challenge, and he hears it, but Katherine intervenes and waves me toward a chair.Ah.She likes to be in charge.The thought amuses me as I sit.Another young man who appears to be working with Rodriguez switches on the lights, and momentarily Im blinded.Hell!As the glare recedes I search out the lovely Miss Steele.Shes standing at the back of the room, observing the proceedings.Does she always shy away like this?Maybe thats why she and Kavanagh are friends; shes content to be in the background and let Katherine take center stage.Hmma natural submissive.The photographer appears professional enough and absorbed in the job hes been assigned to do.I regard Miss Steele as she watches both of us.Our eyes meet; hers are honest and innocent, and for a moment I reconsider my plan.But then she bites her lip and my breath catches in my throat.Back down, Anastasia.I will her to stop staring, and as if she can hear me, shes the first to look away.Good girl.Katherine asks me to stand as Rodriguez continues to take snaps.Then were done and this is my chance.Thank you again, Mr.Grey.Katherine surges forward and shakes my hand, followed by the photographer, who regards me with ill concealed disapproval.His antagonism makes me smile.Oh, manyou have no idea.I look forward to reading the article, Miss Kavanagh, I say, giving her a brief polite nod.Its Ana I want to talk to.Will you walk with me, Miss Steele?I ask, when I reach her by the door.Sure, she says with surprise.Seize the day, Grey.I mutter some platitude to those still in the room and usher her out the door, wanting to put some distance between her and Rodriguez.In the corridor she stands fiddling with her hair, then her fingers, as Taylor follows me out.Ill call you, Taylor, I say, and when hes almost out of earshot I ask Ana to join me for coffee, my breath held for her response.Her long lashes flicker over her eyes.I have to drive everyone home, she says with dismay.Taylor, I call after him, making her jump.I must make her nervous and I dont know if this is good or bad.And she cant stop fidgeting.Thinking about all the ways I could make her stop is distracting.Are they based at the university?She nods and I ask Taylor to take her friends home.There.Now can you join me for coffee?UmMr.Grey, erthis really She stops.Shit.Its a no.Im going to lose this deal.She looks directly at me, eyes bright.Look, Taylor doesnt have to drive them home.Ill swap vehicles with Kate, if you give me a moment.My relief is tangible and I grin.I have a date!Opening the door, I let her back into the room as Taylor conceals his puzzled look.Can you grab my jacket, Taylor?Certainly, sir.He turns on his heel, his lips twitching as he heads up the corridor.I watch him with narrowed eyes as he disappears into the elevator while I lean against the wall and wait for Miss Steele.What the hell am I going to say to her?How would you like to be my submissive?No.Steady, Grey.Lets take this one stage at a time.Taylor is back within a couple of minutes, holding my jacket.Will that be all, sir?Yes.Thanks.He gives it to me and leaves me standing like an idiot in the corridor.How long is Anastasia going to be?I check my watch.She must be negotiating the car swap with Katherine.Or shes talking to Rodriguez, explaining that shes just going for coffee to placate me and keep me sweet for the article.My thoughts darken.Maybe shes kissing him good bye.Damn.She emerges a moment later, and Im pleased.She doesnt look like shes just been kissed.Okay, she says with resolve.Lets do coffee.But her reddening cheeks somewhat undermine her effort to look confident.After you, Miss Steele.I conceal my delight as she falls into step ahead of me.As I catch up with her my curiosity is piqued about her relationship with Katherine, specifically their compatibility.I ask her how long theyve known each other.Since our freshman year.Shes a good friend.Her voice is full of warmth.Ana is clearly devoted.She came all the way to Seattle to interview me when Katherine was ill, and I find myself hoping that Miss Kavanagh treats her with the same loyalty and respect.At the elevators I press the call button and almost immediately the doors open.A couple in a passionate embrace spring apart, embarrassed to be caught.Ignoring them, we step into the elevator, but I catch Anastasias impish smile.As we travel to the first floor the atmosphere is thick with unfulfilled desire.And I dont know if its emanating from the couple behind us or from me.Yes.I want her.Will she want what I have to offer?Im relieved when the doors open again and I take her hand, which is cool and not clammy as expected.Perhaps I dont affect her as much as Id like.The thought is disheartening.In our wake we hear embarrassed giggling from the couple.What is it about elevators?I mutter.And I have to admit theres something wholesome and nave about their giggling thats totally charming.Miss Steele seems that innocent, just like them, and as we walk onto the street I question my motives again.Shes too young.Shes too inexperienced, but, damn, I like the feel of her hand in mine.In the coffee shop I direct her to find a table and ask what she wants to drink.She stutters through her order: English Breakfast teahot water, bag on the side.Thats a new one to me.No coffee?Im not keen on coffee.Okay, bag out tea.Sugar?No thanks, she says, staring down at her fingers.Anything to eat?No thank you.She shakes her head and tosses her hair over her shoulder, highlighting glints of auburn.I have to wait in line while the two matronly women behind the counter exchange inane pleasantries with all their customers.Its frustrating and keeping me from my objective: Anastasia.Hey, handsome, what can I get you?the older woman asks with a twinkle in her eye.Its just a pretty face, sweetheart.Ill have a coffee with steamed milk.English Breakfast tea.Teabag on the side.And a blueberry muffin.Anastasia might change her mind and eat.You visiting Portland?Yes.The weekend?Yes.The weather sure has picked up today.Yes.I hope you get out to enjoy some sunshine.Please stop talking to me and hurry the fuck up.Yes, I hiss through my teeth and glance over at Ana, who quickly looks away.Shes watching me.Is she checking me out?A bubble of hope swells in my chest.There you go.The woman winks and places the drinks on my tray.Pay at the register, honey, and you have a nice day, now.I manage a cordial response.Thank you.At the table Anastasia is staring at her fingers, reflecting on heaven knows what.Me?Penny for your thoughts?I ask.She jumps and turns red as I set out her tea and my coffee.She sits mute and mortified.Why?Does she really not want to be here?Your thoughts?I ask again, and she fidgets with the teabag.This is my favorite tea, she says, and I revise my mental note that its Twinings English Breakfast tea she likes.I watch her dunk the teabag in the teapot.Its an elaborate and messy spectacle.She fishes it out almost immediately and places the used teabag on her saucer.My mouth is twitching with my amusement.As she tells me she likes her tea weak and black, for a moment I think shes describing what she likes in a man.Get a grip, Grey.Shes talking about tea.Enough of this preamble; its time for some due diligence in this deal.Is he your boyfriend?Her brows knit together, forming a small v above her nose.Who?This is a good response.The photographer.Jos Rodriguez.She laughs.At me.At me!And I dont know if its from relief or if she thinks Im funny.Its annoying.I cant get her measure.Does she like me or not?She tells me hes just a friend.Oh, sweetheart, he wants to be more than a friend.Why did you think he was my boyfriend?she asks.The way you smiled at him, and he at you.You have no idea, do you?The boy is smitten.Hes more like family, she says.Okay, so the lust is one sided, and for a moment I wonder if she realizes how lovely she is.She eyes the blueberry muffin as I peel back the paper, and for a moment I imagine her on her knees beside me as I feed her, a morsel at a time.The thought is divertingand arousing.Do you want some?I ask.She shakes her head.No thanks.Her voice is hesitant and she stares once more at her hands.Why is she so jittery?Maybe because of me?And the boy I met yesterday, at the store.Hes not your boyfriend?No.Pauls just a friend.I told you yesterday.She frowns again as if shes confused, and crosses her arms in defense.She doesnt like being asked about these boys.I remember how uncomfortable she seemed when the kid at the store put his arm around her, staking his claim.Why do you ask?she adds.You seem nervous around men.Her eyes widen.They really are beautiful, the color of the ocean at Cabo, the bluest of blue seas.I should take her there.What?Where did that come from?I find you intimidating, she says, and looks down, fidgeting once more with her fingers.On the one hand shes so submissive, but on the other sheschallenging.You should find me intimidating.Yeah.She should.There arent many people brave enough to tell me that I intimidate them.Shes honest, and I tell her sobut when she averts her eyes, I dont know what shes thinking.Its frustrating.Does she like me?Or is she tolerating this meeting to keep Kavanaghs interview on track?Which is it?Youre a mystery, Miss Steele.Theres nothing mysterious about me.I think youre very self contained.Like any good submissive.Except when you blush, of course, which is often.I just wish I knew what you were blushing about.There.That will goad her into a response.Popping a small piece of the blueberry muffin into my mouth, I await her reply.Do you always make such personal observations?Thats not that personal, is it?I hadnt realized I was.Have I offended you?No.Good.But youre very high handed.Im used to getting my own way, Anastasia.In all things.I dont doubt it, she mutters, and then wants to know why I havent asked her to call me by my first name.What?And I remember her leaving my office in the elevatorand how my name sounded coming out of her smart mouth.Has she seen through me?Is she deliberately antagonizing me?I tell her that no one calls me Christian, except my family  I dont even know if its my real name.Dont go there, Grey.I change the subject.I want to know about her.Are you an only child?Her eyelashes flutter several times before she answers that she is.Tell me about your parents.She rolls her eyes and I have to fight the compulsion to scold her.My mom lives in Georgia with her new husband, Bob.My stepdad lives in Montesano.Of course I know all this from Welchs background check, but its important to hear it from her.Her lips soften with a fond smile when she mentions her stepdad.Your father?I ask.My father died when I was a baby.For a moment Im catapulted into my nightmares, looking at a prostrate body on a grimy floor.Im sorry, I mutter.I dont remember him, she says, dragging me back to the now.Her expression is clear and bright, and I know that Raymond Steele has been a good father to this girl.Her mothers relationship with her, on the other handthat remains to be seen.And your mother remarried?Her laugh is bitter.You could say that.But she doesnt elaborate.Shes one of the few women Ive met who can sit in silence.Which is great, but not what I want at the moment.Youre not giving much away, are you?Neither are you, she parries.Oh, Miss Steele.Game on.And its with great pleasure and a smirk that I remind her that shes interviewed me already.I can recollect some quite probing questions.Yes.You asked me if I was gay.My statement has the desired effect and shes embarrassed.She starts babbling about herself and a few details hit home.Her mother is an incurable romantic.I suppose someone on her fourth marriage is embracing hope over experience.Is she like her mother?I cant bring myself to ask her.If she says she isthen I have no hope.And I dont want this interview to end.Im enjoying myself too much.I ask about her stepfather and she confirms my hunch.Its obvious she loves him.Her face is luminous when she talks about him: his job (hes a carpenter), his hobbies (he likes European soccer and fishing).She preferred to live with him when her mom married the third time.Interesting.She straightens her shoulders.Tell me about your parents, she demands, in an attempt to divert the conversation from her family.I dont like talking about mine, so I give her the bare details.My dads a lawyer, my mom is a pediatrician.They live in Seattle.What do your siblings do?She wants to go there?I give her the short answer that Elliot works in construction and Mia is at cooking school in Paris.She listens, rapt.I hear Paris is lovely, she says with a dreamy expression.Its beautiful.Have you been?Ive never left mainland USA.The cadence in her voice falls, tinged with regret.I could take her there.Would you like to go?First Cabo, now Paris?Get a grip, Grey.To Paris?Of course.But its England that Id really like to visit.Her face brightens with excitement.Miss Steele wants to travel.But why England?I ask her.Its the home of Shakespeare, Austen, the Bront sisters, Thomas Hardy.Id like to see the places that inspired those people to write such wonderful books.Its obvious this is her first love.Books.She said as much in Claytons yesterday.That means Im competing with Darcy, Rochester, and Angel Clare: impossible romantic heroes.Heres the proof I needed.Shes an incurable romantic, like her motherand this isnt going to work.To add insult to injury, she looks at her watch.Shes done.Ive blown this deal.Id better go.I have to study, she says.I offer to walk her back to her friends car, which means Ill have the walk back to the hotel to make my case.But should I?Thank you for the tea, Mr.Grey, she says.Youre welcome, Anastasia.Its my pleasure.As I say the words I realize that the last twenty minutes have beenenjoyable.Giving her my most dazzling smile, guaranteed to disarm, I offer her my hand.Come, I say.She takes my hand, and as we walk back to The Heathman I cant shake how agreeable her hand feels in mine.Maybe this could work.Do you always wear jeans?I ask.Mostly, she says, and its two strikes against her: incurable romantic who only wears jeansI like my women in skirts.I like them accessible.Do you have a girlfriend?she asks out of the blue, and its the third strike.Im out of this fledgling deal.She wants romance, and I cant offer her that.No, Anastasia.I dont do the girlfriend thing.Stricken with a frown, she turns abruptly and stumbles into the road.Shit, Ana!I shout, tugging her toward me to stop her from falling in the path of an idiot cyclist whos flying the wrong way up the street.All of a sudden shes in my arms clutching my biceps, staring up at me.Her eyes are startled, and for the first time I notice a darker ring of blue circling her irises; theyre beautiful, more beautiful this close.Her pupils dilate and I know I could fall into her gaze and never return.She takes a deep breath.Are you okay?My voice sounds alien and distant, and I realize shes touching me and I dont care.My fingers caress her cheek.Her skin is soft and smooth, and as I brush my thumb against her lower lip, my breath catches in my throat.Her body is pressed against mine, and the feel of her breasts and her heat through my shirt is arousing.She has a fresh, wholesome fragrance that reminds me of my grandfathers apple orchard.Closing my eyes, I inhale, committing her scent to memory.When I open them shes still staring at me, entreating me, begging me, her eyes on my mouth.Shit.She wants me to kiss her.And I want to.Just once.Her lips are parted, ready, waiting.Her mouth felt welcoming beneath my thumb.No.No.No.Dont do this, Grey.Shes not the girl for you.She wants hearts and flowers, and you dont do that shit.I close my eyes to blot her out and fight the temptation, and when I open them again, my decision is made.Anastasia, I whisper, you should steer clear of me.Im not the man for you.The little v forms between her brows, and I think shes stopped breathing.Breathe, Anastasia, breathe.I have to let her go before I do something stupid, but Im surprised at my reluctance.I want to hold her for a moment longer.Im going to stand you up and let you go.I step back and she releases her hold on me, yet weirdly, I dont feel any relief.I slide my hands to her shoulders to ensure she can stand.Her expression clouds with humiliation.Shes mortified by my rebuff.Hell.I didnt mean to hurt you.Ive got this, she says, disappointment ringing in her clipped tone.Shes formal and distant, but she doesnt move out of my hold.Thank you, she adds.For what?For saving me.And I want to tell her that Im saving her from methat its a noble gesture, but thats not what she wants to hear.That idiot was riding the wrong way.Im glad I was here.I shudder to think what could have happened to you.Now its me thats babbling, and I still cant let her go.I offer to sit with her in the hotel, knowing its a ploy to prolong my time with her, and only then do I release her.She shakes her head, her back ramrod stiff, and wraps her arms around herself in a protective gesture.A moment later she bolts across the street and I have to hurry to keep up with her.When we reach the hotel, she turns and faces me once more, composed.Thanks for the tea and doing the photo shoot.She regards me dispassionately and regret flares in my gut.AnastasiaI I cant think what to say, except that Im sorry.What, Christian?she snaps.Whoa.Shes mad at me, pouring all the contempt she can into each syllable of my name.Its novel.And shes leaving.And I dont want her to go.Good luck with your exams.Her eyes flash with hurt and indignation.Thanks, she mutters, disdain in her tone.Good bye, Mr.Grey.She turns away and strides up the street toward the underground garage.I watch her go, hoping that shell give me a second look, but she doesnt.She disappears into the building, leaving in her wake a trace of regret, the memory of her beautiful blue eyes, and the scent of an apple orchard in the fall.THURSDAY, MAY 19, 2011    * * *      No!My scream bounces off the bedroom walls and wakes me from my nightmare.Im smothered in sweat, with the stench of stale beer, cigarettes, and poverty in my nostrils and a lingering dread of drunken violence.Sitting up, I put my head in my hands as I try to calm my escalated heart rate and erratic breathing.Its been the same for the last four nights.Glancing at the clock, I see its 3:00 a. m.   I have two major meetings tomorrowtodayand I need a clear head and some sleep.Damn it, what Id give for a good nights sleep.And I have a round of fucking golf with Bastille.I should cancel the golf; the thought of playing and losing darkens my already bleak mood.Clambering out of bed, I wander down the corridor and into the kitchen.There, I fill a glass with water and catch sight of myself, dressed only in pajama pants, reflected in the glass wall at the other side of the room.I turn away in disgust.You turned her down.She wanted you.And you turned her down.It was for her own good.This has needled me for days now.Her beautiful face appears in my mind without warning, taunting me.If my shrink was back from his vacation in England I could call him.His psychobabble shit would stop me feeling this lousy.Grey, she was just a pretty girl.Perhaps I need a distraction; a new sub, maybe.Its been too long since Susannah.I contemplate calling Elena in the morning.She always finds suitable candidates for me.But the truth is, I dont want anyone new.I want Ana.Her disappointment, her wounded indignation, and her contempt remain with me.She walked away without a backward glance.Perhaps I raised her hopes by asking her out for coffee, only to disappoint her.Maybe I should find some way to apologize, then I can forget about this whole sorry episode and get the girl out of my head.Leaving the glass in the sink for my housekeeper to wash, I trudge back to bed.THE RADIO ALARM JOLTS to life at 5:45 as Im staring at the ceiling.I havent slept and Im exhausted.Fuck!This is ridiculous.The program on the radio is a welcome distraction until the second news item.Its about the sale of a rare manuscript: an unfinished novel by Jane Austen called The Watsons thats being auctioned in London.Books, she said.Christ.Even the news reminds me of little Miss Bookworm.Shes an incurable romantic who loves the English classics.But then so do I, but for different reasons.I dont have any Jane Austen first editions, or Bronts, for that matterbut I do have two Thomas Hardys.Of course!This is it!This is what I can do.Moments later Im in my library with Jude the Obscure and a boxed set of Tess of the dUrbervilles in its three volumes laid out on the billiard table in front of me.Both are bleak books, with tragic themes.Hardy had a dark, twisted soul.Like me.I shake off the thought and examine the books.Even though Jude is in better condition, its no contest.In Jude there is no redemption, so Ill send her Tess, with a suitable quote.I know its not the most romantic book, considering the evils that befall the heroine, but she has a brief taste of romantic love in the bucolic idyll that is the English countryside.And Tess does exact revenge on the man who wronged her.But thats not the point.Ana mentioned Hardy as a favorite and Im sure shes never seen, let alone owned, a first edition.You sound like the ultimate consumer.Her judgmental retort from the interview comes back to haunt me.Yes.I like to possess things, things that will rise in value, like first editions.Feeling calmer and more composed, and a little pleased with myself, I head back into my closet and change into my running gear.IN THE BACK OF the car I leaf through book one of the Tess first edition, looking for a quote, and at the same time wonder when Anas last exam will take place.I read the book years ago and have a hazy recollection of the plot.Fiction was my sanctuary when I was a teenager.My mother always marveled that I read; Elliot not so much.I craved the escape that fiction provided.He didnt need an escape.Mr.Grey, Taylor interrupts.Were here, sir.He climbs out of the car and opens my door.Ill be outside at two oclock to take you to your golf game.I nod and head into Grey House, the books tucked under my arm.The young receptionist greets me with a flirtatious wave.Every dayLike a cheesy tune on repeat.Ignoring her, I make my way to the elevator that will take me straight to my floor.Good morning, Mr.Grey, Barry on security greets me as he presses the button to summon the elevator.Hows your son, Barry?Better, sir.Im glad to hear it.I step into the elevator and it shoots up to the twentieth floor.Andrea is on hand to greet me.Good morning, Mr.Grey.Ros wants to see you to discuss the Darfur project.Barney would like a few minutes  I hold my hand up to silence her.Forget those for now.Get me Welch on the line and find out when Flynn is back from vacation.Once Ive spoken to Welch we can pick up the days schedule.Yes, sir.And I need a double espresso.Get Olivia to make it for me.But looking around I notice that Olivia is absent.Its a relief.The girl is always mooning over me and its fucking irritating.Would you like milk, sir?Andrea asks.Good girl.I give her a smile.Not today.I do like to keep them guessing how I take my coffee.Very good, Mr.Grey.She looks pleased with herself, which she should be.Shes the best PA Ive had.Three minutes later she has Welch on the line.Welch?Mr.Grey.The background check you did for me last week.Anastasia Steele.Studying at WSU.Yes, sir.I remember.Id like you to find out when her last final exam takes place and let me know as a matter of priority.Very good, sir.Anything else?No, that will be all.I hang up and stare at the books on my desk.I need to find a quote.ROS, MY NUMBER TWO and my chief operating officer, is in full flow.Were getting clearance from the Sudanese authorities to put the shipments into Port Sudan.But our contacts on the ground are hesitant about the road journey to Darfur.Theyre doing a risk assessment to see how viable it is.Logistics must be tough; her normal sunny disposition is absent.We could always air drop.Christian, the expense of an airdrop  I know.Lets see what our NGO friends come back with.Okay, she says and sighs.Im also waiting for the all clear from the State Department.I roll my eyes.Fucking red tape.If we have to grease some palmsor get Senator Blandino to intervenelet me know.So the next topic is where to site the new plant.You know the tax breaks in Detroit are huge.I sent you a summary.I know.But God, does it have to be Detroit?I dont know what you have against the place.It meets our criteria.Okay, get Bill to check out potential brownfield sites.And lets do one more site search to see if any other municipality would offer more favorable terms.Bill has already sent Ruth out there to meet with the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, who couldnt be more accommodating, but Ill ask Bill to do a final check.My phone buzzes.Yes, I growl at Andreashe knows I hate being interrupted in a meeting.I have Welch for you.My watch says 11:30.That was quick.Put him through.I signal for Ros to stay.Mr.Grey?Welch.What news?Miss Steeles last exam is tomorrow, May twentieth.Damn.I dont have long.Great.Thats all I need to know.I hang up.Ros, bear with me one moment.I pick up the phone.Andrea answers immediately.Andrea, I need a blank notecard to write a message within the next hour, I say, and hang up.Right, Ros, where were we?AT 12:30 OLIVIA SHUFFLES into my office with lunch.Shes a tall, willowy girl with a pretty face.Sadly, its always misdirected at me with longing.Shes carrying a tray with what I hope is something edible.After a busy morning, Im starving.She trembles as she puts it on my desk.Tuna salad.Okay.She hasnt fucked this up for once.She also places three different white cards, all different sizes, with corresponding envelopes on my desk.Great, I mutter.Now go.She scuttles out.I take one bite of tuna to assuage my hunger, then reach for my pen.Ive chosen a quote.A warning.I made the correct choice, walking away from her.Not all men are romantic heroes.Ill take the word men folk out.Shell understand.Why didnt you tell me there was danger?Why didnt you warn me?Ladies know what to guard against, because they read novels that tell them of these tricks  I slip the card into the envelope provided and on it write Anas address, which is ingrained in my memory from Welchs background check.I buzz Andrea.Yes, Mr.Grey.Can you come in, please?Yes, sir.She appears at my door a moment later.Mr.Grey?Take these, package them, and courier them to Anastasia Steele, the girl who interviewed me last week.Heres her address.Right away, Mr.Grey.They have to arrive by tomorrow at the latest.Yes, sir.Will that be all?No.Find me a set of replacements.For these books?Yes.First editions.Get Olivia on it.What books are these?Tess of the dUrbervilles.Yes, sir.She gives me a rare smile and leaves my office.Why is she smiling?She never smiles.Dismissing the thought, I wonder if that will be the last I see of the books, and I have to acknowledge that deep down I hope not.FRIDAY, MAY 20, 2011    * * *      Ive slept well for the first time in five days.Maybe Im feeling the closure I had hoped for, now that Ive sent those books to Anastasia.As I shave, the asshole in the mirror stares back at me with cool, gray eyes.Liar.Fuck.Okay.Okay.Im hoping shell call.She has my number.Mrs.Jones looks up when I walk into the kitchen.Good morning, Mr.Grey.Morning, Gail.What would you like for breakfast?Ill have an omelet.Thank you.I sit at the kitchen counter as she prepares my food and leaf through The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, then I pore over The Seattle Times.While Im lost in the papers my phone buzzes.Its Elliot.What the hell does my big brother want?Elliot?Dude.I need to get out of Seattle this weekend.This chick is all over my junk and Ive got to get away.Your junk?Yeah.You would know if you had any.I ignore his jibe, and then a devious thought occurs to me.How about hiking around Portland.We could go this afternoon.Stay down there.Come home Sunday.Sounds cool.In the chopper, or do you want to drive?Its a helicopter, Elliot, and Ill drive us down.Come by the office at lunchtime and well head out.Thanks, bro.I owe you.Elliot hangs up.Elliot has always had a problem containing himself.As do the women he associates with: whoever the unfortunate girl is, shes just another in a long, long line of his casual liaisons.Mr.Grey.What would you like to do for food this weekend?Just prepare something light and leave it in the fridge.I may be back on Saturday.Or I may not.She didnt give you a second glance, Grey.Having spent a great deal of my working life managing others expectations, I should be better at managing my own.ELLIOT SLEEPS MOST OF the way to Portland.Poor fucker must be fried.Working and fucking: thats Elliots raison dtre.He sprawls out in the passenger seat and snores.Some company hes going to be.Itll be after three when we arrive in Portland, so I call Andrea on the hands free.Mr.Grey, she answers in two rings.Can you have two mountain bikes delivered to The Heathman?For what time, sir?Three.The bikes are for you and your brother?Yes.Your brother is about six two?Yes.Ill get on it right away.Great.I hang up, then call Taylor.Mr.Grey, he answers on one ring.What time will you be here?Ill check in around nine oclock tonight.Will you bring the R8?With pleasure, sir.Taylor is a car fanatic, too.Good.I end the call and turn up the music.Lets see if Elliot can sleep through The Verve.As we cruise down I 5 my excitement mounts.Have the books been delivered yet?Im tempted to call Andrea again, but I know Ive left her with a ton of work.Besides, I dont want to give my staff an excuse to gossip.I dont normally do this kind of shit.Why did you send them in the first place?Because I want to see her again.We pass the exit for Vancouver and I wonder if shes finished her exam.Hey, man, where we at?Elliot blurts.Behold, he wakes, I mutter.Were nearly there.Were going mountain biking.We are?Yes.Cool.Remember when Dad used to take us?Yep.I shake my head at the memory.My father is a polymath, a real renaissance man: academic, sporting, at ease in the city, more at ease in the great outdoors.Hed embraced three adopted kidsand Im the one who didnt live up to his expectations.But before I hit adolescence we had a bond.Hed been my hero.He used to love taking us camping and doing all the outdoor pursuits I now enjoy: sailing, kayaking, biking, we did it all.Puberty ruined all that for me.I figured if we were arriving mid afternoon, we wouldnt have time for a hike.Good thinking.So who are you running from?Man, Im a love em and leave em type.You know that.No strings.I dont know, chicks find out you run your own business and they start getting crazy ideas.He gives me a sideways look.Youve got the right idea keeping your dick to yourself.I dont think were discussing my dick, were discussing yours, and whos been on the sharp end of it recently.Elliot snickers.Ive lost count.Anyway, enough of me.Hows the stimulating world of commerce and high finance?You really want to know?I shoot him a glance.Nah, he bleats and I laugh at his apathy and lack of eloquence.Hows the business?I ask.You checking on your investment?Always.Its my job.Well, we broke ground on the Spokani Eden project last week and its on schedule, but then its only been a week.He shrugs.Beneath his somewhat casual exterior my brother is an eco warrior.His passion for sustainable living makes for some heated Sunday dinner conversations with the family, and his latest project is an eco friendly development of low cost housing north of Seattle.Im hoping to install that new gray water system I was telling you about.It will mean all the homes will reduce their water usage and their bills by twenty five percent.Impressive.I hope so.We drive in silence into downtown Portland and just as were pulling into the underground garage at The Heathmanthe last place I saw herElliot mutters, You know were missing the Mariners game this evening.Maybe you can have a night in front of the TV.Give your dick a rest and watch baseball.Sounds like a plan.KEEPING UP WITH ELLIOT is a challenge.He tears down the trail with the same devil may fucking care attitude he applies to most situations.Elliot knows no fearits why I admire him.But riding at this pace I have no chance to appreciate our surroundings.Im vaguely aware of the lush greenery flashing past me, but my eyes are on the trail, trying to avoid the potholes.By the end of the ride were both filthy and exhausted.That was the most fun Ive had with my clothes on in a while, Elliot says as we hand the bikes over to the bellboy at The Heathman.Yeah, I mutter, and then recall holding Anastasia when I saved her from the cyclist.Her warmth, her breasts pressed against me, her scent invading my senses.I had my clothes on thenYeah, I murmur again.We check our phones in the elevator as we head up to the top floor.I have e mails, a couple of texts from Elena asking what Im doing this weekend, but no missed calls from Anastasia.Its just before 7:00she must have received the books by now.The thought depresses me: Ive come all the way to Portland on a wild goose chase again.Man, that chick has called me five times and sent me four texts.Doesnt she know how desperate she comes across?Elliot whines.Maybe shes pregnant.Elliot pales and I laugh.Not funny, hotshot, he grumbles.Besides, I havent known her that long.Or that often.AFTER A QUICK SHOWER I join Elliot in his suite and we sit down to watch the rest of the Mariners game against the San Diego Padres.We order up steak, salad, fries, and a couple of beers, and I sit back to enjoy the game in Elliots easy company.Ive resigned myself to the fact that Anastasias not going to call.The Mariners are in the lead and it looks like it might be a blowout.Disappointingly it isnt, though the Mariners win 41.Go Mariners!Elliot and I clink beer bottles.As the postgame analysis drones on, my phone buzzes and Miss Steeles number flashes on the screen.Its her.Anastasia?I dont hide my surprise or my pleasure.The background is noisy and it sounds like shes at a party or in a bar.Elliot glances at me, so I get up off the sofa and out of his earshot.Why did you send me the books?Shes slurring her words, and a wave of apprehension ripples down my spine.Anastasia, are you okay?You sound strange.Im not the strange one, you are.Her tone is accusatory.Anastasia, have you been drinking?Hell.Who is she with?The photographer?Wheres her friend Kate?Whats it to you?She sounds surly and belligerent, and I know shes drunk, but I also need to know that shes okay.Imcurious.Where are you?In a bar.Which bar?Tell me.Anxiety blooms in my gut.Shes a young woman, drunk, somewhere in Portland.Shes not safe.A bar in Portland.How are you getting home?I pinch the bridge of my nose in the vain hope that the action will distract me from my fraying temper.Ill find a way.What the hell?Will she drive?I ask her again which bar shes in and she ignores my question.Why did you send me the books, Christian?Anastasia, where are you?Tell me now.How will she get home?Youre sodomineering.She giggles.In any other situation I would find this charming.But right nowI want to show her how domineering I can be.Shes driving me crazy.Ana, so help me, where the fuck are you?She giggles again.Shit, shes laughing at me!Again!Im in Portlands a long way from Seattle.Where in Portland?Good night, Christian.The line goes dead.Ana!She hung up on me!I stare at the phone in disbelief.No one has ever hung up on me.What the fuck!Whats the problem?Elliot calls over from the sofa.Ive just been drunk dialed.I peer at him and his mouth drops open in surprise.You?Yep.I press the callback button, trying to contain my temper, and my anxiety.Hi, she says, all breathy and timid, and shes in quieter surroundings.Im coming to get you.My voice is arctic as I wrestle with my anger and snap my phone shut.Ive got to go get this girl and take her home.Do you want to come?Elliot is staring at me as if Ive grown three heads.You?With a chick?This I have to see.Elliot grabs his sneakers and starts putting them on.I just have to make a call.I wander into his bedroom while I decide if I should call Barney or Welch.Barney is the most senior engineer in the telecommunications division of my company.Hes a tech genius.But what I want is not strictly legal.Best to keep this away from my company.I speed dial Welch and within seconds his rasping voice answers.Mr.Grey?Id really like to know where Anastasia Steele is right now.I see.He pauses for a moment.Leave it to me, Mr.Grey.I know this is outside the law, but she could be getting herself into trouble.Thank you.Ill get back to you in a couple of minutes.Elliot is rubbing his hands with glee, with a stupid smirk on his face when I return to the living room.Oh, for fucks sake.
