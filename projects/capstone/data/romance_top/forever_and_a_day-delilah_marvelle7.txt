Dont ever do 						that again.Still laughing, he yanked the sack from her arms and held out 						his other hand.Come.The marshals guarding the carriage are soaked to the 						skin and my father is as restless as they are.Even worse, people are 						gathering out of curiosity.Grasping his hand, she quickly 						followed him down the stairs and out into the rain, which had lessened to a 						soft mist.She nervously gathered her beige cotton skirts, lifting them 						above her ankle boots to keep them from touching the mud.Clean.She had to 						stay clean.Just as she was about to step 						off the pavement, Robinson grabbed hold of her waist and scooped her up and 						into his arms, balancing her and the sack all in one sweep.Oh!Her heart skipped as she grabbed on to his soaked coat to steady herself 						within his muscled arms.She glanced up at his well stubbled face, which 						hovered barely above her own.Whatever are you doin?I can carry myself, 						you know.Im ensuring you dont touch 						the mud.She grinned.Where, oh, where 						have you been all my life?You could have saved many a gown for 					me.He grinned, in turn.I regret 						not having been able to arrive into your life sooner, madam, but I intend to 						save every last one of your gowns from here on out.Carrying her toward the 						open door of the carriage, he leaned her up and toward the landing within 						the carriage, righting her effortlessly.The familiar scent of mulled 						spice and cedar tugged at her senses from the interior.It reminded her of 						when shed first met Robinson on the street.It smelled like him.Catching herself against the 						doorway, she hurried in and plopped herself onto an incredibly plush, soft 						seat opposite a stiff, aged man with silvery hair that had been swept back 						with tonic.The duke adjusted his 						well fitted black coat about himself and leaned back against the upholstered 						seat as if to better observe her.Noting those handsome, rather 						kind brown eyes intently scanning her face and gown, she primly arranged her 						best Sunday dress about herself, ensuring that it covered her 					ankles.She smiled brightly, placing her 						bare hands on her lap atop each other, as shed seen wealthy women do whilst 						riding about in their open carriages, and offered, Good mornin, Your 						Grace.I apologize for makin you wait.Tis a pleasure to make your 						acquaintance and I appreciate your generosity in allowin me to come.There.That was certainly polite enough without slathering too much honey 						all over the man.Holding her gaze, the duke 						inclined his silvery head toward her, but said nothing.At least she got the incline of 						a head and a direct look in the eye.That was far more than she was used to 						getting when heading into shops with placards in the window saying 						No Irish Need Apply.The carriage gently swayed as 						Robinsons tall, muscled frame entered.He bent forward to prevent his head 						from hitting the velvet pleated ceiling above them and seated himself beside 						his father, directly across from her, as the door to the carriage was 						slammed shut by the footman.Robinson leaned forward and set her sack beside 						her on the seat, tucking it deep into the corner.Leaning back again, he set 						his broad shoulders and cleared his throat, holding her gaze as if preparing 						her for a very long and very separate journey ahead.She gathered by the way he had 						opted to sit next to his father, instead of her, that a man was not supposed to sit 						anywhere near a lady whilst in a carriage.She had a niggling feeling that 						there were several thousand unspoken rules she had yet to learn.And here 						she thought wealthy women had it easy.Georgia paused and glanced 						around the lavish space of the carriage.Tut, tut, tut, was it ever fancy.One could turn it into a harem given that every inch of its walls and 						ceiling was fastened with gray velvet.The carriage rolled ahead, 						jerking her far forward and toward them.She squeaked, popping both hands 						out, and caught the edge of the seat to keep herself from spilling forward 						altogether.She gargled out a laugh in response to her own squeak and slid 						farther back against the cushioned seat, rearranging her skirts.I about 						fell off my seat with that one.Youd think theyd warn a woman with a bell 						or somethin.Unlike you boys sittin in flaps and trousers, I got a full 						set of skirts that couldve damn well left me showin nothin but arse over 						turkey.And that certainly wouldnt have been good.Robinson pressed a rigid hand to 						his mouth and glanced away, shifting toward the glass window at his elbow.He closed his eyes.Oh, no.She had said 						arse, 						hadnt she?She leaned back awkwardly 						against the upholstered seat and set her chin, feeling her cheeks growing 						unbearably warm.She glanced toward the duke, whose gray brows were still 						lifted toward his hairline.Forgive me, Your Grace.My mouth has yet to 						fully kiss the true meanin of bein civilized.The duke leaned over toward 						Robinson, who still sat with his hand over his mouth.Oh, London will be 						impressed with this one.Robinson dropped his hand 						heavily into his lap and blew out an exasperated breath.London be damned.What do they know about good character?Georgia pressed her lips 						together, knowing Robinson was nobly defending her.Drat his father.If the 						old man thought she couldnt be all boring and civilized like him, he had 						yet to see Georgia Emily Milton at her finest.Shed put every last woman in 						London to shame even if it meant biting her tongue until it bled, because 						she was marrying her Robinson and getting her field and her apple trees.Even God cannot change the 						past.Agathon, Nicomachean Ethics 						(Aristotle) (as published in 1566) The Adelphi 					Hotel I LEFT EVERYTHING UNTOUCHED.Everything.The duke gestured toward the large suite beyond the open door.Mock me for being sentimental, but I was so panicked about your 						disappearance that I felt if the servants touched even the bed, it would 						prohibit your return.Gripping the frame of the 						doorway, Roderick leaned in and scanned the overly decadent French inspired 						room.A sizable four poster bed had been done up with mounds of sterling 						white coverlets and goose down pillows.No more chairs, thank God.A 						mahogany table was set off to the side, laden with piles of books.A chair 						beside it had also been laden with books.This explained all of the stories 						and words in his head.He apparently had a fancy for literature.Though he tried to envision and 						match at least one of those items in his head and remember what this room 						might have meant to him, nothing came.Not a whisper and most certainly not 						a shout.Just beyond that table, a towering wardrobe and several open trunks 						revealed far more clothing than any one man really needed.And there was not 						one, but three walnut lacquered sideboards that had been tucked 						against the palomino walls with a mirror over each.Every sideboard had 						everything he needed to attend to his appearance as well as many daily 						comforts and extravagances.From tonic to brandy.He paused, his gaze falling on 						several crystal decanters of port and brandy alongside matching glasses all 						perfectly lining the top of the main sideboard.It appeared he liked to 						drink.Roderick glanced back at his 						father.How long have we been renting here?And what have we been doing 						with our time?His fathers gray brows came 						together.You and I have been renting several rooms for about seven months 						now and spent most of our hours investigating leads and interviewing 						debauched areas and souls I would rather forget.A breath escaped his 						fathers lips.Your disappearance was unnerving.I didnt know if it was 						related to Atwoods circle of people or because something else had 						happened.Rodericks brows came together.Who is this Atwood you keep referring to?The duke smiled, his eyes 						unexpectedly brightening.Once you have been properly tended to and settled 						in, we will talk more and get you reacquainted with your life.The man set 						his aged shaven chin and turned toward Georgia, who lingered quietly in the 						corridor behind them.Follow me.There is no need for you to linger about 						this corridor.The duke paused and flippantly tossed back at him, I had 						the footman assign her to room eight and twenty.That will ensure she is 						within your reach whenever you feel the need to call on her.Roderick drew in a ragged breath 						in agitation, feeling both his honor and Georgias being slapped.And this 						was just the beginning.Whilst I appreciate the arrangement, Your Grace, I 						ask that you not insinuate before her or myself that her only purpose is one 						suited to a bed.The man pointed at him with a 						gloved finger.I am merely laying out your own cards, boy.So dont you be 						tossing pawns at me.Mrs.Milton?This way, if you please.Setting both gloved hands behind 						his back, the duke stalked down the length of the corridor.He disappeared 						down one of the adjoining corridors.Georgia, whod been staring at 						the duke in what appeared to be genuine fascination, also set her hands 						behind her back.Swiveling on her heel, she strode after the duke, her 						skirts rustling about her extended long strides in a flurry as she 						replicated the mans gait right down to the bloody stagger.What was she doing?Georgia?he called out.She swung back toward him, those 						hands still set behind her back.Yes?Ive never seen you walk like 						that.What the hell are you doing?She set both hands on her hips.Observation is key, my dear Robinson.One must first learn what 						not to do 						before one can learn what they ought to do.His brows came together.That 						makes no sense whatsoever.Adhere to only what you should be 					doing.Oh, youre no fun at all.She 						eyed him and lowered her voice.Do all men of status walk around like 						that?He blinked.Walk around like 						what?She thumbed toward the direction 						the duke had disappeared to and then staunchly set her chin and brow, 						marching in place with her chest thrust forth.Its like hes marchin 						straight into the pissin mouth of hell but is damn proud of it.Oh, God.He was going to have to 						hire several hundred women to instruct her on how to bite that tongue, or 						twenty years would pass before his father would ever accept her.He angled toward her.I adore 						you to no end, Georgia, you know I do, but can you please not say 						piss, hell 						and damn, 						let alone use them all in one sentence?Tis incredibly important you mind your 						tongue or the man will never learn to see past it.She blinked, deflating her 						overexaggerated stance, and blurted, Im sorry.Youre right.She nodded 						and eyed him, playing with the tips of her fingers.Robinson?He smiled, sensing she was 						unusually anxious.Aside from taming crass words, he offered, just be 						yourself.There is no need for you to panic.Im not going 					anywhere.It isnt that.What, then?She hesitated, then lifted her 						gaze to his and whispered in a tone as if she feared the world would hear, 						I love you.I really do.And I cant believe youre takin me with 						you.His breath hitched at hearing 						those words for the first time.And I love you.I couldnt imagine leaving 						you behind.They lingered in the silence of 						the corridor, intently and heatedly staring each other down.He could feel 						her eyes and her stance caressing the length of his body and soul and 						inwardly yearned to make that caress real.Knowing he shouldnt linger, 						lest he make a dash for her and make a mess of all that he hoped for her and 						them, he cleared his throat and tried to sound indifferent.After you 						settle into your room, shall we meet over a late breakfast?He playfully 						lowered his voice.I have no doubt the food from here on out will be 						free.She giggled, her features 						brightening.Free is a price I can always afford.Late breakfast, it is.I 						should go.Lest your father think me rude.Turning, she swept down the 						remaining length of the corridor in her beige stitched gown, her corseted 						hips swaying with the unexpected grace of a woman in full possession of not 						only her body but the world.He drew in a ragged breath, 						watching those hips.Now that was a walk he could watch all day.She paused, as if sensing him 						watching her.Angling back toward him, she smiled and offered a sultry 						glance over her shoulder, which softened her features and those bright, 						mischievous green eyes.I might as well say this whilst were still alone.She lowered her voice.My room or yours tonight?And what time?Im feelin 						rather amorous, if you know what I mean.His pulse throttled against his 						ears just thinking about making her gasp beneath the movement of his body 						and his lust.He edged toward the safety of his room, whose door was still 						open, knowing they couldnt and they shouldnt and therefore they wouldnt.Damn his insufferable need to make her respectable at the cost of his own 						sanity.We cant.Her brows came together.Why 						not?Only Georgia would need an 						explanation.I He hissed out a breath in disbelief as to what he was 						about to say.She needed her respectability for it was the only form of 						dignity he was going to be able to bestow upon her.Desire and lust held no 						place in this.Not at the cost of her worth.We will reserve all intimacy 						for when we marry.Tis best.Her eyes widened.But that may 						take months.Fighting his own angst, he 						nodded.I know.I simply refuse to turn you into the mistress my father 						expects you to be.We already know what we want and need of each other.That 						isnt what this discussion is about.He cleared his throat, trying to 						stay focused.What we did over on Orange Street should have never happened.You deserve more than that and I intend to ensure it doesnt happen again.I 						want others to respect you in the same way I do.She fully faced him with her 						hands on her hips.You expect us towait until others approve of 						us?Yes.What if no one ever approves of 						us?What then?They will.No.They wont.Not in the way 						you want it, at least.I know what I am, Robinson, and they know what I am, 						and Ill never be able to change that even if I never bed you 					again.Georgia, please.He stared her 						down.A relationship can be founded outside a bed, despite what youve been 						taught to believe over in the Five Points.We will survive this and I will 						prove you wrong.She gasped.Dont you dare 						lecture me about the foundations of a relationship!I know what a bed is for 						and what is shared in it.I also know what happens when nothin is shared in 						it.She marched back toward him, fiercely holding his gaze as if he had 						best prepare himself for the worst.Im not settlin for anythin less than 						all of you.You hear?God save him.She was like a 						blazing fire and he the log.He shifted closer toward her.This isnt 						Orange Street anymore, Georgia.Your world as you know it and all of the 						rules have changed.Just as you did everything within your means to prevent 						me from 						getting dirked by pistol toting bastards, I am now doing everything in my 						means to prevent you from getting dirked from moral toting 						bastards.She glared up at him.Whilst I 						agreed to put on a jig and a show for the world to clap along to, I didnt 						agree to sell my soul to a man whos goin to lecture me on the sins 						bestowed unto us by Adam and bloody Eve.She pinned him with a 						self righteous stare.Last night, you asked about the dancin hole and what 						it meant to me.He blinked, half expecting her 						to say more, but when she didnt, he prompted, Yes?Im ready to tell you.She 						thrust out a reprimanding hip.Does respectable society allow for intimate 						conversations?Or is that banned, too?Her words stung, and the 						bewitching devil that she was, she knew it.He shifted toward her.You can 						always 						share in an intimate conversation with me.That is far different than us 						sharing a bed.Theyre actually one of the 						same, you prude.Only one involves the body and the other involves the soul, 						linkin the two together and makin them one.And regardless of what you and 						respectable 						society may think, she now shouted, pointing toward herself and then the 						floor, I need both to call this a bloody 					relationship!Gritting his teeth, he snapped a 						finger to the open door of his room at the insult.Given that you clearly 						wish to keep talking well above a rational tone, I demand you step into my 						room.Because I am not about to let you make a strumpet of yourself like 						this in public.Her lips parted.She slowly 						stepped back, searching his face.Youre not my Robinson.I dont know who 						you are.His gut twisted.I am still the 						same man, Georgia.What you dont seem to understand, however, is that men 						of my status do not go about bedding women outside of matrimony.Do I need 						to tell you what people will whisper about you?Do I?She kept on shaking her head 						from side to side, tears welling her eyes.Tis obvious youve got two 						opposin voices in your head.One belongin to my Robinson and the other to 						thisthisTremayne.But you cant be both, Robinson.You cant.Because 						theyre not the same men.What Robinson wants for me is what 						I want for 						me.Love with every breath, laughter when everythin is dire, kindness above 						all else and never endin honesty even when the world has none.As for what 						this Tremayne wants for me?Hell if I know what he 					wants!He threw his head back, praying 						he had the strength to survive against that fire that always seemed to sear 						him.You and I were born unto two different circles, and though we may love 						each other, if this is going to work, you will have to be the one to bend to 						the rules of my world.Because if I bend, Georgia, it will send us 						straight into poverty, and I will not have that for you or my children.I will not.Not after living it.He leveled his head.Glancing down the empty corridor 						to ensure their privacy, he met her gaze again.I want and need to know all 						about the history of the dancing hole and ask that we retire into my room to 						ensure your privacy.You think I care what the world 						thinks of me?They already passed judgment on me long ago.She crossed her 						arms over her breasts and shot him a cool, disapproving look.Once upon a 						time, there was a girl set to marry a dashin mason known as Garvin the 						divine.Every woman in the Five Points wanted to wear her apron, given he 						made almost four dollars a week.Though she wanted to bed this Garvin well 						before the weddin, he wouldnt let them, given he was a good Catholic.At 						the time, it irked her to wait, but she was glad for it, because she most 						certainly didnt end up with the bastard.Rodericks lips parted, knowing 						Georgia was actually talking about herself.Though he wanted to give way to 						a sweltering fury knowing that she had been involved with yet another man outside of 						her husband and John, he sensed this story was about to toss itself into a 						dark corner he had yet to understand.So why didnt you marry this Garvin?Why did you marry Raymond?She glanced off to the side and 						blinked rapidly.The night before she and Garvin were to marry before a 						priest, they went out to celebrate and have themselves a bit of mince pie 						and whiskey over at the dancin hole.Thats when the ever kind, ever 						serious and ever respectable Mr.Raymond George 						Milton, whom shed lived with since 						hed nobly rescued her out of a coal bin, followed them there.He sat in the 						corner of that dancin hole all night, quietly watchin her and Garvin.He 						sat there and sat there without movin until the place was empty of but 						three and a fiddler.Roderick couldnt breathe.What 						did he do?She trailed her gaze up back to 						his, her features tightening but her face remaining strong.What I hoped he 						would.He kneeled before the door and said, Georgia, I know you are set to 						marry, and fool that I am, I waited until the last breath, but to live 						without you would only make me feel as old as I already am.Say you love me.Say you love me, because I love you.I was as moved and astounded as I was overjoyed.Hed never once breathed his affection to me, even though I had secretly 						yearned to be with him since I was fifteen.Raymond was kind, noble and 						educated and dashin in a way no man in the Five Points was and always 						treated me with far more respect than Id ever given myself.It didnt 						matter that he was thirty five years older than me.I was madly in love with 						his mind and his soul and everythin hed given me as a person.He taught me 						to always 						want more for myself.She shook her head, lowering her 						gaze.And thats when Garvin hit him.Raymond took the blow but never 						fought back, sayin he had to say it and I was so glad he did.Because I 						loved him.Ive always loved him, but never once thought hed want me in 						that way, given I was nothin but a rag hed patched up.So I married 						Raymond the next morn despite bein spit at by Garvins family.You think I 						cared?Twas bliss Id found, and though I tried lovin Raymond the best I 						knew how, he always shied away from all things physical.It wasnt that he 						didnt lust for me.He did, and he proved it when I forced him to, but he 						had thisthis voice in his head that kept tellin him his age was a 						vice in our relationship.No matter how hard I tried, I couldnt dig that 						voice out.He kept thinkin he was debauchin a young girl hed managed to 						drag into his mess of a life, even though I was willin and a full eighteen 						and his wife.A lone tear trickled down the 						side of her cheek and a choked sob escaped her lips.And then Raymond, damn 						him, died all but seven weeks later, on his own at three and fifty.His 						heart stopped.I cried over that bastard to no end knowin that I gave him 						everythinmy heart, my body and soulonly to be left with nothin.And I 						fear Im goin down that path again with you.What if I give up everythin 						and only end up with nothin?What then, Robinson?What then?My heart can 						only be patched up so many times.Roderick swallowed, unable to 						quell the choking angst writhing within him.He reached out a trembling hand 						and cupped her tear streaked cheek, utterly and madly in love with 						everything she was.It didnt matter that he wasnt the first man to touch 						her or love her.What mattered was that she was giving him a chance to love 						her.Georgia, he rasped.I would force my own damn heart to beat beyond 						its years to be with you.Everything I am doing, I am doing for 					you.She pushed his hand away, 						swiping away tears.And theres Robinson again, reachin out for me in a 						way I know Tremayne wouldnt.She sniffed and sniffed again, waving her 						hand about.Im done tryin to figure out who you really are.Just tell 						Robinson, if hes listenin, that I fear this Tremayne is goin to break my 						heart because he and I were born of two different worlds.Her expression 						stilled and grew serious as she held his gaze.Just tell me.And be honest.Will you really be able to love me with enough fire to make this last for 						the rest of our days?Even if your father should turn against 					us?Georgia.Feeling the 						temperature of his body warming his still rain dampened clothes, he edged 						back to ensure he didnt grab for her lest he unravel and take her up 						against another wall.I know this fire and this passion within me will outlast 						everything and everyone around us.Let there be no doubt in 					that.She shook her head, her lips 						pinching together as if she were trying to fight the last of any emotion she 						felt.The words came out so beautifully, but instead of you steppin toward 						me, damn you, you stepped back.His throat tightened.Georgia, 						I  Dont you Georgia me.You 						asked me to never again kneel on broken glass and yet youre makin me kneel 						even though Im tryin to get up.Her green eyes were no longer streaked 						with anguish but with a raging fire that threatened to burn him to ash.Im 						willin to play whatever role you want me to durin the day, but Im not 						doin it when the curtain falls and the audience goes home at night.I need 						more than words to cradle against my heart whilst I sweat like a pig dancin 						in silk for you and the world.Still staring him down, she 						added, Im just not about to settle for a man who is goin to do the same 						thing to me that Raymond did.Makin me feel undesirable because of who and 						what I am.If I were you, Robinson, Id be in my room and in my bed at nine 						tonight or were done.You hear?Were done.She pointed at him one last 						time as if he were responsible for all of their troubles, then 						swung away and marched down the length of the corridor where the duke 						quietly lingered with both of his hands in his coat pockets.Roderick swiped his face in 						exasperation only to wince given his hand was still tender and 					raw.Your Grace, Georgia demurely 						intoned to the duke in a form of artificial passing.Im sorry.It needed 						to be said.The duke inclined his head.Lifting a gloved hand out of his coat pocket, he gestured toward the 						corridor beside them.The footman is ready to settle you into your 						room.Thank you, Your Grace.She 						glanced back toward Roderick, set her chin and majestically swept out of 						sight as if she were the duchess and he the derelict.Damn her.The duke slowly made his way 						toward him.Yardley.And so, yet another battle was 						set to begin.Yes, yes.I know, I know.There is a problem.Roderick 						gestured toward the open door of his room.Can we take this 					inside?Yes.I would prefer that.The 						duke strode past and into the room beyond.Roderick followed him in.Quickly shutting the door, he swung back, meeting those overly serious brown 						eyes.How much of our conversation did you actually overhear?Her voice carried itself down 						every single last corridor long before I made it back into sight.I heard 						everything.And I do mean everything.The duke winced and adjusted his 						black morning coat.Roderick groaned and bit back 						his frustration.I ask that you forgive her.She is incredibly 						passionate.The duke reached out and laid a 						heavy hand on his shoulder, bringing the scent of cigars and port.He leaned 						in and lowered not only his gaze but his voice.Yardley.You will never 						hear me say this again, for it is none of my business who you love, but you 						would be a bastard of the worst sort to destroy that poor woman by dragging 						her into your life.It sounds as if she has already endured more than 						enough.You shouldnt ask her to endure more.Roderick glanced toward him in 						heart pounding astonishment.The man had indeed heard everything and 						apparently had wanted to hear everything to have lingered about so damn 						long.Violently shoving that large 						hand away from his shoulder, Roderick stepped back.Setting aside that you 						had no right to willfully impose and listen in on what you knew to be a private 						conversation, I am not about to stand here and listen to you prattle on as 						to how I seek to destroy her.You are the one putting your name and wealth before what is 						most important to melove.The duke pointed at him, shaking 						his gray head, and edged back.No.That is where you are wrong.For I 						wholeheartedly believe in love and would never put anything before it.I was 						married to your mother, for Gods sake, and that was a love I dare you and the 						rest of the world to match!The duke dropped his hand 						heavily to his side and glanced away.Drawing in a ragged breath, he hissed 						it out, lowering his gaze.I never knew fire until your mother came along.The duke threw back his head and blinked rapidly as if fighting tears.The 						very thought of her still makes me ache despite her being gone all these 						years.It just so happened that she and I were born of the same world.Such 						is not the case with you and Mrs.Milton.The duke leveled his head.Even 						if I allowed you to marry this poor girl for love, in the end, it is not you 						or I who will suffer, but her.Bless her heart, but that woman doesnt 						breathe like us or think like us.Your desire to make her into the sort of 						woman London will accept is ludicrous.It takes years to create the lady London wants 						and by then shell be dead to you.They will only shred her apart and shun 						her until all of that fire you love in her will turn against you and burn 						you to cinder like you damn well deserve.Grabbing hold of both his 						shoulders, the duke turned him toward himself and shook him gently.Our 						wealth and our name are strong.They will survive this if I relent, give or 						take a gash or two.But she wont survive any of it.She sees the tide rising 						well above her head and is already warning you of it, yet she is still 						willing to drown for you.By God.That is a woman worth loving, and I am 						asking you to not only love the poor girl, but save her.Your mind isnt 						what it should be, which is the only reason why I have to tell you any of 						this.She will have everything except for the one thing that matters 						mostrespect.And that respect will never be earned by handing over our 						title through marriage.She will only be seen as some wretch you plucked up 						off the street.Is that what you want for her?Shifting his jaw, Roderick 						glanced away and eased out of his fathers grasp.What are you asking me to 						do?I am asking you to let her go 						before she suffers beyond anything your love could save her from.You must 						not remember what truly awaits her in London, Yardley.Or you wouldnt do 						this to her.I know you wouldnt.Not if you loved her.Roderick squeezed his eyes shut 						in anguish.He was damned either way.To live with her meant seeing 						her suffer, 						but to live without her wouldnt be a life worth living at all.He reopened his eyes.I cannot 						let her go.She is the only thing left in my life that feels real.I still 						know nothing of myself other than I am surrounded by a tainted world that 						wont even allow me to love the woman I want to love.Do you know how 						goddamn bizarre all of this is to me?I cant breathe knowing that I may be 						forced to live forever within a mind that isnt even my own.A mind that 						cannot remember anything!The duke was quiet for a long 						moment.Though you have yet to know it, you are still the same man.Let me 						tell you who you are.You are a good man.A man who has always sought to do 						right by himself and others.You are also a learned man who earned not one 						but seven Oxford degrees by the time you were nineteen, putting your damned 						brother and everyone, including myself, to shame.Sadly, despite all that 						astounding knowledge you acquired, much like the rest of us male idiots 						roaming the world, you were unable to translate a womans heart.Tis an 						age old dilemma no university will resolve.You didnt learn that sometimes 						a man must set aside his passion before it destroys the woman he claims to 						love.Such was your story with the marchioness, and sadly, such will be this 						story.Roderick glanced toward him, 						unable to believe a word of it.He had destroyed a woman?With his love?Was 						this before or after he had involved himself with his brothers 					wife?The duke paused and patted him 						on the shoulder.Do what you will, Yardley.I am merely trying to give you 						sound advice.Something I havent done much of throughout the years, given 						all of my damned responsibilities to the estate and life in between.Just 						know that regardless of what you decide, even if you should choose to make 						her a wife, I have decided I will stand by it.Because a true father doesnt 						abandon his son in a time of need, especially when it involves his lifelong 						happiness.The duke patted his shoulder one 						last time.I am in room one and twenty should you feel the need to further 						discuss this.We have ten days before we leave to London, which gives you 						more than enough time to resolve this.Now.I want you to get out of these 						wet clothes.Ive already called for the footmen and the valet.They will be 						here shortly.The duke hesitated as if wanting to say more, but instead 						strode back toward the door.Opening it, he glanced toward Roderick one last 						time and closed the door behind himself.When would he remember his mess 						of a life?When would any of this make sense?When would he be able 						to?Stalking toward the closed door, 						Roderick gnashed his teeth and kicked that door with a muddied boot, marking 						it with sludge.Gritting his teeth, he kicked the door again and again and 						again, trying to lash out his frustration, wishing that the entire world 						would just stay the hell out of his head.He stumbled back, leaving the 						pristine oak paneled door smudged with booted muddy marks, and tried to 						level out of his ragged breathing.Dearest God.He was going to have to 						decide on something that would haunt him and Georgia for the rest of their 						lives.He didnt know if he had it in him to let her go, even if it meant 						seeing her suffer at the hands of the London elite.Removing his muddied boots, he 						tossed them aside and stripped his soaked stockings, drenched coat, shirt, 						waistcoat and trousers, flinging them away one by one.Standing in mere 						undergarments, he stalked toward one of the open trunks and whipped out a 						dry snowy white linen shirt, yanking it up and over himself.He tugged it 						down into place and smoothed it against his chest with a shaky hand, feeling 						the warmth slowly returning to his still cool, damp skin.He paused and 						glanced toward his feet, realizing a strip of crumpled black silk had fallen 						out of the trunk when hed swiped up his shirt.He blinked.He knew what it was.It was a mourning band worn to denote the memory of someone lost.The same 						one Georgia had insisted hed worn the day they had met on Broadway.It 						appeared he had more than one mourning band made.For how else would it have 						appeared here at the hotel?He bent and carefully gathered 						the silk, fingering it.When would he remember the brother and the life he 						had lost?He glanced up and scanned the countless, useless items cluttering 						the room.Aside from the mourning band itself, nothing seemed to whisper of 						who he had once been.It only bespoke of wealth, extravagance and cosmetic 						comfort that had been blanked by a self righteous mask of importance.Had he 						only cared about all things superficial?He tightened his hold on the 						black silk, wishing that its touch could fill this void that continued to 						linger in his head.Though he didnt remember being the cad his father 						described, he was already becoming one by forcing Georgia into a life she 						clearly didnt want to be a part of.Rodericks gaze paused on the 						one thing in the room that did whisper of who he might have really been.Those methodically piled old leather bound books, which had been stacked 						atop one another on a sizable mahogany table and a chair.Given their frayed 						white edges, they appeared to be well read and old, and given how perfectly 						they had been arranged and aligned atop one another, they also appeared to 						have been well loved and important to him.He wandered over to the table, 						his brows coming together as he set the mourning band aside.One of the old 						books had been left open and set apart from the others.It was as if it was 						the last thing he had touched before leaving this room and disappearing from 						his own life.Leaning toward it, Roderick 						dragged and angled the open book toward himself and read the first words he 						saw.How miserably am I 						singled out from the enjoyment or company of all mankind.Like a hermit 						(rather should I say, a lonely anchorite) am I forced from human 						conversation.I have no creature, no soul to speak to; none to beg 						assistance from.Those achingly miserable words penetrated his own 						breath like a blazing sword being plunged straight through his throat.He 						knew what 						this was.Hed read it countless times since youth.Roderick paged through the 						musty, browning and roughened pages and slapped the book shut.The worn 						leather binding revealed the fading gold lettering of the words The Life and Most Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, 						of York, Mariner.This book had once been his 						life.Grabbing it up, he savagely dug 						his fingertips into that well worn hard binding, drawing in uneven, ragged 						breaths.Every last emotion and thought hed kept in his head, his heart and 						his soul exploded like thunder, causing his vision to blur against tears as 						he tried to ease the excessive trembling in his hands in an effort to keep 						holding that book.He remembered.He remembered everything.He winced.Everything, that is, 						except for a sizable blank that simply wasnt there.Why couldnt he 						remember getting on a boat or arriving in New York?Why couldnt he remember 						what hed done all of these months whilst in the city of New York?And why 						couldnt he remember Atwood or?He paused, swallowing hard.Dearest God.He and his father had found Atwood.He was alive.Smite him, what a mess this was.What a mess.Aside from Atwood, he still couldnt remember the one thing 						he wanted to remember most: meeting Georgia prior to that omni mishap that 						had rendered his mind blank.Not that it mattered 						anymore.His father was right.His circle 						would never accept Georgia as his wife, and in time, she would only hate him 						in the way she already did for trying to change her, and that he could never live 						with.For her sake and for the writhing love he would feel for her given all 						that she had done for him when he had no one and nothing, not even a thought 						in his head, he would give her everythingby letting her 					go.It was time to send good old 						Robinson Crusoe back into the pages of a book where he belonged.Gently setting his book atop the 						stack of other books that had been given to him by his mother long ago, 						Roderick aligned it with the others with a trembling hand.He simply was 						never meant to know happiness.Not in this lifetime.A knock made him glance 						up.Your bath is ready, my lord, a 						footman called from the other side of the closed door.He cleared his throat, trying to 						erase any lingering emotion that still rattled his thoughts.Thank you.You 						may enter.The door veered wide and a 						procession of footmen in gray livery entered carrying in a large bathing tub 						and buckets and buckets of steaming hot water.Once he had soaked, scrubbed and 						shaved and returned to a state of physical cleanliness he hadnt seen in 						days, he would go to his father and announce that he was leaving Georgia 						behind.Not because he didnt love her, but because of a new and far more 						disturbing memory.He refused to destroy Georgia in the same way he had 						allowed Margaret to destroy him by turning him into something he was 						not.Reader, I think proper, before we 						proceed any farther together, to acquaint 						thee, that I intend to digress through this whole 						history Henry Fielding, The History of Tom Jones 						(1749) This is what had actually 						been, once upon a damn time in a faraway land known as England ANYONE WHO HAD EVER MET Viscount Roderick 						Gideon Tremayne, if even for a quarter of an hour, became fully aware that 						he was unlike any man in London.Or England, for that matter.To some, he 						was a quintessential genius whom scholars idolized for having earned seven 						Oxford degrees by the time he was nineteen.To others, Roderick was nothing 						more than an overeducated prick.In truth, he simply held no patience for 						those who werent as devoted to the art of learning as he.His fondest memory, even as a 						tot, was tucking himself against the skirts of his governess at the base of 						her chair, and demanding she read his favorite story, The Life and Most Surprising Adventures of Robinson 						Crusoe by Daniel Defoe.The moment 						shed finish, hed promptly supply, Again.Only slower.After all, the 						story should have lasted six days.Not four.The woman would dutifully page 						to the beginning and read Robinsons story all over again, drawing out the 						words in an effort to better please him.The moment shed finish, he would 						tug on her skirts and demand, Again.Please?The poor woman had no choice 						but to commence reading it again and again.Despite him being only four, she 						eventually insisted to his mother and father, the Duke and Duchess of 						Wentworth, that he learn how to read, given his most unusual fondness for 						it.His father thought him far too young for such an ambitious endeavor, but 						his mother agreed, insisting that he should commence at once, given his 						unprecedented interest.Her only rule was that he was never allowed to touch 						or read any books pertaining to the French Revolution.It was divine intervention.Reading was like discovering how to spin gold out of paper.Although 						Robinson Crusoe was well below his level of intelligence even at 						four, hed always identified with being shipwrecked and, in turn, felt that 						he was the only civilized person left in the world.His father and brother were 						certainly proof of that.As Roderick grew older, the duke only insisted he 						play more, not read more.Whilst his brother, who had been born first and 						therefore had been graced with the grand title of Marquess of Yardley, only 						trotted around the house with a blunt edged sword and hit everything with 						itincluding Roderick.Yardley would insist that he learn to be a man of 						twelve, like him, by carrying his own blunt edged sword, so that they could 						battle Napoleon and his minions together.Despite being three years 						younger than his brother, Roderick always felt as if he was the more mature 						of the two and loathed the idea of playing a Brit going up against the 						French.Napoleons confinement to the island of Saint Helena in that year of 						1815 by the British had reignited a burst of patriotism across England that 						had leaked into their fathers conversations and straight into Yardleys 						gullible head.No one seemed to understand that Napoleon had been far more 						educated than most Englishmen, which was probably why it had been so damn 						difficult for the British to defeat him.Brain Over Brawn was his motto and, 						oh, how he wished it was everyone elses, too.In an effort to avoid playing 						with his brother, the moment the sun touched the sky, Roderick would slip 						into the farthest corner of the house with a book hed stolen from his 						fathers library and disappear.Yardley only saw Rodericks need for privacy 						as great sport.With that blunt edged sword held high, Yardley would dash 						through the vast corridors of their Wentworth home and strategically march 						from room to room hollering Tremaaaaaaaaaaayne!like the savage 						that he was.No matter how well Roderick hid, 						that bastard always managed to yank him out of whatever corner, room or 						wardrobe he was hiding in.In regime style, Yardley would then point the tip 						of his sword at Rodericks unevenly buttoned waistcoat and say, Youd best 						cooperate or Ill tell Father that youre stealing books out of the library 						again.You know he doesnt want you reading books that arent appropriate 						for your age.Everything about his brother was 						so annoying, and him being heir only further overinflated that stupid head.Even worse, no rational form of explanation kept Yardley from seizing one of 						Rodericks own books and dangling it over the hearth as ransom for play.Yardley knew that the dangling of any book over a flame always riled 						Roderick into full cooperation.Despite grudgingly relenting to his bullying 						every time, Roderick insisted on being Napoleon Bonaparte himself instead of 						a mere British soldier, for at least then he could lay out maps and 						strategize how to take over the world.When hed grown tired of having 						his best maps ripped in half and being called a Frenchie by his brother, which yielded 						no educational benefits whatsoever, he refused to play with Yardley ever 						again.It earned him not only several unmerciful blows to the head that made 						him bleed, but resulted in the charring of his favorite 1734 edition of 						The Complete Mineral Laws of 						Derbyshire by George Steer.Roderick did everything he could 						to keep himself from sobbing like a girl when he finally dragged himself up 						off the floor.He eventually sniffed himself over to his father and choked 						through tears about his burned book and the fists hed taken to the 						head.Every time, his father would 						jump to his feet and roar toward the open doors, Yardley!How many times 						do I have to crop you?How many?Leonard, really, his mother 						would insist in a stern tone.Instead of yelling across the house, go 						directly to him and take care of it.And when you are done, send him my way.I am rather concerned with that boys aggressive tendencies.I suggest we 						take away his sword.Oh, how he loved his mother so!Even the utterance of her nameAugustine Jane Ascott, Her Grace the Duchess 						of Wentworthdefined her beauty and glittering greatness.She was an 						astonishing sixteen years younger than his staunch, overly serious father 						and was therefore youthful and compassionate, but firm when most needed, and 						above all, always sought to support his love for the written word.She would 						even sneak various books out from the library for him, always whispering 						that it was their little secret.It included books that popped his eyes wide 						open.Like Le Diable amoureux by Jacques Cazotte.It made him want to move to 						France and take a wife at the age of eleven.In 1818, on his twelfth 						birthday, his mother, whose belly was large with yet another child, had 						gifted him with a stack of ten books ranging from the philosophies of 						Socrates to the The Arabian Nights 						Entertainments.Inside each book, she 						had slipped a single uneven strip of parchment imprinted with ink that he 						was supposed to piece together with all the rest like a puzzle.She insisted 						that once pieced together the parchments would lead them on the greatest 						adventure they would ever know, but that she would only share said adventure 						after shed 						given birth and after hed read all ten books.Roderick commenced reading 						within the hour and hoped to finish all ten books before his next sibling 						arrived.He also prayed unto whatever Lord there was that his sibling was a 						girl.He preferred having dolls and gowns thrown at him, as opposed to fists 						and swords.Two days and four hours later, 						his mother died attempting to give birth to what would have been a little 						girl who hadnt properly turned within his mothers womb.His mothers 						screams, which had echoed throughout the halls well into the night, though 						forever silenced, still echoed within his mind and his soul, for he had lost 						the only person who had truly loved him.Hed never stood second in her 						eyes.Not once.Not ever.His father went into an 						unconventional form of mourning that demanded they pray before her portrait 						every Sunday after church for the rest of their lives.The man swore never 						to marry again and never did.Unlike his brother and father, 						who solemnly bore their suffering in silence like real men, Roderick sobbed 						through his prayers like the sop that he was, knowing that his mother was 						never coming back.His mother had wanted him to be 						a great scholar, whilst his father only wanted him to be a mere boy.So in 						honor of his dear mother, whom he still sought to make proud, Roderick 						became both.He donned a sword during the day to please his father and 						brother, and at night, he retired into his covert library in the dressing 						chamber and read the remaining books his mother had gifted unto him.The 						moment he finished each book, he anxiously pieced together yet another strip 						of the uneven parchment hoping to discover what had been left 					unsaid.When Roderick had at long last 						finished reading all ten of his mothers books, and had pieced together all 						ten of those uneven parchments, he was astonished to discover it was a map 						of New York City as had been laid out by the commissioners and altered and 						arranged to the present time.One area, in particular, to the far east of 						that map had been circled with smeared black ink, similar to how a thief 						might have marked his next heist.Though he had asked his father 						about the map and why his mother had given it to him, the duke became 						unusually huffy and demanded he put it away lest he burn it.It was a very 						odd reaction to a mere map, but he most certainly didnt want to upset his 						father.So Roderick tucked the mysterious map within the pages of his 						Robinson Crusoe, which he always kept at his bedside, hoping that he 						would eventually come to understand its true meaning.In the year of 1819, which 						marked the one year anniversary of his mothers death, two days before he 						was set to leave the house and join his brother at Eton, he pulled out all 						ten strips of the map in her honor and pieced it back together again.He 						strategically laid everything out across the floor of the library wondering 						if his mother had actually wanted them to go to the marking shown.And if 						so, why?What would he find there?When his father strode into the 						library unannounced and saw him hovering over the map, the man frantically 						gathered all of the pieces and insisted he cease meddling with superstitious 						taradiddles.Though his father tried to burn the pieces, Roderick flung 						himself before the hearth and begged in the name of his mother that it not 						be done.His father grudgingly relented 						by returning the pieces back into his hands under the proviso that he never 						see it again.To ensure its safety from any of Yardleys book burning rants, 						Roderick stacked all ten of his mothers books and tucked all the pieces of 						her map between the pages of his Robinson 						Crusoe.He then snuck up into the 						garret and buried his mothers books in his covert trunk.Two days later, he left the 						house to join his brother at Eton.He forever worried about that map, but 						was too paranoid to mention it to anyone lest he be robbed of it.Every 						holiday, when he and Yardley visited their father between academic terms, he 						would tiptoe into the garret at night to ensure that his trunk and its 						contents were still there.They always were.In time, he became far less 						paranoid and thought of it less and less.Life held far too many of its own 						adventures and he most certainly was not old enough to travel to New York 						City on his own.He was simply going to have to be patient and bide his 						time.Unlike his brother, Tremayne 						reveled and thrived at Eton and became rather popular with all the boys 						because he was always willing to do everyones work in exchange for books he 						couldnt afford to buy on the measly pension his father gave him.Roderick 						soon acquired an extensive and impressive collection of more than three 						hundred books on divinity, civil history, poetry, anatomy and 						jurisprudence.Based on his perfect marks that 						exceeded even his own expectations, the headmaster transitioned him straight 						into Oxford University at a mere fourteen.When Roderick had effortlessly 						passed every examination required of him during his terms and became the 						youngest Oxford scholar to hold a degree at sixteen, his father said, By 						God.That all went rather fast.What now?You dont plan on getting more 						degrees, do you?That only irked Roderick into 						throwing himself all the more into university life, which had become his 						greatest passion.By nineteen, he had acquired a total of seven degrees, 						astounding university professors into thinking he was a genius.He wasnt.He merely had the unique ability to remember everything he read.But his father, damn him, only 						kept interrupting his studies by nagging Roderick on the hour about his lack 						of social 						interaction.The mans definition of social meant women.Because Roderick 						was always out and about socializing with scholars, professors, students and book 						collectors.His fathers nagging stemmed from quips in all the circles that 						Roderick was not only a virgin, but a bibliomaniac who preferred a good book 						over a woman.Which was, in fact, true.He 						did prefer 						a good book over a woman and was indeed a virgin.Not because he was a queer 						who didnt find women attractive, but because the women in his books were 						far more fascinating than the ones surrounding him.If swiving was about all 						a real 						woman could offer him outside the pages of a book, he knew he could easily 						accomplish equal ecstasy from a pornographic novel without the complication 						of being nagged by yet another person who would never understand him.Based on all the 						grouching of fellow university friends who only complained about their woes 						regarding sex and women over decanters of port, he simply wasnt interested 						in joining in on the grouching.Despite his unconventional view, 						he acknowledged his fathers concerns and, like a good son, tried to render 						the quips.He sought to keep it respectable, however, by methodically 						planning out how he was going to land the perfect wife by creating a list of 						all the qualities he sought in a woman.When he arrived in London during the 						opening Season of 1828, at the age of two and twentyand yes, still very 						much a virginRoderick announced to his father that he was ready to wade 						through the marriageable women London had to offer.His father astounded him by 						handing him a cigar, even though Roderick didnt smoke.The man then 						proceeded to strut around the study like a rooster about to mount his last 						hen and clucked on and on about all the grandchildren hed have and how he 						hoped it was soon, given that Yardley was more interested in bordellos than 						marriage and duty.Roderick had at long last found 						something to make the old man proud.With that newfound pride in his pocket, 						Roderick donned his finest, ensuring the valet trimmed his hair, which was 						beginning to hang well past his eyes, and took on the appearance of a true 						gentleman in honor of the Wentworth name.He vowed to marry the most 						beautiful, intelligent and respectable woman London had to offer and rode 						out into the crowds to find her.Night after night, he endured 						pointless conversations about food and wine and danced alongside morbidly 						silent debutantes.Yardley only annoyed him 						throughout his hunt for a wife by swooping in on him at gatherings and 						mouthing excessive encouragement from behind a hand shortly before Roderick 						was set to dance.Always dance with the one with the largest tits, 						Tremayne.They jiggle more.Same rule should apply to the wife you take.After all, you will be looking at the same goddamn tits for the rest of your 						life.Yardley was breathing proof that 						some men remained children all of their lives.Needless to say, Roderick was 						beginning to lose hope that any woman would ever catch his eye.But then it 						happenedmuch like a stray arrow piercing his heart on an angle between the 						fourth and fifth ribs, just as diagrammed in his anatomy book.A certain 						Lady Margaret, with bright blue eyes and curling blond hair, made her debut 						and breezed into Londons ballrooms, catching not only his eye, but every mans 						whod ever been born with an ambition to love.Whilst every man of the 						ton, 						including Yardley himself, went about quietly admiring her with a reserved 						reverence that was expected from respectable society, Roderick went about 						shouting out his admiration at every breathing turn.His father had to repeatedly 						tell him to calm down.Those first few times her pretty 						gaze had fluttered over to his, endless unwritten words floated between 						them, stirring far more than his mind.He had at long last discovered the 						savage need to hold more than a book and finally knew why men subjected 						themselves to a lifetime of grouching.Lady Margaret was everything 						known as divine.She danced with him at every ball whenever he asked her to 						put his name on her dance card.She always seemed to dance with far more 						enthusiasm whenever it was with him, especially if it involved the 						ever daring waltz.Her gloved hand would squeeze his in the oddest of 						moments during their gliding steps, as if she were openly professing her 						love.He returned each and every squeeze of that small hand, assuring her 						that he ardently felt the same.She laughed so beautifully 						whenever he expounded upon humor that no one else thought was funny, and 						listened to everything he had to say, no matter how boring.There was one 						particular night, however, that hed never forget.It was the night when he grabbed 						her hand and placed it over his heart on his chest, whilst they lingered in 						the alcove during a gathering at his grandparents home.Her chaperone had 						been unusually preoccupied in speaking to his grandmother across the room, 						so he deviously took advantage of it.Lady Margaret responded by grabbing 						his own hand and setting it back onto his chest over his heart, whispering, 						You must call on me and Mama with an offer.Why do you wait?He had waited because he wanted 						to be sure she felt the same.He had doubted that she had, given all the 						damned rules of their circle that didnt allow them to convey what it was 						they truly felt for each other.He knew it was time to propose before 						someone else did and approached his father about it.His father not only 						consented to the match, but was so thrilled that he insisted Roderick call 						on the woman and her mother at once to ensure a June wedding.So Roderick decided to send over 						a footman with a note to the marchioness, requesting he be allowed to call 						upon her.He was worried that his note would get lost amidst the throngs of 						bouquets, visitors and calling cards from countless other gentlemen, both 						titled and gentry alike, who littered his Margarets doorstep on the hour 						like an infestation of locusts out of the Bible.He panicked upon 						discovering one of those titled men was none other than his own damn 						brother.But he outsmarted them 						all.Roderick paid every last one of 						Lady Morrows servants to strategically place his note on the marchionesss 						dressing table as opposed to the parlor.Within a day, a messenger presented 						him with an invitation from the marchioness to call upon her and her 						daughter, Lady Margaret.That was when he knew he was going to be a husband.He and his father merrily toasted and drank port in honor of his 						success.Nervous as hell, Roderick 						arrived with his hat in hand, and waited in a pale blue drawing room that 						had been fragranced with expensive French perfume.It was a strong lilac 						scent he would forever associate with the frantic beat of his heart and that 						glorious moment when his Margaret and her staunch widow of a mother, Lady 						Morrow, sashayed into the room in unison to formally greet him.Margaret beamed as she and her 						mother gracefully seated themselves on the settee across from him and he 						knew that it was time to toss the dice in the right direction.So he 						commenced their conversation by stepping away from all things formal and 						sharing A Dissertation on the Phaedon of 						Plato and its investigation of the 						nature of the soul.It was cheeky and metaphoric.Margaret stifled a laugh, 						while the marchioness only tartly stared him down.Sensing the womans humor was 						similar to that of his fathers, he casually inquired about nothing in 						particular.The marchioness looked decidedly more pleased and proceeded to 						discuss the weather, before pausing to inquire about his fathers health and 						if he was taking care of himself for she was rather worried he wasnt.Ghastly though it wasfor his father took very good care of himselfRoderick 						sensed she wanted to know when his brother would be inheriting.Barely twenty minutes into his 						call, the marchioness visibly grew bored and glanced toward the French clock 						on the mantelpiece, signaling that his visit was over.He knew it was now or 						never.Lady Morrow, he announced in a 						formal tone.Before I depart, I humbly wish to claim the honor of your 						daughters hand in matrimony.Roderick drew in a steadying breath.I love 						her.The marchioness paused and 						leveled him with an alarmed stare.Whilst I am endlessly humbled, Lord 						Tremayne, I regret to inform you, especially given your unexpected affection 						for my daughter, that Lord Yardley has already offered on her hand and I 						have accepted his offer all but two days ago.I invited you to call on me 						today, not to entertain an offer, but as a means of getting to know you as 						family.Roderick met Margarets 						bewildered gaze, which reflected his own, and felt himself unable to 						breathe.What?Margaret intently held his gaze, 						fear and angst noticeably freezing those blue eyes and trembling lips.I 						She lowered her gaze and after a long moment confided, I was not aware of 						the offer, my lord.Roderick shifted forward in his 						seat, trying to rein in his disbelief.He glanced over at Lady Morrow.How 						is it that your own daughter is unaware of this offer, given that two days 						have passed since it was made?Do you find this sort of backdoor business 						respectable, madam?To be casting aside your daughters own happiness 						without allowing her an opportunity to vie for her own future?Lady Morrow rose from her seat, 						her lavish morning gown cascading into place around her slippered feet.How 						dare you insinuate that I seek to invest in my daughters misery?To insult 						me is to insult everything we represent.I ask that you depart at once, my 						lord, lest my footman toss you and your hat out the door.Roderick narrowed his gaze.Your footman can go to hell.Your daughter loves me, not Yardley.As such, 						you will inform Yardley that you are retracting your acceptance of his offer 						and giving her hand to me.The marchioness gasped, her face 						blanching.Leave.No, he bit out.My brother is 						unworthy of her.He barely treats me with the sort of respect I deserve.What sort of respect do you think he will bestow upon her?None.He knew I intended 						to propose to her.I told him.Gathering her gown from around 						her feet, the marchioness hastened toward the open parlor doors.Harvington?she called out, her voice panicked and trembling.Harvington, remove this man and ensure he never calls upon this house 						again.Margaret, whose tears were 						freely streaming down her anguished face, regally rose from her seat.She 						set her chin, trying to keep her features stoic.My lord.I ask that you 						leave with the dignity you arrived with.My mother knows what is best.Respect that and me.His eyes widened.You intend to 						blindly accept this slap against my honor and yours?She closed her eyes.My mother 						is all I have.Margaret  There is nothing more to be 						said or done, my lord.She reopened her eyes and stubbornly set her chin.Please.I see.He rose from his 						upholstered seat, still holding her gaze.It was obvious his Margaret wasnt 						going to fight for the love he had so stupidly thought was theirs.He 						refused to degrade himself by loving such a woman.Given your devotion to 						your mother and my brother, I formally withdraw my offer.I wish you and 						Yardley much happiness.Good day.He strode out of the parlor, trying to 						appear indifferent as the footman yanked open the entrance door.Days later, rumors had surfaced 						all across London about how unrefined and conceited he was to think he could 						have any 						woman he wanted.It was the first time in his life he had ever felt the true 						impact of being shipwrecked and deserted upon that desolate island known as 						the Second Son.His father was anything but 						pleased and rambled on and on about how stupid he was to have destroyed his 						own happiness by his lack of patience and tact.The duke insisted that he 						call on Lady Morrow with an apology and try to get her to agree to breaking 						off the agreement with Yardley.Roderick refused to degrade what little he 						was worth and told his own father to go to hell.If Margaret wasnt about to 						contest the marriage, why should he?Within days, a wedding was set 						to take place in June, though it was not his own.Lady Margaret and his 						brother formally announced their engagement before all of London.Yardley, 						whose idea of true literature was The 						Accomplished Whore, had at long last 						sought to abandon whoring to become a married man, claiming Rodericks woman for his 						own.His father, who knew Yardleys 						intentions were simply to best his brother, had repeatedly tried to talk 						Yardley out of it, but Yardley insisted no other woman would do and that it 						wasnt his 						fault Roderick hadnt been able to impress Lady Morrow.Barely a day after the 						engagement had been announced, Roderick was further stunned when Margaret 						appeared at his door late one night, cloaked from head to toe in her 						scullery maids clothing.She had even smudged her face with ash to keep 						anyone from recognizing her.She begged that he forgive her for submitting 						to her mothers wishes but that she still loved him.He told her to leave.She wouldnt.So he grabbed her by the arm to 						lead her straight back to that front door, but Margaret, damn her, grabbed 						him and 						kissed him with an unnerving passion that ended whatever rational thought 						hed placed in his head since he was four.All was lost.From that moment 						on, he only sought to listen to the beat of his own heart, no matter how 						erratic or deranged it was.Whilst they frantically and 						savagely kissed, they eventually stumbled off into his study to ensure their 						privacy and closed the doors.They kept kissing and kissing until he lost a 						cravat and she lost a bonnet.Everything was slowly fumbled off of their 						bodies one by one, until they were naked.Though they hesitated every now 						and then in the silence of his study, knowing they shouldnt, the passion 						between them was far too great, and to his disbelief and joy, Margaret 						begged that he ruin her so that they could be together.He couldnt say no.Or ratherhe wouldnt say 					no.He ardently penetrated her 						virginity with his own, branding her and himself for life.When they were 						virgins no more but well sated sinners, he cradled her softness against his 						chest and informed her that he would sell everything of worth so they could 						leave to Paris within the week.What did it matter if they no longer lived 						like kings and respectable society turned against them?All that mattered 						was seeing their love crowned.Margaret quietly eased out of 						his arms and eventually whispered, We cannot publicly shame our families by 						disappearing to Paris.It would slaughter my mothers name and all would 						turn against her, blaming her for my sins.She wouldnt survive 						this.He grabbed her and yanked her 						back into his arms.What will you have us do, then?Live here?It would be 						hell of the worst sort, no better by any means.London would spit at all 						that we represent and my father could very well disown me, given that your 						banns have already been printed and announced in church.
