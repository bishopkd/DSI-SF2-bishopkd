In any case, the one kind of silk is sticky, and if a wee bug touches it, hes done for.But the other kind is dry silk, like the sort yed embroider with, but finer.The orb weaver was advancing cautiously toward the center of her web again.See where she walks?Jamie pointed to the web, anchored by a number of spokes, supporting the intricate netlike whorl.The spokes there, those are spun of the dry silk, so the spider can walk over it herself wi no trouble.But the rest o the web is the sticky kind of silkor mostly soand if ye watch a spider careful for quite a long time, youll see that she goes only on the dry strands, for if she walked on the sticky stuff, shed be stuck herself.Is that so?Ian breathed reverently on the web, watching intently as the spider moved away along her nonskid road to safety.I suppose theres a moral there for web weavers, Jamie observed to me, sotto voce.Be sure ye know which of your strands are sticky.I suppose it helps even more if you have the kind of luck that will conjure up a handy spider when you need one, I said dryly.He laughed and took my arm.Thats not luck, Sassenach, he told me.Its watchfulness.Ian, are ye coming?Oh, aye.Young Ian abandoned the web with obvious reluctance and followed us to the kirkyard gate.Oh, Uncle Jamie, I meant to ask, can I borrow your rosary?he said, as we emerged onto the cobbles of the Royal Mile.The priest told me I must say five decades for my penance, and thats too many to keep count of on my fingers.Surely.Jamie stopped and fished in his pocket for the rosary.Be sure to give it back, though.Young Ian grinned.Aye, I reckon youll be needing it yourself, Uncle Jamie.The priest told me he was verra wicked, Young Ian confided to me, with a lashless wink, and told me not to be like him.Mmphm.Jamie glanced up and down the road, gauging the speed of an approaching handcart, edging its way down the steep incline.Freshly shaved that morning, his cheeks had a rosy glow about them.How many decades of the rosary are you supposed to say as penance?I asked curiously.Eighty five, he muttered.The rosiness of his freshly shaved cheeks deepened.Young Ians mouth dropped open in awe.How long has it been since ye went to confession, Uncle?he asked.A long time, Jamie said tersely.Come on!Jamie had an appointment after dinner to meet with a Mr.Harding, representative of the Hand in Hand Assurance Society, which had insured the premises of the printshop, to inspect the ashy remains with him and verify the loss.I willna need ye, laddie, he said reassuringly to Young Ian, who looked less than enthusiastic about the notion of revisiting the scene of his adventures.You go wi your auntie to see this madwoman.I canna tell how ye do it, he added to me, raising one brow.Youre in the city less than two days, and all the afflicted folk for miles about are clutching at your hems.Hardly all of them, I said dryly.Its only one woman, after all, and I havent even seen her yet.Aye, well.At least madness isna catchingI hope.He kissed me briefly, then turned to go, clapping Young Ian companionably on the shoulder.Look after your auntie, Ian.Young Ian paused for a moment, looking after the tall form of his departing uncle.Do you want to go with him, Ian?I asked.I can manage alone, if you  Oh, no, Auntie!He turned back to me, looking rather abashed.I dinna want to go, at all.Its onlyI was wonderingwell, what if theyfind anything?In the ashes?A body, you mean, I said bluntly.I had realized, of course, that the distinct possibility that Jamie and Mr.Harding would find the body of the one eyed seaman was the reason Jamie had told Ian to accompany me.The boy nodded, looking ill at ease.His skin had faded to a sort of rosy tan, but was still too dark to show any paleness due to emotion.I dont know, I said.If the fire was a very hot one, there may be nothing much left to find.But dont worry about it.I touched his arm in reassurance.Your uncle will know what to do.Aye, thats so.His face brightened, full of faith in his uncles ability to handle any situation whatever.I smiled when I saw his expression, then realized with a small start of surprise that I had that faith, too.Be it drunken Chinese, corrupt Customs agents, or Mr.Harding of the Hand in Hand Assurance Society, I hadnt any doubt that Jamie would manage.Come on, then, I said, as the bell in the Canongate Kirk began to ring.Its just on two now.Despite his visit to Father Hayes, Ian had retained a certain air of dreamy bliss, which returned to him now, and there was little conversation as we made our way up the slope of the Royal Mile to Hendersons lodging house, in Carrubbers Close.It was a quiet hotel, but luxurious by Edinburgh standards, with a patterned carpet on the stairs and colored glass in the street window.It seemed rather rich surroundings for a Free Church minister, but then I knew little about Free Churchmen; perhaps they took no vow of poverty as the Catholic clergy did.Showed up to the third floor by a young boy, we found the door opened to us at once by a heavyset woman wearing an apron and a worried expression.I thought she might be in her mid twenties, though she had already lost several of her front teeth.Youll be the lady as the Reverend said would call?she asked.Her expression lightened a bit at my nod, and she swung the door wider.Mr.Campbells had to go oot the noo, she said in a broad Lowland accent, but he said as how hed be most obliged to hae yer advice regardin his sister, mum.Sister, not wife.Well, Ill do my best, I said.May I see Miss Campbell?Leaving Ian to his memories in the sitting room, I accompanied the woman, who introduced herself as Nellie Cowden, to the back bedroom.Miss Campbell was, as advertised, staring.Her pale blue eyes were wide open, but didnt seem to be looking at anythingcertainly not at me.She sat in the sort of wide, low chair called a nursing chair, with her back to the fire.The room was dim, and the backlighting made her features indistinct, except for the unblinking eyes.Seen closer to, her features were still indistinct; she had a soft, round face, undistinguished by any apparent bone structure, and baby fine brown hair, neatly brushed.Her nose was small and snub, her chin double, and her mouth hung pinkly open, so slack as to obscure its natural lines.Miss Campbell?I said cautiously.There was no response from the plump figure in the chair.Her eyes did blink, I saw, though much less frequently than normal.Shell nae answer ye, whilst shes in this state, Nellie Cowden said behind me.She shook her head, wiping her hands upon her apron.Nay, not a word.How long has she been like this?I picked up a limp, pudgy hand and felt for the pulse.It was there, slow and quite strong.Oh, for twa days so far, this time.Becoming interested, Miss Cowden leaned forward, peering into her charges face.Usually she stays like that for a week or morethirteen days is the longest shes done it.Moving slowlythough Miss Campbell seemed unlikely to be alarmedI began to examine the unresisting figure, meanwhile asking questions of her attendant.Miss Margaret Campbell was thirty seven, Miss Cowden told me, the only relative of the Reverend Archibald Campbell, with whom she had lived for the past twenty years, since the death of their parents.What starts her doing this?Do you know?Miss Cowden shook her head.No tellin, Mum.Nothin seems to start it.One minute shell be lookin aboot, talkin and laughin, eatin her dinner like the sweet child she is, and the nextwheesht!She snapped her fingers, then, for effect, leaned forward and snapped them again, deliberately, just under Miss Campbells nose.See?she said.I could hae six men wi trumpets pass through the room, and shed pay it nay more mind.I was reasonably sure that Miss Campbells trouble was mental, not physical, but I made a complete examination, anywayor as complete as could be managed without undressing that clumsy, inert form.Its when she comes oot of it thats the worst, though, Miss Cowden assured me, squatting next to me as I knelt on the floor to check Miss Campbells plantar reflexes.Her feet, loosed from shoes and stockings, were damp and smelled musty.I drew a fingernail firmly down the sole of each foot in turn, checking for a Babinski reflex that might indicate the presence of a brain lesion.Nothing, though; her toes curled under, in normal startlement.What happens then?Is that the screaming the Reverend mentioned?I rose to my feet.Will you bring me a lighted candle, please?Oh, aye, the screamin.Miss Cowden hastened to oblige, lighting a wax taper from the fire.She do shriek somethin awful then, on and on til shes worn herself oot.Then shell fall asleepsleep the clock around, she willand wake as though nothin had happened.And shes quite all right when she wakes?I asked.I moved the candle flame slowly back and forth, a few inches before the patients eyes.The pupils shrank in automatic response to the light, but the irises stayed fixed, not following the flame.My hand itched for the solid handle of an ophthalmoscope, to examine the retinas, but no such luck.Well, not to say all right, Miss Cowden said slowly.I turned from the patient to look at her and she shrugged, massive shoulders powerful under the linen of her blouse.Shes saft in the heid, puir dear, she said, matter of factly.Has been for nigh on twenty year.You havent been taking care of her all that time, surely?Oh, no!Mr.Campbell had a woman as cared for her where they lived, in Burntisland, but the woman was none so young, and didna wish to leave her home.So when the Reverend made up his mind to take up the Missionary Societys offer, and to take his sister wi him to the West Indieswhy, he advertised for a strong woman o good character who wouldna mind travel to be an abigail for herand here I am.Miss Cowden gave me a gap toothed smile in testimony to her own virtues.The West Indies?Hes planning to take Miss Campbell on a ship to the West Indies?I was staggered; I knew just enough of sailing conditions to think that any such trip would be a major ordeal to a woman in good health.This womanbut then I reconsidered.All things concerned, Margaret Campbell might endure such a trip better than a normal womanat least if she remained in her trance.He thought as the change of climate might be good for her, Miss Cowden was explaining.Get her away from Scotland, and all the dreadful memories.Ought to ha done it long since, is what I say.What sort of dreadful memories?I asked.I could see by the gleam in Miss Cowdens eye that she was only too ready to tell me.I had finished the examination by this time, and concluded that there was little physically wrong with Miss Campbell save inactivity and poor diet, but there was the chance that something in her history might suggest some treatment.Weel, she began, sidling toward the table, where a decanter and several glasses stood on a tray, its only what Tilly Lawson told me, her as looked after Miss Campbell for sae long, but she did swear it was the truth, and her a godly woman.If yed care to take a drop of cordial, mum, for the sake o the Reverends hospitality?The chair Miss Campbell sat on was the only one in the room, so Miss Cowden and I perched inelegantly on the bed, side by side, and watched the silent figure before us, as we sipped our blackberry cordial, and she told me Margaret Campbells story.Margaret Campbell had been born in Burntisland, no more than five miles from Edinburgh, across the Firth of Forth.At the time of the 45, when Charles Stuart had marched into Edinburgh to reclaim his fathers throne, she had been seventeen.Her father was a Royalist, o course, and her brother in a government regiment, marching north to put down the wicked rebels, said Miss Cowden, taking a tiny sip of the cordial to make it last.But not Miss Margaret.Nay, she was for the Bonnie Prince, and the Hielan men that followed him.One, in particular, though Miss Cowden did not know his name.But a fine man he must have been, for Miss Margaret stole away from her home to meet him, and told him all the bits of information that she gleaned from listening to her father and his friends, and from her brothers letters home.But then had come Falkirk; a victory, but a costly one, followed by retreat.Rumor had attended the flight of the Princes army to the north, and not a soul doubted but that their flight led to destruction.Miss Margaret, desperate at the rumors, left her home at dead of night in the cold March spring, and went to find the man she loved.Now here the account had been uncertainwhether it was that she had found the man and he had spurned her, or that she had not found him in time, and been forced to turn back from Culloden Moorbut in any case, turn back she did, and the day after the battle, she had fallen into the hands of a band of English soldiers.Dreadful, what they did to her, Miss Cowden said, lowering her voice as though the figure in the chair could hear.Dreadful!The English soldiers, blind with the lust of the hunt and the kill, pursuing the fugitives of Culloden, had not stopped to ask her name or the sympathies of her family.They had known by her speech that she was a Scot, and that knowledge had been enough.They had left her for dead in a ditch half full of freezing water, and only the fortuitous presence of a family of tinkers, hiding in the nearby brambles for fear of the soldiers, had saved her.I canna help but think it a pity they did save her, un Christian thing it is to say, Miss Cowden whispered.If not, the puir lamb might ha slippit her earthly bonds and gone happy to God.But as it is She gestured clumsily at the silent figure, and drank down the last drops of her cordial.Margaret had lived, but did not speak.Somewhat recovered, but silent, she traveled with the tinkers, moving south with them to avoid the pillaging of the Highlands that took place in the wake of Culloden.And then one day, sitting in the yard of a pothouse, holding the tin to collect coppers as the tinkers busked and sang, she had been found by her brother, who had stopped with his Campbell regiment to refresh themselves on the way back to their quarters at Edinburgh.She kent him, and him her, and the shock o their meeting gave her back her voice, but not her mind, puir thing.He took her home, o course, but she was always as though she was in the pastsometime before she met the Hielan man.Her father was dead then, from the influenza, and Tilly Lawson said as the shock o seeing her like that kilt her mother, but could be as that were the influenza, too, for there was a great deal of it about that year.The whole affair had left Archibald Campbell deeply embittered against both Highland Scots and the English army, and he had resigned his commission.With his parents dead, he found himself middling well to do, but the sole support of his damaged sister.He couldna marry, Miss Cowden explained, for what woman would have him, and shewith a nod toward the firewas thrown into the bargain?In his difficulties, he had turned to God, and become a minister.Unable to leave his sister, or to bear the confinement of the family house at Burntisland with her, he had purchased a coach, hired a woman to look after Margaret, and begun to make brief journeys into the surrounding countryside to preach, often taking her with him.In his preaching he had found success, and this year had been asked by the Society of Presbyterian Missionaries if he would undertake his longest journey yet, to the West Indies, there to organize churches and appoint elders on the colonies of Barbados and Jamaica.Prayer had given him his answer, and he had sold the family property in Burntisland and moved his sister to Edinburgh while he made preparations for the journey.I glanced once more at the figure by the fire.The heated air from the hearth stirred the skirts about her feet, but beyond that small movement, she might have been a statue.Well, I said with a sigh, theres not a great deal I can do for her, Im afraid.But Ill give you some prescriptionsreceipts, I meanto have made up at the apothecarys before you go.If they didnt help, they couldnt hurt, I reflected, as I copied down the short lists of ingredients.Chamomile, hops, rue, tansy, and verbena, with a strong pinch of peppermint, for a soothing tonic.Tea of rose hips, to help correct the slight nutritional deficiency I had notedspongy, bleeding gums, and a pale, bloated look about the face.Once you reach the Indies, I said, handing Miss Cowden the paper, you must see that she eats a great deal of fruitoranges, grapefruit, and lemons, particularly.You should do the same, I added, causing a look of profound suspicion to flit across the maids wide face.I doubted she ate any vegetable matter beyond the occasional onion or potato, save her daily parritch.The Reverend Campbell had not returned, and I saw no real reason to wait for him.Bidding Miss Campbell adieu, I pulled open the door of the bedroom, to find Young Ian standing on the other side of it.Oh!he said, startled.I was just comin to find ye, Auntie.Its nearly half past three, and Uncle Jamie said  Jamie?The voice came from behind me, from the chair beside the fire.Miss Cowden and I whirled to find Miss Campbell sitting bolt upright, eyes still wide but focused now.They were focused on the doorway, and as Young Ian stepped inside, Miss Campbell began to scream.Rather unsettled by the encounter with Miss Campbell, Young Ian and I made our way thankfully back to the refuge of the brothel, where we were greeted matter of factly by Bruno and taken to the rear parlor.There we found Jamie and Fergus deep in conversation.True, we do not trust Sir Percival, Fergus was saying, but in this case, what point is there to his telling you of an ambush, save that such an ambush is in fact to occur?Damned if I ken why, Jamie said frankly, leaning back and stretching in his chair.And that being so, we do, as ye say, conclude that theres meant to be an ambush by the excisemen.Two days, he said.That would be Mullens Cove.Then, catching sight of me and Ian, he half rose, motioning us to take seats.Will it be the rocks below Balcarres, then?Fergus asked.Jamie frowned in thought, the two stiff fingers of his right hand drumming slowly on the tabletop.No, he said at last.Let it be Arbroath; the wee cove under the abbey there.Just to be sure, aye?All right.Fergus pushed back the half empty plate of oatcakes from which he had been refreshing himself, and rose.I shall spread the word, milord.Arbroath, in four days.With a nod to me, he swirled his cloak about his shoulders and went out.Is it the smuggling, Uncle?Young Ian asked eagerly.Is there a French lugger coming?He picked up an oatcake and bit into it, scattering crumbs over the table.Jamies eyes were still abstracted, thinking, but they cleared as he glanced sharply at his nephew.Aye, it is.And you, Young Ian, are having nothing to do with it.But I could help!the boy protested.Youll need someone to hold the mules, at least!After all your Da said to you and me yesterday, wee Ian?Jamie raised his brows.Christ, yeve a short memory, lad!Ian looked mildly abashed at this, and took another oatcake to cover his confusion.Seeing him momentarily silent, I took the opportunity to ask my own questions.Youre going to Arbroath to meet a French ship thats bringing in smuggled liquor?I asked.You dont think thats dangerous, after Sir Percivals warning?Jamie glanced at me with one brow still raised, but answered patiently enough.No; Sir Percival was warning me that the rendezvous in two days time is known.That was to take place at Mullens Cove.Ive an arrangement wi Jared and his captains, though.If a rendezvous canna be kept for some reason, the lugger will stand offshore and come in again the next nightbut to a different place.And theres a third fallback as well, should the second meeting not come off.But if Sir Percival knows the first rendezvous, wont he know the others, too?I persisted.Jamie shook his head and poured out a cup of wine.He quirked a brow at me to ask whether I wanted any, and upon my shaking my head, sipped it himself.No, he said.The rendezvous points are arranged in sets of three, between me and Jared, sent by sealed letter inside a packet addressed to Jeanne, here.Once Ive read the letter, I burn it.The men wholl help meet the lugger will all know the first point, of courseI suppose one o them will have let something slip, he added, frowning into his cup.But no onenot even Ferguskens the other two points unless we need to make use of one.And when we do, all the men ken well enough to guard their tongues.But then its bound to be safe, Uncle!Young Ian burst out.Please let me come!Ill keep well back out o the way, he promised.Jamie gave his nephew a slightly jaundiced look.Aye, ye will, he said.Youll come wi me to Arbroath, but you and your auntie will stay at the inn on the road above the abbey until weve finished.Ive got to take the laddie home to Lallybroch, Claire, he explained, turning to me.And mend things as best I can with his parents.The elder Ian had left Hallidays that morning before Jamie and Young Ian arrived, leaving no message, but presumably bound for home.Ye willna mind the journey?I wouldna ask it, and you just over your travel from Invernesshis eyes met mine with a small, conspiratorial smilebut I must take him back as soon as may be.I dont mind at all, I assured him.It will be good to see Jenny and the rest of your family again.But Uncle Young Ian blurted.What about  Be still!Jamie snapped.That will be all from you, laddie.Not another word, aye?Young Ian looked wounded, but took another oatcake and inserted it into his mouth in a marked manner, signifying his intention to remain completely silent.Jamie relaxed then, and smiled at me.Well, and how was your visit to the madwoman?Very interesting, I said.Jamie, do you know any people named Campbell?Not above three or four hundred of them, he said, a smile twitching his long mouth.Had ye a particular Campbell in mind?A couple of them.I told him the story of Archibald Campbell and his sister, Margaret, as related to me by Nellie Cowden.He shook his head at the tale, and sighed.For the first time, he looked truly older, his face tightened and lined by memory.Its no the worst tale Ive heard, of the things that happened after Culloden, he said.But I dinna thinkwait.He stopped, and looked at me, eyes narrowed in thought.Margaret Campbell.Margaret.Would she be a bonny wee lassperhaps the size o the second Mary?And wi soft brown hair like a wrens feather, and a verra sweet face?She probably was, twenty years ago, I said, thinking of that still, plump figure sitting by the fire.Why, do you know her after all?Aye, I think I do.His brow was furrowed in thought, and he looked down at the table, drawing a random line through the spilled crumbs.Aye, if Im right, she was Ewan Camerons sweetheart.Youll mind Ewan?Of course.Ewan had been a tall, handsome joker of a man, who had worked with Jamie at Holyrood, gathering bits of intelligence that filtered through from England.Whats become of Ewan?Or should I not ask?I said, seeing the shadow come over Jamies face.The English shot him, he said quietly.Two days after Culloden.He closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them and smiled tiredly at me.Well, then, may God bless the Reverend Archie Campbell.Id heard of him, a time or two, during the Rising.He was a bold soldier, folk said, and a brave oneand I suppose hell need to be now, poor man.He sat a moment longer, then stood up with decision.Aye, well, theres a great deal to be done before we leave Edinburgh.Ian, youll find the list of the printshop customers upstairs on the table; fetch it down to me and Ill mark off for ye the ones with orders outstanding.Ye must go to see each one and offer back their money.Unless they choose to wait until Ive found new premises and laid in new stockthat might take as much as two months, though, tell them.He patted his coat, where something made a small jingling sound.Luckily the assurance money will pay back the customers, and have a bit left over.Speaking of whichhe turned and smiled at meyour job, Sassenach, is to find a dressmaker who will manage ye a decent gown in two days time.For I expect Daphne would like her dress back, and I canna take ye home to Lallybroch naked.30  RENDEZVOUS  The chief entertainment of the ride north to Arbroath was watching the conflict of wills between Jamie and Young Ian.I knew from long experience that stubbornness was one of the major components of a Frasers character.Ian seemed not unduly handicapped in that respect, though only half a Fraser; either the Murrays were no slouches with regard to stubbornness, or the Fraser genes were strong ones.Having had the opportunity to observe Brianna at close range for many years, I had my own opinion about that, but kept quiet, merely enjoying the spectacle of Jamie having for once met his match.By the time we passed Balfour, he was wearing a distinctly hunted look.This contest between immovable object and irresistible force continued until early evening of the fourth day, when we reached Arbroath to find that the inn where Jamie had intended to leave Ian and myself no longer existed.No more than a tumbled down stone wall and one or two charred roof beams remained to mark the spot; otherwise, the road was deserted for miles in either direction.Jamie looked at the heap of stones in silence for some time.It was reasonably obvious that he could not just leave us in the middle of a desolate, muddy road.Ian, wise enough not to press the advantage, kept also silent, though his skinny frame fairly vibrated with eagerness.All right, then, Jamie said at last, resigned.Yell come.But only so far as the cliffs edge, Iandye hear?Youll take care of your auntie.I hear, Uncle Jamie, Young Ian replied, with deceptive meekness.I caught Jamies wry glance, though, and understood that if Ian was to take care of auntie, auntie was also to take care of Ian.I hid a smile, nodding obediently.The rest of the men were timely, arriving at the rendezvous point on the cliffside just after dark.A couple of the men seemed vaguely familiar, but most were just muffled shapes; it was two days past the dark of the moon, but the tiny sliver rising over the horizon made conditions here little more illuminating than those obtaining in the brothels cellars.No introductions were made, the men greeting Jamie with unintelligible mutters and grunts.There was one unmistakable figure, though.A large mule drawn wagon appeared, rattling its way down the road, driven by Fergus and a diminutive object that could only be Mr.Willoughby, whom I had not seen since he had shot the mysterious man on the stairs of the brothel.He hasnt a pistol with him tonight, I hope, I murmured to Jamie.Who?he said, squinting into the gathering gloom.Oh, the Chinee?No, none of them have.Before I could ask why not, he had gone forward, to help back the wagon around, ready to make a getaway toward Edinburgh, so soon as the contraband should be loaded.Young Ian pressed his way forward, and I, mindful of my job as custodian, followed him.Mr.Willoughby stood on tiptoe to reach into the back of the wagon, emerging with an odd looking lantern, fitted with a pierced metal top and sliding metal sides.Is that a dark lantern?I asked, fascinated.Aye, it is, said Young Ian, importantly.Ye keep the slides shut until we see the signal out at sea.He reached for the lantern.Here, give it me; Ill take itI ken the signal.Mr.Willoughby merely shook his head, pulling the lantern out of Young Ians grasp.Too tall, too young, he said.Tsei mi say so, he added, as though that settled the matter once and for all.What?Young Ian was indignant.What dye mean too tall and too young, ye wee  He means, said a level voice behind us, that whoevers holding the lantern is a bonny target, should we have visitors.Mr.Willoughby kindly takes the risk of it, because hes the smallest man among us.Youre tall enough to see against the sky, wee Ian, and young enough to have nay sense yet.Stay out o the way, aye?Jamie gave his nephew a light cuff over the ear, and passed by to kneel on the rocks by Mr.Willoughby.He said something low voiced in Chinese, and there was the ghost of a laugh from the Chinaman.Mr.Willoughby opened the side of the lantern, holding it conveniently to Jamies cupped hands.A sharp click, repeated twice, and I caught the flicker of sparks struck from a flint.It was a wild piece of coastnot surprising, most of Scotlands coast was wild and rockyand I wondered how and where the French ship would anchor.There was no natural bay, only a curving of the coastline behind a jutting cliff that sheltered this spot from observation from the road.Dark as it was, I could see the white lines of the surf purling in across the small half moon beach.No smooth tourist beach thissmall pockets of sand lay ruffled and churned between heaps of seaweed and pebbles and juts of rock.Not an easy footing for men carrying casks, but convenient to the crevices in the surrounding rocks, where the casks could be hidden.Another black figure loomed up suddenly beside me.Everyones settled, sir, it said softly.Up in the rocks.Good, Joey.A sudden flare lit Jamies profile, intent on the newly caught wick.He held his breath as the flame steadied and grew, taking up oil from the lanterns reservoir, then let it out with a sigh as he gently closed the metal slide.Fine, then, he said, standing up.He glanced up at the cliff to the south, observing the stars over it, and said, Nearly nine oclock.Theyll be in soon.Mind ye, Joeyno ones to move til I call out, aye?Aye, sir.The casual tone of the answer made it apparent that this was a customary exchange, and Joey was plainly surprised when Jamie gripped his arm.Be sure of it, Jamie said.Tell them all againno one moves til I give the word.Aye, sir, Joey said again, but this time with more respect.He faded back into the night, making no sound on the rocks.Is something wrong?I asked, pitching my voice barely loud enough to be heard over the breakers.Though the beach and cliffs were evidently deserted, the dark setting and the secretive conduct of my companions compelled caution.Jamie shook his head briefly; hed been right about Young Ian, I thoughthis own dark silhouette was clear against the paler black of the sky behind him.I dinna ken.He hesitated for a moment, then said, Tell me, Sassenachdye smell anything?Surprised, I obligingly took a deep sniff, held it for a moment, and let it out.I smelled any number of things, including rotted seaweed, the thick smell of burning oil from the dark lantern, and the pungent body odor of Young Ian, standing close beside me, sweating with a mix of excitement and fear.Nothing odd, I dont think, I said.Do you?The silhouettes shoulders rose and dropped in a shrug.Not now.A moment ago, I could ha sworn I smelt gunpowder.I dinna smell anything, Young Ian said.His voice broke from excitement, and he hastily cleared his throat, embarrassed.Willie MacLeod and Alec Hays searched the rocks.They didna find any sign of excisemen.Aye, well.Jamies voice sounded uneasy.He turned to Young Ian, grasping him by the shoulder.Ian, youre to take charge of your auntie, now.The two of ye get back of the gorse bushes there.Keep well away from the wagon.If anything should happen  The beginnings of Young Ians protest were cut off, apparently by a tightening of Jamies hand, for the boy jerked back with a small grunt, rubbing his shoulder.If anything should happen, Jamie continued, with emphasis, youre to take your auntie and go straight home to Lallybroch.Dinna linger.But I said.Uncle!Young Ian said.Do it, said Jamie, in tones of steel, and turned aside, the discussion concluded.Young Ian was grim on the trip up the cliff trail, but did as he was told, dutifully escorting me some distance past the gorse bushes and finding a small promontory where we might see out some way over the water.We can see from here, he whispered unnecessarily.We could indeed.The rocks fell away in a shallow bowl beneath us, a broken cup filled with darkness, the light of the water spilling from the broken edge where the sea hissed in.Once I caught a tiny movement, as a metal buckle caught the faint light, but for the most part, the ten men below were completely invisible.I squinted, trying to pick out the location of Mr.Willoughby with his lantern, but saw no sign of light, and concluded that he must be standing behind the lantern, shielding it from sight from the cliff.Young Ian stiffened suddenly next to me.Someones coming!he whispered.Quick, get behind me!Stepping courageously out in front of me, he plunged a hand under his shirt, into the band of his breeches, and withdrew a pistol; dark as it was, I could see the faint gleam of starlight along the barrel.He braced himself, peering into the dark, slightly hunched over the gun with both hands clamped on the weapon.Dont shoot, for Gods sake!I hissed in his ear.I didnt dare grab his arm for fear of setting off the pistol, but was terrified lest he make any noise that might attract attention to the men below.Id be obliged if yed heed your auntie, Ian, came Jamies soft, ironic tones from the blackness below the cliff edge.Id as soon not have ye blow my head off, aye?Ian lowered the pistol, shoulders slumping with what might have been a sigh either of relief or disappointment.The gorse bushes quivered, and then Jamie was before us, brushing gorse prickles from the sleeve of his coat.Did no one tell ye not to come armed?Jamies voice was mild, with no more than a note of academic interest.Its a hanging offense to draw a weapon against an officer of the Kings Customs, he explained, turning to me.None o the men are armed, even wi so much as a fish knife, in case theyre taken.Aye, well, Fergus said they wouldna hang me, because my beards not grown yet, Ian said awkwardly.Id only be transported, he said.There was a soft hiss as Jamie drew in his breath through his teeth in exasperation.Oh, aye, and Im sure your mother will be verra pleased to hear yeve been shipped off to the Colonies, even if Fergus was right!He put out his hand.Give me that, fool.Where did ye get it, anyway?he asked, turning the pistol over in his hand.Already primed, too.I knew I smelt gunpowder.Lucky ye didna blow your cock off, carrying it in your breeches.Before Young Ian could answer, I interrupted, pointing out to sea.Look!The French ship was little more than a blot on the face of the sea, but its sails shone pale in the glimmer of starlight.A two masted ketch, it glided slowly past the cliff and stood off, silent as one of the scattered clouds behind it.Jamie was not watching the ship, but looking downward, toward a point where the rock face broke in a tumble of boulders, just above the sand.Looking where he was looking, I could just make out a tiny prickle of light.Mr.Willoughby, with the lantern.There was a brief flash of light that glistened across the wet rocks and was gone.Young Ians hand was tense on my arm.We waited, breaths held, to the count of thirty.Ians hand squeezed my arm, just as another flash lit the foam on the sand.What was that?I said.What?Jamie wasnt looking at me, but out at the ship.On the shore; when the light flashed, I thought I saw something half buried in the sand.It looked like  The third flash came, and a moment later, an answering light shone from the shipa blue lantern, an eerie dot that hung from the mast, doubling itself in reflection in the dark water below.I forgot the glimpse of what appeared to be a rumpled heap of clothing, carelessly buried in the sand, in the excitement of watching the ship.Some movement was evident now, and a faint splash reached our ears as something was thrown over the side.The tides coming in, Jamie muttered in my ear.The ankers float; the current will carry them ashore in a few minutes.That solved the problem of the ships anchorageit didnt need one.But how then was the payment made?I was about to ask when there was a sudden shout, and all hell broke loose below.Jamie thrust his way at once through the gorse bushes, followed in short order by me and Young Ian.Little could be seen distinctly, but there was a considerable turmoil taking place on the sandy beach.Dark shapes were stumbling and rolling over the sand, to the accompaniment of shouting.I caught the words Halt, in the Kings name!and my blood froze.Excisemen!Young Ian had caught it, too.Jamie said something crude in Gaelic, then threw back his head and shouted himself, his voice carrying easily across the beach below.irich illean!he bellowed.Suas am bearrach is teich!Then he turned to Young Ian and me.Go!he said.The noise suddenly increased as the clatter of falling rocks joined the shouting.Suddenly a dark figure shot out of the gorse by my feet and made off through the dark at high speed.Another followed, a few feet away.A high pitched scream came from the dark below, high enough to be heard over the other noises.Thats Willoughby!Young Ian exclaimed.Theyve got him!Ignoring Jamies order to go, we both crowded forward to peer through the screen of gorse.The dark lantern had fallen atilt and the slide had come open, shooting a beam of light like a spotlight over the beach, where the shallow graves in which the Customs men had buried themselves gaped in the sand.Black figures swayed and struggled and shouted through the wet heaps of seaweed.A dim glow of light around the lantern was sufficient to show two figures clasped together, the smaller kicking wildly as it was lifted off its feet.Ill get him!Young Ian sprang forward, only to be pulled up with a jerk as Jamie caught him by the collar.Do as youre told and see my wife safe!Gasping for breath, Young Ian turned to me, but I wasnt going anywhere, and set my feet firmly in the dirt, resisting his tug on my arm.Ignoring us both, Jamie turned and ran along the clifftop, stopping several yards away.I could see him clearly in silhouette against the sky, as he dropped to one knee and readied the pistol, bracing it on his forearm to sight downward.The sound of the shot was no more than a small cracking noise, lost amid the tumult.The result of it, though, was spectacular.The lantern exploded in a shower of burning oil, abruptly darkening the beach and silencing the shouting.The silence was broken within seconds by a howl of mingled pain and indignation.My eyes, momentarily blinded by the flash of the lantern, adapted quickly, and I saw another glowthe light of several small flames, which seemed to be moving erratically up and down.As my night vision cleared, I saw that the flames rose from the coat sleeve of a man, who was dancing up and down as he howled, beating ineffectually at the fire started by the burning oil that had splashed him.The gorse bushes quivered violently as Jamie plunged over the cliffside and was lost to view below.Jamie!Roused by my cry, Young Ian yanked harder, pulling me half off my feet and forcibly dragging me away from the cliff.Come on, Auntie!Theyll be up here, next thing!This was undeniably true; I could hear the shouts on the beach coming closer, as the men swarmed up the rocks.I picked up my skirts and went, following the boy as fast as we could go through the rough marrow grass of the clifftop.I didnt know where we were going, but Young Ian seemed to.He had taken off his coat and the white of his shirt was easily visible before me, floating like a ghost through the thickets of alder and birch that grew farther inland.Where are we?I panted, coming up alongside him when he slowed at the bank of a tiny stream.The road to Arbroaths just ahead, he said.He was breathing heavily, and a dark smudge of mud showed down the side of his shirt.Itll be easier going in a moment.Are ye all right, Auntie?Shall I carry ye across?I politely declined this gallant offer, privately noting that I undoubtedly weighed as much as he did.I took off my shoes and stockings, and splashed my way knee deep across the streamlet, feeling icy mud well up between my toes.I was shivering violently when I emerged, and did accept Ians offer of his coatexcited as he was, and heated by the exercise, he was clearly in no need of it.I was chilled not only by the water and the cold November wind, but by fear of what might be happening behind us.We emerged panting onto the road, the wind blowing cold in our faces.My nose and lips were numb in no time, and my hair blew loose behind me, heavy on my neck.Its an ill wind that blows nobody good, though; it carried the sound of voices to us, moments before we would have walked into them.Any signal from the cliff?a deep male voice asked.Ian stopped so abruptly in his tracks that I bumped into him.Not yet, came the reply.I thought I heard a bit of shouting that way, but then the wind turned.Well, get up that tree again then, heavy arse, the first voice said impatiently.If any o the whoresons get past the beach, well nibble em here.Better us get the headmoney than the buggers on the beach.Its cold, grumbled the second voice.Out in the open where the wind gnaws your bones.Wish wed drawn the watch at the abbeyat least it would be warm there.Young Ians hand was clutching my upper arm tight enough to leave bruises.I pulled, trying to loosen his grip, but he paid no attention.Aye, but less chance o catching the big fish, the first voice said.Ah, and what I might do with fifty pound!Awright, said the second voice, resigned.Though how were to see red hair in the dark, Ive no notion.Just lay em by the heels, Oakie; well look at their heads later.Young Ian was finally roused from his trance by my tugging, and stumbled after me off the road and into the bushes.What do they mean by the watch at the abbey?I demanded, as soon as I thought we were out of earshot of the watchers on the road.Do you know?Young Ians dark thatch bobbed up and down.I think so, Auntie.It must be Arbroath abbey.Thats the meeting point, aye?Meeting point?If something should go wrong, he explained.Then its every man for himself, all to meet at the abbey as soon as they can.Well, it couldnt go more wrong, I observed.What was it your uncle shouted when the Customs men popped up?Young Ian had half turned to listen for pursuit from the road;now the pale oval of his face turned back to me.Ohhe said, Up, lads!Over the cliff and run!Sound advice, I said dryly.So if they followed it, most of the men may have gotten away.Except Uncle Jamie and Mr.Willoughby.Young Ian was running one hand nervously through his hair; it reminded me forcibly of Jamie, and I wished he would stop.Yes.I took a deep breath.Well, theres nothing we can do about them just now.The other men, thoughif theyre headed for the abbey  Aye, he broke in, thats what I was tryin to decide; ought I do as Uncle Jamie said, and take ye to Lallybroch, or had I best try to get to the abbey quick and warn the others as they come?Get to the abbey, I said, as fast as you can.Well, butI shouldna like to leave ye out here by yourself, Auntie, and Uncle Jamie said  Theres a time to follow orders, Young Ian, and a time to think for yourself, I said firmly, tactfully ignoring the fact that I was in fact doing the thinking for him.Does this road lead to the abbey?Aye, it does.No more than a mile and a quarter.Already he was shifting to and fro on the balls of his feet, eager to be gone.Good.You cut round the road and head for the abbey.Ill walk straight along the road, and see if I can distract the excisemen until youre safely past.Ill meet you at the abbey.Oh, waityoud best take your coat.I surrendered the coat reluctantly; besides being loath to part with its warmth, it felt like giving up my last link with a friendly human presence.Once Young Ian was away, I would be completely alone in the cold dark of the Scottish night.Ian?I held his arm, to keep him a moment longer.Aye?Be careful, wont you?On impulse, I stood on tiptoe and kissed his cold cheek.I was near enough to see his brows arch in surprise.He smiled, and then he was gone, an alder branch snapping back into place behind him.It was very cold.The only sounds were the whish of the wind through the bushes and the distant murmur of the surf.I pulled the woolen shawl tightly round my shoulders, shivering, and headed back toward the road.Ought I to make a noise?I wondered.If not, I might be attacked without warning, since the waiting men might hear my footsteps but couldnt see that I wasnt an escaping smuggler.On the other hand, if I strolled through singing a jaunty tune to indicate that I was a harmless woman, they might just lie hidden in silence, not wanting to give away their presenceand giving away their presence was exactly what I had in mind.I bent and picked up a rock from the side of the road.Then, feeling even colder than before, I stepped out onto the road and walked straight on, without a word.31  SMUGGLERS MOON  The wind was high enough to keep the trees and bushes in a constant stir, masking the sound of my footsteps on the roadand those of anyone who might be stalking me, too.Less than a fortnight past the feast of Samhain, it was the sort of wild night that made one easily believe that spirits and evil might well be abroad.It wasnt a spirit that grabbed me suddenly from behind, hand clamped tight across my mouth.Had I not been prepared for just such an eventuality, I would have been startled senseless.As it was, my heart gave a great leap and I jerked convulsively in my captors grasp.He had grabbed me from the left, pinning my left arm tight against my side, his right hand over my mouth.My right arm was free, though.I drove the heel of my shoe into his kneecap, buckling his leg, and then, taking advantage of his momentary stagger, leaned forward and smashed backward at his head with the rock in my hand.It was of necessity a glancing blow, but it struck hard enough that he grunted with surprise, and his grip loosened.I kicked and squirmed, and as his hand slipped across my mouth, I got my teeth onto a finger and bit down as hard as I could.The maxillary muscles run from the sagittal crest at the top of the skull to an insertion on the mandible, I thought, dimly recalling the description from Greys Anatomy.This gives the jaw and teeth considerable crushing power; in fact, the average human jaw is capable of exerting over three hundred pounds of force.I didnt know whether I was bettering the average, but I was undeniably having an effect.My assailant was thrashing frantically to and fro in a futile effort to dislodge the death grip I had on his finger.His hold on my arm had loosened in the struggle, and he was forced to lower me.As soon as my feet touched the dirt once more, I let go of his hand, whirled about, and gave him as hearty a root in the stones with my knee as I could manage, given my skirts.Kicking men in the testicles is vastly overrated as a means of defense.That is to say, it does workand spectacularly wellbut its a more difficult maneuver to carry out than one might think, particularly when one is wearing heavy skirts.Men are extremely careful of those particular appendages, and thoroughly wary of any attempt on them.In this case, though, my attacker was off guard, his legs wide apart to keep his balance, and I caught him fairly.He made a hideous wheezing noise like a strangled rabbit and doubled up in the roadway.Is that you, Sassenach?The words were hissed out of the darkness to my left.I leaped like a startled gazelle, and uttered an involuntary scream.For the second time within as many minutes, a hand clapped itself over my mouth.For Gods sake, Sassenach!Jamie muttered in my ear.Its me.I didnt bite him, though I was strongly tempted to.I know, I said, through my teeth, when he released me.Whos the other fellow that grabbed me, though?Fergus, I expect.The amorphous dark shape moved away a few feet and seemed to be prodding another shape that lay on the road, moaning faintly.Is it you, Fergus?he whispered.Receiving a sort of choked noise in response, he bent and hauled the second shape to its feet.Dont talk!I urged them in a whisper.There are excisemen just ahead!Is that so?said Jamie, in a normal voice.Theyre no verra curious about the noise were making, are they?He paused, as though waiting for an answer, but no sound came but the low keening of the wind through the alders.He laid a hand on my arm and shouted into the night.MacLeod!Raeburn!Aye, Roy, said a mildly testy voice in the shrubbery.Were here.Innes, too, and Meldrum, is it?Aye, its me.Shuffling and talking in low voices, more shapes emerged from the bushes and trees.four, five, six, Jamie counted.Where are Hays and the Gordons?I saw Hays go intae the water, one of the shapes volunteered.Hell ha gone awa round the point.Likely the Gordons and Kennedy did, too.I didna hear anything as though theyd been taken.Well enough, Jamie said.Now, then, Sassenach.Whats this about excisemen?Given the nonappearance of Oakie and his companion, I was beginning to feel rather foolish, but I recounted what Ian and I had heard.Aye?Jamie sounded interested.Can ye stand yet, Fergus?Ye can?Good lad.Well, then, perhaps well have a look.Meldrum, have ye a flint about ye?A few moments later, a small torch struggling to stay alight in his hand, he strode down the road, and around the bend.The smugglers and I waited in tense silence, ready either to run or to rush to his assistance, but there were no noises of ambush.After what seemed like an eternity, Jamies voice floated back along the road.Come along, then, he said, sounding calm and collected.He was standing in the middle of the road, near a large alder.The torchlight fell round him in a flickering circle, and at first I saw nothing but Jamie.Then there was a gasp from the man beside me, and a choked sound of horror from another.Another face appeared, dimly lit, hanging in the air just behind Jamies left shoulder.A horrible, congested face, black in the torchlight that robbed everything of color, with bulging eyes and tongue protruding.The hair, fair as dry straw, rose stirring in the wind.I felt a fresh scream rise in my throat, and choked it off.Ye were right, Sassenach, Jamie said.There was an exciseman.He tossed something to the ground, where it landed with a small plop!A warrant, he said, nodding toward the object.His name was Thomas Oakie.Will any of ye ken him?Not like he is now, a voice muttered behind me.Christ, his mither wouldna ken him!There was a general mutter of negation, with a nervous shuffling of feet.Clearly, everyone was as anxious to get away from the place as I was.All right, then.Jamie stopped the retreat with a jerk of his head.The cargos lost, so therell be no shares, aye?Will anyone need money for the present?He reached for his pocket.I can provide enough to live on for a bitfor I doubt well be workin the coast for a time.One or two of the men reluctantly advanced within clear sight of the thing hanging from the tree to receive their money, but the rest of the smugglers melted quietly away into the night.Within a few minutes, only Fergusstill white, but standing on his ownJamie, and I were left.Jesu!Fergus whispered, looking up at the hanged man.Who will have done it?I didor so I expect the tale will be told, aye?Jamie gazed upward, his face harsh in the sputtering torchlight.Well no tarry longer, shall we?What about Ian?I said, suddenly remembering the boy.He went to the abbey, to warn you!He did?Jamies voice sharpened.I came from that direction, and didna meet him.Which way did he go, Sassenach?That way, I said, pointing.Fergus made a small sound that might have been laughter.The abbeys the other way, Jamie said, sounding amused.Come on, then; well catch him up when he realizes his mistake and comes back.Wait, said Fergus, holding up a hand.There was a cautious rustling in the shrubbery, and Young Ians voice said, Uncle Jamie?Aye, Ian, his uncle said dryly.Its me.The boy emerged from the bushes, leaves stuck in his hair, eyes wide with excitement.I saw the light, and thought I must come back to see that Auntie Claire was all right, he explained.Uncle Jamie, ye mustna linger about wi a torchthere are excisemen about!Jamie put an arm about his nephews shoulders and turned him, before he should notice the thing hanging from the alder tree.Dinna trouble yourself, Ian, he said evenly.Theyve gone.Swinging the torch through the wet shrubbery, he extinguished it with a hiss.Lets go, he said, his voice calm in the dark.Mr.Willoughbys down the road wi the horses; well be in the Highlands by dawn.PART SEVEN    Home Again   32  THE PRODIGALS RETURN  It was a four day journey on horseback to Lallybroch from Arbroath, and there was little conversation for most of it.Both Young Ian and Jamie were preoccupied, presumably for different reasons.For myself, I was kept busy wondering, not only about the recent past, but about the immediate future.Ian must have told Jamies sister, Jenny, about me.How would she take my reappearance?Jenny Murray had been the nearest thing I had ever had to a sister, and by far the closest woman friend of my life.Owing to circumstance, most of my close friends in the last fifteen years had been men; there were no other female doctors, and the natural gulf between nursing staff and medical staff prevented more than casual acquaintance with other women working at the hospital.As for the women in Franks circle, the departmental secretaries and university wives  More than any of that, though, was the knowledge that of all the people in the world, Jenny was the one who might love Jamie Fraser as muchif not morethan I did.I was eager to see Jenny again, but could not help wondering how she would take the story of my supposed escape to France, and my apparent desertion of her brother.The horses had to follow each other in single file down the narrow track.My own bay slowed obligingly as Jamies chestnut paused, then turned aside at his urging into a clearing, half hidden by an overhang of alder branches.A gray stone cliff rose up at the edge of the clearing, its cracks and bumps and ridges so furred with moss and lichen that it looked like the face of an ancient man, all spotted with whiskers and freckled with warts.Young Ian slid down from his pony with a sigh of relief; we had been in the saddle since dawn.Oof!he said, frankly rubbing his backside.Ive gone all numb.So have I, I said, doing the same.I suppose its better than being saddlesore, though.Unaccustomed to riding for long stretches, both Young Ian and I had suffered considerably during the first two days of the journey; in fact, too stiff to dismount by myself the first night, I had had to be ignominiously hoisted off my horse and carried into the inn by Jamie, much to his amusement.How does Uncle Jamie do it?Ian asked me.His arse must be made of leather.Not to look at, I replied absently.Wheres he gone, though?The chestnut, already hobbled, was nibbling at the grass under an oak to one side of the clearing, but of Jamie himself, there was no sign.Young Ian and I looked blankly at each other; I shrugged, and went over to the cliff face, where a trickle of water ran down the rock.I cupped my hands beneath it and drank, grateful for the cold liquid sliding down my dry throat, in spite of the autumn air that reddened my cheeks and numbed my nose.This tiny glen clearing, invisible from the road, was characteristic of most of the Highland scenery, I thought.Deceptively barren and severe, the crags and moors were full of secrets.If you didnt know where you were going, you could walk within inches of a deer, a grouse, or a hiding man, and never know it.Small wonder that many of those who had taken to the heather after Culloden had managed to escape, their knowledge of the hidden places making them invisible to the blind eyes and clumsy feet of the pursuing English.Thirst slaked, I turned from the cliff face and nearly ran into Jamie, who had appeared as though sprung out of the earth by magic.He was putting his tinderbox back into the pocket of his coat, and the faint smell of smoke clung to his coat.He dropped a small burnt stick to the grass and ground it to dust with his foot.Where did you come from?I said, blinking at this apparition.And where have you been?Theres a wee cave just there, he explained, jerking a thumb behind him.I only wanted to see whether anyones been in it.Have they?Looking closely, I could see the edge of the outcrop that concealed the caves entrance.Blending as it did with the other deep cracks in the rock face, it wouldnt be visible unless you were deliberately looking for it.Aye, they have, he said.His brows were slightly furrowed, not in worry, but as though he were thinking about something.Theres charcoal mixed wi the earth; someones had a fire there.Who do you think it was?I asked.I stuck my head around the outcrop, but saw nothing but a narrow bar of darkness, a small rift in the face of the mountain.It looked thoroughly uninviting.I wondered whether any of his smuggling connections might have traced him all the way from the coast to Lallybroch.Was he worried about pursuit, or an ambush?Despite myself, I looked over my shoulder, but saw nothing but the alders, dry leaves rustling in the autumn breeze.I dinna ken, he said absently.A hunter, I suppose; there are grouse bones scattered about, too.Jamie didnt seem perturbed by the unknown persons possible identity, and I relaxed, the feeling of security engendered by the Highlands wrapping itself about me once more.Both Edinburgh and the smugglers cove seemed a long way away.Young Ian, fascinated by the revelation of the invisible cave, had disappeared through the crevice.Now he reappeared, brushing a cobweb out of his hair.Is this like Clunys Cage, Uncle?he asked, eyes bright.None so big, Ian, Jamie answered with a smile.Poor Cluny would scarce fit through the entrance o this one; he was a stout big fellow, forbye, near twice my girth.He touched his chest ruefully, where a button had been torn loose by squeezing through the narrow entrance.Whats Clunys Cage?I asked, shaking the last drops of icy water from my hands and thrusting them under my armpits to thaw out.Ohthats Cluny MacPherson, Jamie replied.He bent his head, and splashed the chilly water up into his face.Lifting his head, he blinked the sparkling drops from his lashes and smiled at me.A verra ingenious man, Cluny.The English burnt his house, and pulled down the foundation, but Cluny himself escaped.He built himself a wee snuggery in a nearby cavern, and sealed over the entrance wi willow branches all woven together and chinked wi mud.Folk said ye could stand three feet away, and no notion that the cave was there, save the smell of the smoke from Clunys pipe.Prince Charles stayed there too, for a bit, when he was hunted by the English, Young Ian informed me.Cluny hid him for days.The English bastards hunted high and low, but never found His Highnessor Cluny, either!he concluded, with considerable satisfaction.Come here and wash yourself, Ian, Jamie said, with a hint of sharpness that made Young Ian blink.Ye canna face your parents covered wi filth.Ian sighed, but obediently bent his head over the trickle of water, sputtering and gasping as he splashed his face, which while not strictly speaking filthy, undeniably bore one or two small stains of travel.I turned to Jamie, who stood watching his nephews ablutions with an air of abstraction.Did he look ahead, I wondered, to what promised to be an awkward meeting at Lallybroch, or back to Edinburgh, with the smoldering remains of his printshop and the dead man in the basement of the brothel?Or back further still, to Charles Edward Stuart, and the days of the Rising?What do you tell your nieces and nephews about him?I asked quietly, under the noise of Ians snorting.About Charles?Jamies gaze sharpened and focused on me; I had been right, then.His eyes warmed slightly, and the hint of a smile acknowledged the success of my mind reading, but then both warmth and smile disappeared.I never speak of him, he said, just as quietly, and turned away to catch the horses.Three hours later, we came through the last of the windswept passes, and out onto the final slope that led down to Lallybroch.Jamie, in the lead, drew up his horse and waited for me and Young Ian to come up beside him.There it is, he said.He glanced at me, smiling, one eyebrow raised.Much changed, is it?I shook my head, rapt.From this distance, the house seemed completely unchanged.Built of white harled stone, its three stories gleamed immaculately amid its cluster of shabby outbuildings and the spread of stone dyked brown fields.On the small rise behind the house stood the remains of the ancient broch, the circular stone tower that gave the place its name.On closer inspection, I could see that the outbuildings had changed a bit; Jamie had told me that the English soldiery had burned the dovecote and the chapel the year after Culloden, and I could see the gaps where they had been.A space where the wall of the kailyard had been broken through had been repaired with stone of a different color, and a new shed built of stone and scrap lumber was evidently serving as a dovecote, judging from the row of plump feathered bodies lined up on the rooftree, enjoying the late autumn sun.The rose brier planted by Jamies mother, Ellen, had grown up into a great, sprawling tangle latticed to the wall of the house, only now losing the last of its leaves.A plume of smoke rose from the western chimney, carrying away toward the south on a wind from the sea.I had a sudden vision of the fire in the hearth of the sitting room, its light rosy on Jennys clear cut face in the evening as she sat in her chair, reading aloud from a novel or book of poems while Jamie and Ian sat absorbed in a game of chess, listening with half an ear.How many evenings had we spent that way, the children upstairs in their beds, and me sitting at the rosewood secretary, writing down receipts for medicines or doing some of the interminable domestic mending?Will we live here again, do you think?I asked Jamie, careful to keep any trace of longing from my voice.More than any other place, the house at Lallybroch had been home to me, but that had been a long time agoand any number of things had changed since then.He paused for a long minute, considering.Finally he shook his head, gathering up the reins in his hand.I canna say, Sassenach, he said.It would be pleasant, butI dinna ken how things may be, aye?There was a small frown on his face, as he looked down at the house.Its all right.If we live in Edinburghor even in Franceits all right, Jamie.I looked up into his face and touched his hand in reassurance.As long as were together.The faint look of worry lifted momentarily, lightening his features.He took my hand, raised it to his lips, and kissed it gently.I dinna mind much else myself, Sassenach, so long as yell stay by me.We sat gazing into each others eyes, until a loud, self conscious cough from behind alerted us to Young Ians presence.Scrupulously careful of our privacy, he had been embarrassingly circumspect on the trip from Edinburgh, crashing off through the heather to a great distance when we camped, and taking remarkable pains so as not inadvertently to surprise us in an indiscreet embrace.Jamie grinned and squeezed my hand before letting it go and turning to his nephew.Almost there, Ian, he said, as the boy negotiated his pony up beside us.Well be there well before supper if it doesna rain, he added, squinting under his hand to gauge the possibilities of the clouds drifting slowly over the Monadhliath Mountains.Mmphm.Young Ian didnt sound thrilled at the prospect, and I glanced at him sympathetically.Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in, I quoted.Young Ian gave me a wry look.Aye, thats what Im afraid of, Auntie.Jamie, hearing this exchange, glanced back at Young Ian, and blinked solemnlyhis own version of an encouraging wink.Dinna be downhearted, Ian.Remember the story o the Prodigal Son, aye?Your Mam will be glad to see ye safe back.Young Ian cast him a glance of profound disillusion.If ye expect its the fatted calf thats like to be kilt, Uncle Jamie, ye dinna ken my mother so well as ye think.The lad sat gnawing his lower lip for a moment, then drew himself up in the saddle with a deep breath.Best get it over, aye?he said.Will his parents really be hard on him?I asked, watching Young Ian pick his way carefully down the rocky slope.Jamie shrugged.Well, theyll forgive him, of course, but hes like to get a rare ballocking and his backside tanned before that.Ill be lucky to get off wi the same, he added wryly.Jenny and Ian are no going to be verra pleased wi me, either, Im afraid.He kicked up his mount, and started down the slope.Come along, Sassenach.Best get it over, aye?I wasnt sure what to expect in terms of a reception at Lallybroch, but in the event, it was reassuring.As on all previous arrivals, our presence was heralded by the barking of a miscellaneous swarm of dogs, who galloped out of hedge and field and kailyard, yapping first with alarm, and then with joy.Young Ian dropped his reins and slid down into the furry sea of welcome, dropping into a crouch to greet the dogs who leapt on him and licked his face.He stood up smiling with a half grown puppy in his arms, which he brought over to show me.This is Jocky, he said, holding up the squirming brown and white body.Hes mine; Da gave him to me.Nice doggie, I told Jocky, scratching his floppy ears.The dog barked and squirmed ecstatically, trying to lick me and Ian simultaneously.Youre getting covered wi dog hairs, Ian, said a clear, high voice, in tones of marked disapproval.Looking up from the dog, I saw a tall, slim girl of seventeen or so, rising from her seat by the side of the road.Well, youre covered wi foxtails, so there!Young Ian retorted, swinging about to address the speaker.The girl tossed a headful of dark brown curls and bent to brush at her skirt, which did indeed sport a number of the bushy grass heads, stuck to the homespun fabric.Da says ye dinna deserve to have a dog, she remarked.Running off and leaving him like ye did.Young Ians face tightened defensively.I did think o taking him, he said, voice cracking slightly.But I didna think hed be safe in the city.He hugged the dog tighter, chin resting between the furry ears.Hes grown a bit; I suppose hes been eating all right?Come to greet us, have ye, wee Janet?Thats kind.Jamies voice spoke pleasantly from behind me, but with a cynical note that made the girl glance up sharply and blush at the sight of him.Uncle Jamie!Oh, and Her gaze shifted to me, and she ducked her head, blushing more furiously.Aye, this is your auntie Claire.Jamies hand was firm under my elbow as he nodded toward the girl.Wee Janet wasna born yet, last ye were here, Sassenach.Your mother will be to home, I expect?he said, addressing Janet.The girl nodded, wide eyed, not taking her fascinated gaze from my face.I leaned down from my horse and extended a hand, smiling.Im pleased to meet you, I said.She stared for a long moment, then suddenly remembered her manners, and dropped into a curtsy.She rose and took my hand gingerly, as though afraid it might come off in her grasp.I squeezed hers, and she looked faintly reassured at finding me merely flesh and blood.Impleased, mum, she murmured.Are Mam and Da verra angry, Jen?Young Ian gently put the puppy on the ground near her feet, breaking her trance.She glanced at her younger brother, her expression of impatience tinged with some sympathy.Well, and why wouldnt they be, clot heid?she said.Mam thought yed maybe met a boar in the wood, or been taken by gypsies.She scarcely slept until they found out where yed gone, she added, frowning at her brother.Ian pressed his lips tight together, looking down at the ground, but didnt answer.She moved closer, and picked disapprovingly at the damp yellow leaves adhering to the sleeves of his coat.Tall as she was, he topped her by a good six inches, gangly and rawboned next to her trim competence, the resemblance between them limited to the rich darkness of their hair and a fugitive similarity of expression.Youre a sight, Ian.Have ye been sleepin in your clothes?Well, of course I have, he said impatiently.What dye think, I ran away wi a nightshirt and changed into it every night on the moor?She gave a brief snort of laughter at this picture, and his expression of annoyance faded a bit.Oh, come on, then, gowk, she said, taking pity on him.Come into the scullery wi me, and well get ye brushed and combed before Mam and Da see ye.He glared at her, then turned to look up at me, with an expression of mingled bewilderment and annoyance.Why in the name o heaven, he demanded, his voice cracking with strain, does everyone think bein clean will help?Jamie grinned at him, and dismounting, clapped him on the shoulder, raising a small cloud of dust.It canna hurt anything, Ian.Go along wi ye; I think perhaps its as well if your parents havena got so many things to deal with all at onceand theyll be wanting to see your auntie first of all.Mmphm.With a morose nod of assent, Young Ian moved reluctantly off toward the back of the house, towed by his determined sister.What have ye been eating?I heard her say, squinting up at him as they went.Youve a great smudge of filth all round your mouth.It isna filth, its whiskers!he hissed furiously under his breath, with a quick backward glance to see whether Jamie and I had heard this exchange.His sister stopped dead, peering up at him.Whiskers?she said loudly and incredulously.You?Come on!Grabbing her by the elbow, he hustled her off through the kailyard gate, his shoulders hunched in self consciousness.Jamie lowered his head against my thigh, face buried in my skirts.To the casual observer, he might have been occupied in loosening the saddlebags, but the casual observer couldnt have seen his shoulders shaking or felt the vibration of his soundless laughter.Its all right, theyre gone, I said, a moment later, gasping for breath myself from the strain of silent mirth.Jamie raised his face, red and breathless, from my skirts, and used a fold of the cloth to dab his eyes.Whiskers?You?he croaked in imitation of his niece, setting us both off again.He shook his head, gulping for air.Christ, shes like her mother!Thats just what Jenny said to me, in just that voice, when she caught me shavin for the first time.I nearly cut my throat.He wiped his eyes again on the back of his hand, and rubbed a palm tenderly across the thick, soft stubble that coated his own jaws and throat with an auburn haze.Do you want to go and shave yourself before we meet Jenny and Ian?I asked, but he shook his head.No, he said, smoothing back the hair that had escaped from its lacing.Young Ians right; bein clean wont help.They must have heard the dogs outside; both Ian and Jenny were in the sitting room when we came in, she on the sofa knitting woolen stockings, while he stood before the fire in plain brown coat and breeks, warming the backs of his legs.A tray of small cakes with a bottle of home brewed ale was set out, plainly in readiness for our arrival.It was a very cozy, welcoming scene, and I felt the tiredness of the journey drop away as we entered the room.Ian turned at once as we came in, self conscious but smiling, but it was Jenny that I looked for.She was looking for me, too.She sat still on the couch, her eyes wide, turned to the door.My first impression was that she was quite different, the second, that she had not changed at all.The black curls were still there, thick and lively, but blanched and streaked with a deep, rich silver.The bones, too, were the samethe broad, high cheekbones, strong jaw, and long nose that she shared with Jamie.It was the flickering firelight and the shadows of the gathering afternoon that gave the strange impression of change, one moment deepening the lines beside her eyes and mouth til she looked like a crone; the next erasing them with the ruddy glow of girlhood, like a 3 D picture in a box of Cracker Jack.On our first meeting in the brothel, Ian had acted as if I were a ghost.Jenny did much the same now, blinking slightly, her mouth slightly open, but not otherwise changing expression as I crossed the room toward her.Jamie was just behind me, his hand at my elbow.He squeezed it lightly as we reached the sofa, then let go.I felt rather as though I were being presented at Court, and resisted the impulse to curtsy.Were home, Jenny, he said.His hand rested reassuringly on my back.She glanced quickly at her brother, then stared at me again.Its you, then, Claire?Her voice was soft and tentative, familiar, but not the strong voice of the woman I remembered.Yes, its me, I said.I smiled and reached out my hands to her.Its good to see you, Jenny.She took my hands, lightly.Then her grip strengthened and she rose to her feet.Christ, it is you!she said, a little breathless, and suddenly the woman I had known was back, dark blue eyes alive and dancing, searching my face with curiosity.Well, of course it is, Jamie said gruffly.Surely Ian told ye; did ye think he was lying?Youll scarce have changed, she said, ignoring her brother as she touched my face wonderingly.Your hairs a bit lighter, but my God, ye look the same!Her fingers were cool; her hands smelled of herbs and red currant jam, and the faint hint of ammonia and lanolin from the dyed wool she was knitting.The long forgotten smell of the wool brought everything back at onceso many memories of the place, and the happiness of the time I had lived hereand my eyes blurred with tears.She saw it, and hugged me hard, her hair smooth and soft against my face.She was much shorter than I, fine boned and delicate to look at, but still I had the feeling of being enveloped, warmly supported and strongly held, as though by someone larger than myself.She released me after a moment, and stood back, half laughing.God, ye even smell the same!she exclaimed, and I burst out laughing, too.Ian had come up; he leaned down and embraced me gently, brushing his lips against my cheek.He smelled faintly of dried hay and cabbage leaves, with the ghost of peat smoke laid over his own deep, musky scent.Its good to see ye back again, Claire, he said.His soft brown eyes smiled at me, and the sense of homecoming deepened.He stood back a little awkwardly, smiling.Will ye eat something, maybe?He gestured toward the tray on the table.I hesitated a moment, but Jamie moved toward it with alacrity.A drop wouldna come amiss, Ian, thank ye kindly, he said.Youll have some, Claire?Glasses were filled, the biscuits passed, and small spoken pleasantries murmured through mouthfuls as we sat down around the fire.Despite the outward cordiality, I was strongly aware of an underlying tension, not all of it to do with my sudden reappearance.Jamie, seated beside me on the oak settle, took no more than a sip of his ale, and the oatcake sat untasted on his knee.I knew he hadnt accepted the refreshments out of hunger, but in order to mask the fact that neither his sister nor his brother in law had offered him a welcoming embrace.I caught a quick glance passing between Ian and Jenny; and a longer stare, unreadable, exchanged between Jenny and Jamie.A stranger here in more ways than one, I kept my own eyes cast down, observing under the shelter of my lashes.Jamie sat to my left; I could feel the tiny movement between us as the two stiff fingers of his right hand drummed their small tattoo against his thigh.The conversation, what there was of it, petered out, and the room fell into an uncomfortable silence.Through the faint hissing of the peat fire, I could hear a few distant thumps in the direction of the kitchen, but nothing like the sounds I remembered in this house, of constant activity and bustling movement, feet always pounding on the stair, and the shouts of children and squalling of babies splitting the air in the nursery overhead.How are all of your children?I asked Jenny, to break the silence.She started, and I realized that I had inadvertently asked the wrong question.Oh, theyre well enough, she replied hesitantly.All verra bonny.And the grandchildren, too, she added, breaking into a sudden smile at the thought of them.Theyve mostly gone to Young Jamies house, Ian put in, answering my real question.His wifes had a new babe just the week past, so the three girls have gone to help a bit.And Michaels up in Inverness just now, to fetch down some things come in from France.Another glance flicked across the room, this one between Ian and Jamie.I felt the small tilt of Jamies head, and saw Ians not quite nod in response.And what in hell was that about?I wondered.There were so many invisible cross currents of emotion in the room that I had a sudden impulse to stand up and call the meeting to order, just to break the tension.Apparently Jamie felt the same.He cleared his throat, looking directly at Ian, and addressed the main point on the agenda, saying, Weve brought the lad home with us.Ian took a deep breath, his long, homely face hardening slightly.Have ye, then?The thin layer of pleasantry spread over the occasion vanished suddenly, like morning dew.I could feel Jamie beside me, tensing slightly as he prepared to defend his nephew as best he might.Hes a good lad, Ian, he said.Is he, so?It was Jenny who answered, her fine black brows drawn down in a frown.Ye couldna tell, the way he acts at home.But perhaps hes different wi you, Jamie.There was a strong note of accusation in her words, and I felt Jamie tense at my side.Its kind of ye to speak up for the lad, Jamie, Ian put in, with a cool nod in his brother in laws direction.But I think wed best hear from Young Ian himself, if ye please.Will he be upstairs?A muscle near Jamies mouth twitched, but he answered noncommittally.In the scullery, I expect; he wanted to tidy himself a bit before seein ye.His right hand slid down and pressed against my leg in warning.He hadnt mentioned meeting Janet, and I understood; she had been sent away with her siblings, so that Jenny and Ian could deal with the matters of my appearance and their prodigal son in some privacy, but had crept back unbeknownst to her parents, wanting either to catch a glimpse of her notorious aunt Claire, or to offer succor to her brother.I lowered my eyelids, indicating that I understood.No point in mentioning the girls presence, in a situation already so fraught with tension.The sound of feet and the regular thump of Ians wooden leg sounded in the uncarpeted passage.Ian had left the room in the direction of the scullery; now he returned, grimly ushering Young Ian before him.The prodigal was as presentable as soap, water, and razor could make him.His bony jaws were reddened with scraping and the hair on his neck was clotted in wet spikes, most of the dust beaten from his coat, and the round neck of his shirt neatly buttoned to the collarbone.There was little to be done about the singed half of his head, but the other side was neatly combed.He had no stock, and there was a large rip in the leg of his breeks, but all things considered, he looked as well as someone could who expects momentarily to be shot.Mam, he said, ducking his head awkwardly in his mothers direction.Ian, she said softly, and he looked up at her, clearly startled at the gentleness of her tone.A slight smile curved her lips as she saw his face.Im glad youre safe home, mo chridhe, she said.The boys face cleared abruptly, as though he had just heard the reprieve read to the firing squad.Then he caught a glimpse of his fathers face, and stiffened.He swallowed hard, and bent his head again, staring hard at the floorboards.Mmphm, Ian said.He sounded sternly Scotch; much more like the Reverend Campbell than the easygoing man I had known before.Now then, I want to hear what yeve got to say for yourself, laddie.Oh.WellI Young Ian trailed off miserably, then cleared his throat and had another try.Wellnothing, really, Father, he murmured.Look at me!Ian said sharply.His son reluctantly raised his head and looked at his father, but his gaze kept flicking away, as though afraid to rest very long on the stern countenance before him.Dye ken what ye did to your mother?Ian demanded.Disappeared and left her thinkin ye dead or hurt?Gone off without a word, and not a smell of ye for three days, until Joe Fraser brought down the letter ye left?Can ye even think what those three days were like for her?Either Ians expression or his words seemed to have a strong effect on his errant offspring; Young Ian bowed his head again, eyes fixed on the floor.Aye, well, I thought Joe would bring the letter sooner, he muttered.Aye, that letter!Ians face was growing more flushed as he talked.Gone to Edinburgh, it said, cool as dammit.He slapped a hand flat on the table, with a smack that made everyone jump.Gone to Edinburgh!Not a by your leave, not an Ill send word, not a thing but Dear Mother, I have gone to Edinburgh.Ian!Young Ians head snapped up, eyes bright with anger.Thats not true!I said Dont worry for me, and I said Love, Ian!I did!Did I no, Mother?For the first time, he looked at Jenny, appealing.She had been still as a stone since her husband began to talk, her face smooth and blank.Now her eyes softened, and the hint of a curve touched her wide, full mouth again.Ye did, Ian, she said softly.It was kind to saybut I did worry, aye?His eyes fell, and I could see the oversized Adams apple bobble in his lean throat as he swallowed.Im sorry, Mam, he said, so low I could scarcely hear him.II didna mean his words trailed off, ending in a small shrug.Jenny made an impulsive movement, as though to extend a hand to him, but Ian caught her eye, and she let the hand fall to her lap.The thing is, Ian said, speaking slowly and precisely, its no the first time, is it, Ian?The boy didnt answer, but made a small twitching movement that might have been assent.Ian took a step closer to his son.Close as they were in height, the differences between them were obvious.Ian was tall and lanky, but firmly muscled for all that, and a powerful man, wooden leg or no.By comparison, his son seemed almost frail, fledgling boned and gawky.No, its not as though ye had no idea what ye were doing; not like wed never told ye the dangers, not like wed no forbidden ye to go past Broch Mordhanot like ye didna ken wed worry, aye?Ye kent all thatand ye did it anyway.This merciless analysis of his behavior caused a sort of indefinite quiver, like an internal squirm, to go through Young Ian, but he kept up a stubborn silence.Look at me, laddie, when Im speakin to ye!The boys head rose slowly.He looked sullen now, but resigned; evidently he had been through scenes like this before, and knew where they were heading.Im not even going to ask your uncle what yeve been doing, Ian said.I can only hope ye werent such a fool in Edinburgh as yeve been here.But yeve disobeyed me outright, and broken your mothers heart, whatever else yeve done.Jenny moved again, as though to speak, but a brusque movement of Ians hand stopped her.And what did I tell ye the last time, wee Ian?What did I say when I gave ye your whipping?You tell me that, Ian!The bones in Young Ians face stood out, but he kept his mouth shut, sealed in a stubborn line.Tell me!Ian roared, slamming his hand on the table again.Young Ian blinked in reflex, and his shoulder blades drew together, then apart, as though he were trying to alter his size, and unsure whether to grow larger or try to be smaller.He swallowed hard, and blinked once more.Ye saidye said yed skin me.Next time.His voice broke in a ridiculous squeak on the last word, and he clamped his mouth hard shut on it.Ian shook his head in heavy disapproval.Aye.And I thought yed have enough sense to see there was no next time, but I was wrong about that, hm?He breathed in heavily and let it out with a snort.Im fair disgusted wi ye, Ian, and thats the truth.He jerked his head toward the doorway.Go outside.Ill see ye by the gate, presently.There was a tense silence in the sitting room, as the sound of the miscreants dragging footsteps disappeared down the passage.I kept my own eyes carefully on my hands, folded in my lap.Beside me, Jamie drew a slow, deep breath and sat up straighter, steeling himself.Ian.Jamie spoke mildly to his brother in law.I wish ye wouldna do that.What?Ians brow was still furrowed with anger as he turned toward Jamie.Thrash the lad?And what have you to say about it, aye?Jamies jaw tensed, but his voice stayed calm.Ive nothing to say about it, Ianhes your son; youll do as ye like.But maybe youll let me speak for the way hes acted?How hes acted?Jenny cried, starting suddenly to life.She might leave dealing with her son to Ian, but when it came to her brother, no one was likely to speak for her.Sneakin away in the night like a thief, ye mean?Or perhaps yell mean consorting wi criminals, and risking his neck for a cask of brandy!Ian silenced her with a quick gesture.He hesitated, still frowning, but then nodded abruptly at Jamie, giving permission.Consorting wi criminals like me?Jamie asked his sister, a definite edge to his voice.His eyes met hers straight on, matching slits of blue.Dye ken where the money comes from, Jenny, that keeps you and your bairns and everyone here in food, and the roof from fallin in over your head?Its not from me printing up copies o the Psalms in Edinburgh!And did I think it was?she flared at him.Did I ask ye what ye did?No, ye didnt, he flashed back.I think yed rather not knowbut ye do know, dont you?And will ye blame me for what ye do?Its my fault that Ive children, and that they must eat?She didnt flush red like Jamie did; when Jenny lost her temper, she went dead white with fury.I could see him struggling to keep his own temper.Blame ye?No, of course I dinna blame yebut is it right for you to blame me, that Ian and I canna keep ye all just working the land?Jenny too was making an effort to subdue her rising temper.No, she said.Ye do what ye must, Jamie.Ye ken verra well I didna mean you when I said criminals, but  So ye mean the men who work for me?I do the same things, Jenny.If theyre criminals, what am I, then?He glared at her, eyes hot with resentment.Youre my brother, she said shortly, little pleased as I am to say so, sometimes.Damn your eyes, Jamie Fraser!Ye ken quite well I dinna mean to quarrel wi whatever ye see fit to do!If ye robbed folk on the highway, or kept a whorehouse in Edinburgh, twould be because there was no help for it.That doesna mean I want ye takin my son to be part of it!Jamies eyes tightened slightly at the corners at the mention of whorehouses in Edinburgh, and he darted a quick glance of accusation at Ian, who shook his head.He looked mildly stunned at his wifes ferocity.Ive said not a word, he said briefly.Ye ken how she is.Jamie took a deep breath and turned back to Jenny, obviously determined to be reasonable.Aye, I see that.But ye canna think I would take Young Ian into dangerGod, Jenny, I care for him as though he were my own son!Aye?Her skepticism was pronounced.So thats why ye encouraged him to run off from his home, and kept him with ye, wi no word to ease our minds about where he was?Jamie had the grace to look abashed at this.Aye, well, Im sorry for that, he muttered.I meant to He broke off with an impatient gesture.Well, it doesna matter what I meant; I should have sent word, and I didna.But as for encouraging him to run off  No, I dinna suppose ye did, Ian interrupted.Not directly, anyway.The anger had faded from his long face.He looked tired now, and a little sad.The bones in his face were more pronounced, leaving him hollow cheeked in the waning afternoon light.Its only that the lad loves ye, Jamie, he said quietly.I see him listen when ye visit, and talk of what ye do; I can see his face.He thinks its all excitement and adventure, how ye live, and a good long way from shoveling goat shit for his mothers garden.He smiled briefly, despite himself.Jamie gave his brother in law a quick smile in return, and a lifted shoulder.Well, but its usual for a lad of that age to want a bit of adventure, no?You and I were the same.Whether he wants it or no, he shouldna be having the sort of adventures hell get with you, Jenny interrupted sharply.She shook her head, the line between her brows growing deeper as she looked disapprovingly at her brother.The good Lord kens as theres a charm on your life, Jamie, or yed ha been dead a dozen times.Aye, well.I suppose He had something in mind to preserve me for.Jamie glanced at me with a brief smile, and his hand sought mine.Jenny darted a glance at me, too, her face unreadable, then returned to the subject at hand.Well, thats as may be, she said.But I canna say as the sames true for Young Ian.Her expression softened slightly as she looked at Jamie.I dinna ken everything about the way ye live, Jamiebut I ken you well enough to say its likely not the way a wee laddie should live.Mmphm.Jamie rubbed a hand over his stubbled jaw, and tried again.Aye, well, thats what I mean about Young Ian.Hes carried himself like a man this last week.I dinna think it right for ye to thrash him like a wee laddie, Ian.Jennys eyebrows rose, graceful wings of scorn.A man, now, is he?Why, hes but a baby, Jamiehes not but fourteen!Despite his annoyance, one side of Jamies mouth curled slightly.I was a man at fourteen, Jenny, he said softly.She snorted, but a film of moisture shone suddenly over her eyes.Ye thought ye were.She stood and turned away abruptly, blinking.Aye, I mind ye then, she said, face turned to the bookshelf.She reached out a hand as though to support herself, grasping the edge.Ye were a bonny lad, Jamie, riding off wi Dougal to your first raid, and your dirk all bright on your thigh.I was sixteen, and I thought Id never seen a sight so fair as you on your pony, so straight and tall.And I mind ye coming back, too, all covered in mud, and a scratch down the side of your face from falling in brambles, and Dougal boasting to Da how brawly yed donedriven off six kine by yourself, and had a dunt on the head from the flat of a broadsword, and not made a squeak about it.Her face once more under control, she turned back from her contemplation of the books to face her brother.Thats what a man is, aye?A hint of humor stole back into Jamies face as he met her gaze.Aye, well, theres maybe a bit more to it than that, he said.Is there, she said, more dryly still.And what will that be?To be able to bed a girl?Or to kill a man?I had always thought Janet Fraser had something of the Sight, particularly where her brother was concerned.Evidently the talent extended to her son, as well.The flush over Jamies cheekbones deepened, but his expression didnt change.She shook her head slowly, looking steadily at her brother.Nay, Young Ians not a man yetbut you are, Jamie; and ye ken the difference verra well.Ian, who had been watching the fireworks between the two Frasers with the same fascination as I had, now coughed briefly.Be that as it may, he said dryly.Young Ians been waiting for his whipping for the last quarter hour.Whether or not its suitable to beat him, to make him wait any longer for it is a bit cruel, aye?Have ye really got to do it, Ian?Jamie made one last effort, turning to appeal to his brother in law.Well, said Ian slowly, as Ive told the lad hes going to be thrashed, and he kens verra well hes earned it, I canna just go back on my word.But as for me doing itno, I dinna think I will.A faint gleam of humor showed in the soft brown eyes.He reached into a drawer of the sideboard, drew out a thick leather strap, and thrust it into Jamies hand.You do it.Me?Jamie was horror struck.He made a futile attempt to shove the strap back into Ians hand, but his brother in law ignored it.I canna thrash the lad!Oh, I think ye can, Ian said calmly, folding his arms.Yeve said often enough ye care for him as though he were your son.He tilted his head to one side, and while his expression stayed mild, the brown eyes were implacable.Well, Ill tell ye, Jamieits no that easy to be his Da; best ye go and find that out now, aye?Jamie stared at Ian for a long moment, then looked to his sister.She raised one eyebrow, staring him down.You deserve it as much as he does, Jamie.Get ye gone.Jamies lips pressed tight together and his nostrils flared white.Then he whirled on his heel and was gone without speaking.Rapid steps sounded on the boards, and a muffled slam came from the far end of the passage.Jenny cast a quick glance at Ian, a quicker one at me, and then turned to the window.Ian and I, both a good deal taller, came to stand behind her.The light outside was failing rapidly, but there was still enough to see the wilting figure of Young Ian, leaning dispiritedly against a wooden gate, some twenty yards from the house.Looking around in trepidation at the sound of footsteps, he saw his uncle approaching and straightened up in surprise.Uncle Jamie!His eye fell on the strap then, and he straightened a bit more.Areare you goin to whip me?It was a still evening, and I could hear the sharp hiss of air through Jamies teeth.I suppose Ill have to, he said frankly.But first I must apologize to ye, Ian.To me?Young Ian sounded mildly dazed.Clearly he wasnt used to having his elders think they owed him an apology, especially before beating him.Ye dinna need to do that, Uncle Jamie.The taller figure leaned against the gate, facing the smaller one, head bent.Aye, I do.It was wrong of me, Ian, to let ye stay in Edinburgh, and it was maybe wrong, too, to tell ye stories and make ye think of running away to start with.I took ye to places I shouldna, and might have put ye in danger, and Ive caused more of a moil wi your parents than maybe ye should be in by yourself.Im sorry for it, Ian, and Ill ask ye to forgive me.Oh.The smaller figure rubbed a hand through his hair, plainly at a loss for words.Wellaye.Of course I do, Uncle.Thank ye, Ian.They stood in silence for a moment, then Young Ian heaved a sigh and straightened his drooping shoulders.I suppose wed best do it, then?I expect so.Jamie sounded at least as reluctant as his nephew, and I heard Ian, next to me, snort slightly, whether with indignation or amusement, I couldnt tell.Resigned, Young Ian turned and faced the gate without hesitation.Jamie followed more slowly.The light was nearly gone and we could see no more than the outlines of figures at this distance, but we could hear clearly from our position at the window.Jamie was standing behind his nephew, shifting uncertainly, as though unsure what to do next.Mmphm.Ah, what does your father  Its usually ten, Uncle.Young Ian had shed his coat, and tugged at his waist now, speaking over his shoulder.Twelve if its pretty bad, and fifteen if its really awful.Was this only bad, would ye say, or pretty bad?There was a brief, unwilling laugh from the boy.If Fathers makin you do it, Uncle Jamie, its really awful, but Ill settle for pretty bad.Yed better give me twelve.There was another snort from Ian at my elbow.This time, it was definitely amusement.Honest lad, he murmured.All right, then.Jamie drew in his breath and pulled his arm back, but was interrupted by Young Ian.Wait, Uncle, Im no quite ready.Och, yeve got to do that?Jamies voice sounded a bit strangled.Aye.Father says only girls are whipped wi their skirts down, Young Ian explained.Men must take it bare arsed.Hes damn well right about that one, Jamie muttered, his quarrel with Jenny obviously still rankling.Ready now?The necessary adjustments made, the larger figure stepped back and swung.There was a loud crack, and Jenny winced in sympathy with her son.Beyond a sudden intake of breath, though, the lad was silent, and stayed so through the rest of the ordeal, though I blanched a bit myself.Finally Jamie dropped his arm, and wiped his brow.He held out a hand to Ian, slumped over the fence.All right, lad?Young Ian straightened up, with a little difficulty this time, and pulled up his breeks.Aye, Uncle.Thank ye.The boys voice was a little thick, but calm and steady.He took Jamies outstretched hand.To my surprise, though, instead of leading the boy back to the house, Jamie thrust the strap into Ians other hand.Your turn, he announced, striding over to the gate and bending over.Young Ian was as shocked as those of us in the house.What!he said, stunned.I said its your turn, his uncle said in a firm voice.I punished you; now youve got to punish me.I canna do that, Uncle!Young Ian was as scandalized as though his uncle had suggested he commit some public indecency.Aye, ye can, said Jamie, straightening up to look his nephew in the eye.Ye heard what I said when I apologized to ye, did ye no?Ian nodded in a dazed fashion.Weel, then.Ive done wrong just as much as you, and Ive to pay for it, too.I didna like whipping you, and yere no goin to like whipping me, but were both goin through wi it.Understand?A Aye, Uncle, the boy stammered.All right, then.Jamie tugged down his breeches, tucked up his shirttail, and bent over once more, clutching the top rail.He waited a second, then spoke again, as Ian stood paralyzed, strap dangling from his nerveless hand.Go on.His voice was steel; the one he used with the whisky smugglers; not to obey was unthinkable.Ian moved timidly to do as he was ordered.Standing back, he took a halfhearted swing.There was a dull thwacking sound.That one didna count, Jamie said firmly.Look, man, it was just as hard for me to do it to you.Make a proper job of it, now.The thin figure squared its shoulders with sudden determination and the leather whistled through the air.It landed with a crack like lightning.There was a startled yelp from the figure on the fence, and a suppressed giggle, at least half shock, from Jenny.Jamie cleared his throat.Aye, thatll do.Finish it, then.We could hear Young Ian counting carefully to himself under his breath between strokes of the leather, but aside from a smothered Christ!at number nine, there was no further sound from his uncle.With a general sigh of relief from inside the house, Jamie rose off the fence after the last stroke, and tucked his shirt into his breeks.He inclined his head formally to his nephew.Thank ye, Ian.Dropping the formality, he then rubbed his backside, saying in a tone of rueful admiration, Christ, man, yeve an arm on ye!Sove you, Uncle, said Ian, matching his uncles wry tones.The two figures, barely visible now, stood laughing and rubbing themselves for a moment.Jamie flung an arm about his nephews shoulders and turned him toward the house.If its all the same to you, Ian, I dinna want to have to do that again, aye?he said, confidentially.Its a bargain, Uncle Jamie.A moment later, the door opened at the end of the passage, and with a look at each other, Jenny and Ian turned as one to greet the returning prodigals.33  BURIED TREASURE  You look rather like a baboon, I observed.Oh, aye?And whats one of those?In spite of the freezing November air pouring in through the half open window, Jamie showed no signs of discomfort as he dropped his shirt onto the small pile of clothing.He stretched luxuriously, completely naked.His joints made little popping noises as he arched his back and stretched upward, fists resting easily on the smoke dark beams overhead.Oh, God, it feels good not to be on a horse!Mm.To say nothing of having a real bed to sleep in, instead of wet heather.I rolled over, luxuriating in the warmth of the heavy quilts, and the relaxation of sore muscles into the ineffable softness of the goose down mattress.Dye mean to tell me whats a baboon, then?Jamie inquired, Or are ye just makin observations for the pleasure of it?He turned to pick up a frayed willow twig from the washstand, and began to clean his teeth.I smiled at the sight; if I had had no other impact during my earlier sojourn in the past, I had at least been instrumental in seeing that virtually all of the Frasers and Murrays of Lallybroch retained their teeth, unlike most Highlandersunlike most Englishmen, for that matter.A baboon, I said, enjoying the sight of his muscular back flexing as he scrubbed, is a sort of very large monkey with a red behind.He snorted with laughter and choked on the willow twig.Well, he said, removing it from his mouth, I canna fault your observations, Sassenach.He grinned at me, showing brilliant white teeth, and tossed the twig aside.Its been thirty years since anyone took a tawse to me, he added, passing his hands tenderly over the still glowing surfaces of his rear.Id forgot how much it stings.And here Young Ian was speculating that your arse was tough as saddle leather, I said, amused.Was it worth it, do you think?Oh, aye, he said, matter of factly, sliding into bed beside me.His body was hard and cold as marble, and I squeaked but didnt protest as he gathered me firmly against his chest.Christ, youre warm, he murmured.Come closer, hm?His legs insinuated themselves between mine, and he cupped my bottom, drawing me in.He gave a sigh of pure content, and I relaxed against him, feeling our temperatures start to equalize through the thin cotton of the nightdress Jenny had lent me.The peat fire in the hearth had been lit, but hadnt been able to do much yet toward dispelling the chill.Body heat was much more effective.Oh, aye, it was worth it, he said.I could have beaten Young Ian half senselesshis father has, once or twiceand it would ha done nothing but make him more determined to run off, once he got the chance.But hell walk through hot coals before he risks havin to do something like that again.He spoke with certainty, and I thought he was undoubtedly right.Young Ian, looking bemused, had received absolution from his parents, in the form of a kiss from his mother and a swift hug from his father, and then retired to his bed with a handful of cakes, there no doubt to ponder the curious consequences of disobedience.Jamie too had been absolved with kisses, and I suspected that this was more important to him than the effects of his performance on Young Ian.At least Jenny and Ian arent angry with you any longer, I said.No.Its no really that they were angry so much, I think; its only that they dinna ken what to do wi the lad, he explained.Theyve raised two sons already, and Young Jamie and Michael are fine lads both; but both of them are more like Iansoft spoke, and easy in their manner.Young Ians quiet enough, but hes a great deal more like his motherand me.Frasers are stubborn, eh?I said, smiling.This bit of clan doctrine was one of the first things I had learned when I met Jamie, and nothing in my subsequent experience had suggested that it might be in error.He chuckled, soft and deep in his chest.Aye, thats so.Young Ian may look like a Murray, but hes a Fraser born, all right.And its no use to shout at a stubborn man, or beat him, either; it only makes him more set on having his way.Ill bear that in mind, I said dryly.One hand was stroking my thigh, gradually inching the cotton nightdress upward.Jamies internal furnace had resumed its operations, and his bare legs were warm and hard against mine.One knee nudged gently, seeking an entrance between my thighs.I cupped his buttocks and squeezed gently.Dorcas told me that a number of gentlemen pay very well for the privilege of being smacked at the brothel.She says they find itarousing.Jamie snorted briefly, tensing his buttocks, then relaxing as I stroked them lightly.Do they, then?I suppose its true, if Dorcas says so, but I canna see it, myself.There are a great many more pleasant ways to get a cockstand, if ye ask me.On the other hand, he added fairly, perhaps it makes a difference if its a bonny wee lassie in her shift on the other end o the strap, and not your fatheror your nephew, come to that.Perhaps it does.Shall I try sometime?The hollow of his throat lay just by my face, sunburned and delicate, showing the faint white triangle of a scar just above the wide arch of his collarbone.I set my lips on the pulsebeat there, and he shivered, though neither of us was cold any longer.No, he said, a little breathless.His hand fumbled at the neck of my shift, pulling loose the ribbons.He rolled onto his back then, lifting me suddenly above him as though I weighed nothing at all.A flick of his finger brought the loosened chemise down over my shoulders, and my nipples rose at once as the cold air struck them.His eyes were more slanted than usual as he smiled up at me, half lidded as a drowsing cat, and the warmth of his palms encircled both breasts.I said I could think of more pleasant ways, aye?The candle had guttered and gone out, the fire on the hearth burned low, and a pale November starlight shone through the misted window.Dim as it was, my eyes were so adapted to the dark that I could pick out all the details of the room; the thick white porcelain jug and basin, its blue band black in the starlight, the small embroidered sampler on the wall, and the rumpled heap of Jamies clothes on the stool by the bed.Jamie was clearly visible, too; covers thrown back, chest gleaming faintly from exertion.I admired the long slope of his belly, where small whorls of dark auburn hair spiraled up across the pale, fresh skin.I couldnt keep my fingers from touching him, tracing the lines of the powerfully sprung ribs that shaped his torso.Its so good, I said dreamily.So good to have a mans body to touch.Dye like it still, then?He sounded half shy, half pleased, as I fondled him.His own arm came around my shoulder, stroking my hair.Mm hm.It wasnt a thing I had consciously missed, but having it now reminded me of the joy of it; that drowsy intimacy in which a mans body is as accessible to you as your own, the strange shapes and textures of it like a sudden extension of your own limbs.I ran my hand down the flat slope of his belly, over the smooth jut of hipbone and the swell of muscled thigh.The remnants of firelight caught the red gold fuzz on arms and legs, and glowed in the auburn thicket nested between his thighs.God, you are a wonderful hairy creature, I said.Even there.I slid my hand down the smooth crease of his thigh and he spread his legs obligingly, letting me touch the thick, springy curls in the crease of his buttocks.Aye, well, no ones hunted me yet for my pelt, he said comfortably.His hand cupped my own rear firmly, and a large thumb passed gently over the rounded surface.He propped one arm behind his head, and looked lazily down the length of my body.Youre even less worth the skinning than I am, Sassenach.I should hope so.I moved slightly to accommodate his touch as he extended his explorations, enjoying the warmth of his hand on my naked back.Ever seen a smooth branch thats been in still water a long time?he asked.A finger passed lightly up my spine, raising a ripple of gooseflesh in its wake.There are tiny wee bubbles on it, hundreds and thousands and millions of them, so it looks as though its furred all about wi a silver frost.His fingers brushed my ribs, my arms, my back, and the tiny down hairs rose everywhere in the wake of his touch, tingling.Thats what ye look like, my Sassenach, he said, almost whispering.All smooth and naked, dipped in silver.Then we lay quiet for a time, listening to the drip of rain outside.A cold autumn air drifted through the room, mingling with the fires smoky warmth.He rolled onto his side, facing away from me, and drew the quilts up to cover us.I curled up behind him, knees fitting neatly behind his own.The firelight shone dully from behind me now, gleaming over the smooth round of his shoulder and dimly illuminating his back.I could see the faint lines of the scars that webbed his shoulders, thin streaks of silver on his flesh.At one time, I had known those scars so intimately, I could have traced them with my fingers, blindfolded.Now there was a thin half moon curve I didnt know; a diagonal slash that hadnt been there before, the remnants of a violent past I hadnt shared.I touched the half moon, tracing its length.No ones hunted you for your pelt, I said softly, but theyve hunted you, havent they?His shoulder moved slightly, not quite a shrug.Now and then, he said.Now?I asked.He breathed slowly for a moment or two before answering.Aye, he said.I think so.My fingers moved down to the diagonal slash.It had been a deep cut; old and well healed as the damage was, the line was sharp and clear beneath my fingertips.Do you know who?No.He was quiet for a moment; then his hand closed over my own, where it lay across his stomach.But I maybe ken why.The house was very quiet.With most of the children and grandchildren gone, there were only the far off servants in their quarters behind the kitchen, Ian and Jenny in their room at the far end of the hall, and Young Ian somewhere upstairsall asleep.We could have been alone at the end of the world; both Edinburgh and the smugglers cove seemed very far away.Do ye recall, after the fall of Stirling, not so long before Culloden, when all of a sudden there was gossip from everywhere, about gold being sent from France?From Louis?Yesbut he never sent it.Jamies words summoned up those brief frantic days of Charles Stuarts reckless rise and precipitous fall, when rumor had been the common currency of conversation.There was always gossipabout gold from France, ships from Spain, weapons from Hollandbut nothing came of most of it.Oh, something camethough not from Louisbut no one kent it, then.He told me then of his meeting with the dying Duncan Kerr, and the wanderers whispered words, heard in the inns attic under the watchful eye of an English officer.He was fevered, Duncan, but not crazed wi it.He kent he was dying, and he kent me, too.It was his only chance to tell someone he thought he could trustso he told me.White witches and seals?I repeated.I must say, it sounds like gibberish.But you understood it?Well, not all of it, Jamie admitted.He rolled over to face me, frowning slightly.Ive no notion who the white witch might be.At the first, I thought he meant you, Sassenach, and my heart nearly stopped when he said it.He smiled ruefully, and his hand tightened on mine, clasped between us.I thought all at once that perhaps something had gone wrongmaybe yed not been able to go back to Frank and the place ye came frommaybe yed somehow ended in France, maybe ye were there right thenall kinds o fancies went through my head.I wish it had been true, I whispered.He gave me a lopsided smile, but shook his head.And me in prison?And Brianna would be whatjust ten or so?No, dinna waste your time in regretting, Sassenach.Youre here now, and yell never leave me again.He kissed me gently on the forehead, then resumed his tale.I didna have any idea where the gold had come from, but I kent his telling me where it was, and why it was there.It was Prince Tearlachs, sent for him.And the bit about the silkies He raised his head a little and nodded toward the window, where the rose brier cast its shadows on the glass.Folk said when my mother ran away from Leoch that shed gone to live wi the silkies; only because the maid that saw my father when he took her said as he looked like a great silkie whod shed his skin and come to walk on the land like a man.And he did.Jamie smiled and passed a hand through his own thick hair, remembering.He had hair thick as mine, but a black like jet.It would shine in some lights, as though it was wet, and he moved quick and sleekit, like a seal through the water.He shrugged suddenly, shaking off the recollection of his father.Well, so.When Duncan Kerr said the name Ellen, I kent it was my mother he meantas a sign that he knew my name and my family, kent who I was; that he wasna raving, no matter how it sounded.And knowin that He shrugged again.The Englishman had told me where they found Duncan, near the coast.There are hundreds of bittie isles and rocks all down that coast, but only one place where the silkies live, at the ends of the MacKenzie lands, off Coigach.So you went there?Aye, I did.He sighed deeply, his free hand drifting to the hollow of my waist.I wouldna have done itleft the prison, I meanhad I not still thought it maybe had something to do wi you, Sassenach.Escape had been an enterprise of no great difficulty; prisoners were often taken outside in small gangs, to cut the peats that burned on the prisons hearths, or to cut and haul stone for the ongoing work of repairing the walls.For a man to whom the heather was home, disappearing had been easy.He had risen from his work and turned aside by a hummock of grass, unfastening his breeches as though to relieve himself.The guard had looked politely away, and looking back a moment later, beheld nothing but an empty moor, holding no trace of Jamie Fraser.See, it was little trouble to slip off, but men seldom did, he explained.None of us were from near Ardsmuirand had we been, there was little left for most o the men to gang to.The Duke of Cumberlands men had done their work well.As one contemporary had put it, evaluating the Dukes achievement later, He created a desert and called it peace.This modern approach to diplomacy had left some parts of the Highlands all but deserted; the men killed, imprisoned, or transported, crops and houses burned, the women and children turned out to starve or seek refuge elsewhere as best they might.No, a prisoner escaping from Ardsmuir would have been truly alone, without kin or clan to turn to for succor.Jamie had known there would be little time before the English commander realized where he must be heading and organized a party of pursuit.On the other hand, there were no real roads in this remote part of the kingdom, and a man who knew the country was at a greater advantage on foot than were the pursuing outlanders on horseback.He had made his escape in midafternoon.Taking his bearings by the stars, he had walked through the night, arriving at the coast near dawn the next day.See, I kent the silkies place; its well known amongst the MacKenzies, and Id been there once before, wi Dougal.The tide had been high, and the seals mostly out in the water, hunting crabs and fish among the fronds of floating kelp, but the dark streaks of their droppings and the indolent forms of a few idlers marked the seals three islands, ranged in a line just inside the lip of a small bay, guarded by a clifflike headland.By Jamies interpretation of Duncans instructions, the treasure lay on the third island, the farthest away from the shore.It was nearly a mile out, a long swim even for a strong man, and his own strength was sapped from the hard prison labor and the long walk without food.He had stood on the clifftop, wondering whether this was a wild goose chase, and whether the treasureif there was onewas worth the risk of his life.The rock was all split and broken there; when I came too close to the edge, chunks would fall awa from my feet and plummet down the cliff.I didna see how Id ever reach the water, let alone the seals isle.But then I was minded what Duncan said about Ellens tower, Jamie said.His eyes were open, fixed not on me, but on that distant shore where the crash of falling rock was lost in the smashing of the waves.The tower was there; a small spike of granite that stuck up no more than five feet from the tip of the headland.But below that spike, hidden by the rocks, was a narrow crack, a small chimney that ran from top to bottom of the eighty foot cliff, providing a possible passage, if not an easy one, for a determined man.From the base of Ellens tower to the third island was still over a quarter mile of heaving green water.Undressing, he had crossed himself, and commending his soul to the keeping of his mother, he had dived naked into the waves.He made his way slowly out from the cliff, floundering and choking as the waves broke over his head.No place in Scotland is that far from the sea, but Jamie had been raised inland, his experience of swimming limited to the placid depths of lochs and the pools of trout streams.Blinded by salt and deafened by the roaring surf, he had fought the waves for what seemed hours, then thrust his head and shoulders free, gasping for breath, only to see the headland loomingnot behind, as he had thought, but to his right.The tide was goin out, and I was goin with it, he said wryly.I thought, well, thats it, then, Im gone, for I knew I could never make my way back.I hadna eaten anything in two days, and hadnt much strength left.He ceased swimming then, and simply spread himself on his back, giving himself to the embrace of the sea.Light headed from hunger and effort, he had closed his eyes against the light and searched his mind for the words of the old Celtic prayer against drowning.He paused for a moment then, and was quiet for so long that I wondered whether something was wrong.But at last he drew breath and said shyly, I expect yell think Im daft, Sassenach.I havena told anyone about itnot even Jenny.ButI heard my mother call me, then, right in the middle of praying.He shrugged, uncomfortable.It was maybe only that Id been thinking of her when I left the shore, he said.And yet He fell silent, until I touched his face.What did she say?I asked quietly.She said, Come here to me, Jamiecome to me, laddie!He drew a deep breath and let it out slowly.I could hear her plain as day, but I couldna see anything; there was no one there, not even a silkie.I thought perhaps she was callin me from Heavenand I was so tired I really would not ha minded dying then, but I rolled myself over and struck out toward where Id heard her voice.I thought I would swim ten strokes and then stop again to restor to sink.But on the eighth stroke, the current had taken him.It was just as though someone had picked me up, he said, sounding still surprised at the memory of it.I could feel it under me and all around; the water was a bit warmer than it had been, and it carried me with it.I didna have to do anything but paddle a bit, to keep my head above water.A strong, curling current, eddying between headland and islands, it had taken him to the edge of the third islet, where no more than a few strokes brought him within reach of its rocks.It was a small lump of granite, fissured and creviced like all the ancient rocks of Scotland, and slimed with seaweed and seal droppings to boot, but he crawled on shore with all the thankfulness of a shipwrecked sailor for a land of palm trees and white sand beaches.He fell down upon his face on the rocky shelf and lay there, grateful for breath, half dozing with exhaustion.Then I felt something looming over me, and there was a terrible stink o dead fish, he said.I got up onto my knees at once, and there he wasa great bull seal, all sleek and wet, and his black eyes starin at me, no more than a yard away.Neither fisher nor seaman himself, Jamie had heard enough stories to know that bull seals were dangerous, particularly when threatened by intrusions upon their territory.Looking at the open mouth, with its fine display of sharp, peglike teeth, and the burly rolls of hard fat that girdled the enormous body, he was not disposed to doubt it.He weighed more than twenty stone, Sassenach, he said.If he wasna inclined to rip the flesh off my bones, still he could ha knocked me into the sea wi one swipe, or dragged me under to drown.Obviously he didnt, though, I said dryly.What happened?He laughed.I think I was too mazed from tiredness to do anything sensible, he said.I just looked at him for a moment, and then I said, Its all right; its only me.And what did the seal do?Jamie shrugged slightly.He looked me over for a bit longersilkies dinna blink much, did ye know that?Its verra unnerving to have one look at ye for longthen he gave a sort of a grunt and slid off the rock into the water.Left in sole possession of the tiny islet, Jamie had sat blankly for a time, recovering his strength, and then at last began a methodical search of the crevices.Small as the area was, it took little time to find a deep split in the rock that led down to a wide hollow space, a foot below the rocky surface.Floored with dry sand and located in the center of the island, the hollow would be safe from flooding in all but the worst storms.Well, dont keep me in suspense, I said, poking him in the stomach.Was the French gold there?Well, it was and it wasnt, Sassenach, he answered, neatly sucking in his stomach.Id been expecting gold bullion; thats what the rumor said that Louis would send.And thirty thousand pounds worth of gold bullion would make a good sized hoard.But all there was in the hollow was a box, less than a foot long, and a small leather pouch.The box did have gold in it, thoughand silver, too.Gold and silver indeed.The wooden box had contained two hundred and five coins, gold ones and silver ones, some as sharply cut as though new minted, some with their markings worn nearly to blankness.Ancient coins, Sassenach.Ancient?What, you mean very old  Greek, Sassenach, and Roman.Verra old indeed.We lay staring at each other in the dim light for a moment, not speaking.Thats incredible, I said at last.Its treasure, all right, but not  Not what Louis would send, to help feed an army, no, he finished for me.No, whoever put this treasure there, it wasna Louis or any of his ministers.What about the bag?I said, suddenly remembering.What was in the pouch you found?Stones, Sassenach.Gemstones.Diamonds and pearls and emeralds and sapphires.Not many, but nicely cut and big enough.He smiled, a little grimly.Aye, big enough.He had sat on a rock under the dim gray sky, turning the coins and the jewels over and over between his fingers, stunned into bewilderment.At last, roused by a sensation of being watched, he had looked up to find himself surrounded by a circle of curious seals.The tide was out, the females had come back from their fishing, and twenty pairs of round black eyes surveyed him cautiously.The huge black male, emboldened by the presence of his harem, had come back too.He barked loudly, darting his head threateningly from side to side, and advanced on Jamie, sliding his three hundred pound bulk a few feet closer with each booming exclamation, propelling himself with his flippers across the slick rock.I thought Id best leave, then, he said.Id found what I came to find, after all.So I put the box and the pouch back where Id found themI couldna carry them ashore, after all, and if I didwhat then?So I put them back, and crawled down into the water, half frozen wi cold.A few strokes from the island had taken him again into the current heading landward; it was a circular current, like most eddies, and the gyre had carried him to the foot of the headland within half an hour, where he crawled ashore, dressed, and fell asleep in a nest of marrow grass.He paused then, and I could see that while his eyes were open and fixed on me, it wasnt me they saw.I woke at dawn, he said softly.I have seen a great many dawns, Sassenach, but never one like that one.I could feel the earth turn beneath me, and my own breath coming wi the breathing of the wind.It was as though I had no skin nor bone, but only the light of the rising sun inside me.His eyes softened, as he left the moor and came back to me.So then the sun came up higher, he said, matter of factly.And when it warmed me enough to stand, I got up and went inland toward the road, to meet the English.But why did you go back?I demanded.You were free!You had money!And  And where would I spend such money as that, Sassenach?he asked.Walk into a cottars hearth and offer him a gold denarius, or a wee emerald?He smiled at my indignation and shook his head.Nay, he said gently, I had to go back.Aye, I could ha lived on the moor for a timehalf starved and naked, but I might have managed.But they were hunting me, Sassenach, and hunting hard, for thinking that I might know where the gold was hid.No cot near Ardsmuir would be safe from the English, so long as I was free, and might be thought to seek refuge there.Ive seen the English hunting, ye ken, he added, a harder note creeping into his voice.Yell have seen the panel in the entry hall?I had; one panel of the glowing oak that lined the hall below had been smashed in, perhaps by a heavy boot, and the crisscross scars of saber slashes marred the paneling from door to stairs.We keep it so to remember, he said.To show to the weans, and tell them when they askthis is what the English are.The suppressed hate in his voice struck me low in the pit of the stomach.Knowing what I knew of what the English army had done in the Highlands, there was bloody little I could say in argument.I said nothing, and he continued after a moment.I wouldna expose the folk near Ardsmuir to that kind of attention, Sassenach.At the word Sassenach, his hand squeezed mine and a small smile curved the corner of his mouth.Sassenach I might be to him, but not English.For that matter, he went on, were I not taken, the hunt would likely come here againto Lallybroch.If I would risk the folk near Ardsmuir, I would not risk my own.And even without that He stopped, seeming to struggle to find words.I had to go back, he said slowly.For the sake of the men there, if for nothing else.The men in the prison?I said, surprised.Were some of the Lallybroch men arrested with you?He shook his head.The small vertical line that appeared between his brows when he thought hard was visible, even by starlight.No.There were men there from all over the Highlandsfrom every clan, almost.Only a few men from each clanremnants and ragtag.But the more in need of a chief, for all that.And thats what you were to them?I spoke gently, restraining the urge to smooth the line away with my fingers.For lack of any better, he said, with the flicker of a smile.He had come from the bosom of family and tenants, from a strength that had sustained him for seven years, to find a lack of hope and a loneliness that would kill a man faster than the damp and the filth and the quaking ague of the prison.And so, quite simply, he had taken the ragtag and remnants, the castoff survivors of the field of Culloden, and made them his own, that they and he might survive the stones of Ardsmuir as well.Reasoning, charming, and cajoling where he could, fighting where he must, he had forced them to band together, to face their captors as one, to put aside ancient clan rivalries and allegiances, and take him as their chieftain.They were mine, he said softly.And the having of them kept me alive.But then they had been taken from him and from each otherwrenched apart and sent into indenture in a foreign land.And he had not been able to save them.You did your best for them.But its over now, I said softly.We lay in each others arms in silence for a long time, letting the small noises of the house wash over us.Different from the comfortable commercial bustle of the brothel, the tiny creaks and sighing spoke of quiet, and home, and safety.For the first time, we were truly alone together, removed from danger and distraction.There was time, now.Time to hear the rest of the story of the gold, to hear what he had done with it, to find out what had happened to the men of Ardsmuir, to speculate about the burning of the printshop, Young Ians one eyed seaman, the encounter with His Majestys Customs on the shore by Arbroath, to decide what to do next.And since there was time, there was no need to speak of any of that, now.The last peat broke and fell apart on the hearth, its glowing interior hissing red in the cold.I snuggled closer to Jamie, burying my face in the side of his neck.He tasted faintly of grass and sweat, with a whiff of brandy.He shifted his body in response, bringing us together all down our naked lengths.What, again?I murmured, amused.Men your age arent supposed to do it again so soon.His teeth nibbled gently on my earlobe.Well, youre doing it too, Sassenach, he pointed out.And youre older than I am.Thats different, I said, gasping a little as he moved suddenly over me, his shoulders blotting out the starlit window.Im a woman.And if ye werent a woman, Sassenach, he assured me, settling to his work, I wouldna be doing it either.Hush, now.I woke just past dawn to the scratching of the rose brier against the window, and the muffled thump and clang of breakfast fixing in the kitchen below.Peering over Jamies sleeping form, I saw that the fire was dead out.I slid out of bed, quietly so as not to wake him.The floorboards were icy under my feet and I reached, shivering, for the first available garment.Swathed in the folds of Jamies shirt, I knelt on the hearth and went about the laborious business of rekindling the fire, thinking rather wistfully that I might have included a box of safety matches in the short list of items I had thought worthwhile to bring.Striking sparks from a flint to catch kindling does work, but not usually on the first try.Or the second.Or  Somewhere around the dozenth attempt, I was rewarded by a tiny black spot on the twist of tow I was using for kindling.It grew at once and blossomed into a tiny flame.I thrust it hastily but carefully beneath the little tent of twigs I had prepared, to shelter the blooming flame from the cold breeze.I had left the window ajar the night before, to insure not being suffocated by the smokepeat fires burned hot, but dully, with a lot of smoke, as the blackened beams overhead attested.Just now, though, I thought we could dispense with fresh airat least until I got the fire thoroughly under way.The pane was rimed at the bottom with a light frost; winter was not far off.The air was so crisp and fresh that I paused before shutting the window, breathing in great gulps of dead leaf, dried apples, cold earth, and damp, sweet grass.The scene outside was perfect in its still clarity, stone walls and dark pines drawn sharp as black quillstrokes against the gray overcast of the morning.A movement drew my eye to the top of the hill, where the rough track led to the village of Broch Mordha, ten miles distant.One by one, three small Highland ponies came up over the rise, and started down the hill toward the farmhouse.They were too far away for me to make out the faces, but I could see by the billowing skirts that all three riders were women.Perhaps it was the girlsMaggie, Kitty, and Janetcoming back from Young Jamies house.My own Jamie would be glad to see them.I pulled the shirt, redolent of Jamie, around me against the chill, deciding to take advantage of what privacy might remain to us this morning by thawing out in bed.I shut the window, and paused to lift several of the light peat bricks from the basket by the hearth and feed them carefully to my fledgling fire, before shedding the shirt and crawling under the covers, numb toes tingling with delight at the luxurious warmth.Jamie felt the chill of my return, and rolled instinctively toward me, gathering me neatly in and curling round me spoon fashion.He sleepily rubbed his face against my shoulder.Sleep well, Sassenach?he muttered.Never better, I assured him, snuggling my cold bottom into the warm hollow of his thighs.You?Mmmmm.He responded with a blissful groan, wrapping his arms about me.Dreamed like a fiend.What about?Naked women, mostly, he said, and set his teeth gently in the flesh of my shoulder.That, and food.His stomach rumbled softly.The scent of biscuits and fried bacon in the air was faint but unmistakable.So long as you dont confuse the two, I said, twitching my shoulder out of his reach.I can tell a hawk from a handsaw, when the wind sets north by norwest, he assured me, and a sweet, plump lassie from a salt cured ham, too, appearances notwithstanding.He grabbed my buttocks with both hands and squeezed, making me yelp and kick him in the shins.Beast!Oh, a beast, is it?he said, laughing.Well, then Growling deep in his throat, he dived under the quilt and proceeded to nip and nibble his way up the insides of my thighs, blithely ignoring my squeaks and the hail of kicks on his back and shoulders.Dislodged by our struggles, the quilt slid off onto the floor, revealing the tousled mass of his hair, flying wild over my thighs.Perhaps theres less difference than I thought, he said, his head popping up between my legs as he paused for breath.He pressed my thighs flat against the mattress and grinned up at me, spikes of red hair standing on end like a porcupines quills.Ye do taste a bit salty, come to try it.What do ye  He was interrupted by a sudden bang as the door flew open and rebounded from the wall.Startled, we turned to look.In the doorway stood a young girl I had never seen before.She was perhaps fifteen or sixteen, with long flaxen hair and big blue eyes.The eyes were somewhat bigger than normal, and filled with an expression of horrified shock as she stared at me.Her gaze moved slowly from my tangled hair to my bare breasts, and down the slopes of my naked body, until it encountered Jamie, lying prone between my thighs, white faced with a shock equal to hers.Daddy!she said, in tones of total outrage.Who is that woman?34  DADDY  Daddy?I said blankly.Daddy?Jamie had turned to stone when the door opened.Now he shot bolt upright, snatching at the fallen quilt.He shoved the disheveled hair out of his face, and glared at the girl.What in the name of bloody hell are you doing here?he demanded.Red bearded, naked, and hoarse with fury, he was a formidable sight, and the girl took a step backward, looking uncertain.Then her chin firmed and she glared back at him.I came with Mother!The effect on Jamie could not have been greater had she shot him through the heart.He jerked violently, and all the color went out of his face.It came flooding back, as the sound of rapid footsteps sounded on the wooden staircase.He leapt out of bed, tossing the quilt hastily in my direction, and grabbed his breeks.He had barely pulled them on when another female figure burst into the room, skidded to a halt, and stood staring, bug eyed, at the bed.Its true!She whirled toward Jamie, fists clenched against the cloak she still wore.Its true!Its the Sassenach witch!How could ye do such a thing to me, Jamie Fraser?Be still, Laoghaire!he snapped.Ive done nothing to ye!I sat up against the wall, clutching the quilt to my bosom and staring.It was only when he spoke her name that I recognized her.Twenty odd years ago, Laoghaire MacKenzie had been a slender sixteen year old, with rose petal skin, moonbeam hair, and a violentand unrequitedpassion for Jamie Fraser.Evidently, a few things had changed.She was nearing forty and no longer slender, having thickened considerably.The skin was still fair, but weathered, and stretched plumply over cheeks flushed with anger.Strands of ashy hair straggled out from under her respectable white kertch.The pale blue eyes were the same, thoughthey turned on me again, with the same expression of hatred I had seen in them long ago.Hes mine!she hissed.She stamped her foot.Get ye back to the hell that ye came from, and leave him to me!Go, I say!As I made no move to obey, she glanced wildly about in search of a weapon.Catching sight of the blue banded ewer, she seized it and drew back her arm to fling it at me.Jamie plucked it neatly from her hand, set it back on the bureau, and grasped her by the upper arm, hard enough to make her squeal.He turned her and shoved her roughly toward the door.Get ye downstairs, he ordered.Ill speak wi ye presently, Laoghaire.Youll speak wi me?Speak wi me, is it!she cried.Face contorted, she swung her free hand at him, raking his face from eye to chin with her nails.He grunted, grabbed her other wrist, and dragging her to the door, pushed her out into the passage and slammed the door to and turned the key.By the time he turned around again, I was sitting on the edge of the bed, fumbling with shaking hands as I tried to pull my stockings on.I can explain it to ye, Claire, he said.I d dont think so, I said.My lips were numb, along with the rest of me, and it was hard to form words.I kept my eyes fixed on my feet as I triedand failedto tie my garters.Listen to me!he said violently, bringing his fist down on the table with a crash that made me jump.I jerked my head up, and caught a glimpse of him towering over me.With his red hair tumbled loose about his shoulders, his face unshaven, bare chested, and the raw marks of Laoghaires nails down his cheek, he looked like a Viking raider, bent on mayhem.I turned away to look for my shift.It was lost in the bedclothes; I scrabbled about among the sheets.A considerable pounding had started up on the other side of the door, accompanied by shouts and shrieks, as the commotion attracted the other inhabitants of the house.Youd best go and explain things to your daughter, I said, pulling the crumpled cotton over my head.Shes not my daughter!No?My head popped out of the neck of the shift, and I lifted my chin to stare up at him.And I suppose you arent married to Laoghaire, either?Im married to you, damn it!he bellowed, striking his fist on the table again.I dont think so.I felt very cold.My stiff fingers couldnt manage the lacing of the stays; I threw them aside, and stood up to look for my gown, which was somewhere on the other side of the roombehind Jamie.I need my dress.Youre no going anywhere, Sassenach.Not until  Dont call me that!I shrieked it, surprising both of us.He stared at me for a moment, then nodded.All right, he said quietly.He glanced at the door, now reverberating under the force of the pounding.He drew a deep breath and straightened, squaring his shoulders.Ill go and settle things.Then well talk, the two of us.Stay here, SassClaire.He picked up his shirt and yanked it over his head.Unlocking the door, he stepped out into the suddenly silent corridor and closed it behind him.I managed to pick up the dress, then collapsed on the bed and sat shaking all over, the green wool crumpled across my knees.I couldnt think in a straight line.My mind spun in small circles around the central fact; he was married.Married to Laoghaire!And he had a family.And yet he had wept for Brianna.Oh, Bree!I said aloud.Oh, God, Bree!and began to crypartly from shock, partly at the thought of Brianna.It wasnt logical, but this discovery seemed a betrayal of her, as much as of meor of Laoghaire.The thought of Laoghaire turned shock and sorrow to rage in a moment.I rubbed a fold of green wool savagely across my face, leaving the skin red and prickly.Damn him!How dare he?If he had married again, thinking me dead, that was one thing.I had half expected, half feared it.But to marry that womanthat spiteful, sneaking little bitch who had tried to murder me at Castle Leochbut he likely didnt know that, a small voice of reason in my head pointed out.Well, he should have known!I said.Damn him to hell, how could he take her, anyway?The tears were rolling heedlessly down my face, hot spurts of loss and fury, and my nose was running.I groped for a handkerchief, found none, and in desperation, blew my nose at last on a corner of the sheet.It smelled of Jamie.Worse, it smelled of the two of us, and the faint, musky lingerings of our pleasure.There was a small tingling spot on the inside of my thigh, where Jamie had nipped me, a few minutes before.I brought the flat of my hand down hard on the spot in a vicious slap, to kill the feeling.Liar!I screamed.I grabbed the pitcher Laoghaire had tried to throw at me, and hurled it myself.It crashed against the door in an explosion of splinters.I stood in the middle of the room, listening.It was quiet.There was no sound from below; no one was coming to see what had made the crash.I imagined they were all much too concerned with soothing Laoghaire to worry about me.Did they live here, at Lallybroch?I recalled Jamie, taking Fergus aside, sending him ahead, ostensibly to tell Ian and Jenny we were coming.And, presumably, to warn them about me, and get Laoghaire out of the way before I arrived.What in the name of God did Jenny and Ian think about this?Clearly they must know about Laoghaireand yet they had received me last night, with no sign of it on their faces.But if Laoghaire had been sent awaywhy did she come back?Even trying to think about it made my temples throb.The act of violence had drained enough rage for me to be able once more to control my shaking fingers.I kicked the stays into a corner and pulled the green gown over my head.I had to get out of there.That was the only half coherent thought in my head, and I clung to it.I had to leave.I couldnt stay, not with Laoghaire and her daughters in the house.They belonged thereI didnt.I managed to tie up the garters this time, do up the laces of the dress, fasten the multiple hooks of the overskirt, and find my shoes.One was under the washstand, the other by the massive oak armoire, where I had kicked them the night before, dropping my clothes carelessly anywhere in my eagerness to crawl into the welcoming bed and nestle warmly in Jamies arms.I shivered.The fire had gone out again, and there was an icy draft from the window.I felt chilled to the bone, despite my clothes.I wasted some time in searching for my cloak before realizing that it was downstairs; I had left it in the parlor the day before.I pushed my fingers through my hair, but was too upset to look for a comb.The strands crackled with electricity from having the woolen dress pulled over my head, and I slapped irritably at the floating hairs that stuck to my face.Ready.Ready as Id be, at least.I paused for one last look around, then heard footsteps coming up the stair.Not fast and light, like the last ones.These were heavier, and slow, deliberate.I knew without seeing him that it was Jamie comingand that he wasnt anxious to see me.Fine.I didnt want to see him, either.Better just to leave at once, without speaking.What was there to say?I backed away as the door opened, unaware that I was moving, until my legs hit the edge of the bed.I lost my balance and sat down.Jamie paused in the doorway, looking down at me.He had shaved.That was the first thing I noticed.In echo of Young Ian the day before, he had hastily shaved, brushed his hair back and tidied himself before facing trouble.He seemed to know what I was thinking; the ghost of a smile passed over his face, as he rubbed his freshly scraped chin.Dye think it will help?he asked.I swallowed, and licked dry lips, but didnt answer.He sighed, and answered himself.No, I suppose not.He stepped into the room and closed the door.He stood awkwardly for a moment, then moved toward the bed, one hand extended toward me.Claire  Dont touch me!I leapt to my feet and backed away, circling toward the door.His hand fell to his side, but he stepped in front of me, blocking the way.Will ye no let me explain, Claire?It seems to be a little late for that, I said, in what I meant to be a cold, disdainful tone.Unfortunately, my voice shook.He pushed the door shut behind him.Ye never used to be unreasonable, he said quietly.And dont tell me what I used to be!The tears were much too near the surface, and I bit my lip to hold them back.All right.His face was very pale; the scratches Laoghaire had given him showed as three red lines, livid down his cheek.I dinna live with her, he said.She and the girls live at Balriggan, over near Broch Mordha.He watched me closely, but I said nothing.He shrugged a little, settling the shirt on his shoulders, and went on.It was a great mistakethe marriage between us.With two children?Took you a while to realize, didnt it?I burst out.His lips pressed tight together.The lassies arent mine; Laoghaire was a widow wi the two bairns when I wed her.Oh.It didnt make any real difference, but still, I felt a small wave of something like relief, on Briannas behalf.She was the sole child of Jamies heart, at least, even if I  Ive not lived wi them for some time; I live in Edinburgh, and send money to them, but  You dont need to tell me, I interrupted.It doesnt make any difference.Let me by, pleaseIm going.The thick, ruddy brows drew sharply together.Going where?Back.Away.I dont knowlet me by!You arent going anywhere, he said definitely.You cant stop me!He reached out and grabbed me by both arms.Aye, I can, he said.He could; I jerked furiously, but couldnt budge the iron grip on my biceps.Let go of me this minute!No, I wont!He glared at me, eyes narrowed, and I suddenly realized that calm as he might seem outwardly, he was very nearly as upset as I was.I saw the muscles of his throat move as he swallowed, controlling himself enough to speak again.I willna let ye go until Ive explained to ye, why  What is there to explain?I demanded furiously.You married again!What else is there?The color was rising in his face; the tips of his ears were already red, a sure sign of impending fury.And have you lived a nun for twenty years?he demanded, shaking me slightly.Have ye?No!I flung the word at his face, and he flinched slightly.No, I bloody havent!And I dont think youve been a monk, eitherI never did!Then he began, but I was much too furious to listen anymore.You lied to me, damn you!I never did!The skin was stretched tight over his cheekbones, as it was when he was very angry indeed.You did, you bastard!You know you did!Let go!I kicked him sharply in the shin, hard enough to numb my toes.He exclaimed in pain, but didnt let go.Instead, he squeezed harder, making me yelp.I never said a thing to ye  No, you didnt!But you lied, anyway!You let me think you werent married, that there wasnt anyone, that youthat you I was half sobbing with rage, gasping between words.You should have told me, the minute I came!Why in hell didnt you tell me?His grip on my arms slackened, and I managed to wrench myself free.He took a step toward me, eyes glittering with fury.I wasnt afraid of him; I drew back my fist and hit him in the chest.Why?I shrieked, hitting him again and again and again, the sound of the blows thudding against his chest.Why, why, why!Because I was afraid!He got hold of my wrists and threw me backward, so I fell across the bed.He stood over me, fists clenched, breathing hard.I am a coward, damn you!I couldna tell ye, for fear ye would leave me, and unmanly thing that I am, I thought I couldna bear that!Unmanly?With two wives?Ha!I really thought he would slap me; he raised his arm, but then his open palm clenched into a fist.Am I a man?To want you so badly that nothing else matters?To see you, and know I would sacrifice honor or family or life itself to lie wi you, even though yed left me?You have the filthy, unmitigated, bleeding gall to say such a thing to me?My voice was so high, it came out as a thin and vicious whisper.Youll blame me?He stopped then, chest heaving as he caught his breath.No.No, I canna blame you.He turned aside, blindly.How could it have been your fault?Ye wanted to stay wi me, to die with me.I did, the more fool I, I said.You sent me back, you made me go!And now you want to blame me for going?He turned back to me, eyes dark with desperation.I had to send ye away!I had to, for the bairns sake!His eyes went involuntarily to the hook where his coat hung, the pictures of Brianna in its pocket.He took one deep, quivering breath, and calmed himself with a visible effort.No, he said, much more quietly.I canna regret that, whatever the cost.I would have given my life, for her and for you.If it took my heart and soul, too  He drew a long, quivering breath, mastering the passion that shook him.I canna blame ye for going.You blame me for coming back, though.He shook his head as though to clear it.No, God no!He grabbed my hands tight between his own, the strength of his grip grinding the bones together.Do ye know what it is to live twenty years without a heart?To live half a man, and accustom yourself to living in the bit thats left, filling in the cracks wi what mortar comes handy?Do I know?I echoed.I struggled to loose myself, to little effect.Yes, you bloody bastard, I know that!What did you think, Id gone straight back to Frank and lived happy ever after?I kicked at him as hard as I could.He flinched, but didnt let go.Sometimes I hoped ye did, he said, speaking through clenched teeth.And then sometimes I could see ithim with you, day and night, lyin with ye, taking your body, holding my child!And God, I could kill ye for it!Suddenly, he dropped my hands, whirled, and smashed his fist through the side of the oak armoire.It was an impressive blow; the armoire was a sturdy piece of furniture.It must have bruised his knuckles considerably, but without hesitation, he drove the other fist into the oak boards as well, as though the shining wood were Franks faceor mine.Feel like that about it, do you?I said coldly, as he stepped back, panting.I dont even have to imagine you with LaoghaireIve bloody seen her!I dinna care a fig for Laoghaire, and never have!Bastard!I said again.Youd marry a woman without wanting her, and then throw her aside the minute  Shut up!he roared.Hold your tongue, ye wicked wee bitch!He slammed a fist down on the washstand, glaring at me.Im damned the one way or the other, no?If I felt anything for her, Im a faithless womanizer, and if I didnt, Im a heartless beast.You should have told me!And if I had?He grabbed my hand and jerked me to my feet, holding me eye to eye with him.Youd have turned on your heel and gone without a word.And having seen ye againI tell ye, I would ha done far worse than lie to keep you!He pressed me tight against his body and kissed me, long and hard.My knees turned to water, and I fought to keep my feet, buttressed by the vision of Laoghaires angry eyes, and her voice, echoing shrill in my ears.Hes mine!This is senseless, I said, pulling away.Fury had its own intoxication, but the hangover was setting in fast, a black dizzy vortex.My head swam so that I could hardly keep my balance.I cant think straight.Im leaving.I lurched toward the door, but he caught me by the waist, yanking me back.He whirled me toward himself and kissed me again, hard enough to leave a quicksilver taste of blood in my mouth.It was neither affection nor desire, but a blind passion, a determination to possess me.He was through talking.So was I.  I pulled my mouth away and slapped him hard across the face, fingers curved to rake his flesh.He jerked back, cheek scraped raw, then twisted his fingers tight in my hair, bent and took my mouth again, deliberate and savage, ignoring the kicks and blows I rained on him.He bit my lower lip, hard, and when I opened my lips, gasping, thrust his tongue into my mouth, stealing breath and words together.He threw me bodily onto the bed where we had lain laughing an hour before, and pinned me there at once with the weight of his body.He was most mightily roused.So was I.   Mine, he said, without uttering a word.Mine!I fought him with boundless fury and no little skill, and Yours, my body echoed back.Yours, and may you be damned for it!I didnt feel him rip my gown, but I felt the heat of his body on my bare breasts, through the thin linen of his shirt, the long, hard muscle of his thigh straining against my own.He took his hand off my arm to tear at his breeches, and I clawed him from ear to breast, striping his skin with pale red.We were doing our level best to kill each other, fueled by the rage of years apartmine for his sending me away, his for my going, mine for Laoghaire, his for Frank.Bitch!he panted.Whore!Damn you!I got a hand in his own long hair, and yanked, pulling his face down to me again.We rolled off the bed and landed on the floor in a tangled heap, rolling to and fro in a welter of half uttered curses and broken words.I didnt hear the door open.I didnt hear anything, though she must have called out, more than once.Blind and deaf, I knew nothing but Jamie until the shower of cold water struck us, sudden as an electric shock.Jamie froze.All the color left his face, leaving the bones jutting stark beneath the skin.I lay dazed, drops of water dripping from the ends of his hair onto my breasts.Just behind him, I could see Jenny, her face as white as his, holding an empty pan in her hands.Stop it!she said.Her eyes were slanted with a horrified anger.How could ye, Jamie?Rutting like a wild beast, and not carin if all the house hears ye!He moved off me, slowly, clumsy as a bear.Jenny snatched a quilt from the bed and flung it over my body.On all fours, he shook his head like a dog, sending droplets of water flying.Then, very slowly, he got to his feet, and pulled his ripped breeches back into place.Are ye no ashamed?she cried, scandalized.Jamie stood looking down at her as though he had never seen any creature quite like her, and was making up his mind what she might be.The wet ends of his hair dripped over his bare chest.Yes, he said at last, quite mildly.I am.He seemed dazed.He closed his eyes and a brief, deep shudder went over him.Without a word, he turned and went out.35  FLIGHT FROM EDEN  Jenny helped me to the bed, making small clucking noises; whether of shock or concern, I couldnt tell.I was vaguely conscious of hovering figures in the doorwayservants, I supposedbut wasnt disposed to pay much attention.Ill find ye something to put on, she murmured, fluffing a pillow and pushing me back onto it.And perhaps a bit of a drink.Youre all right?Wheres Jamie?She glanced at me quickly, sympathy mixed with a gleam of curiosity.Dinna be afraid; Ill no let him at ye again.She spoke firmly, then pressed her lips tight together, frowning as she tucked the quilt around me.How he could do such a thing!It wasnt his faultnot this.I ran a hand through my tangled hair, indicating my general dishevelment.I meanI did it, as much as he did.It was both of us.HeI I let my hand fall, helpless to explain.I was bruised and shaken, and my lips were swollen.I see, was all Jenny said, but she gave me a long, assessing look, and I thought it quite possible that she did see.I didnt want to talk about the recent happenings, and she seemed to sense this, for she kept quiet for a bit, giving a soft voiced order to someone in the hall, then moving about the room, straightening furniture and tidying things.I saw her pause for a moment as she saw the holes in the armoire, then she stooped to pick up the larger pieces of the shattered ewer.As she dumped them into the basin, there was a faint thud from the house below; the slam of the big main door.She stepped to the window and pushed the curtain aside.Its Jamie, she said.She glanced at me, and let the curtain fall.Hell be going up to the hill; he goes there, if hes troubled.That, or he gets drunk wi Ian.The hills better.I gave a small snort.Yes, I expect hes troubled, all right.There was a light step in the hallway, and the younger Janet appeared, carefully balancing a tray of biscuits, whisky, and water.She looked pale and scared.Are yewell, Aunt?she asked tentatively, setting down the tray.Im fine, I assured her, pushing myself upright and reaching for the whisky decanter.A sharp glance having assured Jenny of the same, she patted her daughters arm and turned toward the door.Stay wi your auntie, she ordered.Ill go and find a dress.Janet nodded obediently, and sat down by the bed on a stool, watching me as I ate and drank.I began to feel physically much stronger with a little food inside me.Internally, I felt quite numb; the recent events seemed at once dreamlike and yet completely clear in my mind.I could recall the smallest details; the blue calico bows on the dress of Laoghaires daughter, the tiny broken veins in Laoghaires cheeks, a rough torn fingernail on Jamies fourth finger.Do you know where Laoghaire is?I asked Janet.The girl had her head down, apparently studying her own hands.At my question, she jerked upright, blinking.Oh!she said.Oh.Aye, she and Marsali and Joan went back to Balriggan, where they live.Uncle Jamie made them go.Did he, I said flatly.Janet bit her lip, twisting her hands in her apron.Suddenly she looked up at me.AuntIm so awfully sorry!Her eyes were a warm brown, like her fathers, but swimming now with tears.Its all right, I said, having no idea what she meant, but trying to be soothing.But it was me!she burst out.She looked thoroughly miserable, but determined to confess.II told Laoghaire ye were here.Thats why she came.Oh.Well, that explained that, I supposed.I finished the whisky and set the glass carefully back on the tray.I didna thinkI mean, I didna have it in mind to cause a kebbie lebbie, truly not.I didna ken that youthat she  Its all right, I said again.One of us would have found out sooner or later.It made no difference, but I glanced at her with some curiosity.Why did you tell her, though?The girl glanced cautiously over her shoulder, hearing steps start up from below.She leaned close to me.Mother told me to, she whispered.And with that, she rose and hastily left the room, brushing past her mother in the doorway.I didnt ask.Jenny had found a dress for meone of the elder girlsand there was no conversation beyond the necessary as she helped me into it.When I was dressed and shod, my hair combed and put up, I turned to her.I want to go, I said.Now.She didnt argue, but only looked me over, to see that I was strong enough.She nodded then, dark lashes covering the slanted blue eyes so like her brothers.I think thats best, she said quietly.It was late morning when I left Lallybroch for what I knew would be the last time.I had a dagger at my waist, for protection, though it was unlikely I would need it.My horses saddlebags held food and several bottles of ale; enough to see me back to the stone circle.I had thought of taking back the pictures of Brianna from Jamies coat, but after a moments hesitation, had left them.She belonged to him forever, even if I didnt.It was a cold autumn day, the mornings gray promise fulfilled with a mourning drizzle.No one was in sight near the house, as Jenny led the horse out of the stable, and held the bridle for me to mount.I pulled the hood of my cloak farther forward, and nodded to her.Last time, we had parted with tears and embraces, as sisters.She let go the reins, and stood back, as I turned the horses head toward the road.Godspeed!I heard her call behind me.I didnt answer, nor did I look back.I rode most of the day, without really noticing where I was going; taking heed only for the general direction, and letting the gelding pick his own way through the mountain passes.I stopped when the light began to go; hobbled the horse to graze, lay down wrapped in my cloak, and dropped straight asleep, unwilling to stay awake for fear I might think, and remember.Numbness was my only refuge.I knew it would go, but I clung to its gray comfort so long as I might.It was hunger that brought me unwillingly back to life the next day.I had not paused to eat through all the day before, nor when rising in the morning, but by noon my stomach had begun to register loud protests, and I stopped in a small glen beside a sparkling burn, and unwrapped the food that Jenny had slipped into my saddlebag.There were oatcakes and ale, and several small loaves of fresh baked bread, slit down the middle, stuffed with sheepmilk cheese and homemade pickle.Highland sandwiches, the hearty fare of shepherds and warriors, as characteristic of Lallybroch as peanut butter had been of Boston.Very suitable, that my quest should end with one of these.I ate a sandwich, drank one of the stone bottles of ale, and swung back into the saddle, turning the horses head to the northeast once more.Unfortunately, while the food had brought fresh strength to my body, it had given fresh life to my feelings as well.As we climbed higher and higher into the clouds, my spirits fell lowerand they hadnt been high to begin with.The horse was willing enough, but I wasnt.Near midafternoon, I felt that I simply couldnt go on.Leading the horse far enough into a small thicket that it wouldnt be noticeable from the road, I hobbled it loosely, and walked farther under the trees myself, til I came to the trunk of a fallen aspen, smooth skinned, stained green with moss.I sat slumped over, elbows on my knees and head on my hands.I ached in every joint.Not really from the encounter of the day before, or from the rigors of riding; from grief.Constraint and judgment had been a great deal of my life.I had learned at some pains the art of healing; to give and to care, but always stopping short of that danger point where too much was given to make me effective.I had learned detachment and disengagement, to my cost.With Frank, too, I had learned the balancing act of civility; kindness and respect that did not pass those unseen boundaries into passion.And Brianna?Love for a child cannot be free; from the first signs of movement in the womb, a devotion springs up as powerful as it is mindless, irresistible as the process of birth itself.But powerful as it is, it is a love always of control; one is in charge, the protector, the watcher, the guardianthere is great passion in it, to be sure, but never abandon.Always, always, I had had to balance compassion with wisdom, love with judgment, humanity with ruthlessness.Only with Jamie had I given everything I had, risked it all.I had thrown away caution and judgment and wisdom, along with the comforts and constraints of a hard won career.I had brought him nothing but myself, been nothing but myself with him, given him soul as well as body, let him see me naked, trusted him to see me whole and cherish my frailtiesbecause he once had.I had feared he couldnt, again.Or wouldnt.And then had known those few days of perfect joy, thinking that what had once been true was true once more; I was free to love him, with everything I had and was, and be loved with an honesty that matched my own.The tears slid hot and wet between my fingers.I mourned for Jamie, and for what I had been, with him.Do you know, his voice said, whispering, what it means, to say again I love you, and to mean it?I knew.And with my head in my hands beneath the pine trees, I knew I would never mean it again.Sunk as I was in miserable contemplation, I didnt hear the footsteps until he was nearly upon me.Startled by the crack of a branch nearby, I rocketed off the fallen tree like a rising pheasant and whirled to face the attacker, heart in my mouth and dagger in hand.Christ!My stalker shied back from the open blade, clearly as startled as I was.What the hell are you doing here?I demanded.I pressed my free hand to my chest.My heart was pounding like a kettledrum and I was sure I was as white as he was.Jesus, Auntie Claire!Whered ye learn to pull a knife like that?Ye scairt hell out of me.Young Ian passed a hand over his brow, Adams apple bobbing as he swallowed.The feeling is mutual, I assured him.I tried to sheathe the dagger, but my hand was shaking too much with reaction to manage it.Knees wobbling, I sank back on the aspen trunk and laid the knife on my thigh.I repeat, I said, trying to gain mastery of myself, what are you doing here?I had a bloody good idea what he was doing there, and I wasnt having any.On the other hand, I needed a moments recovery from the fright before I could reliably stand up.Young Ian bit his lip, glanced around, and at my nod of permission, sat down awkwardly on the trunk beside me.Uncle Jamie sent me he began.I didnt pause to hear more, but got up at once, knees or no knees, thrusting the dagger into my belt as I turned away.Wait, Aunt!Please!He grabbed at my arm, but I jerked loose, pulling away from him.Im not interested, I said, kicking the fronds of bracken aside.Go home, wee Ian.Ive places to go.I hoped I had, at least.But it isnt what you think!Unable to stop me leaving the clearing, he was following me, arguing as he ducked low branches.He needs you, Aunt, really he does!Ye must come back wi me!I didnt answer him; I had reached my horse, and bent to undo the hobbles.Auntie Claire!Will ye no listen to me?He loomed up on the far side of the horse, gawky height peering at me over the saddle.He looked very much like his father, his good natured, half homely face creased with anxiety.No, I said briefly.I stuffed the hobbles into the saddlebag, and put my foot into the stirrup, swinging up with a satisfyingly majestic swish of skirts and petticoats.My dignified departure was hampered at this point by the fact that Young Ian had the horses reins in a death grip.Let go, I said peremptorily.Not until ye hear me out, he said.He glared up at me, jaw clenched with stubbornness, soft brown eyes ablaze.I glared back at him.Gangling as he was, he had Ians skinny muscularity; unless I was prepared to ride him down, there seemed little choice but to listen to him.All right, I decided.Fat lot of good it would do, to him or his double dealing uncle, but Id listen.Talk, I said, mustering what patience I could.He drew a deep breath, eyeing me warily to see whether I meant it.Deciding that I did, he blew his breath out, making the soft brown hair over his brow flutter, and squared his shoulders to begin.Well, he started, seeming suddenly unsure.ItIhe  I made a low sound of exasperation in my throat.Start at the beginning, I said.But dont make a song and dance of it, hm?He nodded, teeth set in his upper lip as he concentrated.Well, there was the hell of a stramash broke out at the house, after ye left, when Uncle Jamie came back, he began.Ill just bet there was, I said.Despite myself, I was conscious of a small stirring of curiosity, but fought it down, assuming an expression of complete indifference.Ive never seen Uncle Jamie sae furious, he said, watching my face carefully.Nor Mother, either.They went at it hammer and tongs, the two o them.Father tried to quiet them, but it was like they didna even hear him.Uncle Jamie called Mother a meddling besom, and a lang nebbitandand a lot of worse names, he added, flushing.He shouldnt have been angry with Jenny, I said.She was only trying to helpI think.I felt sick with the knowledge that I had caused this rift, too.Jenny had been Jamies mainstay since the death of their mother when both were children.Was there no end to the damage I had caused by coming back?To my surprise, Jennys son smiled briefly.Well, it wasna all one sided, he said dryly.My mothers no the person to be taking abuse lying down, ye ken.Uncle Jamie had a few toothmarks on him before the end of it.He swallowed, remembering.In fact, I thought theyd damage each other, surely; Mother went for Uncle Jamie wi an iron girdle, and he snatched it from her and threw it through the kitchen window.Scairt the chickens out o the yard, he added, with a feeble grin.Less about chickens, Young Ian, I said, looking down at him coldly.Get on with it; I want to leave.Well, then Uncle Jamie knocked over the bookshelf in the parlorI dinna think he did it on purpose, the lad added hastily, he was just too fashed to see straightand went out the door.Father stuck his head out the window and shouted at him where was he going, and he said he was going to find you.Then why are you here, and not him?I was leaning forward slightly, watching his hand on the reins; if his fingers showed signs of relaxation, perhaps I could twitch the rein out of his grasp.Young Ian sighed.Well, just as Uncle Jamie was setting out on his horse, AunterI mean his wi He blushed miserably.Laoghaire.Sheshe came down the hill and into the dooryard.At this point, I gave up pretending indifference.And what happened then?He frowned.There was an awful collieshangie, but I couldna hear much.AuntieI mean Laoghaireshe doesna seem to know how to fight properly, like my Mam and Uncle Jamie.She just weeps and wails a lot.Mam says she snivels, he added.Mmphm, I said.And so?Laoghaire had slid off her own mount, clutched Jamie by the leg, and more or less dragged him off as well, according to Young Ian.She had then subsided into a puddle in the dooryard, clutching Jamie about the knees, weeping and wailing as was her usual habit.Unable to escape, Jamie had at last hauled Laoghaire to her feet, flung her bodily over his shoulder, and carried her into the house and up the stairs, ignoring the fascinated gazes of his family and servants.Right, I said.I realized that I had been clenching my jaw, and consciously unclenched it.So he sent you after me because he was too occupied with his wife.Bastard!The gall of him!He thinks he can just send someone to fetch me back, like a hired girl, because it doesnt suit his convenience to come himself?He thinks he can have his cake and eat it, does he?Bloody arrogant, selfish, overbearingScot!Distracted as I was by the picture of Jamie carrying Laoghaire upstairs, Scot was the worst epithet I could come up with on short notice.My knuckles were white where my hand clutched the edge of the saddle.Not caring about subtlety any more, I leaned down, snatching for the reins.Let go!But Auntie Claire, its not that!Whats not that?Caught by his tone of desperation, I glanced up.His long, narrow face was tight with the anguished need to make me understand.Uncle Jamie didna stay to tend Laoghaire!Then why did he send you?He took a deep breath, renewing his grip on my reins.She shot him.He sent me to find ye, because hes dying.If youre lying to me, Ian Murray, I said, for the dozenth time, youll regret it to the end of your lifewhich will be short!I had to raise my voice to be heard.The rising wind came whooshing past me, lifting my hair in streamers off my shoulders, whipping my skirts tight around my legs.The weather was suitably dramatic; great black clouds choked the mountain passes, boiling over the crags like seafoam, with a faint distant rumble of thunder, like far off surf on packed sand.Lacking breath, Young Ian merely shook his bowed head as he leaned into the wind.He was afoot, leading both ponies across a treacherously boggy stretch of ground near the edge of a tiny loch.I glanced instinctively at my wrist, missing my Rolex.It was difficult to tell where the sun was, with the in rolling storm filling half the western sky, but the upper edge of the dark tinged clouds glowed a brilliant white that was almost gold.I had lost the knack of telling time by sun and sky, but thought it was no more than midafternoon.Lallybroch lay several hours ahead; I doubted we would reach it by dark.Meaching my way reluctantly toward Craigh na Dun, I had taken nearly two days to reach the small wood where Young Ian had caught up with me.He had, he said, spent only one day in the pursuit; he had known roughly where I was headed, and he himself had shod the pony I rode; my tracks had been plain to him, where they showed in the mud patches among the heather on the open moor.Two days since I had left, and oneor moreon the journey back.Three days, then, since Jamie had been shot.I could get few useful details from Young Ian; having succeeded in his mission, he wanted only to return to Lallybroch as fast as possible, and saw no point in further conversation.Jamies gunshot wound was in the left arm, he said.That was good, so far as it went.The ball had penetrated into Jamies side, as well.That wasnt good.Jamie was conscious when last seenthat was goodbut was starting a fever.Not good at all.As to the possible effects of shock, the type or severity of the fever, or what treatment had so far been administered, Young Ian merely shrugged.So perhaps Jamie was dying; perhaps he wasnt.It wasnt a chance I could take, as Jamie himself would know perfectly well.I wondered momentarily whether he might conceivably have shot himself, as a means of forcing me to return.Our last interview could have left him in little doubt as to my response had he come after me, or used force to make me return.It was beginning to rain, in soft spatters that caught in my hair and lashes, blurring my sight like tears.Past the boggy spot, Young Ian had mounted again, leading the way upward to the final pass that led to Lallybroch.Jamie was devious enough to have thought of such a plan, all right, and certainly courageous enough to have carried it out.On the other hand, I had never known him to be reckless.He had taken plenty of bold risksmarrying me being one of them, I thought ruefullybut never without an estimation of the cost, and a willingness to pay it.Would he have thought drawing me back to Lallybroch worth the chance of actually dying?That hardly seemed logical, and Jamie Fraser was a very logical man.I pulled the hood of my cloak further over my head, to keep the increasing downpour out of my face.Young Ians shoulders and thighs were dark with wet, and the rain dripped from the brim of his slouch hat, but he sat straight in the saddle, ignoring the weather with the stoic nonchalance of a trueborn Scot.Very well.Given that Jamie likely hadnt shot himself, was he shot at all?He might have made up the story, and sent his nephew to tell it.On consideration, though, I thought it highly unlikely that Young Ian could have delivered the news so convincingly, were it false.I shrugged, the movement sending a cold rivulet down inside the front of my cloak, and set myself to wait with what patience I could for the journey to be ended.Years in the practice of medicine had taught me not to anticipate; the reality of each case was bound to be unique, and so must be my response to it.My emotions, however, were much harder to control than my professional reactions.Each time I had left Lallybroch, I had thought I would never return.Now here I was, going back once more.Twice now, I had left Jamie, knowing with certainty that I would never see him again.And yet here I was, going back to him like a bloody homing pigeon to its loft.Ill tell you one thing, Jamie Fraser, I muttered under my breath.If you arent at deaths door when I get there, youll live to regret it!36  PRACTICAL AND APPLIED WITCHCRAFT  It was several hours past dark when we arrived at last, soaked to the skin.The house was silent, and dark, save for two dimly lighted windows downstairs in the parlor.There was a single warning bark from one of the dogs, but Young Ian shushed the animal, and after a quick, curious nosing at my stirrup, the black and white shape faded back into the darkness of the dooryard.The warning had been enough to alert someone; as Young Ian led me into the hall, the door to the parlor opened.Jenny poked her head out, her face drawn with worry.At the sight of Young Ian, she popped out into the hallway, her expression transformed to one of joyous relief, at once superseded by the righteous anger of a mother confronted by an errant offspring.Ian, ye wee wretch!she said.Where have ye been all this time?Your Da and I ha been worrit sick for ye!She paused long enough to look him over anxiously.Youre all right?At his nod, her lips grew tight again.Aye, well.Youre for it now, laddie, Ill tell ye!And just where the devil have ye been, anyway?Gangling, knob jointed, and dripping wet, Young Ian looked like nothing so much as a drowned scarecrow, but he was still large enough to block me from his mothers view.He didnt answer Jennys scolding, but shrugged awkwardly and stepped aside, exposing me to his mothers startled gaze.If my resurrection from the dead had disconcerted her, this second reappearance stunned her.Her deep blue eyes, normally as slanted as her brothers, opened so wide, they looked round.She stared at me for a long moment, without saying anything, then her gaze swiveled once more to her son.A cuckoo, she said, almost conversationally.Thats what ye are, laddiea great cuckoo in the nest.God knows whose son ye were meant to be; it wasna mine.Young Ian flushed hotly, dropping his eyes as the red burned in his cheeks.He pushed the feathery damp hair out of his eyes with the back of one hand.Iwell, I just he began, eyes on his boots, I couldna just  Oh, never mind about it now!his mother snapped.Get ye upstairs to your bed; your Da will deal wi ye in the morning.Ian glanced helplessly at the parlor door, then at me.He shrugged once more, looked at the sodden hat in his hands as though wondering how it had got there, and shuffled slowly down the hall.Jenny stood quite still, eyes fixed on me, until the padded door at the end of the hallway closed with a soft thump behind Young Ian.Her face showed lines of strain, and the shadows of sleeplessness smudged her eyes.Still fineboned and erect, for once she looked her age, and more.So youre back, she said flatly.Seeing no point in answering the obvious, I nodded briefly.The house was quiet around us, and full of shadows, the hallway lighted only by a three pronged candlestick set on the table.Never mind about it now, I said, softly, so as not to disturb the houses slumber.There was, after all, only one thing of importance at the moment.Wheres Jamie?After a small hesitation, she nodded as well, accepting my presence for the moment.In there, she said, waving toward the parlor door.I started toward the door, then paused.There was the one thing more.Wheres Laoghaire?I asked.Gone, she said.Her eyes were flat and dark in the candlelight, unreadable.I nodded in response, and stepped through the door, closing it gently but firmly behind me.Too long to be laid on the sofa, Jamie lay on a camp bed set up before the fire.Asleep or unconscious, his profile rose dark and sharp edged against the light of the glowing coals, unmoving.Whatever he was, he wasnt deadat least not yet.My eyes growing accustomed to the dim light of the fire, I could see the slow rise and fall of his chest beneath nightshirt and quilt.A flask of water and a brandy bottle sat on the small table by the bed.The padded chair by the fire had a shawl thrown over its back; Jenny had been sitting there, watching over her brother.There seemed no need now for haste.I untied the strings at the neck of my cloak, and spread the soggy garment over the chairback, taking the shawl in substitute.My hands were cold; I put them under my arms, hugging myself, to bring them to something like a normal temperature before I touched him.When I did venture to place a thawed hand on his forehead, I nearly jerked it back.He was hot as a just fired pistol, and he twitched and moaned at my touch.Fever, indeed.I stood looking down at him for a moment, then carefully moved to the side of the bed and sat down in Jennys chair.I didnt think he would sleep long, with a temperature like that, and it seemed a shame to wake him needlessly soon, merely to examine him.The cloak behind me dripped water on the floor, a slow, arrhythmic patting.It reminded me unpleasantly of an old Highland superstitionthe death drop.Just before a death occurs, the story goes, the sound of water dripping is heard in the house, by those sensitive to such things.I wasnt, thank heaven, subject to noticing supernatural phenomena of that sort.No, I thought wryly, it takes something like a crack through time to get your attention.The thought made me smile, if only briefly, and dispelled the frisson I had felt at the thought of the death drop.As the rain chill left me, though, I still felt uneasy, and for obvious reasons.It wasnt that long ago that I had stood by another makeshift bed, deep in the night watches, and contemplated death, and the waste of a marriage.The thoughts I had begun in the wood hadnt stopped on the hasty journey back to Lallybroch, and they continued now, without my conscious volition.Honor had led Frank to his decisionto keep me as his wife, and raise Brianna as his own.Honor, and an unwillingness to decline a responsibility he felt was his.Well, here before me lay another honorable man.Laoghaire and her daughters, Jenny and her family, the Scots prisoners, the smugglers, Mr.Willoughby and Geordie, Fergus and the tenantshow many other responsibilities had Jamie shouldered, through our years apart?Franks death had absolved me of one of my own obligations; Brianna herself of another.The Hospital Board, in their eternal wisdom, had severed the single great remaining tie that bound me to that life.I had had time, with Joe Abernathys help, to relieve myself of the smaller responsibilities, to depute and delegate, divest and resolve.Jamie had had neither warning nor choice about my reappearance in his life; no time to make decisions or resolve conflicts.And he was not one to abandon his responsibilities, even for the sake of love.Yes, hed lied to me.Hadnt trusted me to recognize his responsibilities, to stand by himor to leave himas his circumstances demanded.Hed been afraid.So had I; afraid that he wouldnt choose me, confronted with the struggle between a twenty year old love and a present day family.So Id run away.Who you jiving, L. J. ?I heard Joe Abernathys voice say, derisive and affectionate.I had fled toward Craigh na Dun with all the speed and decision of a condemned felon approaching the steps of the gallows.Nothing had slowed my journey but the hope that Jamie would come after me.True, the pangs of conscience and wounded pride had spurred me on, but the one moment when Young Ian had said, Hes dying, had shown those up for the flimsy things they were.My marriage to Jamie had been for me like the turning of a great key, each small turn setting in play the intricate fall of tumblers within me.Bree had been able to turn that key as well, edging closer to the unlocking of the door of myself.But the final turn of the lock was frozenuntil I had walked into the printshop in Edinburgh, and the mechanism had sprung free with a final, decisive click.The door now was ajar, the light of an unknown future shining through its crack.But it would take more strength than I had alone to push it open.I watched the rise and fall of his breath, and the play of light and shadow on the strong, clean lines of his face, and knew that nothing truly mattered between us but the fact that we both still lived.So here I was.Again.And whatever the cost of it might be to him or me, here I stayed.I didnt realize that his eyes had opened until he spoke.Ye came back, then, he said softly.I knew ye would.I opened my mouth to reply, but he was still talking, eyes fixed on my face, pupils dilated to pools of darkness.My love, he said, almost whispering.God, ye do look so lovely, wi your great eyes all gold, and your hair so soft round your face.He brushed his tongue across dry lips.I knew ye must forgive me, Sassenach, once ye knew.Once I knew?My brows shot up, but I didnt speak; he had more to say.I was so afraid to lose ye again, mo chridhe, he murmured.So afraid.I havena loved anyone but you, my Sassenach, never since the day I saw yebut I couldnaI couldna bear His voice drifted off in an unintelligible mumble, and his eyes closed again, lashes lying dark against the high curve of his cheek.I sat still, wondering what I should do.As I watched, his eyes opened suddenly once again.Heavy and drowsy with fever, they sought my face.It willna be long, Sassenach, he said, as though reassuring me.One corner of his mouth twitched in an attempt at a smile.Not long.Then I shall touch ye once more.I do long to touch you.Oh, Jamie, I said.Moved by tenderness, I reached out and laid my hand along his burning cheek.His eyes snapped wide with shock, and he jerked bolt upright in bed, letting out a bloodcurdling yell of anguish as the movement jarred his wounded arm.Oh God, oh Christ, oh Jesus Lord God Almighty!he said, bent half breathless and clutching at his left arm.Youre real!Bloody stinking filthy pig swiving hell!Oh, Christ!Are you all right?I said, rather inanely.I could hear startled exclamations from the floor above, muffled by the thick planks, and the thump of feet as one after another of Lallybrochs inhabitants leapt from their beds to investigate the uproar.Jennys head, eyes even wider than before, poked through the parlor door.Jamie saw her, and somehow found sufficient breath to roar Get out!before doubling up again with an agonized groan.Je sus, he said between clenched teeth.What in Gods holy name are ye doing here, Sassenach?What do you mean, what am I doing here?I said.You sent for me.And what do you mean, Im real?He unclenched his jaw and tentatively loosened his grip on his left arm.The resultant sensation proving unsatisfactory, he promptly grabbed it again and said several things in French involving the reproductive organs of assorted saints and animals.For Gods sake, lie down!I said.I took him by the shoulders and eased him back onto the pillows, noting with some alarm how close his bones were to the surface of his heated skin.I thought ye were a fever dream, til you touched me, he said, gasping.What the hell dye mean, popping up by my bed and scarin me to death?He grimaced in pain.Christ, it feels like my damn arms come off at the shoulder.Och, bugger it!he exclaimed, as I firmly detached the fingers of his right hand from his left arm.Didnt you send Young Ian to tell me you were dying?I said, deftly rolling back the sleeve of his nightshirt.The arm was wound in a huge bandage above the elbow, and I groped for the end of the linen strip.Me?No!Ow, that hurts!Itll hurt worse before Im through with you, I said, carefully unwrapping.You mean the little bastard came after me on his own?You didnt want me to come back?Want ye back?No!Want ye to come back to me for nothing but pity, the same as ye might show for a dog in a ditch?Bloody hell!No!I forbade the little bugger to go after ye!He scowled furiously at me, ruddy brows knitting together.Im a doctor, I said coldly, not a veterinarian.And if you didnt want me back, what was all that you were saying before you realized I was real, hm?Bite the blanket or something; the ends stuck, and Im going to pull it loose.He bit his lip instead, and made no noise but a swift intake of air through his nose.It was impossible to judge his color in the firelight, but his eyes closed briefly, and small beads of sweat popped out on his forehead.I turned away for a moment, groping in the drawer of Jennys desk where the extra candles were kept.I needed more light before I did anything.I suppose Young Ian told me you were dying just to get me back here.He must have thought I wouldnt come otherwise.The candles were there; fine beeswax, from the Lallybroch hives.For what its worth, I am dying.His voice came from behind me, dry and blunt, despite his breathlessness.I turned back to him in some surprise.His eyes rested on my face quite calmly, now that the pain in his arm had lessened a bit, but his breath was still coming unevenly, and his eyes were heavy and bright with fever.I didnt respond at once, but lit the candles I had found, placing them in the big candelabra that usually decorated the sideboard, unused save for great occasions.The flames of five additional candles brightened the room as though in preparation for a party.I bent over the bed, noncommital.Lets have a look at it.The wound itself was a ragged dark hole, scabbed at the edges and faintly blue tinged.I pressed the flesh on either side of the wound; it was red and angry looking, and there was a considerable seepage of pus.Jamie stirred uneasily as I drew my fingertips gently but firmly down the length of the muscle.You have the makings of a very fine little infection there, my lad, I said.Young Ian said it went into your side; a second shot, or did it go through your arm?It went through.Jenny dug the ball out of my side.That wasna so bad, though.Just an inch or so in.He spoke in brief spurts, lips tightening involuntarily between sentences.Let me see where it went through.Moving very slowly, he turned his hand to the outside, letting the arm fall away from his side.I could see that even that small movement was intensely painful.The exit wound was just above the elbow joint, on the inside of the upper arm.Not directly opposite the entrance wound, though; the ball had been deflected in its passage.Hit the bone, I said, trying not to imagine what that must have felt like.Do you know if the bones broken?I dont want to poke you more than I need to.Thanks for small mercies, he said, with an attempt at a smile.The muscles of his face trembled, though, and went slack with exhaustion.No, I think its not broken, he said.Ive broken my collarbone and my hand before, and its not like that, though it hurts a bit.I expect it does.I felt my way carefully up the swell of his biceps, testing for tenderness.How far up does the pain go?He glanced at his wounded arm, almost casually.Feels like Ive a hot poker in my arm, not a bone.But its no just the arm pains me now; my whole sides gone stiff and sore.He swallowed, licking his lips again.Will ye give me a taste of the brandy?he asked.It hurts to feel my heart beating, he added apologetically.Without comment, I poured a cup of water from the flask on the table, and held it to his lips.He raised one brow, but drank thirstily, then let his head fall back against the pillow.He breathed deeply for a moment, eyes closed, then opened them and looked directly at me.Ive had two fevers in my life that near killed me, he said.I think this one likely will.I wouldna send for ye, butIm glad youre here.He swallowed once, then went on.Iwanted to say to ye that Im sorry.And to bid ye a proper farewell.I wouldna ask ye to stay til the end, butwould yewould ye stay wi mejust for a bit?His right hand was pressed flat against the mattress, steadying him.I could see that he was fighting hard to keep any note of pleading from his voice or eyes, to make it a simple request, one that could be refused.I sat down on the bed beside him, careful not to jar him.The firelight glowed on one side of his face, sparking the red gold stubble of his beard, picking up the small flickers of silver here and there, leaving the other side masked in shadow.He met my eyes, not blinking.I hoped the yearning that showed in his face was not quite so apparent on my own.I reached out and ran a hand gently down the side of his face, feeling the soft scratchiness of beard stubble.Ill stay for a bit, I said.But youre not going to die.He raised one eyebrow.You brought me through one bad fever, using what I still think was witchcraft.And Jenny got me through the next, wi naught but plain stubbornness.I suppose wi the both of ye here, ye might just manage it, but Im no at all sure I want to go through such an ordeal again.I think Id rather just die and ha done with it, if its all the same to you.Ingrate, I said.Coward.Torn between exasperation and tenderness, I patted his cheek and stood up, groping in the deep pocket of my skirt.There was one item I had carried on my person at all times, not trusting it to the vagaries of travel.I laid the small, flat case on the table and flipped the latch.Im not going to let you die this time either, I informed him, greatly as I may be tempted.I carefully extracted the roll of gray flannel and laid it on the table with a soft clinking noise.I unrolled the flannel, displaying the gleaming row of syringes, and rummaged in the box for the small bottle of penicillin tablets.What in Gods name are those?Jamie asked, eyeing the syringes with interest.They look wicked sharp.I didnt answer, occupied in dissolving the penicillin tablets in the vial of sterile water.I selected a glass barrel, fitted a needle, and pressed the tip through the rubber covering the mouth of the bottle.Holding it up to the light, I pulled back slowly on the plunger, watching the thick white liquid fill the barrel, checking for bubbles.Then pulling the needle free, I depressed the plunger slightly until a drop of liquid pearled from the point and rolled slowly down the length of the spike.Roll onto your good side, I said, turning to Jamie, and pull up your shirt.He eyed the needle in my hand with keen suspicion, but reluctantly obeyed.I surveyed the terrain with approval.Your bottom hasnt changed a bit in twenty years, I remarked, admiring the muscular curves.Neither has yours, he replied courteously, but Im no insisting you expose it.Are ye suffering a sudden attack of lustfulness?Not just at present, I said evenly, swabbing a patch of skin with a cloth soaked in brandy.Thats a verra nice make of brandy, he said, peering back over his shoulder, but Im more accustomed to apply it at the other end.Its also the best source of alcohol available.Hold still now, and relax.I jabbed deftly and pressed the plunger slowly in.Ouch!Jamie rubbed his posterior resentfully.Itll stop stinging in a minute.I poured an inch of brandy into the cup.Now you can have a bit to drinka very little bit.He drained the cup without comment, watching me roll up the collection of syringes.Finally he said, I thought ye stuck pins in ill wish dolls when ye meant to witch someone; not in the people themselves.Its not a pin, its a hypodermic syringe.I dinna care what ye call it; it felt like a bloody horseshoe nail.Would ye care to tell me why jabbing pins in my arse is going to help my arm?I took a deep breath.Well, do you remember my once telling you about germs?He looked quite blank.Little beasts too small to see, I elaborated.They can get into your body through bad food or water, or through open wounds, and if they do, they can make you ill.He stared at his arm with interest.Ive germs in my arm, have I?You very definitely have.I tapped a finger on the small flat box.The medicine I just shot into your backside kills germs, though.You get another shot every four hours til this time tomorrow, and then well see how youre doing.I paused.Jamie was staring at me, shaking his head.Do you understand?I asked.He nodded slowly.Aye, I do.I should ha let them burn ye, twenty years ago.37  WHATS IN A NAME  After giving him a shot and settling him comfortably, I sat watching until he fell asleep again, allowing him to hold my hand until his own grip relaxed in sleep and the big hand dropped slack by his side.I sat by his bed for the rest of the night, dozing sometimes, and rousing myself by means of the internal clock all doctors have, geared to the rhythms of a hospitals shift changes.Two more shots, the last at daybreak, and by then the fever had loosed its hold perceptibly.He was still very warm to the touch, but his flesh no longer burned, and he rested easier, falling asleep after the last shot with no more than a few grumbles and a faint moan as his arm twinged.Bloody eighteenth century germs are no match for penicillin, I told his sleeping form.No resistance.Even if you had syphilis, Id have it cleaned up in no time.And what then?I wondered, as I staggered off to the kitchen in search of hot tea and food.A strange woman, presumably the cook or the housemaid, was firing up the brick oven, ready to receive the daily loaves that lay rising in their pans on the table.She didnt seem surprised to see me, but cleared away a small space for me to sit down, and brought me tea and fresh girdle cakes with no more than a quick Good mornin to ye, mum before returning to her work.Evidently, Jenny had informed the household of my presence.Did that mean she accepted it herself?I doubted it.Clearly, she had wanted me to go, and wasnt best pleased to have me back.If I was going to stay, there was plainly going to be a certain amount of explanation about Laoghaire, from both Jenny and Jamie.And I was going to stay.Thank you, I said politely to the cook, and taking a fresh cup of tea with me, went back to the parlor to wait until Jamie saw fit to wake up again.People passed by the door during the morning, pausing now and then to peep through, but always went on hurriedly when I looked up.At last, Jamie showed signs of waking, just before noon; he stirred, sighed, groaned as the movement jarred his arm, and subsided once more.I gave him a few moments to realize that I was there, but his eyes stayed shut.He wasnt asleep, though; the lines of his body were slightly tensed, not relaxed in slumber.I had watched him sleep all night; I knew the difference.All right, I said.I leaned back in the chair, settling myself comfortably, well out of his reach.Lets hear it, then.A small slit of blue showed under the long auburn lashes, then disappeared again.Mmmm?he said, pretending to wake slowly.The lashes fluttered against his cheeks.Dont stall, I said crisply.I know perfectly well youre awake.Open your eyes and tell me about Laoghaire.The blue eyes opened and rested on me with an expression of some disfavor.Youre no afraid of giving me a relapse?he inquired.Ive always heard sick folk shouldna be troubled owermuch.It sets them back.You have a doctor right here, I assured him.If you pass out from the strain, Ill know what to do about it.Thats what Im afraid of.His narrowed gaze flicked to the little case of drugs and hypodermics on the table, then back to me.My arse feels like Ive sat in a gorse bush wi no breeks on.Good, I said pleasantly.Youll get another one in an hour.Right now, youre going to talk.His lips pressed tight together, but then relaxed as he sighed.He pushed himself laboriously upright against the pillows, one handed.I didnt help him.All right, he said at last.He didnt look at me, but down at the quilt, where his finger traced the edge of the starred design.Well, it was when Id come back from England.He had come up from the Lake District and over the Carters Bar, that great ridge of high ground that divides England from Scotland, on whose broad back the ancient courts and markets of the Borders had been held.Theres a stone there to mark the border, maybe youll know; it looks the sort of stone to last a while.He glanced at me, questioning, and I nodded.I did know it; a huge menhir, some ten feet tall.In my time, someone had carved on its one face ENGLAND, and on the other, SCOTLAND.There he stopped to rest, as thousands of travelers had stopped over the years, his exiled past behind him, the futureand homebelow and beyond, past the hazy green hollows of the Lowlands, up into the gray crags of the Highlands, hidden by fog.His good hand ran back and forth through his hair, as it always did when he thought, leaving the cowlicks on top standing up in small, bright whorls.Youll not know how it is, to live among strangers for so long.Wont I?I said, with some sharpness.He glanced up at me, startled, then smiled faintly, looking down at the coverlet.Aye, maybe ye will, he said.Ye change, no?Much as ye want to keep the memories of home, and who ye areyoure changed.Not one of the strangers; ye could never be that, even if ye wanted to.But different from who ye were, too.I thought of myself, standing silent beside Frank, a bit of flotsam in the eddies of university parties, pushing a pram through the chilly parks of Boston, playing bridge and talking with other wives and mothers, speaking the foreign language of middle class domesticity.Strangers indeed.Yes, I said.I know.Get on.He sighed, rubbing his nose with a forefinger.So I came back, he said.He looked up, a smile hidden in the corner of his mouth.What is it ye told wee Ian?Home is the place where, when ye have to go there, they have to take ye in?Thats it, I said.Its a quotation from a poet called Frost.But what do you mean?Surely your family was glad to see you!He frowned, fingering the quilt.Aye, they were, he said slowly.Its not thatI dinna mean they made me feel unwelcome, not at all.But I had been away so longMichael and wee Janet and Ian didna even remember me.He smiled ruefully.Theyd heard about me, though.When I came into the kitchen, theyd squash back against the walls and stare at me, wi their eyes gone round.He leaned forward a little, intent on making me understand.See, it was different, when I hid in the cave.I wasna in the house, and they seldom saw me, but I was always here, I was always part of them.I hunted for them; I kent when they were hungry, or cold, or when the goats were ill or the kail crop poor, or a new draft under the kitchen door.Then I went to prison, he said abruptly.And to England.I wrote to themand they to mebut it canna be the same, to see a few black words on the paper, telling things that happened months before.And when I came back He shrugged, wincing as the movement jarred his arm.It was different.Ian would ask me what I thought of fencing in auld Kirbys pasture, but Id know hed already set Young Jamie to do it.Id walk through the fields, and folk would squint at me, suspicious, thinking me a stranger.Then their eyes would go big as theyd seen a ghost, when they knew me.He stopped, looking out at the window, where the brambles of his mothers rose beat against the glass as the wind changed.I was a ghost, I think.He glanced at me shyly.If ye ken what I mean.Maybe, I said.Rain was streaking the glass, with drops the same gray as the sky outside.You feel like your ties to the earth are broken, I said softly.Floating through rooms without feeling your footsteps.Hearing people speak to you, and not making sense of it.I remember thatbefore Bree was born.But I had had one tie then; I had her, to anchor me to life.He nodded, not looking at me, and then was quiet for a minute.The peat fire hissed on the hearth behind me, smelling of the Highlands, and the rich scent of cock a leekie and baking bread spread through the house, warm and comforting as a blanket.I was here, he said softly, but not home.I could feel the pull of it around methe house, the family, the place itself.I, who couldnt remember a childhood home, felt the urge to sit down here and stay forever, enmeshed in the thousand strands of daily life, bound securely to this bit of earth.What would it have meant to him, who had lived all his life in the strength of that bond, endured his exile in the hope of coming back to it, and then arrived to find himself still rootless?And I suppose I was lonely, he said quietly.He lay still on the pillow, eyes closed.I suppose you were, I said, careful to let no tone either of sympathy or condemnation show.I knew something of loneliness, too.He opened his eyes then, and met my gaze with a naked honesty.Aye, there was that too, he said.Not the main thing, nobut aye, that too.Jenny had tried, with varying degrees of gentleness and insistence, to persuade him to marry again.She had tried intermittently since the days after Culloden, presenting first one and then another personable young widow, this and that sweet tempered virgin, all to no avail.Now, bereft of the feelings that had sustained him so far, desperately seeking some sense of connectionhe had listened.Laoghaire was married to Hugh MacKenzie, one of Colums tacksmen, he said, eyes closed once more.Hugh was killed at Culloden, though, and two years later, Laoghaire married Simon MacKimmie of clan Fraser.The two lassiesMarsali and Joantheyre his.The English arrested him a few years later, and took him to prison in Edinburgh.He opened his eyes, looking up at the dark ceiling beams overhead.He had a good house, and property worth seizing.That was enough to make a Highland man a traitor, then, whether hed fought for the Stuarts openly or not.His voice was growing hoarse, and he stopped to clear his throat.Simon wasnt as lucky as I was.He died in prison, before they could bring him to trial.The Crown tried for some time to take the estate, but Ned Gowan went to Edinburgh, and spoke for Laoghaire, and he managed to save the main house and a little money, claiming it was her dower right.Ned Gowan?I spoke with mingled surprise and pleasure.He cant still be alive, surely?It was Ned Gowan, a small and elderly solicitor who advised the MacKenzie clan on legal matters, who had saved me from being burned as a witch, twenty years before.I had thought him quite ancient then.Jamie smiled, seeing my pleasure.Oh, aye.I expect theyll have to knock him on the head wi an ax to kill him.He looks just the same as he always did, though he must be past seventy now.Does he still live at Castle Leoch?He nodded, reaching to the table for the tumbler of water.He drank awkwardly, right handed, and set it back.Whats left of it.Aye, though hes traveled a great deal these last years, appealing treason cases and filing lawsuits to recover property.Jamies smile had a bitter edge.Theres a saying, aye?After a war, first come the corbies to eat the flesh; and then the lawyers, to pick the bones.His right hand went to his left shoulder, massaging it unconsciously.No, hes a good man, is Ned, in spite of his profession.He goes back and forth to Inverness, to Edinburghsometimes even to London or Paris.And he stops here from time to time, to break his journey.It was Ned Gowan who had mentioned Laoghaire to Jenny, returning from Balriggan to Edinburgh.Pricking up her ears, Jenny had inquired for further details, and finding these satisfactory, had at once sent an invitation to Balriggan, for Laoghaire and her two daughters to come to Lallybroch for Hogmanay, which was near.The house was bright that night, with candles lit in the windows, and bunches of holly and ivy fixed to the staircase and the doorposts.There were not so many pipers in the Highlands as there had been before Culloden, but one had been found, and a fiddler as well, and music floated up the stairwell, mixed with the heady scent of rum punch, plum cake, almond squirts, and Savoy biscuits.Jamie had come down late and hesitant.Many people here he had not seen in nearly ten years, and he was not eager to see them now, feeling changed and distant as he did.But Jenny had made him a new shirt, brushed and mended his coat, and combed his hair smooth and plaited it for him before going downstairs to see to the cooking.He had no excuse to linger, and at last had come down, into the noise and swirl of the gathering.Mister Fraser!Peggy Gibbons was the first to see him; she hurried across the room, face glowing, and threw her arms about him, quite unabashed.Taken by surprise, he hugged her back, and within moments was surrounded by a small crowd of women, exclaiming over him, holding up small children born since his departure, kissing his cheeks and patting his hands.The men were shyer, greeting him with a gruff word of welcome or a slap on the back as he made his way slowly through the rooms, until, quite overwhelmed, he had escaped temporarily into the lairds study.Once his fathers room, and then his own, it now belonged to his brother in law, who had run Lallybroch through the years of his absence.The ledgers and stockbooks and accounts were all lined up neatly on the edge of the battered desk; he ran a finger along the leather spines, feeling a sense of comfort at the touch.It was all in here; the planting and the harvests, the careful purchases and acquisitions, the slow accumulations and dispersals that were the rhythm of life to the tenants of Lallybroch.On the small bookshelf, he found his wooden snake.Along with everything else of value, he had left it behind when he went to prison.A small icon carved of cherrywood, it had been the gift of his elder brother, dead in childhood.He was sitting in the chair behind the desk, stroking the snakes well worn curves, when the door of the study opened.Jamie?she had said, hanging shyly back.He had not bothered to light a lamp in the study; she was silhouetted by the candles burning in the hall.She wore her pale hair loose, like a maid, and the light shone through it, haloing her unseen face.Youll remember me, maybe?she had said, tentative, reluctant to come into the room without invitation.Aye, he said, after a pause.Aye, of course I do.The musics starting, she said.It was; he could hear the whine of the fiddle and the stamp of feet from the front parlor, along with an occasional shout of merriment.It showed signs of being a good party already; most of the guests would be asleep on the floor come morning.Your sister says youre a bonny dancer, she said, still shy, but determined.It will ha been some time since I tried, he said, feeling shy himself, and painfully awkward, though the fiddle music ached in his bones and his feet twitched at the sound of it.Its Tha mo Leabaidh san FhraochIn the Heathers my Bedyoull ken that one.Will ye come and try wi me?She had held out a hand to him, small and graceful in the half dark.And he had risen, clasped her outstretched hand in his own, and taken his first steps in pursuit of himself.It was in here, he said, waving his good hand at the room where we sat.Jenny had had the furniture cleared away, all but one table wi the food and the whisky, and the fiddler stood by the window there, wi a new moon over his shoulder.He nodded at the window, where the rose vine trembled.Something of the light of that Hogmanay feast lingered on his face, and I felt a small pang, seeing it.We danced all that night, sometimes wi others, but mostly with each other.And at the dawn, when those still awake went to the end o the house to see what omens the New Year might bring, the two of us went, too.The single women took it in turns to spin about, and walk through the door wi their eyes closed, then spin again and open their eyes to see what the first thing they might see would befor that tells them about the man theyll marry, ye ken.There had been a lot of laughter, as the guests, heated by whisky and dancing, pushed and shoved at the door.Laoghaire had held back, flushed and laughing, saying it was a game for young girls, and not for a matron of thirty four, but the others had insisted, and try she had.Spun three times clockwise and opened the door, stepped out into the cold dawnlight and spun again.And when she opened her eyes, they had rested on Jamies face, wide with expectation.Sothere she was, a widow wi two bairns.She needed a man, that was plain enough.I neededsomething.He gazed into the fire, where the low flame glimmered through the red mass of the peat; heat without much light.I supposed that we might help each other.They had married quietly at Balriggan, and he had moved his few possessions there.Less than a year later, he had moved out again, and gone to Edinburgh.
