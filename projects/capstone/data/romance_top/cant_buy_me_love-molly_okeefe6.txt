The silk of her skin, the perfect weight of her breasts.He thought about the slow suction of her body, the tangy sweet taste of her.His handno, hed go with her hand, soapy and wet, sliding down his stomach, the muscles of his abs, top of his thigh.Part of him felt ridiculous, like a sick sixteen year old kid who didnt have any other outlet.But the rest of him just wanted some relief.Just wanted Tara.Giving into the fantasy, he cupped the heavy weight of his sac, the thick stalk of his dick, and found his rhythm.Gathering speed and steam, imagining Tara Jeans hands, her breasts.Imagining her on her knees in front of him.Imagining the sensation of driving into her, her mouth, her body.It was good.So good.He bit his lip, stroked harder, held himself out, made himself work.But all good things had to end, and he groaned into his bicep where hed rested it against the wall and ejaculated into the mist.Panting, he rinsed off his hand and wrestled with how hollow he felt.How sometimes masturbation turned the dial way up on his loneliness.He turned off the water and opened the glass door, letting the cold air smother the steam and raise goose bumps across his skin.If Tara had her way, this was the closest hed ever get to her again.And he couldnt let that happen.Monday morning, things werent going well for Tara.She hadnt slept well for the past two nights, her body too aware that the source of all that pleasure was under the same roof.Like some kind of divining rod, she vibrated all night.Finally at dawn, she couldnt take it anymore and she dragged herself, exhausted and stressed, out of bed.She stood in front of her closet in a state of total apathy.Too hot for leather.Or jeans.She wasnt in the mood for anything tight.Or boobylicious.Finally, from the back, she pulled a knee length pale blue linen skirt with a sleeveless white wrap top.Are you a nun?the demon asked, and Tara thought the idea had merit.She passed Eli in front of the coffeemaker.He poured her a cup of coffee and pushed the sugar bowl her way.You all right?Why?He shrugged.You seemedgy.Edgy like a Ginsu knife; she could chew through a tin can without a problem.Im fine, she grunted, and added three heaping teaspoons of sugar to her coffee.Eli chuckled and like a smart man, went on his way.Outside, the humidity slapped her like a damp washcloth and her mood sunk even lower; the walk to the greenhouse felt like slogging through mud.The message light on her phone flashed and for some reason, the nature of its blinking seemed foreboding.Malevolent.Thats just your mood, she told herself, but she wasted no time dialing her service.Hi, Tara Jean, this is Claire Hughes.Taras stomach tied itself into a dozen little knots.Claire Hughes was the buyer for Nordstrom.I just heard about Lyles death, Im so sorry.Please give me a call to discuss what this means for our meeting.What this means?she thought, staring down into the little holes on the receiver as if they might be able to translate the vaguely discouraging nature of that message.What this means?It wasnt possible that the Nordstrom deal was going to go south.There was no way.She thought of Dennis, of his hand around her throat.Victoria.Christ, Jacob.The blood roared in her ears as she quickly dialed Claires number.Come on, she breathed as the phone rang.It clicked, and she smiled broadly, as if Claire were standing right in front of her.Hi, this is Tara Youve reached the voice mail box of Claire Hughes.I will be out of the office until Friday, June twelfth.Please leave a message and Ill return your call as soon as possible.Fuck!she cried, just before the beep.Hi there, Claire, she said after the beep.For some reason she let her accent have full rein when talking to Claire.She sounded as Southern as catfish when dealing with the woman.Actually, she sounded like her own momma.Thats right, the demon purred.Everyone loves a little sugar.This is Tara Jean Sweet.I just got your message and I wanted to reassure you that Lyles death in no way changes our plans for working with you and Nordstrom.I am very much looking forward to meeting you at the end of July.Tara Jean hung up and took a big breath.Nothing you can do about it, Tara, she whispered, a sad little pep talk.Not one goddamned thing.Tired already, she picked up her coffee and sat down in her chair.Which erupted in wild, juicy fart noises.She jerked upright and her coffee, hot and staining, splashed all over her white top.What the hell!she cried, turning to see the plastic bladder on the seat.A whoopee cushion?From the far end of the greenhouse, under the cutting table in the darkest shadows, she heard a muffled giggle.Oh no, she thought, picking up the toy.No freaking way!Not the kid on top of everything else.She stomped down the center aisle, fanning her ruined shirt away from the scalded skin beneath it until she got to the table.She waited a second, and in the silence she heard the faint wheeze of an inhaler.She crouched, and there in the darkness she saw a flash of pale skin, a cheek, and one big wide eye before the boy shifted back into the shadows, rustling paper as he went.I can hear you, you know, she sighed.Another thump and a box fell forward, spilling empty Starburst wrappers over her feet.Son of a bitch!Hi.His fingers lifted in a little wave.Get the hell out of there.He crawled out, knocking over another box as he went.Zippers flew everywhere.You think this is funny?She shook the whoopee cushion at him.Uhyeah?Well, its not.What if I had sat down while I was on the phone?The boy had the good sense to wince.I guess that wouldnt have been funny.No, it wouldnt have.And youve been eating my candy.I got hungry, he whispered.He took a quick puff off his inhaler and she refused to listen to the voices in her head screaming bully!Wheres your momma?she asked.Probably looking for me.Well, lets go find her.But you know, I was thinking, maybe I could help you around here or something.I could He shrugged, looking like an earnest dark haired Opie.Do whatever you needed.Clean up, or I dont need any help around here, she said, cold as ice.Oh.You sure?Because I really hate dance classes.His smile, lopsided and toothy, was endearing.More endearing actually than she could stand, the way he stood there with his young, new heart right there on his face, and she wanted to wrap her arms around him, hold him close, protect that tender heart from the dangers of the world.Dangers like her.Such innocence only reminded her of her own ruin.How far shed fallen.Absolutely.Lets find your mom.She took off for the door, stepping out into the white hot early June sunshine.Like glue, the heat put all the fragile pieces of her act back together.Luc came down the front steps of the house and the boy ran over to him, slipping his hand into his uncles.And she forced herself to stand up straight and look Luc in the eye, brushing aside the memory of his hands on her body.Her hands on his body.Pretending it was all nothing.Whats going on?Luc asked, his hand curved around Jacobs shoulder, and her body shook in memory and shame.Keep the kid away from the greenhouse, Tara Jean snapped.Was he causing trouble?She pushed the whoopee cushion against his chest.Luc laughed and Tara Jean felt herself turn red.Its not funny, Luc.Keep the kid away from me.16 No good could come of following her.He knew that.He should wait for a better moment.A moment not quite so aggressive.But if he waited for a moment without the fireworks, he had no doubt that hed be waiting a long time.The way shed treated Jacob was concerning, but whatever her reasons for playing the bitch, he was invested enough to listen.To try and figure her out.He stepped into the greenhouse only to find her crouched on the floor, her skirt hiked up to reveal the long, muscled length of her leg.His blood pumped harder and he realized in that moment that what he liked most about Tara Jean was the challenge of her.The fight of her.She gave him nothing that he didnt work for.And he couldnt remember the last time that had happened.He watched as she swept the wrappers into the garbage can and then picked up the bag of spilled candy.What do you want?That she refused to look at him wasnt a surprise.You want to tell me whats wrong?Luc stayed calm, trying not to take offense.Trying not to get his own temper engaged.The kid.She stood and put an orange candy in her mouth.You guys need to watch him better.He glanced around her pristine workshop.Did he damage something?Break anything?Doesnt matter.She tried to step past him toward her desk, but he got in her way.You scared him, and Id like to know why.He could see the skin around her eye twitch and he leaned closer, trying to get her to look at him.To see him.The man who had held her while she crashed through orgasm after orgasm.The man whom shed talked to, really talked to, about her past and her life.Because she was acting like he was nothing.The boys not welcome here.You know, hes just a kid and hes all alone Not my problem, Luc.Then what is?As soon as the challenge came out of his mouth, he regretted it, because engaging in a fight wasnt what he wanted.Hed lose her in a fight.Is this about Saturday night?he asked.No, Luc.Not everything is about sex.Saturday night wasnt even about sex.You signed up to be used, Luc.He laughed, and she bristled.Honey, Id be nothing but happy if youd used me for sex.If youd turned around and told me you were done with me and I should go on my merry way, I would have gone.But something else happened, Tara.And I was It had been a while, thats all.He didnt believe her, not for a minute, but he nodded anyway and she jerked away, cutting the other way around the table.Tara.Look at me.She didnt and he waited her out, waited and waited, wondering if she was such a coward, until finally she sighed like a put out teenager and tossed her long hair over her shoulder.What?Imin.He held out his hands, as if showing her he had no hidden agenda.No weapons formed against her.Im interested.I dont want to hurt you.Im not interested in using you.I like you.AndId like to like you more.Know you more.For a moment it was as if she were frozen, unblinking, as if his words had done something to her, shorted out all electrical activity, and he had hope.Hope that shed turn toward him rather than away.Thats a bad idea.She crouched to pick up a box of spilled zippers and the moment shattered.He sucked in a quick breath, struggling for recovery.Why?Because Im not interested in knowing anything else about you.She threw zippers into the box as if theyd grown legs and were trying to escape.You bore me, with your privilege and your daddy issues.Who gives a shit about an old hockey player who is too stupid to know when he should retire?It wasnt as bad as the Gilcot hit, but he felt it.A rippling pain radiating from his stomach.And the killer was that he hadnt seen it coming.Is thisis this you?Luc asked, and she looked right at him, her eyes the color of already gone.Of who gives a shit.I mean, every time I turn around I have no idea who Im going to get.The flirt, or the woman who tries to help me, or the The bitch, she interrupted.The bitch is me, Luc.All the way down.So mind your own business, keep the kid away, and leave me the hell alone.She watched his jaw, the fine muscles there pulsing and relaxing, and she could only imagine what he was forcing himself not to say.She bit her own tongue to keep herself from taking the words back, because throwing this man away with both hands was surprisingly hard.Surprisingly painful.II wont be back, Tara, he said, and she nodded at his words.She knew that, shed hit him where he hurt, and Luc had enough pride not to sniff around where he wasnt wanted.Well, youre slow, but you aint stupid, are you?God, she sounded exactly like her mother.She could feel all his efforts to get past her act like crowbars, she knew that stupidly, shed let down her guard a few million times too many with this man, and he knew the routes and paths, the secret entrances into her head.But not anymore.Not after the other night.Dennis was back and she needed to be strong.And liking this man, letting him remind her of how lonely she was, how scared, how hungry she could be for affectionit would only make her weak.She knew how vulnerable that could make someone; shed preyed on those weaknesses in other people.Fine, he said and walked away.Just like she wanted.And he didnt look back, not once, as if he knew what a coward she was, how she could never be as honest with him as hed been with her.As if he knew she simply wasnt worth the effort.He left and took her every chance at being better with him.The silence he left behind was too thick and she couldnt breathe.Her heart fluttered in her chest, unpredictable and erratic.She saw silvery spots at the corner of her vision.It was a panic attack.She knew that, used to get them all the time when shed first come out to the ranch.Shed wake up at night in a cold sweat, hyperventilatingwhich wasnt exactly comfortable with broken ribsconvinced that Dennis was coming in through the window.To take her back to her old life.Luc didnt know what he was asking for.Wanting to know her?Please, it was ridiculous.If he knewwell, if he knew, it wouldnt be an issue anymore, would it?Its for the best, the demon whispered.Hes not for the likes of you.There was no arguing with the demon.Searching for a little comfort, she unwrapped a cherry Starburst.Usually her favorite.But it tasted like ash in her mouth.The flavor of regret.Luc got in his truck and left.He still had a few hours before the ice was his, but hed find something to do.Something far away from the ranch.Maybe hed help out with the peewees who had the ice before him.Teaching a bunch of screaming kids to stay on their skates would keep his mind off Tara.The road to Dallas was familiar at this point, a well worn path between the ranch and the ice arena, and he followed it, his mind twisting itself around Tara.The rejection was one thing, and it stung.But it wasnt real.Hed never seen such bullshit in his life as what Tara Jean had just tossed out at him.And maybe he would have believed it, but Saturday night he had seen the truth of Tara Jean.Felt the truth, and it had nothing to do with his fingers inside her body, or the thick, wet heat of her pleasure.It was in the set of her shoulders before she ran away.The trembling of her fingers against his chest before she kissed him.She liked him all right.She liked him a lot.But she was a coward.Fuck it, he breathed and grabbed his cell phone, punching speed dial even as he lifted the phone to his ear.He needed a friend.He needed a reminder of who he was and what was important.He needed hockey.And luckily, there was a guy in his life who embodied it.Hey, Luc, Billy said as he answered.Did you just hear?Hear what?Luc asked.The Lashenko trade?Fucking Beckett, the guy hadnt answered his phone this morning and then Luc had gotten distracted by Tara.See, he thought, see what distractions do?They fuck you up.Luc sat back against the seat, bracing himself for the hit.Im going to Dallas?Luc asked.No.Billy took a deep breath.Our first draft pick, Svetka, Collins.Collins?There goes our net And me.Without Billy it will be open season on you.That was the doctors warning.That was actually common knowledge.And Luc had disregarded it because next year, he and Billy were supposed to be on the ice together.They were supposed to hoist that cup over their heads together.Billy made sure nothing happened to Luc.Billy took every hit meant for Luc.Without him, Luc would have a giant target on his back and while they might get another defenseman whod try to play and work as hard as Billy, it was doubtful.Guaranteed increased odds of future damaging concussions What happens if I get knocked out again?he thought.The specter of the drooling early onset Alzheimer linebackers rolled through his head, a chill of premonition sliding down his spine.But he shook it off and pulled over to the side of the road.You all right?he asked his friend.Ten years together and it was over.Just like that.I dont love it, Billy answered.But Im still playing.How is the knee?Doc cleared me to skate.Down and back and some figure eights.Nothing fancy.What about the vipers?Billy blew out a breath.Theyre killing me, man.I got an arena down here in Dallas.Empty ice.A couple hours a day Ill be there tonight, Billy said.No distractions.Just ice, Billy said and hung up.It was going to be bittersweet to skate with Billy again.This was the end for them.Billy in Dallas.He shook his head, trying to imagine the locker room without him.Trying to imagine the kid theyd try to replace Billy with.He was going to be surrounded by kids, he realized, feeling empty.Talented kids ready to play their hearts out, but kids nonetheless.Retire.Get out while youre ahead.The doctors warnings rang loud in his head, a bell freshly rung.And for a moment, solid and real, he couldnt push the thought awaythe game was dangerous for him now.Without Billy there to take those hitsevery brawler in the league would be gunning for him.But Im good, he reminded himself.Im the best.And without Billy, Ill just have to be better.Develop eyes in the back of my head, play more defensively.No more prima donna, untouchable crap; its time to play hockey like I used to.Luc closed his phone and realized he had a message.From Beckett.For the first time since walking into Taras studio, he felt his legs under him.This was what he needed.The full and total commitment of all his energy on what mattered.Hockey.He put the car in drive and got back up onto the road, and then he called Beckett.And Tara Jean was forgotten.17 Victoria tried to act casual, as if coming into Bimbo Barbies workshop out of curiosity was a perfectly normal thing for her to do.Which it wasnt, and from the slack jawed look on Tara Jeans face, she knew it too.Victoria had been on the ranch for a month and hadnt stepped foot in the place.Hi, Victoria said, smiling slightly, wiping her sweaty hands against the twill of her walking shorts.Hi, Tara said.Are you here because of your son?What about my son?The foundation of courage shed had to build just to walk into the greenhouse faltered slightly.Hes been sneaking around my workshop.Tara leaned back from her desk.And I dont like it.Ill talk to him, she said, and Tara nodded.But she wasnt in here because of JacobWell she was in a way.In a big picture kind of way.Do it, she told herself, just do it.Just open your mouth and ask.But instead she got very interested in looking at the leather items hanging on the rack near the back.Is thisis this for the leather stores?No.Tara rolled her eyes.Theyre for the cows.Of course theyre for the stores.Victoria pressed the tip of her tongue to her upper lip.Being mocked by a woman like Tara Jean Sweet was pretty much the bottom of a deep, deep barrel and her pride, or what was left of it, reared up in defense.Victoria was surprised to feel the thin mantle of cool superiority that settled over her shoulders, like in the good old days, and she relished it.Tied the edges together in a saucy knot and turned to face Tara, one eyebrow raised.Do you just do clothes for strippers?What is with you people?Tara asked.Anyone who wears leather must take it off for money?Something like that, Victoria said; she found a certain comfort in snobbery.Lord knows shed used it like an all purpose weapon back when her life was normal.A blunt instrument to beat everyone around her into submission.She gave Tara one of her most enigmatic and superior smiles.That it worked and Tara dropped her eyes for a second gave her a shot of victory.A thrill she hadnt felt in a long time.Is there something you wanted?Tara asked.She wore a white wraparound shirt, splattered with coffee, and a blue linen skirt.She almost lookednormal.Victoria glanced down at her hands, her ring finger that was so naked without her wedding band and engagement ring, both of which shed given to the lawyers to sell.For a while shed been glad to lose that identity.Joel Schulmans wifeit had been a necklace of boulders around her neck, drowning her.Drowning Jacob.But shed learned this last year that she had no identity with that naked ring finger.Not one that would provide for her son.Not one that would bring them any security.Wedding bandsto some extentwere security.And the way Dennis had looked at her.Appreciative and respectful.Warm.The way his eyes had clung to her face, checked out her naked fingersthose looks sometimes led to wedding rings.And for the first time in a year, shed felt something in return.Worth.But sometimes those looks led to more heartbreak, and frankly, shed had her fill.The smart thing would be to delete Denniss number, punched into her cell phone with his own fingers.Saturday night when hed gone off with Tara Jean, Victoria had sat on the verandah, counting stars and trying to convince herself that he wasnt in there screwing Bimbo Barbie while she stood in the moonlight like a fool.But when hed come out of that greenhouse, he saw her and walked over, radiating a kind of male confidence that turned her insides to putty.This was a man who could care for a woman.Provide for her.And her son.After putting his number in her phone, hed told her he was staying at the Four Seasons in Dallas and to call anytime she was in town.Shed called him last night, and the flirtation had beenhealing.Exciting.And in the cool light of day, she wondered again about heartbreak.Yes, she blurted, too loud, too awkward.Everything she didnt want to be.Spit it out, Victoria, Tara Jean sighed.I dont want to play games.No games.Perfect.She dropped the smile.Tell me about Dennis.Why?Tara nearly barked.We share some interests, she said, walking along the long table in the middle of the workshop, her fingers running over the edge.And hes a handsome man.She shrugged.Im curious, thats all.You have nothing in common with Dennis.Taras tone was an essay in wounded pride.Oh my, Victoria thought, this woman is jealous.I thought the two of you were just friends.Or is that just on his side?Tara was breathing hard through her nose, her lovely face blotchy and red.Angry Tara Jean wasnt pretty.Victorias beleagured pride clapped like a little girl at a birthday party.Dennis is bad news, Victoria, she said and then, surprisingly, she ran a hand over her face, pressed her fingers against her eyes for a moment.Victoria realized she was witness to a very private meltdown, and she felt an unwanted twinge of kinship.As a woman whod had too many private meltdowns made public, she knew how painful it was to have such moments observed.Tara?When Tara dropped her hands, Bimbo Barbie was gone.It was as if a mask had come off, revealing sharper bones, brighter eyes.The excess was missing and Tara Jean was stripped down to the framework.Is this about money?asked this sharper version of Tara.Of course not, Victoria lied, and badly.Because Dennis doesnt have any.Of course he does.Hes working on a real estate deal.Tara Jean laughed and it felt like a knife, wielded against both of them.Victorias feminine power began to cringe, sulking into the dark corners it had come from.There will never be any money.Not for Dennis.Trust me, Victoria, youre better off staying far, far away from him.Victoria lifted her chin, refusing to believe that the man shed met was lying to her.Shed married a liar, a very, very good one, and no one would be able to fool her again.Perhaps youre just jealous, she said, but Tara was shaking her head before the words even left her mouth.Hes a friend of mine, Victoria.She put a hand to her chest, covering the coffee stain there.Do you honestly want to date a friend of mine?Have your son around a man who is just like me?Hes not like you.Hes nothing like you.Hes a chameleon.He shows you what you want to see and you want to see a wealthy man, a kind man, with an eye toward family.The kind of man who could take care of you.Hes playing you, Victoria.She shook her head, refusing to believe this woman.This liar.Victoria had gone through hell and come out the other side intact.With her son.She deserved some luck.She deserved some kindness, and she wasnt about to let this woman take it away.It was a mistake to come here.Victoria turned for the door.Look, Victoria, Tara said.I dont know your whole situation but I know that Lyle tied you up in the same knot hes got the rest of us in, and if you need money Victoria shook her head, not interested in Tara Jeans solution.It had been a stupid idea to come here and even more stupid to stay, to let this womans poison anywhere near her.Victoria, wait.Tara Jean edged around the desk and stepped in front of Victoria, keeping her from the door.They were the same height now, Victoria in her ballet slippers, Tara Jean in her ridiculous stripper shoes, and Victoria got a good look in Tara Jeans eyes.And what she saw there confused her.Compassion.I can hire you to be a small model for the final fitting of the winter line, she said.Its not a lot of money, but its some.And it would be yours.Not given to you.Not tied to a man.Youd earn it on your own.Victoria blinked at Tara Jean and after a moment, Tara Jean smiled.Whatwhat do you think?I think youre ridiculous.Victoria reached for the door, but once again Tara Jean got in the way.You can determine your worth, Victoria, she said.Right now, you can say yes and do the job.Straight up.No strings, no rings, no men, no humiliation, no asking for permission, none of it What the hell do you know?Victoria asked through her teeth, feeling as if she were turning to ice and stone.How did thiswhore know her so well?How did Tara Jean get to look at Victoria and see her secrets and tear her apart?In what world could this be okay?Im sorry I came in here, Victoria said, and after a moment Tara Jean rushed aside and Victoria rushed out the door.The offer stands.Tara Jeans words followed her up to the big house like a dog she couldnt shake off.That night Tara sat up in bed and glanced over at the clock, its green numbers glowing in the dark.Midnight.Shed been tossing and turning for two hours.The same freaking questions played over and over in her head like a hamster in a squeaky wheel: Was Victoria going to listen to her and stay away from Dennis?What would happen when she gave Dennis the two hundred grand?Did she really think hed go away?Was this just the price she had to pay for everything shed done in her past?She hung her head and sighed before tossing the blankets off her legs and standing up.The flannel shirt slid down to her knees and she kicked around under her bed until she found her bunny slippers.If she couldnt sleep, she might as well find what was left of that ice cream.The dark hallway was cool, the navy runner plush under her bare feet, and she followed it toward the kitchen.The family all slept on the other side of the house.It was just she and Ruby on this side, so it was strange that the door to the second bedroom was shut.Jacob, she thought, and she had to give the kid points for persistence.The kid seemed truly invested in driving his mother all the way into crazy.No one in the family did things halfway.She opened the door, ready to drag him back to the other wing, but the bed was empty.A small duffle bag sat on top of it.Her blood froze in her veins.Would Dennis send Carl?At the thought, her skin tried to crawl right off her body.Carl, who had helped Dennis beat the crap out of her four years ago.Carl, who always brought a small duffle bag filled with a change of clothes in case things got too messy.Why would he send Carl?The thought was a high pitched scream in the middle of her head.But it wasnt as if Dennis was rational.And he was still mad that shed left him the way she had, running away in the night before he could get the money shed given back to Mr.Dickow.Was this how he was going to get in touch with her?By sending his thug?She shut the door and looked behind her.The hallway was empty, the house silent.She ran quickly toward the center of the house, thinking shed cut through the kitchen and get to the family wing and make sure they were all okay, make sure Carl didnt get lost in the big house and beat the shit out of the wrong woman.Or scare a little kid.She gagged, remembering the smile on his face when he broke her ribs.His glee as she screamed.She ran faster.The carpet under her feet changed to tile and the kitchen appliances loomed in the shadows.She cut around the island and ran right into a solid wall of heat.Flesh under a T shirt.Somehow she knew it wasnt Luc.The smell was wrong.The shape was wrongwider and shorter.His hands as he grabbed her arms were foreign.Carl.She kicked, lifting her knee toward his dick, hoping to catch him off guard.Hoping, actually, to stop any future, horrific daddy plan he might have.Whoa, whoa, a deep voice said as he shifted sideways, blocking her knee.What the hell?She lifted her arm, his hand attached, and sunk her teeth deep into the thin flesh on top of his knuckles.Jesus Christ, lady, whats going on?Let me go, asshole, she said through her teeth and he dropped her.She stepped back, out of reach.He was in shadows, his face a black blur.Tell Dennis I have a plan.She continued to step backward, inching away from him.Dennis?The overhead lights flickered on and she blinked at the sudden change.It wasnt Carl.The big man with the broken down face, the thin scar connecting his lip to his ear, shaking out the hand she bit, wasnt Carl.Her brain simply could not process this; fear and adrenaline had shorted her circuits and she could only gape at him.Who the hell are you?My friend, Luc said, and she whirled to see him at the doorway, his hand on the light switches.Billy Wilkins.She bit me!Billy pointed at the perfect circle of her teeth imprinted around his knuckle.Im sorry.You grabbed me.I You ran into me!I thoughtI thought you were someone else.Luc, the guy said, smiling a little, and his face changed.Through the scars and the hideously broken nose, something glimmered.Nothing handsome, the man was too hard used for that, but something charming.A little boy with mischief on his mind.You didnt tell me I was going to have to fight women to stay here.Stay here?she asked.Billy is a guest.She shrank slightly in the face of his intensity, shifting sideways, putting the corner of the island between them.He noticed and crossed his arms, only managing to look more threatening.Thats great, she said, trying to smile and knowing shed failed.Lucs eyebrows clashed over his beautiful eyes.Who did you think he was?Luc pointed at Billy.Her mind backtracked, trying to remember what shed said, what shed unwittingly revealed.A burglar.She knew she sounded ridiculous, but she tossed her hair over her shoulder and met Lucs unreadable gaze.Fake it till you make it was kind of her motto.Stop lying, Luc said through his teeth, and she realized he was mad.Unease, the lesser cousin to all that fear shed just felt, climbed into her heartbeat.Im not He shook his head once and she fell silent, her lies giving up the fight.You mentioned Dennis, he said.Shit.What the hell is going on, Tara?And you tell me the truth or you can get the hell off this ranch.Luc stood there a stranger to herhis loyalty firmly on the side of his sister, not that she expected anything else.Not really.She glanced sideways at Billy and that charming little boy was gone, replaced by a gladiator.He was better backup muscle than Carl could ever dream of being and she knew when she was beat.And frankly, while she would never tell him the truthnot all of it anywayshe was very glad to hand over the protection of Victoria to someone who was better suited for the job.Victoria is interested in Dennis.Interested?Yes.Luc looked baffled, as if he didnt understand the word, and she sighed.Interested as in, wanting to get to know him better?She lifted her eyebrows, using his words from this morning to make it clear.Thats ridiculous, he laughed.She came into the workshop this morning to ask about him.Dennis?She nodded, and after a long minute he sighed.Okay.No, not okay.Not at all.Hes She licked her lips, finding the fine line she was going to walk.Not a good guy.Not for her.Not for anyone.Luc and Billy shared a quick look.You thought I was this Dennis guy?Billy asked.A friend of his.Lucs face was hard as rock and she saw all the dots connect in his head.He understood the threat, understood exactly what shed brought into his house.Yes, Dennis is the kind of man who has friends that break into peoples houses to scare them.She didnt say and worse.She sort of thought that was a given.And you know him how?I hardly think thats the point.Lucs eyes penetrated her chest, and she had to look away.Youre the point, his eyes said, but she could take care of herself.Theyd covered this ground and shed all but asked him not to care.You need to keep Victoria away from Dennis, she said.I tried to dissuade her, but She looked back up at Luc and saw the fear in his eyes.Shes so desperate, he murmured, and she nodded.What about you?Billy asked.Does someone need to keep this Dennis guy away from you?Luc stared at her so hard it was as if he were reading her mind, the back of her skull, the inside of her soul.And the words she thought shed never say grew in her mouth like weeds, fertilized by the weakness she felt in her bones and her skin, deep in her belly.She was tired of the fight.Of Dennis.Of pretending she was tough, when all she wanted was a soft spot to lay her head and someone to talk to.Really talk to.She was tired of being her.She opened her mouth, the words poised to fall out, but Luc got there first.She can take care of herself, he said.It wasnt rejection, not like what shed done to him, but the sting pierced her chest, going all the way down to her stomach.What did you expect?the demon whispered.Too much, she thought, when she least expected it.And that in the end was always her downfall.He stood there, staring at her, and she didnt know what he saw when he looked at her.What truth he was looking at.Hell, she couldnt even understand what he expected.And that, of course, made her search for the worst possible thingbecause that was what was usually expected of her.Illahpack my stuff.She cleared her throat, and hated herself for her clenched hands.Her stinging sadness.Head back to town.Probably a good idea.Luc nodded, no longer looking at her.Good night, she whispered, nodding to Billy because she was too tired to do anything more, and she left without once looking back at Luc.18 Youre going to just let her go?Billy asked, and Luc nodded, getting a beer out of the fridge.He didnt want a beer, but he needed to do something with his hands.With his body.Because that womans naked eyes were a magnet he was going to resist if it killed him.Shes in trouble, Billy said.I think shes the kind of woman who is always in trouble.He stared at the bottle, watching condensation gather under the frilled metal cap.Dude What?Luc barked.She doesnt want me worrying about her.She made that clear.Thats never stopped you before.Billy took the beer from off the counter.He popped off the top and handed it back to him.If youve got something to say, Billy, spit it out.Do you know why the guys call you Grandpa?The beast of his temper rattled its chains.I can guess.It has nothing to do with your age, Billy said.And everything to do with how you worry.About everyone.Whether they want it or not.Im team captain Right, and theres not another team captain in the league who cares if their center has a thing for strippers!You get that, right?Luc forced himself not to sag against the counter, not to feel every single second of his age in the face of Billys assessment.Of course he understood thatthis compulsion he had, no matter how much it chafed or how badly he wanted to resist it, was his own.He needed to take care of the people around him.You know this thing with your sister and your dadhe put all this shit together, the will, all of it Youre making me very sorry I told you about any of that.Yeah, Im sure.Billy grinned and leaned past him to get his own beer.But Im guessing your dad knew that you wouldnt leave your sister I was going to, Luc insisted, realizing that as far as defenses went, that one was awful: I was going to be an asshole.No, you werent, Billy scoffed.Youd have found a reason to stay.Just like youre going to find a reason to go talk to that woman.Tara?He jerked his thumb in the direction of the door.She doesnt need me.Shes made that very clear.She needs someone.Billy pulled a bag of chips out of the pantry door, already at home.Im dumb as rock, but I can see that.Luc took a swig of beer, as if challenging Billys assessment.As if to say fuck you and fuck Tara.Fuck everyone else I need to need me.He resisted as long as he could, his hands gripping the counter as if there were one of those cartoon gale force winds working against him, threatening to suck him right back out to Tara.Damnit.He pushed the beer over to Billy and followed Tara out the door.Go get her, Grandpa!Everything fit into her purse.The negligees that had been sitting in the top drawer for weeks before Lyle died.The bunny slippersall of it.When she walked out of here, she was taking every last scrap of lace and silk and leather she owned.And it fit inside a pursehow sad was that?Shed put extra locks on the door of her apartment.The windows.Hell, maybe shed move.There were fresh starts everywhere.Someone just had to be desperate enough to find them.She swung the overstuffed hobo bag over her shoulder and turned, only to find Luc filling the door.Shadows cut across his face, leaving his eyes and lips revealed in moonlight from the window.He was a closed book, every feature and muscle held in the kind of control she could only dream of.Her body sighed, swooning in remembered pleasure.So weak in front of all of his strength.Im leaving, she said when the silence became too much.You dont need to stand here and watch me go.Im worried about you.Worried?About her?That was sort of a first in her life, so she gave herself a moment with the words, a breath, a heartbeat, like holding a diamond in her hand.And then she pushed themand himaway.I thought I made it clear I wasnt interested in your concern.She shook her hair out of her eyes, meeting his gaze with every ounce of bravado and bullshit she could muster.Dont care!she wanted to yell at him.Im the poison, Ive always been the poison, and I will ruin this place and this family.Unfortunately, Tara, I cant lie every time I feel something I dont want to.I cant turn it off and I cant pretend Im not feeling it.There was no response, no flippant comeback to something so honest.It shamed her, his honesty.So she said nothing.She just put her chin up and walked toward the door.Toward him.An arms length from him, she stopped, the heat from his body something she imagined to be real, holding her there.Let me go.He shook his head.Not until you tell me whats going on, Tara.And no more bullshit.Ive told you.Victoria You.The word jabbed her in the chest.He stepped forward and now she wasnt imagining the heat from his body, it was there.So close she could put her numb hands against him and feel its warmth.What is going on with you?He lifted his eyebrows.I wont let you leave, Tara.Not until you tell me the truth.Oh please Stop it!She jerked back, stunned by his sudden ferocity.He rubbed his hands over his face, into his dark hair, putting every strand on end.Just talk to me, Tara.I want to help and you know I can, otherwise you wouldnt have been staying here.Now, I know this has something to do with Dennis.And I know its not good, so cut the crap and talk to me.I can help you.I wantI want to help you.He sounded tired, like he was dealing with a petulant child and sick of it.Her lip curled and her breath suddenly heaved in her chest.He was going towhat?Save her?Idiot.She was past saving.So far past it, she couldnt remember what innocence felt like.Her bag fell to the ground like a thousand pound weight.His eyes went wide at the sound and she had his attention.Good, because she was only going to tell this story once.I met Dennis when I was sixteen.I was She licked her lips, unable of course to tell the whole truth, because some things she just couldnt put into words.I was in trouble and broke.Dennis had a job as an orderly at a nursing home and he had this scam going.Hed befriend little old ladies who had no family, no visitors, and hed charm them into giving him gifts.Money.I knew I didnt like that guy.She put up her chin, braced for the left hook of his disdain.His disgust.He convinced me to do the same, but with the men.He started to shake his head, his eyes as wide as if shed told him she killed baby seals in her spare time, but she kept talking, a stone rolling downhill.Id go to a nursing home wearing a short skirt and my mothers crucifix and Id pretend I was looking for my grandpa so I could read him the paper.And She swallowed.Whoever said confession was good for the soul was a goddamned liar.She felt sick.The first guy, his name was Mr.Beanfang.You mentioned him before.Well, he was rich.So rich.He had money just lying around, like it didnt matter.And he didnt have any family and he washe was lonely.So I read him the paper.Or one of the books from his room.And he started giving me money.And you took it?There it wasthe trace of judgment, of disbeliefon the fringes of his voice.The destruction of everything he felt for her would begin like thisa trickle of doubt.Hed fight it, because he was the kind of man who would try to rationalize her behavior, see all the reasons behind the evil shed done.Pointless.Because in the end hed abhor her.Shed make sure of that.Of course I took it, Luc.That was the whole point.I was a thief and a liar.And I got enough money to get myself out of trouble and on a bus to California, and I left.Dennis Followed me.He found me a few months later.Id been kicked out of my apartment, my stuff had been stolen, and we started it all back up again.The nursing homes, the old guys with no family.And as soon as Id make enough to get myself out of trouble, I left.Again.And a few years later he found me.My mom was sick.There wasnt any money I get the idea Really?I doubt it.Because I did it four times, Luc!Four times I preyed on those men.I pretended to be something I wasnt so they would give me their money!Her voice shook in the rafters and she felt herself falling into pieces.Luc reached out to her and she stepped away, appalled that he would try to touch her.Why is Dennis here now?Lucs voice was careful, slow and sure, like bedrock under her feet, and she pulled herself back from the brink.II gave the money back to the last old man.I couldntI couldnt do it.Hed given me ten grand andI was twenty nine and sick of what I was doing.But Dennis was in trouble with some people and he needed to get out of town.When he found out Id given the money back, he beat me up.Put me in the hospital.Where I met Lyle.She saw the moment when her words hit home.His face sharpened, every inch of his fierce nature brought to bear against her, and she wanted to cower behind a lie, some fiction shed created to keep her distance from the ugliness of her past.But shed pulled down all her walls and she stood here, naked.You conned him.His words were a blowtorch against her skin.I told Lyle every single thing about myself, she said.I told him about the old guys and the money.And more.And more and more and more.But Luc would never know.Never.Luc was shaking his head, disbelieving, and she didnt blame him.And you read to him and you accepted his gifts No gifts.He gave me the job.Straight up.It was the truth; she had nothing else to offer Luc, nothing else to sway him.Hed believe her or not.Please, she thought, surprised that it mattered so much what this man thought of her.Please believe me.Please.So Dennis is here for the money?His voice gave away nothing and she fought the urge to scramble in front of him, offering justification.For you?You brought him here?He just got out of jail.Jail!She nodded and he swore.He needs money and then hell go.This was her hope, her fervent dream, but she doubted her words even as she said them.She would never get rid of Dennis, not unless she went to the police.How much?She bit her lips, the words none of your business on the tip of her tongue, but it was his business.By coming here, by bringing her long tail of poison with her, shed made Dennis everyones business.How much?he thundered.Two hundred thousand.The bonus?She nodded.Why havent you called the cops?This is extortion Are you kidding?What I did is called fraud.Dennis would and could put me in jail.How much did you take from these men?Including the ten grand You gave that back.She shook her head.Doesnt change the fact that I conned him into giving it to me.All told, around thirty grand.He whistled, and her stomach shook with guilt.I doubt anyone is going to put you in jail for thirty grand in gifts from men who were grateful for the company.Dennis got arrested for fraud.Sent to jail for five years for doing the same thing I did but with less money.Somehow I think they had more on Dennis than that.Tara was pretty sure of it too.Hed gotten busted a few times for stealing medication from the nursing homes and selling it on the street.He always had someone after him.Cops.Criminals.It hardly seemed to matter.Do you honestly think hell go away when you give him the money?She shook her head.This isthis is the cost of what I did, Luc.Bullshit, Tara.You want to make it right?Of course I do, Luc.Im paying Paying him money wont do anything.You know that.Youre not stupid.You want to make this right, man up and go to the cops.For a moment she let the coward in her scramble, searching for another way, but then she took a deep breath and took a good, hard look at the truth.She needed to go to the cops.That woman who Dennis had describedthe cowardwas it possible she could just choose to not be that woman?Could she choose to be better?The idea was like a light going on in a dark room.Right now, her own actionsnot a new name, a different jobcould change things for her.Forever.Suddenly the fear of going to jail was not as large as her hope that she could be different.Better.Someone she could be proud of.She could go to the cops.She didnt have to be scared and selfish Jane Simmons anymore.She could do the right thing.Her bones felt broken.Everything felt broken, as if telling this secret after so many years had blown a hole right through her.It was going to be hard work pulling herself back together.But she could do it.She would do it.Where is he now?Luc asked.Why?Why do you think?If youre not going to handle him, I will.Fear that hed go charging into this situation like John Wayne on skates made up her mind.This wasnt just about keeping herself safe anymore.She had an obligation to this family.Forget it, Luc.Theres no way youre going to go threaten a guy like Dennis.Hell take it as a challenge.I can handle it.Im sure you can, but your career might not.Your public image.Your family.Im going to go to the cops.Get a restraining order.Something.He stared at her a long time and like the guilty little con artist she was, she looked away, unable to meet his eyes, because she knew that the way he used to see her, as that woman of worth whod risen above a background too bad to speak of, was gone.That version of her couldnt survive this.Nothing could.It was why shed never told anyone except Lyle.You want me to go with you?I dont need a babysitter.I said Ill do it and Ill do it.Thats not what I meant.Right.This is my business, Luc.Im not going to get you any more tangled up in this.You sure as hell got my sister tangled up in it.I know.Im sorry.Im so sorry.I should go.Honestly, he wont bother you if Im not here.Youre staying.Its safe here.Luc Fine.Its none of my business.But dont be this proud.It doesnt make any sense.He was right.If she went home, there werent enough locks on her door to keep Dennis out.Okay.Thank you.The silence was thick and heavy, like being buried alive under pounds of her own dirt.Outrageously, she wanted to ask him if he hated her.Despised her.And she knew it was ridiculous to care; she certainly never had before.No other mans opinion had mattered, except for Lyles.For a second, she hung onto the idea that Lucs opinion mattered because he was Lyles son.Or maybe it was just the fact that shed told him the truth, and she was so desperate for forgiveness she was ready to look for it in him.But then he turned and walked away without another word, and the truth was impossible to ignore.His opinion mattered, because he mattered.Previously frozen and suddenly reckless with the painful spasms of feeling, her heart thudded a quiet agreement.19 Luc watched the sun come up on Tuesday morning, a pink glow in the east facing window that over time lost its rosiness and burned through every cloud in its way to becoming a bright globe suspended over the glass roof of the greenhouse.Tara Jean, her hair pulled back in a ponytail, a loose white T shirt blown against her stomach by the wind, walked across the gravel of the parking area like a woman headed toward a firing squad.
