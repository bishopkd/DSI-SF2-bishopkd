I have not seen them.And when she was finished, she began to write.Letters to friends and children.Letters to brothers and sisters and cousins.Letters to nieces, nephews and neighbours.And a letter to me.I read it sometimes when I am in the mood and, when I do, I am reminded of Allie on cold winter evenings, seated by a roaring fire with a glass of wine at her side, reading the letters I had written to her over the years.She kept them, these letters, and now I keep them, for she made me promise to do so.She said I would know what to do with them.She was right; I find I enjoy reading bits and pieces of them just as she used to.They intrigue me, for when I sift through them I realize that romance and passion are possible at any age.I see Allie now and know I've never loved her more, but as I read the letters, I come to understand that I have always felt the same way.I read them last three evenings ago, long after I should have been asleep.It was almost two o'clock when I went to the desk and found the stack of letters, thick and weathered.I untied the ribbon, itself almost half a century old, and found the letters her mother had hidden so long ago and those from afterwards.A lifetime of letters, letters professing my love, letters from my heart.I glanced through them with a smile on my face, picking and choosing, and finally opened a letter from our first anniversary.I read an excerpt:   When I see you now moving slowly with new life growing inside you I hope you know how much you mean to me, and how special this year has been.No man is more blessed than me, and I love you with all my heart.I put it aside and found another, this one from a cold evening thirty nine years ago:   Sitting next to you, while our youngest daughter sang off key in the school Christmas show, I looked at you and saw a pride that comes only to those who feel deeply in their hearts, and I knew that no man could be luckier than me.And after our son died, the one who resembled his mother It was the hardest time we ever went through, and the words still ring true today:   In times of grief and sorrow I will hold you and rock you, and take your grief and make it my own.When you cry, I cry, and when you hurt, I hurt.And together we will try to hold back the floods of tears and despair and make it through.I pause for just a moment, remembering him.He was four years old at the time, just a baby.I have lived twenty times as long as he, but if asked, I would have traded my life for his.It is a terrible thing to outlive your child, a tragedy I wish upon no one.They went on, this correspondence of life and love, and I read dozens more, some painful, most heart warming.By three o'clock I was tired, but I had reached the bottom of the stack.There was one letter remaining, the last one I wrote to her, and by then I knew I had to keep going.I lifted the seal and removed both pages.I put the second page aside and moved the first page into better light and began to read:   My dearest Allie,  The porch is silent except for the sounds that float from the shadows, and for once I am at a loss for words.It is a strange experience for me, for when I think of you and the life we have shared, there is much to remember.A lifetime of memories.But to put it into words?I am not a poet, and yet a poem is needed to fully express the way I feel about you.So my mind drifts and I remember thinking about our life together as I made coffee this morning.Kate was there, and so was Jane, and they both became quiet when I walked into the kitchen.I saw they'd been crying, and without a word I sat myself beside them at the table and held, their hands.And when I looked at them, I saw you from so long ago, the day we said goodbye.They resemble you and how you were then, beautiful and sensitive and wounded with the hurt that comes when something special is taken away.And for a reason I'm not sure I understand, I was inspired to tell them a story.I called Jeff and David into the kitchen, for they were here as well, and when the children were ready I told them about us and how you came back to me so long ago.I told them about our walk, and the crab dinner in the kitchen, and they listened with smiles when they heard about the canoe ride, and sitting in front of the fire with the storm raging outside.I told them about your mother warning us about Lon the next day they seemed as surprised as we were and yes, I even told them what happened later that day, after you went back to town.That part of the story has never left me, even after all this time.Even though you described it to me only once, I remember marvelling at the strength you showed that day.I still cannot imagine what was going through your mind when you walked into the lobby and saw Lon, or how it must have felt to talk to him.You told me that the two of you left the inn and sat on a bench by the old Methodist church, and that he held your hand, even as you explained that you must stay.I know you cared for him.And his reaction proves to me he cared for you as well.Even as you explained that you had always loved me, and that it wouldn't be fair to him, he did not release your hand.I know he was hurt and angry, and tried for almost an hour to change your mind, but when you stood firm and said, "I can't go back with you, I'm so sorry," he knew that your decision had been made.You said he simply nodded and the two of you sat together for a long time without speaking.I have always wondered what he was thinking as he sat with you, but I'm sure it was the same way I felt only a few hours before.And when he finally walked you to your car, you said he told you that I was a lucky man.He behaved as a gentleman would, and I understood then why your choice was so hard.I remember that when I finished the story, the room was quiet until Kate finally stood to embrace me."Oh, Daddy," she said with tears in her eyes, and though I expected to answer their questions, they did not ask any.Instead, they gave me something much more special.For the next four hours, each of them told me how much the two of us had meant to them growing up.One by one, they told stories about things I had long since forgotten.And by the end I was crying, because I realized how well we had done with raising them.I was so proud of them, and proud of you, and happy about the life we have led.And nothing will ever take that away.Nothing.I only wish you could have been here to enjoy it with me.After they left, I rocked in silence, thinking back on our life together.You are always here with me when I do so, at least in my heart, and it is impossible for me to remember a time when you were not a part of me.I do not know who I would have become had you never come back to me that day.I love you, Allie.I am who I am because of you.You are every reason, every hope and every dream I've ever had, and no matter what happens to us in the future, every day we are together is the greatest day of my life.I will always be yours.And, my darling, you will always be mine.Noah   I put the pages aside and remember sitting with Allie on our porch when she read this letter for the first time.It was late afternoon and the last remnants of the day were fading.The sky was slowly changing colour, and as I watched the sun go down I remember thinking about that brief, flickering moment when day suddenly turns into night.Dusk, I realized, is just an illusion, because the sun is either above the horizon or below it.And that means that day and night are linked in a way that few things are; there cannot be one without the other, yet they cannot exist at the same time.How would it feel, I remember wondering, to be always together, yet forever apart?I know the answer now.I know what it's like to be day and night now; always together, forever apart.THERE IS BEAUTY where we sit this afternoon, Allie and I.  This is the pinnacle of my life.The birds, the geese, float on the cool water, which reflects bits and pieces of their colours and makes them seem larger than they really are.Allie too is taken in by their wonder, and little by little we get to know each other again."It's good to talk to you.I find that I miss it, even when it hasn't been that long. "I am sincere and she knows this, but she is still wary.I am a stranger."Is this something we do often?"she asks."Do we sit here and watch the birds a lot?I mean, do we know each other well?""Yes and no.I think everyone has secrets, but we have been acquainted for years. "She looks to her hands, then mine.She thinks about this for a moment, her face at such an angle that she looks young again.We do not wear our rings.Again, there is a reason for this.She asks: "Were you ever married?"I nod."Yes. ""What was she like?"I tell the truth."She was my dream.She made me who I am, and holding her in my arms was more natural to me than my own heartbeat.I think about her all the time.Even now, when I'm sitting here, I think about her.There could never have been another. "She takes this in.I don't know how she feels about this.Finally she speaks softly, her voice angelic, sensual.I wonder if she knows I think these things."Is she dead?""My wife is alive in my heart.And she always will be," I answer."You still love her, don't you?""Of course.But I love many things.I love to sit here with you.I love to watch the osprey swoop towards the creek and find its dinner.I love to share the beauty of this place with someone I care about. "She is quiet for a moment.She looks away so I can't see her face.It has been her habit for years."Why are you doing this?"No fear, just curiosity.This is good.I know what she means, but I ask anyway."What?""Why are you spending the day with me?"I smile."I'm here because this is where I'm supposed to be.It's not complicated.Both you and I are enjoying ourselves.Don't dismiss my time with you it's not wasted.It's what I want.I sit here and we talk and I think to myself, What could be better than what I am doing now?"She looks me in the eyes, and for a moment, just a moment, her eyes twinkle.A slight smile forms on her lips."I like being with you, but if getting me intrigued is what you're after you've succeeded.I admit I enjoy your company, but I know nothing about you.I don't expect you to tell me your life story, but why are you so mysterious?""I read once that women love mysterious strangers. ""See, you haven't really answered the question.You haven't answered most of my questions.You didn't even tell me how the story ended this morning. "I shrug.We sit quietly for a while.Finally I ask: "Is it true that women love mysterious strangers?"She thinks about this and laughs.Then she answers as I would: "I think some women do. ""Do you?""Now don't go putting me on the spot.I don't know you well enough for that. "She is teasing me and I enjoy it.We sit and watch the world around us.This has taken us a lifetime to learn.It seems only the old are able to sit next to one another and not say anything and still feel content.The young, brash and impatient, must always break the silence.It is a waste, for silence is pure.Silence is holy.It draws people together because only those who are comfortable with each other can sit without speaking.This is the great paradox.Time passes, and gradually our breathing begins to coincide.Deep breaths, relaxed breaths, and there is a moment when she dozes off, like those comfortable with one another often do.When she wakes, a miracle: "Do you see that bird?"She points to it, and I strain my eyes.It is a wonder I can see it, but I can because the sun is bright."Caspian stern," I say softly, and we devote our attention to it as it glides over Brices Creek.And, like an old habit rediscovered, when I lower my arm, I put my hand on her knee and she doesn't make me move it.SHE IS RIGHT about my evasiveness.On days like these, when only her memory is gone, I am vague in my answers because I've hurt my wife unintentionally with careless slips of my tongue many times these past few years, and I am determined not to let it happen again.So I limit myself and answer only what is asked, to limit the pain.There are days she never learns of her children or that we are married.I am sorry for this, but I will not change.Does this make me dishonest?Perhaps, but I have seen her crushed by the waterfall of information that is her life.Could I look myself in the mirror without red eyes and quivering jaw and know I have forgotten all that was important to me?I could not and neither can she, for when this odyssey began, that is how I began.Her life, her marriage, her children.Her friends and her work.The days were hard on both of us.I was an encyclopedia, an object without feeling, of the whos, whats and wheres in her life, when in reality it is the whys, the things I did not know and could not answer, that make it all worth while.She would stare at pictures of forgotten offspring, hold paintbrushes that inspired nothing, and read love letters that brought back no joy.She would weaken over the hours, growing paler, becoming bitter and ending the day worse than when it began.Our days were lost and so was she.So I changed.I learned what is obvious to a child.That life is simply a collection of little lives, each lived one day at a time.That each day should be spent finding beauty in flowers and poetry and talking to animals.That a day spent with dreaming and sunsets and refreshing breezes cannot be bettered.But most of all, I learned that life is for sitting on benches next to ancient creeks with my hand on her knee and sometimes, on good days, for falling in love."WHAT ARE you thinking?"she asks.It is now dusk.We have left our bench and are shuffling along lighted paths that wind their way around this complex.She is holding my arm and I am her escort.It is her idea to do this.Perhaps she is charmed by me.Perhaps she wants to keep me from falling.Either way, I am smiling to myself."I'm thinking about you. "She makes no response to this except to squeeze my arm, and I can tell she likes what I said.Our life together has enabled me to see the clues, even if she does not know them herself.I go on: "I know you can't remember who you are, but I can, and I find that when I look at you it makes me feel good. "She taps my arm and smiles."You're a kind man with a loving heart.I hope I enjoyed you as much before as I do now. "I think about this as we walk in silence, holding each other, past the rooms, past the courtyard.We come to the garden, mainly wild flowers, and I stop her.I pick a bundle red, pink, yellow, violet.I give them to her, and she brings them to her nose.She smells them with eyes closed and she whispers, "They're beautiful. "We resume our walk, me in one hand, the flowers in another.People watch us, for we are a walking miracle, or so I am told.It is true in a way.By the time we reach the doorway, I am tired.She knows this, so she stops me with her hand and makes me face her.I do, and I realize how hunched over I have become.She and I are now level.Sometimes I am glad she doesn't know how much I have changed.She turns to me and stares for a long time."What are you doing?"I ask."I don't want to forget you or this day, and I'm trying to keep your memory alive. "Will it work this time?I wonder, then know it will not.It can't.I do not tell her my thoughts, though.I smile instead because her words are sweet."Thank you," I say."I mean it.I don't want to forget you again.You're very special to me.I don't know what I would have done without you today. "My throat closes a little.There is emotion behind her words, the emotions I feel whenever I think of her.I know this is why I live, and I love her dearly at this moment.How I wish I were strong enough to carry her in my arms to paradise."Don't try to say anything," she tells me."Let's just feel the moment. "And I do, and I feel heaven.HER DISEASE is worse now than it was in the beginning, though Allie is different from most.There are three others with the disease here, and they are the sum of my practical experience of it.They, unlike Allie, are in the most advanced stages of Alzheimer's and are almost completely lost.They wake up hallucinating and confused.They repeat themselves over and over.Seldom do they recognize the people who love them.It is a trying disease, and this is why it is hard for their children and mine to visit.Allie, of course, has her own problems.She is terribly afraid in the mornings and cries inconsolably.She sees tiny people, like gnomes, I think, watching her, and she screams at them to get away.She bathes willingly but will not eat regularly.She is thin now, much too thin in my opinion, and on good days I do my best to fatten her up.But this is where the similarity ends.This is why Allie is considered a miracle, because sometimes, just sometimes, after I read to her, her condition isn't so bad.There is no explanation for this."It's impossible," the doctors say, "she cannot have Alzheimer's. "But she does.On most days and every morning there can be no doubt.But why, then, is her condition different?Why does she sometimes change after I read?I tell the doctors the reason I know it in my heart, but I am not believed.Four times specialists have travelled from Chapel Hill to find the answer.Four times they have left without understanding.I tell them, "You can't possibly understand it if you use only your science training and your books," but they shake their heads and answer: "Alzheimer's does not work like this.With her condition, it's just not possible to have a conversation or improve as the day goes on.Ever. "But she does.Not every day, not most of the time, and definitely less than she used to.But sometimes.And all that is gone on these days is her memory, as if she has amnesia.Her emotions are normal, her thoughts are normal.And these are the days that I know I am doing right.DINNER IS WAITING in her room when we return.It has been arranged for us to eat here, as it always is on days like these, and once again I could ask for no more.The people here are good to me and I am thankful.The lights are dimmed, the room is lit by two candles on the table where we will sit, and music is playing softly in the background.The cups and plates are plastic and the carafe is filled with apple juice, but rules are rules and she doesn't seem to care.She inhales slightly at the sight.Her eyes are wide."Did you do this?"I nod and she walks into the room."It looks beautiful. "I offer my arm in escort and lead her to the window.She doesn't release it when we get there.Her touch is nice, and we stand close together on this crystal springtime evening.The window is open slightly and I feel a breeze as it fans my cheek.The moon has risen and we watch for a long time as the evening sky unfolds."I've never seen anything so beautiful, I'm sure of it," she says."I haven't, either," I say, but I am looking at her.She knows what I mean and I see her smile.A moment later she whispers: "I think I know who Allie went with at the end of the story. ""Who?""She went with Noah. ""You're sure?""Absolutely. "I smile and nod."Yes, she did," I say softly, and she smiles back, her face radiant.She sits and I sit opposite her.She offers her hand across the table and I take it in mine, and I feel her thumb begin to move as it did so many years ago.I stare at her for a long time, living and reliving the moments of my life, remembering it all and making it real.I feel my throat begin to tighten and once again I realize how much I love her.My voice is shaky when I finally speak."You're so beautiful," I say.I can see in her eyes that she knows how I feel about her and what I really mean by my words.She does not respond.Instead she lowers her eyes and I wonder what she's thinking.She gives me no clues and I gently squeeze her hand.I wait.I know her heart and I know I'm almost there.And then a miracle that proves me right.As Glenn Miller plays softly in a candlelit room, I watch as she gradually gives in to the feelings inside her.I see a warm smile begin to form on her lips, the kind that makes it all worth while, and I watch as she raises her hazy eyes to mine.
