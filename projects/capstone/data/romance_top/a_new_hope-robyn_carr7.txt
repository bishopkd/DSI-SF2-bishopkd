Dont waste the years like I did.Remember him sweetly.Let him rest.Go forward and have his brothers and sisters.She nodded, looking down, tears falling on her hands.Let me drive you.Ive arranged for a day off.No one knows why, not even Ray.Just let me drive you, keep you safe.She looked up.Please, she said softly.This is mine to do.I promise you Ill be all right.He gave her a look of acquiescence.Come here, angel, he said, pulling her against his big hard chest.She leaned against him and cried for a little while, but not for too long.He just stroked her back until the tears passed.Im okay, Al.Just a tough day, thats all.And I willlet it pass, let him rest.I have a lot ahead thats good.She sniffed and reached for a tissue.Yes, you do, he said, running her pretty hair behind her ear.Would it be all right if I called you tomorrow night?Just to be sure youre okay?Yes.Sure.But I promise you...I might need a couple of days to be done with this but I promise you, Im not going back to that dark place I was in when Ray Anne rescued me.That wouldnt exactly do my baby proud, would it?* * * Matt had to get a map from the mortuary office so that he could find the right grave.The security patrol had no trouble finding the location and handed a copy to Matt.He was not at all surprised to see Gingers car parked along the road.And there she was, sitting on the cool grass about forty feet from the road.He took the flowers from his mothers garden to the spot, walking past Ginger to put them on the grave.There were lots of flowers already there.She looked up at him.Did someone tell you?Call you?He shook his head, then crouched to her level, sitting on the heel of his boot.No one called.No one told me.Then why are you here?she asked, wiping a tear.Matt sighed and sat on the ground.Youve been blue and I thought I might find you here.If you werent here I would have just left these flowers from our garden to mark the day of his death.Im not surprised to see you but you couldve told me.You can tell me anything, you know.You just...came?You just...How did you know?You went inside yourself, he said, wiping a tear from her cheek.I could think of a few possibilities.So I went to the newspaper archives online and found the obit.I wanted to pay my respects.I wasnt hiding it from you.I know, baby.Come here, he said, stretching out his long legs and pulling her onto his lap.I know itll take a little time for us to know everything about each other but thats okay.I think weve got the important stuff covered for now.Like what?she said, laying her head on his shoulder.Whats important?You love me, he said.I dont have the best instincts with women but with you I feel differentlike I know what you say is absolutely true.And I know I meant it when I said it to you.And I trust you.When you got quiet and wouldnt tell me why I figured it was something you were still working out.You dont have to say anything.But Im listening when youre talking.Okay?Okay, she said.It was the worst day of my life.I can believe that...I called the paramedics.I tried to breathe for him, but it was too late.Sometimes I pulled him into bed with me but not that night.That night I put him in his crib where he died without my warmth close by.Part of me wishes I had him in bed with me, but then I would forever worry that I rolled over on him, suffocated him.And part of me is relieved he wasnt in bed because then I didnt hurt him...So the paramedics came and didnt even try anything because he was gone, hed been gone for a while.They let me hold him and we went to the hospital.I think they were breaking rules.I saw one of them crying; he was trying to hide it, but he had wet eyes and kept wiping them.At the hospital they asked for him and I wouldnt give him up and I wailed.I went to the hospital in pajamas and not just any pajamas, the worst pajamas ever worn by the lowest vagrantand I saved them, the pajamas.I saved his little onesie.And I wailed like a wounded animal and they had to give me a shot to get me to let go of the baby, of Josh.Matt started to rock her slightly, holding on tight, his lips against her hair.It was terrifying how crazed I was.And when they took him I couldnt really believe he was dead.They did an autopsy, did you know?Because they had to make sure it wasnt a disease or a homicide and oh, God...She shook her head.When I was able to see him again I didnt believe it was him but I didnt say anything because I knew they were this close to locking me up for being a lunatic.He kissed her temple.Do you believe it now?he asked in a whisper.She nodded.Yes.My baby died.There it is.It was no ones fault.He wasnt even a high risk baby or in a high risk lifestyle.Our pediatrician had two SIDS cases in his entire career and he was no kid.She turned to look up at him.Sometimes I wish I could just die like that.Matt shook his head.No, sweetheart, no.Were going to go forward.We have things to live for, Im sure of it.Thats what Al said, she said.Go forward and have his brothers and sisters.Thats a good idea.Youd do that?With me?she asked him.Sure.When were ready.Theres plenty of time.Make sure its what you want.Make sure Im what you want.She put her fingers on his lips.Matt, I never thought Id have a man like you in my life.She smiled weakly.I sure didnt think so at Peytons wedding when you went for my boob.Ah, a defining moment.Impressive, wasnt I?Drunk and clumsy, she said.Yeah, but Im persistent.Im with you now.What do you want to do, sweetheart?Stay here awhile?Go to my place and rest a little bit?I just want to go home, she said.I need to go back to my life.Will I see you this weekend?Im taking you home, honey.Youre following me?No.Driving you.You follow me to U Haul.Its not far.Im going to rent a half trailer, hook your car up and tow you.Well ride together.We can hold hands and talk.Or not talk, if youre feeling quiet.You can sleep a littlegrieving wears a person out.Well stop for a good meal because I bet you didnt eat...Als going to be jealous.He wanted to drive me.He needs to watch it, Matt said teasingly.This is my territory now.It is, isnt it?I should mind being called territory, but I dont.Youll be missed on the farm...No, its all good.No ones expecting me, but Ill make a call, let Mama know Im busy.Shell tell Paco and George.Do they know about me?That Im damaged?That my baby died and Im so damaged?I havent told them the particulars, just that you needed me today.You can tell them someday if you feel like it.He stood up and held out a hand to help her to her feet.You ready or do you want more time here?Im ready, she said.Matt hated to put her in the car to drive even a short distance.Ginger never mentioned him, not even once, but Matt thought about himthat loser, Mick.He probably changed his name to Mick to be like Jagger.He should have been with her when that baby died.And even though Matt didnt want him anywhere near her ever again, he should be here now, propping her up, supporting her.He should cry that his son died.Matt hated him.* * * Ginger did sleep a little on the way back to Thunder Point.They stopped just outside Eugene at a homey little country restaurant that also sold hams and pies.Ginger had a bowl of soup with crackers and half a sandwich while Matt, no doubt concerned about getting enough to eat when they got back to that little loft, indulged in a large meat loaf and potato dinner.She called her parents, explaining shed been to the cemetery and her suspicions were righttheyd made a visit early that morning and left a bouquet.She had planned to visit Joshs grave alone, spend a couple of hours and leave, not feeling like seeing people.Then she explained Matt being there, taking her back home.I didnt tell him Id be there and if hed asked to come with me I wouldve said I wanted to be alone, she said to her mother.But Im so glad he was there.And it turned out to be the right thing for me.Then she slept a little more.He unhooked the tow bar and parked her car behind the flower shop while she went upstairs.Once she was in her secure little loft apartment, she called Ray Anne and asked her to relay to Al that she was fine.I went to the cemetery today to put flowers on his little grave, and Matt came.He guessed I might be there.He brought his own flowers.It was so lovely that hed do that without being asked, without being needed.Oh, baby, Ray Anne singsonged.And now?Feeling all right?Feeling a little wrung out, honestly.But Ill sleep tonight and tomorrow Ill be so happy to get back to my flowers and friends.Unbelievably, that was the truth.She needed that pilgrimage to Portland.She wished there was more by way of closure, but that was as good as it was going to get.She was beginning to understand that there was nothing she could do, no ritual that could make the feelings go away.The sadness would just have to leave her with time as replaced by new feelings.Remembering him, his sweet little face, that belonged to her.Matt said he had no instincts where women were concerned, but she was amazed by them.He seemed to give her plenty of space while staying near.At about eight that night he went out for ice cream, which they ate in bed, then they talked a little while about ordinary thingsshe wanted to know about the grapes and pears.He wanted to know about her flowers and Graces mother.He told her theyd be breeding sheep at Georges in the late fall.He was slated to teach a few classes as a visiting professor in the fall after the harvest.She was looking forward to the harvest celebrations and food.At the first light of dawn Ginger woke to the gentle stroke of Matts rough hand on her upper arm.She turned to him and smiled.How do you feel?he asked.Okay.You?He just nodded.If you think youll be all right, I should get back to the farm.Of course.Thank you.Im glad I was there.I meant, thank you for going to his grave even though I might not have been there.He wasnt part of your life.That was one of the nicest things anyone has done for me.Youre part of my life, he said.Ill talk to you tonight.He pulled on his clothes and slid out the door quietly.A New Hope        Fourteen Lin Su got into the car to go to Winnies house.Her son was already in the passenger seat, his backpack in the back.I brought you a clean shirt, she told Charlie.After you knock around the beach and town all day, were having dinner with Winnie and her family because Im taking a turn at cooking.Theyd like you to come, too.You dont usually cook, he said, pushing his glasses up on his nose.Youre right, I dont.But this is a very unusual job.Im the nursing help but the whole family is around.Usually when Im the nursing help, its just me and the patient with maybe one or two other relatives checking in.And then when I came with you, I could just watch TV, he said.True enough, she thought.Her patient would usually be in the bedroom and as long as Charlie didnt mess up the house, kept the volume very low and didnt eat their food, he could tag along and no one knew the difference.Troy said you can watch the TV in their game room downstairs as long as you dont mess up the house.You can use your computer just about anywhere, upstairs or downyou can jump on their Wi Fi.Not too much computer or TV, though.We have to stay out of the way of these people or Ill lose my job.Actually, Troy had not been specific about the messy house or about the amount of time Charlie spent watching TV.He had said Charlie was welcome in the house whenever he wanted or needed to be.Im an expert at staying out of the way...And do I have to tell you how bad it would be if I lost my job?No, he said.I think I get it.His tone was sarcastic as theyd been over this a thousand times.She went over it once more.Money was tight.Very tight.A nurse didnt earn enough to support a family.A single parent had a lot of trouble making ends meet.She never said it aloud but the truth was, they lived on the edge of poverty in an old rented trailer in a crappy mobile home park.She hated leaving Charlie at home; their neighborhood was rough.Having him around Thunder Point so she could check on him now and then was much better.So, theres a clean shirt.You can wash up and put on a clean shirt for dinner.Be sure to wipe up the bathroom behind yourself...Why are you cooking?he asked.I offered.Everyone was choosing a night to cook, even Mikhail, the old Russian.God knows what that will be...Maybe borscht, he offered.Lin Su laughed.He was so funny sometimes.She looked over at him.So small, so nerdy.So adorable.What are you doing today?Any plans?He shrugged.Ill be busy on and off.Troy and Spencer dont mind having me around.Troy said he might put me to work.When its not busy in Coopers its okay if I get a table inside and use my laptop.I get out of there if a lot of people come in.And if Im charged up, I can always use it in the car.Dont worry, okay?No one knows how to stay out of the way like me.Her vision blurred slightly.Charlie...Dont get emotional, okay?Because were fine.Everything is temporary.Not too temporary, I hope.Mrs.Banks is holding her own and with any luck shell be with us a good long while.Its a nice place to work.You have money?Never used the money you gave me two days ago.Howd you buy lunch?Didnt have to, he said.I was hanging out at the dock and Troy made us sandwiches.I told him I had money for lunch and he said it wasnt necessary.I could have made you lunch, she said.I could have made something while I was fixing Mrs.Bankss lunch.Or while she napped.Charlie sighed.He made it in the same kitchen, Mom.Were good.Did you ask what was in it?I checked, Mom.It wasnt peanut butter or anything like that.You have to relax.She took a breath.You have your inhaler?EpiPen?Sunscreen?Vitamins?Power bars and fruit drinks?He glanced at her.He pushed his glasses up on his nose again.Yeah, I guess you have everything, she said.I think Troy or Landon might take me out on the paddleboard today.Oh, Charlie...Its okay so dont freak.Im not falling in or anything.She appreciated that he wasnt paranoid about his fragile health but she thought one plunge into the cold Pacific could bring on an asthma attack or bronchitis or pneumonia.I havent been sick, he reminded her, reading her mind.Last winter, she said.I didnt go to the hospital and I havent had asthma attacks or allergic reactions.Not too many, anyway.I had a doctor who said there was a good chance Id grow out of it and even though I havent grown that much, Im leaving all that shit behind.Your language, she said.Is entirely appropriate, he argued.Its all a lot of shit and you know it.She completely understood the attitude.It wasnt just his disgust with chronic illness, it was also his impatience with a mother who watched every bite he took, every move he made, listening to every breath.In fact, those days she started out tired were usually caused by her inability to sleep, listening to him snoring or wheezing or the whistling of his sinuses.There had been times during the first ten years of his life that hed been so sick, so weak and fragile, that she feared losing him.Complicated allergies, a weak immune system and asthma conspired against him, leaving him vulnerable to infections and viruses.It was truein the past few years hed gotten stronger.It was also true that she hadnt relaxed enough yet.But what mother wouldnt understand sitting vigil at the bedside of a small boy in an oxygen tent?Shed lost years of her life every time he was hospitalized.Shed felt so alone.That wasnt fair, she reminded herself.In the fourteen years since Charlie had been born there had been good friends here and there, coworkers or neighbors.Theyd had to move around too much for a lot for reasons ranging from rent to changes in work, but shed always known good people along her way.Shed been working in the small hospital in Bandon when they moved into the trailer park.When the hospital downsized, laying off a few nurses and staff, Dr.Grant suggested this job to her if she was willing to make the drive.Ha!Willing?Shed be willing to walk it!She was interviewed by Dr.Grant and his wife, Peyton, but then it was the patient herself who chose her, with Grace sitting in on the interview.When I do a background check, what will I learn about you?Winnie had asked her.She wasnt surprised by the question.People who could afford a private nurse were usually well off, worried about having their property plundered.So she answered, I prefer private home health care when theres a need for me.When theres no job in the private sector I work in hospitals or clinics.Im good at what I do and have an excellent job record.And why dont you work for an agency?She shook her head.They dont pay well.The patient will pay the agency a substantial amount of money for the luxury of having a bonded health care worker but pay the actual professional very poorly.And then theyll move the nurses aroundnot good for the nurse or the patient.The irony isthe bond wont get you much.Who cares about bond?Find a professional who checks out instead.After a dozen years, I have references you can call.Theyll tell you if I did my job well.Theyll tell you Im trustworthy.And Im not limited to a shift or specific number of hours.I can be your primary caregiver.Provided you want me to be.Winnie had agreed to give her a month on trial but within two weeks she was established as permanent.And now Charlie was a part of the family, as well.Lin Su didnt know if that made her happy or scared to death.* * * Charlie liked the beach area, even if he did stay out of the sunhis own preference because he didnt want his laptop to overheat.And he stayed sheltered if there was a wind.It wasnt easy for him to make friends as a rule, but the area around Mrs.Bankss house where his mom was working was populated with kids younger than he was and their parents.That made it easier.On this morning, there was a pretty brisk breeze and not too many people around.He sat on the steps right off Troys patio where he was out of the wind.He got his laptop out of his backpack and, holding it on his knees, fired it up.He logged onto Troys Wi Fi and brought up a TED Talk on astronomy that hed listened to about ten times.Can astronomers help doctors?He loved TED Talks.It broke everything down into understandable terms.He was particularly interested in medicine but he didnt dare tell his mom that.Shed start to freak out about the cost of college or something.He was a little lost in the video when a shadow crossed in front of him.He looked up to see a guy two steps up moving toward him, grinning.Well, Ill be damned, the guy said.If youre just going to kick sand in my face, get it over with, Charlie thought.The guy was big.He had a little sandy colored whisker growth on his chin and cheeks and hairy legs sticking out of his board shorts.He did wear glasses, at least.I wouldnt have believed it if I hadnt seen it with my own eyes.A computer nerd on the beach.Charlie slowly lowered the screen.Whats wrong with that?The guy let his backpack drop off his shoulder, lifted the flap and pulled out a shiny silver laptop.Not a thing, my man.I just thought I was the only one.Come on, lets go to Coopers.Im okay here, he said, embarrassed by his shyness.Come on, he said again.Im meeting some people.Well get a drink.Juice or something.Well open up the computers for a few minutes till they get here.And then he walked off, stuffing his computer into his backpack, willing Charlie to follow.Which he did.He figured if the guy was going to kidnap him or beat him up, he wouldnt do it in front of Cooper.At least he was reasonably sure.By the time he got up the beach stairs the guys stuff was all set up at a corner table out of the breeze on the deck but he wasnt there.Charlie stood there in indecision.Then the guy appeared from inside, still smiling, a bottled juice in each hand.He handed one to Charlie and indicated he should sit down.Whats your name, kid?Charlie, he said.Im Frank, the guy said, sticking out his hand for a shake.New in town?I. ..uh...My mom works for Mrs.Banks...Ohthe new lady?ALS, I heard.Charlie nodded.Frank clicked away at his keyboard while Charlie just sat there.Then he pushed up his glasses and read the label on the plastic bottle.Allergies?Frank asked.Peanuts, shellfish and insect bites.You carry an Epi?Uh huh.That juice is okay.No additives.No MSG, no artificial sweetners, no gluten or corn syrup.Oh, Charlie said.Thanks.Sowhat are you doing on the computer?Games?I have a few games, yeah.You?I have some papers to read.Youre a teacher?He laughed.No, a student.Im reading some published papers for researchphysics, mainly.And astronomy.Have you heard the term astrophysics?Charlie nodded, feeling a little better about everything.The guy didnt look like a nerd even if he was wearing glasses.Kind of thick ones.The study of physics as it applies to heavenly bodies.He opened up his laptop, clicked it back to life and turned the screen toward Frank, showing him the TED Talk.Frank grinned and said, You are my brother.Ive seen that one.How old are you?Fourteen, he answered, fighting the blush.Im short for my age.He had rejected the word small, even if it was accurate.So was I, Frank said.Youre not anymore.I guess you grew.Frank chuckled.I have an older brother, big jock.He got all the testosterone in the family.I think he was shaving in the sixth grade.I started shaving two or three weeks ago.I was small, skinny, nerdy.No way.Way.You get beat up a lot?Charlie asked.Frank frowned at the question.I had a couple of secret weapons.There was my brother, for one thing.But also I helped kids with their homework all the time.Kept me safe.Why are you listening to that video?You like astronomy?Yeah.I like science.Where are you a student?MIT, he said.To be an astrophysicist?he asked, in awe.Physics is my study but I love astronomy so Im looking at it, but who knows?Im not even two years in yet.You live here when youre not at MIT?Charlie asked.Im home for a visitjust a few weeks.Im getting ready for fall.How about you?What are you headed for?Im headed for being a freshman if I live that long and no one beats me senseless for being a nerd, Charlie thought.I start high school in the fall.So I dont know.You know what you like, though, right?Science.Math.Star Trek and House.He laughed.A Trekkie doctor, I like it.Troy came outside with a cup of coffee.Oh, God, there are two of you!Frank laughed and looked back at his screen.You have your laptop out half the time, he accused Troy.Schoolwork, young man.There was the sound of whooping and laughter wafting across the bay.And here come the women, Frank said.Two young women were approaching on paddleboards from the marina side of the bay.Do you know when Landon and Cooper are going to get here?Soon, Troy said.But theres not enough wind on the bay yet.There will be, Frank said.Stick around, Charlie.Were going to have some fun today.Windsurfing.Really?he asked a little excitedly.Well, Ill be windsurfing.No one else has done it yet.Coopers renting us some equipment.I dont know how you talked him into that, Troy said with a laugh.He said if it works he might turn it into a business opportunity.That explains it.By the way, Ive been windsurfing.Badly, but Ive done it, Troy said.As the women got closer to the shore in front of Coopers, Frank put away his laptop, got up and went down the steps to greet them.He left the backpack on the deck by his chair.The women were wearing wet suits with long sleeves and were covered down to their knees.And they were gorgeous.They pulled their paddleboards up onto the sand, Frank lending a hand.Those are not women, Troy advised.Frank kissed the redhead.On their way to becoming women.On their way fast, Id say.But theyre still girls.They never had girls like that when I was his age, Troy muttered.Landons truck came across the sand to Coopers.The bed was full of equipment.And as if Frank commanded the heavens, the wind immediately picked up.And the beach became a swarm of activity.Equipment was unloaded.Landon pulled on a wet suit.There seemed to be some assembling required.Troy locked the back door of the bar and wandered down to the beach.Charlie could see that the windsurfing boards were slightly lighter and trimmer than the paddleboards.Frank pushed off, Landon close behind him, and they paddled out into the bay.Frank, on his knees, raised his sail and it sat for a moment, then a small gust took it and he stood tentatively, turning the sail into the wind and he was off, skidding across the bay.The girls screeched and whooped happily.Charlie stood up to watch from Coopers deck.Landon was struggling to get up, to adjust his sail, and in he went.He got himself back on the board, tried again, went into the ocean again.Every time he got dunked the girls howled with laughter.On his fourth try he got up and the cheers were wild.He turned his sail into the wind and blew across the bay.Where he fell again and everyone laughed.Spencer came outside; Mikhail wandered down the beach.Spencers son and daughter were at the waters edge, waving and splashing with their feet.The girls with the paddleboards pushed off the shore and paddled out into the water just to get a closer view.Landon and Frank were gliding all around the bay, leaning into turns, leaning away, shifting their sails into the wind.For a little while they sailed in tandem, like twins.God, that must feel good, Charlie thought.Cooper was beside him.Go on down there, Charlie, he said.Charlie was on his way instantly.Then he stopped.I should take my backpack and laptop to my moms car or something...Forget itIll put your backpack and Franks behind the bar where it wont get overheated or...lost.Thanks, he said, racing down the stairs to watch.Watching Frank and Landon out there was amazing, and made Charlie long for things he had no business longing for.Impossible thingslike an active life filled with people like these crazy people.He looked over his shoulder once and noticed that his mom had Mrs.Banks out on the deck, watching.As interesting as what happened out on the water was, what was happening on the beach was even cooler.More and more people were walking down the beach to watch.Sarah Cooper came down in a wet suit and demanded her time on Landons board and that woman knew what she was doingshe got way out on the bay and that sail was putty in her hands.She was whipping it all over the place, leaping out of the water a few times.As if watching a circus performance, the voices in the crowd rose in excitement.One of the guys Charlie had seen around town, a guy named Al, was down there with a couple of his sons, grumbling that another new sport was going to cost him while the boys begged to try it.Pretty soon there were six paddleboards on the water, some of them sitting idle to watch the windsurfing, some paddling around the inner bay while the surfers were flying around the outer bay.The sheriffs deputy drove his cruiser out on the beach; there were a few folks there in all terrain vehicles like Rhinos and RZRs.The windsurfer boards changed passengers everyone wanted a turn.Sarah Cooper turned from surfer into instructor along with Frank, and the girls finally got their turn.Then Troy and Spencer had a chance; Troy didnt embarrass himself too badly but Spencer was great entertainment.A group of cyclists rode onto the beach from the town and stood watching for a while.There were ten of them.They looked like serious cyclists, their gear expensive, their team patches flashy.They looked like such studs to Charlielegs like tree trunks, leather gloves, fancy helmets and Ray Bans.Those bikesthey were amazing, sleek, mega expensive cycles.These were either long distance riders or racers.He decided to read about it later.The beach grew crowded, Coopers was full, hours flew by.Charlie wondered if half the town had shut their businesses down to see what was going on.Want to go out on the paddleboard?Landon said to Charlie.Huh?Yeah, can we?You a good swimmer?He didnt swim at all, as a matter of fact.Not that good, he said, shaking his head.Thats okaywell get a jacket.And we wont go out too far.Your mom say it was okay?Sure, he lied.Lose the shoes and socks, Landon said.Then he jogged off to the beach level under the bar where they stored kayaks, boards and equipment.He jogged back with a jacket for Charlie, helped him suit up.Sorry I dont have a wet suit thatll fit you.My advice?Dont fall in.And dont lose your glasses, okay?Gotcha, he said.Landon pushed out the board just a little bit, got Charlie kneeling in the right spot then got on his knees behind Charlie, then up to a standing position.You good?he asked.Good!Charlie said.It wasnt a wild ride by any means, but it was exhilarating.He watched the windsurfersnow it was Ashley and Frank, and Ashley was struggling to stay on the upside of the water.He saw the beach full of people as he glided by.Troy was talking with the cyclists, checking out their bikes.Eve, Landons girlfriend, paddled out to glide alongside Landon and she had Austin, Spencers boy, sitting on her board.Austin wore a life jacket, as well, and Charlie decided right then and there, he was somehow going to learn to swim.He wasnt sure how, but he was going to.Can I stand up?he asked Landon.I dont know, can you?Landon asked.I think I can.Ill be careful.Dont fall in.That waters cold.Im not planning to, Charlie said.And he got to his feet awkwardly, standing against Landon for balance.Problem is, I cant paddle with you standing in front of me, Landon said.I could try.Okay, but just for a second.Okay?Charlie took the paddle and clumsily dipped it into the water on the right side, then the left, and after about four strokes his arms ached.And shook.Okay, thats all of that, Landon said.Youre not quite ready for that, but Im sure youll get there.Get back down so I can get us in.Not yet, okay?Charlie begged.Landon laughed.Okay, champ, well take a couple more turns.It was the best day of his life.Troy called him to go inside and wash up for dinner.He had to fetch his backpack and his clean shirt.His mother made that eggplant thing that people loved, but Charlie didnt love it.He ate a lot, however.Hed completely forgotten lunch and was starving.Everyone at the table seemed completely charmed by his appetite except his mother, who was a little put out.So to make up for it, he helped with cleanup while his mom settled Winnie in her room for the night.He didnt mind.He and Troy talked about the day, about all the things that went on at the beach in the summer when the weather was good.And in the fall during football season when most of the teenagers gathered on the beach for their parties and bonfires.Then he had to struggle to stay awake, waiting in the great room for his mom.Finally at about eight, she was finished.Troy and Grace were out on the deck so Lin Su said goodbye to them, then locked the front door behind them when they went to the car.They had driven a little while when she said, You had a very big day.Im not sure you were careful of your health.I was totally careful, Charlie said.Then he yawned.You ever think about moving here?To Thunder Point?She laughed softly.We cant afford to live in Thunder Point.Well, we can be poor anywhere.And you said Mrs.Banks is doing good.Well, she corrected.Shes doing well.We should think about it.Troy said its a good high school.He yawned.Then moments later his mother woke him to go inside to bed.Hed slept the whole way home.A New Hope        Fifteen Ginger blossomed with the flush of true love.She had Matt on the weekends and because of that fact Grace was more than willing to work by herself on Saturdays.But with the onset of August the days of summer were fast coming to a close for farmers.She cherished every second she could lie in his arms because she knew that soon his time would be at a premium.I have an important question, he said to her.It was Saturday morning and there was no reason to get up early, except to eat.Soon they might starve, she thought.You have me in a very vulnerable position.Ill probably say yes to anything now.Its a serious question, he said.Sounds grim.Will you stick with me through the harvest?he asked.How she loved looking into those black eyes when he was serious.It sounds like Im not going to see very much of you.Well manage somehow.Ill come to Portland and if you cant get away I might come to Portland a lot.You understand we work seven days a week...Do you work after dark?she asked with a twinkle in her eye.We sleep the sleep of the dead after dark, he told her.Ill still feel your body close to mine.She ran her hand over his chest and down.Then she laughed and stopped her hand.Somethings funny, miss?Not so much funny as remarkable.If I keep touching you Ill never get breakfast!Yes, Matt, Ill still be your girl when all the pears are in.Weekend after next we go to Sals vineyard.At least its closer to you than the farm, but I wont have very much time.Ill try to spend a night or two with you.Do you need my help with the grapes?she asked.Im sure Id be good with themI do specialize in flowers.Id like to say yes but in fact it might be a distraction.Not because Id keep touching you when we should be picking grapes but because these early grapes are fragile and only trained hands can deal with them.The later grapes, the ones that come after the pears, theyre heartier.Grapes, pears, grapes again...She kissed him.A girl hardly stands a chance.Throw the potatoes in there, too.But we hire harvesters for thosetheyre not as tender.But then come the cold, silent days of winter.Im really good in the sack in winter, he said.Youre not that bad in summer...Will you stick with me through the harvest?Even when I seem unavailable and distant and tired?I dont know why you even have to ask.Of course Im yours through the harvest.Through many harvests if you want it.Thats exactly what I want, Ginger, he said, solemn.I want to marry you.She was a little surprised.I didnt think you were quite ready to chance it again.It doesnt feel like Id be taking a chance.How about you?She ran her hands through his hair, his glorious hair.She looked forward to being with him when the first strands of silver appeared.She smiled tenderly.It doesnt seem a risk for me, either.One thing I think youll like about the harvest.I never have time for a haircut.Yes, she said, laughing.I think Ill like that part the most.Will you?Marry me?Be mine forever?That means youll have to be mine right back, you know.No kidding around.Ive been yours since last April.The second you coldcocked me, I knew.I didnt do that, you know.I only shoved you.I didnt even shove hard.Lets say you decked me.A better story for our grandchildren.She sobered a little, glancing down.Ginger, there will be grandchildren.Are you afraid?Too afraid?Oh, the thought terrifies me.But Im not going to let that keep me from trying.Its all Ive ever wanteda family.Well be careful, he said.Good medical support.The best pediatric support available.We have Peyton and Scott to help hook us up.There isnt any rush about it.We wont take any chances and well be sure youre ready.Emotionally ready.As ready as possible.Are you?Doesnt it make you a little nervous?Counting on grandchildren through me?He shook his head.If it had been me, Id probably feel just like you do.But things will be different, Ginger.This time you wont be alone.This time your man will be with you every step.Such a good man, always looking for ways to reassure her.Are you going to say yes?he asked.I love you.I want to be with you forever.Yes, of course Im going to say yes.Where do you want to live?Do you think that house on the farm will have room for me?That made him smile.Youd do that?She nodded.This cant happen too fast, Matt.Im not going to abandon Grace.Her mother is sick and shes pregnant.Its going to take planning.I want to sweep you away, he said.That would be fun but I wont run out on her.Until Im sure shes taken care of well have to make do like this.She smiled.The anticipation has been great.When you speed into town on the weekend...Tell me, Mr.Lacoumette, when Im just a farm wife, will you speed home from the orchard to be with me?He laughed.Have you seen my parents?Married almost forty years and still hot for each other.You and Grace have to talk about it, okay?Think about a plan.I need you.I love you.First we have to take care of something important.My family.If I understand you, we have one more weekend before the harvest is in full swing.I know you know some of my family through the business, but I want to bring you home.Ill see if I can gather the troops for next weekend.A barbecue or something with my brothers and their families, with my mom and dad.But if its okay with you, Ill stay with you at night.They know about me, right?he asked.Ive talked to my mom the most but shes told the family I have a man in my life.And of course, they know your family.Paco will be pleased, he said, scratching his chest.Im marrying a trucking company.I dont know who to tell first.My mother?Ray Anne?Grace?Peyton?Tell everyone.We need a ring, Ginger.A nice one.If I can get my family together for next weekend, will we stay in your apartment?If I cant think of a good alternative.My mother was right, I only stayed there so I could have privacy.I cant wait to live on the farm.Youll help me build the house.It has to be your house.Youre committing to an awful lot, Matt.Id do anything for you.Dont you know that?* * * Peyton was first, as it turned out.They walked down to her house and found the whole family home.Ginger thought she knew Matt very well yet shed never seen him quite so puffed up and proud as he was when he said, Were getting married, Peyton.Oh, my God!When?We dont exactly know, Ginger said.We have a couple of things to work outfirst the harvest and then I want to make sure Grace is covered.I mean covered very well.Her life is complicated right now.And need I even say it?Shes been so good to me.I think between Ray Anne, Grace and some of my new friends I have a whole new life.She grabbed Matts hand.And it led me to another new life.Next they found Ray Anne at Als house with Als family of boys, where Ray Anne was helping Al construct a Sunday dinner for the whole crew.There was a loud celebration of congratulations with all the same questions so far impossible to answer.I dont know why anyone wants to get married, said thirteen year old Kevin.And thats how we like ityou not understanding that urge, Al said.I have enough worry that Justins starting to get it.What?Me?he asked.We know theres a girl, Ray Anne said.Yeah, but thats all there is.A girl.Not marriage.How would I ever manage that?Good.Were on the same page, Al said.Then they walked down the beach.They had already decided not to impose on Grace.It was good enough for Ginger to tell her on Monday when they worked together.But Troy was on the beach throwing a Frisbee with Charlie, the nurses son, and Austin, the kid next door.Youre not imposing, Troy said.Shes on the deck with her mother, I think.Everything okay at the shop?As far as I know, Ginger said.Im planning to open tomorrow morning.I just wanted to talk to her for a minute.Go on up, he said.Knock, knock, Ginger said as they neared the top of the stairs.Come up!Grace said.Out for a little walk?We have news, Ginger said.We wanted to tell you together.Now, dont worry about anything...Were getting married, Matt said, pulling the trigger on it.Grace flew to her feet and hugged Ginger in a ferocious, excited embrace, shrieking happily.It took a while for her to calm down.Troy, Charlie and Austin came flying up the stairs from the beach to see what was happening.Grace threw herself at Matt, hugging him fiercely.And then, inevitably, there was crying.Oh, that makes me so happy!Grace cried.This is perfect!It couldnt be more perfect!Ginger was a little stunned.We were going to be careful to reassure youI wont leave you without making sure you have the help you need in the shop.Grace burst into laughter.You mean Matts not giving up that huge farm to live off you and your florists salary in Thunder Point?I couldnt be any more thrilled about this.Ginger, all I want in this world is to see you happy!But we do have to find someone to take my place, Ginger said.Someone good.Someone you can trust.But dont worrywere certainly not getting married while theres a harvest going on.Well get to work on help in the shop, but first lets enjoy the excitement of this.This is wonderful!I knew this would happen!I knew last April when you knocked him out!See?Matt said, his arm around Gingers shoulders.Good story.* * * It took a while for the excitement to die down among Grace, her family and her friends.There was so much hugging and well wishing it almost wore Grace out.But finally Troy and his playmates went back to the beach with their Frisbee, and Ginger and Matt walked back to town where they would have a couple of hours together before he had to head back to his farm in the north.That left Winnie, Grace and Lin Su on the warm deck.Lin Su asked Winnie if shed like a manicure.Winnie loved manicures and pedicures and Lin Su was more than happy to oblige.Lin Su knew that even if Winnies hands didnt work as well as they once had, she wanted them to look good.You should get a raise, Winnie said.You should, Grace agreed.Lin Su laughed.If youre comfortable, Im happy.She brought a tray to the deck.Placing it between herself and Winnie, she began working on her nails.Youre worth a kings ransom, Winnie said.Id never have requested a nurse who could double as a manicurist.I dont suppose you do hair and facials?Im afraid not, she said.I learned to do nails before I attended nursing college.I thought Id be a beautician one day but then Charlie came along and I needed a more dependable income.Doing nails has come in really handy during those tough times when nursing jobs arent in good supply.It cant be easy, Grace said.Being a single mother with a demanding nursing career.And I know nursing is a good field, but its expensive raising a child.There have been challenging times, but this particular job, bringing Charlie along to be entertained by all the people around here, this is like a paid vacation.She massaged Winnies hands.Its true, there isnt a lot left over at the end of the month but we do fine.Do forgive the intrusion, but do you have a man in your life?Winnie asked.Yes, maam.Mr.Charlie Simmons.All the man I can handle, she added.May I ask...?You may ask me anything at all, Winnie.Im in your employ and I want you to be comfortable that Im completely honest with you.Charlies father?she asked.Unfortunately, he was killed in an accident before Charlie was born.We hadnt yet married.Charlie carries my name for that reason.I try not to make too much an issue of the fact that I hadnt been married to his father...but of course, he knows.And your family?Well...She stopped massaging for a moment.Were estranged.They didnt approve of Charlies father.And they didnt exactly approve of my decision to have and raise my son.Damn fools, Winnie said.Mama, dont pass judgment, Grace said.Weve had our issues, you cant deny that.I cant deny it but I sure as hell lived to regret it!Grace grabbed her heart.Holy shit, get the Bible.Its got to be the end of the world!Serpents tooth, Winnie muttered.Lin Su laughed at them.Now, ladies, she admonished, no need to feel sorry for us, really.Were a very good team.
