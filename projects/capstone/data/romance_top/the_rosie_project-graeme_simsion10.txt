I think you gave it your best shot.I looked up to see Gene and Claudia arriving.They were holding hands.I had not seen them do this for several years.Dont tell me were too late, said Gene, jovially.I nodded, then looked back into the restaurant.Rosie was walking quickly toward us.Don, what are you doing?she said.Leaving.You said we shouldnt see each other again.Fuck, she said, then looked at Gene and Claudia.What are you doing here?We are summoned to a thank you and celebration, said Gene.Happy birthday, Don.He gave me a gift wrapped package and put his arm around me in a hug.I recognized that this was probably the final step in the male male advice protocol, indicating acceptance of the advice without damage to our friendship, and managed not to flinch but could not process the input any further.My brain was already overloaded.Its your birthday?said Rosie.Correct.I had to get Helena to look up your birth date, said Gene, but celebration was a clue.I normally do not treat birthdays differently from other days, but it had struck me as an appropriate occasion to commence a new direction.Claudia introduced herself to Rosie, adding, Im sorry, it seems weve come at a bad time.Rosie turned to Gene.A thank you?Thank you?Shit.It wasnt enough to set us up: you had to coach him.You had to turn him into you.Claudia said, quietly, Rosie, it wasnt Genes  Gene put a hand on Claudias shoulder and she stopped.No, it wasnt, he said.Who asked him to change?Who said that hed be perfect for her if he was different?Rosie was now looking very upset.All of my friends (except Dave the Baseball Fan) were fighting.This was terrible.I wanted to roll the story back to New York and make better decisions.But it was impossible.Nothing would change the fault in my brain that made me unacceptable.Gene hadnt stopped.Do you have any idea what he did for you?Take a look in his office sometime.He was presumably referring to my schedule and the large number of Rosie Project activities.Rosie walked out of the restaurant.Gene turned to Claudia.Sorry I interrupted you.Someone had to say it, said Claudia.She looked at Rosie, who was already some distance down the street.I think I coached the wrong person.Gene and Claudia offered me a lift home, but I did not want to continue the conversation.I started walking, then accelerated to a jog.It made sense to get home before it rained.It also made sense to exercise hard and put the restaurant behind me as quickly as possible.The new shoes were workable, but the coat and tie were uncomfortable even on a cold night.I pulled off the jacket, the item that had made me temporarily acceptable in a world to which I did not belong, and threw it in a trash can.The tie followed.On an impulse I retrieved the daphne from the jacket and carried it in my hand for the remainder of the journey.There was rain in the air, and my face was wet as I reached the safety of my apartment.thirty four   We had not finished the wine at the restaurant.I decided to compensate for the resulting alcohol deficit and poured a tumbler of tequila.I turned on the television screen and computer and fast forwarded Casablanca for one last try.I watched as Humphrey Bogarts character used beans as a metaphor for the relative unimportance in the wider world of his relationship with Ingrid Bergmans character and chose logic and decency ahead of his selfish emotional desires.The quandary and resulting decision made for an engrossing film.But this was not what people cried about.They were in love and could never be together.I repeated this statement to myself, trying to force an emotional reaction.I couldnt.I didnt care.I had enough problems of my own.The doorbell buzzed, and I immediately thought Rosie, but when I pushed the CCTV button, it was Claudias face that appeared.Don, are you okay?she said.Can we come up?Its too late.Claudia sounded panicked.What have you done?Don?Its ten thirty one, I said.Too late for visitors.Are you okay?said Claudia, again.Im fine.The experience has been highly useful.New social skills.And final resolution of the Wife Problem.Clear evidence that Im incompatible with women.Genes face appeared on the screen.Don.Can we come up for a drink?Alcohol would be a bad idea.I still had a half glass of tequila in my hand.I was telling a polite lie to avoid social contact.I turned off the intercom.The message light on my home phone was flashing.It was my parents and brother wishing me a happy birthday.I had already spoken to my mother two days earlier when she made her regular Sunday evening call.These past three weeks, I had been attempting to provide some news in return but had not mentioned Rosie.They were utilizing the speakerphone function and collectively sang the birthday songor at least my mother did, strongly encouraging my other two relatives to participate.Ring back if youre home before ten thirty, my mother said.It was 10:38, but I decided not to be pedantic.Its ten thirty nine, said my mother.Im surprised you rang back.Clearly she had expected me to be pedantic, which was reasonable given my history, but she sounded pleased.Hey, said my brother.Gary Parkinsons sister saw you on Facebook.Whos the redhead?Just a girl I was dating.Pull the other leg, said my brother.The words had sounded strange to me too, but I had not been joking.Im not seeing her anymore.I thought you might say that.He laughed.My mother interrupted.Stop it, Trevor.Donald, you didnt tell us you were seeing someone.You know youre always welcome  Mum, he was putting you on, said my brother.I said, said my mother, that anytime you want to bring anyone to meet us, whoever she or he  Leave him alone, both of you, said my father.There was a pause and some conversation in the background.Then my brother said, Sorry, mate.I was just kidding.I know you think Im some sort of redneck, but Im okay with who you are.Id hate you to get to this age and think I still had a problem with it.So, to add to a momentous day, I corrected a misconception that my family had held for at least fifteen years and came out to them as straight.The conversations with Gene, Phil, and my family had been surprisingly therapeutic.I did not need to use the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to know that I was feeling sad, but I was back from the edge of the pit.I would need to do some disciplined thinking in the near future to be certain of remaining safe, but for the moment I did not need to shut down the emotional part of my brain entirely.I wanted a little time to observe how I felt about recent events.It was cold and the rain was pouring, but my balcony was under shelter.I took a chair and my glass outside, then went back inside, put on the natural wool sweater that my mother had knitted for a much earlier birthday, and collected the tequila bottle.I was forty years old.My father used to play a song written by John Sebastian.I remember that it was by John Sebastian because Noddy Holder announced prior to singing it, Were going to do a song by John Sebastian.Are there any John Sebastian fans here?Apparently there were, because there was loud and raucous applause before he started singing.I decided that tonight I was also a John Sebastian fan and that I wanted to hear the song.This was the first time in my life that I could recall a desire to hear a particular piece of music.I had the technology.Or used to.I went to pull out my mobile phone and realized it had been in the jacket I had discarded.I went inside, booted my laptop, registered for iTunes, and downloaded Darling Be Home Soon from Slade Alive!, 1972.I added Satisfaction, thus doubling the size of my popular music collection.I retrieved my earphones from their box and returned to the balcony, poured another tequila, and listened to a voice from my childhood singing that it had taken a quarter of his life before he could begin to see himself.At eighteen, just before I left home to go to university, statistically approaching a quarter of my life, I had listened to these words and been reminded that I had very little understanding of who I was.It had taken me until tonight, approximately halfway, to see myself reasonably clearly.I had Rosie, and the Rosie Project, to thank for that.Now it was over, what had I learned?1.I need not be visibly odd.I could engage in the protocols that others followed and move undetected among them.And how could I be sure that other people were not doing the sameplaying the game to be accepted but suspecting all the time that they were different?2.I had skills that others didnt.My memory and ability to focus had given me an advantage in baseball statistics, cocktail making, and genetics.People had valued these skills, not mocked them.3.I could enjoy friendship and good times.It was my lack of skills, not lack of motivation, that had held me back.Now I was competent enough socially to open my life to a wider range of people.I could have more friends.Dave the Baseball Fan could be the first of many.4.I had told Gene and Claudia that I was incompatible with women.This was an exaggeration.I could enjoy their company, as proven by my joint activities with Rosie and Daphne.Realistically, it was possible that I could have a partnership with a woman.5.The idea behind the Wife Project was still sound.In many cultures a matchmaker would routinely have done what I did, with less technology, reach, and rigor, but the same assumptionthat compatibility was as viable a foundation for marriage as love.6.I was not wired to feel love.And faking it was not acceptable.Not to me.I had feared that Rosie would not love me.Instead, it was I who could not love Rosie.7.I had a great deal of valuable knowledgeabout genetics, computers, aikido, karate, hardware, chess, wine, cocktails, dancing, sexual positions, social protocols, and the probability of a fifty six game hitting streak occurring in the history of baseball.I knew so much shit and I still couldnt fix myself.As the shuffle setting on my media player selected the same two songs over and over, I realized that my thinking was also beginning to go in circles and that, despite the tidy formulation, there was some flaw in my logic.I decided it was my unhappiness with the nights outcome breaking through, my wish that it could be different.I watched the rain falling over the city and poured the last of the tequila.thirty five   I was still in the chair when I woke the next morning.It was cold and raining and my laptop battery had exhausted itself.I shook my head to test for a hangover but it seemed that my alcohol processing enzymes had done their job adequately.So had my brain.I had unconsciously set it a problem to solve and, understanding the importance of the situation, it had overcome the handicap of intoxication to reach a solution.I began the second half of my life by making coffee.Then I reviewed the very simple logic.1.I was wired differently.One of the characteristics of my wiring was that I had difficulty empathizing.This problem has been well documented in others and is, in fact, one of the defining symptoms of the autism spectrum.2.A lack of empathy would account for my inability to respond emotionally to the situations of fictional characters in films.This was similar to my inability to respond as others did to the victims of the World Trade Center terrorist attacks.But I did feel sorry for Frank the firefighter guide.And for Daphne, my sister, my parents when my sister died, Carl and Eugenie because of the Gene Claudia marriage crisis, Gene himself, who wanted to be admired but had achieved the opposite, Claudia, who had agreed to an open marriage but changed her mind and suffered as Gene continued to exploit it, Phil, who had struggled to deal with his wifes infidelity and death and then to win the love of Rosie, Kevin Yu, whose focus on passing the course had blinded him to ethical conduct, the Dean, who had to make difficult decisions under contradictory rules and deal with prejudice about her dress and relationship, Faith Healer, who had to reconcile his strong beliefs with scientific evidence, Margaret Case, whose son had committed suicide and whose mind no longer functioned, and, critically, Rosie, whose childhood and now adulthood had been made unhappy by her mothers death and her father problem and who now wanted me to love her.This was an impressive list, and though it did not include Rick and Ilsa from Casablanca, it was clear evidence that my empathy capability was not entirely absent.3.An inability (or reduced ability) to empathize is not the same as an inability to love.Love is a powerful feeling for another person, often defying logic.4.Rosie had failed numerous criteria on the Wife Project, including the critical smoking question.My feelings for her could not be explained by logic.I did not care about Meryl Streep.But I was in love with Rosie.I had to act quickly, not because I believed the situation with Rosie was likely to change in the immediate future, but because I needed my jacket, which was, I hoped, still in the trash can where I had thrown it.Luckily I was already dressed from the previous evening.It was still raining when I arrived at the trash can, just in time to see it emptied into a garbage truck compactor.I had a contingency plan, but it was going to take time.I turned the bike around to head for home and crossed the road.Slumped in a shop doorway, out of the rain, was a homeless man.He was fast asleep, and he was wearing my jacket.I carefully reached into the inside pocket and extracted the envelope and my phone.As I remounted my bike, I saw a couple on the other side of the street watching me.The male started to run toward me, but the woman called him back.She was making a call on her cell phone.It was only 7:48 a. m.  when I arrived at the university.A police car approached from the opposite direction, slowed as it passed me, then signaled a U turn.It occurred to me that it could have been summoned to deal with my apparent theft from the homeless man.I turned quickly down the bicycle path, where I could not be followed by a motor vehicle, and headed toward the Genetics building to find a towel.As I opened the unlocked door of my office, it was obvious that I had had a visitor, and who that visitor had been.The red roses were lying on my desk.So was the Father Project file, which had been removed from its home in the filing cabinet.The list of father candidate names and sample descriptions was on the desk beside it.Rosie had left a note.Don,  Im sorry about everything.But I know who Table Napkin Man is.Ive told Dad.I probably shouldnt have but I was very upset.I tried to call you.Sorry again.Rosie.There was a lot of crossed out writing between Sorry again and Rosie.But this was a disaster!I needed to warn Gene.His diary indicated a breakfast meeting at the University Club.I checked the PhD area, and Stefan was there but not Rosie.Stefan, who could see that I was highly agitated, followed me.We reached the club and located Gene at a table with the Dean.But at another table, I saw Rosie.She was with Claudia and seemed very distressed.I realized that she could be sharing the news about Gene, even prior to a DNA ratification.The Father Project was ending in total disaster.But I had come for something else.I was desperate to share my revelation.We could resolve the other problem later.I ran to Rosies table.I was still wet as a result of forgetting to dry myself.Rosie was obviously surprised to see me.I dispensed with formalities.Ive made an incredible mistake.I cant believe Ive been so stupid.Irrational!Claudia made signals for me to stop, but I ignored them.You failed almost every criterion of the Wife Project.Disorganized, mathematically illiterate, ridiculous food requirements.Incredible.I considered sharing my life with a smoker.Permanently!Rosies expression was complex but appeared to include sadness, anger, and surprise.It didnt take you long to change your mind, she said.Claudia was frantically waving at me to stop, but I was determined to proceed according to my own plan.I havent changed my mind.Thats the point!I want to spend my life with you even though its totally irrational.And you have short earlobes.Socially and genetically theres no reason for me to be attracted to you.The only logical conclusion is that I must be in love with you.Claudia got up and pushed me into her chair.You dont give up, do you?said Rosie.Im being annoying?No, said Rosie.Youre being incredibly brave.I have the best fun with you; youre the smartest, funniest person I know; youve done all these things for me.Its everything I want and Ive been too scared to grab it because  She stopped, but I knew what she was thinking.I finished her sentence for her.Because Im weird.Perfectly understandable.Im familiar with the problem because everyone else seems weird to me.Rosie laughed.I tried to explain.Crying over fictitious characters, for example.Could you live with me crying in movies?said Rosie.Of course, I said.Its conventional behavior.I stopped as I realized what she had said.Youre offering to live with me?Rosie smiled.You left this on the table, she said, and pulled the ring container from her bag.I realized that Rosie had reversed her decision of the previous night and was in effect rolling back time to allow my original plan to proceed at an alternative location.I extracted the ring and she held out her finger.I put it on and it fitted.I felt a major sense of relief.I became aware of applause.It seemed natural.I had been living in the world of romantic comedy and this was the final scene.But it was real.The entire University Club dining room had been watching.I decided to complete the story according to tradition and kissed Rosie.It was even better than the previous occasion.Youd better not let me down, said Rosie.Im expecting constant craziness.Phil walked in, his nose in a plaster cast, accompanied by the club manager.She was followed by two police.The manager pointed Gene out to Phil.Oh shit, said Rosie.Phil walked over to Gene, who stood up.There was a brief conversation and then Phil knocked him to the floor with a single punch to the jaw.The police rushed forward and restrained Phil, who did not resist.Claudia ran up to Gene, who was slowly rising.He appeared not to be seriously injured.Under the traditional rules of romantic behavior, it was correct for Phil to assault Gene, assuming he had in fact seduced Rosies mother when she was Phils girlfriend.However, it was not certain that Gene was the culprit.On the other hand, numerous men were probably entitled to punch Gene.In this sense, Phil was dispensing romantic justice on their behalf.Gene must have understood, because he appeared to be reassuring the police that everything was okay.I redirected my attention to Rosie.Now that my previous plan had been reinstated, it was important not to be distracted.Item two on the agenda was your fathers identity.Rosie smiled.Back on track.Item one: Lets get married.Okay, thats settled.Item two: This is the Don Ive grown to know and love.The last word stopped me.I could only look at Rosie as I took in the reality of what she had said.I guessed she was doing the same, and it was several seconds before she spoke.How many positions in that book can you do?The sex book?All of them.Bullshit.It was considerably less complex than the cocktail book.So lets go home, she said.To my place.Or your place if youve still got the Atticus Finch outfit.She laughed.Its in my office.Another time.Dont throw it out.We got up, but the police, one man and one woman, blocked our path.Sir, said the woman (age approximately twenty eight, BMI twenty three), Im going to have to ask you whats in your pocket.I had forgotten the envelope!I pulled it out and waved it in front of Rosie.Tickets!Tickets to Disneyland.All problems solved!I fanned out the three tickets, took Rosies hand, and we walked toward Phil to show him.thirty six   We went to DisneylandRosie, Phil, and I.  It was great fun and appeared to be a success in improving all relationships.Rosie and Phil shared information and I learned a lot about Rosies life.It was important background for the difficult but essential task of developing a high level of empathy for one person in the world.Rosie and I were on our way to New York, where being weird is acceptable.That is a simplification of the rationale: in reality what was important for me was to be able to make a new start with my new skills, new approach, and new partner, without being held back by others perceptions of meperceptions that I had not only deserved but encouraged.Here in New York, I am working in the Department of Genetics at Columbia University, and Rosie is in the first year of the Doctor of Medicine program.I am contributing to Simon Lefebvres research project remotely, as he insisted on it as a condition of providing funding.I consider it a form of moral payback for using the universitys equipment for the Father Project.We have an apartment in Williamsburg, not far from the Eslers, whom we visit regularly.The Cellar Interrogation is now a story that Isaac and I tell on social occasions.We are considering reproducing (or, as I would say in a social encounter, having children).In order to prepare for this possibility, Rosie has ceased smoking, and we have reduced our alcohol intake.Fortunately we have numerous other activities to distract us from these addictive behaviors.Rosie and I work in a cocktail bar together three evenings a week.It is exhausting at times but social and fun, and it supplements my academic salary.We listen to music.I have revised my approach to Bach and am no longer trying to follow individual notes.The new approach is more successful, but my music tastes seem to have been locked in in my teens.As a result of my failing to make my own selections at that time, my preferences are those of my father.I can advance a well reasoned argument that nothing worth listening to was recorded after 1972.Rosie and I have that argument frequently.I cook but reserve the meals of the Standardized Meal System for dinner parties.We are officially married.Although I had performed the romantic ritual with the ring, I did not expect Rosie, as a modern feminist, to want to actually get married.The term wife in Wife Project had always meant female life partner.But she decided that she should have one relationship in my life that was what it was supposed to be.That included monogamy and permanence.An excellent outcome.I am able to hug Rosie.This was the issue that caused me the most fear after she agreed to live with me.I generally find body contact unpleasant, but sex is an obvious exception.Sex solved the body contact problem.We are now also able to hug without having sex, which is obviously convenient at times.Once a week, in order to deal with the demands of living with another person, and to continue to improve my skills in this sphere, I spend an evening in therapy.This is a small joke: my therapist is Dave, and I provide reciprocal services to him.Dave is also married, and considering that I am supposedly wired differently, our challenges are surprisingly similar.He sometimes brings male friends and colleagues from work, where he is a refrigeration engineer.We are all Yankees fans.For some time, Rosie did not mention the Father Project.I attributed this to the improved relationship with Phil and the distraction of other activities.But in the background, I was processing some new information.At the wedding, Dr.Eamonn Hughes, the first person we had tested, had asked to speak to me privately.Theres something you should know, he said.About Rosies father.It seemed entirely plausible that Rosies mothers closest friend from medical school would know who he was.Perhaps we had only needed to ask.But Eamonn was referring to something else.He pointed to Phil.Phils been a bit of a screwup with Rosie.So it wasnt only Rosie who thought Phil was a poor parent.You know about the car accident?I nodded, although I had no detailed information.Rosie had made it clear that she did not want to discuss it.Bernadette was driving because Phil had been drinking.I had deduced that Phil was in the car.Phil got out, with a broken pelvis, and pulled Rosie out.Eamonn paused.He was obviously distressed.He pulled Rosie out first.This was truly an awful scenario, but as a geneticist my immediate thought was of course.Phils behavior, in pain and under extreme pressure, would surely have been instinctual.Such life and death situations occur regularly in the animal kingdom and Phils choice was in line with theory and experimental results.While he had presumably revisited that moment many times in his mind, and his later feelings toward Rosie may have been severely affected by it, his actions were consistent with the primitive drive to protect the carrier of his genes.It was only later that I realized my obvious error.As Rosie was not Phils biological daughter, such instincts would not have been applicable.I spent some time reflecting on the possible explanations for his behavior.I did not share my thoughts or the hypothesis I formed.When I was established at Columbia, I requested permission to use the DNA testing facilities for a private investigation.They were willing to let me do so.It would not have been a problem if they had refused.I could have sent my remaining samples to a commercial laboratory and paid a few hundred dollars for the tests.This option had been available to Rosie from the beginning of the Father Project.It is now obvious to me that I did not alert Rosie to it because I was subconsciously interested in a relationship with her even then.Amazing!I did not tell Rosie about the test.One day I just packed my bag with the samples that I had brought with me to New York.I started with the paranoid plastic surgeon, Freyberg, who was the least likely candidate in my assessment.A green eyed father was not impossible, but there was no other evidence making him more probable than any of the previous candidates.His reluctance to send me a blood sample was explained by his being a generally suspicious and unhelpful person.My prediction was correct.I loaded Eslers specimen, a swab from a fork that had traveled more than halfway around the world and back again.In his darkened basement, I had been certain he was Rosies father.But afterward I had come to the conclusion that he could have been protecting a friend or the memory of a friend.I wondered if Eslers decision to become a psychiatrist had been influenced by the suicide of the best man at his wedding, Geoffrey Case.I tested the sample.Isaac Esler was not Rosies father.I picked up Genes sample.My best friend.He was working hard on his marriage.The map had been removed from his wall when I went in to submit my resignation to the Dean.But I had no recollection of seeing a pin in Ireland, Rosies mothers birthplace.There was no need to test the table napkin.I tossed it in the waste basket.I had now eliminated every candidate except Geoffrey Case.Isaac Esler had told me that he knew who Rosies father was and that he was sworn to secrecy.Did Rosies motherand Eslernot want Rosie to know that there was a family history of suicide?Or perhaps a genetic predisposition to mental illness?Or that Geoffrey Case had possibly killed himself in the wake of the news that he was Rosies father and that her mother had decided to remain with Phil?These were all good reasonsgood enough that I considered it highly likely that Rosies mothers one night encounter had been with Geoffrey Case.I reached into my bag and pulled out the DNA sample that fate had delivered to me without Rosies knowledge.I was now almost certain that it would confirm my hypothesis as to her paternity.I cut a small portion of the cloth, poured over the reagent, and let it sit for a few minutes.As I watched the fabric in the clear solution and mentally reviewed the Father Project, I became more and more confident in my prediction.I decided that Rosie should join me for this result, regardless of whether I was right or wrong.I texted her.She was on campus and arrived a few minutes later.She immediately realized what I was doing.I put the processed sample in the machine and waited while the analysis proceeded.We watched the computer screen together until the result came up.After all the blood collecting, cheek swabbing, cocktail shaking, wall climbing, glass collecting, flying, driving, proposal writing, urine mopping, cup stealing, fork wiping, tissue retrieving, toothbrush stealing, hairbrush cleaning, and tear wiping, we had a match.Rosie had wanted to know who her biological father was.Her mother had wanted the identity of the man she had sex with, perhaps only once, on an occasion of emotion driven rule breaking, to remain a secret forever.I could now fulfill both of their wishes.I showed her the remains of the blood stained shirt from Jarmans Gym with the sample square cut out of it.There would be no need to test the handkerchief that had wiped Margaret Cases tears.Ultimately, the entire father problem was caused by Gene.He almost certainly taught the medical students an oversimplified model of the inheritance of common traits.If Rosies mother had known that eye color was not a reliable indicator of paternity and organized a DNA test to confirm her suspicions, there would have been no Father Project, no Great Cocktail Night, no New York Adventure, no Reform Don Projectand no Rosie Project.Had it not been for this unscheduled series of events, her daughter and I would not have fallen in love.And I would still be eating lobster every Tuesday night.Incredible.acknowledgments   The Rosie Project was written quickly.I poked my head up for just long enough to consult with my writer wife, Anne; daughter Dominique; and my novel writing class at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), led by Michelle Aung Thin.After being adopted by Text Publishing, the manuscript benefited enormously from the attentions of my editor, Alison Arnold, who understood exactly what I was aiming for, and the passionate support of Michael Heyward and his team, in particular Jane Novak, Kirsty Wilson, Chong Weng Ho, and Michelle Calligaro.Anne Beilbys efforts in bringing Rosie to the attention of international publishers have ensured that Don and Rosies story will be told in more than thirty five languages, and Karyn Marcus of Simon & Schuster has been meticulous in editing the American version.But the underlying story has a longer pedigree.It began as a screenplay, developed during screenwriting studies at RMIT.Anne, my son Daniel, and I workshopped the original plot during a walk in New Zealand.A workup for the characters was published as The Klara Project: Phase 1 in The Envelope Please in 2007, and I completed the first draft of the screenplay, with a different plot and a nerdy Hungarian Klara instead of Rosie, in 2008, having taken some time to decide that it was a comedy rather than a drama.The story changed significantly over five years, very much for the better, and for that I have to thank the many people who encouraged, criticized, and pushed me not to be satisfied with what I had.The faculty at RMIT taught me the principles of storytelling, as well as offering specific advice on the script.Special mentions are due to Clare Renner, Head of School; Tim Ferguson, comedy legend; David Rapsey and Ian Pringle, seasoned film producers who did not stint on the tough love; and Boris Trbic, who gave me an appreciation for the screwball comedy.Cary Grant would have made a perfect Don.Jo Moylan was my writing buddy through a year of the most radical changes.Making short films with the audiovisual students, under the leadership of Rowan Humphrey and Simon Embury, taught me much about what worked and what didnt.As I watched my extraneous dialogue hit the digital equivalent of the cutting room floor, I learned a lot about writing economically.Kim Krejus of 16th Street Actors Studio organized talented actors for an enlightening reading.I am fortunate to belong to a talented and hardworking writers group: Irina Goundortseva, Steve Mitchell, Susannah Petty, and May Yeung.Rosie was regularly on the agenda, and Irinas enthusiasm for the short story was instrumental in my taking it further.Later, Heidi Winnen was the first person outside my family to suggest that the novel might have potential.The script benefited from the astute feedback of screenwriting gurus Steve Kaplan and Michael Hauge.Their involvement was in turn made possible by the Australian Writers Guild, which, in conjunction with Inscription, offered a prize for romantic comedy writing in 2010.Producers Peter Lee and Ros Walker and director John Paul Fischbach also offered valuable criticism.The path to publication began when The Rosie Project won the Victorian Premiers Literary Award for an unpublished manuscript in 2012, and I acknowledge the Victorian State Government and the Wheeler Centre for sponsoring and administering the award.I also thank the judges, Nick Gadd, Peter Mews, Zoe Dattner, and Roderick Poole, for their brave choice.Many other people have supported Rosie and me on the six year journey from concept to published novel, notably Jon Backhouse, Rebecca Carter, Cameron Clarke, Sara Cullen, Fran Cusworth, Barbara Gliddon, Amanda Golding, Vin Hedger, Kate Hicks, Amy Jasper, Noel Maloney, Brian McKenzie, Steve Melnikoff, Ben Michael, Helen OConnell, Rebecca Peniston Bird, April Reeve, John Reeves, Sue and Chris Waddell, Geri and Pete Walsh, and my fellow students at RMIT.Dons lobster salad is based on a recipe from

years in information technology, and taught at several universities.In these areas, technical skills are given more weight than social skills.So I met many people who Im sure would have been diagnosed as being on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum had that diagnosis been common when they were younger.And I know a number of people with kids who have been diagnosed with Aspergers or autism.2.Was any one specific your inspiration for Don?People I worked with and taught.There are plenty of Dons out there.One close friend struggled for many years to find a partner, and he provided inspiration for my first version of the story but the character and story have changed a lot since then.There is no real Don!3.Do you love the American Museum of Natural History as much as Don does?Not that much!But its one of my favorite places in New York.4.Do you have any idiosyncratic deal breakers like Dons with ice cream preference?I dont think so, but Ive been married for twenty four years, so I dont have a lot of recent dating experience.I really dont like smoking, but I dated a smoker for some time when I was younger.Back in those days, if I was really attracted to someone, Id make a lot of concessions.Perhaps less so now.5.Whats your BMI?Its 22.5.I ran a marathon in 2010 and it was quite a bit less thenand even less after I ended up in hospital for a week.The story is at http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/books/three encounters with the physical 20130111 2cl32.html.6.Don is a bit of a foodie.You founded Pinot Now and have eaten at elBulli.Can you talk about the role of food and wine in your life?Im also a bit of a foodie and a wine lover.I cook a lot, and put quite a bit of effort into meals.I actually do jog to the local market, though not on as regular a schedule as Don.Cooking is a good opportunity for thinking (as it is for Don), and I enjoy the results.My wife and I drink a lot of wineprobably too muchand treat our travel as an opportunity to try restaurants and local produce.Its a balance to the more intellectual business of writing.7.How did you develop and dive into Dons voice?I channeled a close friend who has a background in information technologya very technical background.In the early drafts I could hear his voice, but over time Don developed his own mannerisms.I borrowed habits like greetings and expressions like human sponge mode from other colleagues and friends.8.Do you feel that this is a story of triumph for Don?Absolutely.Don is the hero of the story in all senses.He sets out to do something that is a huge stretch and overcomes obstacles and his own limitations to achieve italong the way learning some lessons about what he really needs.And he does this in a fundamentally decent way.9.You have a background in data modeling.What is that exactly, and did your experience with it contribute to your portrait of Don and his Wife Project?Its basically the job of specifying a databasedescribing in precise technical language what data is to be held and how it is to be represented.A bit like an architect describing to a builder exactly what needs to be built, after helping the client express his or her requirements and proposing a design.The discipline itself doesnt feature in the book, but some of the people I met in the fieldprecise, highly organized peoplecontributed to my characterization of Don.10.You also write, produce, and act in films.How is the process of writing for film different from writing a novel?Well, the acting was only one time!But Ive produced numerous short films and in fact wrote The Rosie Project as a screenplay before adapting it into a novel.In screenwriting, at least for mainstream films, there is a strong emphasis on storyand story structure.Its more formulaic than a novel, but its also a good discipline.In a romantic comedy you have only about one hundred minutes, so you have to make every scene count.You see it in Rosie: its structured as a romantic comedy and reads as a series of scenes.And it moves along pretty quickly.In a novel, you have the opportunity to describe the characters thought processesand in The Rosie Project thats an important tool for comedy.On the screen you can use physical action and timingwhich are not directly available to you on the page.11.You own a Porsche, have flown a Cessna solo, and walked the Camino de Santiago.Is adventure something you seek out in life?Im not a physical thrillseeker, but I enjoy challenges and achievement, and am very conscious that we only get one life.My wife drives the Porschemost of the time I take the tram.Want to know what happens next for Don and Rosie?Keep reading for an exclusive look at The Rosie Effect!one   Orange juice was not scheduled for Fridays.Although Rosie and I had abandoned the Standardized Meal System, resulting in an improvement in spontaneity at the expense of shopping time, food inventory, and wastage, we had agreed that each week should include three alcohol free days.Without formal scheduling, this target proved difficult to achieve, as I had predicted.Rosie eventually saw the logic of my solution.Fridays and Saturdays were obvious days on which to consume alcohol.Neither of us had classes on the weekend.We could sleep late and possibly have sex.Sex was absolutely not allowed to be scheduled, at least not by explicit discussion, but I had become familiar with the sequence of events likely to precipitate it: a blueberry muffin from Blue Sky Bakery, a triple shot of espresso from Othas, removal of my shirt, and my impersonation of Gregory Peck in the role of Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird.I had learned not to do all four in the same sequence on every occasion, as my intention would then be obvious.To provide an element of unpredictability, I settled on tossing a coin twice to select a component of the routine to delete.I had placed a bottle of Elk Cove pinot gris in the refrigerator to accompany the divers scallops purchased that morning at Chelsea Market, but when I returned after retrieving our laundry from the basement, there were two glasses of orange juice on the table.Orange juice was not compatible with the wine.Drinking it first would desensitize our taste buds to the slight residual sugar that was a feature of the pinot gris, thus creating an impression of sourness.Waiting until after we had finished the wine would also be unacceptable.Orange juice deteriorates rapidlyhence the emphasis placed by breakfast establishments on freshly squeezed.Rosie was in the bedroom, so not immediately available for discussion.In our apartment, there were nine possible combinations of locations for two people, of which six involved us being in different rooms.In our ideal apartment, as jointly specified prior to our arrival in New York, there would have been thirty six possible combinations, arising from the bedroom, two studies, two bathrooms, and a living room kitchen.This reference apartment would have been located in Manhattan, close to the 1 or A train for access to Columbia University medical school, with water views and a balcony or rooftop barbecue area.As our income consisted of one academics salary, supplemented by two part time cocktail making jobs but reduced by Rosies tuition fees, some compromise was required, and our apartment offered none of the specified features.We had given excessive weight to the Williamsburg location because our friends Isaac and Judy Esler lived there and had recommended it.There was no logical reason why a (then) forty year old professor of genetics and a thirty year old postgraduate medical student would be suited to the same neighborhood as a fifty four year old psychiatrist and a fifty two year old potter who had acquired their dwelling before prices escalated.The rent was high and the apartment had a number of faults that the management was reluctant to rectify.Currently the air conditioning was failing to compensate for the exterior temperature of thirty four degrees Celsius, which was within the expected range for Brooklyn in late June.The reduction in room numbers, combined with marriage, meant I had been thrown into closer sustained proximity with another human being than ever before.Rosies physical presence was a hugely positive outcome of the Wife Project, but after ten months and ten days of marriage I was still adapting to being a component of a couple.I sometimes spent longer in the bathroom than was strictly necessary.I checked the date on my phonedefinitely Friday, June 21.This was a better outcome than the scenario in which my brain had developed a fault that caused it to identify days incorrectly.But it confirmed a violation of the alcohol protocol.My reflections were interrupted by Rosie emerging from the bedroom wearing only a towel.This was my favorite costume, assuming no costume did not qualify as a costume.Once again, I was struck by her extraordinary beauty and inexplicable decision to select me as her partner.And, as always, that thought was followed by an unwanted emotion: an intense moment of fear that she would one day realize her error.Whats cooking?she asked.Nothing.Cooking has not commenced.Im in the ingredient assembly phase.She laughed, in the tone that indicated I had misinterpreted her question.Of course, the question would not have been required at all had the Standardized Meal System been in place.I provided the information that I guessed Rosie was seeking.Sustainable scallops with a mirepoix of carrots, celeriac, shallots, and bell peppers and a sesame oil dressing.The recommended accompanying beverage is pinot gris.Do you need me to do anything?We all need to get some sleep tonight.Tomorrow we go to Navarone.The content of the Gregory Peck line was irrelevant.The effect came entirely from the delivery and the impression it conveyed of leadership and confidence in the preparation of sauted scallops.And what if I cant sleep, Captain?said Rosie.She smiled and disappeared into the bathroom.I did not raise the towel location issue: I had long ago accepted that hers would be stored randomly in the bathroom or bedroom, effectively occupying two spaces.Our preferences for order are at different ends of the scale.When we moved from Australia to New York, Rosie packed three maximum size suitcases.The quantity of clothes alone was incredible.My own personal items fitted into two carry on bags.I took advantage of the move to upgrade my living equipment and gave my stereo and desktop computer to my brother, Trevor, returned the bed, linen, and kitchen utensils to the family home in Shepparton, and sold my bike.In contrast, Rosie added to her vast collection of possessions by purchasing decorative objects within weeks of our arrival.The result was evident in the chaotic condition of our apartment: potted plants, surplus chairs, and an impractical wine rack.It was not merely the quantity of items: there was also a problem of organization.The refrigerator was crowded with half empty containers of bread toppings, dips, and decaying dairy products.Rosie had even suggested sourcing a second refrigerator from my friend Dave.One fridge each!Never had the advantages of the Standardized Meal System, with its fully specified meal for each day of the week, standard shopping list, and optimized inventory, been so obvious.There was exactly one exception to Rosies disorganized approach.That exception was a variable.By default it was her medical studies, but currently it was her PhD thesis on environmental risks for the early onset of bipolar disorder.She had been granted advanced status in the Columbia MD program on the proviso that her thesis would be completed during the summer vacation.The deadline was now only two months and five days away.How can you be so organized at one thing and so disorganized at everything else?Id asked Rosie, following her installation of the incorrect driver for her printer.Its because Im concentrating on my thesis, I dont worry about other stuff.Nobody asks if Freud checked the use by date on the milk.They didnt have use by dates in the early twentieth century.It was incredible that two such dissimilar people had become a successful couple.
