She wasnt here.James Halloran drank his beer and did his damnedest not to look like he was searching the dance floor below for someone specific.Just like he hadnt shown up here five nights a week for the last four months, even though he was needed elsewhere.With his old man in the slammer and his little brother causing more problems than he fixed, all of Jamess attention should have been on getting his people back onto stable ground.Instead, he couldnt get her out of his head.Carrigan OMalley.He didnt know what he would say to her if he did see her.Apologize?Considering the last time theyd seen each other, hed kidnapped her, tied her to his bed, and his father had been a few short hours from killing herYeah, there wasnt a fucking Hallmark card that covered that.He scanned the club again, this time telling himself he was looking for potential enemies.The ruling families of the underground might technically be at peace, but that didnt mean he wanted to come face to face with one of the OMalley men.He understood why they wouldnt hesitate to try to take their pound of flesh out of him, but that didnt mean he was going to play whipping boy.They all had their roles to playSheridan, OMalley, and Halloran.He couldnt have changed things, even if hed wanted to.When he let himself think about it, though, he regretted the fuck out of Devlin OMalleys death.He reached for his beer, only to realize it was empty.Want another?The short bartender didnt look old enough to drink, but she was good enough at her job not to give him shit for showing up, having a single drink, and leaving.Over and over again.No, thanks.She wasnt coming tonight, just like she hadnt come any night since the one where shed blown his fucking mind in a supply closet.Before he realized exactly whose ear hed been spilling filthy words into.Before she said her name and everything changed.Before he made the decision that labeled him just as cold a bastard as his old man.Carrigan OMalley.The daughter of the enemy.The one woman he sure as hell needed to keep his hands off.Her absence made sense.If he had sisters, he would have gotten them the hell out of Dodge before shit hit the fan, and he would have kept them somewhere safe while things played out.The power situation wasnt stable in Bostonnot like it had been a year ago but it was evening out.It had to.He was all too aware that war among the three families was the least of their concerns if some outside threat decided to take advantage of the power fluctuation.He knew the Sheridans and OMalleysknew how they thought, knew what they wanted, knew how theyd react to a given threat.Better the devil he knew than the devil he didnt.Hed been in talks with Colm Sheridan and his daughter, Callista, about securing peace.She, at least, wasnt willing to let the past get in the way of the ultimate good.The reluctant admiration hed first felt when she turned herself over to him, admitting that shed pulled the trigger that ended his older brothers life, had bloomed into full fledged respect.Teague was a lucky son of a bitch and so was everyone under Sheridan protection.Callista Sheridan was a force to be reckoned with.Somehow, James didnt think Carrigan would be as willing to let the past go.She was prickly and prideful and had a furious temper and he knew that after having been around her for less than three days.Enough of this shit.He pushed to his feet and headed for the spiral staircase leading down to the main floor.Since it was a Tuesday night, the place was far from packed, but there was still a cluster of dancers sweating and grinding in the middle of the floor, and plenty of people standing around the lower bar, waiting for drinks.He scanned their faces out of habit, not really expecting anything but disappointment.His gaze landed on familiar green eyes, and he stopped short.He had to be seeing things.It had happened before hed been sure it was her, only to approach and realize hed been projecting her image on some other pretty brunette.But then she shook her head, like she was trying to dispel his image, and he knew.James took a step toward her, still having no fucking idea what he was going to say.She turned tail and bolted.He was giving chase before making a decision to do so.The voice of reason piped up to point out that running her down wasnt going to do a damn thing to reassure her that he wasnt up to no good, but it wasnt like he had another option at this point.She wasnt going to sit there and let him approach her.That didnt stop him from hauling ass through the doors and out into the street.He looked left and then caught sight of her further down the block, making impressive time considering the six inch spike heels on her feet.But he had the advantage on open ground.James poured on more speed, closing the distance between them.She cast a panicked look over her shoulder, and it was almost enough to make him stop.Only the knowledge that he wouldnt get another chance like this again kept him moving.That and something inside him that he was reluctant to name.It felt a whole hell of a lot like the conscience hed thought was dead and gone.She was less than six feet in front of him.It was now or never.For fucks sake, stop.Leave me alone.He put on a burst of speed and hooked an arm around her waist just as they reached the corner, jerking her to a stop.Hold on for a second.She drove her elbow into his stomach, and then slammed her heel into his toe.Even through his boots, he felt it.Get off me.Her struggles increased.Let go!He let go, holding his hands up and gritting his teeth against the throbbing in his foot.Im sorry, okay?I just wanted to talk.You have a funny way of showing it.She glanced over her shoulder, checking to see if he had other men with him, or maybe looking for an escape route.Goddamn it, I knew better than to come back here.Im not going to hurt you.I never would have let them hurt you.But the words wouldnt come.He might have stood back and let her and Callista Sheridan escape that night, but he could have done more.Hed taken the path that resulted in the least risk to him, and something horrible could have happened to either of them as a result.She laughed, a low, broken sound.You know, considering our history, I find that hard to believe.What could he say?She was right.In her position, he would have done more violence than an elbow to the stomach.Hell, he would have drawn a gun and put an end to the threat once and for all.But things with them were different.She damn well knew that he didnt want her hurt, abduction or no.No one laid a hand on you.No, you just threw me in a trunk, and then tied me to a bed and She shook her head, drawing his attention to her mass of dark hair.I dont know why Im still standing here.Stay the hell away from me.This was it.She would walk away, and it was entirely likely that hed never see her again.Hed never see his album again.The last link he had to his mother.It was a stupid sentiment, but hed never been able to fully pack away the old photo album.To know it had been in her possession for the last four monthsIt left him feeling edgy and strangely vulnerable.He couldnt tell anyone that shed taken it without admitting what it meant to him, and that was handing a loaded gun to the OMalleys.No fucking way was he going there.Thats the reason youre here, dipshit.Youre not fawning over some woman, no matter how hot she is.She took something from you and you want it back.Where is it?She stopped, but she didnt turn back.Where is what?Dont play dumb, lovely.It doesnt suit you.He took a step closer, close enough to see the way her shoulders tightened, as if she could sense his proximity.That album wasnt yours to take.She gave him an icy look over her shoulder.Even if I did take something which I didnt I wouldnt have kept it.She was bluffing.She had to be.He made himself hold perfectly still, all too aware that one wrong move would send her fleeing into the night.Liar.Whatever you have to tell yourself to sleep at night.It struck him that maybe she had gotten rid of the album.She had no reason to keep it.It was nothing to her less than nothing.He strove to keep his thoughts off his face, but from the curiosity flaring in her green eyes, he did a piss poor job of it.Ill make you a deal.Thats rich.You have nothing I want.Maybe not, but he wasnt above playing dirty.Not in this.Not in anything anymore.James closed the distance between them in a single step and grasped her chin tightly enough that she couldnt pull away.Give back what you stole, and youll never have to see me again.And if I dont?Well, lovely, then Im going to have to take that as a sign that you still want me as much as you did four months ago.Which means you want to see me againa nd again, and again.Her eyes went wide.Are you seriously offering not to stalk me if I give back this thing I supposedly stole?What kind of deal is that?Its bullshit.She wasnt afraid anymore, which was a goddamn relief.Instead there was a spark of anger vibrating through her body, and she was eyeing him like she wouldnt mind taking a chunk out of his hide.He preferred this Carrigan to the frightened one.As long as she was focusing on where she wanted to hurt him, she wasnt thinking about the threat he potentially posed.I said you and I have unfinished business, and I damn well meant it.Wrong.She snorted.Finished business is the only kind we have ancient history.For the last time, get your big paws off me.He released her for the second time.Im not bluffing.Neither am I.  She turned around and walked away.This time he let her go.He had no goddamn right to threaten her, but the thought of never seeing the album again it sure as fuck wasnt the thought of never seeing her again made him twitchy.It wasnt a threat hed have made six months ago, but he wasnt the same man hed been then.Hed given up trying to be better than the rest of the Hallorans.That same violence and aggression that ran through their blood ran through his, too.No matter how much he hated it.Things had gotten out of control after his older brothers death four months ago.Even now, knowing what he did about the monster Brendan was, his absence was still a weight in Jamess stomach.He didnt choose his family, and half the time he didnt like them, but they were all he had.The Halloran empire in Southie.All the death and unforgivable shit, and for what?A few square miles of land in the part of Boston no one else wanted?He waited until he saw Carrigan climb into the back of a cab before he turned and headed for his car.He wasnt quite thirty yet, and he was so goddamn tired.It never ended.The power games, and the unforgivable acts, and the compromises on what he used to think of as his honor.There was nothing left of it anymore, and hell if that didnt send a pang of loss through him.Not for the first time, he wondered what his mother would think of the men her beloved sons had turned into.He couldnt shake the belief that he was failing her.But she was dead and gone some fifteen years, and his old man was very much among the living.The only link James had to her was the album Carrigan had taken a shrine to the man he might have been in different circumstances.That man was dead and gone as surely as his mother was.In reality, hed never stood a chance.His course in life was set the second he came into this world as a Halloran, and any chance he had to choose a different path had gone up in smoke with Brendans death.Now it all fell to James.The responsibility of keeping the Halloran name from disappearing the same way other enemies of the Sheridans had.People still talked about what Colm Sheridan did to the MacNamaras, though the details were sketchy now, thirty years later.All anyone knew was that it was horrific enough that no one had challenged him since.James couldnt let that happen to his people.And they were his, whether he wanted the responsibility or not.The only other option was walking away and letting his idiot of a younger brother take over, which was as good as signing the death warrant of everyone who depended on the Hallorans to keep shit in check in their territory.Besides, where would he go?This was his life.His options were sink or swim and if he sunk, hed take a hell of a lot of people with him.So he got up every day, and he swam, even though some of the shit he was required to do turned his stomach and made him lose sleep.He did it because there was no other option.He slid into the drivers seat of his cherry red 70 Chevelle and sighed.His life would be a whole lot less complicated if he could let the specter of his night with Carrigan OMalley go.She hated his ass, and for good reason.Spending more time chasing her was courting more problems than he had resources to deal with.Life was too tenuous right now to throw something like this into the middle of itthe whole thing could erupt like a bonfire at the first spark of trouble.*** Carrigan huddled in the back of the cab, trying not to shake.James motherfucking Halloran.She should have known better than to risk going back to the same club hed taken her from, but it had been a test.Avoiding that location meant she was afraid.Carrigan had learned a long time ago that every time she refused to face her fear, it got more powerful.A fear left unchecked took away her control.And control was one thing she didnt have nearly enough of as it was.Why the hell was he there?In the months and months of her frequenting that club, shed never once seen him there.And she would have seen him there.James was the kind of man who stood out, even in a crowd.He exuded danger that even the most oblivious idiot could pick up one very time shed seen him, even in the most crowded room, he had a good six inches of empty space around him.People might not realize why they gave him wide berth, but she did.Because he was the kind of man who did very bad things without hesitation.A predator.The fact that he was big and blond and gorgeous in a rough kind of way was only the icing on the cake if a woman was into that kind of thing.Shed been exactly that kind of woman the last time theyd met, and shed like to say shed learned from her past mistakes.James Halloran was a man she needed to avoid like the goddamn plague.Shed bet what little freedom she had left that hed never been there at the same time she was.As tempting as it was to chalk it up to a coincidence, it was too damn much to believe hed been there tonight by chance.Which meant hed been there looking for her.She shivered.Taking the album was a mistake.Shed known the second she opened it and saw its contents that he wouldnt rest until he had it back in his possession.If she had half a brain in her head, shed send the thing back to him and good riddance.Even as the thought crossed her mind, she shook her head.As questionable as it was, she wasnt ready to give up that pawn especially since it was important enough for him to seek her out.He said hed been thinking about that night.He lied.He had to have lied.The sex obviously didnt mean shit to him since hed thrown her in a trunk less than ten minutes afterward.Not to mention that every remaining member of his shrinking family had been all too happy to threaten to kill her and worse.They would have done it.She wasnt naive enough to think they wouldnt have.Hell, her own father did worse than that to people who crossed him.There was no reason to believe James would have suddenly developed a conscience and played white knight to her damsel in distress.Yes, hed stepped aside and let her and Callie go when they were sneaking out.He might have let them escape, but that didnt mean he wouldnt have stood by and watched her tortured and killed if his father commanded it.Her body burned at the memory of how hed kissed her, of the look in his eyes when hed growled that they had unfinished business.Stop it.Which was why it was so incredibly unforgivable that her brain kept circling back to him in the intervening months.She could claim Stockholm syndrome until she was blue in the face, but it wasnt the truth.The cab pulled up in front of her familys home, saving her from following that train of thought any further down the rabbit hole.James Halloran was the enemy, and shed be every bit the stupid bimbo her father thought she was if she forgot that.Carrigan paid the driver and climbed out of the cab.She made it all of three steps when she realized what shed done shed come home wearing her clubbing clothes when she was supposed to have been at church, praying for her fathers immortal soul.Goddamn it.Rough night?She startled, nearly tipping over her heels, and spun to face the male voice.It took all of a second to recognize who it belonged to.Cillian?What the hell are you doing lurking out here?The middle child of seven and third boy Cillian had lived as much a charmed life as possible under their circumstances.Hed always been kind of an idiot, but hed never had to face the same things she and her sisters had.Or even that Teague and Aiden had.There had been no one requiring him to grow up, and so hed happily played at being a Lost Boy.Until Devlin died.It seemed like so much of their lives centered on that one tragedy.Things had been a certain way.Before Victor Halloran lost his mind and declared war.Before things escalated to the point of no return.Before a bullet from a Halloran man snuffed out the life of the best and brightest of their family.Now life was divided into Before Devlin and After Devlin.She rubbed a hand over her chest, wondering how much time it would take to dull the edge of pain that thinking about him brought.As Cillian moved closer, the toll the last few months had taken on him was written all over his face.Even in the shadows, his eyes were haunted.He glanced at the intimidating front door to the town house, the trees lining the street making the darkness feel more absolute despite the lights peppered between them.I wasnt ready to go in.To face their reality.Was there anyone in their family who didnt want to run as far and fast as they could to get away from the hell they lived in?Carrigan didnt think so.Six months ago, she would have put Cillian on that short list.Maybe even Devlin, too.Now?Now Devlin was gone and everything was different.Devlin was the one who had still maintained an aura of innocence despite everything.The one who might have escaped the net their father was so intent on tangling them in.The net called family.She almost laughed.Who was she kidding?No one escaped.Not Devlin.Not Cillian.Sure as hell not her.And what would you do if you did escape?There was no point in thinking about it.This was her reality, and she had to make the best of it that she could.Carrigan looped her arm through his.Im not ready, either.Want to go for a walk?He glanced down the street.The same direction hed been coming from the direction of the pub where her brothers had all been walking back from the night everything went to hell.Its not safe.She could argue that it was as safe as it ever was, that they were supposed to be back to peacetime relations with the Hallorans, and that Teague marrying the heir to the Sheridans had made sure that theyd be fine on that end as well.But the memory of James waiting for her in that club was still too fresh.It wasnt safe.It might never be safe again.The Commons?It was cold enough that she was already starting to shiver, the faint wind cutting through the thin fabric of her dress.He hesitated, and she thought he might refuse.You still have that Taser that Aiden gave you?I dont leave the house without it anymore.It wouldnt have made a difference that night when James threw her in the trunk because she hadnt had her purse, but she didnt go anywhere without it now.What had started as almost a joke was now a reassurance that she had a way to defend herself.Good.Cillian shrugged out of his coat and draped it over her shoulders.You know, it is December.Theres even snow on the ground.I didnt want to have to check a coat.She clutched the fabric more firmly around her.He was hardly underdressed in a three piece suit, but it wouldnt be long before he started to feel the cold.They made their way down the block, her heels clicking in the darkness.With the snow covering the grass and decorating the trees, it looked like something out of a fairy tale.Like if she just walked a little farther, she might find a stray street lamp that would signify shed stepped into a different world.Except that kind of thing only happened in storybooks.She slipped her arm through her brothers.There was so much to say, and nothing at all.What could she say that would make anything okay?It wasnt okay.I thought you were at Our Lady of Victories.It wasnt really a question, but she answered anyway.Sometimes I need a break.A break that no church could give her, despite what her father believed.Shed tried when she was still in high school.They spent every single Sunday morning at Mass, and shed thought that maybe the salvation she was looking for could be found inside those four walls.So shed spent hours on end there, praying with every ounce of will her sixteen year old heart could muster up.Praying for someone to save her.Silence had been her only reply.So shed gone looking for salvation in other places.In all the years since, the closest shed come to salvation was what she felt that night in Jamess arms.Two James cruised through Boston, letting his mind wander even as his route did.Finally, a few hours before dawn, he had to admit that he was stalling.It was time to go back to the house.At some point in the past, it might have actually been a sanctuary, but itd been a long time since he thought of the house where his old man had reigned like that.In reality it was more like a prison but less cheery.With a curse, he turned on the next street and started for Southie.Everything was so fucking complicated since he took over.The initial transition hadnt been tough not when the feds swooped in and took his old man away.Unforgivable as it was, James wasnt sorry to see him go.Victor Halloran would have killed Carrigan and put them in a position where none of them would walk away alive.Hell, hed planned on it.Going out in a blaze of glory and all that shit.He hadnt asked anyone else if thats what they wanted.He hadnt given a fuck.So, yeah, James wasnt exactly crying a river that his old man was locked up for the rest of his days.The part he wasnt thrilled with was being thrust into a position of leadership that hed never wanted.It was all so wrong.Brendan was the heir the one whod been trained for this shit, the one who the mantle of responsibility was supposed to fall on, the one whod step up and take over.But Brendan was dead and, in the quiet moments when James was actually alone, he couldnt help but think it was a blessing in disguise.Because, in pretty much every way that counted, Brendan was worse than their old man.Worse by a long shot.So James did the best he could, and some days he actually fooled his ass into believing it would be enough.Today wasnt one of those days, not when he still had Carrigans look of fear tattooed across his brain.Fear he fucking deserved.Goddamn it, what had he been thinking, going back to that club over and over again?That shed eventually show up and throw herself into his arms for a repeat of the first time?He knew damn well that some things couldnt be taken back and with good reason.But a stupid, idiotic part of him had dared to hope otherwise.He shook his head and pulled into the garage, lifting his hand in greeting to Michael.The man nodded in response, but he didnt relax, which was enough to kick Jamess instincts into high gear.Something was wrong.He shut off the Chevelle and climbed out.Whats up?Trouble, boss.There werent any of his men hed trust beyond a shadow of a doubt, not with Brendans specter hanging over them, and his little brother, Ricky, thinking he was hot shit now.Too many of his men didnt like the slow and steady way James preferred to do business.They thought that he should have taken up the banner of war that his old man had dropped, and run with it.Those damn fools only saw the potential profit of warnot the cost.Even if James was as bloodthirsty as they wanted him to be, he knew how to look around him and see that the odds werent in the Hallorans favor.The marriage of Teague OMalley and Callista Sheridan had allied their two families into a powerful position.Too powerful to fuck with and think hed come out on top.But these idiots werent thinking like that.They didnt care that the other two families combined had superior numbers and firepower.And they sure as fuck hadnt stopped to think about how convenient it was that the feds had shown up right in time to save the day.Someone on the other side was a rat, and a rat high enough up the ladder that the feds felt invested enough to interfere.It could be Carrigan.He brushed the thought away and focused on Michael.Tell me.The man shifted.He was always doing that, as if he had run naked through some poison oak or was jonesing for a hit of something.It didnt help that he looked a whole hell of a lot like a weasel with his narrow face and beady dark eyes.For all that, he was as trustworthy as they come, and hed never played James false.Yet.Michael looked away.Its Ricky.Of course it was.Fuck.Hed gone and mishandled shit back when they were on the verge of war, and ever since then his kid brother seemed determined to be the biggest pain in the ass known to man.Every time James turned around, he was fucking something up or pulling some stunt that put people in the hospital.Or the morgue.Whats he done now?Michael shifted again, making him want to shake the answers out of the man.He and some boys went out joyriding.It wasnt the worst they could have done untilHe stopped to think that the last time his brother and his boys went out joyriding, one of the OMalleys ended up dead.Fuck again.How hard was it to understand Jamess order not to do anything to agitate the issue between their family and either of the others who ruled in Boston?Apparently too goddamn hard.How long ago?Couple hours.Cold settled in his chest, and for once, he actually welcomed it.Cold meant he didnt have to feel, didnt have to think about how fucked up his life had gotten.Didnt have to dread what came next.He just did what was necessary.And no one thought to pick up a fucking phone and inform me of this?Michael flinched.We tried, boss.You werent answering.He fished his phone out of his pocket and, sure as fuck, there were three missed calls.Goddamn it.He thumbed through his contacts until he found his brothers number and dialed.It rang through, the generic answering service setting Jamess teeth on edge.He ground out, Get your ass home right goddamn now, Ricky.This was what his life had come to calling his brother like some sort of fucking parent whose teenager was out of control.His brother was twenty seven years old.He should be past stunts like this.He was past stunts like this.James spun on Michael.Whod he take with him?Robert and Joe.Worse and worse.Those two were more likely to pump Ricky up than keep him from getting into trouble.Shit was going down, and James had been too busy feeling sorry for himself to cut it off before it started.He cursed long and hard.He had two choices.He could go try to track down his idiot brother and hope he found him before something happened that no one could take back.But that would make him look weak as fuck, and his men would file it away.Even if they didnt do a damn thing about it now, it would come back to bite him in the ass when he could least afford it.Or he could wait here and confront Ricky from a position of power.Send him to me in the study when hes back.Will do, boss.He stalked into the house, wanting a shower and ten good hours of sleep.Neither was on the schedule at the moment.He went into the study and dropped into the chair behind the desk.The fireplace sat cold and empty, just like it had every day since his old man was taken away.Hed always hated that fire, hated coming in here, where it was so hot it felt like he was walking into hell itself and meeting with the devil.Considering his old man, it was a pretty fucking accurate description.Since he had no idea how long it would be, he got started on some paperwork that hed been avoiding for far too long.Even illegal businesses needed records, and they had only just now gotten the tally for everything that was lost in the warehouse that the Sheridans destroyed four months ago.If his old man had kept better books, they wouldnt have had to trace all the shipments back to find out exactly what was missing.They wouldnt have had to hold off three separate business deals until they could figure out if their partners were taking advantage of their lack of knowledge to screw with them.As a result, hed had to spend far too much time behind this desk.He fucking hated this desk.Sometime later, the door opened and Michael came through, dragging Ricky behind him.Jamess little brother was spitting mad, cursing like a sailor, and obviously drunk.Great.Michael didnt say shit, just shoved Ricky into the room and disappeared through the door, shutting it firmly behind him.Ricky glared at James.What the fuck?Want to try that again?Hed learned a thing or two growing up in the tender care of Victor Halloran.Control was essential.The second he let someone know theyd gotten under his skin, he lost his position of power within the conversation.That went doubly so for his brother.Fear or love.Those were the only two things that forged loyalty, and his brother wasnt showing a whole lot of either for him these days.Ricky crossed his arms over his chest and raised his chin.What.The.Fuck?So it was going to be like that.James pushed to his feet, slow and controlled, hating that his little brother flinched away from the movement.He deserved it after what hed done, and the knowledge still stuck in his throat like a chicken bone.Knowing that he was doing what he thought best to keep his people from dying in a war that wouldnt benefit anyone was the only thing that kept his remorse in check.Where were you?Didnt know that I needed to check in with my keeper before I took a piss.He wanted to reach across the space between them and smack the shit out of the little idiot.Ricky was all posturing and no brains.He acted when he wanted to act, and didnt stop to think of the waves his actions might cause.Tonight he might have just gone down to the pub with his boys.Or he could have just as easily decided to try for another drive by in enemy territory.Tell me.Now.For a second, he thought Ricky would push more, but something on his face must have scared his brother, because he finally muttered, We took a drive through OMalley territory, saw some shit, then went down to the pub for a few drinks.OMalley territory where Carrigan was once again living.The thought of something happening to her Jamess stomach gave a funny leap that had him clenching his teeth.Saw what shit?Dunno.A belligerent shrug.One of their bitches walking down the street.Thought about picking her up, but she was gone before we could.He made an effort to relax his muscles.There was no way of knowing if it was Carrigan they saw, but there was no reason to think either of her sisters would be wandering about unescorted on the same night he knew shed been out.It was too much to hope for a convenient coincidence.James sat down and folded his hands on the massive desk.Stay out of their territory.But I didnt fucking stutter, Ricky.Stay out of their territory or youll damn well wish you did.His brother stared at him for a long time, and James held the look, waiting to see what hed do.There was a confrontation coming, whether he liked it or not.When Ricky cursed and marched out of the room, slamming the door behind him, James allowed himself a silent sigh of relief.Yeah, there was a confrontation coming for sure.Thank Christ it wasnt coming tonight.*** Carrigan woke up to knocking on her door.She blinked at the clock and mentally cursed.Seven a. m.  Everyone in the family knew that it was running the risk of death to wake her up before eight, but the knocking hadnt abated.She cursed again this time aloud and struggled out of bed.It took her a few minutes to find a nightgown to drag on, but she wasnt about to answer the knock while naked.Good thing, too.Liam stood on the other side of her door, his face carefully blank as he stared at some point over her shoulder.Your father requests your presence.It wasnt a request and they both knew it.But it also wasnt Liams fault that Seamus OMalley liked to haul his children before him at the most inconvenient time.She smoothed her hair back.I dont suppose I have time to get ready?He might be her father, but she didnt like having these talks without her full armor in place.Ten minutes after waking up meant there was no chance of that something her father had no doubt considered when he sent his favorite muscle up here to wake her.As she expected, Liam shook his head.He said immediately.Naturally.She glanced down at her long nightgown.It was white and vaguely Victorian and looked like something a virgin out of a historical novel would wear.It would have to do.Then lets not keep him waiting.She closed her bedroom door behind her, but Liam didnt move out of the way.What?You went out last night.She looked around quickly to make sure no one was within hearing range.I went to church.The look he sent her told her exactly what he thought of the lie.Someone is supposed to be with you when you leave the house.Its not my fault the other men cant keep up.Liam alone was the one who allowed her to have her occasional excursion.Any of the other men would report it to her father and put a quick end to her tiny bit of freedom.She patted him on the shoulder and hurried around him, wanting to escape this conversation even more than she wanted to avoid the one waiting for her downstairs.The study?Yes.She could feel his disapproval at her back as she made her way down the staircase and through the halls to the study.Though her father sometimes held meetings in the library, his study was his preferred place of business.She hadnt had any illusions about what kind of meeting this was, but the location he chose only confirmed that this was business.She closed the door softly behind her and wished shed taken a few minutes to throw on something other that this goddamn nightgown.Father.Carrigan.He sat behind his desk, and the sheer size of it should have made him look diminished.It didnt.He looked like a king in perfect control of his kingdom the kind of man who could order someones head removed without blinking.He showed as little emotion now as his gaze coasted over her, taking her measure just like he always did when they spoke.She couldnt shake the feeling that he catalogued every new sign of age, every line or less than youthful blemish.She was twenty eight hardly an old maid but he never failed to make her feel like she had one foot in the grave.All without saying a single word.She kept her spine straight and her shoulders back, refusing to flinch away from the criticism she saw in his dark eyes.We missed you at dinner last night.He glanced at the papers scattering his desk.Both of your sisters managed to grace us with their presence after your months in the country.Their exile.Four long months spent in the Connecticut house, theoretically out of danger, while the men in the family took care of the remaining threats.It had never occurred to them to ask her what she thought of the situation, because her opinions and feelings didnt really matter as long as she was obedient.Carrigan swallowed down the old anger.Losing her cool would just reinforce her fathers belief that she was too emotional to be trusted.There was no winning with him, but she wasnt going to make things harder on herself.She clasped her hands in front of her.I was at Our Lady of Victories.Itd been too long.I see.He hadnt moved, but she couldnt shake the feeling that he was larger.More dangerous.His cold dark eyes watched her so closely, she straightened on instinct, her heart beating harder in her chest.He doesnt know.He cant possibly know.He didnt move, but suddenly the room seemed a whole hell of a lot smaller.Have you given any more thought to your decision?Here it was.She knew all the right answers to get him to hold off, but going through this song and dance was exhausting.Ive been praying.There was no hint of his thoughts on his face.The only warning she got was a slight lifting of his brows.I grow tired of this game, Carrigan.Your age is becoming an issue, a fact both you and your suitors are well aware of.Suitors.Such an old fashioned word, with more than a hint of romance if a person didnt know better.Carrigan knew better.Her father continued, Youre not going to take your vows, and we both know it.Which means its time for you to pick a husband.The list of interested men has been steadily decreasing for the last year, and its time to stop toying with them.You have until your birthday to make a decision, or Ill make it for you.Her birthday.December twenty third.A little less than a month from now.Her lungs turned to lead in her chest, each breath a searing agony that did nothing to clear the frantic buzzing of her mind.A blink of time and then itd all be over.Shed known it was coming, but some small secret part of her had hoped theyd never have this conversation.He was obviously waiting for a response, so she forced a small smile.Of course, Father.She kept her voice perfectly bland, giving no indication to the panic rising inside her with each tortured inhale.She wasnt sure she ever wanted to get married, let alone to someone her father approved of.It had worked out for Teague, but that was a one in a million chance.She wouldnt be so lucky.Im glad youre being reasonable about this.He lifted a paper and motioned for her to take it.Meaning he was glad she was doing exactly what was expected of her.Carrigan took the paper with shaking hands.It was far harder than it should have been to smile at her father as if she didnt want to be as far from him as the earth would allow.Here are the candidates who are left.Choose wisely.She managed to push to her feet and leave the study without breaking down or showing the slightest flicker of emotion, but as soon as her bedroom door closed behind her, she slumped to the ground and dropped her head into her hands.All the fighting and scheming, and for what?It was over.Tears threatened, but she pushed them back.Crying wasnt going to do a damn thing for her.It was what weak women did in the hopes of manipulating the men around them.Tears didnt work on her father.They never had.She raised her head, resolve settling in her, loosening the band around her lungs.She had to pack an entire lifes worth of living into a month.There was no other option.And it had to be good.Those memories were going to have to sustain her for the rest of her life.Three Carrigan sat in the library, trying to recapture the feeling of peace shed once been able to have here.It was no use.Everywhere she looked, she saw evidence of her father and a reminder of her deadline ticking down.Hed given her a list of eligible mena list that was apparently smaller than it had been a year ago.Like it was a shopping list that she just had to go down and choose one to spend the rest of her life with to put her safety and future in the hands of.It made her sick.She ran her hand over the soft fabric of the couch.Once upon a time, this place was her sanctuary.She used to lie here and stare at the ceiling and dream about what she wanted to do when she grew up.Back then, it had ranged from a lawyer to a fashion designer to she snorted to think about it a marine biologist.And now?What would she do if she hadnt been born a daughter in the OMalley family?She traced the pattern with a single finger.It was tempting far too tempting to indulge in the fantasy.Here, in this room, she could almost believe being a publicist was actually an option.It was a career that she could have used to the benefit of her family, if only her father would see her as something more than a set of ovaries.With a bachelors degree in communications and journalism, she easily could have let the OMalleys slip into the spotlight a little just enough to entice the media and everyone who watched it.They could manipulate public opinion and gain more power and influence as a result.But her father wouldnt even discuss it with her.As far as he was concerned, she had her place, and it was her duty as a daughter to stay in it.The door opened and she tensed, ready to smile and make some excuse to leave.Company wasnt high on her list of things she wanted at the momenthell, it wasnt on the list at all.But when Teague appeared in the doorway, she had to bite her lip to keep from throwing herself at him.She held herself perfectly still, but sheer relief at the sight of him made her giddy.Even though she knew he couldnt actually do anything to help her, his presence was a comfort she didnt know she needed until he was here in the room with her.Teague.Hey.He closed the door behind him and crossed to sit next to her.How was Connecticut?Its good to be back.Even if it meant that she didnt have a choice anymore about the direction her life was going.His dark eyes, so similar to their fathers, searched her face.Is it?Words and worries and fears welled up inside her, desperate to be put to voice.She couldnt, though.If she started talking, it would be too slippery a slope into something as dangerous as tears.Carrigan refused to cry.Refused.You know how this goes.Choice doesnt come into it.His mouth tightened.Carrigan If she let him, hed offer her a shoulder to lean on and shed never be able to stand on her own.Teague had always been too willing to act as shield to her and their sisters.It was a crying shame that he couldnt shield her from her inevitable future.How was the honeymoon?As soon as her brother had been released from the hospital, he and Callie disappeared for a few weeks to somewhere in the Caribbean.Were not talking about me.He gave her a half smile.But it was wonderful.Good.Even if her life was falling apart around her, at least one of her siblings was genuinely happy.She leaned back.Did you come to offer me congratulations?Father has me set to be engaged before the end of the year.His expression grew thunderous.Thats less than a month.Well, you know Im twenty eight.My value is only diminishing with time.And lets not even talk about my eggs.The flippant comment struck something deep inside her.She wasnt sure she even wanted children, but if she ever decided that she did, she didnt want to bring them into a world where their sole purpose was to be pawns in a game not of their choosing.Like she was.Like all her siblings were.Teague sighed and put his arm around her shoulders.Say the word and well fight him over it.Well get you and the girls out of here.We being he and his new wife, Callie.You can be free.Make your own choices.This isnt all there is to life.He isnt God, no matter what our father likes to think.The worst part was Carrigan knew he meant it.Hed ship her and the others off and willingly take the heat.And, good lord, thered be heat.Their father wouldnt take the loss of prime marriage material lying down.He might be pleased that Teague consented to marry the Sheridan heir even if no one was happy that they snuck off to the courthouse without telling anyone but that wouldnt mean hed so much as pause before he razed them and their territory to the ground for crossing him.She couldnt let him take the risk.Not for her.You know what happens if you do that, Teague.You and Callie end up dead, and he hunts us down, drags us back, and then I marry some man on his list anyway.His smile was bitter.You dont have much faith in me.I have all the faith in the world in you.But that doesnt mean Im going to let you take the fall for me.I make my own choices.Between death by marriage and death by convent.Not much of a choice when she looked at it like that especially since it looked like her father was no longer willing to consider the convent as a choice but she wasnt about to let someone else fight for her.Not when she knew theyd lose.Shed already lost too much to power games and war.They all had.She wasnt willing to lose anyone else.Promise me, Teague.Promise that you wont do anything to piss him off.Carrigan Teague sighed.What can I do?If I cant get you out of here, and I cant save you from this, what the fuck can I do?There was nothing to do, but if she told him that, it would crush him.The only thing Teague had wanted more than getting out of this life was to get her and their other sisters out as well.That he hadnt been able to do either killed him.Seeing her walk down the aisle, delivered to a man he knew she didnt love, would deliver a wound that would fester over the years.He knew she wouldnt have chosen this path for herself.He knew she wanted out as much as he did.And she knew the cost was too high to risk their fathers wrath.The same thing youve always done.Be there for me.She dropped her head onto his shoulder.He was as solid as a rock.He always had been.The contact centered her, and it must have done the same thing for him, too, since he relaxed a little.That seems like a cowardly choice.There had to be some way she could get through to him.My choice, Teague.Please dont take it away from me.Ive already had that happen one too many times.A low blow, but Carrigan wasnt above hitting him where it hurt in order to keep him safe.He had a chance at happiness.She might be a selfish bitch, but even she wasnt selfish enough to take that away from him.He hissed out a breath, the barb striking true.Damn it.Needing to change the subject and put them back on more familiar and safe ground, she said, How goes the wedding planning?Both their parents and Callies father refused to acknowledge that their marriage was legitimate until they did things right.Carrigan found it darkly amusing that there was no end to the sins her father could commit and still sleep at night, but seeing one of his children married without an actual wedding was one he couldnt live with.But then, shed always known he had skewed priorities and that wasnt even getting into their mother.She took their courthouse marriage as a personal insult, and as a result she was determined to plan the largest and most extravagant affair she could to make up for it.For her part, Carrigan was just happy the wedding planning kept her mothers attention elsewhere.The last thing she needed was her other parent meddling alongside her fathers determination to match her up with someone on his list.This time Teagues sigh was less agitated.For all her protests, Callies taken the whole thing well in hand.Shes gone head to head with our mother a few times, from what I understand, and come out on top at least half the time.Half?Impressive.She was surprised their mother had conceded anything let alone multiple anythings.But then, she already knew Callie was something else.The woman had held herself together in the face of certain death and managed to work with Carrigan to get them both to safety.If there was going to be someone to put Aileen OMalley in her place, it would be Callie Sheridan.She smiled at the thought.I like her.I like her, too.Teague grinned, some of his worry melting away.Love did shit like that.Carrigan stamped down on the envy threatening to take root.Teague was lucky, and she didnt begrudge him that, though part of her wished shed be able to find the same connection with someone.She knew better.If she agreed to marry one of the men on her fathers list, it wouldnt be a love match.Do you think He hesitated.Do you know which way youre going?She didnt need him to clarify.I dont really have a choice.The convent hadnt really been an option for her.It was a bargaining chip shed used to keep her fathers ambitions at bay.That was it.Her life would have been a lot simpler if she had a higher religious calling.Or if Id been born with a penis.Maybe then her opinions and plans would actually have had merit in their fathers eyes.All thats left is to pick the groom.Dont make any hasty decisions.She laughed.Teague, I have a month.The only thing left to me is hasty decisions.Just remember all you need to do is say the word and Ill get you out.She hugged him.I know.Just like she knew shed never say the word.Teague had stood as protector between her and problems in the past.Or tried to.It never quite worked out like either of them wanted it to, and she wasnt about to place bets that this time would be the exception to the rule.All that was left to her was to go on the expected dates and pick the least horrible one of the bunch.Then it was a matter of hoping for the best.She could stack the deck in her favor to make up for the lack of choices, but in the end it all came down to whoever she chose to hitch her wagon to.There was no reason to expect that shed enjoy spending time with any of the men, since she fully expected her father to pick men similar to the caliber of man he was.God, she hated this.Carrigan patted her brothers hand and rose.The longer she procrastinated, the less time shed ultimately have.It was better to bite the bullet now and get this shit started.Ill talk to you later.
