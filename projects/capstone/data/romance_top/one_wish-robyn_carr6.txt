Theres a DVD with the package.Should be instructions and safety measures.Ill feel a lot more comfortable knowing Grace has something handy she can use to protect herself if...well, you know.She had that scare years ago.I dont think were dealing with the same set of circumstances, Troy.I get that, but wouldnt you feel better, if it was Iris, knowing she had some kind of self protection?Seth laughed.Have you met Iriss left hook?he asked.Im not sure Id arm her on top of that.Grace needs a little something, if only for her confidence.Yeah?Well, be careful.Dont sneak up on her, Seth advised.I wouldnt mind having a look at the DVD after youve seen it.If you dont mind.Not at all.He opened the shops front door and yelled, Gracie?Troy!Come and see!Youre not going to believe how cool this is!It even comes with a holster!He walked into the workroom and the box stood open on the table.Scattered about was packing material, extra Taser cartridges, two small pepper spray cartridges, a DVD and a catalog.Look at this!she said, turning to one side so he could see the Taser affixed to a leather belt that was far too large.She took a gunfighters stance, arms out at her sides.Then she did a fast draw, popped the Taser off the belt, pointed and...Shot him.She screamed and dropped the Taser while Troy felt the jolt go through him.He stiffened, trembled and down he went.His hearing was fine, even if he couldnt move his body.In fact, his hearing was a little too goodGrace wouldnt stop screaming.Troy!Troy!Troy!Oh, my God, Troy!All he could do was twitch on the floor.Suddenly she stopped.He heard her talking into her phone.Its Grace at the flower shop!Send the doctor and hurry!I shot Troy!I electrocuted him!He might be dead!As the stinging shock passed, he lay still and pain free, except for the back of his head, which had hit the floor pretty hard.And his right thigh, where the Taser prongs hit.A few more inches and hed have been a eunuch.Seth crouched beside Troy, grinning.Well.That works pretty good.Shut up.Great idea, Troy.Get a figure skater a stun gun.I said, shut up.Good thing it wasnt a Magnum.He chuckled.I dont think she watched the DVD.What do you think?Troy groaned and struggled into a sitting position.There was a small amount of blood, very small, where one of the prongs stuck into his jeans, his flesh.He reached for it and Seth grabbed his wrist.Leave it, since Grace called for a doctor.Or I could take it out for you.Then she was there, kneeling on his other side.Oh, my God, Troy!It just fired itself!Because you had your finger on the trigger!Dont you know you cant put your finger on the trigger?I didnt!I mean, I didnt think I did.Oh, Troy, Im so sorry!Scotts coming.Do you see where this is?Im lucky he isnt going to pull it out of my dick!Didnt I tell you not to open the box?You could have neutered me!Seth smothered a chuckle as he stood.I guess you turned it on, right, Grace?The instructions said it wouldnt fire just because it was armed.You have to turn it on because it runs on batteries, but...Oh, never mind.I didnt mean to, I promise.Grace added some tears to her apology, hovering and begging for his forgiveness.All right, all right, he said.I think youre perfectly safe from any potential attackers.Might want to work on your aim so you dont kill the poor bastard.Troy, really, I thought it would take a little pressure to make it fire!I cant believe I shot you!Oh, God, Im so sorry.I would never hurt you!The shop door crashed open and Scott Grant, breathless, ran in carrying his medical bag.Take it easy, Seth said in a calm voice.It was just a Taser.Hes fine.Just a Taser?Troy said.It came a little close to the next generation of schoolteachers!Grace obviously has a shaky trigger finger.Right behind Scott was Peyton and their office manager, Devon.Behind them was Carrie, who shouldnt be able to move that fast with her bad knees.Then crowding into the little shop was Waylan from the bar across the street and at least two of his customers and, in addition, every person who happened to be outside or even driving by when Scott Grant was seen running down the street with his medical bag.Scott, panting, stopped in the workroom doorway to catch his breath.Jesus, you took ten years off my life.I thought you shot him!I did, but I shot him with this, Grace said, reaching for the Taser that lay on the floor where she had dropped it.No!at least four people shouted at once.Troy grabbed her and pulled her toward him.Gracie, its still got voltage.If you accidentally pulled the trigger again, youd give me another blast.Oh, God!Troy, this isnt going to work.I cant be trusted with one of those things.Im going to kill someone.Id be better off with a road flare.Ever hear of the great Chicago fire?Seth muttered to Scott.Shh, I forgive you already, Troy said.Just dont touch it again until we figure it out.Scott Grant crouched next to Troy, his open bag beside him.Why didnt you take these prongs out?Seth told me not to.We usually have to call medical for that, Seth said.Not that I think its necessary, but I figured...Not complicated, Scott said, moving one slightly so it slid right out.They were shaped like small apostrophes and pulling it straight out could make it bleed a little, but wasnt likely to even require stitches.He then removed the second prong.There.Feel better?Im fine, Troy said.Im not, Grace said.Im not fine.I almost killed my boyfriend.Nah, not even close, Scott said, standing.Want a Band Aid for that, Troy?Funny, Troy said, standing.Lets joke around after youve taken your hit.I dont know how much physical damage was caused, but your mood is definitely affected, Scott said, smiling.Thats when Troy heard all the voices from the shop.She shot him with the Taser.Worried about that note, so he bought her a Taser.Its just a Taser.Yeah?You ever been hit by a Taser?Damn near killed my cat with one of those!At least something interesting finally happened.Lets have a beer on that, should we?And there was laughter all around as the shop emptied of everyone but Seth.Damn, Troy said, giving his leg a shake as if to bring the feeling back into it.That sucker packs a punch!Im going to leave now if you think you can manage the situation without further injuries, Seth said.Youre going to tell Iris, arent you?Grace asked.Seth nodded.Im thinking of quitting early.I cant wait to get home.Im never going to hear the end of this, she said.I guess everyone knows about my note.They dont all know what it said or how it was written out.Just that it upset you and were looking for a prankster.If gossip works like usual around here, I think youre probably safe.Then he smiled.Have a nice evening.* * *  				Seth was home by five oclock and Iris walked in right behind him.Iris laughed so hard at Seths tale that she could hardly stay upright.Oh, shes right, shes never going to hear the end of it.Poor Grace.How does that thing work?Let me see yours, Seth.Ah, no thanks, Iris.You never touch my weapons, right?Because that wouldnt be good.You dont know anything about them.Maybe you should train me, she suggested, then giggled again.Youre doing just fine not touching.Aw, come on, she said, moving closer to him, sliding her arms around his neck.Instead of arguing with her, he kissed her.Then he kissed her more seriously, sliding his hands over her butt and pulling her close.After a little more kissing, he said, I have an idea...Before supper on a Wednesday afternoon?Why, Deputy...Are you expecting company?Only your mother, she said.But ever since she caught you in your boxers, she calls ahead if your car is home.Good.Troy said something interesting.He told Grace that a few inches to the left and she could have wiped out the next generation of schoolteachers and I thought, dont we have work to do?I wouldnt call it work, exactly.Wouldnt it be easier to do naked?Absolutely, she agreed.But then we have to stay in bed for a while.I can do that.Im very good at staying in bed with you.Are we making any progress on the next generation of deputies and school counselors?I dont know, Seth.Weve only stopped using protection for a few months and Peyton said to check with her if we have no results in six months.Im doing my best.And you are definitely doing your best.He kissed her again.I love when you talk dirty.She laughed.I havent started talking dirty yet.I just said you were doing your best...I can do better, he said, and his voice had grown husky.A half hour later, as they lay tangled in the sheets, Iris said, That was better.That had to make a baby.That was good, Seth said.Maybe two babies.I only want one at a time, if its all the same to you.Are you hungry?he asked.Yes, but Im staying in bed for thirty minutes to give those little guys time to swim.Then we can get up and eat.We dont have to get up.Ill be right back.He found his boxers and disappeared.Iris snuggled into the sheets, her head against the pillow.There were so many times, like now, that she couldnt believe her life had worked out the way it had.Shed loved Seth since she was just a girl, but theyd been estranged for seventeen years while they took different journeys.Hers took her to university and a postgrad program in counseling to bring her back to Thunder Point as the high school counselor.Seth had gone from the football field to a long recovery from injuries he sustained in a terrible car accident, but in the end his choice of law enforcement brought him home.And now he was hers again.All hers.It wasnt very long before he was back.Iris had actually dozed a little.Seth held a tray with one plate that held two grilled cheese, bacon and tomato sandwiches, pickles, a glass of wine and a bottled beer, a bag of chips held tenderly under one arm.Here we go, he said.Its not much, but it was fast and I bet its good.Scoot over, he said.He put the tray between them and sat on the bed.He passed the wine to her hand and lifted his beer.To us.Iris brought the wine to her lips and to Seths dismay, she sniffed.He took a big swallow of beer and when he looked at her again, tears were running down her cheeks.Iris?Her nose turned a little pink.This is all Ive ever wished for, she said.A small sob followed.Grilled cheese?he asked.You.You and me, together, in love, trying to make a baby.I didnt even hope for a baby.I thought that was impossible.Just you and me, thats all I ever wished for.I love you so much.He frowned.Then he took her glass of wine from her.Congratulations.I bet anything youre pregnant.What do you mean?You dont know anything.I do so.I listen to men talk about their wives.I dont want toI hate all that talkbut it happens all around me.First their wives cry, then they throw up, then they get grumpy, then they nest, then they whelp.He put the wine on the bedside table.Bet you anything, he said.Whelp?she asked with a sniff.You know, he said, taking a big bite of grilled cheese.He chewed and swallowed.Then he grinned at her.Bet I nailed you last week.I was outstanding.Youre an arrogant know it all, she said, reaching for a tissue.And youre pregnant.He pushed the tray toward her.Have a sandwich, honey.And if youre still hungry, Ill make you another one.* * *  				Scott was working late so Peyton got the kids ready for bed and settled them with their tablets and movies in their beds.Then she collected the tablets and turned them off and kissed the kids.She cleaned up the tent the kids had made with blankets over the dining room table.Shed been in the tent with them for a little story time earlier.She had her shower, put on soft lounging pajamas that were nice and warm.She lit a couple of candles in the darkened living room.She put wineglasses out next to a bottle chilling in an ice bucket.But she turned on the lamp beside her on the couch to read for a while before Scott finished up in Bandon.It wasnt very late when he texted her.On my way.Need anything?Just you, big boy.Fifteen minutes later he came in from the garage and left his bag in the kitchen.When he took in the darkened room, the ice bucket, glasses and candles, he smiled at her.Are you planning to seduce me?Could be.Are you covered with blood and guts?Nah.I washed up.Lets get on with the seduction!No one ever accused you of being shy, did they?Peyton said.She lifted the bottle out of the ice bucket, poured and handed him a glass.I do have something to tell you.You know how we decided that Id go off the pill but wed use protection for a couple of months until my body got used to the idea?Uh huh.I mightve gotten carried away once, he said.Actually, five times.At least.So, cheers, she said, clinking his glass.I really dont mind when you get carried away.Its kind of fun.He sipped.Peyton, I think this wine is bad.It tastes sour.Its sparkling cider, she said.You did it, you brute.You knocked me up before the wedding.He grinned stupidly.Peyton!Thats wonderful!Then he was stunned silent for a moment.Crap, he finally said.Your father is going to kill me.Im a little terrified of your father, did I mention that?Paco?Hes all bluster.But, I think we wont tell him.Or Mama either, for that matter.Do you think you can keep your mouth shut around the grandmothers?Oh, sure.I dont tell them anything.Theyre a pain in my ass.But its going to be hard not to tell some of the guys.You knowSpencer, Coop, Seth.Try.Because at least two of those three have big mouths and theyre coming to the wedding.It would be just like one of them to toast the bride and groom and baby.However, when I dont drink, someones bound to ask.They know were together.You can tell them youre five minutes pregnant.Just how pregnant are you?Five minutes.I havent missed a period yet but I peed on a stick.You did?Uh huh.Iris came in to set up a prenatal appointment.Shes five minutes pregnant and it made me just wonder.Good for Iris!They want a baby!And by the way, we want a baby.This isnt going to screw up your plans, is it?I mean, the big wedding, the dress, the flowers, all that stuff?Youre not going to get morning sickness at the altar or anything, are you?No.And youre still planning to seduce me tonight?Yes, Scott.I put your children to bed and when youve lost your mind on the sparkling cider Im going to strip and make you crazy.He leaned toward her, slid a hand under her sheet of black hair and pulled her closer.I do love that.If you havent folded up the tent, we could do it in there.Id rather do it in bed.He touched her lips with his.I love you.Have I told you that lately?Several times a day.And I love you, but apparently you have a real talent for procreation.Im going to keep my eye on you.Thank you, Peyton.I really want children with you.At least a few.I agreed to one so far.Lets see how it goes.Its going to be great.Your family specializes in big herds.Your grandmother had the last child at forty six.In your dreams, doctor hottie, she said, kissing him.Hmm.Do I have to drink this, he said, holding his glass up.It tastes like shit.She laughed.If I have to be off wine for nine months, then shouldnt you?As a sign of solidarity?Absolutely, Ill swear off wine if it makes you happy.Thank God, Im a beer man.Now come on, enough talk about dietary restrictionslets get you naked.* * *  				Troy asked Grace several times if it would be best to cancel his friend Dennys weekend visit.No, she said.In fact, it might be better to have things to do, people around.But, Troy, do you have to tell them I shot you?No, I dont have to, but if we introduce them to anyone in town, theyre going to find out.Oh, God, she moaned.Things were so quiet, then...All of a sudden, he agreed.Well, it still isnt bigger than we are, babe.The early April weather cooperated.Every day was sunny and bright except when those afternoon showers came in over the Pacific.The days had grown longer and Grace could keep the shop open until six and still close in daylight.The downside was that after Denny and Beccas visit, Troy was going to be needed more at the beach barpeople would start migrating to Coopers for sunset.The weather was warmer, and more people were seen outside, walking rather than driving.While it gnawed at Grace that someone could send her a note identical to the ones Bruno sent before capturing her, knowing he was under wraps brought her some peace of mind.And while she was loath to admit it, seeing that Taser take down her boyfriend gave her a little confidence.Aside from the confusion about a motive, she was quickly feeling calmer.She did not, however, wear the Taser on her belt.She handled it very carefully.She carried it in her purse and it was turned off!On Friday afternoon at around five oclock, Troy brought a lovely young couple to the flower shop to meet Grace.Denny was a tall, handsome man in his late twenties and his wife was a pretty blonde with the sweetest little baby bump.They introduced themselves, looked around the shop appreciatively and thanked her for welcoming them so nicely.And then Becca froze.Her mouth stood open slightly and she covered it with her hand.She stared at Grace, wide eyed.Oh, my God!she said.Youre her!Youre Izzy Banks!Twelve  				It turned out that Becca Cutler had been hooked on figure skating and kept up with all the competitions.She loved it all, pairs, ice dancing, long programs, short programs.When it wasnt Winter Games, she watched national and world championships on ESPN.Becca and Grace were the same age.They literally grew up together.Grace admitted who she was.After closing up the flower shop, they drove out to Coopers so Troy could show his friends his other place of employment.Not too different from your little bar in Virgin River, Troy said.Just a different landscape.Cooper and Denny shook hands like old friends.Jack sends his best.Said to call him if you need anything.I need his cook if Im going to get rich.Tell him to send Preacher, Cooper said.Like thatll ever happen, Denny said.Take a table, the weathers great.Beer on the house for my friends.What can I get the little lady with that expectant look in her eye?Just a noncaffeine cola, if you have it.Sorry, darlin, but everything here is high test except the light beer.Theres green tea in the cooler, Troy said.Ill get you one.Can I have one, too?Grace asked.Ill drink along with the preggers, here.Grace was greeted by a number of people as she and Becca went out on the deck, where it was still cool enough that they had to stay wrapped in their sweaters.The men stayed inside.Cooper brought the women some chips.He leaned down to whisper in Graces ear.You doing okay, Gracie?Im fine, Coop.Thanks.If you need Troy next week, all you have to do is say so.We back each other up out here on the water.Thanks, she said.I forget sometimes how great people are here.Never forget, he said, giving her hand a pat.When he left, Becca was smiling.This reminds me a little of Virgin River, she said.Everyone is so bonded.I can see they all love you, Grace.I think I took that for granted.But tell me how you knew who I was?Seriously?You were always my favorite.I watched you compete in all the big events!How could I be your favorite?Grace asked.I didnt think I was anyones favorite!You were everyones favorite!No, she said, shaking her head.I had the worst reputation in the business.People called me rich and snotty.My scores always suffered most because of my facial expressions!I never smiled enough for the judges.Really?I thought everyone was rooting for Fiona Temple.She was the underdog.Underdogs always get attention, in all sports.But you?You were gifted, people said so all the time.A natural on the ice.And scared.You were just a scared kid.But in the Vancouver Games, you nailed it.You owned that competitionthere was no contest.There hasnt been a competition like that since.Every newcomer is compared to you.Fiona was a good skater, but a total poser.They caught shots of her cursing or scowling all the time, showing she wasnt the sweet darling she pretended to be for interviews.I bet she was mean.Grace was stunned.As a snake, she said.People knew?Becca shrugged.I bet they did.Dont you remember what people said about you?Your reviews?Kiddo, you stole the show.She had to shake herself.She only remembered the very critical comments.Why did you quit?Becca asked.Its a long story, but it boils down to thisI couldnt take the pressure anymore.Id gone as high as I could go and I was exhausted.I like my life better now, hard as that might be to understand.Not hard at all, she said with a laugh.A good life, a good man like Troy?Thats more than a lot of people have.Tell me about you and Denny, Grace said.Talk about a long story!she said.She launched happily into her tale of on again, off again romance that finally stuck after she chased Denny to Virgin River and captured him with a broken ankle.She was getting to the wedding and her decision to stay in the mountains with the love of her life when Denny and Troy joined them on the deck, adding bits and pieces to her story.The sun was sinking in the sky when Troy announced that hed made reservations at Cliffhangers for dinner.Think about what youd like to see and do while youre here, Troy said.The weather is supposed to be good all weekend and the coast is beautiful.I can think of one thing Id absolutely die to do, Becca said.Id so love to see you skate, Izzy...I mean Grace!Troy put an arm around Graces shoulders.Gracie doesnt skate anymore, he said.Actually, I do, Grace said.Theres a rink in North Bend where the owner lets me skate before they open in the morning.Its early, though.Oh, my God, that would be so awesome, Becca said excitedly.Troy put a thumb and finger on Graces chin, turning her face toward him.Youre skating again?Now and then.Secretly.Just because, you know...I dont know.Because Ive been skating my whole life, but for the past five years not for an audience.Except the owner of the rink.Why didnt you tell me?he whispered.Because I dont want to coach or compete and I wanted you to believe that.Gracie, I believe everything you tell me.So, youll skate for me now?Would you like that?Only if it feels right to you.I think Id like to.If you promise you can love a flower girl.He just smiled at her.* * *  				That Friday night was more fun than Grace had had in years.Seth and Iris were at Cliffs, sitting up at the bar eating crab cakes, so they picked up their plates and joined them.Cliff teasingly asked Grace if she was packing tonight and the story of the Taser came out to the hysterical laughter of everyone but Grace.After Denny and Becca were dropped back at Troys apartment, Grace and Troy went to her loft, to bed.But there was no sleeping.They cuddled close and talked late into the night.Grace was enchanted by Troys friends; she loved what they seemed to have together.Do we have anything close to that?she asked him.Close, he said.If Im not kidding myself, I think were building something that could be solid.You dont talk about the future with me, she said.Do you want something like what your friends have?A marriage?Children?Of course I do.But, Gracie, weve been together three months and change.Thats not long enough.There are a few things we still have to sort out.Like what?Well, lets start with how many more secrets youre keeping.Troy, Im not keeping secrets!I didnt know you were skating.Couldnt you trust me with that?Oh, Troy, thats not a secret.Ive only been on the ice a few times since right after Christmas.There hasnt been time!Youve kept me too busy.And besides, I only do a little skating now and then to keep in shape.But why didnt you mention it?Thats something I would have told you.I dont know.I guess because I dont want anyone to say I shouldnt give it up.I know its something Im good at, but everything that goes with it...Grace, you could have told me that.Im sure there are plenty of things you havent told me, she said hopefully.He shook his head.I cant think of anything.Nothing that has an impact on us.Im just glad Becca brought it out of you because I cant wait to see you perform.And I think if were just patient, as we get closer, youll realize you dont have to be afraid of how Ill react.She wasnt so sure about that.* * *  				Spending time with pregnant Becca brought Grace back to reality.She was sidetracked, busy, and she realized she still hadnt gotten her period and couldnt start the pills yet.She suddenly realized it must be late.She hadnt thought about itlife had been too crazy.First the note came, then she almost killed Troy with the Taser and then his friends came for a weekend visit...And now she lay in his arms listening to him whisper his love, as well as his concern that she kept things from him.* * *  				Grace dug out her tights and skates before first light.She had a flouncy little blue skirt and pulled her hair back into a ponytail.There was a time she had as many pairs of skates as other girls had shoes, with one pair she loved best.One that brought her luck.That was the only pair she had kept.Troy, Becca and Denny drove to the rink in North Bend at seven on Saturday morning.Grace took the flower van so she could work for a while after the skating.The rink would officially open at ten.Becca was wriggling with excitement.Grace explained that she had to stretch and warm up before she could do any real skating.And please remember, I havent trained in years.Im not on top of my game.Just a few tricks, thats all I have.Jake Galbraith met them at the door.Well, an audience?That holds promise.Its just a favor for a friend, she said.Its still private.And I still hope youll train the younger girls one day.It would be a dream come true for them.I wouldnt make a good coach, she said.Youd make a phenomenal coach, he said.You want some music?If its not too much trouble.Grace took her time warming up.She stretched out on a mat in the girls locker room, then laced up her skates and raced around the rink a few times, doing front and back crossovers, a few jumps.The music came on, her Gershwin training music, and she started with a few easy moves, working up to the more difficult jumps and spins.She took a spill but got herself up and carried on.She didnt look at her audience but sprayed the ice in their direction a couple of times.She was lost in back crosses, front crosses, figure eights, spins and axels.Then Alicia Keys blasted into the arena and Grace put on a show.She didnt think about anything but skating.She could lose herself so easily.She didnt try anything fancy, all she wanted to do was make it pretty for Becca.And for Troy.If she were up to speed there would be triple axels and risky jumps, but she was smart enough to know shed only hurt herself by taking ridiculous chances.The reason she kept skating was simple.When there was no competition, she felt free, beautiful and fearless.She loved what she could do on the ice.Shed been on the ice about a half hour, but steady and hard.She skated around the rink to cool down, then she made her way back to her audience, smooth and sleek, hands on her hips.Not much, but thats all I have without training, she said.That was awesome, Becca said.I would give anything to be able to skate, even a little bit.Tell you whatwhen youre not carrying around a little bump, well get you on skates.It would take about fifteen years of hard training to do some of those moves, but there are some easy things I can show you.I would love that so much.Grace looked at Troy and he was smiling.I guess I understand why people try to get you to skate professionally again.Or coach.I think that was a compliment, so thanks.But I really like what Im doing now.And I have to be a drudge nowyou guys go play.Im going to have to open the shop for at least a few hours today.I can catch up with you later.Youre in good handsTroy is the fun coach.Thank you, Grace, Becca said.I know you wouldnt have done that for just anyone.It was time to share that part of me with Troy, she said.And now I have to get into the flower business.Do you need me?Troy asked.Nah.Its a sunny Saturday morning.Ill let you walk me to my van, though.Were going to see some more of the coast since were this far north.Then tonight Im cooking for us, Becca said.Get your flower chores done and this evening youre going to relax and let me pamper you.Just a word of warning.When Troy tries to talk you into getting closer to the really big waves, dont do it.Enough, he said.When Grace had her boots on, she left her usual hundred dollars with Jake for his scholarship fund.At the van, Troy gave her a kiss that he didnt seem to want to stop.She liked that so much.Thirteen  				Grace prepared a special order of four expensive centerpieces for a customer.An exclusive golf resort in Bandon had a guest who was throwing a party in one of the spacious cottages and wanted a delivery on Sunday afternoon.She could have told them she was closed on Sunday, but the resort was a regular customer, had an account with her and it was an easy five hundred dollars.She made up the arrangements on Saturday and put them in the cooler, then enjoyed dinner with Troy and his friends at his apartment.After dinner they played poker, and she cleaned house.She told Troy she was going to be closed on Sunday as usual but would make a delivery to the resort in Bandon in the afternoon.Becca and Denny are leaving around noon and spring break is next weekIm off.Ill go with you.I love that place.Someday I might even be able to afford to play golf there.Once, though.Ill only be able to afford it once.They set out at about one oclock on Sunday.The resort was a beautiful place with lodges, cabins and rooms, not to mention fine dining and gorgeous facilities that could be reserved for everything from weddings to business meetings.There were three golf courses and it was expensive.People traveled from all over the country to stay there.And they liked Graces flowers.They didnt use her all the time, but when a guest had a special function that required flowers, they recommended her.She billed the resort and they paid promptly.She had the unit number for the cottage where the flowers were to be delivered and she knew her way around the country club.As they drove through the property, she had to slow for a couple of deer crossing the road.Cottage?Troy asked.I know, she said, laughing.I looked it up online.Living room, four bedrooms, galley kitchen, fireplaces in every room, plus four bathrooms.And a view.Id kill to live in a house that big, he said.She backed up to the unit.You take one, Ill take one and well go back for the other two.Try not to gawk too much.Itll be hard.She was proud of the flowers shed put togetherlilies, orchids, bird of paradise, roses, babys breath and greenery.She balanced her arrangement on one hand and rang the bell.Troy waited right behind her with his flowers.In a moment the door opened.Grace looked into the blue eyes of Winnie Dillon Banks and dropped her floral arrangement.The ceramic dish shattered and water splashed on her jeans, but the flowers stayed in a lump because she had fastened them into the base with tape.Mother!Izzy, she said smoothly.Holy shitballs, Troy said.There stood the indomitable Winnie, small like Grace, ivory skin, black hair and red lips.She could double for Snow White.Except for the expression, which was not sweet.No, he couldnt see Winnie singing to the birdies in the forest.But she was so beautiful.And she radiated power.Troy noticed that Grace began to tremble a little.She must feel so vulnerable in front of her mother.Please come inside, Izzy, she said.Ill arrange for that to be cleaned up.What are you doing here?Why?I need to see you.Talk to you.You can send your helper away.Ill make sure you have transportation.Hes not my helper!Hes my boyfriend!What the hell is this?Why didnt you call me, tell me you were in the area?Because you wouldnt have seen me, she said.Precisely.Because I am dead to you, remember?Look, I take it back.I take it all back.Izzy, you have to give this a chance.I only want to help you!Fine.Youd be helping by acting like a normal mother.That means you communicate.You call and ask if Im available to visit with you.And if this is about returning to professional skating, theres no need to waste your time.I only want whats best for you.I want you settled!Let me help.I am settled!Working in a flower shop!My flower shop, my business, that I built on my own!Grace stooped and began to pick up the flowers, sans ceramic dish.She stood, holding most of the arrangement, and kicked the broken pieces off the walk and into the bushes.Where do you want this?The patio?Winnie said, standing aside.Grace walked in and Troy followed her.Winnie tried to stop him by holding out her hands for the flowers he carried.Ill take that, she said.He ignored her and put them down on the first available surface, the small breakfast table.A woman stood near the patio doors.She was around fifty, very short reddish brown hair, casually dressed in slacks and a sweater.Thank you, Virginia, you can go back to what you were doing.And you can leave us, young man.This business is between me and my daughter.Im not leaving, he said.Just tell me what you want, Mother, Grace said when she came back from the patio.Im not comfortable talking in front of a stranger.Oh, forgive me, Winnie, Grace said.This is my boyfriend, Troy Headly.He came with me to help me deliver these bogus flowers.You might as well spit it out because Im going to tell him everything we say to each other anyway.Winnie sank into the nearest chair.I thought we could have a conversation.She appeared to be near tears.Youre all I have left.That isnt my fault.Im done skating, I havent changed my mind about that.There are other options.I get emails and calls all the time.You could report on the competitions.CBS or ESPN would take you to the Games!You could coach!You could consult!Hell, the committee would be thrilled to have you!There are so many things...No, she said.No, no, no.Im done.I dont want to coach, dont want to push young girls the way I was pushed!I dont want to report on the sport, critique and label figure skaters the way I was labeled.I dont want to consult or serve on any related committees.But you still skate!Grace was stunned.How did she know?For pleasure, to keep in shape, and thats all.I dont want to skate professionally or work in the industry.But why?Its what you know!Winnie said pleadingly.It was our life!Because I dont love it enough to give so much of myself.Im very grateful that I had such wonderful opportunities, but its time to move on.Im retired from that life.I have a new life.Winnie stood.Youll have children, she said, her voice shaking a little bit.A daughter.Shell be born with it, like you were.Will you forbid her?If Im lucky enough to have a daughter someday, Ill support her, but Im not going to ride herd on her twenty four hours a day.Im not going to expect her to live out my dream.Im going to tell you for the hundredth time, the only way we can communicate is if you give this up!Are you really happier, Izzy?Living in a tiny room over a flower shop, toiling seven days a week to make centerpieces for people you dont even know?You have a legacy.Your time is nearly upif you wait many more years, these opportunities will dry up and youll be forgotten!Only if theres a God, Grace said.She whirled around and left the house.Troy just watched her go, not knowing what to do.When Grace came back with another floral arrangement, he caught on.Of course, even though this was a ruse, she would leave the flowers and the resort would pay her and bill Winnie.She put her large and beautiful arrangement on the coffee table and went back to the van.It was as if his feet were glued to the floor.He was mesmerized by Winnie, dressed in a silk pantsuit in a rose color, complete with jewelry that was daunting.Diamonds on her fingers, gold on her wrists.When Grace said her mother was rich, he really couldnt make a mental picture of it, but he was getting there now.It wasnt just the clothing or the classy digs she could easily afford, it was the power she thought she had.Winnie speaks and the world comes to heel.He had no experience with the wealthy.At least not that he was aware of.There were business owners in town who must be doing well.Cooper was building houses on the hill, so he must be pretty set.Cliff owned the restaurant and a goodly share of the marina, so he had heard.Grace looked very much like her mother, but he couldnt imagine her becoming this person.Grace was soft and loving; she wasnt controlling or manipulative.Not his Gracie.Grace came back with the final floral arrangement.Tears were running down her cheeks.She put it down on the coffee table beside the last one.Then she looked at her mother.I know what youve done, you know.Winnie stiffened as if slapped.She was clearly stunned by this statement, or maybe by the tears.You placed an order for flowers that you knew I wouldnt be able to resist and asked for them to be delivered on Sunday, when the shop was closed, when I had no delivery help so I would be forced to come to you.Why, Mother?Why couldnt you just love me for myself?Why did you only love me for the gold medals?Izzy, why do you act like it was a curse?We conquered the world!Winnie said.Her expression was pleading.No, it was yearning.Because of your skill, the training the other athletes couldnt afford, because of the dedication, the commitment I made to training, travel, everything you needed to get to the top, we had the dream.My parents didnt care.They paid the bills but never believed in me the way I believed in you.But together, we did it!We were the most powerful mother and daughter in womens figure skating in the world!It meant everything to me.I couldnt do it, but with my help you could.Grace shook her head sadly.Im so sorry for you, Mama, she said quietly.I love you, but Im never going to change my mind.All right, then!Winnie shouted.Stay.Send him away, stay awhile and lets just talk.Grace shook her head.Maybe some other time.Sometime when you havent tried to trick me or back me into a corner.Grace turned and went back to the van.Troy followed, slowly closing the door as he left the cottage.My God, he thought.No wonder Grace couldnt trust anyone.The people who should be most protective and devoted, like her mother, used her.He caught up with her just as she was getting in the drivers side.Let me drive for you, babe, he said, reaching for the keys.She wiped at her eyes.No.Thank you, but no.Im fine.He hurried around to his side, buckling in.Well, that was pretty terrifying, he said.I think I understand now.She gave a little hiccup and had to wipe her eyes again.She started slowly driving away from the cottage.Poor little rich girl?she asked.I think Winnie is the impoverished one.She has no idea all she lost.If you win gold medals in the end, youre not allowed to complain about how hard life is.Its self pitying.Winning is hard and the cost is high.Even if you throw in a bad reputation, a lawsuit, constant pressure, a couple of stalkers, a kidnapping and She stopped talking.Then she slammed on the brakes.Troy braced a hand on the dash just before hitting his head.She turned wild eyes toward him.Shit!she said.Then she threw the car into Park, unbuckled, got out and ran down the street, back to the cottage.Troy was too shocked to move for a moment.Then he jumped out and followed her, leaving the van abandoned in the middle of the road, still running.He chased her right to the cottage.Grace barged in without knocking.Her mother sat in the chair.My God, Grace said.How could you do that to me?Are you really that selfish?Grace, whats going on?Troy asked.The note, she said, but she looked at Winnie, not Troy.She sent it.To scare me so Id come home.Winnie didnt respond.She raised her chin defiantly.Are you really crazy?As in, need medication crazy?Or have you absolutely no shame?Your only child?The child who gave you what you wanted, you would do this to me?I was terrified!Nothing happened, did it?Winnie said.Grace shook her head.I think it might take me a lifetime to recover from you.I gave you everything!I gave you my whole life!Well, Im giving it back to you.Leave me alone.Grace turned and marched back to the van.Troy had to jog to catch up.Okay, I am driving, he said, pushing her around to the passenger side of the van.Youre really in no shape.She didnt argue with him.She silently stared through her window while he navigated the winding road out of the resort, past woods, oceanfront, golf courses and three large clubhouses.He didnt say anything and heard the occasional sniff coming from her side of the van.All right, look, lots of people have crazy families, he finally said.She didnt respond.Most, I think, he added.In fact, as dysfunctional goes, most families have bigger and tougher issues than a rich mother who pushed you to win gold medals.So, your heart is a little broken, but youre an adult and can decide for yourself how you want to live your life.Think about what some people deal withdeath, divorce, abuse, addiction, all kinds of dark secrets.Your mother pushed you and had her own agenda but she never physically hurt you, right?Its emotional abuse, I get that, but, Gracie, honey, youre okay.Youre better than okay.You have your head on straight, youre a good, kind person, you know whats really important in life.So shes a pain in the ass.You dont have to deal with her if you dont want to.And if you do want to, demand your boundaries.You know?She turned to look at him.Do you?she asked.Do you have dysfunction in your family?He laughed.My immediate family seems reasonably sane.Or maybe were just used to each other.We lived on a shoestring.Paycheck to paycheck.We got by.It turned my mom into a really good money manager.But in the extended family we have some real interesting characters.My dads dad was married five times.If you knew him, youd find that hard to believetheres nothing all that special about him.My dad has twelve siblings, none of them full siblings, all halfs and steps.Some of them are real losersmoney issues, chronically unemployed.Ones a scam manwe give him a wide berth.Theyre always looking for handoutsmakes my dad crazy.One of my mothers aunts is a hoarder and the other one keeps cats.Like twenty or thirty cats.We visited them both exactly once.I think there are some serious mental health issues at work there.Theres one of those funny uncles somewhere in the family treehe was not allowed to visit.Im told my maternal grandfather smacked around my grandmothermy mother said it could get pretty nightmarish when she was a kid.She said if my dad ever raised a hand to her shed just shoot him.I take it he never did.My dad is kind of a big, handsome, sweetheart of a guyI guess he inherited the side of my grandfather women fell in love with, but hes managed to be married only once.My mom, though, was married for a very short time when she was real young.Married for a year or something.She divorced her first husband.She never liked to talk about it.I dont think I even knew until my sister, Jess, got married at nineteen and my mother lost her mind, terrified that Jess was headed down the same path.Jess is fine.My mom didnt marry my dad until she was thirty.But you had a normal childhood, she said.Well, I guess.I dont appear to be scarred.I dont have any medals, either.And Ive never been to Russia or China.It wasnt what you think.It was work.I know.Id love to see your passports sometime.Youre going to think about this for a while and youre going to realize you can deal with her now.She didnt love you enough and she was selfish.She neglected you in ways that still hurt, but youre whole and strong.Youre all right.You wont be like that.Because of that experience, youll be a completely different kind of mother.You sure about that?Im confident.But I want to suggest one thing.Itll be hard because right now youre bruised.I suggest you think about all the things you had.Youve been putting a lot of focus on what you didnt have.
