Well, if you see him, tell him to get his ass into Dallas, first thing.Absolutely, she said, scanning her emails.If she had any intention of seeing him, shed tell him.Around lunch she headed toward the big house, looking for a sandwich.She found Eli on the porch, sweating and drinking sweet tea.He was staring off down the driveway, toward the gravel road that led to Springfield.Eli was a staring off into the distance kind of guy, and she didnt think anything of it until she stepped onto the verandah and he gestured with his glass over Taras shoulder.You talked to him?Luc?she asked.Now that Lyle was gone, there could only be one him.Eli nodded and Tara turned to see Luc, in shorts and a T shirt, his head bowed on his neck like a boxer stepping into the ring, running through the midday June heat.Deep in her body, as if kindling had been set, ready for a match, a fire ignited.The gray shirt he wore was nearly black across his shoulders and down his spine.His legsgood lord, the man had nice legs.Whatwhats he doing?she asked, trying not to sound slightly out of breath.Running.Every day.Twice a day.You talked to him?She treaded lightly, sensing a whole lot of pissed off beneath his ninja calm.Cant get him to slow down long enough to say three words.She thought about that call from Randy.And how Eli had been screwed in the will, how he was probably dying to turn this place on its ass and couldnt do it without Luc signing those papers.I am not getting near that man today, she told herself.Not if I can help it.You got anything sweet?she asked, watching Lucs body get smaller and smaller as he chased dust and sunlight across his own dry, flat land.Candy?Gum?Cough drop.He held out a Halls in a crumpled white wrapper.Gross.But she took it anyway.Tuesday morning, Luc was all over the radio on her drive to the ranch.Apparently, Melanie in the Morning had a GIANT crush on the hockey star and she was all aflutter with the idea that Luc Baker might actually get traded to the Dallas Mavericks, which Tara could only assume was a hockey team.Melanie in the Morning further theorized that being in Texas for his fathers funeral was probably just a coverthat Luc was really here to talk to management and work out with the team.Melanie probably didnt realize how stupid she sounded.She never seemed to.Tara Jean flipped the radio off in disgust.But a day that started bad only got worse when she got to the ranch.What do you mean, youre pregnant?she asked Jennifer Hodges, who, when she wasnt knocked up, was Taras small sized sample model.The final measurement for the samples was scheduled for two weeks away, the beginning of July, the second to last step before Tara Jean hand delivered them to the factory where they were cut and sewn in bulk.Most of the fashion world used factories in Taiwan and Bangladesh to keep costs down, but Lyle had liked to brag that they made clothes for Americans, by Americans.Using the hides of American cows.Cost him a freaking bundle, but it was something to be proud of.But the final measurements were going to be a problem since Jennifer hadnt kept her legs together.Im sorry, Jennifer said.Im seventeen weeks and Ive already gained ten pounds and my boobs are huge Great, fine.Tara pinched the bridge of her nose and eyed all that sweet, sweet candy that was still in the garbage can.Dont worry, Jennifer, andcongratulations.Christ.What was with all the breeding going on around here?Now she needed a small model.For next week.Shed give it a shot herself, but her C cups hadnt fit into a small since she was in seventh grade.Today, when she went in for lunch it was Ruby standing on the porch, watching Luc run down the driveway through the shadows from the tall poplars.I cant say I like the man, Ruby whispered, as if Luc might hear her from a hundred yards away, but I love watching him run away.You dirty bird, Tara laughed, and Ruby smiled.Im old, not dead.Here.She handed Tara the mail.Tara flipped through it, and opened up the envelopes from Jones Tannery and All American Shipping.Both overdue bills.What in the world was going on here?Lyle had signed those checks, hadnt he?She made sure of things like that, usually taking the books and the bills into Lyles bedroom and helping him put his shaking, indecipherable signature on the right line.Shed begged him to give her the authority to sign bigger checks before he died, but hed been so wrapped up in getting his children down here, hed pushed it off.Or maybe he never intended to do it.The betrayal bit deep.Ruby, have you cleaned out Lyles room?Not yet.The smile and gleam slowly leaked from her eyes.Today, maybe.Well, Im just gonna check and see if I left something there.Ruby nodded and since Luc had run out of sight and the show was over, she headed back into the house in front of Tara.Lyles room was quiet.Abnormally hushed and dark, like a church or a bar bathed in daylight.The pieces of medical equipment sat blank faced and unneeded, their cords curled uselessly around their necks.His sheets had been stripped.A naked pillow sat alone on his state of the art hospital bed.The table by the chair where she usually sat was still filled with the various pills and creams that made Lyle comfortable.The books she and Ruby had read to him were still splayed open, their spines bent forever to the page where theyd stopped reading, like a clock stopped just when hed died.Oddly enough, she wasnt sad.It was as if the weekend had dried her out and looking at these things, the flotsam of a mans last days, she only felt glad that shed known him.She lifted the New York Times crossword puzzle that Ruby had been doing with him and found the invoices she was looking for.Unpaid.Great.The last hope shed had that this was a mistake died.Now she was going to have to get the checks signed by Luc.Unless she could call the bank and sweet talk someone into seeing things her way.It was stupid, but she wanted to hold onto this little fantasy that the company was hers.That she didnt need anyone, much less a man, to make her plans come to fruition.Shed had enough of leaning hard on a mans strong shoulder her whole damn life; she wanted to do this on her own.Did you know my grandpa?a small voice asked and she jumped, her heart a startled bird heading for the trees.Christ, kid, she muttered, turning to face Victorias little boy, Jacob.Whod been sick.The boy clutched an inhaler in one hand, a giant robot in the other, and in this room, with its big furniture and the very adult nature of the equipment, he looked so terribly, terribly small.You were going to marry him, right?he asked, shaking a long dark curl out of his eyes.The kid had beautiful hair.Black and curly.Shiny, like the coat of Elis horse.No, she said honestly.It was just pretend.My mom and uncle call you Bimbo Barbie.She snorted before she could help it.Thatsah Its not nice.The expression on his face, that tilt to his chin and the unflinching look in his eyesit was a little pup version of one she saw on his grandfather.And his uncle.Something tight and hot clenched in her chest.Was this kid defending her?He didnt even know her.Yeah, well, its not the worst Ive heard.She looked around for Victoria.Wheres your mom?Shes signing me up for dance classes.Dance classes?I dont want to go.But shes not listening to me.He shrugged.And she knew that shrug, remembered the weight of it on her own shouldersthe tension, the way it hurt sometimes like her bones were breaking to pretend she didnt care.And she wouldnt care now.Not about his pain.She tapped the bills against the edge of the table and sighed.Well, you should probably get out of here, she said.For a second, the boys blue eyes searched hers and she could see in the kids faceplain as daythat he missed his mom.Could feel her absence even though she was close.That he was bored.And a little scared.See you around, she said, and walked away, forcing herself not to look at him any more than she had to.Tara called their account manager at the bank and tried to sweet talk him into letting her have signing rights over those damn checks, but Matthew Pierce was impervious to sweet talk.I need a letter from the power of attorney, signed by Luc Baker, he said.Thats it.You sure?she asked, trying to project as much nudity into her voice as possible.Absolutely.She hung up before she started calling him names.Because she was weak, she checked the garbage can in the greenhouse, but Ruby had already taken out the trash, and her candy supply with it.The world aint fooled by all your airs, Tara Jean, the demon said.You and me, we never get nothing in this life without asking for it, usually on our knees.She was going to have to talk to Luc.Today.The second day of her new life.Being around him, it was as if she had fresh skin, raw and sensitive.Brand new.Which was ludicrous.There was nothing brand new about Tara Jean.Shed been putting this off for too long.She checked her look in the mirror behind her desk.A black leather vest with nothing under it revealed toned arms and shoulders that truly were a gift from God, because it wasnt as if she lifted anything heavier than a Tootsie Pop.On the bottom she wore a pair of wide legged, white linen pants and red shoes that did incredible things for her ass.A small silver chain with her mothers delicate cross nestled between her breasts.An ironic statement, mostly.She imagined Lucs eyes there, on her body, the pale soft skin of her chest, and her body flushed, hot and prickly.She rearranged the girls, fluffed her hair, put on some lipstick, and, praise Jesus, found a yellow Mike and Ike in the bottom of her purse.As Lyle would say, she was ready to bring down some big game.11 Luc pitied the next person who asked him for something.He really did.Vicks was in some kind of fit, signing Jacob up for lessons and clubs and classes that the poor kid had little to no interest in.And worse, she was trying to schedule Luc for chauffeur duty.Maman had already started talking about getting his team to the annual Sick Kids Childrens Hospital Christmas Gala.Eli was hanging out on the perimeterssitting on the porch when Luc went for a run, lurking in the shadows when he got back.Please, Luc had thought more than once as he walked by the silent cowboy, ask me for something.Anything.Because then well have some words.Which, in this case, was hockey player for I will take you out.But Eli was cagey and he kept his mouth shut.Luc tugged the gloves up higher over his wrists and wrapped his fingers around the twine of the next bale of hay.He lifted, walked thirty feet, and heaved the hay into the far corner of the horse arena.He should email Dominick, the Cavaliers trainer, and let him know about the hay bale workout.Because this shit was no joke.The muscles of his shoulders, back, and arms screamed with the effort.It reminded him he needed to call Gates and tell him to lay off the strippers.He was becoming ESPNs favorite Athlete Behaving Badly.After he moved all of this hay, hed call the guys and check in.His shirt stuck to his skin, cold and clammy, and he took it off, tucking it into the back waistband of his running shorts.Once the arena was cleared of the hay bales and the bags of feed that sat by the door leading out toward the paddock and the Angus fields beyond, he was going to bring in some workout equipment.Running wasnt enough, and he was starting to lose weight.And the headaches were getting out of control.He woke up every morning feeling like there was an ice pick buried in the middle of his forehead.No wonder Matthews wanted him to rest.He would never admit this to anyone, but there were mornings when he wanted to stay in bed.Pretend, for a few hours, that he wasnt Luc Baker and that one workout might really change things.But then he thought of his team and the Stanley Cup.He thought of having a drink out of the championship cup by his fathers graveside.That would be almost as good as the speech.And he thought of spending days locked inside this ranch with his memories and somehow, every morning, hed find his way into his workout gear and out onto that road where the miles seemed longer than usual.A barn cat hissed and ran past him for the open doors leading to the short covered walkway that connected to the barn, a good fifty feet away on the other side of the building.Dust motes sparkled in the air between the dirt floor and the vaulted ceilings.Barn swallows darted down from their nests in the rafters, buzzing his head in warning.Try it, he thought to the birds, his mood so poisonous he was ready to take on wildlife.Uh oh, said a smooth, sexy voice, and his pulse leapt with sudden dark excitement.He turned to see Tara, looking like a cross between a biker babe and awell, porn star.Even in loose white pants, she looked like sex.Elis not going to like you messing with his arena.Well, Luc said, heaving another bale of hay onto the pile.Its not his arena anymore, now is it?She pursed her shiny pink lips and his core temperature spiked.Lust and anger coiled through him, a dangerous and unpredictable mixture.What are you doing?Im going to make a gym in here, he said.Bring in some workout equipment.Youre supposed to be training, arent you?Thats what all the running is about?Why, Ms.Sweet, have you been watching me, too?Her breasts pressed against her black leather vest, not straining the tiny black buttons, but giving them a good workout, and something about the barely harnessed nature of her outfit turned him on harder and faster than hed been turned on in a long time.All he wanted was to press on one of those tiny black buttons with his dirty, sweaty fingers, ease it from its hole, and give them all a little relief.Not as much as Ruby, she said, her perfect full lips kicking up into a naughty smile.Youre her new hobby.Shes given up crocheting.He wanted to lick her from the curve of that naughty smile to her toes.And back again.You know, you were all over the radio this morning.When she stepped farther into the arena, he could see the tips of her bright pink toenails in her shoes, another tease, another glimpse at the ordinary that on this woman seemed painfully, erotically extraordinary.Melanie in the Morning has been following the trade rumors very diligently.She has quite a crush on you.Id worry about a stalker if you do end up down here.Im not playing down here.Melanie will be heartbroken.Im so glad you find this funny.The bale of hay he threw flew past the pile, exploding against the wall.But this is my life.And the fact is, I need to be on some ice!She blinked at him, all empty headlight eyes.So go get on some ice.Whats the big deal?The big deal?There was a tide rising in him, lifting boats of anger and resentment, a whole fleet of frustration.Im a hockey player, one of the best, in case youve been living in a cave for the last ten years.And my doctor has told me to rest for the next few months, but right now there are thirty other men, fifteen years younger than me, all working their asses off to take my place.Ive got one year left, and I am stuckhere!He heaved the hay over his shoulder, feeling every muscle and sinew burn with the effort.I cant sneeze near an ice rink around here without every sports journalist in the world up my ass asking questions about a trade, or the Cup, or my goddamned head!Hed said too much and he forced himself to breathe.To center himself in the cool confines of his control.He turned and found her leaning against a hay bale, wiping a smudge of dirt off her white pants.She glanced up, as if she was just now noticing his silence.Her eyes opened wide, playing dumb better than any blonde hed ever seen.Or maybe she just was dumb.Yet conniving.All he really knew about her was that he wanted to get naked and sink as deep as he could into her.That sucks, she said.Perfect assessment.He marched another bale of hay across the arena.Sun flooded in the open doors, palpable heat stretching across the dirt floor.Sweat ran down his back, past the waistband of his shorts.And he could feel her eyes on him, moving across his shoulders and over his legs.His ass.His body was a product of his game, chiseled and honed by rivers of sweat and blood, and he fully appreciated that women liked how he looked.Wasnt, at times, above using what his looks brought him.The women who fell into his bed like overripe fruit.But there was something in the way this woman looked at him.Surreptitiously.While his back was turned.As if she wasnt just hiding her interest from him, but from herself as well.It was in direct contrast with her sex goddess looks, and the contradiction made him crazy.It made him want to flex his muscles, throw her over his shoulder, and show her what he could do with this body.There was not a single part of him that didnt want to touch her.But some modicum of sense in him knew it wouldnt be a good idea.He wanted to wipe the floor with his good sense.How about you?he asked.Prostitutes R Us doing a booming business?I will have you know Baker Leather cleared 1.5 million last year.And the Texas First Lady is one of our most loyal customers.Five years ago Dad told me Baker Leather was going bankrupt, he said.Thats why he needed me to wear those boots.Youre telling me thats changed in five years?Five years ago, your father didnt have me.So, youre responsible for turning it around?Lil old me, she said, somehow managing to be both sarcastic and proud.Well, now, go figure.His sarcasm was a slap shot right back at her righteous defense of herself.Her eyes narrowed.Dont be an ass.The fact that he was taking his evil mood out on her wasnt missed by either of them.Sorry.But not very.Did you have something to say, or did you just come in here to stare?Im not staring.Dont be a liar, he said, mocking her.Fine.She stood in front of the bales of hay still to be moved, a delectable, five foot three roadblock.I came in here to talk.She crossed her arms, and her breasts crowded her chest as if searching for high ground.They were natural, those breasts.Perfect and round.Theyd be soft to the touch, womanly and full.Her skin would give, her nipples would harden against his lips, firming in his mouth.His dick got harder.And he grit his teeth against the pleasure.About what?She was a magnet, and he stepped closer so that he could smell herlip gloss and sugar.Iah She swallowed, and he grinned at her.But Tara only lifted her chin, not ready to stop pretending.Fine, he thought.But if she wanted to play like there wasnt any heat between them, he didnt have to play along.Somehow the idea of getting her to admit to her desire turned him on even more.It suddenly became a goal.And he liked goals.Part of his job description.She was silent, panting slightly when he didnt move.Slowly, like a cowboy in every bad late night skin flick hed ever seen, he reached past her and picked up another bale of hay and walked through the sunlight to toss it onto the pile.She cleared her throat, and he smiled.I need you to take a ride with me.To Dallas, to see Randy Jenkins.Iron suffused his muscles and his anger.The smile turned into a smirk.Really?That it was her, asking him for something, gave him an evil delight.A sick glee.You need to sign some papers so I can do my job.Well, as you can see, Im busy.I understand moving hay is pressing business, but if you dont sign those papers, my hands are tied.And so are Elis.He stepped toward her like he was going to grab another bale of hay but stopped right in front of her instead.All those little black buttons on her vest screamed and begged to be released.Something wicked and hot brewed in the space between them, taking up oxygen, filling his head with treacherous ideas about running his hands over that tiny leather restrained waist, palming the perfect round globes of her ass.She would feel so good in his hands, against his body; those curves were meant to be touched, palmed, and kissed.Bitten.Sucked.God, he wanted her.Frankly, Im pretty sick of everyone needing something from me.Her blue eyes darkened and he knew it wasnt sympathy, not from Tara Jean.So he braced himself for her anger.Looked forward to it, even.Yeah, poor you, she spat and his body sizzled, his fingers burned.I didnt write that will, Luc.None of us did, so stop punishing us for what your father did.You know, that would be a very noble thing to do.And youre not noble.Not in the slightest.Okay, fine, what do you want?Restlessness and anger cheered.Lust sharpened itself into a knife buried in his gut.What do I want?he murmured, his eyes on her shiny pink lips.Her skin broke out in goose bumps and her shoulders went back.Her nipples were hard points against the black leather.Im not for sale.Her voice was a hot, hard whisper of anger.Not anymore.Were all for sale, Tara Jean Sweet.His eyes traveled down her body, taking breaks at her hips, her breasts, the long length of her legs.Watching that naughty little tongue of hers, he realized what he wanted from her.More than he wanted to slip that vest off her beautiful skin.More than he wanted to fill his hands with her breasts.He wanted a kiss.Her lips, perfect and pouting against his.A little tongue.Perhaps a lot of tongue.And he wanted her to admit that she might not like him, but she wanted him.That would make him feel less like taking an axe to everything on the ranch.And if you want me to sign those papers, Im going to need a kiss.He took off his gloves and tossed them on the ground, all the while watching her wrestle with her pride.The right thing to do, he was well aware, was to let this go.To tell her hed go to Dallas and sign those papers and she didnt have to do anything.But he was sick to death of doing the right thing.Choking on self sacrifice.Just a kiss.Thats it.Her hands twitched into fists, and he wondered if she knew what she revealed in that unconscious gesture.Oh, Tara Jean, what have you had to sell to get here?He nodded, hating himself a little, but far too turned on and curious to stop.Fine.She tossed back her hair, her eyes hard and flat like blue mirrors, giving away nothing, and since he wasnt totally fond of his reflection at this low moment, he looked away.But Im warning you, neither one of us is going to enjoy this.You gonna bite me?He tried not to sound excited by the idea.Because that would pretty much nullify the agreement.Im not going to bite you.But Im cold, sweetheartfrozen, all the way through.Itll be like kissing an icicle.Is that supposed to dissuade me?Nope, just making it clear that enjoyment isnt part of the deal.He laughed; he couldnt help it.I dont think enjoyment will be a problem.A bead of sweat slid out from behind her thick blond curls and traveled across the smooth skin of her neck, over the ridge of her collarbone to the inward slope of her breast, where it gained speed and vanished beneath the black leather.Cold?he murmured.I dont think so.You dont know me, she said, her voice as frozen as her body was hot.No, he didnt, but that didnt matter.Right now, all that mattered was getting his mouth on her.Her body against his.His fingers grazed her shoulder, his thumb sliding under the thick, creamy seam of the leather vest.Goose bumps rippled over her skin and her breath escaped in a long, slow sigh.You feel that?She didnt say anything, her eyes over his shoulder as though this was something she had to endure.Endure, he thought, shame creeping up alongside his lust.She wasnt something to punish.The skin, soft and damp between her arm and the leather, was the most perfect skin hed ever touched.And he might have bullied his way into this kiss, but he wasnt going to punish her.Her eyes flicked to his, big and round, blue as the sky outside the arena doors.It was, for a moment, as if he were seeing her for the first time.Her beauty punched him in the gut, left him reeling.He couldnt do this; he wasnt this man.He lifted his hand from her shoulder, stepped back.You really are beautiful Oh, for Christs sake, she muttered and leaned into him, pressing her lips to his with all the finesse of his first girlfriend in eighth grade.His finger hooked into the leather of the vest and his other hand cupped her face, the silk of her hair tangling in his fingers.The bones of her chin, the curve of her ear, were like glass under his fingers.She waited, every muscle tensed, like a bird in the palm of his hand.He pressed soft kisses against the corner of her lips, the velvet skin of her cheek.He breathed a kiss against her ear and felt her curl against herself, like ribbon on a present.Her heartbeat began to pound against his palm.But she didnt step away.He tasted the strong feminine tendons of her neck and found them delicious.She even tasted like candy.If you dont want this, step away, he breathed across her skin and heard her swallowed moan.Walk away, Tara, he said.Right now, or Or what?Her challenge was heady, the heat in her eyesall of it called to the wicked and base parts of himself.She wasnt walking away, so he kissed her.Really kissed her.Her lips, soft and pouty, were firmer than hed thought, and he carefully licked the corner seam.When she didnt jerk away, he ran his tongue along the closed crease, a beggar at her door.Her full bottom lip was too much to resist and he used his teeth, sucking it into his mouth, and she gasped and flinched against him, pressing her breasts against the bare skin of his chest.Oh, dear God, yes, he thought.Between the sweat and the leather, the hard points of her nipples and the sweet curse of that cross between her breasts, he was a goner.His hands clenched in her hair and her head tipped back, her mouth opening, and any resistance hed felt in her body was gone.So he took what was offered.His tongue slid inside the delicious wet heat of Tara Jeans mouth.She moaned, soft and deep in her throat, and her tongue pressed back and soon there was no distance between them.His erection found a home against the taut, flat belly beneath her white linen pants, and her arms curled around his neck, her nails a sweet pain against his skin.A man could die like this, he realized, sucking on Tara Jeans lips, her tongue.His hips arched hard against her and she pressed back, making him see stars.Her teeth bit into his tongue, and whatever control he might have had snapped.Rough now, his hands slid down her back, cupping the sweet curves of her hips.She was perfect, and he was momentarily distracted by the apparent absence of underwear.His arms lifted her slightly, balancing her weight like she was nothing, to set her up on one of the bales of hay.Her fingers dipped under the edge of his shorts, the T shirt hed tucked there falling down his legs to the floor.From the top of his ass, her fingers slid up his back, over the thick ridges of muscle along his spine.His teeth closed down on her tongue and her nails bit deep into his skin.Yes, he muttered, leaving her lips, finding that sweet candy skin of her neck.Her breath hitched and burned against his cheek.The siren song of the leather vest reached a crescendo and he dropped his hand between them, cupping her breast, finding the hard bead of her nipple beneath the leather.She jumped, electrocuted, and it was so real, so pure and hot, he brought his other hand down to cup her other breast, the leather slick under his fingers, her nipple a hard point.He didnt realize she was pushing him away until he heard her say, Stop.He might be an asshole, but he wasnt that kind of asshole, so he immediately stepped away.She wobbled slightly and he put an arm on her elbow, the shock of the electricity between them running from her skin to his.What the hell just happened, he wondered, staring at her down turned face as she climbed off the stack of hay.Perhaps it was all the blood in his crotch instead of his brain, but he honestly had no context for the power of that kiss.It wasnt supposed to be like that.No kiss in his life had ever been like that.Cold?he thought.An icicle?Was she insane?She tilted her face up, perfect and collected.The shock of her composure made him feel like a boy whod come in his underwear.Get cleaned up, she said in a voice a shade too rough.A shade too deep.Those lips of hers told the talethey were swollen, the pink lip gloss kissed right off, revealing the pinker shade of her lips.Well leave in a half hour.He dropped her elbow, balking at being a dog on a leash for her.Tomorrow, he said.I want to finish this.She looked at the hay and then up at him.Randy Jenkinss son plays hockey, a lot of it if Randys incessant talking about it is any indication, she said.I bet Randy could get you access to a rink without anyone knowing.He blinked at her, stunned.Watching her walk away, mesmerized by the swing of her hair and ass, he realized that of all the people in his life right now, she was the only one interested in helping him.12 Tara Jeans mom, Rayanne, loved big men.When Tara Jean was growing up, the river of men that flowed through their trailers and crappy apartments all had necks the size of Rayannes waist.Shed said once that they made her feel small and safe.Until, of course, they got mad at her.And then all that brute strength came to bear on Rayanne and spilled over onto Tara Jean.Which was why, as a rule, Tara Jean stuck to thin guys.Some of her boyfriends might have even weighed even less than she did.And she was okay with that, because the theory was that she could hold her own in a fight with a skinny guy.Of course, that proved to be just as much bullshit as the rest of her theories.But the point was, back when she was attracted to men and felt anything other than numb, she didnt like big guys.Men like Luc, with their big arms, strong chests and all those sweat slicked muscles, did nothing for her.She stood in front of the window unit in her studio, the cold air blowing right down the front of her vest, turning her nipples to ice but doing nothing to calm the fire under her skin, and wondered when that had changed.Because she liked Lucs body.She really, really liked it.The second shed walked into that arena, her body had started humming in pleasure, a motor tuned just right.And she was having a very hard time turning the damn motor off.Why hadnt she walked away when he gave her the chance?That kiss was powerful.And sweet.Better than every piece of candy shed thrown away.Through the wavy glass beside the wall unit she saw Luc step out of the house and down the porch.He wore another one of those suits, black this time, with a red tie.His hair was dark and slicked back off his high forehead, making his nose and chin sharp.Sunglasses hid his eyes and he looked menacing.Dangerous.But her body cooed with sweet delight at the memory of his tenderness at the beginning of that kissso at odds with the asshole he was trying hard to be.Hed looked into her eyes and the faade had just crumbled.Youre so beautiful, you really are.Shed been called beautiful plenty of times, but not quite like that.Like she was something new.Something hed never seen before.And his restraint, when shed told him to stop.The way hed stepped back without any hesitation, even with his erection making a mess of his shorts, had been about the most chivalrous thing shed ever seen.Which was a sad statement on the men she usually slept with.Imagine that control, the demon whispered.Imagine all that power and restraint under your hands.Beneath your lips.Imagine the places he could take you.She cranked off the air and grabbed her glasses and purse off her desk.A hundred miles to Dallas.A hundred miles.That would be a good lesson in control.She stepped out into the sunshine and jangled the keys to her Honda.Youre kidding, he drawled, his face smooth and shiny from a recent shave.Hed cut himself just above the collar of his white shirt: it was so human and real against the canvas of all that perfection.Her fingers twitched, flush with an evil desire to touch him, to dig through his clothes and ruffle his hair to find the other signs of his messy humanity.Well take my car, he said.She shrugged, relieved.Her tank was barely half full and she didnt have any cash.Her salary from Baker Leather was laughable.Truly a joke.And she put almost all of it into savings.A contingency plan, or an escape route, depending on if her past came back to haunt her or, in the end, she wasnt as good at this job as the demon led her to believe.Getting herself up into the black SUV almost required a pulley system and a harness, but she climbed in and Luc started the mighty engine, which purred against her feet and reverberated through her body, hitting extra notes low in her belly.He backed out of the parking area, his hand braced on her seat.So close.Too close.She tried not to stare at the fine hair on his hands, the size of his palms.Tried not to remember the way hed lifted her as though she weighed nothing.The skinny boyfriends couldnt ever do that.Needing a distraction, she pulled a pack of strawberry gum out of her bag and held out a piece to him.He took it without comment, sliding it into his mouth, and then he grimaced, spitting it back on the wrapper and wadding it up.She chewed on her own and grinned.You dont like it?Tastes like strawberry plastic.My favorite kind.All I ever see you eat is candy.You a dentist?His laugh was a little huff out of his nose and then he was quiet, tucking the gum and wrapper into the ashtray.She looked out the window at the bluebells in bloom, a sea of them on the low hills, nodding their heads in the wind as if in approval.As if to say, its okay.Dont worry.Everything will be all right.Whyd you change your name?Do I look like the Jane type?His eyes ran over her and her body responded with a deep purr.Frankly, Tara, he said, looking her right in the eye for a moment, sounding baffled, I dont know what type you are.Whyd you change your name?she shot back, and his eyebrow lifted.I never much cared for the name Wayne.His voice was as dry as the desert.I never much cared for the name Jane.It wasnt the truth, of course.But she didnt need to tell him that she was running from her past.The past hed threatened to expose.He glanced over at her and she braced herself for a stripper comment, but in the end he just nodded.Fair enough.Howd you meet my dad?He shifted his hands around on the wheel, pretending to be nonchalant, and she wondered what was agitating him.Talking about his father?Or talking about his father with her?Your private investigator already told you, remember?The hospital.He didnt tell me why you were there.I was a candy stripper.His laugh surprised both of them.I didnt expect you to be funny.Its one of my lesser charms.She pretended to puff up her hair, and his half grin sliced right through her stomach.Tara, you were right the other day.I saw that picture of you and I heard your name and I had you pegged.And now that Im here Stuck here.Right.Stuck here.I realize I dont have you pegged at all.I keep thinking I have you figured out and then you do something to change everything andIve misjudged you a thousand times and I dont want to do it anymore.A pinprick of panic punctured her heart.Despite her efforts he was seeing through the Bimbo Barbie act, and she didnt know, couldnt even begin to guess, what he saw beneath the show.And you dont have to answer my questions.We can just sit here for an hour I had been in a car accident.A bad one?His glance was concerned and she was touched, truly, but she was lying to him and his concern made her queasy.Bad enough.Lyle and I were on the same floor.I used to go into his room and read to him.Read?To Lyle?The Sports page, she said, wondering why she was telling him this; blurring the lines between fiction and reality was a surefire way to get caught up in some lie.Some half truth.And this man was too perceptive already.He had a son, you know, a big shot hockey player.That shut him up, and in the silence she plucked an emery board from the front pocket of her bag and went to work on her right thumbnail.Is that something you do a lot?Read to old guys in hospitals?She had to give him points for trying so hard not to sound disbelieving.I did.She took care of the ragged edge on her pinky.Hospitals and nursing homes.Only the rich men?He was trying to joke, but it was far too close to the truth to be funny.The good looking ones.She winked at him, but he was wound tight and he sat there emanating the kind of pained stress that spoke right to her heart.She lived with that stress, stretched taut between wishing she felt nothing and feeling all too much.Only the lonely ones, she revealed, because in the end that was the truth.The ones who had no visitors.No family.No one to read the Sports page to them.They were grateful to have someone do something nice for them.Very grateful.She pressed the rough edge of the emery board hard against her cuticle until blood welled up.Paymentlate, and not nearly enoughfor all that gratitude.It was like giving them back a little piece of themselves.A cup of tea in their favorite mug.Warm socks.A blanket their wife made.Their favorite book, outside with the sun shining on their faces.But mostly they wanted someone to read them the crossword puzzle and the obituaries.One man, she laughed suddenly at the memory that sprang out of nowhere, Mr.Beanfang, he liked me to read the newspaper to him while he was in the bathroom.I used to shout it through the closed door.She didnt have to look at him to see his shockshe could feel it, cold and hard against her face, which burned with embarrassment.What was the point of telling him that, Tara?she wondered.But when the silence stretched on she glanced up at him, saw him staring at the road.The bluebells were gone, replaced by hardscrabble sage and dirt.And Dad just took a liking to how you read the Sports page?Offered to bring you to his home so you could do it full time?She gaped at him slightly, realizing he was angry with his father on her behalf.Amazing!That was a first for her and she didnt quite know how to respond.There was nothing sordid about it, Luc.He was lonely.And dying.He was worried about what would happen to Baker Leather once he was gone.I didnt have any other job prospects, so when he offered me a chance to come out and learn the business, I took it.You have a lot of experience designing leather skirts?I told him I did.He shot her a wicked look and she rolled her eyes.Honestly, he was years too late with the sarcasm.He knew I was lying.Believe what you want, he was kind to me.Kind.Luc shook his head as if the word didnt make any sense.She waited for some other vicious comment or look from him, ready to defend Lyle against his sons hate, but he stared out the window as if the scrub brush were a threat that needed to be watched.From the bag at her feet, she pulled out a tissue and pressed it to the bead of blood on her pinky, the red seeping across the white like a poison.She watched and wondered if she was the poison or the thing being poisoned, which was a ridiculous thing to wonder, so she crumpled up the tissue and threw it into her bag.Hey Luc, she said.Ifif you have questions about me, just ask.No need for private investigators.She stared at him, as earnest and naked as shed been in years.She already had Dennis to worry about.She didnt want to worry about some P. I.  digging through her secrets and carrying them back to Luc.I dont intend to have him do any more digging.Thank you.The silence stretched, cracks formed, the past lurked, and Tara had no desire to slip into those horrible places.So, Luc, what do you do besides hockey?Youre joking.No, surely youve got some kind of charity.Isnt that what you rich people do?Give your money away so you dont feel so guilty?He laughed a little as if they were sharing some inside joke.The sun came out from behind a cloud and he put his shades back on, and she felt as if he were hiding.My mother takes care of my karma.Okay.But you have to have a hobby.You breed dogs?Knit?Play bridge?Does trying to keep my star center out of jail count?No.Well, maybe.Is he often in jail?Often enough.All right, thats half a hobby.What else?Thats it, Tara.I play hockey, work out, and try to keep Gates out of jail.And I thought my life was boring.She laughed, she couldnt help it; honestly, what a clich.Why is that funny?he asked, the smile gone.I love what I do.I dont want to think about anything else.I dont need anything else.The ferocity surprised her; the hair on her arms stood on end in a sudden prickly awareness.She should let it go, like a scab that wasnt quite ready to come off.But she couldnt help herself.No wife?No little Lucs carrying hockey sticks and wearing miniature suits?No wife, he said.No family.Friends?I have my team, Tara.Theyre all I need.Fair enough, she said, slightly chagrined by his honesty.And at the same time a little sad for him.If hed been a footnote in his fathers life, he was doing the same to everything in his own life that didnt involve being on the ice.What about you?he asked.No wife for me either, she said, backing up and away from the thin intimacy theyd built, the fragile bridge between them.Where are your friends?He just died.The easiness between them scattered like crows after a gunshot.His mouth shut so hard she heard his back teeth click, and she wished shed never started this conversation.Wished shed never gotten in this car.They should have driven separately.Or, better yet, Luc should have acted like a reasonable adult rather than a jerk and just taken care of his inheritance when he was supposed to.The private investigator told me you grew up in Arkansas.She twisted her body toward the window, giving him every signal to shut the hell up.Where?Does it matter?He glanced at her.Her distorted body reflected back at her in his slick sunglasses.Im not passing judgment.A trailer.She stared out her window.In the middle of nowhere.Her cell phone beeped and she fumbled in her bag for it.Another email from her Nigerian prince, but Luc didnt need to know that.Excuse me, but I need to do a little work.Tara Jean, he said after a long moment.If youre angry about what happened in the arena I dont care about what happened in the arena.She didnt bother looking up from her cell phone.She could feel his gaze on her, as if it were his large, hot hands.And she wanted to scream because she was smarter than this.Savvy to the wayward temptation of a handsome mans grin.What she was a sucker for, though, was his quiet and startling interest in her.If kissing him was a mistake, then liking him was a disaster.The rest of the drive passed without a word between them until Luc asked for directions to the lawyers office.Once Tara had hand delivered Luc to a very pleased Randy Jenkins, she headed out into Uptown and got herself an iced coffee and, because that drive was harder than shed thought it would be, a donut.With sprinkles.Because sometimes a girl needed her crutch.She sat on a bench off McKinley, outside the lawyers office, and watched the world stroll by.Well, well, well, a voice purred over her shoulder.Her heart collapsed in her chest and she choked on her breath, drowning in panic.Run!the Demon screamed.Desperate, her eyes searched the faces of the men walking past, praying one of them would see the danger she was in.If it isnt sweet Jane Simmonsoh, wait, thats not you anymore, is it?It took me a while to track you down, Tara Jean.I have to say, I dont much like the new name.Makes you sound like a stripper.How the hell did you find me here?Her voice cracked to pieces in panic.Ive been watching that ranch for about a week.You dont leave the place, except to go home.And your apartment has got all those locks, Jane, honestly.Someone would think you were scared of something.His smile showed every tooth.This is the first chance Ive had to catch you alone.He sat beside her, a thin man, handsome to her once, terribly handsome, with his aging high school football star looks.Brown hair with a hint of gold, bright white teeth, a dimpled smile.Those eyelashes that stretched for miles.It was all a faade hiding ugliness so profound it had destroyed her life.The donut shed eaten began to crawl up her throat.Get up!The Demon screamed.Get up right now!Every muscle tensed to stand.Hey now, honey.Dennis put a hand over hers and she yanked it free, repulsed by his touch.Dont touch me, she said through her teeth.Fine.He dropped the act, but slid in closer.But dont go running off.We have some things to talk about.She would have vomited on him if her body werent frozen.Youve been busy since Ive been gone.He stretched his arm across the bench, as if they were just two people chatting.Luc Baker, thats a hell of a mark.Luc is not a mark, she said, finding her voice and a new source of fear.Luc getting swirled into these waters was not something she wanted to consider.Ever.His sister, then?Dennis asked, and ice rolled down her spine.The stick lady, whats her name?Victoria?While Dennis had been watching her, hed been watching the whole Baker family.And of course hed assume the worst.Suddenly, she felt her strength return like a cold wind coming down from the mountains.This man was a worm and he was dangerous, but he couldnt hurt her in front of all these people.And she wasnt timid Jane Simmons anymore.She wasnt this mans doormat.Not anymore.Not ever again.Go away.Her voice was metal and steel and it rang out in the sunshine.Honestly, move on, Dennis.You and I are done.Come on, now, baby.Do you think Im just going to let you go?We made real money No.She shook her head, resolute in this of all things.Im not doing that anymore.Right, he drawled, clearly not believing her.Fine.But you owe me some money.From that last geezer.There is no money, Dennis.I gave it back.She smiled slightly, pleased to have thwarted him, to have taken something he wanted and tossed it away where he could never get it.Now, Jane.His fingers reached for her cheek and she jerked from his touch.Last time you told me that line, you got hurt.You beat the shit out of me, Dennis, she snapped.Put me in the hospital.Id say were even.Even?That was ten grand Look at me, Dennis, Im not doing that anymore.Its over.Theres no money.She forced herself to meet his gaze and not back down.You dont scare me, she thought, not anymore.He couldnt hurt her on this crowded street, not really, and she wasnt about to let him back into her life.It was as if her own strength had sealed up the cracks where hed always found entrance.He was so little, sitting there in his second hand clothes.Youve gone clean.He nodded his head, as if he was in total approval, but she knew better.Hed taught her better.Thats admirable.Stay away from me, Dennis, she said.Ive got a new life.He lurched toward her, his hands clenching her wrist so hard the bones rubbed, and she gasped at the sudden pain.You got shit, Jane.A woman like you wants to believe you can do better.But you cant.Youre good for one thing, and its best when its dirty.She didnt realize she was on her feet, blinking in shock, until he switched his grip on her hand, as if they were shaking hands.No one watching would think it was a manacle holding her to the past, keeping her in the filth.Tara Jean?She stiffened in panic.Luc.It was Luc behind her.Dennis stood, smiling like a salesman, and she wondered if Luc saw that or if he only saw the charm.So many people only saw the charm until it was too late.But Luc was frowning down at Dennis from his professional athlete height.Worry in his eyes.She didnt need Luc curious, or worried, or involved in her situation with Dennis in any way.So she put on a big, bright happy smile.Luc, this is an old friend of mine.Dennis.Dennis Murphy.Luc Baker, Dennis said, holding out his hand.Im a huge fan.Lucs giant paw swallowed the smaller mans hand and Luc glanced over to Tara.She smiled, hopingpraying actuallythat it was convincing.Nice to meet you, he said, and Tara took a deep breath.Well, Dennis, it was good to catch up, she said.Best of luck to you.He opened his mouth as if to say something, turn some screw, slide some blade between her ribs, but she pulled Luc close, putting her arm through his, insinuating that this big, giant professional athlete at her side would squash Dennis like a bug if she wanted.If she just said the word.Dennis closed his mouth.Giddy and light headed, she leaned on Lucs arm as they walked back to the car, feeling as if shed just fought the devil.And won.13 Tara was good, Luc would grant her that.She was calm and cool sitting in the passenger seat of the SUV.She didnt fidget, she didnt seem in anyway disturbed.But she was one unsettled woman.Maybe it was the total stillness of her, the way she didnt play with her hair or cross her legs over and over again, the way she had on the drive to Dallas.A girly, strawberry scented tornado in the front seat determined to distract him from the road.Now, she just stared out the front window, her face blank.Eerily blank.Who was that guy?Luc asked.Dennis?Her smile was a work of art, nostalgic as if the name were attached to fond memories.But he didnt believe her.Not for a moment.He nodded, watching her and the road in equal measure.An old friend from before I started working for your father.Whats he do?A little bit of everything.She waved her hand, like it was all nothing.Real estate, investments; hes a jack of all trades.Did you date?Now she looked at him, her blue eyes carefully blank.Does it matter?I guess not, you just seem He shrugged.Ruffled.Beneath the lushness, her laugh was decidedly tinny.Seeing him brought back a lot of old memories, thats all.She ran a hand through her hair, pushing it away from her face, and then squared her shoulders as if shed just shed some skin.What did Jenkins have to say?Did he help you with ice time?It was a blatant change of subject and part of him resisted, wanting to pull the truth out of her like a bad tooth, but he realized it was pointless.He was leaving in five months, and maybewell, after what hed heard in the lawyers office, maybe shed be leaving sooner.He was glad to help.He knows the manager of the rink where his son plays.Says shell help and be discreet.She smiled at him like a cat with a mouth full of cream, like a woman who owned the ground she stood on.And he couldnt help but stare at her.Couldnt help but want her.Thank you, Tara.Youre welcome.Youre not getting much of a salary.Immediately the smile dropped from her face.You talked about me?Baker Leather, mostly.Youre earning the same amount Lyle paid you four years ago.And forty thousand a year aint much.Well, the company pays for my apartment and utilities.She shook her head.Why does any of this matter?Because I cant sell the land for a year while its in escrow, but I can liquidate the assets of the estate.And Baker Leather is an asset.Why would you do that?For the first time he saw real panic in her face and it caught him flat footed.He could only stare.You said you didnt care enough about the business to ruin it out of spite.Ah, the million dollar question.Why was he doing this?She was like a hedgehogrub her one way and you were fine, rub her the other and you got nothing but spikes stuck in your hand.He thought about how shed bristled and shut down when hed asked her where she was from.She had a lot of secrets beneath those spikes.As forty percent owner of the company, you could walk away with a big chunk of money if we liquidate, he told her.Her big blue eyes stared at him, unblinking.As though if she looked away for even a moment, he might yank the rug right out from beneath her.You could start over somewhere new.Put this place behind you.Her laughter was surprising, tired and sore, as if it had walked a long road to see the light of day.Ive started fresh more times than I care to count, Luc.Her beauty was suddenly threadbare, but what he saw beneath the glamour was infinitely more appealing.It was tough.And honest.I have no interest in putting this place behind me.But I understand you hate your father and Im sure you have plenty of good reason, but he gave me the chance for a new life.And I want that life.He looked out across the highway, the black asphalt splitting the dirt and sage.Heat waves rose up off the road, the sun brutal and unforgiving.Not much lived out here, nothing that was pretty or fragile or easy, anyway.But it was her life.Her choice.He truly didnt care enough to try to influence her one way or another.All right then, he said.We wont liquidate.Why are you doing this?Offering to liquidate for my benefit?Because I wont sleep with you out of gratitude.Or to keep you from changing your mind.Youve got a really dirty mind, Tara Jean.Youre saying it never occurred to you to use this to leverage me into your bed.He laughed, stroking his chin, wishing with a palpable force that he could stroke her just as easily.But her spines were up.Ive thought about you in my bed almost every minute since I met you, he said.And should you be so lucky as to sleep with me Lucky?She scoffed and he turned to her, smiling slightly just to watch her bristle even more.She was a gorgeous hedgehog, that was for sure.And fun to tease.Very.And there wouldnt be any ulterior motives.Youre a fool, Luc Baker.She turned away, staring out the window at the desolate landscape she apparently wanted to call home.Yeah.Youre probably right.Jacob hated the ballet classes Victoria had signed him up for.But the sight of him in his black sweatpants and white T shirt standing at the barre surrounded by girls in pink tutus so delighted Victoria, she had refused to switch him out of it.Excuse me, a man whispered, and the sealed envelope from Webster and McGraw Law Offices in New York floated under her nose.You dropped this.Victoria stared at the letter from the lawyers handling the civil case against her husbands company.It had arrived this morning and shed tucked it in her purse and ignored it.Because she knew without opening it what it said.We have not yet received your monthly expense report and your receipts.The ongoing aspect of her humiliation was having to submit a spending report to the prosecutors, who held her accountable for every penny.Nobody cared that shed had no idea what her husband was doing.Nobody believed her when shed said there was no more money.Shed sold the houses and the furniture and given all the money to the prosecutors to distribute to the people who were bankrupted by Joels Ponzi scheme.She was playing fair.Nice, even.Complying above and beyond.But, still, every month she had to be held accountable.Her purchases scrutinized, down to the last tampon.Reluctantly, she took the envelope, sparing a smile for the man standing next to her.And then did a subtle double take.No problem, he said.No, she thought, no problem at all.Standing beside her was one of the most handsome men shed seen in a long time.And he was smiling.At her.Brown hair, pretty blue eyes, and eyelashes that went on forever.And his smilehis smile was kind.His smile made her smile, and that was pretty damn rare in her life.She felt something tight and closed off and nearly dead in her soul opening up, reaching out.Do you mind if I he gestured to the seat next to her.Sure, she said, tucking her bag under her seat.Is your daughter taking ballet?Niece, he said, pushing the sides of his handsome gray suit jacket away from his hips as he sat.Armani.Nice.His brown shoes were Cole Haan and his watch was Tag Heuer.She summed him up in an instant and felt selfish and miserly, but her heart went pitter patter at the sight of all that wealth.
