All I ask is that you make an American heiress out of me.As my 						dearly departed husband used to say, if one wishes to control society, one 						merely has to locate its pulse, place a finger on it and then press hard.What wed be doin is forgin a campaign, of sorts, that would allow me to 						become respectable in the eyes of society whilst allowin Tremayne and I to 						marry without mass opposition.He snorted.Not to offend, Mrs.Miltonbut the moment you show up in all your American glory covered in 						rouge and holding a brandy, the game isover.Mass opposition is 						inevitable.She held up a finger and stepped 						toward him, intently holding his gaze.Ah.But what if I dont show up as 						Mrs.Milton covered in rouge and holdin a brandy?What if I show up as 						someone else?Someone draped in vast wealth, refinement and a lace parasol 						in hand?I still dont quite follow and 						I dont think its the brandy.Raymond used to say that 						governments all over the world are notorious for creatin and perpetuatin 						factual farces.And thats exactly what wed do.Wed be creatin 						a factual farce to appease society in the way a politician does.She paused 						and eyed him.Do you know what a factual farce is?He blinked, leaned over and set 						aside his own glass onto the side table.Tispropaganda.Yes?She clasped her hands together.Exactly.Upper levels of government use propaganda to bend the public to 						its will by slippin whatever farce they want the world to believe into 						every crack of society until it fills every tongue and mind and becomes fact 						due to its source.What well be doin, Your Grace, is fillin in 						my cracks 						and slippin me into your circle.That is the political game well play 						and that is 						the political game that will win.Are you in?Or do you need to be more 						sober to agree to any of this?The duke lowered his chin.Bloody on high.Am I even hearing this?That you are.You have the 						money and I have the will.Well pay people to mold me into the sort of 						woman London would accept, and introduce me as such to society.The duke set his jaw and rounded 						her, his gait uneven but determined.Scanning the length of her appearance, 						he drawled, It takes a lot to impress London.He scanned her again.A lot.She rolled her eyes.Im not 						lookin to be canonized here.Im as tough as any blade and am fully aware 						of what is and isnt possible.The real question is, what do you think would 						be easier for London to swallow?A Five Points widow your son met on the 						street here in New York?Or an American heiress he met in the drawin rooms 						of London and wishes to court and marry?The duke swiped his face and 						glanced toward her, his brows coming together.An American heiress, no 						doubt.Exactly.So make me 						one.He stared.But you would be 						turning away from all that you are.He doesnt want that for you.He made 						that very clear.A small smile touched her lips.Sometimes men dont really understand what women want.Sometimes a woman 						has to tell a man what she wants before he mucks everythin up.Im not 						about to tear your son away from you, nor am I about to turn away from him 						merely because a bunch of snobs think me incapable of bein a lady.The only 						solution is to eliminate the divide without the world knowin.And only you 						and your money can do that.Me and my money.Huh.Setting 						his hands behind his back, he lowered his gaze and slowly paced back and 						forth, back and forth.He paused.This idea of yours intrigues me.It would 						depend onthe people we involve.It would also have to be incredibly well 						done.You and Yardley would have to conduct a public courtship before London 						for any of it to be mildly believable.The Season is over for the year, but 						will be opening again inearly April, I believe.He winced.That would 						barely give us ten months to orchestrate this.It wouldnt be enough time.We would have to give ourselves the following year of 32.Her pulse fluttered like a 						butterfly caught in a capped jar.Im not willin to be apart from him that 						long.Im just not.Well have to make all of this come together in the ten 						months you speak of.Mrs.Milton, I like you, but I 						dont think  If you and he were to go back 						to London in ten days time as planned, and leave me here with a sizable 						fund to oversee the creation of my identity, I know it could be done.Whilst I 						build my name here, you could assist by building my name in London.What do 						you think?Tis a bitambitious.Rumors 						can easily be seeded within the upper circles in as little as a few months.But you He gargled out a laugh.Not to offend, but you are not even a 						sliver of what my circle would consider to be acceptable.Ten months would 						barely cover etiquette, let alone the rest of you.She glared at him.Im from the 						Five Points, Your Grace, and we Five Pointers know how to outplay anyone.I 						have full faith it can and will be done.I can do this in ten months time.Just give me a chance and I promise that everyone is not only goin to sit 						down for the show but they wont even question what the hell theyre seein.But I cant do it without you.Im goin to need money.Lots of it.Because 						as with any campaign, Ill have to wine and dine my way into every level of 						society here in New York by feedin them the same farce London will be 						feastin on.He swiped at his mouth.But 						that would only leave usten days tolaunch this.Tremayne and I leave for 						London in ten days.Ten days is doable if we make 						it count.Youve been here for seven months, Your Grace.Im certain youve 						met plenty of men in the upper circles here on Broadway.Havent you?All we 						need to do is to find one of those upper crust New Yorkers with a powerful 						reputation whod be willin to play our game and play it well.Someone whod 						benefit from what were tryin to do, either financially or through other 						means.He let out a whistle.No wonder 						Yardleys so smitten.You bloody have a mind to match.Rounding her, the 						duke grabbed the decanter, refilling his almost empty glass.Slowly setting 						the decanter aside, he paused and turned back toward her.Mr.Astor.He would 						play along.Georgia lifted a brow.And who 						is that?How well do you know him?Well enough to entrust him with our 						scheme?He leaned against the sideboard, 						causing it to hit the wall.I would venture to say yes.His connections are 						astounding.From street to heaven.And he is quite the eccentric.He 						snorted.Good.I want to do this.Can 						we?Consider it done.The duke 						smiled, reached out and patted her cheek affectionately as if she were 						already his daughter in law.I will call on Mr.Astor in the morning when 						Im not sobashed out of my senses.The room is still spinning.Just a bit, 						but its spinning.Georgia flung herself against 						him, wrapping her arms around his waist and squeezing him tightly against 						herself.How I pray youll feel the same come morning.Oh, how I pray.Will 						you even remember our conversation?Of course I will.He awkwardly 						patted her back and kept on patting her as if silently pleading that their 						embrace end.And if I dontall you need to do is tell me that Augustine 						would spit upon my soul from the heavens if I didnt do this for our 						son.She eased back and smiled.Augustine was your wife?She was my soul.The dukes 						features twisted as he adjusted the sleeves of his coat and cleared his 						throat.Good night, my dear.Wandering over to the door, he pulled it 						open, and staggered out, slamming it behind himself.A big rush of air escaped 						Georgias lips, leaving her standing there dazed and in disbelief.She was 						going to be a lady.A real one.That is if the duke could be trusted not to go 						back on his word.He was about as soused as any man could get.Gathering her robe from around 						her feet, she slowly made her way back toward the large four poster bed and 						fell into its divine softness.She let out a shaky breath, rolling herself 						regally onto her back.Robinson loved her.He loved her and it was time to 						love him back in the way he not only deserved but would never 					expect.Spreading her arms and legs as 						far and wide as she could, she slid them up and down across the smoothness 						of beautifully clean and perfect powder blue linens.Nothing was going to 						come between her and her man.Nothing.Et tu, Brute?William Shakespeare, Julius Caesar (as 						published in 1811) AN HOUR LATER, A KNOCK ON the door startled Georgia into scrambling out of 						the bed shed been lounging in whilst examining all the labels of her 						makeup.Hurrying over to the door, Georgia paused only long enough to quell 						the fluttering in her stomach.She unbolted the door and edged it open.She 						paused and drew in an astonished breath.Robinson lingered in the 						candlelit corridor outside, a dove gray top hat in his black leather gloved 						hands.His thick black hair had been brushed back with tonic and that square 						jaw was shaven and soft looking.A snowy silk cravat bound his throat, that 						well muscled frame beautifully held together by an expensive embroidered 						waistcoat, well cut morning coat, fine trousers and polished black leather 						boots.He was even wearing another 						mourning band.It was as if he had formally returned to being the man she 						first met, and her Robinson, as she knew him, was no more.She swallowed.It was as if he 						had remembered all that had once been.Good evening to you, Georgia.His husky voice was endearingly soft as he heatedly met her gaze.I missed 						you.The man said it as if he hadnt 						seen her in years.Fingering the rim of his top 						hat, his gray eyes traced her hair.He searched her face.Your hair looks 						pretty.Very pretty, actually.I like it.She paused.Patting the pinned 						curls the chambermaid had earlier arranged for her after her bath, she shyly 						lowered her gaze.He had never once commented on or noticed her hair before.It appeared as if he had indeed fully reverted to the man shed met on the 						street and she honestly didnt know what to make of it.Tis fancier than 						the rest of me, to be sure.I need a better gown to go with it.She shook 						out the calico skirts she had slipped into.He half nodded and fell back 						into silence, his features tightening.She sighed, sensing he was 						avoiding the conversation he had come to deliver.So where have you been 						all day?He cleared his throat and 						shifted from polished boot to boot.I, uh, I went for a very long walk from 						one end of Broadway all the way down toward where it leaves the city and 						touches field.I never realized how big this city was until I started 						walking it.I took coffee several times and ate a meal on my own.It was 						depressing as hell, but I needed time to think about our situation.And no 						matter how many times I laid out those damn cards, Georgia, they still came 						up the same.Nothing but small cards and all of them unworthy of 						you.She glanced up.She could hear 						the pain in his tone and could see the anguish in his stance and in those 						gunmetal eyes.Everythin is goin to be fine, Robinson.I 					promise.Georgia.He leaned in closer, 						bringing with him a divine scent of mulled spice and cedar.His freshly 						shaven face lingered above hers, looking boyishly charming as he sought the 						right words.His brows came together as he 						glanced down toward his top hat, whose curved rim he continued to finger.We must end this.I ask that you forgive me for submitting to this 						decision.It wasnt an easy one for me to make.I am actually hoping that 						you and I will be able to write and that I can visit you here in the States 						as often as you will allow.As friends.Because I wouldnt be able to 						entirely let you go.Even if you married.Tears overwhelmed her.He didnt 						even sound like Robinson anymore, and what was worse, this man was giving up 						on them without even fighting.You remember your life.Dont 					you?He wouldnt meet her gaze.Yes.Raising herself up onto her 						stockinged toes, she leaned toward him, closing the space between them, and 						planted a gentle, pleading kiss on his full lips.Dont give up on me quite 						yet.Fight for me, regardless of what you remember.Fight for us.We can do 						this.We can take on London.I know we can.He stiffened.She pulled away and disclosed in 						a soft tone, Im sorry I was bein stubborn earlier and wasnt willin to 						compromise, given your duty to your father and your title.You have 						responsibilities to your name and family and I understand that now.I dont 						have a family dependin on me the way you have your father dependin on you.Which is why I intend to bend.I dont want the west.I want 					you.ROBINSONS JAW TIGHTENED AS HE resisted his need to grab Georgia and demand she 						not give him any hope when there was none to be had.A hot, clenching ache 						arose deep inside his throat as she blinked up at him, bringing attention to 						those incredible emerald eyes.He tossed his hat and gloves to 						the floor and grabbed her.Ignoring the pinch of his still raw palm, he 						pulled her roughly into his chest, burying her softness against his body.He 						possessively wrapped one arm tightly around her slim shoulders and pressed 						his other hand against her smooth cheek, feeling as if his chest would 						explode.She gazed up at him, those 						pretty strawberry curls swaying against the sides of her freckled 						face.His body overheated in anguished 						yearning.He kicked the door shut with his booted heel, making her stiffen 						against the resounding bang of wood hitting the frame.Her green eyes 					widened.He firmly pressed his hands to 						the sides of that silken face.Georgia, he whispered, holding her gaze.Even if I were to change my mind, you would only be molding yourself into 						something you are not.You deserve so much more.Tears traced down her cheeks.All that matters is that Im your wife.He swallowed.God, Georgia, 						dontdont do this to me.Im not about to let you destroy the last of you 						by making you kneel before others.Id have to kill everyone to ensure they 						didnt look at you as if you were somesomerag.I wouldnt be able to 						function.I can put up my own two fists, 						Robinson, she whispered.I know that, and though I love 						that about you, youve been putting them up for much too long and I Unable 						to stay away anymore, he lowered his mouth to hers.Forcing her mouth open, 						he urgently sought that hot satin tongue and buried his own tongue within 						the softness of her mouth.He ground his tense body against hers and 						devoured that mouth all the more, refusing to think about this being their 						final kiss.Blindly exploring the soft 						outline of her smooth face through their kisses, he gently trailed his 						fingers alongside its soft surface.How he wanted to forever melt into that 						skin.Slowly, he dragged his fingers 						away from her face and up into that thick, silky hair, enveloping himself 						with the beautiful sensation of touching her.As he sank deeper and deeper 						into the storming waves of a passion he knew he had never felt for 						any woman.He pressed himself harder against her, pushing her breasts and every inch of 						her body toward him with the hopes of remembering her without stripping her 						bare.Her hands pushed at his chest, 						breaking their kiss.She scrambled outside of his 						embrace.Dont be kissin me like that unless you plan on keepin 						me.He reopened his eyes.He had to 						be stronger than this.For her.Im sorry.I shouldnt have done 						that.She smoothed her hair away from 						the sides of her face.Im willin to fight for you.Im willin to become 						everythin you want and need me to be.All you need to do is say you want me 						and its done.A shaky breath escaped his lips.I wont let you crawl in my name.I love you too much.We will simply have 						to accept that you will never be anything more than my dearest Georgia from 						Orange Street.She stared at him as if she had 						just been slapped despite his proclamation of love.Narrowing her gaze, she bit out, 						You barely got your mind back and youre already feckin it all up.In case 						you didnt know, Robinson, Orange Street is just that.A street.I have two 						feet to take me to any place I want to call my own.And I plan on doin 						exactly that.You told me you needed a woman to more than love you.You told 						me you needed a woman willin to fight for you even when youre unable to 						fight for yourself.And seein youve stopped fightin, Im about to prove 						my love to you in a way you have yet to prove yours.Turning, she hurried over to the 						wardrobe and flung the doors open with a bang.Yanking all of her dresses 						off the hangers, she stuffed them into her wool sack.Shoving her feet into 						her boots, she yanked up the sack into her arms and turned toward him.Im 						headin over to Orange Street one last time and havin myself some whiskey 						with the boys.Ill be back in the mornin to settle some business with your 						father, but just so you know, thisll be goodbye until we see each other 						again next spring.Ill see you at the opening of the Season.Thats when 						you and I will make our relationship public.Heat flooded his face.What?Ill be visitin you in London, 						Lord Yardley.And Im announcin here and now that Im goin to make you crawl in a way you never 						crawled for any woman before.I hope youre ready for 					it.He glanced toward her, capturing 						her gaze.Im trying to protect you and love you in the best way I know 						how.Why wont you let me?Her features twisted as she 						rounded him, tugging her sack tighter against her chest.Because I love you 						and myself 						too much to settle for anythin less than a life together.Ill see you next 						year, Brit.And mind you, look both ways before crossin any street.I need 						you in one piece.She hurried past and headed toward the door, pulling it 						open.He turned to follow her, his 						chest tightening.Georgia, I dont want you doing this.Not for 					me.This isnt just for you.Its 						also for me.See you in April, Robinson.And dont worry.Ill make sure I 						make you look good.With that, she tugged her sack of clothes up toward 						herself and hurried out and into the corridor, disappearing from 						sight.Winded, Roderick trailed over to 						the bed she hadnt even had the chance to sleep in and sat heavily on its 						edge, staring at the floor.Dearest God.How he prayed she didnt come to 						London.How he prayed.For her sake.Not his.Nobility has its own obligations.Duc de Lvis, Maximes et rflexions (1808) Evening on a long, dark road just off Manhattan Square LADY BURTON AWAITS.Mischievous, hook nosed and beady eyed Mr.Astor grinned cheekily within the waving shadows of the carriage lanterns that barely sliced through the darkness.With a gloved hand, he reached out and enthusiastically patted Georgias cheek through her black veil, as if she were a horse he was about to race with his last dollar.You will find my friend to be most dedicated.Most.Thank you, Mr.Astor.I appreciate all that youve already done for me.Holding up a hand, Mr.Astor marched back toward the carriage and climbed into it with a dignified grunt.He disappeared inside without looking back as his footman refolded the stairs and shut the door before hurrying up onto his own seat in the back of the carriage.And so she was merrily tossed toward an imposing house whose large, narrow windows were illuminated by the glow of light.Rain drizzled down upon her veil in a mist as Georgia gathered her satin skirts from around her slippered feet.She strategically avoided puddles on the narrow stretch of pavement, heading toward the lone farmhouse that sat ominously upon a night cloaked field, surrounded by a vast, starless sky above.She hurriedly bounded up the wide, shadowed stairs leading to the main entrance and paused.Letting out a shaky breath, she glanced back at Mr.Astors unmarked carriage one last time.The driver rounded all four horses through the thick mud, the lit glass lanterns attached to his box swaying against the shadows.Picking up its pace, the carriage eventually disappeared down the long stretch of road, trudging back toward the main city that was two miles out east.Georgia scanned the glaring darkness beyond the porch she lingered on.There didnt appear to be a single house in sight and she didnt know if that was a good thing or a bad thing.She swiveled back to the door and tugged on the bellpull beside it, chiming the calling bell within.The farmhouse itself belonged to a certain Lady Burton, who had endured some sort of scandal in London that Mr.Astor and the duke had refused to go into.It appeared the path of becoming a gilded lady was to commence on a very dark night in the middle of God knows where with a woman who had done God knows what.The soft breeze of the cool summer night rolling in from the surrounding fields rustled her skirts as the entrance door was dragged open by an old man in livery.He blinked out at her, tufts of his bushy gray brows rising as he graciously gestured for her to enter with a white gloved hand.She hurried in out of the night.The moment the door closed and she was no longer in public view, she stripped her bonnet and veil, releasing the breath shed been holding.She had made it without anyone seeing her.She paused within a large foyer decorated with potted orange blossoms.An oak staircase swept up to the floor above, giving an air of simple but impressive grandeur.Sea green and white flowered wallpaper covered all of the walls in sight, lending to a soft, cozy elegance.The elderly butler took her veil and bonnet, placing them upon a side table.Setting a hand to the brass buttons on the waistcoat of his livery, as if he were a general about to march with orders, he guided her toward the right.His gloved hand eventually stretched toward a candlelit room beyond, indicating where she was to enter.Georgia hurried into the room and paused to find it empty.Where was Lady Burton?She turned back.Isnt Lady Burton?She blinked.The butler had already disappeared.Georgia awkwardly turned back to the room and lingered in the pale malachite drawing room, noting all of the paintings on the walls depicting lush, exotic landscapes of places she knew nothing of.Marble statuettes and a variety of gilded clocks scattered the mantelpiece of a most impressive marble hearth that dominated the large room.So this was where shed be locked away from the world until she was ready to be presented into New York society.It was purgatory at its finest.Wandering across the wooden inlaid floors, Georgia carefully angled past several upholstered chairs and gleaming marble topped pedestal tables, ensuring her verdant gown didnt brush up against anything it shouldnt.She glanced around, rather liking the place.Vibrant white lace curtains shrouded the night blackened windows beyond, whilst pretty etched glass lamps alongside the expanse of the walls had all been lit, giving the room a warm glow that made her feel welcome and at home.The clicking of heels echoed from down the corridor, drifting toward her through the open doors.Turning, Georgia set both hands behind her back and stared at the shadowed entryway, waiting for whatever was about to walk into her life.A voluptuous, petite woman appeared in the doorway, her embroidered powder blue evening gown rustling to a halt.Pinned sable curls streaked with silver swayed against the arresting movement, settling around sharp but pleasant features that whispered of a refined age of at least thirty.She wasnt particularly pretty but something about her was stunning.Velvet azure ribbons were intricately woven and braided into her hair, holding all of her gathered curls into place with a single visible knot that had been fashioned into a flower.The womans full lips parted, as black, hauntingly sad eyes met Georgias expectantly.Georgia curtsied, sensing the woman was waiting for her to say something.Thank you for havin me, Lady Burton.Im ever so grateful knowin that youre willin to Having, knowing and willing, Lady Burton said in a smooth British accent, drawing out each word.You must learn to pronounce your gs.Georgia blinked, sensing she had just been reprimanded.Those haunting eyes met hers again as the woman stepped forward and into the room, allowing the butler to wordlessly slide the doors closed behind her and leave them in private.The woman quietly observed her.A pleasure to meet you, Mrs.Milton.I look forward to educating you about London society and ask that you refrain from blurting words.Instead, allow them to leave your lips slowly to ensure control.Now say the following.I am ever so grateful knowing that you are here.Oh, this woman was good.Georgia wet her lips and focused.Drawing out her words in a slow and steady manner, she repeated, Im ever so gratefulknowing that youre here.That was passable but passable will not see you wed.Elongate each word.Say I am, instead of shortening who and what you are with a mere Im, and say you are instead of insulting me with youre.Now say it again and remember to pronounce your gs.Yes, my lady.Georgia drew out her words slowly, controlling every sound as best she could.Iamever so gratefulknowingthat youarehere.Lady Burton sighed, her dark brows coming together.We will focus on procuring a more natural, sophisticated tone.She paused, scanning her length.Given your ambitious plan to launch yourself into London society by April, our schedule will entail a grueling eight hours a day, allowing you rest only on Sundays, which will be spent in silent prayer.During daily hours of lecture, I hope never to hear the words I am exhausted or I cannot.Do you understand?It was like being in the military.Yes, my lady.Lovely.Now before I introduce you to your nightly routine, which you will carry to the grave, I would like to briefly test your basic understanding of protocol so I may better coordinate tomorrows lesson plan.Is that acceptable to you?By all means.Have at it.Lady Burtons brows lifted.Women do not ever have at it, my dear.Men have at it.And we most certainly do not care what men do, let alone what they think.We women will not be mentioning men at all unless it involves a lesson on how to make them better service us.Do you understand?Damn.Who had dirked this woman?Yes, my lady.Ill not mention men again.I will not mention men again.Iwill not mention men again.Very good.Now pay attention.The woman gracefully held up a small ivory card between slim fingers, as if shed been holding it all along between the folds of her gown.Presenting it at eye level, Lady Burton breezed closer, her full skirts rustling against poised, elegant movements.Do you know what this is, Mrs.Milton?Georgia blinked.Acard?Lady Burton paused before her and held the card tauntingly closer.Yes, but what sort of card?Do you know?Georgia blinked again, not understanding her point.She glanced nervously toward the card, observing its characteristics.Tis a very expensive, crisp white one?With gold embossed letterin?Georgia paused and added, And as pretty as it is, its probably also perfumed or powdered.Lady Burton pursed her lips.Still holding Georgias gaze, she daintily ripped the card in half and, with the flick of her wrists, sent both halves fluttering to the floor.It was a calling card, my dear.Until I ripped it in half in an effort to contain my disappointment in how hard you are going to make us both work.A lady never perfumes or powders her calling card.Why?Because it insinuates that she needs more than a name to carry her through respectable society.She sighed.Tis obvious we will be working ten hours a day, not eight.Georgia cringed, sensing the woman was already agitated with her.You mean a lady goes about handin out cards to everyone?What for?Handing, Lady Burton chided, rounding her and scanning her again as if she were a smashed yam on a cart.And no, a lady does not go about handing her card to just anyone.Would you flip up your skirts and place your leg into everyones hand as a means of introducing yourself?Georgia pressed her lips together and shook her head.No.Of course not.Because that would be as crass as handing out your card to everyone.So as to better explain this, Mrs.Milton, a calling card is an incredibly important extension of your identity.It announces who you are, it announces where you live and, above all, it announces whether you are worth anyones time.She lowered her chin.And as of right now, my dear, you are not even worth mine.Georgias lips parted.And she thought she had a tongue on her.Is it necessary for you to toss off to me in such a condescendin tone?The tone I am using is the same condescending tone you will hear from the lips of every waxed apple who dares call herself an aristocrat.Seeing you willfully intend to marry into my circle, I suggest you learn to not only cradle everything known as condescending, but that you kiss its little forehead until those lips of yours bleed.Satan clearly had a wife.Might I ask, why are you helpin me, aside from being Mr.Astors friend?With you bein a rich aristo and all, you certainly dont need money.Or do you?Lady Burton lifted an arched dark brow.There are some things in life, Mrs.Milton, that cannot be bought.A womans way of life is difficult as it is without society weighing in on it.And in truth, the idea of twisting an invisible blade into the gut of London society is the only reason I am doing this.Those self righteous bastards, who dare act like gods thinking their blood is pure, deserve to have their blood tainted.Georgia swallowed, wondering what happened to this woman to turn her into this.London had to be a hell and a half to be breeding women like her.Settling primly before Georgia, Lady Burton gestured casually toward her attire.Where did you get this atrocity?Georgia awkwardly brushed the sides of her satin skirts, which she actually thought pretty.I rather like this gown.Mr.Astors wife gave it to me during my stay with them and her ladys maid was kind enough to cinch it to better fit me.Lady Burton tsked.We will have to change what you like, my dear, because poor Mrs.Astor, along with half of New York, has no taste whatsoever.I could pay them all to go out and buy taste and they still would only disappoint me.She paused, glancing toward Georgias own breasts.Of course, you are terribly underweight.You need larger breasts if we are going to make you a success with men.Georgias hands jumped to cover both of her small breasts buried within her satin bodice.She glanced down at them.I didnt realize I could make them bigger.She jiggled what little she had and glanced up.How do we do that?Lady Burton daintily tapped her hand away from each breast.The secret is food, my dear.Something you clearly havent had enough of.Once you gain a far more desirable weight, only then will we invest in an extensive wardrobe.The Duke of Wentworth insisted that I build your name here in New York whilst he builds London.Therefore, once you are able to properly fill a gown, we will do our part by bringing in the most talented French seamstresses Broadway has to offer.That way, when our hired gaggle of French seamstresses are done, they will bustle off and share their succulent little tales of servicing an unknown wealthy lady just outside of New York.People in every circle will squirm to learn more about you and, in time, we will give them more.Lady Burton held up a manicured finger.Now.Whenever in the presence of others outside myself, you will always abide by the golden rule of silence.That means whenever anyone enters this home or whenever you leave this home, you are not to speak.You have yet to learn how to articulate your words like a woman of quality and we do not want the wrong sort of oui dire floating about New York, lest it take a boat and find itself in London.Do you understand?This was like a ten dollar circus she had stupidly paid for.That I do.Good.Lady Burton casually waved a hand about, a diamond ring glinting.Over these next few weeks and throughout all the many months ahead, various men and women will be wading through these doors, tutoring you in the arts of dance, the pianoforte, riding and much more.The same rule will apply to them as to our lip flapping seamstresses.You are never to speak, not even to say yes or no.You will only do as you are told.There will be no exceptions.Even if a candle should overturn and the house should catch fire, you will evacuate the premises in complete and utter silence.Gorgia gawked at her.Even durin a fire?What if people die?Lady Burton gave her a withered look.Let everyone and everything burn.Lesson onenever pity those who would merrily see you burn, in turn.These men and women servicing you are not your friends.They are but pawns we are using to win a game.But wont they suspect were up to somethin?Given that Im learnin all of these things and not sayin a word?No.Lady Burton smirked.They will all be informed to believe the following, which I myself so brilliantly scripted.Mr.Astor kindly brought you into his care after the death of your stern mother, who had locked you away in a monastery in Ireland, which shall forever remain nameless due to the heartache it always brings you upon its mention.Tragically, you were born frail.Illness has kept you in a bed all these years.It is merely by the grace of God Himself, who touched His hand to your blessed head, that you are finally well enough to learn all of the things that had been denied due to your poor health.This does not mean, however, that you will ever fully recover, as you are prone to fainting spells.Given Mr.Astors overly compassionate nature, his sole aspiration in life is to see you wed to a respectable man willing to look after your health, whilst he also tends to your impressive fortune of Mrs.Burton paused before announcing in an elegant, theatrical tone thirty thousand a year.Georgia choked.Thirty thousand a year?Isnt that a bit much?We could have easily made it more, given Mr.Astor is a millionaire in investments alone, but the duke and I decided it was best to settle on a more respectable amount that was impressive without being vulgar.Georgia slowly shook her head from side to side, realizing this was all turning into a thousand and one pawns piled onto the smallest board shed ever seen.I know this is all my idea, but its still quite a bit to lie about.It feels wrong slaughterin so many people with so many fibs.Cant we ease off on some of the drama?Lady Burton leaned in and pinched her cheek, teasingly cooing, Weep not for the aristocracy.They deserve it.Georgia huffed out an exasperated breath, already feeling overwhelmed.They hadnt even started.Do ladies of quality ever have fun?No.If you are having fun, the aristocracy considers you to be a whore.Bursting into laughter, Georgia leaned toward her.Surely, you jest!You mean women dont ever dance or play cards or drink whiskey?Lady Burton smirked.Do not make me laugh.While women dance and play cards in respectable moderation, whiskey is out of the question.As a lady of quality, you will only be allowed to drink tea, milk, hot chocolate, soda water, juice, champagne and wine.Nothing more.Georgia groaned.But I like whiskey.It doesnt matter what you like.Whiskey will never touch your lips again.Not even in the privacy of your own home.Georgias eyes widened.I would think I have every right to drink whatever I want in the privacy of my home.Its my home, after all.Ah, now, that is the American in you grouching, my dear.You Americans do love to flaunt your freedom, but remember, it always comes at the price of others.In London, ones home is the altar of a church you had best respect, for although you may think the world is not watching, all of your servants are.Oh, yes.Those naughty, naughty servants who dutifully bow to you left and right and say, Yes, my lady and No, my lady, are always looking to squeal to the rest of society.Tis the only power they have over their masters and the ton will use them to judge you and dunk your head into the Thames.What good is bein rich if you cant do anythin?In my opinion, you Brits are missin the whole point.Even God had to take a piss on Sunday.Georgia set her hands on her hips.Are all Brits this morbidly uptight?Yes.Why do you think I left?Lady Burton reached out and grabbed Georgia by the hands, forcefully removing them from her hips and yanking them down hard to her sides.You must learn poise.Lady Burton paused, her dark brows coming together as she brought Georgias hands up between them.Turning them upward and exposing her palms, she drew in an astonished breath, glancing up.What have you been doing to your hands?Georgia slid her hands out of Lady Burtons grasp.There isnt a thing I havent done with them.Lady Burtons features softened.There appeared to be a genuine charity buried within her, after all.We will make them new again.A pumice stone and a daily soak in almond milk will ensure they soften.Now.Let me look at your pretty face.Reaching up, Lady Burton grasped Georgias chin firmly, tilting her face toward her before nudging it from side to side.Tragic though it is, freckles are not at all popular.We will have to fade them by using benzoin and cover them with powder whenever you are in public.Lady Burton stepped back, tapping the tip of her finger thoughtfully against her full lips.I have decided on the name we will use.Miss Georgiana Colette Tormey.Georgiana will be easier for you to assimilate as it is but an extension of your real name, Colette gives you a dash of French class the British love and Tormey is of the Irish Gaelic that means Thunder Spirit.What do you think?Is it enough to seduce the masses?Georgia smiled.I like it.So do I.  Lady Burton eyed her.Oh, how I dread the thought of watching you pick up a fork at breakfast tomorrow morning.I have a feeling you will be cracking the same egg for hours.That said, Miss Tormey, let us go upstairs.We shall begin your regimented nightly routine.Be forewarned, it involves knotting your hair with paper curls for the rest of your life.Georgia cringed.She had knowingly condemned herself to almost a full year of this?Was any man worth all of this?She paused.Yes.Yes, Robinson certainly was.Damn him.You are not worth the 					dust which the rude wind blows in your 						face.William Shakespeare, King Lear (as published 						in 1770) 9th of April, 1831 The 						opening of the Season in LondonRotten Row BY JOSEPH, SHE FELT LIKE A horse being led by a 					horse.Georgia thought it so odd that 						the path she and her well groomed horse were on would be called Rotten by 						the aristocracy given it was their bloody row.Directing her horse at a slow 						pace alongside Lady Burton, whose gaze was primly fixed on the path leading 						through the park, Georgia tightened her gloved hands on the leather reins 						and prayed she didnt fall off the saddle.On the path before us, if I am 						to believe the color of his gloves, is the infamous Lord Seton, Lady Burton 						announced in a casual tone, tilting her chin toward her.He has a twin.The 						two wear different colored gloves to allow the public to differentiate them.Lord Seton wears white and his brother, Lord Danford, wears black.The two 						play at switching gloves all the time, but we are about to beat them at 						their own game.Do you see him?He is the only gentleman on the path before 						us and is heading our way.Georgia scanned the dirt path 						before them, noting the only man visible through a crowd of carriage riding 						mothers and their daughters just beyond Rotten Row itself.A young, 						dark haired gentleman in a black horsehair top hat, garbed in a well fitted 						riding coat and gray trousers, steadily veered toward them.His black 						leather boots gleamed in the sunlight with each trot of his black 						stallion.Georgia glanced toward Lady 						Burton.I see him.Yes.The purpose of this ride is to 						formally introduce you to London society and ensure everyone clamors to 						further know you.Lady Burton smiled and stared out before them, guiding 						her horse toward him.Follow me.From what I know, after poking about for 						good targets, Lord Seton is not only a flirt, but happens to be within the 						circle of your Yardley.Producing a flurry of male interest that will rile 						your Yardley into full cooperation is exactly what you want.So I suggest 						you make this Lord Seton notice you.And now is your chance.You want me to entertain him?Here on the road?Georgia wrinkled her nose.Wouldnt that be considered 						crass?No.Rotten Row is designed to 						showcase a womans potential.I am not asking you to flip up your skirts.I 						am asking you to smile.Do you want to marry or not?Georgia sighed and guided her 						horse to fall into a trot beside the woman.Im ready to be 						showcased.Good.Lady Burton glanced 						toward her with unusually bright and eager dark eyes.Now keep up.The 						moment he passes, hold his gaze as if he were Yardley himself and you wanted 						him naked.Then we pass and you are done.No words?No words.Respectable society 						excites very easily, my dear.Here in London, you are dealing with a very 						different breed of men.They are well trained dogs, so to speak.But dogs 						all the same.Now here he comes.Silence and poise.Georgia set her chin and kept 						her gaze trained on the young gentleman whose horse was about to pass their 						own.He casually glanced toward them, his dark eyes scanning Lady Burton 						before jumping to Georgia.His straight brows rose a small fraction as if he 						were genuinely intrigued.In the name of every Five 						Pointer who would never see the glory of this day, Georgia heatedly met his 						gaze for a very long and very sultry moment and hoped to God it was sultry 						enough.Still holding his gaze, she lavishly smiled.He slowly grinned, his shaven 						cheek dimpling rather adorably.A gloved hand came up to touch the rim of 						his hat as he passed.Georgia inclined her head, in 						turn, before altogether ignoring him and sweeping her gaze back to the dirt 						path before her.She trotted on with her horse in silence until he 						disappeared off the path.Lady Burton slowed their pace.Well done.And now the gossipmongers cometh.Remember.They can smell 						discomfort well over a mile and these two hags are no different.An open black polished barouche 						with two elderly women well adorned in oversize bonnets and daffodil yellow 						and teal patterned gowns extravagantly embroidered with lace steered out of 						their path to round them.They slowed their horses and leaned toward each 						other, exchanging quiet words whilst glancing toward her.Ah, yes.The 						gossipmongers.In unison, they set their aged 						chins and veered closer, slowing their barouche.The eldest of the two, with 						thick white sausage curls, smiled and regally called out, My dear Lady 						Burton.Was New York truly that devoid of entertainment?That sounded like an insult.Which meant it probably was.Lady Burton feigned a gracious 						smile and slowed her horse so as to better engage them.I rather adored New 						York, but my American friend, the ever charming Miss Tormey Lady Burton 						sweepingly gestured toward Georgia insisted that I join her and Mrs.Astor 						for the Season.Both of the womens eyes 						widened.They stared up at Georgia in unison, almost bringing their barouche 						to a complete halt.One of them eagerly leaned 						forward, searching Georgias face.Miss Tormey.I have heard so much about 						you.I am Lady Chartwell and this is my sister, Lady Hudson.We welcome you 						to Town.Hudson.Like the river that 						never stopped piddling.Georgia counterfeited a smile 						and tugged on the reins of her horse.Using her right boot against the side 						of the horse, she came to a halt.She focused on her words and her stance, 						knowing every breath counted.I thank you for the warm welcome and confess 						I am rather smitten with London.The gentleman are so civilized and the 						women so well dressed.You must recommend who oversees your wardrobe.Tis 						divine.The two women beamed.The one with the sausage curls 						smugly offered, The Nightingale over on Regent Street is where every lady 						ought to be outfitted whilst in London.They only hire seamstresses out of 						France and never replicate any of their patterns.She perused Georgias 						riding outfit and paused.I dont believe I have seen a riding habit so 						well put together.Was it assembled here in Town?Georgia tried not to smirk.She 						thought shed never hear rich society compliment her outfit.So lovely of you to 						notice, Lady Chartwell, but no.It was assembled on Broadway in New York.Their seamstresses are all French, too.Though I will admit, I am rather 						bored with my current wardrobe.I will have to visit this Nightingales in 						the hopes of entertaining myself.You will not be disappointed, 						the woman chimed in return.I do hope you will be able to find some time 						during the Season to call upon me and my sister over on Park Lane with Mrs.Astor.We have yet to meet her.I hear she will be acting as your chaperone?Is that true?Yes, Georgia 					offered.Noting that Lady Burton was 						bringing her horse to a trot and was silently signaling that it was time for 						them to go, Georgia did the same.It was a pleasure.I hope to see you both 						soon.Good day.Yes.Good day.The two prodded 						their barouche onward, glancing toward each other in exasperation as if they 						had just witnessed a woman sprinting naked across Rotten Row.Superficial bitches.When they were well out of 						sight, Lady Burton tossed out, You did well.Georgia sighed.Do I actually 						have to call on them now?You said you would, so yes.You 						have to.Georgia groaned.I hate 						London.This is probably where I should 						remind you that you have come to town to wed and stay in it.Oh, yes.That.Georgia bit 						back a smile.I wonder what Robinson will think of me when he sees 						me.He will most likely faint.Lady Burton paused, her dark arched brows suddenly rising.Well, well, 						well.It appears the row is more rotten than usual today.I love it.For the 						sake of your reputation, my dear, ignore these two men approaching on 						horseback.Heaven only knows who they are and what they want.Georgia darted her gaze over to 						the two who were riding on black stallions in worn black coats, worn leather 						boots and no hats.One had black disheveled shoulder length hair and the 						other had sunlit chestnut hair and a worn leather patch over 					hiseye?Her eyes widened as she 						tightened her hold on the reins.It was Matthew!Matthew andColeman?What the bloody 						hell were they doing in London?Had they followed her?Oh, this wasnt good.She 						couldnt let them see her lest they engage her in public and ruin 						everything.She quickly yanked the rim of 						her hat as far down as it would go until she couldnt even see the road 						before her and only the reins in her hands.She also yanked the long 						trailing veil of her riding habit up and over her face, burying herself in 						it.The veil never goes over your 						face, Lady Burton chided.Tis meant for decorative purposes 					only.Not today it isnt.Georgia 						lowered her voice.I know those two.Theyre from New York.And of all 						things, theyre from my part of town.Are they?Lady Burton sounded 						not only intrigued but smitten.She was quiet for a moment, then casually 						inquired, Might I ask who the man with the patch is?He looks rough enough 						to be fun.Georgia glanced over at the 						woman in complete disbelief and though she couldnt see her because of her 						drawn hat and veil, she hoped to God she could convey that any interest in 						Matthew was a very, very bad idea.Hes the last person you want to ever 						involve yourself with.Hes a thief.Lady Burton let out a laugh.All men are.Now quiet.Here they come.Georgia prayed and brought her 						horse to a full trot in the hopes of passing faster.A low whistle escaped who she 						knew to be Matthew.Apparently, Ive been living in the wrong city all my 						life, he drawled.Ladies.She cringed as their horses 						trotted past one another.Georgia even sped up her horse in an effort to 						fling off the words Matthew had just unknowingly tossed at her.Lady Burton called out for her 						to slow.Miss Tormey.Georgia hissed out a breath.Flopping back her veil, she readjusted her hat and choked out, That was 						disgusting.I felt like I was being groped by my own brother.Lady Burton aligned her horse 						beside hers and slowly grinned.Speak for yourself.I rather enjoyed 						that.Then be not coy, but use your 						time, And while ye may, go marry: For having lost but once your 						prime, you may forever tarry.Robert Herrick, Hesperides 					(1648) 15th of April, 1831 The 						Wentworth home on Park Lane SPEAKING OF GRANDEURI was rather astonished His Grace had

						notable worth.Lady Chartwell, I hear, was rather taken by her, as 						well.You mean to say that 						Miss Tormey 						is here?There was a tsk tsk tsk and the fluttering of a fan.Whatever is 						the Season coming to?We only seem to acquire crawlers these days.The 						conspirator lowered her voice.Though I will admit I have been most curious 						to glimpse her.Is she really as beautiful as some claim?There was a tittering, 						dismissive laugh.Tis but her coffers that make her breathtaking in the 						eyes of London, I assure you.Roderick felt like gouging his 						ears
