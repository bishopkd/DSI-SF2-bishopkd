Or, she could have Ross and Mamie order the flowers and she could go up a day early, visit with them and make up the flowers in their shop.Theyd be thrilled.She ran over all these possibilities with Peyton and Peyton left the final decision in her hands.And now, what can I do for you?Peyton asked.Oh.That.Grace cleared her throat.A checkup, I guess.I havent had one in a while, like too long.Oh, dont make that faceits only been a few years!Peytons black eyes grew huge.A few years?Grace leaned toward her a little.Ive had lots of physicals over the years, all with good results, but only a couple of those exams.But now it seems I need to be on the pill.Ah, Peyton said.Gotcha.Your first thirty year old virgin?Grace asked with a smirk, though she was not thirty yet.No, Peyton said, laughing.Im very happy to oblige.She glanced at her watch.Can you come down to the clinic this afternoon at around two?Thats a really slow time.Scott will be at the hospital and I can arrange with Devon to get you in right away so we dont take too much of your time.But Im going to want to do a blood panel to make sure everything is in order.Grace hadnt been exaggeratingshed had a ton of physicals.A competitive skater had to be in peak condition, couldnt risk anemia or vitamin deficiency or, God forbid, some lurking condition like a heart or kidney problem.But this was different.I can do that.Two oclock.Nine  				Although they didnt talk about it, Grace realized that she and Troy were having a standoff.She wanted to hear some words of love before she told him the whole story of her life and he wanted the story of her life before there could be words of love.She might be very vulnerable to the promise of first love, but she wasnt an idiot.She had kept her appointment with Peyton.When Grace had visited Peyton and asked her about birth control pills, she told her theyd only been using condoms for protection.Im not worried about it, she said.But Troy is getting a little nervous about depending only on that when the pill is safer.Perfectly understandable.Are your periods regular?Peyton asked.No, unfortunately.Im pretty sure Im due any day now.Seems like its been a while.Well, lets do a physical exam and blood work and then Ill give you a prescription for birth control pills.You can start taking them the first day of your period, but stick with your other protection until two weeks on the pill.Ill also give you a pregnancy test to take home just in case that cycle doesnt arriveyou can check to be sure youre not pregnant.Troy hadnt even asked her about it.She decided she was going to tell him everything about her past before his friends visited on the weekend.If there was anything about her he no longer liked, he could just sleep on his own couch while they were in town.She put the morning mail on her desk, went about her work, put together a few floral arrangements for Justin to deliver later.She went upstairs to fix a sandwich for lunch, then cleaned up the shop, made a list of flower orders for the week and visited with customers.It was late afternoon and Justin had already picked up his deliveries before she went through the mail.She leafed through the usual ads and bills, then came across a letter.Her name and address were typed on the envelope and she expected an offer of cheap insurance or something similar.But inside was one folded slip of paper.She opened it and read what was typed across the page.I dream of you every night.B.   				She stared at it, mouth open.Her hands began to shake.She looked over her shoulder left, then right.Her breath came in short gasps.She locked the back door.She wanted to go upstairs and lock her loft, but she was afraid to go outside.She grabbed her cell phone and then spoke aloud, to calm herself.Stop.Stop.Youre alone here.Hes not here.But she checked every nook and cranny, in the cooler, the office, even under the desk.She looked into the alley and saw nothing unusual.She didnt know who to call.Not her mother, who would only say I told you so.Not Mamie and Ross in Portlandwhat could they do?She finally speed dialed Mikhails cell phone.She had no idea where he might be; he could be anywhere in the world.She usually got his voice mail and was constructing the message shed leave him when he answered in Russian.Mikhail, he found me!I just got a letter.It says what he used to say, that he dreams of me every night.Its Bruno!Oh, God.Sons of bitches!he barked into the phone.Its not addressed to Izzy.Its addressed to Grace Dillon.Here at the shop.Where I live.But he is in hospital, Mikhail said.I will call them now.Then I call you.Stay where you are, he instructed as though shed leave the phone if she left the room.Thank you.I couldnt make myself call them.The first note had come when she was twelve, just a little girl, but her parents hadnt shared it with her.At twelve she was already a skater with enormous promise and a winner in her age category.Her parents screened everything that came near her, but she saw one of the notes lying on her fathers desk a year later.She got a little excited at firstsomeone loved her?Dreamed of her?But her mother said, Dont be ridiculous!Its another nutcase!We reported him to the police.She didnt think another thing about it.Then, not long after her fathers death, after an early morning practice with Mikhail, her new coach, she took off her skates in the arena where shed been skating and walked toward the exit where the chauffeured town car waited.A man she didnt know and couldnt remember ever seeing before stepped out of a dark hallway, grabbed her, put his hand over her mouth and ran down that dark hallway with her.She struggled and fought and he babbled that he was going to take care of her, rescue her from the people who were exploiting her.He held her in a maintenance closet with a broken lock on the door.She huddled in the corner, sitting on the cold floor, while he paced and babbled about foreign countries using children to spy for them, that the beautiful children should be freed, on and on with nonsense that had no meaning.He hadnt been armed that she could see, but he was a large man.His hair was thinning on top but long on the sides and back; she found out later that he was twenty four.She tried to get up and run for the door of that small space but he smacked her right down and threatened her, told her hed have to hurt her to protect her if she didnt follow his rules.It took a little over two hours for the police to open the unlocked door, wrestle him to the ground and remove her.It was much later that she learned he was delusional and had to be hospitalized.After that incident there were a couple of other stalkers that were handled quickly, efficiently and with restraining orders.Those two later perpetrators were not delusional but appeared to be aficionados of the young female sporting scene and seemed to move on with little argument.Who knew who they bothered after her?Once Grace understood exactly what had been going on she also understood there were predators out there, people who preyed on pretty young athletes, male and female.They usually began by giving small gifts or flowers and praising their talent, but too soon theyd be seen at every practice and competition, always trying to get closer, to chat it up with the coaches or athletes.It was very likely a combination of her own close calls and the tearful words from that young skater, Shannon Fields, that caused Grace to fire such rash and destructive accusations at the coach, Hal Nordstrom, suggesting hed been inappropriate.Poor little Shannon had said to Grace, You dont understand!I gave him everything he asked for.Everything, even if it was horrible!Grace believed, in her gut, that Shannon had been talking about something other than, more than, practice.She had no evidence.But he did have a sleazy, lecherous look in his eye and he did way too much fondling and butt patting.What did she know about it?She had Mikhail Petrov, that cold, angry, often silent little Russian who never touched her, not in anger, not in praise.Since his compliments came in the harsh, brittle Russian tongue, she had no way of knowing, for years, that he was sentimental on the inside.Looking back, she could see that Mikhail had almost become the man of her small family; both Winnie and Grace had depended on him.He was always present, completely devoted.Mikhail also had strong opinions about Hal Nordstrom.He used one phrase whenever he referred to that particular coach.He is piece of shit.Winnie had told her to keep her mouth shut and when she hadnt, Nordstrom sued them for defamation and Winnie had settled with an undisclosed sum.When, a few years later, Nordstrom was arrested for molesting several young skaters, Grace felt vindicated.But did Winnie apologize?Just the opposite.You could have saved me considerable money if youd just kept your mouth shut.And he wouldve eventually been found guilty anyway.It was a long couple of hours before Mikhail called her back.He is out, moya radost, he said, his Russian for my happiness.But he is with family in Florida.They swear on bibles he is safe and taking medicine.Ill get this verified to my satisfaction.Oh, Mikhail, what if theyre lying?Making excuses?I have called police.I want they should answer me.We shall see.Are you safe?I think so, she said weakly, looking around again.Why would he even want me now?Im not on the ice or in the news!He shouldnt even want me anymore!Ach, I cant know the head of a crazy man!If there is doubts, you must take steps.Call police.Or, he said, hesitating briefly, call Winnie.She will not abandon you.A nervous laugh that was almost a sob escaped her.The last thing she wanted was to be controlled by her mother again.She talked to Mikhail while she walked to the front door, put up the closed sign and locked it.They talked for just a few minutes.She learned he was in Chicago for some exhibition skating and then would be heading to Southern California, which had become his home base.Mikhail was over sixty.He was once a competitive skater but gave that up in his early twenties, knowing he was not good enough to be great.But he had the potential to build champions and had been coaching ever since.Hed had only one brief marriage because, Is not the life for family man.Grace wasnt quite sure how much or how little that influenced her decision to get out.What do I care?Mikhail would say.I make winners, that is what I do.Grace wanted more.Or less, as the case may be.I would like to see you sometime, she told him before hanging up.You have to find me, he told her.We would have good meal, laughs, old times.Maybe you skate for me once!Maybe, she said.For old times only.I was better making rules, telling you when you will skate and what you will do.I dont follow so good.I know this, she said, laughing through nostalgic tears.After they hung up, she dimmed the lights in the shop.When youre closed, youre closed.She didnt have the courage to go upstairs to her loft.She had an irrational fear that he was waiting for her up there.He was really a kind of tragic, pathetic man who was completely out of reality, left in the care of an older sister who wasnt married and promised to always guard him closely, a woman who really cared about him and was traumatized by the reality that he could possibly hurt someone.She heard from Troy every day.If he didnt call her after school, she called him.Shed give him till six or so, then shed text him and ask him what he was doing after work.In the meantime, she thought about Mikhail and she cried.The truth was, she missed skating for him.She even missed competition and the raw nerves of it.She had no regrets about leaving itshed accomplished everything she could and the strain was sometimes debilitating.It was funny that the girl who was her fiercest rival, who hated her more than anyone on the circuit, an American named Fiona Temple, hadnt ever made her mark.Fiona, who had her own posse of mean girls, spread more dirt about Grace than anyone else, making sure everyone knew that while most hardworking parents got up at four to take their kids to training and borrowed against the mortgage to pay for it, Rich Bitch Izzys mother put her in a town car at dawn to be delivered to the rink.Fiona, who celebrated the most when Grace walked away, hadnt done anything significant since.She had believed the only thing that stood in the way of gold medals was Grace, yet with Grace gone China and Russia wrapped up the medals.The pressure to stay in the competition had been fierce from all quarters, from Winnie, from her team, from her country.You do what you have to do, but until the day comes, say nothing!Mikhail had warned her.Telling is losing.Any other coach wouldve dumped her.In her circles, winning was everything.World famous coaches dont waste their time on competitors who want to quit.But he stuck with her, gave her everything he had and she worked her ass off for him.Mikhail wasnt warm and fuzzy, but he loved her like a daughter, protected her and challenged her and to this day had not abandoned her.So she went to her last competition, the biggest in the world, angry and determined to strike one final blow for everyone who depended on her.And she took it.Took it all.She took it home by a mile.Winnie had her gold medal.Fiona hadnt even made the cut.The back door to the shop rattled as someone tried to get in.She nearly jumped out of her skin.She had to take a couple of deep breaths and wipe her eyes before creeping to the door to see who it was.Gracie, whats wrong?Troy said.Youre crying.Dont ask me why, just please go upstairs and make sure no one is up there, ready to jump on us and kill us, she said.What?he asked, aghast.When its safe, well talk up there.Im not sure if I locked the door, but some days I dont.Ive gotten so relaxed...Grace, what the hell?Please, she begged.Youll understand as soon as I can talk about it.I was going to explain some things anyway.Before your friends came to visit, I was going to tell you so it wouldnt be vague anymore...but for right now, can you please check?And be very careful!Troy shook his head and went upstairs.He looked around her loft thoroughly, but nothing seemed out of place.He was back down in less than two minutes.Its okay.Did you look everywhere?He nodded.Even in the kitchen trash and the refrigerator.Come on.She clutched an envelope in her hand.When they were sitting across from each other in her tiny kitchen she started to explain.My real name is  				I know, he said.You know?Sorry.I wasnt going to tell you, but I cant fake surprise.Youre all over the fucking internet, Gracie.I dont know how you felt, how you feel, but I know who you are.And that you won it all and walked away.Do you know about the rumors?That I accused a coach of inappropriate sexual behavior with a minor?That I was sued?That there were stalkers?That everyone hated me?He shrugged.I got most of the facts.I dont know how anyone could hate you.Most of all, I dont know why its a secret.So she started at the beginning, born into figure skating, the daughter of a champion and coach, the bullying from jealous girls, pranks aimed at hurting her skating, the exhausting training and travel and no friends.The coaches demanded everyone behave nicely toward each other, but when the coaches werent looking...The rest of them were all so close, she said.They shared hotel rooms to save costs and I stayed alone.My mother would rent big town houses that came with domestic help and everyone thought because of that, I had it so easy, why wouldnt I do well?It came up in every interview and articleas if all we had to do was write a check and first place was mine.All I wanted, the whole time I was growing up, was to be like everyone else.Nothing nastier than jealous teenage girls, he said.He gave her cheek a little stroke.If I cried or pouted they called me poor little rich girl.And yet there were millions of girls all over the country who watched you skate with envy and adoration.But I never met them.The happiest day of my life wasnt winning the goldit was handing it to my mother and walking away.Where did you go?To Mamie and Ross.They were a couple without children who had worked for my mother since she was a girlover thirty years.He was a driver and she was a housekeeper.They were always so good to me and when they left my mothers employment they opened a flower shop in Portland.They trained me in the business.Is there no other family?Remember I told you about a cousin who wrote me asking for a loan?He nodded.That wasnt a cousin and it wasnt a loan.Thats a half brother, Barry, who is twenty years older than me.My father and his first wife divorced years and years before my mother knew him.He supported his ex wife and Barry until Barry was twenty one.Hes forty eight now and has been asking for money his whole life, but I dont remember even three times he visited.My dad gave him money sometimesmy parents fought about it.When my father died, he didnt leave Barry anything.I dont know where he is.Last I heard from him, when I told him there was no money, he was in Texas.Troy immediately smelled an ill wind.Maybe Barry is still butt sore about that, he said, tapping the envelope in her hand.She handed it to him.I never had a relationship of any kind with himhe was grown when I was born.No, this is just like the note I remember from years ago.The only one I saw before I was snatched.Could he know exactly what was in it?Troy asked, opening it up and looking at the typed sentence.I dream of you every night.B.  Its signed B.   				She shook her head.Thats Bruno.Bruno Feldman.The man who held me in a supply closet until the police came.Hes been in a psychiatric hospital and Im told hes out and with family somewhere in Florida.Barry doesnt know thats what the notes looked like.No one knowsjust me, my mother, Mikhail...Mikhail?My coach.One of my coaches.We keep in touch a little bit.Of course he was there at the time.Things got pretty crazy because the first notes came while my father was sick, then he snatched me after my father had died.So much happened at once.One of your coaches?She nodded.There was a team and several different coaches and instructors and trainers.Endurance training, ballet, ice work.For me there was also yoga, sports therapy, and then the tutors and homework.How many hours a day was that?he asked.I dont know.Every one of them, I think.It started early, ended late.Thats not even counting fittings for costumes, choreography, music...and did I mention homework?How about the number of nights I went to bed with bags of ice wrapped to my ass or calves?He smiled at her.You earned those medals, Gracie.It was a lot to give up.But are you happy now?I was, she said, her eyes glistening again.Until that came.She sighed.What kind of jollies does a person get out of just scaring me to death?He shook his head.Its not normal, you know.Its sick and twisted.And from what you tell me, not entirely his fault.I dont know what to do, she said.I feel like I should run and hide.Thats because youre scared and upset.But its going to be all right.Youll have to think things through a little, ask yourself some questions...He got up and opened the little fridge.He didnt find what he wanted, so he looked in the small wine rack on top and pulled out a bottle of Merlot.He opened it and poured a small glass for her.Have a little of this and take a few deep breaths.Im not going to let anything happen to you.I really dont expect you to  				You dont expect me to help protect the girl I love?he asked.She stared at him.You love me?Of course I do, Gracie.Couldnt you tell?You never said anything about love...I was waiting for you to trust me, to be honest with me.Look, I understand how you could want to escape that old life, as difficult as  				No, Troy, you dont!I dont want to be that person anymore!That friendless person so many people talked about and hated!Do you have any idea how painful it is to be the constant object of everyones jealousy?As if I had something that belonged to them?As if my mothers money could buy anythingwell, it cant buy safety or a family or love!And so many people admired you, also, he said.But, no matter what name you decide to use, Im always going to think of you as Gracie.Everyone loves you.Youre not an overworked, abused, overexposed teenage girl anymore.And the first thing you have to let go of is all the secrecy.Your friends cant watch out for you if they dont know anything.When you let the cat out of the bag, people are going to wonder why in the world youd keep an accomplishment like that a secret.Because they dont understand how hard it is to be in that life!Youre not in it anymore, honey.He laughed a little and grabbed the last cold beer out of her fridge.I have to admit, I had trouble understanding why youd hide that.Gracie, I get that a lot of it was hard, worse than hard, but its also an achievement.No ones going to hate you for it.She sipped her wine.We dont know that for sure.Yes, I know it.First thing were going to do is get you a couple of things for protection.I think we can find em online real easy and get them sent overnight.Maybe some pepper spray.How about a stun gun?A Taser.I have to admit, there are a few people Id like to zap...Thats my girl.Only bad guys, okay, baby?Then were going over to see Seth.He needs to know theres been this contact.I dont know if youd call it a threat, exactly, but its creepy and hes the law around here.Besides thats a good time for you to unload all this on your best friend.You know you can trust Iris to accept you as exactly who you are, no kidding.I guess, she said.Ten  				Iriss house was the scene of quiet domesticity.It almost brought tears to Graces eyes, she was that envious.It wasnt quite seven and apparently they were just getting around to dinner.Seth had changed out of his deputys uniform into a pair of jeans and a sweater.Since Troy had called and asked if he and Grace could stop by to have a word with them, Iris had added two plates to their dinner table.Oh, you shouldnt have, Grace said.But of course I should have!And I apologizeit isnt much.I was just about to put in a frozen pizza and since you wanted to stop by, I pulled out a second.To my embarrassment, I have a good supply of frozen pizzas!I doctor them a littleextra pepperoni, cheese and mushrooms.Thats almost like cooking, right?Seth said.Come in.Lets toast whatever you have on your mind.I dont think this is toastable, but its definitely drinkable.Grace has something to tell you.Then we could use a little help, Troy said.Absolutely, Seth said.Lets sit in the kitchen.I hope nothings wrong, Iris said, pulling out a chair for Grace.Somethings wrong, Grace said.Ill try to give you the short version.I havent been entirely honest with you about my past.My life.Im not exactly who you think I am.Im sorryits not that I didnt trust you.By now it was getting a little easier to talk, since telling Troy was the hard part.She got the whole story out without all the details about daily life as a competitor, in about fifteen minutes.Iris, stunned by this new information, punctuated the story with Seriously?Youre kidding me!and Holy crap!My God, youre famous, she finally said.I thought you looked familiar but couldnt place the resemblance.Only famous at certain times and in certain places, but Im not that competitor anymore.Which is why I didnt say anything.And its also why this freaked me out.This guy was obsessed with me.She slid the envelope toward Iris while she explained what had happened with Bruno.Iris passed the note to Seth, who frowned when he read it.Is this the only contact?he asked.There hasnt been anything since he was put in the hospital.And only my parents and the police knew about the way the note was writtenthat one typed line and the initial B.  Could he still be obsessed with me?Anything is possible, Seth said.Can you find out if hes still secure with his family in Florida?Troy asked.Ill make some calls.Ill get in touch with the police department there.Do you know the name of the psychiatric facility?She gave it to him.When my old coach checked, he was told he wasnt a patient any longer, that he lived with his family.Grace, Iris said.This envelope has no postal stamp on it.Huh?She gave the envelope to Seth.It wasnt postmarked, she repeated.It must have been slipped into your mailbox.Oh, God, Grace said weakly.Hes here?Lets not make assumptions, Seth said, reexamining the envelope and then slipping the note inside.The envelope went in his pocket.Im going to look into this.Iris, get those pizzas in, okay?He immediately turned his attention back to Grace.Let me tell you something, Grace.If theres an odd stranger lurking around Thunder Point, hes going to stand out like a wart on my nose and even without telling anyone Im looking, someones going to tell me.Especially on the main street that runs through town, past all the businesses.Gina never misses a thing, I miss less.Waylan was robbed about ten years ago and hes still talking about it, still checking every face on the street.In fact, this whole mystery will be easier to solve if some stranger came around and slipped the note into your mail slot.Iris put a glass of wine at her place and Graces and asked Troy what hed like.Then a couple of beers appeared in front of Troy and Seth.After sliding the pizzas into the oven, Iris sat down again.But, Seth went on, Im going to tell my staff and the business neighbors that a suspicious note was left in your mail slot and Im looking for who could have done that to be sure youre safe.In the meantime, put a note on the door to ring the bell and lock the front and back doors.Ill find out about your former stalker, but I may not hear back from anyone until the morning.Listen, I dont know if youll take this as good news or bad, but I would be very surprised to find some mentally ill patient from fourteen years ago is still obsessed with you and made it across an entire continent, made himself invisible and shook you up with a copy of an old note.I think this is something else altogether.But no one knows about this, she said.Thats seldom the case, especially after so long.I have no idea what the motive could be, but I doubt this is still a closely held secret.But who would do this?Who could possibly care?she asked.Seth shook his head.I dont know.Yet.But Ill be looking for a reason.And you have to think about it, too.Maybe an enemy?Someone who thinks you have money?Have you ever been followed by reporters?A jealous family member?Your mother?Troy asked.Shes not happy with your decision to leave competition and you said shes really controlling.I cant imagine, Grace said.Shes been impossible and demanding but, to her credit, shes never been underhanded.Maybe you should contact her, Seth said.Try to get a read on her.Id hate to do that.Weve been estranged since I left competition.Well, give it serious thought, Seth said.And keep the doors locked.I wont leave Grace alone, Troy said.Ill make sure shes safe in her shop before I go to school tomorrow.And were going to get some self defense things.You knowpepper spray and a Taser.Seth groaned.God, I hate when people do that.People get hurt.Waylan got himself a Taserthe kind that shoots out the prongs.He accidentally Tasered his cat.I have guns, Troy said.Seth groaned again, louder.I assume Grace is not trained in firearms.I am, Troy said.But theyre for hunting.And youre right, shes so small Id be afraid it would only put a shotgun or rifle in the hands of someone who shouldnt have it.Hey, Grace interrupted.Am I a part of this discussion?Because I kind of like the idea of having some kind of weapon!The bigger and scarier, the better!Are those guns in a safe place?Seth asked Troy.Theyre in my apartment and theres a great lock on the door.I replaced the apartment lock with a couple of good dead bolts because I have some expensive equipment in there.Theyre not loaded.Like I said, I do a little hunting.Make sure they stay unloaded, Seth said.I can keep her safe until youre back on duty tomorrow, Troy said.Yeah, Ive seen you in action, Seth said with a chuckle.That takedown at the high school a few months ago, that was dramatic.You were showing off, but it was helpful.Helpful, Troy said sarcastically, speaking of the day Iris was threatened by a very big, very angry and abusive student and Troy happened to be there at the right time.Seth was there second.The men talked about that incident while Iris took the pizzas out of the oven, let them sit on the counter for a few minutes to cool.Then Grace and Iris stood at the counter, cutting up the pizzas.Iris, I cant eat.Im sorry, Grace said.I know its not chicken soup, but you should have something.A bite or two.Dont be afraid nowTroy and Seth are on this.He didnt say anything about staying with me until we came over here.Grace, dont you know how he feels about you?Hes crazy about you!And I cant believe you were this famous person and were afraid to tell me!Iris said.I wasnt afraid.I just wanted you to like me for who I ama flower girl.How could you doubt that?Youre the best flower girl this town has ever seen.Oh, jeez, what am I going to do?Grace said.I have weddings in April!I cant shut down!I cant run!You know bridestheyre all on such a weak string to start with.Every small thing that goes wrong turns them insane.Their flowers have to be on time and perfect.You dont have to shut down.I cant explain how this would be possible but I bet this note is some kind of ugly prank.Seth will find out.Hes not only very good at this sort of thing, hes committed.Hes a good cop.* * *  				Grace and Troy took a swing by his apartment so he could gather up some clothes, his backpack and laptop so he wouldnt have to go home in the morning before work.Grace was restless through the night, even with Troy beside her.She tossed and slept little and had one terrible dream, but it was not about Bruno.She was skating but her costume wasnt covering her body and her legs wouldnt move.She couldnt see the audience but she could hear them laughing.There was one faceher biggest rival, Fiona, laughing at her, pointing, howling.In the dream, Grace worked harder.She tried relaxing and focusing and her legs began to move, but something about what she was doing was horribly difficult.She realized she was trying to skate uphill; the ice was slanted sharply upward.Her heart was pounding and her stomach ached, but she strove for poise.She looked down at her feet and the skates were gone, replaced by her Ugg boots.All the pressure of performance crippled her; all the fear of failure brought that lump back to her throat and she knew she couldnt do it, that it would be a disaster.Worse than that, she looked like a fool.She tried to skate in boots while covering her breasts where the costume had fallen away.And what costume was that?Some purple tulle thing that looked ridiculous!Her heart raced and she woke up with a sob, gasping.Hey now, Troy whispered.Youre okay.Youre safe.She curled into him and tried to slow her pulse.She wanted to tell him she hadnt been afraidshed been back in that stressed place, the weight of performance anxiety bearing down on her.Troys arms were around her and she came back to her sensesit was just a silly dream.Nothing like that had ever happened to her.But she had felt those feelings beforethe fear that shed biff it and go slamming into the ice.Her mother would harp on it for ages, pointing out every flaw.In fact, even her best skating seemed not to be good enough.She had so loved skating, yet every day of her life had been filled with the burden of anxiety and desperation.Troys lips were on her neck and she turned in his arms to meet his mouth with a kiss so hungry she all but consumed him.He growled deep in his throat and his hands were urgently moving.She parted her legs for him and with a deep groan he rolled her onto her back.He reached for a condom and then he reached for her.His fingers massaged her roughly; she was slick with desire.She pulled him to her, her hands on his butt.He was quickly inside her, pumping expertly.She couldnt be quiet.Her sighs turned to soft moans as she met him thrust for thrust.This is the only place I want to be, she thought with a mixture of gratitude and despair.Her orgasm was so tight and hard Troy stopped breathing for a second.Then he slammed into her and pulsed with incredible power, making her come all over again.They lay panting, clinging to each other.They were silent for a long time before Troy spoke.That should help you sleep.I dont want to sleep, she said, gently stroking his back.I just want this.Do you now?he asked with a chuckle.He brushed her hair back from her face and kissed her again.Sometimes you make me wonder if I have any control at all.It seemed like you had plenty.No, sweetheart.I definitely lost my head.Gracie, if were going to get ahead of this thing with the note, youre going to have to be very brave.Youre going to have to get back some of that feisty girl.Like the little witch I met on Halloween nightfull of attitude.Youre going to have to trust some people to help you.She was quiet for a moment.He had no idea how strong shed had to be!Since she was just a little girl.But then she remembered she had won the gold by being pissed off and single minded.She had decided to give it everything she had.You really havent seen me in action yet, she finally said.In the morning, they proceeded as planned.After showering and eating a light breakfast, Troy made sure she was secure in the shop behind locked doors.At midmorning, Seth rang the bell and she let him in.Well?she asked.I hope you consider this good news because I do.Your stalker, Bruno, is safely monitored in a group home in Hillsboro County, Florida.He takes his meds and visits his sister regularly and has not been out of contact with his sponsors for even twenty four hours since entering the group home.According to his sister, he has not had delusions about you for over a dozen years, thanks to his medication.And thats good news?she asked.Then whos trying to drive me insane?Easy, Grace.Its a mean prank.But there was no threat.What are you going to do about it?she asked.Seth frowned, she couldnt miss it.Im going to be vigilant.Im going to tell Gina, Carrie, Waylan and Dr.Grant that someone left an anonymous note that frightened you and we dont know who or why.Im going to ask them to watch for strange or suspicious persons.Thats about all I can do.Cant you do something more?Like check it for fingerprints or something?No, Grace, he said.I know you feel vulnerable and Im going to keep my eyes open for this joker, but there hasnt been a crime.Your shop or residence hasnt been broken into, no one has threatened you.I have no reason to think youre in danger.I think you should be cautious and alertdefinitely let me know if theres further contactbut even though its suspicious and suggests a link to an old, resolved crime, at this point its nothing more than an innocuous note.In itself, the note isnt even malicious.In fact, it could be a coincidence that the wording is the same.Its not a coincidence, she said.Stick with the locked doors for the time being, all right?And look over my shoulder a lot?she asked.Look, Grace, when those notes were originally sent by your stalker he had a plan that put you in jeopardy.He hasnt delivered this note.Do you have any reason to believe anyone means you harm?She thought for a moment before she shook her head.I think its mean, doing that to you.Ill keep my eyes open.Ill watch the shop when Im in town.Ill tell the other deputies to watch.But it just doesnt follow that whoever did this wants to hurt you.Of course youre right, she said.But someone did do it to scare me.I cant imagine why.Thats the mystery, isnt it?he said.You going to be all right?She shrugged.I guess.Im not going to let something like this beat me.It really pisses me off.Good.It should.Call me if anything happens that worries you.Anything at all.Thanks, Seth.I understand theres nothing much more that can be done.I appreciate the time you put into this.He touched his forehead in a salute.Well be on duty, Grace.When he left, she stepped out onto the sidewalk behind him.It was a sunny early April day, but the front of the shop wasnt as exciting as usual.She hadnt put out her sidewalk displays because some asshole had forced her in behind locked doors with a stupid little note.She turned, stomped back into the shop and dragged out her big wooden bunny for Easter.She cranked out her awning.Next, she pulled out a wicker basket filled with plastic daffodils and a sign that read Spring Sale!Then she unpacked her yellow, pink, mint green and pale blue banner that read Easter Flowers!Order Now!She fixed it over the door.And finally she tore off the note over the doorbell.Seth was right, she thought.Its mean and creepy but its not an open threat.She would be cautious and safe.She refused to be insanely paranoid.If anyone crazy came at her, shed beat him over the head with her ceramic tulip sculpture.However, she did keep the back door locked, just to be sure.* * *  				Ray Anne painted her second bedroom, bought new linens for the bed and reupholstered the window cornices with matching fabric.She did it all herself, as she always had.Although she knew every handyman within a hundred mile radius, she was also adept at home repairs and decorating.She knew how to hang wallpaper, install crown molding, replace wallboard and a dozen other things.In preparation for Gingers arrival, she removed all her clothes, shoes and purses from the closet in the guest roomshe had used it for her overflow wardrobe.There was a small bath and shower in her bedroom and a larger bathroom with tub and shower beside the guest room.She cleaned under the sink and stocked it with bath gels, bubble bath, scented soaps, lotions and sponges.She put candles on the back of the commode and on the side of the tub.She was nervous as a cat, waiting for her Gingersnap.She didnt know how she could help her get beyond this dark patch.How does anyone get past it?Poor Al had spent over thirty years trying to move beyond the death of his own baby son.I must have held on to that pain as stubbornly as an old bull, Al told her.Ginger was driving down from Portland on Monday.At noon she still hadnt arrived and Ray Anne started to worry.She called her cousin and Dickie said shed gotten an early start and should be there.Ginger didnt answer her cell phone when her father called or when Ray Anne called.At two, just about the time Ray Anne was thinking of asking Seth to check with the state troopers to see if thered been any accidents, Ginger pulled up in front of Ray Annes little house.Ray Anne had seen Ginger four times in the months since the baby died.She hadnt been looking good then.She wasnt looking any better now.As Ray Anne walked toward Ginger, who was pulling her suitcase out of the trunk, she thought perhaps the girl was steadily deteriorating.She was far too thin, that was obvious even while she wore her coat.She was pale under her freckled complexion and her expression had become permanently downcast.Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail; the beautiful strawberry blonde locks had gone dull and dark.She obviously hadnt done a thing to it in months.There you are!Ray Anne said cheerily.I was starting to get worried!I stopped to look at the ocean, Ginger said.Well, of course!I should have thought of that!But now youre here, lets get your things inside.Ive got it, Ginger said, snapping up the pull handle.Is that all youve got?One bag?Its all I need, she said.Well, I guess youll be doing laundry then.Come on, lets get you settled.Ray Anne took the handle of the suitcase and pulled it up the walk and into the house.I cleaned out the guest room and the bathroom, so its all yours.I put some pampering things in there for yousoaps, lotions, candles.Did you bring a hair dryer?I dont need one.No wonder her hair was so flat and thin looking.She must be washing it and letting it dry any which way.And she wasnt using any product!We can share mine.Or maybe well get you a new one.Really.Im fine.Right in here, Ray Anne said briskly, pulling the suitcase into the newly painted and decorated bedroom.Voil!she said, throwing an arm wide to showcase her decorating.Thanks, Ginger said, not noticing how pretty it was.Ill just lay down for a while.No, maam, Ray Anne said, lifting the suitcase onto the bed.Were going to unpack, hang and put away your clothes.She unzipped the suitcase and found the items inside had shifted because it wasnt even full.Or maybe they hadnt and Ginger had just haphazardly tossed them inside.She lifted out the first pair of wrinkled jeans.Then a second.Then a long sleeved T shirt.Then an old sweatshirt that she might have used when she painted something...years ago.And her underwearpathetic.Oh, brother, Ray Anne muttered.Ginger just sat on the bed.She didnt respond.Are we even related?Ray Anne asked her.She lifted a dingy pair of granny panties and let them dangle from one finger.Do we share any DNA at all?Ginger shrugged.Just wasnt a priority, Ray.Why bother?Ray Anne sat on the edge of the bed and took one of Gingers hands.Ill tell you why we bother.Because there are things you can do to try to get beyond devastating pain.They might be small, stupid things, but they actually help a little.Things like fixing yourself up so you look better than you feel.Getting out helpsyou have to live in this world.Work helps.Meaningful work, if possible, and thats something different for everyone, but keeping busy instead of lying in bed and making constant love to the hurtthat can help.Tell me somethingare you taking anything?Like what?Like tranquilizers or antidepressants or anything?Not anymore, she said.They werent working.And I kept thinking about swallowing the whole bottle.Ray Anne gasped.Jesus, she muttered.She wondered if she should hide all pills from Aspirin to hormones.And sharp objects.She stiffened her spine resolutely.All right, I have to run a quick errand I put off while waiting for you to get here so you wouldnt find me gone when you arrived.I want you to put away your clothes in this chest and the closet.Then put the empty suitcase in the closet.Do that before you lie down.From what your daddy tells me, youve perfected napping and Im willing to bet youre all caught up on sleep.Ill be back in fifteen or twenty minutes.All right, Ginger said, standing.When Ginger hung her coat in the closet, Ray Anne noticed her jeans were sagging off her flat butt and her tennis shoes were beat up.The girl was a complete mess.Her attire and body language were such a put off, holding back any well intentioned person, it was as if she longed to go it alone and wallow in grief.Do you have my cell number?Ray Anne asked.Probably, she said.Wheres your phone?I dont know.Probably in my purse.Its turned off.Why is it turned off?Ginger flashed her an angry look.Because no ones going to call me!And theres no one I want to talk to!Is that so?Ray Anne asked without flinching.Well, your father and I were trying to reach you to see if youd had a problem on your drive and we went straight to voice mail, worrying us even more.Now, I can understand if youre avoiding calls, but is it either fair or kind to ignore people who love you and are concerned about you?If you want to do this to yourself forever, I dont suppose anyone can convince you otherwise, but your parents suffered a painful loss, as well, and I dont think they can deal with another one.Im going to call them and tell them you arrived safely.Meanwhile, please turn on your phone.Charge it.Whatever.Ill be back in twenty.Ray Anne, who never walked anywhere and was always seen in her little BMW, walked down the street, down the hill and into Carries deli.Carrie and Rawley appeared to be cleaning up.Customer traffic was usually at its lowest in midafternoon, heaviest for lunch and dinner.When Ray Anne walked in, Rawley automatically disappeared into the kitchen in the back of the deli.Well, hello, Carrie said.Call Lou and cancel dinner.Ginger just arrived and shes not fit to go out.Is she sick?Carrie asked.Shes horribly depressed.She can barely speak.The only thing more depressing than her personality right now is her wardrobe.Apparently it feels better to dress in poorly fitting rags.Its like sackcloth and ashes.She shook her head in misery.I should have listened to myself.I cant help with this.She is way outside of my experience.I dont know what to do with her.She took a breath.Can I please have a to go dinner?Since were not able to go out?Sure.Now tell me what happened.Ray Anne explained about Gingers gaunt appearance, horrible clothing, turned off phone and so on.I was already very sad for her and about the baby.Of course I held that babyhe was a perfect baby!But its been months and one look at her and youd think it happened this morning.Shes in terrible pain.Just terrible.Shell have to work through it, Ray.Everyones grief time is different.Maybe you can get her into some kind of counseling or something.Well look at that, she said.First, I have to clean her up and feed her.Carrie stood back from the deli case.Feeding people was her specialty.Whats your pleasure?Something with carbs.And a big salad for me.God knows, I dont need fattening up.If my ass gets any bigger I wont be able to stay up on these heels.Carrie laughed.The chicken enchiladas are pretty irresistible.And I have some chips, salsa and guacamole.Perfect.And a salad.I can eat a little Mexican food and plenty of salad and she can eat a lot of chips and enchiladas and a little salad.And listen.Would you ask Lou about counselors?I can do better, Carrie said.When Ashley was on that downward spiral a couple of years ago, Lou found Gina a great counselor for Ashley.She specialized in young adults, but she might know someone to recommend for Ginger.Would you like me to ask Gina to give her a call?Please, Ray Anne said.I dont know if Ill be able to convince Ginger to go, but reallysomething has to be done to move forward.I dont know what else to do.And her daddy is rightshe hasnt gotten any better.What have you done so far?Carrie asked as she dished dinner into containers.Not much.I told her she couldnt take a nap until her clothes were unpacked and shed better turn on her phone or else.And...She looked down somewhat shyly.I bought some lotions and stuff for her bathroom.I always feel better if Im a little nice to myself.Baby steps, Ray Anne said.Carrie smiled.Just do what comes naturally to you, Ray.Youre not a professional grief counselor but you know a lot about managing your own grief.And youre very sympathetic.Thank you, she said.Im trying not to mother Ginger, but Im thirty years older than she is and even though I havent been a mother, it kind of comes naturally.Carrie passed the food across the deli counter.Be yourself.Youre a good woman and you love her.I do love her.She was my little angel.She dug around in her purse for money.Ah, on the house, Ray Anne.Tell her Im sorry were not going out tonight, but this is my contribution.Eleven  				Grace had always been capable of focus and discipline.She had amazing willpower and she thought with a clear head about what Seth had said.She reminded herself it was a note and not from the person who had threatened her fourteen years ago.She would be careful.Perhaps shed be overly cautious for a while, but that was all right.She was not going to melt into a sniveling little girl.In years past, when she was a teenager and the exhaustion or the other competitors or even her mother got the best of her, when she broke down, it got her nowhere.When that happened, when she cried, the abuse was even worse.The only thing that had ever worked for her was strength and grit.So she relied on that again.She focused on her abilities.She was small but very strong.Troy was at the shop as soon as he was done with work.He had to knock on the back door because, feisty or not, she wasnt an idiot.I called Coop and told him I couldnt help at the bar this week because theres stuff going on.Lets not do that, she said.Lets not panic and run scared.He frowned.You shook and had nightmares all night.Yeah, I hope I dont do that anymore.Im much stronger and more sensible than that.Go help at the barI know how much you enjoy it.I think Ill get something from Carrie to warm up for dinner.If itll make you feel better, Ill text or call you when Ive closed the shop and gone upstairs.If you want to come by later, thats okay, but really, you dont have to.I think Ill be fine.Ill lock the back door and even slide a chair against it.This is a pretty sudden shift.What did Seth say to you?Nothing so muchjust that Bruno is not a threat and it was only a note, not a crime.Are you sure youre not in shock?She took a deep breath and leaned one hip against the worktable.Sometimes I forget about my greatest accomplishments growing up because they werent medals or ribbons or plaques.Do you know what one of the ESPN commenters said about me when I was fifteen?He said, That little girl is one hell of a fighter.Dont mess with her.That made Troy smile.You must regret leaving it sometimes.Never.I was done with that life.I did everything I could do.You cant imagine what it was likeI dont even expect you to try.No, she said, sliding her arms around his waist.I like this life.And if I ever figure out who would try to screw it up with a scary little note, Im going to make his life miserable.When I said I wanted you to be brave, I didnt mean that you should take any chances.Ill watch the shop while you go get some dinner for later.I want you to call me tonight.Then Ill come over when Im off work.I love it when you come over.But you dont have to babysit me.You had a life before all this, a busy life.We can talk on the phone later, if you want to go home.I think Ill come over, if its all the same to you.At least tonight.Then go home and change, bring your work clothes and laptop...you know the drill.Are you faking brave?Because of what I said last night?No, she said with a laugh.Im faking brave because I just remembered its how I get control.Its how I begin to feel brave.Now stay putit shouldnt take me ten minutes to walk down to Carries.* * *  				Two days later, Troy decided to stop by the deputys office after school before going to the flower shop.As luck would have it, Seth was there, sitting behind his desk, one foot propped casually on the desk while he talked on the phone.Another deputy, Charlie, seemed to be working at the computer on the desk behind Seths.When Seth saw Troy he made excuses into the phone and disconnected.Hey, Seth said.Everything all right?Fine.I just thought I should tell youthat stuff I ordered came today.Grace texted me that she got it at the flower shop.Pepper spray and a Taser.Really, he said, standing up.Mind if I look at it?No, of course not.But its completely legal.Sure.But Id like to know what you could buy so easily and have delivered in just a couple of days.If you can, anyone can.Id just like to know.Troy shrugged.Come on, then.
