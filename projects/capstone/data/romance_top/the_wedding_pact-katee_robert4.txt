Not unforgivable as far as she was concernedthe man deserved a good beatingbut there were consequences.There were always consequences.And if she told SloanNo, it wasnt even an option.Her sister already looked like a woman with one foot in the grave.Carrigan refused to be the thing that pushed her over the edge.James alone didnt have a horse in this race.He might be too arrogant for his own good, but he was a Halloran.When it came right down to it, theyd always be on opposite sides of the line in the sand.Not to mention the carrot he dangled in front of her was one shed commit unmentionable sins to get.Okay, fine.He hauled her out of the booth and tossed a handful of cash on the table.Lets go.He took her hand and led the way through the back door.In the alley, he paused.You have a man with you?It took a second for his words to penetrate.Right.Liam.She dug her phone out of her purse and typed out a quick text.The bodyguard wouldnt be happy, but there wasnt much he could do.And, really, he was rarely happy with the stunts she pulled.They stopped in front of a cherry red muscle car.She raised her eyebrows, but there wasnt much to say.It fit James perfectly, all coiled strength beneath a rough exterior, ready to unleash at a moments notice.He held the door for her and she slipped into the passenger seat.What would I have to do to get you to let me drive this thing?His unexpected grin sent her heart hurtling into her stomach.For you, lovely?All you have to do is ask.Scoot.He tossed her the keys and nodded to the drivers seat.That was all the encouragement she needed.Carrigan hauled her dress up to her thighs and hopped the gearshift to settle behind the wheel.She turned over the engine, a stupid smile spreading over her face at the responding roar it gave.You know how to drive a stick?Yeah.Her oldest brother, Aiden, had taught her when she turned sixteen.She hadnt had a chance to use the skill much in the intervening years, but it was like riding a bike.She hoped.Then take her down 93 south and open her up.This car had the feel of something well loved and completely pampered.She didnt get the feeling he let many people behind the wheeland he was letting her.Carrigan glanced over to find him watching her, an unreadable expression on his face.Like he didnt know what to think of her.Considering she didnt know what the hell she thought of him, she should find it comforting.She threw the car into gear and pulled onto the street.It took twenty minutes to get out of Boston, and she kept expecting James to start his interrogation.To be perfectly honest, she would have told him damn near anything he wanted as long as he let her drive this thing.Behind the wheel she felt totally and completely in control, like she could do anything she set her mind to.The only downside was that it was too cold to roll down the windows and really feel how fast they were going.The comfortable silence continued as she drove south, getting off 93 and working her way by memory through the smaller highways.It was only when she turned into the access road that led into Worlds End park that James spoke.Are you planning on taking me out here and murdering me?She laughed.Just your virtue.Thank fucking Christ for that.But he didnt immediately jump her when she put the car into park and turned off the engine.The darkness felt more absolute here, as if they were the only two people left in the world.This park used to scare me.She wasnt sure where the words came from, but she kept talking.My family isnt big on campingas you can imaginebut my brothers dragged me out here when we were in high school.Nothing particularly traumatic happened, but being surrounded by trees with no noise from civilization still makes my skin crawl.Totally makes sense why you brought us out here, then.She glanced at him, but the lack of light made his expression indecipherable.It was easier to talk to him this way, without those blue eyes that seemed to take in too much drilling into her.Strangely enough, a perverse part of her missed them all the same.The stars seem brighter out here.She opened her door and climbed into the night.The cold hit her hard enough to make her shiver, but there was something about it that was almost as cleansing as Jamess kiss.She inhaled deeply, letting it scour away the last traces of her date.James followed, meeting her at the front of the car and leaning on the hood.He tilted his head back, revealing a throat she wanted to nibble on.Theyre bright.Without looking at her, he snagged her wrist and towed her closer.The warmth of the engine battled the cold that made her breath ghost in front of her.The circles he traced on the sensitive skin of her wrist only heated her further.Now, lovely.She looked at the stars because they were easier to face than the man next to her.My father gave me a list of men he decided were eligible.Tonight was my first date.She shuddered at the memories pushing against her.It didnt make any sense.Nothing particularly horrible had happened.Shed had unwanted men kiss her before, had been forced to pull similar moves, and it had never brought up the core deep revulsion currently leaving an acrid taste in the back of her throat.Shed never lost it like she almost did tonight.Not once.He got handsy.I was forced to defend myself, though Liam would have taken care of him if I hadnt been able to.But shed needed to be the one to do it.She was so goddamn tired of being forced to rely on the men in her life for every little thing.This, at least, shed been able to do for herself.James was so tense beside her, he seemed about to erupt into violence at the drop of a hat.She braced herself for him to demand the name of the man who touched her without permission, or to throw out threats that he may or may not even plan on following through with.But he surprised her again.Did you hurt him?She sure as hell hoped so.Hell be singing soprano for a few hours, at least.Good.And that was that.His thumb continued those circles that both soothed and made her skin prickle.She waited, but he didnt seem inclined to ask any more questions.The man never stopped surprising her.She wasnt sure what she thought about that.Letting the subject drop was fine with her, though, because she was more interested in the other half of their bargain than she was with treading over things she couldnt change and would rather not think about.Make me forget for a while, James.Please.*** How could he resist her?James couldnt.He might be seeing red and determined to figure out who the fuck got handsy with her so he could go rip the man to pieces, but the desire for her undercut all that.She needed him.Thats why he was here tonight, and that was a gift so priceless, he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt he didnt deserve it.Because there was no way he wouldnt fuck this up.He pulled her into his arms and kissed her with everything he had.She smelled like summer, even in late November, a reminder that this wasnt forever and hed be a damn fool to waste a single second.He ran a hand down her spine, fitting her against him, letting her feel exactly how much he wanted her.Christ, he wanted her.She arched against him, soft in all the ways he was hard, offering herself to whatever he had in mind.To have this woman, who was all fiery passion and strength, yield to him, was enough to make his head spin.It made him want to be a better man, a man who might deserve such a woman.It was a pipe dream, a stupid fucking thought, but he couldnt shake it.James backed them around his car and yanked open the passenger seat.Hed never been so happy that hed gone with a 70 Chevelle rather than the 67 Camaro hed had his eye on all those years ago.He guided her into the backseat and followed her in.It wasnt enough space, but with the residual heat from their drive down here, it was better than the cold outside the car.He kissed her again, but he didnt stop at her mouth.Instead, he worked his way over her neck, pausing there to savor the softness of her skin as she quivered against him.A quick yank on the shoulders of her dress exposed her bra, a sheer lace thing that was completely at odds with the rest of her getup.This was the true Carrigan, the woman who loved pretty things and dressed herself to the nines.Get this fucking thing off.He pulled again, sliding it down her body.She lifted her hips to help him, jerking her arms out of the dress and kicking it off.Then there was only her, a few scraps of cloth all that were between his hands and mouth, and her body.Christ, lovely.Faced with the fact this was actually happening was like hitting a brick wall.He wanted her.Fuck, he wanted her so much it was everything he could do not to rip those panties from her body and fall on her like a starving animal.The last timethe only timehed surrounded himself with her had been the closest hed come to losing himself.But this wasnt about him.Hed promised to help her forget, and going from zero to sixty in five seconds flat wasnt going to cut it.James blew out a long breath, fighting for control.Hed barely touched her and he was teetering on the edge.There had to be a better way to go about this, because he didnt trust himself.The answer hit him right between the eyes.He sat back, shifting them around so she lay on the seat and he took the space between her spread thighs.There wasnt a ton of room, but that hands width of space between their bodies would have to be enough.She lifted her head, looking down her body at him.He couldnt see her face clearly, but the flash of her green eyes was enough.His cock was so hard, it was a wonder he could string two thoughts together.Take your bra off.She opened her mouth, and then seemed to reconsider.James Were doing this my way or not at all.Choose.Fine, she snapped.But her movements were slow and steady as she arched her back and reached beneath herself to unhook her bra.Then she lifted her arms and pulled it off slowly, giving him a tease before she finally dropped it onto the floorboard.His heart slammed in his chest, need demanding he reach for her this fucking instant.He clenched his fists.Now the panties.Bossy.She lifted her hips and brought her legs together to slip the fabric off.Then she resumed her position, leaving herself completely open to him.Any more commands?Yeah.He licked his lips.Touch yourself like you did the other night.This time there was no hesitation.She slid her hands up her sides to cup her full breasts, toying with her nipples until they were puckered and practically begging for his mouth.One hand stayed there, fingers still busy, while the other traveled down the center of her stomach, teasing them both, before stopping just above her pussy.You like to watch.It wasnt something hed indulged in often.He usually just saw what he wanted and took it.There were plenty of women willing to throw themselves at him over the years, but none that hed ever done more than fuck.This thing with Carrigan was different.He wanted to crawl inside her mind the same way he wanted her body.It was complicated and uncomfortable, and he sure as fuck didnt want to talk about it right now.One finger, lovely.Trace that sensitive little clit of yours.She obeyed, making that sexy whimper at the first contact, and he couldnt contain it any longer.He slid his hands up her legs, starting at her ankles, bracketing the fine bones with his hands, and then moved up her calves to stop halfway up her thighs.He spread her further, wishing the light was better so he could see every single detail.Show me how you like it.Taking notes?Her voice was breathy as her finger kept up its circling movement.He massaged her thighs, enjoying the way her muscles played beneath her skin and her breath caught in her throat.No point in doing something if you dont do it well.Now, lovely.I want to see you finger fuck yourself.This time there was no hesitation.She slipped first one finger and then two into herself.He could feel her gaze on him, though he couldnt tear his eyes off the sight of what she was doing with her hands.Slow and steady.No.Her back arched, and her other hand joined the one between her legs, starting up where itd left off on her clit.I want it hard.Rough.More.He grabbed her wrist.Dont forget whos in charge.His hand moved like it had a mind of its own, tracing over her soft skin and following the line of her fingers to her pussy.He allowed her to pump two more times, his hand shadowing hers, and when she slipped hers away, his stayed.Take your goddamn hands off her while you still can.But he didnt.Instead, he mirrored her circles around her clit, damn near groaning when she whimpered again.Yes, James.Just like that.Please dont stop touching me.He didnt stop.He needed to hear her make that whimpering sound again because of him.James ran his free hand over her stomach, marveling at how soft her skin was while he took his time exploring her pussy.She was warm and wet, and when he crooked his fingers inside her, she clenched around him.You like that.Carrigan reached over her head, baring her body completely to him.Do it again.He did it again, twisting his wrist so he could circle his thumb over her clit.Each time his fingertips ran over that spot inside her, she cried out and arched up, her body so tight it was like it might explode into a million pieces.Let go, lovely.Ill be here to catch you when you fall.Three more strokes and she was there, her scream ripping through the closed space of the car and her body shuddering with the force of her orgasm.James never took his gaze off her face as he worked her, drawing it out until she was limp and panting.Oh my GodI meanholy shit.He leaned down and kissed her.It didnt matter that he was so hard, he thought he might split the seams of his jeans, or that his mouth watered for a taste of her, or that hed give his left nut to keep going, to know that he was the one making her come until she couldnt come anymore.Thats not what tonight was about.He kept the kiss light, even when she arched into it, and then sat back.Lets get you home.That was the last thing out of his mouth before Carrigan moved.She grabbed his shoulders, leveraging herself up to straddle his lap.Nice try, but Im nowhere near done with you yet.Ten Carrigan recognized what James was trying to doback off before they had sex because part of her was still reeling from her earlier encounter.That wasnt what she wanted from him.With only the shadows between them and their breath fogging the windows of his car, she couldnt shake the feeling that she might never get another chance like this.It was about escape, sure, but it was more than that.Shed spent the last four months pretending that she wasnt jonesing for another shot at James Halloran.Lying to herself.Shed be damned before she let this opportunity pass.His hands rested on her hips, the light touch completely at odds with the tension of his body.He wanted her.She knew he did.But he just as obviously wanted to set her aside and get the fuck out of the car.She had no intention of giving him the opportunity to run with this unexpected honorable streak.Carrigan kissed him, pressing her entire body against his.He resisted her for one heartbeat, two, three, until the fear rose in the back of her mind that maybe shed read the situation wrong and he didnt want her.That hed just given her a pity orgasm.She was half a second from pulling away when he growled against her mouth.As if that sound released him, his grip tightened on her hips, hands sliding down to cup her ass and drag her even closer.His cock was a hard ridge beneath his jeans, and he didnt hesitate to line it up with her still sensitive clit.The friction made her moan, and he ate the sound, his tongue diving into her mouth and taking control the same way hed taken control of her hips.Needing to feel his skin against hers, she reached for the bottom of his shirt and dragged it up over his head.Her hands smacked the roof of the car, but she didnt care.All that mattered was getting James as close to her as he could possibly be.And then they were chest to chest.The shock of having no barrier between her and another person had her going still, wanting to savor every second.Shed had lovers before, but they were always hurried fucks in less than convenient locations.Oh God, Ive never been fully naked with an equally naked man.How pathetic is that?He sensed her hesitation, though he chalked it up to the wrong cause.James gripped the back of her neck.Second thoughts?No.Fuck, no.She couldnt tell him the real reason, not without baring a part of her she didnt share with anyone.Carrigan rolled her hips.Fuck me, James.Please.And she would soak up every second of it like a flower seeking the sun.I tried to do the goddamn honorable thing.She reached for the button of his jeans.Thats not what I want from you.Yeah, Im getting that.He knocked her hand away and undid his pants.She had to shift to the side so he could get them off, but then he hauled her back to straddle him again.I want to see you ride my cock.And when you come, youre going to know that Im the one youre coming for.You understand, lovely?Only me.There was the possessive streak again, the one that had spooked her so badly before.She bit her lip, doing her damnedest to beat the panic back.Its not forever.Im promised to someone else and we both know it.She slid against his cock, her conscious mind taking a backseat as the primal part of her roared to the fore.Tomorrow was another day.All that mattered was how good he made her feel right this second.She moved up, angling until his cock notched at her entrance.James stopped her with a punishing grip on her hips, holding her in place.As much as I want to sink into that tight pussy of yours without a fucking thing between us, its not happening.Condom.Now.She froze, irrational hurt slapping her in the face.You think I think that you deserve better than that.His grip lightened, but not enough for her to actually move.Im clean, but I dont expect you to trust me, and I dont expect you to take a risk that might result in a kid.I dont want there to be a damn thing about this that you regret, lovely.Not a single thing.There was that feeling again, the one that fluttered in her chestlike panic, but not at the same time.She smothered it, though it took more effort this time.Where?Center console.Carrigan wasted no time twisting around to scramble for the latch.There were a handful of condoms in there, and she grabbed the first one she came into contact with.She tore it open and rolled the condom over his cock, trying to slow down when he cursed.But she wasnt in a teasing mood.Not anymore.No, she needed it hard and fast and now.He seemed to be feeling the same way, because he urged her up and then slammed her down on his cock, filling her completely.The breath left her lungs, her thoughts left her head, and there was nothing except Jamess ice blue eyes on hers.He ran his hands up her sides, pausing to cup her breasts.He ran a single finger over the tattoo curving around her left one.Ink?She shifted, biting back a moan, and then did it again.Do you really want to talk about this right now?He hesitated, as if he really did want to talk about it, but finally shook his head.Later.There wouldnt be a later.She didnt want to trade secrets.The things theyd talked about tonight were already enough to leave her feeling raw and vulnerable.She didnt need more.So Carrigan leaned down and kissed him.He growled against her mouth and shifted them, laying her down on the backseat.The new position shoved him even deeper inside her and she moaned.Yes.This.This is what I need.He knew it, too.James hooked her leg over his arm and spread her wider, so he could grind against her clit.This is what you want, lovely.He pulled almost all the way out and thrust hard enough that she had to reach over her head with one hand to keep from sliding into the side of the car.He jerked her back down and did it again.You want my cock, you want the way it feels when I fuck you.Yes.Oh God, yes.But she clamped her mouth shut to keep the words inside.She wouldnt give him more than she already had.Stop.Talking.And.Fuck.Me.The bastard laughed.Struck a nerve, didnt I?He dug a hand into her hair and held her close as he did exactly what she demanded.James fucked her like this was his heaven, like each stroke might be his last, like hed never get enough.And you damn well know how much I like to talk when Im inside you.He kept going, never breaking stride, though his voice had dropped an octave.You make me crazy, lovely.Youre so wet and tight, and the noises coming out of your mouth make me never want to stop.She never wanted him to stop.She bit his shoulder.Harder.Hell, lovely, Id give you damn near anything you wanted if you demand it in that voice.Take me away.Once again, she managed to stop the words before they left her lips.That wasnt what this thing with James was about.He was here to make her forget for a little while.Not forever.There was an expiration date on what they were doing, and shed be a fool to forget that.So she gripped his hair and held him tight.Make me come, James.He kept up that delicious rhythm that had her spiraling closer and closer to the edge with each thrust.Next time youll be coming against my mouth.Im going to fucking worship your pussy with my tongue until youre begging.He slammed into her.You want that.It wasnt a question, but it didnt matter.She answered anyway.Yes.Oh God, yes.Her mind shattered into a million pieces, scattering to the wind, and she clung to him as he kept going until his rhythm faltered and he followed her over the edge with a curse.She slowly came back to herself one sense at a time.The sound of his rough breathing.The intoxicating smell of sex and leather.The way he held her like she was something precious.Her heartbeat picked up.Ive just made a terrible mistake.*** Everything had changed.James rolled over, taking Carrigan with him, so that she was sprawled across his chestas much as a person could sprawl in this backseat.Shed gone tense, so he figured it was only a matter of time before she bolted.Though, considering where they were, she wasnt going to get far.He stroked a hand down her hair.Breathe, lovely.I am breathing.She started to move off him but stopped when she must have realized there was nowhere to go but the floorboard.Youre not going to toss me into the trunk, are you?Guilt threatened to choke him, but he forced it down.Dont throw that in my face.Were past it.You might be.Maybe Im not.She reached around and came up with her dress.Please take me home.She was lying.Just like it had before, this thing that flared between them scared the shit out of her.Hed seen it on her face the first time they had sex, which was why hed demanded her nameso he could find her again.How things played out after thatyeah, it was shitty.But she was past it.She wouldnt have called him tonight if she hadnt finally accepted that he never would have let his father and brother hurt her.Which meant she was in panic mode again right now.He could force her to sit here and talk it out.Or he could let her go.Really, it wasnt much of a dilemma.If hed learned anything about Carrigan, it was that shed go for a persons throat if they backed her into a corner.People had been putting her in cages her entire life.He wasnt about to be one of them.So he sat up.Okay.She froze in the middle of shimmying into her dress.What?I said okay.Ill take you home.Just give me a second to get my pants.He didnt want tonight to end with her running from him, because he wasnt done with Carrigan OMalley.Not by a long shot.James pulled on his jeans and shoes and then pushed the front seat up so he could climb out into the night.He offered his hand to help her out, but she ignored it.So that was how it would be.Fine.He pushed the seat back into place and held the door so she could take the passenger seat.It was going to be a long ride back if the way she crossed her arms over her chest was any indication.Hed need the distraction of driving.Once he got the Chevelle started and the windows defrosted, he headed back toward the city.He didnt speak, and neither did she.James could actually feel her building up walls between them.Retreating.A part of him even understood.Hed had sex before.Hell, hed gone out of his way to keep things at just sex in the past.It was simpler.His life didnt lend itself to being able to build a healthy relationshiphe wasnt even sure if he was capable of it.Easier to keep things at a strictly physical level.That way both parties left satisfied, and the chance of someone getting hurt was virtually nonexistent.That being said, this thing with Carrigan wasnt just sex.Hed known that four months ago, and it was only becoming clearer the more time he spent with her.He admired her fire.He liked that she never hesitated to get in his face and put him in his place if she thought he was out of line.He liked how nothing her family had done to date had broken her.Fuck, he just plain liked her.He took the exit that would spit them out near Beacon Hill, and wound his way up to the block just down from her town house.You want me to?This is good.She already had the door open.Carrigan.He waited for her to look back.Next time you need to forgetor need anything, periodIm here.She flinched like hed raised a hand to her.I dont think thats a good idea.How much time do you have before you need to make a decision?He kept his tone low and even, though all he wanted to do was haul her ass back into the car and get the hell out of herespend a week lost in each other and ignoring the call of the real world.A month.Less than that now.Not long enough.Fuck, he was beginning to think that twenty years with this woman wouldnt be close to enough.But hed take what he could get.Every time you go on one of these dates, the noose is going to tighten around your neck.I can help you forget, lovely.You know it and I know it.He didnt wait for a response, needing to get this out before she bolted.So when the pressure gets too much to handleand it willcall me.Ill be there.I promise.She hesitated, and then shut the car door and walked away.He waited until he saw her enter a brownstone down the block, and then he put the car in gear and drove away.Shed call.She might tell herself that she wouldntshe might even convince herself that she was through with himbut when her back was against the wall, shed call him again.He was sure of it.James headed back into Southie, the upper crust neighborhood that Carrigan lived in slowly replaced by smaller and smaller houses, each in worse repair than the next.Even the ones that obviously had owners who cared about upkeep showed decades of wear and tear.The OMalleys and Hallorans might fight like dogs over the bone that was Boston, but they really came from different worlds.The outward evidence of it in the neighborhoods they lived in was just the beginning.But none of that seemed to matter when he was with Carrigan.He forced himself to set aside the feel good sensation being around Carrigan brought him.There was nothing he wanted more than to dwell on how amazing shed felt squeezing his cock, and how much he wanted to get inside her again at the soonest available opportunity.But he couldnt afford to be any more distracted right now than he already was.And he was seriously fucking distracted.But Ricky was waiting, and so was the real world.Eleven Carrigan spent the next week keeping busy and avoiding all the things she didnt want to think about.The list was getting kind of ridiculous.Shed had a hell of a time keeping a straight face during Mass on Sunday while the priest went on about original sin.Her mind kept going back to the feeling of Jamess hands on her skin and his voice in her ear.If that was a sin, she had no interest in being a saint.She knew she should get the rest of the dates out of the way, but Monday slipped by while she wasnt paying attention, and she spent nearly all of Tuesday with Callie, hiding out from Aileen and her last second wedding plans.And then she blinked and it was Friday and shed managed to get through a six whole days without picking up the phone and dialing James.He had a lot of nerve saying hed be there for her.Shed have to be a fool to trust him.It was more than their shared history though that should be more than reason enough.She didnt trust anyone beyond familyand she didnt even trust her family half the time.People had a nasty tendency to put themselves first when she needed them most.The only person she could trust to take care of her was her.Which meant it was time to stop dragging her heels and get through these dates.Her fate wasnt going to magically change in the next few weeks, and the longer she waited for the initial dates, the less time shed have to actually make a decision.Holding off wasnt going to hurt anyone but her, so she wasnt going to wait any longer.She moved on to the next two names on her list.Kellen ONeill.Dmitri Romanov.An hour of Internet searching later, she had little to no information on either of them.Kellen ONeill was a pretty common name, and the only Dmitri Romanov she could get a bead on was some Russian prince who may or may not be fictional.Probably not her guy.Resigning herself to not knowing a damn thing about these men before she met them, she dialed the number next to Kellens name.Ten minutes later she had a date for dinner that evening.He hadnt even hesitated.It was hard to tell on the phone, but he sounded young and eager.Neither one was a turn on, but it might mean he was easy to manipulate.She filed that away in the back of her mind and dialed the next number.Dmitri Romanov.She blinked.Shed expected someone Russian from the name, but he soundedShe shook her head.This is Carrigan OMalley.Ive been given to understand youre interested in linking your assets to my fathers.Such a careful way of prettying up what this really washer father selling her off to further his business.You understand correctly.Id like to meet with you, this afternoon if possible.Knocking off two of the names today would keep her busyand keep her mind off James.Dmitri chuckled.Ill clear my schedule.Shall I meet you at three?That would be perfect.This Dmitri didnt sound like the type of man to paw at her uninvited, so there was absolutely no reason she should so much as talk to James today.Good.I look forward to meeting you, Carrigan.His accent gave her name an exotic roll, and she couldnt stop a shiver.Damn.Enjoy your day.And then he was gone, leaving her feeling vaguely unsettled.Dmitri Romanov wasnt a man to be underestimated.She frowned.Theyd exchanged a handful of words.Hed canceled his plans to meet her.There was absolutely nothing in what hed said that should be making her skin twitch like she was surrounded by danger she couldnt see.So why is my stomach in knots and my heart beating too hard?She set her phone down next to her on her bed.Growing up in the house of a powerful and ruthless man, it made sense that some part of her instinctively recognized it in this stranger, even over the phone.That had to be it.Chauncey had been a pig.She got the feeling that Kellen was a puppy.Dmitriwell, Dmitri was something else altogether.A knock on her door was all the warning she got before her mother swept into the room, her dark hair perfectly styled, her makeup flawless, and her pantsuit looking like she was ready for brunch.Aileen took in the space with a critical eye, and finally settled on Carrigan.You had a date last night with one of your fathers candidates.It was a fight to keep her face perfectly bland.She could still feel him pawing at her, and the anger over his asshole commentary hadnt dimmed with time.Her interlude with James had made the memory bearable, but she wouldnt hesitate to knock that slimy fuck on his ass again if she ever was forced into his presence.Yes.Chauncy Chauncer.Her mother made a face.New money.As if that summed up everything worth knowing about him.Unfortunately, she wasnt wrong in this particular case.She moved to the dresser and started straightening the pictures there.How did it go?Hes no longer in the running.Aileen looked over sharply.What did he do?She should have known that her mother would pick up on the underlying anger that Carrigan still couldnt shake.Every time she so much as thought Chaunceys name, a slow burning rage rolled through her.Hed insulted her, and then hed touched her without permissionassaulted her.She picked at a nonexistent thread on her comforter.He had problems taking no for an answer.It wasnt something shed ever admit aloud to her father but, as rarely as she and Aileen saw eye to eye, she knew her mother would understand this.Sure enough, her perfectly lipsticked mouth tightened.You took care of it.There wasnt any doubt on her face that Carrigan was more than capable of putting the pig in his place.I got my point across.She just wished shed hit him again.Or kicked him while he was down.Her shoulders tightened at the memory of him shoving her against the wall.Hes a fool, so I doubt it had any lasting effect, but he wont be touching me again.Good.Aileen hesitated and then went back to straightening pictures.Youll let me know if you need to take further actions.Even if she didnt, her mother would find out anyway.She might not be as flashy about it, but Aileen had as manyif not morepeople reporting to her as Seamus did.Of course.Good.Now that thats taken care of, show me this list of your fathers.She handed it over because there really was no other option.Besides, even though her mother was as willing to sell her off as her father was, at least Aileen would take more factors into account than just his potential alley value.I should have asked her before going out with Chauncey.The realization had her straightening her spine.Shed made a mistake.Maybe this would help her to keep from repeating it.I dont want any of them, though.Theres no way they can make me feel as good as James does.She shut that thought down real fast.But it was no use.It wormed its way into the back of her brain, its presence small but nagging all the same.It didnt matter how good the sex was with James, or how he never seemed to react the way she expected during their conversations.Even if shed been willing to consideranythingwith him, it was a moot point.He wasnt on the list.End of story.Aileen picked up the paper, a tiny line appearing between her brows as she looked it over.Take both the Marrow boy and Atcherberg off the list.I cant believe your father would stoop so low.Her green eyes flashed.Marrow just buried his third wife.And Atcherberg has a gambling problem that is already beggaring his family.She didnt ask how her mother knew these things.There was no point when she was, in all reality, most likely right.Carrigan fought back a sigh.Then my potential list is down from six to three.After today it would shrink even further.She looked at her mother, all the things she couldnt say pressed against the inside of her lips.Please dont make me do this.Please dont make me marry some stranger to further the familys interests.Please, please, please.It was a little girls cry into the dark, begging the monster not to be real.If Aileen saw what she was thinkingand the way she pressed her lips together said she sure as hell didshe ignored it.She set the list back on Carrigans bed.That will make things simpler.Now, this wasnt why I came looking for you.She straightened and smoothed her hands over her perfectly pressed green dress.You havent been in to get the final fitting for your bridesmaids dress yet.The wedding.Of course.She should have known it wasnt concern for her well being that had her mother searching her out.These days everything seemed to boil down to Teague and Callies wedding.Im surprised you need me in there at all.Dont you know our measurements by heart?Carrigan, dont be cheeky.The wedding is a little over a week away.Make it a priority.I wont have you in an ill fitting dress.Since the wedding was more about what her mother wanted than what Callie wanted, shed take it as a personal insult if Carrigan didnt do exactly as instructed.She glanced at the clock beside her bed.Itll have to be this afternoon, then.Shed take care of it after her date with Dmitri.See that it is.Aileen nodded, turned on her heel, and marched out of the room.Probably off to terrify one of Carrigans other siblings.They all loved their mother, but she was almost scarier than their father was.She never seemed to be involved with his darker decisions, but anyone who believed that wasnt looking hard enough.She might not take part in the business publicly, but she stood as their fathers partner in every way that counted.Carrigan pushed to her feet and headed to get ready.Shed barely started her makeup process when her treacherous mind wandered back to James.What had he been up to this week?Was he grinning and feeling superior because he got what every man seemed to want from her?She shook her head.No, that wasnt James.Maybe she was naive, but very little hed done to date could be grouped in with other men.He played by rules that she didnt understand, and when he looked at her with those blue eyes, she was tempted to throw caution to the wind and do whatever it took to spend a few more hours in his bed.Which would be a nice change of pace, because they hadnt actually made it to a bed yet.But it simply wasnt possible.His words from last night rolled over her again.Every date you go on is going to be tightening the noose around your neck.Call me.Ill be there.He would, too.Hed more than proven that since she got back into town.She paused in the middle of swiping mascara over her lashes, her gaze landing on the phone next to her on the counter.She could call him right now.Would he drop everything and come get her?Maybe rev up the engine of that car of his and take her anywhere she wanted to go?Before she could talk herself out of it, she snatched up her phone and dialed.Carrigan held her breath as it rang, telling herself that this was dangerous and stupid and half a million other things that all added up to a terrible idea.It didnt matter.All that mattered was the unexpected lifeline hed offered her.The phone rang.And rang.And rang.It clicked over to voice mail, and she was so shocked, she almost didnt hang up before it got to the beep.Carrigan stared at her phone, half convinced that it had malfunctioned on her end.She carefully set it down and forced herself to see the truth.All that night had been was pretty words.When it came down to the wire, she couldnt lean on James.Shed forgotten that for a moment.She wouldnt forget again.*** James ignored the buzzing of his phone in his pocket as he carefully rolled up his sleeves.You know why were here, Joe.The big black guy raised his chin, but his nostrils were flared and too much white showed around his eyes.He was fifteen seconds away from pissing himself in fear.Good.Hopefully this shit wouldnt have to go to extremes for James to get the information he wanted.He finished his right sleeve and started on his left.Rickys been taking meetings without my permission.He needed to know exactly who hed talked to, and his little brother wasnt talking.Youll have to take that up with him.He should.Fuck, he knew he should.But a part of James was still unwilling to go that final distance and bring torturing information out of his little brother to the table.Call him crazy, but that seemed like a line that, once crossed, hed never be able to find his way back over again.His thoughts took a hard right turn and settled on Carrigan.What would she think of what he was about to do?Of what he was threatening to do to his own flesh and blood?Ricky would have hurt her.He would have done his damnedest to make her scream and he would have loved every second of it.He shook his head.Not helping.But if he could get Joe to talk, he could simplify his life.Im taking it up with you.He moved to the table Michael had set up next to where the man was tied to a chair in the center of the room.The harsh light directly above Joes head was positioned in such a way that he was partially blinded, and most of the rest of the room was in shadows.Victor Halloran knew a whole hell of a lot about intimidation tacticshe liked to say that half the interrogation session happened before he ever laid hands on his victim.James fought back a shudder.He could shout that he wasnt his old man until he was hoarse, but the proof was in his actions.He picked up a set of pliers.These dont look like much.Most houses on this street have a set or two.He stepped up close to Joe, letting him get a look at the rusted metal.My old man didnt take good care of his tools, but he loved the shit out of them.Would you like to see what he taught me?Joes entire body went tense, his gaze glued to the pliers.Look, man, you really need to talk to Ricky.I was just following orders.His orders.James turned the pliers, picking a piece of something he really didnt want to think about off the tip and flicking it at the other man.You should be following mine.We didnt think you were going to step up.The words were barely more than a whisper.Ricky talks a good game, and he gets shit done.Shit that didnt do the Hallorans a single bit of good.But this man didnt see thatand neither did the others who followed his little brother.All they saw were the actions.Not the consequences.He couldnt say that aloud, though.The second he tried to reason with these men was the moment he lost them completely.Theyd proven time and time again that they didnt respect anything but brutal violence.Love or fear.Thats the only way.Love would never be enough.It didnt matter what he did, or how well he took care of the people in their territory, or how much their legal businesses had increased in the last few months since hed taken the reins.Nothing mattered but becoming a monster even the monsters feared.It was the only way to keep them in line.Fine.Hed give Joe his goddamn fear.Who runs the Hallorans, Joe?Despite trying to muscle every single emotion down to where he could lock it away for what he needed to do next, he sounded so goddamn tired.The man in the chair started to sweat.You do, boss.Too little, too late.He moved closer, his feet feeling like they weighed a thousand pounds.Me, Joe.Not my brother.You learned that lesson a little too late.He forced the mans fingers apart.But you wont forget it again.An hour later it was done.James walked out of the room, his skin feeling too tight.Fuck, fuck, fuck.He stopped next to where Michael leaned against the wall, a toothpick in his mouth.Get him cleaned up and home.He can figure out how to splint the fingers himself.The words were foul in his mouth, and he had to resist the urge to spit.Sure thing, boss.Michael pushed off and took two steps before he stopped.You did the right thing.Thats what he was afraid of.Once upon a time thered been a right and a wrong and a clear line between them.Now everything was upside down and backward.He lived in a reality where torturing a man was the right thing to dothe lesser of two evilsand hed never hated himself as much as he did in that moment.But there was no getting off this crazy trainthe doors had closed and theyd left the station.The only thing to do was ride it out to its conclusion and hope there were enough people left standing to make the whole thing worthwhile.He wanted to talk to Carrigan.Just being around her was enough to hold all the shit he didnt want to deal with at bay, but he couldnt bring himself to call her with another mans blood on his hands and his cries for mercy still ringing in Jamess ears.No, hed shower, go down to the weight room, and then shower again.Maybe if he punished his body enough, hed be able to bear the new stain on his soul.Twelve Cillian sat across from his father and oldest brother, waiting for the guillotine blade to fall.He damn well knew that theyd been waiting these last four months for him to pull himself out of his spiral and step into the slot theyd created for him.The family bookkeeper had been making noises about retiring for over a year now, and it was finally time for Cillian to go through the necessary training to bring him up to speed so he could take over.Once upon a time, he hadnt cared about the future.Hed known where his place would be, and hed been content with thatas long as he got to experience as much as he possibly could before he was forced to take up the mantle of family responsibility.It was never something he railed against like his brother Teague, because he actually liked the work hed be doing.But he was having a hell of a time getting excited about itgetting excited about anythingnow.His father sat behind his massive desk, and Cillian couldnt help thinking he looked small.Seamus OMalley had always been larger than life, but the events of the last few months had affected him just as much as they had every other member of their family.There were new lines on his face, and his shoulders bowed as if carrying the weight of the world.For the first time in living memory, he looked old.Not that anyone had the balls to point it out.Seamus steepled his hands.Enough is enough.Ah.They werent here to talk to him about stepping up to be the bookkeeper.This was about Devlin.Cillian sat back and stretched his legs out, crossing them at his ankles.They could do this now, but he wasnt about to make it easy on them.Im not the only one whos walking wounded, but Im the easiest to focus on.Maybe it was better this way.
