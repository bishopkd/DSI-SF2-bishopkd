My breath left me in a rush.I hadnt expected that.He was a man who wanted no complications with his sex and I was a woman who found sex complicated, but he wasnt giving up.Yet.We need to be friendly, Gideon.Not best buds or confidants, but two people who know more about each other than their anatomy.To me, that means we have to spend time together when were not actively fucking.And Im afraid well have to spend time not actively fucking in places where were forced to restrain ourselves.Isnt that what were doing now?Yes.And see, thats what I mean.I wasnt giving you credit for that.You shouldve done it in a less creepy manner I covered his lips with my fingers when he tried to cut me off but I admit you did try to set up a time to talk and I wasnt helpful.He nipped my fingers with his teeth, making me yelp and yank my hand away.Hey.What was that for?He lifted my abused hand to his mouth and kissed the hurt, his tongue darting out to soothe.And incite.In self defense, I tugged my hand back to my lap.I still wasnt completely confident that wed worked things out.Just so you know there are no exaggerated expectations when you and I spend time together not actively fucking, I wont think its a date.All right?That covers it.Gideon smiled and my decision to be with him solidified for me.His smile was like lightning in the darkness, blinding and beautiful and mysterious, and I wanted him so badly it was physically painful.His hands slid down to cup the backs of my thighs.Squeezing gently, he tugged me just a little bit closer.The hem of my short black halter dress slipped almost indecently high and his gaze was riveted to the flesh hed exposed.His tongue wet his lips in an action so carnal and suggestive I could almost feel the caress on my skin.Duffy began begging for mercy, her voice drifting up from the dance floor below.An unwelcome ache developed in my chest and I rubbed at it.Id already had enough, but I heard myself saying, I need another drink.5  I had a vicious hangover on Saturday morning and figured it was no less than I deserved.As much as Id resented Gideons insistence on negotiating sex with as much passion as he would a merger, in the end Id negotiated in kind.Because I wanted him enough to take a calculated risk and break my own rules.I took comfort in knowing he was breaking some of his own, too.After a long, hot shower, I made my way into the living room and found Cary on the couch with his netbook, looking fresh and alert.Smelling coffee in the kitchen, I headed there and filled the biggest mug I could find.Morning, sunshine, Cary called out.With my much needed dose of caffeine wrapped between both palms, I joined him on the couch.He pointed at a box on the end table.That came for you while you were in the shower.I set my mug on the coffee table and picked up the box.It was wrapped with brown paper and twine, and had my name handwritten diagonally across the top with a decorative calligraphic flourish.Inside was an amber glass bottle with Hangover Cure painted on it in a white old fashioned font and a note tied with raffia to the bottles neck that said, Drink me.Gideons business card was nestled in the cushioning tissue paper.As I studied the gift, I found it very apt.Since meeting Gideon Id felt like Id fallen down the rabbit hole into a fascinating and seductive world where few of the known rules applied.I was in uncharted territory that was both exciting and scary.I glanced at Cary, who eyed the bottle dubiously.Cheers.I pried the cork out and drank the contents without thinking twice about it.It tasted like sickly sweet cough syrup.My stomach quivered in distaste for a moment, and then heated.I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and shoved the cork back into the empty bottle.What was that?Cary asked.From the burn, its hair of the dog.His nose wrinkled.Effective but unpleasant.And it was working.I already felt a little steadier.Cary picked up the box and dug out Gideons card.He flipped it over; then held it out to me.On the back Gideon had written, Call me in bold slashing penmanship and jotted down a number.I took the card, curling my hand around it.His gift was proof that he was thinking about me.His tenacity and focus was seductive.And flattering.There was no denying I was in trouble where Gideon was concerned.I craved the way I felt when he touched me, and I loved the way he responded when I touched him back.When I tried to think of what I wouldnt agree to do to have his hands on me again, I couldnt come up with much.When Cary tried to hand me the phone, I shook my head.Not yet.I need a clear head when dealing with him and Im still fuzzy.You two seemed cozy last night.Hes definitely into you.Im definitely into him.Curling into the corner of the couch, I pressed my cheek into the cushion and hugged my legs to my chest.Were going to hang out, get to know each other, have casual but physically intense sex, and be otherwise completely independent.No strings, no expectations, no responsibilities.Cary hit a button on his netbook and the printer on the other side of the room started spitting out pages.Then he snapped the computer closed, set it on the coffee table, and gave me all his attention.Maybe itll turn into something serious.Maybe not, I scoffed.Cynic.Im not looking for happily ever after, Cary, especially not with a mega mogul like Cross.Ive seen what its like for my mom being connected to powerful men.Its a full time job with a part time companion.Money keeps Mom happy, but it wouldnt be enough for me.My dad had loved my mom.Hed asked her to marry him and share his life.Shed turned him down because he didnt have the hefty portfolio and sizeable bank account she required in a husband.Love wasnt a requisite for marriage in Monica Stantons opinion and since her sultry eyed, breathy voiced beauty was irresistible to most men, shed never had to settle for less than whatever she wanted.Unfortunately she hadnt wanted my dad for the long haul.Glancing at the clock, I saw it was ten thirty.I guess I should get ready.I love spa day with your mom.Cary smiled and it chased the lingering shadows on my mood away.I feel like a god when were done.Me, too.Of the goddess persuasion.We were so eager to be off that we went downstairs to meet the car rather than wait for the front desk to call up.The doorman smiled as we stepped outside me in heeled sandals and a maxi dress, and Cary in hip hugging jeans and a long sleeved T shirt.Good morning, Miss Tramell.Mr.Taylor.Will you need a cab today?No thanks, Paul.Were expecting a car.Cary grinned.Its spa day at Perrinis!Ah, Perrinis Day Spa.Paul gave a sage nod.I bought my wife a gift certificate for our anniversary.She enjoyed it so much I plan to make it a tradition.You did good, Paul, I said.Pampering a woman never goes out of style.A black town car pulled up with Clancy at the wheel.Paul opened the rear door for us and we climbed in, squealing when we found a box of Knipschildts Chocopologie on the seat.Waving at Paul, we settled back and dug in, taking tiny nibbles of the truffles that were worth savoring slowly.Clancy drove us straight to Perrinis, where the relaxation began from the moment one walked in the door.Crossing the entrance threshold was like taking a vacation on the far side of the world.Every arched doorway was framed by lushly vibrant striped silks, while jeweled pillows decorated elegant chaises and oversized armchairs.Birds chirped from suspended gilded cages and potted plants filled every corner with lush fronds.Small decorative fountains added the sounds of running water, while stringed instrumental music was piped into the room via cleverly hidden speakers.The air was redolent with a mix of exotic spices and fragrances, making me feel like Id stepped into Arabian Nights.It was this close to being too much, but it didnt cross the line.Instead, Perrinis was exotic and luxurious, an indulgent treat for those who could afford it.Like my mother, whod just finished a milk and honey bath when we arrived.I studied the menu of treatments available, deciding to skip my usual warrior woman in favor of the passionate pampering.Id been waxed the week before, but the rest of the treatment designed to make you sexually irresistible sounded like exactly what I needed.Id finally managed to get my mind back into the safe zone of work when Cary spoke up from the pedicure chair beside mine.Mrs.Stanton, have you met Gideon Cross?I gaped at him.He knew damn well my mom went nuts over any news about my romantic and not so romantic, as the case may be relationships.My mother, who sat in the chair on the other side of me, leaned forward with her usual girlish excitement over a rich, handsome man.Of course.Hes one of the wealthiest men in the world.Number twenty five or so on Forbess list, if Im remembering correctly.A very driven young man, obviously, and a generous benefactor to many of the childrens charities I champion.Extremely eligible, of course, but I dont believe hes gay, Cary.Hes got a reputation as a ladies man.My loss.Cary grinned and ignored my violent headshaking.But itd be a hopeless crush anyway, since hes digging on Eva.Eva!I cant believe you didnt say anything.How could you not tell me something like that?I looked at my mom, whose scrubbed face appeared young, unlined, and very much like mine.I was very clearly my mothers daughter, right down to my surname.The one concession shed made to my father had been to name me after his mother.Theres nothing to tell, I insisted.Were justfriends.We can do better than that, Monica said, with a look of calculation that struck fear in my heart.I dont know how it escaped me that you work in the same building he does.Im certain he was smitten the moment he saw you.Although hes known to prefer brunettesHmmAnyway.Hes also known for his excellent taste.Clearly the latter won out with you.Its not like that.Please dont start meddling.Youll embarrass me.Nonsense.If anyone knows what to do with men, its me.I cringed, my shoulders creeping up to my ears.By the time my massage appointment came around, I was in desperate need of one.I stretched out on the table and closed my eyes, preparing to take a catnap to get through the long night ahead.I loved dressing up and looking pretty as much as the next girl, but charity functions were a lot of work.Making small talk was exhausting, smiling nonstop was a pain, and conversations about businesses and people I didnt know were boring.If it wasnt for Cary benefitting from the exposure, Id put up a bigger fight about going.I sighed.Who was I fooling?Id end up going anyway.My mom and Stanton supported abused childrens charities because they were significant to me.Going to the occasional stuffy event was a small price to pay for the return.Taking a deep breath, I consciously relaxed.I made a mental note to call my dad when I got home and thought about how to send a thank you note to Gideon for the hangover cure.I supposed I could e mail him using the contact info on his business card, but that lacked class.Besides, I didnt know who read his inbox.Id just call him when I got home.Why not?Hed asked no, told me to; hed written the demand on his business card.And Id get to hear his luscious voice again.The door opened and the masseuse came in.Hello, Eva.You ready?Not quite.But I was getting there.After many lovely hours at the spa, my mom and Cary dropped me off at the apartment; then they headed out to hunt for new cuff links for Stanton.I used the time alone to call Gideon.Even with the much needed privacy, I punched most of his phone number into the keypad a half dozen times before I finally put the call through.He answered on the first ring.Eva.Startled that hed known who was calling, my mind scrambled for a moment.How did he have my name and number in his contact list?Uhhi, Gideon.Im a block away.Let the front desk know Im coming.What?I felt like Id missed part of the conversation.Coming where?To your place.Im rounding the corner now.Call the desk, Eva.He hung up and I stared at the phone, trying to absorb the fact that Gideon was moments away from being with me again.Somewhat dazed, I went to the intercom and talked to the front desk, letting them know I was expecting him and while I was talking, he walked into the lobby.A few moments after that, he was at my door.It was then that I remembered I was dressed in only a thigh length silk robe, and my face and hair were styled for the dinner.What kind of impression would he get from my appearance?I tightened the belt of my robe before I let him in.It wasnt like Id invited him over for a seduction or anything.Gideon stood in the hallway for a long moment, his gaze raking me from my head down to my French manicured toes.I was equally stunned by his appearance.The way he looked in worn jeans and a T shirt made me want to undress him with my teeth.Worth the trip to find you like this, Eva.He stepped inside and locked the door behind him.How are you feeling?Good.Thanks to you.Thank you.My stomach quivered because he was here, with me, which made me feel almostgiddy.That cant be why you came over.Im here because it took you too long to call me.I didnt realize I had a deadline.I have to ask you something time sensitive, but more than that, I wanted to know if you were feeling all right after last night.His eyes were dark as they swept over me, his breathtaking face framed by that luxurious curtain of inky hair.God.You look beautiful, Eva.I cant remember ever wanting anything this much.With just those few simple words I became hot and needy.Way too vulnerable.Whats so urgent?Go with me to the advocacy center dinner tonight.I pulled back, surprised and excited by the request.Youre going?So are you.I checked, knowing your mother would be there.Lets go together.My hand went to my throat, my mind torn between the weirdness of how much he knew about me and concern over what he was asking me to do.Thats not what I meant when I said we should spend time together.Why not?The simple question was laced with challenge.Whats the problem with going together to an event wed already planned on attending separately?Its not very discreet.Its a high profile event.So?Gideon stepped closer and fingered a curl of my hair.There was a dangerous purr to his voice that sent a shiver through me.I could feel the warmth of his big, hard body and smell the richly masculine scent of his skin.I was falling under his spell, deeper with every minute that passed.People will make assumptions, my mother in particular.Shes already scenting your bachelor blood in the water.Lowering his head, Gideon pressed his lips into the crook of my neck.I dont care what people think.We know what were doing.And Ill deal with your mother.If you think you can, I said breathlessly, you dont know her very well.Ill pick you up at seven.His tongue traced the wildly throbbing vein in my throat and I melted into him, my body going lax as he pulled me close.Still, I managed to say, I havent said yes.But you wont say no.He caught my earlobe between his teeth.I wont let you.I opened my mouth to protest and he sealed his lips over mine, shutting me up with a lush wet kiss.His tongue did that slow, savoring licking that made me long to feel him doing the same between my legs.My hands went to his hair, sliding through it, tugging.When he wrapped his arms around me, I arched, curving into his hands.Just as he had in his office, he had me on my back on the couch before I realized he was moving me, his mouth swallowing my surprised gasp.The robe gave way to his dexterous fingers; then he was cupping my breasts, kneading them with soft, rhythmic squeezes.Gideon   Shh.He sucked on my lower lip, his fingers rolling and tugging my tender nipples.It was driving me crazy knowing you were naked beneath your robe.You came over without Oh!Oh, God  His mouth surrounded the tip of my breast, the wash of heat bringing a mist of perspiration to my skin.My gaze darted frantically to the clock on the cable box.Gideon, no.His head lifted and he looked at me with stormy blue eyes.Its insane, I know.I dont I cant explain it, Eva, but I have to make you come.Ive been thinking about it constantly for days now.One of his hands pushed between my legs.They fell open shamelessly, my body so aroused I was flushed and almost feverish.His other hand continued to plump my breasts, making them heavy and unbearably sensitive.Youre wet for me, he murmured, his gaze sliding down my body to where he was parting me with his fingers.Youre beautiful here, too.Plush and pink.So soft.You didnt wax today, did you?I shook my head.Thank God.I dont think I wouldve made it ten minutes without touching you, let alone ten hours.He slid one finger carefully into me.My eyes closed against the unbearable vulnerability of being spread out naked and fingered by a man whose familiarity with the rules of Brazilian waxing betrayed an intimate knowledge of women.A man who was still fully clothed and kneeling on the floor beside me.Youre so snug.Gideon pulled out and thrust gently back into me.My back bowed as I clenched eagerly around him.And so greedy.How long has it been since the last time you were fucked?I swallowed hard.Ive been busy.My thesis, job hunting, moving  A while, then.He pulled out and pushed back into me with two fingers.I couldnt hold back a moan of delight.The man had talented hands, confident and skilled, and he took what he wanted with them.Are you on birth control, Eva?Yes.My hands gripped the edges of the cushions.Of course.Ill prove Im clean and youll do the same, then youre going to let me come in you.Jesus, Gideon.I was panting for him, my hips circling shamelessly onto his thrusting fingers.I felt like Id spontaneously combust if he didnt get me off.Id never been so turned on in my life.I was near mindless with the need for an orgasm.If Cary walked in right then and found me writhing in our living room while Gideon finger fucked me, I didnt think Id care.Gideon was breathing hard, too.His face was flushed with lust.For me.When Id done nothing more than respond helplessly to him.His hand at my breast moved to my cheek and brushed over it.Youre blushing.Ive scandalized you.Yes.His smile was both wicked and delighted, and it made my chest tight.I want to feel my cum in you when I fuck you with my fingers.I want you to feel my cum in you, so you think about how I looked and the sounds I made when I pumped it into you.And while youre thinking about that, youre going to look forward to me doing it again and again.My sex rippled around his stroking fingers, the rawness of his words pushing me to the brink of orgasm.Im going to tell you all the ways I want you to please me, Eva, and youre going to do it alltake it all, and were going to have explosive, primal, no holds barred sex.You know that, dont you?You can feel how itll be between us.Yes, I breathed, clutching my breasts to ease the deep ache of my hardened nipples.Please, Gideon.ShhIve got you.The pad of his thumb rubbed my clitoris in gentle circles.Look into my eyes when you come for me.Everything tightened in my core, the tension building as he massaged my clit and pushed his fingers in and out in a steady, unhurried rhythm.Give it up to me, Eva, he ordered.Now.I climaxed with a thready cry, my grip white knuckled on the sides of the cushions as my hips pumped onto his hand, my mind far beyond shame or shyness.My gaze was locked to his, unable to look away, riveted by the fierce masculine triumph that flared in his eyes.In that moment he owned me.Id do anything he wanted.And he knew it.Searing pleasure pulsed through me.Through the roaring of blood in my ears, I thought I heard him speak hoarsely, but I lost the words when he hooked one of my legs over the back of the couch and covered my cleft with his mouth.No  I pushed at his head with my hands.I cant.I was too swollen, too sensitive.But when his tongue touched my clit, fluttering over it, the hunger built again.More intense than the first time.He rimmed my trembling slit, teasing me, taunting me with the promise of another orgasm when I knew I couldnt have one again so quickly.Then his tongue speared into me and I bit my lip to bite back a scream.I came a second time, my body quaking violently, tender muscles tightening desperately around his decadent licking.His growl vibrated through me.I didnt have the strength to push him away when he returned to my clit and sucked softlytirelesslyuntil I climaxed again, gasping his name.I was boneless as he straightened my leg and still breathless when he pressed kisses up my belly to my breasts.He licked each of my nipples, and then hauled me up with his arms banded around my back.I hung lax and pliable in his grip while he took my mouth with suppressed violence, bruising my lips and betraying how close to the edge he was.He closed my robe; then stood, staring down at me.Gideon?Seven oclock, Eva.He reached down and touched my ankle, his fingertips caressing the diamond anklet Id put on in preparation for the evening.And keep this on.I want to fuck you while youre wearing nothing else.6  Hey, Dad.I caught you.I adjusted my grip on the phone receiver and pulled up a stool at the breakfast bar.I missed my father.For the last four years wed lived close enough to see each other at least once a week.Now his home in Oceanside was the entire country away.How are you?He lowered the volume on the television.Better, now that youve called.How was your first week at work?I went over my days from Monday through Friday, skipping over all the Gideon parts.I really like my boss, Mark, I finished.And the vibe of the agency is very energetic and kind of quirky.Im happy going to work every day, and Im bummed when its time to go home.I hope it stays that way.But you need to make sure you have some downtime, too.Go out, be young, have fun.But not too much fun.Yeah, I had a little too much last night.Cary and I went clubbing, and I woke up with a mean hangover.Shit, dont tell me that.He groaned.Some nights I wake up in a cold sweat thinking about you in New York.I get through it by telling myself youre too smart to take chances, thanks to two parents whove drilled safety rules into your DNA.Which is true, I said, laughing.That reminds meIm going to start Krav Maga training.Really?There was a thoughtful pause.One of the guys on the force is big on it.Maybe Ill check it out and we can compare notes when I come out to visit you.Youre coming to New York?I couldnt hide my excitement.Oh, Dad, Id love it if you would.As much as I miss SoCal, Manhattan is really awesome.I think youll like it.Id like anyplace in the world as long as youre there.He waited a beat, then asked, Hows your mom?Wellshes Mom.Beautiful, charming, and obsessive compulsive.My chest hurt and I rubbed at it.I thought my dad might still love my mom.Hed never married.That was one of the reasons I never told him about what happened to me.As a cop, he wouldve insisted on pressing charges and the scandal would have destroyed my mother.I also worried that hed lose respect for her or even blame her, and it hadnt been her fault.As soon as shed found out what her stepson was doing to me, shed left a husband she was happy with and filed for divorce.I kept talking, waving at Cary as he came rushing in with a little blue Tiffany & Co.bag.We had a spa day today.It was a fun way to cap off the week.I could hear the smile in his voice when he said, Im glad you two are managing to spend time together.What are your plans for the rest of the weekend?I hedged on the subject of the charity event, knowing the whole red carpet business and astronomically priced dinner seats would just highlight the gap between my parents lives.Cary and I are going out to eat, and then I plan on staying in tomorrow.Sleeping in late, hanging out in my pajamas all day, maybe some movies and food delivery of some sort.A little vegetating before a new work week kicks off.Sounds like heaven to me.I may copy you when my next day off rolls around.Glancing at the clock, I saw it was creeping past six.I have to get ready now.Be careful at work, okay?I worry about you, too.Will do.Bye, baby.The familiar sign off had me missing him so much my throat hurt.Oh, wait!Im getting a new cell phone.Ill text you the number as soon as I have it.Again?You just got a new one when you moved.Long, boring story.HmmDont put it off.Theyre good for safety as well as playing Angry Birds.Im over that game!I laughed and warmth spread through me to hear him laughing, too.Ill call you in a few days.Be good.Thats my line.We hung up.I sat for a few moments in the ensuing silence, feeling like everything was right in my world, which never lasted long.I brooded on that for minute; then Cary cranked up Hinder on his bedroom stereo and that kicked my butt into gear.I hurried to my room to get ready for a night with Gideon.Necklace or no necklace?I asked Cary, when he came into my bedroom looking seriously amazing.Dressed in his new Brioni tux, he was both debonair and dashing, and certain to attract attention.Hmm.His head tilted to the side as he studied me.Hold it up again.I lifted the choker of gold coins to my throat.The dress my mom had sent was fire engine red and styled for a Grecian goddess.It hung on one shoulder, cut diagonally across my cleavage, had ruching to the hip, and then split at my right upper thigh all the way down my leg.There was no back to speak of, aside from a slender strip of rhinestones that connected one side to the other to keep the front from falling off.Otherwise, the back was bared to just above the crack of my buttocks in a racy V cut.Forget the necklace, he said.I was leaning toward gold chandeliers, but now Im thinking diamond hoops.The biggest ones youve got.What?Really?I frowned at our reflections in my cheval mirror, watching as he moved to my jewelry box and dug through it.These.He brought them to me and I eyed the two inch hoops my mother had given me for my eighteenth birthday.Trust me, Eva.Try em on.I did and found he was right.It was a very different look from the gold choker, less glam and more edgy sensuality.And the earrings went well with the diamond anklet on my right leg that Id never think of the same way again after Gideons comment.With my hair swept off my face into a cascade of thick, deliberately messy curls, I had a just screwed look that was complemented by smoky eye shadow and glossy nude lips.What would I do without you, Cary Taylor?Baby girl he set his hands on my shoulders and pressed his cheek to mine youll never find out.You look awesome, by the way.Dont I?He winked and stepped back, showing off.In his own way, Cary could give Gideon a run for his moneyer, looks.Cary was more finely featured, almost pretty compared to Gideons savage beauty, but both were striking men that made you look twice, and then stare in greedy delight.Cary hadnt been quite so perfect when I met him.Hed been strung out and gaunt, his emerald eyes cloudy and lost.But Id been drawn to him, going out of my way to sit next to him in group therapy.Hed finally propositioned me crudely, having come to believe the only reason people associated with him was because they wanted to fuck him.It was when I declined, firmly and irrevocably, that we finally connected and became best friends.He was the brother Id never had.The intercom buzzed and I jumped, making me realize how nervous I was.I looked at Cary.I forgot to tell the front desk he was coming back.Ill get him.Are you going to be okay riding over with Stanton and my mom?Are you kidding?They love me.His smile dimmed.Having second thoughts about going with Cross?I took a deep breath, remembering where Id been earlier on my back in a multi orgasmic daze.Not really, no.Its just that everythings happening so fast and going better than I expected or realized I wanted  Youre wondering what the catch is.Reaching out, he tapped my nose with his fingertip.Hes the catch, Eva.And you landed him.Enjoy yourself.Im trying.I was grateful that Cary understood me and the way my mind worked.It was just so easy being with him, knowing he could fill in the blanks when I couldnt explain something.I researched the hell out of him this morning and printed out the interesting recent stuff.Its on your desk, if you decide you want to check it out.I remembered him printing something before we got ready for the spa.Pushing onto my tiptoes, I kissed his cheek.Youre the best.I love you.Back atcha, baby girl.He headed out.Ill head down to the front desk and bring him up.Take your time.Hes ten minutes early.Smiling, I watched him saunter into the hallway.The door had closed behind him when I moved into the small sitting room attached to my bedroom.On the very impractical escritoire my mother had picked out, I found a folder filled with articles and printed images.I settled into the chair and got lost in Gideon Crosss history.It was like watching a train wreck to read that he was the son of Geoffrey Cross, former chairman of an investment securities firm later found to be a front for a massive Ponzi scheme.Gideon was just five years old when his dad committed suicide with a gunshot to the head rather than face prison time.Oh, Gideon.I tried to picture him that young and imagined a handsome dark haired boy with beautiful blue eyes filled with terrible confusion and sadness.The image broke my heart.How devastating his fathers suicide and the circumstances around it must have been, for both him and his mother.The stress and strain at such a difficult time wouldve been enormous, especially for a child of that age.His mother went on to marry Christopher Vidal, a music executive, and had two more children, Christopher Vidal Jr.and Ireland Vidal, but it seemed a larger family and financial security had come too late to help Gideon stabilize after such a huge shakeup.He was too closed off not to bear some painful emotional scars.With a critical and curious eye, I studied the women whod been photographed with Gideon and thought about his approach to dating, socializing, and sex.I saw that my mom had been right they were all brunettes.The woman who appeared with him most often bore the hallmarks of a Hispanic heritage.She was taller than me, willowy rather than curvy.Magdalene Perez, I murmured, grudgingly admitting that she was a stunner.Her posture had the kind of flamboyant confidence that I admired.Okay, its been long enough, Cary interrupted with a soft note of amusement.He filled the doorway to my sitting room, leaning insolently into the doorjamb.Really?Id been so absorbed; I hadnt realized how much time had passed.I would guess youre about a minute away from him coming to find you.Hes barely restraining himself.I shut the folder and stood.Interesting reading, isnt it?Very.How had Gideons father or more specifically, his fathers suicide influenced his life?I knew all the answers I wanted were waiting for me in the next room.Leaving my bedroom, I took the hallway to the living room.I paused on the threshold, my gaze riveted to Gideons back as he stood in front of the windows and looked out at the city.My heart rate kicked up.His reflection revealed a contemplative mood.His gaze was unfocused and his mouth grim.His crossed arms betrayed an inherent unease, as if he was out of his element.He looked remote and removed, a man who was inherently alone.He sensed my presence or maybe he felt my yearning.He pivoted; then went very still.I took the opportunity to drink him in, my gaze sliding all over him.He looked every inch the powerful magnate.So sensually handsome my eyes burned just from looking at him.The rakish fall of black hair around his face made my fingers flex with the urge to touch it.And the way he looked at memy pulse leaped.Eva.He came toward me, his stride graceful and strong.He caught up my hand and lifted it to his mouth.His gaze was intense intensely hot, intensely focused.The feel of his lips against my skin sent goose bumps racing up my arm and stirred memories of that sinful mouth on other parts of my body.I was instantly aroused.Hi.Amusement warmed his eyes.Hi, yourself.You look amazing.I cant wait to show you off.I breathed through the delight I felt at the compliment.Lets hope I can do you justice.A slight frown knit the space between his brows.Do you have everything you need?Cary appeared beside me, carrying my black velvet shawl and opera length gloves.Here you go.I tucked your gloss into your clutch.Youre the best, Cary.He winked at me which told me hed seen the condoms I had tucked into the small interior pocket.Ill head down with you two.Gideon took the shawl from Cary and draped it over my shoulders.He pulled my hair out from underneath it and the feel of his hands at my neck so distracted me, I barely paid attention when Cary pushed my gloves into my hands.The elevator ride to the lobby was an exercise in surviving acute sexual tension.Not that Cary seemed to notice.He was on my left with both hands in his pockets, whistling.Gideon, on the other hand, was a tremendous force on the other side of me.Although he didnt move or make a sound, I could feel the edgy energy radiating from him.My skin tingled from the magnetic pull between us, and my breath came short and fast.I was relieved when the doors opened and freed us from the enclosed space.Two women stood waiting to get on.Their jaws dropped when they saw Gideon and Cary, and that lightened my mood and made me smile.Ladies, Cary greeted them, with a smile that really wasnt fair.I could almost see their brain cells misfiring.In contrast, Gideon gave a curt nod and led me out with a hand at the small of my back, skin to skin.The contact was electric, sending heat pouring through me.I squeezed Carys hand.Save a dance for me.Always.See you in a bit.A limousine was waiting at the curb, and the driver opened the door when Gideon and I stepped outside.I slid across the bench seat to the opposite side and adjusted my gown.When Gideon settled beside me and the door shut, I became highly conscious of how good he smelled.I breathed him in, telling myself to relax and enjoy his company.He took my hand and ran his fingertips over the palm, the simple touch sparking a fierce lust.I shrugged off my shawl, feeling too hot to wear it.Eva.He hit a button and the privacy glass behind the driver began to slide up.The next moment I was tugged across his lap and his mouth was on mine, kissing me fiercely.I did what Id wanted to do since I saw him in my living room: I shoved my hands in his hair and kissed him back.I loved the way he kissed me, as if he had to, as if hed go crazy if he didnt and had nearly waited too long.I sucked on his tongue, having learned how much he liked it, having learned how much I liked it, how much it made me want to suck him elsewhere with the same eagerness.His hands were sliding over my bare back and I moaned, feeling the prod of his erection against my hip.I shifted, moving to straddle him, shoving the skirt of my gown out of the way and making a mental note to thank my mom for the dress which had such a convenient slit.With my knees on either side of his hips, I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and deepened the kiss.I licked into his mouth, nibbled on his lower lip, stroked my tongue along his  Gideon gripped my waist and pushed me away.He leaned into the seat back, his neck arched to look up at my face, his chest heaving.What are you doing to me?I ran my hands down his chest through his dress shirt, feeling the unforgiving hardness of his muscles.My fingers traced the ridges of his abdomen, my mind forming a picture of how he might look naked.Im touching you.Enjoying the hell out of you.I want you, Gideon.He caught my wrists, stilling my movements.Later.Were in the middle of Manhattan.No one can see us.Thats not the point.Its not the time or place to start something we cant finish for hours.Im losing my mind already from this afternoon.So lets make sure we finish it now.His grip tightened painfully.We cant do that here.Why not?Then a surprising thought struck me.Havent you ever had sex in a limo?No.His jaw hardened.Have you?Looking away without answering, I saw the traffic and pedestrians surging around us.We were only inches away from hundreds of people, but the dark glass concealed us and made me feel reckless.I wanted to please him.I wanted to know I was capable of reaching into Gideon Cross, and there was nothing to stop me but him.I rocked my hips against him, stroking myself with the hard length of his cock.His breath hissed out between clenched teeth.I need you, Gideon, I said breathlessly, inhaling his scent, which was richer now that he was aroused.I thought I might be slightly intoxicated, just from the enticing smell of his skin.You drive me crazy.He released my wrists and cupped my face, his lips pressing hard against mine.I reached for the fly of his slacks, freeing the two buttons to access the concealed zipper.He tensed.I need this, I whispered against his lips.Give me this.He didnt relax, but he made no further attempts to stop me either.When he fell heavily into my palms, he groaned, the sound both pained and erotic.I squeezed him gently, my touch deliberately tender as I sized him with my hands.He was so hard, like stone, and hot.I slid both of my fists up his length from root to tip, my breath catching when he quivered beneath me.Gideon gripped my thighs, his hands sliding upward beneath the edges of my dress until his thumbs found the red lace of my thong.Your cunt is so sweet, he murmured into my mouth.I want to spread you out and lick you til you beg for my cock.Ill beg now, if you want.I stroked him with one hand and reached for my clutch with the other, snapping it open to grab a condom.One of his thumbs slid beneath the edge of my panties, the pad sliding through the slickness of my desire.Ive barely touched you, he whispered, his eyes glittering up at me in the shadows of the backseat, and youre ready for me.I cant help it.I dont want you to help it.He pushed his thumb inside me, biting his lower lip when I clenched helplessly around him.It wouldnt be fair when I cant stop what you do to me.I ripped the foil packet open with my teeth and held it out to him with the ring of the condom protruding from the tear.Im not good with these.His hand curled around mine.Im breaking all my rules with you.The seriousness of his low tone sent a burst of warmth and confidence through me.Rules are made to be broken.I saw his teeth flash white; then he hit a button on the panel beside him and said, Drive until I say otherwise.My cheeks heated.Another cars headlights pierced the dark tinted glass and slid over my face, betraying my embarrassment.Why, Eva, he purred, rolling the condom on deftly.Youve seduced me into having sex in my limousine, but blush when I tell my driver I dont want to be interrupted while you do it to me?His sudden playfulness made me desperate to have him.Setting my hands on his shoulders for balance, I lifted onto my knees, rising to gain the height I needed to hover over the crown of Gideons thick cock.His hands fisted at my hips and I heard a snap as he tore my panties away.The abrupt sound and the violent action behind it spurred my desire to a fever pitch.Go slow, he ordered hoarsely, lifting his hips to push his pants down farther.His erection brushed between my legs as he moved and I whimpered, so aching and empty, as if the orgasms hed given me earlier had only deepened my craving rather than appeased it.He tensed when I wrapped my fingers around him and positioned him, tucking the wide crest against the saturated folds of my cleft.The scent of our lust was heavy and humid in the air, a seductive mix of need and pheromones that awakened every cell in my body.My skin was flushed and tingling, my breasts heavy and tender.This is what Id wanted from the moment I first saw him to possess him, to climb up his magnificent body and take him deep inside me.God.Eva, he gasped as I lowered onto him, his hands flexing restlessly on my thighs.I closed my eyes, feeling too exposed.Id wanted intimacy with him and yet this seemed too intimate.We were eye to eye, only inches apart, cocooned in a small space with the rest of the world streaming by around us.I could sense his agitation, knew he was feeling as off center as I was.Youre so tight.His gasped words were threaded with a hint of delicious agony.I took more of him, letting him slide deeper.I sucked in a deep breath, feeling exquisitely stretched.Youre so big.Pressing his palm flat to my lower belly, he touched my throbbing clit with the pad of his thumb and began to massage it in slow, expertly soft circles.Everything in my core tightened and clenched, sucking him deeper.Opening my eyes, I looked at him from under heavy eyelids.He was so beautiful sprawled beneath me in his elegant tuxedo, his powerful body straining with the primal need to mate.His neck arched, his head pressing hard into the seatback as if he was struggling against invisible bonds.Ah, Christ, he bit out, his teeth grinding.Im going to come so hard.The dark promise excited me.Sweat misted my skin.I became so wet and hot that I slid smoothly down the length of his cock until Id nearly sheathed him.A breathless cry escaped me before Id taken him to the root.He was so deep I could hardly stand it, forcing me to shift from side to side, trying to ease the unexpected bite of discomfort.But my body didnt seem to care that he was too big.It was rippling around him, squeezing, trembling on the verge of orgasm.Gideon cursed and gripped my hip with his free hand, urging me to lean backward as his chest heaved with frantic breaths.The position altered my descent and I opened, accepting all of him.Immediately his body temperature rose, his torso radiating sultry heat through his clothes.Sweat dotted his upper lip.Leaning forward, I slid my tongue along the sculpted curve, collecting the saltiness with a low murmur of delight.His hips churned impatiently.I lifted carefully, sliding up a few inches before he stopped me with that ferocious grasp on my hip.Slow, he warned again, with an authoritative bite that sent lust pulsing through me.I lowered, taking him into me again, feeling an oddly luscious soreness as he pushed just past my limits.Our eyes locked on each other as the pleasure spread from the place where we connected.It struck me then that we were both fully clothed except for the most private and intimate parts of our bodies.I found that excruciatingly carnal, as were the sounds he made, as if the pleasure was as extreme for him as it was for me.Wild for him, I pressed my mouth to his, my fingers gripping the sweat damp roots of his hair.I kissed him as I rocked my hips, riding the maddening circling of his thumb, feeling the orgasm building with every slide of his long, thick penis into my melting core.I lost my mind somewhere along the way, primitive instinct taking over until my body was completely in charge.I could focus on nothing but the driving urge to fuck, the ferocious need to ride his cock until the tension burst and set me free of this grinding hunger.Its so good, I sobbed, lost to him.You feelAh, God, its too good.Using both hands, Gideon commanded my rhythm, tilting me into an angle that had the big crown of his cock rubbing a tender, aching spot inside me.As I tightened and shook, I realized I was going to come from that, just from the expert thrust of him inside me.Gideon.He captured me by the nape as the orgasm exploded through me, starting with the ecstatic spasms of my core and radiating outward until I was trembling all over.He watched me fall apart, holding my gaze when I wouldve closed my eyes.Possessed by his stare, I moaned and came harder than I ever had, my body jerking with every pulse of pleasure.Fuck, fuck, fuck, he growled, pounding his hips up at me, yanking my hips down to meet his punishing lunges.He hit the end of me with every deep thrust, battering into me.I could feel him growing harder and thicker.I watched him avidly, needing to see it when he went over the edge for me.His eyes were wild with his need, losing their focus as his control frayed, his gorgeous face ravaged by the brutal race to climax.Eva!He came with an animal sound of feral ecstasy, a snarling release that riveted me with its ferocity.He shook as the orgasm tore into him, his features softening for an instant with an unexpected vulnerability.Cupping his face, I brushed my lips across his, comforting him as the forceful bursts of his gasping breaths struck my cheeks.Eva.He wrapped his arms around me and crushed me to him, pressing his damp face into the curve of my neck.I knew just how he felt.Stripped.Laid bare.We stayed like that for a long time, holding each other, absorbing the aftershocks.He turned his head and kissed me softly, the strokes of his tongue into my mouth soothing my ragged emotions.Wow, I breathed, shaken.His mouth twitched.Yeah.I smiled, feeling dazed and high.Gideon brushed the damp tendrils of hair off my temples, his fingertips gliding almost reverently across my face.The way he studied me made my chest hurt.He looked stunned andgrateful, his eyes warm and tender.I dont want to break this moment.Because I could hear it hanging in the air, I filled it in.But?But I cant blow off this dinner.I have a speech to give.Oh.The moment was effectively broken.I lifted gingerly off of him, biting my lip at the feel of him slipping wetly out of me.The friction was enough to make me want more.Hed barely softened.Damn it, he said roughly.I want you again.He caught me before I moved away, pulling a handkerchief out from somewhere and running it gently between my legs.It was a deeply intimate act, on par with the sex wed just had.When I was dry, I settled on the seat beside him and dug my lip gloss out of my clutch.I watched Gideon over the edge of my mirrored compact as he removed the condom and tied it off.He wrapped it in a cocktail napkin; then tossed it in a cleverly hidden trash receptacle.After restoring his appearance, he told the driver to head to our destination.Then he settled into the seat and stared out the window.With every second that passed, I felt him withdrawing, the connection between us slipping further and further away.I found myself shrinking into the corner of the seat, away from him, mimicking the distance I felt building between us.All the warmth Id felt receded into a marked chill, cooling me enough that I pulled my shawl around me again.He didnt move a muscle as I shifted beside him and put my compact away, as if he wasnt even aware I was there.Abruptly, Gideon opened the bar and pulled out a bottle.Without looking at me, he asked, Brandy?No, thank you.My voice was small, but he didnt seem to notice.Or maybe he didnt care.He poured a drink and tossed it back.Confused and stung, I pulled on my gloves and tried to figure out what went wrong.7  I dont remember much of what happened after we arrived.Camera flashes burst around us like fireworks as we walked the length of the press gauntlet, but I scarcely paid them any mind, smiling by rote.I was drawn into myself and desperate to get away from the tension radiating in waves from Gideon.The moment we crossed over into the building, someone called his name and he turned.I slipped away, darting around the rest of the guests clogging the carpeted entrance.When I reached the reception hall, I snatched two glasses of champagne from a passing server and searched for Cary as I tossed one back.I spotted him on the far side of the room with my mom and Stanton, and I crossed to them, discarding my empty glass on a table as I passed it.Eva!My mothers face lit up when she saw me.That dress is stunning on you!She air kissed each of my cheeks.She was gorgeous in a shimmering, fitted column of icy blue.Sapphires dripped from her ears, throat, and wrist, highlighting her eyes and her pale skin.Thank you.I took a gulp of champagne from my second glass, remembering that Id planned on expressing gratitude for the dress.While I still appreciated the gift, I was no longer so happy about the convenient thigh slit.Cary stepped forward, catching my elbow.One look at my face and he knew I was upset.I shook my head, not wanting to get into it now.More champagne, then?he asked softly.Please.I felt Gideon approaching before I saw my mothers face light up like the New Years ball in Times Square.Stanton, too, seemed to straighten and gather himself.Eva.Gideon set his hand on the bare skin of my lower back and a shock of awareness moved through me.When his fingers flexed against me, I wondered if he felt it, too.You ran off.I stiffened against the reproof I heard in his tone.I shot him a look that said everything I couldnt while we were in public.Richard, have you met Gideon Cross?Yes, of course.The two men shook hands.Gideon pulled me closer to his side.We share the good fortune of escorting the two most beautiful women in New York.Stanton agreed, smiling indulgently down at my mother.I tossed back the rest of my champagne and gratefully exchanged the empty glass for the fresh one Cary handed me.There was a slight warmth growing in my belly from the alcohol and it loosened the knot that had formed there.Gideon leaned over and whispered harshly, Dont forget youre here with me.He was mad?What the hell?My gaze narrowed.Youre one to talk.Not here, Eva.He nodded at everyone and led me away.Not now.Not ever, I muttered, going along with him just to spare my mother a scene.Sipping my champagne, I slid into an autopilot mode of self preservation I hadnt had to use in many years.Gideon introduced me to people and I supposed I performed well enough spoke at the appropriate moments and smiled when necessary but I wasnt really paying attention.I was too conscious of the icy wall between us and my own hurt anger.If Id needed any proof that Gideon was rigid about not socializing with women he slept with, I had it.When dinner was announced, I went with him into the dining room and poked at my food.I drank a few glasses of the red wine they served with the meal and heard Gideon talking to our tablemates, although I didnt pay attention to the words, only to the cadence and the seductively deep, even tone.He made no attempt to draw me into the conversation and I was glad.I didnt think I could say anything nice.I didnt become engaged until he stood to a round of applause and took the stage.Then I turned in my seat and watched him cross to the podium, unable to help admiring his animal grace and stunning good looks.Every step he took commanded attention and respect, which was a feat, considering his easy and unhurried stride.He looked none the worse for wear after our abandoned fucking in his limo.In fact, he seemed like a totally different person.He was once again the man Id met in the Crossfire lobby, supremely contained and quietly powerful.In North America, he began, childhood sexual abuse is experienced by one in every four women and one in every six men.Take a good look around you.Someone at your table is either a survivor or knows someone who is.Thats the unacceptable truth.I was riveted.Gideon was a consummate orator, his vibrant baritone mesmerizing.But it was the topic, which hit so close to home, and his passionate and sometimes shocking way of discussing it, that moved me.I began to thaw, my bewildered fury and damaged self confidence subverted by wonder.My view of him shifted, altering as I became simply another individual in a rapt audience.He wasnt the man whod so recently hurt my feelings; he was just a skilled speaker discussing a subject that was deeply important to me.When he finished, I stood and applauded, catching both him and myself by surprise.But others quickly joined me in the standing ovation and I heard the buzz of conversations around me, the quietly voiced compliments that were well deserved.Youre a fortunate young lady.I turned to look at the woman who spoke, a lovely redhead who appeared to be in her early forties.Were justfriends.Her serene smile somehow managed to argue with me.People began stepping away from their tables.I was about to grab my clutch so I could leave for home when a young man came up to me.His wayward auburn hair inspired instant envy and his eyes of grayish green were soft and friendly.Handsome and sporting a boyish grin, he lured the first genuine smile out of me since the ride over in the limousine.Hello there, he said.He seemed to know who I was, which put me in the awkward position of pretending I wasnt clueless as to who he was.Hello.He laughed, and the sound was light and charming.Im Christopher Vidal, Gideons brother.Oh, of course.My face heated.I couldnt believe Id been so lost in my own pity party that I hadnt made the connection at once.Youre blushing.Im sorry.I offered a sheepish smile.Not sure how to say I read an article about you without sounding awkward.He laughed.Im flattered you remembered it.Just dont tell me it was in Page Six.The gossip column was notorious for getting the goods on New York celebrities and socialites.No, I said quickly.Rolling Stone, maybe?I can live with that.He extended his arm to me.Would you like to dance?I glanced over to where Gideon was standing at the foot of the stairs that led to the stage.He was surrounded by people eager to talk to him, many of whom were women.You can see hell be awhile, Christopher said, with a note of amusement.Yes.I was about to look away when I recognized the woman standing next to Gideon Magdalene Perez.I picked up my clutch and managed a smile for Christopher.Id love to dance.Arm in arm we headed into the ballroom and stepped onto the dance floor.The band began the first strains of a waltz and we moved easily, naturally into the music.He was a skilled dancer, agile and confident in his lead.So, how do you know Gideon?I dont.I nodded at Cary when he glided by with a statuesque blonde.I work in the Crossfire and weve run into each other once or twice.You work for him?No.Im an assistant at Waters Field and Leaman.Ah.He grinned.Ad agency.Yes.Gideon must really be into you to go from meeting you once or twice to dragging you out on a date like this.I cursed inwardly.Id known assumptions would be made, but I wanted more than ever to avoid further humiliation.Gideons acquainted with my mother and shed already arranged for me to come, so its just a matter of two people going to the same event in one car rather than two.So youre available?I took a deep breath, feeling uncomfortable despite how fluidly we moved together.Well, Im not taken.Christopher flashed his charismatic boyish grin.My night just took a turn for the better.He filled the rest of the dance with amusing anecdotes about the music industry that made me laugh and took my mind off Gideon.When the dance ended, Cary was there to take the next one.We danced very well as a couple because wed taken lessons together.I relaxed into his hold, grateful to have him as moral support.Are you enjoying yourself?I asked him.I pinched myself during dinner when I realized I was sitting next to the top coordinator for Fashion Week.And she flirted with me!He smiled, but his eyes were haunted.Whenever I find myself in places like thisdressed like thisI cant believe it.You saved my life, Eva.Then you changed it completely.You save my sanity all the time.Trust me, were even.His hand tightened on mine, his gaze hardening.You look miserable.Howd he fuck up?I think I did that.Well talk about it later.Youre afraid Ill kick his ass here in front of everyone.I sighed.Id rather you didnt, for my moms sake.Cary pressed his lips briefly to my forehead.I warned him earlier.He knows its coming.Oh, Cary.Love for him tightened my throat even as reluctant amusement curved my lips.I shouldve known Cary would give Gideon a big brother threat of some sort.That was just so like him.Gideon appeared beside us.Im cutting in.It wasnt a request.Cary stopped and looked at me.I nodded.He backed away with a bow, his gaze hot and fierce on Gideons face.Gideon pulled me close and took over the dance the way he took over everything with dominant confidence.It was an entirely different experience dancing with him than with my two previous partners.Gideon had both the expertise of his brother and Carys familiarity with the way my body moved, but Gideon had a bold, aggressive style that was inherently sexual.It didnt help that being so close to a man Id so recently been intimate with seduced my senses despite my unhappiness.He smelled scrumptious, with undertones of sex, and the way he led me through the bold sweeping steps made me feel the soreness deep inside me, reminding me that hed been there not long ago.You keep running off, he muttered, scowling down at me.Seemed like Magdalene picked up the slack quick enough.His brow arched and he drew me closer.Jealous?Seriously?I looked away.He made a frustrated noise.
