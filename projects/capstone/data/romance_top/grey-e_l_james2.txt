I wouldnt miss this for the world, he says, gloating.Im just going to get the car keys.Ill meet you in the garage in five, I growl, ignoring his smug face.THE BAR IS CROWDED, full of students determined to have a good time.Theres some indie crap thumping over the sound system and the dance floor is crowded with heaving bodies.It makes me feel old.Shes here somewhere.Elliot has followed me in through the front door.Do you see her?he shouts over the noise.Scanning the room, I spot Katherine Kavanagh.Shes with a group of friends, all of them men, sitting in a booth.Theres no sign of Ana, but the table is littered with shot glasses and tumblers of beer.Well, lets see if Miss Kavanagh is as loyal to her friend as Ana is to her.She looks at me in surprise when we arrive at her table.Katherine, I say by way of greeting, and she interrupts me before I can ask her Anas whereabouts.Christian, what a surprise to see you here, she shouts above the noise.The three guys at the table regard Elliot and me with hostile wariness.I was in the neighborhood.And whos this?She smiles rather too brightly at Elliot, interrupting me again.What an exasperating woman.This is my brother Elliot.Elliot, Katherine Kavanagh.Wheres Ana?Her smile broadens at Elliot, and Im surprised by his answering grin.I think she went outside for some fresh air, Kavanagh responds, but she doesnt look at me.She has eyes only for Mr.Love Em and Leave Em.Well, its her funeral.Outside?Where?I shout.Oh.That way.She points to double doors at the far end of the bar.Pushing through the throng, I make my way to the door, leaving the three disgruntled men and Kavanagh and Elliot engaged in a grin off.Through the double doors there is a line for the ladies washroom, and beyond that a door thats open to the outside.Its at the back of the bar.Ironically, it leads to the parking lot where Elliot and I have just been.Walking outside, I find myself in a gathering space adjacent to the parking lota hangout flanked by raised flowerbeds, where a few people are smoking, drinking, chatting.Making out.I spot her.Hell!Shes with the photographer, I think, though its difficult to tell in the dim light.Shes in his arms, but she seems to be twisting away from him.He mutters something to her, which I dont hear, and kisses her, along her jaw.Jos, no, she says, and then its clear.Shes trying to push him off.She doesnt want this.For a moment I want to rip his head off.With my hands fisted at my side I march up to them.I think the lady said no.My voice carries, cold and sinister, in the relative quiet, while I struggle to contain my anger.He releases Ana and she squints at me with a dazed, drunken expression.Grey, he says, his voice terse, and it takes every ounce of my self control not to smash the disappointment off his face.Ana heaves, then buckles over and vomits on the ground.Oh, shit!UghDios mo, Ana!Jos leaps out of the way in disgust.Fucking idiot.Ignoring him, I grab her hair and hold it out of the way as she continues to throw up everything shes had this evening.Its with some annoyance that I note she doesnt appear to have eaten.With my arm around her shoulders I lead her away from the curious onlookers toward one of the flowerbeds.If youre going to throw up again, do it here.Ill hold you.Its darker here.She can puke in peace.She vomits again and again, her hands on the brick.Its pitiful.Once her stomach is empty, she continues to retch, long dry heaves.Boy, shes got it bad.Finally her body relaxes and I think shes finished.Releasing her, I give her my handkerchief, which by some miracle I have in the inside pocket of my jacket.Thank you, Mrs.Jones.Wiping her mouth, she turns and rests against the bricks, avoiding eye contact because shes ashamed and embarrassed.And yet Im so pleased to see her.Gone is my fury at the photographer.Im delighted to be standing in the parking lot of a student bar in Portland with Miss Anastasia Steele.She puts her head in her hands, cringes, then peeks up at me, still mortified.Turning to the door, she glares over my shoulder.I assume its at her friend.Ill, um, see you inside, Jos says, but I dont turn to stare him down, and to my delight, she ignores him, too, returning her eyes to mine.Im sorry, she says finally, while her fingers twist the soft linen.Okay, lets have some fun.What are you sorry for, Anastasia?The phone call, mainly.Being sick.Oh, the list is endless, she mumbles.Weve all been here, perhaps not quite as dramatically as you.Why is it such fun to tease this young woman?Its about knowing your limits, Anastasia.I mean, Im all for pushing limits, but really this is beyond the pale.Do you make a habit of this kind of behavior?Perhaps she has a problem with alcohol.The thought is worrying, and I consider whether I should call my mother for a referral to a detox clinic.Ana frowns for a moment, as if angry, that little v forming between her brows, and I suppress the urge to kiss it.But when she speaks she sounds contrite.No, she says.Ive never been drunk before and right now I have no desire to ever be again.She looks up at me, her eyes unfocused, and she sways a little.She might pass out, so without giving it a thought I scoop her up into my arms.Shes surprisingly light.Too light.The thought irks me.No wonder shes drunk.Come on, Ill take you home.I need to tell Kate, she says, as her head rests on my shoulder.My brother can tell her.What?My brother Elliot is talking to Miss Kavanagh.Oh?He was with me when you called.In Seattle?No, Im staying at The Heathman.And my wild goose chase has paid off.How did you find me?I tracked your cell phone, Anastasia.I head toward the car.I want to drive her home.Do you have a jacket or a purse?Eryes, I came with both.Christian, please, I need to tell Kate.Shell worry.I stop and bite my tongue.Kavanagh wasnt worried about her being out here with the overamorous photographer.Rodriguez.Thats his name.What kind of friend is she?The lights from the bar illuminate her anxious face.As much as it pains me, I put her down and agree to take her inside.Holding hands, we walk back into the bar, stopping at Kates table.One of the young men is still sitting there, looking annoyed and abandoned.Wheres Kate?Ana shouts above the noise.Dancing, the guy says, his dark eyes staring at the dance floor.Ana collects her jacket and purse and, reaching out, she unexpectedly clutches my arm.I freeze.Shit.My heart rate catapults into overdrive as the darkness surfaces, stretching and tightening its claws around my throat.Shes on the dance floor, she shouts, her words tickling my ear, distracting me from my fear.And suddenly the darkness disappears and the pounding in my heart ceases.What?I roll my eyes to hide my confusion and take her to the bar, order a large glass of water, and pass it to her.Drink.Eyeing me over the glass, she takes a tentative sip.All of it, I command.Im hoping this will be enough damage control to avoid one hell of a hangover tomorrow.What might have happened to her if I hadnt intervened?My mood sinks.And I think of what just happened to me.Her touch.My reaction.My mood plummets further.Ana sways a little as shes drinking, so I steady her with a hand on her shoulder.I like the connectionme touching her.Shes oil on my troubled, deep, dark waters.Hmmflowery, Grey.She finishes her drink, and retrieving the glass, I place it on the bar.Okay.She wants to talk to her so called friend.I survey the crowded dance floor, uneasy at the thought of all those bodies pressing in on me as we fight our way through.Steeling myself, I grab her hand and lead her toward the dance floor.She hesitates, but if she wants to talk to her friend, theres only one way; shes going to have to dance with me.Once Elliot gets his groove on, theres no stopping him; so much for his quiet night in.With a tug, shes in my arms.This I can handle.When I know shes going to touch me, its okay.I can deal, especially since Im wearing my jacket.I weave us through the crowd to where Elliot and Kate are making a spectacle of themselves.Still dancing, Elliot leans toward me in mid strut when were beside him and sizes us up with a look of incredulity.Im taking Ana home.Tell Kate, I shout in his ear.He nods and pulls Kavanagh into his arms.Right.Let me take Miss Drunk Bookworm home, but for some reason she seems reluctant to go.Shes watching Kavanagh with concern.When were off the dance floor she looks back at Kate, then at me, swaying and a little dazed.Fuck By some miracle I catch her as she passes out in the middle of the bar.Im tempted to haul her over my shoulder, but wed be too conspicuous, so I pick her up once more, cradling her against my chest, and take her outside to the car.Christ, I mutter as I fish the key out of my jeans and hold her at the same time.Amazingly, I manage to get her into the front seat and strap her in.Ana.I give her a little shake, because shes worryingly quiet.Ana!She mumbles something incoherent and I know shes still conscious.I know I should take her home, but its a long drive to Vancouver, and I dont know if shell be sick again.I dont relish the idea of my Audi reeking of vomit.The smell emanating from her clothes is already noticeable.I head to The Heathman, telling myself that Im doing this for her sake.Yeah, tell yourself that, Grey.SHE SLEEPS IN MY arms as we travel up in the elevator from the garage.I need to get her out of her jeans and her shoes.The stale stench of vomit pervades the space.Id really like to give her a bath, but that would be stepping beyond the bounds of propriety.And this isnt?In my suite, I drop her purse on the sofa, then carry her into the bedroom and lay her down on the bed.She mumbles once more but doesnt wake.Briskly I remove her shoes and socks and put them in the plastic laundry bag provided by the hotel.Then I unzip her jeans and pull them off, check the pockets before stuffing the jeans in the laundry bag.She falls back on the bed, splayed out like a starfish, all pale arms and legs, and for a moment I picture those legs wrapped around my waist as her wrists are bound to my Saint Andrews cross.Theres a fading bruise on her knee and I wonder if thats from the fall she took in my office.Shes been marked since thenlike me.I sit her up and she opens her eyes.Hello, Ana, I whisper, as I remove her jacket slowly and without her cooperation.Grey.Lips, she mutters.Yes, sweetheart.I ease her down onto the bed.She closes her eyes again and rolls onto her side, but this time huddles into a ball, looking small and vulnerable.I pull the covers over her and plant a kiss in her hair.Now that her filthy clothes have gone, a trace of her scent has reappeared.Apples, fall, fresh, deliciousAna.Her lips are parted, eyelashes fanning out over pale cheeks, and her skin looks flawless.One more touch is all I allow myself as I stroke her cheek with the back of my index finger.Sleep well, I murmur, and then head into the living room to complete the laundry list.When its done, I place the offending bag outside my suite so the contents will be collected and laundered.Before I check my e mails I text Welch, asking him to see if Jos Rodriguez has any police records.Im curious.I want to know if he preys on drunk young women.Then I address the issue of clothes for Miss Steele: I send a quick e mail to Taylor.* * *      From: Christian Grey  RE: Miss Anastasia Steele  Date: May 20, 2011 23:46  To: J B Taylor  Good morning,  Can you please find the following items for Miss Steele and have them delivered to my usual room before 10:00.Jeans: Blue Denim Size 4  Blouse: Blue.Pretty.Size 4  Converse: Black Size 7  Socks: Size 7  Lingerie: UnderwearSize Small.BraEstimate 34C.Thank you.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.Once its disappeared from my outbox, I text Elliot.Ana is with me.If youre still with Kate, tell her.He texts by return.Will do.Hope you get laid.You soooo need it.;)  His response makes me snort.I so do, Elliot.I so do.I open my work e mail and begin to read.SATURDAY, MAY 21, 2011    * * *      Nearly two hours later, I come to bed.Its just after 1:45.Shes fast asleep and hasnt moved from where I left her.I strip, pull on my PJ pants and a T shirt, and climb in beside her.Shes comatose; its unlikely shes going to thrash around and touch me.I hesitate for a moment as the darkness swells within me, but it doesnt surface and I know its because Im watching the hypnotic rise and fall of her chest and Im breathing in sync with her.In.Out.In.Out.In.Out.For seconds, minutes, hours, I dont know, I watch her.And while she sleeps I survey every beautiful inch of her lovely face.Her dark lashes fluttering while she sleeps, her lips slightly parted so I glimpse her even white teeth.She mutters something unintelligible and her tongue darts out and licks her lips.Its arousing, very arousing.Finally I fall into a deep and dreamless slumber.ITS QUIET WHEN I open my eyes, and Im momentarily disoriented.Oh yes.Im at The Heathman.The clock at my bedside says 7:43.When was the last time I slept this late?Ana.Slowly I turn my head, and shes fast asleep, facing me.Her beautiful face soft in repose.I have never slept with a woman.Ive fucked many, but to wake up beside an alluring young woman is a new and stimulating experience.My cock agrees.This will not do.Reluctantly, I climb out of bed and change into my running gear.I need to burn off thisexcess energy.As I change into my sweats I cant remember the last time Ive slept so well.In the living room, I fire up my laptop, check my e mail, and respond to two from Ros and one from Andrea.It takes me a little longer than usual, as Im distracted knowing that Ana is asleep in the next room.I wonder how shell feel when she wakes.Hungover.Ah.In the minibar I find a bottle of orange juice and empty it into a glass.Shes still asleep when I enter, her hair a riot of mahogany spread across her pillow, and the covers have slipped below her waist.Her T shirt has ridden up, exposing her belly and her navel.The sight stirs my body once more.Stop standing here ogling the girl, for fucks sake, Grey.I have to get out of here before I do something Ill regret.Placing the glass on the bedside table, I duck into the bathroom, find two Advil in my travel kit, and deposit them beside the glass of orange juice.With one last lingering look at Anastasia Steelethe first woman Ive ever slept withI head out for my run.WHEN I RETURN FROM my exercise, theres a bag in the living room from a store I dont recognize.I take a peek and see it contains clothes for Ana.From what I can see, Taylor has done welland all before 9:00.The man is a marvel.Her purse is on the sofa where I dropped it last night, and the door to the bedroom is closed, so I assume shes not left and that shes still asleep.Its a relief.Poring over the room service menu, I decide to order some food.Shell be hungry when she wakes, but I have no idea what shell eat, so in a rare moment of indulgence I order a selection from the breakfast menu.Im informed it will take half an hour.Time to wake the delectable Miss Steele; shes slept enough.Grabbing my workout towel and the shopping bag, I knock on the door and enter.To my delight, shes sitting up in bed.The tablets are gone and so is the juice.Good girl.She pales as I saunter into the room.Keep it casual, Grey.You dont want to be charged with kidnapping.She closes her eyes, and I assume its because shes embarrassed.Good morning, Anastasia.How are you feeling?Better than I deserve, she mutters, as I place the bag on the chair.When she turns her gaze to me her eyes are impossibly big and blue, and though her hair is a tangled messshe looks stunning.How did I get here?she asks, as though shes afraid of the answer.Reassure her, Grey.I sit down on the edge of the bed and stick to the facts.After you passed out, I didnt want to risk the leather upholstery in my car, taking you all the way to your apartment.So I brought you here.Did you put me to bed?Yes.Did I throw up again?No.Thank God.Did you undress me?Yes.Who else would have undressed you?She blushes, and at last she has some color in her cheeks.Perfect teeth bite down on her lip.I suppress a groan.We didnt?she whispers, staring at her hands.Christ, what kind of animal does she think I am?Anastasia, you were comatose.Necrophilia is not my thing.My tone is dry.I like my women sentient and receptive.She sags with relief, which makes me wonder if this has happened to her before, that shes passed out and woken up in a strangers bed and found out hes fucked her without her consent.Maybe thats the photographers modus operandi.The thought is disturbing.But I recall her confession last nightthat shed never been drunk before.Thank God she hasnt made a habit of this.Im so sorry, she says, her voice full of shame.Hell.Maybe I should go easy on her.It was a very diverting evening.Not one that Ill forget in a while.I hope that sounds conciliatory, but her brow creases.You didnt have to track me down with whatever James Bond gadgetry youre developing for the highest bidder.Whoa!Now shes pissed.Why?First, the technology to track cell phones is available over the Internet.Well, the Deep Net  Second, my company does not invest or manufacture any kind of surveillance devices.My temper is fraying, but Im on a roll.And third, if I hadnt come to get you, youd probably be waking up in the photographers bed, and from what I can remember, you werent overly enthused about him pressing his suit.She blinks a couple of times, then starts giggling.Shes laughing at me again.Which medieval chronicle did you escape from?You sound like a courtly knight.Shes beguiling.Shes calling me outagain, and her irreverence is refreshing, really refreshing.However, Im under no illusion that Im a knight in shining armor.Boy, has she got the wrong idea.And though it may not be to my advantage, Im compelled to warn her that theres nothing chivalrous or courtly about me.Anastasia, I dont think so.Dark knight, maybe.If only she knewand why are we discussing me?I change the subject.Did you eat last night?She shakes her head.I knew it!You need to eat.Thats why you were so ill.Honestly, its drinking rule number one.Are you going to continue to scold me?Is that what Im doing?I think so.Youre lucky Im just scolding you.What do you mean?Well, if you were mine, you wouldnt be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday.You didnt eat, you got drunk, you put yourself at risk.The fear in my gut surprises me; such irresponsible, risk taking behavior.I hate to think what could have happened to you.She scowls.I would have been fine.I was with Kate.Some help she was!And the photographer?I retort.Jos just got out of line, she says, dismissing my concern and tossing her tangled hair over her shoulder.Well, the next time he gets out of line, maybe someone should teach him some manners.Youre quite the disciplinarian, she snaps.Oh, Anastasia, you have no idea.An image of her shackled to my bench, peeled gingerroot inserted in her ass so she cant clench her buttocks, comes to mind, followed by judicious use of a belt or strap.YeahThat would teach her not to be so irresponsible.The thought is hugely appealing.Shes staring at me wide eyed and dazed, and it makes me uncomfortable.Can she read my mind?Or is she just looking at a pretty face.Im going to have a shower.Unless youd like to shower first?I tell her, but she continues to gape.Even with her mouth open shes quite lovely.Shes hard to resist, and I grant myself permission to touch her, tracing the line of her cheek with my thumb.Her breath catches in her throat as I stroke her soft bottom lip.Breathe, Anastasia, I murmur, before I stand and inform her that breakfast will be here in fifteen minutes.She says nothing, her smart mouth silent for once.In the bathroom I take a deep breath, strip, and climb into the shower.Im half tempted to jerk off, but the familiar fear of discovery and disclosure, from an earlier time in my life, stops me.Elena would not be pleased.Old habits.As the water cascades over my head I reflect on my latest interaction with the challenging Miss Steele.Shes still here, in my bed, so she cannot find me completely repulsive.I noticed the way her breath caught in her throat, and how her gaze followed me around the room.Yeah.Theres hope.But would she make a good submissive?Its obvious she knows nothing of the lifestyle.She couldnt even say fuck or sex or whatever bookish college students use as a euphemism for fucking these days.Shes quite the innocent.Shes probably been subjected to a few fumbling encounters with boys like the photographer.The thought of her fumbling with anyone irks me.I could just ask her if shes interested.No.Id have to show her what shed be taking on if she agreed to a relationship with me.Lets see how we both fare over breakfast.Rinsing off the soap, I stand beneath the hot stream and gather my wits for round two with Anastasia Steele.I switch off the water and, stepping out of the shower, grab a towel.A quick check in the steamed up mirror and I decide to skip shaving today.Breakfast will be here shortly, and Im hungry.Quickly I brush my teeth.When I open the bathroom door shes out of bed and searching for her jeans.She looks up like the archetypal startled fawn, all long legs and big eyes.If youre looking for your jeans, Ive sent them to the laundry.She really has great legs.She shouldnt hide them in pants.Her eyes narrow, and I think shes going to argue with me, so I tell her why.They were spattered with your vomit.Oh, she says.Yes.Oh.Now, what do you have to say to that, Miss Steele?I sent Taylor out for another pair and some shoes.Theyre in the bag on the chair.I nod at the shopping bag.She raises her eyebrowsin surprise, I think.Um.Ill have a shower, she mutters, and then as an afterthought she adds, Thanks.Grabbing the bag, she dodges around me, darts into the bathroom, and locks the door.Hmmshe couldnt get into the bathroom quick enough.Away from me.Perhaps Im being too optimistic.Disheartened, I briskly dry off and get dressed.In the living room I check my e mail, but theres nothing urgent.Im interrupted by a knock on the door.Two young women have arrived from room service.Where would you like breakfast, sir?Set it up on the dining table.Walking back into the bedroom, I catch their furtive looks, but I ignore them and suppress the guilt I feel over how much food Ive ordered.Well never eat it all.Breakfast is here, I call, and rap on the bathroom door.O okay.Anas voice sounds a little muted.Back in the living room, our breakfast is on the table.One of the women, who has dark, dark eyes, hands me the check to sign, and from my wallet I pull a couple of twenties for them.Thank you, ladies.Just call room service when you want the table cleared, sir, Miss Dark Eyes says with a coquettish look, as if shes offering more.My chilly smile warns her off.Sitting down at the table with the newspaper, I pour myself a coffee and make a start on my omelet.My phone buzzesa text from Elliot.Kate wants to know if Ana is still alive.I chuckle, somewhat mollified that Anas so called friend is thinking about her.Its obvious that Elliot hasnt given his dick a rest after all his protestations yesterday.I text back.Alive and kicking ;)  Ana appears a few moments later: hair wet, in the pretty blue blouse that matches her eyes.Taylor has done well; she looks lovely.Scanning the room, she spots her purse.Crap, Kate!she blurts.She knows youre here and still alive.I texted Elliot.She gives me an uncertain smile as she walks toward the table.Sit, I say, pointing to the place thats been set for her.She frowns at the amount of food on the table, which only accentuates my guilt.I didnt know what you liked, so I ordered a selection from the breakfast menu, I mutter by way of an apology.Thats very profligate of you, she says.Yes, it is.My guilt blooms.But as she opts for the pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon with maple syrup, and tucks in, I forgive myself.Its good to see her eat.Tea?I ask.Yes, please, she says between mouthfuls.Shes obviously famished.I pass her the small teapot of water.She gives me a sweet smile when she notices the Twinings English Breakfast tea.I have to catch my breath at her expression.And it makes me uneasy.It gives me hope.Your hairs very damp, I observe.I couldnt find the hair dryer, she says, embarrassed.Shell get sick.Thank you for the clothes, she adds.Its a pleasure, Anastasia.That color suits you.She stares down at her fingers.You know, you really should learn to take a compliment.Perhaps she doesnt get manybut why?Shes gorgeous in an understated way.I should give you some money for these clothes.What?I glare at her, and she continues quickly, Youve already given me the books, which, of course, I cant accept.But these, please let me pay you back.Sweetheart.Anastasia, trust me, I can afford it.Thats not the point.Why should you buy these for me?Because I can.Im a very rich man, Ana.Just because you can doesnt mean that you should.Her voice is soft, but suddenly Im wondering if shes looked through me and seen my darkest desires.Why did you send me the books, Christian?Because I wanted to see you again, and here you are  Well, when you were nearly run over by the cyclistand I was holding you and you were looking up at meall kiss me, kiss me, Christian I stop, recalling that moment, her body pressed against mine.Shit.Quickly I shrug off the memory.I felt I owed you an apology and a warning.Anastasia, Im not a hearts and flowers kind of man.I dont do romance.My tastes are very singular.You should steer clear of me.Theres something about you, though, and Im finding it impossible to stay away.But I think youve figured that out already.Then dont, she whispers.What?You dont know what youre saying.Enlighten me, then.Her words travel straight to my cock.Fuck.Youre not celibate?she asks.No, Anastasia, Im not celibate.And if youd let me tie you up Id prove it to you right now.Her eyes widen and her cheeks pink.Oh, Ana.I have to show her.Its the only way Ill know.What are your plans for the next few days?I ask.Im working today, from midday.What time is it?she exclaims in panic.Its just after ten; youve plenty of time.What about tomorrow?Kate and I are going to start packing.Were moving to Seattle next weekend, and Im working at Claytons all this week.You have a place in Seattle already?Yes.Where?I cant remember the address.Its in the Pike Market District.Not far from me.Good!So what are you going to do for work in Seattle?Ive applied for some internships.Im waiting to hear.Have you applied to my company, as I suggested?Umno.And whats wrong with my company?Your company or your company?She arches an eyebrow.Are you smirking at me, Miss Steele?I cant hide my amusement.Oh, shed be a joy to trainchallenging, maddening woman.She examines her plate, chewing at her lip.Id like to bite that lip, I whisper, because its true.Her face flies to mine and she shuffles in her seat.She tilts her chin toward me, her eyes full of confidence.Why dont you?she says quietly.Oh.Dont tempt me, baby.I cant.Not yet.Because Im not going to touch you, Anastasianot until I have your written consent to do so.What does that mean?she asks.Exactly what I say.I need to show you, Anastasia.So you know what youre getting yourself into.What time do you finish work this evening?About eight.Well, we could go to Seattle this evening or next Saturday for dinner at my place, and Ill acquaint you with the facts then.The choice is yours.Why cant you tell me now?Because Im enjoying my breakfast and your company.Once youre enlightened, you probably wont want to see me again.She frowns as she processes what Ive said.Tonight, she says.Whoa.That didnt take long.Like Eve, youre so quick to eat from the tree of knowledge, I taunt her.Are you smirking at me, Mr.Grey?she asks.I look at her through narrowed eyes.Okay, baby, you asked for this.I pick up my phone and press Taylor on speed dial.He answers almost immediately.Mr.Grey.Taylor.Im going to need Charlie Tango.She watches me closely as I make arrangements to bring my EC135 to Portland.Ill show her what I have in mindand the rest will be up to her.She may want to come home once she knows.Ill need Stephan, my pilot, to be on standby so he can bring her back to Portland if she decides to have nothing more to do with me.I hope thats not the case.And it dawns on me that Im thrilled that I can take her to Seattle in Charlie Tango.Itll be a first.Standby pilot from 22:30, I confirm with Taylor and hang up.Do people always do what you tell them?she asks, and the disapproval in her voice is obvious.Is she scolding me now?Her challenge is annoying.Usually, if they want to keep their jobs.Dont question how I treat my staff.And if they dont work for you?she adds.Oh, I can be very persuasive, Anastasia.You should finish your breakfast.And then Ill drop you off at home.Ill pick you up at Claytons at eight when you finish.Well fly up to Seattle.Fly?Yes.I have a helicopter.Her mouth drops open, forming a small o.  Its a pleasing moment.Well go by helicopter to Seattle?she whispers.Yes.Why?Because I can.I grin.Sometimes its just fucking great to be me.Finish your breakfast.She seems stunned.Eat!My voice is more forceful.Anastasia, I have an issue with wasted food.Eat.I cant eat all this.She studies all the food on the table and I feel guilty once more.Yes, there is too much food here.Eat whats on your plate.If youd eaten properly yesterday, you wouldnt be here, and I wouldnt be declaring my hand so soon.Hell.This could be a huge mistake.She gives me a sideways look as she chases her food around on the plate with a fork, and her mouth twitches.Whats so funny?She shakes her head and pops the last piece of pancake into her mouth, and I try not to laugh.As ever, she surprises me.Shes awkward, unexpected, and disarming.She really makes me want to laugh, and whats more, its at myself.Good girl, I mutter.Ill take you home when youve dried your hair.I dont want you getting ill.Youll need all your strength for tonight, for what I have to show you.Suddenly, she gets up from the table and I have to stop myself from telling her that she doesnt have permission.Shes not your submissiveyet, Grey.On the way back to the bedroom, she pauses by the sofa.Where did you sleep last night?she asks.In my bed.With you.Oh.Yes, it was quite a novelty for me, too.Not havingsex.She said the s wordand the telltale pink cheeks appear.No.How can I tell her this, without it sounding weird?Just tell her, Grey.Sleeping with someone.Nonchalantly, I turn my attention back to the sports section and the write up on last nights game, then watch as she disappears into the bedroom.No, that didnt sound weird at all.Well, I have another date with Miss Steele.No, not a date.She needs to know about me.I let out a long breath and drink whats left of my orange juice.This is shaping up to be a very interesting day.Im pleased when I hear the buzz of the hair dryer and surprised that shes doing what shes been told.While Im waiting for her, I phone the valet to bring my car up from the garage and check her address once more on Google Maps.Next, I text Andrea to send me an NDA via e mail; if Ana wants enlightenment, shell need to keep her mouth shut.My phone buzzes.Its Ros.As Im on the phone, Ana emerges from the bedroom and picks up her purse.Ros is talking about Darfur, but my attention is on Miss Steele.She rummages around in her purse and shes pleased when she finds a hair tie.Her hair is beautiful.Lush.Long.Thick.Idly, I wonder what it would be like to braid.She ties it back and puts on her jacket, then sits down on the sofa, waiting for me to finish my call.Okay, lets do it.Keep me abreast of progress.I conclude my conversation with Ros.Shes been working miracles and it looks like our food shipment to Darfur is happening.Ready to go?I ask Ana.She nods.I grab my jacket and car keys and follow her out the door.She peeks at me through long lashes as we walk toward the elevator, and her lips curl into a shy smile.My lips twitch in response.What the hell is she doing to me?The elevator arrives, and I allow her to step in first.I press the first floor button and the doors close.In the confines of the elevator, Im completely aware of her.A trace of her sweet fragrance invades my sensesHer breathing alters, hitching a little, and she peeks up at me with a bright come hither look.Shit.She bites her lip.Shes doing this on purpose.And for a split second Im lost in her sensual, mesmerizing stare.She doesnt back down.Im hard.Instantly.I want her.Here.Now.In the elevator.Oh, fuck the paperwork.The words come from nowhere and on instinct I grab her and push her against the wall.Clasping both her hands, I pin them above her head so she cant touch me, and once shes secure, I twist my other hand in her hair while my lips seek and find hers.She moans into my mouth, the call of a siren, and finally I can sample her: mint and tea and an orchard of mellow fruitfulness.She tastes every bit as good as she looks.Reminding me of a time of plenty.Good Lord.Im yearning for her.I grasp her chin, deepening the kiss, and her tongue tentatively touches mineexploring.Considering.Feeling.Kissing me back.Oh, God in heaven.You.Are.So.Sweet, I murmur against her lips, completely intoxicated, punch drunk with her scent and taste.The elevator stops and the doors begin to open.Get a fucking grip, Grey.I push myself off her and stand beyond her reach.Shes breathing hard.As am I.   When was the last time I lost control?Three men in business suits give us knowing looks as they join us.And I stare at the poster thats above the buttons in the elevator advertising a sensual weekend at The Heathman.I glance at Ana and exhale.She grins.And my lips twitch once more.What the fuck has she done to me?The elevator stops at the second floor and the guys get out, leaving me alone with Miss Steele.Youve brushed your teeth, I observe with wry amusement.I used your toothbrush, she says, eyes shining.Of course she hasand for some reason, I find this pleasing, too pleasing.I stifle my smile.Oh, Anastasia Steele, what am I going to do with you?I take her hand as the elevator doors open on the ground floor, and I mutter under my breath, What is it about elevators?She gives me a knowing look as we stroll across the polished marble of the lobby.The car is waiting in one of the bays in front of the hotel; the valet is pacing impatiently.I give him an obscene tip and open the passenger door for Ana, who is quiet and introspective.But she hasnt run.Even though I jumped her in the elevator.I should say something about what happened in therebut what?Sorry?How was that for you?What the hell are you doing to me?I start the car and decide that the less said, the better.The soothing sound of Delibess Flower Duet fills the car and I begin to relax.What are we listening to?Ana inquires, as I turn onto Southwest Jefferson Street.I tell her and ask her if she likes it.Christian, its wonderful.To hear my name on her lips is a strange delight.Shes said it about half a dozen times now, and each time its different.Today, its with wonderat the music.Its great that she likes this piece: its one of my favorites.I find myself beaming; shes obviously excused me for the elevator outburst.Can I hear that again?Of course.I tap the touch screen to replay the music.You like classical music?she asks, as we cross the Fremont Bridge, and we fall into an easy conversation about my taste in music.While were talking I get a call on the hands free.Grey, I answer.Mr.Grey, its Welch here.I have the information you require.Oh yes, details about the photographer.Good.E mail it to me.Anything to add?No, sir.I press the button and the music is back.We both listen, now lost in the raw sound of the Kings of Leon.But it doesnt last longour listening pleasure is disturbed once more by the hands free.What the hell?Grey, I snap.The NDA has been e mailed to you, Mr.Grey.Good.Thats all, Andrea.Good day, sir.I sneak a look at Ana, to see if shes picked up on that conversation, but shes studying the Portland scenery.I suspect shes being polite.Its difficult to keep my eyes on the road.I want to stare at her.For all her maladroitness, she has a beautiful neckline, one that Id like to kiss from the bottom of her ear right down to her shoulder.Hell.I shuffle in my seat.I hope she agrees to sign the NDA and to take what I have to offer.When we join I 5 I get another call.Its Elliot.Hi, Christian, dyou get laid?Ohsmooth, dude, smooth.Hello, ElliotIm on speakerphone, and Im not alone in the car.Whos with you?Anastasia Steele.Hi, Ana!Hello, Elliot, she says, animated.Heard a lot about you, Elliot says.Shit.What has he heard?Dont believe a word Kate says, she responds good naturedly.Elliot laughs.Im dropping Anastasia off now.Shall I pick you up?I interject.Theres no doubt Elliot will want to make a quick getaway.Sure.See you shortly.I hang up.Why do you insist on calling me Anastasia?she asks.Because its your name.I prefer Ana.Do you, now?Ana is too everyday and ordinary for her.And too familiar.Those three letters have the power to wound  And in that moment I know that her rejection, when it comes, will be hard to take.Its happened before, but Ive never felt thisinvested.I dont even know this girl, but I want to know her, all of her.Maybe its because Ive never chased a woman.Grey, get control of yourself and follow the rules, otherwise this will all go to shit.Anastasia, I say, ignoring her disapproving look.What happened in the elevatorit wont happen againwell, not unless its premeditated.That keeps her quiet as I park outside her apartment.Before she can answer me I climb out of the car, walk around and open her door.As she steps onto the sidewalk, she gives me a fleeting glance.I liked what happened in the elevator, she says.You did?Her confession halts me in my tracks.Im pleasantly surprised again by little Miss Steele.As she walks up the steps to the front door, I have to scramble to keep up with her.Elliot and Kate look up when we enter.Theyre sitting at a dining table in a sparsely furnished room, befitting a couple of students.There are a few packing boxes beside a bookshelf.Elliot looks relaxed and not in a hurry to leave, which surprises me.Kavanagh jumps up and gives me a critical once over as she hugs Ana.What did she think I was going to do to the girl?I know what Id like to do to her  As Kavanagh holds her at arms length Im reassured; maybe she does care for Ana, too.Good morning, Christian, she says, her tone cool and condescending.Miss Kavanagh.And what I want to say is something sarcastic about how shes finally showing some interest in her friend, but I hold my tongue.Christian, her name is Kate, Elliot says with mild irritation.Kate, I mutter, to be polite.Elliot hugs Ana, holding her for a moment too long.Hi, Ana, he says, all fucking smiles.Hi, Elliot.She beams.Okay, this is becoming unbearable.Elliot, wed better go.And take your hands off her.Sure, he says, releasing Ana, but grabbing Kavanagh and making an unseemly show of kissing her.Oh, for fucks sake.Anas uncomfortable watching them.I dont blame her.But when she turns to me its with a speculative look through narrowed eyes.What is she thinking?Laters, baby, Elliot mutters, slobbering over Kavanagh.Dude, show some dignity, for heavens sake.Anas reproachful eyes are on me, and for a moment I dont know if its because of Elliot and Kates lascivious display or  Hell!This is what she wants.To be courted and wooed.I dont do romance, sweetheart.A lock of her hair has broken free, and without thinking, I tuck it behind her ear.She leans her face into my fingers, the tender gesture surprising me.My thumb strays to her soft bottom lip, which Id like to kiss again.But I cant.Not until I have her consent.Laters, baby, I whisper, and her face softens with a smile.Ill pick you up at eight.Reluctantly, I turn away and open the front door, Elliot behind me.Man, I need some sleep, Elliot says, as soon as were in the car.That woman is voracious.Really My voice drips with sarcasm.The last thing I want is a blow by blow account of his assignation.How about you, hotshot?Did she pop your cherry?I give him a sideways fuck off glare.Elliot laughs.Man, you are one uptight son of a bitch.He pulls his Sounders cap over his face and nestles down in his seat for a nap.I turn up the volume of the music.Sleep through that, Lelliot!Yeah.I envy my brother: his ease with women, his ability to sleepand the fact that hes not the son of a bitch.JOS LUIS RODRIGUEZS BACKGROUND check reveals a ticket for possession of marijuana.There is nothing in his police records for sexual harassment.Maybe last night would have been a first if I hadnt intervened.And the little prick smokes weed?I hope he doesnt smoke around Anaand I hope she doesnt smoke, period.Opening Andreas e mail, I send the NDA to the printer in my study at home in Escala.Ana will need to sign it before I show her my playroom.And in a moment of weakness, or hubris, or perhaps unprecedented optimismI dont know whichI fill in her name and address on my standard Dom/sub contract and send that to print, too.Theres a knock at the door.Hey, hotshot.Lets go hiking, Elliot says through the door.Ahthe child has woken from his nap.THE SCENT OF PINE, fresh damp earth, and late spring is a balm to my senses.The smell reminds me of those heady days of my childhood, running through a forest with Elliot and my sister Mia under the watchful eyes of our adoptive parents.The quiet, the space, the freedomthe scrunch of dry pine needles underfoot.Here in the great outdoors I could forget.Here was a refuge from my nightmares.Elliot chatters away, needing only the occasional grunt from me to keep talking.As we make our way along the pebbled shore of the Willamette my mind strays to Anastasia.For the first time in a long time, I have a sweet sense of anticipation.Im excited.Will she say yes to my proposal?I picture her sleeping beside me, soft and smalland my cock twitches with expectation.I could have woken her and fucked her thenwhat a novelty that would have been.Ill fuck her in time.Ill fuck her bound and with her smart mouth gagged.CLAYTONS IS QUIET.The last customer left five minutes ago.And Im waitingagaindrumming my fingers on my thighs.Patience is not my forte.Even the long hike with Elliot today has not dampened my restlessness.Hes having dinner with Kate this evening at The Heathman.Two dates on consecutive nights is not his usual style.Suddenly the fluorescent lights inside the store flicker off, the front door opens, and Ana steps out into a mild Portland evening.My heart begins to hammer.This is it: either the beginning of a new relationship or the beginning of the end.She waves good bye to a young man whos followed her out.Its not the same man I met the last time I was hereits someone new.He watches her walk toward the car, his eyes on her ass.Taylor distracts me by making a move to climb out of the car, but I stop him.This is my call.When Im out of the car holding the door open for her, the new guy is locking up the store and no longer ogling Miss Steele.Her lips curve into a shy smile as she approaches, her hair in a jaunty ponytail swinging in the evening breeze.Good evening, Miss Steele.Mr.Grey, she says.Shes dressed in black jeansJeans again.She greets Taylor as she climbs into the backseat of the car.Once Im beside her I clasp her hand, while Taylor pulls out onto the empty road and heads to the Portland helipad.How was work?I ask, enjoying the feel of her hand in mine.Very long, she says, her voice husky.Yes, its been a long day for me, too.Its been hell waiting for the last couple of hours!What did you do?she asks.I went hiking with Elliot.Her hand is warm and soft.She glances down at our joined fingers and I brush her knuckles with my thumb over and over.Her breath catches and her eyes meet mine.In them I see her longing and desireand her sense of anticipation.I just hope she accepts my proposition.Mercifully, the drive to the helipad is short.When were out of the car I take her hand again.She looks a little perplexed.Ah.Shes wondering where the helicopter might be.Ready?I ask.She nods, and I lead her into the building toward the elevator.She gives me a quick knowing look.Shes remembering the kiss from this morning, but thenso am I.   Its only three floors, I mutter.As we stand inside I make a mental note to fuck her in an elevator one day.Thats if she agrees to my deal.On the roof Charlie Tango, newly arrived from Boeing Field, is prepped and ready to fly, though theres no sign of Stephan, whos brought her down here.But Joe, who runs the helipad in Portland, is in the small office.He salutes when I see him.Hes older than my grandpa, and what he doesnt know about flying is not worth knowing; he flew Sikorskys in Korea for casualty evacuation, and boy, does he have some hair raising stories.Heres your flight plan, Mr.Grey, Joe says, his gravelly voice betraying his age.All external checks are done.Shes ready and waiting, sir.Youre good to go.Thank you, Joe.A quick glance at Ana tells me that shes excitedand so am I.  This is a first.Lets go.With her hand in mine once more, I lead Ana over the helipad to Charlie Tango.The safest Eurocopter in her class and a delight to fly.Shes my pride and joy.I hold the door open for Ana; she scrambles inside and I climb in behind her.Over there, I order, pointing to the front passenger seat.Sit.Dont touch anything.Im amazed when she does as shes told.Once in her seat, she examines the array of instruments with a mixture of awe and enthusiasm.Crouching down beside her, I strap her into the seat harness, trying not to imagine her naked as I do it.I take a little longer than is necessary because this might be my last chance to be this close to her, my last chance to inhale her sweet, evocative scent.Once she knows about my predilections she may fleeon the other hand, she may embrace the lifestyle.The possibilities this conjures in my mind are almost overwhelming.Shes watching me intently, shes so closeso lovely.I tighten the last strap.Shes not going anywhere.Not for an hour at least.Suppressing my excitement, I whisper, Youre secure.No escaping.She inhales sharply.Breathe, Anastasia, I add, and caress her cheek.Holding her chin, I lean down and kiss her quickly.I like this harness, I mutter.I want to tell her I have others, in leather, in which Id like to see her trussed and suspended from the ceiling.But I behave, sit down, and buckle up.Put your cans on.I point to the headset in front of Ana.Im just going through all the preflight checks.All instruments look good.I press the throttle to 1500 rpm, transponder to stand by, and position beacon on.Everything is set and ready to go.Do you know what youre doing?she asks with wonder.I inform her that Ive been a fully qualified pilot for four years.Her smile is infectious.Youre safe with me, I reassure her, and add, Well, while were flying.I give her a wink, she beams, and Im dazzled.Are you ready?I askand I cant quite believe how excited I am to have her here beside me.She nods.I talk to the towertheyre awakeand increase the throttle to 2000 rpm.Once theyve given us clearance I do my final checks.Oil temperature is at 104.Good.I increase the manifold pressure to 14, the engine to 2500 rpm, and pull back on the throttle.And like the elegant bird she isCharlie Tango rises into the air.Anastasia gasps as the ground disappears below us, but she holds her tongue, entranced by the waning lights of Portland.Soon we are shrouded in darkness; the only light emanates from the instruments before us.Anas face is illuminated by the red and green glow as she stares into the night.Eerie, isnt it?Though I dont find it so.To me this is a comfort.Nothing can harm me here.Im safe and hidden in the dark.How do you know youre going the right way?Ana asks.Here.I point to the panel.I dont want to bore her talking about instrument flight rules, but the fact is its all the equipment in front of me that guides us to our destination: the attitude indicator, the altimeter, the VSI, and of course the GPS.I tell her about Charlie Tango, and how shes equipped for night flight.Ana looks at me, amazed.Theres a helipad on top of the building I live in.Thats where were heading.I look back at the panel, checking all the data.This is what I love: the control, my safety and well being reliant on my mastery of the technology in front of me.When you fly at night, you fly blind.You have to trust the instrumentation, I tell her.How long will the flight be?she asks, a little breathless.Less than an hourthe wind is in our favor.I glance at her again.You okay, Anastasia?Yes, she says, her voice oddly abrupt.Is she nervous?Or maybe shes regretting her decision to be here with me.The thought is unsettling.She hasnt given me a chance.Im distracted by air traffic control for a moment.Then, as we clear cloud cover, I see Seattle in the distance, a beacon blazing in the dark.Look, over there.I direct Anas attention to the bright lights.Do you always impress women this way?Come and fly in my helicopter?Ive never brought a girl up here, Anastasia.Its another first for me.Are you impressed?Im awed, Christian, she whispers.Awed?My smile is spontaneous.And I remember Grace, my mother, stroking my hair as I read out loud from The Once and Future King.Christian, that was wonderful.Im awed, darling boy.I was seven and had only recently started speaking.Youre just socompetent, Ana continues.Why, thank you, Miss Steele.My face warms with pleasure at her unexpected praise.I hope she doesnt notice.You obviously enjoy this, she says a little later.What?Flying.It requires control and concentration.Two qualities I most enjoy.How could I not love it?Though my favorite is soaring.Soaring?Yes.Gliding, to the layperson.Gliders and helicoptersI fly them both.Perhaps I should take her soaring?Getting ahead of yourself, Grey.And since when do you take anyone soaring?Since when do I bring anyone in Charlie Tango?ATC refocuses me on the flight path, halting my rogue thoughts as we approach the outskirts of Seattle.Were close.And Im closer to knowing whether this is a pipe dream or not.Ana is staring out the window, entranced.I cant keep my eyes off her.Please say yes.Looks good, doesnt it?I ask, so that shell turn and I can see her face.She does, with a huge cock tightening grin.Well be there in a few minutes, I add.Suddenly the atmosphere in the cabin shifts and I have a more heightened awareness of her.Breathing deeply, I inhale her scent and sense the anticipation.Anas.Mine.As we descend I take Charlie Tango through the downtown area toward Escala, my home, and my heart rate increases.Ana starts fidgeting.Shes nervous, too.I hope she doesnt flee.As the helipad comes into view, I take another deep breath.This is it.We land smoothly and I power down, watching the rotor blades slow and come to a stop.All I can hear is the hiss of white noise over our headphones as we sit in silence.I remove my cans, then remove Anas, too.Were here, I say quietly.Her face is pale in the glow of the landing lights, her eyes luminous.Sweet Lord, shes beautiful.I unbuckle my harness and reach over to undo hers.She peers up at me.Trusting.Young.Sweet.Her delicious scent is almost my undoing.Can I do this with her?Shes an adult.She can make her own decisions.And I want her to look at me this way once she knows meknows what Im capable of.You dont have to do anything you dont want to do.You know that, dont you?She needs to understand this.I want her submission, but more than that I want her consent.Id never do anything I didnt want to do, Christian.She sounds sincere and I want to believe her.With those pacifying words ringing in my head, I climb out of my seat and open the door, then jump down onto the helipad.I take her hand as she exits the aircraft.The wind whips her hair around her face, and she looks anxious.I dont know if its because shes here with me, alone, or if its because were thirty stories high.I know its a giddy feeling being up here.Come.Wrapping my arm around her to shield her from the wind, I guide her to the elevator.We are both quiet as we make the short journey to the penthouse.Shes wearing a pale green shirt beneath her black jacket.It suits her.I make a mental note to include blues and greens in the clothes Ill provide if she agrees to my terms.She should be better dressed.Her eyes meet mine in the elevators mirrors as the doors open to my apartment.She follows me through the foyer, across the corridor, and into the living room.Can I take your jacket?I ask.Ana shakes her head and clutches the lapels to emphasize that she wants to keep her jacket on.Okay.Would you like a drink?I try a different approach and decide that I need a drink to steady my nerves.Why am I so nervous?Because I want her  Im going to have a glass of white wine.Would you like to join me?Yes, please, she says.In the kitchen I slip off my jacket and open the wine fridge.A sauvignon blanc would be a good icebreaker.Pulling out a serviceable Pouilly Fum, I watch Ana peer through the balcony doors at the view.When she turns and walks back toward the kitchen I ask if shed be happy with the wine Ive selected.I know nothing about wine, Christian.Im sure it will be fine.She sounds subdued.Shit.This isnt going well.Is she overwhelmed?Is that it?I pour two glasses and walk to where she stands in the middle of my living room, looking every bit the sacrificial lamb.Gone is the disarming woman.She looks lost.Like me  Here.I hand her the glass, and she immediately takes a sip, closing her eyes in obvious appreciation of the wine.When she lowers the glass her lips are moist.Good choice, Grey.Youre very quiet, and youre not even blushing.In fact, I think this is the palest Ive ever seen you, Anastasia.Are you hungry?She shakes her head and takes another sip.Maybe shes in need of some liquid courage, too.Its a very big place you have here, she says, her voice timid.Big?Big.Its big.Theres no arguing with that; it is more than ten thousand square feet.Do you play?She looks at the piano.Yes.Well?Yes.Of course you do.Is there anything you cant do well?Yesa few things.Cook.Tell jokes.Make free and easy conversation with a woman Im attracted to.Be touched  Do you want to sit?I gesture toward the sofa.A brisk nod tells me that she does.Taking her hand, I lead her there, and she sits down, giving me an impish look.Whats so amusing?I ask, as I take a seat beside her.Why did you give me Tess of the dUrbervilles, specifically?Oh.Where is this going?Well, you said you liked Thomas Hardy.Is that the only reason?I dont want to tell her that she has my first edition, and that it was a better choice than Jude the Obscure.It seemed appropriate.I could hold you to some impossibly high ideal like Angel Clare or debase you completely like Alec dUrberville.My answer is truthful enough and has a certain irony to it.What Im about to propose I suspect will be very far from her expectations.If there are only two choices, Ill take the debasement, she whispers.Damn.Isnt that what you want, Grey?Anastasia, stop biting your lip, please.Its very distracting.You dont know what youre saying.Thats why Im here, she says, her teeth leaving little indentations on a bottom lip moist with wine.And there she is: disarming once more, surprising me at every turn.My cock concurs.We are cutting to the chase on this deal, but before we explore the details, I need her to sign the NDA.I excuse myself and head into my study.The contract and NDA are ready on the printer.Leaving the contract on my deskI dont know if well ever get to itI staple the NDA together and take it back to Ana.This is a nondisclosure agreement.I place it on the coffee table in front of her.She looks confused and surprised.My lawyer insists on it, I add.If youre going for option two, debasement, youll need to sign this.And if I dont want to sign anything?Then its Angel Clare high ideals, well, for most of the book anyway.And I wont be able to touch you.Ill send you home with Stephan, and I will try my very best to forget you.My anxiety mushrooms; this deal could all go to shit.What does this agreement mean?It means you cannot disclose anything about us.Anything, to anyone.She searches my face and I dont know if shes confused or displeased.This could go either way.Okay.Ill sign, she says.Well, that was easy.I hand her my Mont Blanc and she places the pen at the signature line.Arent you even going to read it?I ask, suddenly annoyed.No.Anastasia, you should always read anything you sign.How could she be so foolish?Have her parents taught her nothing?Christian, what you fail to understand is that I wouldnt talk about us to anyone anyway.Even Kate.So its immaterial whether I sign an agreement or not.If it means so much to you, or your lawyer, whom you obviously talk to, then fine.Ill sign.She has an answer for everything.Its refreshing.Fair point well made, Miss Steele, I note dryly.With a quick, disapproving glance, she signs.And before I can begin my pitch, she asks, Does this mean youre going to make love to me tonight, Christian?What?Me?Make love?Oh, Grey, lets disabuse her of this straightaway.No, Anastasia, it doesnt.First, I dont make love.I fuck, hard.She gasps.Thats made her think.Second, theres a lot more paperwork to do.And third, you dont yet know what youre in for.You could still run from here screaming!Come, I want to show you my playroom.Shes nonplussed, the little v forming between her brows.You want to play on your Xbox?I laugh out loud.Oh, baby.No, Anastasia, no Xbox, no PlayStation.Come.Standing, I offer her my hand, which she takes willingly.I lead her to the hallway and upstairs, where I stop outside the door to my playroom, my heart hammering in my chest.This is it.Pay or play.Have I ever been this nervous?Realizing my desires depend on the turn of this key, I unlock the door, and in that moment I need to reassure her.You can leave anytime.The helicopter is on standby to take you whenever you want to go; you can stay the night and go home in the morning.Its fine, whatever you decide.Just open the damn door, Christian, she says with a mulish expression and her arms crossed.This is the crossroads.I dont want her to run.But Ive never felt this exposed.Even in Elenas handsand I know its because she knows nothing about the lifestyle.I open the door and follow her into my playroom.My safe place.The only place where Im truly myself.Ana stands in the middle of the room, studying all the paraphernalia that is so much a part of my life: the floggers, the canes, the bed, the benchShes silent, drinking it in, and all I hear is the deafening pounding of my heart as the blood rushes past my eardrums.Now you know.This is me.She turns and gives me a piercing stare as I wait for her to say something, but she prolongs my agony and walks farther into the room, forcing me to follow her.Her fingers trail over a suede flogger, one of my favorites.I tell her what its called, but she doesnt respond.She walks over to the bed, her hands exploring, her fingers running over one of the carved pillars.Say something, I ask.Her silence is unbearable.I need to know if shes going to run.Do you do this to people or do they do it to you?Finally!People?I want to snort.I do this to women who want me to.Shes willing to have a dialogue.Theres hope.She frowns.If you have willing volunteers, why am I here?Because I want to do this with you, very much.Visions of her tied up in various positions around the room overwhelm my imagination; on the cross, on the bed, over the bench  Oh, she says, and wanders to the bench.My eyes are drawn to her inquisitive fingers stroking the leather.Her touch is curious, slow, and sensualis she even aware?Youre a sadist?she says, startling me.Fuck.She sees me.Im a Dominant, I say quickly, hoping to move the conversation on.What does that mean?she inquires, shocked, I think.It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself to me, in all things.Why would I do that?To please me, I whisper.This is what I need from you.In very simple terms, I want you to want to please me.How do I do that?she breathes.I have rules, and I want you to comply with them.They are for your benefit and for my pleasure.If you follow these rules to my satisfaction, I shall reward you.If you dont, I shall punish you, and you will learn.And I cant wait to train you.In every way.She stares at the canes behind the bench.And where does all this fit in?She waves at her surroundings.Its all part of the incentive package.Both reward and punishment.So youll get your kicks by exerting your will over me.Spot on, Miss Steele.Its about gaining your trust and your respect, so youll let me exert my will over you.I need your permission, baby.I will gain a great deal of pleasure, joy even, in your submission.The more you submit, the greater my joyits a very simple equation.Okay, and what do I get out of this?Me.I shrug.Thats it, baby.Just me.All of me.And youll find pleasure, too  Her eyes widen fractionally as she stares at me, saying nothing.Its exasperating.Youre not giving anything away, Anastasia.Lets go back downstairs where I can concentrate better.Its very distracting having you in here.I hold out my hand to her and for the first time she looks from my hand to my face, undecided.Shit.Ive frightened her.Im not going to hurt you, Anastasia.Tentatively she puts her hand in mine.Im elated.She hasnt run.Relieved, I decide to show her the submissives bedroom.If you do this, let me show you.I lead her down the corridor.This will be your room.You can decorate it how you like, have whatever you like in here.My room?Youre expecting me to move in?she squeaks in disbelief.Okay.Maybe I should have left this until later.Not full time, I reassure her.Just, say, Friday evening through Sunday.We have to talk about all that.Negotiate.If you want to do this.Ill sleep here?Yes.Not with you.No.I told you, I dont sleep with anyone, except you when youre stupefied with drink.Where do you sleep?My room is downstairs.Come, you must be hungry.Weirdly, I seem to have lost my appetite, she declares, with her familiar stubborn expression.You must eat, Anastasia.Her eating habits will be one of the first issues Ill work on if she agrees to be minethat, and her fidgeting.Stop getting ahead of yourself, Grey!Im fully aware that this is a dark path Im leading you down, Anastasia, which is why I really want you to think about this.She follows me downstairs into the living room once more.You must have some questions.Youve signed your NDA; you can ask me anything you want and Ill answer.If this is going to work, shes going to have to communicate.In the kitchen I open the fridge and find a large plate of cheese and some grapes.Gail wasnt expecting me to have company, and this is not enoughI wonder if I should order some takeout.Or perhaps take her out?Like a date.Another date.I dont want to raise expectations like that.I dont do dates.Only with her  The thought is irritating.Theres a fresh baguette in the bread basket.Bread and cheese will have to do.Besides, she says shes not hungry.Sit.I point to one of the barstools and Ana sits down and gives me a level gaze.You mentioned paperwork, she says.Yes.What paperwork?Well, apart from the NDA, a contract saying what we will and wont do.I need to know your limits, and you need to know mine.This is consensual, Anastasia.And if I dont want to do this?Shit.Thats fine, I lie.But we wont have any sort of relationship?No.Why?This is the only sort of relationship Im interested in.Why?Its the way I am.How did you become this way?Why is anyone the way they are?Thats kind of hard to answer.Why do some people like cheese and other people hate it?Do you like cheese?Mrs.Jonesmy housekeeperhas left this for a late supper.I place the plate in front of her.What are your rules that I have to follow?I have them written down.Well go through them once weve eaten.Im really not hungry, she whispers.You will eat.The look she gives me is defiant.Would you like another glass of wine?I ask, as a peace offering.Yes, please.I pour wine into her glass and sit down beside her.Help yourself to food, Anastasia.She takes a few grapes.Thats it?Thats all youre eating?Have you been like this for a while?she asks.Yes.Is it easy to find women who want to do this?Oh, if you only knew.Youd be amazed.My tone is wry.Then why me?I really dont understand.Shes utterly bemused.Baby, youre beautiful.Why wouldnt I want to do this with you?Anastasia, Ive told you.Theres something about you.I cant leave you alone.Im like a moth to a flame.I want you very badly, especially now, when youre biting your lip again.I think you have that clich the wrong way around, she says softly, and its a disturbing confession.Eat!I order, to change the subject.No.I havent signed anything yet, so I think Ill hang on to my free will for a bit longer, if thats okay with you.Ohher smart mouth.As you wish, Miss Steele.And I hide my smirk.How many women?she asks, and she pops a grape into that mouth.Fifteen.I have to look away.For long periods of time?Some of them, yes.Have you ever hurt anyone?Yes.Badly?No.Dawn was fine, if a little shaken by the experience.And if Im honest, so was I.   Will you hurt me?What do you mean?Physically, will you hurt me?Only what you can take.I will punish you when you require it, and it will be painful.For example, when you get drunk and put yourself at risk.Have you ever been beaten?she asks.Yes.Many, many times.Elena was devilishly handy with a cane.Its the only touch I could tolerate.Her eyes widen and she puts the uneaten grapes on her plate and takes another sip of wine.Her lack of appetite is irritating and is affecting mine.Perhaps I should just bite the bullet and show her the rules.Lets discuss this in my study.I want to show you something.She follows me and sits in the leather chair in front of my desk as I lean against it, arms folded.This is what she wants to know.Its a blessing that shes curiousshe hasnt run yet.From the contract laid out on my desk I take one of the pages and hand it to her.These are the rules.They may be subject to change.They form part of the contract, which you can also have.Read these rules and lets discuss.Her eyes scan the page.Hard limits?she asks.Yes.What you wont do, what I wont do, we need to specify in our agreement.Im not sure about accepting money for clothes.It feels wrong.I want to lavish money on you.Let me buy you some clothes.I may need you to accompany me to functions.Grey, what are you saying?This would be a first.And I want you dressed well.Im sure your salary, when you do get a job, wont cover the kind of clothes Id like you to wear.I dont have to wear them when Im not with you?No.Okay.I dont want to exercise four times a week.Anastasia, I need you supple, strong, and with stamina.Trust me, you need to exercise.But surely not four times a week.How about three?I want you to do four.I thought this was a negotiation?Again, shes disarming, calling me out on my shit.Okay, Miss Steele, another point well made.How about an hour on three days and one day half an hour?Three days, three hours.I get the impression youre going to keep me exercised when Im here.Oh, I hope so.Yes, I am.Okay, agreed.Are you sure you dont want to intern at my company?Youre a good negotiator.No, I dont think thats a good idea.Of course shes right.And its my number one rule: never fuck the staff.So, limits.These are mine.I hand her the list.This is it, shit or bust time.I know my limits by heart, and mentally tick off the list as I watch her read through.Her face grows paler and paler as she nears the end.Fuck, I hope this isnt frightening her off.I want her.I want her submissionbadly.She swallows, glancing nervously up at me.How can I persuade her to give this a try?I should reassure her, show her that Im capable of caring.Is there anything youd like to add?Deep down I hope she wont add anything.I want carte blanche with her.She stares at me, still at a loss for words.Its irritating.Im not used to waiting for answers.Is there anything you wont do?I prompt.I dont know.Not the response I was expecting.What do you mean you dont know?She shifts in her seat, looking uncomfortable, her teeth toying with her bottom lip.Again.Ive never done anything like this.Hell, of course she hasnt.Patience, Grey.For fucks sake.Youve thrown a great deal of information at her.I continue my gentle approach.Its novel.Well, when youve had sex, was there anything that you didnt like doing?And Im reminded of the photographer fumbling all over her yesterday.She flushes and my interest is piqued.What has she done that she didnt like?Is she adventurous in bed?She seems soinnocent.Normally I dont find that attractive.You can tell me, Anastasia.We have to be honest with each other or this isnt going to work.I really have to encourage her to loosen upshe wont even talk about sex.Shes squirming again and staring at her fingers.Come on, Ana.Tell me, I order.Sweet Lord, shes frustrating.Well, Ive not had sex before, so I dont know, she whispers.The earth stops spinning.I dont fucking believe it.How?Why?Fuck!Never?Im incredulous.She shakes her head, eyes wide.Youre a virgin?I dont believe it.She nods, embarrassed.I close my eyes.I cant look at her.How the hell did I get this so wrong?Anger lances through me.What can I do with a virgin?I glare at her as fury surges through my body.Why the fuck didnt you tell me?I growl, and start pacing my study.What do I want with a virgin?She shrugs apologetically, at a loss for words.I dont understand why you didnt tell me.The exasperation is clear in my voice.The subject never came up, she says.Im not in the habit of revealing my sexual status to everyone I meet.I mean, we hardly know each other.As ever, its a fair point.I cant believe Ive given her the bus tour of my playroomthank heavens for the NDA.Well, you know a lot more about me now, I snarl.I knew you were inexperienced, but a virgin!Hell, Ana, I just showed you  Not only the playroom: my rules, hard limits.She knows nothing.How could I do this?May God forgive me, I mutter under my breath.Im at a loss.A startling thought occurs to meour one kiss in the elevator, where I could have fucked her there and thenwas that her first kiss?Have you ever been kissed, apart from by me?Please say yes.Of course I have.She looks offended.Yeah, shes been kissed, but not often.And for some reason the thought ispleasing.And a nice young man hasnt swept you off your feet?I just dont understand.Youre twenty one, nearly twenty two.Youre beautiful.Why hasnt some guy taken her to bed?Shit, maybe shes religious.No, Welch would have uncovered that.She gazes down at her fingers, and I think shes smiling.She thinks this is funny?I could kick myself.And youre seriously discussing what I want to do, when you have no experience.Words fail me.How can this be?How have you avoided sex?Tell me, please.Because I dont get it.Shes in collegeand from what I remember of college all the kids were fucking like rabbits.All of them.Except me.The thought is a dark one, but I push it aside for the moment.Ana shrugs, her small shoulders lifting slightly.No ones really, you know She trails off.No one has what?Seen how attractive you are?No ones lived up to your expectationsand I do?Me?She really knows nothing.How could she ever be a submissive if she has no idea about sex?This is not going to flyand all the groundwork Ive done has been for nothing.I cant close this deal.Why are you so angry with me?she whispers.Of course she would think that.Make this right, Grey.Im not angry with you, Im angry at myself.I just assumed Why the hell would I be angry with you?What a mess this is.I run my hands through my hair, trying to rein in my temper.Do you want to go?I ask, concerned.No, unless you want me to go, she says softly, her voice tinged with regret.Of course not.I like having you here.The statement surprises me as I say it.I do like having her here.Being with her.Shes sodifferent.And I want to fuck her, and spank her, and watch her alabaster skin pink beneath my hands.Thats out of the question nowisnt it?Perhaps not the fuckingperhaps I could.The thought is a revelation.I could take her to bed.Break her in.It would be a novel experience for both of us.Would she want to?She asked me earlier if I was going to make love to her.I could try, without tying her up.But she might touch me.Fuck.I glance down at my watch and note the time.Its late.When I look back at her the sight of her toying with her bottom lip arouses me.I still want her, in spite of her innocence.Could I take her to bed?Would she want to, knowing what she knows about me now?Hell, I have no idea.Do I just ask her?But shes turning me on, biting her lip again.I point it out and she apologizes.Dont apologize.Its just that I want to bite it, too, hard.Her breath hitches.Oh.Maybe shes interested.Yes.Lets do this.My decision is made.Come, I offer, holding out my hand.What?Were going to rectify the situation right now.What do you mean?What situation?Your situation.Ana, Im going to make love to you, now.Oh.Thats if you want to.I mean, I dont want to push my luck.I thought you didnt make love.I thought you fucked hard, she says, her voice husky and so damned seductive, her eyes wide, pupils dilating.Shes flushed with desireshe wants this, too.And a wholly unexpected thrill unfurls inside me.I can make an exception, or maybe combine the two, well see.I really want to make love to you.Please, come to bed with me.I want our arrangement to work, but you really need to have some idea what youre getting yourself into.We can start your training tonightwith the basics.This doesnt mean Ive come over all hearts and flowersits a means to an end, but one that I want, and hopefully you do, too.The words rush out in a torrent.Grey!Get ahold of yourself.Her cheeks pink.Come on, Ana, yes or no.Im dying here.But I havent done all the things you require from your list of rules.Her voice is timid.Is she afraid?I hope not.I dont want her to be afraid.Forget about the rules.Forget about all those details for tonight.I want you.Ive wanted you since you fell into my office, and I know you want me.You wouldnt be sitting here calmly discussing punishment and hard limits if you didnt.Please, Ana, spend the night with me.I offer her my hand again, and this time she takes it, and I pull her into my arms, holding her flush against my body.She gasps with surprise and I feel her against me.The darkness is quiet, perhaps subdued by my libido.I want her.Shes so alluring.This girl confounds me, every step of the way.Ive revealed my dark secret, yet shes still here; she hasnt run.My fingers tug at her hair, pulling her face up to mine, and I gaze into captivating eyes.You are one brave young woman, I breathe.I am in awe of you.I lean down and gently kiss her, then tease her lower lip with my teeth.I want to bite this lip.I tug harder and she whimpers.My cock hardens in response.Please, Ana, let me make love to you, I whisper against her mouth.Yes, she respondsand my body lights up like the Fourth of July.Get a grip, Grey.We have no arrangement in place, no limits set, shes not mine to do with as I pleaseand yet Im excited.Aroused.Its an unfamiliar but exhilarating feeling, desire for this woman coursing through me.Im at the tipping edge of a giant roller coaster.Vanilla sex?Can I do this?Without another word I lead her out of my study, through the living room, and down the corridor to my bedroom.She follows, her hand tightly holding mine.Shit.Contraception.Im sure shes not on the pillFortunately, I have condoms for backup.At least I dont have to worry about every dick shes slept with.I release her by the bed, walk over to my chest of drawers, and remove my watch, shoes, and socks.I assume youre not on the pill.She shakes her head.I didnt think so.From the drawer I take out a packet of condoms, letting her know Im prepared.She studies me, her eyes impossibly large in her beautiful face, and I have a moments hesitation.This is supposed to be a big deal for her, isnt it?I remember my first time with Elena, how embarrassing it wasbut what a heaven sent relief.Deep down I know I should send her home.But the simple truth is, I dont want her to go, and I want her.Whats more, I can see my desire reflected in her expression, in her darkening eyes.Do you want the blinds drawn?I ask.I dont mind, she says.I thought you didnt let anyone sleep in your bed.Who says were going to sleep?Oh.Her lips form a perfect small o.  My cock hardens further.Yes, Id like to fuck that mouth, that o.  I stalk toward her like shes my prey.Oh, baby, I want to bury myself in you.Her breathing is shallow and quick.Her cheeks are rosyshes wary, but excited.Shes at my mercy, and knowing that makes me feel powerful.She has no idea what Im going to do to her.Lets get this jacket off, shall we?Reaching up, I gently push her jacket off her shoulders, fold it, and place it on my chair.Do you have any idea how much I want you, Ana Steele?Her lips part as she inhales, and I reach up to touch her cheek.Her skin is petal soft beneath my fingertips as they glide down to her chin.Shes entrancedlostunder my spell.Shes already mine.Its intoxicating.Do you have any idea what Im going to do to you?I murmur, and hold her chin between my thumb and forefinger.Leaning down, I kiss her firmly, molding her lips to mine.Returning my kiss, shes soft and sweet and willing, and I have an overwhelming need to see her, all of her.I make quick work of her buttons, slowly peeling off her blouse and letting it fall to the floor.I stand back to look at her.Shes wearing the pale blue bra that Taylor bought.Shes stunning.Oh, Ana.You have the most beautiful skin, pale and flawless.I want to kiss every single inch of it.Theres not a mark on her.The thought is unsettling.I want to see her markedpinkwith tiny, thin welts from a crop maybe.She colors a delicious roseembarrassed, no doubt.If I do nothing else, I will teach her not to be shy of her body.Reaching up, I pull her hair tie, freeing her hair.It tumbles lush and chestnut around her face, down to her breasts.Mmm, I like brunettes.Shes lovely, exceptional, a jewel.Holding her head, I run my fingers through her hair and pull her to me, kissing her.She moans against me and parts her lips, allowing me access to her warm, wet mouth.The sweet appreciative noise echoes through meto the end of my cock.Her tongue shyly meets mine, tentatively probing my mouth, and for some reason, her fumbling inexperience ishot.She tastes luscious.Wine, grapes, and innocencea potent, heady mix of flavors.I fold my arms tightly around her, relieved that she grips only my upper arms.With one hand in her hair, holding her in place, I run my other hand down her spine to her ass and push her against me, against my erection.She moans again.I continue to kiss her, coaxing her unschooled tongue to explore my mouth as I explore hers.My body tenses when she moves her hands up my armsand for a moment I worry where shell touch me next.She caresses my cheek, then strokes my hair.Its a little unnerving.But when she twists her fingers in my hair, pulling gently  Damn, that feels good.I groan in response but cant let her continue.Before she can touch me again, I push her against the bed and drop to my knees.I want her out of these jeansI want to strip her, arouse her some more, andkeep her hands off me.Grasping her hips, I run my tongue just north of the waistband up to her navel.She tenses and inhales sharply.Fuck, does she smell and taste good, an orchard in springtime, and I want my fill.Her hands fist in my hair once more; this I dont mindin fact, I like it.I nip her hipbone and her grip tightens in my hair.Her eyes are closed, her mouth slack, and shes panting.As I reach up and undo the button on her jeans, she opens her eyes and we study each other.Slowly I ease down the zipper and move my hands around her ass.Slipping my hands inside the waistband, my palms against the soft cheeks of her behind, I slide her jeans off.I cant stop myself.I want to shock hertest her boundaries right now.Not taking my eyes off hers, I deliberately lick my lips, then lean forward and run my nose up the center of her panties, inhaling her arousal.Closing my eyes, I savor her.Lord, shes enticing.You smell so good.My voice is husky with want and my jeans are becoming extremely uncomfortable.I need to take them off.Gently, I push her onto the bed and, grasping her right foot, I make quick work of removing her sneaker and sock.To tease her I run my thumbnail along her instep and she writhes gratifyingly on the bed, her mouth open, watching me, fascinated.Leaning down, I trace my tongue along her instep, and my teeth graze the little line that my thumbnail has left in its wake.She lies back on the bed, eyes closed, groaning.Shes so responsive, its delightful.Oh, Ana, what I could do to you, I whisper, as images of her writhing beneath me in my playroom flash through my mind: shackled to my four poster bed, bent over the tablesuspended from the cross.I could tease and torture her until she begged for releasethe images make my jeans even tighter.Hell.Quickly I remove her other shoe and sock, and pull off her jeans.Shes almost naked on my bed, her hair framing her face perfectly, her long, pale legs stretched out in invitation before me.I have to make allowances for her inexperience.But shes panting.Wanting.Her eyes fixed on me.Ive never fucked anyone in my bed before.Another first with Miss Steele.Youre very beautiful, Anastasia Steele.I cant wait to be inside you.My voice is gentle; I want to tease her some more, find out what she does know.Show me how you pleasure yourself, I ask, gazing intently down at her.She frowns.Dont be coy, Ana, show me.Part of me wants to spank the shyness out of her.She shakes her head.I dont know what you mean.Is she playing games?How do you make yourself come?I want to see.She remains mute.Clearly Ive shocked her again.I dont, she mutters finally, her voice breathless.
