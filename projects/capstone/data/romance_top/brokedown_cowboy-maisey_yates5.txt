Just dont use that as a pickup line, Liss said, sidestepping through the room, hoping to escape.Hoping to put a little bit of distance between herself and Connor.I do okay with the pickup lines I have, Jack said, a half smile curling his lips.Liss went into the dining room and set about doing busywork.Fanning out paper napkins, helping Jack put the beer in the ice and arranging the paper plates in various positions.Connor stuck to the kitchen, his excuse that he was babysitting the frozen pizza that was baking in the oven.She was not going to call him on the fact that a frozen pizza did not need to be babysat.If Jack thought it was weird, he didnt say anything.So he probably didnt think it was weird, because Jack almost always said something.As soon as the pizza came out of the oven, Sadie, Eli and Kate came in as if the kitchen timer had called them.After much jostling, everyone took their seats around the table, except for Connor, who was back in the kitchen taking care of something that probably didnt really need to be taken care of.But when everything settled, the only vacant chair that remained was the one to the right of Liss.Because of course, it would be assumed that she and Connor would want to sit next to each other.Or, if not want to, that they wouldnt have a problem with it.In truth, very likely no one had thought of it at all.But she had.She had a problem with it right now.Mainly because she was caught in this weird place where she wanted to run away and hide from Connor and also put her hand in his lap.Connor walked in then stopped as he saw the vacant chair next to her.Clearly, he was caught in a similar place.So maybe he just wanted to run away.He was the one who had stopped things between them last night, after all.After hed had an orgasm.Typical.I guess Ill sit next to Liss, he said, his announcement making things extra weird.You sound kind of bummed out about that, Connor, Kate said.Do you think she has cooties?No, he said, shooting a glare at Kate before he moved to the table and came to sit beside her.Their eyes met again, and she felt as if they had an actual collision.The impact of his gaze was like getting hit in the face with a brick.And much like getting hit in the face with a brick, it was impossible for her to hide her reaction.He leaned back in his chair, and his shoulder brushed hers.She swallowed hard, certain that everybody must be able to feel the tension that was wound so tight between them.Because it was obvious.It all came back to that stamp.The one that was on her forehead, advertising last nights activities.Whats the game?Eli asked, putting his hand on the deck of cards that was at the center of the table.Five card draw, Kate said.No preference, Sadie said.Because I still pretty much dont know what any of the games are.Yes, you do, Jack said.And its that kind of acting that gets us fleeced every week.I guess you should have learned by now, Sadie said, smiling sweetly.Im a slow learner when it comes to pretty faces, Jack said.Kate contorted her mouth into a sneer, sticking her tongue out.Faces like that, Jack said, winking.Dont even try it, Connor said, giving Jack a warning glare.Oh, please, Kate said, rolling her eyes.Jack just smiled.Are we going to play cards, or what?Connor asked, taking the deck of cards from beneath Elis hand and starting to deal.He went around the table, flinging out cards quickly, then placed the remaining cards back at the center of the table.Okay, lets do this.They went a few rounds, raising the pot by five and ten cents apiece each time.They played for loose change around here.But a big pot wasnt the point.It never had been.Anyone else?Jack asked.I call, Kate said.Me, too, Sadie said.Call, Eli said.Call, she and Connor said at the same time, their unison annoying her.Cards down, Jack said.Royal flush.Suck it.Jack always talked like that, especially during cards.But for some reason, his little comments and double entendres had become very, very apparent today.Okay, not for some reason.She knew exactly the reason.Because last night, she had been sucking it.And so tonight, when Jack said things like that, all she could do was imagine sucking it again.She felt her face getting hot, and she knew that her cheeks were red.Its just a card game, Liss, Jack said.Relax.Dont look so much like you want to tear my throat out with your teeth.She realized that she was still clutching her cards, and that everyone was staring at her.She put them down.I dont have anything, she said, her words tumbling out quickly.I knew I would end up with all your money, Jack said, pulling the pot toward him.Just one more game, Connor said, then I need to get some sleep.Rough night?Eli asked.Liss knew that Eli was not implying anything, and she knew that Eli didnt know anything.But it did not stop the heat in her face from intensifying.No, it was fine.Why would you ask that?Connor asked.Youre kind of twitchy, Eli said.And grumpy.Im always grumpy, Connor said.If Connor was grumpy, Liss hadnt noticed, because she had been too busy being wrapped up in her own blanket of awkwardness.True, Kate said.He is always grumpy.See?Im a professional asshole.But you do make great pizza, Jack said, taking a slice from the pan at the center of the table.Yeah, Im very proficient at opening cardboard boxes.How is it youre still single?Jack asked.Connor tensed, a muscle in his jaw ticking.Because my wife is dead.Silence settled over the room.Eli shifted uncomfortably while Sadie looked to him as if pleading for him to solve the mess that had just landed in front of them.Kate looked straight ahead, her gaze fixed, her eyes glittering.Like she might cry.Jack cleared his throat.Shit, dude.I was just teasing.I wasnt thinking.No, I know you werent thinking.Why would you?Its been three years.Should be over it.No, you shouldnt, Jack said.Im an ass.Right then, Liss felt the hole at the table.The empty space where Jessie had been.Her pretty friend, whose laugh could fill up a whole room.Jessie, who had been so lovely that Liss could never hate her, even when shed married the man of Lisss dreams.And thinking of her now...it made her want to curl into a ball and cry.She was gone, and that hurt.It was also a reminder of everything that stood between her and Connor.Not just a friendship, but a grief that was still bigger than both of them.You know what?Im really tired.Im going to bed.She stood up and walked out of the room, feeling shaky, feeling weak.What was her problem?She was acting like a child.And everybody was going to think she was crazy.Especially since shed been nuts through half of the game.And now Connor had gotten his feelings hurt, and she was acting like it was about her.She just needed a shower.And to sleep.One night hadnt dealt with their mistakes.Maybe another night would.* * * CONNOR STARED DOWN at the center of the table, not quite sure what had just happened.I think the party is over tonight, he said, pushing himself up.I probably need to go talk to her.Im sorry, Connor.Jack looked genuinely remorseful, which was so unusual for him that Connor didnt have it in him to be mad at all.Just annoyed that everything made him think of the past.That even when well meaning townspeople werent taking him back there with their sympathetic comments, he brought himself back there.That he couldnt let go, because he didnt want to.Even though he did.Basically, he had too many damn feelings for a man who didnt like dealing with feelings.Dont be.No, do be, Eli said.I dont know whats going on, he said, turning his attention to Connor, but go fix it.Yeah, Connor said, nodding at his brother.He wasnt going to pretend that nothing was happening between him and Liss, because even if they wouldnt guess theyd crossed the line last night, things were obviously tense.Hell, if they werent tense, she wouldnt have stormed out like that.Kate, feel free to take the pizza.Thanks, she said, picking up the pan that still had a quarter of a pie on it.Is that my punishment?Jack asked.I dont get the pizza?Yes, now go home and think about what you did, Kate said, grinning unrepentantly.Or Ill follow you home and eat your pizza, Jack said.Better not, Kate said, or Ill mess up your pretty boy face something good.She probably will, Sadie said.Shes very serious about pizza.Eli jerked his head in the direction of the door.Come on, lets go.He wasnt wearing his uniform today, but his tone certainly was, and Jack and Kate rushed to obey.Sadie lingered, a line deepening between her brows, her lips turned down into a frown.It was that look he often got.Worry wrapped in sympathy.But coming from Sadie it didnt gall as much as it did from others.She reached out and put her hand on his shoulder.Are you okay?He looked at her.As okay as I ever am.Thats what worries me.Youre never all that okay, are you?He thought back to last night, to the moments of pure, heady sexual desire that hadnt been tied to anything heavy or sad.Thats not true, he said.Sometimes Im drunk.Connor, she said, pure censure lacing her tone.Dont joke like that.You really are like having another sister.Thats not a compliment, he said, but it was.Yeah, I try.I also worry.Whats up with Liss?I dont know.Which was partly true.But Im going to find out.She was really good friends with your wife, wasnt she?She was.I wish I couldve known her.Because with as much as you all loved her, I know I would have, too.You would have, he said.She was very organized.She took great care of me.Probably a little bit too great.Probably why Im such a big baby now.You arent a baby.But you are in pain.If you ever need anything, you can talk to me.I was a professional at this in another life.Also, I care about you.Emotion tightened his chest, and he cleared his throat, trying to get rid of it.Thanks, Sadie.I probably wont take you up on that.But it means something that you offered.Sadie forced a laugh.At least youre honest.He lifted a shoulder.Sometimes.Good night, Connor.Good luck.Sadie turned and left, closing the door behind her.Connor let out a long breath and looked around at the mess on the table.He would have to deal with it later.For now he had to deal with the mess that was between him and his best friend.He walked out of the dining room and up the stairs, then down the hall to Lisss room.He thought about knocking then just opened the door.Liss was sitting on the end of her bed, her forearms resting on her thighs.She looked up at him, a bleak expression on her face.Did everyone leave?Yeah, he said, crossing the room and sitting down next to her on the bed.Whats up?I dont know.Today was weird.He laughed, not really because it was funny, but because he was relieved that she was admitting it.Relieved that they werent going to ignore what had happened anymore.It was so freaking weird.Because last night was weird.And then Jack made that comment.And I realized that you arent over what happened.Of course you arent.Why would you be?But I wanted...I want to fix it.And I cant.Connor rubbed his hands over his face then rested them on his thighs.I want to apologize about last night, but you got mad at me for apologizing already.I will accept an apology about last night as a whole.He let out a heavy sigh.Im sorry.Im screwing this up.Im screwing everything up.I dont know if Im more sorry that I crossed that line with you, or more sorry about the way I finished it.But I basically sucked.No, that was me, remember?He laughed again.Do you have to go making inappropriate jokes right now?Is there a better time to make inappropriate jokes?Im already mortally embarrassed.How much worse could it get?Im embarrassed.I cant believe that I. ..He leaned forward, resting his forearms on his thighs, matching Lisss position.Okay, I have to tell you something.And Ive never told anyone this before, mainly because...Well, youve never asked and I wouldnt tell Jack under penalty of death.Also, Eli is my brother and we dont talk about this shit.But Ive only been with one woman.He wasnt embarrassed by the fact that his wife was the only woman hed slept with.It just wasnt something hed ever had to share before.But he wanted to explain to Liss why all of this felt like a huge deal.Only...Youve only ever slept with Jessie, Liss said.Right.I liked her from the beginning.And I waited until she was ready.And I was never with anyone else.I never wanted to be.He looked down at his hands.Going out and hooking up has never been me.Its not who I am.Its not what I do.But dammit, I am so sick of being celibate.Obviously, I have a little bit of sexual frustration that Im dealing with.Liss looked down and picked at the edge of her fingernail.So Im the result of your sexual frustration boiling over?Hell, Liss, I dont know.Thats part of why I freaked out when I kissed you in the barn.Because I cant tell you why this is happening.And if you like, thats a terrible thing to say to your friend right after you kiss her.I feel like its a terrible thing to kiss your friend just because youre sexually frustrated.And its an even worse thing to let your friend do what you did just because its been three years since a woman has touched you.He rubbed his hands over his face.And I just dont know.I just know that things are different.And I know Im not ready for them to be different.I know Im not ready to want someone else.But I do.Is it the worst thing to want me?Her voice was small, timid, and he hated the note of insecurity that wound through it, because he was afraid he had put it there.In some ways, kind of.Because I dont want anything but sex and friendship.Not touching and in completely separate corrals.And Im not sure thats possible.Why not?Because Ive never done it before.Neither have I.  Ive had two semiserious relationships, so it isnt like my list of experience is a lot longer than yours.Though I have given a blow job before.Did you have to bring that up?Im fascinated.It feels wrong to talk about it.Okay, regardless of where we go from here, we just have to deal with the fact that I have gone down on you.No take backs.And, as the first bestower of oral sex upon you, I sort of want to know why youve never had it before.He straightened, letting his head fall back.Liss, you are killing me.Am I making you blush?Or something, he said, battling with the extreme embarrassment that was swirling around with arousal, making his gut feel unsettled.Theres no room for you to be embarrassed about this topic.Once youve done it with someone, you have to be able to talk about it.He gritted his teeth and clasped his hands together.Especially now that she was gone, he didnt like to say anything bad about Jessie.And while this wasnt technically bad, it felt slightly like a complaint.And that felt wrong.But Liss was right.She had given him his first blow job and was therefore entitled to details of some kind.And blow job or not, she was his best friend.He didnt talk to very many people.Hell, he didnt really talk to anyone.Didnt he owe her this?Honesty?She just didnt ever want to, he said.She very early on told me she thought that was gross.Granted, we were in high school, and I was trying to talk her into doing things that werent going all the way.But that was her stance.And that was the stance she kept through all of our years of dating, and eight years of marriage.Silence settled over them like an itchy blanket.But then, what did you say after something like that?There wasnt anyplace good to go.Finally, Liss cleared her throat.Okay, I think my curiosity is satisfied.But for the record, its not gross.He shifted, feeling like an absolute ass, because his cock was getting hard while they were discussing this.Good to know.Im saying that because I feel like thats part of why you freaked out afterward.Because you were worried I would be disgusted.But I wasnt.I did that because I wanted to.Because I think...I think youre sexy.You must realize that.I wouldnt have done any of that if I didnt.You think Im sexy?Connor, Im not going to make out with a guy I dont think is hot.Or...other things.Oh, definitely not other things.So, he said, shifting position on the bed, what do we do?Do we just try to let things go back to how they were?Do we try to forget that this happened?Well, we tried that after we kissed in the barn.Then ten minutes later we made out on the porch and went further on the couch.Then we spent the entire day avoiding each other.So Im not sure thats going to work.So the alternative is what?Liss shrugged.Having sex, I guess.Connor nearly choked on his tongue.You cant just say things like that.I just did.Look, we are in close proximity, and its obviously bringing things up.Some things literally, she said, looking pointedly at his lap.And...like you said, you want to have sex, but youre not ready to go out and hook up with somebody random, because for you sex has always been intimate.Well, its always been that way for me, too.But I think between us, even though our connection is friendship, we have intimacy thats already built in.And maybe the thing with you is just psychological.Youve only been with one woman, so the second one feels like a big deal.Plus, the first woman after your wife is always going to feel like a big deal.So...this might make it easier.And then youll be able to kind of move forward.He was pretty sure his dick was doing all of his thinking, because what she said made a strange kind of sense.Just a few months ago hed told Eli he never wanted to have sex again.And a few months ago he had believed that.But now he knew that wasnt true.He was going to have to deal with a whole heap of personal crap before he did.Maybe this was a way to have his cake and eat it, too.I dont want to ruin our friendship, he said.What she said made sense, but he still wasnt convinced.I dont, either, she said.But we already crossed the line.We already started this.We cant go back and forget it happened.Wouldnt it be better to just try to make it work for you?Her words sent a spark of discomfort along his veins.The kind he felt when townspeople showed up at his door with food and sad eyes.And he didnt like it one bit.You want to make this work for me?What about you?What do you mean what about me?I am not going to be a pity fuck, Liss.He felt like an ass the minute he said the words, because Lisss face turned bright red, and she looked away from him as if hed just flashed her on Main Street.Im tired of pity.Ive had too much of it.I dont want casserole sex.Im genuinely insulted that you would compare my sexual skill to casserole, which I know you hate.That isnt what I meant.What I meant is its one of those things that people only give you when youre sad.Kind of like when your best friend gives you a blow job on your couch.A couch blow job is totally not the same thing as a casserole.I just dont get whats in it for you.You just dont get that I think youre sexy as hell and that I want to sleep with you?Just when he thought Liss couldnt shock him anymore, she managed to lay the verbal equivalent of wrapping his hand around hot wire on him.Since when do you want to sleep with me?he asked.Its one of those things.It comes and goes, she said.No way, baby, that doesnt fly.Baby?Youre calling me baby now just because I felt you up?she asked.You did a lot more than that, and you know it.And Ill baby you if I feel like it.Give me an answer.Youre so demanding, she said.You dont mind, he said, shifting his position slightly on the bed.No, I dont.She took a deep breath.I dont want you to doubt our friendship because of this.So dont freak out.But Ive been attracted to you off and on for a long time.Like, long time.But we were friends, and you were dating Jessie.So you know, you starred in some rather formative fantasies of mine, but that was it.I never wanted to compromise what we had.Or what I had with Jessie.But if its on the table now?Then yeah, I want it.And trust me when I say its not because I feel sorry for you.I dont know how to have this conversation.Its a terrible conversation for a lot of reasons, Liss said.But either we have the conversation or we continue unsuccessfully ignoring it.And eventually one of us is just going to blurt out what happened in the middle of a poker game.Kate would die of embarrassment.Jack would never let us hear the end of it.In fact, Jack would probably ask why Ive never done the same for him.Eli would be too nice to say anything.Eli would be too nice to say anything to you.Whatever, Ill take it.Can you imagine how asinine everyone would be if they knew?Oh, I need one thing to be very clear, she said.They must never know.That suited him just fine.He wanted for himself and Liss to be able to go back to being best friends when all of this madness was over.And that meant the fewer people who knew, the better.That meant only the two of them could ever know.You cannot tell Jack, she said.He would be the biggest, most obnoxious frat bro about it Connor cut her words off with a kiss, deciding this was as good a moment as any.His heart was raging fast, his hands shaking, his whole body shaking from the inside out.Liss grabbed the front of his shirt, pulling him closer to her, and he pushed forward, letting them go down backward onto the mattress, settling over her body.This was Liss, his friend.Hed touched her a thousand times, his hands brushing against hers, fingertips meeting as theyd passed things between them, but he had never touched her like this.Connor.She sighed, arching against him, parting her thighs and letting him settle between them.This was Liss.Hed heard her say his name more times than he could count, with a giggle in her voice, in anger, and happiness.But he had never heard her say it like this, thick with pleasure, with need.She wanted something that only he could give her right now, and that feeling, that realization, sent a shock of desire through him so sharp, so intense, it nearly buckled his knees, even though he was already lying down.This was Liss, and he was damn glad it was.* * * LISS FRAMED CONNORS FACE with her hands, kissing him back, deeply, passionately.Frantically.She couldnt believe this was happening.Could not believe that he wanted this, too.Finally.After so long.After so many years of fantasy, he wanted her, too.He groaned and shifted, pressing a kiss to her jaw, and her eyes started to sting.She was going to cry.She didnt want to cry.She squeezed her eyes shut tight, fought against the wave of emotion that was swelling inside her.He pushed his hands beneath her shirt before taking it up over her head.She lifted her arms, helping it go smoothly.Because she really was anxious to get naked with him.They hadnt been naked together yet.The very realization that they were about to sent a shiver through her.Yes, she had taken him into her mouth, but this was a new level of intimacy.A skin to skin they hadnt shared before.She pulled his shirt over his head, sliding her hands over his bare back, relishing the feel of his muscle definition beneath her fingertips.Connor Garrett, I should have gotten you naked a long time ago, she said, moving her hands down his back and cupping his ass.I guess weve just been waiting for the right time.Timing is a bitch.Not right at this second.Shes being pretty sweet.A half smile curved Lisss lips, and she brought her hands around to the front of his belt, undoing the buckle as quickly as possible before shoving his jeans down his lean hips.Now she had him completely naked.Just like she wanted him.And now she needed to be naked, too.As if he were some kind of mind reader, his hands went to the snap on her jeans, opening it, the brush of his fingers against her stomach so erotic it almost pushed her over the edge then and there.Then he gripped the tab on the zipper, drawing it down slowly, and she trembled.She had never trembled during sex before.But then, she had never had sex with Connor before.He hooked his thumbs in the waistband of her jeans, his rough skin abrading her thighs as he drew them down, taking her panties with them.He leaned back, his eyes intent on her.Fuck, he said.Your vocabulary has become very limited recently, she said, her voice breathless.I blame you.He leaned in, pressing a kiss to the inside of her knee, moving up to the sensitive skin of her thigh.Hey, Liss?he asked.What?she asked, anticipation knotting unbearably in her stomach.Remember when we made that rope swing at the creek?He moved his hand down her thigh, parting her legs a little bit more, leaning in, pressing a kiss a little bit higher.She did not get why he was stopping to engage in story time.Not now.Not when she was liking so very much where this was going.And you were scared, but I told you it would be fun, he continued.And you said you had never done it before, but I said you just had to take a chance.And you did, and you screamed and screamed.But in the end, you told me you loved it.Oh, yes, she knew that swing.That summer.And the summer years later when shed wept her heart out over losing him.She knew that swing well.Thats a really great story, and its a nice memory.I do recall.But Im not sure why youre telling me now.He kissed her again, higher on her thigh, and she trembled.For a couple of reasons.He moved his fingertips along her sensitive skin, perilously close to where she was aching for his touch.Ive never done this, but I know Im going to have fun.And Im pretty sure, just like when you rode that swing, youre gonna scream.Liss was pretty sure she was going to spontaneously combust then and there.She may have already done it.She might be nothing more than a little Liss shaped pile of ashes.She was trying to process too many things at once.He had never done this before, either; he was going to do it now; he wanted to make her scream...And then he lowered his head, sliding his tongue over her clit, a low sound rumbling in his chest.And she lost all ability to think entirely.She looked down, the sight of his dark head in between her thighs the most erotic thing shed ever seen in her life.She was so very aware that it was Connor, that it was her best friend, the man she had always wanted.And what he lacked in experience, he certainly made up for in enthusiasm.He tasted her with deep, long strokes, holding tightly to her hips, drawing her toward his mouth as he did.He lapped at her like she was ice cream on a hot day, trying desperately to get every last drop before it melted entirely.And she was definitely close to melting.He teased the entrance to her body with a fingertip before sliding in deep, continuing to lavish pleasure on her with his mouth as he did.Forget enthusiasm, he was just good at this.He added a second finger, increasing the rhythm of the strokes of his tongue, and everything went bright, like the sun through the trees on a hot summer day.And she was flying.Just like she had on the rope swing.And hell, yes, she screamed.And when she came back to herself, Connor was right there with her, kissing her lips now, his cock hard against her hip.Not only had he been enthusiastic, and very, very good, he had enjoyed it.She could feel the very irrefutable evidence of that.Condoms.We need those, he said.Yes, she said, barely able to force words to her throat.Those.I. ..My bathroom?I have no idea, she said, feeling helpless and just plain irritated.If theyd come this far only to be stopped by a lack of contraception, she would have to go ahead and give the universe a serious talking to.They expire, dont they?he asked, his tone dire.She groaned.Yeah, they do.Great.Ill just go check that.You dont have any...She shook her head, holding back a weird, inappropriate giggle.She didnt know why, as turned on as she was, as concerned as she was about the condoms, as slightly awkward as she felt, she wanted to laugh.I dont have any.I havent been with anyone since Marshall.And along with the truck, he took the condoms.He took your four wheel drive and your safe sex?What a bastard.In his defense, condoms are pretty cheap.I just havent needed them.Shortsighted.He kissed her, getting up from the bed.Ill be right back.Liss lay flat on her back, her arms up above her head, her breathing irregular, her heart thundering fast.She couldnt believe that had happened.She could not believe this was happening.More than that, she couldnt believe how right it felt.Sure, there was going to be awkwardness later, she knew that.There had been awkwardness every step of the way as theyd started down this road.The aftermath of the kiss had been awkward; the aftermath of the first bit of serious intimacy had been awkward, and this was going to sting in the morning.But all things considered, it was easy to be naked with him.Easier than it had ever been with anyone else.He returned a moment later, holding a box.He was still naked, and she couldnt stop staring.Could not believe that he was walking across the room as bare as the day he was born right in front of her.After so many years of waiting to see him like this, she felt as if there should be fanfare.In the absence of fanfare, though, she would just stare.Theyre still good.Not for much longer, but they are still good, he said.Im very encouraged by this.Because my only other option was going to ask Eli, or driving to town.You would not have gone to ask Eli.I wouldve had to send you.It wouldve been less shocking, and you couldve pretended you had someone else here, he said.You cannot send the girl to get condoms.Im pretty sure thats some kind of Round Table, King Arthurs knights, courtly love shit.If it had been a serious emergency, I wouldve had to send you.He pulled a plastic packet out of the box.Fortunately, we are covered.Well, you arent.Yet.She sat up, scooting to the edge of the bed and holding out her hand.You want the honors?he asked, one eyebrow raised in a very Connor sort of expression.Any excuse to get my hands on you.He closed his eyes and let his head fall back, and she snatched the condom from his hand.I havent even touched you yet tonight, she said, looking at the pained expression on his face.It just feels so good that you want to, he said.Her heart crumpled a little bit.You know how much I want peanut butter and chocolate.Like all the time.Yes, he said, his eyes locked with hers.I want this more.I want you more.She tore open the packet and positioned the protection over the head of him, rolling it down his hard length, her breath hissing through her teeth as arousal tore through her.Seriously, I would give up Reeses peanut butter cups forever to have this.He growled, and suddenly she found herself flat on her back, and Connor was kissing her as though it was more important than his next breath.She laced her fingers through his hair, and he grabbed a hold of her wrists with one hand, holding them together and lifting them above her head as he deepened the kiss.She gasped as he settled between her thighs, the blunt head of his erection probing the soft entrance to her body.And suddenly she just wanted to stop everything, to stop time so that she could be here for a moment longer.About to experience the one thing she had fantasized about more than anything else.Being with Connor.Actually being with him.Having him inside her.She was going to know what it was like in just a few seconds.Have every question answered about him.What it was like to feel him inside her.And she just didnt feel prepared.She almost felt terrified.But she wasnt going to stop him, wasnt going to stop this.She arched her back, her breasts pressing against his chest as he pushed deeper inside her.Buried himself to the hilt.She kept her eyes locked with his, kept the connection between them.He flexed his hips, retreating slightly before thrusting hard into her, closing his eyes.And she got lost in the rhythm, in the moment, in him.She watched his face as he moved inside her then looked over and saw his forearm, his muscles straining as he held her wrists above her head still, his tattoo rippling and flexing with each movement.The tattoo.The tattoo she had been dying to touch.And he was holding her hands so she still couldnt.She angled her head, parted her lips and traced one of the vines etched there in dark ink with the tip of her tongue.He shivered, a harsh sound escaping his lips.Liss, he said, you have to be careful.I dont want to be careful.I want it all.Still holding her wrists tight with one hand, he put his other hand beneath her ass and lifted her up, increasing the momentum behind his movements.She arched against him, meeting his every thrust.Pleasure bloomed low, intense, in her stomach.She was not a multiorgasmic girl, at least not usually.But she had a feeling she was going to be tonight.The back of her hands hit the headboard, the intensity of Connors movements pushing them both back against the hard wooden surface, the brass detailing biting into her knuckles, her hair catching beneath one of the edges and tugging a bit.But she didnt care.She didnt care about anything but the driving need to find her release.He thrust deep, rolling his hips, and she braced her hand on his chest, felt his heart hammering beneath her touch.She opened her eyes and looked at him, at his expression, his eyes squeezed shut, his jaw clenched tight.Connor.Her Connor.Lost in her.She looked away, shutting her eyes.Unable to deal with the intensity of looking at him.And he pushed into her one last time.Pleasure exploded behind her eyelids, and she felt as if she was lying down outside on a sunny day again, flashes of light popping through the trees, leaving bright colored spots in her vision.He lowered his head, his forehead pressed against hers, his lips just a whisper away.And then his big, muscular frame shook, a deep, low sound reverberating in his chest as he froze, his cock pulsing inside her as he found his own release.He rolled away from her, lying on his back.She felt cold, freezing, with the warmth of his body removed from hers.But she didnt know what she should do next.Didnt know if it was okay for her to hold on to him like he was a lover.If she should talk to him like he was a friend.Because they had agreed on sex, sex to help them get over his hang ups, and she didnt think cuddling was included in that kind of therapy.Of course, it wasnt like there was a handbook.There should be a handbook.Maybe after this she would write one.How To Have Sex With Your Best Friend Without Losing Your Mind.At least, she hoped that after this she would be qualified to write that book.If not, it would mean she had lost her mind, and possibly her friend.But no, she wouldnt think that.Ill be right back, he said, getting off the bed and walking out of her room, leaving her there by herself.She debated the wisdom of scrambling to get her clothes on and going after him.But he had said he would be back.The last thing he wanted was her getting all clingy on him.The last thing she wanted was her getting all clingy on him.But she felt clingy.She gritted her teeth and rolled onto her stomach, burying her face in her pillow, fighting back the tears that were starting to build behind her eyelids.This was supposed to be about dealing with Connor lust; this was not supposed to be about feelings.She didnt want to have feelings for him.She had done her best to let go of those over the years.He had married one of her best friends.He remained one of her best friends.And those things are far too valuable to mess up.They still were.Just when she was starting to think that he was not coming back, he walked back through the door and crossed the room quickly, getting back into bed.She almost sighed with relief when he climbed in beside her.I just realized I didnt ask if I could sleep with you, he said.You can, she said, her throat tightening, her chest aching.I might just stay for a while, he said.She nodded wordlessly, knowing that he probably couldnt see the gesture.He didnt speak, and neither did she, not for a long time.They didnt hold each other; they simply lay next to each other, naked, in bed together, an intimacy that they had never shared before.Finally, she turned over onto her side so that she was facing him.She stared through the thin darkness, broken up by the full moon outside, at his profile, at his arm, which was raised up over his head.At his tattoo.Shed touched it now.A very specific fantasy now fulfilled.She hadnt just touched it; shed licked it.Because hellfire and brimstone, that man made her want things that went way past logical.Way past civilized.But it hadnt satisfied everything.No, she still wanted more.Needed more.She imagined that would always be the case.She lay there for a moment, her heart still thundering hard.And then she decided to go ahead and push.She had never asked him about the tattoo.Because it felt like a bridge too far.But here and now, with all of their skin out in the open, it seemed like maybe some other things could come out in the open, too.What does your tattoo mean?There was nothing but silence for a moment.Its a pretty shitty story, he said, his tone strained.Yeah, I had a feeling.And thats what you want to talk about right now?Its either that or the weather.Or we talk about how amazing the sex was.Im okay with talking about how amazing the sex was, he said.Her face got hot, and she felt silly.Stupid.Like some inexperienced girl instead of a woman in her thirties.What was it about Connor that made her feel that way?How did a man she knew better than anyone else on earth make things feel so new and scary?It didnt make sense.Was it amazing?She cleared her throat.I mean, for you.Obviously, for me it was amazing.Do you really have to ask?Im asking.So obviously I had to.Yes, it was amazing.But that kind of feels like a stupid thing to say.Like its not enough.I dont know what to say about it.Thats not stupid.It makes me feel good.I think I can do better, though.Its like...like you woke part of me up again.Like Im waking up.Im glad.Silence settled between them.Jessie really liked her flowers.She always did, he said, his voice rough.She swallowed hard, her stomach clamping down tight.It was strange to hear him talk about his wife when they were in bed together.To hear him talk about the friend she never would have betrayed this way, if shed lived.I know she did.It was all Liss could think to say.A few weeks before the accident she went out of town for a few days to visit her parents.She told me to make sure that I watered her roses.I said I would, but then I didnt think about it again, because it didnt have anything to do with the ranch, and they werent necessary, at least not to my mind.So I went about my business, and when she came back, they were dead.She was furious.She said I never listened when things were important to her.That I didnt take her seriously.That I didnt care about her.And none of that was true, but...I was so wrapped up in the ranch.I just didnt think.It wasnt just the roses.They were just one thing.One in a long line of mistakes I made that showed I thought a lot more about this place than I thought about her.Thats not true, Connor, she said.You loved her.I did.I do.But sometimes I didnt show it.He paused.I was going to change.I was going to do better.For her.For us.And she died.He lowered his arm, held it in front of him, tracing the intricate lines in blossoms etched into his skin.These are Jessies roses, he said, his voice strangled.I got this because this way, I havent let her roses die.CONNOR HAD NO IDEA how he had gone from the throes of the most intense sexual release of his life to confiding his most intense regret and shame.And all with the same person.On the bright side, the general confusion was working to defuse the horror, fear and realization that now he had seen his best friends tits, he would never be able to unsee them, that he had no doubt would rear their ugly heads soon enough.Like a giant Hydra made of awful and awkward.There was no fighting that thing.Every time he cut off one of the heads, the fact that he had seen Liss naked would grow back ever larger.You have to get a grip.Because if you dont, youre going to fuck up the most meaningful relationship you have.Which was really par for the course with him.His tattoo was a reminder of that.And now Liss knew it.So at least she wouldnt be surprised when he handled all of this less than gracefully.Not that she wouldve been, anyway.They had known each other for too long for her to expect him to start spouting poetry right now.I dont know what to say, Liss said, her voice muffled.I have a knack for killing conversation.Earlier tonight was kind of exhibit A.  That was Jacks fault.No, it wasnt.I dont expect everybody to think of my tragic backstory every time they open their mouths around me.Actually, I would prefer if they didnt, so pulling crap like I did earlier runs counter to my objective.We all have a tendency to be our own worst enemies.Oh, Im well aware of that.He had a feeling he had become his own nemesis tonight.And yet he was having a difficult time regretting it.He sucked in a sharp breath, his ab muscles tightening as Liss placed her fingertips on his forearm, slowly tracing the outline of one of the roses that was inked into his skin.She knew.She knew how much you loved her.I dont think she did, he said.No, I know she didnt.Because I didnt know.Marriage is...Its long.I didnt fully appreciate that before I actually got married.But I dont know that anyone does.And at first it feels hard.The newness wears off, and then youre just living with this person whos around all the time.Eventually it gets easier.You settle into a routine.But at some point you settle in so deep you can go for days living in the same house, sleeping in the same bed, hardly saying a word to each other.It gets comfortable.Thats one of the beautiful things about marriage.But its one of the dangerous things, too.He took a deep breath, trying to ease the tension in his chest.He never talked about this stuff.He didnt really like thinking about it at all.But they were already talking about his tattoo, so they might as well just have the talk and get it over with.There wasnt really anything about tonight that could carry over into tomorrow morning.That made it a safe space.And he was going to take advantage of that.Its weird.I swear to God, Liss, I could go a whole day without thinking very much about her when she lived here.I didnt feel her presence.I was so damned used to it.But I felt it when she was gone.I had no idea emptiness was so fucking heavy.How can it be when its nothing?But it is.Thats life, though, Connor.We take things for granted.Because we cant always have perspective.Yeah, well, why the hell not?It doesnt absolve me, just because other people do it, too.Doesnt fix anything.Neither does guilt.Oh, thanks.I guess Ill just be done with that, then.Stop it, she said, her voice faintly chastising, her fingers still moving over his skin.This new intimacy was a strange thing.They had never been into casual touching.And now they were lying next to each other, completely naked.But more notable was the fact that she was just touching his forearm because she could.Because a line that had been drawn between them for years had been suddenly erased.Im trying to help.I know.So dont be such a grumpy bastard.He rolled onto his side, and the motion shook her hand from his forearm.He could see her skin clearly thanks to the pale moonlight filtering through the window.Could make out the outline of her nipples, see the dark shadow at the apex of her thighs.And it occurred to him then that he was in bed with his best friend, only the second woman to ever touch his body, only the second woman hed ever been inside, and he was talking about his wife.That feeling of being out of time, of being in a safe zone, vanished as a wave of reality washed over him.With that revelation came the feeling of being something more than naked.As though he hadnt just removed his clothes, but peeled back his skin, as well, exposing the contents of his chest.As though everything had been dragged out into the open.His guts, and not a whole lot of glory.He pushed himself into a sitting position and swung his legs over the side of the bed.Connor?I need to go to bed, he said, standing.You can stay in here.No, he couldnt.That was nonnegotiable.But he didnt say that; he didnt say anything.He didnt even stop to collect his clothes.He just walked toward the bedroom door and wrenched it open, stumbling out into the hall.He paused for a second, hoping that Liss wouldnt come after him.She didnt.Which, he supposed, was the benefit of conducting your ill advised sexual encounter with someone who knew you so well.Something in his chest twisted hard and tugged down, just about dropping him to his knees.This had gone beyond what he felt ready to deal with.At least it had gone past what he felt ready to deal with while sober.He went down the hall and down the stairs, not caring that he still wasnt dressed.The only person who was here to see it had already seen it.Because he had gone and made one of the worst decisions he couldve possibly made.This was the wrong time to have that revelation.After hed already done it.Now that his dick had gone to sleep, his brain was back in action.And his brain knew that he was a dumb ass.He walked through the living room and into the kitchen, opening up the cupboard and taking out his bottle of Jack Daniels.Then he opened up the cupboard next to it and took out a glass.He bent down, bracing himself on the counter, one hand in front of the glass, the other in front of the bottle, as he stared at both.His heart was hammering hard, his stomach so tight he could barely breathe.He didnt feel as though hed betrayed Jessie.Because she was dead, and he wasnt stupid.That was when your marriage vows ended, after all.But he did feel as if he betrayed Liss.More than that, he felt as if hed jumped into the river with both feet without bothering to learn to swim first.His chest was crowded with emotions.Worry slithering around in his brain like a pissed off rattlesnake.And much like dealing with a rattlesnake, reaching in to try to manage that mess would probably be fatal.He straightened and took the cap off the bottle.He knew this wouldnt solve his problems.It never did.It gave him oblivion, and the next day gave him a headache, but it didnt solve his problems.Not permanently.All it did was provide a nice little window of time where he could forget he had any.He wrapped his fingers around the bottle, squeezed it tight.Then he picked it up and poured a generous amount into the glass, putting it back down and screwing the lid back on, shoving it back against the wall.If he didnt drink, then everything would just keep growing.The feelings in his chest would just keep expanding until he exploded, his thoughts turning around until they drove him nuts.And who was he going to talk to about it?Eli?Certainly not Liss.Not now.Not now that she was a part of the torrential wave of crap he was dealing with.It isnt like you ever talk to her about it, anyway.He ignored his voice of reason and picked up the glass, raising it to his lips.He tipped it back, the amber liquid touching his lips, the promise of sleep and peace so close he could taste it.And it tasted like damn good whiskey.Completely without his permission, an image of Lisss face swam in front of his vision.
