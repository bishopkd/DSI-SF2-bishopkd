My only other options were the couch or the recliner.Travis grinned and shook his head.Dont you trust me by now?Ill be on my best behavior, I swear, he said, holding up fingers that I was sure the Boy Scouts of America had never considered using.I didnt argue, I simply turned away and lay my head on the pillow, tucking the covers behind me so there was a clear barrier between his body and mine.Goodnight, Pigeon, he whispered into my ear.I could feel his minty breath on my cheek, giving rise to goose bumps on every inch of my flesh.Thank God it was dark enough that he couldnt see my embarrassing reaction, or the flush of my cheeks that followed.It seemed like I had just closed my eyes when I heard the alarm.I reached over to turn it off, but wrenched back my hand in horror when I felt warm skin beneath my fingers.I tried to recall where I was.When the answer hit me, it mortified me that Travis might have thought Id done it on purpose.Travis?Your alarm, I whispered.He still didnt move.Travis!I said, nudging him.When he still didnt stir, I reached across him, fumbling in the dim light until I felt the top of the clock.Unsure of how to turn it off, I smacked the top of it until I hit the snooze button, and then fell against my pillow with a huff.Travis chuckled.You were awake?I promised Id behave.I didnt say anything about letting you lay on me.I didnt lay on you, I protested.I couldnt reach the clock.That has to be the most annoying alarm Ive ever heard.It sounds like a dying animal.He reached over and flipped a button.You want breakfast?I glared at him, and then shook my head.Im not hungry.Well, I am.Why dont you ride with me down the street to the caf?I dont think I can handle your lack of driving skills this early in the morning, I said.I swung my feet over the side of the bed and shoved them into my slippers, shuffling to the door.Where are you going?he asked.To get dressed and go to class.Do you need an itinerary while Im here?Travis stretched, and then walked over to me, still in his boxers.Are you always so temperamental, or will that taper off once you believe Im not just creating some elaborate scheme to get in your pants?His hands cupped my shoulders and I felt his thumbs caress my skin in unison.Im not temperamental.He leaned in close and whispered in my ear.I dont want to sleep with you, Pidge.I like you too much.He walked past me to the bathroom, and I stood, stunned.Karas words replayed in my mind.Travis Maddox slept with every one; I couldnt help but feel deficient in some way knowing he had no desire to even try to sleep with me.The door opened again, and America walked through.Wakey, wakey, eggs n bakey!she smiled, yawning.Youre turning into your mother, Mare, I grumbled, rifling through my suitcase.Ooohdid someone miss some sleep last night?He barely breathed in my direction, I said acerbically.A knowing smile brightened Americas face.Oh.Oh, what?Nothing, she said, returning to Shepleys room.Travis was in the kitchen, humming a random tune while scrambling eggs.You sure you dont want some?he asked.Im sure.Thanks, though.Shepley and America walked in, and Shepley pulled two plates from the cabinet, holding them out as Travis shoveled a pile of steaming eggs onto each one.Shepley sat the plates on the bar, and he and America sat together, satisfying the appetite they more than likely worked up the night before.Dont look at me like that, Shep.Im sorry, I just dont want to go, America said.Baby, the House has a date party twice a year, Shepley spoke as he chewed.Its a month away.Youll have plenty of time to find a dress and do all that girl stuff.I would, Shepthats really sweetbut Im not gonna know anyone there.A lot of the girls that come dont know a lot of people there, he said, surprised at the rejection.She slumped in her chair.The sorority bitches get invited to those things.Theyll all know each otheritll be weird.Cmon, Mare.Dont make me go alone.Wellmaybe you could find someone to take Abby?she said, looking at me, and then to Travis.Travis raised an eyebrow, and Shepley shook his head.Trav doesnt go to the date parties.Its something you take your girlfriend toand Travis doesntyou know.America shrugged.We could set her up with someone.I narrowed my eyes at her.I can hear you, you know.America used the face she knew I couldnt say no to.Please, Abby?Well find you a nice guy thats funny and witty, and you know Ill make sure hes hotI promise youll have a good time!And who knows?Maybe youll hit it off.Travis threw the pan in the sink.I didnt say I wouldnt take her.I rolled my eyes.Dont do me any favors, Travis.Thats not what I meant, Pidge.Date parties are for the guys with girlfriends, and its common knowledge that I dont do the girlfriend thing.But I wont have to worry about you expecting an engagement ring afterward.America jutted her lip out.Pretty please, Abby?Dont look at me like that!I complained.Travis doesnt want to go, I dont want to gowe wont be much fun.Travis crossed his arms and leaned against the sink.I didnt say I didnt want to go.I think itd be fun if the four of us went, he shrugged.Everyones eyes focused on me, and I recoiled.Why dont we hang out here?America pouted and Shepley leaned forward.Because I have to go, Abby.Im a freshman; I have to make sure everythings moving smoothly, everyone has a beer in their hand, things like that.Travis walked across the kitchen and wrapped his arm around my shoulders, pulling me to his side.Cmon, Pidge.Will you go with me?I looked at America, then at Shepley, and finally to Travis.Yes, I sighed.America squealed and hugged me, and then I felt Shepleys hand on my back.Thanks, Abby, Shepley said.Finch took another drag.The smoke flowed from his nose in two thick streams.I angled my face toward the sun as he regaled me with the recent weekend of dancing, booze and a very persistent new friend.If hes stalking you, then why do you let him buy you drinks?I laughed.Its simple, Abby.Im broke.I laughed again, and Finch jabbed his elbow into my side when he caught sight of Travis walking toward us.Hey, Travis, Finch lilted, winking at me.Finch, he nodded.He dangled his keys.Im headed home, Pidge.You need a ride?I was just going in, I said, grinning up at him through my sunglasses.Youre not staying with me tonight?he asked, his face a combination of surprise and disappointment.No, I am.I just had to grab a few things that I forgot.Like what?Well, my razor for one.What do you care?Its about time you shaved your legs.Theyve been tearing the hell outta mine, he said with an impish grin.Finchs eyes bulged as he gave me a quick once over, and I made a face at Travis.Thats how rumors get started!I looked at Finch and shook my head.Im sleeping in his bedjust sleeping.Right, Finch said with a smug smile.I smacked Finchs arm before yanking the door open and climbing the stairs.By the time I reached the second floor, Travis was beside me.Oh, dont be mad.I was just kidding.Everyone already assumes were having sex.Youre making it worse.Who cares what they think?I do, Travis!I do!I pushed open my door, shoved my things in a small tote, and then stormed out with Travis trailing behind.He chuckled as he took the bag from my hand, and I glared at him.Its not funny.Do you want the whole school to think Im one of your sluts?Travis frowned.No one thinks that.And if they do, they better hope I dont hear about it.He held the door open for me, and after walking through, I stopped abruptly in front of him.Whoa!he said, slamming into me.I flipped around.Oh my God!People probably think were together and youre shamelessly continuing yourelifestyle.I must look pathetic!I said, coming to the realization as I spoke.I dont think I should stay with you, anymore.We should just stay away from each other in general for awhile.I took my bag from him and he snatched it back.No one thinks were together, Pidge.You dont have to quit talking to me to prove a point.We engaged in a tug of war with the tote, and when he refused to let go, I growled loudly in frustration.Have you ever had a girl  thats a friend  stay with you?Have you ever given girls rides to and from school?Have you eaten lunch with them every day?No one knows what to think about us, even when we tell them!He walked to the parking lot, holding my effects hostage.Ill fix this, okay?I dont want anyone thinking less of you because of me, he said with a troubled expression.His eyes brightened and he smiled.Let me make it up to you.Why dont we go to The Dutch tonight?Thats a biker bar, I sneered, watching him fasten my tote to his bike.Okay, then lets go to the club.Ill take you to dinner and then we can go to The Red Door.My treat.How will going out to dinner and then to a club fix the problem?When people see us out together it will make it worse.He straddled his bike.Think about it.Me, drunk, in a room full of scantily clad women?It wont take long for people to figure out were not a couple.So what am I supposed to do?Take a guy home from the bar to drive the point home?I didnt say that.No need to get carried away, he said with a frown.I rolled my eyes and climbed onto the seat, wrapping my arms around his middle.Some random girl is going to follow us home from the bar?Thats how youre going to make it up to me?Youre not jealous, are you, Pigeon?Jealous of what?The STD infested imbecile youre going to piss off in the morning?Travis laughed, and then started his Harley.He flew toward his apartment at twice the speed limit, and I closed my eyes to block out the trees and cars we left behind.After climbing off his bike, I smacked his shoulder.Did you forget I was with you?Are you trying to get me killed?Its hard to forget youre behind me when your thighs are squeezing the life out of me.A smirk came with his next thought.I couldnt think of a better way to die, actually.There is something very wrong with you.We had barely made it inside when America shuffled out of Shepleys bedroom.We were thinking about going out tonight.You guys in?I looked at Travis and grinned.Were going to swing by the sushi place before we go to Red.Americas smile spanned from one side of her face to the other.Shep!she cried, scampering into the bathroom.Were going out tonight!I was the last one in the shower, so Shepley, America and Travis were impatiently standing by the door when I stepped out of the bathroom in a black dress and hot pink heels.America whistled.Hot damn, Mama!I smiled in appreciation, and Travis held out his hand.Nice legs.Did I mention that its a magic razor?I dont think its the razor, he smiled, pulling me out the door.We were far too loud and obnoxious in the sushi bar, and had already had a nights worth to drink before we stepped foot in The Red Door.Shepley pulled into the parking lot, taking time to find a space.Sometime tonight, Shep, America muttered.Hey.I have to find a wide space.I dont want some drunken idiot dinging the paint.Once we parked, Travis leaned the seat forward and helped me out.I meant to ask you about your IDs.Theyre flawless.You didnt get them around here.Yeah, weve had them for awhile.It was necessaryin Wichita, I said.Necessary?Travis asked.Its a good thing you have connections, America said.She hiccupped and covered her mouth, giggling.Dear God, woman, Shepley said, holding Americas arm as she awkwardly stepped along the gravel.I think youre already done for the night.Travis made a face.What are you talking about, Mare?What connections?Abby has some old friends that,  Theyre fake IDs, Trav, I interrupted.You have to know the right people if you want them done right, right?America purposefully looked away from Travis, and I waited.Right, he said, extending his hand for mine.I grabbed three of his fingers and smiled, knowing by his expression that he wasnt satisfied with my answer.I need another drink!I said as a second attempt to change the subject.Shots!America yelled.Shepley rolled his eyes.Oh, yeah.Thats what you need, another shot.Once inside, America immediately pulled me onto the dance floor.Her blonde hair was everywhere, and I laughed at the duck face she made when she moved to music.When the song was over, we joined the boys at the bar.An excessively voluptuous, platinum blonde was already at Travis side, and Americas face screwed into revulsion.Its going to be like this all night, Mare.Just ignore them, Shepley said, nodding to a small group of girls standing a few feet away.They eyed the blonde, waiting for their turn.It looks like Vegas threw up on a flock of vultures, America sneered.Travis lit a cigarette as he ordered two more beers, and the blonde bit her puffy, glossed lip and smiled.The bartender popped the tops open and slid the bottles to Travis.The blonde picked up one of the beers, but Travis pulled it from her hand.Uhnot yours, he said to her, handing it to me.My initial thought was to toss the bottle in the trash, but the woman looked so offended, I smiled and took a drink.She walked off in a huff, and I chuckled that Travis didnt seem to notice.Like I would buy a beer for some chick at a bar, he said, shaking his head.I held up my beer, and he pulled up one side of his mouth into a half smile.Youre different.I clinked my bottle against his.To being the only girl a guy with no standards doesnt want to sleep with.I said, taking a swig.Are you serious?he asked, pulling the bottle from my mouth.When I didnt recant, he leaned toward me.First of allI have standards.Ive never been with an ugly woman.Ever.Second of all, I wanted to sleep with you.I thought about throwing you over my couch fifty different ways, but I havent because I dont see you that way anymore.Its not that Im not attracted to you, I just think youre better than that.I couldnt hold back the smug smile that crept across my face.You think Im too good for you.He sneered at my second insult.I cant think of a single guy I know thats good enough for you.The smugness melted away and was replaced with a touched, appreciative smile.Thanks, Trav, I said, setting my empty bottle on the bar.Travis pulled on my hand.Cmon, he said, tugging me through the crowd on the dance floor.Ive had a lot to drink!Im going to fall!Travis smiled and pulled me to him, grabbing my hips.Shut up and dance.America and Shepley appeared beside us.Shepley moved like hed been watching too many Usher videos.Travis had me near panic with the way he pressed against me.If he used any of those moves on the couch, I could see why so many girls chanced humiliation in the morning.He cinched his hands around my hips, and I noticed that his expression was different, almost serious.I ran my hands over his flawless chest and six pack as they stretched and tensed under his tight shirt to the music.I turned my back to him, smiling when he wrapped his arms around my waist.Coupled with the alcohol in my system, when he pulled my body against his, things came to mind that were anything but friendly.The next song bled into the one we were dancing to, and Travis showed no signs of wanting to return to the bar.The sweat beaded on the back of my neck, and the multi colored strobe lights made me feel a bit dizzy.I closed my eyes and leaned my head against his shoulder.He grabbed my hands and pulled them up and around his neck.His hands ran down my arms, down my ribs, finally returning to my hips.When I felt his lips, and then his tongue against my neck, I pulled away from him.He chuckled, looking a bit surprised.What, Pidge?My temper flared, making the sharp words I wanted to say stick in my throat.I retreated to the bar and ordered another Corona.Travis took the stool beside me, holding up his finger to order one for himself.As soon as the bartender set the bottle in front of me, I tipped it up and drank half the contents before slamming it to the bar.You think that is going to change anyones mind about us?I said, pulling my hair to the side, covering the spot he kissed.He laughed once.I dont give a damn what they think about us.I shot him a dirty look and then turned to face forward.Pigeon, he said, touching my arm.I pulled away from him.Dont.I could never get drunk enough to let you get me on that couch.His face twisted in anger, but before he could say anything, a dark haired stunner with pouty lips, enormous blue eyes and far too much cleavage approached him.Well.If it isnt Travis Maddox, she said, bouncing in all the right places.He took a drink, and then his eyes locked on mine.Hey Megan.Introduce me to your girlfriend, she smiled.I rolled my eyes at how pathetically transparent she was.Travis tipped his head back to finish his beer, and then slid his empty bottle down the bar.Everyone waiting to order followed it with their eyes until it fell into the trashcan at the end.Shes not my girlfriend.He grabbed Megans hand, and she happily traipsed behind him to the dance floor.He all but mauled her for one song, and then another, and another.They were causing a scene with the way she let him grope her, and when he bent her over I turned my back to them.You look pissed, a man said as he sat next to me.Is that your boyfriend out there?No, hes just a friend, I grumbled.Well, thats good.That could have been pretty awkward for you if he was.He faced the dance floor, shaking his head at the spectacle.Tell me about it, I said, drinking the last of my beer.I barely tasted the last two I had put away, and my teeth were numb.Would you like another one?he asked.I looked over at him and he smiled.Im Ethan.Abby, I said, taking his outstretched hand.He held up two fingers to the bartender, and I smiled.Thanks.So you live here?he asked.In Morgan Hall at Eastern.I have an apartment in Hinley.You go to State?I asked.What is thatlike an hour away?What are you doing over here?I graduated last May.My little sister goes to Eastern.Im staying with her this week while I apply for jobs.Uh ohliving in the real world, huh?Ethan laughed.And its everything they say it is.I pulled the gloss out of my pocket and smeared it across my lips, using the mirror lining the wall behind the bar.Thats a nice shade, he said, watching me press my lips together.I smiled, feeling the anger at Travis, and the heaviness of the alcohol.Maybe you can try it on later.Ethans eyes brightened as I leaned in closer, and I smiled when he touched my knee.He pulled back his hand when Travis stepped between us.You ready, Pidge?Im talking, Travis, I said, moving him back.His shirt was damp from the circus on the dance floor, and I made a show of wiping my hand on my skirt.Travis made a face.Do you even know this guy?This is Ethan, I said, sending my new friend the best flirty smile I could manage.He winked at me, and then looked at Travis, extending his hand.Nice to meet you.Travis glanced at me and I sighed.Ethan, this is Travis, I muttered.Travis Maddox, he said, staring at Ethans hand as if he wanted to rip it off.Ethans eyes grew wide and he awkwardly pulled back his hand.Travis Maddox?Easterns Travis Maddox?I rested my cheek on my fist, dreading the inevitable testosterone fueled story swapping that would soon ensue.Travis stretched his arm behind me to grip the bar.Yeah, what of it?I saw you fight Shawn Jenks last year, man.I thought I was about to witness someones death!Travis glowered down at him.You wanna see it again?Ethan laughed once, his eyes darting back and forth between us.When he realized Travis was serious, he smiled at me apologetically and left.Are you ready, now?he snapped.You are a complete asshole, you know that?Ive been called worse, he said, helping me off the stool.We followed America and Shepley to the car, and when Travis tried to grab my hand to lead me across the parking lot, I yanked it away.He wheeled around and I jerked to a stop, leaning back when he came within a few inches of my face.I should just kiss you and get it over with!he yelled.Youre being ridiculous!I kissed your neck, so what?I could smell the beer and cigarettes on his breath and I pushed him away.Im not your fuck buddy, Travis.He shook his head in disbelief.I never said you were!Youre around me twenty four seven, you sleep in my bed, but half the time you act like you dont wanna be seen with me!I came here with you!I have never treated you with anything but respect, Pidge.I stood my ground.No, you just treat me like your property.You had no right to run Ethan off like that!Do you know who Ethan is?he asked.When I shook my head, he leaned in closer.I do.He was arrested last year for sexual battery, but the charges were dropped.I crossed my arms.Oh, so you have something in common?Travis eyes narrowed, and the muscles in his jaws twitched under his skin.Are you calling me a rapist?he said in a cold, low tone.I pressed my lips together, even angrier that he was right.I had taken it too far.No, Im just pissed at you!Ive been drinking, all right?Your skin was three inches from my face, and youre beautiful, and you smell fucking awesome when you sweat.I kissed you!Im sorry!Get over yourself!His excuse made the corners of my mouth turn up.You think Im beautiful?He frowned with disgust.Youre gorgeous and you know it.What are you smiling about?I tried to quell my amusement to no avail.Nothing.Lets go.Travis laughed once and shook his head.Wha?You?Youre a pain in my ass!he yelled, glaring at me.I couldnt stop smiling, and after a few seconds, Travis mouth turned up.He shook his head again, and then hooked his arm around my neck.Youre making me crazy.You know that, right?At the apartment, we all stumbled through the door.I made a beeline for the bathroom to wash the smoke out of my hair.When I stepped out of the shower, I saw that Travis had brought me one of his t shirts and a pair of his boxers to change into.The shirt swallowed me, and the boxers disappeared under the shirt.I crashed into the bed and sighed, still smiling at what hed said in the parking lot.Travis stared at me for a moment, and I felt a twinge in my chest.I had an almost ravenous urge to grab his face and plant my mouth on his, but I fought against the alcohol and hormones raging through my bloodstream.Night, Pidge, he whispered, turning over.I fidgeted, not yet ready to sleep.Trav?I said, leaning up to rest my chin on his shoulder.Yeah?I know Im drunk, and we just got into a ginormous fight over this, but.Im not having sex with you, so quit asking, he said, his back still turned to me.What?No!I cried.Travis laughed and turned, looking at me with a soft expression.What, Pigeon?I sighed.This, I said, laying my head on his chest and stretching my arm across his middle, snuggling as close to him as I could.He stiffened and held his hands up, as if he didnt know how to react.You are drunk.I know, I said, too intoxicated to be embarrassed.He relaxed one hand against my back, and the other on my wet hair, and then pressed his lips to my forehead.You are the most confusing woman Ive ever met.Its the least you can do after scaring off the only guy that approached me tonight.You mean Ethan the rapist?Yeah, I owe you for that one.Never mind, I said, feeling the beginning of a rejection coming on.He grabbed my arm and held it on his stomach to keep me from pulling away.No, Im serious.You need to be more careful.If I wasnt thereI dont even want to think about it.And now you expect me to apologize for running him off?I dont want you to apologize.Its not even about that.Then whats it about?he asked, searching my eyes for something.His face was just a few inches from mine, and I could feel his breath on my lips.I frowned.Im drunk, Travis.Its the only excuse I have.You just want me to hold you until you fall asleep?I didnt answer.He shifted to look straight into my eyes.I should say no to prove a point, he said, his eyebrows pulling together.But I would hate myself later if I said no and you never asked me again.I nestled my cheek against his chest, and he tightened his arms, sighing.You dont need an excuse, Pigeon.All you have to do is ask.I cringed at the sunlight pouring through the window and the alarm blaring into my ear.Travis was still asleep, surrounding me with both his arms and his legs.I maneuvered an arm free to reach over and pound the snooze button.Wiping my face, I looked over at him, sleeping soundly two inches from my face.Oh my God, I whispered, wondering how wed managed to become so tangled.I took a deep breath and held it as I worked to free myself from his grip.Stop it, Pidge, Im sleepin, he mumbled, squeezing me against him.After several attempts, I finally slid from his grip and sat on the edge of the bed, looking back at his half naked body draped in covers.I watched him for a moment and sighed.The lines were becoming blurred, and it was my fault.His hand slid across the sheets and he touched my fingers.Whats wrong, Pigeon?he said, his eyes barely open.Im going to get a glass of water, you want anything?Travis shook his head and closed his eyes, his cheek flat against the mattress.Morning, Abby, Shepley said from the recliner when I rounded the corner.Wheres Mare?Still sleeping.What are you doing up so early?he asked, looking at the clock.The alarm went off, but I always wake up early after I drink.Its a curse.Me, too, he nodded.You better get Mare up.We have class in an hour, I said, turning on the tap, and leaning over to take a sip.Shepley nodded.I was just going to let her sleep.I shook my head.Dont do that.Shell be mad if she misses.Oh, he said, standing up.Better wake her, then.He wheeled around.Hey, Abby?Yeah?I dont know whats going on with you and Travis, but I know that hes going to do something stupid to piss you off.Its a tic he has.He doesnt get close with anyone very often, and for whatever reason hes let you in.But you have to overlook his demons.Its the only way hell know.Know what?I asked, raising an eyebrow at his melodramatic speech.If youll climb over the wall, he answered simply.I shook my head and chuckled.Whatever you say, Shep.Shepley shrugged, and then disappeared into his bedroom.I heard soft murmurs, a protesting groan, and then Americas sweet giggling.I swirled the oatmeal around in my bowl, and squeezed the chocolate syrup in as I stirred.Thats sick, Pidge, Travis said, wearing only a pair of green plaid boxers.He rubbed his eyes and pulled a box of cereal from the cabinet.Good morning to you, too, I said, snapping the cap on the bottle.I hear your birthday is coming up.Last stand of your teenage years, he grinned, his eyes puffy and red.YeahIm not a big birthday person.I think Mare is going to take me to dinner or something.I smiled, You can come if you want.All right, he shrugged.Its a week from Sunday?Yes.Whens your birthday?He poured the milk, dunking the flakes with his spoon, Not til April.April first.Shut up.No, Im serious.he said, chewing.Your birthday is on April Fools?I asked again, raising an eyebrow.He laughed.Yes!Youre gonna be late.I better get dressed.Im riding with Mare.I could tell he was being intentionally cool when he shrugged.Whatever, he said, turning his back to me to finish his cereal.Hes definitely staring at you, America whispered, leaning back to peek across the room.Stop looking, dummy, hes going to see you.America smiled and waved.Hes already seen me.Hes still staring.I hesitated for a moment, and then finally worked up enough courage to look in his direction.Parker was looking right at me, grinning.I returned his smile, and then pretended to type something on my laptop.Is he still staring?I murmured.Yep, she giggled.After class, Parker stopped me in the hall.Dont forget about the party this weekend.I wont, I said, trying not to bat my eyes or do anything else ridiculous.America and I made our way across the lawn to the cafeteria to meet Travis and Shepley for lunch.She was still laughing about Parkers behavior when Shepley and Travis approached.Hey, Baby, America said, kissing her boyfriend square on the mouth.Whats so funny?Shepley asked.Oh, a guy in class was staring at Abby all hour.It was adorable.As long as he was staring at Abby, Shepley winked.Who was it?Travis grimaced.I readjusted my backpack, prompting Travis to slide it off my arms and hold it.I shook my head.Mares imagining things.Abby!You big, fat liar!It was Parker Hayes, and he was being so obvious.The guy was practically drooling.Travis expression twisted into disgust.Parker Hayes?Shepley pulled on Americas hand.Were headed to lunch.Will you be enjoying the fine cafeteria cuisine this afternoon?America kissed him again in answer, and Travis and I followed behind.I sat my tray between America and Finch, but Travis didnt sit in his normal seat across from me.Instead, he sat a few seats down.It was then that I realized he hadnt said much during our walk to the cafeteria.Are you okay, Trav?I asked.Me?Fine, why?he said, smoothing the features of his face.Youve just been quiet.Several members of the football team approached the table and sat down, laughing loudly.Travis looked a bit annoyed as he rolled his food around on his plate.Chris Jenks tossed a french fry onto Travis plate.Whats up, Trav?I heard you bagged Tina Martin.Shes been raking your name through the mud today.Shut up, Jenks, Travis said, keeping his eyes on his food.I leaned forward so the brawny giant sitting in front of Travis could experience the full force of my glare.Knock it off, Chris.Travis eyes bored into mine.I can take care of myself, Abby.Im sorry, I.   I dont want you to be sorry.I dont want you to be anything, he snapped, shoving away from the table and storming out the door.Finch looked over at me with raised eyebrows.Whoa.What was that about?I stabbed a tater tot with my fork and puffed.I dont know.Shepley patted my back.Its nothing you did, Abby.He just has stuff going on, America added.What kind of stuff?I asked.Shepley shrugged and turned his attention to his plate.You should know by now that it takes patience and a forgiving attitude to be friends with Travis.Hes his own universe.I shook my head.Thats the Travis everyone else seesnot the Travis I know.Shepley leaned forward.Theres no difference.You just have to ride the wave.After class, I rode with America to the apartment to find Travis motorcycle gone.I went into his room and curled into a ball on his bed, resting my head on my arm.Travis had been fine that morning.As much time as we had spent together, I couldnt believe I didnt see that something had been bothering him.Not only that, it disturbed me that America seemed to know what was going on and I didnt.My breathing evened out and my eyes grew heavy; it wasnt long before I fell asleep.When my eyes opened again, the night sky had darkened the window.Muffled voices filtered down the hall from the living room, including Travis deep tone.I crept down the hall, and then froze when I heard my name.Abby gets it, Trav.Dont beat yourself up, Shepley said.Youre already going to the date party.Whats the harm in asking her out?America asked.I stiffened, waiting for his response.I dont want to date her; I just want to be around her.Shesdifferent.Different how?America asked, sounding irritated.She doesnt put up with my bullshit, its refreshing.You said it yourself, Mare.Im not her type.Its just notlike that with us.Youre closer to her type than you know, America said.I backed up as quietly as I could, and when the wooden boards creaked beneath my bare feet, I reached over to pull Travis bedroom door shut, and then walked down the hall.Hey, Abby, America smiled.How was your nap?I was out for five hours.Thats closer to a coma than a nap.Travis stared at me for a moment, and when I smiled at him, he walked straight toward me, grabbed my hand, and pulled me down the hall to his bedroom.He shut the door, and I felt my heart pounding in my chest, bracing for him to say something else to crush my ego.His eyebrows pulled in.Im so sorry, Pidge.I was an asshole to you earlier.I relaxed a bit, seeing the remorse in his eyes.I didnt know you were mad at me.I wasnt mad at you.I just have a bad habit of lashing out at those I care about.Its a piss poor excuse, I know, but I am sorry, he said, enveloping me in his arms.I nestled my cheek against his chest, settling in.What were you mad about?Its not important.The only thing Im worried about is you.I leaned back to look up at him.I can handle your temper tantrums.His eyes scanned my face for several moments before a small smile spread across his lips.I dont know why you put up with me, and I dont know what Id do if you didnt.I could smell the mixture of cigarettes and mint on his breath, and I looked at his lips, my body reacting to how close we were.Travis expression changed and his breathing staggered  he had noticed, too.He leaned in infinitesimally, and then we both jumped when his cell phone rang.He sighed, pulling it from his pocket.Yeah.Hoffman?Jesusall right.Thatll be an easy grand.Jefferson?He looked at me and winked.Well be there.He hung up and took my hand.Come with me.He pulled me down the hall.That was Adam, he said to Shepley.Brady Hoffman will be at Jefferson in ninety minutes.Shepley nodded and stood up, digging his cell phone from his pocket.After a few moments, he repeated what Travis had told him into his phone, hung up, dialed again, and then repeated the information once more.He dialed another number as he shut his bedroom door behind him.Here we go, America said, smiling.We better freshen up!The air in the apartment was tense and buoyant at the same time.Travis seemed the least affected, slipping on his boots and a white tank top as if he were leaving to run an errand.America led me down the hall to Travis bedroom and frowned.You have to change, Abby.You cant wear that to the fight.I wore a freaking cardigan last time and you didnt say anything!I protested.I didnt think youd go last time.Here, she threw clothes at me, put this on.I am not wearing this!Lets go!Shepley called from the living room.Hurry up!America snapped, running into Shepleys room.I pulled on the deep cut, yellow halter top and tight, low rise jeans America had thrown at me, and then slipped on a pair of heels, raking a brush through my hair as I shuffled down the hall.America came out of her room with a short, green baby doll dress and matching heels, and when we rounded the corner, Travis and Shepley were standing at the door.Travis mouth fell open.Oh, hell no.Are you trying to get me killed?Youve gotta change, Pidge.What?I asked, looking down.America grabbed her hips.She looks cute, Trav, leave her alone!Travis took my hand and led me down the hall.Get a t shirt onand some sneakers.Something comfortable.What?Why?Because Ill be more worried about whos looking at your tits in that shirt instead of Hoffman, he said, stopping at his door.I thought you said you didnt give a damn what anyone else thought?Thats a different scenario, Pigeon.Travis looked down at my chest and then up at me.You cant wear this to the fight, so pleasejustplease just change, he stuttered, shoving me into the room and shutting me in.Travis!I yelled.I kicked off my heels, and shoved my feet into my Converse.Then I wiggled out of my halter top, throwing it across the room.The first cotton shirt that touched my hands I yanked over my head, and then ran down the hall, standing in the doorway.Better?I huffed, pulling my hair into a pony tail.Yes!Travis said, relieved.Lets go!We raced to the parking lot.I jumped on the back of Travis motorcycle as he ripped the engine and peeled out, flying down the road to the college.I squeezed his middle in anticipation; the rushing to get out the door had sent adrenaline surging through my veins.Travis drove over the curb, parking his motorcycle in the shadows behind the Jefferson Liberal Arts building.He pushed his sunglasses to the top of his head, and then grabbed my hand, smiling as we snuck to the back of the building.He stopped at an open window near the ground.My eyes widened with realization.Youre joking.Travis smiled.This is the VIP entrance.You should see how everyone else gets in.I shook my head as he worked his legs through, and then disappeared.I leaned down and called into oblivion, Travis!Down here, Pidge.Just come in feet first, Ill catch you.Youre out of your damn mind if you think Im jumping into the dark!Ill catch you!I promise!Now get your ass in here!I sighed, touching my forehead with my hand.This is insane!I sat down, and then scooted forward until half of my body was dangling in the dark.I turned on my stomach, and pointed my toes, feeling for the floor.I waited for my feet to touch Travis hand, but I lost my grip, squealing when I fell backward.A pair of hands grabbed me, and I heard Travis voice in the darkness.You fall like a girl, he chuckled.He lowered my feet to the ground, and then pulled me further into the blackness.After a dozen steps, I could hear the familiar yelling of numbers and names, and then the room illuminated.A lantern sat in the corner, lighting the room just enough that I could make out Travis face.What are we doing?Waiting.Adam has to run through his spiel before I go in.I fidgeted.Should I wait here, or should I go in?Where do I go when the fight starts?Wheres Shep and Mare?They went in the other way.Just follow me out, Im not sending you into that shark pit without me.Stay by Adam, hell keep you from getting crushed.I cant be looking out for you and throwing punches at the same time.Crushed?Theres going to be more people here tonight.Brady Hoffman is from State.They they have their own Circle there.It will be our crowd and their crowd, so the rooms gonna get crazy.Are you nervous?I asked.He smiled, looking down at me.No.You look a little nervous, though.Maybe, I admitted.If itll make you feel better, I wont let him touch me.I wont even let him get one in for his fans.How are you going to manage that?He shrugged.I usually let them get one in, to make it look fair.You?You let people hit you?How much fun would it be if I just massacred someone and they never got a punch in?Its not good for business, no one would bet against me.What a load of crap, I said, crossing my arms.Travis raised an eyebrow.You think Im yankin your chain?I find it hard to believe that you only get hit when you let them hit you.Would you like to make a wager on that, Abby Abernathy?he smiled, his eyes animated.I smiled.Ill take that bet.I think hell get one in on you.And if he doesnt?What do I win?he asked.I shrugged as the yelling on the other side of the wall grew to a roar.Adam greeted the crowd, and then went over the rules.Travis mouth stretched into a wide grin.If you win, Ill go without sex for a month.I raised an eyebrow and he smiled again.But if I win, you have to stay with me for a month.What?Im staying with you, anyway!What kind of bet is that?I shrieked over the noise.They fixed the boilers at Morgan today, Travis smiled, winking.A smug smile spread across my face as Adam called Travis name.Anything is worth watching you try abstinence for a change.Travis kissed my cheek, and then walked out, standing tall.I followed behind, and when we crossed into the next room, I was startled by the number of people packed together in the small space.It was standing room only, but the shoving and shouting only amplified once we entered the room.Travis nodded in my direction, and then Adams hand was on my shoulders, pulling me to his side.I leaned into Adams ear.Ive got two on Travis, I said.Adams eyebrows shot up as he watched me pull two Benjamins from my pocket.He held out his palm, and I slapped the bills into his hand.Youre not the Pollyanna I thought you were, he said, giving me a once over.Brady was at least a head taller than Travis, and I gulped when I saw them stand toe to toe.Brady was massive, twice Travis size and solid muscle.I couldnt see Travis expression, but it was obvious that Brady was out for blood.Adam pressed his lips against my ear.You might want to plug your ears, kiddo.I cupped my hands on each side of my head, and Adam sounded the horn.Instead of attacking, Travis took a few steps back.Brady swung, and Travis dodged to the right.Brady swung again, and Travis ducked and side stepped to the other side.What the hell?This aint a boxing match, Travis!Adam yelled.Travis landed a punch to Bradys nose.The volume in the basement was deafening, then.Travis sank a left hook into Bradys jaw, and my hands flew over my mouth when Brady attempted a few more punches, each one catching air.Brady fell against his entourage when Travis elbowed him in the face.Just when I thought it was almost over, Brady came out swinging again.Throw after throw, Brady couldnt seem to keep up.Both men were covered in sweat, and I gasped when Brady missed another punch, slamming his hand into a cement pillar.When he folded over, cradling his fist beneath him, Travis went in for the kill.He was relentless, first bringing his knee to Bradys face, and then pummeling him over and over until Brady stumbled and hit the ground.The noise level boomed as Adam left my side to throw the red square on Bradys bloodied face.Travis disappeared behind his fans, and I pressed my back against the wall, feeling my way to the doorway we came in from.Reaching the lantern was a huge relief.I worried about being knocked down and trampled.My eyes stayed focused on doorway, watching for any sign of the crowd spilling into the small room.After several minutes and no sign of Travis, I prepared to retrace my steps to the window.With the number of people trying to leave at once, it wasnt safe enough to chance wandering around.Just as I stepped into the darkness, footsteps crunched against the loose concrete on the floor.Travis was looking for me in a panic.Pigeon!Im here!I called out, running into his arms.Travis looked down and frowned.You scared the shit out of me!I almost had to start another fight just to get to you I finally get here and youre gone!Im glad youre back.I wasnt looking forward to finding my way back in the dark.All worry left his face, and he smiled widely.I believe you lost the bet.Adam stomped in, looked at me, and then glowered at Travis.We need to talk.Travis winked at me.Stay put.Ill be right back.They disappeared into the darkness.Adam raise his voice a few times, but I couldnt make out what he was saying.Travis returned, shoving a wad of cash into his pocket, and then he offered a half smile.Youre going to need more clothes.Youre really going to make me stay with you for a month?Would you have made me go without sex for a month?I laughed, knowing I would.We better stop at Morgan.Travis beamed.This should be interesting.As Adam walked past, he slammed my winnings into my palm, withdrawing into the dissipating mob.Travis raised an eyebrow.You put in?I smiled and shrugged.I thought I should get the full experience.He led me to the window, and then crawled out, turning to help me up and out to the fresh night air.The crickets were chirping in the shadows, stopping just long enough to let us pass.The monkey grass that lined the sidewalk weaved in the gentle breeze, reminding me of the sound the ocean makes when I wasnt quite close enough to hear the waves breaking.It wasnt too hot, or too cold; it was the perfect night.Why on earth would you want me to stay with you, anyway?I asked.Travis shrugged, shoving his hands in his pockets.I dont know.Everythings better when youre around.The warm and fuzzies I felt from his words quickly faded with the sight of the red, blotchy mess on his shirt.Ew.You have blood all over you.Travis looked down with indifference, and then opened the door, gesturing for me to walk in.I breezed by Kara who studied on her bed, held captive by the text books that surrounded her.The boilers were fixed this morning, she said.I heard, I said, rifling through my closet.Hi, Travis said to Kara.Karas face twisted as she scanned Travis sweaty, bloody form.Travis, this is my roommate Kara Lin.Kara, Travis Maddox.Nice to meet you, Kara said, pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose.She glanced at my bulging bags.Are you moving out?Nope.Lost a bet.Travis burst into laughter, grabbing my bags.Ready?Yeah.How am I going to get all of this to your apartment?Were on your bike.Travis smiled and pulled out his cell phone.He carried my luggage to the street, and minutes later, Shepleys black, vintage Charger pulled up.The passenger side window rolled down, and America poked her head out.Hey, Chickie!Hey yourself.The boilers are working again at Morgan, are you still staying with Shep?She winked.Yeah, I thought Id stay tonight.I heard you lost a bet.Before I could speak, Travis shut the trunk and Shep sped off, with America squealing as she fell back into the car.We walked to his Harley, and when I wrapped my arms around him, he rested his hand on mine.Im glad you were there tonight, Pidge.Ive never had so much fun at a fight in my life.I perched my chin on his shoulder and smiled.That was because you were trying to win our bet.He angled his neck to face me.Damn right I was.There was no amusement in his eyes, he was serious, and he wanted me to see it.My eyebrows shot up.Is that why you were in such a bad mood today?Because you knew theyd fixed the boilers, and I would be leaving tonight?Travis didnt answer; he only smiled as he started his motorcycle.The drive to the apartment was uncharacteristically slow.At every stoplight, Travis would either cover my hands with his, or he would rest his hand on my knee.The lines were blurring again, and I wondered how we would spend a month together and not ruin everything.The loose ends of our friendship were tangling in a way I never imagined.When we arrived in the apartment parking lot, Shepleys Charger sat in its usual spot.I stood in front of the steps.I always hate it when theyve been home for awhile.I feel like were going to interrupt them.Get used to it.This is your place for the next four weeks, Travis smiled and turned his back to me.Get on.What?I smiled.Cmon, Ill carry you up.I giggled and hopped onto his back, interlacing my fingers on his chest as he ran up the stairs.America opened the door before we made it to the top and smiled.Look at you two.If I didnt know better.Knock it off, Mare, Shepley said from the couch.America smiled as if shed said too much, and then opened the door wide so we could both fit through.Travis collapsed against the recliner.I squealed when he leaned against me.Youre awfully cheerful this evening, Trav.What gives?America prompted.I leaned over to see his face.Id never seen him so pleased.I just won a shit load of money, Mare.Twice as much as I thought I would.Whats not to be happy about?America grinned.No, its something else, she said, watching Travis hand as he patted my thigh.She was right; he was different.There was an air of peace around him, almost as if some kind of new contentment had settled into his soul.Mare, Shepley warned.Fine, Ill talk about something else.Didnt Parker invite you to the Sig Tau party this weekend, Abby?Travis smile vanished and he turned to me, waiting for an answer.Eryeah?Arent we all going?Ill be there, Shepley said, distracted by the television.And that means Im going, America smiled, looking expectantly at Travis.Travis watched me for a moment, and then nudged my leg.Is he picking you up or something?No, he just told me about the party.Americas mouth spread into a mischievous grin, almost bobbing in anticipation.He said hed see you there, though.Hes really cute.Travis shot an irritated glance in Americas direction and then looked to me.Are you going?I told him I would, I shrugged.Are you going?Yeah, he said without hesitation.Shepleys attention turned to Travis, then.You said last week you werent.I changed my mind, Shep, whats the problem?Nothing, he grumbled, retreating to his bedroom.America frowned at Travis.You know what the problem is, she said.Why dont you quit driving him crazy and just get it over with.She joined Shepley in his room, and their voices were reduced to murmuring behind the closed door.Well, Im glad everyone else knows, I said.Travis stood up.Im going to take a quick shower.Is there something going on with them?I asked.No, hes just paranoid.Its because of us, I guessed.Travis eyes lit up and he nodded.What?I asked, eyeing him suspiciously.Youre right.Its because of us.Dont fall asleep, okay?I wanna talk to you about something.He walked backward a few steps, and then disappeared behind the bathroom door.I twisted my hair around my finger, mulling over the way he emphasized the word us, and the look on his face when hed said it.I wondered if there had ever been lines at all, and if I was the only one that considered Travis and I just friends anymore.Shepley burst out of his room, and America ran after him.Shep, dont!she pleaded.He looked back to the bathroom door, and then to me.His voice was low, but angry.You promised, Abby.When I told you to spare judgment, I didnt mean for you two to get involved!I thought you were just friends!We are, I said, shaken by his surprise attack.No, youre not!he fumed.America touched his shoulder.Baby, I told you it will be fine.He pulled away from her grip.Why are you pushing this, Mare?I told you whats going to happen!She grabbed his face with both hands.And I told you it wont!Dont you trust me?Shepley sighed, looked at her, at me, and then stomped into his room.America fell into the recliner beside me, and puffed.I just cant get it into his head that whether you and Travis work out or not, it wont affect us.But hes been burned too many times.He doesnt believe me.What are you talking about, Mare?Travis and I arent together.We are just friends.You heard him earlierhes not interested in me that way.You heard that?Well, yeah.And you believe it?I shrugged.It doesnt matter.Itll never happen.He told me he doesnt see me like that, hes a total commitment phobe, Id be hard pressed to find a girlfriend outside of you that he hasnt slept with, and I cant keep up with his mood swings.I cant believe Shep thinks otherwise.Because not only does he know Travishes talked to Travis, Abby.What do you mean?Mare?Shepley called from the bedroom.America sighed.Youre my best friend.I think I know you better than you know yourself sometimes.I see you two together, and the only difference between me and Shep, and you and Travis, is that were having sex.Other than that?No difference.There is a huge, huge difference.Is Shep bringing home different girls every night?Are you going to the party tomorrow to hang out with a guy with definite dating potential?You know I cant get involved with Travis, Mare.I dont even know why were discussing it.Americas expression turned to disappointment.Im not seeing things, Abby.You have spent almost every moment with him for the last month.Admit it, you have feelings for him.Let it go, Mare, Travis said, tightening his towel around his waist.America and I jumped at the sound of Travis voice, and when my eyes met his, I could see the happiness was gone.He walked down the hall without another word, and America looked at me with a sad expression.I think youre making a mistake, she whispered.You dont need to go that party to meet a guy, youve got one thats crazy about you right here, she said, leaving me alone.I rocked in the recliner, letting everything that had happened in the last week replay in my mind.Shepley was angry with me, America was disappointed in me, and Travishe went from being happier than Id ever seen him, to so offended he was speechless.Too nervous to crawl in bed with him, I watched the clock change from minute to minute.An hour had passed when Travis came out of his room and down the hall.When he rounded the corner, I expected him to ask me to come to bed, but he was dressed and had his bike keys in his hand.His sunglasses were hiding his eyes, and he popped a cigarette in his mouth before grabbing the knob of the door.Youre leaving?I asked, sitting up.Where are you going?Out, he said, yanking the door open, and then slamming it closed behind him.I fell back in the recliner and huffed.I had somehow become the villain, and had no idea how Id managed to get there.When the clock above the television read two A. M. , I finally resigned to go bed.The mattress was lonely without him, and the idea of calling his cell kept creeping into my mind.I had nearly fallen asleep when Travis motorcycle pulled into the parking lot.Two car doors shut shortly after, and then several pairs footsteps climbed the stairs.Travis fumbled with the lock, and then the door opened.He laughed and mumbled, and then I heard not one, but two female voices.Their giggling was interrupted by the distinct sound of kissing and moaning.My heart sank, and I was instantly angry that I felt that way.My eyes clenched shut when one of the girls squealed, and then I was sure the next sound was the three of them collapsing onto the couch.I considered asking America for her keys, but Shepleys door was directly in view of the couch, and I couldnt stomach witnessing the picture that went along with the noises in the living room.I buried my head under the pillow, and then shut my eyes when door popped open.Travis walked across the room, opened the top night table drawer, picked through his bowl of condoms, and then shut the drawer, jogging down the hall.The girls giggled for what seemed like half an hour, and then it was quiet.Seconds later, moans, humming and shouting filled the apartment.
