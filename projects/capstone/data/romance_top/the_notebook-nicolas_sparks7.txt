Allie took a sip of bourbon and began to feel its effects.But it wasnt Just the alcohol that made her hold Noah a little tighter and feet his warmth against her.Glancing out of the window, she saw the clouds were almost black."Noah, you've never asked, but I want you to know something. ""What is it?"Her voice was tender."There's never been another, Noah.You weren't just the first.You're the only man I've ever been with, I dont expect you to say the same thing, but I wanted you to know. "Noah was silent as he turned away.She felt warmer as she watched the fire.She leaned into him and felt the heat between them, felt his body, felt his arm tight around her.It felt so right to be here.Everything felt right.The fire, the drinks, the storm it  couldn't have been more perfect.It seemed their years apart didn't matter any more.They gave in then to everything they had fought against for the last fourteen years.Allie lifted her head off his shoulder, looked at him with hazy eyes, and Noah kissed her softly on the lips.She brought her hand to his face and touched his cheek, brushing it softly with her fingers.He leaned in and kissed her tenderly, and she kissed back, feeling the years of separation dissolve into passion.She closed her eyes and parted her lips as he ran his fingers up and down her arms, slowly, lightly.He kissed her neck, her cheek, her eyelids, and she felt the moisture of his mouth linger wherever his lips had touched.She took his hand and led it to her breasts, and a whimper rose in her throat as he gently touched them through the thin fabric of the shirt.The world seemed dreamlike as she pulled back from him, the firelight setting her face aglow.Without speaking, she started to undo the buttons on his shirt.He watched her as she did it and listened to her soft breaths as she made her way downwards.With each button he could feel her fingers brushing against his skin, and she smiled softly at him when she finally finished.He felt her slide her hands inside, touching him lightly, exploring his body.She kissed his neck gently as she pulled the shirt over his shoulders, freeing the sleeves.With that, he slowly reached for her.He lifted her shirt and ran his finger slowly across her belly before raising her arms and slipping it off.She felt short of breath as his hands gently caressed her back, her arms, her shoulders, and she felt their heated bodies press together, skin to skin.They lay back, close to the fire, and the heat made the air seem thick.She ran her hands through his hair as he held himself above her, his arm muscles hard from the exertion.With a little tempting frown, she pulled him closer, but he resisted.Instead he lowered himself and lightly rubbed his chest against her, and she felt her body respond with anticipation.He did this until she couldn't take it any more, and when they finally joined as one, she cried aloud and pressed her fingers hard into his back.She buried her face in his neck and felt him deep inside her, felt his strength and gentleness.She opened her eyes and watched him in the firelight, marvelling at his beauty.She saw his body glisten with crystal sweat and felt every responsibility, every facet of her life, slipping away.By the time the rain had stopped and the sun had set, her body was exhausted.They spent the day in each other's arms, alternately making love by the fire and then holding each other as they watched the flames curl around the wood.He recited his favourite poems as she lay beside him, and she listened with her eyes closed and almost felt the words.Then they joined again and he murmured words of love between kisses as they wrapped their arms around one another.They went on throughout the evening, making up for their years apart, and slept in each other's arms that night.Occasionally he would wake up and look at her, her body spent and radiant, and feel as if everything were suddenly tight in this world.Once, when he was looking at her in the moments before daybreak, her eyes fluttered open and she smiled and reached up to touch his face.He put his fingers to her lips, gently, to keep her from speaking, and for a long time they just looked at one another.When the lump in his throat subsided, he whispered to her, "You are the answer to every prayer Ive offered.You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don't know how I could have lived without you for as long as I have.I love you, Allie, more than you can ever imagine, I always have and I always will. ""Oh, Noah," she said, pulling him to her.She wanted him, needed him now more than ever, like nothing she'd ever known.LATER THAT same morning, three men  two lawyers and the judge sat in chambers while Lon finished speaking."Its an unusual request," the judge answered, pondering the situation."It seems to me the trial could very well end today.Are you saying this matter can't wait until later this evening or tomorrow?""No, your honour, it cant," Lon answered almost too quickly.Stay relaxed, he told himself.Take a deep breath."And it has nothing to do with this case?""No, your honour.It's of a personal nature.I know it's out of the ordinary, but I really need to take care of it. "The judge leaned back in his chair, evaluating him for a moment."Mr.Bates, how do you feel about this?"The lawyer cleared his throat."Mr.Hammond called me this morning arid I've already spoken to my clients.They're willing to postpone until Monday.Mr.Hammond has agreed in return to reopen discussion on a certain matter not covered by this proceeding. "The judge looked hard at both of them."I don't like it," he said, "not at all.But Mr.Hammond has never made such a request before, and I assume the matter is very important to him. "He banged for effect, then looked at some papers on his desk."I'll agree to adjourn until Monday; Nine o'clock sharp. ""Thank you, your honour.Lon said.Two minutes later he was leaving the courthouse.He walked to the car he had parked directly across the street, got in and began the drive to New Bern, his hands shaking,   NOAH MADE breakfast for Allie while she slept in the living room.Bacon, rolls and coffee, nothing spectacular.He set the tray beside her as she woke up, and as soon as they had finished eating they made love again, in powerful confirmation of what they had shared the day before.They showered and afterwards Allie put on her dress, which had dried overnight She spent the morning with Noah, Together they fed Clem and checked the windows to make sure no damage bad been done in the storm.Two pine trees bad blown over, though neither had caused much damage, and a few shingles had Mown off the shed, but, other than that, the property had escaped unscathed.He held her hand most of the morning and they talked easily, but sometimes he would stop speaking and just stare at her.When he did, she felt as though she should say something, but nothing meaningful ever came into her head.She usually just kissed him.A little before noon, Noah and Allie went in to prepare lunch.Using what he had on hand, they tried some chicken and baked another batch of bread rolls, and the two of them ate on the porch, serenaded by a mockingbird.While they were inside doing the dishes* they heard a knock at the door, Noah left Allie in the kitchen.Knock, knock.Louder.Noah approached the door.Knock, knock."I'm coming," he said as he opened the door."Oh, my God. "He stared for a moment at a beautiful woman in her early fifties, a woman he would have recognized anywhere."Hello, Noah," she said.Noah said nothing.May I come in?"she asked, her voice steady, revealing nothing.He stammered out a reply as she walked past him, stopping just before the stairs."Who is it?"Allie shouted from the kitchen, and the woman turned at the sound of her voice."It's your mother.Noah finally answered, and immediately after he said it he heard the sound of breaking glass."I knew you would be here," Anne Nelson said to her daughter as the three of them sat around the coffee table in the living room."How could you be so sure?""You're my daughter.One day when you have kids of your own, you'll know the answer. "She smiled, but her manner was stiff, and Noah imagined how difficult this must be for her."I saw the article, too, and I saw your reaction.I also saw how tense you've been during the last couple of weeks, and when you said you were going shopping near the coast, I knew exactly what you meant. ""What about daddy?"Anne Nelson shook her head, "No, I didn't tell your father or anyone else about it.Nor did I tell anyone where I was going today. ""Why did you come?"Allie asked."I came because I had to," her mother said, "which I'm sure is the same reason you came.Am I right?"Allie nodded.Anne turned to Noah."I know you don't think so, but I always liked you.I just didn't think you were right for my daughter.Can you understand that?"He shook his head as he answered."No, not really.It wasnt fair to me, and it wasn't fair to Allie.Otherwise she wouldn't be here. "She watched him as he answered, but she said nothing.Allie, sensing an argument, cut in."What do you mean when you say you had to come?Don't you trust me?"Anne turned back to her daughter."This has nothing to do with trust.This has to do with Lon.He called the house last night to talk to me about Noah, and he's on his way here right now.He seemed very upset.I thought you'd want to know. "Allie inhaled sharply."He's on his way?""As we speak.He arranged to have the trial postponed until next week.If he's not in New Bern yet, he's close. ""What did you say to him?""Not much.But he knew.He had it all figured out.He remembered my telling him about Noah a long time ago.Allie swallowed hard, "Did you tell him I was here?""No.And I won't.That's between you and him.But knowing him, I'm sure he'll find you.All it takes is a couple of phone calls to the right people.After all, I was able to find you,"  Allie, though obviously wearied, smiled at her mother."Thank you," she said, and her mother readied for her hand."I know we've had our differences, Allie, and that we haven't seen eye to eye on everything.But I'm your mother and that means Ill always love you. "Allie was silent for a moment, then: "What should I do?""I dont know, Allie, That's up to you.But I would think about it.Think about what you really want.Allie turned away, her eyes reddening.A moment later a tear drifted down her cheek."I don't know " She trailed off, and her mother squeezed her hand.Anne looked at Noah, who had been sitting with his head down, listening carefully.As if on cue, he returned her gaze, nodded and left the room.When he was gone, Anne whispered, "Do you love him?""Yes, I do," Allie answered softly, "very much. ""Do you love Lon?""Yes, I do.I love him, too.Dearly, but in a different way.He doesn't make me feel the way Noah does. ""No one will ever do that," her mother said, and she released Allie's hand."I can't make this decision for you, Allie, this one's all yours.I want you to know, though, that I love you.And I always will.I know that doesn't help, but it's all I can do. "She reached in her handbag and removed a bundle of letters held together with string, the envelopes old and slightly yellowed."These are the letters that Noah wrote to you.I never threw them away, and they haven't been opened.I know I shouldn't have kept them from you, and I'm sorry for that.But I was just trying to protect you.I didn't realize  Allie took them and ran her hand over them, shocked."I should go, Allie.You've got some decisions to make, and you don't have much time.Do you want me to stay in town?Allie shook her head, "No, this is up to me. "Anne nodded and watched her daughter for a moment, wondering.Finally she stood, went around the table, leaned over and kissed Allie on the cheek.She could see the confusion in her daughter's eyes as Allie embraced her.They stood together for another minute, just holding each other."Thanks for coming, Allie said, I love you. ""I love you too. "As her mother made her way out of the living room, Allie thought that she heard her whisper, "Follow your heart, but she couldnt be sure,   NOAH OPENED the door for Anne Nelson as she went out.Goodbye Noah," she said quietly.He nodded without speaking.There wasn't anything else to say; they both knew that.She turned from him and left, closing the door behind her.Noah watched her dim away without looking back.She was a strong woman, he thought to himself, and he knew then where Allie got it  Noah peeped into the living room, saw Allie sitting with her head down, then went to the back porch, knowing that she needed to be alone.He sat quietly in his rocker and watched the water  After what seemed like an eternity he heard the back door open.He didnt turn to look at her for some reason he couldnt and he listened as she sat in the chair beside him.Im sorry," Allie said."I bad no idea this would happen. "Noah shook his head."Don't be sorry.We both knew it was coming to some form or another. ""Its still hard."I know. "He finally turned to her, reaching for her hand."Is here anything I can do to make it easier?"She shook her head."No.Not really.I have to do this alone.Besides, I'm not sure what I'm going to say to him yet. "She looked down and her voice became softer."I guess it depends on him and low much he knows.If my mother was right, he may have suspicions, but he doesn't know anything for sure. "Noah felt tightness in his stomach.When he finally spoke his voice was steady, but she could hear the pain in it."You're not going to tell him about us, are you?""I don't know.I really don't.While I was in the living room, I kept asking myself what I really wanted in my life. "She squeezed his hand."And do you know what the answer was?The answer was that I want you.I want us.I love you and I always have. "She took a deep breath before going on."But I also want a happy ending without hurting anyone.And I know that if I stayed, people would be hurt.Especially Lon.I wasn't lying when I told you that I love him.He doesn't make me feel the same way you do, but I care for him, and this wouldn't be fair to him.But staying here would also hurt my family and friends.I would be betraying everyone I know I don't know if I can do that. ""You can't live your life for other people.You've got to do what's right for you, even if it hurts some people you love. ""I know," she said, "but no matter what I choose I have to live with it.For ever.I have to be able to go forward and not look back any more.Can you understand that?"He shook his head and tried to keep his voice steady."Not really.Not if it means losing you.I can't do that again. "She didn't say anything but lowered her head.Noah went on: "Could you really leave me without looking back?"She bit her lip as she answered.Her voice was beginning to crack."I don't know.Probably not. ""Would that be fair to Lon?"She didn't answer.Instead she stood up, wiped her face and walked to the edge of the porch where she leaned against the post and watched the water before answering quietly: "No. ""It doesn't have to be like this, Allie," he said."We're adults now, we have the choice we didn't have before.We're meant to be together.We always have been. "He walked to her side and put his hand on her shoulder."I don't want to live the rest of my life thinking about you and dreaming of what might have been.Stay with me, Allie. "Tears filled her eyes."I don't know if I can," she whispered."You can.Allie I can't live my life happily knowing you're with someone else.That would kill a part of me.What we have is rare.It's too beautiful to just throw it away. "After a moment he gently turned her towards him, took her hands and stared at her, willing her to look at him.Allie finally faced him with moist eyes.After a long silence, Noah brushed the tears from her cheeks with his fingers.His voice caught as he saw what her eyes were telling him."You're not going to stay, are you?"He smiled weakly."You want to, but you can't. ""Oh, Noah," she said as the tears began again, "try to understand "  He shook his head to stop her."I know what you're trying to say I can see it in your eyes.But I don't want to understand it, Allie.I don't want it to end this way.I don't want it to end at all.But if you leave, we both know we'll never see each other again. "She leaned into him and began to cry harder as Noah fought back his own tears.He wrapped his arms around her."Allie, I can't force you to stay with me.But no matter what happens in my life, I'll never forget these last couple of days with you.I've been dreaming about this for years. "He kissed her gently, and they embraced as they had when she first got out of her car two days ago.Finally Allie let him go and wiped her tears."I have to get my things, Noah. "He didn't go inside with her.Instead he sat down in the rocker, spent.He watched her go into the house and listened as the sound of her movements faded into nothing.She emerged minutes later with everything she'd brought and walked towards him with her head down.She handed him the drawing she had done yesterday morning."Here, Noah.I made this for you. "Noah took the drawing and unrolled it slowly.The image in the foreground, which occupied most of the page, was a picture of how he looked now.Noah noticed that she had pencilled in every detail of his face.It was almost as if she'd copied it from a recent photograph.The second image was the front of the house.The detail there was also incredible, as if she had sketched it while sitting beneath the oak tree."It's beautiful, Allie.Thank you. "He attempted a smile."I told you that you were an artist. "She nodded, her face cast downwards, her lips pressed together.
