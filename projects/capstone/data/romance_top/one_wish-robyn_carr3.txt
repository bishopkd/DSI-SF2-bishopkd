What?The girls, she said.They crush on you!And some of them are beautiful!And look older than me, by the way!Does that ever worry you?Worry me in what way?he asked, his brow crinkling.What if one of them got the wrong signals?Thought you were romantically interested or something?He chuckled.They do all the time, but not because of anything I dobecause of their imaginative, nubile young minds mixed with the irresponsibility of raging hormones.Grace, teachers have to play it real safe or find themselves in a bad place.What does that mean?He shrugged.There are very specific guidelines.We dont touch the students, except maybe a hand on an arm or shoulder to say, Wait up a second.We can never have private conversations with students with doors closed.We dont give them a lift home even in a nice little town like this.We dont make gestures that could be interpreted as seductive, and we dont respond to such gesturesthe list is long.And its not just for young male teachers but for all teachersyoung women, old women, crusty old codgers, guys like me.Counselors like Iris.If she closes her office door, the door to the main hallway is closed to the passersby, but all the offices are internal cubicles that share a common hall between them so that a conversation can be private but if someone yelled or called out, it could be heard.Counselors, principals, nursesthey have to be afforded a degree of privacy to do their work.Students need to feel safe.I, however, am always seen in a crowd.During my private conversations with students, the door to the classroom is open.And were on opposite sides of the desk.But has it happened, Troy?That some girl takes her crush too far?You understand that I like women, but women my own age, right?Im not tempted by children.High school students are minors.And our school system forbids fraternization with students even of legal age, like eighteen year olds.There is absolutely no compromise there.Of course, she said.But...To a certain degree, there are some normal feelings in the mix for the kids.Little girls sit on their daddys laps and promise to marry them and the fact is, they probably will marry a man just like their father.Crushing on teachers is not unusual, but theyre children and its the adult teachers job to keep that from escalating.You get to be good at recognizing the signs and creating appropriate distance and barriers before...He stopped.He pulled up behind her building and parked.He turned to her.Gracie, why are you asking me this?I just thought it must sometimes be challenging.He rubbed a knuckle along her cheek.Honey, were you molested?Assaulted?By an older man or teacher?Someone in a position of authority?Me?she asked, genuinely shocked.No!No, of course not.Then you knew someone who was, he said matter of factly.Boy, did she!Years ago, and it all ended so tragically it marked one of the most traumatic experiences of her life.But that was not the direction Grace wanted this conversation to go.Not tonight.So she smiled gently.You must either be a very wonderful teacher or so intuitive its scary, she said.Once, I thought someone I knew was a victim, a younger girl, but even though I had suspicions, I never had proof.She wasnt a good friend of mine, just a girl I knew.Seriously, I didnt bring it up to discuss thatthat was so long ago.I really was curious about how you manage the situation with the students.Id have asked Iris all the same questions if it had ever come up.It was the dance that brought it to mind.Some of those girls are gorgeous.And you do kind of make them giggle.The really scary part is I dont have to do much to make them giggle.Theres a real dearth of young teachers in Thunder Point.Another one who gets their constant attention is Coach Lawson.But he doesnt have female students.He leaned toward her and put a small kiss on her lips.You must be exhausted.She gave him a little smile.Would you like to come up?If you think you can stay awake awhile...Come on up, she said.She hummed under her breath all the way up the back stairs to her little loft, and right inside the door, she turned to him and, for once, she made the advance.She put her arms around his neck and kissed him like she really meant business.Whoa, he said.Would you like a glass of wine?I think we should have a little talk.He paused for a moment.Should I go down to the flower fridge for the wine?he finally asked.No, tonight is this very special Shiraz.I hope you like it.She picked up a bottle from the counter and handed it to him so he could look at it.But Troy frowned, as if he was worried about what was coming.Let me open it for you so we can get to the talking part.She turned to grab the corkscrew, then picked up the two glasses that shed set out earlier.Where are we talking?he asked as he shed his coat and tie.How about right in here?she said, carrying the glasses to the little living room.She put the glasses on the coffee table, kicked off her shoes and got comfortable.Why do you look worried?Because this seems planned and I have no idea whats coming.I hope its not bad news.I hope so, too.Open that wine and let it breathe.While he did that, she took a deep breath.Troy, Ive never been to a high school dance before tonight.He stopped twisting the corkscrew for a second, then looked at her.He pulled the cork.A lot of kids dont go to the dances, Gracie.I bet you did, she said.I did, he admitted.But by now you know meIm a flirt.I get along with everyone.Im the fun coach.I almost always had a girlfriend or at least a date.I didnt date just anyone, thoughIm no man whore.Im not a screw around kind of guy.Troy, I never went to a high school dance because I never went to a high school.He seemed to be momentarily confused.Boarding school?Some private academy?She shook her head.Homeschooled.With tutors.And some classes here and there?Some, she said.Small groups of tutored kids, now and then.Mostly independent study with guidance and lots of tests to track my progress.Wow.Youll have to share that study plan with me someday.It seems to have worked.Youre very accomplished for someone who never went to high school.I didnt say they were lazy tutors, she said.I learned things a lot of high school students wouldnt even get to.But theres a reason Im telling you this, Troy.Ive also never had a boyfriend.He chuckled.Thats very hard to believe.Youre beautiful.Oh, I had a couple of bad dates, but thats about all.I just wasnt in the mainstream of life like other young women.See, I said my parents were gone and thats true, sort of.My father died when I was only fourteen and my mother and I fell out five years ago.We had an argument about what I wanted to do with my life.She comes from moneyshes very spoiled and demanding.Shes a diva, thats the only way to describe her.The very thought of me in the back of a florists shop, filthy, lifting big pots, driving to residences to deliver flowers, being the help at weddings and funerals...Grace shrugged.She was mortified.We had a standoff.She wanted me to live at home with her, follow in her footsteps, plan charity events, travel with her, let her...Well, she probably had some guy lined up for me from somewhere.We never got that far in a discussion.I wasnt interested.I wanted my own life and I wanted it simple.We havent spoken in years.Its very sad.Its for the best, I think.By his expression, he was stunned.He reached out and grabbed her shoulder.Grace...Im sorry.Thank you.Maybe someday it will sort itself out.What I really want you to know is...She lifted her chin bravely.Troy, Im not like Iris.Im not like other girls.Im probably less experienced than some of your students.Ive never had a guy I really liked before.Im pretty lame at it.Youre doing very well, he said with a smile.He poured them each a glass of wine.She took a sip.Then a breath.Well, even though youre probably going to figure it out anyway, I thought you should knowI dont know much about men.Just what my boyfriends in my romances told me.Thats it.He raised one eyebrow.And how am I going to figure that out?When you realize I dont have any idea what to do!Youre going to guess, if we do decide to do it, that Ive never done it before.You will be my first unless you run for your life right now.She grinned at him.No pressure.He grinned right back.Im not worried, Gracie.Are you?She nodded.Maybe a little, she said.Want me to tell you how its going to be?Again she nodded.The first time its going to be very slow and safe.Were going to kiss until were steamy.Were going to touch and get so close we can feel each others heartbeat.He leaned over and gently kissed her cheek and her throat and she let her head drop back and closed her eyes.Were going to lie down together and lose some clothes...Well discover each other.Im going to touch you in all your special places and youre going to touch me when youre ready.Well ease into things slowly and carefully, but the most important thing is, you can say no or stop whenever you dont want to go any further.Even if were naked and breathing hard, if you say stop, we stop.Her eyes were still closed and she whispered into his cheek.I dont use anything...I do, he said.When is this going to happen?she asked.In a hurry, Grace?She shrugged.Well, when I make a decision...Were going to enjoy a glass of wine.Then, if youre ready, youll let me know.* * *  				Troy hadnt been prepared for thisa twenty eight year old woman as beautiful and funny as Grace, a virgin.He would have expected her to have sexual history, like most women her age.Some had a lot of notches, some only a few, but hed never encountered none before.Even his first girl, his first experience, wasnt a virgin.Shed had a serious boyfriend before him.Of course, just because he was a flirt and liked to have girlfriends didnt mean hed been a sexual prodigy.He had sex for the first time at nearly the end of his first year of college.At eighteen, he was the last among his buddies, unless they were lying.They were probably lying.Of course they were lying.At least mostly lying.He took this very seriously, making love to Grace.It had to be a good experience for her and he was definitely eager to take on the challenge.He just hoped there wasnt some virgin consciousness that would have her leaning toward true love and marriage because of sex.He wasnt opposed to that in the long run, he just didnt want it all to happen in one night.He was crazy about her, couldnt wait to get inside her, didnt see any red flags that would warn him to get out of this relationshiphe just needed time to get more serious.This is how grown ups court.They have dates, they discover common interests, they examine their rapport, they go to bed together, they ask, Does this have staying power?They kissed and whispered their way through a glass of wine, then Troy took hers out of her hand and put it on the coffee table.He stood and pulled her to her feet and led her toward the bedroom, which was only about ten feet away.When they stood beside the bed, he took her gently into his arms and kissed her some more, drawing deep sighs from her.Then she turned in his arms and presented her back, pulling her hair away, and he saw the zipper for her dress.He drew it down slowly, taking a taste of her neck in the process.He pushed the dress off her shoulders and she let it fall, leaving her in a silky black slip.She stepped out of the dress and bent to pick it up, but he took it from her and turned to drape it across the only chair in the room.He got rid of his belt and shirt and when he turned back to her, she had removed her hose and kicked them aside.She was a determined little thing; he wasnt going to find going slowly an easy thing.When she sat on the bed he withdrew a couple of condoms from his pocket.Do you have to put them out now?she asked.Believe me, I do, he said.He let the pants drop, kicked them off and they joined the clothes on the chair.He sat beside her, embraced her, pulled her down beside him and rolled a little, adjusting till their bodies were flush and tight.There, he said, feeling every curve of her against him.Perfect.And he was ready.I can feel your heart, he said.He ran his hands down her back and over her butt.She was so firm and solid.The flower business must be good exercise, he said, chuckling softly.Her hands were on his chest, caressing every inch of him, kissing his chest, his neck, his mouth and all the time wiggling up against him.He still wore his boxers, but they were doing nothing to keep his secrets.He pushed himself between her legs without really meaning tohe was on automatic pilot.Lets get rid of this, he said, pulling a strap of the slip down over her shoulder.She sat up and drew the silky garment over her head and tossed it aside, leaving her in nothing but a tiny thong.And that, he thought, wouldnt get in his way for a second.But to level the playing field and give her a chance to get used to him, he shed his boxers.There they were.In all their basic glory.He pulled her hand, drawing it to him.She didnt hesitate; she put both hands on him and hummed softly as she figured him out.Easy does it, he said.There were so many things he wanted to do to her, but not the first time.Hed like to lick her whole body, make her come before she even knew what hit her.Hed like to lift her onto his lap and watch her ride; hed like to take her against the shower wall.Not this time, he told himself.He had promised it would be slow and safe and he never broke a promise.He slid his hand under her thong.Open for me, honey, he said, giving her thighs a nudge.He slid one finger into her silkiness.Then two fingers.Wow, she wasnt going to need much warming up.He massaged her for a few seconds and she was squirming against his hand, almost whimpering.He slid a finger inside.You okay?he asked in a whisper.Okay, she whispered back.This has to go, he said, pulling her thong down.She kicked it away as he turned to the bedside table and retrieved a condom, quickly rolling it on.If he didnt suit up, she was going to climb all over him.She was straining toward him, making beautiful little noises.He turned her on her back, spread her legs with a knee and placed himself in the zone.Leaning down to her lips once more, he whispered against them.Ready to see how this works?he asked.Yes, she whispered back, her eyes closed.Look at me, Gracie.She opened her eyes.I want you to go limp...relax everything.Its not going to hurt.Are you sure?Im sure.He pressed himself against her.Nice and easy, he said.Its okay.Its good.And he pressed into her very, very slowly.He kissed her deeply as he went all the way.She moaned.Okay?he asked.Mmm, she murmured.Okay.But damned if he was!This was the best place hed been in a very long time.And she hugged him like a velvet vise.A quivering, soft, slick vise.He was dying.He started to move, slowly, looking for that sweet spot, pressing deeply into her, listening to the sounds she made, trying to judge them for the right spot, the right friction, the perfect stimulation for her.As for himself, if he unclenched his molars for one second, he was gone.Oh.She sighed.Oh!Oh!Oh!Oh, yeah, he said.Please, she said, gripping his shoulders.More.Please!He moved a little harder, hanging on for dear life.He took her mouth again, kissing her deeply as he moved inside.Youre beautiful, baby, he whispered.Youre perfect.I think maybe youre perfect, she said.Only with you, he said.With you I feel perfect.And he followed that with a kiss.And a thrust.She came apart.She clenched him inside her body, drawing on him, leaving him to wonder if it was his expert moves or the words.Then thinking stopped.She closed her eyes, tilted her head back and her pelvis forward, upward, bit her lip and if he could see, hed bet she curled her toes.So he did what came naturally, thrusting a couple more times and having the best orgasm of his life, right then, right there, with her.His eyes teared; his brain clouded over and he wondered if he lost consciousness for a second.He pulsed until there was nothing left in him.Even his brain was empty; her body was still holding him for so long he was amazed.She rode through it with him, the whole way.He pressed his lips softly to hers, kissing her gently.She didnt move.He gave her another kiss.She still held him in a beautiful, delicious, unimaginable grip.Gracie, he whispered.Breathe.She let out her breath in a slow whoosh.Holy shit!she said.He smiled.Nice?Mmm, she said, her lips curving into a smile.He chuckled.Just when I was wondering what to get you for Valentines Day...Oh.My.God.Do it again.He laughed.Maybe in a little bit, he said, but there was really no maybe about it.No regrets?Youre kidding, right?I might not have figured it out, he admitted.Except I also might not have tried so hard to go slowly and patiently.Because, really, Gracie, you had me in a real vulnerable spot there for a while.I did?You did.We came together like old pros.If I hadnt told you, what would you have done?I think Id have just gone for it.I think first, to be sure you had everything you deserved, Id have licked your whole body.Then I would have just gone for it.Okay.Well do that next time!He couldnt help but laugh at her, she was so damn cute.You like sex, dont you, sweetheart?I like sex, she admitted, smiling.Oh, God, is that a slutty thing to say?No, Gracie.He brushed her rich brown hair back from her brow.Its the perfect thing to say.* * *  				They made love again and again.Troy knew he was screwed, and not in the usual way.He had himself a beautiful young woman who thought he was pure magic, who would do anything he wanted to do, bring him greater satisfaction than he could remember having and...and he didnt know anything about her.Added to that, he wasnt sure what had caused it, but being the first man to ever get inside her like that really did something to his head.A kind of possessiveness consumed him; he couldnt even think about letting her go.But who was this young beauty who hadnt been properly loved until now?Who asked questions about whether it was difficult being a young male teacher surrounded by teenage girls with crushes?Who was this young woman whod never been in a traditional classroom yet who seemed to be smarter and more worldly than other women her age?And did mothers and daughters really part ways over the choice to own a flower shop?He was lying on his belly in her bed, thinking about how he was going to get the answers to these questions when he felt her small hand, slightly calloused from hard work, slide over his buttocks.You have the nicest guy booty Ive ever seen.Roll me over and see what else Ive got thats nice, he said.Im afraid to, she said with a laugh.I think youve had enough.And Ive definitely had enough!Feeling a little tender?She nodded and blushed.He laughed.After the gymnastics of last night, how can you blush?he asked her.Its daylight, she said.Better yet, he said, rolling over to show off his rather impressive morning erection.Oh, my, she said.Keep that thing away from me!He ignored her and pulled her into his arms.Lets talk about how to have fun when were feeling a little...delicate.And he began kissing his way down her body, over her belly, between her thighs.Just a few minutes later he had to say again, Gracie.Breathe.Oh, God, she said weakly.His pleasure couldnt have been greater.Is it my turn now?she asked.Not this time, honey, he said, hoisting himself out of the bed.Much as Id like to lie around in bed all day, I have things to do.I have to get ready for classes tomorrow and Im working at Coopers all afternoon and evening.You should nap, rest up.If you want me to drop by later to make sure youre okay, just say the word.The word, she said with a smile.Would you like me to take you to breakfast at the diner before I start my chores?he asked.Would you?I definitely would.You make a man hungry, but I have to go home first and, you know...freshen up.She laughed softly.I guess it wouldnt do to go out to breakfast in last nights clothes.Not to mention...Dont mention it, he suggested, knowing where that was going.The scent of sex was all over them.Even without that, anyone who saw her this morning was sure to know.She was wearing a very fetching whisker burn on her pink cheeks, her lips were bright and rosy from a night of kissing and that sleepy twinkle in her eye said everything.Here was a very happy, satisfied lady.Ill be back in thirty minutes.Six  				An hour and a half later, breakfast done, Troy was back in his apartment, where he was not planning to do any school preparation.Instead, he got on the internet.He had a couple of hours before he had to be out at the beach bar.He didnt expect to find anything, unless perhaps there had been some kind of molestation and charges were filed, but if Grace had been a minor, her name wouldnt have been included.He typed her name into the search bar and the italicized question popped back:  				Do you mean Isabella Izzy Grace Dillon Banks?Just for grins, he clicked on the name, expecting to see the picture of a sixty year old opera singer.Are you shitting me?he asked the empty room.Figure Skating Gold Medalist walks out of the Vancouver arena and doesnt look back.It was her in the picture.Izzy Banks?Gold medalist?Retired at the age of twenty three?It just didnt compute.Was that something you didnt think to mention?Although Izzy apparently issued a statement, she refused all interviews.He read her statement.The figure skating community and competition has been very good to me and Im tremendously grateful to my family, my mother, the intrepid Winnie Dillon Banks, my coach Mikhail Petrov, U. S.  Figure Skating, and every friend and competitor Ive known over the past twenty years, but this is my time to exit.There are so many wonderful athletes prepared to have their chance and, believe me, I wont be missed for long.I crave a quieter life.Troy was stunned.He almost couldnt inhale.How was this possible?There were a number of articles and much conjecture, comparing Izzy to other athletes who, exhausted and overloaded, perhaps depressed, crashed after a big win and retreated.She wasnt the only story, for sure.There were a few differences that stood out to him, maybe because of their conversation just the night before.A grievance was filed against her with U. S.  Figure Skating by figure skating coach Hal Nordstrom, a world famous coach whose students had won many medals.He alleged slander and defamation of character.The direct quote seemed to be well known but wasnt in the article.Apparently when a fifteen year old student of Nordstrom committed suicide Izzy Banks, then eighteen, commented that he mishandled his students and drove them to tragic ends with his sexual misconduct.No charges were filed against the coach, no corroborative complaints emerged, no other students stepped forward and there was no evidence against the man.The grievance was dismissed; Izzy had uttered an opinion in the presence of other skaters in training, their coaches and parentsit didnt say how many.There were comments from Nordstroms other students that had nothing to do with sexual misconduct.They claimed hed taken his student, Shannon Fields, out of his number one slot and put another skater in it and some believed she was despondent with disappointment and jealousy after so many years of hard work.No one seemed sure why she took her own life.But Troy knew.He knew Grace.If she said a younger skater had been molested, she thought she knew something.It didnt mean she was wrong just because she had no evidence.Nordstrom sued Izzy and her mother in a civil court.There was an undisclosed settlement.He read other articles.Grace had been trailed by not one but three stalkers.She was hardly the only internationally known athlete with this burden, but she was one of only a few who had actually been kidnapped.It wasnt for more than a few hours, but he couldnt imagine how terrifying it must have been.That particular stalker was captured, arrested, prosecuted and hospitalized.His name was Bruno Feldman and he was schizophrenic and delusional, which made him ill but no less frightening or dangerous because of his illness.He typed her name into the search box again.There were over five thousand hits.As far as he knew, no one in Thunder Point had any idea who she really was.His little flower girl had accomplished things most people never dared dream of and, apparently, the price had been high.He had an overwhelming urge to run to her, take her into his arms and tell her she was safe now.Instead, he took his laptop with him to work at Coopers, where he planned to read more on the sly when he wasnt too busy.He was at the bar by noon.There were ten people, all inside.Cooper and his young brother in law, Landon, were behind the bar.Troy was barely in the door when two patrons left.He hung up his coat and put his backpack under the bar.If the weatherman is right, it shouldnt be too busy today.Just the occasional Sunday driver, Cooper said.Sunny Sundays were typically pretty busy.Whats the weatherman saying?Guess?Wind and rain.The babys trying to get a tooth so were going to look at a couple of cars for Landon, Cooper said.Trucks, Landon corrected.Maybe trucks, Cooper clarified.I thought you had a truck, Troy said.It pretty much bit the dust and has been retired, Cooper said.Landon needs some reliable wheels so I dont have to drive to Eugene every time he feels like a weekend at home.And this has what to do with a tooth?Both guys winced.You have no idea how hard it is to get a tooth, Cooper said.Apparently she has to work on it twenty four hours a day and it makes her very pissy.Shes not happy about anything right now, Landon said.Were getting out of there.Troy laughed.Poor Sarah.I did my shift last night, Cooper said.If its stormy and empty, close early.Six or so?Ill stay as long as you want me, Troy said, but he knew if the weather was bad, the bar hardly ever saw business after sunset and sunset came early in February.In football season, thered be people inside watching the game, but that was past.You decide, Cooper said.Lets go, Landon.Have a good day.And thanks.By midafternoon there was just one couple in the bar, drinking Bloody Marys and eating sandwiches at a table by the fire.Troy checked the kitchen and dishwasher, but as usual Cooper had left the place spotless and organized.In winter this was a one man operation, but in summer it took a full crewthere were lots of people on the beach, renting paddleboards and kayaks, eating and drinking, enjoying the bay and lighting fires on the beach at night, a constant flow of customers, sometimes until after ten.He brought a stool behind the bar and opened his laptop.There was enough information about Grace to fill a book.She even had her own Wikipedia page, as did her wealthy mother, Winnie Dillon Banks, a champion figure skater before her.There was a half brother, twenty years her senior, a child of her fathers by a previous marriage.One article explained the many ways people managed the expensive training without being wealthy, but such sponsors were difficult to come by before the athlete had at least come very close to winning major competitions.And to his surprise, the number of moneyed US and world medalists was quite small.Most of them, in fact the best known among them, had hardworking parents who got up at four in the morning to drive them long distances to rinks where the best coach could be found.Some moved to accommodate their young champions.By late afternoon the rain hit the deck outside and the last couple left, and he could get back to his research.Grace and her parents moved a few times; her father was sought after and drew a handsome coaching salary.He did not train Graces competitors, however.His income and notoriety, in addition to Winnies old family wealth, was a huge advantage for her.She didnt make the cut for the 2006 Winter Games and there was some talk of moving her to another country.Obviously they hadnt moved.Lord, who was this girl?He looked up Winnie Dillon Banks.There were dozens of pictures and all Troy could surmise from them was that she looked rich and cold.Many pictures of her watching her daughter skate in competition had her with a frozen face, wearing furs and diamonds.Thats when he knew they hadnt exactly fallen out over a flower shop.His best guess was that Winnie disapproved of her daughter leaving competition while she was still young enough to train and win.He looked up figure skating training.It was typical to be on skates by four years old.Six hours on the ice every day, endurance and weight training, ballet and gymnastics, school or, in Graces case, tutors.Add in travel to every competition that would take herfirst Nationals and then World Championships.He looked up international ice skating championships.Jesus, shed been to almost every country on the globe.He watched a couple of YouTube videos of her skating, a long program and a short program, one when she was only sixteen and competing in Seoul.It was the most amazing thing hed ever seen.She looked just the same.Did no one ever remark on her likeness to a womens figure skating champion?Her skill and beauty on the ice was nothing short of breathtaking.Next on his list to research was sexual misconduct by coaches.He felt his heart race.It was everywhere.There were some horrifically wrong allegations.One female coach had her life nearly ruined by an accusation that never even went to court as her alibi was actually on film, placing her far from the alleged victim at the time; yet, years later she was still banned from certain gyms, even after the child finally recanted.It sent shudders through him.He thought a person had to be crazy to leave their child in the hands of a stranger even if he or she was a renowned coach.To get a reality check, he searched the same subject with teachers and it was just as shocking, some cases getting national attention and being made into television movies.I just thought it must sometimes be challenging...He closed the laptop and turned on lights around the bar, though if anyone was out in this storm, hed be amazed.He had a lot to process.It was almost five and the sun might just be on its downward path, but with the clouds it was already dark.He got himself a beer.Hed known Grace for a year, maybe a little more.He only knew her superficiallyhe had gone into her shop to buy flowers for Iris twice and once to pick out an arrangement to be sent to his mother for Mothers Day.Hed seen her at Coopers with Iris.He didnt even really think of her as a friend but rather as one of Iriss friends.Hed liked her but never thought about hernot before Christmas.Hed been looking right through her.He had no idea there was so much to Grace.She was amazing and complicated, part heroic, part tragic.And after last night, more woman than he ever imagined.Little virgin flower girl, a little shy, a little curious and cautious and, oh, God, so willing, trusting and sensual.So loving and innocent.She asked him to take her there, to sex and passion, then put herself in his hands.And man, what a ride.Shes an athlete, you dope, he said to no one in the bar.Whos an athlete?Sarah Cooper asked, just coming in the door.She shook off her slicker.Jesus, you scared me to death!he said.Wheres the baby?Finally sleeping.Hams babysitting.Sarah, Hams a dog.Best babysitter there is, trust me.Hes barely left her side since the day she was born.Dont worryshes in the crib and the bedroom door is closed, but I trust Ham more than most humans.And I only came over for a second.You should close the bar.Youre wasting your time out here.This deluge isnt exactly welcoming customers.Is there anything you need before you go?Besides to finish your beer?Ill just make a quick phone call, maybe take a couple of little pizzas from the coolerI have a date tonight, I hope.Thanks, I think youre right.No one has come in since two.She grinned at him, looking at the laptop.Get your homework done?I sure did, he said.And it was a load, too.Thanks for helping out, Troy.Stay dry.She pulled the hood of her slicker over her head and went out the back door.He picked up his phone.Gracie, he said.Thanks to the weather, Im closing up early.Would you like me to bring you dinner?I cooked!I cooked, hoping you would come here for dinner!Your kitchen is the size of my closet.What did you cook?Crock Pot chili.A brick of cheddar and crackers.If I had a fireplace up here, it would be perfect.Its already perfect, he thought.Ill be there in a little while.It sounds great.He wasnt going to tell her what he knew.He decided right then, he was going to wait for her.When she was comfortable, when she trusted him to know that part of her life, when she finally confided in him, he might tell her hed known for a while.Might.* * *  				A week later, when Troy was just packing up his papers to take home, he caught a flash of color out of the corner of his eye and turned to see Iris leaning in his classroom doorway.She was wearing a sly grin.I saw you and Grace at the basketball game last night, she said.We said hello, Troy said, frowning slightly, not understanding.I was too busy in the concession stand to chat, but not too busy to notice.Notice what?he asked.You are officially completely over me.He smiled and put his papers in his backpack.Im over you, he said.I hope youre not offended.You are married, after all.She walked toward him.I saw the way you looked at Grace.I was glad you and Grace were hanging out, but its a lot more than that.Troy, this makes me happy.Grace is wonderful and I love her.And youre one of my best friends.Then she laughed.Theres the final proof!You didnt wince when I called you a best friend!Theres a lot more to Grace than meets the eye, he said, zipping the backpack.I think youre falling in love, Troy.Easy, Iris.Thats a powerful diagnosis.And I dont think you can make it.He picked up the backpack.My complexion has cleared up, thats all.She laughed at him.I hear the hearts of dozens of sixteen year old girls breaking.Dont even joke about that, he said, suddenly very serious.That could be a world of trouble a teacher doesnt need.Oh, Troy, you havent had a problem in that area, have you?No ones making you nervous, I hope.He didnt want to explain the situation with Grace, that her questions on this issue combined with what he thought hed learned from his research brought the whole thing closer to the surface of his thinking.No, not at all, its just that its a real slippery slope, that relationship.Sometimes Im afraid to make even the most innocent joke.Know what I mean?Listen, your behavior has always been above reproach, but if youre ever worried about the smallest gesture or comment, come to me immediately.Dont take a chance on seeing where it goes.We dont fool around with that stuff.Good.Thats good to know because He ran a hand around the back of his neck.I read an article over the weekend about a coach whose life was nearly destroyed by accusations of impropriety with a youngster and she wasnt even in the same city at the time.It filled me with cold dread.Made me think way too much.I understand.I get the willies about similar situations in counseling now and then.All I have to do is hear about a terrible counselor, one who does grave damage, and I dont sleep for a couple of nights.But if youre not facing any problems, try to relax and be yourself.The kids love you.And youve been consistently great with boundaries.And now youre in love on top of everything else.Dont get ahead of yourself, Iris, he said, but he smiled when he said it.Ive only been seeing Grace for a couple of months.He was suddenly aware that hed dated Iris for months, thought they were a perfect couple and yet had never uttered those three important words.When did you know you loved Seth?he asked, suddenly curious.When I was about four, but he was busy playing the field all through high school.Since he never noticed me as anything more than a buddy, an outfielder or tutor, I hated him.Youre married to him.I guess you got that straightened out.Yeah, she said a little wistfully.Luckily.She collected herself.Well.If you can be half as happy as I am, you wont know what to do with yourself.Want to go get a beer?I cant, he said.Im going to mind the flower shop while Grace meets with some couple about their wedding flowers.Grace has Justin doing some deliveries but no steady part time help yet.Its just Grace, sometimes closing the shop to deliver flowers, unless I can help her.She told me.We talked about student help for her, but its kind of late in the year to start any kind of work study situation.I posted an after school help position on the bulletin board, but...I hope something turns up for her.Hey, tomorrow Ill be out at Cooperscome on out.Ill treat.Bring Prince Charming.Ill even buy him a beer.Youre on, she said.Troy drove to the flower shop, parked in the alley right behind the Pretty Petals van and went in the back door.Grace was finishing the creation of an arrangement at her big messy worktable, but he didnt care.He grabbed her around the waist and pulled her against him, kissing her hard.Troy, stop it, Im filthy.I know.Filthy is good.We can get a little filthy later if you feel like it.He picked up her hand and looked at the green and brown fingers, ick under her nails.Jeez, this is ugly work.Who knew?Youd think working with flowers would be more attractive.Are you sending me home after I help here?Do I ever send you home?What do you want to do for dinner?I grabbed one of Carries meals from the deliteriyaki chicken, rice, asparagus and cheesecake.Will that do it for you?He kissed her neck.For my first meal.Then Im having you.She laughed, pushing him away.I have to run upstairs and scrub up a little bit, she said, taking off the green apron.She hung it on the hook by the door.If the Jackson Paulson couple comes in before Im back, just put them in my office, will you?Ill be right back.Sure, he said.When shed gone upstairs, he looked around at the mess.Miss Gracie had had a busy day at the flower shop.The big worktable and floor were covered with clippings, stems, florists foam, tape, all manner of rocks and a couple of glue guns.He put her arrangement in the cooler, picked up the glue guns and swept off the debris on the table onto the floor.The second hed done that, he realized he was an idiot.Now the rocks and in some cases what looked like flattened marbles pinged around the floor.If he wasnt pretty quick with a broom, someone could break a hip.He immediately started sweeping a path away from her office door.It could be unpleasant if her customers fell and broke their backs.He was quick about it.He liked it when Gracie thought he was the perfect man and really didnt want to expose himself as just another stupid guy who didnt think.It didnt take him long to have a nice pile of trash between the back door and the cooler.Just in time, too.The bell on the door tinkled and the couple came in.Its just bullshit, Janet.We dont need all this, a mans voice said.Maybe I need it, the woman said, her voice watery.I havent asked too much and I work for every dime.You want a house?he asked meanly.Yes, but not a new truck!she threw back.You want a baby?he flung.When we can afford it, but I dont want to just skip the wedding!I know you dont care, but I care!My mother cares!Then your mother should pay for it!You know my mother has nothing!And thats what were going to have!Nothing!I thought you wanted a wedding?she said in a near sob.I thought so, too, until I saw the list of things we have to buy!I wanted a band, a keg and a good party!Now Im buying a goddamned coronation!The back door opened and Grace stepped in looking completely refreshed in a crisp white blouse, a little shine on her lips and her hair brushed.He wanted to eat her alive, gobble her up.Theyre fighting, he whispered.Happens all the time.Weddings are famous for it.She looked around.Oh, Troy, you cleaned up.She took a closer look at the table and floor.A little...You want me to mop?he asked.No, but thanks.Just mind the front of the store for me, and if someone comes in and needs something, please interrupt me.I can take two minutes while my clients look at pictures, run a sale, get back to them in no time.I work in a bar, Gracie.I can ring up a sale.If there are price tags.Everything is priced.Let any calls go to voice mail.She kissed him real quick on the lips.Thank you.You are so hard to wait for, he muttered under his breath as she walked away.He watched as she approached the tortured couple.Mr.Jackson?Ms.Paulson?Hi, Im Grace.Would you like to come back to my office and talk about your wedding flowers?Were fighting about the wedding, Ms.Paulson said.Well, Im here to lessen your wedding tension and help you find very practical and affordable options in the flower department.Dont worrylooking at pictures of bouquets and arrangements carries no obligation at all.I only want to help.Come with me.Would you like a cup of coffee?Tea?Bottled water?How about a beer, the groom said testily.I had to stop stocking beer, Grace said with a laugh.Too many stressed out, drunk grooms left my flower shop!Come right in here, let me get a couple of waters.She put them in the chairs in front of her desk and when she walked through the workroom to her cooler, she rolled her eyes at Troy, smiling a little.Troy went to the front of the store to stand sentry while Grace had her meeting with the bridal couple.She usually met with couples like this at six or later, after work for them, after closing for her.This particular couple had to schedule something a little earlier, so shed invited them to come at four, which was how Troy got this babysitting job.He positioned himself behind the small counter.There by the computer lay two phonesher personal and her work phone.Everywhere she went, two phones.When the shop was closed and they were together, she rarely answered the work phone.And the personal phone rarely rang.Shed gotten calls twice since theyd been a couple and both times it was Iris.He heard her tell the couple to start with this album.There arent any prices, the man said.Jake!the woman said.Thats a reasonable observation and question.Every bouquet and arrangement can be downsized or enlarged, depending on personal taste.For example, see this beautiful arrangement of roses, fern and calla lilies?I had a bride want a much smaller version of this with just the dusty miller and lilies plus a little babys breath.Ill be glad to itemize everything with cost per stalk, stem and vase.I dont know why were making it so fancy, Jake muttered.It neednt be, Grace said.Small weddings can be elegant, classy and memorable.In your life together there are going to be many moments youre going to want to capture in pictures.Youll be amazed when you get to your thirtieth anniversary how many boxes or albums or disks of pictures youll haveevery camping trip, T ball game, graduation, every family celebration.One of the first will be the day you marry.It doesnt have to be any certain kind of wedding, just the one you both want.And done the way you want to remember it.And theres the problem, Jake said.Janet wants a big fancy wedding and I dont.I dont need a big fancy wedding, she argued.I just want it to be beautiful!Completely doable.When you talk it over, youll find a reasonable compromise.Ill do whatever I can to help with that.Ive had couples who ordered so many flower arrangements and bouquets I thought I was outfitting the Rose Bowl.There was a recent wedding where the bride and her attendants each carried a single calla lily.The good news is...for a spring wedding literally every flower will be available and the prices will be more reasonable than at other times of the year.This is beautiful, Janet said, looking at a photo.Isnt this beautiful, Jake?I bet it cost a fortune, he snorted.Hmm, if I remember, that wedding ran about twelve hundred dollars.Are you freaking kidding me?Jake said.Flowers were very important to that couple, but they didnt have a fortune.Now, there are ways to bring the cost way down, to less than half of that, and still have a beautiful display.Bows instead of flowers on the ends of the pews, smaller altar arrangements or larger fluffier flowers and table centerpieces, less fussy bouquets for the attendants.Thats still a lot of money, he grumbled.When is the happy day?Grace asked.June twentieth.Perfect.A great month for flowers and flower prices.And do you have a budget?Just as Janet said six hundred dollars Jake said fifty.Troy made a noise as he tried to cover his burst of laughter.Let me start by asking you to select your favorite wedding photos from this book.It will help if you can come up with at least three you love and figure out why you love them.The particular blooms?The shapes?The arrangement of the flowers?The colors?Once you do that we can find the wiggle room in the ideas and the price, something that better fits your budget.Youre going to buy a lot of flowers in your lifetime, Jake.These flowers are going to live on forever in your wedding pictures.Im sure you and Janet will find exactly the right ones.Ill leave you to look through the pictures.Just call me if you have any questions.Ill be right out front, ten steps away.Troy was smirking as she walked out of the back room to where he stood behind the counter.He put an arm around her waist and whispered in her ear.Thats not going to work, he said.Youd be surprised, she said.I think I can handle things if you want to leave.Nah, Im not leaving you with this.I think Ill go get my backpack and start on those papers I have to look through.Then tonight I dont have to spend all my time on homework.Let me wipe down the worktable for you.For about twenty minutes the only sound in the shop was the soft murmuring of the bridal couple as they went through the albums.The loud and snappish remarks had stopped but when Troy glanced into the office, they really didnt appear happy.In a very short time they thought they had selected a few pictures and Grace sat at her desk once more.Very good choices, she said.Im sure theyre out of the question, Janet said.Theyre just too beautiful to be affordable.Well, lets see, Grace said.She sat at her computer and, after looking at one of the selected photos, she went to work.She began to type in numbers.And how many parents and attendants?Four parents, six grandparents, two ushers and four bridesmaids and groomsmen.This has been so stressful, Janet said.We cant afford a lot.The reception will kill us if we cant figure out a way to get our mothers to stop adding people to the guest list!Happens at absolutely every wedding, Grace said.Then she turned the screen toward the couple.Heres the package you like the bestit includes everything from bridal bouquets to altar arrangements to centerpieces for a reception that seats one hundred and forty.Even flowers for the mothers and boutonnieres for the men are included.The cost is steeptwenty four hundred fifty dollars.Jesus, Jake said, running a hand over his head.Now, lets take a closer look.Tell me your favorite things about these flowers?Janet pointed to the screen.I love this lavender color, this fullness is so beautiful, the lavender roses, oh, my!And this kind of faint green with the white.This altar arrangement is so rich looking and huge...Watch this, Grace said.Troy was too curious just sitting there.He wanted to see what she was doing and her back was to him.She was literally pulling flowers from the bottom of her computer screen and positioning them together.For the altar arrangements, a different flower, same color, the hydrangea for color, take out the expensive orchids, three or four lilies with two to five blooms per stalk, babys breath rather than fern and pale green dusty miller, some carnations for fullness and maybe accented with this white stephanotis.I can use a disposable paper pot that wont be visible under the draping flora instead of the square glass vase, or I can rent you the vases and you can return them reducing the cost.Voil!The cost is cut in half.Now, look at the bridal bouquetonce again, take out the big orchids but look what I can do with cymbidium orchids, a few lavender roses and daisies.Less expensive flowers, but still very beautiful, very appropriate in a summer wedding.If you dont love the daisies, I can use carnations or even white tea roses.And the bouquet is a bit smaller.The one you liked was three hundred.This would be one hundred.I can add roses pretty inexpensively if you want it bigger.Troy was astonished.Whatever program she was usingamazing.He had no idea this business could be so complicated or high tech.Let me show you something Ive used very successfully for table centerpieces.She clicked on a picture.A clear glass cylinder vase, flowers, white rocks, greenery at the baseI can do this for forty dollars per table.Or, I can tell you where to buy these glass vases and rocks very inexpensively and you can put the girlfriends to work and make it happen for less than twenty per table.Theyre beautiful, Janet said.Howd you do that?Jake asked.I buy in bulk, June prices should be good, I thinned the flowers and I know what everyone else charges.You cant do better and Ill make that a guarantee.Im going to suggest you get your bridesmaids or mothers or both together to fashion big white or lavender tulle bows for the pews.Skip the flowers, though they are so pretty.You can buy the tulle at a fabric shop like Jo Anns and save at least a couple hundred dollars and still have the decor of a fashionable and classy wedding.If they dont show you how to make the tulle bows, Ill be happy to.Now, those pew stands with candles are priceythey have to be rented and you can probably live without them if youre cutting costs.The things that really show in a wedding are the altar flowers, bouquets and table arrangements.I can work up an estimate for this package and email it to you if you like, but Im guessing this selection will be in the neighborhood of six to eight hundred.Plus delivery, which I do myself.I want my flowers presented perfectly.And, of course, I guarantee everything.Can we look at the next one?Janet asked, opening the album to another page.Troy smiled to himself and moved away.An hour later the couple was leaving with a contract in their hands and an official estimate on the way via email.And they were kissing.Grace turned the sign on the front door and locked it.She was closed.Her meeting with the bridal couple had lasted almost two hours.I dont know how you did that, Troy said, stacking up his papers.I was taught, she said.The couple I worked forthey were so perfect at pleasing people.When I first met Jake and Janet I thought they were headed for divorce.When they left, I thought everything would be fine.This is so typical.They think they have a budget, but what they really have done is run out of money after the dress and reception and pictures, but they still want flowers.For fifty bucks, Troy said with a laugh.
