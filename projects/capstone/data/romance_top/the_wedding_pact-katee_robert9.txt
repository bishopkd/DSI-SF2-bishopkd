The thought of spending the night locked away in her room had panic fluttering in her throat.She was already locked up in every way that counted.She couldnt be locked in physically, too.She frowned at her older sister.Whats wrong?She hadnt come home from some nameless club like Sloan had originally suspected.Not wearing that green dress that Carrigan would consider respectable, and certainly not with her makeup done up for the day, rather than nighttime.It was more than that, though.Usually when she rolled home in the small hours of the night, she had an expression like a cat whod stolen the cream.Not tonight.Tonight her eyes were shining, and there were little tremors working their way through her sisters body that she could see from several feet away.Carrigan?I She wrapped her arms around herself, the shaking getting worse.If there was one thing Sloan recognized, it was a person on the verge of a complete breakdown.Shed danced along that edge herself too many times to miss the signs.She slipped an arm around her sisters waist and guided her to her room, carefully shutting the door behind them.Its going to be okay.Its not okay.The shining in her eyes overflowed, a tear slipping free.Nothings ever going to be okay again.She froze.Carrigan was crying?She could count how many times shed seen her older sister cry on one hand and still have all five fingers left over.What in Gods name is going on?We can talk about it.Im marrying Dmitri Romanov.More tears fell, as if that first one had broken a dam and now they all rushed to fill the new space.She stared into the distance, seeing something that wasnt in this room.I have to.I dont have a choice.Carrigan There was nothing she could do.She couldnt tell her sister that she had a choiceshe didnt.Their father wouldnt think twice about dragging her bodily down the aisle himself if she tried to protest.She could run, but he would find her.He had all the resources that came with more money that most people could dream of.If Carrigan left the fold, all of that would become focused on finding her and bringing her back.Since she couldnt speak the lies that would comfort her sister, Sloan wrapped her arms around her sister.Im sorry.I love him, you know.Another sob, so harsh she thought she misheard until Carrigan said it again.I love James Halloran.Shock almost had her dropping her arms.James Halloran?Shed suspected her sister was seeing someone, but he was the last person she would have guessed.Sloan pressed her lips together to keep the accusations inside.How could you?His family is responsible for Devlin!He might as well have pulled the trigger himself!He kidnapped you!All things her sister already knew.And she obviously needed comfort right now more than she needed to be yelled at.So Sloan rubbed soothing circles on her back and let her sister cry herself out.It took time, the minutes ticking by until the sky beyond Carrigans bedroom window began to lighten.But she finally lifted her head and wiped at her face.Im fine.Im okay.No, she wasnt.But Sloan wasnt about to point it out.Instead she took her sisters hands.I know you care for She almost choked on the name.James, but you have to marry Dmitri.You know that, dont you?To do anything else courted their fathers rageand he wouldnt be alone.The entire family would unite to make sure Carrigan and James never had a chance to be together.The wounds of the summer were too raw and, even if they werent, some things were unforgivable.Devlin bleeding out in the street with a Halloran bullet inside him was one of them.Her sister exhaled, her shoulder bowing down.I know.James isnt for me.Im marrying Dmitri.Its the only option.She sounded like shed just delivered a death sentence to herself.Twenty Two Carrigan woke up the next morning feeling like shed been run over by a truck.Her life hadnt been picture perfect to begin with, but itd sure as hell gone downhill faster than she could have imagined.She touched her face, still feeling puffy and raw from her crying jag last night.She hadnt meant to break down, let alone in front of Sloan, but once shed started, she hadnt been able to stop.Shed seen the look on her sisters face, though, when shed finally gotten control of herself.Sloan sided with Aiden and Cillian.She thought Carrigan was a monster for sleeping with James, let alone being stupid enough to fall for him.I told her I love him.She shouldnt have let the damning words past her lips, but if there was one person who wouldnt pass it on, it was Sloan.Carrigan rolled over and stared at her ceiling.The temptation to pull the covers over her head and sleep the day away was almost too much to pass up.But then shed have to admit to hiding in her room to avoid seeing her brother or father or any other member of her family whod get in her face and call her a traitor at the first available opportunity.Which would mean she was afraid.No help for it.She had to get out of bed.She padded to her bathroom and took a leisurely shower, telling herself all the while that she wasnt actually stalling.After styling her hair and putting on her war paint, there was nothing left to do but go downstairs and face the firing squad.Could I be any more melodramatic?Probably.Anything to keep from thinking about last night.James told her he loved her.He really loves me.She stared at her reflection, the image blurring to replace the tortured look on his face when hed confessed what his father had done to him.Abuse was too kind a termand death was too kind a penalty for it.She clenched her hands, her nails digging into her palms as fury washed over her in waves.Shed already believed Victor Halloran deserved to die after this summer.Knowing what she did now?She hoped that he suffered horribly before he went.If there was any way she could arrange for that to happen, she wouldnt hesitate to do it.James couldnt be her priority anymoreat least not as far as anyone else was concerned.She had to put on an obedient expression and jump through all the hoops set out before her to keep him safe.That was the only thing that mattered.As much as shed wanted to take him up on the offer blazing from his eyes last night and say that their enemies could go fuck themselves, she knew the truth.They might have a few days, maybe even a few months, but the debt would come due at some point and then James would die.Shed be lucky if she went with him, but Carrigan didnt like her chances.Either way, it was a lose lose scenario.The only way she was going to get through the next however many years of her life and marriage to Dmitri was knowing that James still walked this earth.Shed suffer untold horrors to make sure that happened.Taking a fortifying breath, she walked out of her room and down the main staircase.The house was oddly hushed, making the hair on the back of her neck stand on end.She caught sight of Aiden coming out of the library.I did what you wanted.He didnt look up from the papers in his hands.It has nothing to do with what I want and everything to do with whats necessary.Necessary.She hated that word.It ranked right up there with loyalty and obedience and family.Whatever.Dmitri agreed.She just had to hope that her last desperate night of freedom wasnt enough to drive him over the edge.She never should have taken that chance, but it was too late to worry about it now.Really, she didnt want to take back those hours with James, talking with him, losing herself at the feel of what he was doing to her.She just wished she could have fallen asleep listening to the steady sound of his breathing.Let it go.It will never happen again.You cant let it.She wouldnt.Shed had a moment of weakness, but it was enough to shore her up for the foreseeable future.It had to be.She fell into step with Aiden down the hall, her stomach rumbling.Shed barely let the idea of breakfast cross her mind, when the door to her fathers study slammed open.He marched into the hallway and glared at her.You.Aiden tensed next to her.Father Not now.You dont know what your sister has done.His gaze flicked over her brother.Unless you already do know, in which case well be having a discussion about loyalty in the near future.He pointed at Carrigan.In my office.Now.She followed him because there was no other option, and nearly tripped over her feet when she saw who occupied one of the chairs in front of the desk.Dmitri.What are you doing here?Protecting my investment.His face gave nothing away.No anger.No worry.Nothing.Sit down.She sank into the open seat, her heart in her throat.There was only one thing that could bring Dmitri here and put that look on her fathers face.He knows.Father I highly suggest you keep your damn mouth shut before you do more damage.He straightened already perfectly straight papers.Did you or did you not spend the night with Halloran?They did know.She swallowed hard.I can explain.I dont need your explanation.Answer the question.She dropped her gaze.Yes, I did.The study was so silent, her fathers sigh sounded like a bellow.In that case, I would like to formally apologize, Dmitri.I had no idea the trouble she was getting into.I completely understand if youre no longer interested in the marriage pact on the table, but Id hope that this wont color our dealings going forward.He paused.Though I do have two more daughters.Sloan or Keira married to this shark?Never.Carrigan raised her head.Thats not necessary.What did I say?He was so furious that she actually feared he might strike her this time.Its perfectly all right, Seamus, Dmitri cut in smoothly.I fully intend to marry Carrigan, and the nights events havent changed those plans.She didnt know whether to be relieved or terrified.Carrigan sat perfectly still, a small, fuzzy animal sensing a predator, knowing an attack was coming but not being able to see what direction itd be from.She kept silent because what she thought didnt matter to either man in the room.Her father raised his eyebrows.If youre sure.I am.I find myself quite enamored with your oldest daughter.So much so, Id like to take her back to New York for the time being until we can finalize wedding arrangements with your wife.Im sure shed like the opportunity to plan it at her leisure instead of with a time constraint like the most recent one.Panic had black spots dancing across her vision.Leave Boston?Now?Shed thought shed have more time.Father, please.He ignored her.That would suit perfectly.Carrigan has proven herself a poor judge of character, and removing her from further temptations is wise.Like she was a naughty child being sent to timeout.Or, worse, an invalid incapable of thinking for herself.She opened her mouth but couldnt make words come out.The feeling of her life spinning out of control around her only got worse as Dmitri stood and shook her fathers hand as if conducting a business deal.Which is exactly what he was doing.He turned.Its time, Carrigan.It took her entirely too long to understand what the hell he meant.You want me to come with you now?She shot a panicked look at her father, but he was no help.But I need to say good bye to Sloan and Keira and Thats what a phone is for.Her fathers expression didnt so much as twitch.If youre going to be difficult, Ill have Mark come in here and carry you out over his shoulder.Why dont you save us all the indignity of throwing a tantrum and act like an adult?Hed just sold her to further his business arrangements, and he wanted her to act like an adult.Only the knowledge that hed follow through on his threat without batting an eye had her finding her spine and shooting to her feet.Then, by all means, lets not make a scene.Neither man flinched at the venom in her voice.Wonderful.She ignored Dmitris offered elbow and strode out of the room, nearly hitting Aiden with the door as she came out.I hope youre happy, big brother.His green eyes went wide before he schooled his expression.Whats going on?Fathers handed me off to Dmitri.So I wont be your problem anymore.She ignored the way he flinched and strode for the front door.She wasnt surprised when Dmitri met her stride for stride without seeming to hurry.She glared.I expect you to send men over to collect my things before you cart me off to New York.Ill see it done.He was sounflappable.Stone cold.It made her want to poke at him, but instinct said hed respond in a way she wouldnt like, so she didnt.Instead, she followed him out to his car and into the backseat.He closed the door, sealing her into the silence of the limo.She started to shake and wrapped her arms around herself to cover up the involuntary movements.Oh God, what am I going to do?*** James couldnt shake the nasty mood that made him want to punch something.It was a bad place to be in because he had important shit going on tonight.Meeting the flesh traders without his head on straight was just asking for trouble.He met Michael in the kitchen.The man leaned against the counter, hunched over a cup of what smelled like coffee.Morning, boss.Everything a go for tonight?As good as it gets.I have men posted at the transfer spot making sure we dont have any surprises when the time comes.Smart.He poured himself a cup of coffee.I get through tonight with money in my pocket and without getting shot, and youre getting a bonus.Michael gave a toothy grin.Just what I live for.He slurped his coffee.Im going to check on the boys.Unless you need something else?Go.He waved the man away.There was nothing to say to Michael that he didnt already know.A good leader delegated when possible, and his second in command had proven he was capable of handling whatever shit arose.Michael had barely been gone thirty seconds when Ricky sauntered through the door.Hey, James.He set the mug down.Ricky.Itd only been a few days since he let his little brother out of the basement, but there had been no incidents.It was almost too much to hope that that would continue for the next few days until he left for California.He wasnt about to let his guard downRicky was rarely up before noon, let alone at this early hour.He wanted something.What can I do you for?The deal you have going on tonight.I want in.He held up his hands, not that James was rushing to jump in and fill the silence.Just hear me out.I brokered this deal, and I busted my ass to get the contacts in place so that these two would trust us enough to bring the shipment in.I deserve to be there.Considering he didnt trust his brother with the women at Tit for Tat who voluntarily worked the darker aspects of their trade, he sure as fuck wasnt going to trust him with a container full of terrified refugees in God only knew what state.That being said, it wasnt like he was going to send Ricky off without someone to watch his backand make sure he didnt do anything shady.James would be there to ensure things stayed on target, and he wouldnt look the other way if his brother tried something.Maybe this would be the thing that would get them started on a better path.Or maybe Ricky was just waiting for him to lower his guard so he could slit Jamess throat.He took another drink of coffee, watching his brother over the rim of his mug.If I say yesifthen you follow orders.I dont care if I tell you to strip down buck ass naked and run through the street, you do it with no questions asked.Understand?Ricky gave a sharp nod.I get it.You say jump and I ask how high.So I can I go or not?Fuck, he just wanted to punch the shit out of his brother.The feeling used to be the exception to the rule.Now it was all he ever felt.Whatever friendship theyd had had died with Brendan.Maybe it had never existed in the first place.Yeah.Talk to Michael about where he wants you.James would be talking to Michael, too.He didnt intend on letting his baby brother out of his sight tonight.Will do.Ricky hurried out of the kitchen like he was afraid James was about to change his mind.Good riddance.He checked the time.Ten hours until the meeting.Too long.He wanted to keep in motion, to keep from thinking about the reality lurking in the back of his mind.Carrigan was gone, and he still didnt have fuck all for a plan of getting her back.He made his way to the gym and spent the next hour working his body to the breaking point.It didnt matter how many reps he did, he couldnt escape the way his chest hurt with every breath.He felt like the walking wounded, still going through the motions despite missing vital parts of his body.He dropped the dumbbells with a curse.This wasnt working, and every minute that passed pushed him closer to doing something stupid like driving over to the OMalley house and demanding to see her.It wasnt what a good leader would do.Hed be putting everything hed busted his ass for in jeopardy for a woman.Not just any woman.It didnt matter.She was one person.He couldnt endanger everyone under his command for a single personnot even when his own happiness was on the line.Theres a way around it.There has to be.He just had to find it.A shitty plan formed in his mind, but a shitty plan was better than no plan.He put the weight room back into order and then went up to his room to shower and change.Twenty minutes later he was in the Chevelle and dialing his phone.Teague answered almost immediately.I didnt expect to hear from you again.Not outside of formal negotiations.James drummed his fingers on the wheel.Im not going to make excuses for what happened before.I should have done something differentlysomething more.Theyd seen each other since the night Callista was captive and escaped with Carrigan in tow from his family home, but he and Teague hadnt really talked.He got it that the man hated him.Hed hate anyone who willingly put Carrigan in danger, too.He shook his head.I fucked up.And Im sorry for that.You did.He sighed.But there were more than a few fuckups to go around.You could have stopped Callies escape before it even started and you didnt.That means something.All hed done was step aside.It had felt like a risk then, but looking back it was nowhere near enough.He should have escorted them out.If I could go back I know.Me, too.We cant go back.We can only go forward.Teague paused, the sound of a womans voice in the background.But you didnt call today to apologize and shoot the shit.No, I didnt.Now that he was on the line, though, he wasnt sure what to say.Teague might not hate him, but he was a long way off giving his blessing for James to steal Carrigan away.He probably wouldnt respond as violently as his other brothers, but no way would he think James was good enough for her.Hell, he was right.But there was no one else to turn to.He had to man up and broach the subject, and hope that Teague hated the idea of his older sister married to some Russian from New York as much as James did.You know your old mans making Carrigan marry some stranger.Im aware.And pissed as hell if his tone was anything to go by.It was now or never.Im not going to let that happen.The silence stretched into one minute, and then two.Finally Teague said, far too calmly, I might have lost my fucking mind, but you seem to be insinuating that you and my sister have something going on.Oh yeah.Teague was pissed as hell.James scrubbed a hand over his face.Its not what you think.Talk fast, Jamestalk really fucking fast.He weighed his words.They had to be the right ones.If Teague wasnt in his corner, then he was in this shit alone.But, really, there was only the truth.James had never been all that good at pandering, and he wasnt about to start now.I love her.It didnt start out that way, but sometimes you have to take these things as they come.Ive never met a woman like her, and I could go the rest of my life and that would still be true.His breath caught, and he didnt bother to hide the feeling that welled up.Shes everything, Teague.You get what Im saying?More silence.He let it go, knowing that he couldnt rush the man when it came to this shit.Finally Teague cursed.Goddamn it, you dont ever take the easy road, do you?You know me better than that.Yeah, I do.Another pause.And Carrigan?Whats she got to say about all this?She left me.He clenched his teeth together.Shes doing whatever it takes to keep everyone around her safe, even if that means walking away from me.Well, hell.Teague cursed again.Ill help if I can, but you know as well as I do that my father isnt a man to cross.Are you prepared for the consequences?War.The very thing theyd all busted their asses to avoid over the summer, and now he was considering running headlong into it.This was different, though.Carrigan was worth it and more.Yeah, Im prepared.Then sit tight and dont do anything stupid.Ill see what I can find out and get back to you.He started the Chevelle.Teague?Yeah?Thanks.He hesitated.If you want to go get a beer when this is all over, first rounds on me.Id like that.Now stay the fuck out of trouble until I call you.Easier said than done.He wasnt the type of man to be comfortable sitting on his hands, but at least he had other shit to occupy him.James glanced at the clock.A few short hours until it was time for the meet up.He checked on Michael, but it looked like so far so good.He was too fucking realistic to hope that the rest of the day would go down without a hitch.Twenty Three Dmitris man drove them down to the Mandarin Oriental, and he didnt say a word the entire drive.Not that Carrigan expected him to.What did he have to say?Hed won.Hed gotten everything hed wanted, and hed put her father in a position of being grateful to him.It really was brilliant.Not that she was ever going to say so.She climbed out of the backseat before the man had a chance to open the door, and looked around the parking garage.How long will we be here?Tonight.I have some remaining business to take care of in Boston before we return to New York.Dmitri offered his elbow, and she forced herself to take it.She might resent the hell out of him, but she knew when to hedge her bets.She was marrying him, whether she liked it or not.Getting them started on the right footas much as possiblemight mean more freedom for her down the road.I hate this.I hate that I cant choose a man for myself.I hate everything.Her fingers itched for her phone, and the thing she wanted most in the world was to hear Jamess raspy voice over the line telling her that it was okay and hed be at her side in no time.It would never happen again.God, that hurt.Dmitri led them up through a set of elevators to one of the absurdly large suites.Everything about it was opulent and expensive, all with a vaguely Asian theme that didnt quite commit to any specific culture.She made a beeline for the kitchen, finding a bottle of vodka stashed in one of the cabinets.Why wasnt she surprised?She poured a healthy splash into a tumbler and then poured some more.Alcohol wouldnt do anything to change her circumstances, but itd numb her to some of the sharper aspects of it for tonight, at least.If that was the best she could do, then she was going to happily do it.If I hadnt gone and fallen for James, would I be so upset about marrying Dmitri?She didnt know.That was part of the problem.Shed never been on board with this whole marrying a stranger plan, but at least she understood the Russian.He was a cold bastard, but she could be cold, too.Or so shed thought.She glanced up as the glass touched her lips to find Dmitri watching her.What?Nothing at all.Help yourself.It irked her that he had her over a barrel in every way that counted, and all the while hed never once lost his polish and poise during the whole process.My fault.Knowing that didnt help her mood a damn bit, but there it was.Shed made her bed and now it was time to lie in it.It didnt matter if shed been forced into a corner by circumstances beyond her control.She tightened her grip on the glass, trying to remind herself why this was all necessary.To keep James safe.Shed screwed up last night and let her heart get the better of her head.Dmitri didnt seem like the kind of man to be forgiving, but if he was going to make an exception this time, she had to do whatever it took to make sure that happened.No matter how much she hated the thought of playing subservient wifey to him.He motioned around the room.Feel free to make yourself at home.I have a few business calls to make.Afterward, well order a meal and have a conversation.Peachy.She forced a tight smile.I look forward to it.How much vodka could she drink before he got done with his calls?Enough to muffle the soul searing pain demanding she go running back into Jamess arms?Somehow, she doubted it.There wasnt enough alcohol in the world.But that wouldnt stop her from trying.Is he going to expect me in his bed tonight?She couldnt play the blushing virgin wanting to wait for her wedding night.Hed already more than proven that hed done his research when it came to hernot to mention that shed put this entire thing in jeopardy for one more time with James.I didnt even get to say good bye.She took another healthy gulp of the vodka.Dmitri wasnt ugly or gross, but the mere thought of his hands on her body made her stomach lurch.I dont know if I can do this.If she hadnt had a taste of how good things could be with James, shed probably be able to fake it with Dmitri.Or, more likely, she wouldnt have had to fake it at all.He seemed like the kind of man who knew his way around a womans body.Before shed experienced how good it could be when her heart was involved, that would have been enough for her.She wasnt sure it still was.Perfect.Dmitri pulled his phone out of his pocket.My men wont come into the room, but they are stationed at the doors.I dont have to tell you not to do something ill advised.It wasnt a question, so she didnt deign to answer it.His threat to James kept her in place, and he damn well knew it.Dont worry about me.The most damage Ill do while youre busy is to your vodka.Maybe a little distance from him would let her get her game face back into place.She was in the middle of a death spiral, and that was unacceptable.This was a man who would capitalize on any weakness, and shed more than given him enough ammunition in the last hour.It was time to get back onto the playing field.Carrigan braced herself, smiled, and touched his arm, letting her hand linger there even though she was dangerously close to having the vodka shed drank make a reappearance.I want to thank you.Oh?You didnt have to show mercy.She made herself move closer.Im very, very grateful that you did.His expression didnt so much as twitch.Good.He turned and walked away, cutting an imposing figure in his perfectly fitted suit.Though he hadnt technically agreed to anything, he was a smart man, and a smart man would know it was more important to secure her obedience and loyalty early on, rather than exact petty revenge to assuage his pride.She hoped.She downed another gulp of the vodka, relishing the burn because of the future oblivion it promised.She looked around the room, taking in the understated elegance.Sitting here in the kitchen like a lush, just waiting for Dmitri to wander back in and pay attention to herNo, thanks.After topping off her vodka, she wandered around the living room.Everything was top of the line and completely soulless.She would have traded it in a hot second for the faded, lived in feel of Jamess beach place.She rubbed her chest.How was it possible to miss someone so much when shed been with them a day before?Carrigan sipped her vodka, going slower now that shed started to feel its effects.Getting drunk was a dumb decision.The last thing she needed was to break down in front of Dmitri in an alcohol infused sob session.He already had too much power over her.She refused to hand him any more weapons.Needing to combat the fuzziness threatening, she crossed the living room and muscled open one of the large windows overlooking Back Bay.Instantly, she got a face full of icy wind.She closed her eyes and tilted her head back, letting the cold sink into her, driving away her buzz.Better.Much better.She wouldnt be able to stand here too long, but it was exactly what shed needed.I need a plan in place to deal with him.Ive spent too much time letting my emotions get the better of me and giving the advantage to everyone else.It ends now.It didnt take long for shivers to start racking her body, but she wrapped her arms around herself, not willing to close the window just yet.Yes, yes, I know.Carrigan frowned.What the hell?She angled to look out the window, trying to figure out what she was hearing.It didnt take long to recognize Dmitris voice.Apparently the window in the master bedroom was cracked open as well.There was no reason his business calls should interest her, but she needed every piece of information she could get when it came to this man.One never knew when the opportunity would arise where it could be used for leverage.She stepped out of her heels, picked them up, and padded closer to the window.His voice was partially muffled, growing louder and quieter.He must be pacing.She didnt dare peek to confirm.Inside, he kept speaking.Are you threatening me?He muttered something in what sounded like Russian.Listen to me, you little dermo.You agreed to this and you took your payment.That means I own you.Though Im starting to think I overpaid.She grinned despite the cold sinking into her bones.Apparently the perfectly temperate Dmitri could get frazzled.No, things havent changed.If anything, its even more vital now to follow through on this.A pause, and then his voice dropped until she had to strain to make out the words.Dont misunderstand me, Michael.If James Halloran doesnt die tonight, you will go in his place, and I will take personal satisfaction in drawing out your last breaths until youre begging for the mercy of the afterlife.Carrigan clamped her hand over her mouth to stifle her gasp.That murdering backstabbing bastard.She reached blindly for the wall, the world turning slow circles around her.All shed done, all shed sacrificed, and James was still in Dmitris crosshairs.From the sound it of, he had been even before she agreed to marry the Russian.He kept speaking, oblivious to her world falling apart around her.And that is if Ricky doesnt get to you first.You know what happens if you fail me.Dont.She held her breath as he paced and muttered in Russian.Surely he had more phone calls to make?She tensed, ready to slam the window shut to prevent him from realizing she knew.But then his voice rose to normal speaking levels.Another phone call.She listened for a few moments more, long enough to realize she wouldnt be able to glean any information from this particular call since he wasnt speaking English.It didnt matter.She knew enough to know she couldnt stay here another minute longer.Carrigan padded back inside and slipped on her shoes.They werent ideal for escaping guards and fleeing into the night, but shed run in higher.She eyed the door to the master bedroom, half expecting Dmitri to rush out and demand to know what she thought she was doing.He didnt, and the longer she waited, the greater her chances of discovery were.How the hell was she going to get out of here?This wasnt like the Halloran house, where she could slip out a window and onto the roof and then drop to the ground safely from there.They were at least twelve stories up.The only person who jumped from this balcony would be someone courting death.She grabbed her purse, digging through it for the one thing that could tip the situation temporarily in her favorthe Taser.For the first time since Aiden had given it to her, she wished it were a goddamn gun.The men outside that door werent good men, and while a Taser might put them on the floor temporarily, theyd be up and after her before too much time had passed.Ill just have to be quicker than they are.Or smarter.Or something.Before she opened the door, she ran her hands through her hair, mussing it, and then smeared her lipstick a little.She held the Taser in one hand, tucked behind her purse, and opened the door.Help!There were two guards.One was less than a foot from the door and the other several steps beyond him.Too far.This had to be quick, before they realized what was happening, or itd be over before it began.She put some stumble into her step, and lowered her voice to little more than a whisper.Help.The guards exchanged a look.The closest one frowned.Where is Mr.Romanov?Hes She ducked her head, watching them through the shield of her hair.Hes They moved closer, trying to hear her.When they were an arms distance from her, she raised her voice a little.On the phone.She tased the furthest one, holding down the trigger to keep shocking him even after his body hit the ground.She hit the other guards body as he drew his gun, her purse flying from her hand as they slammed into the wall.He dropped his gun, and she dove for it, rolling and coming up to fire wildly.The shot took him in the shoulder, knocking him onto his back, and she wasted no time scrambling to her feet.Then she ran for the elevator, their groans ringing in her ear.It wouldnt take long for the tased one to recoverless than a minute if Aiden was rightand that hadnt been a killing shot to the other one by any means.She had to be out of here now.The damn elevator would take too long, so she shoved through the doors to the stairs.Her bare feet slapped the cold concrete and she almost went down before she realized that was exactly where theyd expect her to go.Carrigan ran up the stairs; all the while a small voice in the back of her mind pointed out that she was violating the cardinal rule of horror moviesnever run up.She made herself slow down as she reached the door two floors up.Her stomach hurt and her breath was coming too fast, but she pressed herself against the wall when she heard the door open below her.Dmitris men shouldnt be able to see her from their angle, but she couldnt take any chances.She was trapped up here.Idiot.They conversed softly in Russian and then the sound of a door opening whispered through the quiet while a second set of feet started down.Carrigan waited ten seconds, and then thirty, and then a full sixty.Only then did she slip through the door into the hallway behind her and press the elevator button.She almost cried out when the elevator door opened and it was empty.The ride down to the second floor seemed to take forever, but in reality it was less than a minute.She looked both ways as she stepped into the hallway.As tempting as going down to the lobby and running out the front doors was, by now the men had contacted Dmitri, who might have contacted whoever he had guarding the entrance.Shed be better suited to take a less obvious path.She wound through the hallways toward the back of the hotel.At this time of night, the place was mostly deserted, and she kept glancing over her shoulder, expecting to be found out at any second.A quick trip down the corner stairs to the back door found her at a carefully cultivated courtyard, complete with trees, grass, and walking paths.She put her shoes back on and hurried through it to Ring Road and headed south, away from the bay.It felt unnatural to keep her head down and her stride even, but if Dmitris men got this far, theyd be looking for a woman in a black dress running from them.She wasnt about to make finding her that easy.She eyed the people around her as she turned the corner on Huntington, this time heading northeast.People were suspicious these days, but she looked like a hot mess, so surely some well meaning Good Samaritan would help her.She just had to pick the right mark.A block later, her gaze fell on an older guy trying to flag down a cab with his wife.Perfect.She stopped a foot away from them and made her voice as pathetic as possible.Excuse me?Sir?Maam?The man turned, a frown on his face, but it melted away when his wife put her hand on his arm.What?Do you have a phone I could use?It wasnt hard to dredge up some tears, though they didnt fall.My boyfriend and I had a fight and he took his car and abandoned me down here.I Her voice caught.I need help.Of course, honey.The wife grabbed the phone from her husbands hand and passed it over.Carrigan stared at it for half a second.She wanted to call James, to hear his voice and know that he was okay, and warn him of the danger.But she didnt know his damn numbershed just put it in her phone and used his contact every time shed called him.Lazy.Really, there was only one number she had memorized.She dialed, and then held her breath while it rang.She almost cried all over again when her brother answered.Teague OMalley.Teague, its me.Instantly his voice lost its cold, professional tone.Whats going on?Why are you calling me from a strange number?Im in trouble.Conscious of the couples gaze on her, she kept it as brief as possible.Im down on Huntington and Dartmouth.Can you pick me up?As soon as the words left her mouth, she wondered if shed made a mistake.By now, Teague had to be aware of both her pending marriage to Dmitri and the fact that pretty much their entire family saw her as a traitor for falling for James.What if he?Go to the Copley Square Hotel and wait in the lobby.Ill be there in twenty.Okay.She hung up and handed the phone back to the wife.Thank you.I never should have doubted Teague.He didnt let family get in the way of offering me a way out before.Obviously that hasnt changed.It was no problem.The woman watched her with concern written across her face.Do you want us to wait with you?From the disgusted look her husband sent her, he wasnt happy with the idea.No, but thank you for offering.My brother will be here in a few minutes.Good, good.She put her hand on Carrigans arm.Get rid of that good for nothing man of yours.She managed a smile.Oh, I plan on it.*** Jamesons was nearly empty, and Cillian was doing his damnedest not to stare at the new bartender.She wore a pair of jeans that were holey enough to be considered indecent, layered over fishnets, with a black tank top.The combination would have been sexy as hell under normal circumstances, but the glimpses of those fishnets killed him.He drank his apple juice, knowing damn well that he was focusing on this womanOliviabecause he didnt want to deal with the shit storm waiting for him back home.Hed gotten a text from Aiden this morning telling him that Carrigan had basically been handed off to Dmitri Romanovwho was, as far as he could tell, the same Dmitri who had chatted him a little over two week ago.He knew he hadnt given the bastard anything then, knew that it was ultimately his father who made the decision that treated his sister like a piece of furniture, knew that there wasnt a damn thing he could have done to stop it.It didnt matter.Hate the man or not, hed seen James Hallorans face when Aiden shook Carrigan.The guy loved her, or cared about her so much it was the same damn thing.If Aiden had shaken her again, James would have thrown out their tentative peace without a second thought.That, more than anything else, had stayed with Cillian over the last few days.No one in their family put personal health and happiness above the needs of the OMalleys as a whole.It just wasnt how shit went down.Up until Teagues wedding, he would have said the Hallorans were the same wayworse, really.And hed have been wrong.There isnt a damn thing I can do to help her.Just like I couldnt help Devlin.You keep looking at the drink like that, its going to curdle.He glanced up to find Olivia standing on the other side of the bar, and hell if she wasnt even more striking up close.Her dark eyes were damn near black and held secrets he could only guess at.What was this womans story?Benji usually hired guys because apparently hed had enough bad past experiences with female bartenders to make him gun shy.This woman had to be something special for the big man to have made an exception.Maybe I like my drinks curdled.Sure you do.Her mouth tightened.You know, I might not be the most charming guy around, but Ive never had a woman decide she despises me at first sight like you apparently have.And if he was going to be coming in here like he normally did, being hated by a bartender that Benji obviously adored was going to be seriously uncomfortable.He put his best smile on.If you let me know what I did to piss you off, Ill do what I can to avoid it in the future.If anything, her expression only got more annoyed.Youre right.Youre not charming.He sat back.That wasnt an answer.Maybe I just dont like the look of you.She waved a hand to encompass all of him.With your fancy haircut, expensive suit, and Im a bad boy tattoos.Youre the kind of man who thinks he owns the world.Cillian snorted.Hardly.I know your type.She shrugged.It doesnt matter if you agree with me or not.If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, its most likely a duck.And Id bet my last dollar that youre a duck.His phone rang, saving him from coming up with a response to her absurd assumption.Or is it really that absurd?Youre trouble and you know it.If shes smart enough to recognize it on sight and avoid it, who the fuck are you to blame her for it?He pulled out his phone and frowned when he saw Teagues number.Hey.Where are you?Beacon Hill.He wasnt about to tell Teague he was in the same bar theyd been in the night Devlin died.He wouldnt understand.Worse, maybe he actually would.Carrigans in trouble.He bit back the instinctive response to throw her whatever the fuck it was with James Halloran in his brothers face.Hadnt Cillian just been thinking that she didnt deserve to be passed off to the Russian when it seemed like Halloran really had feelings for her?What kind of trouble?The kind where shes in over her head enough to call for help.Considering their sister had never hesitated to take care of her own problems, that meant something bad.He straightened.He might not like the idea of her with Halloran, but she was still his big sister.There was no going back in time and saving Devlin, but if he could help Carrigan, then maybe that would do something to start to balance his karmic debt.When and where do you need me?My apartment, and as soon as you can get there.He was already reaching into his pocket for his cash.Consider it done.He hung up to find the pretty bartender watching him, a frown on her face.Careful there, you frown like that often enough and your face is going to stick in that expression.He tossed the money on the bar and walked away, the sound of her sputtering behind him making him smile despite the clusterfuck he was most likely walking into.When life was going to hell around him, sometimes it was all about finding pleasure in the small things.*** Tell me again.Carrigan bit back her impatience.I already told you twice.Dmitri is planning on killing James.You have to call him and warn him.Teague ran his hands through his hair.I did.Five times.Hes not answering.She knew that.God, of course she knew that.It didnt stop the panic from hurtling through her, growing stronger with each minute that passed.Where was James now?
