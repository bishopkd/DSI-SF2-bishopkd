He turned on two lamps near the bed, bathing the room in a warm glow.She took the opportunity to look around.There were more paintings on the wallsa large one of the turbulent ocean, a dark storm rolling in.Staring at it, Carrigan could almost taste the sea air and feel the wind on her face.His mother had been gifted.The other painting was of a lighthouse standing guard on a rocky coast.It made her think of James, standing alone against the world.You like them?Theyre beautiful.It was enough to make her want to wander this house and see what other treasures shed find.She turned and found James inches away, his blue eyes roaming over her hungrily.Another time.Her body flashed hot at the memory of what hed done the last time they were alone.Touch me.Lovely, it would be my fucking pleasure.But he didnt immediately reach for her.Instead, he circled her once and then stopped behind her.She tensed at the feel of his hands on the bare skin at the nape of her neck, but the tension fled as his thumbs dug into the tight muscles there.She bit her lip to keep from moaning.I thought so.He stopped massaging her long enough to unzip the back of her dress and let it fall to the floor.Her bra quickly joined it, leaving her in only a pair of panties.On the bedfacedown.Her body obeyed before her mind had a chance to catch up, but what was there to protest?He made her feel good time and time again.Tonight would be no different.Carrigan climbed onto the bed and settled facedown.The comforter was faded from countless washings and smelled faintly of lilacs.She turned her head and watched James strip, his gaze never leaving her body.He shrugged out of the leather jacket and tossed it onto the chair by the bed.Next came his T shirt, shoes, and jeans.Each move was methodical and preciseand all the more erotic for it.The only thing he left on was a pair of boxer briefs.His body was roped with muscle from long hours in the gym, but hed stopped just short of it being overwhelming.She frowned when he moved closer.There were scars on his chest.And not just a few.Nearly every inch of skin was covered with them.Shed felt the irregularities the last time they had sex, but shed been too distracted to think about why his skin felt that way.Those werent fighting scars, either.They were too perfectly spaced.James Ive bared all the soul Im going to tonight, lovely.He climbed onto the bed and moved to straddle her hips.She started to turn over, but his hands on her shoulders stopped her.Just relax.You need this as much as I do.The scent of lotion reached her, and then his hands were back on her skin, digging in and working out all the tightness in her muscles.This time she couldnt fight back a moan.Shed known the man had magic hands, but apparently they extended beyond sex.He moved slowly over her, spending precious attention on every inch of her.By the time he reached the small of her back, she was boneless and would have agreed to damn near anything hed asked of her.James moved to the side.Over.She obeyed, rolling onto her back, and he started the process againthis time beginning at her feet and working upward.If his work on her back had left her languid and relaxed, this was entirely different.Her nerves sang to life as he moved up her calf and over her thigh.She dug her hands into the comforter.All the feel good sensation hed created shifted, centering between her legs.He stopped a bare inch away from where she needed him.Not yet.Carrigan lifted her head to glare.Im ready.I never leave a job half finished.He moved to her other side and dug his thumbs into the sensitive arch of her foot.Against her wishes, her eyes drifted shut and she moaned again.He cursed, and his grip tightened for a single second before he moved to her calf.If she thought his desire would make him rush through this, she was sorely mistaken.He was slow and methodical and, by the time hed reached her upper thigh, she was damn near panting for him.James, please.You dont sound relaxed.His wicked grin only stoked her need higher.He used a finger to trace the seam of her panties, dragging over the scalloped lace edge.Still not where she wanted his touch most.She lifted her hips, trying to guide him, but he used his free hand to pin her to the bed.Youre wet for me, lovely, aching for what only I can give you.His thumb stopped directly over her clit.With a little pressure and movement, he could send her hurtling over the edge, but he didnt give her either.Its a damn shame youre going to be needing me for a little bit longer.Whatgoddamn it.He moved before she could, straddling her hips, easily holding her in place when she tried to sit up.James started those maddening circles on her shoulders.Be good and relax, and Ill take care of you, lovely.Thats a goddamn promise.She didnt want to relax.She wanted his hands and mouth on her, his cock filling her until she was lost in a sea of sensation thatdamn himonly he seemed able to give her.Carrigan had had good sex before.Shed even had great sex.But what she shared with James was on a completely different level.He didnt let her run thingseven when she was on top, there was no doubt that he was in control.And hell if that didnt turn her on more than she could have thought possible.She wasnt winning thisnot with a head on confrontation.So she lay back and stretched her arms over her head, the move designed to draw his eyes to her breasts.Fine.Im relaxed.Hardly.He palmed her breasts, his rough hands heaven against her skin.Tell me about this tattoo.I think its self explanatory.He traced the words as he read aloud.I became insane, with long periods of horrible sanity.They were just words but she felt stripped bare beneath his gaze.He frowned.Ive heard that quote before.Poe.Ah, yeah.I remember now.His thumb moved over the words again, his frown deepening.Explain.Youre seriously bossy.You like it.He cupped her breasts again, kneading gently.And youre stalling.Im surprised.You dont strike me as a Poe fan.She closed her eyes because it was easier to focus on what he was doing to her body, completely at odds with how closely he watched her face.What was this man doing to her?She licked her lips.I was an angsty teenager.Poe spoke to methis quote most of all.It was the bare bones explanation, but she didnt want to get into how her life was so often jumping the tracks and running out of her control.The feeling only got worse the older she got, when she realized that her father didnt care if she had a brain in her head as long as she did what she was told and didnt talk back.There was no room in their world for a woman with ambitions of her own, even if they would have benefited her family.The so called insanity was her only escapeher dancing and drinking and menbut the real world was always waiting when she came home.I get it.But well talk about it again later.Right now I have other priorities.He rolled her nipples between his fingers, and she nearly shot off the bed.James shifted down and took one into his mouth while his hand kept up the assault on her other breast, the twin sensations of his tongue and fingers making her cry out.Each pull of his mouth sent a bolt of desire straight to her core, but it was never enough to take her into oblivion.James.Ive got what you need, lovely.He moved down her body, kissing his way over her ribs and down the center of her stomach as he settled between her legs.Ive been thinking about tasting you since that first night.His lips moved over the lace of her panties.Its fucking consumed me.Carrigan didnt so much as breathe as he pulled the fabric to the side.His breath ghosted over her and thenoh Godhis tongue was there, tasting her.Her entire body quivered with the need to move, to arch up, to do something to keep the delicious feeling going, but she forced herself to hold still.If she tried to take charge, he might stop, and that wasnt an option.Lift your hips.When she obeyed, he dragged her panties off and tossed them to the side.Better.And then he kissed her there, his mouth moving over her like he couldnt get enough.He growled, the sound vibrating through her as he lashed her clit with his tongue.All promises she made not to move went up in smoke.Carrigan dug her hands into his long hair, needing him to never stop.She ground against his mouth, driven by the sounds he made and the need spiraling through her.James, Im close.If he pulled away now, she might actually kill him.But he didnt.He shifted, pushing two fingers into her, touching her just the way she liked it, his tongue never moving from her clit.Her back bowed and her vision shorted out as she screamed her orgasm.He worked her until she yanked on his hair.Too much.His laugh was music to her ears.Recover fast, lovely.Were just getting started.But he moved away from her clit and kissed her thighs and then up over her hip bones, and then higher yet to her breasts.It was soft and almost worshipful, and it was all she could do to cling to him while she relearned how to breathe.*** James stretched out next to Carrigan, part of him still marveling that she was here, with himlooking at him to fulfill the need in every line of her body.It was a need he was only too happy to take care of.Fuck, hed take care of her every need if shed just let him.Not the time for thinking that kind of shit.He kissed her, savoring the way she arched up to close the distance between them.Tell me how you want it, lovely.Is this like the phone sex, where you take over almost immediately?She smiled, not looking the least bit worried if thats what he had planned.And, hell, thats pretty much what hed been thinking.Which made it that much more important that he let her take the reins.He traced a single finger down her sternum.Tonight, youre in charge.Famous last words.I mean it.The interest in her eyes caught him, even though she tried to shield it.Hed bet Carrigan didnt get the chance to lead things all that often.She might have with the men shed been with in the past, but he wasnt those men.He knew her.So he could give her this gift.It might be the only one shed allow from him.Tell me what you want, and its yours.Anything?He didnt hesitate.Anything.It wasnt a gift if there were stipulations.Carrigan rolled him onto his back and climbed up to straddle him.She lightly dug her nails into his shoulders, her green eyes serious.And if I say I want some pony play, or to peg you?It was a fight to keep relaxed.Is that what you want?He wasnt into either of those things, but hed already broken rules for this woman.What were a few more if it meant helping her escape reality for a night?It was no contest.Abruptly, she grinned.So serious.God, James, I dont want to stick anything up your ass.I was just teasing.Brat.He tickled her ribs, grinning when her laughter filled the room.You see what kind of sacrifices Im willing to make for you?Her smile disappeared like itd never existed.I dont want your sacrifices.I just want you.She leaned down, dragging her breasts over his chest.What I want more than anything tonight is to ride your cock and have you watching me the way you do.She ran her thumb along his jaw.And talking.Im going to need that, too.He turned his head and captured her thumb between his teeth, pressing down lightly before he let her go.No complaints about my talking too much.Wouldnt dream of it.She kissed him, light and quick, and he let her control it.She teased him until he tightened his grip on her hips, and only then did she open for him making that delicious little whimper as her tongue stroked his.Her whole body moved against his, the sensual slide of skin on skin so much more intimate than hed ever experienced.But it wasnt really the experience itself.It was because it was Carrigan.She was here and naked and vulnerable, and she felt safe enough with him to let it happen.He caught the back of her neck.No running tonight.Stay with me.I thought I was in charge.When he didnt release her, she sighed and dropped her forehead against his.No running.Tonight, Im yours.It was a start.He stroked his hand down her back and pressed a quick kiss to her lips.Good.So difficult.She reached over and grabbed a condom from the nightstand.Watching her rip it open and roll it onto his cock made his eyes slide to half mast.The only thing I love more than your hands on my cock is your tight pussy clamping around it.Her breath caught, and he kept going.I have a request.Hmm?She squeezed him, her gaze on his face.Leave the light on.I want to see you while you fuck me.She considered him, and hell if he knew which way shed go.Carrigan had proven time and again that she wasnt the least bit shy, but that didnt mean he could take her answer for granted.Finally she gave him one last squeeze.I think I can manage that.She rose, her body one long line, and positioned his cock at her entrance.He went perfectly still as she sank down, taking him inch by inch.Christ, lovely.He kept his grip on her hips loose through sheer force of will.Every instinct clamored for him to thrust up and pull her down, to seal them together as tightly as two people could be.But this was her show.Hed promised, and hed be damned before he went back on his word.Not tonight.Not with Carrigan.You squeeze me tight like you never want to let go.She braced herself on his chest with a hand and tossed back her hair.You feel so good, I dont want to let go.Then she started riding him, rolling her body in a way that made her breasts bounce with each movement and his eyes damn near cross with pleasure.He kept them open, refusing to miss a single second of this.Youre the most beautiful thing Ive ever fucking seen.Your breasts were made to be worshiped, and goddamn it, your skin is so soft it drives me nuts.He hissed out a breath when she reached back with her free hand to cup his balls.Fuck.Keeptalking.He gritted his teeth, silently promising her payback for this exquisite torture.If you were mine, Id keep you naked.Itd drive me batshit crazy to know you were always there and available for my cock.Wet and wanting, just like you are right now.Sounds like fun.You have no idea.Id take my phone calls with you on my desk, legs spread and pussy waiting for me.For me alone.He skated a hand over her stomach.Let me touch your clit, lovely.I want to feel you come around my cock.She kept riding him, her gaze never leaving his.Finally she nodded, taking his hand and guiding it between her legs.She kept her fingers lightly resting on the back of his hand, touching him even as he touched her.It didnt take long.He knew what she liked, and he didnt hesitate to give it to her.Carrigan cried out, her back bowing and her eyes closing as she threw back her head.He tried to hold on, tried to keep his eyes open to experience every second of her coming, but she milked his cock, hauling him over the edge despite himself.James grabbed her hips, pounding into her and following her over the edge.She slumped to his chest as he finished, and it was all he could do to lie there and just breathe.Carrigan stretched out, making him think of a cat.God, James.If anyone else talked the way you did, Id laugh them out of the bed.Theres no one like me, lovely.He kissed her temple and disentangled himself.It took a few minutes to dispose of the condom and clean up, and when he got back into the room, he found her under the covers with her eyes closed.James joined her, pulling her toward him until her back was pressed against his chest.She murmured something, twisting a little to look at him over her shoulder.I dont sleep with people.Not normally.I know.He kissed the back of her neck.Sleep, Carrigan.Ill watch over you and keep you safe while you do.There wasnt much he could promise herthat he could follow through on or that she would acceptbut this he could manage.Tonight no one would demand anything of her.Hed make sure of it.Fifteen Carrigan opened her eyes and yawned.What time is it?There was no clock in the room that she could see.She reached blindly for her purse and turned on her phone, still half asleep.The screen lit up, and the phone immediately dinged to indicate a new message.And then another.She sat up, causing James to tighten the arm hed slung around her waist.God, hes so sexy.Hed woken her up twice in the night for more sex, and she shivered at how thoroughly tired her body felt from the attention.I could get used to that.Her phone rang, startling her and she hurried to answer before it woke James up.What?Where the hell are you?Aiden.She shoved her hair back.Whats going on?It was ten in the morning.There was no reason hed be calling her this earlyor at least no good reason.Where.The.Fuck.Are.You?Okay, this was bad.She looked around wildly, but the answer didnt magically pop into existence.There were two options.She could keep avoiding and cowering, or she could try to brazen her way through this.So, really, there was only one option.Its none of your damn business.Wrong answer.Would you like to know why its my business?A car door slammed.Because our goddamn father is on a rampage, and our mother is practically breathing fire at the thought of someone, let alone one of her children, ruining this fiasco of a wedding.The wedding.Shit.She did some quick mental math.The wedding is tomorrow.Thank God.She couldnt believe shed forgotten about it.Yes, shed had a whole hell of a lot going on, and technically Teague and Callie were already married, but neither of those were legitimate excuses.Im aware.The rehearsal, however, is this evening, and no one can find you.She glanced over to where James was now awake and watching her.Theres plenty of time.Calm down.There would be, but Aileen has activities planned for Callie and the bridesmaidsincluding youtoday.Activities that youre not participating in because no one knows where the fuck you are.Carrigan read between the lines.Their mother was furious, and shed gotten their father riled up, and both of them were taking it out on Aiden.Shit rolled downhill and all that.Ill be back in an hour.She hoped.Traffic would be heavier than it had been on the way up here.You have explaining to do, Carrigan.Im not kidding.Thats what she was afraid of.But hopefully if she slipped back in and played her part for the next twenty four hours, everyone would be too busy to ask her uncomfortable questions.Hopefully.Just stall a little longer.Im on my way.She hung up before he could yell at her any more.Trouble?The sleepy gravel of Jamess voice made her body perk up despite the stress.Not in the way you mean.She slid out of bed and started throwing her clothes on.Can you drive me back?Yeah, no problem.He followed her to her feet, and she got hung up on how damn good he looked naked.Her gaze caught on the scars on his chest and held when he turned around to pull on his pants.His back was an identical mess, though the scars there almost lookedlayered.James Lets get you home before they send out a search party.He yanked on his shirt, not looking at her.If we leave now, we can swing by a drive thru and eat on the way.He didnt want to talk about the scars.She got that.She had plenty of secrets of her own.But that didnt mean she didnt want to know.Even if she could put two and two togetherthe sheer amount of scars and their placement told her they werent from some sort of accident.No, every single one of them was intentional.There was only one person Victor Halloran would allow to hurt one of his children like thatand it was Victor Halloran.She held her dress in a white knuckled grip.He beat James.He scarred James.She wanted to march down to the prison and put a bullet between his eyes.Everyone knew Brendanand probably Rickywas a monster.Had they started out that way?Or had their fatherthe one person put on this world to protect his own childrenbeen the one who broke something inside them beyond repair?Children were to be protected.Yeah, Seamus wasnt exactly father of the year, but hed never hurt her like that.Hed never so much as lifted a hand and threatened that kind of violence.And to go so far as to cut and whip and do whatever had caused the marks on Jamess body?Her mother would have killed him on the spot.She forcibly loosened her grip and finished getting dressed, fury all twisted up with sadness for the boy he used to be.Maybe she was wrong.Maybe it hadnt been Victor whod hurt his boy.Whoever did it hadnt broken James.The more she found out about him, the more amazed she was that James had grown into the man he was.A man of worth.He might not see it that wayand she was pretty damn sure he thought the exact oppositebut it was the truth.By the time she made it out of the bedroom, he was flipping his keys around his finger and staring out the window at the ocean.Carrigan paused a few feet away, not sure what the protocol was.Did she kiss him?Touch him?Just smile and head for the car?Throwing herself at him and hugging him and promising vengeance on whoever hurt him wasnt an option, no matter how much it was exactly what she wanted to do.He glanced at her, his expression shuttered.You ready?Yeah.Sorry about hauling you out of bed and forcing you to drive me back.This was so wrong, so stilted.She hated it.She cleared her throat.Look, we dont have to talk about your scars.Im sorry I mentioned them at all.He crossed to her, stopping within arms reach.Its fine.Its not something I want to get into.Maybe it was something he needed to get into.But she wasnt a shrink, and he couldnt have made himself clearer if hed turned on a neon sign that read, Back the fuck off.Hed shared about his mother last night.That was unexpected enough.This whole baring of the souls thing wasnt what they were about.It couldnt be.I understand.Okay.Good.Great.He snagged the back of her neck and pulled her in for a kiss that curled her toes.Lets get you home.*** Carrigan barely made it through the door when Aiden appeared, grabbed her elbow, and hauled her upstairs.He didnt say a word, and she kept silent because yelling at him right now would undoubtedly bring oneor bothor her parents down on her.Aiden and she might not be as close as they used to be, but his anger was still preferable to Seamus and Aileen.As soon as he closed her bedroom door behind them, she shoved him away.Get your goddamn hands off me.Where the fuck were you?He took a step toward her, but seemed to think better of it and circled her instead.Those are the same clothes you were wearing last night, arent they?Youre not my keeper.Wrong.He ran his hands through his dark hair, making it stand on end.Jesus, Carrigan, I know youre having a hell of a time with the way things are going, but can you stop being so goddamn selfish for one fucking second and think?For the first time since hed towed her up here, she actually looked at him.Aiden had always been the classically handsome one of her brothers.Teague was dark and brooding.Cillian was the edgy, too gorgeous one that made women lose their minds.Aiden was the rock.He looked like he was cracking under the pressure.There were dark smudges beneath his brown eyes, and hed lost weight recentlyweight he didnt need to lose.She reined in the impulse to yell at him like he was yelling at her, and sat on the edge of her bed.Are you okay?No, Im not fucking okay.He paced from one wall to the other and back again, each step jerky with barely restrained fury.You disappeared without a trace from that restaurant and turned off your phone.The only message you got out was telling Liam not to worry.She was going to have to send Liam a gift basket of whiskey.Its fine.Obviously Im okay.It is not fine.He looked like he wanted to shake her.Last time you disappeared like this, that bastard Halloran threatened to send us your head in a basket if we didnt comply.He would have, even though Callie turned herself over in exchange for you.Do you have any fucking idea what it did to me to sit here all night, wondering if Id ever see you again, or if one of our goddamn enemieswho seem to be multiplying by the dayhad gotten a hold of you?No, she didnt have any idea.She hadnt stopped to think that anyone would worry about her.Shed assumed that theyd be so caught up in their own dramas that she could slip back into the house without a word.I You cant keep doing thisthe clubs, the men, the drinking.I know how much these little escapades mean to you, but its not safe.She knew that.Of course she knew that.But shed weighed her growing panic over the approaching deadline against what could possibly happen to her while she was out and about.Nothings going to happen with me when Im with James.She didnt have a right to that belief, but she couldnt shake it.He might have been the reason she was taken the last time, but so much had changed since then.Hell, everything had changed.She couldnt say as much to Aiden, though.Im sorry I worried you.Which isnt the same thing as saying you wont do it again.He dropped next to her on the bed with a sigh.We might be at peace, but that doesnt mean a damn thing and we both know it.There are more enemies to fear than just the Hallorans.Considering shed spent the night with one and was no worse for wear, she believed it.ExceptWhat other enemies?I dont know.He laughed, but not like anything was funny.All Im getting are rumors and things that could be coincidence.Father thinks Im insane, but I cant help feeling like someone is circling us, looking for weaknesses.He grabbed her arm.Promise me you wont go out alone anymore, Carrigan.I couldnt handle it if something happened to you.Again.The last word might be unspoken, but it still stood between them.The truth was that she was a liability, and her habits made her even more so.You know I only have until my birthday to make a decision.He didnt look at her.I know.And youre still asking me to be good and stay out of trouble, even though this is my last chance at a little slice of freedom?I am.A muscle in his jaw twitched.I might be a dick, but I think your life is worth more than your happiness.She wasnt sure if she agreed.Oh, Carrigan didnt want to die.Shed come face to face with that fate in the Halloran house and shed fought tooth and nail to avoid it.But happiness was such a delicate and fleeting thing.Shed gotten a glimpse of what it might feel like last night with James, and she craved more, like a junkie jonesing for her next hit.She couldnt make the promise Aiden wantednot without lying.She slipped her arm free of his hold.Lets get through this wedding, and then well talk.Carrigan Ive got to shower and get changed.Ill make sure I apologize to Mother for missing the activities she had planned today.Maybe if she kept talking, hed realize there was no way in hell this discussion was happening todayor ever.Aiden sighed again.Fine.You win this time.Get your shit together and Ill see if I can calm down Father before the rehearsal.Dont be late.I wouldnt dream of it.She held her breath until he left her room, closing the door softly behind him, and then lay back on her bed and stared at the ceiling.Aiden didnt understand what he was asking of her.He felt bad about it, at least in theory, but he was like Seamus in only seeing the bottom line.The only difference between her brother and father was that her brother would lose his mind if he lost her.Even with all the changes hed gone through lately, she never doubted Aiden loved her.That love wouldnt be enough for him to defy their fathers plans for her, but it was there nonetheless.But obeying meant never seeing James again.Never seeing those icy blue eyes flare hot with desire.Never losing herself in his arms.Never delving into the secrets he carried around with him like Atlas carrying the world.She couldnt do it.It was more than just the deadline bearing down on her.She couldnt give James up.Not yet.Not until she absolutely had to.*** Sloan drifted through the reception hall, a glass of white wine dangling from her fingers.She didnt usually drink, but after the day with her mother, it was a necessary measure.She leaned against the wall, searching the peoples faces around her.Carrigan was back.She knew that.But she wouldnt be able to breathe easy until she actually laid eyes on her sister.Shes got to stop disappearing like this.Everyone worries so much, and it throws everything into chaos.The words fell flat, even in her head.The truth was she envied Carrigan her nights of freedom.They might be small in the grand scale of things, but they were more than Sloan could work up the courage to do for herself.Her only escape lay in the books populating the houses library, and even those were cold comfort these days.Fantasy worlds were all well and good, but there always came the time when she had to put down the book and resume real life.She might face dragons and beautiful men and adventures beyond telling in those pages, but in her day to day life she was just a rabbit of a woman.Cillian used to tease her when they were little, saying she was afraid of her own shadow.Hes not far off.Bitterness clawed up her throat, the taste acid on her tongue.If she was braver, she would have taken Teagues offer to get her away.But the sad truth was that she didnt know who she was if she wasnt Sloan OMalley, fifth child of Seamus and Aileen OMalley, obedient daughter andboring.So incredibly boring.I want more, I just dont know what that more is.But it was a waste of time and energy to rail at her situation, because the truth was that she wasnt ever going to change.Shed do what her father wanted and, when the time came, shed marry who he picked for her, slowly withering away like a flower on a vine.At least the flower had a second chance at life when spring came around.Sloan didnt.Hey, squirt.Youre looking awfully dark and down over here in the shadows.Cillian leaned against the wall next to her.Didnt you know that Teague has the market cornered on brooding?You cant take that away from him the night before his wedding.She looked over to where the brother in question stood in the middle of a group of people, grinning down at his wife like she was the most beautiful thing hed ever seen.No ones ever going toOh my God, Cillians right.Im sitting over here, brooding.She took a sip of her wine.I was just thinking.Thinking is all you ever do, squirt.Youve got to get out in the world and live a little.She eyed his nearly empty drinkno doubt it wasnt his first for the night.I think you do enough living for both of us.Not how it works.He finished the pale amber liquid in his glass.Life experience cant be shared, not really.I could tell you stories He glanced at her.Then again, youre my little sister and I think those stories might burn your virgin ears.Heat crept up her neck and over her face.Theres such a thing as too much information.I couldnt agree more.But my point standsI could go out and do the craziest shit anyones ever seen, and it wouldnt count any more in life experience for you than those books you like to read.She knew that.Lord, she knew that.But wishing for courage to do something elsesomething wildwith her life was a long way off from actually taking that first step to do it.Sloan might only be twenty three, but she knew herself.She liked her quiet, safe, boring life.Maybe it wasnt always safe safe, but if she put herself out in the world, there were no guarantees of even that.Ill take it into consideration.No, you wont.He snorted.Youre saying that because you think its what I want to hear, but in reality youll be holed up in that nook in the library with a book, reading about someone elses adventures.He seemed to realize how harsh he sounded, because he sent her an apologetic look.Sorry, squirt.If you cant tell already, Im not exactly good company tonight.She could.One benefit to always standing in the shadows was that she saw more than the average person.Shed known the second she got back from Connecticut that something about Cillian had changed.He still pasted on the carefree attitude when he had to, but that wasnt the man he was anymore.Devlins death had changed him, just like itd changed them all.She reached out and squeezed his arm.Itll be okay.His smile was mirthless.Well, hell, squirt.I never pegged you for a liar.Sixteen James spent the day in meetings.It was all shit he knew hed been neglecting, but his talk with Lisa Marie had driven home just how many things hed let slip through the cracks.It was time to change that.If he was going to run the Hallorans, he had to stop pussyfooting around and run it.By the time he got back to the house, it was dark and he couldnt remember the last time hed eaten.But he was confident that there were no more nasty surprises lurking as a result of Rickys actions while James wasnt paying attention.As for Ricky It was time to do something about that, too.Ten days was long enough to let him stew.He needed to fix this.Now.He checked his phone as he walked through the door.Nothing.Not that hed expected Carrigan to call him.Shed made it pretty damn clear that she had a lot going on in the next few days, so there was no reason for the disappointment souring his stomach.Hed just spent the damn night with her.He couldnt possibly miss her.But the thought of going another few days without seeing her again made the feeling in his stomach worse.Pathetic.He could almost hear his old mans voice in his head, letting him know just what Victor Halloran thought of his son getting twisted up over a woman, let alone an OMalley woman.A distraction.Thats all she is.Nothing good will come of it.He bypassed the kitchenno point in eating until he dealt with his brotherand made his way downstairs.It was eerily quiet in the basement, the silence broken only by the occasional sound of the house settling.Even though this place wasnt old, it still had the feeling of something tired and exhausted, the history of too many bad memories weighing it down.Id like to light a match and leave it to burn.He unlocked the door to Rickys cell and walked in.His brother lounged on the rickety old bed, his head propped on his arms as he stared at the ceiling.James.Ricky.He moved to lean against the wall opposite.Ricky didnt look like a broken man, but then, this was the least of what their old man had put them through.His brother had nearly the same scars James did.He opened his mouth, and then reconsidered.There had to be a better way to do thisall of this.What do you want?Everything.Ricky sat up.But since thats not on the table, Id settle for you not treating me like your annoying kid brother and actually showing a little fucking respect.He had two options.He could leave his little brother down here to rot, secure in the knowledge that he wasnt causing trouble.Or he could take a risk and see if a little more responsibility would be the thing to get Ricky on track.And it was a risk.But James was all too aware of the whispers that circulated among his men.Plenty of people werent happy that he was rolling with the peace talks instead of striking directly into the heart of the OMalleys and Sheridans.If they thought he was locking away Ricky because he was scared of him, it would put James in a precarious place.If he could somehow get his brother on the same page, it would kill multiple birds with one stone.Not that he was going to trust Rickythe only reason his brother would suddenly have a change of heart is that he wanted something and had to go through James to get it.But maybe he could channel that to his purposes.Ill show you respect when you earn it.He made a show of looking around the bare room.Which youre not going to do down here.Are you ready to man up and show you can take orders?Ricky narrowed his eyes.Youre letting me out.Im willing to work with you, if youre willing to obey.He seemed to think it over, but there was no masking the excitement in his eyes.Apparently his brother hated this room almost as much as James hated putting him down here.What do you want me to do?Here was the crux.Youre going to run protection duty on the border businesses.If you can manage that without starting shit with anyone, then well talk.How long?Long enough to make sure he was actually, genuinely wanting this to do right and not just playing James.Until I say so.Fine.Ricky stood and held out his hand.Ill play soldier.James shook it, but he held on when his brother would have let go.And, Ricky, stay the fuck away from Tit for Tat.Your shadow darkens that doorway, and a few days in this room will look like a goddamn paradise.He hesitated, and then gave a jerky nod.Sure thing.I was done with the tired ass tail that works there, anyway.Sure you were.He couldnt control his brothers actions across the board, but he could at least make sure that the girls who looked to him for protection were actually protected.That thought brought him back to the shipment coming in soon.He expected the proprietors to be in touch within a few days, and then hed have to decide once and for all what he was going to do about them.I could do some good in this world.Maybe then Id be able to keep myself from the slow, final slide into being the monster my father was.He kept coming back to Carrigans idea of a nonprofit.It wasnt something he could do on his own, but hed seen the way she lit up with excitement at the idea of running something like that.With her helming that side of things, he could do his part by sliding a portion of the girls into various jobs in Boston.Theyd make a hell of a team.Except we arent a team.Shes marrying someone else, and no man worth his shit is going to let her work with me on something like this.James?He blinked.From the tone of Rickys voice, hed said his name a few times.Yeah?You wont regret this.He turned and walked out of the door without looking back.Funny, but James was already regretting it.His brother was a loose cannon and he damn well knew it, but letting him out of this room was the lesser of two evils.He had to take a chance, no matter how much he didnt like it.After a few minutes, he left the cell and made his way up to his room.Another glance at his phone showed just as few calls as it had last time.Carrigan was probably still at the rehearsal, or the dinner that had undoubtedly been thrown afterward.She wasnt going to call.He was damn fool for wanting her to.Tomorrow was Teagues wedding.He mulled that over while he showered, scrubbing down his body.Hed gotten an invite only as courtesy and he damn well knew it.They didnt want him there.The strained friendship he and Teague had shared over the years had finally broken under the events of the last few months, and he didnt blame the man for the desire to punch the shit out of James that was written all over his face every time they were forced to interact.Ironically, Callista Sheridan didnt seem to hold his taking her captive against him.But then, she had shot and killed his older brother.That kind of made it hard to stand on a pedestal.He ducked under the shower spray, as if something as simple as water could wash away all his sins.Going to Teagues wedding was asking for troubletrouble he couldnt afford.The peace between the three families was precarious at best, and doing something that might jeopardize it was the height of stupidity.If he had a brain in his head, hed leave town tomorrow and avoid the temptation the whole fiasco offered.James shut off the water, knowing damn well that he wasnt going to do it.He craved the sight of Carrigan, and adding more distance between them, even for a limited time, wasnt a goddamn option.Fuck.Looked like he was going to a wedding tomorrow.*** Carrigan didnt cry.Especially at weddings.Especially at weddings whose planning had been a giant pain in her ass for the last few months and had been arranged by her parents.But the second Callie started down the aisle in her gorgeous white dress, its train like something out of a fairy tale, and Teagues eyes shone, Carrigan damn near lost it.Hes so happy.Thats all I ever wanted for him.None of her problems mattered today.They could wait.Teague and Callies happiness took priority, and she was more than happy to temporarily shelve her own baggage for a while.She clutched her miniature bouquet while Callies father handed her off to Teague and the priest began to talk about love and Christ and marriage.It couldnt be more obvious that neither of the two people at the altar gave two fucks about his words.They only had eyes for each other.Even Carrigan could admit that the wedding was gorgeous.Her mother had gone all out, and all the headaches and badgering had resulted in a picture perfect ceremony.The bridesmaids all wore long blue gowns the same color as Callies eyes, and they all had lily bouquets instead of the traditional roses, which complemented Callies lily and rose bouquet.All Carrigans remaining brothers were there, polished within an inch of their lives, and they all looked genuinely happy for the first time in longer than she cared to remember.It seemed like she wasnt the only one putting aside her baggage for Teagues big day.Teague and Callie exchanged their vows and were announced as Mr.and Mrs.Teague OMalley.No one seemed to care that theyd already been married for several monthsincluding them.And then they were down the aisle and disappearing through the huge doors, and Aiden was there, offering his arm to Carrigan.You managed to be on time, I see.Dont be a dick.She spoke through teeth clenched into a smile.Aidens attitude might stem from legitimate worry about her, but that didnt mean she was going to roll over and play dead for him.He wasnt the one being forced into a marriage he didnt want.Oh, she knew their father had his eye on several candidates for her older brother, but the sad truth was that ultimately itd be Aidens decision on both the time and the person.Carrigan didnt have that luxury.Im not worrying about it today.Easier said than done.They made it to the end of the aisle, and Carrigan walked over to hug Teague.Im so happy for you.For both of you.Thank you.And then their mother was there, ushering them all out of the church and into the waiting limo.It was a squeeze with all of them, but they managed.Carrigan ended up sandwiched between Keira and Aiden.He frowned at their younger sister.Have you been drinking?Its called celebrating.She reached around to grab a bottle of champagne that had been stashed in the bucket of ice in the corner, and took a swig.Were at a wedding, after all.From the look of her, shed been celebrating for a while before they got to the ceremony.Aiden must have come to the same conclusion.Keira, were going to talk about this.She rolled her eyes.Sure thing, Dad.Ill get right on that.For the first time, Carrigan wondered if maybe this was more than their sister just working her way through grief over Devlins death.She tried to remember the last time she saw Keira sober and came up blank.It could be chalked up to her being busy with her own dramabut what if that wasnt it at all?She exchanged a look with Aiden, their earlier bickering falling away in the face of what might be a real problem.Carrigan shook her head.Not today.Not on Teagues wedding.Aiden nodded and sat back, causing the tension among the three of them to decrease dramatically.Across from them, Teague and Callie were lost in their own world, and Cillian and Sloan were talking quietly.No one had heard or paid attention to their exchange with Keira.
