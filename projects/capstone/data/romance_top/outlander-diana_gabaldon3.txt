He looked rather bleakly toward the open archway, where the MacKenzie clansmen were massing in untidy lines.Je suis prest, he replied, in surprisingly good French.He glanced back, to see Rupert and another large MacKenzie I didnt know, faces flushed with high spirits and spirits of another kind, advancing with solid purpose.Rupert held a huge length of MacKenzie tartan cloth.Without preliminaries, the other man reached for the buckle of Jamies kilt.Best leave, Sassenach, Jamie advised briefly.Its no place for women.So I see, I responded dryly, and was rewarded with a wry smile as his hips were swathed in the new kilt, and the old one yanked deftly away beneath it, modesty preserved.Rupert and friend took him firmly by the arms and hustled him toward the archway.I turned without delay and made my way back toward the stair to the minstrels gallery, carefully avoiding the eye of any clansman I passed.Once around the corner, I paused, shrinking back against the wall to avoid notice.I waited for a moment, until the corridor was temporarily deserted, then nipped inside the gallery door and pulled it quickly to behind me, before anyone else could come around the corner and see where I had gone.The stairs were dimly lit by the glow from above, and I had no trouble keeping my footing on the worn flags.I climbed toward the noise and light, thinking of that last brief exchange.Je suis prest.I am ready.I hoped he was.* * *    The gallery was lit by pine torches, brilliant flares that rose straight up in their sockets, outlined in black by the soot their predecessors had left on the walls.Several faces turned, blinking, to look at me as I came out of the hangings at the back of the gallery; from the looks of it, all the women of the castle were up here.I recognized the girl Laoghaire, Magdalen and some of the other women I had met in the kitchens, and, of course, the stout form of Mrs.FitzGibbons, in a position of honor near the balustrade.Seeing me, she beckoned in a friendly manner, and the women squeezed against each other to let me pass.When I reached the front, I could see the whole Hall spread out beneath.The walls were decked with myrtle branches, yew and holly, and the fragrance of the evergreens rose up into the gallery, mingled with the smoke of fires and the harsh reek of men.There were dozens of them, coming, going, standing talking in small groups scattered throughout the hall, and all clad in some version of the clan tartan, be it only a plaid or a tartan bonnet worn above ordinary working shirt and tattered breeches.The actual patterns varied wildly, but the colors were mostly the samedark greens and white.Most of them were completely dressed as Jamie now was, kilt, plaid, bonnet, andin most casesbadges.I caught a glimpse of him standing near the wall, still looking grim.Rupert had disappeared into the throng, but two more burly MacKenzies flanked Jamie, obviously guards.The confusion in the hall was gradually becoming organized, as the castle residents pushed and led the newcomers into place at the lower end.Tonight was plainly special; the young lad who played the pipes at Hall had been augmented by two other pipers, one a man whose bearing and ivory mounted pipes proclaimed him a master piper.This man nodded to the other two, and soon the hall was filled with the fierce drone of pipe music.Much smaller than the great Northern pipes used in battle, these versions made a most effective racket.The chanters laid a trill above the drones that made the blood itch.The women stirred around me, and I thought of a line from Maggie Lauder:  Oh, they call me Rab the Ranter,  and the lassies all go daft,  When I blow up my chanter.If not daft, the women around me were fully appreciative, and there were many murmurs of admiration as they hung over the rail, pointing out one man or another, striding about the Hall decked in his finery.One girl spotted Jamie, and with a muffled exclamation, beckoned her friends to see.There was considerable whispering and murmuring over his appearance.Some of it was admiration for his fine looks, but more was speculation about his presence at the oath taking.I noticed that Laoghaire, in particular, glowed like a candle as she watched him, and I remembered what Alec had said in the paddockYe know her father will no let her wed outside the clan.And Colums nephew, was he?The lad might be quite a catch, at that.Bar the minor matter of outlawry, of course.The pipe music rose to a fervent pitch, and then abruptly ceased.In the dead silence of the Hall, Colum MacKenzie stepped out from the upper archway, and strode purposefully to a small platform that had been erected at the head of the room.If he made no effort to hide his disability, he did not flaunt it now either.He was splendid in an azure blue coat, heavily laced with gold, buttoned with silver, and with rose silk cuffs that turned back almost to the elbow.A tartan kilt in fine wool hung past his knees, covering most of his legs and the checked stockings on them.His bonnet was blue, but the silver badge held plumes, not holly.The entire Hall held its breath as he took center stage.Whatever else he was, Colum MacKenzie was a showman.He turned to face the assembled clansmen, raised his arms and greeted them with a ringing shout.Tulach Ard!Tulach Ard!the clansmen gave back in a roar.The woman next to me shivered.There was a short speech next, given in Gaelic.This was greeted with periodic roars of approval, and then the oath taking proper commenced.Dougal MacKenzie was the first man to advance to Colums platform.The small rostrum gave Colum enough height that the brothers met face to face.Dougal was richly dressed, but in plain chestnut velvet with no gold lace, so as not to distract attention from Colums magnificence.Dougal drew his dirk with a flourish and sank to one knee, holding the dirk upright by the blade.His voice was less powerful than Colums, but loud enough so that every word rang through the hall.I swear by the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the holy iron that I hold, to give ye my fealty and pledge ye my loyalty to the name of the clan MacKenzie.If ever my hand shall be raised against ye in rebellion, I ask that this holy iron shall pierce my heart.He lowered the dirk, kissed it at the juncture of haft and tang, and thrust it home in its sheath.Still kneeling, he offered both hands clasped to Colum, who took them between his own and lifted them to his lips in acceptance of the oath so offered.Then he raised Dougal to his feet.Turning, Colum picked up a silver quaich from its place on the tartancovered table behind him.He lifted the heavy eared cup with both hands, drank from it, and offered it to Dougal.Dougal took a healthy swallow and handed back the cup.Then, with a final bow to the laird of the clan MacKenzie, he stepped to one side, to make room for the next man in line.This same process was repeated over and over, from vow to ceremonial drink.Viewing the number of men in the line, I was impressed anew at Colums capacity.I was trying to work out how many pints of spirit he would have consumed by the end of the evening, given one swallow per oath taker, when I saw Jamie approach the head of the line.Dougal, his own oath completed, had taken up a station to Colums rear.He saw Jamie before Colum, who was occupied with another man, and I saw his sudden start of surprise.He stepped close to his brother and muttered something.Colum kept his eyes fixed on the man before him, but I saw him stiffen slightly.He was surprised, too, and, I thought, not altogether pleased.The level of feeling in the hall, high to start with, had risen through the ceremony.If Jamie were to refuse his oath at this point, I thought he could easily be torn to shreds by the overwrought clansmen around him.I wiped my palms surreptitiously against my skirt, feeling guilty at having brought him into such a precarious situation.He seemed composed.Hot as the hall was, he wasnt sweating.He waited patiently in line, showing no signs of realizing that he was surrounded by a hundred men, armed to the teeth, who would be quick to resent any insult offered to The MacKenzie and the clan.Je suis prest, indeed.Or perhaps he had decided after all to take Alecs advice?My nails were digging into my palms by the time it came his turn.He went gracefully to one knee and bowed deeply before Colum.But instead of drawing his knife for the oath, he rose to his feet and looked Colum in the face.Fully erect, he stood head and shoulders over most of the men in the hall, and he topped Colum on his rostrum by several inches.I glanced at the girl Laoghaire.She had gone pale when he rose to his feet, and I saw that she also had her fists clenched tight.Every eye in the hall was on him, but he spoke as though to Colum alone.His voice was as deep as Colums, and every word was clearly audible.Colum MacKenzie, I come to you as kinsman and as ally.I give ye no vow, for my oath is pledged to the name that I bear.There was a low, ominous growl from the crowd, but he ignored it and went on.But I give ye freely the things that I have; my help and my goodwill, wherever ye should find need of them.I give ye my obedience, as kinsman and as laird, and I hold myself bound by your word, so long as my feet rest on the lands of clan MacKenzie.He stopped speaking and stood, tall and erect, hands relaxed at his sides.Ball now in Colums court, I thought.One word from him, one sign, and theyd be scrubbing the young mans blood off the flags come morning.Colum stood unmoving for a moment, then smiled and held out his hands.After an instants hesitation, Jamie placed his own hands lightly on Colums palms.We are honored by your offer of friendship and goodwill, said Colum clearly.We accept your obedience and hold you in good faith as an ally of the clan MacKenzie.There was a lessening of the tension over the hall, and almost an audible sigh of relief in the gallery as Colum drank from the quaich and offered it to Jamie.The young man accepted it with a smile.Instead of the customary ceremonial sip, however, he carefully raised the nearly full vessel, tilted it and drank.And kept on drinking.There was a gasp of mingled respect and amusement from the spectators, as the powerful throat muscles kept moving.Surely hed have to breathe soon, I thought, but no.He drained the heavy cup to the last drop, lowered it with an explosive gasp for air, and handed it back to Colum.The honor is mine, he said, a little hoarsely, to be allied with a clan whose taste in whisky is so fine.There was an uproar at this, and he made his way toward the archway, much impeded by congratulatory handshakes and thumps on the back as he passed.Apparently Colum MacKenzie was not the only member of the family with a knack for good theater.The heat in the gallery was stifling, and the rising smoke was making my head ache before the oath taking finally came to an end, with what I assumed were a few stirring words by Colum.Unaffected by six shared quaichs of spirit, the strong voice still reverberated off the stones of the hall.At least his legs wouldnt pain him tonight, I thought, in spite of all the standing.There was a massive shout from the floor below, an outbreak of skirling pipes, and the solemn scene dissolved into a heaving surge of riotous yelling.An even louder shout greeted the tubs of ale and whisky that now appeared on trestles, accompanied by platters of steaming oatcakes, haggis, and meat.Mrs.Fitz, who must have organized this part of the proceedings, leaned precariously across the balustrade, keeping a sharp eye on the behavior of the stewards, mostly lads too young to swear a formal oath.And wheres the pheasants got to, then?she muttered under her breath, surveying the incoming platters.Or the stuffed eels, either?Drat that Mungo Grant, Ill skin him if hes burnt the eels!Making up her mind, she turned and began to squeeze toward the back of the gallery, plainly unwilling to leave administration of something so critical as the feasting in the untried hands of Mungo Grant.Seizing the opportunity, I pushed along behind her, taking advantage of the sizable wake she left through the crowd.Others, clearly thankful for a reason to leave, joined me in the exodus.Mrs.Fitz, turning at the bottom, saw the flock of women above and scowled ferociously.You wee lassies clear off to your rooms right sharp, she commanded.If youll not stay up there safe out o sight, yed best scamper awa to your own places.But no lingering in the corridors, nor peeping round the corners.Theres not a man in the place whos not half in his cups already, and theyll be far gone in an hour.Tis no place for lasses tonight.Pushing the door ajar, she peered cautiously into the corridor.The coast apparently clear, she shooed the women out the door, one at a time, sending them hurriedly on their way to their sleeping quarters on the upper floors.Do you need any help?I asked as I came even with her.In the kitchens, I mean?She shook her head, but smiled at the offer.Nay, theres no need, lass.Get along wi ye now, youre no safer than the rest.And a kindly shove in the small of the back sent me hurtling out into the dim passage.I was inclined to take her advice, after the encounter with the guard outside.The men in the Hall were rioting, dancing, and drinking, with no thought of restraint or control.No place for a woman, I agreed.Finding my way back to my room was another matter altogether.I was in an unfamiliar part of the castle, and while I knew the next floor had a breezeway that connected it to the corridor leading to my room, I couldnt find anything resembling stairs.I came around a corner, and smack into a group of clansmen.These were men I didnt know, come from the outlying clan lands, and unused to the genteel manners of a castle.Or so I deduced from the fact that one man, apparently in search of the latrines, gave it up and chose to relieve himself in a corner of the hallway as I came upon them.I whirled at once, intending to go back the way I had come, stairs or no stairs.Several hands reached to stop me, though, and I found myself pressed against the wall of the corridor, surrounded by bearded Highlanders with whisky on their breath and rape on their minds.Seeing no point in preliminaries, the man in front of me grabbed me by the waist and plunged his other hand into my bodice.He leaned close, rubbing his bearded cheek against my ear.And how about a sweet kiss, now, for the brave lads of the clan MacKenzie?Tulach Ard!Erin go bragh, I said rudely, and pushed with all my strength.Unsteady with drink, he staggered backward into one of his companions.I dodged to the side and fled, kicking off my clumsy shoes as I ran.Another shape loomed in front of me, and I hesitated.There seemed to be only one in front of me, though, and at least ten behind me, catching up fast despite their cargo of drink.I raced forward, intending to dodge around him.He stepped sharply in front of me, though, and I came to a halt, so fast that I had to put my hands on his chest to avoid crashing into him.It was Dougal MacKenzie.What in hell?he began, then saw the men after me.He pulled me behind him and barked something at my pursuers in Gaelic.They protested in the same language, but after a short exchange like the snarling of wolves, they gave it up and went off in search of better entertainment.Thank you, I said, a little dazed.Thank you.IllIll go.I shouldnt be down here.Dougal glanced down at me, and took my arm, pulling me around to face him.He was disheveled and clearly had been joining in the roistering in the Hall.True enough, lass, he said.Ye shouldna be here.Since ye are, weel, youll have to pay the penalty for that, he murmured, eyes gleaming in the half dark.And without warning, he pulled me hard against him and kissed me.Kissed me hard enough to bruise my lips and force them apart.His tongue flicked against mine, the taste of whisky sharp in my mouth.His hands gripped me firmly by the bottom and pressed me against him, making me feel the rigid hardness under his kilt through my layers of skirts and petticoats.He released me as suddenly as he had seized me.He nodded and gestured down the hall, breathing a little unsteadily.A lock of russet hair hung loose over his forehead and he brushed it back with one hand.Get ye gone, lassie, he said.Before ye pay a greater price.I went, barefoot.* * *    Given the carryings on of the night before, I had expected most inhabitants of the castle to lie late the next morning, possibly staggering down for a restorative mug of ale when the sun was highassuming that it chose to come out at all, of course.But the Highland Scots of Clan MacKenzie were a tougher bunch than I had reckoned with, for the castle was a buzzing hive long before dawn, with rowdy voices calling up and down the corridors, and a great clanking of armory and thudding of boots as men prepared for the tynchal.It was cold and foggy, but Rupert, whom I met in the courtyard on my way to the hall, assured me that this was the best sort of weather in which to hunt boar.The beasts ha such a thick coat, the colds no hindrance to them, he explained, sharpening a spearpoint with enthusiasm against a foot driven grindstone, and they feel safe wi the mist so heavy all round themcanna see the men coming toward them, ye ken.I forbore to point out that this meant the hunting men would not be able to see the boar they were approaching, either, until they were upon it.As the sun began to streak the mist with blood and gold, the hunting party assembled in the forecourt, spangled with damp and bright eyed with anticipation.I was glad to see that the women were not expected to participate, but contented themselves with offering bannocks and drafts of ale to the departing heroes.Seeing the large number of men who set out for the east wood, armed to the teeth with boar spears, axes, bows, quivers, and daggers, I felt a bit sorry for the boar.This attitude was revised to one of awed respect an hour later, when I was hastily summoned to the forests edge to dress the wounds of a man who had, as I surmised, stumbled over the beast unawares in the fog.Bloody Christ!I said, examining a gaping, jagged wound that ran from knee to ankle.An animal did this?Whats it got, stainless steel teeth?Eh?The victim was white with shock, and too shaken to answer me, but one of the fellows who had assisted him from the wood gave me a curious look.Never mind, I said, and yanked tight the compression bandage I had wound about the injured calf.Take him up to the castle and well have Mrs.Fitz give him hot broth and blankets.Thatll have to be stitched, and Ive no tools for it here.The rhythmic shouts of the same beaters still echoed in the mists of the hillside.Suddenly there was a piercing scream that rose high above fog and tree, and a startled pheasant broke from its hiding place nearby with a frightening rattle of wings.Dear God in heaven, what now?Seizing an armful of bandages, I abandoned my patient to his caretakers and headed into the forest at a dead run.The fog was thicker under the branches, and I could see no more than a few feet ahead, but the sound of excited shouting and thrashing underbrush guided me in the right direction.It brushed past me from behind.Intent on the shouting, I didnt hear it, and I didnt see it until it had passed, a dark mass moving at incredible speed, the absurdly tiny cloven hooves almost silent on the sodden leaves.I was so stunned by the suddenness of the apparition that it didnt occur to me at first to be frightened.I simply stared into the mist where the bristling black thing had vanished.Then, raising my hand to brush back the ringlets that were curling damply around my face, I saw the blotched red streak across it.Looking down, I found a matching streak on my skirt.The beast was wounded.Had the scream come from the boar, perhaps?I thought not; I knew the sound of mortal wounding.And the pig was moving well under its own power when it had passed me.I took a deep breath and went on into the wall of mist, in search of a wounded man.I found him at the bottom of a small slope, surrounded by kilted men.They had spread their plaids over him to keep him warm, but the cloth covering his legs was ominously dark with wetness.A wide scrape of black mud showed where he had tumbled down the length of the slope, and a scrabble of muddied leaves and churned earth, where he had met the boar.I sank to my knees beside the man, pulled back the cloth and set to work.I had scarcely begun when the shouts of the men around us made me turn, to see the nightmare shape appear, once more soundless, out of the trees.This time I had time to see the dagger hilt protruding from the beasts side, perhaps the work of the man on the ground before me.And the wicked yellow ivory, stained red as the mad little eyes.The men around me, as stunned as I was, began to stir and reach for weapons.Faster than the rest, a tall man seized a boar spear from the hands of a companion who stood frozen, and stepped out into the clearing.It was Dougal MacKenzie.He walked almost casually, carrying the spear low, braced in both hands, as though about to lift a spadeful of dirt.He was intent on the beast, speaking to it in an undertone, murmuring in Gaelic as though to coax the beast from the shelter of the tree it stood beside.The first charge was sudden as an explosion.The beast shot past, so closely that the brown hunting tartan flapped in the breeze of its passing.It spun at once and came back, a blur of muscular rage.Dougal leapt aside like a bullfighter, jabbing at it with his spear.Back, forth, and again.It was less a rampage than a dance, both adversaries rooted in strength, but so nimble they seemed to float above the ground.The whole thing lasted only a minute or so, though it seemed much longer.It ended when Dougal, whirling aside from the slashing tusks, raised the point of the short, stout spear and drove it straight down between the beasts sloping shoulders.There was the thunk of the spear and a shrill squealing noise that made the hairs stand up along my forearms.The small, piggy eyes cast to and fro, veering wildly in search of nemesis, and the dainty hooves sank deep in mud as the boar staggered and lurched.The squealing went on, rising to an inhuman pitch as the heavy body toppled to one side, driving the protruding dagger hilt deep in the hairy flesh.The delicate hooves spurned the ground, churning up thick clods of damp earth.The squeal stopped abruptly.There was silence for a moment, and then a thoroughly piggish grunt, and the bulk was still.Dougal had not waited to make sure of the kill, but had circled the twitching animal and made his way back to the injured man.He sank to his knees and put an arm behind the victims shoulders, taking the place of the man who had been supporting him.A fine spray of blood had spattered the high cheekbones, and drying droplets matted his hair on one side.Now then, Geordie, he said, rough voice suddenly gentle.Now then.Ive got him, man.Its all right.Dougal?Ist you, man?The wounded man turned his head in Dougals direction, struggling to open his eyes.I was surprised, listening as I rapidly checked the mans pulse and vital signs.Dougal the fierce, Dougal the ruthless, was speaking to the man in a low voice, repeating words of comfort, hugging the man hard against him, stroking the tumbled hair.I sat back on my heels, and reached again toward the pile of cloths on the ground beside me.There was a deep wound, running at least eight inches from the groin down the length of the thigh, from which the blood was gushing in a steady flow.It wasnt spurting, though; the femoral artery wasnt cut, which meant there was a good chance of stopping it.What couldnt be stopped was the ooze from the mans belly, where the ripping tushes had laid open skin, muscles, mesentery, and gut alike.There were no large vessels severed there, but the intestine was punctured; I could see it plainly, through the jagged rent in the mans skin.This sort of abdominal wound was frequently fatal, even with a modern operating room, sutures, and antibiotics readily to hand.The contents of the ruptured gut, spilling out into the body cavity, simply contaminated the whole area and made infection a deadly certainty.And here, with nothing but cloves of garlic and yarrow flowers to treat it with.My gaze met Dougals as he also looked down at the hideous wound.His lips moved, mouthing soundlessly over the mans head the words, Can he live?I shook my head mutely.He paused for a moment, holding Geordie, then reached forward and deliberately untied the emergency tourniquet I had placed around the mans thigh.He looked at me, challenging me to protest, but I made no move save a small nod.I could staunch the bleeding, and allow the man to be transported by litter back to the castle.Back to the castle, there to linger in increasing agony as the belly wound festered, until the corruption spread far enough finally to kill him, wallowing perhaps for days in long drawn out pain.A better death, perhaps, was what Dougal was giving himto die cleanly under the sky, his hearts blood staining the same leaves, dyed by the blood of the beast that killed him.I crawled over the damp leaves to Geordies head, and took half his weight on my own arm.It will be better soon, I said, and my voice was steady, as it always was, as it had been trained to be.The pain will be better soon.Aye.Its betternow.I canna feel my leg anymorenor my handsDougalare ye there?Are ye there, man?The numb hands were blindly flailing before the mans face.Dougal grasped them firmly between his own and leaned close, murmuring in the mans ear.Geordies back arched suddenly, and his heels dug deeply into the muddy ground, his body in violent protest at what his mind had begun already to accept.He gasped deeply from time to time, as a man who is bleeding to death gulps for air, hungry for the oxygen that his body is starving for.The forest was very quiet.No birds sang in the mist, and the men who waited patiently hunkered in the shadow of the trees, were silent as the trees themselves.Dougal and I leaned close together over the struggling body, murmuring and comforting, sharing the messy, heartrending, and necessary task of helping a man to die.The trip up the hill to the castle was silent.I walked beside the dead man, borne on a makeshift litter of pine boughs.Behind us, borne in precisely similar fashion, came the body of his foe.Dougal walked ahead, alone.As we entered the gate to the main courtyard, I caught sight of the tubby little figure of Father Bain, the village priest, hurrying belatedly to the aid of his fallen parishioner.Dougal paused, reaching out to stay me as I turned toward the stair leading to the surgery.The bearers with Geordies plaid shrouded body on its litter passed on, heading toward the chapel, leaving us together in the deserted corridor.Dougal held me by the wrist, looking me over intently.Youve seen men die before, he said flatly.By violence.Not a question, almost an accusation.Many of them, I said, just as flatly.And pulling myself free, I left him standing there and went to tend my living patient.* * *    The death of Geordie, hideous as it was, put only a momentary damper on the celebrations.A lavish funeral Mass was said over him that afternoon in the castle chapel, and the games began the next morning.I saw little of them, being occupied in patching up the participants.All I could say for sure of authentic Highland games is that they were played for keeps.I bound up some fumble foot who had managed to slash himself trying to dance between swords, I set the broken leg of a hapless victim whod got in the way of a carelessly thrown hammer, and I doled out castor oil and nasturtium syrup to countless children who had overindulged in sweeties.By late afternoon, I was near exhaustion.I climbed up on the surgery table in order to poke my head out of the tiny window for some air.The shouts and laughter and music from the field where the games were held had ceased.Good.No more new patients, then, at least not until tomorrow.What had Rupert said they were going to do next?Archery?Hmm.I checked the supply of bandages, and wearily closed the surgery door behind me.Leaving the castle, I trailed downhill toward the stables.I could do with some good nonhuman, nonspeaking, nonbleeding company.I also had in mind that I might find Jamie, whatever his last name was, and try again to apologize for involving him in the oath taking.True, he had brought it off well, but clearly he would not have been there at all, left to his own devices.As to the gossip Rupert might now be spreading about our supposed amorous dalliance, I preferred not to think.As to my own predicament, I preferred not to think about that, either, but I would have to, sooner or later.Having so spectacularly failed to escape at the beginning of the Gathering, I wondered whether the chances might be better at the end.True, most of the horses would be leaving, along with the visitors.But there would be a number of castle horses still available.And with luck, the disappearance of one would be put down to random thievery; there were plenty of villainous looking scoundrels hanging about the fairground and the games.And in the confusion of leaving, it might be some time before anyone discovered that I was gone.I scuffed along the paddock fence, pondering escape routes.The difficulty was that I had only the vaguest idea where I was, with reference to where I wanted to go.And since I was now known to virtually every MacKenzie between Leoch and the Border, thanks to my doctoring at the games, I would not be able to ask directions.I wondered suddenly whether Jamie had told Colum or Dougal of my abortive attempt to escape on the night of the oath taking.Neither of them had mentioned it to me, so perhaps not.There were no horses out in the paddock.I pushed open the stable door, and my heart skipped a beat to see both Jamie and Dougal seated side by side on a bale of hay.They looked almost as startled at my appearance as I was at theirs, but gallantly rose and invited me to sit down.Thats all right, I said, backing toward the door.I didnt mean to intrude on your conversation.Nay, lass, said Dougal, what Ive just been saying to young Jamie here concerns you too.I cast a quick look at Jamie, who responded with a trace of a headshake.So he hadnt told Dougal about my attempted escape.I sat down, a bit wary of Dougal.I remembered that little scene in the corridor on the night of the oath taking, though he had not referred to it since by word or gesture.Im leaving in two days time, he said abruptly.And Im taking the two of you with me.Taking us where?I asked, startled.My heart began to beat faster.Through the MacKenzie lands.Colum doesna travel, so visiting the tenants and tacksmen that canna come to the Gatheringthats left to me.And to take care of the bits of business here and there.He waved a hand, dismissing these as trivial.But why me?Why us, I mean?I demanded.He considered for a moment before answering.Why, Jamies a handy lad wi the horses.And as to you, lass, Colum thought it wise I should take ye along as far as Fort William.The commander there might be able toassist ye in finding your family in France.Or to assist you, I thought, in determining who I really am.And how much else are you not telling me?Dougal stared down at me, obviously wondering how I would take this news.All right, I said tranquilly.That sounds a good idea.Outwardly tranquil, inwardly I was rejoicing.What luck!Now I wouldnt have to try to escape from the castle.Dougal would take me most of the way himself.And from Fort William, I thought I could find my own way without much difficulty.To Craigh na Dun.To the circle of standing stones.And with luck, back home.PART THREE      On the Road      11    CONVERSATIONS WITH A LAWYER    We rode out of the gates of Castle Leoch two days later, just before dawn.In twos and threes and fours, to the sound of shouted farewells and the calls of wild geese on the loch, the horses stepped their way carefully over the stone bridge.I glanced behind from time to time, until the bulk of the castle disappeared at last behind a curtain of shimmering mist.The thought that I would never again see that grim pile of stone or its inhabitants gave me an odd feeling of regret.The noise of the horses hooves seemed muffled in the fog.Voices carried strangely through the damp air, so that calls from one end of the long string were sometimes heard easily at the other, while the sounds of nearby conversations were lost in broken murmurs.It was like riding through a vapor peopled by ghosts.Disembodied voices floated in the air, speaking far away, then remarkably near at hand.My place fell in the middle of the party, flanked on the one side by a man at arms whose name I did not know, and on the other by Ned Gowan, the little scribe I had seen at work in Colums hall.He was something more than a scribe, I found, as we fell into conversation on the road.Ned Gowan was a solicitor.Born, bred, and educated in Edinburgh, he looked the part thoroughly.A small, elderly man of neat, precise habits, he wore a coat of fine broadcloth, fine woolen hose, a linen shirt whose stock bore the merest suggestion of lace, and breeches of a fabric that was a nicely judged compromise between the rigors of travel and the status of his calling.A small pair of gold rimmed half spectacles, a neat hair ribbon and a bicorne of blue felt completed the picture.He was so perfectly the quintessential man of law that I couldnt look at him without smiling.He rode alongside me on a quiet mare whose saddle was burdened with two enormous bags of worn leather.He explained that one held the tools of his trade; inkhorn, quills, and papers.And whats the other for?I asked, eyeing it.While the first bag was plump with its contents, the second seemed nearly empty.Oh, thats for his lairdships rents, the lawyer replied, patting the limp bag.He must be expecting rather a lot, then, I suggested.Mr.Gowan shrugged good naturedly.Not so much as all that, mdear.But the most of it will be in doits and pence and other small coins.And such, unfortunately, take up more room than the larger denominations of currency.He smiled, a quick curve of thin, dry lips.At that, a weighty mass of copper and silver is still easier of transport than the bulk of his lairdships income.He turned to direct a piercing look over his shoulder at the two large mule drawn wagons that accompanied the party.Bags of grain and bunches of turnips have at least the benefit of lack of motion.Fowl, if suitably trussed and caged, I have nae argument with.Nor with goats, though they prove some inconvenience in terms of their omnivorous habits; one ate a handkerchief of mine last year, though I admit the fault was mine in allowin the fabric to protrude injudiciously from my coat pocket.The thin lips set in a determined line.I have given explicit directions this year, though.We shall not accept live pigs.The necessity of protecting Mr.Gowans saddlebags and the two wagons explained the presence of the twenty or so men who made up the rest of the rent collecting party, I supposed.All were armed and mounted, and there were a number of pack animals, bearing what I assumed were supplies for the sustenance of the party.Mrs.Fitz, among her farewells and exhortations, had told me that accommodations would be primitive or nonexistent, with many nights spent encamped along the road.I was quite curious to know what had led a man of Mr.Gowans obvious qualifications to take up a post in the remote Scottish Highlands, far from the amenities of civilized life to which he must be accustomed.Well, as to that, he said, in answer to my questions, as a young man, I had a small practice in Edinburgh.With lace curtains in the window, and a shiny brass plate by the door, with my name inscribed upon it.But I grew rather tired of making wills and drawing up conveyances, and seeing the same faces in the street, day after day.So I left, he said simply.He had purchased a horse and some supplies and set off, with no idea where he was going, or what to do once he got there.Ye see, I must confess, he said, dabbing his nose primly with a monogrammed handkerchief, to something of a taste foradventure.However, neither my stature nor my family background had fitted me for the life of highwayman or seafarer, which were the most adventurous occupations I could envision at the time.As an alternative, I determined that my best path lay upward, into the Highlands.I thought that in time I might perhaps induce some clan chieftain to, well, to allow me to serve him in some way.And in the course of his travels, he had in fact encountered such a chieftain.Jacob MacKenzie, he said, with a fond, reminiscent smile.And a wicked, red auld rascal he was.Mr.Gowan nodded toward the front of the line, where Jamie MacTavishs bright hair blazed in the mist.His grandsons verra like him, ye ken.We met first at the point of a pistol, Jacob and I, as he was robbing me.I yielded my horse and my bags with good grace, having little other choice.But I believe he was a bit taken aback when I insisted upon accompanying him, on foot if necessary.Jacob MacKenzie.That would be Colum and Dougals father?I asked.The elderly lawyer nodded.Aye.Of course, he was not laird then.That happened a few years laterwith a very small bit of assistance from me, he added modestly.Things were lesscivilized then, he said nostalgically.Oh, were they?I said politely.And Colum, er, inherited you, so to speak?Something of the kind, Mr.Gowan said.There was a wee bit o confusion when Jacob died, dye see.Colum was heir to Leoch, to be sure, but he The lawyer paused, looking ahead and behind to see that no one was close enough to listen.The man at arms had ridden forward, though, to catch up with some of his mates, and a good four lengths separated us from the wagon driver behind.Colum was a whole man to the age of eighteen or so, he resumed his story, and gave promise to be a fine leader.He took Letitia to wife as part of an alliance with the CameronsI drew up the marriage contract, he added, as a footnote, but soon after the marriage he had a bad fall, during a raid.Broke the long bone of his thigh, and it mended poorly.I nodded.It would have, of course.And then, Mr.Gowan went on with a sigh, he rose from his bed too soon, and took a tumble down the stairs that broke the other leg.He lay in his bed close on a year, but it soon became clear that the damage was permanent.And that was when Jacob died, unfortunately.The little man paused to marshal his thoughts.He glanced ahead again, as though looking for someone.Failing to find them, he settled back into the saddle.That was about the time there was all the fuss about his sisters marriage too, he said.And Dougalwell, Im afraid Dougal did not acquit himself so verra weel over that affair.Otherwise, dye see, Dougal might have been made chief at the time, but twas felt hed not the judgment for it yet.He shook his head.Oh, there was a great stramash about it all.There were cousins and uncles and tacksmen, and a great Gathering to decide the matter.But they did choose Colum, after all?I said.I marveled once again at the force of personality of Colum MacKenzie.And, casting an eye at the withered little man who rode at my side, I rather thought Colum had also had some luck in choosing his allies.They did, but only because the brothers stood firm together.There was nae doubt, ye see, of Colums courage, nor yet of his mind, but only of his body.Twas clear hed never be able to lead his men into battle again.But there was Dougal, sound and whole, if a bit reckless and hot headed.And he stood behind his brothers chair and vowed to follow Colums word and be his legs and his sword arm in the field.So a suggestion was made that Colum be allowed to become laird, as he should in the ordinary way, and Dougal be made war chieftain, to lead the clan in time of battle.It was a situation not without precedent, he added primly.The modesty with which he had said A suggestion was made made it clear just whose suggestion it had been.And whose man are you?I asked.Colums or Dougals?My interests must lie with the MacKenzie clan as a whole, Mr.Gowan said circumspectly.But as a matter of form, I have sworn my oath to Colum.A matter of form, my foot, I thought.I had seen that oath taking, though I did not recall the small form of the lawyer specifically among so many men.No man could have been present at that ceremony and remained unmoved, not even a born solicitor.And the little man on the bay mare, dry as his bones might be, and steeped to the marrow in the law, had by his own testimony the soul of a romantic.He must find you a great help, I said diplomatically.Oh, I do a bit from time to time, he said, in a small way.As I do for others.Should ye find yourself in need of advice, mdear, he said, beaming genially, do feel free to call upon me.My discretion may be relied upon, I do assure you.He bowed quaintly from his saddle.To the same extent as your loyalty to Colum MacKenzie?I said, arching my brows.The small brown eyes met mine full on, and I saw both the cleverness and the humor that lurked in their faded depths.Ah, weel, he said, without apology.Worth a try.I suppose so, I said, more amused than angered.But I assure you, Mr.Gowan, that I have no need of your discretion, at least at present.Its catching, I thought, hearing myself.I sound just like him.I am an English lady, I added firmly, and nothing more.Colum is wasting his timeand yoursin trying to extract secrets from me that dont exist.Or that do exist, but are untellable, I thought.Mr.Gowans discretion might be limitless, but not his belief.He didnt send you along just to coerce me into damaging revelations, did he?I demanded, suddenly struck by the thought.Oh, no.Mr.Gowan gave a short laugh at the idea.No, indeed, mdear.I fulfill an essential function, in managing the records and receipts for Dougal, and performing such small legal requirements that the clansmen in the more distant areas may have.And I am afraid that even at my advanced age, I have not entirely outgrown the urge to seek adventure.Things are much more settled now than they used to behe heaved a sigh that might have been one of regretbut there is always the possibility of robbery along the road, or attack near the borders.He patted the second bag on his saddle.This bag is not entirely empty, ye ken.He turned back the flap long enough for me to see the gleaming grips of a pair of scroll handled pistols, snugly set in twin loops that kept them within easy reach.He surveyed me with a glance that took in every detail of my costume and appearance.Ye should really be armed yourself, mdear, he said in a tone of mild reproof.Though I suppose Dougal thought it would not be suitablestill.Ill speak to him about it, he promised.We passed the rest of the day in pleasant conversation, wandering among his reminiscences of the dear departed days when men were men, and the pernicious weed of civilization was less rampant upon the bonny wild face of the Highlands.At nightfall, we made camp in a clearing beside the road.I had a blanket, rolled and tied behind my saddle, and with this I prepared to spend my first night of freedom from the castle.As I left the fire and made my way to a spot behind the trees, though, I was conscious of the glances that followed me.Even in the open air, it seemed, freedom had definite limits.* * *    We reached the first stopping place near noon of the second day.It was no more than a cluster of three or four huts, set off the road at the foot of a small glen.A stool was brought out from one of the cottages for Dougals use, and a plankthoughtfully brought along in one of the wagonslaid across two others to serve as a writing surface for Mr.Gowan.He withdrew an enormous square of starched linen from the tailpocket of his coat and laid it neatly over a stump, temporarily withdrawn from its usual function as chopping block.He seated himself upon this and began to lay out inkhorn, ledgers, and receipt book, as composed in his manner as though he were still behind his lace curtains in Edinburgh.One by one, the men from the nearby crofts appeared, to conduct their annual business with the lairds representative.This was a leisurely affair, and conducted with a good deal less formality than the goings on in the Hall of Castle Leoch.Each man came, fresh from field or shed, and drawing up a vacant stool, sat alongside Dougal in apparent equality, explaining, complaining, or merely chatting.Some were accompanied by a sturdy son or two, bearing bags of grain or wool.At the conclusion of each conversation, the indefatigable Ned Gowan would write out a receipt for the payment of the years rent, record the transaction neatly in his ledger, and flick a finger to one of the drovers, who would obligingly heave the payment onto a wagon.Less frequently, a small heap of coins would disappear into the depths of his leather bag with a faint chinking sound.Meanwhile, the men at arms lounged beneath the trees or disappeared up the wooded bankto hunt, I supposed.Variations of this scene were repeated over the next few days.Now and then I would be invited into a cottage for cider or milk, and all of the women would crowd into the small single room to talk with me.Sometimes a cluster of rude huts would be large enough to support a tavern or even an inn, which became Dougals headquarters for the day.Once in a while, the rents would include a horse, a sheep, or other livestock.These were generally traded to someone in the neighborhood for something more portable, or, if Jamie declared a horse fit for inclusion in the castle stables, it would be added to our string.I wondered about Jamies presence in the party.While the young man clearly knew horses well, so did most of the men in the party, including Dougal himself.Considering also that horses were both a rare sort of payment, and usually nothing special in the way of breeding, I wondered why it had been thought necessary to bring an expert along.It was a week after we had set out, in a village with an unpronounceable name, that I found out the real reason why Dougal had wanted Jamie.The village, though small, was large enough to boast a tavern with two or three tables and several rickety stools.Here Dougal held his hearings and collected his rents.And after a rather indigestible luncheon of salt beef and turnips, he held court, buying ale for the tenants and cottars who had lingered after their transactions, and a few villagers who drifted in when their daily work was completed, to gawk at the strangers and hear such news as we carried.I sat quietly on a settle in the corner, sipping sour ale and enjoying the respite from horseback.I was paying little attention to Dougals talk, which shifted back and forth between Gaelic and English, ranging from bits of gossip and farming talk to what sounded like vulgar jokes and meandering stories.I was wondering idly how long, at this rate, it might take to reach Fort William.And once there, exactly how I might best part company with the Scots of Castle Leoch without becoming equally entangled with the English army garrison.Lost in my own thoughts, I had not noticed that Dougal had been speaking for some time alone, as though making a speech of some kind.His hearers were following him intently, with occasional brief interjections and exclamations.Coming gradually back to an awareness of my surroundings, I realized that he was skillfully rousing his audience to a high pitch of excitement about something.I glanced around.Fat Rupert and the little lawyer, Ned Gowan, sat against the wall behind Dougal, tankards of ale forgotten on the bench beside them as they listened intently.Jamie, frowning into his own tankard, leaned forward with his elbows on the table.Whatever Dougal was saying, he didnt seem to care for it.With no warning, Dougal stood, seized Jamies collar and pulled.Old, and shabbily made to begin with, the shirt tore cleanly down the seams.Taken completely by surprise, Jamie froze.His eyes narrowed, and I saw his jaw set tightly, but he didnt move as Dougal spread aside the ripped flaps of cloth to display his back to the onlookers.There was a general gasp at sight of the scarred back, then a buzz of excited indignation.I opened my mouth, then caught the word Sassenach, spoken with no kindly intonation, and shut it again.Jamie, with a face like stone, stood and stepped back from the small crowd clustering around him.He carefully peeled off the remnants of his shirt, wadding the cloth into a ball.An elderly little woman, who reached the level of his elbow, was shaking her head and patting his back gingerly, making what I assumed were comforting remarks in Gaelic.If so, they were clearly not having the hoped for effect.He replied tersely to a few questions from the men present.The two or three young girls who had come in to fetch their families dinner ale were clustered together against the far wall, whispering intently to each other, with frequent big eyed glances across the room.With a look at Dougal that should by rights have turned the older man to stone, Jamie tossed the ruins of his shirt into a corner of the hearth and left the room in three long strides, shaking off the sympathetic murmurs of the crowd.Deprived of spectacle, their attentions turned back to Dougal.I didnt understand most of the comment, though the bits I caught seemed to be highly anti English in nature.I was torn between wanting to follow Jamie outside, and staying inconspicuously where I was.I doubted that he wanted any company, though, so I shrank back into my corner and kept my head down, studying my blurry, pale reflection in the surface of my tankard.The clink of metal made me look up.One of the men, a sturdy looking crofter in leather trews, had tossed a few coins on the table in front of Dougal, and seemed to be making a short speech of his own.He stood back, thumbs braced in his belt, as though daring the rest to something.After an uncertain pause, one or two bold souls followed suit, and then a few more, digging copper doits and pence out of purse and sporran.Dougal thanked them heartily, waving a hand at the landlord for another round of ale.I noticed that the lawyer Ned Gowan was tidily stowing the new contributions in a separate pouch from that used for the MacKenzie rents bound for Colums coffers, and I realized what the purpose of Dougals little performance must be.Rebellions, like most other business propositions, require capital.The raising and provisioning of an army takes gold, as does the maintenance of its leaders.And from the little I remembered of Bonnie Prince Charlie, the Young Pretender to the throne, part of his support had come from France, but part of the finances behind his unsuccessful rising had come from the shallow, thread bare pockets of the people he proposed to rule.So Colum, or Dougal, or both, were Jacobites; supporters of the Young Pretender against the lawful occupant of the throne of England, George II.Finally, the last of the cottars and tenants drifted away to their dinners, and Dougal stood up and stretched, looking moderately satisfied, like a cat that has dined at least on milk, if not cream.He weighed the smaller pouch, and tossed it back to Ned Gowan for safekeeping.Aye, well enough, he remarked.Canna expect a great deal from such a small place.But manage enough of the same, and it will be a respectable sum.Respectable is not quite the word Id use, I said, rising stiffly from my lurking place.Dougal turned, as though noticing me for the first time.No?he said, mouth curling in amusement.Why not?Have ye an objection to loyal subjects contributing their mite in support of their sovereign?None, I said, meeting his stare.No matter which sovereign it is.Its your collection methods I dont care for.Dougal studied me carefully, as though my features might tell him something.No matter which sovereign it is?he repeated softly.I thought ye had no Gaelic.I havent, I said shortly.But Ive the sense I was born with, and two ears in good working order.And whatever King Georges health may be in Gaelic, I doubt very much that it sounds like Bragh Stuart.He tossed back his head and laughed.That it doesna, he agreed.Id tell ye the proper Gaelic for your liege lord and ruler, but it isna a word suitable for the lips of a lady, Sassenach or no.Stooping, he plucked the balled up shirt out of the ashes of the hearth and shook the worst of the soot off it.Since ye dinna care for my methods, perhaps yed wish to remedy them, he suggested, thrusting the ruined shirt into my hands.Get a needle from the lady of the house and mend it.Mend it yourself!I shoved it back into his arms and turned to leave.Suit yourself, Dougal said pleasantly from behind me.Jamie can mend his own shirt, then, if youre not disposed to help.I stopped, then turned reluctantly, hand out.All right, I began, but was interrupted by a large hand that snaked over my shoulder and snatched the shirt from Dougals grasp.Dividing an opaque glance evenly between us, Jamie tucked the shirt under his arm and left the room as silently as he had entered it.* * *    We found accommodation for the night at a crofters cottage.Or I should say I did.The men slept outside, disposed in various haystacks, wagon beds and patches of bracken.In deference to my sex or my status as semicaptive, I was provided with a pallet on the floor inside, near the hearth.While my pallet seemed vastly preferable to the single bedstead in which the entire family of six was sleeping, I rather envied the men their open air sleeping arrangements.The fire was not put out, only damped for the night, and the air in the cottage was stifling with warmth and the scents and sounds of the tossing, turning, groaning, snoring, sweating, farting inhabitants.After some time, I gave up any thought of sleeping in that smothered atmosphere.I rose and stole quietly outside, taking a blanket with me.The air outside was so fresh by contrast with the congestion in the cottage that I leaned against the stone wall, gulping in enormous lungfuls of the delicious cool stuff.There was a guard, sitting in quiet watchfulness under a tree by the path, but he merely glanced at me.Apparently deciding that I was not going far in my shift, he went back to whittling at a small object in his hands.The moon was bright, and the blade of the tiny sgian dhu flickered in the leafy shadows.I walked around the cottage, and a little way up the hill behind it, careful to watch for slumbering forms in the grass.I found a pleasant private spot between two large boulders and made a comfortable nest for myself from heaped grass and the blanket.Stretched at length on the ground, I watched the full moon on its slow voyage across the sky.Just so had I watched the moon rise from the window of Castle Leoch, on my first night as Colums unwilling guest.A month, then, since my calamitous passage through the circle of standing stones.At least I now thought I knew why the stones had been placed there.Likely of no particular importance in themselves, they were markers.Just as a signpost warns of rockfalls near a cliff edge, the standing stones were meant to mark a spot of danger.A spot wherewhat?Where the crust of time was thin?Where a gate of some sort stood ajar?Not that the makers of the circles would have known what it was they were marking.To them, the spot would have been one of terrible mystery and powerful magic; a spot where people disappeared without warning.Or appeared, perhaps, out of thin air.That was a thought.What would have happened, I wondered, had anyone been present on the hill of Craigh na Dun when I made my abrupt appearance?I supposed it might depend on the time one entered.Here, had a cottar encountered me under such circumstances, I would doubtless have been thought a witch or a fairy.More likely a fairy, popping into existence on that particular hill, with its reputation.And that might well be where its reputation came from, I thought.If people through the years had suddenly disappeared, or just as suddenly appeared from nowhere at a certain spot, it might with good reason acquire a name for enchantment.I poked a foot out from under the blanket and waggled my long toes in the moonlight.Most unfairylike, I decided critically.At five foot six, I was quite a tall woman for these times; as tall as many men.Since I could hardly pass as one of the Wee Folk, then, I would likely have been thought a witch or an evil spirit of some kind.From the little I knew of current methods for dealing with such manifestations, I could only be grateful that no one, in fact, had seen me appear.I wondered idly what would happen if it worked the other way.What if someone disappeared from this time, and popped up in my own?That, after all, was precisely what I was intending to do, if there were any possible way of managing it.How would a modern day Scot, like Mrs.Buchanan, the postmistress, react if someone like Murtagh, for instance, were suddenly to spring from the earth beneath her feet?The most likely reaction, I thought, would be to run, to summon the police, or perhaps to do nothing at all, beyond telling ones friends and neighbors about the most extraordinary thing that happened the other day.As for the visitor?Well, he might manage to fit into the new time without arousing excessive attention, if he was cautious and lucky.After all, I was managing to pass with some success as a normal resident of this time and place, though my appearance and language had certainly aroused plenty of suspicion.What if a displaced person were too different, though, or went about loudly proclaiming what had happened to him?If the exit were in primitive times, likely a conspicuous stranger would simply have been killed on the spot without further inquiry.And in more enlightened times, they would most likely be considered mad and tidied away into an institution somewhere, if they didnt quiet down.This sort of thing could have been going on as long the earth itself, I reflected.Even when it happened in front of witnesses, there would be no clues at all; nothing to tell what had happened, because the only person who knew would be gone.And as for the disappeared, theyd likely keep their mouths shut at the other end.Deep in my thoughts, I hadnt noticed the faint murmur of voices or the stirrings of footsteps through the grass, and I was quite startled to hear a voice speak only a few yards away.Devil take ye, Dougal MacKenzie, it said.Kinsman or no, I dinna owe ye that.The voice was pitched low, but tight with anger.Do ye no?said another voice, faintly amused.I seem to recall a certain oath, giving your obedience.So long as my feet rest on the lands of clan MacKenzie, I believe was the way of it.There was a soft thud, as of a foot stamping packed earth.And MacKenzie land it is, laddie.I gave my word to Colum, not to you.So it was young Jamie MacTavish, and precisely three guesses as to what he was upset about.One and the same, man, and ye ken it well.There was the sound of a light slap, as of a hand against a cheek.Your obedience is to the chieftain of the clan, and outside of Leoch, I am Colums head and arms and hands as well as his legs.And never saw I a better case of the right hand not knowin what the left is up to, came the quick rejoinder.Despite the bitterness of the tone, there was a lurking wit that enjoyed this clash of wills.What dye think the right is going to say about the left collecting gold for the Stuarts?There was a brief pause before Dougal replied, MacKenzies and MacBeolains and MacVinichs; theyre free men all.None can force them to give against their will, and none can stop them, either.And who knows?It may happen that Colum will give more for Prince Charles Edward than all o them put together, in the end.It may, the deeper voice agreed.It may rain straight up tomorrow instead of down, as well.That doesna mean Ill stand waiting at the stairhead wi my wee bucket turned upside down.No?Youve more to gain from a Stuart throne than I have, laddie.And naught from the English, save a noose.If ye dinna care for your own silly neck  My neck is my own concern, Jamie interrupted savagely.And so is my back.Not while ye travel with me, sweet lad, said his uncles mocking voice.If ye wish to hear what Horrocks may tell ye, youll do as youre told, yourself.And wise to do it, at that; a fine hand ye may be wi a needle, but youve no but the one clean shirt.There was a shifting, as of someone rising from his seat on a rock, and the soft passage of footsteps through the grass.Only one set of footsteps, though, I thought.I sat up as quietly as I could, and peered cautiously around the edge of one of the boulders that hid me.Jamie was still there, sitting hunched on a rock a few feet away, elbows braced on his knees, chin sunk on his locked hands.His back was mostly to me.I started to ease backward, not wishing to intrude on his solitude, when he suddenly spoke.I know youre there, he said.Come out, if ye like.From his tone, it was a matter of complete indifference to him.I rose and started to come out, when I realized I had been lying in my shift.Reflecting that he had enough to worry about without needing to blush for me as well, I tactfully wrapped myself in the blanket before emerging.I sat down near him and leaned back against a rock, watching him a little diffidently.Beyond a brief nod of acknowledgment, he ignored me, completely occupied with inward thoughts of no very pleasant form, to judge from the dark frown on his face.One foot tapped restlessly against the rock he sat on, and he twisted his fingers together, clenching, then spreading them with a force that made several knuckles pop with soft crackling sounds.It was the popping knuckles that reminded me of Captain Manson.The supply officer for the field hospital where I had worked, Captain Manson suffered shortages, missed deliveries, and the endless idiocies of the army bureaucracy as his own personal slings and arrows.Normally a mild and pleasant spoken man, when the frustrations became too great, he would retire briefly into his private office and punch the wall behind the door with all the force he could muster.Visitors in the outer reception area would watch in fascination as the flimsy wallboard quivered under the force of the blows.A few moments later, Captain Manson would reemerge, bruised of knuckle but once more calm of spirit, to deal with the current crisis.By the time he was transferred to another unit, the wall behind his door was pocked with dozens of fist sized holes.Watching the young man on the rock trying to disjoint his own fingers, I was forcibly reminded of the captain, facing some insoluble problem of supply.You need to hit something, I said.Eh?He looked up in surprise, apparently having forgotten I was there.Hit something, I advised.Youll feel better for it.His mouth quirked as though about to say something, but instead he rose from his rock, headed decisively for a sturdy looking cherry tree, and dealt it a solid blow.Apparently finding this some palliative to his feelings, he smashed the quivering trunk several times more, causing a delirious shower of pale pink petals to rain down upon his head.Sucking a grazed knuckle, he came back a moment later.Thank ye, he said, with a wry smile.Perhaps Ill sleep tonight after all.Did you hurt your hand?I rose to examine it, but he shook his head, rubbing the knuckles gently with the palm of the other hand.Nay, its nothing.We stood a moment in awkward silence.I didnt want to refer to the scene I had overheard, or to the earlier events of the evening.I broke the silence finally by saying, I didnt know you were a lefty.A lefty?Oh, cack handed, ye mean.Aye, always have been.The schoolmaster used to tie that one to my belt behind my back, to make me write wi the other.Can you?Write with the other, I mean?He nodded, reapplying the injured hand to his mouth.Aye.Makes my head ache to do it, though.Do you fight left handed too?I asked, wanting to distract him.With a sword, I mean?He was wearing no arms at the moment except his dirk and sgian dhu, but during the day he customarily wore both sword and pistols, as did most of the men in the party.No, I use a sword well enough in either hand.A left handed swordsmans at a disadvantage, ye ken, wi a small sword, for ye fight wi your left side turned to the enemy, and your hearts on that side, dye see?Too filled with nervous energy to keep still, he had begun to stride about the grassy clearing, making illustrative gestures with an imaginary sword.It makes little difference wi a broadsword, he said.He extended both arms straight out, hands together and swept them in a flat, graceful arc through the air.Ye use both hands, usually, he explained.Or if youre close enough to use only one, it doesna matter much which, for you come down from above and cleave the man through the shoulder.Not the head, he added instructively, for the blade may slip off easy.Catch him clean in the notch, thoughhe chopped the edge of his hand at the juncture of neck and shoulderand hes dead.And if its not a clean cut, still the man will no fight again that dayor ever, likely, he added.His left hand dropped to his belt and he drew the dirk in a motion like water pouring from a glass.Now, to fight wi sword and dirk together, he said, if ye have no targe to shelter your dirk hand, then you favor the right side, wi the small sword in that hand, and come up from underneath wi the dirk if ye fight in close.But if the dirk hand is well shielded, ye can come from either side, and twist your body abouthe ducked and weaved, illustratingto keep the enemys blade away, and use the dirk only if ye lose the sword or the use of the sword arm.He dropped low and brought the blade up in a swift, murderous jab that stopped an inch short of my breast.I stepped back involuntarily, and at once he stood upright, sheathing the dirk with an apologetic smile.Im sorry.Im showin off.I didna mean to startle ye.Youre awfully good, I said, with sincerity.Who taught you to fight?I asked.Id think youd need another left handed fighter to show you.Aye, it was a left handed fighter.The best Ive ever seen.He smiled briefly, without humor.Dougal MacKenzie.Most of the cherry blossoms had fallen from his head by now; only a few pink petals clung to his shoulders, and I reached out to brush them away.The seam of his shirt had been mended neatly, I saw, if without artistry.Even a rip through the fabric had been catch stitched together.Hell do it again?I said abruptly, unable to stop myself.He paused before answering, but there was no pretense of not understanding what I meant.Oh, aye, he said at last, nodding.It gets him what he wants, ye see.And youll let him do it?Let him use you that way?He looked past me, down the hill toward the tavern, where a single light still showed through chinks in the timbers.His face was smooth and blank as a wall.For now.* * *    We continued on our rounds, moving no more than a few miles a day, often stopping for Dougal to conduct business at a crossroads or a cottage, where several tenants would gather with their bags of grain and bits of carefully hoarded money.All was recorded in ledgers by the quick moving pen of Ned Gowan, and such receipts as were needed dispensed from his scrap bag of parchment and papers.And when we reached a hamlet or village large enough to boast an inn or tavern, Dougal would once more do his turn, standing drinks, telling stories, making speeches, and finally, if he judged the prospects good enough, he would force Jamie to his feet to show his scars.And a few more coins would be added to the second bag, the purse bound for France and the court of the Pretender.I tried to judge such scenes as they developed, and step outside before the climax, public crucifixion never having been much to my taste.While the initial reaction to the sight of Jamies back was horrified pity, followed by bursts of invective against the English army and King George, often there was a slight flavor of contempt that even I could pick up.On one occasion I heard one man remark softly to a friend in English, An awfu sight, man, is it no?Christ, Id die in my blood before I let a whey faced Sassenach to use me so.Angry and miserable to start with, Jamie grew more wretched each day.He would shrug back into his shirt as soon as possible, avoiding questions and commiseration, and seek an excuse to leave the gathering, avoiding everyone until we took horse the following morning.The breaking point came a few days later, in a small village called Tunnaig.This time, Dougal was still exhorting the crowd, a hand on Jamies bare shoulder, when one of the onlookers, a young lout with long, dirty brown hair, made some personal remark to Jamie.I couldnt tell what was said, but the effect was instantaneous.Jamie wrenched out of Dougals grasp and hit the lad in the stomach, knocking him flat.I was slowly learning to put a few words of Gaelic together, though I could in no way be said to understand the language yet.However, I had noticed that I often could tell what was being said from the attitude of the speaker, whether I understood the words or not.Get up and say that again, looks the same said in any schoolyard, pub, or alley in the world.So does Right you are, mate, and Get him, lads!Jamie disappeared under an avalanche of grimy work clothes as the rents table went over with a crash beneath the weight of brown hair and two of his friends.Innocent bystanders pressed back against the walls of the tavern and prepared to enjoy the spectacle.I sidled closer to Ned and Murtagh, eyeing the heaving mass of limbs uneasily.A lonely flash of red hair showed occasionally in the twisting sea of arms and legs.Shouldnt you help him?I murmured to Murtagh, out of the corner of my mouth.He looked surprised at the idea.No, why?Hell call for help if he needs it, said Ned Gowan, tranquilly watching from my other side.Whatever you say.I subsided doubtfully.I wasnt at all sure Jamie would be able to call for help if he needed it; at the moment he was being throttled by a stout lad in green.My personal opinion was that Dougal would soon be short one prime exhibit, but he didnt seem concerned.In fact, none of the watchers seemed at all bothered by the mayhem taking place on the floor at our feet.A few bets were being taken, but the overall air was one of quiet enjoyment of the entertainment.I was glad to notice that Rupert drifted casually across the path of a couple of men who seemed to be contemplating joining the action.As they took a step toward the fray, he bumbled absentmindedly into their way, hand lightly resting on his dirk.They fell back, deciding to leave well enough alone.The general feeling appeared to be that three to one was reasonable odds.Given that the one was quite large, an accomplished fighter, and obviously in the grip of a berserk fury, that might be true.The contest seemed to be evening out with the abrupt retirement of the stout party in green, dripping blood as the result of a well placed elbow to the nose.It went on for several minutes more, but the conclusion became more and more obvious, as a second fighter fell by the wayside and rolled under a table, moaning and clutching his groin.Jamie and his original antagonist were still hammering each other earnestly in the middle of the floor, but the Jamie backers amongst the spectators were already collecting their winnings.A forearm across the windpipe, accompanied by a vicious kidney punch, decided brown hair that discretion was the better part of valor.I added a mental translation of Thats enough, I give up, to my growing Gaelic/English word list.Jamie rose slowly off the body of his last opponent to the cheers of the crowd.Nodding breathlessly in acknowledgment, he staggered to one of the few benches still standing, and flopped down, streaming sweat and blood, to accept a tankard of ale from the publican.Gulping it down, he set the empty tankard on the bench and leaned forward, gasping for breath, elbows on his knees and the scars on his back defiantly displayed.For once he was in no hurry to resume his shirt; in spite of the chill in the pub, he remained half naked, only putting on his shirt to go outside when it was time to seek our lodging for the night.He left to a chorus of respectful good nights, looking more relaxed than he had in days, in spite of the pain from scrapes, cuts, and assorted contusions.* * *    One scraped shin, one cut eyebrow, one split lip, one bloody nose, six smashed knuckles, one sprained thumb, and two loosened teeth.Plus more contusions than I care to count.I completed my inventory with a sigh.How do you feel?We were alone, in the small shed behind the inn where I had taken him to administer first aid.Fine, he said, grinning.He started to stand up, but froze halfway, grimacing.Aye, well.Perhaps the ribs hurt a bit.Of course they hurt.Youre black and blueagain.Why do you do such things?What in Gods name do you think youre made of?Iron?I demanded irritably.He grinned ruefully and touched his swollen nose.No.I wish I were.I sighed again and prodded him gently around the middle.I dont think theyre cracked; its only bruises.Ill strap them, though, in case.Stand up straight, roll up your shirt, and hold your arms out from your sides.I began to tear strips from an old shawl Id got from the innkeepers wife.Muttering under my breath about sticking plaster and other amenities of civilized life, I improvised a strap dressing, pulling it tight and fastening it with the ring brooch off his plaid.I cant breathe, he complained.If you breathe, it will hurt.Dont move.Where did you learn to fight like that?Dougal, again?No.he winced away from the vinegar I was applying to the cut eyebrow.My father taught me.Really?What was your father, the local boxing champion?Whats boxing?No, he was a farmer.Bred horses too.Jamie sucked in his breath as I continued the vinegar application on his barked shin.When I was nine or ten, he said he thought I was going to be big as my mothers folk, so Id have to learn to fight.He was breathing more easily now, and held out a hand to let me rub marigold ointment into the knuckles.He said, If youre sizable, half the men ye meet will fear ye, and the other half will want to try ye.Knock one down, he said, and the rest will let ye be.But learn to do it fast and clean, or youll be fightin all your life.So hed take me to the barn and knock me into the straw until I learned to hit back.Ow!That stings.Fingernail gouges are nasty wounds, I said, swabbing busily at his neck.Especially if the gouger doesnt wash regularly.And I doubt that greasy haired lad bathes once a year.Fast and clean isnt quite how Id describe what you did tonight, but it was impressive.Your father would be proud of you.I spoke with some sarcasm, and was surprised to see a shadow pass across his face.My fathers dead, he said flatly.Im sorry.I finished the swabbing, then said softly, But I meant it.He would be proud of you.He didnt answer, but gave me a half smile in reply.He suddenly seemed very young, and I wondered just how old he was.I was about to ask when a raspy cough from behind announced a visitor to the shed.It was the stringy little man named Murtagh.He eyed Jamies strapped up ribs with some amusement, and lobbed a small wash leather bag through the air.Jamie put up a large hand and caught it easily, with a small clinking sound.And whats this?he asked.Murtagh raised one sketchy brow.Your share o the wagers, what else?Jamie shook his head and made to toss the bag back.I didna wager anything.Murtagh raised a hand to stop him.You did the work.Youre a verra popular fellow at the moment, at least wi those that backed ye.But not with Dougal, I dont suppose, I interjected.Murtagh was one of those men who always looked a bit startled to find that women had voices, but he nodded politely enough.Aye, thats true.Still, I dinna see as that should trouble ye, he said to Jamie.No?A glance passed between the two men, with a message I didnt understand.Jamie blew his breath out softly through his teeth, nodding slowly to himself.When?he asked.A week.Ten days, perhaps.Near a place called Lag Cruime.Youll know it?Jamie nodded again, looking more content than I had seen him in some time.I know it.I looked from one face to the other, both closed and secretive.So Murtagh had found out something.Something to do with the mysterious Horrocks perhaps?I shrugged.Whatever the cause, it appeared that Jamies days as an exhibition were over.I suppose Dougal can always tap dance instead, I said.Eh?The secretive looks changed to looks of startlement.Never mind.Sleep well.I picked up my box of medical supplies and went to find my own rest.12    THE GARRISON COMMANDER    We were drawing nearer to Fort William, and I began to ponder seriously what my plan of action should be, once we had arrived there.It depended, I thought, upon what the garrison commander was likely to do.If he believed that I was a gentlewoman in distress, he might provide me with temporary escort toward the coast and my putative embarkation for France.But he might be suspicious of me, turning up in the company of the MacKenzies.Still, I was patently not a Scot myself; surely he would not be inclined to think me a spy of some sort?That was evidently what Colum and Dougal thoughtthat I was an English spy.Which made me wonder what I was meant to be spying on?Well, unpatriotic activities, I supposed; of which, collecting money for the support of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, pretender to the throne, was definitely one.But in that case, why had Dougal allowed me to see him do it?He could easily enough have sent me outside before that part of the proceedings.Of course, the proceedings had all been held in Gaelic, I argued with myself.Perhaps that was the point, though.I remembered the odd gleam in his eyes and his question, I thought ye had no Gaelic?Perhaps it was a test, to see whether I really was ignorant of the language.For an English spy scarcely would have been sent into the Highlands, unable to speak with more than half the people there.But no, the conversation I had overheard between Jamie and Dougal would seem to indicate that Dougal was indeed a Jacobite, though Colum apparently was notyet.My head was beginning to buzz with all these suppositions, and I was glad to see that we were approaching a fairly large village.Likely that meant a good inn, as well, and a decent supper.The inn was in fact commodious, by the standards I had grown accustomed to.If the bed was apparently designed for midgetsand flea bitten ones, at thatat least it was in a chamber to itself.In several of the smaller inns, I had slept on a settle in the common room, surrounded by snoring male forms and the humped shadows of plaid wrapped shapes.Customarily I fell asleep immediately, whatever the sleeping conditions, worn out by a day in the saddle and an evening of Dougals politicizing.The first evening in an inn, though, I had remained awake for a good half hour, fascinated by the remarkable variety of noises the male respiratory apparatus could produce.An entire dormitory full of student nurses couldnt come close.It occurred to me, listening to the chorus, that men in a hospital ward seldom really snore.Breathe heavily, yes.They gasp, groan occasionally, and sometimes sob or cry out in sleep.But there was no comparison to this healthy racket.Perhaps it was that sick or injured men could not sleep deeply enough to relax into that sort of din.If my observations were sound, then my companions were plainly in the most robust health.They certainly looked it, limbs casually asprawl, faces slack and glowing in the firelight.The complete abandon of their sleep on hard boards was the satisfying of an appetite as hearty as the one they had brought to dinner.Obscurely comforted by the cacophony, I had pulled my traveling cloak around my shoulders and went to sleep myself.By comparison, I found myself now rather lonely here in the solitary splendor of my tiny, smelly attic.Despite having removed the bedclothes and beaten the mattress to discourage unwelcome co habitants, I had some difficulty in sleeping, so silent and dark did the chamber seem after I had blown out the candle.There were a few faint echoes from the common room two floors below, and a brief flurry of noise and movement, but this served only to emphasize my own isolation.It was the first time I had been left so completely alone since my arrival at the castle, and I was not at all sure I liked it.I was hovering uneasily on the verge of sleep, when my ears picked up an ominous creaking of floorboards in the hall outside.The step was slow and halting, as though the intruder hesitated in his path, picking the soundest appearing of the boards for each next step.I sat bolt upright, groping for the candle and flint box by the bed.My hand, blindly searching, struck the flint box and knocked it to the floor with a soft thump.I froze, and the steps outside did likewise.There was a soft scratching at the door, as of someone groping for the latch.I knew the door was unbolted; though it was fitted with brackets for a bolt, I had searched unavailingly for the bolt itself before retiring.I grabbed the candlestick, yanked the stub of the candle out, and slid out of bed as quietly as I could, clutching the heavy pottery.The door squeaked slightly on its hinges as it gave.The rooms only window was tightly shuttered against both elements and light; nonetheless I could just make out the dim outline of the door as it opened.The outline grew, then to my surprise, it shrank and disappeared as the door shut again.Everything was quiet once more.I stayed pressed against the wall for what seemed like ages, holding my breath and trying to hear through the noise of my pounding heart.At last I inched toward the door, edging carefully around the room next to the wall, thinking the floorboards must surely be more solid here.I eased my foot down at each step, gradually trusting my weight to it, then pausing and groping with bare toes for the seam between two boards, before setting the other foot as solidly as I could judge.Once the door was reached, I paused, ear pressed to the thin panels, hands braced on the frame, on guard against a sudden bursting inward.I thought perhaps I heard slight sounds, but wasnt sure.Was it only the sounds of the activity down below, or was it the stifled breathing of someone on the other side of the panel?The constant flow of adrenaline was making me slightly sick.Tiring at last of this nonsense, I took a firm grip of my candlestick, yanked open the door, and rushed into the hallway.I say rushed; in actuality, I took two steps, trod heavily on something soft, and fell headlong into the passageway, skinning my knuckles and banging my head quite painfully on something solid.I sat up, clutching my brow with both hands, completely uncaring that I might be assassinated at any moment.The person I had stepped on was swearing in a rather breathless manner.Through the haze of pain, I was dimly aware that he (I assumed from the size and the smell of sweat that my visitor was male) had risen and was groping for the fastening of the shutters in the wall above us.A sudden inrush of fresh air made me wince and shut my eyes.When I opened them, there was enough light from the night sky for me to see the intruder.What are you doing here?I asked accusingly.At the same time Jamie asked, in a similarly accusatory tone, How much do ye weigh, Sassenach?Still a bit addled, I actually replied Nine stone, before thinking to ask Why?Ye nearly crushed my liver, he answered, gingerly prodding the affected area.Not to mention scaring living hell out of me.He reached a hand down and hauled me to my feet.Are ye all right?No, I bumped my head.Rubbing the spot, I looked dazedly around the bare hallway.What did I bang it on?I demanded ungrammatically.My head, he said, rather grumpily, I thought.Serves you right, I said nastily.What were you doing, sneaking about outside my door?He gave me a testy look.I wasna sneaking about, for Gods sake.I was sleepingor trying to.He rubbed what appeared to be a knot forming on his temple.Sleeping?Here?I looked up and down the cold, bare, filthy hallway with exaggerated amazement.You do pick the oddest places; first stables, now this.It may interest ye to know that theres a small party of English dragoons stopped in to the taproom below, he informed me coldly.Theyre a bit gone in drink, and disporting themselves a bit reckless with two women from the town.Since theres but the two lasses, and five men, some of the soldiers seemed a bit inclined to venture upward in search ofah, partners.I didna think youd care overmuch for such attentions.He flipped his plaid back over his shoulder and turned in the direction of the stairway.If I was mistaken in that impression, then I apologize.Id no intention of disturbin your rest.Good een to ye.Wait a minute.He stopped, but did not turn back, forcing me to walk around him.He looked down at me, polite but distant.Thank you, I said.It was very kind of you.Im sorry I stepped on you.He smiled then, his face changing from a forbidding mask to its usual expression of good humor.No harm done, Sassenach, he said.As soon as the headache goes away and the cracked rib heals, Ill be good as new.He turned back and pushed open the door of my room, which had swung shut in the wake of my hasty exit, owing to the fact that the builder had apparently constructed the inn without benefit of a plumb line.There wasnt a right angle in the place.Go back to bed, then, he suggested.Ill be here.I looked at the floor.Besides its essential hardness and coldness, the oaken boards were blotched with expectorations, spills, and forms of filth I didnt wish even to contemplate.The builders mark in the door lintel had said 1732, and that was plainly the last time the boards had been cleaned.You cant sleep out here, I said.Come in; at least the floor in the room isnt quite this bad.Jamie froze, hand on the doorframe.Sleep in your room with ye?He sounded truly shocked.I couldna do that!Your reputation would be ruined!He really meant it.I started to laugh, but converted it into a tactful coughing fit.Given the exigencies of road travel, the crowded state of the inns, and the crudity or complete lack of sanitary facilities, I was on terms of such physical intimacy with these men, Jamie included, that I found the idea of such prudery hilarious.Youve slept in the same room with me before, I pointed out, when I had recovered a bit.You and twenty other men.He sputtered a bit.That isna at all the same thing!I mean, it was a quite public room, and He paused as an awful thought struck him.You didna think I meant that you were suggesting anything improper?he asked anxiously.I assure ye, I  No, no.Not at all.I made haste to reassure him that I had taken no offense.Seeing that he could not be persuaded, I insisted that at the least he must take the blankets from my bed to lie upon.He agreed to this reluctantly, and only upon my repeated assurances that I would not use them myself in any case, but intended to sleep as usual in the cover of my thick traveling cloak.I tried to thank him again, as I paused by the makeshift pallet before returning to my fetid sanctuary, but he waved away my appreciation with a gracious hand.It isna entirely disintested kindness on my part, ye ken, he observed.Id as soon avoid notice myself.I had forgotten that he had his own reasons for keeping away from English soldiery.It did not escape me, however, that this could have been much better accomplished, not to say more comfortably, by his sleeping in the warm and airy stables, rather than on the floor before my door.But if anyone does come up here, I protested, theyll find you then.He reached a long arm out to grasp the swinging shutter and pulled it to.The hall was plunged in blackness, and Jamie appeared as no more than a shapeless bulk.They canna see my face, he pointed out.And in the condition theyre in, my name would be of no interest to them, either, even were I to give them the right one, which I dinna mean to do.Thats true, I said, doubtfully.Wont they wonder, though, what youre doing up here in the dark?I could see nothing of his face, but the tone of his voice told me he was smiling.Not at all, Sassenach.Theyll just think Im waiting my turn.I laughed and went in then.I curled myself on the bed and went to sleep, marveling at the mind that could make such ribald jokes even as it recoiled at the thought of sleeping in the same room with me.* * *    When I awoke, Jamie was gone.Going down to breakfast, I met Dougal at the foot of the stairs, waiting for me.Eat up quickly, lass, he said.You and I are riding to Brockton.He declined to tell me anything further, but he seemed a bit uneasy, I thought.I ate quickly, and we soon found ourselves trotting through the misty early morning.Birds were busy in the shrubbery, and the air gave promise of a warm summer day to come.Who are we going to see?I asked.You may as well tell me, since if I dont know, Ill be surprised, and if I do, Im intelligent enough to act surprised, anyway.Dougal cocked an eye at me, considering, but decided that my argument was sound.The garrison commander from Fort William, he said.I felt a minor shock.I wasnt quite ready for this.I had thought we had three days yet until we reached the Fort.But were nowhere near Fort William!I exclaimed.Mmphm.Apparently this garrison commander was an energetic sort.Not content to stay at home minding his garrison, he was out inspecting the countryside with a party of dragoons.The soldiers who had come to our inn the night before were part of this group, and had told Dougal that the commander was presently in residence at the inn at Brockton.This presented a problem, and I was silent for the rest of the ride, contemplating it.I had counted on being able to extract myself from Dougals company at Fort William, which I thought to be within a days travel of the hill of Craigh na Dun.Even unprepared for camping, and lacking food or other resources, I thought I could cover that much ground alone, and find my way to the stone circle.As to what would happen thenwell, there was no way to tell except by going there.But this development threw an unexpected spanner into my plans.If I parted company with Dougal here, as I well might, I would be four days ride from the hill, not one.And I did not have sufficient faith in my sense of direction, let alone my endurance, to risk it alone on foot among the wild crags and moors.The last weeks of rugged travel had given me a wary respect for the jagged rocks and crashing burns of the Highlands, let alone the occasional wild beast.I had no particular desire to meet a boar, for example, face to face in some deserted glen.We reached Brockton at mid morning.The mist had burned away, and the day was sunny enough to give me a sense of optimism.Perhaps it would be a simple matter, after all, to persuade the garrison commander to provide me with a small escort who could see me to the hill.I could see why the commander had chosen Brockton as his temporary headquarters.The village was large enough to boast two taverns, one of them an imposing three story edifice with attached stable.Here we stopped, turning our horses over to the attention of a hostler, who moved so slowly as to seem ossified.He had barely succeeded in reaching the stable door by the time we were inside and Dougal was ordering refreshment from the innkeeper.I was left below, contemplating a plate of rather stale looking oatcakes, while Dougal mounted the stair to the commanders sanctum.It felt a bit strange to see him go.There were three or four English soldiers in the taproom, who eyed me speculatively, chatting to each other in low voices.After a month among the Scots of clan MacKenzie, the presence of English dragoons made me unaccountably nervous.I told myself I was being silly.After all, they were my own countrymen, out of time or not.Still, I found myself missing the congenial company of Mr.Gowan and the pleasant familiarity of Jamie whatever his name was.I was feeling rather sorry that I had had no chance to bid farewell to anyone before leaving that morning, when I heard Dougals voice calling from the stair behind me.He was standing at the top, beckoning me upward.He looked somewhat more grim than usual, I thought, as he stood aside without speaking and gestured me into the room.The garrison commander stood by the open window, his slim, straight figure silhouetted by the light.He gave a short laugh when he saw me.Yes, I thought so.It had to be you, from MacKenzies description.The door closed behind me, and I was alone with Captain Jonathan Randall of His Majestys Eighth Dragoons.He was dressed this time in a clean red and fawn uniform, with a lace trimmed stock and a neatly curled and powdered wig.But the face was the sameFranks face.My breath caught in my throat.This time, though, I noticed the small lines of ruthlessness around his mouth, and the touch of arrogance in the set of his shoulders.Still, he smiled affably enough, and invited me to sit down.The room was plainly furnished, with no more than a desk and chair, a long deal table, and a few stools.Captain Randall motioned to a young corporal who stood to attention near the door, and a mug of ale was clumsily poured and set before me.The Captain waved the corporal back and poured his own ale, then sank gracefully onto a stool across the table from me.All right, he said pleasantly.Why dont you tell me who you are, and how you come to find yourself here?Having little choice at this point, I told him the same story I had given Colum, omitting only the less tactful references to his own behavior, which he knew about in any case.I had no idea how much Dougal had told him, and didnt wish to risk being tripped up.The captain appeared polite but skeptical throughout my recital.He took less trouble to hide it than Colum had, I reflected.He rocked back on his stool, considering.Oxfordshire, you say?There are no Beauchamps in Oxfordshire that I know of.How would you know?I snapped.Youre from Sussex yourself.His eyes popped open in surprise.I could have bitten my tongue.And may I ask just how you know that?he asked.Er, your voice.Yes, its your accent, I said hastily.Clearly Sussex.The graceful dark brows nearly touched the curls of his wig.Neither my tutors nor my parents would be much obliged to hear that my speech so clearly reflects my birthplace, Madam, he said dryly.They having gone to considerable trouble and expense to remedy it.But, being the expert at local speech patterns that you arehe turned to the man standing against the wallno doubt you can also identify my corporals place of origin.Corporal Hawkins, would you oblige me by reciting something?Anything at all will do, he added, seeing the confusion on the mans face.Some popular verse, perhaps?The corporal, a young man with a stupid, beefy face and broad shoulders, glanced wildly about the room seeking inspiration, then drew himself up to attention and intoned,  Buxom Meg, she washed my clothes,  And took them all away.I waited thus in sore distress,  And then I made her pay.Er, that will do, Corporal, thank you.Randall made a dismissive motion, and the corporal subsided against the wall, sweating freely.Well?Randall turned to me, questioning.Er, Cheshire, I guessed.Close.Lancashire.He eyed me narrowly.Putting his hands together behind his back, he strolled over to the window and peered out.Checking to see whether Dougal had brought any men with him?I wondered.Suddenly he whirled back to me with an abrupt Parlez vous franais?Trs bien, I promptly replied.What of it?Head to one side, he looked me over carefully.Damme if I think youre French, he said, as though to himself.Could be, I suppose, but Ive yet to meet a Frenchie could tell a Cockney from a Cornishman.His neatly manicured fingers tapped the wood of the tabletop.What was your maiden name, Mrs.Beauchamp?Look, Captain, I said, smiling as charmingly as I could, entertaining as it is to play Twenty Questions with you, I should really like to conclude these preliminaries and arrange for the continuation of my journey.Ive already been delayed for some time, and  You do not help your case by adopting this frivolous attitude, Madam, he interrupted, narrowing his eyes.I had seen Frank do that when displeased about something, and I felt a little weak in the knees.I put my hands on my thighs to brace myself.I have no case to help, I said, as boldly as I could.Im making no claims on you, the garrison, or for that matter, on the MacKenzies.All I want is to be allowed to resume my journey in peace.And I see no reason why you ought to have any objection to that.He glared at me, lips pressed tight together in irritation.Oh, you dont?Well, consider my position for a moment, Madam, and perhaps my objections will become clearer.A month ago I was, with my men, in hot pursuit of a band of unidentified Scottish bandits who had absconded with a small herd of cattle from an estate near the border, when  Oh, so thats what they were doing!I exclaimed.I wondered, I added lamely.Captain Randall breathed heavily, then decided against whatever he had been going to say, in favor of continuing his story.In the midst of this lawful pursuit, he went on, in measured tones, I encounter a half dressed Englishwomanin a place where no Englishwoman should be, even with a proper escortwho resists my inquiries, assaults my person  You assaulted mine first!I said hotly.Whose accomplice renders me unconscious by a cowardly attack, and who then flees the area, plainly with some assistance.My men and I searched that area most thoroughly, and I assure you, Madam, there was no trace of your murdered servant, your plundered baggage, your discarded gown, nor the merest sign that there is the slightest truth to your story!Oh?I said, a little weakly.Yes.Furthermore, there have been no reports of bandits in that area within the last four months.And now, Madam, you turn up in company with the war chieftain of clan MacKenzie, who tells me that his brother Colum is convinced you are a spy, presumably working for me!Well, Im not, am I?I said, reasonably.You know that, at least.Yes, I know that, he said with exaggerated patience.What I dont know is who the devil you are!But I mean to find out, Madam, have no doubts as to that.I am the commander of this garrison.As such, I am empowered to take certain steps in order to secure the safety of this area against traitors, spies, and any other persons whose behavior I consider suspicious.And those steps, Madam, I am fully prepared to take.And just what might those steps be?I inquired.I honestly wanted to know, though I suppose the tone of my question must have sounded rather baiting.He stood up, looked down at me consideringly for a moment, then walked around the table, extended his hand, and drew me to my feet.Corporal Hawkins, he said, still staring at me, I shall require your assistance for a moment.The youth by the wall looked profoundly uneasy, but sidled over to us.Stand behind the lady, please, Corporal, Randall said, sounding bored.And take her firmly by both elbows.He drew back his arm and hit me in the pit of the stomach.I made no noise, because I had no breath.I sat on the floor, doubled over, struggling to draw air into my lungs.I was shocked far beyond the actual pain of the blow, which was beginning to make itself felt, along with a wave of giddy sickness.In a fairly eventful life, no one had ever purposely struck me before.The Captain squatted down in front of me.His wig was slightly awry, but aside from that and a certain brightness to his eyes, he showed no change from his normal controlled elegance.I trust you are not with child, Madam, he said in a conversational tone, because if you are, you wont be for long.I was beginning to make a rather odd wheezing noise, as the first wisps of oxygen found their way painfully into my throat.I rolled onto my hands and knees and groped feebly for the edge of the table.The corporal, after a nervous glance at the captain, reached down to help me up.Waves of blackness seemed to ripple over the room.I sank onto the stool and closed my eyes.Look at me.The voice was as light and calm as though he were about to offer me tea.I opened my eyes and looked up at him through a slight fog.His hands were braced on his exquisitely tailored hips.Have you anything to say to me now, Madam?he demanded.Your wig is crooked, I said, and closed my eyes again.13    A MARRIAGE IS ANNOUNCED    I sat at a table in the taproom below, gazing into a cup of milk and fighting off waves of nausea.Dougal had taken one look at my face as I came downstairs, supported by the beefy young corporal, and strode purposefully past me, up the stairs to Randalls room.The floors and doors of the inn were stout and well constructed, but I could still hear the sound of raised voices upstairs.I raised the cup of milk, but my hands were still shaking too badly to drink it.I was gradually recovering from the physical effects of the blow, but not from the shock of it.I knew the man was not my husband, but the resemblance was so strong and my habits so ingrained, that I had been half inclined to trust him, and had spoken to him as I would have to Frank, expecting civility, if not active sympathy.To have those feelings abruptly turned inside out by his vicious attack was what was making me ill now.Ill, and frightened as well.I had seen his eyes as he crouched next to me on the floor.Something had moved in their depths, just for a moment.It was gone in a flash, but I did not want ever to see it again.The sound of a door opening above brought me out of my reverie.The thud of heavy footsteps was succeeded by the rapid appearance of Dougal, followed closely by Captain Randall.So closely indeed, that the Captain appeared to be in pursuit of the Scot, and was brought up short when Dougal, catching sight of me, halted suddenly at the foot of the stairs.With a glare over his shoulder at Captain Randall, Dougal came swiftly over to where I was seated, tossed a small coin on the table in payment, and jerked me to my feet without a word.He was hustling me out the door before I had time to do more than register the extraordinary look of speculative acquisitiveness on the face of the redcoat officer.We were mounted and moving before I had even tucked the voluminous skirts around my legs, and the material billowed around me like a settling parachute.Dougal was silent, but the horses seemed to pick up his sense of urgency; we were all but galloping by the time we hit the main road.Near a crossroads marked with a Pictish cross, Dougal abruptly reined to a halt.Dismounting, he seized the bridles of both horses and tied them loosely to a sapling.He helped me down, then abruptly disappeared into the bushes, beckoning me to follow.I followed the swing of his kilt up the hillside, ducking as the branches he pushed out of the way snapped back across the path over my head.The hillside was overgrown with oak and scrubby pine.I could hear titmice in the copse to the left, and a flock of jays calling out to each other as they fed, further on.The grass was the fresh green of early summer, clumps of sturdy growth shooting out of the rocks and furring the ground under the oaks.Nothing grew under the pines, of course; the needles lay inches thick, affording protection for the small crawling things that hid there from sunlight and predators.The sharp scents made my throat ache.I had been up such hillsides before, and smelled these same spring scents.But then the pine and grass scent had been diluted with the smell of petrol fumes from the road below and the voices of day trippers replaced those of the jays.Last time I walked such a path, the ground was littered with sandwich wrappers and cigarette butts instead of mallow blossoms and violets.Sandwich wrappers seemed a reasonable enough price to pay, I supposed, for such blessings of civilization as antibiotics and telephones, but just for the moment, I was willing to settle for the violets.I badly needed a little peace, and I felt it here.Dougal turned suddenly aside just below the crest of the hill and disappeared into a thick growth of broom.Shoving my way in after him with some difficulty, I found him seated on the flat stone edging of a small pool.A weathered block of stone stood askew behind him, with a dim and vaguely human figure etched in the stained surface.It must be a saints pool, I realized.These small shrines to one saint or another dotted the Highlands, and were often to be found in such secluded spots, though even up here, tattered remnants of fabric flapped from the branches of a rowan tree that overhung the water; pledges from visitors who petitioned the saint, for health or a safe journey, perhaps.Dougal greeted my appearance with a nod.He crossed himself, bent his head, and scooped up a double handful of water.The water had an odd dark color, and a worse smelllikely a sulfur spring, I thought.The day was hot and I was thirsty, though, so I followed Dougals example.The water was faintly bitter, but cold, and not unpalatable.I drank some, then splashed my face.The road had been dusty.I looked up, face dripping, to find him watching me with a very odd expression.Something between curiosity and calculation, I thought.Bit of a climb for a drink, isnt it?I asked lightly.There were water bottles on the horses.And I doubted that Dougal meant to petition the patron of the spring for our safe journey back to the inn.He struck me as a believer in more worldly methods.How well dye know the Captain?he asked abruptly.Less well than you, I snapped back.Ive met him once before today, and that by accident.We didnt get on.Surprisingly, the stern face lightened a bit.Well, he admitted, I canna say as I care for the man much myself.He drummed his fingers on the well coping, considering something.Hes well thought of by some, though, he said, eyeing me.A brave soldier and a bonny fighter, by what I hear.I raised my eyebrows.Not being an English general, I am not impressed.He laughed, showing startlingly white teeth.The sound disturbed three rooks in the tree overhead, who flapped off, full of hoarse complaint.Are ye a spy for the English or the French?he asked, with another bewildering change of subject.At least he was being direct, for a change.Certainly not, I said crossly.Im plain Claire Beauchamp, and nothing more.I soaked my handkerchief in the water and used it to wipe my neck.Small refreshing trickles ran down my back under the grey serge of my traveling gown.I pressed the wet cloth to my bosom and squeezed, producing a similar effect.Dougal was silent for several minutes, watching me intently as I conducted my haphazard ablutions.Youve seen Jamies back, he said suddenly.I could hardly help doing so, I said a little coldly.I had given up wondering what he was up to with these disconnected questions.Presumably he would tell me when he was ready.You mean did I know Randall did it, then?Or did you know that yourself?Aye, I kent it well enough, he answered, calmly appraising me, but I wasna aware that you did.I shrugged, implying that what I knew and what I didnt were hardly his concern.I was there, ye ken, he said, casually.Where?At Fort William.I had a bit of business there, with the garrison.The clerk there knew Jamie was some kin to me, and sent me word when they arrested him.So I went along to see could aught be done for him.Apparently you werent very successful, I said, with an edge.Dougal shrugged.Unfortunately not.Had it been the regular sergeant major in charge, I might ha saved Jamie at least the second go round, but as it was, Randall was new in command.He didna know me, and was indisposed to listen much to what I said.I thought at the time, it was only he meant to make an example of Jamie, to show everyone at the start that thered be no softness from him.He tapped the short sword he wore at his belt.Its a sound enough principle, when youre in command of men.Earn their respect before ye do aught else.And if you canna do that, earn their fear.I remembered the expression on the face of Randalls corporal, and thought I knew which route the captain had taken.Dougals deepset eyes were on my face, interested.You knew it was Randall.Did Jamie tell ye about it?A bit, I said cautiously.He must think well of ye, he said musingly.He doesna generally speak of it to anyone.I cant imagine why not, I said, provoked.I still held my breath each time we came to a new tavern or inn, until it was clear that the company had settled for an evening of drinking and gossip by the fire.Dougal smiled sardonically, clearly knowing what was in my mind.Well, it wasna necessary to tell me, was it?Since I kent it already.He swished a hand idly through the strange dark water, stirring up brimstone fumes.Id not know how it goes in Oxfordshire, he said, with a sarcastic emphasis that made me squirm slightly, but hereabouts, ladies are generally not exposed to such sights as floggings.Have ye ever seen one?No, nor do I much want to, I responded sharply.I can imagine what it would take to make marks like the ones on Jamies back, though.Dougal shook his head, flipping water out of the pool at a curious jay that ventured close.Now, there youre wrong, lass, and youll pardon my saying so.Imagination is all verra well, but it isna equal to the sight of a man having his back laid open.A verra nasty thingits meant to break a man, and most often it succeeds.Not with Jamie.I spoke rather more sharply than I had intended.Jamie was my patient, and to some extent, my friend as well.I had no wish to discuss his personal history with Dougal, though I would, if pressed, admit to a certain morbid curiosity.I had never met anyone more open and at the same time more mysterious than the tall young MacTavish.Dougal laughed shortly and wiped his wet hand through his hair, pasting back the strands that had escaped during our flightfor so I thought of itfrom the tavern.Weel, Jamies as stubborn as the rest of his familylike rocks, the lot of them, and hes the worst.But there was a definite tone of respect in his voice, grudging though it was.Jamie told ye he was flogged for escape?Yes.Aye, he went over the wall of the camp just after dark, same day as the dragoons brought him in.That was a fairly frequent occurrence there, the prisoners accommodations not bein as secure as might be wished, so the English ran patrols near the walls every night.The garrison clerk told me Jamie put up a good fight, from the look of him when he came back, but it was six against one, and the six all wi muskets, so it didna last long.Jamie spent the night in chains, and went to the whipping post first thing in the morning.He paused, checking me for signs of faintness or nausea, I supposed.Floggings were done right after assembly, so as to start everyone off in the proper frame of mind for the day.There were three to be flogged that day, and Jamie was the last of them.You actually saw it?Oh, aye.And Ill tell ye, lass, watchin men bein flogged is not pleasant.Ive had the good fortune never to experience it, but I expect bein flogged is not verra pleasant, either.Watching it happen to someone else while waitin for it yourself is probably least pleasant of all.I dont doubt it, I murmured.Dougal nodded.Jamie looked grim enough, but he didna turn a hair, even listening to the screams and the other noisesdid ye know ye can hear the flesh being torn?Ugh!So I thought myself, lass, he said, grimacing in memory of it.To say nothing of the blood and bruises.Ech!He spat, carefully avoiding the pool and its coping.Turned my stomach to see, and Im no a squeamish man by any means.Dougal went on with his ghastly story.Come Jamies turn, he walks up to the postsome men have to be dragged, but not himand holds out his hands so the corporal can unlock the manacles hes wearing.The corporal goes to pull his arm, like, to haul him into place, but Jamie shakes him off and steps back a pace.I was half expectin him to make a dash for it, but instead he just pulls off his shirt.Its torn here and there and filthy as a clout, but he folds it up careful like it was his Sunday best, and lays it on the ground.Then he walks over to the post steady as a soldier and puts his hands up to be bound.Dougal shook his head, marveling.The sunlight filtering through the rowan leaves dappled him with lacy shadows, so he looked like a man seen through a doily.I smiled at the thought, and he nodded approvingly at me, thinking my response due to his story.Aye, lass, courage like that is uncommon rare.It wasna ignorance, mind; hed just seen two men flogged and he knew the same was coming to him.Its just he had made up his mind there was no help for it.Boldness in battle is nothing out of the way for a Scotsman, ye ken, but to face down fear in cold blood is rare in any man.He was but nineteen at the time, Dougal added as an afterthought.Must have been rather gruesome to watch, I said ironically.I wonder you werent sick.Dougal saw the irony, and let it lie.I nearly was, lass, he said, lifting his dark brows.The first lash drew blood, and the lads back was half red and half blue within a minute.He didna scream, though, or beg for mercy, or twist round to try and save himself.He just set his forehead hard against the post and stood there.He flinched when the lash hit, of course, but nothin more.I doubt I could do that, he admitted, nor are there many that could.He fainted half through it, and they roused him wi water from a jug and finished it.Very nasty indeed, I observed.Why are you telling me about it?I havena finished telling ye about it.Dougal pulled the dirk from his belt and began to clean his fingernails with the point.He was a fastidious man, in spite of the difficulties of keeping clean on the road.Jamie was slumped in the ropes, with the blood running down and staining his kilt.I dinna think hed fainted, he was just too wambly to stand for the moment.But just then Captain Randall came down into the yard.I dont know why hed not been there to begin with; had business that delayed him, perhaps.Anyway, Jamie saw him coming, and had the presence o mind left to close his eyes and let his head flop, like as if he were unconscious.Dougal knitted his brows, concentrating fiercely on a recalcitrant hangnail.The Captain was fair put out that theyd flogged Jamie already; seems that was a pleasure hed meant to have for himself.Still, not much to be done about it at the moment.But then he thought to make inquiries about how Jamie came to escape in the first place.He held up the dirk, examining it for nicks, then began to sharpen the edge against the stone he sat on.Had several soldiers shaking in their boots before he was donethe mans a way wi words, Ill say that for him.That he has, I said dryly.The dirk scraped rhythmically against the stone.Every so often, a faint spark leapt from the metal as it struck a rough patch in the rock.Weel, in the course of this inquiry, it came out that Jamied had the heel of a loaf and a bit of cheese with him when they caught himtaken it along when he went over the wall.Whereupon the Captain thinks for a moment, then smiles a smile I should hate to see on my grandmothers face.He declares that theft bein a serious offense, the penalty should be commensurate, and sentences Jamie on the spot to another hundred lashes.I flinched in spite of myself.That would kill him!Dougal nodded.Aye, thats what the garrison doctor said.He said as hed permit no such thing; in good conscience, the prisoner must be allowed a week to heal before receiving the second flogging.Well, how humanitarian of him, I said.Good conscience, my aunt Fanny!And what did Captain Randall think of this?He was none too pleased at first, but he reconciled himself.Once he did, the sergeant major, who knew a real faint when he saw one, had Jamie untied.The lad staggered a bit, but he kept to his feet, and a few of the men there cheered, which didna go ower a treat wi the Captain.He wasna best pleased when the sergeant picked up Jamies shirt and handed it back to the lad, either, though it was quite a popular move with the men.Dougal twisted the blade back and forth, examining it critically.Then he laid it across his knee and gave me a direct look.Ye know, lass, its fairly easy to be brave, sittin in a warm tavern ower a glass of ale.Tis not so easy, squatting in a cold field, wi musket balls going past your head and heather ticklin your arse.And its still less easy when youre standing face to face wi your enemy, wi your own blood running down your legs.I wouldnt suppose so, I said.I did feel a little faint, in spite of everything.I plunged both hands into the water, letting the dark liquid chill my wrists.I did go back to see Randall, later in the week, Dougal said defensively, as though he felt some need to justify the action.We talked a good bit, and I even offered him compensation  Oh, I am impressed, I murmured, but desisted in the face of his glare.No, I mean it.It was kind of you.I gather Randall declined your offer, though?Aye, he did.And I still dinna ken why, for Ive not found English officers on the whole to be ower scrupulous when it comes to their purses, and clothes such as the Captains come a bit dear.Perhaps he has other sources of income, I suggested.He does, for a fact, Dougal confirmed, but with a sharp glance at me.Still he hesitated, then proceeded, more slowly.I went back, then, to be there for Jamie when he came up again, though there wasna much I could do for him at that point, poor lad.The second time, Jamie had been the only prisoner up for flogging.The guards had removed his shirt before bringing him out, just after sunup on a cold October morning.I could see the lad was dead scairt, said Dougal, though he was walking by himself and wouldna let the guard touch him.I could see him shaking, as much wi the cold as wi nerves, and the gooseflesh thick on his arms and chest, but the sweat was standing on his face as well.A few minutes later, Randall came out, the whip tucked under his arm, and the lead plummets at the tips of the lashes clicking softly together as he walked.He had surveyed Jamie coolly, then motioned to the sergeant major to turn the prisoner around to show his back.Dougal grimaced.A pitiful sight, it was, toostill raw, no more than half healed, wi the weals turned black and the rest yellow wi bruises.The thought of a whip comin down on that soreness was enough to make me blench, along wi most of those watching.Randall then turned to the sergeant major and said, A pretty job, Sergeant Wilkes.I must see if I can do as well.With considerable punctilio, he then called for the garrison doctor, and had him certify officially that Jamie was fit enough to be flogged.Youve seen a cat play wi a wee mousie?Dougal asked.Twas like that.Randall strolled round the lad, making one kind of remark and another, none of them what yed call pleasant.And Jamie stood there like an oak tree, sayin nothing and keeping his eyes fixed on the post, not lookin at Randall at all.I could see the lad was hugging his elbows to try to stop the shivering, and ye could tell Randall saw it too.His mouth tightened up and he says, I thought this was the young man who only a week past was shouting that he wasnt afraid to die.Surely a man whos not afraid to die isnt afraid of a few lashes?and he gives Jamie a poke in the belly wi the handle of the whip.Jamie met Randalls eye straight on then, and said, No, but Im afraid Ill freeze stiff before yere done talking.Dougal sighed.Well.It was a braw speech, but damn reckless, for a that.Now, scourging a man is never a pretty business, but theres ways to make it worse than it might be; strikin sideways to cut deep, or steppin in wi a hard blow ower the kidneys, for instance.He shook his head.Verra ugly.He frowned, choosing his words slowly.Randalls face wasintent, I suppose yed sayand sort o lighted up, like when a man is lookin at a lass hes soft on, if ye know what I mean.Twas as though he were doin somethin much worse to Jamie than just skinning him alive.The blood was running down the lads legs by the fifteenth stroke, and the tears running down his face wi the sweat.I swayed a little, and put out a hand to the stone of the coping.Well, he said abruptly, catching sight of my expression, Ill say no more except that he lived through it.When the corporal untied his hands, he nearly fell, but the corporal and sergeant major each caught him by an arm and kind o steadied him til he could keep his feet.He was shakin worse than ever from shock and cold, but his head was up and his eyes blazinI could see it from twenty feet away.He keeps his eyes fixed on Randall while they help him off the platform, leavin bloody footprintsits like watchin Randall is the only thing keeping him on his feet.Randalls face was almost as white as Jamies, and his eyes were locked wi the ladsas though either of them would fall if he took his eyes away.Dougals own eyes were fixed, still seeing the eerie scene.Everything was quiet in the small glade except for the faint rush of wind through the leaves of the rowan tree.I closed my eyes and listened to it for some time.Why?I asked finally, eyes still closed.Why did you tell me?Dougal was watching me intently when I opened my eyes.I dipped a hand in the spring again, and applied the cool water to my temples.I thought it might serve as what ye may call a character illustration, he said.Of Randall?I uttered a short, mirthless laugh.I dont need any further evidence as to his character, thank you.Of Randall, he agreed, and Jamie too.I looked at him, suddenly ill at ease.Ye see, I have orders, he emphasized the word sarcastically, from the good captain.Orders to do what?I asked, the agitated feeling increasing.To produce the person of an English subject, one Claire Beauchamp by name, at Fort William on Monday, the 18th of June.For questioning.I must have looked truly alarming, for he jumped to his feet and came over to me.Put your head between your knees, lass, he instructed, pushing on the back of my neck,  til the faintness passes off.I know what to do, I said irritably, doing it nonetheless.I closed my eyes, feeling the ebbing blood begin to throb in my temples again.The clammy sensation around my face and ears began to disappear, though my hands were still icy.I concentrated on breathing properly, counting in  one two three four, out one two, in  one two three four.At length I sat up, feeling more or less in possession of all my faculties.Dougal had resumed his seat on the stone coping, and was waiting patiently, watching to be sure that I didnt fall backward into the spring.Theres a way out of it, he said abruptly.The only one I can see.Lead me to it, I said, with an unconvincing attempt at a smile.Verra well, then.He sat forward, leaning toward me to explain.Randalls the right to take ye for questioning because youre a subject of the English crown.Well, then, we must change that.I stared at him, uncomprehending.What do you mean?Youre a subject of the crown as well, arent you?How would you change such a thing?Scots law and English law are verra similar, he said, frowning, but no the same.And an English officer canna compel the person of a Scot, unless hes firm evidence of a crime committed, or grounds for serious suspicions.Even with suspicion, he could no remove a Scottish subject from clan lands without the permission of the laird concerned.Youve been talking to Ned Gowan, I said, beginning to feel a little dizzy again.He nodded.Aye, I have.I thought it might come to this, ye ken.And what he told me is what I thought myself; the only way I can legally refuse to give ye to Randall is to change ye from an Englishwoman into a Scot.Into a Scot?I said, the dazed feeling quickly being replaced by a horrible suspicion.This was confirmed by his next words.Aye, he said, nodding at my expression.Ye must marry a Scot.Young Jamie.I couldnt do that!Weel, he frowned, considering.I suppose ye could take Rupert, instead.Hes a widower, and hes the lease of a small farm.Still, hes a good bit older, and  I dont want to marry Rupert, either!Thats thethe most absurd Words failed me.Springing to my feet in agitation, I paced around the small clearing, fallen rowan berries crunching under my feet.Jamies a goodly lad, Dougal argued, still sitting on the coping.Hes not much in the way of property just now, true, but hes a kind hearted lad.Hed not be cruel to ye.And hes a bonny fighter, with verra good reason to hate Randall.Nay, marry him, and hell fight to his last breath to protect ye.Butbut I cant marry anyone!I burst out.Dougals eyes were suddenly sharp.Why not, lass?Do ye have a husband living still?No.Its justits ridiculous!Such things dont happen!Dougal had relaxed when I said No.Now he glanced up at the sun and rose to go.Best get moving, lass.There are things well have to attend to.Therell have to be a special dispensation, he murmured, as though to himself.But Ned can manage that.He took my arm, still muttering to himself.I wrenched it away.I will not marry anyone, I said firmly.He seemed undisturbed by this, merely raising his brows.You want me to take you to Randall?No!Something occurred to me.So at least you believe me when I say Im not an English spy?I do now.He spoke with some emphasis.Why now and not before?He nodded at the spring, and at the worn figure etched in the rock.It must be hundreds of years old, much older even than the giant rowan tree that shaded the spring and cast its white flowers into the black water.St.Ninians spring.Ye drank the water before I asked ye.I was thoroughly bewildered by this time.What does that have to do with it?He looked surprised, then his mouth twisted in a smile.Ye didna know?They call it the liars spring, as well.The water smells o the fumes of hell.Anyone who drinks the water and then tells untruth will ha the gizzard burnt out of him.I see.I spoke between my teeth.Well, my gizzard is quite intact.So you can believe me when I say Im not a spy, English or French.And you can believe something else, Dougal MacKenzie.Im not marrying anyone!He wasnt listening.In fact, he had already pushed his way through the bushes that screened the spring.Only a quivering oak branch marked his passage.Seething, I followed him.* * *    I remonstrated at some length further on the ride back to the inn.Dougal advised me finally to save my breath to cool my parritch with, and after that we rode in silence.Reaching the inn, I flung my reins to the ground and stamped upstairs to the refuge of my room.The whole idea was not only outrageous, but unthinkable.I paced around and around the narrow room, feeling increasingly like a rat in a trap.Why in hell hadnt I had the nerve to steal away from the Scots earlier, whatever the risk?I sat down on the bed and tried to think calmly.Considered strictly from Dougals point of view, no doubt the idea had merit.If he refused point blank to hand me over to Randall, with no excuse, the Captain might easily try to take me by force.And whether he believed me or not, Dougal might understandably not want to engage in a skirmish with a lot of English dragoons for my sake.And, viewed in cold blood, the idea had some merit from my side as well.If I were married to a Scot, I would presumably no longer be watched and guarded.It would be that much easier to get away when the time came.And if it were Jamiewell, he liked me, clearly.And he knew the Highlands like the backs of his hands.He would perhaps take me to Craigh na Dun, or at least in the general direction.Yes, possibly marriage was the best way to gain my goal.That was the cold blooded way to look at it.My blood, however, was anything but cold.I was hot with fury and agitation, and could not keep still, pacing and fuming, looking for a way out.Any way.After an hour of this, my face was flushed and my head throbbing.I got up and threw open the shutters, sticking my head out into the cooling breeze.There was a peremptory rap on the door behind me.Dougal entered as I pulled my head in.He bore a sheaf of stiff paper like a salver and was followed by Rupert and the immaculate Ned Gowan, bringing up the rear like royal equerries.Please do come in, I said courteously.Ignoring me as usual, Dougal removed a chamber pot from its resting place on the table and fanned the sheets of paper out ceremoniously on the rough oak surface.All done, he said, with the pride of one who has shepherded a difficult project to a successful conclusion.Neds drawn up the papers; nothing like a lawyerso long as hes on your side, eh, Ned?The men all laughed, evidently in good humor.Not really difficult, ye ken, Ned said modestly.Its but a simple contract.He riffled the pages with a proprietary forefinger, then paused, wrinkling his brow at a sudden thought.Youve no property in France, have ye?he asked, peering worriedly at me over the half spectacles he wore for close work.I shook my head, and he relaxed, shuffling the papers back into a pile and tapping the edges neatly together.Thats that, then.Youll only need to sign here at the foot, and Dougal and Rupert to witness.The lawyer set down the inkpot he had brought in, and whipping a clean quill from his pocket, presented it ceremoniously to me.And just what is this?I asked.This was in the nature of a rhetorical question, for the top page of the bundle said CONTRACT OF MARRIAGE in a clear calligraphic hand, the letters two inches high and starkly black across the page.Dougal suppressed a sigh of impatience at my recalcitrance.Ye ken quite weel what it is, he said shortly.And unless youve had another bright thought for keeping yourself out of Randalls hands, youll sign it and have done with it.Times short.Bright thoughts were in particularly short supply at the moment, despite the hour I had spent hammering away at the problem.It really began to seem that this incredible alternative was the best I could do, struggle as I might.But I dont want to marry!I said stubbornly.It occurred to me as well that mine was not the only point of view involved.I remembered the girl with blond hair I had seen kissing Jamie in the alcove at the castle.And maybe Jamie doesnt want to marry me!I said.What about that?Dougal dismissed this as unimportant.Jamies a soldier; hell do as hes told.So will you, he said pointedly, unless, of course, yed prefer an English prison.I glared at him, breathing heavily.I had been in a stir ever since our abrupt removal from Randalls office, and my level of agitation had now increased substantially, confronted with the choice in black and white, as it were.I want to talk to him, I said abruptly.Dougals eyebrows shot up.Jamie?Why?Why?Because youre forcing me to marry him, and so far as I can see, you havent even told him!Plainly this was an irrelevancy, as far as Dougal was concerned, but he eventually gave in and, accompanied by his minions, went to fetch Jamie from the taproom below.Jamie appeared shortly, looking understandably bewildered.Did you know that Dougal wants us to marry?I demanded bluntly.His expression cleared.Oh, aye.I knew that.But surely, I said, a young man like yourself; I mean, isnt there anyone else youre, ah, interested in?He looked blank for a moment, then understanding dawned.Oh, am I promised?Nay, Im no much of a prospect for a girl.He hurried on, as though feeling this might sound insulting.I mean, Ive no property to speak of, and nothing more than a soldiers pay to live on.He rubbed his chin, eyeing me dubiously.Then theres the minor difficulty that Ive a price on my head.No father much wants his daughter married to a man as may be arrested and hanged any time.Did ye think of that?I flapped my hand, dismissing the matter of outlawry as a minor consideration, compared to the whole monstrous idea.I had one last try.Does it bother you that Im not a virgin?He hesitated a moment before answering.Well, no, he said slowly, so long as it doesna bother you that I am.He grinned at my drop jawed expression, and backed toward the door.Reckon one of us should know what theyre doing, he said.The door closed softly behind him; clearly the courtship was over.* * *    The papers duly signed, I made my way cautiously down the inns steep stairs and over to the bar table in the taproom.Whisky, I said to the rumpled old creature behind it.He glared rheumily, but a nod from Dougal made him oblige with a bottle and glass.The latter was thick and greenish, a bit smeared, with a chip out of the rim, but it had a hole in the top, and that was all that mattered at the moment.Once the searing effect of swallowing the stuff had passed, it did induce a certain spurious calmness.I felt detached, noticing details of my surroundings with a peculiar intensity: the small stained glass inset over the bar, casting colored shadows over the ruffianly proprietor and his wares, the curve of the handle on a copper bottomed dipper that hung on the wall next to me, a greenbellied fly struggling on the edges of a sticky puddle on the table.With a certain amount of fellow feeling, I nudged it out of danger with the edge of my glass.I gradually became aware of raised voices behind the closed door on the far side of the room.Dougal had disappeared there after the conclusion of his business with me, presumably to firm up arrangements with the other contracting party.I was pleased to hear that, judging from the sound of it, my intended bridegroom was cutting up rough, despite his apparent lack of objection earlier.Perhaps he hadnt wanted to offend me.Stick to it, lad, I murmured, and took another gulp.Sometime later, I was dimly conscious of a hand prying my fingers open in order to remove the greenish glass.Another hand was steadyingly under my elbow.Christ, shes drunk as an auld besom in a bothy, said a voice in my ear.The voice rasped unpleasantly, I thought, as though its owner had been eating sandpaper.I giggled softly at the thought.Quiet yerself, woman!said the unpleasant rasping voice.It grew fainter as the owner turned to talk to someone else.Drunk as a laird and screechin like a parrotwhat do ye expect  Another voice interrupted the first, but I couldnt tell what it said; the words were blurred and indistinguishable.It was a pleasanter sound, though, deep and somehow reassuring.It came nearer, and I could make out a few words.I made an effort to focus, but my attention had begun to wander again.The fly had found its way back to the puddle, and was floundering in the middle, hopelessly mired.The light from the stained glass window fell on it, glittering like sparks on the straining green belly.My gaze fixed on the tiny green spot, which seemed to pulsate as the fly twitched and struggled.Brotheryou havent a shance, I said, and the spark went out.14    A MARRIAGE TAKES PLACE    There was a low, beamed ceiling over me when I woke, and a thick quilt tucked tidily under my chin.I seemed to be clad only in my shift.I started to sit up to look for my clothes, but thought better of it halfway up.I eased myself very carefully back down, closed my eyes and held onto my head to prevent it from rolling off the pillow and bouncing on the floor.I woke again, sometime later, when the door of the room opened.I cracked one eye cautiously.A wavering outline resolved itself into the dour figure of Murtagh, staring disapprovingly down at me from the foot of the bed.I closed the eye.I heard a muffled Scottish noise, presumably indicating appalled disgust, but when I looked again he was gone.I was just sinking thankfully back into unconsciousness when the door opened again, this time to reveal a middle aged woman I took to be the publicans wife, carrying a ewer and basin.She bustled cheerily into the room and banged the shutters open with a crash that reverberated through my head like a tank collision.Advancing on the bed like a Panzer division, she ripped the quilt from my feeble grasp and tossed it aside, leaving me quaking and exposed.Come along then, me love, she said.We mun get ye ready now.She put a hefty forearm behind my shoulders and levered me into a sitting position.I clutched my head with one hand, my stomach with the other.Ready?I said, through a mouth filled with decayed moss.The woman began briskly washing my face.Och, aye, she said.Ye dinna want to miss yer own wedding, now, do ye?Yes, I said, but was ignored as she unceremoniously stripped off my shift and stood me in the middle of the floor for further intimate attentions.A bit later I sat on the bed, fully dressed, feeling dazed and belligerent, but thanks to a glass of port supplied by the goodwife, at least functional.I sipped carefully at a second glass, as the woman tugged a comb through the thickets of my hair.I jumped and shuddered, spilling the port, as the door crashed open once more.One damn thing after another, I thought balefully.This time it was a double visitation, Murtagh and Ned Gowan, wearing similar looks of disapprobation.I exchanged glares with Ned while Murtagh came into the room and walked slowly around the bed, surveying me from every angle.He returned to Ned and muttered something in a tone too low for me to hear.With a final glance of despair in my direction, he pulled the door shut behind them.At last my hair was dressed to the womans satisfaction, swept back and pulled high in a knot at the crown, curls picked loose to tumble to the back, and ringlets in front of my ears.It felt as though my scalp were going to pop off from the tension of the strained back hair, but the effect in the looking glass the woman provided was undeniably becoming.I began to feel slightly more human, and even brought myself to thank her for her efforts.She left me the looking glass, and departed, remarking that it was so lucky to be married in summer, wasnt it, as Id have plenty of flowers for my hair.We who are about to die, I said to my reflection, sketching a salute in the glass.I collapsed on the bed, plastered a wet cloth over my face, and went back to sleep.I was having a rather nice dream, something to do with grassy fields and wildflowers, when I became aware that what I had thought a playful breeze tugging at my sleeves was a pair of none too gentle hands.I sat up with a jerk, blindly flailing.When I got my eyes open, I saw that my small chamber now resembled a Tube station, with faces wall to wall: Ned Gowan, Murtagh, the innkeeper, the innkeepers wife, and a lanky young man, who turned out to be the innkeepers son, with his arms full of assorted flowers, which accounted for the scents in my dream.There was also a young woman, armed with a round wicker basket, who smiled amiably at me, displaying the lack of several rather important teeth.This person, it developed, was the village sempstress, recruited to repair the deficiencies of my wardrobe by adjusting the fit of a dress, obtained on short notice from some local connection of the innkeepers.Ned was carrying the dress in question, hanging from one hand like a dead animal.Smoothed out on the bed, it proved to be a low necked gown of heavy cream colored satin, with a separate bodice that buttoned with dozens of tiny cloth covered buttons, each embroidered with a gold fleur de lis.The neckline and the belled sleeves were heavily ruched with lace, as was the embroidered overskirt of chocolate brown velvet.The innkeeper was half buried in the petticoats he carried, his bristling whiskers barely visible over the foamy layers.I looked at the port wine stain on my grey serge skirt and vanity won out.If I were in fact to be married, I didnt want to do it looking like the village drudge.After a short spell of frenetic activity, with me standing like a dressmakers dummy and everyone else racing about fetching, carrying, criticizing, and tripping over each other, the final product was ready, complete to white asters and yellow roses pinned in my hair and a heart pounding madly away beneath the lacy bodice.The fit was not quite perfect, and the gown smelled rather strongly of its previous owner, but the satin was weighty and swished rather fascinatingly about my feet, over the layers of petticoats.I felt quite regal, and not a little lovely.You cant make me do this, you know, I hissed threateningly at Murtaghs back as I followed him downstairs, but he and I both knew my words were empty bravado.If I had ever had the strength of character to defy Dougal and take my chances with the English, it had drained away with the whisky.Dougal, Ned, and the rest were in the main taproom at the foot of the stair, drinking and exchanging pleasantries with a few villagers who seemed to have nothing better to do with their afternoon than hang about getting sloshed.Dougal caught sight of me slowly descending, and abruptly stopped talking.The others fell silent as well, and I floated down in a most gratifying cloud of reverent admiration.Dougals deepset eyes covered me slowly from head to foot and returned to my face with a completely ungrudging nod of acknowledgment.What with one thing and another, it was some time since a man had looked at me that way, and I nodded quite graciously back.After the first silence, the rest of those in the taproom became vocal in their admiration, and even Murtagh allowed himself a small smile, nodding in satisfaction at the results of his efforts.And who appointed you fashion editor?I thought disagreeably.Still, I had to admit that he was responsible for my not marrying in grey serge.Marrying.Oh, God.Buoyed temporarily by port wine and cream lace, I had momentarily managed to ignore the significance of the occasion.I gripped the banister as fresh realization hit like a blow in the stomach.Looking over the throng, though, I noticed one glaring omission.My groom was nowhere in sight.Heartened by the thought that he might have succeeded in escaping out of a window, and be miles away by now, I accepted a parting cup of wine from the innkeeper before following Dougal outside.Ned and Rupert went to fetch the horses.Murtagh had disappeared somewhere, perhaps to search for traces of Jamie.Dougal held me by one arm; ostensibly to support me lest I stumble in my satin slippers, in reality to prevent any last minute breaks for freedom.It was a warm Scottish day, meaning that the mist wasnt quite heavy enough to qualify as a drizzle, but not far off, either.Suddenly the inn door opened, and the sun came out, in the person of James.If I was a radiant bride, the groom was positively resplendent.My mouth fell open and stayed that way.A Highlander in full regalia is an impressive sightany Highlander, no matter how old, ill favored, or crabbed in appearance.A tall, straight bodied, and by no means ill favored young Highlander at close range is breath taking.The thick red gold hair had been brushed to a smooth gleam that swept the collar of a fine lawn shirt with tucked front, belled sleeves, and lace trimmed wrist frills that matched the cascade of the starched jabot at the throat, decorated with a ruby stickpin.His tartan was a brilliant crimson and black that blazed among the more sedate MacKenzies in their green and white.The flaming wool, fastened by a circular silver brooch, fell from his right shoulder in a graceful drape, caught by a silver studded sword belt before continuing its sweep past neat calves clothed in woolen hose and stopping just short of the silver buckled black leather boots.Sword, dirk, and badger skin sporran completed the ensemble.Well over six feet tall, broad in proportion, and striking of feature, he was a far cry from the grubby horse handler I was accustomed toand he knew it.Making a leg in courtly fashion, he swept me a bow of impeccable grace, murmuring Your servant, Maam, eyes glinting with mischief.Oh, I said faintly.I had seldom seen the taciturn Dougal at a loss for words before.Thick brows knotted over a suffused face, he seemed in his way as taken aback by this apparition as I was.Are ye mad, man?he said at last.What if someones to see ye!Jamie cocked a sardonic eyebrow at the older man.Why, uncle, he said.Insults?And on my wedding day too.You wouldna have me shame my wife, now, would ye?Besides, he added, with a malicious gleam, I hardly think it would be legal, did I not marry in my own name.And you do want it legal, now, dont you?With an apparent effort, Dougal recovered his self possession.If yere quite finished, Jamie, well get on wi it, he said.But Jamie was not quite finished, it seemed.Ignoring Dougals fuming, he drew a short string of white beads from his sporran.He stepped forward and fastened the necklace around my neck.Looking down, I could see it was a string of small baroque pearls, those irregularly shaped productions of freshwater mussels, interspersed with tiny pierced work gold roundels.Smaller pearls dangled from the gold beads.Theyre only Scotch pearls, he said, apologetically, but they look bonny on you.His fingers lingered a moment on my neck.Those were your mothers pearls!said Dougal, glowering at the necklace.Aye, said Jamie calmly, and now theyre my wifes.Shall we go?* * *    Wherever we were going, it was some distance from the village.We made a rather morose wedding party, the bridal pair encircled by the others like convicts being escorted toward some distant prison.The only conversation was a muted apology from Jamie for being late, explaining that there had been some difficulty in finding a clean shirt and coat large enough to fit him.I think this one belongs to the local squires son, he said, flipping the lacy jabot.Bit of a dandy, it looks like.We dismounted and left the horses at the foot of a small hill.A footpath led upward through the heather.Yeve made the arrangements?I heard Dougal say in an undertone to Rupert, as they tethered the beasts.Och, aye.There was a flash of teeth in the black beard.Was a bit o trouble to, persuade the padre, but we showed him the special license.He patted his sporran, which clinked musically, giving me some idea of the nature of the special license.Through the drizzle and mist, I saw the chapel jutting out of the heather.With a sense of complete disbelief, I saw the round shouldered roof and the odd little many paned windows, which I had last seen on the bright sunny morning of my marriage to Frank Randall.No!I exclaimed.Not here!I cant!Hst, now, hst.Dinna worry, lass, dinna worry.It will be all right.Dougal put a large paw on my shoulder, making soothing Scottish noises, as if I were a skittish horse.Tis natural to be a bit nervous, he said, to all of us.A firm hand in the small of my back urged me on up the path.My shoes sank moistly in the damp layer of fallen leaves.Jamie and Dougal walked close on either side of me, preventing escape.Their looming plaid presences were unnerving, and I felt a mounting sense of hysteria.Two hundred years ahead, more or less, I had been married in this chapel, charmed then by its ancient picturesqueness.The chapel now was creaking with newness, its boards not yet settled into charm, and I was about to marry a twenty three year old Scottish Catholic virgin with a price on his head, whose  I turned to Jamie in sudden panic.I cant marry you!I dont even know your last name!He looked down at me and cocked a ruddy eyebrow.Oh.Its Fraser.James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.He pronounced it formally, each name slow and distinct.Completely flustered, I said Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp, and stuck out my hand idiotically.Apparently taking this as a plea for support, he took the hand and tucked it firmly into the crook of his elbow.Thus inescapably pinioned, I squelched up the path to my wedding.Rupert and Murtagh were waiting for us in the chapel, keeping guard over a captive cleric, a spindly young priest with a red nose and a justifiably terrified expression.Rupert was idly slicing a willow twig with a large knife, and while he had laid aside his horn handled pistols on entering the church, they remained in easy reach on the rim of the baptismal font.The other men also disarmed, as was suitable in the house of God, leaving an impressively bristling pile of lethality in the back pew.Only Jamie kept his dagger and sword, presumably as a ceremonial part of his dress.We knelt before the wooden altar, Murtagh and Dougal took their places as witnesses, and the ceremony began.The form of the Catholic marriage service has not changed appreciably in several hundred years, and the words linking me with the red headed young stranger at my side were much the same as those that had consecrated my wedding to Frank.I felt like a cold, hollow shell.The young priests stammering words echoed somewhere in the empty pit of my stomach.I stood automatically when it came time for the vows, watching in a sort of numbed fascination as my chilly fingers disappeared into my bridegrooms substantial grasp.His fingers were as cold as my own, and it occurred to me for the first time that despite his outwardly cool demeanor, he might be as nervous as I was.I had so far avoided looking at him, but now glanced up to find him staring down at me.His face was white and carefully expressionless; he looked as he had when I dressed the wound in his shoulder.I tried to smile at him, but the corners of my mouth wobbled precariously.The pressure of his fingers on mine increased.I had the impression that we were holding each other up; if either of us let go or looked away, we would both fall down.Oddly, the feeling was mildly reassuring.Whatever we were in for, at least there were two of us.I take thee, Claire, to be my wife His voice didnt shake, but his hand did.I tightened my grip.Our stiff fingers clenched together like boards in a vise.to love, honor and protectfor better and for worse The words came from far away.The blood was draining from my head.The boned bodice was infernally tight, and though I felt cold, sweat ran down my sides beneath the satin.I hoped I wouldnt faint.There was a small stained glass window set high in the wall at the side of the sanctuary, a crude rendering of John the Baptist in his bearskin.Green and blue shadows flowed over my sleeve, reminding me of the taverns public room, and I wished fervently for a drink.My turn.I stuttered slightly, to my fury.I t take thee, James I stiffened my spine.Jamie had got through his half creditably enough; I could try to do as well.to have and to hold, from this day forth My voice came stronger now.Til death us do part.The words rang out in the quiet chapel with a startling finality.Everything was still, as though in suspended animation.Then the minister asked for the ring.There was a sudden stir of agitation and I caught a glimpse of Murtaghs stricken face.I barely registered the fact that someone had forgotten to provide for the ring, when Jamie released my hand long enough to twist a ring from his own finger.I still wore Franks ring on my left hand.The fingers of my right looked frozen, pallid and stiff in a pool of blue light, as the large metal circlet passed over the fourth finger.It hung loose on the digit and would have slid off, had Jamie not folded my fingers around it and enclosed my fist once more in his own.More mumbling from the priest, and Jamie bent to kiss me.It was clear that he intended only a brief and ceremonial touching of lips, but his mouth was soft and warm and I moved instinctively toward him.I was vaguely conscious of noises, Scottish whoops of enthusiasm and encouragement from the spectators, but really noticed nothing beyond the enfolding warm solidness.Sanctuary.We drew apart, both a little steadier, and smiled nervously.I saw Dougal draw Jamies dirk from its sheath and wondered why.Still looking at me, Jamie held out his right hand, palm up.I gasped as the point of the dirk scored deeply across his wrist, leaving a dark line of welling blood.There was not time to jerk away before my own hand was seized and I felt the burning slice of the blade.Swiftly, Dougal pressed my wrist to Jamies and bound the two together with a strip of white linen.I must have swayed a bit, because Jamie gripped my elbow with his free left hand.Bear up, lass, he urged softly.Its not long now.Say the words after me.It was a short bit of Gaelic, two or three sentences.The words meant nothing to me, but I obediently repeated them after Jamie, stumbling on the slippery vowels.The linen was untied, the wounds blotted clean, and we were married.There was a general air of relief and exhilaration on the way back down the footpath.It might have been any merry wedding party, albeit a small one, and one composed entirely of men, save the bride.We were nearly at the bottom when lack of food, the remnants of a hangover, and the general stresses of the day caught up with me.I came to lying on damp leaves, my head in my new husbands lap.He put down the wet cloth with which he had been wiping my face.That bad, was it?He grinned down at me, but his eyes held an uncertain expression that rather touched me, in spite of everything.I smiled shakily back.Its not you, I assured him.Its justI dont think Ive had anything at all to eat since breakfast yesterdayand rather a lot to drink, Im afraid.His mouth twitched.So I heard.Well, that I can remedy.Ive not a lot to offer a wife, as I said, but I do promise Ill keep ye fed.He smiled and shyly pushed a stray curl off my face with a forefinger.I started to sit up and grimaced at a slight burning in one wrist.I had forgotten that last bit of the ceremony.The cut had come open, no doubt as a result of the fall I had taken.I took the cloth from Jamie and wrapped it awkwardly around the wrist.I thought it might have been that that made ye faint, he said, watching.I should have thought to warn ye about it; I didna realize you werent expecting it until I saw your face.What was it, exactly?I asked, trying to tuck in the ends of the cloth.Its a bit pagan, but its customary hereabouts to have a blood vow, along with the regular marriage service.Some priests wont have it, but I dont suppose this one was likely to object to anything.He looked almost as scared as I felt, he said, smiling.A blood vow?What do the words mean?Jamie took my right hand and gently tucked in the last end of the makeshift bandage.It rhymes, more or less, when ye say it in English.It says:  Ye are Blood of my Blood, and Bone of my Bone.I give ye my Body, that we Two might be One.I give ye my Spirit, til our Life shall be Done.He shrugged.About the same as the regular vows, just a bit moreah, primitive.I gazed down at my bound wrist.Yes, you could say that.I glanced about; we were alone on the path, under an aspen tree.The round dead leaves lay on the ground, gleaming in the wet like rusted coins.It was very quiet, save for the occasional splat of water droplets falling from the trees.Where are the others?Did they go back to the inn?Jamie grimaced.No.I made them go away so I could tend ye, but theyll be waitin for us just over there.He gestured with his chin, in the countrymans manner.Theyre no going to trust us alone til everythings official.Isnt it?I said blankly.Were married, arent we?He seemed embarrassed, turning away and elaborately brushing dead leaves from his kilts.Mmmphm.Aye, were married, right enough.But its no legally binding, ye know, until its been consummated.A slow, fierce blush burned its way up from the lacy jabot.Mmmphm, I said.Lets go and find something to eat.15    REVELATIONS OF THE BRIDAL CHAMBER    At the inn, food was readily available, in the form of a modest wedding feast, including wine, fresh bread, and roast beef.Dougal took me by the arm as I started for the stairs to freshen myself before eating.I want this marriage consummated, wi no uncertainty whatsoever, Dougal instructed me firmly in an undertone.Theres to be no question of it bein a legal union, and no way open for annulment, or were all riskin our necks.Seems to me youre doing that anyway, I remarked crossly.Mine, especially.Dougal patted me firmly on the rump.Dinna ye worry about that; ye just do your part.He looked me over critically, as though judging my capacity to perform my role adequately.I kent Jamies father.If the lads much like him, yell have no trouble at all.Ah, Jamie lad!He hurried across the room, to where Jamie had come in from stabling the horses.From the look on Jamies face, he was getting his orders as well.* * *    How in the name of God did this happen?I asked myself some time later.Six weeks ago, I had been innocently collecting wildflowers on a Scottish hill to take home to my husband.I was now shut in the room of a rural inn, awaiting a completely different husband, whom I scarcely knew, with firm orders to consummate a forced marriage, at risk of my life and liberty.I sat on the bed, stiff and terrified in my borrowed finery.There was a faint noise as the heavy door of the room swung open, then shut.Jamie leaned against the door, watching me.The air of embarrassment between us deepened.It was Jamie who broke the silence finally.You dinna need to be afraid of me, he said softly.I wasna going to jump on ye.I laughed in spite of myself.Well, I didnt think you would.In fact, I didnt think he would touch me, until and unless I invited him to; the fact remained that I was going to have to invite him to do considerably more than that, and soon.I eyed him dubiously.I supposed it would be harder if I found him unattractive; in fact, the opposite was true.Still, I had not slept with any man but Frank in over eight years.Not only that, this young man, by his own acknowledgment, was completely inexperienced.I had never deflowered anyone before.Even dismissing my objections to the whole arrangement, and considering matters from a completely practical standpoint, how on earth were we to start?At this rate, we would still be standing here, staring at each other, three or four days hence.I cleared my throat and patted the bed beside me.Ah, would you like to sit down?Aye.He came across the room, moving like a big cat.Instead of sitting beside me, though, he pulled up a stool and sat down facing me.Somewhat tentatively, he reached out and took my hands between his own.They were large, blunt fingered, and very warm, the backs lightly furred with reddish hairs.I felt a slight shock at the touch, and thought of an Old Testament passageFor Jacobs skin was smooth, while his brother Esau was a hairy man.Franks hands were long and slender, nearly hairless and aristocratic looking.I had always loved watching them as he lectured.Tell me about your husband, said Jamie, as though he had been reading my mind.I almost jerked my hands away in shock.What?Look ye, lass.We have three or four days together here.While I dinna pretend to know all there is to know, Ive lived a good bit of my life on a farm, and unless people are verra different from other animals, it isna going to take that long to do what we have to.We have a bit of time to talk, and get over being scairt of each other.This blunt appraisal of our situation relaxed me a little bit.Are you scared of me?He didnt look it.Perhaps he was nervous, though.Even though he was no timid sixteen year old lad, this was the first time.He looked into my eyes and smiled.Aye.More scairt than you, I expect.Thats why Im holdin your hands; to keep my own from shaking.I didnt believe this, but squeezed his hands tightly in appreciation.Its a good idea.It feels a little easier to talk while were touching.Why did you ask about my husband, though?I wondered a bit wildly if he wanted me to tell him about my sex life with Frank, so as to know what I expected of him.Well, I knew ye must be thinking of him.Ye could hardly not, under the circumstances.I do not want ye ever to feel as though ye canna talk of him to me.Even though Im your husband nowthat feels verra strange to sayit isna right that ye should forget him, or even try to.If ye loved him, he must ha been a good man.Yes, hewas.My voice trembled, and Jamie stroked the backs of my hands with his thumbs.Then I shall do my best to honor his spirit by serving his wife.He raised my hands and kissed each one formally.I cleared my throat.That was a very gallant speech, Jamie.He grinned suddenly.Aye.I made it up while Dougal was making toasts downstairs.I took a deep breath.I have questions, I said.He looked down, hiding a smile.Id suppose ye do, he agreed.I imagine youre entitled to a bit of curiosity, under the circumstances.What is it ye want to know?He looked up suddenly, blue eyes bright with mischief in the lamplight.Why Im a virgin yet?Er, I should say that that was more or less your own business, I murmured.It seemed to be getting rather warm suddenly, and I pulled one hand free to grope for my handkerchief.As I did so, I felt something hard in the pocket of the gown.Oh, I forgot!I still have your ring.I drew it out and gave it back to him.It was a heavy gold circlet, set with a cabochon ruby.Instead of replacing it on his finger, he opened his sporran to put it inside.It was my fathers wedding ring, he explained.I dinna wear it customarily, but Iwell, I wished to do ye honor today by looking as well as I might.He flushed slightly at this admission, and busied himself with refastening the sporran.You did do me great honor, I said, smiling in spite of myself.Adding a ruby ring to the blazing splendor of his costume was coals to Newcastle, but I was touched by the anxious thought behind it.Ill get one that fits ye, so soon as I may, he promised.Its not important, I said, feeling slightly uncomfortable.I meant, after all, to be gone soon.Er, I have one main question, I said, calling the meeting to order.If you dont mind telling me.Why did you agree to marry me?Ah.He let go of my hands and sat back a bit.He paused for a moment before answering, smoothing the woolen cloth over his thighs.I could see the long line of muscle taut under the drape of the heavy fabric.Well, I would ha missed talking to ye, for one thing, he said, smiling.No, I mean it, I insisted.Why?He sobered then.Before I tell ye, Claire, theres the one thing Id ask of you, he said slowly.Whats that?Honesty.I must have flinched uncomfortably, for he leaned forward earnestly, hands on his knees.I know there are things yed not wish to tell me, Claire.Perhaps things that ye cant tell me.You dont know just how right you are, I thought.Ill not press you, ever, or insist on knowin things that are your own concern, he said seriously.He looked down at his hands, now pressed together, palm to palm.There are things that I canna tell you, at least not yet.And Ill ask nothing of ye that ye canna give me.But what I would ask of yewhen you do tell me something, let it be the truth.And Ill promise ye the same.We have nothing now between us, saverespect, perhaps.And I think that respect has maybe room for secrets, but not for lies.Do ye agree?He spread his hands out, palms up, inviting me.I could see the dark line of the blood vow across his wrist.I placed my own hands lightly on his palms.Yes, I agree.Ill give you honesty.His fingers closed lightly about mine.And I shall give ye the same.Now, he drew a deep breath, you asked why I wed ye.I am just the slightest bit curious, I said.He smiled, the wide mouth taking up the humor that lurked in his eyes.Well, I canna say I blame ye.I had several reasons.And in fact, theres onemaybe twothat I canna tell ye yet, though I will in time.The main reason, though, is the same reason you wed me, I imagine; to keep ye safe from the hands of Jack Randall.I shuddered a bit, at the memory of the Captain, and Jamies hands tightened on mine.You are safe, he said firmly.You have my name and my family, my clan, and if necessary, the protection of my body as well.The man willna lay hands on ye again, while I live.Thank you, I said.Looking at that strong, young, determined face, with its broad cheekbones and solid jaw, I felt for the first time that this preposterous scheme of Dougals might actually have been a reasonable suggestion.The protection of my body.The phrase struck with particular impact, looking at himthe resolute set of the wide shoulders and the memory of his graceful ferocity, showing off at swordplay in the moonlight.He meant it; and young as he was, he knew what he meant, and bore the scars to prove it.He was no older than many of the pilots and the infantrymen I had nursed, and he knew as well as they the price of commitment.It was no romantic pledge he had made me, but the blunt promise to guard my safety at the cost of his own.I hoped only that I could offer him something in return.Thats most gallant of you, I said, with absolute sincerity.But was it worth, well, worth marriage?It was, he said, nodding.He smiled again, a little grimly this time.Ive good reason to know the man, ye ken.I wouldna see a dog given into his keeping if I could prevent it, let alone a helpless woman.How flattering, I remarked wryly, and he laughed.He stood up and went to the table near the window.Someoneperhaps the landladyhad supplied a bouquet of wildflowers, set in water in a whisky tumbler.Behind this stood two wineglasses and a bottle.Jamie poured out two glasses and came back, handing me one as he resumed his seat.Not quite so good as Colums private stock, he said with a smile, but none so bad, either.He raised his glass briefly.To Mrs.Fraser, he said softly, and I felt a thump of panic again.I quelled it firmly and raised my own glass.To honesty, I said, and we both drank.Well, thats one reason, I said, lowering my glass.Are there others you can tell me?He studied his wineglass with some care.Perhaps its just that I want to bed you.He looked up abruptly.Did ye think of that?If he meant to disconcert me, he was succeeding nicely, but I resolved not to show it.Well, do you?I asked boldly.If Im bein honest, yes, I do.The blue eyes were steady over the rim of the glass.You wouldnt necessarily have had to marry me for that, I objected.He appeared honestly scandalized.You do not think I would take ye without offering you marriage!Many men would, I said, amused at his innocence.He sputtered a bit, at a momentary loss.Then regaining his composure, said with formal dignity, Perhaps I am pretentious in saying so, but I would like to think that I am not many men, and that I dinna necessarily place my behavior at the lowest common denominator.Rather touched by this speech, I assured him that I had so far found his behavior both gallant and gentlemanly, and apologized for any doubt I might inadvertently have cast on his motives.On this precariously diplomatic note, we paused while he refilled our empty glasses.* * *    We sipped in silence for a time, both feeling a bit shy after the frankness of that last exchange.So, apparently there was something I could offer him.I couldnt, in fairness, say the thought had not entered my mind, even before the absurd situation in which we found ourselves arose.He was a very engaging young man.And there had been that moment, right after my arrival at the castle, when he had held me on his lap, and  I tilted my wineglass back and drained the contents.I patted the bed beside me again.Sit down here with me, I said.AndI cast about for some neutral topic of conversation to ease us over the awkwardness of close proximityand tell me about your family.Where did you grow up?The bed sank noticeably under his weight, and I braced myself not to roll against him.He sat closely enough that the sleeve of his shirt brushed my arm.I let my hand lie open on my thigh, relaxed.He took it naturally as he sat, and we leaned against the wall, neither of us looking down, but as conscious of the link as though we had been welded together.Well, now, where shall I start?He put his rather large feet up on the stool and crossed them at the ankles.With some amusement, I recognized the Highlander settling back for a leisurely dissection of that tangle of family and clan relationships which forms the background of almost any event of significance in the Scottish Highlands.Frank and I had spent one evening in the village pub, enthralled by a conversation between two old codgers, in which the responsibility for the recent destruction of an ancient barn was traced back through the intricacies of a local feud dating, so far as I could tell, from about 1790.With the sort of minor shock to which I was becoming accustomed, I realized that that particular feud, whose origins I had thought shrouded in the mists of time, had not yet begun.Suppressing the mental turmoil this realization caused, I forced my attention to what Jamie was saying.My father was a Fraser, of course; a younger half brother to the present Master of Lovat.My mother was a MacKenzie, though.Yell know that Dougal and Colum are my uncles?I nodded.The resemblance was clear enough, despite the difference in coloring.The broad cheekbones and long, straight, knife edged nose were plainly a MacKenzie inheritance.Aye, well, my mother was their sister, and there were two more sisters, besides.My auntie Janet is dead, like my mother, but my auntie Jocasta married a cousin of Ruperts, and lives up near the edge of Loch Eilean.Auntie Janet had six children, four boys and two girls, Auntie Jocasta has three, all girls, Dougals got the four girls, Colum has little Hamish only, and my parents had me and my sister, whos named for my Auntie Janet, but we called her Jenny always.Ruperts a MacKenzie, too?I asked, already struggling to keep everyone straight.Aye.Hes Jamie paused a moment considering, hes Dougal, Colum, and Jocastas first cousin, which makes him my second cousin.Ruperts father and my grandfather Jacob were brothers, along with  Wait a minute.Dont lets go back any farther than we have to, or I shall be getting hopelessly muddled.We havent even got to the Frasers yet, and Ive already lost track of your cousins.He rubbed his chin, calculating.Hmm.Well, on the Fraser side its a bit more complicated, because my grandfather Simon married three times, so my father had two sets of half brothers and half sisters.Lets leave it for now that Ive six Fraser uncles and three aunts still living, and well leave out all the cousins from that lot.Yes, lets.I leaned forward and poured another glass of wine for each of us.The clan territories of MacKenzie and Fraser, it turned out, adjoined each other for some distance along their inner borders, running side by side from the seacoast past the lower end of Loch Ness.This shared border, as borders tend to be, was an unmapped and most uncertain line, shifting to and fro in accordance with time, custom and alliance.Along this border, at the southern end of the Fraser clan lands, lay the small estate of Broch Tuarach, the property of Brian Fraser, Jamies father.Its a fairly rich bit of ground, and theres decent fishing and a good patch of forest for hunting.It maybe supports sixty crofts, and the small villageBroch Mordha, its called.Then theres the manor house, of coursethats modern, he said, with some pride, and the old broch that we use now for the beasts and the grain.Dougal and Colum were not at all pleased to have their sister marrying a Fraser, and they insisted that she not be a tenant on Fraser land, but live on a freehold.So, Lallybrochthats what the folk that live there call itwas deeded to my father, but there was a clause in the deed stating that the land was to pass to my mother, Ellens, issue only.If she died without children, the land would go back to Lord Lovat after my fathers death, whether Father had children by another wife or no.But he didnt remarry, and I am my mothers son.So Lallybrochs mine, for what thats worth.I thought you were telling me yesterday that you didnt have any property.I sipped the wine, finding it rather good; it seemed to be getting better, the more I drank of it.I thought perhaps I had better stop soon.Jamie wagged his head from side to side.Well, it belongs to me, right enough.The thing is, though, it doesna do me much good at present, as I cant go there.He looked apologetic.Theres the minor matter of the price on my head, ye see.After his escape from Fort William, he had been taken to Dougals house, Beannachd (means Blessed, he explained), to recover from his wounds and the consequent fever.From there, he had gone to France, where he had spent two years fighting with the French army, around the Spanish border.
