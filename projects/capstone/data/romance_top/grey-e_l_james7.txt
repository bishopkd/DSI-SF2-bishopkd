With her other hand she ruffles my hair, running her fingers through it.Ah, I moan, and I dont know if its from fear or longing.Im breathless, standing on a precipice.When I open my eyes, she steps forward so her body is flush against mine.She fists both hands in my hair and tugs gently, raising her lips to mine.And Im watching her do this, like a bystander, not present in my body.Im a spectator.Our lips touch and I close my eyes as she forces her tongue into my mouth.And its the sound of my groan that breaks the spell shes cast.Ana.I wrap my arms around her, kissing her back, releasing two hours of anxiety and tension into our kiss, my tongue possessing her, reconnecting with her.My hands grip her hair and I savor her taste, her tongue, her frame against mine as my body ignites like gasoline.Fuck.When I pull away were both dragging air into our lungs, her hands clutching my arms.Im confused.I wanted to spank her.But shes said no.Like she did at the dinner table.What are you doing to me?I ask.Kissing you.You said no.What?Shes bewildered, or maybe shes forgotten what happened.At the dinner table, with your legs.But we were at your parents dining table.No ones ever said no to me before.And its sohot.And different.I slide my hand around her backside and jolt her against me, trying to regain control.Youre mad and turned on because I said no?Her voice is throaty.Im mad because you never mentioned Georgia to me.Im mad because you went drinking with that guy who tried to seduce you when you were drunk, and who left you when you were ill with an almost complete stranger.What kind of friend does that?And Im mad and aroused because you closed your legs on me.And youre not wearing panties.My fingers inch her dress up her legs.I want you, and I want you now.And if youre not going to let me spank youwhich you deserveIm going to fuck you on the couch, this minute, quicklyfor my pleasure, not yours.Holding her against me, I see that shes panting as I slip my hand through her pubic hair and slide my middle finger inside her.I hear a low, sexy hum of appreciation in her throat.Shes so ready.This is mine.All mine.Do you understand?I slip my finger in and out of her, holding her, as her lips part with shock and desire.Yes, yours, she whispers.Yes.Mine.And I wont let you forget it, Ana.I push her down onto the couch, unzip my fly, and lie down on top of her, pinning her beneath me.Hands on your head, I growl through clenched teeth.I kneel up and spread my knees, forcing her legs wider.From the inside pocket of my jacket I take out a condom, then discard my jacket on the floor.With my eyes on hers I open the packet and roll it down my eager dick.Ana places her hands on her head, watching me, her eyes glinting with need.As I crawl over her shes squirming beneath me, her hips rising to tease and greet me.We dont have long.This will be quick, and its for me, not you.Do you understand?Dont come, or I will spank you, I order, focusing on her dazed wide eyes, and with a swift, hard move I bury myself inside her.She calls out in a welcome and familiar cry of pleasure.I hold her down so she cant move, and I start to fuck her, consuming her.But greedily she tilts her pelvis, meeting me thrust for thrust, spurring me on.Oh, Ana.Yes, baby.She gives it back to me, matching my fervent pace, over and over.Oh, the feel of her.And Im lost.In her.In this.In her scent.And I dont know if its because Im mad or tense or  Yessss.I come quickly, losing all reason as I explode inside her.I still.Filling her.Owning her.Reminding her that shes mine.Fuck.That was  I pull out of her and kneel up.Dont touch yourself.My voice is hoarse and breathless.I want you frustrated.Thats what you do to me by not talking to me, by denying me whats mine.She nods, sprawled out beneath me, her dress bunched up around her waist so I can see shes wide and wet and wanting, and looking every bit the goddess that she is.I stand up, remove the wretched condom and knot it, then dress, picking up my jacket from the floor.I take a deep breath.Im calmer now.Much calmer.Fuck, that was good.Wed better get back to the house.She sits up, staring at me with dark, inscrutable eyes.Lord, shes lovely.Here.You may put these on.From my jacket pocket I fish out her lacy panties and pass them to her.I think shes trying not to laugh.Yeah, yeah.Game, set, and match to you, Miss Steele.Christian!Mia yells from the floor below.Shit.Just in time.Christ, she can be really irritating.But thats my little sister.Alarmed, I glance at Ana as she slips on her underwear.She scowls at me as she stands to straighten her dress and fixes her hair with her fingers.Up here, Mia, I call.Well, Miss Steele, I feel better for thatbut I still want to spank you.I dont believe I deserve it, Mr.Grey, especially after tolerating your unprovoked attack.She is crisp and formal.Unprovoked?You kissed me.It was attack as the best form of defense.Defense against what?You and your twitchy palm.Shes trying to suppress a smile.Mias high heels rattle up the stairs.But it was tolerable?I ask.Ana smirks.Barely.Oh, there you are!Mia exclaims, beaming at the two of us.Two minutes earlier and this could have been really awkward.I was showing Anastasia around.I hold out my hand to Ana and she takes it.I want to kiss her knuckles, but I settle for a soft squeeze.Kate and Elliot are about to leave.Can you believe those two?They cant keep their hands off each other.Mia wrinkles her nose in distaste.What have you been doing in here?Showing Anastasia my rowing trophies.With my free hand I wave toward the faux precious metal statuettes from my sculling days at Harvard arranged on shelves at the end of the room.Lets go say good bye to Kate and Elliot.Mia turns to go and I let Ana precede me, but before we get to the stairs I smack her behind.She smothers her yelp.I will do it again, Anastasia, and soon, I whisper in her ear, and folding her into my arms, I kiss her hair.We walk hand in hand across the lawn back to the house while Mia gabbles beside us.Its a beautiful evening; its been a beautiful day.Im glad Anas met my family.Why havent I done this before?Because Ive never wanted to.I squeeze Anas hand, and she gives me a shy look and an oh so sweet smile.In my other hand I hold her shoes, and at the stone steps I bend down to fasten each of her sandals in turn.There, I announce when Im done.Why, thank you, Mr.Grey, she says.The pleasure is, and was, all mine.Im well aware of that, Sir, she teases.Oh, you two are sooo sweet!Mia coos as we head into the kitchen.Ana gives me a sideways look.Back in the hallway, Kavanagh and Elliot are about to leave.Ana hugs Kate, but then pulls her aside to have a heated private conversation.What the hell is that about?Elliot takes Kavanaghs arm and my parents wave them off as they climb into Elliots pickup.We should go, tooyou have interviews tomorrow.We have to drive her back to her new apartment and its nearly 11:00.We never thought hed find anyone!Mia gushes as she hugs Ana, hard.Oh, for fucks sake  Take care of yourself, Ana dear, Grace says, smiling warmly at my girl.I pull Ana to my side.Lets not frighten her away or spoil her with too much affection.Christian, stop teasing, Grace chastises me in her usual manner.Mom.I give her a quick peck.Thank you for inviting Ana.Its been a revelation.Ana says good bye to my dad, and we head to the Audi, where Taylor waits, holding the rear passenger door open for her.Well, it seems my family likes you, too, I observe when Ive joined Ana in the back.Her eyes reflect the light from my parents porch, but I cant tell what shes thinking.Shadows shroud her face as Taylor drives smoothly out onto the road.I catch her staring at me under the flicker of a street lamp.Shes anxious.Somethings wrong.What?I ask.She is quiet at first, and when she speaks theres an emptiness in her voice.I think that you felt trapped into bringing me to meet your parents.If Elliot hadnt asked Kate, youd never have asked me.Damn.She doesnt understand.It was a first for me.I was nervous.Surely she knows by now that if I didnt want her here, she wouldnt be here.As we pass from light to shadow under the street lamps, she looks distant and upset.Grey, this will not do.Anastasia, Im delighted that youve met my parents.Why are you so filled with self doubt?It never ceases to amaze me.Youre such a strong, self contained young woman, but you have such negative thoughts about yourself.If I hadnt wanted you to meet them, you wouldnt be here.Is that how you were feeling the whole time you were there?I shake my head, reach for her hand, and give it another reassuring squeeze.She glances nervously at Taylor.Dont worry about Taylor.Talk to me.Yes.I thought that, she says quietly.And another thing, I only mentioned Georgia because Kate was talking about Barbados.I havent made up my mind.Do you want to go and see your mother?Yes.My anxiety surfaces.Does she want out?If she goes to Georgia, her mother might persuade her to find someone moresuitable, someone who, like her mother, believes in romance.I have an idea.Shes met my folks; Ive met Ray; perhaps I should meet her mother, the incurable romantic.Charm her.Can I come with you?I ask, knowing that shell say no.Um, I dont think thats a good idea, she answers, surprised by my question.Why not?I was hoping for a break from all thisintensity.To try to think things through.Shit.She does want to leave me.Im too intense?She laughs.Thats putting it mildly!Damn, I love making her laugh, even if it is at my expense; and Im relieved shes kept her sense of humor.Perhaps she doesnt want to leave me after all.Are you laughing at me, Miss Steele?I tease.I wouldnt dare, Mr.Grey.I think you dare, and I think you do laugh at me, frequently.You are quite funny.Funny?Oh yes.Shes making fun of me.Its novel.Funny peculiar or funny ha ha?Oh, a lot of one and some of the other.Which way more?Ill leave you to figure that out.I sigh.Im not sure if I can figure anything out around you.My tone is dry.What do you need to think about in Georgia?Us.Fuck.You said youd try, I gently remind her.I know.Are you having second thoughts?Possibly.Its worse than I feared.Why?She stares at me in silence.Why, Anastasia?I persist.She shrugs, her mouth turned down, and I hope shell find her hand in mine reassuring.Talk to me.I dont want to lose you.This last week  Has been the best in my life.I still want more, she breathes.Oh no, not this again.What does she need me to say?I know.Ill try.I clasp her chin.For you, Anastasia, I will try.Ive just taken you to meet my parents, for heavens sake.Suddenly she unbuckles her seatbelt, and before I know it shes scrambled into my lap.What the hell?I sit immobile as her arms slip around my head, and her lips find mine, and coax a kiss from me before the darkness has a chance to stir.My hands slide up her back until Im cradling her head and returning her passion, exploring her sweet, sweet mouth, trying to find answersHer unexpected affection is utterly disarming.And new.And confusing.I thought she wanted to leave, and now shes in my lap and turning me on, again.Ive neverneverDont go, Ana.Stay with me tonight.If you go away, I wont see you all week.Please, I whisper.Yes, she murmurs.And Ill try, too.Ill sign your contract.Oh, baby.Sign after Georgia.Think about it.Think about it hard.I want her to do this willinglyI dont want to force this on her.Well, part of me doesnt.The rational part.I will, she says, and nestles against me.This woman has me tied up in knots.Ironic, Grey.And I want to laugh because Im relieved and happy, but I hold her, breathing in her redolent and comforting scent.You really should wear your seatbelt, I scold, but I dont want her to move.She stays wrapped in my embrace, her body slowly relaxing against mine.The darkness inside me is quiet, contained, and Im confused by my warring emotions.What do I want out of her?What do I need out of her?This is not how we should be progressing, but I like her in my arms; I like cradling her like this.I kiss her hair, and lean back and enjoy the ride into Seattle.Taylor stops outside the entrance to Escala.Were home, I whisper to Ana.Im reluctant to release her, but I lift her onto her seat.Taylor opens her door and she joins me at the entrance to the building.A shiver runs through her.Why dont you have a jacket?I ask as I slip mine off and drape it over her shoulders.Its in my new car, she says, yawning.Tired, Miss Steele?Yes, Mr.Grey.Ive been prevailed upon in ways I never thought possible today.Well, if youre really unlucky, I may prevail upon you some more.If I get lucky.She leans against the wall of the elevator as we travel up to the penthouse.Under my jacket she looks slim and small and sexy.If she wasnt wearing her underwear I could take her in here I reach up and free her lip from her teeth.One day I will fuck you in this elevator, Anastasia, but right now youre tiredso I think we should stick to a bed.I bend down and gently take her bottom lip in my teeth.Her breath catches and she returns the gesture with her teeth and my upper lip.I feel it in my groin.I want to take her to bed and lose myself in her.After our conversation in the car I just want to be sure shes mine.When we exit the elevator I offer her a drink, but she declines.Good.Lets go to bed.She looks surprised.Youre going to settle for plain old vanilla?Nothing plain or old about vanilla.Its a very intriguing flavor.Since when?Since last Saturday.Why?Were you hoping for something more exotic?Oh no.Ive had enough exotic for one day.Sure?We cater for all tastes hereat least thirty one flavors.I give her a lascivious look.Ive noticed.She raises one fine eyebrow.Come on, Miss Steele, you have a big day tomorrow.Sooner youre in bed, sooner youll be fucked, and sooner you can sleep.Mr.Grey, you are a born romantic.Miss Steele, you have a smart mouth.I may have to subdue it some way.Come.Yeah.I can think of one way.Closing the door of my bedroom, I feel lighter than I did in the car.Shes still here.Hands in the air, I order, and she does as shes told.I grip the hem of her dress and in one smooth move pull it up and over her body to reveal the beautiful woman beneath.Ta da!Im a magician.Ana giggles and gives me a round of applause.I bow, enjoying the game, before placing her dress on my chair.And for your next trick?she asks, eyes glittering.Oh, my dear Miss Steele.Get into my bed, and Ill show you.Do you think that for once I should play hard to get?she teases, tilting her head to one side so her hair tumbles over her shoulder.A new game.This is interesting.Well, the doors closed.Not sure how youre going to avoid me.I think its a done deal.But Im a good negotiator, she says, her voice soft but determined.So am I.   Okay, whats going on here?Is she reluctant?Too tired?What?Dont you want to fuck?I ask, confused.No, she whispers.Oh.Well, thats disappointing.She swallows, then says in a small voice, I want you to make love to me.I stare at her, bemused.What exactly does she mean?Make love?We do.We have.Its just another term for fucking.She studies me, her expression grave.Hell.Is this her idea of more?All the hearts and flowers shit, is that what she means?But were just talking semantics, surely?This is semantics.Ana, I What does she want from me?I thought we did.I want to touch you.Fuck.No.I step back as the darkness closes around my ribs.Please, she whispers.No.No.Havent I made it clear?I cant bear to be touched.I cant.Ever.Oh no, Miss Steele, youve had enough concessions from me this evening.And Im saying no.No?she queries.No.And for a moment I want to send her home, or upstairsanywhere away from me.Not here.Dont touch me.Shes watching me warily and I think about the fact that shes leaving tomorrow and I wont see her for a while.I sigh.I dont have the energy for this.Look, youre tired, Im tired.Lets just go to bed.So touching is a hard limit for you?Yes.This is old news.I cant keep the exasperation out of my voice.Please tell me why.I dont want to go there.This is not a conversation I want to have.Ever.Oh, Anastasia, please.Just drop it for now.Her face falls.Its important to me, she says, a hesitant plea in her voice.Fuck this, I mutter to myself.At the chest of drawers I pull out a T shirt and throw it to her.Put that on and get into bed.Why am I even letting her sleep with me?But its a rhetorical question: deep down I know the answer.Its because I sleep better with her.Shes my dream catcher.She keeps my nightmares at bay.She turns away from me and removes her bra, then slips on the T shirt.What did I say to her in the playroom this afternoon?She shouldnt hide her body from me.I need the bathroom, she says.Now youre asking permission?Erno.Anastasia, you know where the bathroom is.Today, at this point in our strange arrangement, you dont need my permission to use it.I unbutton my shirt and slip it off, and she dashes past me out of the bedroom as I try to contain my temper.Whats gotten into her?One evening at my parents and shes expecting serenades and sunsets and fucking walks in the rain.Thats not what Im about.Ive told her this.I dont do romance.I sigh heavily as I remove my pants.But she wants more.She wants all that romantic shit.Fuck.In my closet I throw my pants into the laundry basket and pull on my PJ bottoms, and then wander back into my bedroom.This isnt going to work, Grey.But I want it to work.You should let her go.No.I can make this work.Somehow.The radio alarm reads 11:46.Time for bed.I check my phone for any urgent e mails.Theres nothing.I give the bathroom door a brisk knock.Come in, Ana garbles.Shes brushing her teeth, literally foaming at the mouthwith my toothbrush.She spits into the sink as I stand beside her, and we stare at each other in the mirror.Her eyes are bright with mischief and humor.She rinses off the toothbrush and without a word hands it to me.I put it in my mouth and she looks pleased with herself.And just like that, all the tension from our previous exchange evaporates.Do feel free to borrow my toothbrush, I say sardonically.Thank you, Sir.She beams, and for a moment I think shes going to curtsey, but she leaves me to brush my teeth.When I reenter the bedroom shes stretched out under the covers.She should be stretched out under me.You know this is not how I saw tonight panning out.I sound sullen.Imagine if I said to you that you couldnt touch me, she says, as argumentative as ever.Shes not going to let this go.I sit down on the bed.Anastasia, Ive told you.Fifty shades.I had a rough start in lifeyou dont want that shit in your head.Why would you?No one should have this shit in their head!Because I want to know you better.You know me well enough.How can you say that?She sits up and kneels facing me, earnest and eager.Ana.Ana.Ana.Let it go.For fucks sake.Youre rolling your eyes, she says.Last time I did that, I ended up over your knee.Oh, Id like to put you there again.Right now.Her face brightens.Tell me, and you can.What?You heard me.Youre bargaining with me?My voice betrays my disbelief.She nods.Negotiating.I frown.It doesnt work that way, Anastasia.Okay.Tell me, and Ill roll my eyes at you.I laugh.Now she is being ridiculous, and cute in my T shirt.Her face shines with longing.Always so keen and eager for information, I marvel.And a thought occurs to me: I could spank her.Ive wanted to since dinner, but I could make it fun.I get off the bed.Dont go away, I warn, and leave the room.From my study I pick up the key to the playroom and head upstairs.In the playroom chest I retrieve the toys I want and contemplate lube as well, but on reflection, and judging from recent experience, I dont think Ana will need any.Shes sitting on the bed when I get back, her expression bright with curiosity.Whens your first interview tomorrow?I ask.Two.Excellent.No early morning.Good.Get off the bed.Stand over here.I point to a spot in front of me.Ana scrambles off the bed with no hesitation, eager as ever.Shes waiting.Trust me?She nods, and I hold out my hand, revealing two silver kegel balls.She frowns and looks from the balls to me.These are new.I am going to put these inside you and then Im going to spank you, not for punishment, but for your pleasure and mine.MONDAY, MAY 30, 2011    * * *      Her sharp intake of breath is music to my dick.Then well fuck, I whisper.And if youre still awake, Ill impart some information about my formative years.Agreed?She nods.Her breathing has accelerated, her pupils are larger, darker, with her need and her thirst for knowledge.Good girl.Open your mouth.She hesitates for a moment, bewildered.But she does as shes told before I can reprimand her.Wider.I insert both of the balls into her mouth.Theyre a little big and heavy but will keep her smart mouth occupied for a moment or two.They need lubrication.Suck.She blinks and tries to suck, her stance changing subtly as she presses her thighs together and squirms.Oh yes.Keep still, Anastasia, I caution, but Im enjoying the show.Enough.Stop, I order, and tug them from her mouth.At the bed I throw the comforter aside and sit down.Come here.She sidles up to me, wanton and sexy.Oh, Ana, my little freak.Now turn around, bend down, and grab your ankles.Her expression tells me its not what she was expecting to hear.Dont hesitate, I chide her, and I pop the balls into my mouth.She turns around, and with no effort bends over, presenting her long legs and her fine ass to me, my T shirt slipping up her back toward her head and her mane of hair.Well, I could look at this glorious sight for a while and imagine what Id like to do to it.But right now I want to spank and fuck her.I lay my hand over her backside, enjoying her warmth under my palm as I caress her through her panties.Oh, this ass is mine, so mine.And its going to get warmer.I slide her panties to one side, exposing her labia, and hold them in place with one hand.I resist the urge to run my tongue up and down the length of her sex; besides, my mouth is full.Instead, I trace the line down from her perineum to her clitoris and up again, before easing my finger inside her.Deep in my throat I hum with approval and slowly circle my finger, stretching her.She moans and I harden.Instantly.Miss Steele approves.She wants this.With my finger I circle inside her once more, then withdraw and remove the balls from my mouth.Gently, I insert the first ball into her, then the second, leaving the tag outside, draped against her clitoris.I kiss her bare ass and slide her panties back into place.Stand up, I command, and grasp her hips until I know shes steady on her feet.You okay?Yes.Her voice is rough.Turn around.She complies immediately.How does that feel?I ask.Strange.Strange good or strange bad?Strange good, she answers.Good.Shell need to get used to them.What better way than to stretch and reach for something?I want a glass of water.Go and fetch one for me, please.And when you come back, I shall put you across my knee.Think about that, Anastasia.Shes puzzled, but she turns and walks gingerly, with tentative steps, out of the room.While shes gone I collect a condom from my drawer.Im running low; Ill need to stock up on these until her pill kicks in.Sitting back down on the bed, I wait with impatience.When she reenters her walk is more confident, and she has my water.Thank you, I say, taking a quick sip and placing the glass on my bedside table.When I look up shes watching me with overt desire.Its a good look on her.Come.Stand beside me.Like last time.She does, and now her breathing is irregularheavy.Boy, shes really turned on.So different from the last time I spanked her.Lets rile her up some more, Grey.Ask me.My voice is firm.A mystified look crosses her face.Ask me.Come on, Ana.Her brow furrows.Ask me, Anastasia.I wont say it again.My voice is sharper.Finally, she realizes what Im asking for and she blushes.Spank me, please, Sir, she says quietly.Those wordsI close my eyes and let them ring through my head.Grasping her hand, I tug her over my knees so her torso lands on the bed.While stroking her behind with one hand, I smooth her hair off her face with the other, and tuck it behind her ear.Then I grasp her hair at the nape of her neck to hold her in place.I want to see your face while I spank you.I caress her behind and push against her vulva, knowing that the action will push the balls deeper inside her.She hums her approval.This is for pleasure, Anastasia, mine and yours.I lift my hand, then smack her right there.Ah!she mouths, screwing up her face, and I caress her sweet, sweet ass while she adjusts to the sensation.When she relaxes, I smack her again.She groans, and I suppress my response.I begin in earnest, right cheek, left cheek, then the junction of her thighs and ass.Between each smack I fondle and knead her backside, watching her skin turn a delicate shade of pink beneath her lacy underwear.She moans, absorbing the pleasure, enjoying the experience.I stop.I want to see her ass in all its rosy glory.Unhurriedly, teasing her, I tug down her panties, skimming my fingertips down her thighs, the backs of her knees, and her calves.She lifts her feet, and I discard her panties on the floor.She squirms, but stops when I place my hand flat against her pink, glowing skin.Grabbing her hair again, I start anew.Gently first, then resuming the pattern.Shes wet; her arousal is on my palm.I grip her hair harder and she moans, eyes closed, mouth open and slack.Fuck, shes hot.Good girl.My voice is hoarse, my breathing erratic.I spank her a couple more times until I can bear it no more.I want her.Now.I wrap my fingers around the tab and draw the balls out of her.She cries out in pleasure.Turning her over, I pause to yank my pants off and put on a wretched condom, then lie down beside her.I grab her hands, lift them over her head, and slowly ease myself onto her and into her as she mewls like a cat.Oh, baby.She feels incredible.I want you to make love to me.Her words ring in my head.And gently, oh so gently, I start to move, feeling every precious inch of her beneath and around me.I kiss her, appreciating her mouth and her body at once.She wraps her legs around mine, meeting each gentle thrust, rocking against me until she spirals up and up and up and lets go.Her orgasm tips me over the edge.Ana!I call, pouring myself into her.Letting go.A welcome release that leaves mewanting more.Needing more.As my equilibrium returns, I push away the strange swell of emotion that gnaws at my insides.Its not like the darkness, but its something to fear.Something I dont understand.She flexes her fingers around mine, and I open my eyes and look down into her sleepy, sated gaze.I enjoyed that, I whisper, and give her a lingering kiss.She rewards me with a drowsy smile.I get up, cover her with the comforter, pick up my PJ pants, and pad into the bathroom, where I remove and dispose of the condom.I pull on my pants and find the arnica cream.Back at the bed, Ana gives me a contented grin.Roll over, I order, and for a moment I think shes going to roll her eyes, but she indulges me and moves.Your ass is a glorious color, I observe, pleased with the results.I squirt some cream on my palm and slowly massage it into her behind.Spill the beans, Grey, she says with a yawn.Miss Steele, you know how to ruin a moment.We had a deal, she insists.How do you feel?Shortchanged.With a heavy sigh I place the arnica cream on the bedside table and slip into bed, pulling Ana into my arms.I kiss her ear.The woman who brought me into this world was a crack whore, Anastasia.Go to sleep.She tenses in my arms.I still.I do not want her sympathy or her pity.Was?she whispers.Shes dead.How long?She died when I was four.I dont really remember her.Carrick has given me some details.I only remember certain things.Please go to sleep.After a while she relaxes against me.Good night, Christian.Her voice is sleepy.Good night, Ana.I kiss her once more, inhaling her soothing scent and fighting off my memories.Dont just pick the apples and throw them away, asshole!Fuck off, you righteous dweeb.Elliot picks an apple, takes a bite, and throws it at me.Maggot, he taunts.No!Dont call me that.I jump him.Pounding my fists into his face.You fucking pig.This is food.Youre just wasting it.Grandpa sells these.You pig.Pig.Pig.ELLIOT.CHRISTIAN.Dad drags me off Elliot, who is cowering on the ground.What is this about?Hes insane.Elliot!Hes destroying the apples.Anger swells in my chest, in my throat.I think I might explode.Hes taking a bite and then throwing them away.Throwing them at me.Elliot, is this true?Elliot turns red under Dads hard stare.I think youd better come with me.Christian, pick up the apples.You can help Mom bake a pie.Shes fast asleep when I wake, my nose in her fragrant hair, my arms cocooning her.Ive dreamed about romping through my grandfathers apple orchard with Elliot; those were happy, angry days.Its nearly sevenanother lie in with Miss Steele.Its odd waking up beside her, but odd in a good way.I contemplate waking her with a morning fuck; my body is more than willingbut shes practically comatose and she might be sore.I should let her sleep.I climb out of bed, careful not to wake her, grab a T shirt, gather her clothes from the floor, and wander into the living room.Good morning, Mr.Grey.Mrs.Jones is busy in the kitchen.Good morning, Gail.Stretching, I look out the windows at the remnants of a vivid dawn.You have some laundry there?she asks.Yes.These are Anastasias.Do you want me to wash and press them?Do you have time?Ill put them on the quick cycle.Excellent, thank you.I pass her Anas clothes.How was your sister?Very well, thanks.The kids are growing.Boys can be rough.I know.She smiles and offers to make me some coffee.Please.Ill be in my study.As she watches me her smile changes from pleasant to knowingin the way thats feminine and secretive.Then she hurries out of the kitchen, I assume to the laundry room.Whats her problem?Okay, this is the first Mondaythe first timein the four years shes worked for me that theres been a woman asleep in my bed.But its not that big a deal.Breakfast for two, Mrs.Jones.I think you can manage that.I shake my head and wander into my study to start work.Ill shower latermaybe with Ana.I check my e mails and send one to Andrea and Ros, saying Ill be in this afternoon, not this morning.Then I take a look at Barneys latest schematics.GAIL KNOCKS AND BRINGS me a second cup of coffee, letting me know its already 8:15.That late?Im not going into the office this morning.Taylor was asking.Ill go this afternoon.Ill tell him.Ive hung Miss Steeles clothes in your closet.Thank you.That was quick.She still asleep?I think so.And theres that little smile again.I arch my brows and her smile broadens as she turns to leave my study.I put my work aside and head off with my coffee to take a shower and have a shave.ANA IS STILL OUT for the count when I finish dressing.Youve exhausted her, Grey.And it was pleasurable, more than pleasurable.She looks serene, as if she doesnt have a care in the world.Good.From the chest I take my watch, and on an impulse open the top drawer and pocket my last condom.You never know.I amble back through the living room toward my study.Do you want your breakfast yet, sir?Ill have breakfast with Ana.Thanks.I pick up the phone and call Andrea from my desk.After weve exchanged a few words she puts me through to Ros.So when can we expect you?Ross tone is sarcastic.Good morning, Ros.How are you?I say sweetly.Pissed.At me?Yes, at you, and your hands off work ethic.Ill be in later.The reason Im calling is Ive decided to liquidate Woodss company.Ive told her this already, but she and Marco are taking too long.I want this done, now.I remind her that this was going to happen if the companys P&L didnt improve.And it hasnt.He needs more time.Im not interested, Ros.Were not carrying deadweight.Are you sure?I dont want any more lame excuses.Enough, already.Ive made up my mind.Christian  Have Marco call me, its shit or bust time.Okay.Okay.If thats what you really want.Anything else?Yes.Tell Barney that the prototype looks good, though Im not sure about the interface.I thought the interface worked well, once I figured it out.Not that Im an expert.No, its just missing something.Talk to Barney.I want to meet him this afternoon to discuss.Face to face?Her sarcasm is irritating.But I ignore her tone and tell her that I want his whole team there to brainstorm.Hell be pleased.So Ill see you this afternoon?She sounds hopeful.Okay, I reassure her.Transfer me back to Andrea.While I wait for her to pick up the phone I gaze out at the cloudless sky.Its the same shade as Anas eyes.Sappy, Grey.Andrea  A movement distracts me.Looking up, Im pleased to see Ana standing in the doorway, dressed in nothing but my T shirt.Her legs, long and shapely, are on display for my eyes only.She has great legs.Mr.Grey, Andrea answers.My eyes lock with Anas.They are the color of a summer sky and just as warm.Good Lord, I could bask in her warmth all dayevery day.Dont be absurd, Grey.Clear my schedule this morning, but get Bill to call me.Ill be in at two.I need to talk to Marco this afternoon, that will need at least half an hour.A soft smile tugs at Anas lips and I find myself mirroring her.Yes, sir, Andrea says.Schedule Barney and his team in after Marco or maybe tomorrow, and find time for me to see Claude every day this week.Sam wants to talk to you, this morning.Tell him to wait.Its about Darfur.Oh?Apparently he sees the aid convoy as a great personal PR opportunity.Oh, God.He would, wouldnt he?No, I dont want publicity for Darfur.My voice is gruff with exasperation.He says theres a journalist from Forbes who wants to talk to you about it.How the hell do they know?Tell Sam to deal with it, I snap.Thats what hes paid to do.Do you want to speak to him directly?she asks.No.Will do.I also need to RSVP to the event on Saturday.Which event?Chamber of Commerce Gala.Thats next Saturday?I ask, as an idea pops into my head.Yes, sir.Hold on I turn to Ana, whos jiggling her left foot but not taking her sky blue eyes off me.When will you be back from Georgia?Friday, she says.Ill need an extra ticket, because I have a date, I inform Andrea.A date?Andrea squeaks with incredulity.I sigh.Yes, Andrea, thats what I said.A date.Miss Anastasia Steele will accompany me.Yes, Mr.Grey.She sounds as if Ive made her day.For fucks sake.What is it with my staff?Thats all.I hang up.Good morning, Miss Steele.Mr.Grey, Ana says in greeting.I walk around my desk until Im in front of her, and caress her face.I didnt want to wake you, you looked so peaceful.Did you sleep well?I am very well rested, thank you.I just came to say hi before I had a shower.Shes smiling and her eyes are shining with delight.Its a pleasure to see her like this.Before I get back to work I lean down to give her a gentle kiss.Suddenly she wraps her arms around my neck and tangles her fingers in my hair, and presses her body along the length of mine.Whoa.Her lips are persistent, so I respond, kissing her back, surprised by the intensity of her ardor.With one hand I cup her head, with the other her naked, recently spanked ass, and my body ignites like dry tinder.Well, sleep seems to agree with you.My voice is laced with sudden lust.I suggest you go and have your shower, or shall I lay you across my desk now?I choose the desk, she whispers at the corner of my mouth, grinding her sex against my erection.Well, this is a surprise.Her eyes are dark and greedy with want.Youve really got a taste for this, havent you, Miss Steele?Youre becoming insatiable.Ive only got a taste for you.Damn right.Only me!Her words are a sirens call to my libido.Losing all self restraint, I sweep everything off my desk, sending my papers, phone, and pens all clattering or floating to the floor, but I dont give a damn.I lift Ana and lay her across my desk so her hair spills over the edge and onto the seat of my chair.You want it, you got it, baby, I growl, whipping out the condom and unzipping my pants.Making quick work of covering my cock, I stare down at the insatiable Miss Steele.I sure hope youre ready, I warn her, grabbing hold of her wrists and keeping them at her sides.With one swift move Im inside her.AhChrist, Ana.Youre so ready.I give her a nanosecond to adjust to my presence.Then I start to push.Back and forth.Over and over.Harder and harder.She tips her head back, mouth open in a wordless plea, as her breasts rise and fall in rhythm with each jolt to her body.She wraps her legs around me while I stand, drilling into her.This what you want, baby?She meets every thrust, rocking against me and moaning as I possess her.Taking herhigher and higher and higheruntil I feel her stiffening around me.Come on, baby, give it up for me, I grit through clenched teeth, and she does, spectacularly, crying out and sucking me into my own orgasm.Fuck.I come as spectacularly as she does, and I slump down on top of her while her body tightens around me with aftershocks.Damn.That was unexpected.What the hell are you doing to me?Im breathless, my lips skimming her neck.You completely beguile me, Ana.You weave some powerful magic.And you jumped me!I release her wrists and move to stand, but she tightens her legs around me, her fingers tangling in my hair.Im the one beguiled, she whispers.Our eyes are locked, her scrutiny intense, as if shes seeing through me.Seeing the darkness in my soul.Shit.Let me go.This is too much.I cup her face in my hands to kiss her quickly, but as I do the unwelcome thought of her being in this position with someone else pops into my mind.No.Shes not doing this with anyone else.Ever.You.Are.Mine.My words crack between us.Do you understand?Yes, yours, she says, her expression heartfelt, her words full of conviction, and my irrational jealousy recedes.Are you sure you have to go to Georgia?I ask, smoothing her hair from around her face.She nods.Damn.I pull out of her and she winces.Are you sore?A little, she says with a timid smile.I like you sore.Reminds you where Ive been, and only me.I give her a rough, possessive kiss.Because I dont want her to go to Georgia.And no ones jumped me sincesince Elena.And even then, it was always calculated, part of a scene.Standing, I hold out my hand and pull her to a sitting position.As I tug off the condom, she murmurs, Always prepared.I give her a confounded look as I fasten my fly.She holds up the empty foil packet by way of explanation.A man can hope, Anastasia, dream even, and sometimes his dreams come true.I had no idea Id get to use it so soon, and on her terms, not mine.Miss Steele, for such an innocent, you are, as ever, unexpected.Soon your deskthats been a dream?she asks.Sweetheart.Ive had sex on this desk many, many times, but always at my instigation, never at a submissives.This is not how it works.Her face falls as she reads my thoughts.Shit.What can I say?Ana, unlike you, I have a past.I run my hand through my hair in frustration; this morning is not going according to plan.Id better go and have a shower, she says, subdued.She stands and takes a few steps toward the door.Ive got a couple more calls to make.Ill join you for breakfast once youre out of the shower.I gaze after her, wondering what to say to make this right.I think Mrs.Jones has laundered your clothes from yesterday.Theyre in the closet.She looks surprised, and impressed.Thank you, she says.Youre most welcome.Her brow creases as she studies me, baffled.What?I ask.Whats wrong?What do you mean?Well, youre being more weird than usual.You find me weird?Ana, baby, weird is my middle name.Sometimes.Tell her.Tell her no ones pounced on you for a long time.As ever, Im surprised by you, Miss Steele.Surprised how?Lets just say that was an unexpected treat.We aim to please, Mr.Grey, she teases, still scrutinizing me.And please me you do, I acknowledge.But you disarm me, too.I thought you were going to have a shower?Her mouth turns down.Shit.Yes, um, Ill see you in a moment.She turns and scampers out of my study, leaving me standing in a maze of confusion.I shake my head to clear it, then begin picking up my scattered belongings from the floor and arranging them on my desk.How the hell can she just waltz into my study and seduce me?Im supposed to be in control of this relationship.This is what I was thinking about last night: her unbridled enthusiasm and affection.How the hell am I supposed to deal with that?Its not something I know.I pause as I pick up my phone.But its nice.Yeah.More than nice.I chuckle at the thought and remember her nice e mail.Damn, theres a missed call from Bill.He must have phoned during my tryst with Miss Steele.I sit down at my desk, master of my own universe once morenow that shes in the showerand call him back.I need Bill to tell me about Detroitand I need to get back on my game.Bill doesnt pick up, so I call Andrea.Mr.Grey.Is the jet free today and tomorrow?Its not scheduled for use until Thursday, sir.Great.Can you try Bill for me?Sure.My conversation with Bill is lengthy.Ruth has done an excellent job scouting all of the available brownfield sites in Detroit.Two are viable for the tech plant we want to build, and Bill is certain that Detroit has the available labor force we require.My heart sinks.Does it have to be Detroit?I have vague memories of the place: drunks, hobos, and crackheads shouting at us on the streets; the seedy dive we called home; and a young, broken woman, the crack whore I called Mommy, staring into space while she sat in a drab, grimy room filled with stale air and dust motes.And him.I shudder.Dont think about himor her.But I cant help it.Ana has said nothing about my nocturnal confession.Ive never mentioned the crack whore to anyone.Perhaps thats why Ana attacked me this morning: she thinks I need some TLC.Fuck that.Baby.Ill take your body if you offer it up.Im doing just fine.But even as the thought pops into my head I wonder if Im just fine.I ignore my unease; its something to discuss with Flynn when hes back.Right now, Im hungry.I hope shes gotten her sweet butt out of that shower, because I need to eat.ANA IS STANDING AT the kitchen counter talking to Mrs.Jones, who has set places for our breakfast.Would you like something to eat?asks Mrs.Jones.No thank you, Ana says.Oh no you dont.Of course youll have something to eat, I growl at both of them.She likes pancakes, bacon, and eggs, Mrs.Jones.Yes, Mr.Grey.What would you like, sir?she replies, without batting an eyelid.Omelet, please, and some fruit.Sit, I tell Ana, pointing to one of the barstools.She does, and I take a seat beside her while Mrs.Jones makes our breakfast.Have you bought your air ticket?I ask.No, Ill buy it when I get home, over the Internet.Do you have the money?Yes, she says, as if Im five years old, and she tosses her hair over her shoulder, flattening her lips, peeved, I think.I arch an eyebrow in censure.I could always spank you again, sweetheart.Yes, I do, thank you, she says quickly, in a more subdued tone.Thats better.I have a jet.Its not scheduled to be used for three days; its at your disposal.This will be a no.But at least I can offer.Her lips part in shock and her expression transforms, from stunned to impressed and exasperated in equal measure.Weve already made serious misuse of your companys aviation fleet.I wouldnt want to do it again, she says nonchalantly.Its my company, its my jet.She shakes her head.Thank you for the offer.But Id be happier taking a scheduled flight.Surely most women would jump at the opportunity of taking a private jet, but it seems material wealth really doesnt impress this girlor she doesnt like to feel indebted to me.Im not sure which.Either way, shes a stubborn creature.As you wish.I sigh.Do you have much preparation to do for your interview?No.Good.I ask but she still wont tell me which of the publishing houses shes seeing.Instead she gives me a sphinxlike smile.Theres no way shes divulging this secret.Im a man of means, Miss Steele.Im fully aware of that, Mr.Grey.Are you going to track my phone?Trust her to remember that.Actually, Ill be quite busy this afternoon, so Ill have to get someone else to do it, I answer, smirking.If you can spare someone to do that, youre obviously overstaffed.Oh, shes sassy today.Ill send an e mail to the head of human resources and have her look into our head count.This is what I like: our banter.Its refreshing and fun, and unlike anything Ive known before.Mrs.Jones serves us breakfast, and Im pleased to see Ana relishing her food.When Mrs.Jones leaves the kitchen Ana peers up at me.What is it, Anastasia?You know, you never did tell me why you dont like to be touched.Not this again!Ive told you more than Ive ever told anybody.My voice is low to conceal my frustration.Why does she persist with these questions?She eats another couple of mouthfuls of her pancakes.Will you think about our arrangement while youre away?I ask.Yes.Shes earnest.Will you miss me?Grey!She turns to face me, as surprised as I am by the question.Yes, she says after a moment, her expression open and honest.I was expecting a smart remark, yet I get the truth.And strangely, I find her admission comforting.Ill miss you, too, I mutter.More than you know.My apartment will be a little quieter without her, and a little emptier.I stroke her cheek and kiss her.She gives me a sweet smile before returning to her breakfast.Ill brush my teeth, then I should go, she announces, once shes finished.So soon.I thought you might stay longer.Shes taken aback.Did she think Id kick her out?Ive prevailed upon you and taken up your time for long enough, Mr.Grey.Besides, dont you have an empire to run?I can play hooky.Hope swells in my chest and my voice.And Ive just cleared my morning.I have to prep for my interviews.And get changed.She eyes me warily.You look great.Why, thank you, Sir, she says graciously.But her cheeks are coloring their familiar rosy pink, like her ass last night.Shes embarrassed.When will she learn to take a compliment?Rising, she takes her plate to the sink.Leave that.Mrs.Jones will do it.Okay.Im just going to brush my teeth.Please feel free to use my toothbrush, I offer, with sarcasm.I had every intention of doing so, she says, and sashays out of the room.That woman has an answer for everything.She returns a few moments later with her purse.Dont forget to take your BlackBerry, your Mac, and your chargers to Georgia.Yes, Sir, she says obediently.Good girl.Come.I lead her to the elevator and step in with her.You dont have to come down.I can see myself to my car.Its all part of the service, I quip ironically.Besides, I can kiss you all the way down.I fold her into my arms and do just that, enjoying her taste and her tongue and giving her a proper good bye.Were both aroused and breathless by the time the doors open on the garage level.But shes leaving.I take her to her car and open the drivers door for her, ignoring my need.Good bye, for now, Sir, she whispers, and kisses me once more.Drive safely, Anastasia.And safe travels.I close her door, stand back, and watch her leave.Then I head upstairs.I knock on Taylors study door and let him know that Id like to go to the office in ten minutes.Ill have the car waiting, sir.I CALL WELCH FROM the car.Mr.Grey, he rasps.Welch.Anastasia Steele is buying an airline ticket today, leaving Seattle tonight for Savannah.Id like to know which flight shes on.Does she have an airline preference?Im afraid I dont know.Ill see what I can do.I hang up.My cunning plan is falling into place.MR.GREY!ANDREA IS startled at my appearance several hours early.I want to tell her that I do fucking work here, but I decide to behave.I thought Id surprise you.Coffee?she chirps.Please.With or without milk?Good girl.With.Steamed milk.Yes, Mr.Grey.Try Caroline Acton.Id like to speak to her right away.Of course.And make an appointment for me to see Flynn, next week.She nods and sits down to work.At my desk, I switch on my computer.The first e mail in my inbox is from Elena.* * *      From: Elena Lincoln  Subject: The Weekend  Date: May 30 2011, 10:15  To: Christian Grey  Christian, what gives?Your mother told me you took a young woman to dinner yesterday.Im intrigued.Its so not your style.Youve found a new submissive?Call me.Ex   ELENA LINCOLN  ESCLAVA  For The Beauty That Is You  Thats all I need.I close her e mail, resolving to ignore it for now.Olivia knocks and enters with my coffee as Andrea buzzes my phone.I have Welch for you, and Ive left a message for Ms.Acton, Andrea announces.Good.Put him through.Olivia places the latte on my desk and exits flustered.I do my best to ignore her.Welch.No airline tickets purchased as yet, Mr.Grey.But Ill monitor the situation and inform you, should that change.Please do.He hangs up.I take a sip of coffee and dial Ros.JUST BEFORE LUNCH ANDREA puts Caroline Acton through.Mr.Grey, how lovely to hear from you.What can I do for you?Hello, Ms.Acton.Id like the usual.The capsule wardrobe?Do you have a color palette in mind?Blues and greens.Silver maybe, for a formal event.The Chamber of Commerce dinner springs to mind.Gem colors, I think.Nice, Ms.Acton responds with her usual enthusiasm.And satin and silk underwear and nightwear.Something glamorous.Yes, sir.Do you have a budget in mind?No budget.Go all out.I want everything high end.Shoes, too?Please.Great.Sizes?Ill e mail you.I have your address from last time.When would you like delivery?This Friday.Im sure I can do that.Would you like to see photographs of my choices?Please.Great.Ill get on it.Thank you.I hang up and Andrea puts Welch through.Welch.Miss Steele is traveling on DL2610 to Atlanta, departing at 22:25 this evening.I jot down all the details of her flights and connection into Savannah.I summon Andrea, who enters moments later, carrying her notebook.Andrea, Anastasia Steele is traveling on these flights.Upgrade her to first class, check her in, and pay for her to enter the first class lounge.And buy the seat beside her on all flights, there and back.Use my personal credit card.Andreas puzzled look tells me that she thinks Ive taken leave of my senses, but she recovers quickly and accepts my hand scribbled note.Will do, Mr.Grey.Shes trying her best to keep it professional, but I catch her smiling.This is none of her business.MY AFTERNOON IS SPENT in meetings.Marco has prepared preliminary reports on the four publishing houses based in Seattle.I set them aside to read later.Hes also in agreement with me about Woods and his company.This is going to get ugly, but having looked at the synergies, the only way forward is to absorb Woodss tech division and liquidate the rest of his company.Its going to be expensive, but its best for GEH.In the late afternoon I manage to have a quick and strenuous workout with Bastille, so Im calm and relaxed when I head home.After a light supper I sit down to read at my desk.First order of the evening is to reply to Elena.But when I open my e mails, theres one from Ana.She hasnt been far from my thoughts all day.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Interviews  Date: May 30 2011 18:49  To: Christian Grey  Dear Sir,  My interviews

you questions about herwithout you weirding out on me again.Ana  Weirding?What on earth does she mean by that?Is she saying Im weird?Well, I am, I suppose.Maybe.Perhaps shes realized how surprised I

Palms Twitching CEO,  Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.And we know what happens if you contravene the rules, Miss Steele.I check the Sea Tac website for flight departures; her plane has left.I wont be hearing from her for a while.That thought, as well as her little e mail stunt, has put me in a foul mood.Abandoning my work, I head into the kitchen and decide to pour myself a drink, tonight Armagnac.Taylor pops his head around the entrance to the living room.Not now, I bark.Very good, sir, he says, and heads back to wherever he came from.Dont take your mood out on the staff, Grey.Annoyed at myself, I walk toward the windows and stare out at the Seattle skyline.I wonder how shes gotten under my skin, and why our relationship is not progressing in the direction I would like.Im hoping that once shes had a chance to reflect in Georgia, shell make the right decision.Wont she?Anxiety blooms in my chest.I take another slug of my drink and sit down at my piano to play.TUESDAY, MAY 31,

open my eyes.The radio alarm says 5:23.Ive slept fitfully, plagued by unpleasant dreams, and Im exhausted, but I decide to go for a run to wake myself up.Once Im in sweats, I pick up my phone.Theres a text from Ana.Arrived safely in Savannah.A :)  Good.Shes there, and safe.The thought pleases me and I quickly scan my e mail.The subject of Anas latest message leaps out at me: Do you like to scare

you write something like that and I want to run screaming into the hills.I wont, of course, because Id miss you.Really miss you.I want us to work, but I am terrified of the depth of feeling I have for you and the dark path youre leading me down.What you are offering is erotic and sexy, and Im curious, but Im also scared youll hurt mephysically and emotionally.After three months you could say good bye, and where will that leave me if you do?But then I suppose that risk is there in any relationship.This just isnt the sort of relationship I ever envisaged having, especially as my first.Its a huge leap of faith for me.You were right when you said I didnt have a submissive bone in my bodyand I agree with you now.Having said that, I want to be with you, and if thats what I have to do, I would like to try, but I think Ill suck at it and end up black and blueand I dont relish that idea at all.I am so happy that you have said that you will try more.I just need to think about what more means to me, and thats one of the reasons why I wanted some distance.You dazzle me so much I find it very difficult to think clearly when were together.They are calling my flight.I have to go.More later.Your Ana  Shes reprimanding me.Again.But shes stunned me with her honesty.Its illuminating.I read her e mail again and again, and each time I pause at Your Ana.My Ana.She wants us to work.She wants to be with me.Theres hope, Grey.I place my phone on my bedside, and decide I need that run, to clear my head so I can think about my response.I take my usual route up Stewart to Westlake Avenue then around Denny Park a few times, Four Tets She Just Likes to Fight ringing in my ears.Anas given me a great deal to process.Paying her for sex?Like a whore.Ive never thought of her that way.Just the idea makes me mad.Really fucking mad.I sprint once more around the park, my anger spurring me on.Why does she do this to herself?Im rich, so what?She just needs to get used to that.Im reminded of our conversation yesterday about the GEH jet.She wouldnt take that offer.At least she doesnt want me for my money.But does she want me at all?She says I dazzle her.But boy, has she got that the wrong way around.She dazzles me in a way that Ive never experienced, yet shes flown across the country to get away from me.Hows that supposed to make me feel?Shes right.It is a dark path Im leading her down, but one that is far more intimate than any vanilla relationshipor so Ive seen.I only have to look at Elliot and his alarmingly casual approach to dating to see the difference.And Id never hurt her physically or emotionallyhow can she think that?I just want to push her limits, see what she will and wont do.Punish her when she colors outside the linesyeah, it might hurt, but not beyond anything she can take.We can work up to what Id like to do.We can take it slow.And heres the rub.If shes going to do what I want her to do, Im going to have to reassure her and give her more.What that might beI dont yet know.Ive taken her to meet my parents.That was more, surely.And that wasnt so hard.I take a slower jog around the park to think about what disturbs me most about her e mail.It isnt her fear, its that shes terrified of the depth of feeling she has for me.What does that mean?That unfamiliar feeling surfaces in my chest as my lungs burn for air.It scares me.Scares me so much that I push myself harder, so that all I feel is the pain of exertion in my legs and in my chest and the cold sweat that trickles down my back.Yeah.Dont go there, Grey.Stay in control.BACK IN MY APARTMENT I have a quick shower and shave, and then I dress.Gail is in the kitchen when I walk through on the way to my study.Good morning, Mr.Grey.Coffee?Please, I say, not stopping.Im on a mission.At my desk I fire up my iMac and compose my response to Ana.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Finally!Date: May 31 2011 07:30  To: Anastasia Steele  Anastasia,  I am annoyed that as soon as you put some distance between us, you communicate openly and honestly with me.Why cant you do that when were together?Yes, Im rich.Get used to it.Why shouldnt I spend money on you?Weve told your father Im your boyfriend, for heavens sake.Isnt that what boyfriends do?As your Dom, I would expect you to accept whatever I spend on you with no argument.Incidentally, tell your mother, too.I dont know how to answer your comment about feeling like a whore.I know thats not what youve written, but its what you imply.I dont know what I can say or do to eradicate these feelings.Id like you to have the best of everything.I work exceptionally hard so I can spend my money as I see fit.I could buy you your hearts desire, Anastasia, and I want to.Call it redistribution of wealth, if you will.Or simply know that I would not, could not ever think of you in the way you described, and Im angry thats how you perceive yourself.For such a bright, witty, beautiful young woman, you have some real self esteem issues, and I have half a mind to make an appointment for you with Dr.Flynn.I apologize for frightening you.I find the thought of instilling fear in you abhorrent.Do you really think Id let you travel in the hold?I offered you my private jet, for heavens sake.Yes, it was a joke, a poor one obviously.However, the fact is the thought of you bound and gagged turns me on (this is not a jokeits true).I can lose the cratecrates do nothing for me.I know you have issues with gaggingweve talked about thatand if/when I do gag you, well discuss it.What I think you fail to realize is that in Dom/sub relationships it is the sub who has all the power.Thats you.Ill repeat thisyou are the one with all the power.Not I.  In the boathouse you said no.I cant touch you if you say nothats why we have an agreementwhat you will and wont do.If we try things and you dont like them, we can revise the agreement.Its up to younot me.And if you dont want to be bound and gagged in a crate, then it wont happen.I want to share my lifestyle with you.I have never wanted anything so much.Frankly, Im in awe of you, that one so innocent would be willing to try.That says more to me than you could ever know.You fail to see I am caught in your spell, too, even though I have told you this countless times.I dont want to lose you.I am nervous that youve flown three thousand miles to get away from me for a few days, because you cant think clearly around me.Its the same for me, Anastasia.My reason vanishes when were togetherthats the depth of my feeling for you.I understand your trepidation.I did try to stay away from you; I knew you were inexperienced, though I would never have pursued you if I had known exactly how innocent you wereand yet you still manage to disarm me completely in a way that nobody has before.Your e mail, for example: I have read and reread it countless times trying to understand your point of view.Three months is an arbitrary amount of time.We could make it six months, a year?How long do you want it to be?What would make you comfortable?Tell me.I understand that this is a huge leap of faith for you.I have to earn your trust, but by the same token, you have to communicate with me when I am failing to do this.You seem so strong and self contained, and then I read what youve written here, and I see another side to you.We have to guide each other, Anastasia, and I can only take my cues from you.You have to be honest with me, and we have to both find a way to make this arrangement work.You worry about not being submissive.Well, maybe thats true.Having said that, the only time you do assume the correct demeanor for a sub is in the playroom.It seems thats the one place where you let me exercise proper control over you and the only place you do as youre told.Exemplary is the term that comes to mind.And Id never beat you black and blue.I aim for pink.Outside the playroom, I like that you challenge me.Its a very novel and refreshing experience, and I wouldnt want to change that.So, yes, tell me what you want in terms of more.I will endeavor to keep an open mind, and I shall try to give you the space you need and stay away from you while you are in Georgia.I look forward to your next e mail.In the meantime, enjoy yourself.But not too much.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.I press send and take a sip of my cold coffee.Now you have to wait, Grey.See what she says.I stomp into the kitchen to see what Gail has prepared for breakfast.TAYLOR IS WAITING IN the car to whisk me to work.What was it you wanted last night?I ask him.It was nothing important, sir.Good, I respond, and gaze out the window, trying to put Ana and Georgia out of my mind.I fail miserably, but an idea starts to take shape.I call Andrea.Morning.Good morning, Mr.Grey.Im on my way in, but can you put me through to Bill?Yes, sir.A few moments later I have Bill on the line.Mr.Grey.Did your people look at Georgia as an option to site the tech plant?Savannah, in particular?I believe we did, sir.But Ill need to check.Check.Come back to me.Will do.Is that all?For now.Thanks.MY DAY IS FULL of meetings.I look at my e mail sporadically, but theres nothing from Ana.I wonder if shes daunted by the tone of my e mail, or if shes busy doing other things.What other things?Its impossible to avoid thoughts of her.Throughout the day I exchange texts with Caroline Acton, approving and vetoing outfits shes chosen for Ana.I hope she likes them: shell look stunning in all of them.Bill has come back to me with a potential site near Savannah for our plant.Ruth is making inquiries.At least its not Detroit.Elena calls, and we decide to have dinner at Columbia Tower.Christian, youre being so coy about this girl, she chides.Ill tell you everything this evening.Right now Im busy.Youre always busy.She laughs.See you at eight.See you then.Why are the women in my life so nosy?Elena.My mother.AnaI wonder for the hundredth time what shes doing.And behold, theres a response from her, at last.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Verbose?Date:
