My mouth dropped open.You already agreed to it?He winked.Not yet.But youre going to?He smiled.Youll quit being mad when I buy you a Lexus.I dont want a Lexus, I seethed.You can have anything you want, Baby.Imagine how its going to feel driving into any dealership you want, and all you have to do is pick your favorite color.Youre not doing this for me.Stop pretending you are.He leaned over, kissing my hair.No, Im doing it for us.You just cant see how great its going to be.A cold shiver radiated from my chest, traveling down my spine into my legs.He wouldnt see reason until we were in the apartment, and I was terrified that Benny had made him an offer he couldnt refuse.I shook off my fears; I had to believe Travis loved me enough to forget the dollar signs and false promises Benny had made.Pidge?Do you know how to cook a turkey?A Turkey?I said, taken off guard by the sudden change of conversation.He squeezed my hand.Well, Thanksgiving Break is coming up, and you know my dad loves you.He wants you to come for Thanksgiving, but we always end up ordering pizza and watching the game.I thought maybe me and you could try cooking a bird together.You know, have a real turkey dinner for once in the Maddox house.I pressed my lips together, trying not to laugh.You just thaw the turkey and put it in a pan and cook it in the oven all day.Theres not much to it.So youll come?Youll help me?I shrugged.Sure.His attention was diverted from the intoxicating lights below, and I allowed myself to hope that he would see how wrong he was about Benny after all.Travis set our suitcases on the bed and collapsed beside them.He hadnt pushed the Benny issue, and I was hopeful that Vegas was beginning to filter out of his system.I bathed Toto, disgusted that he reeked of smoke and dirty socks from being in Brazils apartment all weekend, and then towel dried him in the bedroom.Oh!You smell so much better!I giggled as he shook, spraying me with tiny droplets of water.He stood up on his hind legs, covering my face with tiny puppy kisses.I missed you, too, little man.Pigeon?Travis asked, nervously knotting his fingers together.Yeah?I said, rubbing Toto with the fluffy yellow towel in my hands.I wanna do this.I want to fight in Vegas.No, I said, smiling at Totos happy face.He sighed.Youre not listening.Im gonna do it.Youll see in a few months that it was the right decision.I looked up at him.Youre going to work for Benny.He nodded nervously and then smiled.I just wanna take care of you, Pidge.Tears glossed my eyes, knowing he was resolved.I dont want anything bought with that money, Travis.I dont want anything to do with Benny or Vegas or anything that goes along with it.You didnt have a problem with the thought of buying a car with the money from my fights here.Thats different and you know it.He frowned.Its gonna be okay, Pidge.Youll see.I watched him for a moment, hoping for a glimmer of amusement in his eyes, waiting for him to tell me that he was joking.Uncertainty and greed reflected in his eyes.Why did you even ask me, Travis?You were going to work for Benny no matter what I said.I want your support on this, but its too much money to turn down.I would be crazy to say no.I sat for a moment, stunned.Once it had all sunk in, I nodded.Okay, then.Youve made your decision.Travis beamed.Youll see, Pigeon.Its going to be great.He pushed off the bed, walked over to me and kissed my fingers.Im starved.You hungry?I shook my head and he kissed my forehead before making his way to the kitchen.Once his footsteps left the hall, I pulled my clothes from their hangers, grateful that I had room in my suitcase for most of my belongings.Angry tears fell down my cheeks.I knew better than to take Travis to that place.I had fought tooth and nail to keep him from the dark edges of my life, and the moment the opportunity presented itself, I dragged him to the core of everything I hated without a second thought.Travis was going to be a part of that, and if he wouldnt let me save him, I had to save myself.The suitcase was filled to its limit, and I stretched the zipper over the bulging contents.I yanked it off the bed and down the hall, passing the kitchen without glancing in its direction.I hurried down the steps, relieved that America and Shepley were still kissing and laughing in the parking lot, transferring her things from his Charger to her Honda.Pigeon?Travis called from the doorway of the apartment.I touched Americas wrist.I need you to take me to Morgan, Mare.Whats going on?she said, noting the seriousness of the situation by my expression.I glanced behind me to see Travis jogging down the stairs and across the grass to where we stood.What are you doing?he said, gesturing to my suitcase.If Id told him in that moment, all hope of separating myself from Mick, and Vegas, and Benny, and everything I didnt want would be lost.Travis wouldnt let me leave, and by morning I would have convinced myself to accept his decision.I scratched my head and smiled, trying to buy some time to think of an excuse.Pidge?Im taking my stuff to Morgan.They have all those washers and dryers and I have a ridiculous amount of laundry to do.He frowned.You were going to leave without telling me?I glanced to America and then to Travis, struggling for the most believable lie.She was coming back in, Trav.Youre so freakin paranoid, America said with the dismissive smile she had used to deceive her parents so many times.Oh, he said, still unsure.You staying here tonight?he asked me, pinching the fabric of my coat.I dont know.I guess it depends on when my laundry gets done.Travis smiled, pulling me against him.In three weeks, Ill pay someone to do your laundry.Or you can just throw away your dirty clothes and buy new ones.Youre fighting for Benny again?America asked, shocked.He made me an offer I couldnt refuse.Travis, Shepley began.Dont you guys start on me, too.If Im not changing my mind for Pidge, Im not changing my mind for you.America met my eyes with understanding, Well, we better get you back, Abby.That pile of clothes is gonna take you forever.I nodded and Travis leaned down to kiss me.I pulled him closer, knowing it would be the last time I felt his lips against mine.See you later, he said.Love you.Shepley lifted my suitcase into the hatchback of the Honda, and America slid into her seat beside me.Travis folded his arms across his chest, chatting with Shepley as America switched on the ignition.You cant stay in your room tonight, Abby.Hes going to come straight there when he figures it out, America said as she slowly backed away from the parking block.Tears filled my eyes and spilled over, falling down my cheeks.I know.Travis cheerful expression changed when he saw the look on my face.He wasted no time jogging to my window.Whats wrong, Pidge?he said, tapping on the glass.Go, Mare, I said, wiping my eyes.I focused on the road ahead as Travis jogged alongside the car.Pigeon?America!Stop the fucking car!he yelled, slamming his palm against the glass.Abby, dont do this!he said, realization and fear distorting his expression.America turned onto the main road and pressed on the gas.Im never going to hear the end of this  just so you know.Im so, so sorry, Mare.She glanced into the rearview mirror and pushed her foot to the floor.Jesus Christ, Travis, she muttered under her breath.I turned to see him running at full speed behind us, vanishing and reappearing between the lights and shadows of the street lamps.After he reached the end of the block, he turned in the opposite direction, sprinting to the apartment.Hes going back to get his bike.Hes gonna follow us to Morgan and cause a huge scene.I closed my eyes.Justhurry.Ill sleep in your room tonight.Think Vanessa will mind?Shes never there.Hes really going to work for Benny?The word was stuck in my throat, so I simply nodded.America grabbed my hand and squeezed.Youre making the right decision, Abby.You cant go through that again.If he wont listen to you, hes not going to listen to anyone.My cell phone rang.I looked down to see Travis silly face, and then pressed ignore.Less than five seconds later, it rang again.I turned it off and shoved it into my purse.This is going to be a God awful fucking mess, I said, shaking my head and wiping my eyes.I dont envy your life for the next week or so.I cant imagine breaking up with someone that refuses to stay away.You know thats how its going to be, right?We pulled into the parking lot at Morgan, and America held open the door as I lugged my suitcase in.We rushed to her room and I puffed, waiting for her to unlock her door.She held it open and then tossed me the key.Hes going to end up getting arrested or something, she said.She ran down the hall and I watched her rush across the parking lot from the window, getting in her car just as Travis pulled up on his bike beside her.He ran around to the passenger side and yanked open the door, looking to Morgans doors when he realized I wasnt in the car.America backed out while Travis ran into the building, and I turned, watching the door.Down the hall, Travis pounded on my door, calling my name.I had no idea if Kara was there, but if she was, I felt bad for what she would have to endure for the next few minutes until Travis accepted that I wasnt in my room.Pidge?Open the fucking door, dammit!Im not leaving until you talk to me!Pigeon!he yelled, banging on the door so loudly the entire building could have heard.I cringed when I heard Karas mousy voice.What?she growled.I pressed my ear against the door, struggling to hear Travis low murmurs.I didnt have to strain for long.I know shes here!he yelled.Pigeon?Shes notHey!Kara squealed.The door cracked against the cement block wall of our room and I knew that Travis had forced his way in.After a full minute of silence, I heard Travis yell down the hall.Pigeon!Where is she?I havent seen her!Kara shouted, angrier than Id ever heard her.The door slammed shut and sudden nausea overwhelmed me as I waited for what Travis would do next.After several minutes of quiet, I cracked open the door, peering down the wide hallway.Travis sat with his back against the wall with his hands covering his face.I shut the door as quietly as I could, worrying the campus police had been called.After an hour, I glanced down the hall again.Travis hadnt moved.I checked twice more during the night, finally falling asleep around four.I purposefully overslept, knowing I would be skipping my classes that day.I turned on my phone to check my messages, seeing that Travis had flooded my inbox.The endless texts hed sent me through the night varied from apologies to rants.I called America in the afternoon, hoping Travis hadnt confiscated her cell phone.When she answered, I sighed.Hey.America kept her voice low.I havent told Shepley where you are.I dont want him in the middle of this.Travis is crazy pissed at me right now.Im probably staying at Morgan tonight.If Travis hasnt calmed downgood luck getting any sleep here.He made an Oscar worthy performance in the hall last night.Im surprised no one called security.He was kicked out of History today.When you didnt show, he kicked over both of your desks.Shep heard that he waited for you after all of your classes.Hes losin it, Abby.I told him you were done the second he made the decision to work for Benny.I cant believe he thought for a single second you would be okay with that.I guess Ill see you when you get here.I dont think I can go to my room, yet.America and I were roommates over the next week, and she made sure to keep Shepley clear of me so he wouldnt be tempted to tell Travis of my whereabouts.It was a full time job evading a run in with him.I avoided the cafeteria at all costs, History class, and I played it safe by leaving my classes early.I knew that I would have to talk to Travis sometime, but I couldnt until he had calmed down enough to accept my decision.I sat alone Friday night, laying in bed, holding the phone to my ear.I rolled my eyes when my stomach growled.I can come pick you up and take you somewhere for dinner, America said.I flipped through my History book, skipping over where Travis had doodled and scribbled love notes in the margins.No, its your first night with Shep in almost a week, Mare.Im just going to pop over to the cafeteria.You sure?Yeah.Tell Shep I said hi.I walked slow to the cafeteria, in no hurry to suffer the stares of those at the tables.The entire school was abuzz with the breakup, and Travis volatile behavior didnt help.Just when the lights of the cafeteria came into view, I saw a dark figure approach.Pigeon?Startled, I jerked to a stop.Travis walked into the light, unshaven and pale.Jesus, Travis!You scared the hell out of me!If you would answer your phone when I call I wouldnt have to sneak around in the dark.You look like hell, I said.Ive been through there once or twice this week.I tightened my arms around me.Im actually on my way to grab something to eat.Ill call you later, okay?No.We have to talk.Trav.I turned Benny down.I called him Wednesday and told him no.There was hopeful glimmer in his eyes, but it disappeared when he registered my expression.I dont know what you want me to say, Travis.Say you forgive me.Say youll take me back.I clenched my teeth together, forbidding myself to cry.I cant.Travis face crumpled and I took the opportunity to walk around him, but he side stepped to stand in my way.I havent slept, or ateI cant concentrate.I know you love me.Everything will be the way it used to be if youd just take me back.I closed my eyes.We are dysfunctional, Travis.I think youre just obsessed with the thought of owning me more than anything else.Thats not true.I love you more than my life, Pigeon, he said, hurt.Thats exactly what I mean.Thats crazy talk.Its not crazy.Its the truth.Okayso what exactly is the order for you?Is it money, me, your lifeor is there something that comes before money?I realize what Ive done, okay?I see where youd think that, but if Id known that you were gonna leave me, I would have neverI just wanted to take care of you.Youve said that.Please dont do this.I cant stand feeling like thisitsits killin me, he said, exhaling as if the air had been knocked out of him.Im done, Travis.He winced.Dont say that.Its over.Go home.His eyebrows pulled in.Youre my home.His words cut me, and my chest tightened so much that it was hard to breathe.You made your choice, Trav.Ive made mine, I said, inwardly cursing the quivering in my voice.Im going to stay the hell out of Vegas, and away from BennyIm going to finish school.But I need you.I need you.Youre my best friend.His voice was desperate and broken, matching his expression.In the dim light I could see a tear fall from his eye, and in the next moment he reached out for me and I was in his arms, his lips on mine.He squeezed me tight against his chest as he kissed me, and then cradled my face in his hands, pressing his lips harder against my mouth, desperate to get a reaction.Kiss me, he whispered, sealing his mouth on mine.I kept my eyes and mouth closed, relaxing in his arms.It took everything I had not to move my mouth with his, having longed for his lips all week.Kiss me!he begged.Please, Pigeon!I told him no!When I felt hot tears searing down my cold face, I shoved him away.Leave me alone, Travis!I had only made it a few feet when he grabbed my wrist.My arm was straight, outstretched behind me.I didnt turn around.I am begging you.My arm lowered and tugged as he fell to his knees.Im begging you, Abby.Dont do this.I turned to see his agonized expression, and then my eyes drifted down my arm to his, seeing my name in thick black letters on his flexed wrist.I looked away, toward the cafeteria.He had proven to me what I had been afraid of all along.As much as he loved me, when money was involved, I would be second.Just like I was with Mick.If I gave in, he would either change his mind about Benny, or he would resent me every time money could have made his life easier.I imagined him in a blue collar job, coming home with the same look in his eyes that Mick had when he returned after a night of bad luck.It would be my fault that his life wasnt what he wanted it to be, and I couldnt let my future be plagued with the bitterness and regret that I left behind.Let me go, Travis.After several moments he finally released my arm.I ran to the glass door, yanking it open without looking back.Everyone in the room stared at me as I walked toward the buffet, and just as I reached my destination, heads angled to see outside the windows where Travis was on his knees, palms flat on the pavement.The sight of him on the ground made the tears Id been holding back rush down my face.I passed the stacks of plates and trays, dashing down the hall to the bathrooms.It was bad enough that everyone had witnessed the scene between me and Travis.I couldnt let them see me cry.I cowered in the stall for an hour, bawling uncontrollably until I heard a tiny knock on the door.Abby?I sniffed.What are you doing in here, Finch?Youre in the girls bathroom.Kara saw you come in and came to the dorms to get me.Let me in, he said in a soft voice.I shook my head.I knew he couldnt see me, but I couldnt speak another word.I heard him sigh and then his palms slapped on the floor as he crawled under the stall.I cant believe youre making me do this, he said, pulling himself under with his hands.Youre going to be sorry you didnt open the door, because I just crawled along that piss covered floor and now Im going to hug you.I laughed once, and then my face compressed around my smile as Finch pulled me into his arms.My knees went out from under me, and Finch carefully lowered me to the floor, pulling me into his lap.Ssshh, he said, rocking me in his arms.He sighed and shook his head.Damn, girl.What am I gonna do with you?I doodled on the front of my notebook, making squares in squares, connecting them to each other to form rudimentary three D boxes.Ten minutes before class was to begin the classroom was still empty.Life was in the beginning stages of normal, but it still took me a few minutes to psych myself up to be around anyone other than Finch and America.Just because were not dating anymore, doesnt mean you cant wear the bracelet I bought you, Parker said as he slid into the desk beside me.Ive been meaning to ask you if you wanted it back.He smiled, leaning over to add a bow to the top of one of the boxes on the paper.It was a gift, Abs.I dont give gifts with conditions.Dr.Ballard flipped on her overhead as she took her seat at the head of the class, rummaging through papers on her cluttered desk.The room was suddenly abuzz with chatter, echoing against the large, rain spattered windows.I heard that you and Travis broke up a couple of weeks ago.Parker held up a hand seeing my impatient expression.Its none of my business.Youve just looked so sad, and I wanted to tell you that Im sorry.Thanks, I muttered, turning to a fresh page in my notebook.And I also wanted to apologize for my behavior before.What I said wasunkind.I was just angry and I lashed out at you.It wasnt fair, and Im sorry.Im not interested in dating, Parker, I warned.He chuckled.Im not trying to take advantage.Were still friends and I want to make sure that youre okay.Im okay.Are you going home for Thanksgiving break?Im going home with America.I usually have Thanksgiving at her house.Parker began to speak but Dr.Ballard began her lecture.The subject of Thanksgiving made me think of my previous plans to help Travis with a turkey.I thought about what that would have been like, and I found myself worrying that they would be ordering pizza yet again.A sinking feeling came over me.I instantly pushed it from my mind, trying my best to concentrate on Dr.Ballards every word.After class, my face flushed when I saw Travis jogging toward me from the parking lot.He was clean shaven again, wearing a hooded sweatshirt and his favorite red baseball cap, ducking his head away from the rain.Ill see you after break, Abs, Parker said, touching my back.I expected an angry glare from Travis, but he didnt seem to notice Parker as he approached.Hey, Pidge.I offered an awkward smile, and he shoved his hands into the front pocket of his sweatshirt.Shepley said youre going with him and Mare to Wichita tomorrow.Yeah?Youre spending the whole break at Americas?I shrugged, trying to seem casual.Im really close with her parents.What about your mom?Shes a drunk, Travis.She wont know its Thanksgiving.He was suddenly nervous, and my stomach wrenched with the possibility of a second public break up.Thunder rolled above us and Travis looked up, squinting as the large drops fell against his face.I need to ask you for a favor, he said.Cmere.He pulled me under the closest awning and I complied, trying to avoid another scene.What kind of favor?I asked, suspicious.My uh.He shifted his weight.Dad and the guys are still expecting you on Thursday.Travis!I whined.He looked at his feet.You said you would come.I know, butits a little inappropriate now, dont you think?He seemed unaffected.You said you would come.We were still together when I agreed to go home with you.You knew I wasnt going to come.I didnt know, and its too late, anyway.Thomas is flying in, and Tyler took off work.Everyones looking forward to seeing you.I cringed, twirling the damp strands of my hair around my finger.They were going to come, anyway, werent they?Not everyone.We havent had all of us there for Thanksgiving in years.They all made an effort to be there since I promised them a real meal.We havent had a woman in the kitchen since Mom died and,  Thats not sexist or anything,  He tilted his head.Thats not what I meant, Pidge, cmon.We all want you there.Thats all Im sayin.You havent told them about ushave you?I said in the most accusatory tone I could manage.He fidgeted for a moment, and then shook his head.Dad would ask why, and Im not ready to talk to him about it.Id never hear the end of how stupid I am.Please come, Pidge.I have to put the Turkey in at six in the morning.Wed have to leave here by five.Or we could stay there.My eyebrows shot up.No way!Its bad enough that Im going to have to lie to your family and pretend were still together.You act like Im asking you to light yourself on fire.You should have told them!I will.After ThanksgivingIll tell them.I sighed, looking away.If you promise me that this isnt some stunt to try and get back together, Ill do it.He nodded.I promise.Although he was trying to hide it, I could see a spark in his eyes.I pressed my lips together, trying not to smile.Ill see you at five.Travis leaned down to kiss my cheek, his lips lingering on my skin.Thanks, Pigeon.America and Shepley met me at the door of the cafeteria and we walked in together.I yanked the silverware from its holder and then dropped my plate on the tray.Whats with you, Abby?America asked.Im not coming with you guys tomorrow.Shepleys mouth fell open.Youre going to the Maddoxs?Americas eyes darted to mine.Youre what?I sighed and shoved money at the cashier.I promised Trav Id go when we were on the plane, and he told them all Id be there.In his defense, Shepley began, he really didnt think you guys were gonna break up.He thought youd come around.It was too late by the time he figured out that you were serious.Thats bullshit, Shep and you know it, America seethed.You dont have to go if you dont want to, Abby.She was right.It wasnt as if I didnt have a choice.But I couldnt do that to Travis.Not even if I hated him.And I didnt.If I dont go, hell have to explain to them why I didnt show, and I dont want to ruin his Thanksgiving.Theyre all coming home thinking Im going to be there.Shepley smiled, They all really like you, Abby.Jim was just talking to my dad about you the other day.Great, I muttered.Abbys right, Baby, Shepley said.If she doesnt go, Jim will spend the day bitching at Trav.Theres no sense in ruining their day.America put her arm around my shoulders.You can still come with us.Youre not with him, anymore.You dont have to keep saving him.I know, Mare.But its the right thing to do.The sun melted into the buildings outside the window, and I stood in front of my mirror, brushing my hair while trying to decide how I was going to go about pretending with Travis.Its just one day, Abby.You can handle one day, I said to the mirror.Pretending had never been a problem for me; it was what was going to happen while we were pretending that I was worried about.When Travis dropped me off after dinner, I was going to have to make a decision.A decision that would be skewed by a false sense of happiness we would portray for his family.Knock, knock.I turned, looking at the door.Kara hadnt been back to our room all evening, and I knew that America and Shepley were already on the road.I couldnt imagine who it could be.I set my brush on the table and pulled open the door.Travis, I breathed.Are you ready?I raised an eyebrow.Ready for what?You said pick you up at five.I folded my arms across my chest.I meant five in the morning!Oh, Travis said, seeming disappointed.I guess I should call Dad and let him know we wont be staying after all.Travis!I wailed.I brought Sheps car so we didnt have to deal with our bags on the bike.Theres a spare bedroom you can crash in.We can watch a movie or,  Im not staying at your dads!His face fell.Okay.Ill uhIll see you in the morning.He took a step back and I shut the door, leaning against it.Every emotion I had weaved in and out of my insides, and I heaved an exasperated sigh.With Travis disappointed expression fresh on my mind, I pulled open the door and stepped out, seeing that he was slowly walking down the hall, dialing his phone.Travis, wait.He flipped around and the hopeful look in his eyes made my chest ache.Give me a minute to pack a few things.A relieved, appreciative smile spread across his face and he followed me to my room, watching me shove a few things in a bag from the doorway.I still love you, Pidge.I didnt look up.Dont.Im not doing this for you.He sucked in a breath.I know.We rode in silence to his dads house.The car felt charged with nervous energy, and it was hard to sit still against the cold leather seats.Once we arrived, Trenton and Jim walked out onto the porch, all smiles.Travis carried our bags from the car, and Jim patted his back.Good to see ya, Son.His smiled broadened when he looked at me.Abby Abernathy.Were looking forward to dinner tomorrow.Its been a long time sinceWell.Its been a long time.I nodded and followed Travis into the house.Jim rested his hand on his protruding belly and grinned.I set you two up in the guest bedroom, Trav.I didnt figure you would wanna fight with the twin in your room.I looked to Travis.It was difficult watching him struggle to speak.Abbys uhshes going to uhgoing to take the guest room.Im going to crash in mine.Trenton made a face.Why?Shes been staying at your apartment, hasnt she?Not lately, he said, desperately trying to avoid the truth.Jim and Trenton traded glances.Thomas room has been storage for years now, so I was going to let him take your room.I guess he can sleep on the couch, Jim said, looking to the ratty, discolored cushions in the living room.Dont worry about it, Jim.We were just trying to be respectful, I smiled, touching him arm.His laughter bellowed throughout the house, and he patted my hand.Youve met my sons, Abby.You should know its damn near impossible to offend me.Travis nodded toward the stairs, and I followed him.He pushed open the door with his foot and sat our bags on the floor, looking at the bed and then turning to me.The room was lined in brown paneling, the brown carpet beyond normal wear and tear.The walls were a dirty white, the paint peeling in places.I saw only one frame on the wall, enclosed was a picture of Jim and Travis mother.The background was a generic portrait studio blue, sporting feathered hair and young, smiling faces.It must have been taken before they had the boys, neither of them could have been older than twenty.Im sorry, Pidge.Ill sleep on the floor.Damn straight you will, I said, pulling my hair into a ponytail.I cant believe I let you talk me into this.He sat on the bed and rubbed his face in frustration.This is going to be a fucking mess.I dont know what I was thinking.I know exactly what you were thinking.Im not stupid, Travis.He looked up at me and smiled.But you still came.I have to get everything ready for tomorrow, I said, opening the door.Travis stood up.Ill help you.We peeled a mountain of potatoes, cut up vegetables, set out the turkey to thaw, and started the pie crusts.The first hour was more than uncomfortable, but when the twins arrived, everyone seemed to congregate in the kitchen.Jim told stories about each of his boys, and we laughed about tales of earlier disastrous Thanksgivings when they attempted to do something other than order pizza.Diane was a hell of a cook, Jim mused.Trav doesnt remember, but there was no sense trying after she passed.No pressure, Abby, Trenton chuckled, grabbing a beer from the fridge.Lets get out the cards.I want to try to make back some of my money that Abby took.Jim waved his finger at his son.No poker this weekend, Trent.I brought down the dominoes, go set those up.No betting, dammit.I mean it.Trenton shook his head.All right, old man, all right.Travis brothers meandered from the kitchen, and Trent followed, stopping to look back.Cmon, Trav.Im helping Pidge.Theres not much more to do, Baby, I said.Go ahead.His eyes softened at my words, and he touched my hip.You sure?I nodded and he leaned over to kiss my cheek, squeezing my hip with his fingers before following Trenton into the game room.Jim watched his sons file out of the doorway, shaking his head and smiling.This is incredible what youre doing, Abby.I dont think you realize how much we all appreciate it.It was Travs idea.Im glad I could help.His large frame settled against the counter, taking a swig of his beer while he pondered his next words.You and Travis havent talked much.You having problems?I squeezed the dish soap into the sink as it filled with hot water, trying to think of something to say that wasnt a bald faced lie.Things are a little different, I guess.Thats what I thought.You have to be patient with him.Travis doesnt remember much about it, but he was close to his mom, and after we lost her he was never the same.I thought hed grow out of it, you know, with him being so young.It was hard on all of us, but Travhe quit trying to love people after that.I was surprised that he brought you here.The way he acts around you, the way he looks at you; I knew you were somethin special.I smiled, but kept my eyes on the dishes I was scrubbing.Travisll have a hard time.Hes going to make a lot of mistakes.He grew up around a bunch of motherless boys and a lonely, grouchy old man for a father.We were all a little lost after Diane died, and I guess I didnt help the boys cope the way I should have.I know its hard not to blame him, but you have to love him, anyway, Abby.Youre the only woman hes loved besides his mother.I dont know what itll do to him if you left him, too.I swallowed back the tears and nodded, unable to reply.Jim rested his hand on my shoulder and squeezed.Ive never seen him smile the way he does when hes with you.I hope all my boys have an Abby one day.His footsteps faded down the hallway and I gripped the edge of the sink, trying to catch my breath.I knew spending the holiday with Travis and his family would be difficult, but I didnt think my heart would be broken all over again.The men joked and laughed in the next room as I washed and dried the dishes, putting them away.I cleaned the kitchen and then washed my hands, making my way to the stairs for the night.Travis grabbed my hand.Its early, Pidge.Youre not going to bed, are ya?Its been a long day.Im tired.We were getting ready to watch a movie.Why dont you come back down and hang out?I looked up the stairs and then down to his hopeful smile.Okay.He led me by the hand to the couch, and we sat together as the opening credits rolled.Shut of that light, Taylor, Jim ordered.Travis reached his arm above me, resting his arm on the back of the couch.He was trying to keep up pretenses while appeasing me.He had been very careful not to take advantage of the situation, and I found myself conflicted, both grateful and disappointed.Sitting so close to him, smelling the mixture of tobacco and his cologne, it was very difficult for me to keep my distance, both physically and emotionally.Just as I had feared, my resolve was wavering and I struggled to block out everything Jim had said in the kitchen.Half way through the movie, the front door flew open and Thomas rounded the corner, bags in hand.Happy Thanksgiving!he said, setting his luggage on the floor.Jim stood up and hugged his oldest son, and everyone but Travis stood to greet him.Youre not going to say hi to Thomas?I whispered.He didnt look at me when he spoke, watching his family hug and laugh.I got one night with you.Im not going to waste a second of it.Hi there, Abby.Its good to see you again, Thomas smiled.Travis touched my knee with his hand and I looked down, and then to Travis.Noticing my expression, Travis took his hand off my leg and interlocked his fingers in his lap.Uh oh.Trouble in paradise?Thomas asked.Shut up, Tommy, Travis grumbled.The mood in the room shifted, and I felt all eyes on me, waiting for an explanation.I smiled nervously and took Travis hand into both of mine.Were just tired.Weve been working all evening on the food, I said, leaning my head against Travis shoulder.He looked down at our hands and then squeezed, his eyebrows pulling in a bit.Speaking of tired, Im exhausted, I breathed.Im gonna head to bed, Baby.I looked to everyone else.Good night, guys.Night, Sis, Jim said.Travis brothers all bid me goodnight, and I headed up the stairs.Im gonna turn in, too, I heard Travis say.I bet you are, Trenton teased.Lucky bastard, Tyler grumbled.Hey.Were not going to talk about your sister like that, Jim warned.My stomach sank.The only real family Id had in years was Americas parents, and although Mark and Pam had always looked out for me with true kindness, they were borrowed.The six unruly, foul mouthed, loveable men downstairs had welcomed me with open arms, and tomorrow I would tell them goodbye for the last time.Travis caught the bedroom door before it closed and then froze.Did you want me to wait in the hall while you dressed for bed?Im going to hop in the shower.Ill just get dressed in the bathroom.He rubbed the back of his neck.All right.Ill make a pallet, then.I nodded, making my way to the bathroom.I scrubbed myself raw in the dilapidated shower, focusing on the water stains and soap scum to fight the overwhelming dread I felt for both the night and the morning.When I returned to the bedroom, Travis dropped a pillow on the floor on his make shift bed.He offered a weak smile before leaving me to take a turn in the shower.I crawled into bed, pulling the covers to my chest, trying to ignore the blankets on the floor.When Travis returned, he stared at the pallet with the same sadness that I did, and then turned off the light, situating himself on his pillow.It was quiet for a few minutes, and then I heard Travis heave a miserable sigh.This is our last night together, isnt it?I waited a moment, trying to think of the right thing to say.I dont wanna fight, Trav.Just go to sleep.Hearing him shift, I turned onto my side to look down at him, pressing my cheek into the pillow.He supported his head with his hand and stared into my eyes.I love you.I watched him for a moment.You promised.I promised this wasnt a stunt to get back together.It wasnt.He reached up his hand to touch mine.But if it meant being with you again, I cant say I wouldnt consider it.I care about you.I dont want you to hurt, but I should have followed my gut in the first place.It wouldve never worked.You did love me, though, right?I pressed my lips together.I still do.His eyes glossed over and he squeezed my hand.Can I ask you for a favor?Im sort of in the middle of the last thing you asked me to do, I smiled.His features were taught, unaffected by my expression.If this is really itif youre really done with mewill you let me hold you tonight?I dont think its a good idea, Trav.His hand gripped tight over mine.Please?I cant sleep knowing youre just a foot away, and Im never gonna get the chance again.I stared into his desperate eyes for a moment and then frowned.Im not having sex with you.He shook his head.Thats not what Im asking.I searched the dimly lit room with my eyes, thinking about the consequences, wondering if I could tell Travis no if he changed his mind.I shut my eyes tight and then pushed away from the edge of the bed, turning down the blanket.He crawled in bed beside me, hastily pulling me tight into his arms.His bare chest rose and fell with uneven breaths, and I cursed myself for feeling so peaceful against his skin.Im going to miss this, I said.He kissed my hair and pulled me to him, unable to get close enough to me.He buried his face into my neck and I rested my hand on his back in comfort, although I was just as heartbroken as he was.He sucked in a breath, and pressed his forehead against my neck, pressing his fingers into the skin of my back.As miserable as we were the last night of the bet, this was much, much worse.II dont think I can do this, Travis.He pulled me tighter and I felt the first tear fall from my eye down my temple.I cant do this, I said, clenching my eyes shut.Then dont, he said against my skin.Give me another chance.I tried to push myself out from under him, but his grip was too solid for any possibility of escape.I covered my face with both hands as my quiet sobs shook us both.Travis looked up at me, his eyes heavy and wet.With his large, gentle fingers, he pulled my hand away from my eyes and kissed my palm.I took a staggered breath as he looked at my lips and then back to my eyes.Ill never love anyone the way I love you, Pigeon.I sniffed and touched his face.I cant.I know, he said, his voice broken.I never once convinced myself that I was good enough for you.My face crumpled and I shook my head.Its not just you, Trav.Were not good for each other.He shook his head, wanting to say something, but thinking better of it.After a long, deep breath, he rested his head against my chest.When the green numbers on the clock across the room read eleven oclock, Travis breaths finally slowed and evened out.My eyes grew heavy, and I blinked a few times before slipping out of consciousness.Ow!I yelped, pulling my hand from the stove and automatically nursing the burn in my mouth.You okay, Pidge?Travis asked, shuffling across the floor and slipping a t shirt over his head.Shit!The floors fucking freezing!I stifled a giggle as I watched him hop on one foot and then the other until the soles of his feet acclimated to the frigid tile.The sun barely peeked through the blinds, and the rest of the Maddoxs were sleeping soundly in their beds.I pushed the antique tin pan further into the oven and then closed the door, turning to cool my fingers under the sink.You can go back to bed.I just had to put the turkey in.Are you coming to bed?he asked, wrapping his arms around his chest to ward off the chill in the air.Yeah.Lead the way, he said, sweeping his hand toward the stairs.Travis yanked his shirt off as we both shoved our legs under the covers, pulling the blanket up to our necks.He tightened his arms around me as we shivered, waiting for our body heat to warm the small space between our skin and the covers.I felt his lips against my hair, and then his throat moved when he spoke.Look, Pidge.Its snowing.I turned to face the window.The white flakes were only visible in the glow of the street lamp.It kind of feels like Christmas, I said, my skin finally warming up against his.He sighed and I turned to see his expression.What?You wont be here for Christmas.Im here, now.He pulled his mouth up on one side and leaned down to kiss my lips.I leaned back and shook my head.Trav.His grip tightened and he lowered his chin, his chestnut eyes determined.Ive got less than twenty four hours with you, Pidge.Im gonna kiss you.Im gonna kiss you a lot today.All day.Every chance I get.If you want me to stop, just say the word, but until you do, Im going make every second of my last day with you count.Travis, I thought about it for a moment, and I reasoned that he was under no disillusionment about what would happen when he took me home.I had come there to pretend, and as hard as it would be for us both later, I didnt want to tell him no.When he noticed me staring at his lips, the corner of his mouth turned up again, and he leaned down to press his soft mouth against mine.It began sweet and innocent, but the moment his lips parted, I caressed his tongue with mine.His body instantly tensed, and he took a deep breath in through his nose, pressing himself against me.I let my knee fall to the side and he moved above me, never taking his mouth from mine.He wasted no time undressing me, and when there was no more fabric between us, he gripped the iron vines of the headboard with both hands, and in one quick movement, he was inside me.I bit my lip hard, stifling the cry that was clawing its way up my throat.Travis moaned against my mouth, and I pressed my feet against the mattress, anchoring myself so I could raise my hips to meet his.One hand on the iron and the other on the nape of my neck, he rocked against me over and over, and my legs quivered with his firm, determined movements.His tongue searched my mouth, and I could feel the vibration of his deep groans against my chest as he kept to his promise to make our last day together memorable.I could spend a thousand years trying to block that moment from my memory, and it would still be burned into my mind.An hour had passed when I clenched my eyes shut, my every nerve focused on the shuddering of my insides.Travis held his breath as he thrust inside me one last time, I collapsed against the mattress, completely spent.Travis heaved with deep breaths, speechless and dripping with sweat.I could hear voices downstairs and I covered my mouth, giggling at our misbehavior.Travis turned on his side, scanning my face with his soft, brown eyes.You said you were just going to kiss me, I grinned.As I lay next to his bare skin, seeing the unconditional love in his eyes, I let go of my disappointment, and my anger, and my stubborn resolve.I loved him, and no matter what my reasons were to live without him, I knew it wasnt what I wanted.Even if I hadnt changed my mind, it was impossible for us to stay away from each other.Why dont we just stay in bed all day?he smiled.I came here to cook, remember?No, you came here to help me cook, and I dont report for duty for another eight hours.I touched his face, the urge to end our suffering had become unbearable.When I told him I had changed my mind and that things were back to normal, we wouldnt have to spend the day pretending.We could spend it celebrating instead.Travis, I think we.Dont say it, okay?I dont want to think about it until I have to.He stood up and pulled on his boxers, walking over to my bag.He tossed my clothes on the bed and then yanked his shirt over his head.I want to remember this as a good day.I made eggs for breakfast and sandwiches for lunch, and when the game began, I started dinner.Travis stood behind me at every opportunity, his arms wrapped around my waist, his lips on my neck.I caught myself glancing at the clock, eager to find a moment alone with him to tell him my decision.I was anxious to see the look on his face, and to get back to where we were.The day was filled with laughter, conversation, and a steady stream of complaints from Tyler about Travis constant display of affection.Get a room, Travis!Jesus!Tyler groaned.You are turning a hideous shade of green, Thomas teased.Its because theyre making me sick.Im not jealous, douchebag, Tyler sneered.Leave em alone, Ty, Jim warned.When we sat down for dinner, Jim insisted on Travis carving the turkey, and I smiled as he proudly stood up to comply.I was a bit nervous until the compliments washed in.By the time I served the pie, there wasnt a morsel of food left on the table.Did I make enough?I laughed.Jim smiled, pulling his fork through his lips to get ready for dessert.You made plenty, Abby.We just wanted to tide ourselves over until next yearunless youd like to do this all over again at Christmas.Youre a Maddox, now.I expect you at every holiday, and not to cook.I glanced over at Travis whose smiled had faded, and my heart sank.I had to tell him soon.Thanks, Jim.Dont tell her that, Dad, Trenton said.Shes gotta cook.I havent had a meal like this since I was five!He shoveled half a slice of pecan pie into his mouth, humming with satisfaction.I felt at home, sitting at a table full of men that were leaning back in their chairs, rubbing their full bellies.Emotion overwhelmed me when I fantasized about Christmas, and Easter, and every other holiday I would spend at that table.I wanted nothing more than to be a part of this broken, loud family that I adored.When the pies were gone, Travis brothers began to clear the table and the twins manned the sink.Ill do that, I said, standing.Jim shook his head.No you dont.The boys can take care of it.You just take Travis to the couch and relax.Youve worked hard, Sis.The twins splashed each other with dish water and Trenton cussed when he slipped on a puddle and dropped a plate.Thomas chastised his brothers, getting the broom and dustpan to sweep up the glass.Jim patted his sons on the shoulders, and then hugged me before retreating to his room for the night.Travis pulled my legs onto his lap and slipped off my shoes, massaging the soles of my feet with his thumbs.I leaned my head back and sighed.This was the best Thanksgiving weve had since Mom died.I pulled my head up to see his expression.He was smiling, but it was tinged with sadness.Im glad I was here to see it.Travis expression changed and I braced myself for what he was about to say.My heart pounded against my chest, hoping he would ask me back so I could say yes.Las Vegas seemed like a lifetime ago, sitting in the home of my new family.Im different.I dont know what happened to me in Vegas.That wasnt me.I was thinking about everything we could buy with that money, and that was all I was thinking about.I didnt see how much it hurt you for me to want to take you back there, but deep down, I think I knew.I deserved for you to leave me.I deserved all the sleep I lost and the pain Ive felt.I needed all that to realize how much I need you, and what Im willing to do to keep you in my life.I chewed on my lip, impatient to get to the part where I said yes.I wanted him to take me back to the apartment and spend the rest of the night celebrating.I couldnt wait to relax on his new couch with Toto, watching movies and laughing like we used to.You said youre done with me, and I accept that.Im a different person since I met you.Ive changedfor the better.But no matter how hard I try, I cant seem to do right by you.We were friends first, and I cant lose you, Pigeon.I will always love you, but if I cant make you happy, it doesnt make much sense for me to try to get you back.I cant imagine being with anyone else, but Ill be happy as long as were friends.You want to be friends?I asked, the words burning in my mouth.I want you to be happy.Whatever that takes.My insides wrenched at his words, and I was surprised at the overpowering pain I felt.He was giving me an out, and it was exactly when I didnt want it.I could have told him that I had changed my mind and he would take back everything hed just said, but I knew that it wasnt fair to either of us to hold on just when he had let go.I smiled to fight the tears.Fifty bucks says youll be thanking me for this when you meet your future wife.Traviss eyebrows pulled together as his face fell.Thats an easy bet.The only woman Id ever wanna marry just broke my heart.I couldnt fake a smile after that.I wiped my eyes and then stood up.I think its time you took me home.Cmon, Pigeon.Im sorry, that wasnt funny.Its not that, Trav.Im just tired, and Im ready to go home.He sucked in a breath and nodded, standing up.I hugged his brothers goodbye, and asked Trenton to say goodbye to Jim for me.Travis stood at the door with our bags as they all agreed to come home for Christmas, and I held my smile long enough to get out the door.When Travis walked me to Morgan, his face was still sad, but the torment was gone.The weekend wasnt a stunt to get me back after all.It was closure.He leaned over to kiss my cheek and held the door open for me, watching as I walked inside.Thanks for today.You dont know how happy you made my family.I stopped at the bottom of the stairs.Youre going to tell them tomorrow, arent you?He looked out to the parking lot and then at me.Im pretty sure they already know.Youre not the only one with a poker face, Pidge.I stared at him, stunned, and for the first time since Id met him, he walked away from me without looking back.Finals were a curse for everyone but me.I kept busy, studying with Kara and America in my room and at the library.When the schedules changed for tests, I only saw Travis in passing.I went home with America for winter break, thankful that Shepley had stayed with Travis so I wouldnt suffer their constant displays of affection.The last four days of break I caught a cold, giving me a good reason to stay in bed.Travis said he wanted to be friends, but he hadnt called.It was a relief to have a few days to wallow in self pity.I wanted to get it out of my system before returning to school.The return trip to Eastern seemed to take years.I was eager to start the Spring semester, but I was far more eager to see Travis again.Although I noticed in the few times Id seen him that he was impervious to the hoards of girls that approached him after news of our break up, he seemed content with our new friendship.We had spent almost a month apart, leaving me nervous and unsure about how to act around him.The first day back, a fresh energy had swept over the campus along with a blanket of snow.New classes and new classmates meant new friends and a new beginning.I didnt have a single class with Travis, Parker, Shepley or America, but Finch was in all but one of mine.I anxiously waited for Travis at lunch, but when he came in he simply winked at me and then sat at the end of the table with the rest of his frat brothers.I tried to concentrate on America and Finchs conversation about the last football game of the season, but Travis voice kept catching my attention.He was regaling tales of his adventures and brushes with the law hed had over break, and news of Trentons new girlfriend theyd met one night while they were at The Red Door.I braced myself for mention of any girl hed brought home or met, but if he had, he wasnt sharing it with his friends.Red and gold metallic balls still hung from the ceiling of the cafeteria, blowing with the current of the heaters.I pulled my cardigan around me, and Finch noticed, hugging me to him and rubbing my arm.I knew that I was paying far too much attention to Travis general direction, waiting for him to look up at me, but he seemed to have forgotten that I was sitting at the table.Once he finished his lunch, my heart fluttered when he walked up behind me and rested his hands on my shoulders.Hows your classes, Shep?he asked.Shepleys face pinched.First day sucks.Hours of syllabi and class rules.I dont even know why I show up the first week.How about you?Ehits all part of the game.How bout you, Pidge?he asked.The same, I said, trying to keep my voice casual.Did you have a good break?he asked, playfully swaying me from side to side.Pretty good, I smiled.Sweet.Ive got another class.Later.I watched him make a bee line for the doors, shoving them both open, and then lighting a cigarette as he walked.Huh, America said in a high pitched tone.She watched Travis cut across the greens through the snow, and then shook her head.What, Baby?Shepley asked.America rested her chin on the heel of her hand, seeming vexed.That was kind of weird, wasnt it?How so?Shepley asked, flicking Americas blonde braid back to brush his lips across her neck.America smiled and leaned into his kiss.Hes almost normalas normal as Trav can be.Whats up with him?Shepley shook his head and shrugged.I dont know.Hes been that way for awhile.How backwards is that, Abby?Hes fine and youre miserable, America said, unconcerned with listening ears.Youre miserable?Shepley asked with a surprised expression.My mouth fell open and my face flamed with instant embarrassment.I am not!She pushed her salad around in the bowl.Well, hes damn near ecstatic.Drop it, Mare, I warned.She shrugged and took another bite.I think hes faking it.Shepley nudged her.America?You goin to the Valentines Day date party with me or what?Cant you ask me like a normal boyfriend?Nicely?I have asked yourepeatedly.You keep telling me to ask you later.She slumped in her chair, pouting.I dont wanna go without Abby.Shepleys face screwed with frustration.She was with Trav the whole time last time.You barely saw her.Quit being a baby, Mare, I said, throwing a stick of celery at her.Finch elbowed me.Id take you, Cupcake, but Im not into the frat boy thing, sorry.Thats actually a damn good idea, Shepley said, his eyes bright.Finch grimaced at the thought.Im not Sig Tau, Shep.Im not anything.Fraternitys are against my religion.Please, Finch?America asked.Dj vu, I grumbled.Finch looked at me from the corner of his eye and then sighed.Its nothing personal, Abby.I cant say Ive ever been on a datewith a girl.I know.I shook my head dismissively, waving away my deep embarrassment.Its fine.Really.I need you there, America said.We made a pact, remember?No parties alone.Youll hardly be alone, Mare.Quit being so dramatic, I said, already annoyed with the conversation.You want dramatic?I pulled a trash can beside your bed, held a box of Kleenex for you all night, and got up to get you cough medicine twice when you were sick over break!You owe me!I wrinkled my nose.I have kept your hair vomit free so many times, America Mason!You sneezed in my face!she said, pointing to her nose.I blew my bangs from my eyes.I could never argue with America when she was determined to get her way.Fine, I said through my teeth.Finch?I asked him with my best fake smile.Will you go to the stupid Sig Tau Valentines Date Party with me?Finch hugged me to his side.Yes.But only because you called it stupid.I walked with Finch to class after lunch, discussing the date party and how much we were both dreading it.We picked out a pair of desks in our Physiology class, and I shook my head when the professor began my fourth syllabi of the day.The snow began to fall again, drifting against the windows, politely begging entrance and then falling with disappointment to the ground.After class dismissed, a boy Id met only once at the Sig Tau house knocked on my desk as he walked by, winking.I offered a polite smile and then glanced over to Finch.He shot me a wry grin, and I gathered my book and laptop, shoving them into my backpack with little effort.I lugged my bag over my shoulders, and trudged to Morgan along the salted sidewalk.A small group of students had started a snowball fight on the greens, and Finch shuddered at the sight of them, covered in colorless powder.I wobbled my knee, keeping Finch company as he finished his cigarette.America scurried beside us, rubbing her bright green mittens together.Wheres Shep?I asked.He went home.Travis needed help with something, I guess.You didnt go with him?I dont live there, Abby.Only in theory, Finch winked at her.America rolled her eyes.I enjoy spending time with my boyfriend, so sue me.Finch flicked his cigarette into the snow.Im heading out, ladies.Ill see you at dinner?America and I nodded, smiling when Finch first kissed my cheek and then Americas.He stayed on the wet sidewalk, careful to stay in the middle so that he wouldnt miss and step into the snow.America shook her head at his efforts.He is ridiculous.Hes a Floridian, Mare.Hes not used to the snow.She giggled and pulled me toward the door.Abby!I turned to see Parker jogging past Finch.He stopped, catching his breath a moment before he spoke.His puffy grey coat heaved with each breath, and I chuckled at Americas curious stare as she watched him.I waswhew!I was going to ask you if you wanted to grab a bite to eat tonight.Oh.I uhI already told Finch Id eat with him.All right, its no big deal.I was just going to try that new burger place downtown.Everyones saying its really good.Maybe next time, I said, realizing my mistake.I hoped that he wouldnt take my flippant reply as a postponement.He nodded and shoved his hands in his pockets, quickly walking back the way he came.Kara was reading ahead in her brand new books, grimacing at America and I when we walked in.Her demeanor hadnt improved since wed returned from break.Before, I had spent so much at Travis that Karas insufferable comments and attitude were tolerable.Spending every evening and night with her during the two weeks before the semester ended, I was beginning to regret my decision not to room with America.Oh, Kara.How Ive missed you, America said.The feeling is mutual, Kara grumbled, keeping her eyes on her book.America chatted about her day and plans with Shepley for the weekend.We scoured the internet for funny videos, laughing so hard we were wiping away tears.Kara huffed a few times at our disruption, but we ignored her.I was grateful for Americas visit.The hours passed so quickly that I didnt spend a moment wondering if Travis had called until she decided to call it a night.America yawned and looked at her watch.Im going to bed, Abaw, shit!she said, snapping her fingers.I left my make up bag at Sheps.Thats not a tragedy, Mare, I said, still giggling from the latest video wed watched.It wouldnt be if I didnt have my birth control in there.Cmon.I have to go get it.Cant you just get Shepley to bring them?Travis has his car.Hes at the Red with Trent.I felt sick.Again?Why is he hanging out with Trent so much, anyway?America shrugged.Does it matter?Cmon!I dont want to run into Travis.Itll be weird.Do you ever listen to me?Hes not there, hes at the Red.
