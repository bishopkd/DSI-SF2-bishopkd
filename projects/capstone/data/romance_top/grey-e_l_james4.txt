I wonder what a diamond would look like twinkling there.I ask her why shes been exercising, keeping my voice low.Her breathing quickens.I needed time to think, she says.Think about what, Anastasia?You.And you decided that it was nice knowing me?Do you mean knowing me in the biblical sense?Her cheeks pink.I didnt think you were familiar with the Bible.I went to Sunday school, Anastasia.It taught me a great deal.Catechism.Guilt.And that God abandoned me long ago.I dont remember reading about nipple clamps in the Bible.Perhaps you were taught from a modern translation, she goads me, her eyes shining and provocative.Oh, that smart mouth.Well, I thought I should come and remind you how nice it was knowing me.The challenge is there in my voice, and now between us.Her mouth drops open in surprise, but I glide my fingers to her chin and coax it closed.What do you say to that, Miss Steele?I whisper, as we stare at each other.Suddenly she launches herself at me.Shit.Somehow I grab her arms before she can touch me, and twist so that she lands on the bed, beneath me, and I have her arms stretched out above her head.Turning her face to mine, I kiss her, hard, my tongue exploring and reclaiming her.Her body rises in response as she kisses me back with equal ardor.Oh, Ana.What you do to me.Once shes squirming for more, I stop and gaze down at her.Its time for plan B.   Trust me?I ask, when her eyelids flutter open.She nods enthusiastically.From the back pocket of my pants I extract the tie so she can see it, then sit astride her and, taking both of her offered wrists, bind her to one of the iron spindles of her bedstead.She wriggles beneath me, testing her bindings, but the tie holds fast.Shes not escaping.Thats better.I smile with relief because I have her where I want her.Now to undress her.Grabbing her right foot, I start to undo her sneakers.No, she grumbles with embarrassment, trying to withdraw her foot, and I know its because shes been running and she doesnt want me to remove her shoes.Does she think perspiration would put me off?Sweetheart!If you struggle, Ill tie your feet, too.If you make a noise, Anastasia, I will gag you.Keep quiet.Katherine is probably outside listening right now.She stops.And I know that my instincts are right.Shes worried about her feet.When will she understand that none of that stuff bothers me?Quickly I remove her shoes, socks, and sweatpants.Then shift her so shes stretched out and lying on her sheets, and not that dainty, homemade quilt.Were going to make a mess.Stop biting that fucking lip.I brush my finger over her mouth as a carnal warning.She purses her lips in the semblance of a kiss, prompting my smile.Shes a beautiful, sensual creature.Now that shes where I want her, I take my shoes and socks off, undo the top button of my pants, and remove my shirt.She doesnt take her eyes off me.I think youve seen too much.I want to keep her guessing, and not knowing whats coming next.It will be a carnal treat.Ive not blindfolded her before, so this will count toward her training.Thats if she says yes  Sitting astride her once more, I grab the hem of her T shirt and roll it up her body.But rather than taking it off, I leave it rolled over her eyes: an effective blindfold.She looks fantastic, laid out and bound.Mmm, this just gets better and better.Im going to get a drink, I whisper, and kiss her.She gasps as I climb off the bed.Outside her room, I leave her door slightly ajar and enter the living room to retrieve the bottle of wine.Kavanagh looks up from where shes sitting on the sofa, reading, and her eyebrows rise in surprise.Dont tell me youve never seen a shirtless man, Kavanagh, because I wont believe you.Kate, where would I find glasses, ice, and a corkscrew?I ask, ignoring her scandalized expression.Um.In the kitchen.Ill get them for you.Wheres Ana?Ah, some concern for her friend.Good.Shes a little tied up at the moment, but she wants a drink.I grab the bottle of chardonnay.Oh, I see, Kavanagh says, and I follow her into the kitchen, where she points to some glasses on the counter.All the glasses are out, I assume to be packed for their move.She hands me a corkscrew and from the fridge she removes a tray of ice and breaks out the ice cubes.We still have to pack in here.You know Elliot is helping us move.Her tone is critical.Is he?I sound uninterested as I open the wine.Just put the ice in the glasses.With my chin I indicate two glasses.Its a chardonnay.Itll be more drinkable with the ice.I figured you for a red wine kind of guy, she says, when I pour the wine.Are you going to come and help Ana with the move?Her eyes flash.Shes challenging me.Shut her down now, Grey.No.I cant.My voice is clipped, because shes pissing me off, trying to make me feel guilty.Her lips thin, and I turn around to leave the kitchen, but not before I catch the disapproval in her face.Fuck off, Kavanagh.No way am I going to help.Ana and I dont have that kind of relationship.Besides, I cant spare the time.I return to Anas room and shut the door behind me, blotting out Kavanagh and her disdain.Immediately Im appeased by the sight of the enchanting Ana Steele, breathless and waiting, on her bed.Setting the wine down on her bedside table, I take the foil packet out of my pants and place it beside the wine, then drop my pants and underwear on the floor, freeing my erection.I take a sip of winesurprisingly, its not badand gaze down at Ana.She hasnt said a word.Her face is turned toward me, her lips parted with anticipation.Taking the glass, I sit astride her once more.Are you thirsty, Anastasia?Yes, she whispers.Taking a sip of wine, I lean down and kiss her, pouring the wine into her mouth.She laps it up, and deep in her throat I hear a faint hum of appreciation.More?I ask.She nods, smiling, and I oblige.Lets not go too far; we know your capacity for alcohol is limited, Anastasia, I tease, and her mouth splits in the widest of grins.Leaning down, I let her have another drink from my mouth, and she wriggles beneath me.Is this nice?I ask, as I lay down beside her.She stills, all seriousness now, but her lips part as she inhales sharply.I take another swig of wine, this time with two ice cubes.When I kiss her, I push a small shard of ice between her lips, then lay a trail of icy kisses down her sweet smelling skin from her throat to her navel.There, I place the other shard, and a little wine.She sucks in a breath.Now you have to keep still.If you move, Anastasia, youll get wine all over the bed.My voice is low, and I kiss her again just above her navel.Her hips shift.Oh no.If you spill the wine, I will punish you, Miss Steele.She moans in response and pulls at the tie.All good things, Ana  I release each of her breasts from her bra so theyre supported by the underwire cups; her breasts are pert and vulnerable, just how I like them.Slowly I tease them both with my lips.How nice is this?I whisper, and blow gently on one nipple.Her mouth slackens in a silent Ah.Taking another piece of ice in my mouth, I slowly trace down her sternum to her nipple, circling a couple of times with the ice.She moans beneath me.Transferring the ice to my fingers, I continue to torture each nipple with cool lips and the remaining ice cube thats melting in my fingers.Whining and panting beneath me, shes tensing but managing to stay still.If you spill the wine, I wont let you come, I warn.Oh.Please.Christian.Sir.Please, she begs.Oh, to hear her use those words.Theres hope.This is not a no.I skim my fingers over her body toward her panties, teasing her soft skin.Suddenly her pelvis flexes, spilling the wine and the now melted ice from her navel.I move quickly to lap it up, kissing and sucking it off her body.Oh dear, Anastasia, you moved.What am I going to do to you?I slip my fingers into her panties and brush her clitoris as I do.Ah!she whines.Oh, baby, I whisper with reverence.Shes wet.Very wet.See.See how nice this is?I push my index and middle finger inside her and she trembles.Ready for me so soon, I murmur, and push my fingers slowly in and out of her, eliciting a long sweet moan.Her pelvis starts lifting to meet my fingers.Oh, she wants this.You are a greedy girl.My voice is still low and she matches the pace Im setting as I begin to circle her clitoris with my thumb, teasing and tormenting her.She cries out, her body bucking beneath me.I want to see her expression, and reaching up with my other hand, I slip her T shirt off her head.She opens her eyes, blinking in the soft light.I want to touch you, she says, her voice husky and full of need.I know, I breathe against her lips, and kiss her, all the while keeping up the relentless rhythm with my fingers and thumb.She tastes of wine and need and Ana.And she kisses me back with a hunger Ive not felt in her before.I cradle the top of her head, keeping her in place, and continue to kiss and finger fuck her.As her legs stiffen, I drop the pace of my hand.Oh, no, baby.Youre not coming yet.I do this three more times while kissing her warm, sweet mouth.The fifth time I still my fingers inside her, and I hum soft and slow in her ear, This is your punishment, so close and yet so far.Is this nice?Please, she whimpers.God, I love to hear her beg.How shall I fuck you, Anastasia?My fingers start again and her legs begin to quiver, and I gentle my hand once more.Please, she breathes again, the word so low I barely hear her.What do you want, Anastasia?Younow, she pleads.Shall I fuck you this way, or this way, or this way?Theres an endless choice, I murmur.Withdrawing my hand, I snatch the condom from the bedside table and kneel up between her legs.Keeping my eyes on hers, I pull her panties off and discard them on the floor.Her eyes are dark, full of promise and longing.They widen as I slowly put the condom on.How nice is this?I ask, as I wrap my fist around my erection.I meant it as a joke, she whimpers.Joke?Thank.The.Lord.All is not lost.A joke?I query, as my fist slides up and down my cock.Yes.Please, Christian, she begs.Are you laughing now?No.Her voice is barely audible, but the little shake of her head tells me all I need to know.Watching her needing meI could explode in my hand just looking at her.Grabbing her, I flip her over, keeping her fine, fine ass in the air.Its too tempting.I slap her cheek, hard, then plunge inside her.Oh, fuck.Shes so ready.She tightens around me and cries out as she comes.Fuck.Thats too quick.Holding her hips in place, I fuck her, hard, riding through her orgasm.Gritting my teeth, I grind into her, again and again, as she begins to build once more.Come on, Ana.Again, I will her, pounding on.She moans and whimpers beneath me, a sheen of sweat appearing on her back.Her legs begin to quiver.Shes close.Come on, Anastasia, again, I growl, and by some miracle her orgasm spirals through her body and into mine.Thank fuck.Wordlessly I come, pouring myself into her.Sweet Lord.I collapse on top of her.That was exhausting.How nice was that?I hiss against her ear as I draw air into my lungs.As she lies flat on the bed, panting, I pull out of her and remove the wretched condom.I get off the bed and quickly get dressed.When Im done, I reach down and unfasten my tie, freeing her.Turning over, she stretches her hands and fingers and readjusts her bra.Once I cover her with the comforter I lie down beside her, propped up on my elbow.That was really nice, she says with a mischievous smile.Theres that word again.I smirk at her.You dont like that word?No.It doesnt do it for me at all.OhI dont knowit seems to have a very beneficial effect on you.Im a beneficial effect now, am I?Could you wound my ego any further, Miss Steele?I dont think theres anything wrong with your ego.Her frown is fleeting.You think?Dr.Flynn would have plenty to say about that.Why dont you like to be touched?she asks, her voice sweet and soft.I just dont.I kiss her forehead to distract her from this line of questioning.So, that e mail was your idea of a joke?She gives me a coy look and an apologetic shrug.I see.So you are still considering my proposition?Your indecent proposalyes, I am.Well, thank fuck for that.Our deal is still in play.My relief is palpable; I can almost taste it.I have issues, though, she adds.Id be disappointed if you didnt.I was going to e mail them to you, but you kind of interrupted me.Coitus interruptus.See?I knew you had a sense of humor somewhere in there.The light in her eyes dances with mirth.Only certain things are funny, Anastasia.I thought you were saying nono discussion at all.I dont know yet.I havent made up my mind.Will you collar me?Her question surprises me.You have been doing your research.I dont know, Anastasia.Ive never collared anyone.Were you collared?she asks.Yes.By Mrs.Robinson?Mrs.Robinson?I laugh out loud.Anne Bancroft in The Graduate.Ill tell her you said that; shell love it.You still talk to her regularly?Her voice is high pitched with shock and indignation.Yes.Whys that such a big deal?I see.Now her voice is clipped.Shes mad?Why?I dont understand.So you have someone you can discuss your alternative lifestyle with, but Im not allowed.Her tone is petulant, but once again shes calling me out on my shit.I dont think Ive ever thought about it like that.Mrs.Robinson is part of that lifestyle.I told you, shes a good friend now.If youd like, I can introduce you to one of my former subs.You could talk to her.Is this your idea of a joke?she demands.No, Anastasia.Im surprised by her vehemence and shake my head to reinforce my denial.Its perfectly normal for a submissive to check with exes that their new Dominant knows what hes doing.NoIll do this on my own, thank you very much, she insists, and reaches for her comforter and quilt, pulling them up to her chin.What?Shes upset?Anastasia, II didnt mean to offend you.Im not offended.Im appalled.Appalled?I dont want to talk to one of your ex girlfriends, slave, sub, whatever you call them.Oh.Anastasia Steele, are you jealous?I sound bewilderedbecause I am.She flushes beet red, and I know Ive found the root of her problem.How the hell can she be jealous?Sweetheart, I had a life before you.A very active life.Are you staying?she snaps.What?Of course not.I have a breakfast meeting tomorrow at The Heathman.Besides, I told you, I dont sleep with girlfriends, slaves, subs, or anyone.Friday and Saturday were exceptions.It wont happen again.She presses her lips together with her stubborn expression.Well, Im tired now, she says.Fuck.Are you kicking me out?This is not how this is supposed to go.Yes.What the hell?Disarmed again, by Miss Steele.Well, thats another first, I mutter.Kicked out.I cant believe it.So nothing you want to discuss now?About the contract?I ask, as an excuse to prolong my stay.No, she grunts.Her petulance is irritating, and were she truly mine, it would not be tolerated.God, Id like to give you a good hiding.Youd feel a lot better, and so would I, I tell her.You cant say things like that.I havent signed anything yet.Her eyes flash with defiance.Oh, baby, I can say it.I just cant do it.Not until you let me.A man can dream, Anastasia.Wednesday?I still want this.Why, though, I dont know; shes so difficult.I give her a brief kiss.Wednesday, she agrees, and Im relieved once again.Ill see you out, she adds, her tone softer.If you give me a minute.She pushes me off the bed and pulls on her T shirt.Please pass me my sweatpants, she orders, pointing to them.Wow.Miss Steele can be a bossy little thing.Yes, maam, I quip, knowing that she wont get the reference.But she narrows her eyes.She knows Im making fun of her, but she says nothing as she slips her pants on.Feeling a little bemused at the prospect of being tossed out onto the street, I follow her through the living room to the front door.When was the last time this happened?Never.She opens the door, but shes staring down at her hands.What is going on here?You okay?I ask, and brush her lower lip with my thumb.Perhaps she doesnt want me to goor perhaps she cant wait for me to leave?Yes, she says, her tone soft and subdued.Im not sure I believe her.Wednesday, I remind her.Ill see her then.Bending down, I kiss her, and she closes her eyes.And I dont want to go.Not with her uncertainty on my mind.I hold her head and deepen the kiss and she responds, surrendering her mouth to me.Oh, baby, dont give up on me.Give it a try.She grasps my arms, kissing me back, and I dont want to stop.Shes intoxicating and the darkness is quiet, calmed by the young woman in front of me.Reluctantly, I pull back and lean my forehead against hers.Shes breathless, like me.Anastasia, what are you doing to me?I could say the same to you, she whispers.I know I have to leave.She has me in a tailspin, and I dont know why.I kiss her forehead and walk down the path toward the R8.She stands watching me from the doorway.She hasnt gone in.I smile, pleased that shes still watching as I climb into the car.When I look back, shes gone.Shit.What just happened?No wave good bye?I start the car and begin the drive back to Portland, analyzing whats taken place between us.She e mailed me.I went to her.We fucked.She threw me out before I was ready to leave.For the first timewell, maybe not the first timeI feel a little used, for sex.Its a disturbing feeling that reminds me of my time with Elena.Hell!Miss Steele is topping from the bottom, and she doesnt even know it.And fool that I am, Im letting her.I have to turn this around.This soft sell approach is messing with my head.But I want her.I need her to sign.Is it just the chase?Is that whats turning me on?Or is it her?Fuck, I dont know.But I hope to find out more on Wednesday.And on a positive note, that was one hell of a nice way to spend an evening.I smirk in the rearview mirror and pull into the garage at the hotel.When Im back in my room I sit down at my laptop.Focus on what you want, where you want to be.Isnt that what Flynn is always harassing me about, his solution based shit?* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: This Evening  Date: May 23 2011

Thank you for another diverting evening but that seems a little over the top.Pushing my laptop aside because Ana will probably be asleep, I pick up the Detroit report and continue reading.TUESDAY, MAY 24, 2011    * * *      The thought of siting the electronics plant in Detroit is depressing.I loathe Detroit; it holds nothing but bad memories for me.Memories I do my damnedest to forget.They surface, mainly at night, to remind me of what I am and where I came from.But Michigan is offering excellent tax incentives.Its hard to ignore what they are proposing in this report.I toss it on the dining table and take a sip of my Sancerre.Shit.Its warm.Its late.I should sleep.As I stand and stretch, theres a ping on my computer.An e mail.It might be from Ros, so I have a quick look.Its from Ana.Why is she still awake?* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Issues  Date: May 24 2011 00:02  To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grey,  Here is my list of issues.I look forward to discussing them

limits.Im sure I wouldnt need a ten page contract to do that!Surely this is for YOUR benefit.Fair point well made, Miss Steele!4: As you are aware, you are my only sexual partner.I dont take drugs, and Ive not had any blood transfusions.Im probably safe.What about you?Another fair point!And it dawns on me that this is the first time I havent had to consider the sexual history of a partner.Well, thats one advantage of screwing a virgin.8: I can terminate at any time if I dont think youre sticking to the agreed limits.OkayI like this.I hope it wont come to that, but it wouldnt be the first time if it did.9: Obey you in all things?Accept without hesitation your discipline?We need to talk about this.11: One month trial period.Not three.Only a month?Thats not long enough.How far can we go

sure about this.15.2: Using my body as you see fit sexually or otherwiseplease define or otherwise.15.5: This whole discipline clause.Im not sure I want to be whipped, flogged, or corporally

engaged.She seems to be taking it seriously and well have much to discuss on Wednesday.The uncertainty that I felt when leaving her apartment this evening recedes.Theres hope for our relationship, but firstshe needs to sleep.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Issues  Date: May 24 2011 00:07  To: Anastasia Steele  Miss Steele,  Thats a long list.Why are you still up?Christian Grey  CEO, Grey

recall, I was going through this list when I was distracted and bedded by a passing control freak.Good night.Ana  Her e mail makes me laugh out loud but it irritates me in equal measure.Shes much more sassy in print and she has a great sense of humor, but the woman needs sleep.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Stop Burning the Midnight Oil  Date: May 24 2011 00:12  To: Anastasia Steele  GO TO BED, ANASTASIA.Christian Grey  CEO & Control Freak, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.A few minutes pass and once Im convinced shes gone to bed, persuaded by my capital letters, I head into my bedroom.I take my laptop just in case she replies again.Once in bed, I grab my book and read.After half an hour I give up.I cant concentrate; my mind keeps straying to Ana, how she was this evening, and her e mail.I need to remind her of what I expect from our relationship.I dont want her getting the wrong idea.Ive strayed too far from my goal.Are you going to come and help Ana with the move?Kavanaghs words remind me that unrealistic expectations have been set.Perhaps I could help them move?No.Stop now, Grey.Opening my laptop, I read through her Issues e mail again.I need to manage her expectations and try to find the right words to express how I feel.Finally, Im inspired.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Your Issues  Date: May 24 2011 01:27  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear

it.I hope shell find it amusing, but it gets my point across.With that thought, I switch off my bedside light and fall asleep and dream.His name is Lelliot.Hes bigger than me.He laughs.And smiles.And shouts.And talks all the time.He talks all the time to Mommy and Daddy.He is my brother.Why dont you talk?Lelliot says again and again and again.Are you stupid?Lelliot says again and again and again.I jump on him and smack his face again and again and again.He cries.He cries a lot.I dont cry.I never cry.Mommy is angry with me.I have to sit on the bottom stair.I have to sit for the longest time.But Lelliot never asks me why I dont talk ever again.If I make my hand into a fist he runs away.Lelliot is scared of me.He knows Im a monster.WHEN I RETURN FROM my run the next morning, I check my e mail before having a shower.Nothing from Miss Steele, but then its only 7:30.Maybe its a little early.Grey, snap out of this.Get a grip.I glare at the gray eyed prick who stares back at me from the mirror as I shave.No more.Forget about her for today.I have a job to do and a breakfast meeting to attend.FREDDIE WAS SAYING BARNEY may have a prototype of the tablet for you in a couple of days, Ros tells me during our videoconference.I was studying the schematics yesterday.They were impressive, but Im not sure were there yet.If we get this right theres no telling where the technology could go, and what it could do in developing countries.Dont forget the home market, she interjects.As if.Christian, just how long are you going to be in Portland?Ros sounds exasperated.Whats going on down there?Eyeing the webcam, she then peers hard at her screen, looking for clues in my expression.A merger.I try to hide my smile.Does Marco know?I snort.Marco Inglis is the head of my mergers and acquisitions division.No.Its not that kind of merger.Oh.Ros is silenced momentarily and, from her look, surprised.Yeah.Its private.Well, I hope youre successful, she says, smirking.Me, too, I acknowledge with a smirk of my own.Now, can we talk about Woods?Over the past year, weve acquired three tech companies.Two are booming, surpassing all targets, and one is struggling despite Marcos initial optimism.Lucas Woods heads it up; hes turned out to be an idiotall show, no substance.The money has gone to his head and hes lost focus and squandered the lead his company once had in fiber optics.My gut says asset strip the company, fire Woods, and merge their technology division into GEH.But Ros thinks Lucas needs more timeand that we need time to plan if were going to liquidate and rebrand his company.If we do, it will involve expensive redundancies.I think Woods has had enough time to turn this around.He just wont accept reality, I say emphatically.We need him gone, and Id like Marco to estimate the costs of liquidating.Marco wants to join us for this part of the call.Ill get him to log in.AT 12:30 IN THE afternoon Taylor drives me out to WSU in Vancouver for lunch with the president, the head of the environmental sciences department, and the vice president of economic development.As we approach the long driveway I cant help looking out at all the students to see if I can spy Miss Steele.Alas, I dont see her; shes probably holed up in the library reading a classic.The thought of her curled up somewhere with a book is comforting.There has been no reply to my last e mail, but then shes been working.Perhaps therell be something after lunch.As we pull up outside the administration building my phone buzzes.Its Grace.She never calls during the week.Mom?Hello, darling.How are you?Fine.Im about to go into a meeting.Your PA said you were in Portland.Her voice is full of hope.Damn.She thinks Im with Ana.Yeah, on business.Hows Anastasia?There it is!Fine as far as I know, Grace.What do you want?Oh, Good Lord.My mother is someone else whose expectations I have to manage.Mias coming home a week early, on Saturday.Im on call that day and your father is away at a legal conference presenting a panel on philanthropy and aid, she says.You want me to meet her?Will you?Sure.Ask her to send me her flight details.Thank you, darling.Say hi to Anastasia for me.I have to go.Good bye, Mom.I hang up before she can ask any more awkward questions.Taylor opens the car door.I should be out of here by three.Yes, Mr.Grey.Will you be able to see your daughter tomorrow, Taylor?Yes, sir.His expression is warm and full of paternal pride.Great.Ill be here at three, he confirms.I head into the universitys administration buildingThis is going to be a long lunch.I HAVE MANAGED TO keep Anastasia Steele out of every waking thought today.Almost.During lunch there were times when I found myself imagining us in my playroomWhat did she call it?The Red Room of Pain.I shake my head, smiling, and check my e mail.That woman has a way with words, but so far there are no words from her today.I change from my suit to my sweats to get ready for the hotel gym.As Im about to leave my room, I hear a ping.Its her.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: My IssuesWhat about Your Issues?Date: May 24 2011 18:29  To: Christian Grey  Sir,  Please note the date of origin:

thing of the past.With that in mind, I agree.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Exasperated Men  Date: May 24 2011 18:52  To: Anastasia Steele  Fine.My hotel at 7:00.Ill meet you in the Marble Bar.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Not So Intractable Men  Date: May 24 2011 18:55  To: Christian Grey  Thank you.Ana x  And Im rewarded with a kiss.Ignoring how that makes me feel, I let her know that shes welcome.My mood has lifted as I head to the hotel gym.She sent me a kiss      WEDNESDAY, MAY 25, 2011    * * *      I order a glass of Sancerre and stand at the bar.Ive been waiting for this moment all day and look repeatedly at my watch.This feels like a first date, and in a way it is.Ive never taken a prospect out to dinner.Ive sat through interminable meetings today, bought a business, and fired three people.Nothing Ive done today, including runningtwiceand a quick circuit in the gym, has dispelled the anxiety Ive wrestled with all day.That power is in the hands of Anastasia Steele.I want her submission.I hope shes not going to be late.I glance toward the entrance of the barand my mouth dries.Shes standing on the threshold, and for a second I dont realize its her.She looks exquisite: her hair falls in soft waves to her breast on one side, and on the other its pinned back so its easier to see her delicate jawline and the gentle curve of her slender neck.Shes wearing high heels and a tight dark purple dress that accentuates her lithe, alluring figure.Wow.I step forward to meet her.You look stunning, I whisper, and kiss her cheek.Closing my eyes, I savor her scent; she smells heavenly.A dress, Miss Steele.I approve.Diamonds in her ears would complete the ensemble; I must buy her a pair.Taking her hand, I lead her to a booth.What would you like to drink?Im rewarded with a knowing smile as she sits down.Ill have what youre having, please.Ah, shes learning.Another glass of the Sancerre, I tell the waiter, and I slide into the booth, opposite her.They have an excellent wine cellar here, I add, and take a moment to look at her.Shes wearing a little makeup.Not too much.And I remember when she first fell into my office how ordinary I thought she looked.She is anything but ordinary.With a little makeup and the right clothes, shes a goddess.She shifts in her seat and her eyelashes flutter.Are you nervous?I ask.Yes.This is it, Grey.Leaning forward, in a candid whisper, I tell her that Im nervous, too.She looks at me as if Ive grown three heads.Yeah, Im human, too, babyjust.The waiter places Anas wine and two small plates of mixed nuts and olives between us.Ana squares her shoulders, an indication that she means business, like she did when she first interviewed me.So, how are we going to do this?Run through my points one by one?she asks.Impatient as ever, Miss Steele.Well, I could ask you what you thought of the weather today, she retorts.Oh, that smart mouth.Let her stew for a moment, Grey.Keeping my eyes on hers, I pop an olive into my mouth and lick my index finger.Her eyes grow wider and darker.I thought the weather was particularly unexceptional today.I try for nonchalance.Are you smirking at me, Mr.Grey?I am, Miss Steele.She purses her lips to stifle her smile.You know this contract is legally unenforceable.I am fully aware of that, Miss Steele.Were you going to tell me that at any point?What?I didnt think Id have toand youve worked it out for yourself.Youd think Id coerce you into something you dont want to do, and then pretend that I have a legal hold over you?Well, yes.Whoa.You dont think very highly of me, do you?You havent answered my question.Anastasia, it doesnt matter if its legal or not.It represents an arrangement that I would like to make with youwhat I would like from you and what you can expect from me.If you dont like it, then dont sign.If you do sign and then decide you dont like it, there are enough get out clauses so you can walk away.Even if it were legally binding, do you think Id drag you through the courts if you did decide to run?What does she take me for?She considers me with her unfathomable blue eyes.What I need her to understand is that this contract isnt about the law, its about trust.I want you to trust me, Ana.As she takes a sip of her wine I rush on, endeavoring to explain.Relationships like this are built on honesty and trust.If you dont trust metrust me to know how Im affecting you, how far I can go with you, how far I can take youif you cant be honest with me, then we really cant do this.She rubs her chin as she considers what Ive said.So its quite simple, Anastasia.Do you trust me or not?And if she thinks so little of me, then we shouldnt do this at all.My gut is knotting with tension.Did you have similar discussions with, umthe fifteen?No.Why is she going off on this tangent?Why not?she asks.Because they were all established submissives.They knew what they wanted out of a relationship with me and generally what I expected.With them, it was just a question of fine tuning the soft limits, details like that.Is there a store you go to?Submissives R Us?She arches an eyebrow and I laugh out loud.And like a magicians rabbit the tension in my body disappears.Not exactly.My tone is wry.Then how?Shes ever curious, but I dont want to talk about Elena again.Last time I mentioned her Ana turned frosty.Is that what you want to discuss?Or shall we get down to the nitty gritty?Your issues, as you say.She frowns.Are you hungry?I ask.She looks suspiciously at the olives.No.Have you eaten today?She hesitates.Shit.No, she says.I try not to let her admission anger me.You have to eat, Anastasia.We can eat down here or in my suite.Which would you prefer?Shell never go for this.I think we should stay in public, on neutral ground.As predictedsensible, Miss Steele.Do you think that would stop me?My voice is husky.She swallows.I hope so.Put the girl out of her misery, Grey.Come, I have a private dining room booked.No public.Rising, I hold out my hand to her.Will she take it?She looks from my face to my hand.Bring your wine, I order.And she picks up her glass and places her hand in mine.As we leave the bar, I notice admiring glances from other guests, and in the case of one handsome, athletic guy, overt appreciation of my date.Its not something Ive dealt with beforeand I dont think I like it.Upstairs on the mezzanine, the liveried young host dispatched by the matre d leads us to the room Ive booked.He only has eyes for Miss Steele, and I give him a withering look that sends him in retreat from the opulent dining room.An older waiter seats Ana and drapes a napkin on her lap.Ive ordered already.I hope you dont mind.No, thats fine, she says with a gracious nod.Its good to know that you can be amenable.I smirk.Now, where were we?The nitty gritty, she says, focused on the task at hand, but then she takes a large gulp of wine and her cheeks color.She must be looking for courage.Ill have to watch how much shes drinking, because shes driving.She could always spend the night herethen I could peel her out of that enticing dress.Regaining my focus, I return to businessAnas issues.From the inside pocket of my jacket I retrieve her e mail.She squares her shoulders once more and gives me an expectant look, and I have to hide my amusement.Clause two.Agreed.This is for the benefit of us both.I shall redraft.She takes another sip.My sexual health?Well, all of my previous partners have had blood tests, and I have regular tests every six months for all the health risks you mention.All my recent tests are clear.I have never taken drugs.In fact, Im vehemently antidrug.I have a strict no tolerance policy with regards to drugs for all my employees, and I insist on random drug testing.In fact, one of the people I fired today failed his drug test.Shes shocked, but I plow on.Ive never had any blood transfusions.Does that answer your question?She nods.Your next point I mentioned earlier.You can walk away anytime, Anastasia.I wont stop you.If you go, howeverthats it.Just so you know.No.Second.Chances.Ever.Okay, she replies, though she doesnt sound certain.We both fall silent as the waiter enters with our appetizers.For a moment I wonder if I should have held this meeting at my office, then dismiss the thought as ridiculous.Only fools mix business with pleasure.Ive kept my work and private life separate; its one of my golden rules, and the only exception to that is my relationship with Elenabut then she helped me start my business.I hope you like oysters, I remark to Ana as the waiter leaves.Ive never had one.Really?Well.All you do is tip and swallow.I think you can manage that.I stare pointedly at her mouth, remembering how well she can swallow.On cue she blushes and I squeeze lemon juice on the shellfish and tip it into my mouth.Hmm, delicious.Tastes of the sea.I grin as she watches me, fascinated.Go on, I encourage her, knowing that shes not one to back down from a challenge.So, I dont chew it?No, Anastasia, you dont.And I try not to think about her teeth toying with my favorite part of my anatomy.She presses them into her bottom lip, leaving little indentation marks.Damn.The sight stirs my body and I shift in my chair.She reaches for an oyster, squeezes the lemon, holds back her head, and opens wide.As she tips the oyster into her mouth my body hardens.Well?I ask, and I sound a little hoarse.Ill have another, she says with wry humor.Good girl.She asks me if Ive chosen oysters deliberately, knowing their reputed aphrodisiac qualities.I surprise her when I tell her they were simply at the top of the menu.I dont need an aphrodisiac near you.Yeah, I could fuck you right now.Behave, Grey.Get this negotiation back on track.So where were we?I return to her e mail and concentrate on her outstanding issues.Clause nine.Obey me in all things.Yes, I want you to do that.This is important to me.I need to know shes safe and will do anything for me.I need you to do that.Think of it as role play, Anastasia.But Im worried youll hurt me.Hurt you how?Physically.Do you really think I would do that?Go beyond any limit you cant take?Youve said youve hurt someone before.Yes, I have.It was a long time ago.How did you hurt her?I suspended her from my playroom ceiling.In fact, thats one of your questions.Suspensionthats what the karabiners are for in the playroom.Rope play.One of the ropes was tied too tightly.Appalled, she holds up her hand in a plea for me to stop.Too much information.I dont need to know any more.So you wont suspend me, then?she asks.Not if you really dont want to.You can make that a hard limit.Okay.She exhales, relieved.Move on, Grey.So, obeying, do you think you can manage that?She stares at me with those eyes that see through to my dark soul, and I dont know what shes going to say.Shit.This could be the end.I could try, she says, her voice low.Its my turn to exhale.Im still in the game.Good.Now term.Clause eleven.One month instead of three is no time at all, especially if you want a weekend away from me each month.Well get nowhere in that time.She needs training and I cant stay away from her for any length of time.I tell her as much.Maybe we can compromise, as she suggested.How about one day over one weekend per month you get to yourselfbut I get a midweek night that week?I watch her weighing the possibility.Okay, she says eventually, her expression serious.Good.And please, lets try it for three months.If its not for you, then you can walk away anytime.Three months, she says.Is she agreeing?Ill take it as a yes.Right.Here goes.The ownership thing, thats just terminology and goes back to the principle of obeying.Its to get you into the right frame of mind, to understand where Im coming from.And I want you to know that as soon as you cross my threshold as my submissive, I will do what I like to you.You have to accept that, and willingly.Thats why you have to trust me.I will fuck you, anytime, any way I wantanywhere I want.I will discipline you, because you will screw up.I will train you to please me.But I know youve not done this before.Initially, well take it slowly, and I will help you.Well build up to various scenarios.I want you to trust me, but I know I have to earn your trust, and I will.The or otherwiseagain, its to help you get into the mind set; it means anything goes.Some speech, Grey.She sits backoverwhelmed, I think.Still with me?I ask, gently.The waiter sneaks into the room, and with a nod I give him permission to clear our table.Would you like some more wine?I ask her.I have to drive.Good answer.Some water, then?She nods.Still or sparkling?Sparkling, please.The waiter leaves with our plates.Youre very quiet, I whisper.Shes barely said a word.Youre very verbose, she shoots straight back at me.Fair point, Miss Steele.Now for the next item on her list of issues: clause fifteen.I take a deep breath.Discipline.Theres a very fine line between pleasure and pain, Anastasia.They are two sides of the same coin, one not existing without the other.I can show you how pleasurable pain can be.You dont believe me now, but this is what I mean about trust.There will be pain, but nothing that you cant handle.I cannot emphasize this enough.Again, it comes down to trust.Do you trust me, Ana?Yes, I do, she says immediately.Her response knocks me sideways: its completely unexpected.Again.Have I gained her trust already?Well, then, the rest of this stuff is just details.I feel ten feet tall.Important details.Shes right.Concentrate, Grey.Okay, lets talk through those.The waiter reenters with our entres.I hope you like fish, I say, as he places our food before us.The black cod looks delicious.Ana takes a bite.Finally, shes eating!The rules, I continue.Lets talk about them.The food is a deal breaker?Yes.Can I modify to say that you will eat at least three meals a day?No.Suppressing an irritated sigh, I persist.I need to know that youre not hungry.She frowns.Youll have to trust me.Oh, touch, Miss Steele, I mutter to myself.These are battles Im not going to win.I concede the food and the sleep.She gives me a small, relieved smile.Why cant I look at you?she asks.Thats a Dom/sub thing.Youll get used to it.She frowns once more, but looks pained this time.Why cant I touch you?she asks.Because you cant.Shut her down, Grey.Is it because of Mrs.Robinson?What?Why would you think that?You think she traumatized me?She nods.No, Anastasia.Shes not the reason.Besides, Mrs.Robinson wouldnt take any of that shit from me.So nothing to do with her, she asks, looking confused.No.I cant bear to be touched.And, baby, you really dont want to know why.And I dont want you touching yourself, either, I add.Out of curiosity, why?Because I want all your pleasure.In fact, I want it now.I could fuck her here to see if she can be quiet.Real quiet, knowing were within earshot of the hotel staff and guests.After all, thats why Ive booked this room.She opens her mouth as if to say something, but closes it again and takes another bite of food from her largely untouched plate.Ive given you a great deal to think about, havent I?I say, folding up her e mail and tucking it into my inside pocket.Yes.Do you want to go through the soft limits now, too?Not over dinner.Squeamish?Something like that.Youve not eaten very much.Ive had enough.This is getting old.Three oysters, four bites of cod, and one asparagus stalk, no potatoes, no nuts, no olives, and youve not eaten all day.You said I could trust you.Her eyes widen.Yeah.Ive been keeping count, Ana.Christian, please, its not every day I sit through conversations like this.I need you fit and healthy, Anastasia.My tone is adamant.I know.And right now, I want to peel you out of that dress.I dont think thats a good idea, she whispers.We havent had dessert.You want dessert?When you havent eaten your main course?Yes.You could be dessert.Im not sure Im sweet enough.Anastasia, youre deliciously sweet.I know.Christian.You use sex as a weapon.It really isnt fair.She looks down at her lap, and her voice is low and a little melancholy.She looks up again, pinning me with an intense stare, her powder blue eyes unnervingand arousing.Youre right.I do, I admit.In life you use what you know.Doesnt change how much I want you.Here.Now.And we could fuck here, right now.I know youre interested, Ana.I hear how your breathing has changed.Id like to try something.I really want to know how quiet she can be, and if she can do this with the fear of discovery.Her brow creases once more; shes confused.If you were my sub, you wouldnt have to think about this.It would be easy.All those decisionsall the wearying thought processes behind them.The Is this the right thing to do?Should this happen here?Can it happen now?You wouldnt have to worry about any of that detail.Thats what Id do as your Dom.And right now, I know you want me, Anastasia.She tosses her hair over her shoulder, and her frown intensifies as she licks her lips.Oh yes.She wants me.I can tell because your body gives you away.Youre pressing your thighs together, youre flushed, and your breathing has changed.How do you know about my thighs?she asks, her voice high pitched, shocked, I think.I felt the tablecloth move, and its a calculated guess based on years of experience.Im right, arent I?Shes quiet for a moment and looks away.I havent finished my cod, she says, evasive but still blushing.Youd prefer cold cod to me?Her eyes meet mine, and theyre wide, pupils dark and large.I thought you liked me to clear my plate.Right now, Miss Steele, I couldnt give a fuck about your food.Christian.You just dont fight fair.I know.I never have.We stare at each other in a battle of wills, both aware of the sexual tension stretching between us across the table.Please, would you just do as youre told?I implore her with a look.But her eyes glint with sensual disobedience and a smile lifts her lips.Still holding my stare, she picks up an asparagus spear and deliberately bites her lip.What is she doing?Very slowly, she places the tip of the spear in her mouth and sucks it.Fuck.Shes trifling with mea dangerous tactic that will have me fucking her over this table.Oh, bring it on, Miss Steele.I watch, mesmerized, hardening by the second.Anastasia.What are you doing?I warn.Eating my asparagus, she says with a coy smile.I think youre toying with me, Miss Steele.Im just finishing my food, Mr.Grey.Her lips curl wider, slowly, carnal, and the heat between us rises several degrees.She really has no idea how sexy she isIm about to pounce when the waiter knocks and enters.Damn it.I let him clear the plates, then turn my attention back to Miss Steele.But her frown is back, and shes fidgeting with her fingers.Hell.Would you like some dessert?I ask.No thank you.I think I should go, she says, still staring at her hands.Go?Shes leaving?The waiter exits quickly with our plates.Yes, Ana says, her voice firm with resolve.She gets to her feet to leave.And automatically I stand, too.We both have the graduation ceremony tomorrow, she says.This is not going according to plan at all.I dont want you to go, I state, because its the truth.Please, I have to, she insists.Why?Because youve given me so much to consider, and I need some distance.Her eyes are pleading with me to let her go.But weve gotten so far in our negotiation.Weve made compromises.We can make this work.I have to make this work.I could make you stay, I tell her, knowing that I could seduce her right now, in this room.Yes, you could easily, but I dont want you to.This is all going southIve overplayed my hand.This isnt how I thought the night would end.I rake my hands through my hair in frustration.You know, when you fell into my office to interview me, you were all Yes, sir, No, sir.I thought you were a natural born submissive.But quite frankly, Anastasia, Im not sure you have a submissive bone in your delectable body.I walk the few steps that separate us and look down into eyes that shine with determination.You may be right, she says.No.No.I dont want to be right.I want the chance to explore the possibility that you do.I caress her face and her lower lip with my thumb.I dont know any other way, Anastasia.This is who I am.I know, she says.Lowering my head so my lips hover over hers, I wait until she raises her mouth to mine and closes her eyes.I want to give her a brief, chaste kiss, but as our lips touch, she leans in to me, her hands suddenly fisting in my hair, her mouth opening to me, her tongue insistent.I press my hand to the base of her spine, holding her against me, and deepen the kiss, mirroring her fervor.Christ, I want her.I cant persuade you to stay?I whisper against the corner of her mouth, as my body responds, hardening with desire.No.Spend the night with me.And not touch you?No.Damn.The darkness uncoils in my guts, but I ignore it.You impossible girl, I mutter, and pull back, examining her face and her tense, brooding expression.Why do I think youre telling me good bye?Because Im leaving now.Thats not what I mean, and you know it.Christian, I have to think about this.I dont know if I can have the kind of relationship you want.I close my eyes and rest my forehead against hers.What did you expect, Grey?Shes not cut out for this.I take a deep breath and kiss her forehead, then bury my nose in her hair, inhaling her sweet, autumnal scent and committing it to memory.Thats it.Enough.Stepping back, I release her.As you wish, Miss Steele.Ill escort you to the lobby.I hold out my hand for what could be the last time, and Im surprised how painful this thought is.She places her hand in mine, and in silence we head down to reception.Do you have your valet ticket?I ask as we reach the lobby.I sound calm and collected, but inside Im in knots.From her purse she retrieves the ticket, which I hand to the doorman.Thank you for dinner, she says.Its a pleasure as always, Miss Steele.This cannot be the end.I have to show herdemonstrate what this all means, what we can do together.Show her what we can do in the playroom.Then shell know.This might be the only way to save this deal.Quickly I turn to her.Youre moving this weekend to Seattle.If you make the right decision, can I see you on Sunday?I ask.Well see.Maybe, she says.Thats not a no.I notice the goose bumps on her arms.Its cooler now, dont you have a jacket?I ask.No.This woman needs looking after.I take off my jacket.Here.I dont want you catching cold.I slip it over her shoulders and she hugs it around herself, closes her eyes, and inhales deeply.Is she drawn to my scent?Like I am to hers?Perhaps all is not lost?The valet pulls up in an ancient VW Beetle.What the hell is that?Thats what you drive?This must be older than Grandpa Theodore.Jesus!The valet hands over the keys and I tip him generously.He deserves danger pay.Is this roadworthy?I glare at Ana.How can she be safe in this rust bucket?Yes.Will it make it to Seattle?Yes.She will.Safely?Yes.She tries to reassure me.Okay, shes old.But shes mine, and shes roadworthy.My stepdad bought it for me.When I suggest that we could do better than this she realizes what Im offering and her expression changes immediately.Shes mad.You are not buying me a car, she says emphatically.Well see, I mutter, trying to keep calm.I hold open the drivers door, and as she climbs in I wonder if I should ask Taylor to take her home.Damn.I remember that hes off this evening.Once Ive shut the door, she rolls down the windowpainfully slowly.For Christs sake!Drive safely, I growl.Good bye, Christian, she says, and her voice falters, as if shes trying not to cry.Shit.My whole mood shifts from irritation and concern for her well being to helplessness as her car roars off up the street.I dont know if Ill see her again.I stand like a fool on the sidewalk until her rear lights disappear into the night.Fuck.Why did that go so wrong?I stalk back into the hotel, make for the bar, and order a bottle of the Sancerre.Taking it with me, I head up to my room.My laptop lies open on my desk, and before I uncork the wine, I sit down and start typing an e mail.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Tonight

contemplate, and I fervently hope that you will give my proposal your serious consideration.I really want to make this work.We will take it slow.Trust me.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises

I sit and read, trying hard to concentrate.My eyes keep straying to my laptop screen.When will she reply?As the minutes tick by, my anxiety balloons; why hasnt she returned my e mail?At 11:00, I text her.Are you home safe?But I get nothing in response.Perhaps shes gone straight to bed.Before midnight I send another e mail.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Tonight  Date: May 25 2011 23:58

find out then if shes turning me down.With that depressing thought I strip and climb into bed and stare at the ceiling.Youve really fucked up this deal, Grey.THURSDAY, MAY 26, 2011    * * *      Mommy is gone.Sometimes she goes outside.And it is only me.Me and my cars and my blankie.When she comes home she sleeps on the couch.The couch is brown and sticky.She is tired.Sometimes I cover her with my blankie.Or she comes home with something to eat.I like those days.We have bread and butter.And sometimes we have macrami and cheese.That is my favorite.Today Mommy is gone.I play with my cars.They go fast on the floor.My mommy is gone.She will come back.She will.When is Mommy coming home?It is dark now, and my mommy is gone.I can reach the light when I stand on the stool.On.Off.On.Off.On.Off.Light.Dark.Light.Dark.Light.Im hungry.I eat the cheese.There is cheese in the fridge.Cheese with blue fur.When is Mommy coming home?Sometimes she comes home with him.I hate him.I hide when he comes.My favorite place is in my mommys closet.It smells of Mommy.It smells of Mommy when shes happy.When is Mommy coming home?My bed is cold.And I am hungry.I have my blankie and my cars but not my mommy.When is Mommy coming home?I wake with a start.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.I hate my dreams.Theyre riddled with harrowing memories, distorted reminders of a time I want to forget.My heart is pounding and Im drenched with sweat.But the worst consequence of these nightmares is dealing with the overwhelming anxiety when I wake.My nightmares have recently become more frequent, and more vivid.I have no idea why.Damned Flynnhes not back until sometime next week.I run both of my hands through my hair and check the time.Its 5:38, and the dawn light is seeping through the curtains.Its nearly time to get up.Go for a run, Grey.THERE IS STILL NO text or e mail from Ana.As my feet pound the sidewalk, my anxiety grows.Leave it, Grey.Just fucking leave it!I know Ill see her at the graduation ceremony.But I cant leave it.Before my shower, I send her another text.Call me.I just need to know shes safe.AFTER BREAKFAST THERES STILL no word from Ana.To get her out of my head I work for a couple of hours on my commencement speech.At the graduation ceremony later this morning Ill be honoring the extraordinary work of the environmental sciences department and the progress theyve made in partnership with GEH in arable technology for developing countries.All part of your feed the world plan?Anas shrewd words echo in my head, and they nudge at last nights nightmare.I shrug it off as I rewrite.Sam, my VP for publicity, has sent a draft that is way too pretentious for me.It takes me an hour to rework his media speak bullshit into something more human.Nine thirty and still no word from Ana.Her radio silence is worryingand frankly rude.I call, but her phone goes straight to a generic voice mail message.I hang up.Show some dignity, Grey.Theres a ping in my inbox, and my heartbeat spikesbut its from Mia.In spite of my bad mood, I smile.Ive missed that kid.* * *      From: Mia G.  Chef Extraordinaire  Subject: Flights  Date: May 26 2011 18:32 GMT 1  To: Christian Grey  Hey, Christian,  I cant wait to get out of here!Rescue me.Please.My flight number on Saturday is AF3622.It

her inherent optimism and her prying questions.She can be exhausting.Making a mental note of the flight number and time, I send Mia a quick e mail to let her know Ill be there.At 9:45 I get ready for the ceremony.Gray suit, white shirt, and of course that tie.It will be my subtle message to Ana that I havent given up, and a reminder of good times.Yeah, real good timesimages of her bound and wanting come to mind.Damn it.Why hasnt she called?I press redial.Shit.Still no fucking answer!At 10:00 precisely, theres a knock on my door.Its Taylor.Good morning, I say, as he comes in.Mr.Grey.How was yesterday?Good, sir.Taylors demeanor shifts, and his expression warms.He must be thinking of his daughter.Sophie?Shes a doll, sir.And doing very well at school.Thats great to hear.The A3 will be in Portland later this afternoon.Excellent.Lets go.And though Im loath to admit it, Im anxious to see Miss Steele.THE CHANCELLORS SECRETARY USHERS me into a small room adjacent to the WSU auditorium.She blushes, almost as much as a certain young woman I know intimately.There, in the greenroom, academics, administrative staff, and a few students are having pre graduation coffee.Among them, to my surprise, is Katherine Kavanagh.Hi, Christian, she says, strutting toward me with the confidence of the well heeled.Shes in her graduation gown and appears cheerful enough; surely shes seen Ana.Hi, Katherine.How are you?You seem baffled to see me here, she says, ignoring my greeting and sounding a little affronted.Im valedictorian.Didnt Elliot tell you?No, he didnt.Were not in each others pockets, for Christs sake.Congratulations, I add as a courtesy.Thank you.Her tone is clipped.Is Ana here?Soon.Shes coming with her dad.You saw her this morning?Yes.Why?I wanted to know if she made it home in that deathtrap she calls a car.Wanda.She calls it Wanda.And yes, she did.She gazes at me with a quizzical expression.Im glad to hear it.At that point the chancellor joins us, and with a polite smile to Kavanagh, escorts me over to meet the other academics.Im relieved that Ana is in one piece, but pissed that she hasnt replied to any of my messages.Its not a good sign.But I dont have long to dwell on this discouraging state of affairsone of the faculty members announces its time to begin and herds us out into the corridor.In a moment of weakness I try Anas phone once more.It goes straight to voice mail, and Im interrupted by Kavanagh.Im looking forward to your commencement address, she says as we walk down the hallway.When we reach the auditorium I notice its larger than I expected, and packed.The audience, as one, rises and applauds as we file onto the stage.The clapping intensifies, then slowly subsides to an expectant buzz as everyone takes their seats.Once the chancellor begins his welcome address Im able to scan the room.The front rows are filled with students, in identical black and red WSU robes.Where is she?Methodically I inspect each row.There you are.I find her huddled in the second row.Shes alive.I feel foolish for expending so much anxiety and energy on her whereabouts last night and this morning.Her brilliant blue eyes are wide as they lock with mine, and she shifts in her seat, a slow flush coloring her cheeks.Yes.Ive found you.And you havent replied to my messages.Shes avoiding me and Im pissed.Really pissed.Closing my eyes, I imagine dripping hot wax onto her breasts and her squirming beneath me.This has a radical effect on my body.Shit.Get it together, Grey.Dismissing her from my mind, I marshal my lascivious thoughts and concentrate on the speeches.Kavanagh gives an inspiring address about embracing opportunitiesyes, carpe diem, Kateand gets a rousing reception when shes finished.Shes obviously smart and popular and confident.Not the shy and retiring wallflower that is the lovely Miss Steele.It really amazes me that these two are friends.I hear my name announced; the chancellor has introduced me.I rise and approach the lectern.Showtime, Grey.Im profoundly grateful and touched by the great compliment accorded to me by the authorities of WSU today.It offers me a rare opportunity to talk about the impressive work of the environmental sciences department here at the university.Our aim is to develop viable and ecologically sustainable methods of farming for third world countries; our ultimate goal is to help eradicate hunger and poverty across the globe.Over a billion people, mainly in sub Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, live in abject poverty.Agricultural dysfunction is rife within these parts of the world, and the result is ecological and social destruction.I have known what its like to be profoundly hungry.This is a very personal journey for me.As partners, WSU and GEH have made tremendous progress in soil fertility and arable technology.We are pioneering low input systems in developing countries, and our test sites have increased crop yields up to thirty percent per hectare.WSU has been instrumental in this fantastic achievement.And GEH is proud of those students who join us through internships to work at our test sites in Africa.The work they do there benefits the local communities and the students themselves.Together we can fight hunger and the abject poverty that blights these regions.But in this age of technological evolution, as the first world races ahead, widening the gap between the haves and the have nots, its vital to remember that we must not squander the worlds finite resources.These resources are for all humanity, and we need to harness them, find ways of renewing them, and develop new solutions to feed our overpopulated planet.As Ive said, the work that GEH and WSU are doing together will provide solutions, and its our job to get the message out there.Its through GEHs telecommunications division that we intend to supply information and education to the developing world.Im proud to say that were making impressive progress in solar technology, battery life, and wireless distribution that will bring the Internet to the remotest parts of the worldand our goal is to make it free to users at the point of delivery.Access to education and information, which we take for granted here, is the crucial component for ending poverty in these developing regions.Were lucky.Were all privileged here.Some more than others, and I include myself in that category.We have a moral obligation to offer those less fortunate a decent life thats healthy, secure, and well nourished, with access to more of the resources that we all enjoy here.Ill leave you with a quote that has always resonated with me.And Im paraphrasing a Native American saying: Only when the last leaf has fallen, the last tree has died, and the last fish been caught will we realize that we cannot eat money.As I sit down to rousing applause, I resist looking at Ana and examine the WSU banner hanging at the back of the auditorium.If she wants to ignore me, fine.Two can play at that game.The vice chancellor rises to commence handing out the degrees.And so begins the agonizing wait until we reach the Ss and I can see her again.After an eternity I hear her name called: Anastasia Steele.A ripple of applause, and shes walking toward me looking pensive and worried.Shit.What is she thinking?Hold it together, Grey.Congratulations, Miss Steele, I say as I give Ana her degree.We shake hands, but I dont let hers go.Do you have a problem with your laptop?She looks perplexed.No.Then you are ignoring my e mails?I release her.I only saw the mergers and acquisitions one.What the hell does that mean?Her frown deepens, but I have to let her gotheres a line forming behind her.Later.I let her know that were not finished with this conversation as she moves on.Im in purgatory by the time weve reached the end of the line.Ive been ogled, and had eyelashes batted at me, silly giggling girls squeezing my hand, and five notes with phone numbers pressed into my palm.Im relieved as I exit the stage along with the faculty, to the strains of some dreary processional music and applause.In the corridor I grab Kavanaghs arm.I need to speak to Ana.Can you find her?Now.Kavanagh is taken aback, but before she can say anything I add, in as polite a tone as I can manage, Please.Her lips thin with disapproval, but she waits with me as the academics file past and then she returns to the auditorium.The chancellor stops to congratulate me on my speech.It was an honor to be asked, I respond, shaking his hand once again.Out of the corner of my eye I spy Kate in the corridorwith Ana at her side.Excusing myself, I stride toward Ana.Thank you, I say to Kate, who gives Ana a worried glance.Ignoring her, I take Anas elbow and lead her through the first door I find.Its a mens locker room, and from the fresh smell I can tell its empty.Locking the door, I turn to face Miss Steele.Why havent you e mailed me?Or texted me back?I demand.She blinks a couple of times, consternation writ large on her face.I havent looked at my computer today, or my phone.She seems genuinely bewildered by my outburst.That was a great speech, she adds.Thank you, I mutter, derailed.How can she not have checked her phone or e mail?Explains your food issues to me, she says, her tone gentleand if Im not mistaken, pitying, too.Anastasia, I dont want to go there at the moment.I dont need your pity.I close my eyes.All this time I thought she didnt want to talk to me.Ive been worried about you.Worried, why?Because you went home in that deathtrap you call a car.And I thought Id blown the deal between us.Ana bristles.What?Its not a deathtrap.Its fine.Jos regularly services it for me.Jos, the photographer?This just gets better and fucking better.Yes, the Beetle used to belong to his mother.Yes, and probably her mother and her mother before her.Its not safe.Im almost shouting.Ive been driving it for over three years.Im sorry you were worried.Why didnt you call?I called her cell phone.Does she not use her damned cell phone?Is she talking about the house phone?Running my hand through my hair in exasperation, I take a deep breath.This is not addressing the fucking elephant in the room.Anastasia, I need an answer from you.This waiting around is driving me crazy.Her face falls.Shit.Christian, Ilook, Ive left my stepdad on his own.Tomorrow.I want an answer by tomorrow.Okay.Tomorrow, Ill tell you then, she says with an anxious look.Well, its still not a no.And once more, Im surprised by my relief.What the hell is it about this woman?She stares up at me with sincere blue eyes, her face etched in concern, and I resist the urge to touch her.Are you staying for drinks?I ask.I dont know what Ray wants to do.She looks uncertain.Your stepfather?Id like to meet him.Her uncertainty magnifies.Im not sure thats a good idea, she says darkly, as I unlock the door.What?Why?Is this because she now knows I was dirt poor as a kid?Or because she knows how I like to fuck?That Im a freak?Are you ashamed of me?No!she exclaims, and she rolls her eyes in frustration.Introduce you to my dad as what?She raises her hands in exasperation.This is the man who deflowered me and wants us to start a BDSM relationship?Youre not wearing running shoes.Running shoes?Her dad is going to come after me?And just like that she has injected a little humor between us.My mouth twitches in response and she returns my smile, her face lighting up like a summer dawn.Just so you know, I can run quite fast, I respond playfully.Just tell him Im your friend, Anastasia.I open the door and follow her out but stop when I reach the chancellor and his colleagues.As one they turn and stare at Miss Steele, but shes disappearing into the auditorium.They turn back to me.Miss Steele and I are none of your business, people.I give the chancellor a brief, polite nod and he asks if Ill come and meet more of his colleagues and enjoy some canaps.Sure, I reply.It takes me thirty minutes to escape from the faculty gathering, and as I make my way out of the crowded reception Kavanagh falls into step beside me.We head to the lawn where the graduates and their families are enjoying a post graduation drink in a large tented pavilion.So have you asked Ana to dinner on Sunday?she asks.Sunday?Has Ana mentioned that were seeing each other on Sunday?At your parents house, Kavanagh explains.My parents?I spot Ana.What the fuck?A tall blond guy who looks as if hes walked off a beach in California has his hands all over her.Who the hell is that?Is this why she didnt want me to come for a drink?Ana looks up, catches my expression, and pales as her roommate stands beside that guy.Hello, Ray, Kavanagh says, and she kisses a middle aged man in an ill fitting suit standing beside Ana.This must be Raymond Steele.Have you met Anas boyfriend?Kavanagh asks him.Christian Grey.Boyfriend!Mr.Steele, its a pleasure to meet you.Mr.Grey, he says, quietly surprised.We shake hands; his grip is firm, and his fingers and palm are rough to the touch.This man works with his hands.Then I rememberhes a carpenter.His dark brown eyes give nothing away.And this is my brother, Ethan Kavanagh, says Kate, introducing the beach bum who has his arm wrapped around Ana.Ah.The Kavanagh offspring, together.I mutter his name as we shake hands, noting that they are soft, unlike Ray Steeles.Now stop pawing my girl, you fucker.
