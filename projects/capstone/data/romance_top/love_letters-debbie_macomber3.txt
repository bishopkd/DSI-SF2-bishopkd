So Ive heard.As quickly as it came, the humor left his voice and he looked away.Oh, shed had fun, all right, and turned up missing for nearly twenty hours.Tit for tat.It appeared her husband held onto old hurts as well.Perhaps it was unavoidable, seeing the hit their marriage had taken.First Roy and then her.These missteps had the potential to destroy them both, if they let them.Neither of them wanted a divorce, if for no other reason than their children.The key was in their ability to learn how to forgive.Try as she might, Maggie wasnt sure that was possible.Lets go inside, Roy suggested, and held the door open.They were both trying, Maggie realized.Trying hard.Perhaps too hard.It was possible that they might never be able to recapture what theyd lost.Mentally she shook her head, refusing to give in to negative thinking.No, she couldnt, wouldnt, allow that to happen.Roy was her husband, the father of her children, and she was determined to fight to keep her marriage intact.Theyd both made huge mistakes, but theyd vowed to start again and she wouldnt allow petty grievances to sabotage their intentions.The store gave off a musty scent that reminded her of old books.It wasnt entirely unpleasant.They walked down the aisles and saw a woman standing at the counter.There didnt seem to be a lot of customers in the store.Feel free to wander around and explore, the clerk told them.If you need help, let me know.Maggie asked where to find old buttons, and the woman directed her to an area against the back wall.Roy followed, looking a bit bored, his hands in his pockets.Maggie noticed an overstuffed chair close by.This might take a while, she told him.If you want, you can sit and relax.You dont need to handle me, Maggie.She hadnt realized that was what she was doing.Ill feel rushed if I know youre bored.Dont worry about me, okay?Okay.He could be prickly at times, which led her to believe that he, too, continued to struggle with negative thoughts, old wounds, and fresh ones, too.Determined not to allow his mood to alter her own, she sorted through the buttons, searching out the ones that caught her attention.Roy looked around a bit and then sat down in the chair and reached for his phone.Maggie went completely still.If he was sending Katherine a text, she swore shed walk out this door and not look back.Roy must have read her thoughts, because he looked up and caught her eye.Im checking emails to make sure everything is running smoothly on the job site.Rather than respond verbally for fear her voice would tremble, she nodded.Ten minutes later, he was still responding to emails.For once, just once, she wished Roy could leave work behind.Roy stood.I need to make a call.Now?she asked without censure.Were taking a weekend break, remember?Maybe you are, but I need to see to this.Roy, you promised.Maggie, listen, Im sorry, but the electrical foremans run into a problem and the entire job site is about to be shut down.Time is money, and we cant afford to let that happen, not when its within my power to prevent it.I  He had a valid point.I know youre disappointed, but this wont take more than a few minutes, I promise.Okay.He pushed a button on his cell and then swore under his breath.I cant get good reception in here.The clerk, whod apparently overheard their conversation, called out, If you step out and face the marina, you shouldnt have a problem.Thanks.Maggie was upset.She didnt want to be unreasonable or difficult over this.Theyd had more time together in the last twenty four hours than theyd enjoyed all year.That alone said it all.It used to be they made love three or four times a week.Itd dwindled down to once every other week, if that.Maggie didnt want to complain, didnt want to nag her husband.To be fair, she was equally neglectful when it came to the physical aspect of their marriage.The problem, she surmised, was their inability to get in sync with each other.When she was willing and ready, Roy was home late or overly tired.It was the same with her.Her husband would let her know what he wanted and shed beg off.Neither one of them put up much of a fuss, all too willing to accept the others weak excuses, which said a great deal, she supposed, sadly.After a few minutes, when Roy didnt return, Maggie paid for her purchases and left the store.She saw her husband pacing the sidewalk alongside the marina, intent in conversation.He didnt seem to notice her approach.Didnt seem to notice her at all.No, she wouldnt go there, feeling sorry for herself, making up excuses for what happened, for her own role in the mess theyd made of their lives together.She had to think positively, look forward rather than dwell on all that had gone wrong.The past could bury them.They had to look ahead, not behind.Roy saw her and waved.As she approached, she heard him speaking to the project manager.He ended the call and placed the phone back in his pocket.It looks like that problem is squared away.Good.Did you find some buttons you wanted?I did.She held up the small bag.Is it going to set me back a house payment?he teased.It is if were paying ten dollars a month for the mortgage.He grinned and looped his arm around her shoulders, bringing her close to his side.I was just thinking we might want to take the boys to Disneyland, she said casually.Roy mulled over the suggestion for a couple minutes.Arent the boys a little young yet for Disneyland?Perhaps, but it will give us something to look forward to as a family.She tacked on this last part so hed understand she was looking to the future, their future as a couple.If we get it on the schedule early, itll be easier for you to get away.She bit her lip to keep from mentioning that the boys needed time with their parents.It was vital that their children know their parents loved each other.Roy was good about giving them attention at night, but they rarely were together as a family.Disneyland, he repeated slowly, as though considering the idea.We could plan the trip around Christmas.Great.She was enthused now, and Roy seemed to be, too.Ill get online and see what I can find.Yes, do.He leaned down and kissed the top of her head.It was the first romantic gesture hed made toward her in longer than she wanted to remember.Maggie scanned the waterfront and the marina.Everything looked inviting.What a charming community.All at once her stomach heaved and a wave of nausea hit her, taking her by surprise.Whats wrong?Roy sensed right away something wasnt right.I dont know, she whispered, and clenched her stomach.All of a sudden Im feeling sick.Do you think it was the fish and chips?Maggie didnt know.Everything tasted so fresh and good.Youre feeling okay, arent you?Yes.Fine.My goodness, Maggie, youve gone pale.We both ate the same thing, so I doubt this has anything to do with lunch.Her stomach heaved again then, and she clenched it tighter.Should we go back to the inn?Roy asked.Maggie nodded.Thats a good idea.Keeping her close to his side, Roy led the way up the hill to the inn.Maggie had hoped that the walk and fresh air would help, but they didnt.If anything, she felt worse.By the time they arrived back, her face had broken out into a sweat and her hands felt clammy.Rover barked just once when they walked in the front door, and Jo Marie came around the corner from the kitchen.Maggie isnt feeling well, Roy explained.Is there anything I can do?Jo Marie asked.Maggie shook her head.No.At the moment, it was imperative that she get upstairs, and quickly.Reading the look in her eyes, Roy raced up the stairs and unlocked their room.Maggie made it into the bathroom in the nick of time, losing her lunch with violent heaves.Roy stood just outside the bathroom door, and when shed finished he handed her a wet washcloth.She wiped her mouth clean, and he gently led her to the bed.Oh Roy, I just cant have the flu.I just cant.Honey, dont worry.She lay down on the bed and he covered her with a knitted afghan from the foot of the mattress and then leaned over her and tenderly kissed her brow.Close your eyes and rest, and youll feel better when you wake.What are you going to do?she asked, feeling wretched that this would happen now.Oh why now?Why, why, why?I got a book to read, remember?Ill sit on the chair here and delve into a good story.All of a sudden it was all Maggie could do to keep her eyes open.Okay, she whispered.She heard a gentle knock against the door.Roy answered, and it was Jo Marie.Everythings fine.Maggies going to rest, she heard Roy whisper.This was Roy, her husband, the father of her children, the man she loved with all her heart.Her eyes drifted closed and she remembered the first day she saw him walk across campus.They were college students, both young and eager to make their mark on the world, full of ideas and idealism.So much had changed  so much.8     I felt terrible for Maggie Porter.Shed looked deathly pale when shed arrived back at the inn.From the frantic way she raced up the stairs, I knew she was about to be sick.Id hoped there was something that I could do.Id suggested that I bring up a pot of weak tea, but Roy told me it wasnt necessary.Maggie appeared to be resting comfortably now.I knew shed been looking forward to this weekend getaway with her husband, and I hated the thought of her coming down with the flu.Currently, all was quiet upstairs.Ellie Reynolds was busy dressing for her first date with Tom.And I suspected that Roy had either joined his wife for a nap or found some other way to occupy himself.The Porters were an attractive couple.My first impression of the two led me to believe there was trouble brewing in the relationship, but Id since changed my mind.They seemed to have settled whatever was wrong.Itd probably been a small misunderstanding that had escalated but had since been resolved.With everything under control, I sat down in my small office off the kitchen.A pile of papers cluttered my desk and needed filing.I kept paper backups, although everything I needed was on my computer.Once I dealt with the clutter on my desk, I worked on completing tax forms the state required from business owners each quarter.When I finished I leaned back in my chair and sighed.My meeting with Peggy that morning had been a disappointment.Id hoped that between her and Bob Id be able to learn more about Mark.It irritated me that he remained so tight lipped.I thought we were friends, and friends should be open and honest with each other.Right?Well, not Mark.Oh no.The details of his life were like gold bars stored inside a bank vault.I suppose I could bribe him with cookies.What do you think, Rover?Should I bake Mark a batch of peanut butter cookies and hold them hostage until he fills in the blanks?My faithful companion cocked his head and stared up at me as if to remind me that Id basically tried that earlier in the day.Right, I mumbled under my breath.Rover placed his chin back down on his paw but kept his gaze focused on me.Well, theres more than one way to find out what I want to know, I said aloud, fire stirring my blood.Id worked in the banking business and there were ways of garnering information.More determined than ever, I went onto the Internet and Googled Mark Taylor.Within a matter of seconds I had what I wanted  sort of.The Internet listed the information for two hundred and eleven men named Mark Taylor spread all across the country, from Nome, Alaska, to Key West, Florida.Oh great.What I needed was his middle name and his date of birthotherwise, Id be spending copious amounts of time and money shuffling through the lengthy list.And even then it would be little more than guesswork.I needed a lot more details if I was going to uncover anything of importance.And, really, was it worth all the time and hassle?That was the real question.I could always go back to my spring cleaning.Id been meaning to check out what was up in the attic for some time.I heard a car door slam and Rover was instantly on his feet.Fearing he might bark and wake Maggie Porter, I hurried to the front door.To my surprise, I found Mark parked outside.The bed of his pickup truck was loaded down with lumber.The man never ceased to astonish me.Itd taken him weeks to get started on the rose garden.Weeks.Yet only that morning Id given him the go ahead on the gazebo.Already hed purchased the lumber and seemed set on unloading it in the yard.He had a long two by four balanced on his shoulder, and carted it from the bed of his truck to the lawn before he noticed me and Rover standing on the top step.He hesitated.What is that look about?he asked.What look?The one youre giving me.I had no idea he could read me that easily.Im surprised is all.About what?He set the piece of lumber down and then removed his gloves.Youre starting on the gazebo?His gaze narrowed.I thought that was what you wanted.I do.Then how come youve got the look of a mounted bass?I wasnt keen on the analogy but let it pass.I thought Id need to wait.For what?He was being thickheaded.For you to get started.By the way, wheres Peter McConnell?Dont know and I dont care.He didnt explain, and while I was curious as to what had happened to the other man, I had more pressing subjects on my mind.Do you want me to come back later?he demanded.No, no, dont let me stop you.He put his gloves back on and then shook his head as if to say he found me impossible to understand.It sounds to me like youre complaining because Im starting the job.Last time around you were upset because I delayed planting the garden.Im not complaining, I shouted, louder than I intended.Women, he muttered, just loud enough for me to hear.He returned to his truck, shook his head, and reached for a second piece of lumber.I said Im not complaining, I repeated.Thats your mad voice.I am not mad, I insisted again, calmer this time, for fear of waking my guest.Im amazed.And pleased, I added.You make it sound like a bad thing.Its a good thing.Rover went down the stairs and parked himself halfway between the two of us, lying in the grass with his legs spread out, soaking in the coolness of the lawn.Whens your birthday?I asked.He set the board down next to the first one.Either he didnt hear me or he chose to ignore the question.Your birthday, I repeated, coming down the steps.What about it?he asked gruffly.He was on his third trip back from the truck, another long board balanced on top of his shoulder.You have one, dont you?Most folks do.Mines in February.He shook his head as if to say it was none of his concern.You expected me to buy you a birthday gift?No.He twisted everything around.When is yours?My what?Birthday!I was fast losing my patience.He was purposely being obtuse in hope of exasperating me, and he was succeeding.He stopped and planted his hands on his hips and glared at me as if Id asked him if he had a prison record.What do you want to know for?he demanded, his words as hard as the lumber hed carried.That was a tricky question.To admit Id been online seeking information about him was more than I wanted him to know.I dont know  maybe I want to throw you a surprise party.Ha.Ha.Very funny.Id invite Peggy and Bob and   You arent throwing me a surprise birthday party, and we both know it.He frustrated me to no end.Okay, fine.Forget the birthday party.Gladly.He was sweating hard now; hauling heavy lumber was strenuous labor.He paused and wiped his forearm across his brow.A dark strand fell across his forehead.You could use a haircut.The look he sent me would have melted kryptonite.Are we married?Hardly.Are you my mother?No.Okay, fine.I apologize.He was long overdue for a haircut, but far be it from me to mention it.I didnt know what was the matter with me.It was like I was going out of my way to irk him into an argument.Youre getting on my nerves, Jo Marie.I could tell.Seeing how badly Id bungled this, I returned to the house and brewed him a fresh glass of iced tea and then carried it outside.Here, I said, holding out the icy cold drink for him to take.Its a peace offering.He hesitated and stared at the glass for a good five second count before he deigned to reach for it.He made it seem like he was doing me a favor by accepting.Once he took the glass out of my hand, he drank down the tea in several large gulps and then returned it to me.The ice made clinking sounds against the side of the glass as I took it back.Thinking I should make casual conversation, I mentioned Maggie Porter was feeling sickly.Thats a shame.Flu?Dont know.I hope not, for both their sakes.He braced his hands against his hips.Ive got another load.You must be exhausted.Sit with me for a while.He cast me a suspicious look.Why?So you can relax, unwind.Are you going to hound me with more questions?he asked.No.Not because I wasnt curious, though.Getting Mark to admit to anything was like chasing after a dog with a bone.It was clear to me that I was going to need to be a whole lot more subtle if I was going to dig up information.I would have to trick him into giving me what I needed to know.I poured another glass of iced tea for him and one for myself.We sat side by side on the top step of the porch with Rover resting between us.We were silent for several moments, each lost in our own thoughts, I assumed.My musings went straight to Paul, as they often did, although I made an effort to remember the good times wed had.Id never laughed as much with anyone as I had with Paul.I looked up and noticed Mark studying me.When I caught his eye, he frowned and asked, You okay?I shrugged and then said the first thing I thought of, which in retrospect made no earthly sense.Pauls sweatshirt has lost his scent.I beg your pardon.It stunned me that Id blurt this out.Never mind.No, he said, frowning, refusing to let this pass without comment.So thats it.I was embarrassed now.Earlier Id been feeling depressed and lonely and Id gone into my room and taken Pauls sweatshirt out of the closet.I did that from time to time.I couldnt explain why, other than that I gained some comfort in an old Seahawks sweatshirt of his.Wed met at a Seahawks game and hed given it to me to keep for him when hed been deployed.I wore it myself on occasion, mainly because I felt close to Paul when I had it on.After I learned hed been killed, I kept it in a special spot in my closet and periodically held it against my face.Then I would breathe in the scent of him.That afternoon I noticed the fragrance that was uniquely my husband had faded.I felt as if I was losing this last bit of Paul, and I wasnt ready to let him go, wasnt ready to give this up when Id had to surrender so much else.Jo Marie?Mark eyed me curiously.Are you okay?Of course I am, I blurted out, lost in my thoughts.You look like youre about to break into tears.Im not, so dont worry.I leaped up off the step and rushed back into the house, and set the full glass of tea on the kitchen counter.A few moments later, Mark followed me inside.He took his own sweet time setting his empty glass in the sink.Whats this about wanting to know my birthday?he asked.Its nothing.I shouldnt have asked.I dont know why Id bothered to Google his name.Wanting to resolve this mystery around Mark was ridiculous.If you dont want to tell me, its fine.He started to walk out of the kitchen, hesitated, and turned back.Youre sure youre okay?Yes, I insisted.Again he paused as if at a loss at what to think.I was born May eighth.I stared back in surprise and blinked, hardly knowing what to say.I wouldnt go back to my computer search.It felt wrong now.Mark had given me a small bit of trust, and to search out his background like a bloodhound hot on a trail felt like Id be abusing his confidence.Another hour passed and I found myself dealing with the same restlessness that had plagued me recently.I heard footsteps and looked up to find Ellie descending the staircase, one hand on the railing.The change in her appearance was dramatic.The haircut was perfect for her.She wore a lovely sleeveless floral dress with a wide black belt and carried a thin white cardigan over her arm.Her purse hung from her shoulder.On seeing me, she said, Tom is on his way.You look fabulous, I said, and I meant it.A smile appeared.Do you really think so?I do.She was going to knock Toms socks off.Her cell phone dinged, and Ellie glanced at it and sighed.Tom?I asked, seeing the look that came over her.If this young man was messing with Ellies tender heart, I swore I would find a way to make him suffer.Ellie shook her head and ignored the call.Im going to pretend I didnt hear that, she said, as she tossed the phone back inside her purse.9     When Ellie heard Toms car pull into the driveway at Rose Harbor Inn, she froze.It felt like her entire body had shut down.This was it.The moment shed been waiting for all these months.With all her heart she had to believe that Tom was everything he claimed and that he wasnt out to abuse or use her.She had to believe that their feelings for each other were genuine.Her heart told her he was sincere, and she needed to trust her heart and drown out her mothers dire warnings.The porch steps creaked as Tom approached the front door.Ellie stood a few feet away on the other side, her heart racing like shed just finished running a marathon.Rover came and sat on his haunches at her side as though standing guard over her.The doorbell chimed and Ellie inhaled a deep breath, slowly counted to ten, and then, as casually as she could manage, stepped forward and opened the door.Tom looked exactly like his picture.He was tall, about six three, but then she was tall, too.Her mother claimed she got her height from her father.Toms eyes were a rich shade of brown as he steadily regarded her.It seemed they both held their breath.Ellie knew she did, waiting for she knew not what.For the longest moment of her life, neither spoke.Finally, Tom broke the silence.Ellie?She nodded.Tom?Her voice squeaked.He nodded and then whispered as if in awe.Youre even more beautiful in person.With anyone else that might have sounded like a well practiced line.It didnt with him.If anything, he looked as nervous as Ellie felt.He continued to stand on the other side of the door.Her manners, it seemed, had completely deserted her.Would you like to come inside?she asked, once she found she could speak without sounding like a high pitched pond frog.He glanced at his wrist, reminding her that hed made a dinner reservation.Perhaps later, if you dont mind, he said.I dont mind at all, she rushed to assure him.He took her elbow as they descended the porch steps.Then he hurried to her side of the car and held open the passenger door.One of the text messages from her mother had cautioned her that she should beware of men who were overly polite or well mannered.The warning rang in her ears now, but she refused to listen.Tom waited until she was inside and then closed the door for her.He raced around to the drivers side and slipped behind the steering wheel.Ellie couldnt help but think it was a rare man who saw to such details.He was like her, an old fashioned kind of person.The cars interior had been freshly detailed, she noticed.The dashboard gleamed and the seats felt slippery.It told Ellie that Tom wanted to make a good impression.Her mother had warned her about that, too.Once more, Ellie refused to listen to her mothers voice, no matter how loud Virginia Reynolds shouted in her ear.DDs on the Cove is the best restaurant in town.Jo Marie mentioned what a good restaurant it is, Ellie said.Shes the innkeeper.Do you know her?He started the engine and glanced over his shoulder while backing out of the driveway.Once he was on the road, he said, I havent met Jo Marie, but Ive heard nothing but good things about her and the inn.I thought youd feel most at home there.I appreciated the recommendation.He waited until they were down the hill before he spoke again.Your hair looks different now.Automatically, her hand went to the back of her head.Yes.She resisted asking him if he liked the new style.It might sound like she was fishing for compliments.Its a good look for you.Thanks.When they arrived at the restaurant their table was ready.Tom held her chair out for her, and once they were handed the menus, he made a couple suggestions.Their clam chowder is excellent.Ellie lowered the menu to look at him and smile.Whats your favorite thing to order?Fried oysters.I enjoy fried oysters, too, but the seafood Cobb salad is tempting me.Her decision was made.She was going for a cup of the chowder and the salad, then set her menu aside.The waiter returned and Tom ordered a white wine from New Zealand.Ellie enjoyed wine, but her knowledge was limited.Tom went on to explain about several varieties until their wine was delivered.The waiter took their dinner order and then discreetly slipped away.What shall we drink to?Tom asked, raising his wineglass, holding onto the stem.To finally meeting, Ellie suggested.He tipped his glass toward hers until the two goblets made a slight clinking sound.May it be the first of many such meetings and dinner dates.Ellie hoped that was true.Tom was exactly as she pictured him, and not just in the physical sense.He was as uptight about this dinner date as she was.Is your mother upset with you?he asked, after their soup was delivered.A little, Ellie confessed.He had no clue, and she wasnt telling him.She tasted the chowder and Tom was right to have recommended it.Which means shes probably texting you every hour.Something like that.He set his wineglass down and frowned slightly as if he was well aware of her mothers tactics.It means a lot to me that youd be willing to meet me.That was the way Ellie wanted it.She had to be away from her mother for this first meeting.Tom had offered to come to Oregon, but Ellie had discouraged that for fear of what her mother would do to embarrass her.Im sure she means well, Tom said, as if following her train of thought.If you were my daughter, Id want to protect you, too.Do I need protection from you, Tom?No.His dark eyes widened slightly.Id never do anything to hurt you, Ellie, God as my witness.His words warmed her.They talked for a while.A lot of their previous conversation had revolved around their families.With Ellie, there was little to tell.Shed been raised with her grandparents, homeschooled, and had taken a few community college classes.Itd been a friends suggestion that she join a group of other women who shared a talent for organization.The four of them had started their own company, which had proven to be successful beyond their expectations.Ellie knew Toms father had died when he was young.His mother had remarried, and Tom and his younger brother, Earl, had basically been raised by their stepfather, although they both thought of him as their father and called him Dad.I know your mother is worried about us, and frankly I dont blame her, Tom continued.Maybe we should call her and reassure her later.No.It wouldnt do any good and would quite possibly arouse her mothers suspicions.Knowing Virginia, Ellie accepted that there wasnt anything Tom could say or do that would appease her.Even now I miss my mother, Tom said, looking thoughtful.Shes been gone ten years now.I was in my late teens when she died.Her death changed the course of my life.Im sorry.Ellie probably didnt appreciate her mother nearly enough, but lately that had been difficult.Virginia was much too refined to argue verbally with Ellie, but her disapproval was evident in nearly every way imaginable.For a long time my dad was an emotional mess.Mom died unexpectedly.One minute she was fine and the next moment, she grabbed her head and collapsed.She was gone within a few hours.We were all left in a state of shock.Dad blamed himself.Although there was nothing he could have done, he thinks he should have been able to help her somehow.Hes filled with regrets, and it isnt just about what happened to Mom.I never knew my dad, Ellie whispered.She set her spoon aside as a deep sense of sadness settled over her.He and my mother divorced before I have any memories of him.You never had any contact with him following their divorce?Never.Toms face tightened.I think the marriage was so bad that he was looking to put it all behind him.By everything, do you mean you, too?Tom asked this as though he found the suggestion seriously wrong.In reality, Ellie couldnt blame her father, but she had missed knowing him.Have you ever thought about reaching out to him?Tom asked.When she was in grade school and later as a preteen shed wanted to write him a letter, but her mother claimed she had no idea where he lived or how to reach him.I did want to find him.Why didnt you?Mom claimed he didnt want anything more to do with us.Hed moved on with his life and so had she.Tom shook his head as if he found that hard to believe.You must have missed having a father.She lowered her gaze.It was as if Tom had read her heart.At various times in her youth, shed yearned to know her father, dreamed of what it would be like to have him in her life.As young as shed been when he left, she wondered if she might have been part of the reason.Perhaps shed been a cranky baby.Her mother once told Ellie how shed cried and cried with colic, keeping her parents awake all hours of the night.I think I might have been a difficult baby.So?What does that have to do with anything?Clenching her hands together, Ellie stared down at the table and tried to smile.I might have turned him off fatherhood.To the point hed abandon you?Tom asked incredulously.Youre joking, right?Ellie lifted one shoulder in a shrug.I dont know what else to think.The subject depressed her and she preferred not to discuss it.Do you mind if we talk about something else?she asked.Of course.He seemed to regret bringing up the subject.Soon afterward their entres arrived, and everything was delicious.The conversation drifted easily from one subject to the next.It helped that theyd become familiar with each other through email, phone calls, and social media.These first meetings could be awkward and uncomfortable, yet Ellie felt completely at ease with Tom.After dinner, Tom suggested a movie and Ellie agreed.Because the next showing wasnt for more than an hour, they decided to walk along the waterfront.The night was lovely, with a slight breeze blowing off the cove.Earlier, Jo Marie had suggested Ellie bring a cardigan, and she was glad shed taken her advice.Let me help, Tom offered, taking the sweater out of her hand and holding it while she slipped her arms into the sleeves.He brought it up to her shoulders and let his hands linger there.Of her own volition, Ellie leaned back, pressing her body against his, tucking her head beneath his chin.How well suited they were.She fit perfectly in his embrace and loved the feel of his arms around her.Ive dreamed of kissing you, he whispered close to her ear.Ellie smiled.Ive thought a lot about it, too.He slid his hands down the length of her arms.I cant believe youre really here.He turned her around so that they faced each other.His gaze delved deep into hers.After a lengthy moment, he broke eye contact and glanced around them.The waterfront area was crowded.Another couple, lost in conversation, strolled past, followed by a little boy around five who chased after a seagull, laughing as his short legs pumped for all he was worth.A dog barked in the distance.Tom expelled a harsh breath.Later, he whispered, and then reached for her hand as they continued down the waterfront pathway.I took a long walk earlier this afternoon, Ellie told him.Its so beautiful here with the cove and the Olympic Mountains in the background.I heard someone mention theyd spied a pod of killer whales close by.People hurried down to the marina, anxious to get a look.One of my greatest joys is being out on the water.I never have  my mother was always afraid something would happen to me.Youve never been in a boat?His look was incredulous.Not out so far that I couldnt swim to the shore.Would you like to go sailing with me?he asked eagerly, his eyes bright with excitement.I have a friend who owns a boat, and he offered to let me use it any time I want.Id love that.Tomorrow, then.Ill pick you up first thing in the morning.Can you be ready by nine?Sure.No problem.Ill take you around Puget Sound, and if were lucky well see a few killer whales.But I have other plans for us in the afternoon.You do?She made it a question, hoping hed fill her in on what hed scheduled.You want to share what they are?she asked, half pleading.He briefly hesitated and then shook his head.Its a surprise.You have to wait.You cant tell me now?In his previous emails and text messages, hed alluded to the fact that he had something special planned for her.To this point, hed refused to tell her what it was.From his hesitation, he seemed to fear she might not enjoy his surprise, which made Ellie all the more determined to be grateful and reassuring, no matter what it was.He shook his head.Youll have to wait until tomorrow.His worried expression changed, and he teased her by bouncing his index finger against the tip of her nose.Can I guess?Nope.He tucked her arm around his elbow as they lazily strolled toward the theater.It was an old fashioned one with a single screen, unlike the multiplex Ellie had seen advertised in the Cedar Cove Chronicle with ten theaters.He paid for their tickets.The movie was one Ellie had seen before, but it didnt matter if shed viewed it a thousand timesit would be fresh and new because she was sharing it with Tom.Popcorn?Tom asked, as they ventured inside the theater.Ellie pressed her hand against her stomach.Im still full from dinner.Tom grinned, and it struck her how attractive he was when he smiled.The truth was, he was appealing in every way, smile or no smile.What does it matter when we ate dinner?Its impossible to watch a movie without buttered popcorn, and they use real butter here, not that artificial stuff most theaters use.Real butter?Were getting popcorn, Tom insisted.He purchased a small bag for them to share.By the time they found their seats the theater was dark and previews played across the screen.Holding her by the hand, he led her to the far right hand side to the seat farthest from the door.Ellie stumbled along, hardly able to make her way in the dark.Because she carried the popcorn, Tom held down the seat for her.She made herself comfortable.Remember what I mentioned earlier about this dream Ive been having?Dream?About kissing you?His voice took on a husky whisper.In the theater?she whispered back, her smile so big it hurt her face.Honestly, Ellie, I dont think I can wait a second longer.For that matter, neither could she.10     Maggie woke slowly, coming out of a dream so blissful she didnt want it to end.Luxuriating in the warm feelings, she kept her eyes closed.The dream revolved around when shed first started dating Roy.They were both college students and deeply in love with the future, so bright and perfect, spread out before them.At one time that idyllic happiness, that sense that nothing could ever tear them apart, had been real.Even now it was hard to believe that it had dwindled down to the point where the love that held them together was a slender thread.As much as she wanted to linger in the dream, Maggie forced herself to pull back to reality.The blanket over her was warm and comfortable.Reluctant as she was to wake, Maggie accepted that while it was tempting, she couldnt nap forever.Roy was in the room.She could hear him sitting on the other side of the king size bed in a comfy overstuffed chair.Apparently, he was on the phone, because she could hear him whisper, although she couldnt make out the words.He kept his tone low.She didnt want him to know she was awake, and she listened as intently as she could.Her fear, rational or not, was that Katherine was on the other end of the line.The thought of the other woman caused her to go instantly cold.No, Roy said, and then repeated it a bit more loudly now.That wont work.What wouldnt work?Maggie wondered.Was it possible after everything theyd been through that Roy was setting up a rendezvous with the other woman?Maggie hated the way suspicious thoughts immediately assaulted her.She couldnt allow herself to give in to these fears.They would destroy her and destroy their marriage.At the same time, it helped her appreciate what Roy must be feeling about what had happened with her.Shed been so foolish, so stupid.It was hard to believe that she was capable of the crazy things shed done after learning about Roys emotional affair with the other woman.She stretched, purposely letting her husband know she was awake.Right away Roy ended the telephone conversation.I have to go, he whispered.No, I cant talk later.He was adamant about that, raising his voice.Maggie swallowed hard.It definitely sounded like a conversation her husband didnt want her to listen in on.Maggies waking up now.Good bye.Pretending to stir from sleep, Maggie raised her arms over her head and stretched again, arching her back.Hi, Roy said, coming to sit on the edge of the mattress.You certainly did sleep.She blinked up at him until she noticed the guilty look he wore.So it had been Katherine on the phone.Little wonder he hadnt wanted her to overhear the conversation.Maggie had told him before and she meant it: Any contact with the other woman, no matter how innocent, would not be tolerated.Roy had given her his word that the affair was over.Hed severed the relationship and his ties with the business that employed Katherine.One of the many reasons Maggie had married Roy Porter was because she felt he was a man of honor.He would abide by his word.Until recently, shed had no reason to doubt him.How long did I sleep?she asked, playing innocent.Roy checked his wrist and cocked his eyebrows as though he, too, was surprised.Almost two hours.That shocked Maggie.Two hours?My goodness  She hardly knew what to say.It was unheard of for her to take a two hour nap in the middle of the afternoon.By now it must be close to dinnertime.She sat upright and rubbed the sleep out of her face.You were exhausted.I must have been.The truth was, she hadnt slept well in more than a month.Although she was physically drained at the end of each day, she found it almost impossible to sleep.No doubt that was due to the constant tension between them.How are you feeling?Roy asked.He leaned forward and brushed the hair from her face, his look somewhat guarded.Maggie studied her husband, fearing what she saw in him was guilt.She bit back the hard questions and accusations.As difficult as it was, she forced herself to swallow her suspicions and pretend she hadnt heard any part of his conversation.Im feeling much better, she said, faking a smile.Physically, she felt fine, but her heart ached.She couldnt let this go.It would be easy to pretend, and frankly  maybe it was better not to know.If Roy had been talking to Katherine, Maggie would have an extremely difficult choice to make, and at the moment she didnt feel capable of choosing a dinner entre, let alone the fate of her marriage.She glanced at the digital readout from the clock on the nightstand.Its after six.You should have woken me.Its fine, Maggie, Roy reassured her.You needed the sleep.What about dinner?To her surprise, she discovered she was hungry.Do you feel up to it?She nodded, and Roy looked mildly surprised.Well, great.He stood and reached for his phone, which rested on the dresser top next to the chair where hed been sitting.Maggies gaze fell on it, too, and once again she was faced with indecision, with doubts and fears.Ill run a brush through my hair, she said, and climbed off the bed.She tossed aside the blanket, and to her amazement, Roy reached for it, folding it neatly and placing it at the foot of the bed.It wasnt like her husband to think of doing something like that.Right away, she sensed hed done it in an effort to avoid eye contact.Maggie closed the bathroom door and leaned against it while she tried to reason this out.If she allowed it, the conversation her husband had taken such pains to hide would ruin their weekend.She had to let it go or spoil everything these days away were meant to be.She refreshed her makeup and, after taking a moment to compose herself and her thoughts, joined Roy.When they came down the stairs, Jo Marie was in the kitchen with Rover.Oh Maggie, youre up, Jo Marie greeted.How are you feeling?She offered the other woman a reassuring smile.Much, much better, thank you.Were going out for dinner, Roy said.Any place youd like to recommend?Several, Jo Marie said, and opened a kitchen drawer.The brochure I gave you earlier lists area restaurants along with their signature dishes.If you mention youre from the inn, youre likely to be offered a discount.Great.Roy took the folded sheet out of his hip pocket, read it over, and handed it to Maggie.She glanced at it and then tucked it in the outside flap of her purse.They might be able to use it again later.They werent scheduled to return to Yakima until Sunday afternoon, which gave them all day Saturday and part of Sunday.Their plans for the rest of the weekend were flexible.They could go into Seattle easily enough.Or drive to any number of local attractions.What suits you?Roy asked, as they left the inn.Say again?For dinner.Did you take a look at the list of restaurants Jo Marie gave us?Oh.She should have realized what he meant.Anything is fine.His gaze narrowed.What if I want sushi?That was a joke.Roy had gone to a sushi restaurant with a few guys from the job site.Hed taken a fancy to the wide variety of fish and flavors so unlike the meat and potatoes of his childhood.Maggie had given sushi a fair try but was unable to get over the fact that they were eating raw fish.Id manage, she replied, as she got into the car.Roy didnt bother to hide his surprise.What about Mexican?he suggested, more serious this time.Sure.Whatever.Again, her lackadaisical response seemed to catch him by surprise.Youre generally pretty picky about where we dine out.Im not, either, she insisted, disliking his tone.You make it sound like I insist upon having my own way, and thats simply not true.Whoa, hold on, he said, raising his hand in a defensive posture.I didnt say anything of the kind.It was what you implied.It wasnt what I meant.Taking a moment, he went quiet and then exhaled before suggesting in a much calmer tone, Mexican might not be a good choice if your tummy is queasy.My stomach feels fine.I dont know what happened earlier, but Im feeling much better now.Okay, if Mexican food is what you want, then thats what itll be.He started the cars engine but kept his hands tightly grasping the steering wheel.Is something bothering you?No, she returned, far more adamantly than shed intended.Her husband exhaled sharply as if he knew she was lying but was unwilling to get involved in an argument.On the drive to the restaurant, Maggie kept her gaze focused on the scenery outside the passenger window, her head turned away from Roy.Neither spoke.It seemed to take an eternity to find the restaurant on the list.When they did pull into the parking lot for the Taco Shack it was full and Roy was forced to circle around once before he found an empty slot.The food must be good for them to be this busy, he commented.Maggie felt bad for the way shed snapped at him.Reaching across the confined space, she placed her hand on his arm.Im sorry, she whispered.I seem to be a bit out of sorts, dont I?For a moment, Maggie feared he wouldnt accept her apology.That happens with Jaxon, too, if hes slept too long.
