If Im going to have uncommitted sex with anyone, shes the perfect candidate.She has no emotional attachment to me either.So why the stress?said Gene.You have had sex before?Of course, I said.My doctor is strongly in favor.Frontiers of medical science, said Gene.He was probably making a joke.I think the value of regular sex has been known for some time.I explained further.Its just that adding a second person makes it more complicated.Naturally, said Gene.I should have thought of that.Why not get a book?The information was available on the Internet, but a few minutes of examining the search results on sexual positions convinced me that the book option would provide a more relevant tutorial with less extraneous information.I had no difficulty finding a suitable book and, back in my office, selected a random position.It was called the reverse cowboy position (variant 2).I tried itsimple.But, as I had pointed out to Gene, the problem was the involvement of the second person.I got the skeleton from the closet and arranged it on top of me, following the diagram in the book.There is a rule at the university that no one opens a door without knocking first.Gene violates it in my case, but we are good friends.I do not consider the Dean my friend.It was an embarrassing moment, especially as the Dean was accompanied by another person, but entirely her fault.It was fortunate that I had kept my clothes on.Don, she said, if you can leave off repairing that skeleton for a moment, Id like you to meet Dr.Peter Enticott from the Medical Research Council.I mentioned your work in cirrhosis and he was keen to meet you.To consider a funding package.She emphasised the last two words as though I was so unconnected with university politics that I might forget that funding was the center of her world.She was right to do so.I recognized Peter instantly.He was the former father candidate who worked at Deakin University, and who had prompted the cup stealing incident.He also recognized me.Don and I have met, he said.His partner is considering applying for the MD program.And we met recently at a social occasion.He winked at me.I dont think youre paying your academic staff enough.We had an excellent discussion about my work with alcoholic mice.Peter seemed highly interested and I had to reassure him repeatedly that I had designed the research so there was no need for external grants.The Dean was making hand signals and contorting her face, and I guessed that she wanted me to misrepresent my study as requiring funding, so that she could divert the money to some project that would not be funded on its merits.I chose to feign a lack of comprehension, but this had the effect of increasing the intensity of the Deans signaling.It was only afterward that I realized that I should not have left the sexual positions book open on the floor.I decided that ten positions would be sufficient initially.More could be learned if the initial encounter was successful.It did not take longless time than learning the cha cha.In terms of reward for effort, it seemed strongly preferable to dancing and I was greatly looking forward to it.I went to visit Rosie in her workplace.The PhD students area was a windowless space with desks along the walls.I counted eight students, including Rosie and Stefan, whose desk was beside Rosies.Stefan gave me an odd smile.I was still suspicious of him.Youre all over Facebook, Don.He turned to Rosie.Youll have to update your relationship status.On his screen was a spectacular photo of Rosie and me dancing, similar to the one that the photographer had given me and which now sat by my computer at home.I was spinning Rosie, and her facial expression indicated extreme happiness.I had not technically been tagged as I was not registered on Facebook (social networking not being an interest of mine), but our names had been added to the photo: Prof.Don Tillman of Genetics and Rosie Jarman, PhD Candidate, Psychology.Dont talk to me about it, said Rosie.You dont like the photo?This seemed a bad sign.Its Phil.I dont want him seeing this.Stefan said, You think your father spends his life looking at Facebook?Wait till he calls, said Rosie.How much does he earn?Are you screwing him?What can he bench press?Hardly unusual questions for a father to ask about a man whos dating his daughter, said Stefan.Im not dating Don.We shared a taxi.Thats all.Right, Don?Correct.Rosie turned back to Stefan.So you can stick your little theory where it fits.Permanently.I need to talk to you in private, I said to Rosie.She looked at me very directly.I dont think theres anything we need to say in private.This seemed odd.But presumably she and Stefan shared information in the same way that Gene and I did.He had accompanied her to the ball.I was reconsidering your offer of sex, I said.Stefan put his hand over his mouth.There was quite a long silence; I would estimate six seconds.Then Rosie said, Don, it was a joke.A joke.I could make no sense of this.I could understand that she might have changed her mind.Perhaps the problem around the sexual objectification response had been fatal.But a joke?Surely I could not be so insensitive to social cues to have missed the fact that she was joking.Yes, I could be.I had failed to detect jokes in the past.Frequently.A joke.I had been obsessing about a joke.Oh.When should we meet about the other project?Rosie looked down at her desk.There is no other project.nineteen   For a week, I did my best to return to my regular schedule, using the time freed up by Evas cleaning and the cancellation of the Father Project to catch up on the karate and aikido training that I had been missing.Sensei, fifth dan, a man who says very little, especially to the black belts, pulled me aside as I was working the punching bag in the dojo.Something has made you very angry, he said.That was all.He knew me well enough to know that once an emotion was identified, I would not let it defeat me.But he was right to speak to me, because I had not realized that I was angry.I was briefly angry with Rosie because she unexpectedly refused me something I wanted.But then I became angry with myself over the social incompetence that had doubtless caused Rosie embarrassment.I made several attempts to contact Rosie and got her answering service.Finally I left a message: What if you get leukemia and dont know where to source a bone marrow transplant?Your biological father would be an excellent candidate with a strong motivation to assist.Failure to complete the project could result in death.There are only eleven candidates remaining.She did not return my call.These things happen, said Claudia, over the third coffee meeting in four weeks.You get involved with a woman, it doesnt work out ...So that was it.I had, in my own way, become involved with Rosie.What should I do?Its not easy, said Claudia, but anyone will give you the same advice.Move on.Something else will turn up.Claudias logic, built on sound theoretical foundations and drawing on substantial professional experience, was obviously superior to my own irrational feelings.But as I reflected on it, I realized that her advice, and indeed the discipline of psychology itself, embodied the results of research on normal humans.I am well aware that I have some unusual characteristics.Was it possible that Claudias advice was not appropriate for me?I decided on a compromise course of action.I would continue the Wife Project.If (and only if) there was further time available, I would use it for the Father Project, proceeding alone.If I could present Rosie with the solution, perhaps we could become friends again.Based on the Bianca Disaster I revised the questionnaire, adding more stringent criteria.I included questions on dancing, racquet sports, and bridge to eliminate candidates who would require me to gain competence in useless activities, and increased the difficulty of the mathematics, physics, and genetics problems.Option (c) moderately would be the only acceptable answer to the alcohol question.I organized for the responses to go directly to Gene, who was obviously engaging in the well established research practice of making secondary use of the data.He could advise me if anyone met my criteria.Exactly.In the absence of Wife Project candidates, I thought hard about the best way to get DNA samples for the Father Project.The answer came to me as I was boning a quail.The candidates were doctors who would presumably be willing to contribute to genetics research.I just needed a plausible excuse to ask for their DNA.Thanks to the preparation I had done for the Aspergers lecture, I had one.I pulled out my list of eleven names.Two were confirmed dead, leaving nine, seven of whom were living overseas, which explained their absence at the reunion.But two had local phone numbers.One was the head of the Medical Research Institute at my own university.I rang it first.Professor Lefebvres office, said a womans voice.Its Professor Tillman from the Department of Genetics.Id like to invite Professor Lefebvre to participate in a research project.Professor Lefebvre is on sabbatical in the US.Hell be back in two weeks.Excellent.The project is Presence of Genetic Markers for Autism in High Achieving Individuals.I require him to complete a questionnaire and provide a DNA sample.Two days later, I had succeeded in locating all nine living candidates and posted them questionnaires, created from the Aspergers research papers, and cheek scrapers.The questionnaires were irrelevant but were needed to make the research appear legitimate.My covering letter made clear my credentials as a professor of genetics at a prestigious university.In the meantime, I needed to find relatives of the two dead doctors.I found an obituary for Dr.Gerhard von Deyn, a victim of a heart attack, on the Internet.It mentioned his daughter, a medical student at the time of his death.I had no trouble tracking down Dr.Brigitte von Deyn, and she was happy to participate in the survey.Simple.Geoffrey Case was a much more difficult challenge.He had died a year after graduating.I had long ago noted his basic details from the reunion website.He had not married and had no (known) children.Meanwhile the DNA samples trickled back.Two doctors, both in New York, declined to participate.Why would medical practitioners not participate in an important study?Did they have something to hide?Such as an illegitimate daughter in the same city that the request came from?It occurred to me that, if they suspected my motives, they could send a friends DNA.At least refusal was better than cheating.Seven candidates, including the younger Dr.von Deyn, returned samples.None of them was Rosies father or half sister.Professor Simon Lefebvre returned from his sabbatical and wanted to meet me in person.Im here to collect a package from Professor Lefebvre, I said to the receptionist at the city hospital where he was based, hoping to avoid an actual meeting and interrogation.I was unsuccessful.She buzzed the phone, announced my name, and Professor Lefebvre appeared.He was, I assumed, approximately fifty four years old.I had met many fifty four year olds in the past thirteen weeks.He was carrying a large envelope, presumably containing the questionnaire, which was destined for the recycling bin, and his DNA.As he reached me, I tried to take the envelope, but he extended his other hand to shake mine.It was awkward, but the net result was that we shook hands and he retained the envelope.Simon Lefebvre, he said.So, what are you really after?This was totally unexpected.Why should he question my motives?Your DNA, I said.And the questionnaire.For a major research study.Critical.I was feeling stressed and my voice doubtless reflected it.Im sure it is.Simon laughed.And you randomly select the head of medical research as a subject?We were looking for high achievers.Whats Charlie after this time?Charlie?I didnt know anyone called Charlie.All right, he said.Dumb question.How much do you want me to put in?No putting in is required.There is no Charlie involved.I just require the DNA ...and the questionnaire.Simon laughed, again.Youve got my attention.You can tell Charlie that.Shoot me through the project description.And the ethics approval.The whole catastrophe.Then I can have my sample?I said.A high response rate is critical for the statistical analysis.Just send me the paperwork.Simon Lefebvres request was entirely reasonable.Unfortunately I did not have the required paperwork, because the project was fictitious.To develop a plausible project proposal would potentially require hundreds of hours of work.I attempted an estimate of the probability that Simon Lefebvre was Rosies father.There were now four untested candidates: Lefebvre, Geoffrey Case (dead), and the two New Yorkers, Isaac Esler and Solomon Freyberg.On the basis of Rosies information, any one of them had a twenty five percent probability of being her father.But having proceeded so far without a positive result, I had to consider other possibilities.Two of our results relied on relatives rather than direct testing.It was possible that one or both of these daughters were, like Rosie, the result of extrarelationship sex, which, as Gene points out, is a more common phenomenon than popularly believed.And there was the possibility that one or more of my respondents to the fictitious research project might have deliberately sent a false sample.I also had to consider that Rosies mother might not have told the truth.It took me a long time to think of this, as my default assumption is that people will be honest.But perhaps Rosies mother wanted Rosie to believe that her father was a doctor, as she was, rather than a less prestigious person.On balance, I estimated the chance that Simon Lefebvre was Rosies father was sixteen percent.In developing documentation for the Aspergers research project, I would be doing an enormous amount of work with a low probability that it would provide the answer.I chose to proceed.The decision was barely rational.In the midst of this work, I received a phone call from a solicitor to advise me that Daphne had died.Despite the fact that she had been effectively dead for some time, I detected in myself an unexpected feeling of loneliness.Our friendship had been simple.Everything was so much more complicated now.The reason for the call was that Daphne had left me what the solicitor referred to as a small sum in her will.Ten thousand dollars.And she had also left a letter, written before she had gone to live in the nursing home.It was handwritten on decorative paper.Dear Don,  Thank you for making the final years of my life so stimulating.After Edward was admitted to the nursing home, I did not believe that there was much left for me.Im sure you know how much you have taught me, and how interesting our conversations have been, but you may not realize what a wonderful companion and support you have been to me.I once told you that you would make someone a wonderful husband, and in case you have forgotten, I am telling you again.Im sure if you look hard enough, you will find the right person.Do not give up, Don.I know you dont need my money, and my children do, but I have left you a small sum.I would be pleased if you would use it for something irrational.Much love,  Your friend,  Daphne Speldewind  It took me less than ten seconds to think of an irrational purchase: in fact I allowed myself only that amount of time to ensure that the decision was not affected by any logical thought process.The Aspergers research project was fascinating but very time consuming.The final proposal was impressive, and I was confident it would have passed the peer review process if it had been submitted to a funding organization.I was implying it had been, though I stopped short of forging an approval letter.I called Lefebvres personal assistant and explained that I had forgotten to send him the documents but would now bring them personally.I was becoming more competent at deception.I arrived at reception, and the process of summoning Lefebvre was repeated.This time he was not holding an envelope.I tried to give him the documents and he tried to shake my hand, and we had a repeat of the confusion that had occurred the previous time.Lefebvre seemed to find this funny.I was conscious of being tense.After all this work, I wanted the DNA.Greetings, I said.Documentation as requested.All requirements have been fulfilled.I now need the DNA sample and questionnaire.Lefebvre laughed again and looked me up and down.Was there something odd about my appearance?My T shirt was the one I wear on alternate days, featuring the periodic table, a birthday gift from the year after my graduation, and my pants were the serviceable pair that are equally suitable for walking, lecturing, research, and physical tasks.Plus high quality running shoes.The only error was that my socks, which would have been visible below my pants, were of slightly different colors, a common error when dressing in poor light.But Simon Lefebvre seemed to find everything amusing.Beautiful, he said.Then he repeated my words in what seemed to be an attempt to imitate my intonation: All requirements have been fulfilled.He added, in his normal voice, Tell Charlie I promise Ill read the proposal.Charlie again!This was ridiculous.The DNA, I said, forcefully.I need the sample.Lefebvre laughed as though I had made the biggest joke of all time.There were tears running down his face.Actual tears.Youve made my day.He grabbed a tissue from a box on the reception desk, wiped his face, blew his nose, and tossed the used tissue in the trash can as he left with my proposal.I walked to the trash and retrieved the tissue.twenty   I sat with a newspaper in the University Club reading room for the third day in succession.I wanted this to look accidental.From my position, I could observe the line at the counter where Rosie sometimes purchased her lunch, even though she was not qualified to be a member.Gene had given me this information, reluctantly.Don, I think its time to leave this one alone.Youre going to get hurt.I disagreed.I am very good at dealing with emotions.I was prepared for rejection.Rosie walked in and joined the line.I got up and slipped in behind her.Don, she said.What a coincidence.I have news on the project.Theres no project.Im sorry about ...last time you saw me.Shit!You embarrass me and I say sorry.Apology accepted, I said.I need you to come to New York with me.What?No.No, Don.Absolutely not.We had reached the cash register and failed to select any food and had to return to the end of the line.By the time we sat down, I had explained the Aspergers research project.I had to invent an entire proposalthree hundred and seventy one pagesfor this one professor.Im now an expert on the savant syndrome.It was difficult to decode Rosies reaction, but she appeared to be more amazed than impressed.An unemployed expert if you get caught, she said.I gather hes not my father.Correct.I had been relieved when Lefebvres sample had tested negative, even after the considerable effort that had been required to obtain it.I had already made plans, and a positive test would have disrupted them.There are now only three possibilities left.Two are in New York, and both refused to participate in the study.Hence, I have categorized them as difficult, and hence I need you to come to New York with me.New York!Don, no.No, no, no, no.Youre not going to New York and neither am I.   I had considered the possibility that Rosie would refuse.But Daphnes legacy had been sufficient to purchase two tickets.If necessary I will go alone.But Im not confident I can handle the social aspects of the collection.Rosie shook her head.This is seriously crazy.You dont want to know who they are?I said.Two of the three men who may be your father?Go on.Isaac Esler.Psychiatrist.I could see Rosie digging deep into her memory.Maybe.Isaac.I think so.Maybe a friend of someone.Shit, its so long ago.She paused.And?Solomon Freyberg.Surgeon.No relation to Max Freyberg?Maxwell is his middle name.Shit.Max Freyberg.Hes gone to New York now?No way.Youre saying Ive got one chance in three of being his daughter.And two chances in three of being Jewish.Assuming your mother told the truth.My mother wouldnt have lied.How old were you when she died?Ten.I know what youre thinking.But I know Im right.It was obviously not possible to discuss this issue rationally.I moved to her other statement.Is there a problem with being Jewish?Jewish is fine.Freyberg is not fine.But if its Freyberg, it would explain why my mother kept mum.No pun intended.Youve never heard of him?Only as a result of this project.If you followed football, you would have.He was a footballer?A club president.And well known jerk.What about the third person?Geoffrey Case.Oh my God.Rosie went white.He died.Correct.Mum talked about him a lot.He had an accident.Or some illnessmaybe cancer.Something bad, obviously.But I didnt think he was in her year.It struck me now that we had been extremely careless in the way we had addressed the project, primarily because of the misunderstandings that had led to temporary abandonments followed by restarts.If we had worked through the names at the outset, such obvious possibilities would not have been overlooked.Do you know any more about him?No.Mum was really sad about what happened to him.Shit.It makes total sense, doesnt it?Why she wouldnt tell me.It made no sense to me.He was from the country, Rosie said.I think his father had a practice out in the sticks.The website had provided the information that Geoffrey Case was from Moree in northern New South Wales, but this hardly explained why Rosies mother would have hidden his identity if he was the father.His only other distinguishing feature was that he was dead, so perhaps this was what Rosie was referring toher mothers not wanting to tell her that her father had died.But surely Phil could have been given this information to pass on when Rosie was old enough to deal with it.While we were talking, Gene entered.With Bianca!They waved to us, then went upstairs to the private dining section.Incredible.Gross, said Rosie.Hes researching attraction to different nationalities.Right.I just pity his wife.I told Rosie that Gene and Claudia had an open marriage.Lucky her, said Rosie.Are you planning to offer the same deal to the winner of the Wife Project?Of course, I said.Of course, said Rosie.If that was what she wanted, I added, in case Rosie had misinterpreted.You think thats likely?If I find a partner, which seems increasingly unlikely, I wouldnt want a sexual relationship with anyone else.But Im not good at understanding what other people want.Tell me something I dont know, said Rosie, for no obvious reason.I quickly searched my mind for an interesting fact.Ah ...the testicles of drone bees and wasp spiders explode during sex.It was annoying that the first thing that occurred to me was related to sex.As a psychology graduate, Rosie may have made some sort of Freudian interpretation.But she looked at me and shook her head.Then she laughed.I cant afford to go to New York.But youre not safe by yourself.There was a phone number listed for an M.  Case in Moree.The woman who answered told me that Dr.Case Sr., whose name was confusingly also Geoffrey, had passed away some years ago and that his widow, Margaret, had been in the local nursing home with Alzheimers disease for the past two years.This was good news.Better that the mother was alive than the father: there is seldom any doubt about the identity of the biological mother.I could have asked Rosie to come with me, but she had already agreed to the New York visit and I did not want to create an opportunity for a social error that might jeopardize the trip.I knew from my experience with Daphne that it would be easy to collect a DNA sample from a person with Alzheimers disease.I rented a car and packed swabs, cheek scraper, ziplock bags, and tweezers.I also took a university business card from before I was promoted to associate professor.Doctor Don Tillman receives superior service in medical facilities.Moree is 1,230 kilometers from Melbourne.I collected the rental car at 3:43 p. m.  after my last lecture on Friday.The Internet route planner estimated fourteen hours and thirty four minutes of driving each way.When I was a university student, I had regularly driven to and from my parents home in Shepparton and found that the long journeys had a similar effect to my market jogs.Research has shown that creativity is enhanced when performing straightforward mechanical tasks such as jogging, cooking, and driving.Unobstructed thinking time is always useful.I took the Hume Highway north and used the precise speed indication on the GPS to set the cruise control to the exact speed limit, rather than relying on the artificially inflated figure provided by the speedometer.This would save me some minutes without the risk of lawbreaking.Alone in the car, I had the feeling that my whole life had been transformed into an adventure, which would culminate in the trip to New York.I had decided not to play podcasts on the journey in order to reduce cognitive load and encourage my unconscious to process its recent inputs.But after three hours, I found myself becoming bored.I take little notice of my surroundings beyond the need to avoid accidents, and in any case the freeway was largely devoid of interest.The radio would be as distracting as podcasts, so I decided to purchase my first CD since the Bach experiment.The gas station just short of the New South Wales border had a limited selection, but I recognized a few albums from my fathers collection.I settled on Jackson Brownes Running on Empty.With the repeat button on, it became the soundtrack to my driving and reflections over three days.Unlike many people, I am very comfortable with repetition.It was probably fortunate that I was driving alone.With my unconscious failing to deliver anything, I attempted an objective analysis of the state of the Father Project.What did I know?1.I had tested forty one of forty four candidates.(And also several of those of incompatible ethnic appearance. )None had matched.There was the possibility that one of the seven Aspergers survey respondents who had returned samples had sent someone elses cheek scraping.I considered it unlikely.It would be easier simply not to participate, as Isaac Esler and Max Freyberg had done.2.Rosie had identified four candidates as being known to her motherEamonn Hughes, Peter Enticott, Alan McPhee, and, recently, Geoffrey Case.She had considered the first three as high probability, and Geoffrey Case would also qualify for this category.He was now clearly the most likely candidate.3.The entire project was reliant on Rosies mothers testimony that she had performed the critical sexual act at the graduation party.It was possible that she had lied because the biological father was someone less prestigious.This would explain her failure to reveal his identity.4.Rosies mother had chosen to remain with Phil.This was my first new thought.It supported the idea that the biological father was less appealing or perhaps unavailable for marriage.It would be interesting to know whether Esler or Freyberg were already married or with partners at that time.5.Geoffrey Cases death occurred within months of Rosies birth and presumably the realization that Phil was not the father.It might have taken some time for Rosies mother to organize a confirmatory DNA test, by which time Geoffrey Case might have been dead and hence unavailable as an alternative partner.This was a useful exercise.The project status was clearer in my mind, I had added some minor insights, and I was certain that my journey was justified by the probability that Geoffrey Case was Rosies father.I decided to drive until I was tireda radical decision, as I would normally have scheduled my driving time according to published studies on fatigue and booked accommodation accordingly.But I had been too busy to plan.Nevertheless, I stopped for rest breaks every two hours and found myself able to maintain concentration.At 11:43 p. m. , I detected tiredness, but rather than sleep I stopped at a gas station, refueled, and ordered four double espressos.I opened the sunroof and turned up the CD player volume to combat fatigue, and at 7:19 a. m.  on Saturday, with the caffeine still running all around my brain, Jackson Browne and I pulled into Moree.twenty one   I had set the GPS to take me to the nursing home, where I introduced myself as a family friend.Im afraid she wont know you, said the nurse.This was the assumption I had made, although I was prepared with a plausible story if necessary.The nurse took me to a single room with its own bathroom.Mrs.Case was asleep.Shall I wake her?asked the nurse.No, Ill just sit here.Ill leave you to it.Call if you need anything.I thought it would look odd if I left too quickly, so I sat beside the bed for a while.I guessed Margaret Case was about eighty, much the same age as Daphne had been when she moved to the nursing home.Given the story Rosie had told me, it was very possible that I was looking at her grandmother.As Margaret Case remained still and silent in her single bed, I thought about the Father Project.It was only possible because of technology.For all but the last few years of human existence, the secret would have died with Rosies mother.I believe it is the duty of science, of humanity, to discover as much as we can.But I am a physical scientist, not a psychologist.The woman in front of me was not a fifty four year old male medical practitioner who might have run from his parental responsibilities.She was totally helpless.It would be easy to take a hair sample, or to swab her toothbrush, but it felt wrong.For these reasons, and for others that I did not fully grasp at the time, I decided not to collect a sample.Then Margaret Case woke up.She opened her eyes and looked directly at me.Geoffrey?she said, quietly but very clearly.Was she asking for her husband or for her long dead son?There was a time when I would have replied without thinking, Theyre dead, not out of malice but because I am wired to respond to the facts before others feelings.But something had changed in me, and I managed to suppress the statement.She must have realized that I was not the person she had hoped to see, and began crying.She was not making any noise, but there were tears on her cheeks.Automatically, because I had experienced this situation with Daphne, I pulled out my handkerchief and wiped away the tears.She closed her eyes again.But fate had delivered me my sample.I was exhausted, and by the time I walked out of the nursing home, there were tears in my own eyes from lack of sleep.It was early autumn, and this far north the day was already warm.I lay under a tree and fell asleep.I woke to see a male doctor in a white coat standing over me, and for a frightening moment I was taken back to the bad times of twenty years ago.It was only momentary; I quickly remembered where I was, and he was only checking to see that I was not ill or dead.I was not breaking any rules.It was four hours and eight minutes since I had left Margaret Cases room.The incident was a timely reminder of the dangers of fatigue, and I planned the return trip more carefully.I scheduled a five minute break every hour, and at 7:06 p. m.  I stopped at a motel, ate an overcooked steak, and went to bed.The early night enabled a 5:00 a. m.  start on the Sunday.The highway bypasses Shepparton, but I took the turnoff and went to the city center.I decided not to visit my parents.The extra sixteen kilometers involved in driving the full distance to their house and back to the highway would add a dangerous unplanned increment to what was already a demanding journey, but I did want to see the town.I drove past Tillman Hardware.It was closed on Sunday, and my father and brother would be at home with my mother.My father was probably straightening pictures, and my mother asking my brother to clear his construction project from the dining table so she could set it for Sunday dinner.I had not been back since my sisters funeral.The gas station was open.so I was able to fill the tank.A man of about forty five, BMI about thirty, was behind the counter.As I approached, I recognized him and revised his age to thirty nine.He had lost hair, grown a beard, and gained weight, but he was obviously Gary Parkinson, who had been at high school with me.He had wanted to join the army and travel.He had apparently not realized this ambition.I was reminded how lucky I was to have been able to leave and reinvent my life.Hey, Don, he said, obviously also recognizing me.Greetings, GP.He laughed.You havent changed.It was getting dark on Sunday evening when I arrived back in Melbourne and returned the rental car.I left the Jackson Browne CD in the player.Two thousand, four hundred and seventy two kilometers, according to the GPS.The handkerchief was safe in a ziplock bag, but its existence did not change my decision not to test Margaret Case.We would still have to go to New York.I met Rosie at the airport.She remained uncomfortable about my purchasing her ticket, so I told her she could pay me back by selecting some Wife Project applicants for me to date.Fuck you, she said.It seemed we were friends again.I could not believe how much baggage Rosie had brought.I had told her to pack as lightly as possible, but she exceeded the seven kilogram limit for carry on luggage.Fortunately I was able to transfer some of her excess equipment to my bag.I had packed my ultralight PC, toothbrush, razor, spare shirt, gym shorts, change of underwear, and (annoyingly) bulky parting gifts from Gene and Claudia.I had only been allowed a weeks leave, and even then, the Dean had made it difficult.It was increasingly obvious that she was looking for a reason to get rid of me.Rosie had never been to the United States but was familiar with international airport procedures.She was highly impressed by the special treatment that I received.We checked in at the service desk, where there was no line, and were accompanied through security to the business class lounge, despite traveling in economy class.As we drank champagne in the lounge, I explained that I had earned special privileges by being particularly vigilant and observant of rules and procedures on previous flights, and by making a substantial number of helpful suggestions regarding check in procedures, flight scheduling, pilot training, and ways in which security systems might be subverted.I was no longer expected to offer advice, having contributed enough for a lifetime of flying.Heres to being special, said Rosie.So, whats the plan?Organization is obviously critical when traveling, and I had an hour by hour plan (with hours subdivided as necessary) replacing my usual weekly schedule.It incorporated the appointments that Rosie had made to meet the two father candidatesEsler the psychiatrist and Freyberg the cosmetic surgeon.Amazingly, she had made no other plans beyond arriving at the airport to meet me.At least it meant that there were no incompatible schedules to reconcile.I opened the schedule on my laptop and began outlining it to Rosie.I had not even completed my list of activities for the flight when she interrupted.Fast forward, Don.What are we doing in New York?Between Saturday dinner at the Eslers and Freyberg on Wednesdaywhich is evening, right?We have four whole days of New York City in between.Saturday, after dinner, walk to the Marcy Avenue subway station and take the J, M, or Z train to Delancey Street, change to the F train  Overview, overview.Sunday to Wednesday.One sentence per day.Leave out eating, sleeping, and travel.That made it easy.Sunday, Museum of Natural History; Monday, Museum of Natural History; Tuesday, Museum of Natural History; Wednesday  Stop, wait!Dont tell me Wednesday.Keep it as a surprise.Youll probably guess.Probably, said Rosie.How many times have you been to New York?This is my third.And Im guessing this is not going to be your first visit to the museum.No.What did you think I was going to do while you were at the museum?I hadnt considered it.I presume youve made independent plans for your time in New York.You presume wrong, said Rosie.We are going to see New York.Sunday and Monday, Im in charge.Tuesday and Wednesday its your turn.If you want me to spend two days at the museum, Ill spend two days at the museum.With you.But Sunday and Monday, Im the tour guide.But you dont know New York.Nor do you.Rosie took our champagne glasses to the bar to top them up.It was only 9:42 a. m.  in Melbourne, but I was already on New York time.While she was gone, I flipped open my computer again and connected to the Museum of Natural History site.I would have to replan my visits.Rosie returned and immediately invaded my personal space.She shut the lid of the computer!Incredible.If I had done that to a student playing Angry Birds, I would have been in the Deans office the next day.In the university hierarchy, I am an associate professor and Rosie is a PhD student.I was entitled to some respect.Talk to me, she said.Weve had no time to talk about anything except DNA.Now weve got a week, and I want to know who you are.And if youre going to be the guy who tells me who my father is, you should know who I am.In less than fifteen minutes, my entire schedule had been torn apart, shattered, rendered redundant.Rosie had taken over.An escort from the lounge took us to the plane for the fourteen and a half hour flight to Los Angeles.As a result of my special status, Rosie and I had two seats in a row of three.I am only placed next to other passengers when flights are full.Start with your childhood, said Rosie.All it needed was for her to turn on the overhead light for the scenario of interrogation to be complete.I was a prisoner, so I negotiatedand made escape plans.We have to get some sleep.Its evening in New York.Its seven oclock.Who goes to bed at seven?Anyway, I wont be able to sleep.Ive brought sleeping pills.Rosie was amazed that I would use sleeping pills.She thought I would have some objection to chemicals.She was right about not knowing much about me.We agreed that I would summarize my childhood experienceswhich, given her background in psychology, she would doubtless consider hugely significanteat dinner, take the sleeping pills, and sleep.On the pretext of visiting the bathroom, I asked the cabin manager to bring our dinner as quickly as possible.twenty two   Telling Rosie my life story was not difficult.Every psychologist and psychiatrist I have seen has asked for a summary, so I have the essential facts clear in my mind.My father owns a hardware store in a regional city.He lives there with my mother and my younger brother, who will probably take over when my father retires or dies.My older sister died at the age of forty as a result of medical incompetence.When it happened, my mother did not get out of bed for two weeks, except to attend the funeral.I was very sad about my sisters death.Yes, I was angry too.My father and I have an effective but not emotional relationship.This is satisfactory to both of us.My mother is very caring but I find her stifling.My brother does not like me.I believe this is because he saw me as a threat to his dream of inheriting the hardware store and now does not respect my alternative choice.The hardware store may well have been a metaphor for the affection of our father.If so, my brother won, but I am not unhappy about losing.I do not see my family very often.My mother calls me on Sundays.I had an uneventful time at school.I enjoyed the science subjects.I did not have many friends and was briefly the object of bullying.I was the top student in the school in all subjects except English, where I was the top boy.At the end of my schooling I left home to attend university.I originally enrolled in computer science but on my twenty first birthday made a decision to change to genetics.This may have been the result of a subconscious desire to remain a student, but it was a logical choice.Genetics was a burgeoning field.There is no family history of mental illness.I turned toward Rosie and smiled.I had already told her about my sister and the bullying.The statement about mental illness was correct, unless I included myself in the definition of family.Somewhere in a medical archive is a twenty year old file with my name and the words depression, bipolar disorder?OCD?and schizophrenia?The question marks are important: beyond the obvious observation that I was depressed, no definitive diagnosis was ever made, despite attempts by the psychiatric profession to fit me into a simplistic category.I now believe that virtually all my problems could be attributed to my brains being configured differently from those of the majority of humans.All the psychiatric symptoms were a result of this difference, not of any underlying disease.Of course I was depressed: I lacked friends, sex, and a social life, because I was incompatible with other people.My intensity and focus were misinterpreted as mania.And my concern with organization was labeled as obsessive compulsive disorder.Julies Aspergers kids might well face similar problems in their lives.However, they had been labeled with an underlying syndrome, and perhaps the psychiatric profession would be intelligent enough to apply Occams razor and see that the problems they might face would be largely due to their Aspergers brain configuration.What happened on your twenty first birthday?asked Rosie.Had Rosie read my thoughts?What happened on my twenty first birthday was that I decided that I needed to take a new direction in my life, because any change was better than staying in the pit of depression.I actually visualized it as a pit.I told Rosie part of the truth.I dont generally celebrate birthdays, but my family had insisted in this case and had invited numerous friends and relatives to compensate for my own lack of friends.My uncle made a speech.I understood that it was traditional to make fun of the guest of honor, but my uncle became so encouraged by his ability to provoke laughter that he kept going, telling story after story.I was shocked to discover that he knew some extremely personal facts, and I realized that my mother must have shared them with him.She was pulling at his arm, trying to get him to stop, but he ignored her and did not stop until he noticed that she was crying, by which time he had completed a detailed exposition of my faults and of the embarrassment and pain that they had caused.The core of the problem, it seemed, was that I was a stereotypical computer geek.So I decided to change.To a genetics geek, said Rosie.That wasnt exactly my goal.But it was obviously the outcome.And I got out of the pit to work hard in a new discipline.Where was dinner?Tell me more about your father.Why?I wasnt actually interested in why.I was doing the social equivalent of saying over to put the responsibility back on Rosie.It was a trick suggested by Claudia for dealing with difficult personal questions.I recalled her advice not to overuse it.But this was the first occasion.I guess because I want to see if your dad is the reason youre fucked up.Im not fucked up.Okay, not fucked up.Sorry, I didnt mean to be judgmental.But youre not exactly average, said Rosie, psychology PhD candidate.Agreed.Does fucked up mean not exactly average?Bad choice of words.Start again.I guess Im asking because my father is the reason that Im fucked up.
