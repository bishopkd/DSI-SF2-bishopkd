You have exceptional hearing.Yeah, its a teacher thing.Theyll probably argue about the expenses several times between now and the wedding and theyll spend more than they plan to because its always more.But I use all the flowers I order so the bouquets and arrangements will be stunning, and thats a fact.Im very good at this.Whered you get the program that pulls the flowers together?Mamie and Ross, the couple I worked for, daydreamed about something like that.We could make up sample arrangements and bouquets, photograph them and load them on the computer, but this is state of the art.I worked on it with a nerdy girl I met in Portland.I admit she did most of the program work, but I designed the site and loaded the flowers and arrangements.Isnt it great?Its like creating an online greeting card.Mamie and Ross sold it to a couple of noncompeting florists.I think they got a good price.Did you get a good price?he asked.More than that, I got my future.Seven  				For Ray Anne Dysart, life was more productive and satisfying than ever before, at least as far as she could remember.She had her real estate business, mostly property management, small but respectable.She owned her own home, something she had worked hard to make happen as a hedge against retirement, even though she had no intention of retiring until she had no other option.She had her best friends, Lou McCain Metcalf and Carrie James.And she had Al.Dear Al.He was hardly her first steady man.She was a little afraid to think about what number he was in a long line of previous beaux and lovers; in fact, she had been married three times.All water over the dam.Al was the most special man shed ever known and completely unlike her usual type.He was a mechanic for one thinggrease under the blunt nails on those big calloused, gentle hands.He was physical, rough and ready and the best natured man she knew.Plus, he had those three foster sons.Yes, there was a time Ray Anne had wanted children but shed gotten over that a long while back.The boys, Justin, Danny and Kevin, were nineteen, fifteen and thirteen respectively.Good boys and Al kept them in line, but Ray Anne didnt feel equipped to be a parent to boys, foster or otherwise.She was a girlie girl.Yet she couldnt help but admit she enjoyed them and got a kick out of the way Al was able to manage them.She felt she was thriving with Al and his family of boys.Of course, most of the time it was just Al she was with.She saw him every day.She would swing by Luckys, the service station where he worked.Or he would drop by her house before or after his shift, provided his boys were taken care of.Sometimes they met at the diner for a quick meal or Cliffhangers for a drink.Cliffs was the only restaurant in town with tablecloths.Sometimes they managed a whole evening or day off together; sometimes she joined Al and the boys for dinner.And if they planned carefully, she and Al could get naked and have some real quality time.Once or twice a week.Like now.It was Sunday, early afternoon.Al had the day off.The boys had driven to the nursing home where their mother resided.They visited her at least once a week, such devoted sons.Ray Anne took complete advantage of the opportunity when the boys were otherwise occupied.She stretched out in bed.She smiled.She could hear the shower running.Al had spent the morning in her garage, changing the oil in her car, checking her brakes and such.He wanted to clean up before joining her in bed.She wore one of her sheer lacy, seductive little nighties, waiting.Her cell phone chimed and she frowned.It better not be important, she thought.Shed been looking forward to a little time alone with her man.It was her cousin, Dick.Ray Anne had very little family, but she and Dick had been close growing up and kept in touch.She picked up.Dickie, let me call you back in a little while...Its important, Ray, he said.Call me back right away, okay?As soon as you can?Whats so important?Its Ginger, he said.Shes just not doing well.I dont know what more to do.Me and Sue, were out of ideas.Shes had counseling, talked to the minister, her friends have tried to boost her up.We thought maybe if she went to stay with you for a little while...Honey, I dont know what to do, either.Could you think about it?Even if its only a few weeks?Because we worry about her and she just wont help herself.We thought maybe a change...Do you have any idea how gloomy it is here in winter?I wouldnt expect it to lift her spirits any.And besides, Im in a. ..Well, Im in a relationship and its hard enough finding time.Ray, its almost spring and you always got a relationship, dont you?Girl, I think I need help this time.Could you just think about it?See if you get any ideas that could help us out?Because we dont want to lose her.Aint we lost enough?She took a deep breath.Sure.Of course.Let me think about this.Let me ask some of my close friends for ideas.They know a lot more about kids and family stuff.I love her, you know that.The shower stopped.I just dont know anything about how to help in a situation like hers.And God, Id hate myself forever if I just made it worse.You know Im not much of a mommy kind of girl.You were her fairy godmother, he said.Just the sight of you made her happy.Well, the sight of me is damn hard to fix up these days.Im not young anymore.Neither am I, he said.And she isnt that young, either.Ill call you later, okay?Thanks.Anything you can do.Thanks.She clicked off and sat on the edge of the bed.Thinking.Dickie had always been there for her.He was a hardworking trucker whod ended up with his own company and any time Ray Anne had a problema man, a big bill she couldnt pay, a need to move, a co signer, a shoulderhe never asked a single question, never hesitated.He was there.His wife, Sue, wasnt quite as warm and loving toward her, but she sure accepted her and never balked when Ray and Dickie got together or when Dickie helped Ray Anne out.And theyd never asked much of her.Al came out of the bathroom, towel wrapped around his waist, rubbing a smaller towel over his short hair.His arms and shoulders were muscled, his belly flat, a body that usually filled her with all kinds of dirty expectations.But she was distracted.Did I hear you talking?he asked.She still gripped the phone.She lifted it and showed him.My cousin, Dickie.Remember, his daughter was the one whose baby diedcrib death.Yeah, he said, kind of wearily.He sat down beside her.I wasnt likely to forget about that.In fact, way back in Als youth when he was a young husband, he and his wife had lost their only child the very same way.Al had spent decades trying to run away from that sorrow.Poor thing.Well, shes not good.Shes not getting better.Shes grief stricken and theyve tried everything from medication to counseling and Dickie wants me to take her in for a while, even if its only a few weeks.Why?he asked.Because she was my little princess and always loved staying with me.But shes not a little princess nowshes a thirty year old woman whose baby died and I dont think I can help her get over it with facials and mani pedis.She looked up at him.I wouldnt have the first idea what to do.I might just make it worse.Al shifted into the bed, stretching out his long legs as he leaned against the headboard.He pulled her back into his arms.Ray Anne, just being you puts a smile on most faces.Youre kind and sweet and funnymaybe that would lighten her spirits a little bit.You could let her talk about it.Ugh, she said before she could stop herself.I know, I know.But they know youre not a professional counselor.I mean, your cousin and his missus.They dont expect you to cure her or anything, right?They just want her to have a safe place to go, right?I think so, she said.The poor thing.Her marriage was breaking up when she was barely pregnant, so she was alone.Had the baby alone.She moved back with her parents so she could take three months off work and she never went back because...How do you get someone over something like that?Honey, you dont, Al said, pulling her closer against him, holding her in the crook of his big arm.You cant get someone over something.All you can do is give em a little love and space and pray.You pray, baby?She laughed in a short, sarcastic huff.All my damn life, but my prayers werent very holy.Please God, let that big stud buy me a drink.He laughed at her.I think you should let her come.You do?Like we dont have enough complications...I think if you dont, you might not get over it later.Sometimes we have to do things like that just to keep from having too many regrets.He kissed her forehead.Might have to get a room at the Coast Motel again.Then he laughed.She doesnt work, Ray Anne said.What am I going to do with her?You should talk to your girlsLou and Carrie.Theyve been through some rough times.So have you, for that matter.Indeed, she had.An abusive husband, a couple of acrimonious divorces, getting financially wiped out by at least one of them.That was just for starters.Shed learned a lot, been around the block a time or two.Shed even lost a child, but hardly anyone knew about that.And her baby hadnt died the way Gingers had.Hers was a secret teenage mishap that ended sadly and shed never talked about until very recently.Im not smart or wise enough, she said.Youre the smartest woman I know.And youre so full of love I cant even hold all of you.She turned her head to look up at him.Ive never had anyone like you in my life before.Really, I havent.Youre the best thing that ever happened to me.I feel the same, he said.Weve got an awful lot on our plates, she said.Bounty, he said.Thats what we call a full plate.Bounty.Hope it doesnt kill us, Ray Anne said.* * *  				Al planned to take his two younger boys to the high school basketball game on Friday night.Lous husband, Joe, was a trooper who worked the swing shift four nights a week and Carrie didnt open the deli early on Saturday mornings.Friday night was a perfect night to get together with her girlfriends, so Ray Anne reached out to see if they felt like a little hen party at her housea little wine and whine.Come to my house, instead, and Ill put out some snacks.You bring the wine and Ill invite Gina, Carrie said, including her daughter, who was also Lous niece in law.If Mac is working or something, shell just sit around at home.If thats okay with you.Of course Gina was a welcome addition, anytime.For a woman under forty, she was very prudent in the ways of the world.When Ray Anne arrived at Carries, the others were already there and Rawley was just leaving.Youre not staying for the hen party?she asked.I aint no hen, he said, pulling down his cap.Thought I explained that.Rawley is babysitting tonight, Carrie said from behind him.Cooper and Sarah want to go out without the baby.Really?Ray Anne asked.How are you with babies?Perfect, he said.If they go to bed and stay there.The women had gotten used to having Rawley in the background of their little gatherings, silently serving them, saying nothing unless specifically asked, hiding out in front of the TV when sports were playing while they gathered in the kitchen.Well miss you, Ray Anne told him.Having you around at a girls night is kind of like having a butlerthere to serve, but not there at all.I reckon youll have to get your own food and drink and do your own dishes tonight, he said.Dont wear yourself out.And with that, he was gone.The women were sitting around the kitchen table where Carrie had put out a selection of her best hors doeuvres.As Ray Anne moved toward the table, Gina held up an empty wineglass, more than ready for Ray Annes contribution to the party.She quickly uncorked one chilled white and one red.Will Rawley come back?Ray Anne asked Carrie.Carrie merely shrugged and reached for a crab ball from the platter in the center.Does he stay over?Sometimes, Carrie said.If he doesnt want to drive all the way to Elmore, to his house.Ray Anne put both bottles on the table and sat down.She lifted one of Carries amazing crab balls and raised her eyes heavenward.I have such a hard time picturing you and Rawley together.Romantically, that is.Then dont, Carrie advised.But seriously, are you a couple now?I mean, I know hes been around for months, like your boyfriend and partner, but...Not everyone is as comfortable talking about the personal side of things as you are, Carrie said.He has his own room, Gina pointed out.When everyone stared at her, including her mother, she added, Well, he does!He has my old room.Which doesnt mean anything, just that its the way they want it!But believe me, I knock before walking in now.Seriously?Lou said.His own room?Jesus, are you set in your ways or what.Very much so, Carrie said.Rawley is, too.Ive gotten so used to him, I dont know what Id do without him.He loves to cook, clean up, shop and run errands.Very exciting, Lou said.Thats all the excitement I can stand.The women were incredibly different.Just a look at them would make anyone wonder what they could possibly have in common.Carrie was plump and grandmotherly; she had never colored her short, steel gray hair.She nurtured with food that was lovingly and thoughtfully prepared.Lou was small, trim, fit, kept her shoulder length auburn hair free of gray and looked younger than her sixty two years.Gina was lovely, blond, midthirties with an eighteen year old daughter and three stepchildren and had been working at the diner for years and years, yet she looked like a girl.And then there was Ray Anne.She teased her blond hair, wore her clothes on the tight, short, sexy side, her heels as high as possible.Well, she was short.But that had nothing to do with it, really.She liked them.Shed always worn more makeup, long nails, fancier and, for lack of a better word, spicier clothing.Lou called her a Dolly Parton knockoff and Ray Anne was not offended.The women werent alike in many other ways, either.Lou was an educator who had raised her nephew Mac and then helped him raise his three children after his wife left him.Carrie had been a single mother and small business ownerthe deli and catering.Gina had only married Mac a year ago or so and became the instant mother of a big crowd.Only Ray Anne had been this solitary, childless woman.But somehow they understood one another.Remember my cousin Dickie?she asked, sipping her wine.Remember his daughter, Ginger, whose baby died a while back?Terrible, Lou said, shaking her head.Was that almost a year ago?Almost nine months.Last summer, Ray Anne said.Nothing could be harder than that, Carrie said.Poor thing, Gina said.Shes coming to stay with me for a little while, Ray Anne said.And Im terrified.You?Lou asked.Terrified?I didnt know anything scared you.This does.Her daddy called mehe said she was still in a world of hurt.I knew she wasnt getting better.Shes been so depressed she cant work and can hardly get out of bed, lost a ton of weight and is so pitiful she cant talk to anyone for five minutes before she just has to go someplace to be alone.Shes still in terrible pain.How sad, Carrie said.Are you going to try to cheer her up?Oh, Lord, what do I know about that kind of grief?Ray Anne said.If her daddy hadnt asked me, begged me really, I never wouldve signed up for this.I have no idea what Im supposed to do!Has she had counseling?Lou asked.Yes, theyve tried that.She even took antidepressants for a while.And I know there was some grief group at the church or something.That didnt go well, either.We can look around here for a counselor or grief group.Wouldnt hurt to try again, Lou said.I thought she was your niece, Gina said.Shes like a niece.Dickies like a brother.He and Sue had two little boys then along came Gingersnap and I was in heaven!A pretty little thing who could have fun spending the night at my housewed curl our hair, paint our nails, cream our faces, shave our legs...we shaved when she was a little older.We watched musicals and Disney shows together, dressed up, went shopping.I drove to Portland to help her pick out a prom dress, and I helped her stage her weddingI was the official bridal assistant.Got way under Sues skin, Ill tell you that, but my little Gingersnap was so happy!Shes married?No, Ray Anne said.No, her marriage only lasted a couple of years and was falling apart right as she realized she was pregnant and her husband, the bastard, didnt even try to give it a chance to help raise his own baby.So Ginger did it on her own.At the end of her pregnancy she moved home with her mom and dad.Theyd fixed up the upstairs for her so she and the baby had rooms of their own and she could save some money.She worked right up till she started labor.Four months later her little baby boy died in his sleep.What did your cousin ask you to do for her?Gina asked.Nothing, Ray Anne said with a helpless shrug.He said the change might help, but he didnt ask anything specific of me.I think theyre worn out, thats what I think.It was Dickie and Sues loss, too.They have other grandchildren, but this little one lived with themtheir babys baby.And I suppose the others cant get any attention because everyone is busy grieving.She rested her head in her hand.Ill be useless.Ill probably just sit around and cry with the poor thing.For an hour or so, maybe, Carrie said.Then youll be done with that.Listen, I dont have any natural parenting skills.None.God knew what he was doing when I didnt get to have children.Youd have been an ideal parent, Lou said.Gods mistake.Me?Oh, believe me, I know nothing about being a parent and even less about what I can do to help my poor little Ginger while she goes through this terrible time.This is the worst idea Dickie has ever had, and hes had some real stinkers.No, this is perfect, Lou said.Shes right, Carrie agreed.Wont be so easy on you, but then when our youngsters hurt, its awful.Worse for us, I think.But of all the people I know...yes, youre the one to do it.How can you say that?Ray Anne demanded.I know about some of your tough times, Carrie said.Ive seen you through a few of them since you came to Thunder Point.Money trouble, broken hearts, struggles...There were a couple of times that were pretty awful.You had a mean son of a bitch husband stalk you and you had to run and hide.You had a good friend diewhat was her name?Marisa Dunaway, Ray Anne said, and tears instantly sparkled in her eyes.She was a good friend for twenty years and the Big C took her, but not until it kicked her ass, made her so sick and weak she was begging to die.Horrible.Horrible.And your parents died when you were little more than a girl, Lou reminded her as if she needed reminding.She was twenty two and her parents, both in their late fifties, died so close together, both of cancer.That had been forty years ago.Cancer treatment had come a long way since then, but still, it had taken her best friend ten years ago.That was a dark time for you.We werent friends then, she added.I wasnt there for you.I didnt even know you then.Youve been through a lot since Ive known you, Carrie said.But you never indulged self pity.You grieved hard, but never felt sorry for yourself.Ginger has a right to feel sorry for herself, Ray Anne said.This isnt about rights, Lou chimed in.You had a right to self pity, too.But youre a survivor.And youre a damn good role model.Your cousin is doing a smart thing, sending his daughter to you.Ray Anne looked at Lou in surprise.I didnt think you liked me enough to say something like that, she said.Its those shoes I never understood, Lou said.And you did steal all my boyfriends until I started keeping them secret from you.But I always admired your strength.Youre a woman on your own, alone, except for a couple of girlfriends and your recent boyfriend, but we dont count on boyfriends.Women alone have to be smart, strong and durable.We dont bruise easy.And we cant waste time and energy feeling sorry for ourselves.We might want to collapse, but we dont.Probably no one would pick us up!You, too, Ray Anne said.When Macs wife left him  				Ach!Lou barked.Alone with three little kidsthe smallest nine months old!Practically no money, two low paying jobs and his only relative was me.I was a full time teacher.I dont know how we got through it.And he was a mess!A pathetic, broken mess.Talk about self pity!Sometimes when you have someone to lead, its easier to be strong.What am I going to do?Ray Anne asked.Be yourself, Gina said, smiling.Be your wonderful, loving, strong self.Let her talk, push her a little bit, like my mother pushed me when I was a sixteen year old mother with no one but her.Get her a little counseling help, bring her around your friends, prop her up with example.Let her see we dont give up, we work.Sure we cry, sometimes scream, but we take it one day at a time and make every day a little better than the one we just left behind.Youre really one of the best people for the job, I know it.I had no idea you all thought that way about me.Pfft.The only thing I feel sorry for you about is that you just cant dress yourself properly.You should be in double knits and wedgies like the rest of us over sixty broads, Lou said.Dont listen to her, Carrie said.The best part about you is youre unique.As long as you dont make me dress like a cocktail waitress I wont make you dress like a gray haired grandmother.Ray Anne couldnt answer.She felt the emotion in her throat.Shed give anything to be a grandmother.You really think Ill be able to help her?If you have trouble...if you have frustrations, well get together and hash it out.Weve all been through the bitter side of life.It comes with breathing.Giving up was never an option, Carrie said.I have a confession to make, Ray Anne said.Its not like I didnt feel sorry for myself sometimes.Ive cried my heart out.Sometimes I cried till I couldnt stand up straight.Its just that I never cried like that in front of anyone.I know, three voices replied together.* * *  				Carrie was having trouble falling asleep.She heard the front door open and close.Then she heard the soft drone of the TV and she rolled over and looked at the clock.Almost one in the morning.She got up and found her robe and opened her bedroom door.Did I wake you up?Rawley asked.She shook her head.I was tossing around, not sleeping.She gave her neck a stretch, tilting her head from side to side, trying to touch her chin to each shoulder.This is so late for you.That Cooper.He thinks hes a kid.They went to some party up in North Bend with some of Sarahs old Coast Guard pals.Sarah had to drive him home.Hell pay for that.I hope so.Why arent you sleeping?I think too much, she said.Come here, girl, he said.When she sat beside him on the couch, he turned her so he could rub her shoulders.Kids okay?he asked as he massaged.Theyre all fine.Its Ray Annes kin thats having trouble.She told him about Ginger and her need for a change of scenery.Brings to mind how I always complained so much about how hard my life was when I never lost anything that dear.You lost a husband, he reminded her.Exactly as I said.Nothing very dear.He made a sound that was almost a laugh.Now you got some old vet taking up space in your house.You fit in so well, too.You hardly ever visit that house in Elmore anymore, she said.I almost never go to that house.I keep it as insurance for you.She looked over her shoulder at him.What does that mean?Means I dont want you to worry none if you start to feel crowded and need your spacetheres a place I can go.But I aint got hardly a shirt left over there anymore.I never thought Id end up living in some womans house.Whod a thought thered be a woman could put up with me?Youre the easiest man Ive ever known.No one ever accused me of that before.Rawley, Ive been happy.She patted one of the hands that massaged her tight shoulders.Youre a good man.Ill do my best never to be a burden.Im the burden!she said.Bad knees, sore back and neck, a family that just seems to grow, friends who count on me, a demanding business!He leaned forward and kissed her cheek right below the ear.His lips were dry and his face whiskery, but she leaned back against him for a moment.We get along fine, he said.And you just tell me when you need something.Ill help if I can and get out of the way if I cant.Since we dont have all that much time, might as well enjoy it.I hope theres plenty of time!she said.I might be getting creaky but Im not ready to give up.Especially now that lifes gotten so sweet.Maybe I shouldve said, there aint likely to be enough time.I know what.Lets find the lotion and Ill give you a proper rubdown.Get some of those creaks out.That sounds lovely.Carrie went to her bedroom; the lotion was on the bedside table.The television was turned off and Rawley padded into the bedroom in his stocking feet.Carrie lay down on her side and, after just a minute, Rawley lay down behind her, rubbing lotion between his leathery palms.She lifted her pajama top all the way up, almost over her shoulders, baring her back and most of her front.My hands are gonna be a little cold, he said.I think maybe you should consider renting that house in Elmore.You could let it bring you some income.You in need of money, girl?She sighed.No, Rawley.For the first time in my life, I think I have everything I need.Then maybe well sell that house.Put the money against retirement.He put a hand on her shoulder and pulled a little, rolling her toward him.How many houses we need?Only one, as far as I can see, she said.Think anyone really notices?In this town they notice everything, he said.Think I really care?She laughed with him for a minute, then she rolled back so he could rub her back.He had strong, kind hands, the sort of hands shed never expected to feel on her bare back.Thats so nice, she murmured.Eight  				Troy parked his Jeep behind the flower shop and called Grace.Im done at Coopers.Is it too late for me to come by?Im with one of my other boyfriends, she said.He grinned at that.Can you ask him to step aside for a little while?Is this a booty call?No, its not, as a matter of fact.I wanted to tell you something, but if you turn it into a booty call, I probably wont fight you off.She laughed.When will you be here?Im parked in the alley.And its not really so late.Come up!He was already standing at the top of the stairs when she opened the door.You didnt work very late tonight, she said, pulling him inside.She put her arms around his neck, kissing him.You know what?I really like this boyfriend stuff.Its very convenient.I was just thinking about a kiss.He pulled her closer.You were, were you?He nuzzled her neck and pressed against her.He fit so well against her soft curves, even though she was much shorter.He put his hands under her butt and lifted her, lining them up even better.Then he kissed her again.I thought you wanted to tell me something, she whispered against his lips.Right, he said distractedly, kissing her again.No rush.Of course he began to grow against her enticing form.If you keep this up, youll forget what you wanted to tell me, she warned him.No worries.Itll come back to me.You okay?With you?Always okay.He kept kissing, then touching, then gyrating.Aw, Gracie, he moaned.Lets talk a little later, all right?All right.Bed?Sofa?Table?Floor?He swallowed.Wall?She giggled.I could rip your clothes off right here, he said.Oh?And do you sew?She pulled his hand from her breast and led him to the bed.It will be more practical if we just undress.Ripping and tearing could be fun, but problematic.What if Im feeling a little wild?he asked, smiling into her pretty eyes.You can get a little wild when were naked, she said, dropping her jeans and shedding her denim shirt.I can do that, he said, getting rid of his clothes even faster.She was down to her tiny panties, so sheer and small they almost werent there.He followed her onto the bed and reached for those panties with one big hand.Oops, he said, ripping a short seam.Youre very hard on my underwear.Im surprised you have any left, he said.I love my panties.Not as much as I do!God, Gracie, I think you were expecting me, he said, covering her mouth with his and separating her knees with one of his.You have no idea what you do to me.Just as long as I can do it to you again, she whispered.And again...* * *  				Even with all the romances Grace had read, just dreaming about true love, nothing had prepared her for what it would really feel like.As she lay naked in Troys arms, enjoying postcoital bliss, catching her breath, ready for sleep, she sighed his name.Right here, baby, he said, pulling her tighter against him.I think you spoil me.Thats my intention.You feel good?Im ruined for other men.Good.I cant think about you ever being with another man.They were quiet for a few seconds.You said ever, she said.He rolled her over until she was on top of him, her hair a mussed canopy around their faces.I did.You bring out some feelings in me that I dont recognize.I dont want to think about you ever being with anyone else.I dont want to be with anyone else.He brushed back her hair.I should slow down, right?Because youre not ready for talk like that.Your other boyfriends never try to hold you down like that.She shook her head.Pretend boyfriends rarely didthey were both all too aware of that.Here was the first flesh and blood boyfriend to hold her, love her, possess her.She didnt want anything to change.We both know whats missing from this perfect relationship, he said.Missing?she asked.What youve told me about yourself, about growing up, wouldnt fill a chapter in one of your romances, Grace.Even your paper boyfriends would have questions.But you havent asked me any questions, she said.He shook his head.I told you, you can trust me.And when you feel safe youll tell me.You think Im hiding something.It wasnt a question.He nodded.Its all right.Im hiding a few things, too.Just things I dont talk about a lot.Iraq.I hate talking about Iraq, except sometimes with my boyswe laugh about terrible things that arent really funny.There were youthful scrapes here and there.Trouble in high school, but nothing worse than the kids I teach now run into.We have years.We have plenty of time to learn everything about each other.I hope we dont take too long.But what if I say something that changes everything?she asked him.See, thats the other thing missingyou know me, Gracie.You think Im that kind of guy?That Id measure you?Judge you by something in your past?Youre an amazing, beautiful, kind, wonderful woman.I dare you to try to change my opinion.She chewed her bottom lip.Do it, she told herself.Do it now.But she couldnt.Not naked!Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?Is that why you came over tonight?He looked startled for a moment, then he started to laugh.He rolled with her again so that she was beneath him.No, no.Gracie, the second you put your lips on me, you empty my brain!Dont you understandI cant stay away from you?If Im alone with you, I cant think of anything but getting busy.Then I want to do it again.Then I want to eat.Does everyone make love this much?I dont know.They should.I think were getting better, dont you?She nodded and smiled.I wanted to come over and tell youa friend of mine is coming to visit in a couple of weeks, if it works out.And I have to ask a favorcan I stay with you while hes here?I dont have an extra room or bed.If it was just Denny, Id take the couch, but hes bringing his wife and shes pregnant.I think they could use a decent place to sleep and a little privacy.You stay here half the time anyway, she said.Will you check your calendar, because if you have a wedding or something, well change dates.Hes a farmer, see, and he either comes before the planting gets serious or he has to wait till after harvest.A farmer?she asked.You never mentioned a friend whos a farmer.Hes a buddy from the Marines and he stumbled on this organic farm down in California.He was just helping out while he was looking for a better job and it turned out he liked it.His wife is a teacher like me, that means its weekends or nothing.A farmer and a teacher?she asked.Wow, thats so...normal!With normal childhoods, no medals or stalkers, going to school every day, going to the prom, getting speeding tickets or into fights or falling in love like normal kids...Wait till Denny tells you about his farmits pretty far out.Socan you check for weddings?Because I know you have to keep the shop open, at least a little bit, but I was hoping we could have some fun with them.If I dont have any big events I can post a notice that Ill close early on that Saturday.That would be great, Gracie.If you wouldnt mind too much, if it doesnt cost too much.Because we could have fun.And with Becca pregnant, it wont be anything too adventurous.So, youre not going to risk your life this time?she asked.He snuggled closer.Gracie, sweetheart, wiggle up against me...yeah, just like that.Move those perfect little hips, aah.Youre a witch, arent you?Tell me about Dennys farm, she said.No, were not talking about him anymore.Hes a buzzkill.He grabbed her legs at the backs of her knees, lifting them, tilting her upward.God, youre magic.Im glad I taught you how to do this.She couldnt help but laugh at him.Dont you think Id have caught on eventually?Are you really going to take credit?It makes me feel manly, he said.Then his breath caught.God, he said when he felt her hand on him, gently stroking.Gracie, Gracie, youre a witch...Youre going to kill me, thats what youre going to do.Please, kill me.She directed him into her, felt him fill her, dug her heels in and pushed against him.Then she wrapped her legs around him and rode with him, stroke for delicious stroke, just like theyd been doing it for years.She came first.When she felt him let go, she held on.He liked it when she did that.And when he was coming down she whispered, so softly he might not have heard, I love you.He didnt say I love you, too.* * *  				Troy was in a daze when he went into the bathroom in Graces loft.He was thinking about her beautiful smile, her perfect laugh, the body that welcomed him so naturally, as if they were experienced lovers when they were really new.His fulfillment was always complete, leaving him weak and grateful.And shed said she loved him.His heart was so full he was tempted to push the issue then and there, tell her what he knew, force her to come clean with him so they could get on with their lives.But it would be better if she came to him with the truth, trusted him.He went back to bed, crawled in beside her and pulled her into his arms.He pulled her hair aside and kissed the back of her neck.Hmm.I thought you were hungry.Honey, we have to get you on the pill.Soon.She rolled onto her back and looked at him.Huh?I think its time for us to stop messing around with just a condom.Theyre not a hundred percent.So, what are you getting at?she asked.We should be better protected.Is there any reason youre not on the pill?It never occurred to me before.Before you.Yeah, of course.You should see the doctor.Or PeytonPeyton could take care of you if you prefer a woman.We dont want to have to deal with complications like pregnancy.She gasped.You mean I could be pregnant?You shouldnt beweve been careful.But its not worth the gamble.It would be a bummer to get pregnantthats not the plan.That could put a serious damper on our fun.Our fun?she asked softly.You can say pregnant and fun in the same sentence?Well, Im not in the market for a baby, are you?he asked.He grabbed her small waist.At least it would be a few months before your belly got in the way of our good times.Then he laughed at his own joke.Did you just say that?Really?That it would get in the way of our good times?Sorry.I shouldnt joke about it.Listen, can you do it?Check with the doctor and see if you can take the pill?Sure, she said.Then she rolled away from him and closed her eyes and her mouth before she screamed.* * *  				Grace didnt stir when Troy got up early.She feigned sleep while he dressed, kissed her cheek and left to go back to his apartment to get ready for work.When her loft was quiet, she rolled over on her back and blinked.She wasnt sure why she felt so emotional.He was right, after all.This was no time to get caught.But she was a hopeless romanticshe wanted love, marriage, children, happily ever after.Weddings were a big part of her job, after all.It was just that when a guy youd whispered love words to talked about the possibility of an accidental pregnancy, shouldnt he say something tender?Something like Please dont worryId never leave you to deal with it alone.Or maybe, You know how much I care about you.Or how about a real stretch?Itll be okay, Grace, because I love you.Then she asked herself, was she expecting him to do it all when she still hadnt been completely honest with him?After all, the secret of who she was wasnt shameful.It was just weird and complicated.She had no idea how hed react.Would he let it out?Would Grace Dillon vanish as she became Izzy Banks all over again?She opened the shop a little early, tidied up and made herself a list, and the top of the list was a visit to the clinic.She refreshed the water in the flowers in the cooler.Shed go see Peyton as soon as the clinic opened to get it over with.When she heard the bell to the shops front door jingle, she peeked out and almost had a heart attack.There stood Peyton!She had a sudden irrational fear that Troy had called her, told her to go take care of Grace.Are you all right?Peyton asked.Did I startle you or something?I just...I mean, I was just going to walk down to the clinic to see if you were available.What a coincidence!Im totally available, Peyton said, smiling.Scotts covering for me.Whats up?You feeling okay?Im fine, Grace said.But why are you here?she asked.Well, Scott and I plan to get married on my folks farm in late April.Everything will be blooming and there will be a lot of fruit blossoms involved.Is there enough time to talk about some other wedding flowers?Ill have to check my bookI have a couple of weddings in April.But theres plenty of time to order and make up arrangements and bouquets, she said happily.This was her comfort zone.While she talked flowers, shed work on her confidence.After an hour of flower talk, shed be ready.What have you got there?she asked, indicating a flat box Peyton held under one arm.Some pictures.I knowusually the florist shows the bride to be flowers.But a wedding on the farm is unlike anything youve ever seen before.The pear trees will be in full bloom.If its a warm winter theyll start early and if its a late spring theyll just be starting.My mothers gardens will be blooming and so will my aunts and cousins.When a Basque girl gets married, everyone brings flowers and food.She laughed a little.Even when the girl is thirty five!It doesnt sound like you need me, Grace said.But yes, I do.Let me show you.Come on back, Grace invited.The worktable was still clean because it was early.Grace only had a couple of orders to make up later, to be delivered tomorrow.They sat at a corner of the large table and Peyton leafed slowly through a lot of loose pictures, describing them as her brothers wedding, her oldest sisters wedding, her youngest sisters wedding.She got married quicklyno pear blossoms for her.We had to order from the flower growers.I thought my mother would have a stroke over thather baby, getting married off the farm.To add to the insult, she married a chef and he insisted his restaurant cater.The fact that Im finally getting married, in late spring, on the farmit goes a long way to helping her get over it.These pictures are gorgeous.They should be published, Grace said.The trellises were adorned with blossoms, and the women wore flowers in their hair.The tables sitting outside for the reception had arrangements on each one.The women carried beautiful bouquets and the buffet table that held enough food for an army also displayed roses, gardenias, cherry and pear blossoms, hydrangea, roses, babys breath and rich, dark fern.It was a fortune in flowers, and a great deal of work.More than Grace could possibly manage alone.Youre right, Ive never seen anything like it.Who did the flowers?My family, she said.Id like to do a few things differently.I cant imagine why, Grace said, flipping through picture after picture.Well, I certainly cant find any fault with it, except for two thingsmy mother works too hard and every wedding in our family looks the same.Everyone contributes so much.I know they love it, but it becomes almost a competition.She shook her head.Not almost.It is a competitionin the kitchen, in the garden, everywhere you look.Were going to change a few things.For starters, were going to get married in a very old church in Mount Angel in an ecumenical service, not outside with the orchard as backdrop.The Catholic Basque relatives will be a little put out, but they wont boycott.There are too many of them anyway.There are so many of them, were thinking of renting actors to play the parts of Scotts familyhis family is so small by comparison.But our friends from Thunder Point will make up the difference.I want to supply some flowers, the bouquets, altar arrangements, boutonnieres and corsages.My mother and aunts can decorate the tent...Tent?My father likes the men to dance under the stars.I want to rent a tent, a dance floor and a bandstand.Im hiring a Basque band from San Francisco.Im sure theyll step aside long enough for my father, my brothers and uncles and others to have a turn, but I want my parents to celebrate with me.If it rains, and rain in spring is not at all unusual in north Oregon, well be covered.And I want Scotts mothers to have a good time.If possible.Mothers?Grace asked.His mother and his late wifes mother.The grandmothers.If you pay attention, youll hear him complain about them, but I have a mother, grandmother, a million aunts and cousins all over the place, all the way to Spain and France.The Basque people are the only ethnic group to come from two countries, Spain and France, and the tradition and ritual in the old country, even though there is no old country anymore, is rigid and colorful and often troublesome as they argue over control.His mothers cant hold a candle to that!So there will still be pear and cherry blossoms?Grace asked almost weakly.Thousands, Peyton said.I grew up on that farm.Im committed to a zillion flowers and fruit blossoms and bees!she said, laughing.The sheep are not invited!Oh, God, it sounds amazing!I hate bees, Grace added.Im sure Scott will be packing an EpiPen if you have a reaction.Because, of course, the reason Im asking you for flowers is because Id like you to attend if you can.Im kind of hoping youll bring some of the flowers.I realize its a very long trip for a delivery.Invited?Me?Of course!I love the flowers my mother and aunts bring, but Id like a few different blooms this time.Day lilies, calla lilies, hybrid roses, maybe some more tropical blossoms, an orchid or two.If you dont count my younger brother who is divorced, Im officially the last Lacoumette to marry.Ive already talked to my mother about the flowers and the food...The food?Grace asked.Shell be cooking and freezing for weeks, but Im holding her back.I wouldnt celebrate without her more famous dishes but my brother in law, the chef, owns a five star restaurant!I want him to participate.Hes gifted and hes honored to be asked.If you want to really compliment a Basque, praise their cooking, dancing, music making or children raising.My mother is being very stoic about this, that Lucas would provide some of the food.At least hes family.She laughed and shook her head.They wont share recipes with each other, its hilarious.Peyton, this sounds huge.Maybe bigger than I am.I dont want to buck tradition.We have to buck tradition, she said.Im Basque but my fianc isnt.Hes getting married, too!Although...he cant get enough of them, of that farm.Hes so happy when hes there.I cant take him there too often or hell grow big as a bull!No one loves to eat like Scott.That made Grace smile.Troy could probably give him a run for his money.Peytons dark eyes twinkled.She was silent for a moment.Hows that going?You and Troy?Nice, Grace said.Tell me about your family.About how you met Scott.About the farm and the culture and the traditional Basque wedding.Peyton explained that she was the oldest of eight and, no, she hadnt been dreaming of a big family!She had been determined to be single for a long while but now that shed found Scott and his two kids, she was very anxious to have one, maybe two, to add to the pack.She described her parents, her siblings, nieces and nephews, talked about Scott and how he was the last thing she ever expected.She explained the Basque people as best she could, how she worked in a Basque clinic in the south of France for a while after graduating from college, getting to know the old country.Grace couldnt wait to do a little online research about the culture.Almost two hours had passed before they got around to blooms and stalks, number of guests and colors.Its spring.Im dressing my bridesmaids in all the spring colorslavender, pink, baby blue and yellow.I want a colorful wedding!I want their bouquets to match their dresses and mine to represent all of them.I want spring colors in the altar arrangements, then well take them to the farm for the reception.The grooms dinner is Scotts responsibility and hes chosen a hotel in Portland that can cater in a banquet hall and I offered flowers, which his mother snapped up immediately.There will be at least thirty people at the dinner.There will be about two hundred people, all arriving in cars, RVs, trucks with camper shells and fifth wheels.My mother thinks the tent for the reception is uppity, and my father complains it will block the sky, but he already contacted cousins in the old country to send him crates of their best wine.We always have to rent tables so at least no one is complaining about that.But I want a waitstaff and bartenders for this event, if only to help with the cleanup.My family should celebrate and enjoy the fruits of their labors.It sounds positively wonderful, Grace said somewhat dreamily.I cant imagine having that many family members around to celebrate.Oh, there will be arguing, too, she said.Fights, even.Big familiesbig control issues.Theyre very opinionated, very strong, very nosy.There is always lots of laughter, lots of yelling.Id love to do this, Grace said.But Ill be honest, Ive never done a wedding this big or this far away.The people I worked for before coming here to open the shop are in Portland.I know they could do it...Get them to help you, if you want, Peyton said.I only want two things from youflowers and to see you dance at my wedding.I hope a lot of people from Thunder Point will be there.Grace gave the situation some thought.There were many different ways this could be accomplished.She could order the flowers and even make the bouquets and arrangements and drive up with themthe van was refrigerated in back.Or, she could transport the flowers and make them into bouquets and arrangements once there.
