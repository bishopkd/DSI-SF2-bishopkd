Geordie had watched the castle since dawn.No one had left in the morning save a small kitchen party going to fetch supplies.So they were still here, somewhere.Randall was a captain; likely no one ranked higher in a prison garrison, save Sir Fletcher himself.Presumably Randall could thus command the castles resources so as to provide him with some suitable spot in which to torture a prisoner at his leisure.And torture it surely was.Even if it was meant to end in hanging, the man I had seen at Fort William was a cat by nature.He could no more resist the chance to play with this particular mouse than he could alter his height or the color of his eyes.I took a deep breath, resolutely shoving aside thoughts of what might have happened since morning, and charged out the door myself, colliding full force with an English Redcoat rushing in.The man reeled backward, staggering with tiny running steps to keep his balance.Thrown off balance myself, I crashed heavily into the doorjamb, numbing my left side and banging my head.I clutched the doorpost for support, the ringing in my ears chiming with the echoes of Ruperts voice: Ye have a moment of surprise, lass.Use it!It was open to question, I thought dizzily, who was more surprised.I groped madly for the pocket that held my dagger, cursing my stupidity for not having entered the cell with it already drawn.The English soldier, balance recovered, was staring at me with his mouth agape, but I could feel my precious moment of surprise already slipping away.Abandoning the elusive pocket, I stooped and drew the dagger from my stocking in a move that continued upward with all the force I could muster.The knifepoint took the advancing soldier just under the chin as he reached for his belt.His hands rose halfway to his throat, then, with a look of surprise, he staggered back against the wall, and slid down it in slow motion, as the life drained away from him.Like me, he had come to investigate without bothering to draw his weapon first, and that small oversight had just cost him his life.The grace of God had saved me from this mistake; I could afford no more.Feeling very cold, I stepped over the twitching body, careful not to look.I dashed back the way I had come, as far as the turning by the stairs.There was a spot here by the wall where I would be sheltered from view from both directions.I leaned against the wall and indulged myself in a moment of trembling nausea.Wiping my sweaty hands on my skirt, I dredged the dirk from its hidden pocket.It was now my only weapon; I had neither time nor stomach enough to retrieve my sock knife.Perhaps that was as well, I thought, rubbing my fingers on my bodice; there had been surprisingly little blood, and I shrank from the thought of the gush that would follow if I pulled the knife free.Dagger now safely in hand, I peered cautiously out into the corridor.The prisoners I had inadvertently released had gone to the left.I had no idea what they were set on doing, but they would likely occupy the English while they were doing it.With no reason to pick one direction over another for my search, it made sense to move away from whatever commotion they caused.The light from the high slit windows fell aslant behind me; this was the west side of the castle, then.I must keep my bearings as I moved, since Rupert would be waiting for me near the south gate.Stairs.I forced my numbed mind to think, trying to reason my way to the spot I was looking for.If you wanted to torture someone, presumably you wanted both privacy and soundproofing.Both considerations pointed to an isolated dungeon as the most likely spot.And the dungeons in castles such as this were customarily underground, where tons of earth muffled any cries, and darkness hid all cruelty from the eyes of those responsible.The wall rounded into a curve at the end of the corridor; I had reached one of the four corner towersand the towers had stairs.The spiral stair opened around another curve, the wedge shaped steps plunging down in dizzying flights that deceived the eye and twisted the ankles.The plunge from the relative light of the corridor into the gloom of the stairwell made it even harder to judge the distance from one stair to the next, and I slipped several times, barking my knuckles and skinning my palms on the stone walls as I caught myself.The stairway yielded one benefit.From a narrow window let in to save the stairwell from total darkness, I could see the main courtyard.At least I could now orient myself.A small group of soldiers was drawn up in neat red lines for inspection, but not, apparently, to witness the summary punishment of a Scottish rebel.There was a gibbet in the courtyard, black and foreboding, but unoccupied.The sight of it was like a blow in the stomach.Tomorrow morning.I clattered down the stairs, heedless of scraped elbows and stubbed toes.Hitting the bottom in a swish of skirts, I stopped to listen.Dead silence all around, but at least this part of the castle was in use; there were torches in the wall sconces, dyeing the granite blocks in pools of flickering red, each pool ebbing into darkness at its edges before the pool of the next torch leached into light again.Smoke from the torches hung in grey swirls along the vaulted roof of the corridor.There was only one way to go from this point.I went, dagger still gripped at the ready.It was eerie to be pacing softly down this corridor.I had seen similar dungeons before, as a day tripper, visiting historic castles with Frank.But then the massive granite blocks had been stripped of their menace by the glare of fluorescent tubes hung from the arches of the cavernous ceiling.I remembered recoiling from the small, dank chambers, even in those days, when they had been in disuse for over a century.Seeing the remnants of old and horrible ways, the thick doors and the rusting manacles on the wall, I had been able, I thought, to imagine the torments of those imprisoned in these forbidding cells.I would have laughed now at my naivete.There were some things, as Dougal said, that the imagination was simply not equal to.I tiptoed past bolted doors three inches thick; thick enough to smother any sound from inside.Bending close to the floor, I checked for a strip of light at the base of each door.Prisoners might be left to rot in darkness, but Randall would need to see what he was doing.The floor here was gummy with ancient dirt, covered with a thick layer of loose dust.Apparently this part of the prison was not in current use.But the torches showed that someone was down here.The fourth door in the corridor showed the light I was looking for.I listened, kneeling on the floor with my ear pressed against the crack, but heard nothing more than the thin crackle of a fire.The door was unlocked.I pushed it open a small crack and peered cautiously within.Jamie was there, sitting on the floor against one wall, curled into himself with his head between his knees.He was alone.The room was small, but well lit, with a rather homely looking brazier in which burned a cheery fire.For a dungeon, it was remarkably cozy; the stone flags were halfway clean, and a small camp bed leaned against one wall.The room was further furnished with two chairs and a table, on which sat a number of objects, including a large pewter flask and horn cups.It was an astonishing sight, after my visions of dripping walls and scuttling rats.It occurred to me that perhaps the garrison officers had furnished this snuggery as a refuge in which to entertain such female companionship as they could induce to visit them within the prison; clearly it had the advantage of privacy over the barracks.Jamie!I called softly.He didnt raise his head or answer me, and I felt a thrill of fear.Pausing only long enough to shut the door behind me, I crossed rapidly to him and touched his shoulder.Jamie!He looked up then; his face was dead white, unshaven and sheened with a cold sweat that had soaked his hair and shirt.The room stank of fear and vomit.Claire!he said, speaking hoarsely through lips cracked with dryness.How did youye must get out of here at once.Hell be back soon.Dont be ridiculous.I was assessing the situation as rapidly as I could, hoping that concentration on the job at hand would ease the choking sensation and help melt the large ball of ice in the pit of my stomach.He was chained by the ankle to a bolt in the wall, but otherwise unfettered.A coil of rope among the rubble of objects on the table had plainly been used, though; there were raw marks on his wrists and elbows.I was puzzled by his condition.He was clearly dazed and every line of his body was eloquent with pain, but I could see no obvious damage.There was no blood and no wound visible.I dropped to my knees and began methodically to try the keys of my ring on the manacle around his ankle.What has he done to you?I asked, keeping my voice low for fear of Randalls return.Jamie swayed where he sat, eyes closed, the sweat beading in hundreds of tiny pearls on his skin.Plainly he was near to fainting, but opened his eyes for a moment at my voice.Moving with exquisite care, he used his left hand to lift the object he had been cradling in his lap.It was his right hand, almost unrecognizable as a human appendage.Grotesquely swollen, it was now a bloated bag, blotched with red and purple, the fingers dangling at crazy angles.A white shard of bone poked through the torn skin of the middle finger, and a trickle of blood stained the knuckles, puffed into shapeless dimples.The human hand is a delicate marvel of engineering, an intricate system of joints and pulleys, served and controlled by a network of millions of tiny nerves, exquisitely sensitive to touch.A single broken finger is enough to sink a strong man to his knees with nauseated pain.Payment, Jamie said, for his nosewith interest.I stared at the sight for a moment, then said in a voice that I didnt recognize as mine, Im going to kill him for this.Jamies mouth twitched slightly as a flicker of humor forced its way through the mask of pain and dizziness.Ill hold your cloak, Sassenach, he whispered.His eyes closed again and he sagged against the wall, too far gone to protest my presence further.I went back to work on the lock, glad to see that my hands were no longer shaking.The fear was gone, replaced by a glorious rage.I had gone through the complete ring of keys twice, and still found none that would turn the lock.My hands were growing sweaty and the keys slid through my fingers like minnows as I began to try the most likely ones again.My muttered cursing roused Jamie from his stupor, and he leaned down slowly to look at what I was doing.Ye neednt find a key will turn it, he said, bracing a shoulder on the wall to keep upright.If one will fit to the length of the barrel, you can spring the lock wi a good bash on the head of it.Youve seen this kind of lock before?I wanted to keep him awake and talking; he was going to have to walk if we were to leave here.Ive been in one.When they brought me here, they chained me in a big cell with a lot of others.A lad named Reilly was chained next to me; a Leinstermansaid hed been in most of the jails in Ireland and decided to try Scotland for a change o scenery.Jamie was struggling to talk; he realized as well as I that he must rouse himself.He managed a feeble smile.He told me a good bit about locks and such, and showed me how we could break the ones we were wearing, if wed had a spare bit of straight metal, which we didnt.Tell me, then.The effort of talking was making him sweat freely, but he seemed more alert.Concentrating on the problem of the lock seemed to help.Following his directions, I found a suitable key and thrust it in as far as it would go.According to Reilly, a solid blow straight in on the end of the key would force the other end hard against the tumblers and spring them loose.I looked around for a suitable instrument for bashing.Use the mallet on the table, Sassenach, said Jamie.Caught by a grim note in his voice, I glanced from his face to the table, where a medium sized wooden mallet lay, the handle wrapped with tarred twine.Is that what I began, aghast.Aye.Brace the manacle against the wall, lass, before ye hit it.Grasping the handle gingerly, I picked up the mallet.It was awkward to get the iron manacle correctly positioned so that one side was braced by the wall, as this required that Jamie cross the manacled leg under the other and press his knee to the wall on the far side.My first two blows were too weak and timorous.Gathering determination about me like a cloak, I smashed the rounded end of the key as hard as I could.The mallet slipped off the key and caught Jamie a glancing but hard blow on the ankle.Recoiling, he lost his precarious balance and fell, instinctively reaching out his right hand to save himself.He let out an unearthly moan as his right arm crumpled beneath him and his shoulder hit the floor.Oh, damn, I said wearily.Jamie had fainted, not that I could blame him.Taking advantage of his momentary immobility, I turned his ankle so that the manacle was well braced, and banged doggedly on the embedded key, with little apparent effect.I was thinking grim thoughts about Irish locksmiths, when the door beside me swung suddenly open.Randalls face, like Franks, seldom showed what he was thinking, presenting instead a bland and impenetrable facade.At the moment, though, the Captains customary poise had deserted him, and he stood in the doorway with his jaw agape, looking not unlike the man who accompanied him.A very large man in a stained and ragged uniform, this assistant had the sloping brow, flat nose, and loose prominent lips characteristic of some types of mental retardation.His expression did not change as he peered over Randalls shoulder, showing no particular interest either in me or the unconscious man on the floor.Recovering, Randall walked into the room and reached down to prod the manacle around Jamies ankle.Been damaging the Crowns property, I see, my girl.Thats an offense punishable by law, you know.To say nothing of attempting to aid a dangerous prisoner in escaping.His pale grey eyes held a spark of amusement.Well have to arrange something suitable for you.In the meantime He jerked me to my feet and pulled my arms behind me, twisting his stock around my wrists.Struggle was plainly fruitless, but I stamped on his toes as hard as I could, purely to vent some of my own frustration.Ouch!He turned me and gave me a hard shove, so that my legs hit the bed and I fell, half lying on the rough blankets.Randall surveyed me with grim satisfaction, rubbing the scuffed toe of his boot with a linen handkerchief.I glared back at him, and he gave a short laugh.Youre no coward, Ill give you that.In fact, youre a fit match for him, he nodded at Jamie, who was beginning to stir a bit, and I cant give you a better compliment than that.He tenderly fingered his throat, where a darkening bruise showed in the open neck of his shirt.He tried to kill me, one handed, when I untied him.And damned near managed it too.Pity I didnt realize he was left handed.How unreasonable of him, I said.Quite, said Randall, with a nod.I dont suppose youd be so impolite, do you?Still, on the off chance He turned to the large servant, who was simply standing in the doorframe, shoulders sloped, waiting for orders.Marley, said Randall, come here and search this woman for weapons.He watched with some amusement as the man groped clumsily about my person, eventually coming upon and extracting my dirk.You dont care for Marley?asked the Captain, watching me try to avoid the thick fingers that prodded me all too intimately.Rather a pity; Im sure hes quite taken with you.Poor Marley hasnt much luck with women, the Captain went on, a malicious gleam in his eye.Have you, Marley?Even the whores wont have him.He fixed me with a designing sort of look, smiling wolfishly.Too big, they say.He raised one eyebrow.Which is quite a judgment, coming from a whore, is it not?He raised the other brow, making his meaning quite clear.Marley, who had begun to pant rather heavily during the search, stopped and wiped a thread of saliva from the side of his mouth.I moved as far away as I could manage, disgusted.Randall, watching me, said, I imagine Marley would like to entertain you privately in his quarters, once weve finished our conversation.Of course, he might decide later on to share his good fortune with his friends, but thats up to him.Oh, you dont want to watch?I asked sarcastically.Randall laughed, truly amused.I may have what are called unnatural tastes myself, as I imagine you know by this time.But give me credit for some aesthetic principles.He glanced at the immense orderly, slouched in his filthy clothes, paunch straining over his belt.The loose, blubbery lips chewed and mumbled constantly, as though seeking some fragment of food, and the short, thick fingers worked nervously against the crotch of the stained breeches.Randall shuddered delicately.No, he said.Youre a very lovely woman, shrewish tongue notwithstanding.To see you with Marleyno, I dont believe I want to watch that.Appearance aside, Marleys personal habits leave quite a lot to be desired.So do yours, I said.Thats as may be.At any rate, theyll not concern you much longer.He paused, looking down at me.I would still like to know who you are, you know.A Jacobite, plainly, but whose?Marischals?Seaforths?Lovats, most likely, since youre with the Frasers.Randall nudged Jamie gently with a polished boot toe, but he still lay inert.I could see his chest rising and falling regularly; perhaps he had merely slipped from unconsciousness into sleep.The smudges under his eyes gave evidence that he had had little rest of late.Ive even heard from some that youre a witch, the Captain went on.His tone was light, but he watched me closely, as though I might suddenly turn myself into an owl and flap away.There was some kind of trouble at Cranesmuir, wasnt there?A death of some kind?But no doubt thats all superstitious nonsense.Randall eyed me speculatively.I might be persuaded to make a bargain with you, he said abruptly.He leaned back, half sitting on the table, inviting me.I laughed bitterly.I cant say Im in either a position or a mood to bargain at the moment.What can you offer me?Randall glanced at Marley.The idiots eyes were fixed on me, and he was mumbling under his breath.A choice, at least.Tell meand convince mewho you are and who sent you to Scotland.What youre doing and what information youve sent to whom.Tell me that, and Ill take you to Sir Fletcher, instead of giving you to Marley.I kept my eyes firmly away from Marley.I had seen the rotting stumps of teeth embedded in pustulant gums, and the thought of him kissing me, let aloneI choked the thought off.Randall was right; I wasnt a coward.But neither was I a fool.You cant take me to Sir Fletcher, I said, and I know it as well as you do.Take me to him and risk my telling him about this?My nod took in the snug little room, the cozy fire, the bed I sat on, and Jamie lying at my feet.Whatever his own shortcomings, I dont imagine Sir Fletcher would stand, officially, for his officers torturing prisoners.Even the English army must have some standards.Randall raised both eyebrows.Torture?Oh, that.He waved negligently at Jamies hand.An accident.He fell in his cell and was trampled by the other prisoners.Its rather crowded in those cells, you know.He smiled derisively.I was silent.While Sir Fletcher might or might not believe the damage to Jamies hand was an accident, he was most unlikely to believe anything I said, once I was unmasked as an English spy.Randall was watching me, eyes alert for any signs of weakening.Well?The choice is yours.I sighed and closed my eyes, tired of looking at him.The choice wasnt mine, but I could hardly tell him why not.It doesnt matter, I said wearily.I cant tell you anything.Think it over for a moment.He stood up, and stepped carefully over Jamies unconscious form, taking a key from his pocket.I may need Marleys help for a bit, but then Ill send him back to his quartersand you with him, if you dont mean to cooperate.He stooped, unlocked the manacle, and heaved the inert body up with an impressive display of strength for one so slightly built.The muscles of his forearms ridged the cloth of his snowy shirt as he carried Jamie, head lolling, to a stool in the corner.He nodded at the bucket standing nearby.Rouse him, he directed the silent hulk curtly.Cold water splashed from the stones in the corner and puddled on the floor, making a filthy pool underneath.Once more, Randall said, inspecting Jamie, who was moaning slightly, head stirring against the stones of the wall.He flinched and coughed under the second drenching shower.Randall strode forward and took him by the hair, yanking his head back, shaking it like a drowned animal, so that drops of fetid water spattered the walls.Jamies eyes were dull slits.Randall threw Jamies head back in disgust, wiping his hand down the side of his trousers as he turned away.His eye must have caught the flicker of movement, because he began to turn back, but not in time to brace himself against the big Scots sudden lunge.Jamies arms went around Randalls neck.Lacking the use of his right hand, he gripped his right wrist with the able left and pulled, forearm braced on the Englishmans windpipe.As Randall turned purple and began to sag, he let go his left hand long enough to drive it into the captains kidney.Even weakened as Jamie was, the blow was enough to make Randall give at the knees.Dropping the limp captain, Jamie whirled to face the hulking orderly, who had been watching events so far without the slightest flicker of interest on his slack jawed face.Although his expression remained rather inert, he did move, picking up the mallet from the table as Jamie came toward him, holding the stool by one leg in his good left hand.A certain dull wariness came into the orderlys face as the two men circled each other slowly, looking for an opening.Better armed, Marley tried first, swinging the mallet at Jamies ribs.Jamie whirled away and feinted with the stool, forcing the orderly back toward the door.The next attempt, a murderous blow downward, would have split Jamies skull had it landed on target.As it was, the stool split instead, one leg and the seat sheared away.Impatiently, Jamie smashed the stool against the wall with his next swing, reducing it to a smaller but more manageable club; a two foot length of wood with a ragged, splintered end.The air in the cell, made stifling with smoke from the torches, was still except for the gasping breath of the two men and the occasional bruising thud of wood on flesh.Afraid to speak for fear of disturbing Jamies precarious concentration, I pulled my feet up onto the bed and shrank back against the wall, trying to stay out of the way.It was plain to meand by his faint smile of anticipation, to the orderly alsothat Jamie was tiring rapidly.Amazing enough that he was on his feet at all, let alone fighting.It was clear to all three of us that the fight couldnt last much longer; if he was to have any chance at all, he must move soon.With short, hard jabs of the stool leg, he advanced cautiously on Marley, forcing the bigger man into the corner where the arc of his swing would be restricted.Realizing this by some instinct, the orderly came out with a vicious horizontal swing, expecting to force Jamie back.Instead of stepping back, Jamie stepped forward into the swing, taking the full brunt of the blow in the left side as he brought his club down full force on Marleys temple.Intent on the scene before me, I had paid no attention to Randalls prone body on the floor near the door.But as the orderly tottered, eyes glazing, I heard the scraping sounds of boots on stone, and a labored breathing rasped in my ear.Nicely fought, Fraser.Randalls voice was hoarse from the choking, but as composed as ever.Cost you a few ribs, though, didnt it?Jamie leaned against the wall, breathing in sobbing gasps, still holding the club, elbow pressed hard to his side.His eyes dropped to the floor, measuring the distance.Dont try it, Fraser.The light voice was bland.Shell be dead before you get two steps.The thin cool knife blade slid past my ear; I could feel the point gently pricking the corner of my jaw.Jamie surveyed the scene with dispassionate eyes for a moment, still braced by the wall.With a sudden effort, he straightened painfully and stood swaying.The club clanked hollowly on the stone floor.The knifepoint pricked infinitesimally harder, but otherwise Randall stood motionless as Jamie slowly crossed the few feet to the table, stooping carefully on the way to pick up the twine wrapped mallet.He held it dangling in two fingers in front of him, his nonoffensive intent apparent.The mallet clattered on the table in front of me, the handle spinning hard enough to carry the weighty head nearly to the edge.It lay dark and heavy on the oak, a homely, solid tool.A reed basket of hapenny nails to go with it lay in the jumble of objects at the far end of the table; something perhaps left behind by the carpenters who had furnished the room.Jamies good hand, the fine straight fingers rimmed with gold in the light, gripped the table edge hard.With an effort I could only guess at, he lowered himself slowly into a chair and deliberately spread both hands flat before him on the scarred wood surface, the mallet within easy reach.His gaze had been locked with Randalls during the painful trip across the room, and did not waver now.He nodded briefly in my direction without looking at me and said, Let her go.The knife hand seemed to relax a trifle.Randalls voice was amused and curious.Why should I?Jamie seemed now in complete command of himself, despite his white face and the sweat that ran unregarded down his face like tears.You cannot hold a knife on two people at once.Kill the woman or leave her side, and Ill kill you.He spoke softly, a steely thread beneath the quiet Scots accent.And whats to stop me killing both of you, one at a time?I would have called the expression on Jamies face a smile only because his teeth were showing.What, and cheat the hangsman?Bit hard to explain, come morning, no?He nodded briefly at the unconscious hulk on the floor.Youll recall that ye had to have your wee helper bind me wi rope before ye broke my hand.So?The knife stayed steady at my ear.Your helper is no going to be much good to ye awhile yet.This was undeniably true; the monstrous orderly was lying on his face in the corner, breathing in ragged, stertorous snores.Severe concussion, I thought, mechanically.Possible cerebral hemorrhage.I couldnt care less if he died before my eyes.You cant take me alone, one handed or no.Jamie shook his head slowly, appraising Randalls size and strength.No.Im bigger, and far the better fighter, hand to hand.Did ye not have the woman there, I would take that wee knife from ye and cram it down your throat.And you know it, which is why youve not harmed her.But I do have her.You could leave yourself, of course.Theres a way out, quite near.That would leave your wifeyou did say shes your wife?to die, of course.Jamie shrugged.And myself as well.Id not get far, with the whole garrison hunting me.To be shot in the open might be preferable to being hanged in here, but not enough to make a difference.A brief grimace of pain crossed his face and he held his breath for a moment.When he breathed again, it was in shallow, panting gulps.Whatever shock had been protecting him from the worst of the pain, it was apparently wearing off.So we seem to be at an impasse.Randalls well bred English tones were casual.Unless you have a suggestion?I have.You want me.The cool Scottish voice was matter of fact.Let the woman go, and ye can have me.The knifepoint moved slightly, nicking my ear.I felt a sting and the warm ooze of blood.Do what ye wish to me.Ill not struggle, though Ill allow you to bind me if ye think it needful.And Ill not speak of it, come tomorrow.But first youll see the woman safe from the prison.My eyes were on Jamies ruined hand.A small pool of blood under the middle finger was growing, and I realized with a shock that he was deliberately pressing the finger into the table, using the pain as a spur to stay conscious.He was bargaining for my life using the only thing he had lefthimself.If he fainted now, that single chance was gone.Randall had relaxed completely; the knife lay carelessly on my right shoulder as he thought it through.I was there before him.Jamie was meant to hang in the morning.Sooner or later, he would be missed, and the Castle would be searched.While a certain amount of brutality might be tolerated among officers and gentlemenI was sure it would extend to a broken hand or a flayed backRandalls other inclinations were not so likely to be overlooked.No matter what Jamies status as a condemned prisoner, if he stood at the foot of the gallows come morning and claimed abuse at the hands of Randall, his claims would be investigated.And if physical examination proved them true, Randalls career was at an end, and possibly his life as well.But with Jamie sworn to silence.Youll give me your word?Jamies eyes were like blue matchflames in the parchment of his face.After a moment, he nodded slowly.In return for yours.The attraction of a victim at once completely unwilling and completely compliant was irresistible.Done.The knife left my shoulder and I heard the susurrus of sheathed metal.Randall walked slowly past me, around the table, picking up the mallet as he went.He held it up, ironically questioning.Youll allow me a brief test of your sincerity?Aye.Jamies voice was as steady as his hands, flat and motionless on the table.I tried to speak, to utter some protest, but my throat had dried to a sticky silence.Moving without haste, Randall leaned past Jamie to pluck a hapenny nail delicately from the reed basket.He positioned the point with care and brought the mallet down, driving the nail through Jamies right hand into the table with four solid blows.The broken fingers twitched and sprang straight, like the legs of a spider pinned to a collection board.Jamie groaned, his eyes wide and blank with shock.Randall set the mallet down with care.He took Jamies chin in his hand and turned his face up.Now kiss me, he said softly, and lowered his head to Jamies unresisting mouth.Randalls face when he rose was dreamy, eyes gentle and faraway, long mouth quirked in a smile.Once upon a time, I had loved a smile like that, and that dreamy look had roused me in anticipation.Now it sickened me.Tears ran into the corner of my mouth, though I didnt remember starting to cry.Randall stood a moment in his trance, gazing down at Jamie.Then he stirred, remembering, and drew the knife once more from its sheath.The blade slashed carelessly through the binding around my wrists, grazing the skin.I hardly had time to rub the circulation back into my hands before he was urging me up with a hand beneath my elbow, pushing me toward the door.Wait!Jamie spoke behind us, and Randall turned impatiently.Youll allow me to say goodbye?It was a statement more than a question, and Randall hesitated only briefly before nodding and giving me a shove back toward the motionless figure at the table.Jamies good arm was tight around my shoulders and my wet face was buried in his neck.You cant, I whispered.You cant.I wont let you.His mouth was warm against my ear.Claire, Im to hang in the morning.What happens to me between now and then doesna matter to anyone.I drew back and stared at him.It matters to me !The strained lips quivered in what was almost a smile, and he raised his free hand and laid it against my wet cheek.I know it does, mo duinne.And thats why youll go now.So Ill know there is someone still who minds for me.He drew me close again, kissed me gently and whispered in Gaelic, He will let you go because he thinks you are helpless.I know you are not.Releasing me, he said in English, I love you.Go now.Randall paused as he ushered me out the door.Ill be back very shortly.It was the voice of a man taking reluctant leave of his lover, and my stomach heaved.Silhouetted in red by the torch behind him, Jamie inclined his head gracefully toward the pinioned hand.I expect youll find me here.* * *    Black Jack.A common name for rogues and scoundrels in the eighteenth century.A staple of romantic fiction, the name conjured up charming highwaymen, dashing blades in plumed hats.The reality walked at my side.One never stops to think what underlies romance.Tragedy and terror, transmuted by time.Add a little art in the telling, and voil?!a stirring romance, to make the blood run fast and maidens sigh.My blood was running fast, all right, and never maiden sighed like Jamie, cradling his mangled hand.This way.It was the first time Randall had spoken since we had left the cell.He indicated a narrow alcove in the wall, unlighted by torches.The way out, of which he had spoken to Jamie.By now I had sufficient command of myself to speak, and I did so.I stepped back a pace, so that the torchlight fell full on me, for I wanted him to remember my face.You asked me, Captain, if I were a witch, I said, my voice low and steady.Ill answer you now.Witch I am.Witch, and I curse you.You will marry, Captain, and your wife will bear a child, but you shall not live to see your firstborn.I curse you with knowledge, Jack RandallI give you the hour of your death.His face was in shadow, but the gleam of his eyes told me he believed me.And why should he not?For I spoke the truth, and I knew it.I could see the lines of Franks genealogical chart as though they were drawn on the mortar lines between the stones of the wall, and the names listed by them.Jonathan Wolverton Randall, I said softly, reading it from the stones.Born, September the 3rd, 1705.Died He made a convulsive movement toward me, but not fast enough to prevent me from speaking.A narrow door at the back of the alcove crashed open with a squeal of hinges.Expecting further darkness, my eyes were dazzled by a blinding flash of light on snow.A quick shove from behind sent me staggering headlong into the drifts, and the door slammed to behind me.I was lying in a ditch of sorts, behind the prison.The drifts around me covered heaps of somethingthe prisons refuse, most likely.There was something hard beneath the drift I had fallen into; wood, perhaps.Looking up at the sheering wall above me, I could see streaks and runnels down the stone, marking the path of garbage tipped from a sliding door forty feet above.That must be the kitchen quarters.I rolled over, bracing myself to rise, and found myself looking into a pair of wide blue eyes.The face was nearly as blue as the eyes, and hard as the log of wood I had mistaken him for.I stumbled to my feet, choking, and staggered back against the prison wall.Head down, breathe deep, I told myself firmly.You are not going to faint, you have seen dead men before, lots of them, you are not going to faintGod, he has blue eyes likeyou are not going to faint, damn it!My breathing slowed at last, and with it my racing pulse.As the panic receded, I forced myself back to that pathetic figure, wiping my hands convulsively on my skirt.I dont know whether it was pity, curiosity, or simple shock that made me look again.Seen without the suddenness of surprise, there was nothing frightening about the dead man; there never is.No matter how ugly the manner in which a man dies, its only the presence of a suffering human soul that is horrifying; once gone, what is left is only an object.The blue eyed stranger had been hanged.He was not the only inhabitant of the ditch.I didnt bother to excavate the drift, but now that I knew what it contained, I could plainly see the outline of frozen limbs and the softly rounded heads under the snow.At least a dozen men lay here, waiting either for a thaw that would make their burial easier, or for a cruder disposal by the beasts of the nearby forest.The thought startled me out of my pensive immobility.I had no time to waste in graveside meditation, or one more pair of blue eyes would stare sightless up into falling snow.I had to find Murtagh and Rupert.That hidden postern door could be used, perhaps.Clearly it was not fortified or guarded like the main gates and other entrances to the prison.But I needed help, and I needed it quickly.I glanced up at the rim of the ditch.The sun was quite low, burning through a haze of cloud just above the treetops.The air felt heavy with moisture.Likely it would snow again by nightfall; the haze was thick across the sky in the east.There was perhaps an hour of light left.I began to follow the ditch, not wanting to climb the steep rocky sides until I had to.The ravine curved away from the prison quite soon, and looked as though it would lead down toward the river; presumably the runoff of melting snow carried the prisons refuse away.I was nearly to the corner of the soaring wall when I heard a faint sound behind me.I whirled.The sound had been made by a rock falling from the lip of the ditch, dislodged by the foot of a large grey wolf.As an alternative to the items under the snow, I had certain desirable characteristics, from a wolfs point of view.On the one hand, I was mobile, harder to catch, and posed the possibility of resistance.On the other, I was slow, clumsy, and above all, not frozen stiff, thus offering no danger of broken teeth.I also smelled of fresh blood, temptingly warm in this frozen waste.Were I a wolf, I thought, I wouldnt hesitate.The animal made up its mind at the same time I came to my own decision regarding our future relations.There had been a Yank at Pembroke Hospital, name of Charlie Marshall.He was a pleasant chap, friendly as all the Yanks were, and most entertaining on his pet subject.His pet subject was dogs; Charlie was a sergeant in the K 9 Corps.He had been blown up, along with two of his dogs, by an antipersonnel mine outside a small village near Arles.He grieved for his dogs, and often told me stories about them when I would sit with him during the odd slack moments in my shift.More to the immediate point, he had also once told me what to do, and not do, should I ever be attacked by a dog.I felt it was stretching a point to call the eerie creature picking its delicate way down the rocks a dog, but hoped that it might yet share a few basic character traits with its tame descendants.Bad dog, I said firmly, staring it in one yellow eyeball.In fact, I said, backing very slowly toward the prison wall, you are a perfectly horrible dog.(Speak firmly and loudly, I heard Charlie saying. )Probably the worst Ive ever seen, I said, firmly and loudly.I continued to back up, one hand feeling behind me for the stones of the wall, and once there, I sidled toward the corner, some ten yards away.I pulled the ties at my throat and began to fumble at the brooch fastening my cloak, still telling the wolf firmly and loudly what I thought of him, his ancestors, and his immediate family.The beast seemed interested in the diatribe, tongue lolling in a doggy grin.He was in no hurry; he limped slightly, I could see, as he drew nearer, and was thin and mangy.Perhaps he had trouble hunting, and infirmity was what drew him to the prison midden to scavenge.I certainly hoped so; the more infirm, the better.I found my leather gloves in the pocket of my cloak and put them on.Then I wrapped the heavy cloak several times around my right forearm, blessing the weight of the velvet.Theyll go for the throat, Charlie had instructed me, unless their trainer tells them otherwise.Keep looking him in the eye; youll see it when he makes up his mind to jump.Thats your moment.I could see a number of things in that wicked yellow orb, including hunger, curiosity, and speculation, but not yet a decision to leap.You disgusting creature, I told it, dont you dare leap at my throat!I had other ideas.I had wrapped the cloak in several loose folds about my right arm, leaving the bulk of it dangling, but providing enough padding, I hoped, to keep the beasts teeth from sinking through.The wolf was thin, but not emaciated.I judged it to weigh perhaps eighty or ninety pounds; less than me, but not enough to give me any great advantage.The leverage was definitely in the animals favor; four legs against two gave better balance on the slippery crust of snow.I hoped bracing my back against the wall would help.A certain feeling of emptiness at my back told me I had reached the corner.The wolf was some twenty feet away.This was it.I scraped enough snow from under my feet to give good footing and waited.I didnt even see the wolf leave the ground.I could swear I had been watching its eyes, but if the decision to leap had registered there, it had been followed by action too swiftly to note.It was instinct, not thought, that raised my arm as a whitish grey blur hurtled toward me.The teeth sank into the padding with a force that bruised my arm.It was heavier than I thought; I was unprepared for the weight, and my arm sagged.I had planned to try to throw the beast against the wall, perhaps stunning it.Instead, I heaved myself at the wall, squashing the wolf between the stone blocks and my hip.I struggled to wrap the loose cloak around it.Claws shredded my skirt and scraped my thigh.I drove a knee viciously into its chest, eliciting a strangled yelp.Only then did I realize that the odd, growling whimpers were coming from me and not the wolf.Strangely enough, I was not at all frightened now, though I had been terrified watching the wolf stalk me.There was room in my mind for only one thought: I would kill this animal, or it would kill me.Therefore, I was going to kill it.There comes a turning point in intense physical struggle where one abandons oneself to a profligate usage of strength and bodily resource, ignoring the costs until the struggle is over.Women find this point in childbirth; men in battle.Past that certain point, you lose all fear of pain or injury.Life becomes very simple at that point; you will do what you are trying to do, or die in the attempt, and it does not really matter much which.I had seen this sort of struggle during my training on the wards, but never had I experienced it before.Now all my concentration was focused on the jaws locked around my forearm and the writhing demon tearing at my body.I managed to bang the beasts head against the wall, but not hard enough to do much good.I was growing tired rapidly; had the wolf been in good condition, I would have had no chance.I hadnt much now, but took what there was.I fell on the animal, pinning it under me and knocking the wind from it in a gust of carrion breath.It recovered almost immediately and began squirming beneath me, but the seconds relaxation enabled me to get it off my arm, one hand clamped under its wet muzzle.By forcing my fingers back into the corners of its mouth, I managed to keep them out from between the scissoring carnassial teeth.Saliva drizzled down my arm.I was lying flat on top of the wolf.The corner of the prison wall was perhaps eighteen inches ahead of me.Somehow I must get there, without releasing the fury that heaved and squirmed under me.Scrabbling with my feet, pressing down with all my might, I pushed myself forward inch by inch, constantly straining to keep the fangs from my throat.It cannot have taken more than a few minutes to move those eighteen inches, but it seemed I had lain there most of my life, locked in battle with this beast whose hind claws raked my legs, seeking a good ripping purchase in my belly.At last I could see around the corner.The blunt angle of stone was directly in front of my face.Now was the tricky part.I must maneuver the wolfs body to allow me to get both hands under the muzzle; I would never be able to exert the necessary force with one.I rolled abruptly away, and the wolf slithered at once into the small clear space between my body and the wall.Before it could rise to its feet, I brought my knee up as hard as I could.The wolf grunted as my knee drove into its side, pinning it, however fleetingly, against the wall.I had both hands beneath its jaw now.The fingers of one hand were actually in its mouth.I could feel a crushing sting across my gloved knuckles, but ignored it as I forced the hairy head back, and back, and back again, using the angle of the wall as a fulcrum for the lever of the beasts body.I thought my arms would break, but this was the only chance.There was no audible noise, but I felt the reverberation through the whole body as the neck snapped.The straining limbsand the bladderat once relaxed.The intolerable strain on my arms now released, I dropped, as limp as the dying wolf.I could feel the beasts heart fibrillating beneath my cheek, the only part still capable of a death struggle.The stringy fur stank of ammonia and soggy hair.I wanted to move away, but could not.I think I must have slept for a moment, odd as that sounds, cheek pillowed on the corpse.I opened my eyes to see the greenish stone of the prison a few inches in front of my nose.Only the thought of what was transpiring on the other side of that wall got me to my feet.I stumbled down the ditch, cloak dragged over one shoulder, tripping on stones hidden in the snow, banging my shins painfully on half buried tree branches.Subconsciously, I must have been aware that wolves usually run in packs, because I do not recall being surprised by the howl that wavered out of the forest above and behind me.If I felt anything, it was black rage at what seemed a conspiracy to thwart and delay me.Wearily I turned to see where the sound had come from.I was in the open away from the prison by this time; no wall to brace my back against, and no weapon to hand.It had been luck as much as anything that helped me with the first wolf; there was not a chance in a thousand that I could kill another animal bare handedand how many more might there be?The pack I had seen feeding in the moonlight in the summer had had at least ten wolves.I could hear in memory the sounds of their teeth scraping, and the crack of breaking bones.The only question now was whether I bothered to fight at all, or whether I would rather just lie down in the snow and give up.That option seemed remarkably attractive, all things considered.Still, Jamie had given up his life, and considerably more than that, to get me out of the prison.I owed it to him at least to try.Once more I backed slowly away, moving farther down the ditch.The light was fading; soon the ravine would be filled with shadow.I doubted that that would help me.The wolves undoubtedly had better night sight than I did.The first of the hunters appeared on the rim of the ditch as the other had; a shaggy figure, standing motionless and alert.It was with something of a shock that I realized two more were already in the ravine with me, trotting slowly, almost in step with each other.They were almost the same color as the snow in the twilightdirty greyand almost invisible, though they moved with no attempt at concealment.I stopped moving.Flight was clearly useless.Bending, I freed a dead pine branch from the snow.The bark was black with the wet, and rough even through my gloves.I waved the branch around my head and shouted.The animals stopped moving toward me, but did not retreat.The closest one flattened its ears, as though objecting to the noise.Dont like it?I screeched.Too bloody bad!Back off, you fucking sod!Scooping up a half buried rock, I hurled it at the wolf.It missed, but the beast scooted to one side.Encouraged, I began to fling missiles wildly; rocks, twigs, handfuls of snow, anything I could grab one handed.I shrieked until my throat was raw with cold air, howling like the wolves themselves.At first I thought one of my missiles had scored a hit.The nearest wolf yelped and seemed to convulse.The second arrow passed within a foot of me and I caught the tiny blur of motion before it thudded home in the chest of the second wolf.That animal died where it stood.The first, struck less vitally, kicked and struggled in the snow, no more than a heaving lump in the growing dusk.I stood stupidly staring at it for some time, then looked up by instinct to the lip of the ravine.The third wolf, wisely choosing discretion, had vanished back into the trees, from whence a shivering howl went up.I was still looking up at the dark trees when a hand clutched my elbow.I whirled with a gasp to find myself looking up into the face of a stranger.Narrow jawed and with a weak chin ill disguised by a scabby beard, he was a stranger indeed, but his plaid and his dirk marked him a Scot.Help, I said, and fell forward into his arms.36    MACRANNOCH    It was dark in the cottage and there was a bear in the corner of the room.In panic, I recoiled against my escort, wanting nothing more to do with wild beasts.He shoved me strongly forward, into the cottage.As I staggered toward the fire, the hulking shape turned toward me, and I realized belatedly that it was merely a large man in a bearskin.A bearskin cloak, to be exact, fastened at the neck with a silver gilt brooch as large as the palm of my hand.It was made in the shape of two leaping stags, backs arched and heads meeting to form a circle.The locking pin was a short, tapered fan, the head of it shaped like the tail of a fleeing deer.I noticed the brooch in detail because it was directly in front of my nose.Looking up, I briefly considered the possibility that I had been wrong; perhaps it really was a bear.Still, bears presumably did not wear brooches or have eyes like blueberries; small, round, and a dark, shiny blue.They were sunk in heavy cheeks whose lower slopes were forested with silver shot black hair.Similar hair cascaded over thickset shoulders to mingle with the hair of the cloak, which, in spite of its new use, was still pungently redolent of its former owner.The shrewd little eyes flickered over me, evaluating both the bedraggled state of my attire, and the good basic quality of it, including the two wedding rings, gold and silver.The bears address was formulated accordingly.You seem to have had some difficulty, Mistress, he said formally, inclining a massive head still spangled with melting snow.Perhaps we might assist ye?I hesitated over what to say.I desperately needed this mans help, yet I would be suspect immediately my speech revealed me to be English.The archer who had brought me here forestalled me.Found her near Wentworth, he said laconically.Fightin wolves.An English lassie, he added, with an emphasis that made my hosts blueberry eyes fix on me with a rather unpleasant speculation in their depths.I pulled myself up to my full height and summoned as much of the Matron attitude as I could.English by birth, Scots by marriage, I said firmly.My name is Claire Fraser.My husband is a prisoner in Wentworth.I see, said the bear, slowly.Weel, my own name is MacRannoch, and yere presently on my land.I can see by your dress as youre a woman of some family; how come ye to be alone in Eldridge Wood on a winter night?I caught at the opening; here was some chance to establish my bona fides, as well as to find Murtagh and Rupert.I came to Wentworth with some clansmen of my husbands.As I was English, we thought I could gain entrance to the prison, and perhaps find some way of, er, removing him.However, II left the prison by another way.I was looking for my friends when I was set upon by wolvesfrom which this gentleman kindly rescued me.I tried a grateful smile on the raw boned archer, who received it in stony silence.Yeve certainly met something wi teeth, MacRannoch agreed, eyeing the gaping rents in my skirt.Suspicion yielded temporarily to the demands of hospitality.Are ye hurt, then?Just a bit scratched?Weel, youre cold, nae doubt, and a wee bit shaken, I imagine.Sit here by the fire.Hector will fetch ye a sup of something, and then ye can tell me a bit more about these friends of yours.He pulled a rough three legged stool up with one foot, and sat me firmly on it with a massive hand on my shoulder.Peat fires give little light but are comfortingly hot.I shuddered involuntarily as the blood started to flow back into my frozen hands.A couple of gulps from the leather flask grudgingly provided by Hector started the blood flowing internally again as well.I explained my situation as well as I could, which was not particularly well.My brief description of my exit from the prison and subsequent hand to hand encounter with the wolf was received with particular skepticism.Given that ye did manage to get into Wentworth, it doesna seem likely that Sir Fletcher would allow ye to wander about the place.Nor if this Captain Randall had found ye in the dungeons, he would merely ha shown ye the back door.Hehe had reasons for letting me go.Which were?The blueberry eyes were implacable.I gave up and put the matter baldly; I was much too tired for delicacy or circumlocutions.MacRannoch appeared semiconvinced, but still reluctant to take any action.Aye, I see your concern, he argued, still, that may not be so bad.Not so bad!I sprang to my feet in outrage.He shook his head as though plagued by deerflies.What I mean, he explained, is that if its the lads arse hes after, hes none so likely to hurt him badly.And, savin your presence, maamhe cocked a bushy eyebrow in my directionbein buggered has seldom killed anyone.He held up placating hands the size of soup plates.Now, Im no sayin hell enjoy it, mind, but I do say its not worth a major set to with Sir Fletcher Gordon, just to save the lad a sore arse.Ive a precarious position here, ye know, verra precarious.And he puffed out his cheeks and beetled his brows at me.Not for the first time, I regretted the fact that there were no real witches.Had I been one, I would have turned him into a toad on the spot.A big fat one, with warts.I choked down my rage and tried reason yet again.I rather think his arse is beyond saving by this time; its his neck Im concerned with.The English mean to hang him in the morning.MacRannoch was muttering to himself, twisting back and forth like a bear in a too small cage.He stopped abruptly in front of me and thrust his nose to within an inch of my own.I would have recoiled, had I not been so exhausted.As it was, I merely blinked.And if I said Id help ye, what good would that do?he roared.He resumed his turning and pacing, two steps to one wall, hurling around in a fling of fur, and two steps to the other.He spoke as he paced, words keeping time to the steps, pausing to puff as he turned.If I were to go to Sir Fletcher myself, what would I say?Yeve a captain on your staff whos engaged in torturin the prisoners in his spare time?And when he asks how I know that, I tell him a stray Sassenach wench my men found wanderin in the dark told me this mans been makin indecent advances to her husband, whos an outlaw wi a price on his head, and a condemned murderer, to boot?MacRannoch stopped and thumped one paw on the flimsy table.And as for takin men into the place!If, and mind ye, I say if we could get in  You could get in, I interrupted.I can show you the way.Mmmphm.Thats as may be.If we could get in, what happens when Sir Fletcher finds my men wanderin about his fortress?He sends Captain Randall round next mornin with a brace of cannon and levels Eldridge Hall to the ground, thats what!He shook his head again, making the black locks fly.Nay, lass, I canna see  He was interrupted by the sudden flinging open of the cottage door to admit another bowman, this one pushing Murtagh in front of him at knife point.MacRannoch stopped and stared in amazement.What is this?he demanded.Yed think twas May Day, and the lads and lassies all out gatherin flowers in the wood, not the dead o winter and snow comin on!This is my husbands clansman, I said.As I told you  Murtagh, undisturbed by the less than cordial greeting, was eyeing the bear clad figure closely, as though mentally stripping hair and years away.MacRannoch, is it no?he said, in a tone almost accusing.Yell have been at a Gathering, I think, some time ago at Castle Leoch?MacRannoch was more than startled.Some time ago, I should say!Why, that must ha been near on thirty year ago.How dye know that, man?Murtagh nodded, satisfied.Och, I thought so.I was there.And I remember that Gathering, likely for the same reason ye do yourself.MacRannoch was studying the wizened little man, trying to subtract thirty years from the seamed countenance.Aye, I know ye, he said at last.Or not the name, but you.Ye killed a wounded boar single handed with a dagger, during the tynchal.A gallant beast too.Thats right, the MacKenzie gave ye the tushesa bonny set, almost a complete double curve.Lovely work that, man.A look perilously close to gratification creased Murtaghs pitted cheek momentarily.I started, remembering the magnificent, barbaric bracelets I had seen at Lallybroch.My mothers, Jenny had said, given to her by an admirer.I stared at Murtagh in disbelief.Even allowing for the passage of thirty years, he did not seem a likely candidate for the tender passion.Thinking of Ellen MacKenzie, I remembered her pearls, which I was still carrying, sewn into the seam of my pocket.I groped for the free end, pulling them out into the firelight.I can pay you, I said.I wouldnt expect your men to risk themselves for nothing.Moving a good deal faster than I would have thought possible, he snatched the pearls from my hand.He stared at them disbelievingly.Where did ye get these, woman?he demanded.Fraser, did ye say your name is?Yes.Tired as I was, I drew myself up straight.And the pearls are mine.My husband gave them to me on our wedding day.Did he, then?The hoarse voice was suddenly hushed.He turned to Murtagh, still holding the pearls.Ellens son?Is this lasss husband Ellens son?Aye, Murtagh said, unemphatic as ever.As yed ken at once if ye saw him; hes the spit of her.Mindful at last of the pearls he was clutching, MacRannoch unfolded his hand and gently stroked the shining gems.I gave these to Ellen MacKenzie, he said.For a wedding gift.I would ha given them to her as my wife, but as shed chosen elsewherewell, Id thought of them so often, around her bonny throat, I told her I couldna see them elsewhere.So I bade her keep them, and only think of me when she wore them.Hm!He snorted briefly at some memory, then handed the pearls carefully back to me.So theyre yours now.Well, wear them in good health, lassie.Ill stand a much better chance of doing so, I said, trying to control my impatience at these sentimental displays, if youll help me to get my husband back.The small rosy mouth, which had been smiling slightly at its owners thought, tightened suddenly.Ah, said Sir Marcus, pulling at his beard.I see.But Ive told ye, lassie, I canna see how it can be done.Ive a wife and three weans at home.Aye, Id do a bit for Ellens lad.But its a bit much yere askin.Suddenly my legs gave way altogether, and I sat down with a thump, letting my shoulders sag and my head droop.Despair dragged at me like an anchor, pulling me down.I closed my eyes and retreated to some dim place within, where there was nothing but an aching grey blankness, and where the sound of Murtaghs voice, still arguing, was no more than a faint yapping.It was the bawling of cattle that roused me from my stupor.I looked up to see MacRannoch swirl out of the cottage.As he opened the door, a blast of winter air came in, thick with the lowing of cattle and yelling of men.The door thumped shut behind the vast hairy figure, and I turned to ask Murtagh what he thought we should do next.The look on his face stopped me, wordless.I had seldom seen him with anything more than a sort of patient dourness showing on his features, but now he positively glowed with suppressed excitement.I caught at his arm.What is it?Tell me quickly!He had time only to say, The kine!Theyre MacRannochs!before MacRannoch himself plunged back into the cottage, pushing a lanky young man before him.With a last shove, he brought the young man flat up against the plastered wall of the cottage.Apparently MacRannoch found confrontation effective; he tried the same nose to nose technique he had used on me earlier.Less poised, or less tired, than I, the young man hunched nervously back against the wall as far as he could go.MacRannoch started out being sweetly reasonable.Absalom, man, I sent ye out three hours ago to bring in forty head of cattle.I told ye it was important to find them, because theres about to be a damn awfu snowstorm.The nicely modulated voice was rising.And when I heard the sound of kine bellowin outside, I said to meself, Ah, Marcus, theres Absalom gone and found all the cattle, what a good lad, now we can all go home and thaw ourselves by the fire, with the kine safe in their barns.One ham fist had fastened itself onto Absaloms jacket.The material, gathered between those stubby fingers, began to twist.And then I go out to congratulate you on a good job done, and begin to count the beasts.And how many do I count, Absalom, me bonny wee lad?The voice had risen to a full powered roar.While not possessed of a particularly deep voice, Marcus MacRannoch had enough lung power for three ordinary sized men.Fifteen!he shouted, jerking the unfortunate Absalom to his tiptoes.Fifteen beasts he finds, out of forty!And where are the rest o them?Where?Out loose in the snow, to freeze to death!Murtagh had faded quietly back into the shadows in the corner while all this was going on.I was watching his face, though, and saw the sudden gleam of amusement in his eyes at these words.Suddenly I realized what he had started to tell me, and I knew where Rupert was now.Or, if not precisely where he was, at least what he was doing.And I began to hope a little.* * *    It was full dark.The prisons lights below shone weakly through the snow like the lamps of a drowned ship.Waiting under the trees with my two companions, I mentally reviewed for the thousandth time everything that could go wrong.Would MacRannoch carry out his part of the bargain?Hed have to, if he expected to get his prized purebred Highland cattle back.Would Sir Fletcher believe MacRannoch and order a search of the basement dungeons at once?Likelythe baronet wasnt a man to be taken lightly.I had seen the cattle disappear, one shaggy beast at a time, down the ditch that led to the hidden postern door, under the expert driving of Rupert and his men.But would they be able to force the cattle through that door, singly or not?And if so, what would they do once inside; half wild cattle, trapped suddenly in a stone corridor lit with glaring torchlight?Well, perhaps it would work.The corridor itself would be not unlike their stone floored barn, including torches and the scent of humans.If they got so far, the plan might succeed.Randall himself was unlikely to call for help in the face of the invasion, for fear of having his own little games uncovered.The handlers were to get away from the prison as fast as possible, once the beasts were well and truly launched on their chaotic path, and then to ride hell for leather for the MacKenzie lands.Randall didnt matter; what could he do alone, in the circumstances?But what if the noise attracted the rest of the prison garrison too soon?If Dougal had been reluctant to try to break his nephew out of Wentworth, I could imagine his choler if several MacKenzies were arrested for breaking into the place.I didnt want to be responsible for that, either, though Rupert had been more than willing to take the risk.I bit my thumb and tried to comfort myself, thinking of the tons of solid, sound muffling granite that separated the dungeons from the prison quarters above.Most worrying of all, of course, was the fear that everything might work, and might be still too late.Waiting hangsman or no, Randall might go too far.I knew too well, from stories told by returning soldiers from POW camps, that nothing is easier than for a prisoner to die by accident, and the body be conveniently disposed of before embarrassing official questions can be asked.Even if questions were asked, and Randall found out, it would be small comfort to meand to Jamie.I had been resolutely keeping myself from imagining the possible uses of the homely objects on the table of that room.But I could not keep from seeing over and over the bone ends of that shattered finger pressing into the table.I rubbed my own knuckles hard against the saddle leather, trying to erase the image.I felt a slight burning, and pulled off the glove to examine the grazes left across my hand by the wolfs teeth.Not bad, no more than a few scratches, with one small puncture where a cusp had penetrated the leather.I licked the wound absently.It was little use telling myself that I had done my best.I had done the only possible thing, but knowing it didnt make the waiting easier.At last, we heard a faint, confused shouting from the direction of the prison.One of the MacRannoch men put a hand on the bridle of my horse and motioned toward the shelter of the trees.The snow was much lighter on the ground and the flurries diminished under the interlaced branches of the grove, thin lines of snow stark and sudden on the rocky leaf strewn ground.While the snow fell less thickly in here, visibility was still so poor that tree trunks a few feet away loomed surprisingly as I walked my horse restlessly around the small clearing, trunks springing up black in the pinkish light.Muffled by the heavy snow, the approaching hoofbeats were almost upon us before we heard them.The two MacRannoch men drew their pistols and reined their horses up close to the trees, waiting, but I had picked up the dull lowing of cattle, and spurred my horse forward out of the grove.Sir Marcus MacRannoch, distinguishable by his piebald mount and his bearskin cloak, was leading the way up the slope, snow spurting in small explosions from under the hooves of his horse.He was followed by several men, all in high good humor, from the sound of it.More of his men rode further back, chivvying the milling herd of cattle from behind, driving the band of bewildered beasts around the base of the hill, toward their well earned shelter in the MacRannoch barns.MacRannoch reined up beside me, laughing heartily.Ive to thank ye, Mistress Fraser, he shouted through the snow, for a most entertaining evening.His earlier suspicion had vanished, and he greeted me with the utmost geniality.His eyebrows and mustache coated with snow, he looked like Father Christmas on a spree.Taking my bridle, he led my horse back into the quieter air of the grove.He waved my two companions down the hill to help with the cattle, then dismounted and swung me down from my saddle, still laughing to himself.Ye should ha seen it!he chortled, hugging himself in ecstasy.Sir Fletcher went red as a robins breast when I pushed in in the midst of his dinner, shouting that he was concealing stolen property on his premises.And then when we got below stairs and he heard the beasts bellowin like thunder, I thought hed dirtied his breeches.He I shook his arm impatiently.Never mind Sir Fletchers breeches.Did you find my husband?MacRannoch sobered a bit, wiping his eyes with his sleeve.Oh, aye.We found him.Is he all right?I spoke calmly, though I wanted to scream.MacRannoch nodded toward the trees behind me, and I whirled to see a rider making his way carefully through the branches, a bulky cloth covered shape draped across the saddlebow in front of him.I dashed forward, followed by MacRannoch, explaining helpfully.Hes no deid, or at least he wasnt when we found him.Been mistreated a good bit, though, poor laddie.I had pushed aside the cloth over Jamies head, and was anxiously examining him as best I could, with the horse fidgeting from the excitement of the cold ride and the extra burden.I could see dark bruises and feel stiff patches of blood in the rumpled hair, but could tell little more in the dim light.I thought I could feel a pulse in the icy neck, but wasnt sure.MacRannoch caught my elbow and pulled me away.Well do best to get him inside quick, lass.Come with me.Hector will bring him along to the house.In the main drawing room of Eldridge Manor, MacRannochs home, Hector humped his burden onto the rug before the fire.Seizing one corner of the blanket, he unrolled it carefully, and a limp, naked figure flopped out onto the pink and yellow flowers of Lady Annabelle MacRannochs pride and joy.To do the Lady Annabelle credit, she didnt seem to notice the blood soaking into her expensive Aubusson rug.A birdlike woman in her early forties, arrayed like a goldfinch in a sunburst of yellow silk dressing gown, she had servants bustling in all directions with a brisk clap of her hands, and blankets, linen, hot water, and whisky appeared at my elbow almost before I had got my cloak off.Best turn him on his belly, advised Sir Marcus, pouring out two large whiskies.Hes had his back flayed, and it must feel fierce to lie on it.Not that he looks like he feels anything, much, he added, peering closely at Jamies ashen face and sealed, bluish eyelids.Youre sure hes still alive?Yes, I answered shortly, hoping I was right.I struggled to pull Jamie over.Unconsciousness seemed to have tripled his weight.MacRannoch lent a hand, and we got him positioned on a blanket, back to the fire.A rapid triage having established that he was in fact alive, missing no body parts, and not in immediate danger of bleeding to death, I could afford to make a less hurried inventory of the damage.I can send for a physician, said Lady Annabelle, looking dubiously at the corpselike figure on her hearth, but I doubt he can get here under an hour; its snowing something fierce out.The reluctance in her tone was only partly on account of the snow, I thought.A physician would make one more dangerous witness to the presence of an escaped criminal in her home.Dont bother, I said absently, I am a physician.Disregarding the looks of surprise from both MacRannochs, I knelt beside what was left of my husband, covered him with blankets and began to apply cloths soaked in hot water to the outlying parts.My chief concern was to get him warm; the blood from his back was a slow ooze, which could be dealt with later.Lady Annabelle faded into the distance, her high goldfinchs voice summoning, beckoning, and arranging.Her spouse sank down on his haunches beside me, and began to rub Jamies frozen feet in a businesslike way between large blunt fingered hands, pausing occasionally to sip his whisky.Turning back the blankets in bits, I surveyed the damage.He had been finely striped from nape to knees with something like a coachwhip, the weals crisscrossing neatly like hemstitching.The sheer orderliness of the damage, speaking as it did of a deliberation that reveled in each punishing stroke, made me feel sick with rage.Something heavier, perhaps a cane, had been used with less restraint across his shoulders, cutting so deeply in spots that a gleam of bone showed over one shoulderblade.I pressed a thick pad of lint gently over the worst of the mess and went on with the examination.The spot on his left side where the mallet had struck was an ugly contused swelling, a black and purple patch bigger than Sir Marcuss hand.Broken ribs there for sure, but those too could wait.My attention was caught by the livid patches on neck and breast, where the skin was puckered, reddened and blistered.The edges of one such patch were charred, rimmed with white ash.What in hell did that?Sir Marcus had completed his ministrations and was looking over my shoulder with deep interest.A hot poker.The voice was weak and indistinct; it was a moment before I realized that it was Jamie who had spoken.He raised his head with an effort, showing the reason for his difficult speech; the lower lip was badly bitten on one side and puffed like a beesting.With considerable presence of mind, Sir Marcus put a hand behind Jamies neck and pressed the beaker of whisky to his lips.Jamie winced as the spirit stung his torn mouth, but drained the beaker before laying his head down again.His eyes slanted up at me, slightly filmed with pain and whisky, but alight with amusement nonetheless.Cows?he asked, Was it really cows, or was I dreaming?Well, it was all I could manage in the time, I said, beaming in my relief at seeing him alive and conscious.I placed a hand on his head, turning it to inspect a large bruise over the cheekbone.You look bloody awful.How do you feel?I asked, from force of long held habit.Alive.He struggled up onto one elbow to accept with a nod a second beaker of whisky from Sir Marcus.Do you think you should drink so much all at once?I asked, trying to examine his pupils for signs of concussion.He foiled me by closing his eyes and tilting his head back.Yes, he said, handing back the empty beaker to Sir Marcus, who bore it back in the direction of the decanter.Now, thatll be enough for the present, Marcus.Lady Annabelle, reappearing like the sun in the east, stopped her husband with a commanding chirp.The lad needs hot strong tea, not more whisky.The tea followed her processionally in a silver pot, borne by a maidservant whose air of natural superiority was unimpaired by the fact that she was still attired in her nightdress.Hot strong tea with plenty of sugar in it, I amended.And perhaps a wee tot of whisky as well, said Sir Marcus, neatly removing the lid of the teapot as it passed and adding a generous dollop from his decanter.Accepting the steaming cup gratefully, Jamie raised it in mute tribute to Sir Marcus before cautiously bringing the hot liquid to his mouth.His hand shook badly, and I wrapped my own around his fingers to guide the cup.More servants were bringing in a portable camp bed, a mattress, more blankets, more bandages and hot water, and a large wooden chest containing the households medical supplies.I thought we had best work here before the fire, Lady Annabelle explained in her charming bird voice.Theres more light, and its far the warmest place in the house.At her direction, two of the larger menservants each seized an end of the blanket under Jamie and transferred it smoothly, contents and all, to the camp bed, now set up before the fire, where another servant was industriously poking the night banked coals and feeding the growing blaze.The maid who had brought in the tea was efficiently lighting the wax tapers in the branched candelabra on the sideboard.Despite her songbird appearance, the Lady Annabelle plainly had the soul of a master sergeant.Yes, now that hes awake, the sooner the better, I said.Have you a flat board about two feet long, I asked, a stout strap, and perhaps some small straight flat sticks, about so long?I held my fingers apart, measuring a length of four inches or so.One of the servants disappeared into the shadows, flicking out of sight like a djinn to do my bidding.The whole house seemed magical, perhaps because of the contrast between the howling cold outside and the luxurious warmth within, or maybe only because of the relief of seeing Jamie safe, after so many hours of fear and worry.Heavy dark furniture gleamed with polish in the lamplight, silver shone on the sideboard, and a collection of delicate glass and china ornamented the mantelpiece, in bizarre contrast to the bloody, bedraggled figure before it.No questions were asked.We were Sir Marcuss guests, and Lady Annabelle behaved as though it were an everyday occurrence to have people come and bleed on the carpet at midnight.It occurred to me for the first time that such a visit might have happened before.Verra nasty, said Sir Marcus, examining the smashed hand with an expertise born of the battlefield.And wretched painful, too, I expect.Still, its no going to kill ye, is it?He straightened up and addressed me in confidential tones.I thought it might be worse than this, given what ye told me.Except the ribs and hand, theres no bones broken, and the rest will heal fine.Id say maybe ye were lucky, lad.There was a faint snort from the recumbent figure on the bed.I suppose ye could call it luck.They meant to be hanging me in the morning.He moved his head restlessly on the pillow, trying to look up at Sir Marcus.Did ye know thatsir?he added, catching sight of Sir Marcuss embroidered waistcoat, with its coat of arms worked in silver stitchery among the pigeons and roses.MacRannoch waved a hand, dismissing this minor detail.Weel, if he meant to be keepin ye presentable for the hangsman, he went a bit far on your back, then, Sir Marcus remarked, removing the soaked lint and replacing it with a fresh pad.Aye.He lost his head a bit whenwhen he Jamie struggled to get the words out, then gave it up as a bad job and turned his face to the fire, eyes closed.God, Im tired, he said.We let him rest until the manservant materialized by my elbow with the splints I had requested.Then I carefully picked up the smashed right hand, bringing it into the candlelight for examination.It would have to be set, and as soon as possible.The injured muscles were already clawing the fingers inward.I felt hopeless as I saw the full extent of the damage.But if he was ever to have any use of the hand again, it would have to be attempted.Lady Annabelle had hung back during my examination, watching interestedly.When I set the hand down, she stepped forward and opened the small chest of medical supplies.I suppose youll be wanting the boneset, and perhaps the cherry bark.I dont know She eyed Jamie doubtfully.Leeches, do you think?Her well kept hand hovered over a small lidded jar filled with murky liquid.I shuddered and shook my head.No, I dont think so; not just now.What I could really usedo you by chance have any sort of opiate?I sank to my knees beside her to pore over the contents of the box.Oh, yes!Her hand went unerringly to a small green flask.Flowers of laudanum, she read from the label.Will that do?Perfect.I accepted the flask gratefully.All right, then, I said briskly to Jamie, pouring a small amount of the odorous liquid into a glass, youll need to sit up just long enough to swallow this.Then youll go to sleep and stay that way for a good long time.In fact, I had some doubts as to the advisability of administering laudanum on top of such a quantity of whisky, but the alternativereconstructing that hand while he was consciouswas unthinkable.I tipped the bottle to pour a bit more.Jamies good hand on my arm stopped me.I dont want drugs, he said firmly.Just perhaps a wee drop more of whiskyhe hesitated, tongue touching the bitten lipand maybe something to bite down on.Sir Marcus, hearing this, crossed to the lovely glowing Sheraton desk in the corner and began to rummage.He returned in a moment with a small piece of well worn leather.Looking more closely, I could see the dozens of overlapping semicircular indentations in the thick leathertoothmarks, I realized with a shock.Here, Sir Marcus said helpfully.I used this myself at St.Simone; got me through it while I had a musket ball dug out of my leg.I looked on, open mouthed, as Jamie took the leather with a nod of thanks, smoothing his thumb over the marks.I spoke slowly, stunned.You actually expect me to set nine broken bones while youre awake?Yes, he said briefly, placing the leather between his teeth and biting down experimentally.He shifted it back and forth, seeking a comfortable grip.Overcome by the sheer theatricality of it, the precarious control I had been hoarding suddenly snapped.Will you stop being such a goddamned frigging hero!I blazed at Jamie.We all know what youve done, you dont have to prove how much you can stand!Or do you think well all fall apart if youre not in charge, telling everyone what to do every minute?Who in bloody hell do you think you are, frigging John Wayne!?There was an awkward silence.Jamie looked at me, openmouthed.Finally he spoke.Claire, he said softly, were perhaps two miles from Wentworth prison.Im meant to hang in the morning.No matter whats happened to Randall, the English are going to notice Im gone soon.I bit my lip.What he said was true.My inadvertent release of the other prisoners might confuse the issue for a time, but eventually a tally would be made, and a search begun.And thanks to the flamboyant method of escape I had chosen, attention was bound to be focused on Eldridge Manor in short order.If were lucky, the quiet voice continued, the snow will delay a search til weve gone.If not He shrugged, staring into the flames.Claire, Ill not let them take me back.And to be drugged, to lie here helpless if they come, and maybe wake up chained in a cell again.Claire, I couldna bear it.There were tears blurring on my lower lashes.I stared wide eyed at him, not wanting to blink and let them run down my cheeks.He closed his eyes against the fires heat.The glow lent a spurious look of ruddy health to the white cheeks.I could see the long muscles in his throat work as he swallowed.Dont cry, Sassenach, he said, so softly I could hardly hear him.He reached out and patted my leg with his good hand, trying to be reassuring.I imagine were safe enough, lass.If I thought likely wed be captured, Id certainly no waste one of my last hours having you mend a hand Id not be going to need.Go and fetch Murtagh for me.Then bring me a drink and well get on wi it.Busy at the table with the medical preparations, I couldnt hear what he said to Murtagh, but I saw the two heads close together for a moment, then Murtaghs sinewy hand gently touch the younger mans earone of the few uninjured spots available.With a brief nod of farewell, Murtagh sidled toward the door.Like a rat, I thought, darting along the wainscoting, not to be noticed.I was behind him as he went out into the hall, and grabbed him by the plaid just before he escaped altogether through the front door.What did he tell you?I demanded fiercely.Where are you going?The dark stringy little man hesitated for a moment, but answered evenly, Im to go wi young Absalom toward Wentworth and keep watch in that direction.If any Redcoats are headin this way, Im to beat them here, and if theres time, Im to see you and him both hidden, then ride off with three horses, to draw followers away from the Manor.Theres a cellar; it might do for hiding, if the search isna too thorough.And if there isnt time to hide?I eyed him narrowly, daring him not to answer.Then Im to kill him, and take you wi me, he answered promptly.Willing or no, he added, with an evil grin, and turned to go.Just a minute!I spoke sharply and he stopped.Do you have an extra dirk?His scruffy brows shot upward, but his hand went to his belt without hesitation.Do ye need one?Here?His glance took in the opulence and serenity of the entrance hall, with its painted Adam ceiling and linenfold paneling.My dagger pocket was shredded beyond use.I took the proffered dagger, and slid it between kirtle and bodice in the back, as I had seen the Gypsy women do.One never knows, does one?I said evenly.* * *    Preparations complete, I probed as gently as possible, assessing harm, deciding what must be done.Jamie drew in his breath sharply when I touched an especially bad spot, but kept his eyes closed as I felt my way slowly along each separate bone and joint, noting the position of each fracture and dislocation.Sorry, I murmured.I took his good hand as well, and felt carefully down each finger of both the good hand and the injured, making comparisons.With neither X rays nor experience to guide me, I would have to depend on my own sensitivity to find and realign the smashed bones.The first joint was all right, but the second phalange was cracked, I thought.I pressed harder to determine the length and direction of the crack.The damaged hand stayed motionless in my fingers, but the good one made a small, involuntary clenching gesture.Im sorry, I murmured once more.The good hand pulled suddenly out of my grasp as Jamie raised himself on one elbow.Spitting out the leather gag, he regarded me with an expression between amusement and exasperation.Sassenach, he said, if you apologize each time ye hurt me, its going to be a verra long nightand its lasted some time already.I must have looked stricken, because he started to reach toward me, then stopped, wincing at the movement.He controlled the pain, though, and spoke firmly.I know you dinna wish to hurt me.But youve no more choice about it than I have, and theres no need for more than one of us to suffer for it.You do whats needed, and Ill scream if I have to.Replacing the leather strip, he bared his clenched teeth ferociously at me, then slowly and deliberately crossed his eyes.This made him look so like an addlepated tiger that I burst into half hysterical laughter before I could stop myself.I clapped my hands over my mouth, cheeks flaming as I saw the astonished looks on the faces of Lady Annabelle and the servants, who, standing behind Jamie, naturally could see nothing of his face.Sir Marcus, who had caught a brief glimpse from his seat at the bedside, grinned in his spade shaped beard.Besides, said Jamie, spitting out the leather once more, if the English turn up after this, I expect Ill beg them to take me back.I picked up the leather, put it between his teeth and pushed his head down again.Clown, I said.Know all.Sodding hero.But he had relieved me of a burden, and I worked more calmly.If I still noticed every twitch and grimace, at least I no longer felt it as badly.I began to lose myself in the concentration of the job, directing all my awareness to my fingertips, assessing each point of damage and deciding how best to draw the smashed bones back into alignment.Luckily the thumb had suffered least; only a simple fracture of the first joint.That would heal clean.The second knuckle on the fourth finger was completely gone; I felt only a pulpy grating of bone chips when I rolled it gently between my own thumb and forefinger, making Jamie groan.Nothing could be done about that, save splint the joint and hope for the best.The compound fracture of the middle finger was the worst to contemplate.The finger would have to be pulled straight, drawing the protruding bone back through the torn flesh.I had seen this done beforeunder general anesthesia, with the guidance of X rays.To this point, it had been more a mechanical problem than a real one, deciding how to reconstruct a smashed, disembodied hand.I was now smack up against the reason that physicians seldom treat members of their own families.Some jobs in medicine require a certain ruthlessness to complete successfully; detachment is necessary to inflict pain in the process of effecting a healing.Quietly, Sir Marcus had brought up a stool by the side of the bed.He settled his bulk comfortably as I finished the strapping, and gripped Jamies good hand with his own.Squeeze all ye like, lad, he said.Divested of the bearskin, and with his grizzled locks neatly clubbed and laced back, MacRannoch was no longer the intimidating wildman of the forest, but appeared as a soberly clad man of late middle age, with a neatly trimmed spade beard and a military bearing.Nervous at what I was about to attempt, I found his solid presence comforting.I drew a deep breath and prayed for detachment.* * *    It was a long, horrible, nerve wracking job, though not without its fascination.Some parts, such as the splinting of the two fingers with simple fractures, went quite easily.Others did not.Jamie did screamloudlywhen I set his middle finger, exerting the considerable force necessary to draw the ends of splintered bone back through the skin.I hesitated for an instant, unnerved, but Go on, lass!Sir Marcus said with quiet urgency.I remembered suddenly what Jamie had said to me, the night Jennys baby was born: I can bear pain, myself, but I could not bear yours.That would take more strength than I have.He was right; it did take strength; I hoped that each of us had enough.Jamies face was turned away from me, but I could see the jaw muscles bunch as he clenched his teeth harder on the leather strip.I clenched my own teeth and did go on; the sharp bone end slowly disappeared back through the skin and the finger straightened with agonizing reluctance, leaving us both trembling.As I worked, I began to lose consciousness of anything outside the job I was doing.Jamie groaned occasionally, and we had to stop twice briefly in order for him to be sick, retching up mostly whisky, as he had taken little food in prison.For the most part, though, he kept up a low, constant muttering in Gaelic, forehead pressed hard against Sir Marcuss knees.I couldnt tell through the leather gag whether he was cursing or praying.All five fingers eventually lay straight as new pins, stiff as sticks in their bandaged splints.I was afraid of infection, particularly from the torn middle finger, but otherwise was fairly sure they would heal well.By good luck, only the one joint had been badly damaged.It would likely leave him with a stiff ring finger, but the others might function normallyin time.There was nothing I could do about the cracked metacarpal bones or the puncture wound except apply an antiseptic wash and a poultice and pray against a tetanus infection.I stepped back, shaking in every limb from the strain of the night, my bodice soaked with sweat from the fires heat at my back.Lady Annabelle was at my side at once, guiding me to a chair and pressing a cup of tea, laced with whisky, into my shaking hands.Sir Marcus, as good an operating room assistant as any physician could have, was unfastening Jamies captive arm and rubbing the marks where the strap had bitten deep into straining flesh.The older mans hand was red, I saw, where Jamie had gripped it.I was not aware of having nodded off, but suddenly jerked, my head snapping on my neck.Lady Annabelle was urging me upward, soft hand under my elbow.Come along, my dear.Youre all in; you must have your own hurts seen to, and sleep a bit.I shook her off as politely as possible.No, I cant.I must finish My words trailed off into the fuzziness of my mind, as Sir Marcus smoothly took the vinegar bottle and rag from my hand.Ill take care of the rest, he said.Ive some experience wi field dressing, ye understand.Flipping back the blankets, he began to swab the blood from the whip cuts, moving with a brisk gentleness that was impressive.Catching my eye, he grinned, beard tilted jauntily.Ive cleansed a good many stripes in my time, he said.And applied a few too.These are naught, lass; theyll heal in a few days.Knowing he was right, I walked up to the head of the cot.Jamie was awake, grimacing slightly at the sting of the antiseptic solution on the raw cuts, but his eyelids were heavy and the blue eyes darkened with pain and weariness.Go and sleep, Sassenach.Ill do.Whether he would or not, I didnt know.It was clear, however, that I wouldnt do, or not for much longer.I was swaying with exhaustion and the scratches on my legs were beginning to burn and ache.Absalom had cleansed them for me at the cottage, but they needed salving.I nodded numbly and turned in response to Lady Annabelles gently insistent pressure on my elbow.Halfway up the stairs, I remembered that I had forgotten to tell Sir Marcus how to bandage the cuts.The deep wounds over the shoulders would have to be bound and padded, to allow for wearing a shirt over them when we made our escape.But the lighter lash marks should be left in the open air to scab over.I took a quick look at the guestroom Lady Annabelle showed me, then excused myself with a word and stumbled back down the stairs toward the drawing room.I paused in the shadowed doorway, Lady Annabelle behind me.Jamies eyes were closed; apparently he had fallen into a doze brought on by whisky and fatigue.The blankets were thrown back, rendered unnecessary by the heat of the fire.Sir Marcus casually rested a hand on Jamies bare rump as he reached across the bed for a rag.The effect was electric.Jamies back arched sharply, the muscles of his buttocks clenched tightly and he let out an involuntary sound of protest, flinging himself backward in spite of the shattered ribs, to glare up at Sir Marcus with startled, dazed eyes.Startled himself, Sir Marcus stood stock still for a second, then leaned forward and took Jamie by the arm, gently settling him facedown once more.Thoughtfully he drew a finger very gingerly across Jamies flesh.He rubbed his fingers together, leaving an oily sheen visible in the firelight.Oh, he said matter of factly.The old soldier drew the blanket up to Jamies waist, and I saw the tense shoulders relax slightly under their dressing.Sir Marcus seated himself companionably near Jamies head and poured another pair of whiskies.At least he had the consideration to grease ye a bit beforehand, he observed, handing one beaker to Jamie, who heaved himself laboriously up on his elbows to accept it.Aye, well.I dinna think it was so much for my convenience, he said dryly.Sir Marcus took a gulp of his drink and smacked his lips meditatively.There was no sound for a moment save the crackle of flames, but neither Lady Annabelle nor I made any motion to enter the room.If its any comfort to ye, Sir Marcus said suddenly, eyes fixed on the decanter, hes dead.Youre sure?Jamies tone was unreadable.I dinna see how anybody could live after bein trampled flat by thirty half ton beasts.He peeked out into the corridor to see what was causin the noise, then tried to go back when he saw.A horn caught him by the sleeve and pulled him out, and I saw him go down next to the wall.Sir Fletcher an I were on the stair, keepin out o the way.O course Sir Fletcher was rare excited, and sent some men after im, but they couldna get anywhere near, with all the horns pokin and beasts shovin, and the torches shook down from the wall wi the ruckus.Christ, man, ye should ha seen it!Sir Marcus hooted at the memory, clutching the decanter by the neck.Your wifes a rare lass, and no mistake, lad!Snorting, he poured out another glass and gulped, choking a bit as the laugh interfered with the swallow.Anyway, he resumed, pounding himself on the chest, by the time wed cleared the cattle out, there was no much left but a rag doll rolled in blood.Sir Fletchers men carried him awa, but if he was still livin then, he didna last long.A bit more, lad?Aye, thanks.There was a short silence, broken by Jamie.No, I canna say its much comfort to me, but thank ye for tellin me.Sir Marcus looked at him shrewdly.Mmphm.Yere no goin to forget it, he said abruptly.Dont bother to try.If ye can, let it heal like the rest o your wounds.Dont pick at it, and itll mend clean.The old warrior held up a knotted forearm, from which the sleeve had been pushed back during his ministrations, to show the scar of a jagged tear running from elbow to wrist.Scars are nothin to trouble ye.Aye, well.Some scars, maybe.Apparently reminded of something, Jamie struggled to turn onto his side.Sir Marcus set down his glass with an exclamation.Here, lad, be careful!Yell get a rib end through the lung, next thing.He helped Jamie balance on his right elbow, wadding a blanket behind to prop him there.I need a wee knife, said Jamie, breathing heavily.A sharp one, if its handy.Without question, Sir Marcus lumbered to the gleaming French walnut sideboard and rummaged through the drawers with a prodigious clatter, emerging at last with a pearl handled fruit knife.He thrust it into Jamies sound left hand and sat down again with a grunt, resuming his glass.Ye dont think ye have enough scars?he inquired.Going to add a few more?Just one.Jamie balanced precariously on one elbow, chin pressed on his chest as he awkwardly aimed the razor sharp knife under his left breast.Sir Marcuss hand shot out, a bit unsteadily, and gripped Jamies wrist.Best let me help ye, man.Yell fall on it in a moment.After a moments pause, Jamie reluctantly surrendered the knife and lay back against the wadded blanket.He touched his chest an inch or two below the nipple.There.Sir Marcus reached to the sideboard and snagged a lamp, setting it on the stool he had vacated.At this distance, I couldnt see what he was peering at; it looked like a small red burn, roughly circular in shape.He took another deliberate pull at his whisky glass, then set it down next to the lamp and pressed the tip of the knife against Jamies chest.I must have made an involuntary movement, because the Lady Annabelle clutched my sleeve with a murmured caution.The knife point pressed in and twisted suddenly, flicking away in the motion one uses to cut a bad spot out of a ripe peach.Jamie grunted, once, and a thin stream of red ran down the slope of his belly to stain the blanket.He rolled onto his stomach, stanching the wound against the mattress.Sir Marcus laid down the fruit knife.As soon as yere able, man, he advised, take your wife to bed, and let her comfort ye.Women like to do that, he said, grinning toward the shadowed doorway, God knows why.Lady Annabelle said softly, Come away now, dear.Hes better alone for a bit.I decided that Sir Marcus could manage the bandaging by himself, and stumbled after her up the narrow stair to my room.* * *    I woke with a start from a dream of endless winding stairs, with horror lurking at the bottom.Tiredness dragged at my back and my legs ached, but I sat up in my borrowed nightdress and groped for the candle and flintbox.I felt uneasy, so far from Jamie.What if he needed me?Worse, what if the English did come, while he was alone below, unarmed?I pressed my face against the cold casement, reassured by the steady hiss of snow against the panes.While the storm continued, we were likely safe.I pulled on a bedgown, and picking up candle and dirk, made my way to the stair.The house was quiet, save for the fires crackle.Jamie was asleep, or at least had his eyes closed, face turned to the fire.I sat down on the hearthrug, quietly, so as not to wake him.This was the first time we had been alone together since those few desperate minutes in the dungeon of Wentworth Prison.It felt as though that were many years ago.I studied Jamie carefully, as though inspecting a stranger.He seemed not too bad physically, all things considered, but I worried nonetheless.He had had enough whisky during the surgery to fell a draft horse, and a good bit of it was plainly still inside him, despite the retching.Jamie was not my first hero.The men moved too quickly through the field hospital, as a rule, for the nurses to become well acquainted with them, but now and again you would see a man who talked too little or joked too much, who held himself more stiffly than pain and loneliness would account for.And I knew, roughly, what could be done for them.If there was time, and if they were the kind who talked to keep the dark at bay, you sat with them and listened.If they were silent, you touched them often in passing, and watched for the unguarded moment, when you might draw them outside of themselves and hold them while they exorcised their demons.If there was time.And if there wasnt, then you jabbed them with morphine, and hoped they would manage to find someone else to listen, while you passed on to a man whose wounds were visible.Jamie would talk to someone, sooner or later.There was time.But I hoped it wouldnt be me.He was uncovered to the waist, and I leaned forward to examine his back.It was a remarkable sight.Barely a hands thickness separated the welted cuts, inflicted with a regularity that boggled the mind.He must have stood like a guardsman while it was done.I stole a quick glance at his wristsunmarked.He had kept his word then, not to struggle.And had stood unmoving through the ordeal, paying the ransom agreed on for my life.I rubbed my eyes on my sleeve.He wouldnt thank me, I thought, for blubbering over his prostrate form.I shifted my weight with a soft rustle of skirts.He opened his eyes at the sound, but did not seem particularly haunted.He gave me a smile, faint and tired, but a real one.I opened my mouth, and suddenly realized I had no idea what to say to him.Thanks were impossible.How do you feel?was ridiculous; obviously he felt like hell.While I considered, he spoke first.Claire?Are you all right, love?Am I all right?My God, Jamie!Tears stung my eyelids and I blinked hard, sniffing.He raised his good hand slowly, as though it were weighted with chains, and stroked my hair.He drew me toward him, but I pulled away, conscious for the first time what I must look like, face scratched and covered with tree sap, hair stiff with blotches of various unmentionable substances.Come here, he said.I want to hold ye a moment.But Im covered with blood and vomit, I protested, making a vain effort to tidy my hair.He wheezed, the faint exhalation that was all his broken ribs would permit in the way of laughter.Mother of God, Sassenach, its my blood and my vomit.Come here.His arm was comforting around my shoulders.I rested my head on the pillow next to his, and we sat in silence by the fire, drawing strength and peace from one another.His fingers gently touched the small wound under my jaw.I did not think ever to see ye again, Sassenach.His voice was low and a bit hoarse from whisky and screaming.Im glad youre here.I sat up.Not see me again!Why?Did you think I wouldnt get you out?He smiled, one sided.Weel, no, I didnt expect ye would.I thought if I said so, though, ye might get stubborn and refuse to go.Me get stubborn!I said indignantly.Look whos talking!There was a pause, which grew slightly awkward.There were things I should ask, necessary from the medical point of view, but rather touchy from the personal aspect.Finally, I settled for How do you feel?His eyes were closed, shadowed and sunken in the candlelight, but the lines of the broad back were tense under the bandages.The wide, bruised mouth twitched, somewhere between a smile and a grimace.I dont know, Sassenach.Ive never felt like this.I seem to want to do a number of things, all at once, but my minds at war wi me, and my bodys turned traitor.I want to get out of here at once, and run as fast and as far as I can.I want to hit someone.God, I want to hit someone!I want to burn Wentworth Prison to the ground.I want to sleep.Stone doesnt burn, I said practically.Maybe youd better sleep, instead.His good hand groped for mine and found it, and the mouth relaxed somewhat, though his eyes stayed closed.I want to hold you hard to me and kiss you, and never let you go.I want to take you to my bed and use you like a whore, til I forget that I exist.And I want to put my head in your lap and weep like a child.The mouth turned up at one corner, and a blue eye opened slitwise.Unfortunately, he said, I cant do any but the last of those without fainting or being sick again.Well, then, I suppose youll just have to settle for that, and put the rest under the heading of future business, I said, laughing a little.It took a bit of shifting, and he nearly was sick again, but at last I was seated on his cot, my back against the wall, and his head resting on my thigh.What was it Sir Marcus cut from your breast?I asked.A brand?I said softly, as he gave me no reply.The bright head moved slightly in affirmation.A signet, with his initials.Jamie laughed shortly.Its enough Ill carry his marks for the rest of my life, without letting him sign me, like a bloody painting.His head lay heavy on my thigh and his breathing eased at last in drowsy exhalations.The white bandages on his hand were ghostly against the dark blanket.I gently traced a burn mark on his shoulder, gleaming faintly with sweet oil.Jamie?Mmm?Are you badly hurt?Awake, he glanced from his bandaged hand to my face.His eyes closed and he began to shake.Alarmed, I thought I had triggered some unbearable memory, until I realized that he was laughing, hard enough to force tears from the corners of his eyes.Sassenach, he said at length, gasping, Ive maybe six square inches of skin left that are not bruised, burned, or cut.Am I hurt?And he shook again, making the felted mattress rustle and squeak.Somewhat crossly, I said, I meant but he stopped me by putting his good hand over mine and bringing it to his lips.I know what ye meant, Sassenach, he said, turning his head to look up at me.Never worry, the six inches that are left are all between my legs.I appreciated the effort it took to make the joke, feeble as it was.I slapped his mouth lightly.Youre drunk, James Fraser, I said.I paused a moment.Six, eh?Aye, well.Maybe seven, then.Oh, God, Sassenach, dinna make me laugh again, my ribs wont stand it.I wiped his eyes with a fold of my skirt and fed him a sip of water, holding his head up with my knee.That isnt what I meant, anyway, I said.Serious then, he reached for my hand again and squeezed it.I know, he said.Ye needna be delicate about it.He drew a cautious breath, and winced at the results.I was right, it did hurt less than flogging.He closed his eyes.But it was much less enjoyable.A quick flash of bitter humor stirred one corner of his mouth.At least Ill not be costive for a bit.I flinched, and he gritted his teeth, breathing in short, reedy gasps.Im sorry, Sassenach.Ididna think Id mind it so much.What you meanthatits all right.Im not damaged.I made an effort to keep my own voice steady and matter of fact.You dont have to tell me about it, if you dont want to.If it might ease you, though My voice trailed off in embarrassed silence.I dont want to.His voice was suddenly bitter and emphatic.I dont want ever to think about it again, but short of cutting my throat, I think I have not got a choice about it.Nay, lass, I dinna want to tell ye about it, any more than ye want to hear itbut I think I am going to have to drag it all out before it chokes me.The words came out now in a burst of bitterness.He wanted me to crawl and beg, and by Christ, I did so.I told ye once, Sassenach, ye can break anyone if youre willing to hurt them enough.Well, he was willing.He made me crawl, and he made me beg; he made me do worse things than that, and before the end he made me want verra badly to be dead.He was silent for a long moment, looking into the fire, then heaved a deep sigh, grimacing at the pain.I wish ye could ease me, Sassenach, I do wish it most fervently, for Ive little of ease in me now.But its not like a poisoned thorn, where if ye found the right grip, ye could draw it clean out.His good hand rested on my knee.He flexed the fingers and spread them flat, ruddy in the firelight.Its not even like a brokenness anywhere.If ye could mend it bit by bit, like ye did my hand, Id stand the pain gladly.He bunched the fingers into a fist and rested it on my leg, frowning at it.Itsdifficult to explain.Itsits likeI think its as though everyone has a small place inside themselves, maybe, a private bit that they keep to themselves.Its like a little fortress, where the most private part of you livesmaybe its your soul, maybe just that bit that makes you yourself and not anyone else.His tongue probed his swollen lip unconsciously as he thought.You dont show that bit of yourself to anyone, usually, unless sometimes to someone that ye love greatly.The hand relaxed, curling around my knee.Jamies eyes were closed again, lids sealed against the light.Now, its likelike my own fortress has been blown up with gunpowdertheres nothing left of it but ashes and a smoking rooftree, and the little naked thing that lived there once is out in the open, squeaking and whimpering in fear, tryin to hide itself under a blade of grass or a bit o leaf, butbut notmakin m much of a job of it.His voice broke, and he turned his head so that his face was hidden in my skirt.Helpless, I could do nothing but stroke his hair.He suddenly raised his head, face strained as though it would break apart along the seams of the bones.Ive been close to death a few times, Claire, but Ive never really wanted to die.This time I did.I His voice cracked and he stopped speaking, clutching my knee hard.When he spoke again, his voice was high and oddly breathless, as though he had been running a long way.Claire, will youI justClaire, hold on to me.If I start to shake again now, I canna stop it.Claire, hold me!He was in fact beginning to tremble violently, the shivering making him moan as it caught the splintered ribs.I was afraid to hurt him, but more afraid to let the shaking go on.I crouched over him, wrapped my arms around his shoulders and held on as tightly as I could, rocking to and fro as though the comforting rhythm might break the racking spasms.I got one hand on the back of his neck and dug my fingers deep into the pillared muscles, willing the clenching to relax as I massaged the deep groove at the base of the skull.Finally the trembling eased, and his head fell forward onto my thigh, exhausted.Im sorry, he said a minute later, in his normal voice.I didna mean to go on so.The truth is I do hurt verra bad, and I am most awfully damn drunk.Im no in much control of mysel.For a Scot to admit, even privately, to being drunk, was some indication, I thought, of just how badly he did hurt.You need sleep, I said softly, still rubbing the back of his neck.You need it badly.I used my fingers as best I could, gentling and pressing as Old Alec had showed me, and managed to ease him back into drowsiness.Im cold, he murmured.There was a good fire, and several blankets on the bed, but his fingers were chilly to the touch.Youre in shock, I said practically.Youve lost the hell of a lot of blood.I looked around, but MacRannochs and servants alike had all disappeared to their own beds.Murtagh, I assumed, was still out in the snow, keeping an eye out in the direction of Wentworth in case of pursuit.With a mental shrug for anyones opinion of the proprieties, I stood up, stripped off the nightdress, and crawled under the blankets.As gently as possible, I eased against him, giving him my warmth.He turned his face into my shoulder like a small boy.I stroked his hair, gentling him, rubbing the ridged columns of muscle at the back of his neck, avoiding the raw places.Lay your head, then, man, I said, remembering Jenny and her boy.Jamie gave a small grunt of amusement.Thats what my mother used to say to me, he murmured.When I was a bairn.Sassenach, he said against my shoulder, a moment later.Mm?Who in Gods name is John Wayne?You are, I said.Go to sleep.37    ESCAPE    His color was better in the morning, though the bruises had darkened through the night and now mottled a good part of his face.He sighed deeply, then stiffened with a groan and let his breath out much more cautiously.How do you feel?I laid a hand on his head.Cool and damp.No fever, thank God.He grimaced, eyes still closed.Sassenach, if Ive got one, it hurts.He extended his good hand, groping.Help me up; Im stiff as pudding.The snow stopped at mid morning.The sky was still grey as wool, threatening further flurries, but the threat of search from Wentworth was greater yet, so we set out from Eldridge Manor just before noon, heavily cloaked against the weather.Murtagh and Jamie bristled with arms beneath their cloaks.I carried nothing but my dagger, and that well hidden.Much against my own will, I was to pose as a kidnapped English hostage, should the worst happen.But theyve seen me at the prison, I had argued.Sir Fletcher already knows who I am.Aye.Murtagh was carefully loading the pistols, an array of balls, wadding, powder, patches, rods, and pouches neatly spread on Lady Annabelles polished table, but looked up to nail me with a black glance.Thats just the point, lass.We must keep ye out o Wentworth, no matter what.Do no one any good to have ye in there along wi us.He rammed a short rod down the mouth of a scroll butted dag, punching the wad into place with hard, economical strokes.Sir Fletcher willna be doin his own huntin, not on a day like this.Any Redcoats we meet will likely not know ye.If were found out, ye mun say we forced ye along wi us unwillin, and convince the Redcoats yeve nothin to do wi a pair o Scottish scalawags like me an yon ragtag.He nodded at Jamie, balancing gingerly on a stool with a bowl of warm bread and milk.Sir Marcus and I had padded Jamies hips and thighs as thickly as we could with linen bandages under a pair of worn breeches and hose, dark in color to hide any telltale blood spots that might seep through.Lady Annabelle had split one of her husbands shirts down the back to accommodate the breadth of Jamies shoulders and the thickness of the bandage across them.Even so, the shirt would not meet across the front, and the ends of the strapping around his chest peeked through.He had refused to comb his hair, on grounds that even his scalp was sore, and he looked a wild and woolly sight, red spikes sticking up above a swollen purple face with one eye squeezed disreputably shut.If yere taken, Sir Marcus chipped in, tell them yere a guest of mine, kidnapped while riding near the estate.Make them bring ye to Eldridge for me to identify.That should convince em.Well tell em youre a friend of Annabelles, from London.And then get you safely out of here before Sir Fletcher comes round to offer his regards, Annabelle added, practically.Sir Marcus had offered us Hector and Absalom as escorts, but Murtagh pointed out that this would certainly implicate Eldridge, should we meet any English soldiers.So there were only the three of us, bundled against the cold, on the road toward Dingwall.I carried a fat purse and a note from the Master of Eldridge, one or both of which should insure our passage across the Channel.It was hard going through the snow.Less than a foot deep, the treacherous white stuff hid rocks, holes, and other obstacles, making footing for the horses slippery and dangerous.Clods of snow and mud flew up with each step, spattering bellies and hocks, and clouds of horse breath vanished steaming into the frozen air.Murtagh led the way, following the faint depression that marked the road.I rode beside Jamie, to help if he should lose consciousness, though he was, at his own insistence, tied to his horse.Only his left hand was free, resting on the pistol looped to the saddle bow, concealed under his cloak.We passed a few scattered bothies, smoke rising from the thatched roofs, but the inhabitants and their beasts seemed all within, secured against the cold.Here and there a lone man passed from cot to shed, carrying buckets or hay, but the road was deserted for the most part.Two miles from Eldridge we passed under the shadow of Wentworth Castle, a grim bulk set in the hillside.The road was trampled here; traffic in and out did not cease even in the worst of weathers.Our passage had been timed to coincide with the midday meal, in hopes that the sentries would be immersed in their pasties and ale.We plodded slowly past the short road that led to the gate, just a party of travelers with the ill luck to be abroad on such a miserable day.Once past the prison, we paused to rest the horses for a moment, in the shelter of a small pine grove.Murtagh bent to peer under the slouch hat that masked Jamies telltale hair.All right, lad?Yere quiet.Jamie lifted his head.His face was pale, and trickles of sweat ran down his neck, despite the icy wind, but he managed a half hearted grin.Ill do.How do you feel?I asked, anxious.He sat slumped in the saddle, without much sign of his usual erect grace.I got the other half of the grin.Ive been trying to decide which hurts worstmy ribs, my hand, or my arse.Tryin to choose among them keeps my mind off my back.He took a deep pull from the flask which Sir Marcus had thoughtfully provided, shuddered, and passed it to me.It was a good deal better than the raw spirit I had drunk on the road to Leoch, but every bit as potent.We rode on, a small cheerful fire burning in my stomach.The horses were laboring up a modest slope, snow spurting from their hooves, when I saw Murtaghs head jerk up.Following the direction of his gaze, I saw the Redcoat soldiers, four of them, mounted, at the top of the slope.There was no help for it.We had been seen, and a shouted challenge echoed down the hill.There was no place to run.We were going to have to try to bluff it out.Without a backward glance, Murtagh spurred forward to meet them.The corporal with the group was a middle aged career soldier, erect in his winter greatcoat.He bowed politely to me, then turned his attention to Jamie.Your pardon, sir, madame.We have orders to stop all parties traveling this road, to inquire for details of prisoners lately escaped from Wentworth Prison.Prisoners.So I had managed to release more than Jamie yesterday.I was glad of it, on various grounds.For one, they would dilute the search somewhat.Four against three was better odds than we might have expected.Jamie didnt reply, but slouched farther forward, letting his head loll.I could see the gleam of his eyes beneath the hat brim; he wasnt unconscious.These must be men he knew; his voice would be recognized.Murtagh was edging his horse forward, between me and the soldiers.Aye, the masters a bit the worse for illness, sir, as ye can see, he said, obsequiously tugging his forelock.Perhaps ye could point out the road toward Ballagh to me?Im no convinced that were headed right.I wondered what on earth he was up to, until I caught his eye.His glance flickered back and down, then back to the soldier, so fast that the soldier would assume him to have been listening with rapt attention all the time.Was Jamie in danger of falling from the saddle?Pretending to adjust my bonnet, I glanced casually over my shoulder in the direction he had indicated, and nearly froze with shock.Jamie was sitting upright, head bent to shadow his face.But blood was dripping gently from the tip of the stirrup under his foot, pocking the snow with gently steaming red pits.Murtagh, pretending vast stupidity, had succeeded in drawing the soldiers ahead to the crest of the hill, so that they could point out that the road to Dingwall was the only road in sight, which ran down the other side of the hill.It ran through Ballagh, and straight toward the coast, still three miles away.I slid hastily to the ground, yanking feverishly at my horses girth strap.Floundering through the drifts, I kicked enough snow under the belly of Jamies horse to obliterate the telltale drops.A quick look showed the soldiers apparently still engaged in argument with Murtagh, though one of them glanced down the hill at us, as though to insure that we had not wandered off.I gave a cheery wave, then as soon as the soldier turned his head, stooped and ripped off one of the three petticoats I was wearing.I whipped Jamies cloak aside and stuffed the wadded petticoat under his thigh, ignoring his exclamation of pain.The cloak flipped back in place just in time for me to dash back to my own horse and be discovered fiddling with the girth when Murtagh and the Englishmen arrived.It seems to have worked its way loose, I explained guilelessly, batting my eyes at the nearest redcoat.Oh?And why are you not helping the lady?he said to Jamie.My husbands not well, I said.I can manage it myself, thank you.The corporal seemed interested.Sick, eh?Whats the matter with you, then?He urged his beast forward, staring closely under the slouch hat at Jamies pale face.Dont look well, Ill say that much.Take your hat off, fellow.Whats the matter with your face?Jamie shot him through the folds of his cloak.The redcoat was no more than six feet away, and he toppled sideways out of the saddle before the stain on his chest grew bigger than my hand.Murtagh had a pistol in each hand before the corporal hit the ground.One bullet went wild as his horse shied away from the sudden noise and movement.The second found its mark, ripping through a soldiers upper arm leaving a tuft of shredded fabric flapping from a rapidly reddening sleeve.The man kept his saddle, though, and was tugging at his saber, one handed, as Murtagh plunged beneath his cloak for fresh weapons.One of the two remaining soldiers turned his horse, slipping in the snow, and spurred away, back toward the prison, presumably in search of help.Claire!The shout came from above.I looked up, startled, to see Jamie waving after the fleeing figure.Stop him!He had time to toss me a second pistol, then turned back, drawing his sword to meet the charge of the fourth soldier.My horse was battle trained; his ears were laid flat against his head and he stamped and pawed at the noise, but he hadnt run at the sound of gunshots, and he stood his ground as I groped for the saddle iron.Glad to be leaving the fight behind, he dug in as soon as I was mounted, and we made off at good speed after the fleeing figure.The snow hampered our going nearly as much as his, but mine was the better horse, and we had the advantage of the rough path the soldiers flight had plowed through the fresh snow.We gained slowly on him, but I could see that it wouldnt be enough.He had a rise ahead of him, though; if I cut to the right, perhaps I could make better time on the flat and meet him coming down the other side.I jerked the rein and leaned hard to keep my seat as the horse slithered into a messy turn, found his feet and plunged ahead.I didnt quite catch him up, but I had cut the distance between us to no more than ten yards.Given unlimited distance, I could likely catch him, but I didnt have that luxury; the prison wall loomed less than a mile ahead.Much closer, and we would be seen from the walls.I pulled up and slid off.Battle trained or not, I didnt know what the horse would do if I fired a pistol from his back.Even if he stood like a statue, I didnt think my own aim was up to it.I knelt in the snow, bracing my elbow on my knee, the gun across my forearm as Jamie had shown me.Brace it here, aim there, fire it here, he had said.I did.Much to my amazement, I hit the fleeing horse.It went into a skid, went to one knee and rolled in a flurry of snow and legs.My arm was numb from the pistols recoil; I stood rubbing it, watching the fallen soldier.He was injured; he struggled to rise, then fell back in the snow.His horse, bleeding from the shoulder, stumbled away, reins dangling.I didnt realize until later what I had been thinking, but I knew when I approached him that I could not let him live.Near as we were to the prison, and with other patrols out seeking escaped prisoners, he was sure to be found before too long.And if he were found alive, he could not only describe usso much for our hostage story in that case!but tell which way we were traveling.We had still three miles to go to the coast; two hours travel in the heavy snow.And a boat to find, once there.I simply could not take the chance of allowing him to tell anyone about us.He struggled to his elbows as I approached.His eyes widened in surprise as he saw me, then relaxed.I was a woman.He wasnt afraid of me.A more experienced man might have been apprehensive, my sex notwithstanding, but this was a boy.No more than sixteen, I thought, with a sense of sick shock.His spotty cheeks still held the last round curves of childhood, though his upper lip sported the fuzz of a hopeful mustache.He opened his mouth, but only groaned in pain.He pressed his hand to his side, and I could see blood soaking through his tunic and coat.Internal injuries, then; the horse must have rolled on him.It was possible, I thought, that he would die in any case.But that wasnt something I could count on.The dirk in my right hand was hidden under my cloak.I laid my left hand on his head.Just so I had touched the heads of hundreds of men, comforting, examining, steadying them for whatever lay ahead.And they had looked up at me much as this boy did; with hope and trust.I couldnt cut his throat.I sank to my knees beside him, and turned his head gently away from me.Ruperts techniques for swift killing had all assumed resistance.There was no resistance as I bent his head forward, as far as I could, and plunged the dirk into his neck at the base of his skull.I left him lying facedown in the snow and went to join the others.* * *    Our unwieldy cargo stowed under blankets on a bench below, Murtagh and I met on the Cristabels deck to survey the storm tossed skies.Looks like a fair, steady wind, I said hopefully, holding a wet finger aloft.Murtagh gloomily scanned the clouds, hanging black bellied over the harbor, their freight of snow wastefully melting into the frigid waves.Aye, well.Well hope for a smooth crossing.If not, well likely get there wi a corpse on our hands.Half an hour later, launched on the choppy waters of the English Channel, I discovered what he had meant by this remark.Seasick?I said incredulously.Scotsmen arent seasick!Murtagh was testy.Then mayhap hes a red heided Hottentot.All I know is hes green as a rotten fish and pukin his guts out.Are ye goin to come down and help me stop him puttin his ribs out through his chest?Damn it, I said to Murtagh, as we hung over the rail for fresh air during a brief hiatus in the unpleasantness belowdecks, if he knows hes seasick, why in the name of God did he insist on a boat?The basilisk stare was unwinking.Because he knows bluidy well wed never make it overland wi him in the state hes in, and hed no stay at Eldridge for fear o bringin the English down on MacRannoch.So hes going to kill himself quietly at sea, instead, I said bitterly.Aye.He figures this way hell only kill himself, and no take anyone else along wi him.Unselfish, see.Nothin quiet about it, though, added Murtagh, heading for the companionway in response to unmistakable sounds from below.Congratulations, I said to Jamie an hour or two later, pushing dank wisps away from my cheeks and forehead.I believe youre going to make medical history by being the only documented person ever actually to die of seasickness.Oh, good, he mumbled into the wreck of pillows and blankets, Id hate to think it was all a waste.He heaved himself suddenly to one side.God, here it comes again.Murtagh and I sprang once more to our stations.The job of holding a large man immobile while he succumbs to merciless spasms of retching is not one for the weak.Afterward, I took his pulse yet again, and rested a hand briefly on the clammy forehead.Murtagh read my face, and followed me unspeaking up the gangway to the top deck.Hes no doin verra weel, is he?he said quietly.I dont know, I said helplessly, shaking out my sweat drenched hair in the sharp wind.Ive honestly never heard of anyone dying of seasickness, but hes bringing up blood now.The little mans hands tightened on the rail, knuckles knifing through the sun speckled skin.I dont know if hes damaged himself internally with the sharp rib ends, or if its just that his stomach is raw with the vomiting.Either way, its not a good sign.And his pulse is much weaker, and irregular.Its a strain on his heart, you know.Hes a heart like a lion.It was quietly said, and I wasnt sure Id heard it at first.It might only have been the salt wind making the tears stand in his eyes.He turned abruptly to me.And a heid like an ox.Have ye any o that laudanum left that Lady Annabelle gave ye?Yes, all of it.He wouldnt take it; doesnt want to sleep, he said.Aye, well.For most folk, what they want and what they get are no the same thing; I dinna see why he should be any different.Come on.I followed him anxiously back belowdecks.I dont think he can keep it down.Leave that to me.Get the bottle and help me sit him up.Jamie was half unconscious as it was, an unwieldy burden who protested being manhandled upright against the bulkhead.Im going to die, he said weakly but precisely, and the sooner the better.Go away and let me do it in peace.Taking firm hold of Jamies blazing hair, Murtagh forced his head up and applied the flask to his lips.Swallow this, me bonny wee dormouse, or Ill break yer neck.And forbye yell keep it down, too.Im goin to hold shut yer nose and yer mouth; if ye bring it up, it comes out yer ears.By the concerted force of our wills, we transferred the contents of the flask slowly but inexorably into the young laird of Lallybroch.Choking and gagging, Jamie manfully drank as much as he could manage before subsiding, green faced and gasping, against the bulkhead.Murtagh forestalled each threatened explosion of nausea by vicious nose pinching, an expedient not uniformly successful, but one which allowed a gradual accumulation of the opiate in the patients bloodstream.At length we laid him slack on the bed, the vivid flames of hair, brows, and lashes the only color on the pillow.Murtagh came up beside me on deck a bit later.Look, I said pointing.The dim light of sunset, shining in fugitive rays beneath the clouds, gilded the rocks of the French coast ahead.The master says well be ashore in three or four hours.And not before time, said my companion, wiping lank brown hair out of his eyes.He turned to me, and gave me the closest thing I had ever seen to a smile on his dour countenance.And so at length, following the prostrate body of our charge, laid on a board between two stout monks, we passed through the looming gates of the Abbey of Ste.Anne de Beaupr.38    THE ABBEY    The abbey was an enormous twelfth century edifice, walled to resist both the smashing of sea storms and the onslaughts of land based invaders.Now, in more peaceful times, its gates stood open to allow easy traffic with the nearby village, and the small stone cells of its guest wing had been softened by the addition of tapestries and comfortable furniture.I rose from the padded chair in my own chamber, not sure exactly how one greeted an abbot; did one kneel and kiss his ring, or was that only for Popes?I settled for a respectful curtsy.Jamies slanted cat eyes did come from the Fraser side.Likewise the solid jaw, though the one facing me was somewhat obscured by black beard.Abbot Alexander had his nephews wide mouth as well, though he looked as though he smiled somewhat less with it.The slanted blue eyes remained cool and speculative as he greeted me with a pleasant, warm smile.He was a good deal shorter than Jamie, about my height, and stocky.He wore the robe of a priest, but walked with a warriors stride.I thought it likely he had been both in his time.You are welcome, ma nice, he said, inclining his head.I was a little startled at the greeting, but bowed back.Im grateful for your hospitality, I said, meaning it.Havehave you seen Jamie?The monks had taken Jamie away to be bathed, a process in which I thought I had better not assist.The Abbot nodded.Oh, aye, he said, a faint Scots accent showing through the cultured English.Ive seen him.Ive set Brother Ambrose to tend his wounds.I must have looked dubious at this, for he said, a bit dryly, Do not worry, Madame; Brother Ambrose is most competent.He looked me over with an air of frank appraisal disturbingly like that of his nephew.Murtagh said that you are an accomplished physician yourself.I am, I said bluntly.This provoked a real smile.I see that you do not suffer from the sin of false modesty, he observed.I have others, I said, smiling back.So do we all, he said.Brother Ambrose will be eager to converse with you, Im sure.Has Murtagh told youwhat happened?I asked hesitantly.The wide mouth tightened.He has.So far as he knows what happened.He waited, as though expecting further contributions from me, but I stayed silent.It was clear that he would have liked to ask questions, but he was kind enough not to press me.Instead, he raised his hand in a gesture of benediction and dismissal.You are welcome, he said once more.I will send a serving brother to bring you some food.He looked me over once more.And some facilities for washing.He made the sign of the Cross over me, in farewell or possibly as an exorcism of filth, and left in a swirl of brown skirts.Suddenly realizing how tired I was, I sank down on the bed, wondering whether I could stay awake long enough to both eat and wash.I was still wondering when my head hit the pillow.* * *    I was having a dreadful nightmare.Jamie was on the other side of a solid stone wall without a door.I could hear him screaming, over and over, but couldnt reach him.I pounded desperately on the wall, only to see my hands sink into the stone as if it were water.Ouch!I sat up in the narrow cot, clutching the hand I had smashed against the unyielding wall next to my bed.I rocked back and forth, squeezing the throbbing hand between my thighs, then realized that the screaming was still going on.It stopped abruptly as I ran into the hall.The door to Jamies room was open, flickering lamplight flooding the corridor.A monk I had not seen before was with Jamie, holding him tightly.A seepage of fresh blood stained the bandages on Jamies back, and his shoulders shook as though with chill.A nightmare, the monk said in explanation, seeing me in the doorway.He relinquished Jamie into my arms, and went to the table for a cloth and the water jug.Jamie was still trembling, and his face was glossy with sweat.His eyes were closed, and he breathed heavily, with a hoarse, gasping sound.The monk sat down beside me and began to swab his face with a gentle hand, smoothing the heavy, wet hair away from his temples.You would be his wife, of course, he said to me.I think hell be better presently.The trembling did begin to ease within a minute or two, and Jamie opened his eyes with a sigh.Im all right, he said.Claire, Im all right, now.But for Gods sake, get rid of that stink!It was only then that I consciously noticed the scent in the rooma light, spicy, floral smell, so common a perfume that I had thought nothing of it.Lavender.A scent for soaps and toilet waters.I had last smelled it in the dungeons of Wentworth Prison, where it anointed the linen or the person of Captain Jonathan Randall.The source of the scent was a small metal cup filled with herb scented oil, suspended from a heavy, rose bossed iron base and hung over a candle flame.Meant to soothe the mind, its effects were plainly not as intended.Jamie was breathing more easily, sitting up by himself and holding the cup of water the monk had given him.But his face was still white, and the corner of his mouth twitched uneasily.I nodded at the Franciscan to do as he said, and the monk quickly muffled the hot cup of oil in a folded towel, then carried it away down the hall.Jamie heaved a long sigh of relief, then winced, ribs hurting.Youve opened up your back a bit, I said, turning him slightly to get at the bandages.Not bad, though.I know.I must have rolled onto my back in my sleep.The thick wedge of folded blanket meant to keep him propped on one side had slipped to the floor.I retrieved it and laid it on the bed beside him.Thats what made me dream, I think.I dreamt of being flogged.He shuddered, took a sip of the water, then handed me the cup.I need something a bit stronger, if its handy.As though on cue, our helpful visitor came through the door with a jug of wine in one hand and a small flask of poppy syrup in the other.Alcohol or opium?he asked Jamie with a smile, holding up the two flasks.You may have your choice of oblivions.Ill have the wine, if ye please.Ive had enough of dreams for one night, Jamie said, with a lopsided answering smile.He drank the wine slowly, as the Franciscan helped me to change the stained bandages, smoothing fresh marigold ointment over the wounds.Not until I had resettled Jamie for sleep, back firmly propped and coverlet drawn up, did the visitor turn to go.Passing the bed, he bent over Jamie and sketched the sign of the Cross above his head.Rest well, he said.Thank ye, Father.Jamie answered drowsily, clearly half asleep already.Seeing that Jamie would likely not need me now until morning, I touched him on the shoulder in farewell and followed the visitor out into the corridor.Thank you, I said.Im most grateful for your help.The monk waved a graceful hand, dismissing my thanks.I was pleased to be able to assist you, he said, and I noticed that he spoke excellent English, though with a faint French accent.I was passing through the guest wing on my way to the chapel of St.Giles when I heard the screaming.I winced at the memory of that screaming, hoarse and dreadful, and hoped I would not hear it again.Glancing at the window at the end of the corridor, I saw no sign of dawn behind the shutter.To the chapel?I said, surprised.But I thought Matins were sung in the main church.And its surely a bit early, in any case.The Franciscan smiled.He was fairly young, perhaps in his early thirties, but his silky brown hair was threaded with grey.It was short and neatly tonsured and he had a brown beard, finely trimmed to a point that just skimmed the deep rolled collar of his habit.Very early, for Matins, he agreed.I was on my way to the chapel because it is my turn for the perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament at this hour.He glanced back into Jamies room, where a clock candle marked the time as half past two.Im very late, he said.Brother Bartolome will be wanting his bed.Raising his hand, he quickly blessed me, turned on a sandaled heel, and was through the swinging door at the end of the corridor before I could muster wits enough to ask his name.I stepped into the room and bent to check Jamie.He was asleep again, breathing lightly, with a slight frown creasing his brow.Experimentally, I ran my hand lightly over his hair.The frown eased a bit, and then resumed.I sighed and tucked the blankets more securely around him.* * *    I felt much better in the morning, but Jamie was hollow eyed and queasy after the broken night.He emphatically rejected any suggestion of caudle or broth for breakfast, and snapped irritably at me when I tried to check the dressings on his hand.For Christs sake, Claire, will ye no leave me alone!I dinna want to be poked at any more!He yanked his hand away, scowling.I turned away without speaking and went to busy myself with tidying the small pots and packets of medicines on the side table.I arranged them into small groups, sorted by function: marigold ointment and poplar balm for soothing, willowbark, cherry bark and chamomile for teas, St.Johns wort, garlic, and yarrow for disinfection.Claire.I turned back, to find him sitting on the bed, looking at me with a shamefaced smile.Im sorry, Sassenach.My bowels are griping, and Ive a damn evil temper this morning.But Ive no call to snarl at ye.Dye forgive me?I crossed to him swiftly and hugged him lightly.You know theres nothing to forgive.But what do you mean, your bowels are griping?Not for the first time, I reflected that intimacy and romance are not synonymous.He grimaced, bending forward slightly and folding his arms over his abdomen.It means, he said, that Id like ye to leave me to myself for a bit.If ye dinna mind?I hastily complied with his request, and went to find my own breakfast.Returning from the refectory a bit later, I spotted a trim figure in the black robes of a Franciscan, crossing the courtyard toward the cloister.I hurried to catch up with him.Father!I called, and he turned, smiling when he saw me.Good morning, he said.Madame Fraser; is that the name?And how is your husband this morning?Better, I said, hoping it was true.I wanted to thank you again for last night.You left before I could even ask your name.Clear hazel eyes sparkled as he bowed to me, hand over his heart.Franois Anselm Mericoeur dArmagnac, Madame, he said.Or so I was born.Known now only as Father Anselm.Anselm of the Merry Heart?I asked, smiling.He shrugged, a completely Gallic gesture, unchanged for centuries.One tries, he said, with an ironic twist of the mouth.I dont wish to keep you, I said, glancing toward the cloister.I only wanted to thank you for your help.You do not detain me in the least, Madame.I was delaying going to my work, in fact; indulging most sinfully in idleness.What is your work?I asked, intrigued.Plainly this man was a visitor to the monastery, his black Franciscan robes conspicuous as an inkblot among the brown of the Benedictines.There were several such visitors, or so Brother Polydore, one of the serving brothers, had told me.Most of them were scholars, here to consult the works stored in the abbeys renowned library.Anselm, it seemed, was one of these.He was, as he had been for several months, engaged in the translation of several works by Herodotus.Have you seen the library?he asked.Come, then, he said, seeing me shake my head.It is really most impressive, and I am sure the Abbot your uncle would have no objection.I was both curious to see the library, and reluctant to go back at once to the isolation of the guest wing, so I followed him without hesitation.The library was beautiful, high roofed, with soaring Gothic columns that joined in ogives in the multichambered roof.Full length windows filled the spaces between columns, letting an abundance of light into the library.Most were of clear glass, but some had deceptively simple looking stained glass parables.Tiptoeing past the bent forms of studying monks, I paused to admire one of the Flight into Egypt.Some of the bookshelves looked like those I was used to, the books nestling side by side.Other shelves held the books laid flat, to protect the ancient covers.There was even one glass fronted bookshelf holding a number of rolled parchments.Overall, the library held a hushed exultation, as though the cherished volumes were all singing soundlessly within their covers.I left the library feeling soothed, and strolled slowly across the main courtyard with Father Anselm.I tried again to thank him for his help the night before, but he shrugged off my thanks.Think nothing of it, my child.I hope that your husband is better today?So do I, I said.Not wanting to dwell on that subject, I asked, What exactly is perpetual adoration?You said that was where you were going last night.You are not a Catholic?he asked in surprise.Ah, but I forgot, you are English.So of course, I suppose you would be Protestant.Im not sure that Im either one, in terms of belief, I said.But technically, at least, I suppose I am a Catholic.Technically?The smooth eyebrows shot up in astonishment.I hesitated, cautious after my experiences with Father Bain, but this man did not seem the sort to start waving crucifixes in my face.Well, I said, bending to pull a small weed from between the paving stones, I was baptized as a Catholic.But my parents died when I was five, and I went to live with an uncle.Uncle Lambert was I paused, recalling Uncle Lamberts voracious appetite for knowledge, and that cheerfully objective cynicism that regarded all religion merely as one of the earmarks by which a culture could be cataloged.Well, he was everything and nothing, I suppose, in terms of faith, I concluded.Knew them all, believed in none.So nothing further was ever done about my religious training.And myfirst husband was Catholic, but not very observant, Im afraid.So I suppose Im really rather a heathen.I eyed him warily, but rather than being shocked by this revelation, he laughed heartily.Everything and nothing, he said, savoring the phrase.I like that very much.But as for you, I am afraid not.Once a member of Holy Mother Church, you are eternally marked as her child.However little you know about your faith, you are as much a Catholic as our Holy Father the Pope.He glanced at the sky.It was cloudy, but the leaves of the alder bushes near the church hung still.The wind has dropped.I was going for a short stroll to clear my brain in the fresh air.Why do you not accompany me?You need air and exercise, and I can perhaps make the occasion spiritually beneficial as well, by enlightening you as to the ritual of Perpetual Adoration as we go.Three birds with one stone, eh?I said dryly.But the prospect of air, if not light, was enticing, and I went to fetch my cloak without demur.With a glance at the form within, head bent in prayer, Anselm led me past the quiet darkness of the chapel entrance and down the cloister, out to the edge of the garden.Beyond the possibility of disturbing the monks within the chapel, he said, Its a very simple idea.You recall the Bible, and the story of Gethsemane, where Our Lord waited out the hours before his trial and crucifixion, and his friends, who should have borne him company, all fell fast asleep?Oh, I said, understanding all at once.And he said Can you not watch with me one hour?So thats what youre doingwatching with him for that hourto make up for it.I liked the idea, and the darkness of the chapel suddenly seemed inhabited and comforting.Oui, madame, he agreed.Very simple.We take it in turns to watch, and the Blessed Sacrament on the altar here is never left alone.Isnt it difficult, staying awake?I asked curiously.Or do you always watch at night?He nodded, a light breeze lifting the silky brown hair.The patch of his tonsure needed shaving; short bristly hairs covered it like moss.Each watcher chooses the time that suits him best.For me, that is two oclock in the morning.He glanced at me, hesitating, as though wondering how I would take what he was about to say.For me, in that moment He paused.Its as though time has stopped.All the humors of the body, all the blood and bile and vapors that make a man; its as though just at once all of them are working in perfect harmony.He smiled.His teeth were slightly crooked, the only defect in his otherwise perfect appearance.Or as though theyve stopped altogether.I often wonder whether that moment is the same as the moment of birth, or of death.I know that its timing is different for each manor woman, I suppose, he added, with a courteous nod to me.But just then, for that fraction of time, it seems as though all things are possible.You can look across the limitations of your own life, and see that they are really nothing.In that moment when time stops, it is as though you know you could undertake any venture, complete it and come back to yourself, to find the world unchanged, and everything just as you left it a moment before.And its as though He hesitated for a moment, carefully choosing words.As though, knowing that everything is possible, suddenly nothing is necessary.Butdo you actually do anything?I asked.Er, pray, I mean?I?Well, he said slowly, I sit, and I look at Him.A wide smile stretched the fine drawn lips.And He looks at me.* * *    Jamie was sitting up when I returned to the room, and essayed a short trip up and down the hall, leaning on my shoulder.But the effort left him pale and sweating, and he lay down without protest when I turned back the coverlet for him.I offered him a little broth and milk, but he shook his head wearily.Ive no appetite, Sassenach.If I take anything, I think I shall be sick again.I didnt press the matter, but took the broth away in silence.At dinner I was more insistent, and succeeded in persuading him to try a few spoonsful of soup.He managed quite a bit of it, but didnt manage to keep it down.Im sorry, Sassenach, he said, afterward.Im disgusting.It doesnt matter, Jamie, and you are not disgusting.I set the basin outside the door and sat down beside him, smoothing back the tumbled hair from his brow.Dont worry.Its only that your stomach is still irritated from the seasickness.Perhaps Ive pushed you too fast to eat.Let it rest and heal.He closed his eyes, sighing under my hand.Ill be all right, he said, without interest.What did ye do today, Sassenach?He was obviously restless and uncomfortable, but eased a bit as I told him about my explorations of the day; the library, the chapel, the winepress, and finally, the herb garden, where I had at last met the famous Brother Ambrose.Hes amazing, I said enthusiastically.Oh, but I forgot, youve met him.Brother Ambrose was talleven taller than Jamieand cadaverous, with the long, drooping face of a basset hound.And ten long, skinny fingers, every one of them bright green.He seems to be able to make anything grow, I said.Hes got all the normal herbs there, and a greenhouse so tiny that he cant even stand up straight inside it, with things that shouldnt grow at this season, or shouldnt grow in this part of the world, or just shouldnt grow.Not to mention the imported spices and drugs.The mention of drugs reminded me of the night before, and I glanced out the window.The winter twilight set in early, and it was already full dark outside, the lanterns of the monks who tended the stables and outdoor work bobbing to and fro as they passed on their rounds.Its getting dark.Do you think you can sleep by yourself?Brother Ambrose has a few things that might help.His eyes were smudged with tiredness, but he shook his head.No, Sassenach.I dinna want anything.If I fall asleepno, I think Ill read for a bit.Anselm had brought him a selection of philosophical and historical works from the library, and he stretched out a hand for a copy of Tacitus that lay on the table.You need sleep, Jamie, I said gently, watching him.He opened the book before him, propped on the pillow, but continued to stare at the wall above it.I didna tell ye what I dreamed, he said suddenly.You said you dreamed of being flogged.I didnt like the look on his face; already pale under the bruises, it was lightly sheened with dampness.Thats right.I could look up and see the ropes, cutting into my wrists.My hands had gone almost black, and the rope scraped bone when I moved.I had my face pressed against the post.Then I could feel the lead plummets at the ends of the lashes, cutting through the flesh of my shoulders.The lashes kept coming, long past when they should have stopped, and I realized that he didnt mean to stop.The tips of the cords were biting out small chunks of my flesh.The bloodmy blood was running down my sides and my back, soaking into my kilt.I was very cold.Then I looked up again, and I could see that the flesh had begun to fall away from my hands, and the bones of my fingers were scrabbling at the wood, leaving long raw scratches behind.The bones of my arms were bare, and only the ropes were holding them together.I think thats when I began to scream.I could hear a strange rattling noise when he hit me, and after a time I realized what it was.Hed stripped all the flesh off my bones, and the plummets of the whip were rattling on my dry rib bones.And I knew that I was dead, but it didnt matter.He would go on and on, and it would never stop, he would go on until I began to fall to pieces and crumble away from the post, and it would never stop, and  I moved to take hold of him and make him hush, but he had already stopped himself, gripping the edge of the book with his good hand.His teeth were set hard in the torn flesh of his lower lip.Jamie, Ill stay with you tonight, I said.I can lay a pallet on the floor.No.Weak as he was, there was no mistaking the basic stubbornness.Ill do best alone.And Im not sleepy now.Do ye go and find your own supper, Sassenach.Illjust read for a bit.He bent his head over the page.After a minute of helplessly watching him, I did as he said, and left.* * *    I was becoming more and more worried by Jamies condition.The nausea lingered; he ate almost nothing, and what he did eat seldom stayed with him.He grew paler and more listless, showing little interest in anything.He slept a great deal in the daytime, because of sleeping so little at night.Still, whatever his fears of dreaming, he would not allow me to share his chamber, so that his wakefulness need not impair my own rest.Not wishing to hover over him, even if he would have allowed it, I spent much of my time in the herbarium or the drying shed with Brother Ambrose, or wandering idly through the Abbeys grounds, engaged in conversation with Father Anselm.He took the opportunity to engage in a gentle catechism, trying to instruct me in the basics of Catholicism, though I had assured him over and over of my basic agnosticism.Ma chre, he said at last, do you recall the conditions necessary for the commission of sin that I told you yesterday?There was nothing wrong with my memory, whatever my moral shortcomings might be.First, that it be wrong, and secondly, that you give full consent to it, I parroted.That you give full consent to it, he repeated.And that, ma chre, is the condition for grace to occur, as well.We were leaning on the fence of the abbey pigsty, watching several large brown hogs huddling together in the weak winter sun.He turned his head, resting his face on his forearms, folded on the fence rail.I dont see how I can, I protested.Surely grace is something you have or you dont.I meanI hesitated, not wishing to seem rudeto you, the thing on the altar in the chapel is God.To me, its a bit of bread, no matter how lovely the holder its in.He sighed with impatience and straightened up, stretching his back.I have observed, on my way to my nightly watch, that your husband does not sleep well, he said.And consequently, neither do you.Since you are not asleep in any case, I invite you to come with me tonight.Join me in the chapel for an hour.I eyed him narrowly.Why?He shrugged.Why not?* * *    I had no difficulty in waking up for my appointment with Anselm, largely because I had not been asleep.Neither had Jamie.Whenever I poked my head out into the corridor, I could see the flicker of candlelight from the half open door of his room, and hear the flip of pages and the occasional grunt of discomfort as he shifted his position.Unable to rest, I had not bothered to undress, and so was ready when a tap at my door announced Anselms presence.The monastery was quiet, in the way that all large institutions grow quiet at night; the rapid pulse of the days activities has dropped, but the heartbeat goes on, slower, softer, but unending.There is always someone awake, moving quietly through the halls, keeping watch, keeping things alive.And now it was my turn to join the watch.The chapel was dark except for the burning of the red sanctuary lamp and a few of the clear white votive candles, flames rising straight in still air before the shadowed shrines of saints.I followed Anselm down the short center aisle, genuflecting in his wake.The slight figure of Brother Bartolome knelt toward the front, head bowed.He didnt turn at the faint noise of our entrance, but stayed motionless, bent in adoration.The Sacrament itself was almost obscured by the magnificence of its container.The huge monstrance, a sunburst of gold more than a foot across, sat serenely on the altar, guarding the humble bit of bread at its center.Feeling somewhat awkward, I took the seat Anselm indicated, near the front of the chapel.The seats, ornately carved with angels, flowers, and demons, folded up against the wooden panels of the backing to allow easy passage in and out.I heard the faint creak of a lowered seat behind me, as Anselm found his place.But what shall I do?I had asked him, voice lowered in respect of night and silence as we had approached the chapel.Nothing, ma chre, he had replied, simply.Only be.So I sat, listening to my own breathing, and the tiny sounds of a silent place; the inaudible things normally hidden in other sounds.The settling of stone, the creak of wood.The hissing of the tiny, unquenchable flames.A faint skitter of some small creature, wandered from its place into the home of majesty.It was a peaceful place, I would grant Anselm that.In spite of my own fatigue and my worry over Jamie, I gradually felt myself relaxing, the tightness of my mind gently unwinding, like the relaxation of a clock spring.Strangely, I didnt feel at all sleepy, despite the lateness of the hour and the strains of the last few days and weeks.After all, I thought, what were days and weeks in the presence of eternity?And thats what this was, to Anselm and Bartolome, to Ambrose, to all the monks, up to and including the formidable Abbot Alexander.It was in a way a comforting idea; if there was all the time in the world, then the happenings of a given moment became less important.I could see, perhaps, how one could draw back a little, seek some respite in the contemplation of an endless Being, whatever one conceived its nature to be.The red of the sanctuary lamp burned steadily, reflected in the smooth gold.The flames of the white candles before the statues of St.Giles and the Blessed Mother flickered and jumped occasionally, as the burning wicks yielded an occasional imperfection, a momentary sputter of wax or moisture.But the red lamp burned serene, with no unseemly waver to betray its light.And if there was eternity, or even the idea of it, then perhaps Anselm was right; all things were possible.And all love?I wondered.I had loved Frank; I still did.And I loved Jamie, more than my own life.But bound in the limits of time and flesh, I could not keep them both.Beyond, perhaps?Was there a place where time no longer existed, or where it stopped?Anselm thought so.A place where all things were possible.And none were necessary.And was there love there?Beyond the limits of flesh and time, was all love possible?Was it necessary?The voice of my thoughts seemed to be Uncle Lambs.My family, and all I knew of love as a child.A man who had never spoken love to me, who had never needed to, for I knew he loved me, as surely as I knew I lived.For where all love is, the speaking is unnecessary.It is all.It is undying.And it is enough.Time passed without my awareness of it, and I was startled by the sudden appearance of Anselm before me, coming through the small door near the altar.Surely he had been sitting behind me?I glanced behind, to see one of the young monks whose name I didnt know genuflecting near the rear entrance.Anselm bowed low before the altar, then motioned to me with a nod toward the door.You left?I said, once outside the chapel.But I thought you werent supposed to leave the, er, the Sacrament, alone?He smiled tranquilly.I didnt, ma chre.You were there.I repressed the urge to argue that I didnt count.After all, I supposed, there was no such thing as a Qualified Official Adorer.You only had to be human, and I imagined I was still that, though I barely felt it at times.Jamies candle still burned as I passed his door, and I caught the rustle of turning pages.I would have stopped, but Anselm went on, to leave me at the door of my own chamber.I paused there to bid him good night, and to thank him for taking me to the chapel.It wasrestful, I said, struggling to find the right word.He nodded, watching me.Oui, madame.It is.As I turned to go, he said, I told you that the Blessed Sacrament was not alone, for you were there.But what of you, ma chre?Were you alone?I stopped, and looked at him for a moment before answering.No, I said.I wasnt.39    TO RANSOM A MANS SOUL    In the morning, I went as usual to check Jamie, hoping that he had managed some breakfast.Just short of his room, Murtagh slid out of a wall alcove, barring my way.What is it?I said abruptly.Whats wrong?My heart began to beat faster and my palms were suddenly wet.My panic must have been obvious, for Murtagh shook his head in reassurance.Nay, hes all right.He shrugged, Or as much all right as hes been.He turned me with a light hand under the elbow and began to walk me back down the corridor.I thought with a moments shock that this was the first time Murtagh had ever deliberately touched me; his hand on my arm was light and strong as a pelicans wing.Whats the matter with him?I demanded.The little mans seamed face was as expressionless as usual, but the crinkled eyelids twitched at the corners.He doesna want to see ye just yet, he said.I stopped dead and pulled my arm from his grasp.Why not?I demanded.Murtagh hesitated, as though choosing his words carefully.Weel, its justhes decided as it would be best for ye to leave him here and go back to Scotland.He  The rest of what he was saying was lost as I pushed my way rudely past him.The heavy door swung shut with a soft thump behind me.Jamie was dozing, facedown on the bed.He was uncovered, clad only in a novices short gown; the charcoal brazier in the corner made the room comfortably warm, if smoky.He started violently when I touched him.His eyes, still glazed with sleep, were sunk deep and his face was haunted by dreams.I took his hand between both of mine, but he wrenched it away.With a look of near despair, he shut his eyes and buried his face in the pillow.Trying not to exhibit any outward sign of disturbance, I quietly pulled up a stool and sat down near his head.I wont touch you, I said, but you must talk to me.I waited for several minutes while he lay unmoving, shoulders hunched defensively.At last he sighed and sat up, moving slowly and painfully, swinging his legs over the edge of the cot.Aye, he said flatly, not looking at me, aye, I suppose I must.I should have done so beforebut I was coward enough to hope I need not.His voice was bitter and he kept his head bowed, hands clasped loosely around his knees.I didna used to think myself a coward, but I am.I should have made Randall kill me, but I did not.I had no reason to live, but I was not brave enough to die.His voice dropped, and he spoke so softly I could hardly hear him.And I knew I would have to see you one last timeto tell youbutClaire, my loveoh, my love.He picked up the pillow from the bed and hugged it to him as though for protection, a substitute for the comfort he could not seek from me.He rested his forehead on it for a moment, gathering strength.When ye left me there at Wentworth, Claire, he said quietly, head still bowed, I listened to your footsteps, going away on the flags outside, and I said to myself, Ill think of her now.Ill remember her; the feel of her skin and the scent of her hair and the touch of her mouth on mine.Ill think of her until that door opens again.And Ill think of her tomorrow, when I stand on the gallows, to give me courage at the last.Between the time the door opens, and the time I leave this place to diethe big hands clenched briefly and relaxedI will not think at all, he finished softly.In the small dungeon room, he had closed his eyes and sat waiting.The pain was not bad, so long as he sat still, but he knew it would grow worse soon.Fearing pain, still he had dealt with it often before.He knew it and his own response to it well enough that he was resigned to endurance, hoping only that it would not exceed his strength too soon.The prospect of physical violation, too, was only a matter of mild revulsion now.Despair was in its own way an anesthetic.There was no window in the room by which to judge the time.It had been late afternoon when he was brought to the dungeon, but his sense of time was unreliable.How many hours could it be until dawn?Six, eight, ten?Until the end of everything.He thought with grim humor that Randall at least had done him the favor of rendering death welcome.When the door opened, he had looked up, expectingwhat?There was only a man, slightly built, handsome, and a little disheveled, linen shirt torn and hair disarranged, leaning against the wood of the door, watching him.After a moment, Randall had crossed the room unspeaking and stood beside him.He rested a hand briefly on Jamies neck, then bent and freed the trapped hand with a jerk of the nail that brought Jamie to the edge of fainting.A glass of brandy was set before him, and a firm hand raised his head and helped him to drink it.He lifted my face then, between his hands, and he licked the drops of brandy from my lips.I wanted to pull back from him, but Id given my word, so I just sat still.Randall had held Jamies head for a moment, looking searchingly into his eyes, then released him and sat down on the table next to him.He sat there for quite a time, not saying anything, just swinging one leg back and forth.I had no idea what he wanted, and wasnt disposed to guess.I was tired and feeling a bit sick from the pain in my hand.So after a time I just laid my head down on my arms and turned my face away.He sighed heavily.After a moment, I could feel a hand on my head, but I didnt move.He began to stroke my hair, very gently, over and over.There wasnt any sound but the big fellows hoarse breathing and the crackle of the fire in the brazier, and I thinkI think I went to sleep for a few moments.When he woke, Randall was standing in front of him.Are you feeling a bit better?Randall had asked in a remote, courteous tone.Wordless, Jamie had nodded, and stood up.Randall had stripped him, careful of the wounded hand, and led him to the bed.Id given my word not to struggle, but I did not mean to help, either, so I just stood, as though I were made of wood.I thought I would let him do as he liked, but Id take no part in itI would keep a distance from him, in my mind at least.Randall had smiled then, and gripped Jamies right hand, hard enough to make him sink onto the bed, sick and dizzy with the sudden stab of pain.Randall had knelt then on the floor before him, and taught him, in a few shattering minutes, that distance is an illusion.When he rose up, he took the knife and drew it across my chest, from one side to the other.It was not a deep cut, but it bled a bit.He watched my face a moment, then reached out a finger and dipped it in the blood.Jamies voice was unsteady, tripping and stammering from time to time.He licked my blood off his finger, with little flicks of his tongue, like a c cat washing itself.He smiled a bit, thenvery kind, likeand bent his head to my chest.I was not bound at all, but I could not have moved.I justsat there, while he used his tongue toIt did not hurt, precisely, but it felt verra queer.After a time, he stood up and cleaned himself careful with a towel.I watched Jamies hand.With his face turned away, it was the best indicator of his feelings.It clenched convulsively on the edge of the cot as he went on.Hehe told me that.I was delicious.The cut had almost stopped bleeding, but he took the towel and scrubbed it hard over my chest to open the wound again.The knuckles of the clenched hand were knobs of bloodless bone.He unbuttoned his breeches then, and smeared the fresh blood on himself, and said it was my turn now.Afterward, Randall held his head and helped him to be sick, wiped his face gently with a wet cloth, and gave him brandy to cleanse his mouth of foulness.And so, by turns vicious and tender, bit by bit, using pain as his weapon, he had destroyed all barriers of mind and body.I wanted to stop Jamie, to tell him that he didnt need to go on, must not go on, but I bit my lip hard to keep from speaking and clasped my own hands tight together to keep from touching him.He told me the rest of it, then; the slow and deliberate whipstrokes, interspersed with kisses.The shocking pain of burns, administered to drag him from the brink of a desperately sought unconsciousness to face further degradations.He told me everything, with hesitations, sometimes with tears, much more than I could bear to hear, but I heard him out, silent as a confessor.He glanced quickly up at me, then away.I could have stood being hurt, no matter how bad it was.I expected to beused, and I thought I could stand that too.But I couldntIhe I dug my nails fiercely into my palms in the struggle to keep quiet.He shook soundlessly for a time, then his voice came again, thick, but desperately steady.He did not just hurt me, or use me.He made love to me, Claire.
