He looks awful happy.Did you finally give it up, Abby?Chris said, elbowing his teammates.Youre not very smart, are ya, Jenks?Shepley said, frowning.The blood instantly rose to my cheeks, and I looked to Travis who had murder in his eyes.My embarrassment took a back seat to Travis anger, and I shook my head dismissively.Just ignore him.After another tense moment, his shoulders relaxed a bit, and he nodded once, taking a deep breath.After a few seconds, he winked at me.I reached my hand across the table, sliding my fingers into his.You meant what you said last night, didnt you?He began to speak, but Chris laughter filled the cafeteria.Holy God!Travis Maddox is whipped?Did you mean it when you said you didnt want me to change?he asked, squeezing my hand.I looked down at Chris laughing to his teammates, and then turned to Travis.Absolutely.Teach that asshole some manners.A mischievous grin spread across his face, and he walked down to the end of the table where Chris sat.Silence spread across the room, and Chris swallowed back his laughter.Hey, I was just givin you a hard time, Travis, he said, looking up at him.Apologize to Pidge, Travis said, glowering down at him.Chris looked down at me with a nervous grin.II was just kidding, Abby.Im sorry.I glared at him as he looked up to Travis for approval.When Travis walked away, Chris snickered, and then whispered something to Brazil.My heart began to pound when I saw Travis stop in his tracks and ball his hands into fists at his side.Brazil shook his head and huffed in an exasperated sigh.Just remember when you wake up, Christhat you bring it on yourself.Travis lifted Finchs tray off the table and swung it into Chris face, knocking him off his chair.Chris tried to scramble under the table, but Travis pulled him out by his legs, and then began to wail on him.Chris curled into a ball, and then Travis kicked him in the back.Chris arched and turned, holding his hands out, allowing Travis to land several punches to his face.The blood began to flow, and Travis stood up, winded.If you even look at her you piece of shit, Ill break your fuckin jaw!Travis yelled.I winced when he kicked Chris in the leg one last time.The women working in the cafeteria scampered out, shocked at the bloody mess on the floor.Sorry, Travis said, wiping Chris blood from his cheek.Some of the students stood up to get a better look; others remained seated, watching with mild amusement.The football team simply stared at Chris limp body on the floor, shaking their heads.Travis turned, and Shepley stood, grabbing both my arm and Americas hand, pulling us out the door behind his cousin.We walked the short distance to Morgan Hall, and America and I sat on the front steps, watching Travis pace back and forth.You okay, Trav?Shepley asked.Justgive me a minute, he said, putting his hands low on his hips as he walked.Shepley shoved his hands in his pockets.Im surprised you stopped.Pidge said to teach him some manners, Shep, not kill him.It took everything I had to quit when I did.America slipped on her large, square sunglasses to look up at Travis.What did Chris say that set you off, anyway?Something hell never say again, Travis seethed.America looked to Shepley, who shrugged.I didnt hear it.Travis hands balled into fists again.Im goin back in there.Shepley touched Travis shoulder.Your girls out here.You dont need to go back in there.Travis looked at me, forcing himself to stay calm.He saideveryone thinks Pidge hasJesus, I cant even say it.Just say it already, America muttered, picking at her nails.Finch walked up behind Travis, clearly thrilled by all the excitement.Every straight guy at Eastern wants to try her out because she landed the unattainable Travis Maddox, he shrugged.Thats what theyre saying in there now, at least.Travis shouldered past Finch, heading for the cafeteria.Shepley bolted after him, grabbing his arm.My hands flew to my mouth when Travis swung, and Shepley ducked.My eyes darted to America who was unaffected, accustomed to their routine.I could think of only one thing to do to stop him.I scrambled off the steps, wheeling around, directly in his path.I jumped on him, wrapping my legs around his waist, and he gripped my thighs as I grabbed each side of his face, planting a long, deep kiss on his mouth.I could feel his anger melt away as he kissed me, and when I pulled away, I knew I had won.We dont care what they think, remember?You cant start now, I said, smiling with confidence.I had more of an effect on him than I ever thought possible.I cant let them talk about you like that, Pigeon, he said with a frustrated frown, lowering me to my feet.I slid my arms under his, interlocking my fingers behind his back.Like what?They think I have something special because youve never settled down before.Do you disagree?Hell no, I just cant stand the thought of every guy in this school wanting to bag you because of it.He pressed his forehead against mine.This is going to make me crazy.I can already tell.Dont let them get to you, Travis, Shepley said.You cant fight everybody.Travis sighed.Everybody.How would you feel if everybody thought about America like that?Who says they dont?America said, offended.We all laughed, and America made a face.I wasnt kidding.Shepley pulled her to her feet by her hands and kissed her cheek.We know, Baby.I gave up being jealous a long time ago.Id never have time to do anything else.America smiled in appreciation, and then hugged him.Shepley had an uncanny ability to make everyone around him feel at ease, no doubt the result from growing up around Travis and his brothers.It was probably more of a defense mechanism than anything.Travis nuzzled my ear, and I giggled until I saw Parker approach.The same sense of urgency Id felt when Travis wanted to return to the cafeteria overcame me, and I instantly let go of Travis to quickly walked the ten or so feet to intercept Parker.I need to talk to you, he said.I glanced behind me, and then shook my head as a warning.Now is not a good time, Parker.Its a really, really bad time, actually.Travis and Chris got into it at lunch, and hes still a little raw.You need to go.Parker eyed Travis, and then returned his attention to me, determined.I just heard what happened in the cafeteria.I dont think you realize what youre getting yourself into.Travis is bad news, Abby.Everyone knows it.No one is talking about how great it is that youve turned him aroundtheyre all waiting for him to do what he does best.I dont know what hes told you, but you have no clue what kind of person he is.I felt Travis hands on my shoulders.Why dont you tell her, then?Parker shifted nervously.Do you know how many humiliated girls Ive taken home from parties after theyve spent a few hours alone in a room with him?Hes going to hurt you.Travis fingers tightened in reaction, and I rested my hand on his until he relaxed.You should go, Parker.You should listen to what Im saying, Abs.Dont fucking call her that, Travis growled.Parker didnt take his eyes from mine.Im worried about you.I appreciate it, but its unnecessary.Parker shook his head.He saw you as a long term challenge, Abby.He has you thinking youre different from the other girls so he could get you in the sack.Hes going to get tired of you.He has the attention span of a toddler.Travis stepped around me, standing so close to Parker that their noses nearly touched.I let you have your say.My patience has run out.Parker tried to look at me, but Travis leaned in his way.Dont you fucking look at her.Look at me you spoiled shit stain.Parker focused on Travis eyes and waited.If you so much as breathe in her direction, Ill make sure youll be limping through med school.Parker took a few steps back until I was in his line of sight.I thought you were smarter than that, he said, shaking his head before turning away.Travis watched him leave, and then turned around, his eyes searching mine.You know thats a bunch of bullshit, right?Its not true.Im sure thats what everyone is thinking, I grumbled, noting the interest of those walking by.Then Ill prove them wrong.As the week wore on, Travis took his promise very seriously.He no longer humored the girls that stopped him on his way to and from class, and at times he was rude about it.By the time we walked into The Red for the Halloween party, I was a little nervous about how he planned to keep the intoxicated co eds away.America, Finch and I sat at a nearby table while watching Shepley and Travis play pool against two of their Sig Tau brothers.Go, Baby!America called, standing up on the rungs of her stool.Shepley winked at her and then took his shot, sinking it into the far right pocket.Wooo!she squealed.A trio of women dressed as Charlies Angels approached Travis while he waited his turn, and I smiled as he tried his best to ignore them.When one of them traced the line of one of his tattoos, Travis pulled his arm away.He waved her off so he could make a shot, and she pouted to her friends.Can you believe how ridiculous they are?The girls here are shameless, America said.Finch shook his head in awe.Its Travis.I think its the bad boy thing.They either want to save him, or think theyre immune to his wicked ways.Im not sure which.Its probably both, I laughed, giggling at the girls waiting for Travis to pay them attention.Can you imagine hoping youre the one hell pick?Knowing youll be used for sex?Daddy issues, America said, taking a sip of her drink.Finch put out his cigarette, and tugged on our dresses.Come on girls!The Finch wants to dance!Only if you promise not to call yourself that ever again, America said.Finch jutted out his bottom lip, and America smiled.Come on, Abby.You dont wanna make Finch cry, do you?We joined the policemen and vampires on the dance floor, and Finch broke out his Timberlake moves.I glanced at Travis over my shoulder and caught him watching me from the corner of his eye, pretending to watch Shepley sink the eight ball for the game.Shepley collected their winnings, and Travis walked to the long, shallow table that bordered the dance floor, taking a drink.Finch flailed about the dance floor, finally sandwiching himself between America and me.Travis rolled his eyes, chuckling as he returned to our table with Shepley.Im going to get another drink, want anything?America shouted over the music.Ill go with you, I said, looking to Finch and pointing at the bar.Finch shook his head and continued to dance.America and I shouldered through the crowd to the bar.The bartenders were overwhelmed, so we settled in for a long wait.The boys are making a killing tonight, America said.I leaned into her ear.Why anyone bets against Shep Ill never understand.For the same reason they bet against Travis.Theyre idiots, she smiled.A man in a toga leaned against the bar beside America and smiled.What are you ladies drinking this evening?We buy our own beverages, thanks, America said, facing forward.Im Mike, he said, and then pointed to his friend, This is Logan.I smiled politely, looking to America who made her best go away expression.The bartender took our order, and then nodded behind us, turning to make Americas drink.She brought over a square glass full of pink, frothy liquid, and three beers.Mike handed her some money and she nodded.This is something else, Mike said, scanning the crowd.Yeah, America said, annoyed.I saw you dancing out there, Logan said to me, nodding to the dance floor.You looked good.Uhthanks, I said, trying to remain polite, wary that Travis was just a few yards away.You wanna dance?he asked.I shook my head.No, thanks.Im here with my,  Boyfriend, Travis said, appearing out of nowhere.He glared at the men standing in front of us, and they backed away a bit, clearly intimidated.America couldnt contain her smug smile as Shepley wrapped his arm around her.Travis nodded across the room.Run along, now.The men glanced at America and me, and then took a few cautious steps backward before retreating behind the safety of the crowd.Shepley kissed America.I cant take you anywhere!She giggled, and I smiled at Travis, who was glowering down at me.What?Why did you let him buy your drink?America let go of Shepley, noticing Travis mood.We didnt, Travis.I told them not to.Travis took the bottle from my hand.Then whats this?Are you serious?I asked.Yes, Im fucking serious, he said, tossing the beer in the trashcan by the bar.Ive told you a hundred timesyou cant be taking drinks from random guys.What if he put something in it?America held up her glass.The drinks were never out of our sight, Trav.Youre overreacting.Im not talking to you, Travis said, his eyes boring into mine.Hey!I said, instantly angry.Dont talk to her like that.Travis, Shepley warned, let it go.I dont like you letting other guys buy you drinks, Travis said.I raised an eyebrow.Are you trying to pick a fight?Would it bother you to walk up to the bar and see me sharing a drink with some chick?I nodded once.Okay.Youre oblivious to all women, now.I get it.I should be making the same effort.It would be nice.He was clearly trying to subdue his temper, and it was a bit unnerving to be on the wrong side of his wrath.His eyes were still bright with anger, and an innate urge to go on the offensive bubbled to the surface.Youre going to have to tone down the jealous boyfriend thing, Travis.I didnt do anything wrong.Travis shot me an incredulous look.I walk up here, and some guy is buying you a drink!Dont yell at her!America said.Shepley put his hand on Travis shoulder.Weve all had a lot to drink.Lets just get out of here.Shepleys usually calming effect was lost on Travis, and I was instantly annoyed that his tantrum had ended our night.I have to tell Finch were leaving, I grumbled, shouldering past Travis to the dance floor.A warm hand encapsulated my wrist.I wheeled around, seeing Travis fingers locked without regret.Ill go with you.I twisted my arm from his grip.I am fully capable of walking a few feet by myself, Travis.What is wrong with you?I spied Finch in the middle, and pushed my way out to him.Were leaving!What?Finch yelled over the music.Travis is in a pissy mood!Were leaving!Finch rolled his eyes and shook his head, waving as I left the dance floor.Just as I spotted America and Shepley, I was tugged backward by a man in a pirate costume.Where do you think youre going?he smiled, bumping up against me.I laughed and shook my head at the silly face he was making.Just as I turned to walk away, he grabbed my arm.It didnt take long for me to realize he wasnt grabbing at me, he was grabbing for me  for protection.Whoa!he cried, looking beyond me with wide eyes.Travis barreled his way onto the dance floor, and plunged his fist straight into the pirates face, the force sending both of us to the ground.With my palms flat on the wooden floor, I blinked my eyes in stunned disbelief.Feeling something warm and wet on my hand, I turned it over and recoiled.It was covered in blood from the mans nose.His hand was cupped over his face, but the bright red liquid poured down his forearm as he writhed on the floor.Travis scrambled to pick me up, seeming as shocked as I was.Oh shit!Are you all right, Pidge?When I got to my feet, I yanked my arm from his grip.Are you insane?America grabbed my wrist and pulled me through the crowd to the parking lot.Shepley unlocked his doors and after I slid into my seat, Travis turned to me.Im sorry, Pigeon, I didnt know he had a hold of you.Your fist was two inches from my face!I said, catching the oil stained towel Shepley had thrown at me.I wiped the blood from my hand, revolted.The seriousness of the situation darkened his face and he winced.I wouldnt have swung if I thought I could have hit you.You know that right?Shut up, Travis.Just shut up, I said, staring at the back of Shepleys head.Pidge, Travis began.Shepley hit his steering wheel with the heel of his hand.Shut up, Travis!You said youre sorry, now shut the fuck up!The trip home was made in complete silence.Shepley pulled his seat forward to let me out of the car, and I looked to America, who nodded with understanding.She kissed her boyfriend goodnight.Ill see you tomorrow, Baby.Shep nodded in resignation and kissed her.Love you.I walked past Travis to Americas Honda, and he jogged to my side.Cmon.Dont leave mad.Oh, Im not leaving mad.Im furious.She needs some time to cool off, Travis, America warned, unlocking her door.When the passenger side lock popped, Travis held his hand against the door.Dont leave, Pigeon.I was out of line.Im sorry.I held up my hand, showing him the remnants of dried blood on my palm.Call me when you grow up.He leaned against the door with his hip.You cant leave.I raised an eyebrow, and Shepley jogged around the car beside us.Travis, youre drunk.Youre about to make a huge mistake.Just let her go home, cool offyou can both talk tomorrow when youre sober.Travis expression turned desperate.She cant leave, he said, staring into my eyes.Its not going to work, Travis, I said, tugging on the door.Move!What do you mean its not gonna work?Travis asked, grabbing my arm.I mean the sad face.Im not falling for it, I said, pulling away.Shepley watched Travis for a moment, and then turned to me.Abbythis is the moment I was talking about.Maybe you should,  Stay out of it, Shep, America snapped, starting the car.Im gonna fuck up.Im gonna fuck up a lot, Pidge, but you have to forgive me.Im going to have a huge bruise on my ass in the morning!You hit that guy because you were pissed at me!What should that tell me?Because red flags are going up all over the place right now!Ive never hit a girl in my life, he said, surprised at my words.And Im not about to be the first one!I said, tugging on the door.Move, damn it!Travis nodded, and then took a step back.I sat beside America, slamming the door.She put the car in reverse, and Travis leaned down to look at me through the window.Youre going to call me tomorrow, right?he said, touching the windshield.Just go, Mare, I said, refusing to meet his eyes.The night was long.I kept looking at the clock, and cringed when I saw that another hour had passed.I couldnt stop thinking about Travis and whether or not I would call him, wondering if he was awake as well.I finally resorted to sticking the ear buds of my iPod in my ear and listening to every loud, obnoxious song on my playlist.The last time I looked at the clock, it was after four.The birds were already chirping outside my window, and I smiled when my eyes began to feel heavy.It seemed like just a few moments later when I heard a knock at the door, and America burst through it.She pulled the ear buds from my ears and then fell into my desk chair.Mornin sunshine.You look like hell, she said, blowing a pink bubble from her mouth and then letting it smack loudly as it popped.Shut UP, America!Kara said from under her covers.You realize people like you and Trav are going to fight, right?America said, filing her nails as she chewed the huge wad of gum in her mouth.I turned over on the bed.You are officially fired.You are a terrible conscience.She laughed.I just know you.If I handed you my keys right now, youd drive straight over there.I would not!Whatever, she lilted.Its eight oclock in the morning, Mare.Theyre probably still passed out cold.Just then, I heard a faint knock on the door.Karas arm shot out from under her comforter and turned the knob.The door slowly opened, revealing Travis in the doorway.Can I come in?he asked in a low, raspy voice.The purple circles under his eyes announced his lack of sleep, if hed had any at all.I sat up in bed, startled by his exhausted appearance.Are you okay?He walked in and fell to his knees in front of me.Im so sorry, Abby.Im sorry, he said, wrapping his arms around my waist and burying his head in my lap.I cradled his head in my arms and peered up at America.Im uhIm gonna go, she said, awkwardly fumbling for the door handle.Kara rubbed her eyes and sighed, and then grabbed her shower bag.Im always very clean when youre around, Abby, she grumbled, slamming the door behind her.Travis looked up at me.I know I get crazy when it comes to you, but God knows Im tryin, Pidge.I dont wanna screw this up.Then dont.This is hard for me, ya know.I feel like any second youre going to figure out what a piece of shit I am and leave me.When you were dancing last night, I saw a dozen different guys watching you.You go to the bar, and I see you thank that guy for your drink.Then that douchebag on the dance floor grabs you.You dont see me throwing punches every time a girl talks to you.I cant stay locked up in the apartment all the time.Youre going to have to get a handle on your temper.I will.Ive never wanted a girlfriend before, Pigeon.Im not used to feeling this way about someoneabout anyone.If youll be patient with me, I swear Ill get it figured out.Lets get something straight; youre not a piece of shit, youre amazing.It doesnt matter who buys me drinks, or who asks me to dance, or who flirts with me.Im going home with you.Youve asked me to trust you, and you dont seem to trust me.He frowned.Thats not true.If you think Im going to leave you for the next guy that comes along, then you dont have much faith in me.He tightened his grip.Im not good enough for you, Pidge.That doesnt mean I dont trust you, Im just bracing for the inevitable.Dont say that.When were alone, youre perfect.Were perfect.But then you let everyone else ruin it.I dont expect a one eighty, but you have to pick your battles.You cant come out swinging every time someone looks at me.He nodded.Ill do anything you want.Justtell me you love me.You know I do.I need to hear you say it, he said, his brows pulling together.I love you, I said, touching my lips to his.Now quit being such a baby.He laughed, crawling into the bed with me.We spent the next hour in the same spot under the covers, giggling and kissing, barely noticing when Kara returned from the shower.Could you get out?I have to get dressed, Kara said to Travis, tightening her robe.Travis kissed my cheek, and then stepped into the hall.See ya in a sec.I fell against my pillow as Kara rummaged though through her closet.What are you so happy about?she grumbled.Nothing, I sighed.Do you know what co dependency is, Abby?Your boyfriend is a prime example, which is creepy considering he went from having no respect for women at all to thinking he needs you to breathe.Maybe he does, I said, refusing to let her spoil my mood.Dont you wonder why that is?I meanhes been through half the girls at this school.Why you?He says Im different.Sure he does.But why?Why do you care?I snapped.Its dangerous to need someone that much.Youre trying to save him and hes hoping you can.You two are a disaster.I smiled at the ceiling.It doesnt matter what or why it is.When its good, Karaits beautiful.She rolled her eyes.Youre hopeless.Travis knocked on the door, and Kara let him in.Im going to the commons to study.Good luck, she said in the most insincere voice she could muster.What was that about?Travis asked.She said were a disaster.Tell me something I dont know, he smiled.His eyes were suddenly focused, and he kissed the tender skin behind my ear.Why dont you come home with me?I rested my hand on the back of his neck and sighed at the feeling of his soft lips against my skin.I think Im going to stay here.Im constantly at your apartment.His head popped up.So?You dont like it there?I touched his cheek and sighed.He was so quick to worry.Of course I do, but I dont live there.He ran the tip of his nose up my neck.I want you there.I want you there every night.Im not moving in with you, I said, shaking my head.I didnt ask you to move in with me.I said I want you there.Same thing!I laughed.Travis frowned.Youre really not staying with me tonight?I shook my head, and his eyes traveled up my wall to the ceiling.I could almost see the wheels spinning inside his head.What are you up to?I asked, narrowing my eyes.Im trying to think of another bet.I flipped a tiny white pill in my mouth and swallowed, chasing it with a large glass of water.I was standing in the middle of Travis bedroom in a bra and panties, getting ready to slip into my pajamas.Whats that?Travis asked from the bed.Uhmy pill?He frowned.What pill?The pill, Travis.You have yet to replenish your top drawer and the last thing I need is to worry about whether or not Im going to get my period.Oh.One of us has to be responsible, I said, raising an eyebrow.My God youre sexy, Travis said, propping his head up with his hand.The most beautiful woman at Eastern is my girlfriend.Thats insanity.I rolled my eyes and slipped the purple silk over my head, crawling in bed beside him.I straddled his lap and kissed his neck, giggling when he let his head fall against the headboard.Again?Youre gonna kill me, Pidge.You cant die, I said, covering his face with kisses.Youre too damn mean.No, I cant die because there are too many jackasses falling over themselves to take my place!I may live forever just to spite them!I giggled against his mouth and he flipped me onto my back.His finger slid under the delicate purple ribbon tied at the crest of my shoulder and slid it down my arm, kissing the skin it left behind.Why me, Trav?He leaned back, searching my eyes.What do you mean?Youve been with all these women, refused to settle down, refuse to even take a phone number so why me?Where is this coming from?he said, his thumb caressing my cheek.I shrugged.Im just curious.Why me?You have half the men at Eastern just waiting for me to screw up.I wrinkled my nose.Thats not true.Dont change the subject.It is true.If I hadnt been chasing you from the beginning of school, youd have more than Parker Hayes following you around.Hes just too self absorbed to be scared of me.Youre avoiding my question!And poorly, I might add.Okay!Why you?A smile spread across his face and he leaned down to touch his lips to mine.I had a thing for you since the night of that first fight.What?I said with a dubious expression.Its true.You in that cardigan with blood all over you?You looked absolutely ridiculous, he chuckled.Thanks.His smiled faded.It was when you looked up at me.That was the moment.You had this wide eyed, innocent lookno pretenses.You didnt look at me like I was Travis Maddox, he said, rolling his eyes at his own words, you looked at me like I wasI dont know, a person I guess.News flash, Trav.You are a person.He brushed my bangs from my face.No, before you came, Shepley was the only one that treated me like anyone else.You didnt get all awkward, or flirt, or run your fingers through your hair.You saw me.I was a complete bitch to you, Travis.He kissed my neck.Thats what sealed the deal.I slipped my hands down his back and into his boxers.I hope this gets old soon.I dont see myself ever getting tired of you.Promise?he asked, smiling.His phone buzzed on the night table and he smiled, holding it to his ear.Yeah?Oh, hell no, I got Pidge here with me.Were just getting ready to go to bedShut the fuck up, Trent, thats not funnySeriously?Whats he doin in town?He looked at me and sighed.All right.Well be there in half an hour.You heard me, douchebag.Because I dont go anywhere without her, thats why.Do you want me to pound your face when I get there?Travis hung up and shook his head.I raised an eyebrow.That is the weirdest conversation Ive ever heard.That was Trent.Thomas is in town and its poker night at my dads.Poker night?I swallowed.Yeah, they usually take all of my money.Cheatin bastards.Im going to meet your family in thirty minutes?He looked at his watch.Twenty seven minutes to be exact.Oh my God, Travis!I wailed, jumping out of bed.What are you doing?he sighed.I rummaged through the closet and yanked on a pair of jeans, hopping up and down to pull them up, and then pulled the nightgown over my head, throwing it into Travis face.I cant believe you gave me twenty minutes notice to meet your family!I could kill you right now!He pulled my nightgown from his eyes and laughed at my desperate attempt to look presentable.I grabbed a black v neck shirt and tugged it to its proper position, and then ran to the bathroom, brushing my teeth and ripping a brush through my hair.Travis walked up behind me, fully dressed and ready, and wrapped his arms around my waist.Im a mess!I said, frowning in the mirror.Do you even realize how beautiful you are?he asked, kissing my neck.I huffed, scampering into his room to slip on a pair of heels, and then took Travis hand as he lead me to the door.I stopped, zipping up my black leather jacket and pulling my hair up into a tight bun in preparation for the blustery ride to his fathers house.Calm down, Pigeon.Its just a bunch of guys sitting around a table.This is the first time Im meeting your dad and your brothersall at the same timeand you want me to calm down?I said, climbing onto his bike behind him.He angled his neck, touching my cheek as he kissed me.Theyre going to love you, just like I do.When we arrived, I let my hair fall down my back and ran my fingers through it a few times before Travis led me through the door.Holy Christ!Its the asshat!one of the boys called.Travis nodded once.He tried to look annoyed, but I could see that he was excited to see his brothers.The house was dated, with yellow and brown faded wallpaper and shag carpet in different shades of brown.We walked down a hall to a room straight ahead with the door wide open.Smoke wafted into the hallway, and his brothers and father were seated at a round, wooden table with mismatched chairs.Hey, heywatch the language around the young lady, his dad said, the cigar in his mouth bobbing while he talked.Pidge, this is my dad, Jim Maddox.Dad, this is Pigeon.Pigeon?Jim asked, an amused expression on his face.Abby, I smiled, shaking his hand.Travis pointed to his brothers.Trenton, Taylor, Tyler, and Thomas.They all nodded, and all but Thomas looked like older versions of Travis; buzz cuts, brown eyes, their t shirts stretched over their bulging muscles, and covered in tattoos.Thomas wore a dress shirt and loosened tie, his eyes were hazel green, and his dark blonde hair was longer by about an inch.Does Abby have a last name?Jim asked.Abernathy, I nodded.Its nice to meet you, Abby, Thomas said, smiling.Really nice, Trent said, giving me an impish once over.Jim slapped the back of his head and he yelped.Whatd I say?he said, rubbing the back of his head.Have a seat, Abby.Watch us take Travs money, one of the twins said.I couldnt tell which was which; they were carbon copies of each other, even their tattoos matched.The room was peppered with vintage pictures of poker games, pictures of poker legends posing with Jim and who I assumed to be Travis grandfather, and antique playing cards along the shelves.You knew Stu Unger?I asked, pointing to a dusty photo.Jims squinty eyes brightened.You know who Stu Unger is?I nodded.My dads a fan, too.He stood up, pointing to the picture beside it.And thats Doyle Brunson, there.I smiled.My dad saw him play, once.Hes unbelievable.Travs granddaddy was a professionalwe take poker very seriously around here, Jim smiled.I sat between Travis and one of the twins while Trenton shuffled the deck with moderate skill.The boys put in their cash and Jim divvied out the chips.Trenton raised an eyebrow.You wanna play, Abby?I smiled politely and shook my head.I dont think I should.You dont know how?Jim asked.I couldnt hold back a smile.Jim looked so serious, almost paternal.I knew what answer he expected, and I hated to disappoint him.Travis kissed my forehead.PlayIll teach you.You should just kiss your money goodbye, now, Abby, Thomas laughed.I pressed my lips together and dug into my purse, pulling out two fifties.I held them out to Jim and waited patiently as he traded them for chips.Trentons mouth tightened into a smug smile, but I ignored him.I have faith in Travis teaching skills, I said.One of the twins clapped his hands together.Hells yeah!Im going to get rich tonight!Lets start small this time, Jim said, throwing in a five dollar chip.Trenton dealt, and Travis fanned out my hand for me.Have you ever played cards?Its been awhile, I nodded.Go fish doesnt count, Pollyanna, Trenton said, looking at his cards.Shut your hole, Trent, Travis said, glancing up at his brother before looking back down to my hand.Youre shooting for higher cards, consecutive numbers, and if youre really lucky, in the same suit.The first hand, Travis looked at my cards and I looked at his.I mainly nodded and smiled, playing when I was told.Both Travis and I lost, and my chips had dwindled by the end of the first round.After Thomas dealt to begin the second round, I wouldnt let Travis see my cards.I think Ive got this, I said.You sure?he asked.Im sure, Baby, I smiled.Three hands later, I had won back my chips and annihilated the stacked chips of the others with a pair of Aces, a straight, and the high card.Bullshit!Trenton whined.Beginners luck sucks!Youve got a fast learner, Trav, Jim said, moving his mouth around his cigar.Travis swigged his beer.Youre makin me proud, Pigeon!His eyes were bright with excitement, and his smile was different than Id ever seen before.Thanks, I smiled.Those that cannot do, teach, Thomas said, smirking.Very funny, asshole, Travis murmured.Four hands later, I tipped back the last of my beer and narrowed my eyes at the only man at the table that hadnt folded.The actions on you, Taylor.You gonna be a baby or you going to put in like a man?Fuck it, he said, throwing the last of his chips in.Travis looked at me, his eyes animated.It reminded me of the expressions of those watching his fights.Whatdya got, Pigeon?Taylor?I prompted.A wide grin spread across his face.Flush!he smiled, spreading his cards face up on the table.Five pairs of eyes turned to me.I scanned the table and then slammed my cards down.Read em and weep, boys!Aces and eights!I said, giggling.A full house?What the fuck?Trent cried.Sorry.Ive always wanted to say that, I said, pulling in my chips.Thomas eyes narrowed.This isnt just beginners luck.She plays.Travis eyed Thomas for a moment and then looked to me.Have you played before, Pidge?I pressed my lips together and shrugged, displaying my best innocent smile.Travis head fell back, bursting into a barrage of laughter.He tried to speak but couldnt, and then hit the table with his fist.Your girlfriend just fucking hustled us!Taylor said, pointing in my direction.NO FUCKING WAY!Trenton wailed, standing up.Good plan, Travis.Bring a card shark to poker night, Jim said, winking at me.I didnt know!he said, shaking his head.Bullshit, Thomas said, eyeing me.I didnt!he said through his laughter.I hate to say it, Bro.But I think I just fell in love with your girl, Tyler said.Hey, now, Travis said, his smile quickly fading into a grimace.Thats it.I was going easy on you, Abby, but Im winning my money back, now, Trenton warned.Travis sat out for the last few rounds, watching his brothers try their hardest to regain their money.Hand after hand, I pulled in their chips, and hand after hand, Thomas watched me more closely.Every time I laid my cards down Travis and Jim laughed, Taylor cursed, Tyler proclaimed his undying love for me, and Trent threw a full blown tantrum.I cashed in my chips and gave them all one hundred dollars once we settled into the living room.Jim refused, but the brothers accepted with gratitude.Travis grabbed my hand and we walked to the door.I could see he was unhappy, so I squeezed his fingers in mine.Whats wrong, Baby?You just gave away four hundred bucks, Pidge!Travis frowned.If this was poker night at Sig Tau, I would have kept it.I cant rob your brothers the first time I meet them.They would have kept your money!he said.And I wouldnt have lost a second of sleep over it, either, Tyler laughed.Thomas stared at me in silence from the corner of the room.Why do you keep starin at my girl, Tommy?What did you say your last name was?Thomas asked.I shifted my weight nervously.Travis, noticing my unease, turned to his brother and put his arm around my waist.I wasnt sure if he was doing it in protective reaction, or he was bracing himself for what his brother might say.Its Abernathy.What of it?I can see why you didnt put it together before tonight, Trav, but now you dont have an excuse, Thomas said, smug.What the fuck are you talking about?Travis asked.Are you related to Mick Abernathy by any chance?Thomas asked.All heads turned in my direction and I nervously raked my hair back with my fingers.How do you know Mick?Travis angled his head to look into my eyes.Hes only one of the best poker players that ever lived.Do you know him?I winced, knowing I had finally been cornered into telling the truth.Hes my father.The entire room exploded.NO FUCKING WAY!I KNEW IT!WE JUST PLAYED MICK ABERNATHYS DAUGHTER!MICK ABERNATHY?HOLY SHIT!Thomas, Jim and Travis were the only ones not shouting.I told you guys I shouldnt play, I said.If you would have mentioned you were Mick Abernathys daughter, I think we would have taken you more seriously, Thomas said.I peered over at Travis, who stared at me in awe.Youre Lucky Thirteen?he asked, his eyes a bit hazy.Trenton stood and pointed at me, his mouth opened wide.Lucky Thirteen is in our house!No way!I dont fucking believe it!That was the nickname the papers gave me.And the story wasnt exactly accurate, I said, fidgeting.I need to get Abby home, guys, Travis said, still staring at me.Jim peered at me over his glasses.Why wasnt it accurate?I didnt take my dads luck.I mean, how ridiculous, I chuckled, twisting my hair nervously around my finger.Thomas shook his head.No, Mick gave that interview.He said at midnight on your thirteenth birthday his luck ran dry.And yours picked up, Travis added.You were raised by mobsters!Trent said, smiling with excitement.Uhno, I laughed once.They didnt raise me.They were justaround a lot.That was a damn shame, Mick running your name through the mud like that in all the papers.You were just a kid, Jim said, shaking his head.If anything it was beginners luck, I said, desperately trying to hide my humiliation.You were taught by Mick Abernathy, Jim said, shaking his head in awe.You were playing pros, and winning, at thirteen years old for Christs sakes.He looked at Travis and smiled.Dont bet against her, son.She doesnt lose.Travis looked at me, then, his expression still shocked and disoriented.Uhwe gotta go, Dad.Bye, guys.The deep, excited chatter of Travis family faded as he pulled me out the door and to his bike.I twisted my hair into a bun and zipped up my coat, waiting for him to speak.He climbed onto his bike without a word, and I straddled the seat behind him.I was sure he felt that I hadnt been honest with him, and he was probably embarrassed that he found out about such an important part of my life the same time his family had.I expected a huge argument when we returned to his apartment, and I went over a dozen different apologies in my head before we reached the front door.He led me down the hall by my hand, and then helped me with my coat.I pulled at the caramel knot on the crown of my head, and my hair fell past my shoulders in thick waves.I know youre mad, I said, unable to look him in the eyes.Im sorry I didnt tell you, but its not something I talk about.Mad at you?he said.I am so turned on I cant see straight.You just robbed my asshole brothers of their money without batting an eyelash, you have achieved legend status with my father and I know for a fact that you purposely lost that bet we made before my fight.I wouldnt say that.He lifted his chin.Did you think you were going to win?Wellno, not exactly, I said, pulling off my heels.Travis smiled.So you wanted to be here with me.I think I just fell in love with you all over again.How are you not mad right now?I asked, tossing my shoes to the closet.He sighed and nodded.Thats pretty big, Pidge.You should have told me.But I understand why you didnt.You came here to get away from all of that.Its like the sky opened upeverything makes sense, now.Well, thats a relief.Lucky Thirteen, he said, shaking his head and pulling my shirt over my head.Dont call me that, Travis.Its not a good thing.Youre fucking famous, Pigeon!he said, surprised at my words.He unbuttoned my jeans and pulled them down around my ankles, helping me to step out of them.My father hated me after that.He still blames me for all his problems.Travis yanked off his shirt and hugged me to him.I still cant believe the daughter of Mick Abernathy is standing in front of me, and Ive been with you this whole time and had no idea.I pushed away from him.Im not Mick Abernathys daughter, Travis!Thats what I left behind.Im Abby.Just Abby!I said, walking over to the closet.I yanked a t shirt off its hanger and pulled it over my head.He sighed.Im sorry.Im a little star struck.Its just me!I held the palm of my hand to my chest, desperate for him to understand.Yeah, but.But nothing.The way youre looking at me right now?This is exactly why I didnt tell you.I closed my eyes.I wont live like that anymore, Trav.Not even with you.Whoa!Calm down, Pigeon.Lets not get carried away.His eyes focused and he walked over to wrap me in his arms.I dont care what you were or what youre not anymore.I just want you.I guess we have that in common, then.He led me to the bed, smiling down at me.Its just you and me against the world, Pidge.I curled up beside him, settling into the mattress.I had never planned on anyone besides myself and America knowing about Mick, and I never expected that my boyfriend would belong to a family of poker buffs.I heaved a heavy sigh, pressing my cheek against his chest.Whats wrong?he asked.I dont want anyone to know, Trav.I didnt want you to know.I love you, Abby.I wont mention it again, okay?Your secrets safe with me, he said, kissing my forehead.Mr.Maddox, think you could tone it down until after class?Professor Chaney said, reacting to my giggling as Travis nuzzled my neck.I cleared my throat, feeling my cheeks radiate with embarrassment.I dont think so, Dr.Chaney.Have you gotten a good look at my girl?Travis said, gesturing to me.Laughter echoed throughout the room and my face caught fire.Professor Chaney glanced at me with a half amused, half awkward expression and then shook his head at Travis.Just do your best, Chaney said.The class laughed again, and I sunk into my seat.Travis rested his arm on the back of my chair, and the lecture continued.After class had been dismissed, Travis walked me to my next class.Sorry if I embarrassed you.I cant help myself.Try.Parker walked by, and when I returned his nod with a polite smile, his eyes brightened.Hey Abby.See you inside.He walked into the classroom, and Travis glowered at him for a few tense moments.Hey, I tugged on his hand until he looked at me.Forget about him.Hes been telling the guys at the House that youre still calling him.Thats not true, I said, unaffected.I know that, but they dont.He said hes just biding his time.He told Brad that youre just waiting for the right time to dump me, and how you call him to say how unhappy you are.Hes starting to piss me off.He has quite an imagination.I glanced at Parker and when he met my eyes and smiled, I glared at him.Would you get mad if I embarrassed you one more time?I shrugged and Travis wasted no time leading me into the classroom.He stopped at my desk, setting my bag on the floor.He looked over at Parker and then pulled me to him, one hand on the nape of my neck, one hand on my backside, and then kissed me, deep and determined.He worked his lips against mine in the way he usually reserved for his bedroom, and I couldnt help but grab his shirt with both fists.The murmuring and giggles grew louder after it became clear that Travis wasnt going to let go anytime soon.I think he just got her pregnant!someone from the back of the room said, laughing.I pulled away with my eyes closed, trying to regain my composure.When I looked at Travis, he was staring at me with the same forced restraint.I was just trying to make a point, he whispered.Good point, I nodded.Travis smiled, kissed my cheek and then looked to Parker who was fuming in his seat.Ill see you at lunch, he winked.I fell against my seat and sighed, trying to shake off the tingling between my thighs.I labored through Calculus, and when class was over I noticed Parker standing against the wall by the door.Parker, I nodded, determined not to give him the reaction he was hoping for.I know youre with him.He doesnt have to violate you in front of an entire class on my account.I stopped in my tracks and poised to attack.Then maybe you should stop telling your frat brothers that Im calling you.Youre going to push him too far and Im not going to feel sorry for you when he puts his boot in your ass.He wrinkled his nose.Listen to you.Youve been around Travis too much.No, this is me.Its just a side of me you know nothing about.You didnt exactly give me a chance, did you?I sighed.I dont want to fight with you, Parker.It just didnt work out, okay?No, its not okay.You think I enjoy being the laughing stock of Eastern?Travis Maddox is the one we all appreciate because he makes us look good.He uses girls, tosses them aside, and even the biggest jerks at Eastern look like Prince Charming after Travis.When are you going to open your eyes and realize that hes different, now?He doesnt love you, Abby.Youre a shiny new toy.Although, after the scene he made in class, Im assuming youre not all that shiny anymore.I slapped his face with a loud smack before I realized what Id done.If you would have waited two seconds, I could have saved you the effort, Pidge, Travis said, pulling me behind him.I grabbed his arm.Travis, dont.Parker looked a bit nervous as a perfect red outline of my hand appeared on his cheek.I warned you, Travis said, shoving Parker violently against the wall.Parkers jaws tensed and he glared at me.Consider this closure, Travis.I can see now that you two are made for each other.Thanks, Travis said, hooking his arm around my shoulders.Parker pushed himself from the wall and quickly rounded the corner to descend the stairs, making sure Travis didnt follow with a quick glance.Are you okay?Travis asked.My hand stings.He smiled.That was bad ass, Pidge.Im impressed.Hell probably sue me and Ill end up paying his way into Harvard.What are you doing here?I thought we were meeting in the cafeteria?One side of his mouth pulled up in an impish grin.I couldnt concentrate in class.Im still feelin that kiss.I looked down the hall and then to him.Come with me.His eyebrows pulled together over his smile.What?I walked backwards, pulling him along until I felt the knob of the Physics lab.The door swung open, and I glanced behind me, seeing that it was empty and dark.I tugged on his hand, giggling at his confused expression, and then locked the door, pushing him against it.I kissed him and he chuckled.What are you doin?I dont want you to be unable to concentrate in class, I said, kissing him again.He lifted me up and I wrapped my legs around him.Im not sure what I ever did without you, he said, holding me up with one hand and unbuckling his belt with the other, but I dont ever want to find out.Youre everything Ive ever wanted, Pigeon.Just remember that when I take all of your money in the next poker game, I said, pulling off my shirt.I twirled around, scrutinizing my reflection with a skeptical eye.It was white and backless, dangerously short, and the bodice was held up by a short string of rhinestones that formed a halter around my neck.Wow!Travis is going to piss himself when he sees you in that!America said.I rolled my eyes.How romantic.Youre getting that one.Dont try anymore on, thats the one, she said, clapping with excitement.You dont think it too short?Mariah Carey shows less skin.America shook her head.I insist.I took a turn on the bench while America tried on one dress after another, more indecisive when it came to choosing one for herself.She settled on an extremely short, tight, flesh colored number that left one of her shoulders bare.We rode in her Honda to the apartment to find the Charger gone and Toto alone.America pulled out her phone and dialed, smiling when Shepley answered.Whered you go, Baby?She nodded and then looked at me.Why would I be mad?What kind of surprise?she said, wary.She looked at me again and then walked into Shepleys bedroom, closing the door.I rubbed Totos black pointy ears while America murmured in the bedroom.When she emerged, she tried to subdue the smile on her face.What are they up to now?I asked.Theyre on their way home.Ill let Travis tell you, she said, grinning from ear to ear.Oh, Godwhat?I asked.I just said I cant tell you.Its a surprise.I fidgeted with my hair and picked at my nails, unable to sit still while I waited for Travis to unveil his latest surprise.A birthday part, a puppy  I couldnt imagine what could be next.The loud engine of Shepleys Charger announced their arrival.The boys laughed as they walked up the stairs.Theyre in a good mood, I said.Thats a good sign.Shepley walked in first.I just didnt want you to think there was a reason that he got one and I didnt.America stood up to greet her boyfriend, and threw her arms around him.Youre so silly, Shep.Like I would get mad about that.If I wanted an insane boyfriend, Id date Travis, America said, smiling as she tilted her head to kiss him.It doesnt have anything to do with how I feel about you, Shepley added.Travis walked through the door with a square gauze bandage on his wrist.He smiled at me and then collapsed on the couch, resting his head on my lap.I couldnt look away from the bandage.Okaywhat did you do?Travis smiled and pulled me down to kiss him.I could feel the nervousness radiating from him.Outwardly he was smiling, but I had the distinct feeling he wasnt sure how I would react to what he had done.I got a few things today.Like what?I asked, suspicious.Travis laughed.Calm down, Pidge.Its nothing bad.What happened to your wrist?I said, pulling his hand up by his fingers.A thunderous diesel motor pulled up outside and Travis hopped up from the couch, opening the door.Its about fucking time!Ive been home for at least five minutes!he said with a smile.One man walked in backwards, carrying a plastic covered grey sofa, followed by another man bringing in the rear.Shepley and Travis moved the couch  with me and Toto still on it  forward, and then the men sat the new one in its place.Travis pulled off the plastic and then lifted me in his arms, setting me on the soft cushions.You got a new one?I asked, grinning from ear to ear.Yep, and a couple of other things, too.Thanks guys, he said as the movers lifted the old couch and left the way they came.There goes a lot of memories, I smirked.None that I want to hold on to.He sat beside me and sighed, watching me for a moment before he pulled off the tape that held the gauze on his arm.Dont freak out.My mind raced with what could be under that bandage.I imagined a burn, or stitches or something equally gruesome.He pulled the bandage back and I gasped at the simple black script tattooed across the underside of his wrist, the skin around it red and shiny from the antibiotic he had smeared on.I shook my head in disbelief as I read the word.Pigeon  Do you like it?he asked.You had my name tattooed on your wrist?I said the words, but it didnt sound like my voice.My mind was stretching in every direction, and yet I managed to speak in a calm, even tone.Yeah, he said, kissing my cheek as I stared in disbelief at the permanent ink in his skin.I tried to talk him out of it, Abby.He hasnt done anything crazy in awhile.I think he was having withdrawals, Shepley said, shaking his head.What do you think?Travis prompted.I dont know what to think, I said.You should have asked her first, Trav, America said, shaking her head and covering her mouth with her fingers.Asked her what?If I could get a tattoo?he frowned, turning to me.I love you.I want everyone to know Im yours.I shifted nervously, Thats permanent, Travis.So are we, he said, touching my cheek.Show her the rest, Shepley said.The rest?I said, looking down to his other wrist.Travis stood, pulling up his shirt.His impressive six pack stretched and tightened with the movement.Travis turned, and on his side was another fresh tattoo spanning the length of his ribs.What is that?I asked, squinting at the vertical symbols.Its Hebrew, Travis smiled.What does it mean?It says, I belong to my beloved, and my beloved is mine.My eyes darted to his.You werent happy with just one tattoo, you had to get two?Its something I always said I would do when I met The One.I met youI went and got the tats.His smile faded when he saw my expression.Youre pissed, arent you?he said, pulling his shirt down.Im not mad.Im justits a little overwhelming.Shepley squeezed America to his side with one arm.Get used to it now, Abby.Travis is impulsive and goes balls to the wall on everything.Thisll tide him over until he can get a ring on your finger.Americas eyebrows shot up, first to me, and then to Shepley.What?They just started dating!
