Had this Michael already done his work, and was the love of her life even now bleeding out in some back alley?She dug her nails into her palm, trying to keep control of herself.Then we need to find out where he is and go to him.Her brother shot her a look.Easier said than done.You have connections.Use them.Shed never felt so helpless in her life.Not when she was shipped off to Connecticut for supposedly her own good.Not when her father basically sold her into a marriage she didnt want.Not even when Devlin died.James was in trouble and she was stuck here in Teagues apartment, pacing the increasingly small space and throwing shitty ideas at the wall.She bet Aiden knew where James was.He always seemed to know everything.But he wasnt someone she could call in for help and know without a shadow of a doubt that hed help her instead of hauling her back to Dmitri.He didnt approve of James, and she couldnt risk him working against her instead of with her.Callie came out of the back room, the phone to her ear.Thank you, Micah.Youre a lifesaver.She hung up.The Hallorans have a meet up with a flesh trader tonight down at the docks.I cant confirm that James will be there, but if hes not answering his phone, its a safe bet.Hed been serious when he asked her the other day about freeing women from the slave trade.Shed wondered butIt doesnt matter right now.All that matters is getting to him and making sure hes safe.And if she put a bullet into this Michael in the process, she wouldnt cry herself to sleep at night over it.She started for the door, but Teague blocked her way.No.We know where he is.We have to go now, before its too late.If you think for a second that Im taking my sister and my wife into a meeting with two enemies, youre out of your mind.His gaze jumped from her face to Callies and back again.Were not rushing into anything.She eyed the door, but even if she got past Teague, what was she going to do?She needed help, no matter how much the delay had her in danger of tearing her hair out in frustration.You have a plan?Then lets hear it.We need backup.The last thing she wanted to hear.Carrigan threw up her hands.Who are we going to call?There isnt a single member of our family that would help with this.Every one of them would be willing to let James burn if it meant they wouldnt have a Halloran at their back.Or with her.I wouldnt be so sure of that.As if on cue, the door behind him opened and Cillian walked through, Liam at his back.Her younger brother raised his eyebrows at her shock.I dont like that bastard, but even I can see that hes head over heels for you.And if the Russian is willing to take out one of the three main players in Boston, theres nothing to stop him from trying the same shit with us whenever he feels like it.Nothing except Carrigan marrying him.But hed already proven he wouldnt keep his word if it didnt suit him.Hed had Jamess death planned from the beginning, regardless of what hed promised her.She swallowed hard.I appreciate this.From both of you.Liam came to stand next to her.Ive been doing whatever it took to keep you out of trouble for years.Id be a heartless monster to stop now.She smiled her thanks and turned her attention back to Teague.Im all for backup, but do you really think two people will be enough to turn the tide?No.It was Callie who answered.Thats why Micah and a group of my men will be meeting us there.She realized what the goal wasto keep as many OMalley people out of the mess as possibleand nodded.Then Im going to need more Taser cartridges.The Sheridans were now more stable than either of the other families in Boston.They couldnt care less if she married a Halloran, since all it would mean was that Boston would become stronger as a whole for the new alliance.If only her family could see things that way.That was a battle for another day.Right now all that mattered was making sure James lived to see the dawn.Twenty Four James breathed in the briny air and wished he was anywhere but here.The docks after dark had always set his teeth on edge.There were too many shadows and places to set up an ambush.That was why hed sent Michael and a few handpicked men in earlierto make sure things went off without a hitch.It didnt help that it had started to snow a few minutes ago, the flakes quickly creating a curtain that further obscured his vision.The van sat behind him, ready for its cargo.He kept reminding himself that these women would get a chance at a different life, but it didnt do a damn thing to make him feel better.It was entirely too possiblelikely, eventhat theyd already seen abuse he could only imagine.That kind of thing left a mark on a persons soul that a Band Aid couldnt touch.But he could do his part to put them back on the path to freedom.It wasnt enough, but he wasnt a fucking superhero.Ricky wandered around the van, whistling tonelessly.James wanted to tell him to shut the fuck up, but that meant admitting that it bugged him to begin with.His brother was still on his best behavior, which only made his paranoia increase with each passing hour.He turned and watched the water, searching for the lights of the boat.He should have known better.When it came, it slipped through the snowfall soundlessly without a single beam to announce its presence.Several men jumped to the dock and tied it off, and then one broke away from the rest to approach.You have the payment.James gestured to the bag at his feet.The product?The man unzipped the bag and rifled through it before nodding.He whistled and made a sharp motion.The men spoke quietly, and then one of them grabbed a stumbling form and guided her down the dock to the van where Ricky waited.James caught a glimpse of her haggard face, eyes vacant, and had to fight back a shudder.Every single woman who passed him had that same expression on their face.He caught the mans eye and jerked his chin.Explain.Opium.The man shrugged.They got riled up halfway through, so we did what we had to do.Shouldnt be permanent damage.Questions pressed him.How long had they been in a forced opium induced haze?When was the last time they ate?Drank?This man didnt care, and James wouldnt win himself any points for acting too concerned.Hed already decided that this wouldnt be the last batch of women he purchased, and he needed the seller to be willing to work with him again.That meant not rocking the boat.Yet.As the last girltwenty totalwalked past him, he nodded.Pleasure doing business with you.Likewise.He waited for the men to climb aboard the boat and cast off before he made his way back to the van.The women huddled in the back, piled in like sardines.He started to reach for some kind of comforting bullshit to say, but they shrank from him as a single unit when his shadow darkened the door.Fuck.There wasnt a damn thing he could say that theyd believe, and trying would only scare the shit out of them.He slammed the door shut.Lisa Marie would know the right way to go about this.Carrigan would know what to do with them.Shes the one who had that idea for the nonprofit.I bet shes got more ideas.He pushed the thought away.There hadnt been time to figure out what the fuck he was going to do when it came to her.Letting her go wasnt an option, not when he knew she cared about him.She wouldnt have acted the way she did before if that wasnt true.Keep your head in the game, Halloran.Now isnt the time to get distracted.He turned, and caught sight of the shiny barrel of the gun his brother held.James froze.That little motherfucker.Ricky.Sorry about this.His brother laughed.Actually, no Im not.Youre a pussy, just like our old man always said you were.So Im taking the Hallorans.Jesus Christ.He eyed the gun.His brother had made sure he was out of easy reach so hed be able to pull the trigger before James could get to him.Smart.His own gun was in a holster around his ankle, also out of easy reach.Less smart.Damn it, he should have expected this.Why dont we talk about this?Theres nothing to talk about.Rickys eyes were too wide.You didnt really think Id let you lock me up for a fucking week, did you?Youre shit, and everyone but you sees it.Im the one who deserves to run the Hallorans.He motioned with the gun.Get in the back.Like fuck was he going to get in the van and let his little brother drive him to somewhere more private, or whatever the hell he had in mind.If I hadnt been obsessing about CarriganJames shook his head.Not going to happen.Whats going on here?James didnt take his attention off his little brother as Michael approached.Just a little familial disagreement.With the other man, theyd be two on one against Ricky.He glanced at his second in command.Rickys feeling a little overtired.I have a fucking gun!You should be pissing your pants!Not making goddamn motherfucking jokes!He waved the pistol.He never saw Michael move, slamming his own gun across the back of his head and dropping him.James sighed.Hes a problem.Hes not the only one.He glanced up.It took his mind far too long to process the change in Michael.The man stood straight and held his gun pointed at James.He slowly held up his hands, trying to calculate his chances of dropping to the ground and getting his gun from his ankle before Michael shot him.They werent great.Think about this.I dont have a choice.Michael motioned him away from the van.If its any consolation, after the last few weeks, I wouldnt have chosen this.Well, shit, Michael.Since youre obviously not going to let sentiment stop you from shooting me in the fucking back, its not much of a consolation at all.He moved slowly.I hope theyre paying you well, whoever the fuck they are, because youre going to die for them.He wasnt going down without a fight.He had too goddamn much to live for.Carrigan.He loved the woman and if he died, shed end up married to that Russian and fading away as the years passed.James couldnt stand the thought of the wildness that he loved so much in her dying any more than he could stand the thought of another mans ring on her finger.He watched Michael closely.Want to tell me who bought you off?Ill have to send them something nice as a thank you gift.The mans hand shook, and he brought his second one up to the grip of the gun to steady it.I tried to change my mind, James.I told that Russian bastard I couldnt do it.But its you or me now.No one crosses Dmitri Romanov.Dmitri Romanov.There was that fucking name again.Wheres Carrigan now?Is she with him?There were no innocents in their lifestyles, but there was also a huge gap between the families in Boston and the kind of shady shit Romanov was pulling right now, turning his best man against him.Carrigan had never been one to color inside the linesit was only a matter of time before she did something to piss Romanov off.And then Ive got to live so I can get her out of there.Im not usually down with killing fools, but for you, Michael, Ill make an exception.I wouldnt.The apology was gone from Michaels voice.He sent me to make sure this goes off without a hitch.Even if you take me out, it wont do a damn bit of good.Goddamn it.James looked around, but all he could see where shadows.Where?Like Im telling you that.A pop of gunfire sounded in the distance.Michael half turned.What the?James moved.He tackled the other man, shoving his arms over his head as they went down.He was vaguely aware of more gunfire in the distance, but he was too busy trying not to get shot by the little weasel to worry about it.After he got over his initial surprise at the attack, Michael fought like a man possessed.He let go of the gun and punched James in the side, stealing his breath, and then went for his eyes.There was no finesse.James grabbed his throat and slammed his head back into the ground, but it only stunned Michael for a second and then he was attacking again, rolling James beneath him and rearing back to get some force into his hits.A sizzling sound broke through, and he suddenly started spasming, his eyes rolling back in his head.He slumped to the side, revealing a woman standing behind him.Carrigan.*** Carrigan saw the blood on Jamess face and pulled the trigger on the Taser to deliver another devastating bolt of electricity to the little shit on the ground.She held the button down, wishing it was something more permanent.And then James was there, pulling her away from the man and into his arms.What are you doing here?Saving your ass.She clung to him, trying to process the fact that they hadnt been too late.He was okay.A little bruised and bloodied, but he was alive.God, I was so worried about you.The only warning she got was his arms tightening around her, and then James dragged her to the ground.Gunfire sounded, too close.She twisted around but, pinned between the ground and his body, she couldnt see anything.Whats happening?She smacked his chest.Get off me.Not yet.He did lift up a little so she could breathe.You didnt come alone?No.I have Teague and Cillian and some of the Sheridan men with us.My brothers.She rolled over, and squirmed to get out from beneath him.I need to get to my brothers.James kept her pinned easily, and hed pulled a gun from somewhere.Their position left their right side shielded by the van, but they were seriously exposed out here.He must have been thinking the same thing because he wrestled his free arm beneath her and started hauling her back toward the vehicle.Were getting the fuck out of here.She wanted him safe, but she was still hearing gunshots.My brothers are out there.And so was Callie.If something happens to one of them because of meShe hadnt thought of the cost when shed argued and bullied them into coming with her.All shed been thinking of was how desolate her world would be without James in it.She struggled harder.Let me go.This was a mistake and not a mistake and, oh God, she needed to do something.He climbed to his feet, taking her with him.Where are they?She pointed at the approximate place shed left her group.Theyd been moving slowly, but shed slipped away, determined to get to James before it was too late.Stupid, selfish bitch.Around that building.Ill go.He opened the passenger door and shoved her in before she could protest.When she tried to climb out, he stopped her with a hand on her chest.Carrigan, there are twenty terrified women in the back of this van.We cant leave them.We.She stopped fighting him, her breath coming too fast.I love you.I know.He kissed her, quick and brutal.Theres a gun underneath the seat and the keys are in the ignition.If Im not back in ten minutes, you get the fuck out of here.He slammed the door before she could respond, leaving her with only the sound of her heart pounding and her harsh breathing.Stay safe while everyone around her put themselves in danger?No fucking way.She scrambled over to the drivers seat and cranked on the engine.She couldnt just sit here and hope for the best.She had to do something.Carrigan froze when someone wailed in the back portion of the van.This is about more than me.She turned and muscled open the window panel looking back into the rest of the vehicleand promptly stopped breathing.There were so many women back there, she couldnt even start to count them.Several of them were crying.Oh God.If she hauled ass after James, someone could shoot the van.If it was just her, she wouldnt think twice about making that choice.But if she got some of these women killed because she couldnt take ordersCarrigan gritted her teeth.Ten minutes.I can wait ten minutes.She tried to make her voice as reassuring as possible, Its okay.Youre safe now.They wouldnt believe herif she was in their position, she wouldnt believe herbut she repeated the words all the same.Youre safe.Just hang in there for a little longer.Then she turned around and settled down to wait, her gaze on the clock in the dashboard.*** James moved through the snow, his gun cold in his hand.He still couldnt wrap his mind around the fact that Carrigan was here, and shed brought reinforcements.God, he loved the fuck out of that woman.He followed the sound of gunfire, skirting the edge of a warehouse.The weather made it hard to see more than a few feet in front of him, and he was doubly glad he left Carrigan back at the van.Shed keep the women safeand herself safe in the process.A man stumbled out of the darkness and went to his knees.James didnt rush forward immediately, checking the surrounding area to make sure he was alone.It was only when he stalked closer than he saw it was Carrigans younger brotherthe one with the fancy duds and tattoos.Cillian.He clutched his side, rolling onto his back with a harsh gasp that told James he was hurt, and hurt badly.He went to his knees next to the man and spoke softly.Cillian.Halloran.He cracked open his eyes.Karma is a bitch, isnt it?James didnt know what the fuck he was talking about, but he patted the man down, constantly scanning the surrounding area.The not so distant sound of gunfire hadnt stopped, and it was only a matter of time before someone saw the blood trail Cillian had left behind and came to investigate.He touched the mans shoulder and cursed softly when his hand came away wet.Kid, I think youre shot.Thatswhat I meant about karma.Fuck.Youre not dying on my watch.There hadnt been a damn thing he could do to stop his men from killing Carrigans other brother.But he could do something about this one.Shed already suffered enough.He shrugged out of his coat and yanked off his shirt, wadding it up and pressing it against Cillians bleeding shoulder hard enough to make the other man hiss.Hold this.He put his hands over the shirt and sat back, taking precious seconds to pull his coat back on.A voice sounded closetoo close.I think he went this way.Lets get the little bastard.If their Russian accents werent enough to go by, their words would have been.James sent a silent prayer of thanks to the weather gods for the cover the snow offered.If it werent for that, hed be a sitting duck right here next to this wall.Two figures melted out of the gloom.One of them must have seen him because they cursed in what he figured was Russian.That was all he needed to know.He sighted down his gun and fired once, twice, a third time, dropping them both.His finger hovered on the trigger as a third man appeared, but the guy held up his hands.Not one of Romanovs men.Teague.James set his gun aside.Get your ass over here.Your brothers been shot.The man had passed out sometime in the last fifteen seconds, and the light coating of snow on the ground around his shoulder was stained red.Goddamn it.Instantly, Teague was by his side.He probed beneath the shirt, his face a mask of concentration.Im not medic, but I think its a through and through.Which was good on one hand, because it meant the bullet wasnt going to shift and do more damage, but it also didnt take into account the damage already done.He put a bit more weight onto Cillians shoulder.Call your people in.We need to get him to the hospital.My sister?Safe.Shes back that way.He jerked his chin in the direction of the van.The rest of Romanovs men?These were the last of them.He put the phone to his ear.Callie?Round up the boys.Cillians been shot.Well meet you at the entrance of the docks.He hung up.When he moved to take Cillian, James shook his head.I got him.You guys were here to help me out.My responsibility.Teague gave a jerky nod and let James carefully scoop his brother up.It was hard to tell how bad the bleeding was in the darkness, or if itd slowed at all, but the faster they got moving the better.Watch my back.I will.James turned and started for the van, willing the man in his arms to live, willing Carrigan to be safe when they got back, willing them to get through this night without yet another loss in the OMalley family.They found Carrigan exactly where hed left her.She jumped out of the van and rushed to his side.Cillian?Hes going to be okay.He hoped like hell he wasnt lying to her.Get back in the van.Were going to meet your people at the entrance of the docks.It took mere seconds to get them loaded up, and he put Cillian down across the backseat, his head in his sisters lap.Then James slammed the door and moved around to the drivers side.He looked over the hood at Teague.I owe you.You owe my sister.None of this would have happened without her.Without her, James might be dead right now.He climbed behind the wheel and threw the vehicle into gear.Two minutes later, they were off loading Cillian into a plain black SUV.Carrigan reached for the door and stopped.James Go with your brother, lovely.I have a few things I have to take care of.Michael and Ricky were back in the docks, and he wasnt about to leave those two fucks behind.He hooked the back of her neck and drew her in for a quick kiss.Dont worry.You havent seen the last of me.Good.With that one last word, she climbed into the SUV and was gone.*** The ride to the hospital was a blur, but it was more than enough time for Carrigan to wade through past nightmares.Of standing next to Teagues bedside and wondering if hed live after hed been so badly beaten, of wondering if there was something she could have done to save him.To save Devlin.Guilt was a funny thing sometimes.Rationally, she knew there was plenty of blame to go around, but shed been all too willing to take more than her fair share.This time, it really was her fault.She was the one whod thrown a bitchfit and demanded someoneanyonehelp James.All shed been thinking of was that life would never be the same if he wasnt somewhere, breathing and going about his life and alive.She could submit to any number of fucked up things as long as she knew he was okay.Shed willingly put her family in danger.Worse, she wasnt sure shed do anything differently if given a second go round.I am a terrible person.So incredibly selfish.They slammed to a stop in the ER entranceway.Someone must have called ahead, because there was a pair of nurses and a stretcher waiting.The men took Cillian from the backseat and strapped him into the stretcher, and then they were gone, rushing through the door and spitting medical jargon back and forth.It will be okay.She glanced at Callie, taking in how pale the other woman was.I hope so.This hospital had to hold terrified memories for her sister in law, too.Shed been the one to save Teague before.Carrigan followed her though the corridors to the appropriate waiting room.It looked like a thousand other waiting rooms across the US.And probably the world, too.She sank into the faded chair.This is all my fault.Cillian made his own decisions.He knew the risks.Callie sat next to her.Hes going to live.As much as she craved the words, she couldnt trust them.He got shot because of me.No, he got shot because Dmitri Romanov called for Jamess death.Callies smile barely twitched her lips.I seem to remember having a similar conversation a few months ago.The one where Carrigan had told Callie that the war escalating would have happened one way or another, even if she hadnt killed Brendan Halloran.She scrubbed her hand over her face.Guilt is such a sticky emotion.Tell me about it.Callies phone rang again.Yes?Youre sure?Thanks, Micah.She hung up.Romanov is gone.Im not sure when, but his hotel room is empty, and hes nowhere to be found.It was tempting to think he was gone for good, but Carrigan knew better.Hell be back.Dmitri wasnt the kind of man to take defeat lying down, and hed lost twice now.Carrigan wasnt marrying him, and James was still alive.She slumped down into her chair.This isnt over.Probably not.Callies blue eyes were harder than shed ever seen them.But now we know hes an enemy.He cant play at being an ally while stabbing us in the back.Thats something.Maybe.But it wouldnt be enough.It had taken her all of ten seconds to realize how dangerous Dmitri was, and Carrigan had the feeling that the knowledge was just a drop in an ocean.Hed be back, and hed be back for blood.Twenty Five James sat on the snow covered pavement next to his little brother for a long time.Ricky wouldnt be getting up again.The blow to his head from Michael had killed him.Maybe if theyd been more focused on getting him to a hospitalThere were a lot of maybes circling his head right now, and they werent doing him any favors.Both brothers, gone.He was well and truly alone now.Mr.Halloran.He looked up.The Sheridan men stood around him in a staggered formation, half of them turned to face any potential outside threat.The black man speaking looked barely in his mid twenties, but he seemed more than capable of taking care of business.James just wanted him to go away.He shook his head.That wasnt right.He had to get the fuck out of here.It was a fucking miracle they hadnt brought any cops down upon themselves until now.He reached out and stopped just short of touching Rickys face.How long have I been sitting here?The man looked away.We can transport your brother for you.What do you want to do with your man?His gaze fell to Michael, trussed up and gagged.Hed tried to make a run for it in the middle of the confusion, but Callistas men had found and retrieved him.Hes not my man anymore.Bring him.He has a lot to answer for.Though he doubted Michael had much in the way of information, he couldnt finish the man off until he knew for sure.James climbed to his feet, feeling decades older.Carrigan?Shes at the hospital with her brotherit looks like he might be okay.She was safeor as safe as anyone could be.He nodded.Good.He wanted to go to her, to hear her tell him she loved him again, to hold her in his arms and never let go.But there was shit he had to deal with before he could.First order of business was getting these women cared for.He went around to the van and found his phone on the floorboard.A few minutes later, Lisa Marie came on the line.What do you need, honey?A place for twenty girls.They arent going to be able to answer questions until theyre sure theyre safe.Are they safe?He listened to soft sobbing coming from the back of the van.As safe as I can make them.Theyll have their freedom, one way or another.Bring them here.Me and the girls will get it taken care of.Ill let you know the arrangements once I have them in place.And send me the bill.Good.Ill be there in twenty.He hung up and tossed the phone onto the passenger seat.The Sheridan man was still waiting.Get that piece of shithe jerked his chin at Michaeland meet me at my place.I have one stop to make first and then Ill be there.The man nodded.Got it.Then he was gone, melting into the darkness with the rest of his people.James took a harsh breath and got into the van.The constant crying couldnt be escaped and grated on his nerves something fierce, but he didnt try to make them stop.These women had already seen enough trauma to last them a lifetimehe wasnt going to add to that if he could help it.He met Lisa Marie at the back of Tit for Tat, and she surveyed him with a critical eye.Trouble tonight.You could say that.Betrayal everywhere he turned.Ricky hed expected, though the loss was still there, waiting for him to drop his guard so it could sucker punch him.But Michael?Michael hed trusted.He hadnt seen that coming.No wonder my old man was nuttier than a squirrel.He motioned to the van.Whats the best way to play this?She snubbed out her cigarette.Stand back and dont say anything to spook them.Without waiting to see if hed done what she asked, she opened the door and spoke softly to the girls.He couldnt quite catch the words, but the tone was big on soothinglike something a person would use with a wild animal or a rabid dog.Lisa Marie stepped back and, one by one, the girls crawled into the pale light thrown off by the propped open back door.Two of the strippersEcho and one he couldnt placeappeared and led them away.It took all of five minutes, but James held his breath damn near the entire time.You did good, honey.She shook another cigarette out of its pack and lit up.Some of them wont surviveits the nature of the beastbut most of them will.He crossed his arms over his chest.And if we start getting regular shipments of this kind in?He couldnt take for granted that Carrigan would be with him, let alone willing to put the fledgling nonprofit plan shed talked about in place.That would solve a number of problems, but there would always be women who were more comfortable with the life he could offer themwomen who didnt want to go home.Regular shipments.She shot him a sharp look.James Halloran, I never pegged you for a white knight.She continued before he could confirm or deny.We can make it work.We might need another club, or at least more opportunity on the legal side of things for those who want to stay here, but it can be done.Some of them will want to go back to wherever they came from, so youll have to figure that shit out.He hadnt realized how tense he was until her words relaxed something inside him.All the bullshit and evil and monstrous things hed donethis wouldnt make them right.But itd be a start.James nodded.Get me the relevant information from the women and Ill figure it out.He had a few feelers he could put out, though his connections werent as vast as, say, the Sheridans.I bet Teague knows a thing or two about tracking down this type of information.Hed have to ask the other man the first chance he got.He got back into the van and drove home, and another interview that he desperately didnt want to have to go through.What the fuck am I going to do?Hed never felt so goddamn alone in his life.*** Carrigan marched through the front door of her house, and straight into her fathers office.He was there, along with Aiden, just as shed suspected he would be.Plotting, always plotting.A freaking spider in the middle of his web with no concern for the flies caught in its strands.It stops now.She slammed her hands down onto the desk.In case youre wondering, Cillians come through surgery and hell survive.Seamus didnt look up from the papers in front of him.He shouldnt have been down at the docks to begin with.Are you fucking serious?That got him to look up.Language, Carrigan.For fucks sake, Father, your priorities leave something to be desired.She took two steps back, carefully not looking at Aiden.He hadnt said anything, but he didnt need to.He was here instead of the waiting room, with their father instead of their brother.Its done.Dmitri is gone, and Im not marrying him.She rushed on before he could say anything else.I practically killed myself to be an obedient daughter.I put aside all my ambitions and dreams to do it.At least part of the time.No more.He didnt move.If youre done with this tantrum God, will you listen to yourself?Look around you.Devlin is dead.Dead.And for what?Because you wanted to make a grab at power.Cillian is in the hospital because he realized that a man whod break his word without blinking isnt someone we want to ally with.What Dmitri does with James Halloran is no concern of mine.It was like beating her head against a brick wall and expecting it to be reasonable.She wanted to rail and scream and throw things, but it wouldnt get through to him.I love James Halloran.She turned, feeling so damn defeated.Carrigan.For a second she thought shed gotten through to him, that something had penetrated the stubborn wall he kept around himself and opened his eyes to what he stood to lose.Then he went and dashed that tiny hope on the rocks of reality.If you walk out that door, youre dead to me and every person in this family.It was always like this with him, all or nothing, obedience or threats.She kept going.Then consider me as dead as Devlin.Closing the study door behind her felt like shed sucked all the air out of the hallway.Despite everything hed put her through, she wanted to curl into a ball and sob at the injustice of it all.Damn it, she loved her father despite all his faults.And hed just effectively banished her.That got her moving.She had less than ten minutes before he sent someone to make sure she was gone, and there were things she refused to leave behind.Carrigan rushed up the stairs and to her room, ignoring Sloan when she poked her head out of her door.She tore through her dresser, breathing a tiny sigh of relief when she came up with Jamess album.After dumping it into a small overnight bag, she grabbed a few sets of clothing and a picture of her with all her siblings, grinning at the camera like fools.It was a few years old, but it had always been one of her favorites.Carrigan?Whats going on?She didnt glance at her sister.Her makeup went into the bag.Tell Keira that I love her.She slipped a few pieces of her favorite jewelry into her pocket.Theyd all been gifts on milestone birthdays from her mother, and she didnt want to walk out the door without them.She turned and nearly ran over Sloan.I love you, too.I dont want to leave you like this, but if I stay hes going to make me marry someone else.I cant do it.Sloans normally pale skin was ghastly white.Hell kill you.He already did.He just pronounced me dead to the family.She hugged her sister, holding her tight for a long moment before she released her.Take care of yourself.No one else is going to do it.Another quick hug.Ive got to go.As much as she didnt want to leave her little sisters in this house, there wasnt a damn thing she could do about it.Her father might be willing to let her walk out of here with only a symbolic death, but he wouldnt let them all go.Im so sorry.Voices sounded at the bottom of the stairs, and Sloan shoved her down the hall.Take the back stairs.Ill stall for you.I love you.I love you, too.Now go.She went.The back stairs were deserted and she made it out of the town house without seeing anyone else.As soon as she hit the street, doubts assailed her.Shed been so busy trying to get out, she hadnt stopped to consider what shed do next.Carrigan stopped on the corner, the sheer weight of the decision shed just made nearly sending her to her knees.Free.She was free.It was almost too good to be trueuntil she started thinking about what shed sacrificed for the chance.Her siblings.Her parents.Her entire life.She could go anywhere, do anything, be any kind of person she wanted to, and no one would appear to drag her back into the fold.I can actually get a jobuse my degree in communications and journalism for something Im passionate about.I can have a real life.Really, there was only one destination for her.She walked down to the corner, her heels crunching over the newly fallen snow, and hailed a cab.She rattled off the address to the one place shed sworn up and down that shed never go back to.The Halloran house.James.Her nerves kicked into high gear as the cab entered Southie and finally pulled to a stop in front of the place where she almost spent her last day on earth.There was something ironic about coming here on the day her family declared her dead to them.She paid the cabbie and started for the front door.What if he doesnt want you anymore now that youre not an OMalley?Her stride hitched, but she readjusted her grip on her bag and kept going.If he didnt want her, then shed find something else.Yes, the Hallorans were just as perfectly suited for the plan shed always dreamed of as the OMalleys were, but if he turned her away, she could just as easily offer that to the Sheridans.Teague would see the value of going as legit as possible and earning more power that way.She hoped.She ignored the potential of James trampling all over her broken heart if he rejected her.The temptation to turn around and run was almost overwhelming, but she made it to the front door and rang the bell.James himself answered, freezing at the sight of her.She froze, too, not sure what to say.Hi, Im now homeless and broke and so desperately in love with you that if you turn me away, I think it might shatter something in me irreparably.Lovely?He still didnt move.Im so sorry.For everything.I finally told my family where to shove their ambitions.As she babbled, she unzipped her bag and dug out the album.Theyve declared me as dead as my little brother.A hysterical laugh bubbled up.Heres the album, so I guess theres no reason for you to keep stalking meexcept that I love you.God, James, I love you so much it makes my head spin.But if you dont want me Thats as far as she got before he swept the offered album aside and dragged her into his arms.Stop talking.He kissed her.If you think for a second Im going to let you walk out of my life, youre fucking crazy.Youre mine, Carrigan.Mine and mine alone.Oh.James laughed.Oh?Thats the best youve got?Im not rich anymore.Or an OMalley.For some reason, it was vitally important he understand that had changed.As if I give two shits about either of those things.I want youthe woman.He pushed the hair back from her face.I was coming for you, lovely.I wasnt going to let Dmitri take you, and I sure as fuck wasnt going to let your father ship you off with someone else.Her heartbeat picked up.I walked out on my own.And thats just another reason I love you.Youre strong and you dont need a man to lean on.He cupped her face.But that doesnt mean you cant lean on me.It has nothing to do with need and everything to do with me wanting to be the man whos by your side every step of the way.Your man, Carrigan OMalley.He kissed her, taking her mouth as if he already knew her answer.Carrigan fisted her hands in the front of his shirt, pulling him closer yet.Things with James might have started off in the strangest way possible, but hed been solid every step of the way.He was the only person in her life who put her first for the woman she was, rather than the assets she could bring to the negotiating table.Thats why she was here, in his arms, loving him like crazy.He pulled back enough to say, And I fully intend of making an honest woman of you the first chance I get so the entire world knows we belong to each other.Belonged to each other.She liked that.She liked that a lot.Good God, was that a proposal?He grinned and pulled her into the house, never letting go of her.Not yet.Just making my intentions clear.When I propose youre going to damn well know it.I love this man so much it hurts.But there were still things they needed to talk about.She squeezed his hands as she took a tiny step back.Dmitris gone.It wont be for good.Let him come.Weve faced down threats before, and we will again.He stopped.Your father might not be willing to believe he got into bed with the enemy, but your brothers arent stupid.They wont take this sitting down any more than I will.She wasnt so sure, but she also wasnt willing to argue about it.There was time for plotting and scheming in the future.Right now she had the man she loved and the freedom shed spent her entire life craving.But firstYour brother?Gone.There was no mistaking the way he meant.Gone the same way Devlin was gone.Oh, James.She stepped back into his arms and hugged him tight.Im sorry.I know he was an evil little bastard, but Im still sorry.Me too.I wish things could have been different, but they werent.Im just gladIm just glad I wasnt the one to kill him.That would have broken something in him beyond repair.She hugged him tighter.And the girls?Safe.He stroked a hand down her back.What would you say if I told you I was serious about that nonprofit we talked about?I cant save them all, but I can save some of them, and you could help with that.Hell, I dont know if I can do it without you.These women deserve their freedom.She framed his face with her hands.Id say yes.Im going to have it allthe man, the dream, the life I was always too scared to let myself want.She smiled, her mind already whirling with plans.The Hallorans didnt have the same reputation in the elite circles of Boston that the OMalleys did, but that wouldnt make a difference in the long run.James could be charming when he wanted to, and she knew how to navigate that part of society.Once she got the foundation set up for the nonprofit, theyd have those people eating out of the palms of their hands.Even better, theyd be doing some serious good in the world while they built their power base.A year ago, if someone had asked her where shed end up if she ever got her freedom, she never would have said in Halloran territory, a stones throw from the part of Boston shed fought so hard to escape.But it wasnt the same thing at all.She was choosing this lifechoosing James and everything that came with him.It made all the difference in the world.You, James Halloran, are a good man.I love the shit out of you, and Id happily share the rest of my life.She grinned.You know, when you get around to proposing.Lovely, the world isnt going to know what hit it.
