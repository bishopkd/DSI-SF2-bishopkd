And it would lead her to the others.She would take what they had, drain them of it, fill herself, and leave their husks to rot.And she would be eternal.Forever young, more beautiful than the sun, more powerful than all the gods.But as she looked, the reflection in the glass began to whither, the skin drooping into folds, drawing back toward the skull.The ebony hair went thin, gray, dry, as the glass showed her aging years, decades, centuries.On a scream of rage, she hurled the mirror away, smashing glass and gems.With a trembling hand, she lifted the goblet beside her, drank fast and deep.And with its brew and her will, drew back her youth and beauty.She had pushed too much of herself into the attack the night before, and needed more potion.Her banishment from the Island of Glass stripped away her rightsto that youth, that beauty.She aged.Not like the puny humans.No, even this humiliation wasnt so great.But she aged.Her body gradually losing its form, her skin its texture, her face its beauty.She would have them back, not just the illusion of them, but truly.And she would banish the ones whod lowered her to this until they turned to dust.She would be queen of all, and all who had defied her would perish.But they would suffer first.FIFTEEN     			Since everyone else seemed to have conveniently vanished, Sasha contemplated what to make for dinner.Sunsetshe checkedwas in just over an hour.If Riley did indeed fast until sunrise, she ought to eat a good meal first.Privately, she could admit she was tired of cooking for their small army, but given the circumstancesfull moonshe couldnt suggest they take a break and go into the village for a meal.Shed just about settled on pastaa staple in her worldwhen Doyle walked in.He dropped three large pizza boxes on the table.I was in the mood.Oh.Thats great, she said, with genuine feeling.Probably need to heat them up, or have Killian wave his magic wand.Either way it saves me from cooking.You need to make a duty list, so it doesnt fall so much on you.This is my way of cooking, so check me off.Fair enough.He went to the fridge, shoved in the beer hed bought along with the pizza, and took one out for himself.Do you have any other skills youve dreamed about?he asked.Im better at fighting in them.Im not as good at the flipping and jumping and kicking, even in my dreams, as Annika or Riley, but Im not embarrassing.But ...She poured herself a glass of the sun tea someonewho hadnt been herhad made that afternoon.Unlike the crossbow, it doesnt just come to me.Annika tried to teach me the basic handspring a little while ago.I got a D minus.You need to work on your upper body strength as much as your form.Those bands Riley gave you arent enough.Start swimming laps, hard.Start doing push ups, pull ups.You do any yoga?A little.Do more.Planks, chaturanga, use your own body weight.Dont do the same thing every day.Switch it up, but do something every day.Increase the time until youve got real muscle fatigue.All right.What?he demanded when she just kept looking at him.Were having an actual conversation you initiated.He shrugged, drank some beer.No point in conversations unless youve got something to say.You held your own last night.Part of thats the knife Bran gave you.But most of its because youve got guts.Idve said you didnt the day I met you.You wouldnt have been wrong.Those sharp green eyes took her measure, straight on.Yeah, I wouldve.Im coming from the outside.You formed your groupnot long before I came into it, but youd formed it.Youre the glue.Im the ...The idea surprised her into silence.Thats right.And what you said this morning, that was right.Truth is truth, even when you dont want to hear it.Everyones not going to just fall in line, because people just dont, especially people whove had their own agenda for a while.But you were right.We went out there last night and we fought off an attack.We were lucky because we werent fighting as a unit.Thats got to change, and thats something I can help with.How?Battle plans, Blondie.Training.Discipline.That sounds ...military.Thats why soldiers fight the wars.He started to flip up the lid on one of the pizza boxes.Sasha laid her hand on it, kept it closed.We eat togetherthats training, too, isnt it?Okay.Better eat inside.Storms coming in.Then lets go tell the others.She started out, looked back until he shoved away from the counter to come with her.Can I try out your other crossbow?Its got a hundred eighty pull weight.Even beefed up, you couldnt cock it.Id still like to try it.Push ups, he said.The first rumble of thunder sounded as she started up the stairs.By the time theyd all gathered around the kitchen table, the sky hung dark and broody.With the quickening flashes of lightning, the thunder rolled closer on a hard wind.Nothing like a good storm, Riley said.Unless its pizza.Even bad pizzas good.Sawyer lifted a slice, bit in.And this aint bad.Watching him, Annika picked up a slice, took a careful bite.Its wonderful.Best pizza?Where?New York, Bran said immediately, and Riley shook her head as she chowed down.This little mom and pop in a little hillside village in Tuscany.Amazing.Sash?I had some really nice pizza once in Paris.French pizza?Sawyer snorted.Forget about it.Neck and neck between New York and this trattoria in Florence.How about you?he asked Annika.This, she said, and took another bite.Kildare, Doyle said when everyone looked at him.Irish pizza?Riley grabbed another slice as she laughed.Thats below French pizza.In a restaurant run by Italians, he added.It wins because it was unexpected.Speaking of winning, Sasha put in.We should talk about the idea that we won last night because Nerezza was testing us.Doyle brought up the need for battle plans, for training.Training?Rileys eyes narrowed.Such as?Bran does what he does.Doyle took another slice from the same pie as Rileythe one loaded with sausage and pepperoni.Thats a specific skill set nobody else here can train for.But Sasha had it right.We went into last night individually.We cant risk that again.We need to know what Bran has ...up his sleeve.Youre right on that.Bran nodded, poured wine.And youll know from here and on.We need strategies and plans.If we only react, more, react individually, well lose.No argument, but what training?Riley continued.Im already working with Sasha and Annika on hand to hand, defense.And after today, we know Sashas a regular Daryl Dixon with a crossbow.Crossbow?Sawyer paused with a slice halfway to his plate.How did I miss that?Whos Daryl Dixon?Sasha asked.The Walking Dead, Sawyer supplied.You can handle a crossbow?Apparently.Handle, my ass.It was thwang!Riley mimed the shot.Bulls eye.Id stick with her in any zombie apocalypse.I appreciate that, but I think Doyle means we need to start working, and training, together.Weve made noises about being a team.We need to train like one.Brans teaching me about what he uses to make medicines, so I can help there.I could learn, Annika said.I like to learn.You should all know the basics.What potion, what salve, what tincture for what injury.You all know basic first aid of the ordinary sort, Bran added.But were not dealing with ordinary.And if youre injured, we wouldnt know what to use.Okay, Riley agreed.We take time for some magickal medicine lessons.Other skill sets have to play.You and Sawyer?Doyle shook his head, reluctant admiration.Cant say Ive ever seen better shots, and you both keep a cool head.You start target practice with the others.I dont like the guns, Annika said quickly.You dont have to like them, gorgeous, you just have to learn to handle one.And youve got some moves.Id pit her against Black Widow.Im going to buy a shitload of graphic novels for you guys, Sawyer said when both Annika and Sasha looked blank.You need to teach Sasha, refine Rileyyouve got moves of your own, but Annikas faster, smoother.Yeah?And what about you?Bran, Sawyer?Well all work on it.And on hand to hand.Training, he repeated.We need to put a couple hours a day, at least, into it.Sasha can make a schedule.I can?You started it, Blondie.You were right, now you follow it through.Riley polished off her second slice.Youve got a lot to say tonight, McCleary.Because Ive got something to say.Lightning flashed, and thunder boomed hard behind it, causing Apollo to belly under the table until his head lay on Rileys feet.Ive fought with you twice, and what Ive seen is a lot of skill, and no unity.So we hone the skills, and unite, Sawyer finished.Im behind that.On the united front, I think  			Sorry.Riley pushed up.Im going to have to eat and run.Run?Sawyer looked toward the window as the rain started in a gush.Where?To my room to start.Its nearly sundown, and since Id as soon not strip down here in the kitchen, Im going up.You can come back, Sasha told her.You dont have to stay closed in your room.Yeah, I get it, appreciate it.Im going to need to run.Storm or no storm, Ill need to run off the initial energy.Ill be back.If theres any pizza left over, Ive got dibs on it at sunrise.She grabbed a third slice and headed out with Apollo close to her side.Bran looked after her, then back at Sawyer.You were saying?Ah ...I lost track.I guess ...unity.Im all in on weapons training.Whered you get the crossbow?Doyle, Sasha told him.He has two.Ever used one?Sawyer shook his head at Doyle.But Im all about it.After last night, Im going to need more ammo.I expect Riley could use more.Looks like we need a supply list, and what we could call a supply officer.Id nominate Riley there.She has the most contacts.Supplies are more than weapons.Its food, Sasha pointed out.Household supplies.I could nominate myself.Or you.What about your kind of supplies?Sawyer asked Bran.Im taking care of it.There would be some things we can acquire as easily as household supplies, but some Im sending for.Weve picked up most of the duties around the house and grounds, but I suppose we could be more organized about it.I dont mind switching off dinner prep with Sawyer, but its nice to have a night off.Pizza night.Sawyer grinned.Once a week.Done.Bran toasted the idea.And as Sasha and Sawyer handle dinners otherwise, I propose theyre exempt from getting pizza.The rest of us can alternate that as well.I like pizza.Annika, after savoring the first, chose a second slice.I pity those who dont.As for strategies ...Bran cocked an eye at Doyle.I figure the three of us can hammer some out.Meaning the three of you.Men.Doyle shrugged at Sashas statement.Ever fought a war, Blondie?Not until now.Ever play war?Sawyer asked.As a kid?Well, no.Since Annika didnt appear to mind being dismissed, Sasha felt the burden of female pride rested fully on her shoulders.I bet Riley did.And Id wager shes been in more than a few skirmishes.Well see what she has to say about it.Now Doyle shrugged at Bran.Fine.But we have to search.Annika looked from one to the next.We cant stop.We wont be stopping, Bran assured her.But it looks as if well have more regimented days, at least for now.Ill make out my end of the supply list.Sawyer rose.But first Im going to start a fire in the other room.The storms probably dropped the temps, and were going to have a couple of wet ...canines.Ill help you.Annika rose with him.And Ill do the dishes.It should be my turn.Happy to pass that duty off, Sasha sat back with her wine.And whats my assignment?Youd be the best to keep track of needed household supplies.And I think Doyle will agree you can be trusted to write out tasks and schedules in a fair way.We never followed through there.And Id say the training schedule should be yours, Doyle.Well want an early start, as one of us has one more day that ends at sundown.What sort of early start?Sasha wondered.Sunup.Calisthenics.You want to beef up, thats how you start.Then breakfastplenty of carbs for you.Id say we need a day here, forming those strategies, starting weapons trainingbefore we go back out to dive.When Sawyer finishes building his fire, we could start outlining some basic plans.Attack as well as defense.Doyle got up.Im going to take a walk first.Its storming, Sasha reminded him.I dont mind getting wet.Hell go up, Bran said after Doyle walked out, and get his sword as well as his coat.And hell walk the perimeter, well call it.And do the same again around midnight.Theres a soldier in him.Oh, without question.But hes not ready to tell us about it.Sawyers ready.He had something to tell us before Riley interrupted and had to go.Do you think so?Im sure of it.I dont know what, but hes ready to tell us the something more.Bran.He smiled.Sasha.Theres another kind of training I need, and I think you can help me.Not that, she said with a laugh when he grinned at her.Well, that, too.We can call that training.But I need to learn how to open more to what I have.You already are.I knew about the crossbow because I watched you.Not a moments hesitation in you.You took it, and used it.Because you knew.Not deliberately.I didnt know deliberately, and thats what I want.I dont think Ill ever control this, not completely.I dont think Im meant to.But if Im to really do my part in all this, I need to have some control.Ive spent so many years trying to suppress it, and now I want to use it.Can you help?I think I can.Good.Im going to go up, work out the supplies, the assignments.And leave you men to your war council.He grabbed her hand before she walked by, kissed it.Therell be six sitting on that council before this is done.This is only the start.So well start with the soldier, the sharpshooter, and the magician.It would be stupid to object.Add the lycan, because I think youve the right of that.And it mollified.Should I wait in my room or yours?Make your choice.Ill find you.When she left, he thought hed already found her.And that, like Doyles exceptional pizza in Kildare, was unexpected.She went to her room, changed into loose cotton pants.She decided shed do an actual chart for the task schedule, with names, days of the week, and appropriate chores and errands.Before she got started she walked to the terrace doors, opened them to the sound of the storm.And saw the shadow of the wolf.She caught the scream, swallowed it back.God.You scared me, Riley.She took a deep breath because her voice had trembled.I dont know if you understand me.Thats a question we shouldve asked.And when the wolf strolled into her room, she swallowed again.I guess that answers that.Id offer to towel you off, but that just seems really strange.Stranger.Ah, Sawyer started a fire for you downstairs.Hes sweet that way, and thought of it.The wolf simply stood, watching her.Unnerving, Sasha thought, to look at the wolfsleek and wet and fierceand see Rileys eyes.You should try to get some sleep tonightI dont know if thats how it works, but if you can, you should get some sleep.Doyle called for calisthenics at dawn.At this, the wolf growled low.Okay, you definitely understand me.It actually makes sense, as a whole.Im going to do a household supply list, and task assignments.And were going to start the trainingby skill settomorrow.The men are going to get together down in the kitchen, talk battle strategies.The growl came again, and now the wolf paced.Yeah, I had the same reaction, except youre invited onto the war council.When the wolf stopped pacing, Sasha nodded.Right.We figured you had some experience where Annika and I dont.But we will.Were going to take tomorrow, seeing as you have to make it a short day, to start putting the training together.See, it makes sense.She wasnt sure if the sound the wolf made was agreement or resignation, but it wasnt quite a growl.You should go down, get warm and dry.You might not be able to add anything to the strategy session, but you can listen.The wolf walked to the door.Sasha followed, opened it.Ill see you in the morning.She closed the door quietly on what she decided was the strangest conversation shed ever had.Suddenly, it struck her.Could she sense Rileys feelingsin wolf form?Feelings echoed thoughts.So if she could, there could be more of a conversation.Shed ask Riley if she was open to trying it.But for now, with the storm blowing out to sea, she got her supplies, and began creating a chart.She did a draft, edited it, re edited it.It took longer than shed imagined.She finished it, perfected it, then wrote out a supply list with a lot less fuss.Done, she forced herself to put in fifteen minutes with Rileys bands, and tried some push ups.She would get stronger.Still alone, she slid into bed with her sketch pad.And fell asleep with a half dozen sketches of the wolf on her page.When Bran slipped in beside her, she sensed his warmth, turned to him.Its late.He brushed his lips over her brow.Sleep.So she slept on, and dreamed of a room lined in gold and silver, studded with jewels, mirror bright.She dreamed of the god who sat on her golden throne, staring into those jewels, her beauty dark and unearthly.The reflections, dozens and dozens, covered those walls, and were wizened, hideous, twisted.On the gods scream of rage, the jewels shattered.And the walls ran with blood.SIXTEEN     			Rising at dawn was one thing.Rising at dawn for some yoga stretching was actually rather pleasant.But following that rather pleasant stretching by being whipped into squats and lunges changed the entire complexion.She kept up, well enough, but squats, lunges, jumping jacks with Annika smiling, even letting out an occasional laugh, as she herself struggled through themwithout even a single hit of coffeemade Sasha want to try out her right jab on her friends beautiful face.Then came the dreaded push ups.She was the only one of the six who couldnt manage more than two.One and a half if she was honest.Even with her knees down in what Riley called (with a definite sneer) girl push ups, she struggled.She would get stronger.Pull upsnot even one.Crunches until her abs screamed.More stretchingthank Godthen a jog down the cliff steps, along the beach, then back.Where she just collapsed on the grass in a gasping heap.I hate you.She could barely pant it out.Especially Doyle, but all of you.Thats a start.Whos on breakfast detail?Doyle asked.The charts in my room.Someone who can still walk should go get it.Ill get it.Annika, barely winded, dashed off.From her prone position, Sasha bared her teeth.Maybe I hate her even more than Doyle.Moaning, she rolled over, made herself stand on wobbly, vibrating legs.Actively scowled when Annika bounced back with the chart.I cook with Sawyer today.I can make the coffee.I know how.Its so pretty!She turned the chart around for all to see.Sasha had color coded it, and since shed been in a fine mood before this mornings torture, had illustrated the chart.Pretty little drawings of pots and pans, a lawn mower, a garden, pecking chickens, the pool, and so onalong with sketches of everyone beside their names.I want that, Sawyer said immediately.I want that when were done.It goes in the kitchen for now, but Im calling dibs.Lets go cook, Annika.Can I break the eggs?she asked as they headed toward the villa.It looks like fun.Theres a woman who makes her own fun.Lets find out if she can make coffee.Hold on a minute, Doyle said to Riley.You got any Tai Chi?Riley tapped her right fist to her open left palm.Sure.Take Sasha through a beginners session.What!Why?No.Though it shamed her, Sasha was weak enough to look at Bran for help.But he only smiled, gave her arm an encouraging pat.Itll help with your balance and centering, Doyle said.You want to catch up with everyone else, you need a little extra.Twenty minutes should do it.How about you show me some of what youve put together, he said to Bran, while theyre cooking.All right.Bran took Sashas face, kissed her lightly.Twenty minutes, he repeated, and left her.I want coffee, Sasha insisted.I want to sit down.I think I want my mommy.Theres no whining in Tai Chi.Feet slightly apart, knees loose.Breathe from here.She slapped a hand on Sashas aching abs.Oh, God.You wanted a unit, Sash.Looks like youve got one.It hurts.No pain, no gain, Riley shot back with merciless cheer.Ill go over philosophy later, because I damn well want coffee, too, but for now, breathe in from your center, and do what I do.At least the movements were slow, and she had to admire Rileys fluidity as she tried to mimic them.But that didnt stop her quads from aching like rotted teeth.By the time she sat down she could have wept and whimpered for coffee, but she damn well knew where her center was as it quivered from exhaustion and begged for food.Sawyer produced a platter with a golden mountain of pancakes.Where shed usually have eaten one, she ate three, actually contemplated a fourth before she decided it might make her sick.Doyle looked across the table at her.Youre up.I dont want to be up.Maybe not ever again.I believe he means your clever and creative chart.Bran gestured to where Annika had propped it on a chair, like another team member.Oh.Well.Ive got me and Bran on cleanup, Riley on Apollo and chickens.Wolf in the henhouse.Riley sent Sawyer a sharp, sweet smile.Youre a barrel of monkeys.Annika and I hit the garden to weed and harvest, Sasha continued.Im on the pool, Brans on the lawn mower.Annikas on laundry.Sawyer grinned at the chart.Leaves Riley and Doyle on the supply run.I think I like the pictures of the bag of groceries and boxes of ammo best.Give me ten for the cluckers, another ten to grab a shower.Riley downed the rest of her coffee.Another five to make a call, see where well find the best place for the ammo.The household supply list is on the dresser in my room.Nodding at Sasha, Riley pushed away from the table.Got it.Fifteen tops, she said and jogged off.How could she jog, Sasha wondered bitterly, to deal with the chickens?Might as well grab a swim before I play pool boy.Doyle rose as Sawyer did.Fifteen minutes to add anything to the supply list, otherwise, you get what you get.Annika sat a moment after the others left, then looked apologetically at Sasha.I dont know how to laundry.Can you teach me?Go ahead.Bran waved them away.Ive got this.* * *  			By the time shed finished giving Annika a lesson on separating clothes, water temperatures, cycles, hed nearly finished the dishes.So she and her partner for the morning went out to the garden with hoes, rakes, shears, and a plastic tub from the shed.They worked with Annika happily humming.She could hear the rumble of the lawn mower, the drone of bees, and the swish of the sea at the base of the cliff.All so normal, Sasha thought, so everyday.Anyone looking at the picture would see a group of people tending to household chores.But they were far more.She bided her time, noting that Annika caught on quickly to hoeing out the weeds, just as shed caught on quickly to the basics of doing laundry.But shed clearly done neither before.So you have six sisters, Sasha began.Yes.You must miss them.I do, but Im happy here.Even though we have to fight, and some of the work is hard.Six sisters, Sasha repeated.And youve never done laundry before.Today Im doing laundry.So you had staff?Obviously puzzled, Annika straightened, mimed holding a tall stick.Staff?Not that kind.People.People who do things like laundry and cooking and cleaning.Oh.Were staff now.Annika bent back to her weeding, avoiding Sashas eye.Youve never really said where you live.Annika weeded another moment, then stopped, turned to face Sasha again.Will you be my friend?I am your friend.Will you be my friend and not ask what I cant tell you?I can promise, I have nothing bad.Its ...Like an oath.Yes.All right.Annika reached out to take Sasha into a hug.Thank you.You taught me laundry.She eased back, smiling.Ill teach you how to ...Bending over, she lifted her legs into a ridiculously fluid handstand.I think thats going to take a lot longer than teaching you how to do laundry.Ill teach you.Annika dropped down again.And well find the stars.When we do, and theyre where they belong, I can tell you everything.All right.And whatever it is, were still going to be friends.After gardening and laundry, after supplies were put away and they ate the gyros Riley brought back from the village, Sasha had her first lesson in gun safety.A very patient Sawyer spent considerable time with her and Annikathe only ones whod never fired a gunshowing them how to load, unload, reload, how to sight, how to use the safety, how to take it off.As instructed, Annika slapped the magazine into one of Sawyers 9 mms.I dont like it.It feels cold and mean.You dont have to like it.You have to respect it.A lot of GSWs are accidents, from carelessness.Gunshot wounds, he explained.People who dont learn how to properly handle a gun, who dont properly secure it when not in use.Some insist guns dont kill.People do.But guns do kill, and knowing that, respecting that, is really important.Did this gun kill someone?No.But I know it can.I know I can.If theres no choice.He looked down to where the others had set up a temporary target range, with paper targets over a thick sheet of wood.Time to try them out.Safeties on.Sasha didnt like the feel of the gun any more than Annika, but she carried it down to the range, where Riley took over the lesson.Were going to start with stance and grip.Basic Weaver stance, she told Sawyer, Two handed grip.When she demonstrated, Annika shook her head.Sawyer shoots the gun with one hand.And when you can shoot like Dead Eye here, be my guest.For now, two hands.Your dominant hand presses the weapon forward slightly, and the other draws it back.Balancing.Thisll help you with the recoil.Dominant foot back and to the side, the other forward, knee bent.Most of the weights on your front foot.She had them practice, again and again, getting into position, lifting an unloaded weapon to eye level.Okay.Who wants to shoot first?Sasha does, Annika said immediately.Okay.Load it like I showed you, Sawyer told her.When she had, Riley stepped behind her.Take your time, take your stance, raise your weapon.She laid a hand on Sashas back.Dont hold your breath when you squeeze the trigger.Squeeze it, slow and smooth and let your breath out.She did, felt the kick all the way to her shoulder, and the force of it, the sound of it like a punch in the heart.She didnt miss the target entirely, but put a bullet in the second ring in, to the right.Not bad.Adjust your stance, relax your shoulders.Try it again.The next shot hit higher, and still well to the right of center.Youre pulling it to the right.Think about that, fire again.Lower this time, Sasha noted, and another ring closer.She fired several more, never hit center, but shot what Riley called a decent grouping.She stepped aside, more than happy to unload and set the gun down, so Annika could step to the line.Riley adjusted her stance, her grip, then stepped back.Annika fired when told, missed the paper target, plowed a bullet into the wood.Okay.Its okay.Dont hold your breath.Dont close your eyes.Eyes on the target this time, and squeeze the trigger.She did, hit the white of the paper, then lowered the gun.I wont learn this.Im sorry.Deliberately she unloaded, handed the gun carefully to Sawyer.Im sorry, I cant learn this.Ill work harder, and Ill fight, but I cant do this.It feels evil in my hand.Im sorry.Its okay.Hey, dont, he said quickly when her eyes welled with tears.Well find something else for you.No guns.He looked meaningfully at Doyle.She doesnt have to use a gun.Her call.Yeah, it is.See that.Sawyer holstered the weapon, put an arm around her shoulders.Your call.Im going to fold the laundry.Sasha showed me how.Im going to go fold the laundry.Well think of something else, Sawyer said to the group when she dashed off.I might be able to come up with something.Bran looked after her.Something that would give her a weapon, a defense, and not upset her.Let me work on it.* * *  			By the time theyd concluded what Sasha thought of as Weaponry 101, she found all the laundry finished, foldedand her own share neatly stacked on her bed.And the house sparkled.She found Annika in the kitchen, diligently unloading the dishwasher.I cleaned the house.Ill say.Im sorry.You need to stop being sorry.No ones mad at you.I didnt do my task.Because its wrong, for you.Everyone understands.Sasha thought of her sore and aching muscles, weighed them against friendship.You said youd teach me the handstand.You could give me a couple private lessons before you work with everyone.Give me aha haleg up.Yes, I can.I will.How about now?She failed, and even when Annika held her legs, Sashas arms and shoulder muscles quivered and pinged like plucked harp strings.During the group lesson, after multiple face and/or ass plants, she was relegated to practicing simple forward and backward rolls.She would get stronger.She would get better.Deeming herself finished, she took her aches and pings off for a soak in the hot tub.She considered doing laps, as Doyle had suggested, but the way her arms and legs felt, shed probably sink straight to the bottom of the pool and drown.Besides, shed damn well earned a break.She hit the jetsahhadjusted her sunglasses.Shed just sunk down to her chin when she saw Annika and Riley coming her way.She liked their company, but at the moment shed have preferred the moans she knew would come to be a private thing.Riley set a pitcher of margaritas on the table, poured three glasses.And Annika held up a small bottle.Bran said to add this to the water.What is it?Lavender and rosemary and ...She looked to Riley.Magic.He said it would take care of any muscle soreness.Dump it in, Anni.Were going to test it out.Riley handed Sasha a glass.Im not sore.But Annika poured in the pale green liquid.She tempts me to say fuck you.Riley boosted herself into the tub.Consider it said.Sasha closed her eyes, sipped the frothy drink.She heard the splash as Annika chose the pool instead.I hurt everywhere, and its worse knowing Im going to be squatting and lunging and running at dawn tomorrow.Add in upper body work.Sasha slitted her eyes open.Consider it repeated in your direction.Well be diving tomorrow, so thatll mix things up.And maybe well get lucky.I left Sawyer and Doyle working out where.Bran?He got a brainstorm about Annikas deal, so he went up to work on it.Sasha decided shed go up and help him with it.Eventually.God, this smells so good.Why dont I have one of these at home?A hot tub, or a hot magician to make you magic hot tub potions?She smiled to herself.Both.Bet you could get both.Bran, in my little house in the mountains?He has New York, and Ireland.My place is so isolated, so quiet, and hes ...hes larger than life, isnt he?All that power.He banks itthats controlbut its huge, and passionate, and more than could be satisfied living in a little house in North Carolina.Will you be, once were done with what were here for?I dont know anymore.And that shifted her balance.But I think Ill always need a quiet place to go, to live, to paint.Ill never block what I have again, or feel I have to be alone.I know more about myself, what Im capable of.I know what it is to be a part of something really important.Something worth fighting for.And when I look at myself now ...The mirror sees the truth, hard and bare.What she fears and fights against lives in the glass.And there lies her end, one only the stars can change.She fears her end.She came back to herself with Riley gripping her arm to keep her head above water and calling for Annika.Im all right.Im okay.Take a hit.Riley pushed the glass back in her hand.I saved it when it started to tip out of your hand.Sasha shook her head, let out a breath.Give me a second.The waters too hot, and youre pale.Come, cool off in the pool.Good thinking.With a nod to Annika, Riley put the glass aside, pulled Sasha to her feet.Out and in, pal.She obeyed, as she did feel too hot, and somehow too ...loose.The cooler water of the pool helped offset the dizziness so she was able to climb out again on her own.Do you remember what you said?Riley asked her.Yes.About a mirror, about the truth in it.Im not sure what it means.We should go in, Annika decided.Out of the sun.Yes, Sasha thought.Shed get out of her wet bathing suit, take a moment or two to settle.One good thing.She rolled her shoulders before wrapping herself in a towel.I dont ache anymore.Though she brushed off the offers to help her change, she realized theyd gone straight to Bran when he walked in before shed buttoned up a dry shirt.Let me look at you.Im all right.They didnt have to interrupt you for this.He simply put his hands on her shoulders, took a long study of her face.No headache?No.I didnt try to block it.It comes on in a waveand it leaves me a little shaky, but it didnt hurt.You were right about that.Describe what happened.Riley and I were in the hot tubAnnika put your potion in the water.Wonderful, by the way.I was relaxed, and we were just talking about ...She adjusted here.She certainly wasnt going to bring up Rileys suggestion hed come live with her in North Carolina.Talking about what?How I knew myself better since all this started, and knew what it was to be part of something.Then it was that wave again.Its like being pulled by an undertow.But this time, I tried to go with it instead of fighting to stay up.What did you see?I She broke off at the knock on her door.Are you okay in there?Sawyer called out.Yes.Im coming down.I need to organize my thoughts, she said to Bran.All right.He ran his hand over her damp hair.Well go down.Theyd already gathered on the terrace, so she sat, took a breath.Im sorry because I dont really understand what I meant, what I saw.It might have been a room, it might have been a cave.Everything was gold and silver and shining.Like a really elegant house of mirrors.It was like I was standing there in it, but I couldnt see myself.Then I picked up a mirrorbut it wasnt my hand.I think it was hers.Nerezza.She picked up this jeweled mirror, but when she looked in it, what looked back was not just old.Ancient.Gray and withered.Sunken eyes, thin gray hair.Hardly more than a skull.Nothing else reflected.The glass around that image was pure black.The glass shattered, and that face was in all the shards, hundreds of shards.And the shards went to smoke, and it all went dark.You said the mirror sees the truth, Riley reminded her.I know.An allegory?Sawyer suggested.Shes ancient, being a godbut the mirror sees her soul or heart or whatever you want to call it as withered and dark?We dont need a seer to know that, Doyle pointed out.Maybe shes got a Dorian Gray thing going.Struck, Riley pointed a finger at him.And the mirror reflects what she really is.It ages, shows her sins and all that while she stays young and beautiful.Its a theory.A good one.If there actually is a mirror, and we destroyed itthere lies her end.I dont know.What I saw ...She destroyed the mirror.Shed hardly end herself.Another mirror, another glass, Bran suggested.Ill do some digging on it.Riley picked up her margarita again.You said only the stars could change it.We can speculate thats another reason she wants them so bad.Theres a way to end hernot just stop her, but end her.And if she gets the stars, the ways done.Ill do some checking on mirror spells, Bran added.The stars remain first priority.Have you two chosen where we dive tomorrow?Doyle nodded.We mapped out routes to three caves.We should be able to do all three, but we can hit two for certain.Youll want to get a meal in before sunset, he said to Riley, so  			Before we get into that, Sawyer interrupted.And whatever else is on todays agenda, Ive got something I need to explain.I needed to talk to my family first.My grandfather especially.Regarding the compass, Bran said.Yeah, that.Theres a little more to it.He took it out of his pocket.Using it with a map can show you where you should go, for what you need or want.But it can do more than show you.Even without a map.Like what?Riley demanded.Well.Like this.Sawyer held the compass out in his palm.And vanished.What the holy fuck!As Riley swore, Annika jumped to her feet.Where did he go?Where is he?Up here.Sawyer called from the terrace, waved.Then vanished only to reappear in his seat at the table.Youre a magician, too!No.Its the compass, he told Annika.Its linked to me, yeah, but its the compass.I just gave it where I wanted to goan easy oneto the terrace up there, and back here.Thats more than a little.Doyle held out a hand, examined the compass when Sawyer gave it to him.How is it linked to you?Whoever holds it can pass it to another.Not like I just did to you.Its a formal deal.Its mine until I pass it to the next.Traditionally a son or daughter.You really save on airfare, Riley commented.Ha.Yeah, its handy there.Theres actually a little more.He took it back from Doyle, turned it over, ran his finger around the circumference.A second lid opened to reveal a clockface.Man!You are not going to tell me its like a time machine.Sawyer gave Riley a weak smile.Sort of.She leaped up, did a dance.Oh, my Jesus, the places I could go, see.Mayans, Aztecs, Celts.The land bridge, the freaking pyramids.Where When have you been?Not that far back.Look, youve got to take a lot of care when you use it to time or place shift.A lot of care.Say you get an urge to watch the gunfight at the O. K.  Corral.First, youre dressed all wrong, and somebodys going to notice.More, what if you drop down in the middle of the road and a wagon runs over you?Or you get hit by a stray bullet?Even if you live through it, youve changed something.And that can change something else, so when you come back its not exactly the way you left it.Now youve got to go back and fix it.Space time continuum.Got that, but you went there, right?Got a look at the Earps and Doc Holliday.Yeah, and let me say it was fast and uglythe gunfight.Time shiftings tricky, and you learn really fastbecause youre taught and trained, but you have to learn by mucking upnot to use it for entertainment.How far?Doyle asked.How far back can you go?I dont know if theres a limit.Ive heard storiesI was weaned on themof people who didnt come back.The compass always comes back, but some of the ones who held it havent.Because maybe they went too far, or they ended up miscalculating time or place just enough to end up in the ocean or in the middle of a battlefield, an earthquake.And forward?Bran asked him.Is that part of it?Even trickier.You want to see how things are going a hundred years from now?What if eighty years from now things went really bad?You figure to hit in Times Square, but instead theres nothing.Or you drop down in the middle of a war, a plague.Even something as basic as that forest meadow is now a five lane superhighway and youre pancaked.You can calculate pretty well going back, but forward?You cant calculate what hasnt happened.Sawyer closed the lid on the clockface.Ive gone back and sideways and around in circles trying to get a handle on what were after.Before I got here, before I met any of you.Id get bits and pieces, variations on the legend or the mythology, but nothing solid.And when the compass pointed me here, and now, thats where I came.Annika touched his hand lightly.Are you from now?Yeah.Born twenty nine years ago.And listen, if I knew how to get back to the when and where all this started, maybe Id risk it.But thats more than Ive been able to do.And if I could, I dont know if theres anything I could do anyway.Can you take anyone with you?Yeah.I took my brother back to Dodger Stadium to see Jackie Robinson play.It was his birthdaymy brothersand my grandfather okayed it.But Ive only tried it with one person.Theoretically, I could take more.We dont talk about this outside the family, he continued.Its like your deal, Riley, sort of.I went over this with my grandfather and I was going to bring it up last night.But you had to wolf out.Huh.Something like this gets out and youve got all kinds of crap to deal with.This asshole got wind of it, and hes been on my ass for five years now.Son of a bitch tried to ambush me last year in Morocco where I was following a lead.Gave up trying to buy it, and tried to shoot me instead.Fucking Malmon.Wait a minute.Wait.Teeth bared, Riley leaned forward.Andre Malmon?Yeah.You know him?I know him.Likes to bill himself as a rescuer of artifacts, as an expert on mythology, a consultant, adventurer, whatever suits his needs.Hes a thief, a cheat, and I cant prove it, but I know he killed an associate of mine.Hes onto youto this?she added, tapping the compass.Yeah, he is.I lost him after Morocco.He wont give up easy.Ill make some calls, see if I can find out where he is.If hes anywhere close, we need to defend against him as much as Nerezza.Does he know about the stars?Bran asked her.Malmon knows something about everything.She picked up her drink, scowled into it.Son of a bitch Malmon.If he gets wind youre here, Sawyer, that I am, that we areunless hes hot on somebody elses ass, hell be all over us.Hed slit your throat for that compass.Yeah, I got that loud and clear in Morocco.For the stars?She drained the rest of her drink.Hed gut every single one of us.Then wed better find them first.Doyle rose.Im getting a beer.Bring some for the rest of the class.Bran turned to Riley.Tell us about Malmon.Smartplenty of letters after his name.But more, hes ruthless.Hes got plenty of scratch.He had a ...Annika scratched her fingers along her arm.Noits another word for money, and hes got piles of it.Big load of family money, then whatever he can steal.Hell take any contract if it pays enough.My sources say hes the one who arranged to abduct the white rhinonorthern species, critically endangeredout of the conservancy in Kenya.Left two people dead.Nobody could prove it, and theyve never found the rhino.Why would anyone steal a rhinoceros?Sasha wondered.Because somebody paid him, a whole bunch of a lot.Most likely somebody just as rich and just as vicious as he is who wanted to hunt it.A lot of sick bastards get off hunting rare and endangereds.She shook her head at the beer Doyle brought back.If he knew what I was, he wouldnt rest until hed locked me in a cage and sold me to the highest bidder.Anyway.She pushed that away.Hes mid forties, has bases in New York, Paris, Dubai, an estate in Devon.Probably more.French father, Brit mother, raised primarily in England, from what I know again.If I had to label him, Id go with narcissistic sociopath.Hes got mercs and a couple exSpecial Forces on his regular payroll, and picks up freelancers for specific jobs.But he doesnt mind getting his hands dirty, or bloody.My take is he enjoys it.My friend had contacted me, way juiced.Told me he was dead sure hed found Carnwennan, asked me to head to Cornwall, help him verify.She changed her mind on the beer, took one after all.Whats Carnwennan?Sasha asked her.King Arthurs dagger.Plenty in my line believe it pure myth.I dont happen to agree, and WestleDr.Westlededicated most of his professional career to Arthurian pursuits.When he said hed found it, I believed him.It took me a couple of days to wrap up what I was doing and get to him.When I did, he was dead.Garrotedbut not before hed been tortured, not before his lab was trashed and torchedand him with it.No sign of Carnwennan, of course, or any of his notes, any of the other artifacts hed found.Malmon was spotted in Falmouth, and thats not coincidence.She got up.Im going to make those calls, see if I can find out where he is and what hes up to.And well deal with him, if and when, Bran said when Riley walked off.Him, his mercenaries, and hired guns, Doyle added with a glance at Annika.As if shed waited for a cue, she sprang up into a series of flips across the table, and ended braced on her hands with the heel of her left foot a bare inch from Doyles face.He laughed, so quick, deep, appreciative, that Rileyfrom several feet away, glanced back in his direction.Okay, gorgeous.You know how to prove your point.I can fight.She did a fluid roll off the table to land lightly on her feet.Im working on something for you.In fact, I should get back to it.Now Bran rose.But I need something from you first.I have coinsand the ...the scratch Riley gave me for some of them.No, mo chro.He took a small vial from his pocket.I need just three drops of your blood.My .
