Come on!she whined, tugging on my arm.I stood up with mild resistance as she pulled me from the room.Finally, Kara said.We pulled up to Travis apartment, and I noted that the Harley was parked under the stairs, and that Shepleys Charger was missing.I breathed a sigh of relief, and followed America up the icy steps.Careful, she warned.If Id known how unsettling it would be to step foot in the apartment again, I wouldnt have let America talk me into going there.Toto scampered around the corner at full speed, crashing into my legs when his tiny paws failed to get traction on the entryway tile.I picked him up, letting him greet me with his baby kisses.At least he hadnt forgotten me.I carried him around the apartment, waiting while America searched for her bag.I know I left it here!she said from the bathroom, stomping down the hall to Shepleys room.Did you look in the cabinet under the sink?Shepley asked.I looked at my watch.Hurry, Mare.We need to get going.America sighed in frustration from the bedroom.I looked down at my watch again, and then jumped when the front door burst open behind me.Travis stumbled in, his arms wrapped around Megan, who was giggling against his mouth.A box in her hand caught my eye, and I felt sick when I realized what it was: condoms.Her other hand was on the back of his neck, and I couldnt tell whose arms were tangled around who.Travis did a double take when he saw me standing alone in the middle of the living room, and when he froze, Megan looked up with a residual smile still on her face.Pigeon, Travis said, stunned.Found it!America said, jogging out of Shepleys room.What are you doing here?he asked.The stench of whiskey blew in with the flurry of snowflakes, and my uncontrollable anger overcame any need to feign indifference.Its good to see youre feeling like your old self, Trav, I said.The heat that radiated from my face burned my eyes and blurred my vision.We were just leaving, America snarled, grabbing my hand as we slid passed Travis.We flew down the steps toward her car, and I was thankful that it was just a few steps further, feeling the tears well up in my eyes.I almost fell backward when my coat snagged on something mid step.Americas hand slipped from mine and she flipped around the same time I did.Travis fist gripping my coat, and my ears caught fire, stinging in the cold night air.His lips and collar were a ridiculous shade of deep red.Where are you going?he said, a half drunk, half confused look in his eyes.Home, I snapped, straightening my coat when he released me.What are you doing here?I could hear the packed snow crunch under Americas feet as she walked up behind me, and Shepley flew down the stairs to stand behind Travis, his wary eyes fixed on his girlfriend.Im sorry.If Id know you were going to be here, I wouldnt have come.He shoved his hands in his coat pockets.You can come here anytime you want, Pidge.I never wanted you to stay away.I couldnt manage the acidity in my voice.I dont want to interrupt.I looked to the top of the stairs where Megan stood with a smug expression.Enjoy your evening, I said, turning away.He grabbed my arm.Wait.Youre mad?I yanked my coat from his grip.You knowI dont even know why Im surprised.His eyebrows pulled in.I cant win with you.I cant win with you!You say youre doneIm fucking miserable over here!I had to break my phone into a million pieces to keep from calling you every minute of the damn day  Ive had to play it off like everything is just fine at school so you can be happyand youre fucking mad at me?You broke my fuckin heart!His last words echoed into the night.Travis, youre drunk.Let Abby go home, Shepley said.Travis grabbed my shoulders and pulled me to him.Do you want me, or not?You cant keep doing this to me, Pidge!I didnt come here to see you.I said, glaring up at him.I dont want her, he said, staring at my lips.Im just so fucking unhappy, Pigeon.His eyes glossed over and he leaned in, tilting his head to kiss me.I grabbed him by the chin, holding him back.Youve got her lipstick on your mouth, Travis, I said, disgusted.He took a step back and lifted his shirt, wiping his mouth.He stared at the red streaks on the white fabric and shook his head.I just wanted to forget.Just for one fuckin night.I wiped an escaped tear.Then dont let me stop you.I tried to retreat to the Honda, but Travis grabbed my arm again.In the next moment, America was wildly hitting his arm with her fists.He looked at her, blinking for a moment in stunned disbelief.She balled up her fists and pounded them against his chest until he released me.Leave her alone, you bastard!Shepley grabbed her and she pushed him away, turning to slap Travis face.The sound of her hand against his cheek was quick and loud, and I flinched with the noise.Everyone froze for a moment, shocked at Americas sudden rage.Travis frowned, but he didnt defend himself.Shepley grabbed her again, holding her wrists and pulled her to her car while she thrashed about.She fought him, her blonde hair whipping around with her attempts to get away.I was amazed at her determination to get at Travis.Pure hate glowed in her usually sweet, carefree eyes.How could you?She deserved better from you, Travis!America, STOP!Shepley yelled, louder than Id ever heard him.Her arms fell to her side as she glared at Shepley with incredulity.Youre defending him?Although he seemed nervous, he stood his ground.Abby broke up with him.Hes just trying to move on.Her eyes narrowed and she pulled her arm from his grip.Well then why dont you go find a random WHORE, she looked at Megan, from the Red and bring her home to fuck, and then let me know if it helps you get over me.Mare, Shepley grabbed for her but she evaded him, slamming the door as she sat behind the wheel.I sat beside her, trying not to look at Travis.Baby, dont leave, Shepley begged, leaning down into the window.She started the car.There is a right side and a wrong side here, Shep.And you are on the wrong side.Im on your side, he said, his eyes desperate.Not anymore, youre not, she said, backing out.America?America!Shepley called after her as she raced to the road, leaving him behind.I sighed.Mare, you cant break up with him over this.Hes right.America put her hand on mine and squeezed.No hes not.Nothing about what just happened was right.When we pulled into the parking lot beside Morgan, Americas phone rang.She rolled her eyes as she answered.I dont want you calling me anymore.I mean it, Shep, she said.No youre notbecause I dont want you to, thats why.You cant defend what hes done, you cant condone him hurting Abby like that and be with methats exactly what I mean, Shepley!It doesnt matter!You dont see Abby screwing the first guy she sees!Its not Travis thats the problem, Shepley.He didnt ask you to defend him!UghIm done talking about this.Dont call me again.Goodbye.She shoved her way out of the car and stomped across the road and up the steps.I tried to keep in step with her, waiting to hear the other side of the conversation.When her phone rang again, she turned it off.Travis made Shep take Megan home.He wanted to come by on his way back.You should let him, Mare.No.Youre my best friend.I cant stomach what I saw tonight, and I cant be with someone that will defend it.End of conversation, Abby, I mean it.I nodded and she hugged my shoulders, pulling me against her side as we walked up the stairs to our rooms.Kara was already asleep, and I skipped the shower, crawling into bed fully dressed, coat and all.I couldnt stop thinking about Travis stumbling in the door with Megan, or the red lipstick smeared across his face.I tried to block out the sickening images of what would have happened had I not been there, and I crossed over several emotions, settling on despair.Shepley was right.I had no right to be angry, but it didnt help to ignore the pain.Finch shook his head when I sat in the desk beside him.I knew that I looked awful; I barely had the energy to change clothes and brush my teeth.I had only slept an hour the night before, unable to shake the sight of the red lipstick on Travis mouth or the guilt over Shepley and Americas break up.America chose to stay in bed, knowing once the anger subsided, depression would set in.She loved Shepley, and although she was determined to end things because he had picked the wrong side, she was prepared to suffer the backlash of her decision.After class, Finch walked with me to the cafeteria.As I had feared, Shepley was waiting at the door for America.When he saw me, he didnt hesitate.Wheres Mare?She didnt go to class this morning.Shes in her room?he said, turning for Morgan.Im sorry, Shepley, I called after him.He froze and wheeled around, with the face of a man that had reached his limit.I wish you and Travis would just get your shit together!Youre a goddamn tornado!When youre happy, its love and peace and butterflies.When youre pissed, you take the whole fucking world down with you!He stomped away and I exhaled the breath I was holding.That went well.Finch pulled me into the cafeteria.The whole world.Wow.Think you could work your voodoo before the test on Friday?Ill see what I can do.Finch chose a different table, and I was more than happy to follow him there.Travis sat with his frat brothers, but he didnt get a tray and he didnt stay long.He noticed me just as he was leaving, but he didnt stop.So America and Shepley broke up, too, huh?Finch asked while he chewed.We were at Sheps last night and Travis came home with Megan andit was a mess.They took sides.Ouch.Exactly.I feel terrible.Finch patted my back.You cant control the decisions they make, Abby.So I guess this means we get to skip the Valentines thing at Sig Tau?Looks that way.Finch smiled.Ill still take you out.Ill take you and Mare both out.Itll be fun.I leaned on his shoulder.Youre the best, Finch.I hadnt thought about Valentines, but I was glad I had plans.I couldnt imagine how miserable I would feel spending it with America alone, hearing her rant about Shepley and Travis all night.She would still do that  she wouldnt be America if she didnt  but at least it would be a limited tirade if we were in public.The weeks of January passed, and after a commendable but failed attempt by Shepley to get America back, I saw less and less of both him and Travis.By February, they stopped coming to the cafeteria all together, and I only saw Travis a handful of times on my way to class.The weekend before Valentines Day, America and Finch talked me into going to the Red, and the entire drive to the club, I dreaded seeing Travis there.We walked in, and I sighed with relief to see no sign of him.First rounds on me, Finch said, pointing out a table and sliding through the crowd to the bar.We sat down and watched as the dance floor went from being empty to overflowing with drunken college students.After our fifth round, Finch pulled us to the dance floor, and I finally felt relaxed enough to have a good time.We giggled and bumped against each other, laughing hysterically when a man swung his dance partner around and she missed his hand, sliding across the floor on her side.America raised her hands above her head, shaking her curls to the music.I laughed at her signature dance face and then stopped abruptly when I saw Shepley walk up behind her.He whispered something in her ear and she flipped around.They traded words and then America grabbed my hand, leading me to our table.Of course.The one night we go out, and he shows up, she grumbled.Finch brought us two more drinks, including a shot each.I thought you might need them.You thought right.America tilted her head back before we could toast and I shook my head, clinking my glass to Finchs.I tried to keep my eyes on my friends faces, worried that with Shepley being there, Travis wouldnt be far behind.Another song came over the speakers and America stood up.Fuck it.Im not sitting at this table the rest of the night.Atta girl!Finch smiled, following her to the dance floor.I followed them, glancing around for Shepley.He had disappeared, and I relaxed again, trying to shake off the feeling that Travis would show up on the dance floor with Megan.A boy Id seen around campus danced behind America, and she smiled, welcoming the distraction.I had a suspicion that she was making a show of enjoying herself, in hopes that Shepley would see.I looked away for a second, and when I looked back to America, her dance partner was gone.She shrugged, continuing to shake her hips to the beat.The next song began to play and a different boy appeared behind America, his friend dancing next to me.After a few moments, my new dance partner maneuvered behind me, and I felt a bit unsure when I felt his hands on my hips.As if hed read my mind, his hands left my waist.I looked behind me, and he was gone.I looked up to America, and the man behind her was gone as well.Finch seemed a bit nervous, but when America raised an eyebrow at his expression, he shook his head and continued dancing.By the third song, I was sweaty and tired.I retreated to our table, resting my heavy head on my hand, and laughed as I watched yet another hopeful ask America to dance.She winked at me from the dance floor, and then I stiffened when I saw him yanked backwards, disappearing through the crowd.I stood up and walked around the dance floor, keeping my eye on the hole he was pulled through, and felt the adrenaline burn through the alcohol in my veins when I saw Shepley holding the surprised man by his collar.Travis was beside him, laughing hysterically until he looked up and saw me watching them.He hit Shepleys arm, and when Shepley looked in my direction, he shoved his victim backward onto the floor.It didnt take me long to figure out what was going on: they had been yanking the guys that were dancing with us off the dance floor and threatening them to stay away from us.I narrowed my eyes at them both and then made my way to America.The crowd was thick, and I had to shove a few people out of my way.Shepley grabbed my hand before I made it to the dance floor.Dont tell her!he said, trying to subdue his smile.What the hell do you think youre doing, Shep?He shrugged, still proud of himself.I love her.I cant let other guys dance with her.Then whats your excuse for yanking the guy that was dancing with me?I said, crossing my arms.That wasnt me, Shepley said, quickly glancing at Travis.Sorry, Abby.We were just having fun.Not funny.Whats not funny?America said, glaring at Shepley.He swallowed, shooting a pleading look in my direction.I owed him a favor, so I kept my mouth shut.He sighed in relief when he realized I wouldnt rat him out, and then he looked at America with sweet adoration.Wanna dance?No, I dont wanna dance, she said, walking back to the table.He followed her, leaving Travis and I standing together.Travis shrugged.Wanna dance?What?Megans not here?He shook his head.You used to be a sweet drunk.Happy to disappoint you, I said, turning toward the bar.He followed, pulling two guys from their seats.I glared at him for a moment, but he ignored me, sitting down and then watching me with an expectant expression.Are you gonna sit?Ill buy you a beer.I thought you didnt buy drinks for girls at the bar.He tilted his head in my direction with an impatient frown.Youre different.Thats what you keep telling me.Cmon, Pidge.What happened to us being friends?We cant be friends, Travis.Obviously.Why not?Because I dont want to watch you maul a different girl every night, and you wont let anyone dance with me.He smiled.I love you.I cant let other guys dance with you.Oh yeah?How much did you love me when you were buying that box of condoms?Travis winced and I stood up, making my way to the table.Shepley and America were in a tight embrace, and making a scene while they kissed passionately.I think were going to the Sig Tau date Valentines party again, Finch said with a frown.I sighed.Shit.America hadnt been back to Morgan since her reunion with Shepley.She was consistently absent at lunch, and her phone calls were few and far between.I didnt begrudge them the time to make up for the time theyd spent apart.Truthfully, I was happy that America was too busy to call me from Shepley and Travis apartment.It was awkward hearing Travis in the background, and I felt a little jealous that she was spending time with him and I wasnt.Finch and I were seeing more of each other, and I was selfishly thankful that he was just as alone as I was.We went to class, ate together, studied together, and even Kara grew accustomed to having him around.My fingers were beginning to numb from the frigid air as I stood outside Morgan while he smoked.Would you consider quitting before I get hypothermia from standing here for moral support?I asked.Finch laughed.I love you, Abby.I really do, but no.Not quitting.Abby?I turned to see Parker walking down the sidewalk with his hands shoved in his pockets.His full lips were dry under his red nose, and I laughed when he put an imaginary cigarette to his mouth and blew out a puff of misty air.You could save a lot of money this way, Finch, he smiled.Why is everyone trashing on my smoking habit today?he asked, annoyed.Whats up, Parker?I asked.He fished two tickets from his pocket.That new Vietnam movie is out.You said you wanted to see it the other day, so I thought I would grab us some tickets for tonight.No pressure, Finch said.I can go with Brad if you have plans, he said with a shrug.So its not a date?I asked.Nope, just friends.And weve seen how that works out for you, Finch teased.Shut up!I giggled.That sounds fun, Parker, thanks.His eyes brightened.Would you like to get some pizza or something before?Im not a big fan of theater food, myself.Pizzas great, I nodded.Thats uhthats good, then.The movies at nine, so Ill pick you up at six thirty or so?I nodded again and Parker waved goodbye.Oh, Jesus, Finch said.Youre a glutton, Abby.You know thats not going to fly with Travis when he gets wind of it.You heard him.Its not a date.And I cant make plans based on what Travis is okay with.He didnt clear it with me before he brought Megan home.Youre never going to let that go, are you?Probably not, no.We sat in a corner booth, and I rubbed my mittens together, trying to get warm.I couldnt help but notice we were in the same booth Travis and I sat in when we first met, and I smiled at the memory of that day.Whats funny?Parker asked.I just like this place.Good times.I noticed the bracelet, he said.I looked down at the sparkling diamonds on my wrist.I told you I liked it.The waitress handed us menus and took our drink orders.Parker updated me on his Spring schedule, and talked about the progress in his studies for the MCAT.By the time the waitress served our beers, Parker had barely taken a breath.He seemed nervous, and I wondered if he wasnt under the impression that we were on a date, regardless of what hed said.He cleared his throat.Im sorry.I think Ive monopolized the conversation long enough.He tipped his beer bottle and shook his head.I just havent talked to you for any length of time in so long, that I suppose I had a lot to say.Its fine.It has been a long time.Just then, the door chimed.I turned to see Travis and Shepley walk in.It took Travis less than a second to meet my stare, but he didnt look surprised.Jesus, I muttered under my breath.What?Parker asked, turning to see them sit in a booth across the room.Theres burger place down the street we can go to, Parker said in a hushed voice.As nervous as he was before, it had been taken to a whole new level.I think it would be more awkward to leave at this point, I grumbled.His face fell, defeated.Youre probably right.We tried to continue our conversation, but it was noticeably forced and uncomfortable.The waitress spent an extended period of time at Travis table, raking her fingers through her hair and shifting her weight from one foot to the other.She finally remembered to take our order when Travis answered his cell phone.Ill have the tortellini, Parker said, looking to me.And Ill have.I trailed off.I was distracted when Travis and Shepley stood up.Travis followed Shepley to the door, but he hesitated, stopped, and turned around.When he saw me watching him, he walked straight across the room.The waitress had an expectant smile, as if she thought he had come to say goodbye.She was quickly disappointed when he stood beside me without so much as blinking in her direction.Ive got a fight in fourty five minutes, Pidge.I want you there,  Trav.His face was stoic, but I could see the tension around his eyes.I wasnt sure if he didnt want to leave my dinner with Parker to fate, or if he truly wanted me there with him, but I had made my decision the second hed asked.I need you there.Its a rematch with Brady Peterson, the guy from State.Its a big crowd, lots of money floating aroundand Adam says Bradys been training.Youve fought him before, Travis, you know its an easy win.Abby, Parker said quietly.I need you there, Travis said, his confidence fading.I looked at Parker with an apologetic smile.Im sorry.Are you serious?he said, his eyebrows shooting up.Youre just going to leave in the middle of dinner?You can still call Brad, right?I asked, standing up.The corners of Travis mouth turned up infinitesimally as he tossed a twenty on the table.That should cover it.I dont care about the moneyAbby.I shrugged.Hes my best friend, Parker.If he needs me there, I have to go.I felt Travis hand encapsulate mine as he led me away.Parker watched with a stunned look on his face.Shepley was already on the phone in the Charger, spreading the word.Travis sat in the back with me, keeping my hand firmly in his.I just got off the phone with Adam, Trav.He said the State guys all showed up drunk and padded with cash.Theyre already riled up, so you might wanna keep Abby out of the way.Travis nodded.You can keep an eye on her.Wheres America?I asked.Studying for her Physics test.Thats a nice lab, Travis said.I laughed once and then looked to Travis who had a small grin on his face.When did you see the lab?You havent had Physics, Shepley said.Travis chuckled and I elbowed him.He pressed his lips together until the urge to laugh subsided and then he winked at me, squeezing my hand once again.His fingers intertwined in mine, and I heard a small sigh escape his lips.I knew what he was thinking because I felt the same.In that sliver of time, it was as if nothing had changed.We pulled into a dark patch of the parking lot, and Travis refused to let go of my hand until we crawled into the window of the basement of the Hellerton Science Building.It had just been built the year before, so it didnt suffer from stagnate air and dust like the other basements wed snuck into.Just as we entered the hallway, the roar of the crowd reached our ears.I poked my head out to see an ocean of faces, many of them unfamiliar.Everyone had bottles of beer in their hands, but the State College students were easy to pick out of the crowd.They were the ones that swayed with their eyes half closed.Stay close to Shepley, Pigeon.Its going to get crazy in here, he said from behind me.He scanned the crowd, shaking his head at the sheer numbers.Hellertons basement was the most spacious on campus, so Adam liked to schedule fights there when he expected a larger crowd.Even with the addition of space, people were being rubbed against the walls and shoving one another to get a good spot.Adam rounded the corner and didnt try to hide his dissatisfaction of my presence.I thought I told you that you couldnt bring your girl to the fights, anymore, Travis.Travis shrugged.Shes not my girl, anymore.I kept my features smooth, but he had said the words so matter of factly, it caused a stabbing sensation in my chest.Adam looked down at our intertwined fingers and then up at Travis.Im never gonna figure you two out.He shook his head and then glanced to the mob.People were still streaming in from the stairs, and those on the floor were already packed together.Weve got an insane pot tonight, Travis, so no fuckin off, okay?Ill make sure its entertaining, Adam.Thats not what Im worried about.Bradys been training.So have I.   Bullshit, Shepley laughed.Travis shrugged.I got in a fight with Trent last weekend.That little shit is fast.I chuckled and Adam glared at me.You better take this seriously, Travis, he said, staring into his eyes.I have a lot of money riding on this fight.And I dont?Travis said, irritated with Adams lecture.Adam turned, holding the bull horn to his lips as he stood up on a chair above the multitude of drunken spectators.Travis pulled me against his side as Adam greeted the crowd and then went over the rules.Good luck, I said, touching his chest.I hadnt felt nervous to watch him fight since the one hed had with Brady, but I couldnt shake the ominous feeling Id had since we stepped foot in Hellerton.Something was off, and Travis felt it, too.Travis grabbed my shoulders and planted a kiss on my lips.He pulled away quickly, nodding once.Thats all the luck I need.I was still stunned from the warmth of Travis lips when Shepley pulled my arm to the wall beside Adam.I was bumped and elbowed, reminding me of the first night I watched Travis fight, but the crowd was less focused, and some of the State students were getting hostile.Easterners cheered and whistled for Travis when he broke into The Circle, and States crowd alternated between booing Travis and cheering for Brady.I was in prime position to see Brady tower over Travis, twitching impatiently for the bullhorn to sound.As usual, Travis had a slight grin on his face, unaffected by the madness around him.When Adam began the fight, Travis intentionally let Brady get in the first punch.I was surprised when his face jerked hard to the side with the blow.Brady had been training.Travis smiled, his teeth a bright red, and then he focused matching every punch Brady dealt.Why is he letting him hit him so much?I asked Shepley.I dont think hes letting him, anymore, Shepley said, shaking his head.Dont worry, Abby.Hes getting ready to take it up a notch.After ten minutes Brady was winded, but he was still landing solid blows into Travis sides and jaw.Travis caught Bradys shoe when he tried to kick him, and held his leg high with one hand, punching him in the nose with incredible force and then lifting Bradys leg higher, causing him to lose his balance.The crowd exploded when Brady fell, but he wasnt on the floor long.He stood, but with the addition of two lines of dark red streaming from his nose.In the next moment, he landed two more punches to Travis face.Blood rose from a cut on Travis eyebrow and dripped down his cheek.I closed my eyes and turned away hoping Travis would end the fight soon.The small shift of my body caught me in the current of onlookers, and before I could right myself, I was several feet from a preoccupied Shepley.I fought against the crowd futility, until I could feel the back wall behind me.The nearest door was on the other side of the room, an equal distance to the door wed come in.My back slammed against the concrete wall, knocking the wind out of me.Shep!I yelled, waving my hand above me to get his attention.The fight was at its peak.No one could hear me.A man lost his footing and used my shirt to right himself, spilling his beer down my front.I was soaked from neck to waist, reeking with the bitter stench of cheap beer.The man still had my shirt bunched in his fist as he tried to pull himself from the floor, and I ripped his fingers open two at time until he released me.He didnt look twice at me, pushing his way forward through the crowd.Hey!I know you!A man yelled into my ear.I leaned away, recognizing him right away.It was Ethan, the man Travis threatened at the bar  the man that had somehow escaped sexual assault charges.Yeah, I said, looking for a hole in the crowd as I straightened my shirt.Thats a nice bracelet, he said, running his hand down my arm and grabbing my wrist.Hey, I warned, pulling my hand away.He rubbed my arm, swaying and grinning.We were rudely interrupted last time I tried to talk to you.I stood on my tip toes, seeing Travis land two blows into Bradys face, and scanning the crowd between each one.He was looking for me instead of focusing on the fight.I had to get back to my spot before he was too distracted.I had barely made headway into the crowd when Ethans fingers dug into the back of my jeans.My back slammed into the wall once more.I wasnt finished talking to you, Ethan said, scanning my wet shirt with lewd intent.I pulled his hand from the back of my jeans, digging in my nails.Let go!I yelled when he resisted.He laughed, and I scanned the crowd for a familiar face when he pulled me against him.I dont wanna let go.I tried to push Ethan away, but his arms were heavy and his grip tight.In a panic, I couldnt distinguish State students from Easterners.No one seemed to notice my scuffle with Ethan, and it was so loud, no one could hear me protest, either.He leaned in, reaching his hand around to my backside and squeezing.I always thought youd be a nice piece of ass, he said, breathing stale beer in my face.Get OFF!I screamed, pushing him.I looked for Shepley, and saw that Travis had finally picked me out of the crowd.He instantly pushed against the packed bodies surrounding him.Travis!I screamed, but it was muffled against the cheering.I pushed Ethan with one hand and reached for Travis with the other.Travis made little progress before being shoved back into the Circle.Brady took advantage of Travis distraction and rammed an elbow in the side of his head.The crowd quieted down a bit when Travis punched someone in the crowd, trying once again to get to me.Get the fuck off her!Travis yelled.In a line between where I stood and Travis desperate attempt to reach me, heads turned in my direction.Ethan was oblivious, trying to keep me still long enough to kiss me.He ran his nose across my cheek bone and then down my neck.You smell really good, he slurred.I pushed his face away, but he grabbed my wrist, unfazed.Wide eyed, I searched for Travis again.He desperately pointed me out to Shepley.Get her!Shep!Get Abby!he said, still trying to push through the crowd.Brady pulled him back into the circle and punched him again.Youre fucking hot, you know that?Ethan said.I closed my eyes when I felt his mouth on my neck.Anger welled up within me and I pushed him again.I said get OFF!I yelled, ramming my knee into his groin.He doubled over, one hand automatically flying to the source of the pain, the other still gripping my shirt, refusing to let go.You bitch!he cried.In the next moment, I was free.Shepleys eyes were wild, staring into Ethans as he gripped him by the collar of his shirt.He held Ethan against the wall while he nailed him with his fist repeatedly in the face, stopping only when the blood poured from Ethans mouth and nose.Shepley pulled me to the stairs, shoving anyone who stood in his path.He helped me through an open window, and then down a fire escape, catching me when I leaped the few feet to the ground.You okay, Abby?Did he hurt you?Shepley asked.One sleeve of my white sweater was hanging by threads, otherwise I had escaped unscathed.I shook my head, still stunned.Shepley gently took my cheeks in his hands, looking into my eyes.Abby, answer me.Are you all right?I nodded.As the adrenaline absorbed into my blood stream, the tears began to flow.Im okay.He hugged me, pressing his cheek against my forehead, and then stiffened.Over here, Trav!Travis ran at us full speed, slowing only when had me in his arms.He was covered in blood, his eye dripping and his mouth spattered with red.Jesus Christis she hurt?he asked.Shepleys hand was still on my back.She said shes okay.Travis held me at arms length by my shoulders and frowned.Are you hurt, Pidge?Just as I shook my head, I saw the first of the mob from the basement trickling down from the fire escape.Travis kept me tight in his arms, silently scanning the faces.A short, squat man hopped down from the ladder and froze when he noticed us standing on the sidewalk.You, Travis snarled.He let me go, running across the grass, tackling the man to the ground.I looked to Shepley, confused and horrified.Thats the guy that kept shoving Travis back in the circle, Shepley said.A small crowd gathered around them as they scuffled on the ground.Travis pounded his fist into the mans face over and over.Shepley pulled me into his chest, still panting.The man stopped fighting back, and Travis left him on the ground in a bloody heap.Those gathered around him fanned out, giving Travis a wide birth, seeing the rage in his eyes.Travis!Shepley yelled, pointing to the other side of the building.Ethan hobbled in the shadows, using the brick wall of Hellerton to hold himself up.When he heard Shepley yell for Travis, he turned just in time to see his assailant charge.Ethan limped across the lawn, throwing down the beer bottle in his hands and moving as fast as his legs could carry him to the street.Just as he reached his car, Travis grabbed him and slammed him against it.Ethan pleaded with Travis, even as Travis gripped his shirt and rammed his head into the car door.The begging was cut off with the loud thud of his skull against the windshield, and then Travis pulled him to the front of the car and shattered the headlight with Ethans face.Travis launched him onto the hood, pressing his face into the metal while shouting obscenities.Shit, Shepley said.I turned to see Hellerton glow blue and red from the lights of a quickly approaching police cruiser.Droves of people jumped from the landing, forming a human waterfall down the fire escape, and a flurry of running students burst into every direction.Travis!I screamed.Travis left Ethans limp body on the hood of the car to sprint towards us.Shepley pulled me to the parking lot, ripping open his door.I jumped into the back seat, anxiously waiting for them both to get in.Cars were flying from their spots and out of the drive way, screeching to a halt when a second police car blocked the drive.Travis and Shepley jumped into their seats, and Shepley cursed when he saw the trapped cars backing from the only exit.He slammed the car into drive, and the Charger bounced as it jumped the curb.He spun out over the grass, and we flew between two buildings, bouncing again when he hit the road behind the school.The tires squealed and the engine snarled when Shepley slammed his foot on the accelerator.I slid across the seat into the wall of the cab when we took a turn, bumping my already sore elbow.The street lights were streaks across the window as we raced to the apartment, but it seemed like an hour had passed by the time we pulled into the parking lot.Shepley threw the Charger into park and turned off the ignition.The boys opened their doors in silence, and Travis reached into the back seat, lifting me into his arms.What happened?Holy shit, Trav, what happened to your face?America said, running down the stairs.Ill tell you inside, Shepley said, guiding her to the door.Travis carried me up the stairs, through the living and down the hall without a word, setting me on his bed.Toto pawed at my legs, jumping onto the bed to lick my face.Not now, buddy, Travis said in a hushed voice, taking the puppy to the hall and shutting the door.He kneeled in front of me, touching the frayed edges of my sleeve.His eye was in the beginning stages of a bruise, red and swollen.The angry skin above it was cut and wet with blood.His lips were smeared with scarlet, and the hide was ripped away from some of his knuckles.His once white t shirt was now soiled with a combination of blood, grass and dirt.I touched his eye and he winced, pulling away from my hand.Im so sorry, Pigeon.I tried to get to you.I tried.He cleared his throat of the anger and worry that choked him.I couldnt get to you.Will you ask America to take me back to Morgan?I said.You cant go back there tonight.The place is crawling with cops.Just stay here.Ill sleep on the couch.I sucked in a faltering breath, trying to ward off any more tears.He felt bad enough.Travis stood up and opened the door.Where are you going?I asked.Ive gotta get a shower.Ill be right back.America shoved past him, sitting beside me on the bed, pulling me into her chest.Im so sorry I wasnt there!she cried.Im fine, I said, wiping my tear stained face.Shepley knocked on the door as he entered, bringing me a short glass half full of whiskey.Here, he said, handing it to America.She cupped my hands around it and nudged me.I tipped back my head, letting the liquid flow down my throat.My face compressed as the whiskey burned its way to my stomach.Thanks, I said, handing the glass back to Shepley.I should have gotten to her sooner.I didnt even realize she was gone.Im sorry, Abby.I shouldve.Its not your fault, Shep.Its not anyones fault.Its Ethans fault, he seethed.That sick bastard was dry fucking her against the wall.Baby!America said, pulling me to her side.I need another drink, I said, shoving my empty glass at Shepley.Me, too, Shepley said, returning to the kitchen.Travis walked in with a towel around his waist, holding a cold can of beer against his eye.America left the room without a word as Travis slipped on his boxers, and then he grabbed his pillow.Shepley brought four glasses this time, all full to the brim with amber liquor.We all knocked back the whiskey without hesitation.Ill see you in the morning, America said, kissing my cheek.Travis took my glass, sitting it on the night stand.He watched me for a moment and then walked over to his closet, pulling a t shirt off the hanger and tossing it to the bed.Im sorry Im such a fuck up, he said, holding the beer to his eye.You look awful.Youre going to feel like shit tomorrow.He shook his head, disgusted.Abby, you were attacked tonight.Dont worry about me.Its hard not to when your eye is swelling shut, I said, situating his shirt on my lap.His jaw tensed.It wouldntve happened if Id just let you stay with Parker.But I knew if I asked you, youd come.I wanted to show him that you were still mine, and then you get hurt.The words took me off guard, as if I hadnt heard him right.Thats why you ask me to come tonight?To prove a point to Parker?It was part of it, he said, ashamed.The blood drained from my face.For the first time since wed met, Travis had fooled me.I had gone to Hellerton with him thinking he needed me, thinking that despite everything, we were back to where we were before.I was nothing more than a water hydrant; he had marked his territory, and I had allowed him to do it.My eyes filled with tears.Get out.Pigeon, he said, taking a step toward me.Get OUT!I said, grabbing the glass from the night stand and throwing it at him.He ducked, and it shattered against the wall in hundreds of tiny, glistening shards.I hate you!Travis heaved as if the air had been knocked out of him, and with a pained expression, he left me alone.I yanked off my clothes and pulled the t shirt on.The noise that burst from my throat surprised me.It had been a long time since I had sobbed uncontrollably.Within moments, America rushed into the room.She crawled into the bed and wrapped her arms around me.She didnt ask me questions or try to console me, she only held me as I let the tears drench the pillow case.Just before the sun breached the horizon, America and I quietly left the apartment behind.We didnt speak on the way to Morgan, and I was glad for the silence.I didnt want to talk, I didnt want to think, I just wanted to block out the last twelve hours.My body felt heavy and sore, as if Id been in a car accident.When we walked into my room, I saw that Karas bed was made.Can I borrow your flat iron?America asked.Mare, Im fine.Go to class.Youre not fine.I dont want to leave you alone right now.Thats all I want to be at the moment.She opened her mouth to argue, but sighed.There would be no changing my mind.Im coming back to check on you after class.Get some rest.I nodded, locking the door behind her.The bed squeaked beneath me as I fell onto it with a huff.All along I believed that I was important to Travis; that he needed me.But in that moment, I felt like the shiny new toy Parker said I was.He wanted to prove to Parker that I was still his.His.Im nobodys, I said to the empty room.As the words sunk in, I was overwhelmed with the grief Id felt from the night before.I belonged to no one.Id never felt so alone in my life.Finch sat a brown bottle in front of me.Neither of us felt like celebrating, but I was at least comforted by the fact that, according to America, Travis would avoid the date party at all costs.Red and pink craft paper covered empty beer cans hanging from the ceiling, and red dresses in every style walked past.The tables were covered with tiny foil hearts, and Finch rolled his eyes at the ridiculous decorations.Valentines Day at a frat house.Romantic, he said, watching the couples walk by.Shepley and America had been downstairs dancing from the moment we arrived, and Finch and I protested our presence by pouting in the kitchen.I drank the contents of the bottle quickly, determined to blur the memories of the last date party Id attended.Finch popped open another cap and handed me another, aware of my desperation to forget.Ill get more, he said, returning to the fridge.The keg is for guests, the bottles are for Sig Tau, a girl sneered beside me.I looked down at the red cup in her hand.Or maybe your boyfriend just told you that because he was counting on a cheap date.She narrowed her eyes and pushed away from the counter, taking her cup elsewhere.Who was that?Finch asked, setting down four more bottles.Random sorority bitch, I said, watching her walk away.By the time Shepley and America rejoined us, there were six empty bottles on the table beside me.My teeth were numb, and it felt a bit easier to smile.I was more comfortable, leaning against my spot on the counter.Travis had proven to be a no show, and I could survive the remainder of the party in peace.Are you guys going to dance or what?America asked.I looked to Finch.Are you going to dance with me, Finch?Are you going to be able to dance?he asked, raising an eyebrow.Theres only one way to find out, I said, pulling him downstairs.We bounced and shook until a thin sheen of sweat began to form under my dress.Just when I thought my lungs would burst, a slow song came over the speakers.Finch peered uncomfortably around us, glancing to the people pairing off and getting close.Youre going to make me dance to this, arent you?he asked.Its Valentines Day, Finch.Pretend Im a boy.He laughed, pulling me into his arms.Its hard to do that when youre wearing a short pink dress.Whatever.Like youve never seen a boy in a dress.Finch shrugged.True.I giggled, resting my head against his shoulder.The alcohol made my body feel heavy and sluggish as I tried to move to the slow tempo.Mind if I cut in, Finch?Travis stood beside us, half amused, half prepared for my reaction.The blood under my cheeks immediately burst into flames.Finch looked at me, and then at Travis.Sure.Finch, I hissed as he walked away.Travis pulled me against him and I tried to keep as much between space between us as possible.I thought you werent coming.I wasnt, but I knew you were here.I had to come.I looked around the room, avoiding his eyes.Every movement he made, I was acutely aware of.The pressure changes of his fingers at the points where he touched me, his feet shuffling beside mine, his arms shifting, brushing against my dress.I felt ridiculous pretending not to notice.His eye was healing, the bruise had almost vanished, and the red blotches on his face were absent as if I had imagined them.All evidence of that horrible night had disappeared, leaving only the stinging memories.He watched my every breath, and when the song was half over, he sighed.You look beautiful, Pidge.Dont.Dont what?Tell you youre beautiful?Justdont.I didnt mean it.I huffed in frustration.Thanks.Noyou look beautiful.I meant that.I was talking about what I said in my room.Im not going to lie.I enjoyed pulling you from your date with Parker.It wasnt a date, Travis.We were just eating.He wont speak to me now, thanks to you.I heard.Im sorry.No youre not.YYoure right, he said, stuttering when he saw my impatient expression.But Ithat wasnt the only reason I took you to the fight.I wanted you there with me, Pidge.Youre my good luck charm.Im not your anything, I snapped, glaring up at him.His eyebrows pulled in and he stopped dancing.Youre my everything.I pressed my lips together, trying to keep the anger at the surface, but it was impossible to stay mad at him when he looked at me that way.You dont really hate medo you?he asked.I turned away from him, putting more distance in between us.Sometimes I wish that I did.It would make everything a whole hell of a lot easier.A cautious smile spread across his lips in a thin, subtle line.So what pisses you off more?What I did to make you wanna hate me?Or knowing that you cant?The anger returned.I shoved past him, running up the stairs to the kitchen.My eyes were beginning to gloss over but I refused to be a sobbing mess at the date party.Finch stood beside the table and I sighed with relief when he handed me another beer.For the next hour, I watched Travis fend off girls and suck down shots of whiskey in the living room.Each time he caught my eye, I looked away from him, determined to get through the night without a scene.You two look miserable, Shepley said.They couldnt look more bored if they were doing it on purpose, America grumbled.Dont forgetwe didnt want to come, Finch reminded them.America made her famous face that I was just as famous for giving in to.You could pretend, Abby.For me.Just when I opened my mouth for a sharp retort, Finch touched my arm.I think weve done our duty.You ready to go, Abby?I drank the remainder of my beer in a quick swig and then took Finchs hand.As anxious as I was to leave, my legs froze when the same song that Travis and I danced to at my birthday party floated up the stairs.I grabbed Finchs bottle and took another swig, trying to block out the memories that came with the music.Brad leaned against the counter beside me.Wanna dance?I smiled at him, shaking my head.He began to say something else, but he was interrupted.Dance with me.Travis stood a few feet from me, his hand outstretched to mine.America, Shepley and Finch were all staring at me, waiting for my answer as anxiously as Travis.Leave me alone, Travis, I said, crossing my arms.This is our song, Pidge.We dont have a song.Pigeon.No.I looked to Brad and forced a smile.I would love to dance, Brad.Brads freckles stretched across his cheeks as he smiled, gesturing for me to lead the way to the stairs.Travis staggered backward, the hurt plainly displayed in his eyes.A toast!he yelled.I flinched, turning just in time to see him climbing onto a chair, stealing a beer from the shocked Sig Tau brother closest to him.I glanced to America, who was watching Travis with a pained expression.To douchebags!he said, gesturing to Brad.And to girls that break your heart, he bowed his head to me.His eyes lost focus.And to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her.He tilted back the beer, finishing what was left, and then tossed it to the floor.The room was silent except for the music playing in the lower level, and everyone stared at Travis in mass confusion.Mortified, I grabbed Brads hand and led him downstairs to the dance floor.A few couples followed behind us, watching me closely for tears or some other response to Travis tirade.I smoothed my features, refusing to give them what they wanted.We danced a few stiff steps and Brad sighed.That was kind ofweird.Welcome to my life.Travis pushed his way through the couples on the dance floor, stopping beside me.It took him a moment to steady his feet.Im cutting in.No, youre not.Jesus!I said, refusing to look at him.After a few tense moments I glanced up, seeing Travis eyes boring into Brads.If you dont back away from my girl, Ill rip out your fucking throat.Right here on the dance floor.Brad seemed conflicted, his eyes nervously darting from me to Travis.Sorry, Abby, he said, slowly pulling his arms away.He retreated to the stairs and I stood alone, humiliated.How I feel about you right now, Travis it very closely resembles hate.Dance with me, he pleaded, swaying to keep his balance.The song ended and I sighed with relief.Go drink another bottle of whiskey, Trav.I turned to dance with the only single guy on the dance floor.The tempo was faster, and I smiled at my new, surprised dance partner, trying to ignore the fact that Travis was just a few feet behind me.Another Sig Tau brother danced behind me, grabbing my hips.I reached back, pulling him closer.It reminded me of the way Travis and Megan danced that night at the Red, and I did my best to recreate the scene I had wished on many occasions that I could forget.Two pairs of hands were on nearly every part of my body, and it was easy to ignore my more reserved side with the amount of alcohol in my system.Suddenly, I was airborne.Travis threw me over his shoulder, at the same time shoving one of his frat brothers hard, knocking him to the floor.Put me down!I said, pounding my fists into his back.Im not going to let you embarrass yourself over me, he growled, taking the stairs two at a time.Every pair of eyes we passed watched me kick and scream as Travis carried me across the room.You dont think, I said as I struggled, this is embarrassing?Travis!Shepley!Is Donnie outside?Travis said, ducking from my flailing limbs.Uhyeah?he said.Put her down!America said, taking a step toward us.America, I squirmed, dont just stand there!Help me!Her mouth turned up and she laughed once.You two look ridiculous.My eyebrows turned in at her words, both shocked and angry that she found any part of the situation funny.Travis headed for the door and I glared at her.Thanks a lot, friend!The cold air struck the bare parts of my skin, and I protested louder.Put me down, dammit!Travis opened a car door and tossed me into the backseat, sliding in beside me.Donnie, youre the DD tonight?Yeah, he said, nervously watching me struggle to escape.I need you take us to my apartment.TravisI dont think.Travis voice was controlled, but frightening.Do it, Donnie, or Ill shove my fist through the back of your head, I swear to God.Donnie pulled away from the curb and I lunged for the door handle.Im not going to your apartment!Travis grabbed one of my wrists and then the other.I leaned down to bite his arm.He closed his eyes, and then a low grunt escaped through his clenched jaw as my teeth sunk into his flesh.Do your worst, Pidge.Im tired of your shit.I released his skin and jerked my arms, struggling against his grip.My shit?Let me out of this fucking car!He pulled my wrists close to his face.I love you, dammit!Youre not going anywhere until you sober up and we figure this out!Youre the only one that hasnt figured it out, Travis!I said.He released my wrists and I crossed my arms, pouting the rest of the way to the apartment.When the car slowed to a stop, I leaned forward.Can you take me home, Donnie?Travis pulled me out of the car by the arm and then he swung me over his shoulder again, carrying me up the stairs.Night, Donnie.Im calling your dad!I cried.Travis laughed out loud.And hed probably pat me on the shoulder and tell me that its about damn time!He struggled to unlock the door as I kicked and waved my arms, trying to get away.Knock it off, Pidge, or were going to fall down the stairs!Once he opened the door, he stomped into Shepleys room.Put.Me.Down!I screamed.Fine, he said, dropping me onto Shepleys bed.Sleep it off.Well talk in the morning.The room was dark; the only light a rectangular beam shooting into the doorway from the hall.I fought to focus through the darkness, beer, and anger, and when he turned into the light, it illuminated his smug smile.I pounded the mattress with my fists.You cant tell me what to do anymore, Travis!I dont belong to you!In the second it took him to turn and face me, his expression had contorted into anger.He stomped toward me, planting his hands on the bed and leaning into my face.WELL I BELONG TO YOU!The veins in his neck bulged as he shouted, and I met his glare, refusing to even flinch.He looked at my lips, panting.I belong to you, he whispered, his anger melting as he realized how close we were.Before I could think of a reason not to, I grabbed his face, slamming my lips against his.Without hesitation, Travis lifted me into his arms.In a few long strides, he carried me into his bedroom, both of us crashing to the bed.I yanked his shirt over his head, fumbling in the dark with his belt buckle.He jerked it open, ripping it off and throwing it to the floor.He lifted me from the mattress with one hand, and unzipped my dress with the other.I pulled it over my head, tossing it somewhere in the dark, and then Travis kissed me, moaning against my mouth.With just a few quick movements, his boxers were off and he pressed his chest against mine.I grabbed his backside, but he resisted when I tried to pull him into me.Were both drunk, he said, breathing hard.Please.I pressed my legs against his hips, desperate to relieve the burning between my thighs.Travis was set on us getting back together, and I had no intentions of fighting the inevitable, so I was more than ready to spend the night tangled up in his sheets.This isnt right, he said.He was just above me, pressing his forehead against mine.I hoped that it was just half hearted protesting, and that I could persuade him somehow that he was wrong.The way we couldnt seem to stay away from each other was unexplainable, but I didnt need an explanation, anymore.I didnt even need an excuse.In that moment, I only needed him.I want you.I need you to say it, he said.My insides were screaming for him, and I couldnt stand it a second longer.Ill say whatever you want.Then say that you belong to me.Say that youll take me back.I wont do this unless were together.Weve never really been apart, have we?I asked, hoping it was enough.He shook his head, his lips sweeping across mine.I need to hear you say it.I need to know youre mine.Ive been yours since the second we met.My voice took the tone of begging.Any other time I would have been embarrassed, but I was beyond regret.I had fought my feelings, guarded them, and bottled them up.I had experienced the happiest moments of my life while at Eastern, all of them with Travis.Fighting, laughing, loving or crying, if it was with him, I was where I wanted to be.One side of his mouth turned up as he touched my face, and then his lips touched mine in a tender kiss.When I pulled him against me, he didnt resist.His muscles tensed, and he held his breath as he slid inside me.Say it again, he said.Im yours, I breathed.Every nerve, inside and out ached for more.I dont ever want to be apart from you again.Promise me, he said, groaning with another thrust.I love you.Ill love you forever.The words were more of a sigh, but I met his eyes when I said them.I could see the uncertainty in his eyes vanish, and even in the dim light, his face brightened.Finally satisfied, he sealed his mouth over mine.Travis woke me with kisses.My head was heavy and fogged from the multiple drinks Id had the night before, but the hour before I fell asleep replayed in my mind in vivid detail.Soft lips showered every inch of my hand, arm and neck, and when he reached my lips, I smiled.Good morning, I said against his mouth.He didnt speak; his lips continued working against mine.His solid arms enveloped me, and then he buried his face in my neck.Youre quiet this morning, I said, running my hands over the bare skin of his back.I let them continue down his backside, and then I hooked my leg over his hip, kissing his cheek.He shook his head.I just want to be like this, he whispered.I frowned.Did I miss something?I didnt mean to wake you up.Why dont you just go back to sleep?I leaned back against the pillow, pulling up his chin.His eyes were bloodshot, the skin around them blotchy and red.What in the hell is wrong with you?I asked, alarmed.He put one of my hands in his and kissed it, pressing his forehead against my neck.Just go back to sleep, Pigeon.Please?Did something happen?Is it America?With the last question, I sat up.Even seeing the fear in my eyes, his expression didnt change.He simply sighed and sat up with me, looking at my hand in his.NoAmericas fine.They got home around four this morning.Theyre still in bed.Its early, lets just go back to sleep.Feeling my heart pounding against my chest, I knew there was no chance of falling back asleep.Travis put both hands on each side of my face and kissed me.His mouth moved differently, as if he were kissing me for the last time.He lowered me to the pillow, kissed me once more, and then rested his head on my chest, wrapping both arms tightly around me.Every possible reason for Travis behavior flipped through my mind like television channels.I hugged him to me, afraid to ask.Have you slept?Icouldnt.I didnt wanna, his voice trailed off.I kissed his forehead.Whatever it is, well get through it, okay?Why dont you get some sleep?Well figure it out when you wake up.His head popped up and he scanned my face.I saw both mistrust and hope in his eyes.What do you mean?That well get through it?My eyebrows pulled in, confused.I couldnt imagine what had happened while I was sleeping that would cause him so much anguish.I dont know whats going on, but Im here.Youre here?As in youre staying?With me?I knew that my expression must have been ridiculous, but my head was spinning, from both the alcohol and Travis bizarre questions.Yes.I thought we discussed this last night?We did, he nodded, encouraged.I searched the room with my eyes, thinking.His walls were no longer bare as they were when we had first met.They were now peppered with trinkets from places that wed spent time together, and the white paint was interrupted by black frames holding pictures of me, us, Toto, and our group of friends.A larger frame of the two of us at my birthday party replaced the sombrero that once hung by a nail above his headboard.I narrowed my eyes at him.You thought I was going to wake up pissed at you, didnt you?You thought I was going to leave?He shrugged, making a poor attempt at the indifference that used to come so easily to him.That is what youre famous for.Is that what youre so upset about?You stayed up all night worrying about what would happen when I woke up?He shifted as if his next words would be difficult.I didnt mean for last night to happen like that.I was a little drunk, and I followed you around the party like some fucking stalker, and then I dragged you out of there, against your willand then we., he shook his head, clearly disgusted with the memories playing in his mind.Had the best sex of my life?I smiled, squeezing his hand.Travis laughed once, the tension around his eyes slowly melting away.So were okay?I kissed him, touching the sides of his face with tenderness.Yes, dummy.I promised, didnt I?I told you everything you wanted to hear, were back together, and youre still not happy?His face compressed around his smile.Baby, stop.I love you, I said, smoothing the worried lines around his eyes.This absurd stand off could have been over at Thanksgiving, but,  Waitwhat?he interrupted, leaning back.I was fully prepared to give in on Thanksgiving, but you said you were done trying to make me happy, and I was too proud to tell you that I wanted you back.Are you fucking kidding me?I was just trying to make it easier on you!Do you know how miserable Ive been?I frowned.You looked just fine after break.That was for you!I was afraid Id lose you if I didnt pretend to be okay with being friends.I could have been with you this whole time?What the fuck, Pigeon?I.  I couldnt argue; he was right.I had made us both suffer, and I had no excuse.Im sorry.Youre sorry?I damn near drank myself to death, I could barely get out of bed, I shattered my phone into a million pieces on New Years Eve to keep from calling youand youre sorry?
