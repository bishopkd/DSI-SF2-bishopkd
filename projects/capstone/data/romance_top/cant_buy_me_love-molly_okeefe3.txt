You look beautiful, he said, making her smile and distracting her from her concern.Like a dove.She ran a hand down the front of her cool gray suit.Youre drunk, she accused without any heat.Youre right.But youre still the most beautiful woman I know.It kills me that youre wasting all this charm on your mother.Hes only charming when hes drunk, Victoria chimed in.She smiled, swift and careful, and affection cooled his anger.Beat back his uglier emotions.Shes right, he said with a wink.His mother still watched him, her blue eyes piercing beneath her dramatic silver hair.The bone structure hed inherited, the sleek nose, sharp cheekbones, and high forehead, made her look aristocratic.As if she were only a few steps down the bloodline from royalty.She was sixty two and he couldnt look at her without thinking about her being twenty four when she had him, married to a man almost double her age, stranded down here on this ranch.Theyd divorced months after he was born, so he never knew his parents married.Couldnt imagine what that was like.Whyd you marry him?he asked.She blinked in surprise and then quickly hid it under all her still waters.I was pregnant.And he waspersuasive.Did he hurt you?Is that how he persuaded you?Luc understood the beauty people saw when they looked at his mother.He recognized it.But when he looked at her, all he ever saw was the woman who made him a dog costume for Halloween when he was five and a cat costume for herself, and let him chase her through their ritzy Montreal neighborhood.Four years in a row.It was hard for her to be at his every game, but when she said she was going to be there, hed look up from center ice and see her in her spot, three rows up from the visitors net.She slapped another kids mother once.He wasnt sure why; shed never told him the story.But in front of all the other parents, Celeste Baker had backhanded some hockey mom.This woman was his champion.And it killed him that she had ever suffered under Lyle Bakers love.He nevertreated me that way.It seems he saved all of that for you children when I wasnt here to stop him.Her eyes flickered over his shoulder to Victoria and Jacob.Did you love him?he asked, unable to see it.Nothing in Lyle Baker inspired love.Respect, maybe, if you didnt spend too much time with him.But not love.Not from a woman like Celeste.Thats so hard to believe?He laughed and stared at the bottom of his cut glass tumbler, wishing he had some ice.All this warm booze was drying him out.He was a hard man, but for a whileit was good.When I found out how you were treated The glass caught the light, sending prisms across his legs.Theyd never talked about this.And twenty years later it still seemed like a secret he should keep from her.Thats why you sent me to hockey camp that summer?You found out?I heard you at night, talking in your bed.I knew what you wanted to do to him andwell, it wasnt hard to put it together.Why didnt you tell me?All those years?He shrugged.Pride, maybe.Crying to his mom seemed like it would only make things worse.Its a million years ago now.Luc.She touched his hand where he rubbed his forehead.What arent you telling me?Im fine, he said, desperate to change the subject.Ready to be gone and at the beck and call of all your charitable whims.The long level look she gave him indicated she wasnt fooled.But wouldnt push the issue.Now.Youve been blessed, Luc.The least you can do is donate some signed hockey pucks to a few worthy causes.So Im told, he said.Thank you for keeping my karma in working order.Her laugh was deep, that startling bark so at odds with her elegance.It takes more than a few silent auction donations to do that, my son.In fact, I have joined the board for Sick Kids Hospital Victorias head snapped up.That charity had been a favorite of hers and shed been on the board until they asked her to leave.Im sensing there will be more than signed hockey pucks in my future.Well talk about it once were done with this current mess, Celeste said.Theyre reading the will this afternoon, Victoria said, pressing back Jacobs wild dark curls that were springing up in the humidity.Luc tucked his phone back in his pocket.The old man was dead; his career was hanging by a thread.It was time to go home.Fine, he said.But after that Im leaving.Victoria nodded, not looking at him.Can we go with you?Jacob asked, and Luc felt bad for the kid.He really did.But Victoria shook her head.Were going to stay a little longer.Why?Celeste asked, and Luc inwardly cringed.His gracious mother turned into Godzilla around Victoria.Their mutual tension fed off each other, like that of rabid cats, making both of them act like idiots.It had been going on for so long that neither of them knew how to break the pattern.Victoria braced herself and looked Celeste in the eyea show of maturity it had taken her years to accomplish.We have nowhere else to go, she said.Nonsense, Celeste said.Youre staying with Luc.Thats not our home.Celestes eyebrows rose.And this is?Mom, he whispered.Its Vickss choice.She opened her mouth, but Luc stared at her hard and finally she nodded.Of course, she said, gracious at last, but far too late.Hed spent most of his life trying to convince his sister that Celeste didnt hate her.It never seemed to work.All of Celestes cool and imperial efforts to befriend Vicks came off as disapproval and only made things worse.He caught Celestes eye, and she seemed to be asking him to help smooth the rocky road between her and her husbands mistresss child.But some things were beyond even the Ice Mans ability to control.He grabbed his whiskey.Ill see you in the den for the will reading, he said, then went back to his room to make some calls.An hour later, without his suit coat and tie, Luc walked into the den, and judging by the looks his mother and sister gave him, he was late.Celeste and Victoria sat on the deep couch with the carved antelope armrests.His mother looked ridiculous sitting next to the serape thrown over the back of the couch, like serving champagne with beans.A tall, thin man who looked vaguely familiar stood in the front of the room, by Lyles big desk.Im Randy Jenkins, the man said, holding out his hand.Your fathers lawyer.Great, Luc said, shaking the mans hand.He had a good buzz going, and this whole scene felt fuzzy.In a very pleasant way.If you were going to the reading of your fathers will, might as well do it drunk.You dont remember me, do you?Jenkins asked, a sly smile on his thin lips.Should I?I competed against you in the peewee circuit when we were kids.Oh God.Randy Jenkins.Honestly, this day could not get worse.Of course, good to see you, Randy.Randy had not just competed against Luc in those peewee rodeo competitions, hed slaughtered him.Not that it was hard.Kids in wheelchairs outwrangled him.A pleasure to see you, Randy said.Ive been an avid fan of yours since you played for the Hurricanes.Never would have pegged you as a hockey fan, Luc said.Randy shrugged.Weve all got our surprises.And I have to say, these rumors about Toronto trading some folks to Dallas for Lashenko are pretty interesting.Particularly if its you.We could use your experience on the team.Your leadership.His gray eyes twinkled behind his glasses, and Luc had the sinking feeling that the whole damn hockey world was thinking the same thing.This trade made sense.Farm out the old guy, bring in the hotshot.The math was pretty fucking simple.I had hoped you might be willing to substantiate those rumors.Im not going anywhere, Luc practically barked.Jenkins pushed his thin glasses up higher on his nose.Then who do you think theyll trade?Billy Wilkins?Billys hurt.Hes out the first half of the season no matter where he goes.The never pleasant early afternoon hangover began to burn through his buzz.To say nothing of his manners.Normally, he could talk hockey all day, but somehow doing it with Randy Jenkins seemed wrong.Look, Luc, I dont suppose I could have an autograph for my son.Hes a young player with some skill Luc looked over at his mother and sister, sitting so straight their backs were miles from the sofa.Eli Turnbull stood in the back, totally unreadable.I dont think this is the time.Right.Randy waved a hand between them.Of course, my apologies.But later, Luc said, a small peace offering.No problem.Randy nodded and sat down behind the desk, then started flipping through papers.Luc headed over to the bar in the corner next to Eli.Have a drink, Eli.He checked the ice bucket, hoping for the best, only to be disappointed.Is there no ice in Texas?Its one in the afternoon, Luc.The ice only comes out at night?Elis lip twitched, which Luc understood to be a clear indication the man was ready to drink.Whiskey?he asked, smiling at the cowboy.It was a stretch to say theyd grown up together, but there had been that one March break when theyd taken one of his dads bottles of Wild Turkey behind the barn and gotten drunker than any two kids should.Hed woken up with a black eye, no shoes, and a hangover like the fist of God squeezing his brain.Like the old days?We didnt have old days.Eli was back to being stone faced.Luc always knew that guy was no fun.Yeah, youre right.Luc poured himself two fingers of whiskey and then, because it was a long walk to the empty club chairs, he added a third.And then he poured an equal amount in another tumbler and left it for Eli.Just in case.Now that Luc is here, we just need Tara Jean, Jenkins said.Luc paused before sitting in one of the club chairs.Why?Shes named in the will.Oh Lyle, you son of a bitch, Celeste muttered.I dont think shes still here, Luc said.Shes in the greenhouse, Eli said.His voice sounded like it had been dragged down a long gravel road.She wasnt at the funeral, Victoria said.Or the wake.Eli shrugged.Shes been in the greenhouse.Luc sighed and stood.His motor revved at the thought of going toe to toe with Tara Jean again.Ill go get her.He stepped to the door, but Eli got there before him and stood in his way.Luc blinked.The cowboy moved fast.Shes grieving, Eli said, his green eyes sizing Luc up.Luc couldnt help it, he snorted.The loss of her fortune, maybe.Eli shook his head.She is, and you make things worse for her and well have words.Words.That was cowboy for Ill put my fist in your face.Dont worry.Luc clapped a hand on the smaller mans shoulders.Shell survive.Luc brushed past Eli and through the sliding glass door at the back of the room.The top of the greenhouse was visible over the lilacs that were going brown in the sun.What the hell was she doing in the greenhouse?She didnt seem the amateur horticulturist type.He took another sip of his drink and rounded the corner.Through the glass walls he caught sight of a couple of people standing around.A party?He had to laugh.That girl had brass balls the size of watermelons.The arched wooden door to the greenhouse was warped and stood slightly cracked.It didnt take much to push it open.There were no plants.And the people were actually headless dummies.All of them wearing leather.Weird.A long table marched down the center of the room, T ed by a rack of clothes.Leather clothes.At the other end of the table was a desk.Sorry, he said to the woman sitting there, hunched over paperwork.But Im looking The woman looked up.Her face was red and splotchy, as though she was in the middle of an allergic reaction.Her eyes were obliterated by puffiness.A ponytail made a valiant effort to keep stringy blond hair in place, but most of it fell into the womans face.She wore an old flannel shirt, held together by one button.Under that, there was a mans white tank top, covered in brown and black spots.It took a second, because he was drunk and because never, ever in his life did he expect a professional gold digger to be seen in public looking so terrible, but when the penny dropped, he laughed.And couldnt stop.Tara Jean Sweet, he said, you look like shit.7 Her grief was worse than shed thought it would be.Shed prepared for something bittersweet.But this pain was hard and sharpglass she couldnt swallow.Crying over all your lost millions?Luc looked disreputable, with his hair mussed and his tie pulled loose, like a dangerous man in a cologne ad.Dont forget the cows.Of course, he agreed magnanimously.He looked around at the studio like it was a curiosity, a freak show at a circus, and not a very good one.And she wanted to be cool about it.Untouched.As controlled as he was.But she couldnt.Get the hell out of here, Luc, she snapped, unable to muster up anything more cutting to say.Should I call you Tara Jean or Jane?I mean, frankly, youre not like any Jane Ive ever met.Out.Tara Jean it is.Im not kidding, Luc.Leave.Now.Wish I could, Tara Jean.He stepped farther into her workshop.But I have been sent to fetch you.Get up, she told herself, trying to rally.This man is invading your kingdom.Tell him where to go.Show him how tough you are.But she couldnt even be bothered to clean up the candy wrappers that littered her desk.What is this place?he asked, walking along the big table toward the rack of clothes.None of your business.Honey, if you want to fight, youre going to have to try harder than that.See?she told herself.Even the heartless bastard is telling you to pull on your big girl panties and get on with it.He reached out to touch the fringed pink skirt, and the demon shook in anger.Dont touch that!She found herself on her feet, her hands clenched into fists at her side.Thats better.His smile was loose, suspicious.She narrowed her eyes.Are you drunk?He drained the last of the liquor in his glass.I am.Thats disgusting.Your daddy was buried Yes, he was.And I was there.He walked down the long aisle toward her desk.And maybe it was because she was dehydrated and sick to her stomach from grief and candy, but the look in his eyes made her feel painfully unsafe.It was her lack of armor.Christ, she didnt even have on a push up bra.Or lipstick.How could a girl feel tough without lipstick?The question is, he stopped in front of her old metal desk, where were you?Hiding, mostly.But he didnt need to know that.It was perfectly clear what shed been doing.Crying and binge eating.Grief took her to some ugly places.So she didnt say anything and a slow, lazy smile split his generous lips, revealing those white, white teeth.If she was any other woman, she might have been turned on.Do you have anything to drink around here?He held up his empty glass.No.No?She stared at him.Funny, you seem like the kind of girl who likes a wine cooler in the morning.A few years and another lifetime ago, he wouldnt have been wrong.Jane Simmons had been a drinker.Among other things.What is that?he asked, pointing to her desk, where the sketch of the pink boot that Nordstrom was considering was covered in candy wrappers.A boot.He shuddered dramatically.Good thing I didnt agree to Dads marketing scheme.I never would have lived down wearing pink boots.These arent the boots he wanted you to wear, you idiot.The insult tasted good on her lipssalty and strongand she got a boost from it.These are my boots.And this is my workshop and I would appreciate it if you would leave.Now.He blinked up at her, and it would be so much more comfortable for her if she could just tell herself that he was stupid.A dumb hockey player.A shitty son.A nobody.But his eyes blazed with intelligence and her skin woke up under his gaze like it was the touch of a lover.The warmth spread over her body, stirring parts of her that hadnt felt warmth in years.It stung.Hurt.And she hated it.Hated him for making her feel it.You design for Baker Leather?See?she told herself.Not dumb at all.She swallowed and nodded, feeling stupidly as if him knowing this piece of her story left her a little more naked, more vulnerable.His grin was wolfish.Mean.He hooked a thumb at the cream bustier behind him.This the prostitute line?She didnt even bother to defend herself, to cry protestations.Shed learned long ago that no one listened.Go away.If I leave, I have to take you with me, he said, turning away.You dont look like youre eager to hear the lawyers.And Im in no hurry.She sat back down and helped herself to a Riesen, even though her teeth hurt from all the sugar.Youre in no hurry to see what your daddy left you?She talked while she chewed.The caramel centers in these damn things just about pulled out her fillings.But that was why she liked them; they punished her while she ate them.He appeared to be in deep contemplation of the tailor dummy in the maligned cream leather bustier.Cant say that I am.I dont believe you.Ive got a lot of money, he said.More than him, probably.I dont need any more.Then whyd you come rushing down here when it all got threatened?She smiled, sitting back in her ratty shirt as if it were silk and lace.He might feign indifference, but he was a man like any other.And men liked her.Or was it that picture we sent?His fingertip touched the thin leather strap of the bustier, tracing along the top, and it looked so damn big.Masculine.Her skin shook.Too much sugar, she told herself, pushing the bag of candy back into the desk.I think a better question is why youre in here crying instead of in the house trying to get what would have been yours if Lyle hadnt died so soon.So soon?Are you kidding?That man hung on longer than anyone expected, just so he could get a look at you and your sister again.His deep hazel eyes watched her and she tilted her chin, unbowed.I wish you were wrong, he murmured.She sat back, stunned by his lack of armor.The humanity hed revealed behind the mask.It wasnt grief, but it wasnt cold anger, and that was surprising.She had no inclination to appease his grief or guilt or whatever it was that was making him drink on the day of his fathers funeral, but she wanted to defend Lyle.His scheming, for all the pain it caused, had been hatched from a pure place.Your daddy loved you, she whispered.His smile was so bitter it was as if hed bitten into a rotten nut.He had a shit way of showing it.On my end it felt like anger and hate most of the time.The rest of the time it just felt like ownership.The air conditioner clicked on, a gunshot in the silence.It was redeeming, somehow, that he not only understood his father, but was saddened by it all.That he wasnt a glacier all the way through wasnt anything she wanted to know about him.She didnt want to understand him, or feel empathy for his complicated pain.Is that why youre drinking your way through the day?She tucked her feet up under her legs.Youre all choked by regret?Wishing you could go back and do it all differently?Hell no, he said.Im drinking because its a damn party.He looked down at his empty tumbler and up at the thin, fragile glass of her greenhouse as if he could already see the arc.The smash and rain of glass all over her work.Danger crackled.His muscles, thick and heavymasculine in the extremebunched under his fine white shirt.She held her breath, held hostage by the momentthe grief and anger had a knife to both their throats.But then, he closed his eyes, and his shoulders relaxed.As if hed put out the fuse, the moment was gone.Controlled.She sucked in a deep breath.Ice Man, indeed.We should go, he said, turning away.Theyre waiting on us.Go on.She kicked her legs off her chair and pulled herself up to her desk as if she were about to apply her nose to the grindstone, when really she was going to Hoover as much sugar and comfort as she could the second he was gone.Im working.Youre worried about Maman?Perceptive bastard.She ran her tongue over her fuzzy teeth, felt the puffy skin on her face without having to touch it.She was a bona fide mess and those women in therethe regal Celeste and the heartbroken Victoriawould turn their noses so high up in the air, theyd get dizzy.Youve been judged by better than them, she reminded herself.No.You should be, he said with a wolfish, messy smile.Shes gonna eat you alive.Lord, the man was pushing her buttons.Then lets go.She stood, jamming her feet into her ragged bunny slippers.She stepped out from behind the desk and suffered Lucs slow perusal.He stepped closer.Closer again.Until she couldnt take a deep breath without her breasts touching the wide white plains of his chest.Her brain fizzed and popped.Her skin screamed at his nearness.It hurt.And it was the kind of pain she remembered, back when she felt things.Like poisonous heady desire.The kind of pain that felt good, like a summer night so hot it melted your reason down to instinct.A deer in the headlights, she didnt even see his hand come up, couldnt brace for it.His touch against the corner of her mouth was electricity and her skin, every inch of her body, was water.The heat of his flesh, the calluses on the tips of his fingers, pulsed through her.Pooled in her stomach.She gasped.Flinched.Her carefully constructed life cracked and hunger flooded in.Chocolate, he breathed and then licked his thumb.Lust was an avalanche through her body, eradicating villages and people.Little skiers minding their business.She stepped away, breaking the contact, and her mind jerked out of pause right into fast forward.A million years ago, men and the way they could make her feel were her favorite candy.The best kind of sweetness.But no longer.That woman was gone.Never to be seen again.She was stronger than desire.Tougher than want.She wouldnt be brought down by a man again.Never.Again.I keep wondering who the hell you are.Jane Simmons?Tara Jean Sweet?I never get any closer to an answer.I could ask you the same thing.Wayne.She pulled herself up by her spine.By her muscle and sinew.His smile was feral and calculating.A predator sizing up his prey.Depending on how things go in the den, I might be your worst nightmare.That was better.She was safer with anger.More comfortable with hate.Then lets go.8 Victoria traced her fingers around Jacobs palm, over and over again.When he was sick in the hospital and she had to wear a hazmat suit just to sit by his side, this was what shed do.Shed draw hearts and smiley faces.Numbers and letters.Shed spell her name on his skin, a map to bring him back to her.The tension in the den was sickening, and if it werent for Jacob telling Celeste scene for scene about the Iron Man movie hed watched against Victorias better judgment, it would be intolerable.A powder keg.As it was, Victoria had to stomach Queen Celeste smiling down at Jacob as if he were just another part of her kingdom.Hes mine, she wanted to hiss and yank him away.But Jacob liked Celeste.And Celeste was kind to Jacob in her own way.As if he were a dog, but her favorite dog.And Victoria was so nervous she could throw up, so having Jacob distracted worked in her favor.How much do I need?she kept wondering.It wasnt as though she needed to live the way she had lived with Joel.That kind of money had been a false security of the worst kind.But she needed to take care of Jacob.School.College.Medical bills.A modest home.The door to the den opened and Luc walked in, smiling as if hed just heard the best joke.Victoria might have written that off to Luc being a jolly drunk, but at his heels was Tara Jean.Looking like death warmed over.Laughter, surprised and unchecked, bubbled out of her throat and she clapped a hand over her mouth.Celeste glanced sideways at Victoria with a wicked little smile on her million dollar mouth.For a second, all those differences between themthat Victoria was the daughter of Lyles mistress, that Celeste hated her, that she hated Celesteall of them were gone.Two women, in a glance, sharing a joke at another womens expenseit was a female language born thousands of years ago.But Tara Jean lifted her chin and sailed past them to go stand next to Eli Turnbull, and the moment popped.Eli lifted an arm over Tara Jeans shoulders and pulled her to his side.Tara Jean curled up there.Safe.Protected.Victorias heart coiled, shrinking from the pain.Not that she cared one way or another about Eli, but that Tara Jean, Bimbo Barbie, had a strong shoulder where she could rest her head during all this pissed Victoria off.I did everything right, she thought for the millionth time, the vile acid of her anger as biting as it had been that first long night her life had begun to unravel.Ponzi scheme.Thinking the words made her skin cringe.We can get started, Mr.Jenkins said.Mom, Jacob whispered, youre hurting my hand.Victoria unclenched her fists and kissed an apology on her sons palms while Mr.Jenkins made his way through the necessary legalese.Mr.Baker made some changes to his will before he died, the lawyer said after droning on for what seemed like hours, and Victoria tuned back in.In her lap, Victorias fingers twisted into knots.Tara Jean, as agreed, will get forty percent of Baker Leather.Jenkins glanced over the top of his glasses toward Tara Jean.In deferment to your wishes, he has left you no money.And II need the Tara Jean stepped forward, wiggling the giant five carat sapphire off her knuckle.It landed on the desk with a thunk.As agreed?Luc asked from the club chair where he was sprawled.He turned twinkling eyes over to Tara Jean, who visibly bristled.What did you do, I wonder, to earn such a thing?Dont be disgusting, Tara Jean hissed, which was all very ironic considering the way shed acted when Victoria and her brother arrived at the ranch.If she wasnt chock full of nerves, Victoria might be interested.How much did she need?she wondered.A million, easy.If she wanted to stay in Toronto.New York was an impossibility.Too many people associated her face with Joels crimes.Eli Turnbull, in recognition of your hard work and the years of hard work dedicated by your father, you are given control of the Angus herd and fifty percent of the profits upon sale.Victoria had no idea what that meant, and Elis face didnt indicate whether that was a good thing or a bad thing.In addition, Jenkins continued to read, the two hundred acres that were your fathers before he sold them to Crooked Creek Ranch is available to you for purchase, at cost and interest free.In the ensuing silence, the page Jenkins turned was loud.Thats it?The two hundred acres Dad sold twenty years ago?At cost?Eli was red faced, his lips barely moving.Now she realized he was angry.How surprising to see him with an emotion.What about the rest of the land that belonged to my family?The will doesnt mention any other land.The room was held hostage until finally, white lipped and controlled, Eli nodded once and everyone took in a breath of relief.Good God, Victoria thought, giddy with nerves, were off to a rocky start.For Celeste.Jenkins cleared his throat and opened a safe deposit box at his elbow.He took out a dozen velvet jewelry boxes of various sizes and slid them toward the front of the desk.Victoria could feel Celestes hard wired stillness.The woman practically rattled in her seat.You gonna get that stuff?Jacob asked in a whisper.Why dont you go get it for me, Celeste said with a smile that hummed with sorrow.Victoria closed her eyes for a moment.The restrained and repressed emotions in the room were threatening to cut off all air supply.Theyd all just asphyxiate in silence.Jacob came back with the velvet boxes stacked to his chin.Theres a note.From Lyle, Jenkins said, his eyes darting up to Celestes and then back down to his paper.These are yours, Jenkins read.They always were.They always will be.Divorce changed nothing.Not for me.With trembling hands, Celeste took the boxes from Jacob and set them on her lap.She didnt open them.Her eyes, full of tears that dared not fall, stared straight ahead.Diamonds, Victoria thought, her desperation turning her into an ugly, grasping mercenary.Lots of diamonds.Victoria could live off one of those boxes for a year, she had no doubt.Jenkins turned another page and Victoria held her breath, waiting for her name.Half a million.Shed sell the last of her jewelry.She could live frugally.Plant a garden.Get rid of the car.Wayne Luc Baker, you are the sole inheritor of the twenty five hundred remaining acres of Crooked Creek Ranch, including all mineral and water rights and all other assets, which includes a fifty percent interest in the Angus herd and sixty percent control of Baker Leather.The words detonated like a bomb.All of it?Luc got all of it?Youve got to be kidding me, Luc said, staring slack jawed at Jenkins.Yeah, Tara Jean piped up from the back of the room.This is a mistake.Jenkins shook his head.Its all WaynLucs.What about me?Victoria thought.Good Christ.Luc ran a hand down his face.This is a nightmare.Yes!It is!Ill sell it, Luc said, his face growing stormy.Fuck him.Ill sell it.Ill buy it.Eli sounded hard and sure and confident.Great.Luc nodded.Name your price Its not that simple, Jenkins said.It is, Luc insisted.For me its that simple.What about us?Victoria asked, her voice the weak, pathetic cry of a weak, pathetic woman.Luc turned, and she refused to look at his face.She knew he didnt understand her and she knew she disappointed him, but she couldnt be like him.She couldnt not care.Jacob and me?she asked.Theres nothing in there about us?May I continue?Jenkins asked, staring at Luc as if he were a child behaving badly.Luc nodded, his control regained.Victoria Schulman and her son will receive a trust of one million dollars.She collapsed back against the seat, her body boneless, her mind empty with relief.On the condition Her body curled upright.What condition?she asked.How like him, how very like her bastard father!Even after he was dead he wanted her to crawl.That Wayne My name is Luc, Luc said through his teeth.That Mr.Baker acts as CEO of Baker Leather and stays at the ranch without selling it for the duration of his off season.Five months at minimum.9 Shock emptied Tara Jeans body and she was just a crumpled paper sack in dirty sweat pants.Luc was her boss.Why didnt she see this coming?Shed thought, when she bothered to think about it at all, that Lyle would split the rest of the company shares with his family, but as the 40 percent owner, shed be in control.And she would be her own boss.Or even if Lyle gave one of his children control of Baker Leather, that person would be an absentee owner.Collecting checks and leaving her to run the business no one seemed to care about.But now, Luc was her boss and he was here.Lyle, what did you do to us?Luc had bolted the moment his death sentence had been delivered.Celeste had left after him.Victoria remained on the couch, a black puddle of despair.Tara Jean had a relationship with despair.She knew the pit well, but Victoria would have to find her own way out.Tara Jean didnt have a rope to throw her.Not that Victoria would have taken it.Numb, Tara Jean signed the last of the paperwork that had been drawn up three months ago.The day after the doctors told Lyle he didnt have much longer to live.The day hed concocted this whole plan.Her services had been paid for with a 40 percent share in Baker Leathers.Lyle got the whole gold digging fiance act and she got security.For the first time in her life she got security.Amazing, how hed managed to save her and screw her all at the same time.Thank you, Lyle, you son of a bitch.She sent the prayer heavenward and stepped out of the way so Eli could sign.She wanted to say something to Eli.To ease some of the hurt and disappointment he must be feeling.But he just walked out of the den, shoulders back, eyes straight, never giving the impression hed just been fucked by Lyle Baker.Tara Jean was tired.Heartsore and desperate to be back in her own home, and she practically ran out of the ranch house to her studio.This was a new chapter and she needed to come back here on Monday with a tactic, a plan for managing Luc.She pushed open the greenhouse door and headed over to her desk to get her purse and keys, and some much needed distance between her and the house that betrayal had built.Honestly, Lyle, she thought, when you play God, you go all out.She took off her slippers and slid her feet into the only shoes she had here.Three inch black stilettos.Overkill with sweats cut off at the knee, but that was where she was at.Did you know he was going to do this?a voice asked from behind her and she jumped, smashing her hands and hip against the metal edge of her desk.She swore and tried to shake out the sparks.Answer the question!She spun to face Luc, dark and looming in the doorway.For a second her heart sputtered in fear.He was a man pushed to the wall.And men pushed to the wall were dangerous animals.No, she said, pulling her bag out of the drawer and swinging it over her shoulder.Bullshit.The word exploded out of his mouth and she realized he was here to take his anger out on her.Think what you want.She stepped toward the door.But, predictably, Luc didnt move and she lost it.Whatever scrap of control or cool that might have survived the firebombing of the last few days just gave up the fight.You think I wanted this?You?As my boss?Hes playing around with my life too.His eyes didnt budge from hers and she felt as if her skin might start smoking at any moment.They were bound in this.Stuck together, and as much as she might want to fight and claw her way out, she couldnt.Play nice, the demon whispered.He said youd stay for your sister, she said after the silence started slapping her around a little.Well, he sure rigged it that way, didnt he?He rubbed a hand through his hair, looking every minute of his age and occupation.After that absent touch earlier today, shed told herself she wouldnt be moved by this man.But here she stood, in the same damn place just a few hours later and she felt bad for him.Bad.For him?Which was honestly ridiculous.The man was her freaking boss.You gonna do it?she asked.Stick around?He braced himself against the door frame.His muscles pulled against his shirt, and all that desire that had woken up a few hours ago was running around her body like a toddler on a sugar rush.She nodded, trying to slap that toddler into a harness.And run the company.His smile was sharp, lethal.Worried about your boss?This company matters to me, Luc.And yes, Im worried that youre going to run it into the ground out of spite.Im notI dont care enough to run it into the ground.Im a fucking hockey player!I dont belong here.So, she said as if he might not understand English.Are you going to leave?He stared off at the horizon, shaking his head, as if the decision hadnt been made yet.Her mouth fell open, stunned that he was considering kicking in his sisters teeth like that.But if there was one thing she knew, it was that people were really only loyal to themselves.Luc was no different.The web Lyle had constructed had Luc well and truly stuck.If she werent a victim of the old mans machinations herself, shed be impressed.If the inquisition is over, she said, rattling her keys for emphasis, Id like to go home.Home?His dark eyebrows knit together over his eyes.You dont live here?Your private investigator didnt tell you that?He breathed hard through his nose and after a moment shook his head.After I found out youd changed your name, I figured the rest of it didnt matter and I called him off.You had me pegged, huh?She couldnt resist the sarcasm.Figured the worst and left it at that?Dont be sanctimonious, Tara.He paid you forty percent of a leather company to pretend to be his fiance, didnt he?It was all an act, wasnt it?What to do when this whole charade was over hadnt even crossed her mind.Of course shed thought when it was all said and done, Luc and his sister would pick up their millions and head back to the land of the spoiled.Shed never imagined coming clean.Or having to explain herself.Yes, she said, her voice loud and bright in the dim of the greenhouse.The sun was heading down behind the other side of the house, bringing premature night to her kingdom.He knew youd try to stop the wedding and all he wanted was to get you down here.His laughter was rocky, covered in dirt.Well he sure knew us, didnt he.And he used the right kind of bait.She bristled, her feelings injured despite herself.Your father was good to me.Im sure he was, he said, insinuating and nasty.He never touched me.Never.His eyes skated over her body, carved figure eights around her chest.It was ugly and juvenile and she knew he barely meant it.He was a playground bully, and all he wanted was to see someone else bleed.Screw yourself, Luc.Im leaving.She stepped past him, into the heat of the afternoon.He laughed, low and dry but without rancor, without the bitter edge that kept her on her toes, and the sound was so unexpected it was like finding diamonds in her breakfast cereal.Their eyes caught for a moment.And then another.His body tensed, leaned slightly toward her, and she could feel the kiss in the air between them.She could see it in his dark, shuttered eyes, in the heavy set of his shoulders.In another life, she might have let him kiss her.They were both grieving in their own way.He wasnt quite the devil shed first thought he was, though she wasnt sure he wasnt a different kind of devil altogether.He was beautiful and she was weak.But this was now.Now after Lyle died, giving her this security, and she didnt have to kiss men to feel better.Even if she wanted to.Ill see you on Monday.She slid her aviator sunglasses down low over her eyes.I cant wait.His voice managed the high wire act between threatening and inviting.The pea gravel crunched and slid under the thin soles of her shoes, every stone a small pain, a reminder, until she couldnt take it anymore and she stopped.Tara turned to face him only to find him watching her.Dont do this, she told herself, you dont care.Not really.And these people dont care about you.If you were on fire, Victoria would drink the water rather than use it to put you out.But there had been so much grief lately, she didnt want to witness any more.Your sister, she said, and paused, not exactly sure what she wanted to say.Dont break her heart?Dont hurt her any more than shes been hurt?Is one good shove away from losing it?You dont need to worry about my sister, he said, circling the wagons.Right then, she knew he wouldnt leave.She was going to have to live with him for five months.As her boss.He stood there, just outside the doorway to her world, to everything she had fought and bled for.He was a creature of privilege.His sister, too.And boo hoo, their daddy didnt love them like they wanted to be loved.Theyd survived.More than survived.He had money.Safety.Christ, Victoria had a son.The two were on a totally different planet from the one where she lived.And while betrayal and pain and long, lonely nights might seem universal, it all depended on who was experiencing it.Youre right, she said and left.Luc couldnt look at his sister without wanting to start tearing the ranch down brick by brick, so he went to the one place he was sure she wouldnt be.Celestes room.Maman was propped up against the headboard, looking a mess.Well, as much of a mess as Celeste ever looked.Her jacket and shoes were gone.Her hair, rumpled on the pillows.Her lipstick smeared all over the glass of amber liquid in her hand.Around her, like blue velvet islands rising from the white sea of the duvet, were the jewelry boxes.They were all still closed.You all right?she asked, looking at him over the rim of her glass as she finished her drink.He nodded and grabbed the Scotch from the liquor cabinet, poured her another, and then put it back.Youre not joining me?she asked, and he shook his head.He was reaching an uncomfortable place, where frenzy and anger fed off each other until he didnt have control.And he needed control.Hed almost kissed Tara Jean.If that wasnt an indicator that he needed to get his shit together, he didnt know what was.The woman was like that candy she was always eating.Sweet, but bad for him.Whats in the boxes?he asked.He sat at her feet and his weight pulled the smallest of the blue boxes toward him.Go ahead, she said, her negligence a thin veneer over an unexpected grief.The box creaked open in his hands.Heavy duty bling.In ring form.My engagement ring, she said, and she used her leg to sweep the rest of them toward him.Open the others.There was a gold and diamond necklace that looked like something a queen might wear.When I caught him cheating.The first time.A thick diamond bracelet set with emeralds as big as his eyeballs.The day you were born.His heir.He was so excited.Pearls.His grandmothers.I wore them at our wedding.Dangly opal and diamond earrings.When Victoria was born.An apology.In very poor taste.A dozen boxes.All with a story to tell.The guy was a bastard, he sighed.Not always.And not at first.He was, a long time ago, kind in his own way.I thinkperhaps when I left, things got very bad.Its not your fault he hurt us, Maman.Im sorry, son, but I dont quite believe you.Her smile was cracked and broken, full of a lifetime of sadness.He put his hand over hers and she clutched his fingers.He waited for her to say more, but she was silent and it felt good to sit there beside his mother, bathed in the familiar scent of Chanel No5.Im glad youre here, he said.I imagine youll be sticking around, she said, and he stood back up.The frenzy, the hot dance of his nerve endings needed to be cooled off.It would be the right thing, wouldnt it?Are you thinking of doing the wrong thing?Is it so hard to believe that it might be good for Victoria?he asked.That if she was forced to stand on her own two feet maybe shed stop looking to other people to solve her problems?You want to be the one to make sure she does it?She took a sip, her cagey eyes missing nothing.Shell hate you, and it will probably be forever.It was the truth.He knew it, but knowing it didnt make it sit better.And what about Jacob?she asked, turning the screws.I know about Jacob, he said.I get it.I understand.All right.His words echoed into a silence that pounded at his head.He had to get out of here, he had to burn off this anger or hed lose it.He pulled his shirt out of his pants.Where are you going?Maman asked.Running.Dr.Matthewss orders had been explicit.He needed to rest.No working out.No ice time, no physical exertion, for at least six weeks.But he couldnt just sit here and do nothing.Luc, his mother whispered, and he paused to look at her before walking out the door.A gorgeous, ageless woman surrounded by all that was left of love.Diamonds and regret.You cant undo it, she whispered.Your decision right now, what you do with your sister, you cant change it once its done.Youyou cant go back.Her pain ran headlong against his anger, doing nothing to cool it.Nothing to calm him.He nodded once and left.Buttons flew off his shirt as he yanked it free.Goddamnit.Had he even packed his running shoes?Luc?His sisters voice was a dagger between his shoulder blades.He took two deep breaths before turning to face her.So pale and resolute, she stood in the hallway, so thin and fragile a good wind would knock her over.The men in her life had kicked her.Used her and betrayed her.Both of them.Father.Husband.He couldnt join their ranks.Im staying.Youyou dont have to do that.That she tried made him love her more.Yes, I do, he said, and then, because everything in his life was falling apart and he couldnt be trusted not to scream his rage into the face of his sister, he left.To battle the demon of his anger on his own.10 At five oclock on Monday morning, Tara Jean was ready to start her new life.Shed hibernated for twenty four straight hours and woken up with a plan.She simply wouldnt deal with Luc.Not unless she absolutely had to.Also, she decided, it was time to get rid of the crutch.The monkey on her back.Shed quit smoking two years ago, drinking four years ago, sleeping with inappropriate men six years agosurely she could kick the candy habit.Considering that this truly was the first day of the rest of her life, she wore the kind of leather that made the demon happy: short and tight.A red skirt from her first design season that wasnt much bigger than a Band Aid, with an oversized white button up shirt, which she didnt bother buttoning much of.The black peep toe heels and big chunky necklace classed her up a bit.Shed make the Bakers forget theyd ever seen her bunny slippers.The dawn was pearly and damp, the color of pigeons after a rain.But the moment she stepped outside, all of the hair on the back of her neck stood in terrified attention.Youre being watched.She ducked back into the vestibule of her building, pulling the safety door shut, unable to breathe until she heard the big lock catch.Her panicked breath bloomed against the cross hatched glass as she peered out into the small parking lot, waiting for movement.But the cars didnt even twitch.She looked to the right and left of the door as best she could through the glass, and she was patient, but she didnt see a thing move.Not for many long minutes.Youre being paranoid, she told herself.Her hand cupped the heavy pounding of her heart, holding panic in her palm.Shed changed her name.Used disposable cell phones, didnt have a credit card.The apartment was leased under Lyles name, utilities paid for by the company.But Dennis was out of jail by now.And hed be looking for her.She crushed her hair against the glass, resting her head on the door.Adrenaline made her stomach churn and her head fuzzy.Stop it, she whispered.Just stop it.What you should do is get in your car and drive away, the demon said, sucking on a Virginia Slim.What the hell do you know?she muttered.She didnt want to run.Not anymore.She had a new life, and this was the first damn day of it.Taking herself in hand, she pushed open the door and held her head high as she walked to her car.She wasnt going to cower.Not for the likes of Dennis Murphy.The morning was already hot by the time she got to the ranch and the sun hadnt even been up very long, which did not bode well for the rest of the day and its relationship to her hair.Her body, against her express demands, tightened in expectation.Luc.As if to defy her body and those expectations, she didnt look around as she got out of the car.She didnt glance over her shoulder, seeking him out.Nope.She opened the greenhouse and the first order of business was taking every stash of candyfrom the gummi bears in the supply cabinet to the Riesen in the bottom drawer of her desk, the Mike and Ikes in her purse, all of itand dumping it in the garbage can.It hurt, she couldnt lie, but it was a new day.After that bit of housekeeping, she unpacked the sleek laptop Lyle had bought her.Shed had wireless installed in the whole ranch last year, so it took only moments for her to access her emails.Her business phone rang, distracting her from an email from a Nigerian prince who so desperately wanted to give her his money.Baker Leather, she said, deleting the email.Hi, Tara Jean, its Randy Jenkins.She felt actual affection for Randy, who, during the process of her taking over operations for Baker Leather, never treated her with anything but respect.What can I do for you, Randy?Well, Im looking for Luc.Luc?She spun in her chair.Whyd you call me?Because hes not answering my calls.And I know youre still at the ranch.Is he?Far as I know, she said, though she had no real proof.A sense.That expectation low in her belly.Her skin buzzing with dim electricity.Well, I think you better hunt him down.I need him to come in and sign papers so the Crooked Creek and Baker Leather can actually do business.Im doing plenty of business.Well, not for much longer if he doesnt come in here and relinquish signing authority.You cant sign a check for over five thousand dollars, Tara Jean.Not without a letter from me signed by Luc.What are you talking about?she asked.I own forty percent of the business!That doesnt change things.Not unless Luc cooperates.She slouched back in her chair, staring up through the glass ceiling at the birds flying through the blue sky.One thing she was sure of: there was no way, absolutely no way she was going to get tangled with Luc on the first day of her new life.We paid all the big bills before Lyle died, she said.I can handle things until next month.And then ?And then, I figure youll have taken care of this little problem.There was a long silence that gave Tara Jean the impression that real business owners didnt act this way.Fine.She was learning.
