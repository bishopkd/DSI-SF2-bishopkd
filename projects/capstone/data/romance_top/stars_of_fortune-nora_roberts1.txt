 As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods;  They kill us for their sport.WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE      Was it a vision, or a waking dream?Fled is that music:do I wake or sleep?JOHN KEATS      PROLOGUE     			Once, in a time long ago, in a world beyond our own, three goddesses gathered to celebrate the dawn of a new queen.Many whod traveled across the land and skies, through time and through space, had brought gifts of gold and jewels, of rich silks and precious crystals.But the goddesses three wished for more unique gifts.They considered a winged horse, but news came that a traveler had flown in on one, making it a gift for the new queen.They debated gifting her with beauty beyond compare, with wisdom or uncommon grace.They couldnt make her immortal, and knew from those who were that this was both blessing and curse.But they could give her an immortal gift.A gift that will shine for her, for all time.Celene stood with her friends, her sisters, on the sand, white as diamonds, on the verge of the ink blue sea, lifted her face to the night sky, to the swimming moon.The moon is ours, Luna reminded her.We cannot give what we are pledged to honor.Stars.Arianrhod lifted her hand, palm up.She closed her eyes, her fingers.And smiling, opened them again.Now in her palm a jewel of ice glowed.Stars for Aegle, the radiant.Stars.Now Celene held out her hand, opened it.She held a jewel of fire.Stars for Aegle, who will shine like her name.Luna joined them, produced a jewel of water.Stars for Aegle, the brilliant.There should be more.Celene turned the burning star in her hand.A wish.Luna stepped closer to the sea, let the water lay cool kisses on her feet.A wish from each for the queen, and into the star.For mine, a strong and hopeful heart.A strong and questing mind.Celene held the fiery star aloft.And a strong and adventurous spirit.Arianrhod raised both hands, one holding the star, the other lifted toward the moon.These stars to shine while worlds turn.They shed their light in the queens name for all to see.The Fire Star began to lift into the sky, and the star of ice, the star of water with it.They spun as they rose, showering light, over land and sea, pulled toward the moon and its cool white power.A shadow passed under them, a silent snake.Nerezza glided across the beach toward the watera shadow smearing the light.You meet without me, my sisters.You are not of us.Arianrhod turned toward her, with Luna and Celene flanking her.We are the light, and you the dark.There is no light without dark.Nerezzas lips curved, but fury lived in her eyes, and with it the early blooms of a madness yet to fully flower.When the moon wanes, the darkness eats it.Bite by bite.The light prevails.Luna gestured as the stars flew now, trails of color in their wake.And now there are more.You, like supplicants, bring gifts for the queen.She is no more than a weak, simpering girl when it is we who could rule.Who should rule.We are guardians, Celene reminded her.We are the watchers, not rulers.We are gods!This world and others are ours.Only think of it, and what we can make from our powers combined.All will bow to us, and we would live in youth and beauty forever.We have no desire for power over the mortals, the immortals, the demimortals.Such matters bring blood and war and death.Arianrhod dismissed the notion.To crave forever is to dismiss the beauty and wonder of the cycle.She lifted her face again as the stars theyd made spilled their light.Death comes.We will watch this new queen live and die as we did the last.She will live a hundred years times seven.This I have seen.And while she lives, Celene continued, there will be peace.Peace.The word hissed out between Nerezzas sneering lips.Peace is nothing but a tedious lull between the stretch of the dark.Go back to your shadows, Nerezza.Luna dismissed her with a careless wave of her hand.Tonight is for joy, for light, for celebrationsnot your ambitions and thirsts.The night is mine.She slashed out a hand, and lightning, black as her eyes, sliced the white sand, the dark sea, and arrowed up toward the flying stars.It cut through the streams of light moments before the stars found their home in a gentle curve at the base of the moon.For an instant the stars trembled there, and the worlds beneath them trembled.What have you done?Celene whirled on her.Only added to your gift, sisters.They will fall one day, the stars of fire, ice, and water, tumble from the sky with all their power, their wishes, the light and the dark combined.Laughing now, Nerezza lifted her arms high as if to pluck the stars from the sky.And when they fall into my hands, the moon dies for all and ever, and the dark wins.They are not for you.Arianrhod stepped forward, but Nerezza carved black lightning through the sand, left a smoldering chasm between them.Smoke streamed up from it to foul the air.When I have them, this world dies with the moon, as you will.And as I eat your powers, I will open others long sealed.The pale peace you worship will become all raging torment, all agony and fear and death.Through the smoke, she lifted her hands, glowing in her own desire.Your own stars have sealed your fortunes, and given me mine.You are banished.Arianrhod lashed out, and hot blue lightning that cut like a whip wrapped its tongue around Nerezzas ankle.The scream ripped the air, shuddered into the ground.Before Arianrhod could drag the dark into the chasm of her own creation, Nerezza spread thin black wings, snapped the whip of light as she flew up.Blood from her ankle burned and smoked in the white sand.I make my fate, she shouted.I will come back, take the stars and the worlds I wish.And you will know death and pain and the end of all you love.The wings folded around her, and she was gone.She can do nothing to us or ours, Luna insisted.Do not doubt her power or her thirst.Celene stared into the dark gulf, felt a terrible sorrow.There will be death here now, and blood, and pain and sorrow.She has left it behind her like a stain.She must never have the stars.Well bring them back now, Arianrhod said.Destroy them.Too much to risk while her power still stings the air, Celene replied.So we only wait, and guard and risk all?Arianrhod argued.We allow her to twist a bright gift into something dark and deadly?We cannot.We will not.They will fall?Luna asked Celene.I can see they will, in a bright flash, but I cannot see when.Then we will make the when, and the where.This we can do.Luna took her sisters hands.In another place, another time, but not together.Nodding, Arianrhod looked up at the stars, so bright and beautiful over the land shed loved and guarded since her time began.If even one falls into her hands, or one like her ...Celene closed her eyes, opened herself.Many will seek the stars, the power, the fortune, which is the same.And the fate.It is all one.And we, reflected light, must send of us on the quest.Of us?Luna repeated.We do not go to retrieve them?No, that is not for us.I know we must bide here and it will be done as it is done.We choose the time, the place.In silence, Arianrhod added.Even in our minds.She is not to know when and where they will fall.They joined minds as well as hands, and each took her journey, followed her star where it willed as it tumbled from the sky.Each hid her gift, each laid the power of protection over it.And with minds joined, with no words spoken, each understood what must now rest in the hands and hearts of others.Now we must believe.Luna tightened her grip on Arianrhods hand when her sister said nothing.We must.If we do not, how will those who come of us?I believe we have done what we must.That is enough to believe.Celene sighed.Even gods must bow to Fate.Or fight what tries to destroy them.You will fight, Celene said, smiling now.Luna will trust.And I will do all I can to see.Now, we wait.Together they looked up to the moon that lived in sky and soul, and the three bright stars that curved to it.ONE     			Dreams plagued her, waking and sleeping.She understood dreams, visions, the knowing.They had been part of her all of her life, and for most of her life shed learned to block it out, push it all away.But these wouldnt relent, no matter how she pitted her will against them.Dreams of blood and battle; of strange, moonstruck lands.In them, the faces and voices of people unknown but somehow vitally familiar lived with her.The woman with the fierce and canny eyes of a wolf, the man with the silver sword.They roamed her dreams with a woman who rose from the sea laughing, the man with the golden compass.And through all of them, strongly, the dark haired man who held lightning in his hands.Who were they?How did sheor would sheknow them?Why did she feel such a strong need for them, all of them?With them walked death and painshe knewand yet with them came the chance for true joy, true self.True love.She believed in true lovefor others.Shed never sought it for herself, as love demanded so much, brought such chaos into a life.So much feeling.She wanted, had always wanted, the quiet and settled, and believed shed found it in her little house in the mountains of North Carolina.There she had the solitude shed sought.There she could spend her days painting, or in her garden without interference or interruption.Her needs were few; her work provided enough income to meet them.Now her dreams were haunted by five people who called her by name.Why couldnt she find theirs?She sketched her dreamsthe faces, the seas and hills and ruins.Caves and gardens, storms and sunsets.Over the long winter she filled her workboard with the sketches, and began to pin them to her walls.She painted the man with lightning in his hands, spending days perfecting every detail, the exact shade and shape of his eyesdeep and dark and hoodedthe thin white scar, like a lightning bolt, scoring his left eyebrow.He stood on a cliff, high above a boiling sea.Wind streamed through his dark hair.She could all but feel it, like hot breath.And he was fearless in the face of the storm as death flew toward him.Somehow she stood with him, just as fearless.She couldnt sleep until shed finished it, wept when she did.She feared shed lost her mind, and visions were all she had left.For days she left the painting on the easel while he watched her work or clean or sleep.Or dream.She told herself shed pack it for shipping, send it to her agent for sale.And dipping her brush, she signed it at last.Sasha Riggsher name on the verge of the storm wrecked sea.But she didnt pack it for shipping.She packed others instead, the work of the long winter, arranged for transport.Exhausted, she gave in, curled on the couch in the attic shed converted to her studio, and let the dreams take her.The storm raged.Wind whipping, the sea crashing, jagged spears of lightning hurled from the sky like flaming bolts from a bow.The rain swept in from the sea toward the cliff in a thick curtain.But he stood, watching it.And held out his hand for hers.Im waiting for you.I dont understand this, any of this.Of course you do, you more than most.When he brought her hand to his lips, she felt love simply saturate her.Who hides from themselves, Sasha, as you do?I only want peace.I want the quiet.I dont want storms, and battles.I dont want you.Lies.His lips curved as he brought her hand to them again.You know youre lying to me, to yourself.How much longer will you refuse to live as you were meant to?To love as you were born to?He cupped her face in his hands, and the ground shook under her.Im afraid.Face it.I dont want to know.See it.We cant begin without you.We cant end it until we begin.Find me, Sasha.Come find me.He pulled her in, took her lips with his.As he did, the storm broke over them with mad fury.This time, she embraced it.She woke, tired still, pushed herself up, pressed her fingers to her shadowed eyes.Find me, she muttered.Where?I wouldnt know where to start looking if I wanted to.Her fingers trailed down to her lips, and she swore she still felt the pressure of his.Enough.Its all enough now.She rose quickly, began to pull the sketches from the walls, the board, letting them fall to the floor.Shed take them out, throw them out.Burn them.Get them out of her house, out of her head.Shed get out herself, take a trip somewhere, anywhere.It had been years since shed gone anywhere.Somewhere warm, she told herself as she frantically yanked down her dreams.A beach somewhere.She could hear her own breath heaving, see her own fingers trembling.Near to breaking, she lowered to the floor amid the sketches, a woman too thin with the weight the dreams had stolen, her long blond hair bundled up into its habitual messy bun.Shadows plagued her eyes of a clear and crystal blue.She looked down at her hands.There was talent there.She always had been, always would be, grateful for that gift.But she carried other gifts, not so gratefully.In the dream, hed asked her to see.Nearly all her life shed done all she could to block the sight shed been born with.Yes, to hide from herself, just as hed said.If she opened to it, accepted it, there would be pain and sorrow.And the knowledge of what might be.She closed her eyes.Shed clean upgive herself time.Shed pick up all the sketches and file them away.She wouldnt burn them, of course she wouldnt burn them.That had been fear talking.Shed file them, and take a trip.Get away from home for a week or two, let herself think and decide.On her hands and knees, she began to gather the sketches, organizing them in her way.The woman with the fierce eyes, the man with the sword, sketches of her dream people together.Seascapes and landscapes, a palace shining on a hill, a circle of stones.She laid one of the dozens of the man shed just dreamed of on a pile, reached for another.And knew.Shed drawn the sickle shaped island from various viewpoints, and this one showed its high cliffs, its undulating hills thick with trees.Showed it floating in the sea, washed with sunlight.Buildings jumbled together to form a city in the foreground, and the stretch of land, speared with mountains spread in the distance.The pencil sketch took on color and life as she studied it.So much green, a thousand shades of it from dusky to emerald.So much blue, deep and rich or frothing with waves surrounding it.She saw boats sailing, figures diving off seawalls to swim and splash.And she saw the promontory where shed stood with him as the storm flew in.All right then, Ill go.Was she giving in, she wondered, or standing up?But shed go, shed look.It would either end the dreams, or bring them to life as the sketch came to life in her hands.She went over to her little desk, opened her laptop.And booked a flight to Corfu.* * *  			Giving herself only two days to pack, arrange details, close up the house meant she couldnt change her mind.She slept on the plane, dreamlessly, grateful for the respite.And still the cab ride from the airport to the hotel shed chosen near Old Town was a blur.Disoriented, she checked in, struggling to remember to smile, to exchange the expected small talk with the front desk, with the cheerful bellman with the cheerful eyes and thick accent as they rode the narrow elevator to her room.She hadnt asked for a particular floor or a view.It was enough shed taken this step, wherever it would lead her.But she wasnt surprised, not at all surprised, when steps into the room she barely noticed, she faced the windows, the blue sea, and the spread of the sand she knew so well.She smiled away the bellmans offer to fetch her ice, or anything she might wish.She only wanted solitude again.The airports, the plane, so many people.They crowded her still.Alone, she walked to the window, opened it to cool spring air that smelled of the sea and flowers, and studied the scene shed sketched weeks before, and carried with others in a portfolio in her suitcase.She felt nothing, not now, but the fogginess of jet lag and travel fatigue.And some wonder that shed actually traveled so far on impulse.Turning away, she unpacked to give herself some sense of place and order.Then just lay down on the bed and dropped into sleep again.Lightning and storms, the beat of the sun, the beat of the sea.Three stars so bright and brilliant her eyes stung.When they shot away from the curve of the moon, fell in streams of light, the world trembled from the strikes of power.Blood and battle, fear and flight.Climbing high, diving deep.Her dream lover taking her mouth, taking her body, making her ache with feelings.So much.Too much.Never enough.Her own laughter, barely recognized, sprung from joy.Tears shed, flooding from grief.And in the darkness, a light burned through.In the darkness she held fire in her hand.As she held it up, for all to see, the earth quaked, rocks tumbled.What was fury flew at her with claws and teeth.For Gods sake, Sasha, wake up!Get your ass moving.What?She woke with a start, the voice still echoing inside her head, her heart still thumping with fear.Just another dream, she told herself, just one more to add to her collection.The light had softened, and lay now like silk over the water.She had no idea how long shed slept, but the dream voice had something right.It was time to wake up.She showered off the travel, changed into fresh clothes.Since she wasnt working, she left her hair down.She ordered herself out of the room.Shed go down, sit on the terrace, have a drink.Shed come, given up her quiet and alone, and come.Now something or someone needed to come to her.She found her way out, strolled under a pergola thickly twined with wisteria already starting to bloom.Its scent followed her as she turned away from the pool, the canvas sling chairs lined up around its skirt, toward a stone terrace.Clay pots gloriously crowded with flowers of hot reds and purples glowed as the sun wheeled west.The fronds of palm trees hung still.Tables under shading umbrellasall in bright whitescattered over the stone.She noted only a few were occupied, and was grateful.Not solitude perhaps, but quiet.She thought to take one a bit apart from the others, started to angle away.The woman also sat a bit apart.Her short, sun streaked brown hair had long bangs that swept down to the amber lenses of her sunglasses.She sat back, her bright orange Chucks propped on the other chair of her table for two as she sipped something frothy out of a champagne flute.The light shimmered for a moment, and Sashas heart stuttered with it.She knew she stared, and couldnt stop.And understood why when the woman tipped down her sunglasses, and stared back over them.The eyes of a wolf, tawny and fierce.Sasha fought back the urge to simply turn around, go back to her room where it was safe.Instead she mentally shoved herself forward and walked over while those golden eyes appraised her.Im sorry, she began.For what?I ...Do you know me?The woman raised her eyebrows under the long bangs.Are you somebody I should know?I know your face, Sasha thought.Ive seen it countless times.Could I sit down?The woman angled her head, continued her cool, unblinking study.Carelessly she slid her feet off the chair.Sure, but if youre thinking about hitting on me, except for a one nighter in college, I stick with men.No, its not that.Sasha sat, tried to find her bearings.Before she could, a waiter in a white jacket stopped by the table.Kalispera.Could I bring you a drink, miss?Yes, actually, yes.Ah, what are you drinking?The woman lifted her glass.Peach Bellini.That sounds just right.Would you like another?Ill buy you a drink.Under her thick sweep of bangs, the womans eyebrows lifted.Sure.Two then, thanks.Im Sasha, she said when he left to fill the order.Sasha Riggs.Riley Gwin.Riley.A name, she thought, to go with the face.I know how this is going to sound, but ...Ive dreamed about you.Riley took another sip, smiled.It sounds like youre hitting on me.And youre really pretty, Sasha, but  			No, no, I mean literally.I recognized you because Ive dreamed about you, for months now.Okay.What was I doing?I cant expect you to believe me.But the dreams are why Im here, in Corfu.I dont Wait.The sketches, she thought, and pushed to her feet.A picture was worth a thousand, after all.I want to show you something.Will you wait until I come back?Riley only shrugged, lifted her glass.Ive got another drink coming, so Ill be here for a while yet.Five minutes, Sasha promised, and hurried away.Sipping her drink, Riley considered.She knew all about dreams, and wouldnt discount them out of hand.Shed seen and experienced far too much in her life to discount anything out of hand.And this Sasha Riggs struck her as sincere.Nervy, wound tight, but sincere.Still, she had her own reasons for being in Corfu, and they didnt include starring in someone elses dreams.The waiter came back with a tray, set the drinks, a bowl of fat olives, another of fancy nuts on the table.The other lady?he asked.She forgot something.Shell be right back.Riley handed him her empty glass.Efkharisto.She tried an almond, went back to contemplating the sea, glanced back again when she heard the hurried footstepswedged sandals on stone.Sasha sat again, holding a leather portfolio.Im an artist, she began.Congratulations.Ive had these dreams all winter.They started right after the first of the year.Every night.Waking dreams, too, but she wasnt ready to share that much.I sketched the people, the places in them, the ones that kept reoccurring.She opened the portfolio, chose the sketch that had brought her to where she sat.I drew this weeks ago.Riley took the sketch, lips pursing as she studied it.Youre good, and yeah, this is Corfu.And this is you.Sasha laid down a sketch, full body, of Riley.She wore cargo pants, hiking boots, a battered leather jacket, a wide brimmed hat.Her hand rested on the butt of the knife sheathed at her belt.As Riley lifted the sketch, Sasha set down another.So is this.A head and shoulders sketch this time, of Riley looking straight ahead with a curled lip smile.What is this?Riley muttered.I dont know, and need to find out.I thought I was losing my mind.But youre real, and youre here.Like me.I dont know about the others.What others?There are six of us, including me.Sasha dug into the portfolio again.Working together, traveling together.I work alone.So do I.  She felt giddy now, both vindicated and a little crazed.I dont know any of them.She held out another sketch.I have individual sketches of all of them, and others with some of us together, more with all of us, like this one.I dont know them.The sketch showed Riley, dressed much as shed been in the other, and Sasha, in boots, pants, a snap brimmed hat rather than the sandals and flowy dress she wore now.Another woman with hair tumbling to her waist, and three men.Three hot men, Riley thought, all standing together on a trail, forested hills around them, grouped together as if posing for a photograph.You Sasha, right?Yes.Yes, Im Sasha.Well, Sasha, you sure know how to dream men.Theyre all smoking.Ive never seen any of them before, outside of the dreams.But I feel ...I know them, know everyone here.And this one.Unable to resist, Sasha touched a finger to the figure standing beside her, standing hipshot, his thumb hooked in the front pocket of worn jeans.Sharp cheekbones, dark hairshe knew it to be a deep, rich browncarelessly curling past the neckline of his T shirt.His smile spoke of confidence, and of charmand a little mystery.What about this one?Riley prompted.He holds lightning.I dont know if thats a symbol or what it means.And I dream wethat we ...Sex dreams?Amused, Riley took a closer look at him.You could do a hell of a lot worse.If Im going to have sex dreams with a man, Id like to have dinner first.Riley let out a bark of laughter.Hell, a girl can eat anytime.Are you a dream walker, Sasha?Dream walker?Some cultures use that term.Do you have prophetic dreams?Why hold back now?Riley said when Sasha hesitated.Youre already telling me you have sex with strange men, and you havent even had your drink yet.I dont have to be asleep to dream.Yes, Sasha thought, why hold back now?And yes, theyre usually prophetic.I knew my father would leave before he walked out the door when I was twelve.He couldnt handle what I am.I dont control it, cant demand to see, cant demand not to.Sasha picked up her glass and drank, and waited for the wariness or the derision.Have you ever worked with anyone on that?What?Have you ever worked with another dream walker, explored learning how to block it or open it?No.You look smarter than that.Riley shrugged.Is it just visions, or do you read minds?She might have asked if she painted in oil or acrylics.Emotion clogged Sashas throat so thickly she could barely speak.You believe me.Why wouldnt I?The proofs all over the table.Can you read minds, and can you control that?I dont read minds.I read feelings, and they speak just as loud.I can control it, unless the feelings are so intense they push through.What am I feeling?Go ahead.Riley spread her arms when Sasha hesitated.Im an open book, so read it.Sasha took a moment, focused in.You feel some sympathy for and curiosity about me.Youre relaxed, but on guard.You tend to stay on guard.You feel a need for something thats always been out of your reach.Its frustrating, especially because you like to win.You feel a little sexually deprived just now because you havent taken the time ...felt you had the time to fill that need.The work fulfills you, the risks, the adventure, the demands of it.Youve earned your self reliance, and youre not afraid of much.If theres fear, its more for the emotional than the physical.You have a secret, Sasha murmured.Closed up tight.Sasha jerked back, frowned.You asked me to look, all but insisted, so dont get angry when I do.Fair enough.And thats enough.I believe in privacy.Shed never read anyone that openly, that purposefully.It left her flushed, and mildly embarrassed.I dont dig into peoples secrets.I believe in privacy.Riley raised her glass again.But I freaking love to dig.Your work brings you a lot of pride and satisfaction.What is it?That depends.At the base?Im an archaeologist.I like looking for things no one else can find.And when you find it?What do you do with it?That depends, too.You find things.Sasha nodded, nearly relaxed.That must be one of the reasons.For what?For our being here.Ive got a reason to be here.But at this time, in this place?Sasha gestured to the sketches again.I know we need to look, we need to find ...If you want my attention you have to spit things out.Rather than speak, Sasha pulled out another sketch.A beach, a calm sea, a palace on a hill, all under a full white moon.And curved under the moon shone three stars.I dont know where this is, but I do know these three stars, the ones near the moon, they dont exist.Im not an astronomer, but I know theyre not there.I only know they were, somehow they were.And I know they fell.See this one.She laid out another sketch.All three falling at the same time, leaving those cometlike trails.Were supposed to find them.Sasha looked up, saw Rileys eyes stare into hers, feral and cold.What do you know about the stars?Riley demanded.Im telling you what I know.In a fast move, Riley reached out, gripped Sashas arm at the wrist.What do you know about the Stars of Fortune?Who the hell are you?Though her stomach trembled, Sasha made herself keep her eyes level with the fierce ones, ordered her voice not to shake.Ive told you who I am.Im telling you what I know.You know more about them.You know what they are.Youre already looking for themthats why youre here.And youre hurting my arm.If I find out youre bullshitting me, Ill hurt more than your arm.But she let it go.Dont threaten me.Temper, hot and surprised, leaped up and out.Ive had enough.I didnt ask for this, I dont want this.All I wanted was to live in peace, to paint, to be left alone to work.Then you and these others are crowding my dreams, you and these damn stars I dont understand.One of thems here, I know it, just as I know finding it wont be peaceful.I dont know how to fight, and Ill have to.Blood and battle, dreams full of blood and battle and pain.Now its getting interesting.Its terrifying, and I want to walk away from all of it.I dont think I can.I held one in my hand.Riley leaned forward.You held one of the stars?In a dream.Sasha turned her palm up, stared at it.I held it, held the fire.And it was so beautiful it blinded.Then it came.What came?The dark, the hungry, the brutal.Suddenly she felt queasy, light headed.Though she struggled, what moved through her won.She who is darkness covets.To have what she desires consumes her.What the three moons created out of love, loyalty, and hope, she would corrupt.She has burned her gifts and all bright edges of her power away, and what remains is a madness.She will kill to possess them, fire, ice, water.Possessing them, she will destroy worlds, destroy all so she lives.Sasha lifted both hands to her head.Headache.Does that happen often?I do everything I can to stop it.And thats probably why you have a headache.You cant fight your own nature, trust me.You have to learn to control it, and to adapt.Riley caught the waiters eyes, circled a finger in the air.Im getting us another round.I dont think I should  			Eat some nuts.Brisk now, Riley shoved the bowl closer.No way youre faking thisnobodys that good.And Ive got a sense about peoplenot empathic, but a reliable sense.So well have another drink, talk this through some more, then figure out where we go from there.Youre going to help me.The way I look at it, were going to help each other.My research indicates the Fire Star is in or around Corfuand your dreams corroborate that.You could come in handy.Now  			She broke off, flicked a hand at her bangs as she looked over Sashas head.Well, well, it just keeps getting more and more interesting.What is it?Dream date.Riley aimed a deliberately flirty smile, crooked a finger in the air.Swiveling in her chair, Sasha saw him.The man who held the lightning.The one whod taken her body.His eyes, so dark, flicked away from Riley, met hers.Held them.And holding them, crossed to their table.Ladies.Spectacular view, isnt it?His voice, Irish and easy, brought a shiver to Sashas skin.She felt trapped, as if a shining silver cage had dropped around her.And when he smiled, she yearned.Where you from, Irish?Riley asked.Sligo, a little village you wouldnt have heard of.Youd be surprised.Cloonacool.I know it.Sits at the foot of the Ox Mountains.So it does, yes.Well then.He waved his hand, and offered Riley the little clutch of shamrocks that appeared in it.A token from home, faraway.Nice.Americans?He looked back at Sasha.Both of you?Looks that way.Riley watched his gaze shift, land on the sketches.She said nothing when he reached down, lifted the one of six people.Not shocked, she thought.Intrigued.Isnt this a fascination.Youd be the artist?he said to Sasha.Youve a clever hand, and eye.Ive been told I have the same.He smiled.Mind if I join you?Without waiting for assent, he got a chair from a neighboring table, pulled it up.Sat.Id say weve a lot to talk about.Id be Bran.Bran Killian.Why dont I buy you ladies a drink, and well talk about the moon and the stars?TWO     			Sasha struggled to find her balance as he made himself comfortable, ordered a glass of the local red.Hed walked out of her dreams, as if shed wished him into being.She knew his face, his body, his voice, his scent.Shed been intimate with him.But he didnt know her.He didnt know her heart beat fast fists at the base of her throat, or that she had her hands clutched together under the table to keep them from shaking.She needed a moment alone to gather herself, thought to scoop up the sketches and get away, but he turned those dark eyes on her.Do you mind?he asked, and before she understood, without waiting for an answer, he picked up one of the sketches of Riley.Shes captured you very well.Seems like.Have you known each other long?About a half hour.His only reaction was a single quirked eyebrowthe one with the lightning bolt scar.Fascinating.He picked up, studied sketch after sketch, ordering them as he went.And the other three people?She doesnt know.You dont seem too weirded out about it.The worlds full of mysteries, isnt it?What are you doing in Corfu?Riley asked him.He sat back with his wine, smiled.Im on holiday.Come on, Bran.Riley gestured with her own drink.After all weve been through together.I felt this was the place I needed to be, he said simply, and picked up the sketch of the moon with its three bright stars.And apparently it is.You know what they are.Bran shifted his gaze to Sasha.She speaks.I know what they are, yes.Where is altogether another matter.I have one of your paintings.What?The one you called Silence.A forest in soft morning light, with a narrow path winding through trees green with summer, some coated with moss that shimmers in light quiet as a whisper.Beyond the path, that light glows, brighter, bolder, in a kind of beckoning.It would make the observer wonder what lies at the end of the path.He picked up another sketch, one of himself, feet planted, head back, with bold blue lightning flashing from the tips of his upstretched fingers.Its all very interesting, isnt it?I dont know what any of this means.I dont understand any of it.But you came nonetheless.From America?Yes.And youre from America, Riley.Originally.I move around a lot.And you came from Ireland.Originally.But to here, from New York.I have a place there.Doing what?Sasha demanded.If he noticed her sharp tone, he didnt show it.Magic, he said, and offered her a passionflower, richly purple.The hands quicker than the eye, he said easily, especially since the eyes so easily misdirected.Youre a magician.I am.Stage magicstreet magic when the mood strikes.A magician, Sasha considered.The lightning could symbolize his line of work.But it didnt explain all the rest.Nothing did.She looked down at the flower in her hand, then up at him.The sun was setting in the west behind him in an explosion of fiery red and hot licks of brilliant gold.Theres more, she said, but she thought: Youre more.There always is.Considering that, and this.He set the sketch of the stars on the top of the stack.I think the three of us need to have a discussion.Why dont we have that over a meal?I could eat.You buying, Irish?Riley asked him.For the privilege of sharing dinner with two beautiful women, I am, of course.What do you say to a bit of a walk, till we find a place that suits our needs?Im in.When Sasha said nothing, Bran took the flower from her, tucked it over her ear.Youre no coward, Sasha Riggs, or you wouldnt be here.She only nodded, put the sketches back in her portfolio, and rose.Ill tell you what I know, in exchange for what you know.Fair enough.* * *  			They walked the narrow, cobbled streets of Old Town with its colorful shops and stalls and pavement cafes.Dusk gave the air a quietly lavender hue, one Sasha stored away knowing shed have to paint it.Old, sunbaked buildings, madly blooming pots of flowers, a bold red cloth hanging on a line overhead among other linens, waiting to be brought in and put away.If she thought about perspective, tone, texture, she wouldnt have to think about what she was doing.Walking around in a strange place with people she didnt know.She marveled at how easily Riley and Bran exchanged small talk, envied their ability to be in the moment.They gave every appearance of enjoying a pretty evening in an ancient place with the scents of grilled lamb and spices in the air.What appeals?Bran asked.Indoors or out?Why waste a good clear night inside?Riley said.Agreed.He found a place, as if by magic, near the green of the park, where the tables sat under the trees and fairy lights.Happy music played somewhere nearbyclose enough to add some fun, far enough not to intrude.This local reds good.The Petrokoritho.Up for a bottle?Bran asked.I never say no to a drink.Taking Rileys answer as assent all around, Bran ordered a bottle.Sasha thought of the Bellinis as she looked at the menu.Shed take a couple sips of wine to be polite, and stick with water.And foodGod knew she needed some food in her system.She felt empty and quivery and out of place.Shed go with fish, she decided.They were on an island after all.She studied her choices while Riley and Bran talked starters, with Riley making suggestions.Reading Sashas questioning glance, Riley shrugged.First time on Corfu, but not my first time in Greece.And when it comes to food, my stomach has a endemic memory.Then Ill leave it to you.Bran turned to Sasha.Take a risk?I was leaning toward fish, she began.Got you covered.How about you?Riley asked Bran.Ive a mind for meat.Done.Once the wine was tasted and served, Riley rattled off several dishes in Greek.Sashas own stomach shuddered at the prospect of strange dishes.Have you traveled much?Bran asked her.No, not really.I spent a few days in Florence and in Paris a few years ago.Maybe not much, but you chose well.I thought youd been to Ireland.No, I havent.Why did you think that?The painting I bought.I know the place, or one very like it, not far from home.So, where is your forest?Shed dreamed it.She often dreamed her paintings.Its not real.I imagined it.The same way you imagined me, and Riley, and the others weve yet to meet?Lay it out, Sasha, Riley advised.The guys an Irish magician.Hes not going to bolt over a little strange.I dreamed it.She blurted it out like a confession.All of it.All of you.I dreamed of Corfuor I finally figured out it was Corfu, so I came.And I walked out onto the terrace of the hotel, and saw Riley.Then you.In dreams.He drank some wine, watched her with those dark, hooded eyes.Youre a seer.Are your visions only when you sleep?No.It struck her that he didnt reactnor had Rileyas others usually did.With skepticism, smirks, or with giddy questions about their own futures.They come when they want to.Bloody inconvenient.She let out a quick laugh.Yeah.Bloody inconvenient.Theyll come here, the other three.I know that now.Or maybe theyre already here.But theyll find us, or well find them.Once that happens, I dont know if theres any going back.To what?Bran wondered.To our lives, to the way they were before.If thats whats put the worry in your eyes, its always better going forward than back.She said nothing while the waiter served the starters.You both want to find these stars, and your reasons probably matter, but all I know is something wants us to find them or we wouldnt be here.But something else doesnt want us to have them.That something is dark and dangerous and powerful.It may not be a matter of going forward or back, but of not existing at all.Nobody lives forever.So saying, Riley dug into her eggplant starter.Bran brushed a hand over Sashas, lightly.No one can make you do what you dont want to do.Its your choice, fidh, to go forward or back.What does that meanwhat you called me?What you are.Vision seer, prophet.Seems to me a prophet should see things more clearly.Ill wager others with your gift have thought the same.If I go back, I dont think Ill ever find peace again.While that was true enough, she knew a deeper truth.She couldnt walk away from him.So it looks like forward.Ive never had dinner with two people who just accept what I am.Its good.She sampled the dish Riley had called tzatziki, found the smooth yogurt, the bite of garlic, the cool tang of cucumber went down easily after all.And sos this.The food settled her.Maybe it was the wine, or the fragrant night, or the fact that shed finally fully accepted her decision, but the raw edges of her nerves quieted.When Bran cut some of the meat, put it on her plate, she stared at it.You should try it, he told her.To be polite, she told herself, she didbut the act felt ridiculously intimate.To distract herself from the heat that had nothing to do with a bite of grilled lamb, she picked up her wine.How do you know about the three stars?she asked Bran.Theyre why youre here.Why were all here.How do you know about them?What do you know?Ill tell you a legend Ive heard of three stars created by three godsmoon goddesses, they were.Or are, depending on where youre standing.They made these stars as gifts for a new queen.Just a baby, say some legends, while others ...He glanced at Riley.Others say young girl.Kind of an Arthurian riffa true queen chosen at the end of anothers reign through a test of sorts.There you have it.These sister goddesses wanted a unique and lasting gift for the queen they knew would rule for the good, who would hold peace softly in her hand as she did.So each made a star, one of fire, one of ice, one of water, all brilliant and filled with strength and magic and hope, which can be the same.On a beachwhite sand, Sasha added.He continued to eat, but watched her carefully.Some say.Theres a palace, silver and shining, on a high hill, and the moons white and full, beaming over the water.Youve seen this?I dreamed it.Which can be the same, Bran repeated.They werent alone on the beach.They werent, no, not alone.Another like them, but as unlike as white to black, wanted what theyd made, and what the queen had, which was power over worlds.The three knew her for what she was, knew as they tossed the stars toward the moon, and the other struck out at them with her dark, they would need to protect what theyd created, and all that lived.The stars would fall, he continued, the other had seen to that, and she could wait.So the three used what they had to see that when the stars fell, they would fall away from one another, as their full power is only reached when together.They would fall in secret places, hidden and safe until the time came for them to be lifted out, brought together, and taken to the next new queen.Its a pretty story, but  			Not all of it, Riley interrupted.Give her the other side.If the other takes possession of the stars, all the doors on all the worlds will unlock.The dark, the damned, the destructive will spring free and devour all they can.Human worlds, and others as vulnerable, would not survive it.Worlds.Smiling, he topped off her wine.Do you ever wonder at the arrogance of men who think they alone exist in the universe?Most native cultures and elemental faiths know better, Riley commented.Youre a scientist.Im a digger, she told Sasha.And Ive dug up enough to know weve never been alone.Theres a little more to the legend.A bit, Bran allowed.Those who seek it risk deathnatchbut if they prevail, they save the worlds, which is pretty important.And each will find their own fortune.Both of you believe this.I believe it enough.Ive been looking for them, off and on, for about seven years.Twelve, Bran told her.On and off as well.Its been kind of a hobby for me, until now.Now?Riley polished off the last of her wine.I think its become my freaking mission.She set the glass down, leaned toward Sasha.Are we in thisthe three of us?Six.It has to be the six.I dont think well get far until it is.Okay, but that doesnt mean we cant start looking.Where?The mountains to the north, a lot of caves there.That might be a good place to start.How do we get there?Ive got a jeep.Thatll get us somewhere.Got hiking boots?Yes.I do a lot of hiking at home.How about you, Irish?Not to worry.Great.So well meet up in the morning, head out, what, about eight?Bran winced.A morning person, are you?Im what I need to be.Sasha walked back with them to the hotel in a half daze.Too much wine, too much travel, too much stimulation.Shed sleep, just sleep, and sort the rest out in the morning, she told herself.What floor?Bran asked when they stepped into the elevator.Third.So am I.   			And I make three on three, Riley said.Naturally.With a sigh, Sasha leaned against the wall, dug out her key.When they got out, turned in the same direction, Sasha all but felt Fates sticky fingers pinching the back of her neck.She stopped at her door.My room.Im across the hall from you, Bran said, smiling now.Of course you are.And right next door.Riley strolled down to the door beside Sashas.Where else would you be?she mumbled, and unlocked her door.Night, kids!Riley sang out.Good night.Thanks for dinner, she said to Bran, and closed the door.Bran walked into his own room, switched on the lights.The evening, he thought, had certainly been more entertaining than hed anticipated.Hed intended to wander out, maybe have a drink, take a solitary walk around to let himself absorb where hed been driven to go.Then the women.He could admit here, alone, that seeing himself in that sketch as one of six had given him a jolt.But such an interesting jolt.As interesting as realizing the artist happened to be the same Sasha Riggs whose work hung in his New York home.Shed claimed the scene had come from her imagination, and perhaps it had.But he knew that forest and knew it well.And he knew what waited at the end of the path in the shimmering light.He got a bottle of water, and the tablet he traveled with, plopped down on the bed.And began to research the two women Fate had apparently dropped at his feet.There were other ways to learn more about them, of course, but this seemed the most fair and aboveboard.He believed in being fair, at least initially.He had no doubt they hadnt shared everything with himthe adventurer and the seerbut he hadnt shared all with them.So that seemed fair as well.He took the adventurer first, because in truth he felt far too hard a pull toward the seer.Not simply Riley Gwin, he noted, but Doctor Riley Gwin, whod earned the title in archaeology and folklore and myths.Born thirty years agoand two doctorates by thirty meant she was no ones foolto Doctors Carter Gwin and Iris MacFee, archaeology and anthropology, respectively, shed spent a good portion of her childhood traveling.Shed written two books and an assortment of papers and articlespublish or perish, after all.But devoted most of her time, from what he could glean, on digs or traveling on her own in pursuit of lost treasures and myths.Searching for the stars certainly fit.He switched to Sasha.She was twenty eight, he noted, only child of Matthew and Georgina Riggs, ne Corrigandivorced.Shed studied art at Columbia.Articles on her were few and far between, which told him she shied away from the media.But she was represented by one of the top artist agencies in New York.According to her official bio, shed had her first major showing at the Windward Gallery, New York, at the tender age of twenty two, and lived quietly in the mountains of North Carolina.Unmarried, which was handy.There was, he thought, a great deal more to Sasha Riggs than that.So hed have to find out the great deal more, one way or the other.But not tonight, he decided.For tonight, hed let it all rest, and see what came.He set the tablet aside, stripped down.He might have preferred the night to the morning, but since he had morning to face, hed get a decent nights sleep.He left the curtains and windows open and, listening to the night, thinking of stars, of fortune, of women with secrets, began to drift off.The knock on the door brought him out of the half sleep and into mild annoyance.Rolling out of bed, he snatched up his jeans, tugged them on.It didnt surprise him overmuch to find Sasha at the door, but it did to see her in the hallway wearing a thin white sleep slip that barely hit the middle of her very pretty thighs.Well now, this is interesting.Shes at the window.Who would that be?Hed started to smile, but when his gaze finally managed to travel from those thighs up the white silk, beyond breasts and throat to meet her eyes, the smile faded off.Dream walking, he thought.The trance glazed her eyes like glass.Where are you, Sasha?With you.Shes at the window.She said if I let her in, shed give me my hearts desire.But shes made of lies.We should make her leave.Lets have a look.He took her hand, led her back across the hall, into her room.Shut the door behind him.She had it dark as a cave, he noted, curtains drawn tight across the windows.He added some light, and Sasha lifted a hand, gestured toward the curtains.There she is.I told her to go away, but there she is.Stay here.He walked to the window, yanked the curtains open.He saw a shadow passa bare flickerthought he heard a rustle, like the dry wings of a bat.Then there was nothing but the sea under a three quarter moon.There, shes gone.Sasha smiled at him.I knew shed leave if you were here.You worry her.Do I?he queried.I can feel some of what she feels.Not all.I dont want to feel all.Hugging herself, she rubbed her arms.She left it cold.Its fire she wants here, but she left the cold behind.Come, back to bed with you, where its warm.To settle it, he moved to her, picked her up, carried her over.You smell of the forest I painted.Well now, Ive spent considerable time there.He tucked the covers around her.Warmer now, are you?Shell come back.Not tonight.Are you sure?I am.You can sleep now.All right.And with a trust that baffled him, she closed her eyes.Studying her, Bran considered his options.He could go back to his room, assume shed come for him if she needed to.He could spend a very uncomfortable night on the floor.Or ...He stretched out beside her, watched night press against the window.She smelled of orange blossoms, he realized.And breathing her in, slept.THREE     			Warm, blissfully content, Sasha rose out of sleep slowly, like drifting up to the surface of a quiet pool to float.Wanting to cling to that sensation of feeling safe, happy, she kept her eyes closed, gave herself permission to snuggle in for just five minutes more.On a sigh, she glided her hand up the sheet.And froze.Not the sheet, but skin.Warm, firm skin.With a heart beating under her palm.Her eyes popped open.The first shock was seeing Bran, sleeping still, his face inches from hers.The next was realizing her head was nestled on his shoulder as if it belonged there.They were curled up together like contented lovers, his arm cradled under her, her hand resting on his heart.And it wasnt a dream.On a strangled gasp, she scrambled back, rolled, nearly tumbled off the bed before she gained her feet.He sat up with a jerk, all tousled hair, stubble shadowed cheeks, and hard, naked chest.What?he demanded, as those dark eyes cleared of sleep instantly.What?What?she tossed back, pointing at him.What?And jabbed her finger in the air.What!Christ.
