And allowed her obsession with my safety to run wild.She has to let it go.Ive let it go.You were an innocent, Eva.She feels guilty for not protecting you.We need to give her a little latitude.Latitude?Shes a stalker!My mind spun.How could my mom invade my privacy like that?Why would she?She was driving herself crazy, and me along with her.This has to stop.Its an easy fix.Ive already spoken with Clancy.Hell drive you when you need to venture into Brooklyn.Everythings been arranged.This will be much more convenient for you.Dont try to twist this around to being for my benefit.My eyes stung and my throat burned with unshed tears of frustration.I hated the way he talked about Brooklyn like it was a third world country.Im a grown woman.I make my own decisions.Its the goddamn law!Dont take that tone with me, Eva.Im simply looking after your mother.And you.I pushed back from the table.Youre enabling her.Youre keeping her sick, and youre making me sick, too.Sit down.You need to eat.Monica worries that youre not eating healthy enough.She worries about everything, Richard.Thats the problem.I dropped my napkin on the table.I have to get back to work.I turned away, striding toward the door to get out as quickly as possible.I retrieved my purse from Stantons secretary and left my cell phone on her desk.Clancy, who had been waiting for me in the reception area, followed me, and I knew better than to try and blow him off.He didnt take orders from anyone but Stanton.Clancy drove me back up to midtown, while I stewed in the backseat.I could bitch all I wanted, but in the end I wasnt any better than Stanton because I was going to give in.I was going to cave and let my mom have her way, because it hurt my heart to think of her suffering any more than she already did.She was so emotional and fragile, and she loved me to the point of being crazy about it.My mood was still dark when I got back to the Crossfire.As Clancy pulled away from the curb, I stood on the crowded sidewalk and looked up and down the busy street for either a drugstore where I could get some chocolate or a cellular store where I could pick up a new phone.I ended up walking around the block and buying a half dozen candy bars at a Duane Reade on the corner before heading back to the Crossfire.Id been gone just about an hour, but I wasnt going to use the extra time Mark had given me.I needed work to distract me from my crazy assed family.As I caught an empty elevator car, I ripped open a bar and bit viciously into it.I was making strides toward filling my self imposed chocolate quota before I hit the twentieth floor when the car stopped on the fourth.I appreciated the added time the stop gave me to enjoy the comfort of dark chocolate and caramel melting over my tongue.The doors slid apart, and revealed Gideon Cross talking with two other gentlemen.As usual, I lost my breath at the sight of him, which reignited my fading irritation.Why did he have that effect on me?When was I going to become immune to his hotness?He glanced over and his lips curved into a slow, heart stopping smile when he saw me.Great.Just my crappy luck.Id become some kind of challenge.Crosss smile faded into a frown.Well finish this later, he murmured to his companions without looking away from me.Stepping into the car, he lifted a hand to discourage them from following him.They blinked in surprise, glancing at me, then Cross, and then back again.I stepped out, deciding it would be safer for my sanity to take a different car up.Not so fast, Eva.Cross caught me by the elbow and tugged me back.The doors shut and the elevator glided smoothly into motion.What are you doing?I snapped.After dealing with Stanton, the last thing I needed was another domineering male trying to push me around.Cross caught me by the upper arms and searched my face with that vivid blue gaze.Somethings wrong.What is it?The now familiar electricity crackled to life between us, the pull made fiercer by my temper.You.Me?His thumbs stroked over my shoulders.Releasing me, he withdrew a lone key from his pocket and plugged it into the panel.All the lights cleared except for the one for the top floor.He wore black again, with fine gray pinstripes.Seeing him from the back was a revelation.His shoulders were nicely broad without being bulky, emphasizing his lean waist and long legs.The silky strands of hair falling over his collar tempted me to clench them and pull.Hard.I wanted him as pissy as I was.I wanted a fight.Im not in the mood for you now, Mr.Cross.He watched the antique style needle above the doors mark the passing floors.I can get you in the mood.Im not interested.Cross glanced over his shoulder at me.His shirt and tie were both the same awesome cerulean as his irises.The effect was striking.No lies, Eva.Ever.Thats not a lie.So what if Im attracted to you?I expect most women are.Wrapping up what was left of my candy bar, I shoved it back into the shopping bag Id tucked into my purse.I didnt need chocolate when I was sharing air with Gideon Cross.But Im not interested in doing anything about it.He faced me then, turning in a leisurely pivot, that ghost of a smile softening his sinful mouth.His ease and unconcern aggravated me further.Attraction is too tame a word for he gestured at the space between us this.Call me crazy, but I have to actually like someone before I get naked and sweaty with them.Not crazy, he said.But I dont have the time or the inclination to date.That makes two of us.Glad we got that cleared up.He stepped closer, his hand lifting to my face.I forced myself not to move away or give him the satisfaction of seeing me intimidated.His thumb brushed over the corner of my mouth; then lifted to his own.He sucked on the pad and purred, Chocolate and you.Delicious.A shiver moved through me, followed by a heated ache between my legs as I imagined licking chocolate off his lethally sexy body.His gaze darkened and his voice lowered intimately.Romance isnt in my repertoire, Eva.But a thousand ways to make you come are.Let me show you.The car slowed to a halt.He withdrew the key from the panel and the doors opened.I backed into the corner and shooed him out with a flick of my wrist.Im really not interested.Well discuss.Cross caught me by the elbow and gently, but insistently, urged me out.I went along because I liked the charge I got from being around him and because I was curious to see what he had to say when afforded more than five minutes of my time.He was buzzed through the security door so quickly there was no need for him to break stride.The pretty redhead at the reception desk pushed hastily to her feet, about to impart some information until he shook his head impatiently.Her mouth snapped shut and she stared at me as we passed at a brisk pace, her eyes wide.The walk to Crosss office was mercifully short.His secretary stood when he saw his bosss approach, but remained silent when he noted that Cross wasnt alone.Hold my calls, Scott, Cross said, steering me into his office through the open glass double doors.Despite my irritation, I couldnt help but be impressed with Gideon Crosss spacious command center.Floor to ceiling windows overlooked the city on two sides, while a wall of glass faced the rest of the office space.The one opaque wall opposite the massive desk was covered in flat screens streaming news channels from around the world.There were three distinct seating areas, each one larger than Marks entire office, and a bar that showcased jeweled crystal decanters, which provided the only spots of color in a palette that was otherwise black, gray, and white.Cross hit a button on his desk that closed the doors; then another that instantly frosted the clear glass wall, effectively shielding us from the view of his employees.With the beautiful sapphire hued reflective film on the exterior windows, privacy was assured.He shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on a chrome coatrack.Then he returned to where Id remained standing just inside the doors.Something to drink, Eva?No, thank you.Damn it.He was even yummier in just the vest.I could better see how fit he was.How strong his shoulders were.How beautifully his biceps and ass flexed as he moved.He gestured toward a black leather sofa.Have a seat.I have to go back to work.And I have a meeting at two.The sooner we work this out, the sooner we can both get back to business.Now, sit down.What do you think were going to work out?Sighing, he scooped me up like a bride and carried me over to the sofa.He dropped me on my butt; then sat next to me.Your objections.Its time to discuss what its going to take to get you beneath me.A miracle.I pushed back from him, widening the space between us.I tugged at the hem of my emerald green skirt, wishing Id worn pants instead.I find your approach crude and offensive.And a major turn on, but I was never going to admit it.He contemplated me with narrowed eyes.It may be blunt, but its honest.You dont strike me as the kind of woman who wants bullshit and flattery instead of the truth.What I want is to be seen as having more to offer than an inflatable sex doll.Crosss brows shot up.Well, then.Are we done?I stood.Wrapping my wrist with his fingers, he pulled me back down.Hardly.Weve established some talking points: We have an intense sexual attraction and neither of us wants to date.So what do you want exactly?Seduction, Eva?Do you want to be seduced?I was equally fascinated and appalled by the conversation.And, yes, tempted.It was hard not to be while faced with such a gorgeous, virile male so determined to get hot and sweaty with me.Still, the dismay won out.Sex thats planned like a business transaction is a turnoff for me.Establishing parameters in the beginning makes it less likely that therell be exaggerated expectations and disappointment at the conclusion.Are you kidding?I scowled.Listen to yourself.Why even call it a fuck?Why not be clear and call it a seminal emission in a preapproved orifice?He pissed me off by throwing his head back and laughing.The full, throaty sound flowed over me like a rush of warm water.My awareness of him heightened to a physically painful degree.His earthy amusement made him less sex god and more human.Flesh and blood.Real.I pushed to my feet and backed out of reach.Casual sex doesnt have to include wine and roses, but for Gods sake, whatever else it is, sex should be personal.Friendly even.With mutual respect at the very least.His humor fled as he stood, his eyes darkening.There are no mixed signals in my private affairs.You want me to blur that line.I cant think of a good reason to.I dont want you to do jack shit, besides let me get back to work.I strode to the door and yanked on the handle, cursing softly when it didnt budge.Let me out, Cross.I felt him come up behind me.His palms pressed flat to the glass on either side of my shoulders, caging me in.I couldnt think of my own self preservation when he was so close.The strength and demand of his will exuded an almost tangible force field.When he stepped close enough, it surrounded me, closing me in with him.Everything outside of that bubble ceased to exist, while inside it my entire body strained toward his.That he had such a profound, visceral effect on me while being so damn irritating had my mind spinning.How could I be so turned on by a man whose words shouldve turned me completely off?Turn around, Eva.My eyes closed against the surge of arousal I felt at his authoritative tone.God, he smelled good.His powerful frame radiated heat and hunger, spurring my own wild desire for him.The uncontrollable response was intensified by my lingering frustration with Stanton and my more recent aggravation with Cross himself.I wanted him.Bad.But he was no good for me.Honestly, I could screw up my life on my own.I didnt need any help.My flushed forehead touched the air conditioned glass.Let it go, Cross.I am.Youre too much trouble.His lips brushed behind my ear.One of his hands pressed flat to my stomach, the fingers splaying to urge me back against him.He was as aroused as I was, his cock hard and thick against my lower back.Turn around and say good bye.Disappointed and regretful, I turned in his grip, sagging against the door to cool my heated back.He was curved over me, his luxurious hair framing his beautiful face, his forearm propped against the door to bring him closer.I had almost no room to breathe.The hand hed had at my waist was now resting on the curve of my hip, tightening reflexively and driving me mad.He stared, his gaze searingly intense.Kiss me, he said hoarsely.Give me that much.Panting softly, I licked my dry lips.He groaned, tilted his head, and sealed his mouth over mine.I was shocked by how soft his firm lips were and the gentleness of the pressure he exerted.I sighed and his tongue dipped inside, tasting me in long leisurely licks.His kiss was confident, skilled, and just the right side of aggressive to turn me on wildly.I distantly registered my purse hitting the floor; then my hands were in his hair.I pulled on the silky strands, using them to direct his mouth over mine.He growled, deepening the kiss, stroking my tongue with lush slides of his own.I felt the raging beat of his heart against my chest, proof that he wasnt just a hopeless ideal conjured by my fevered imagination.He pushed away from the door.Cupping the back of my head and the curve of my buttocks, he lifted me off my feet.I want you, Eva.Trouble or not, I cant stop.I was pressed full body against him, achingly aware of every hot, hard inch of him.I kissed him back as if I could eat him alive.My skin was damp and too sensitive, my breasts heavy and tender.My clit throbbed for attention, pounding along with my raging heartbeat.I was vaguely aware of movement, and then the couch was against my back.Cross was levered over me with one knee on the cushion and the other foot on the floor.His left arm supported his torso while his right hand gripped the back of my knee, sliding upward along my thigh in a firmly possessive glide.His breath hissed out when he reached the point where my garter clipped to the top of my silk stocking.He tore his gaze away from mine and looked down, pushing my skirt higher to bare me from the waist down.Jesus, Eva.A low rumble vibrated in his chest, the primitive sound sending goose bumps racing across my skin.Your boss is damned lucky hes gay.In a daze, I watched Crosss body lower to mine, my legs sliding apart to accommodate the width of his hips.My muscles strained with the urge to lift toward him, to hasten the contact between us that Id been craving since I first laid eyes on him.Lowering his head, he took my mouth again, bruising my lips with a fine edge of violence.Abruptly, he yanked himself away, stumbling to his feet.I lay there gasping and wet, so willing and ready.Then I realized why hed reacted so fiercely.Someone was behind him.4  Mortified by the sudden intrusion into our privacy, I scrambled up and back into the armrest, yanking down my skirt.two oclock appointment is here.It took an endless moment to realize Cross and I were still alone in the room, that the voice Id heard had come through a speaker.Cross stood at the far end of the sofa, flushed and scowling, his chest heaving.His tie was loosened and the fly of his slacks strained against a very impressive erection.I had a nightmare vision in my head of what I must look like.And I was late getting back to work.Christ.He shoved both hands through his hair.Its the middle of the fucking day.In my goddamn fucking office!I got to my feet and tried to straighten my appearance.Here.He came to me, yanking my skirt up again.Furious at what Id almost let happen when I should be at work, I smacked at his hands.Stop it.Leave me alone.Shut up, Eva, he said grimly, catching the hem of my black silk blouse and tugging it into place, adjusting it so that the buttons once again formed a straight row between my breasts.Then he pulled down my skirt, smoothing it with calm, expert hands.Fix your ponytail.Cross retrieved his coat, shrugging into it before adjusting his tie.We reached the door at the same time and when I crouched to fetch my purse, he lowered with me.He caught my chin, forcing me to look at him.Hey, he said softly.You okay?My throat burned.I was aroused and mad and thoroughly embarrassed.Id never in my life lost my mind like that.And I hated that Id done so with him, a man whose approach to sexual intimacy was so clinical it depressed me just thinking about it.I jerked my chin away.Do I look okay?You look beautiful and fuckable.I want you so badly it hurts.Im dangerously close to taking you back to the couch and making you come til you beg me to stop.Cant accuse you of being silver tongued, I muttered, aware that I wasnt offended.In fact, the rawness of his hunger for me was a serious aphrodisiac.Clutching the strap of my purse, I stood on shaky legs.I needed to get away from him.And, when my workday was done, I needed to be alone with a big glass of wine.Cross stood with me.Ill be done by five.Ill come get you then.No, you wont.This doesnt change anything.The hell it doesnt.Dont be arrogant, Cross.I lost my head for a second, but I still dont want what you want.His fingers curled around the door handle.Yes, you do.You just dont want it the way I want to give it to you.So, well revisit and revise.More business.Cut and dried.My spine stiffened.I set my hand over his and yanked on the handle, ducking under his arm to squeeze out the door.His secretary shoved quickly to his feet, gaping, as did the woman and two men who were waiting for Cross.I heard him speak behind me.Scott will show you into my office.Ill be just a moment.He caught me by reception, his arm crossing my lower back to grip my hip.Not wanting to make a scene, I waited until we were by the elevators to pull away.He stood calmly and hit the call button.Five oclock, Eva.I stared at the lighted button.Im busy.Tomorrow, then.Im busy all weekend.Stepping in front of me, he asked tightly, With whom?Thats none of your   His hand covered my mouth.Dont.Tell me when, then.And before you say never, take a good look at me and tell me if you see a man whos easily deterred.His face was hard, his gaze narrowed and determined.I shivered.I wasnt sure Id win a battle of wills with Gideon Cross.Swallowing, I waited until he lowered his hand and said, I think we both need to cool off.Take a couple days to think.He persisted.Monday after work.The elevator arrived and I stepped into it.Facing him, I countered, Monday lunch.Wed have only an hour, a guaranteed escape.Just before the doors closed, he said, Were going to happen, Eva.It sounded as much like a threat as a promise.Dont sweat it, Eva, Mark said, when I arrived at my desk nearly a quarter after two.You didnt miss anything.I had a late lunch with Mr.Leaman.I just barely got back myself.Thank you.No matter what he said, I still felt terrible.My kick ass Friday morning seemed to have happened days ago.We worked steadily until five, discussing a fast food client and contemplating some possible tweaks to ad copy for a chain of organic grocery stores.Talk about strange bedfellows, Mark had teased, not knowing how apt that was in regard to my personal life.Id just shut down my computer and was pulling my purse out of the drawer when my phone rang.I glanced at the clock, saw it was exactly five, and considered ignoring the call because I was technically done for the day.But since I was still feeling shitty about my overly long lunch, I considered it penance and answered.Mark Garritys   Eva honey.Richard says you forgot your cell phone at his office.I exhaled in a rush and sagged back into my chair.I could picture the handkerchief wringing that usually accompanied that particular anxious tone of my mothers.It drove me nuts and it also broke my heart.Hi, Mom.How are you?Oh, Im lovely.Thank you.My mom had a voice that was both girlish and breathy, like Marilyn Monroe crossed with Scarlett Johansson.Clancy dropped your phone off with the concierge at your place.You really shouldnt go anywhere without it.You never know when you might need to call for someone   Id been debating the logistics of just keeping the phone and forwarding calls to a new number I didnt share with my mom, but that wasnt my biggest concern.What does Dr.Petersen say about you tracing my phone?The silence on the other end of the line was telling.Dr.Petersen knows I worry about you.Pinching the bridge of my nose, I said, I think its time for us to have another joint appointment, Mom.Ohof course.He did mention that hed like to see you again.Probably because he suspects youre not being forthcoming.I changed the subject.I really like my new job.Thats wonderful, Eva!Is your boss treating you well?Yes, hes great.I couldnt ask for anyone better.Is he handsome?I smiled.Yes, very.And hes taken.Damn it.The good ones always are.She laughed and my smile widened.I loved it when she was happy.I wished she were happy more often.I cant wait to see you tomorrow at the advocacy dinner.Monica Tramell Barker Mitchell Stanton was in her element at society functions, a gilded shining beauty whod never lacked male attention in her life.Lets make a day of it, my mom said breathlessly.You, me, and Cary.Well go to the spa, get pretty and polished.Im sure you could use a massage after working so hard.I wont turn one down, thats for sure.And I know Cary will love it.Oh, Im excited!Ill send a car by your place around eleven?Well be ready.After I hung up, I leaned back in my chair and exhaled, needing a hot bath and an orgasm.If Gideon Cross somehow found out I masturbated while thinking about him, I didnt care.Being sexually frustrated was weakening my position, a weakness I knew he wouldnt be sharing.No doubt hed have a preapproved orifice lined up before days end.As I swapped out my heels for my walking shoes, my phone rang again.My mother was rarely distracted for long.The five minutes since wed ended our call was just about the right length of time for her to realize the cell phone issue hadnt been resolved.Once again, I debated ignoring the phone, but I didnt want to take any of the days crap home with me.I answered with my usual greeting, but it lacked its usual punch.Im still thinking about you.The velvet rasp of Crosss voice flooded me with such relief I realized Id been hoping to hear it again.Today.God.The craving was so acute I knew hed become a drug to my body, the prime source of some very intense highs.I can still feel you, Eva.Still taste you.Ive been hard since you left, through two meetings and one teleconference.Youve got the advantage, state your demands.Ah, I murmured.Lemme think.I let him wait, smiling as I remembered Carys comment about blue balls.HmmNothing is coming to mind.But I do have some friendly advice.Go spend time with a woman who salivates at your feet and makes you feel like a god.Fuck her until neither of you can walk.When you see me on Monday youll be totally over it and your life will return to its usual obsessive compulsive order.The creak of leather sounded over the phone and I imagined him leaning back in his desk chair.That was your one free pass, Eva.The next time you insult my intelligence, Ill take you over my knee.I dont like that sort of thing.And yet the warning, given in that voice, aroused me.Dark and Dangerous for sure.Well discuss.In the interim, tell me what you do like.I stood.You definitely have the voice for phone sex, but Ive got to go.I have a date with my vibrator.I shouldve hung up then, to gain the full effect of the brush off, but I couldnt resist learning if hed gloat like I had imagined he would.Plus, I was having fun with him.Oh, Eva.Cross spoke my name in a decadent purr.Youre determined to drive me to my knees, arent you?What will it take to talk you into a threesome with B. O. B. ?I ignored both questions as I slung my bag and purse over my shoulder, grateful he couldnt see how my hand shook.I was not discussing Battery Operated Boyfriends with Gideon Cross.Id never discussed masturbation openly with a man, let alone a man who was for all intents and purposes a stranger to me.B. O. B.  and I have a longtime understanding when were done with each other, we know exactly which one of us has been used, and it isnt me.Good night, Gideon.I hung up and took the stairs, deciding the twenty floor descent would serve double duty as both an avoidance technique and a replacement for a visit to the gym.I was so grateful to be home after the day Id had that I practically danced through my apartments front door.My heartfelt God, its good to be home!and accompanying spin was vehement enough to startle the couple on the couch.Oh, I said, wincing at my own silliness.Cary wasnt in a compromising position with his guest when I barged in, but theyd been sitting close enough to suggest intimacy.Grudgingly, I thought of Gideon Cross, who preferred to strip all intimacy out of the most intimate act I could imagine.Id had one night stands and friends with benefits, and no one knew better than I that sex and making love were two very different things, but I didnt think Id ever be able to view sex like a handshake.I thought it was sad that Cross did, even though he wasnt a man who inspired pity or sympathy.Hey, baby girl, Cary called out, pushing to his feet.I was hoping youd make it back before Trey had to leave.I have class in an hour, Trey explained, rounding the coffee table as I dropped my bag on the floor and put my purse on a barstool at the breakfast bar.But Im glad I got to meet you before I left.Me, too.I shook the hand he extended to me, taking him in with a quick glance.He was about my age, I guessed.Average height and nicely muscular.He had unruly blond hair, soft hazel eyes, and a nose that had clearly been broken at some point.Mind if I grab a glass of wine?I asked.Its been a long day.Go for it, Trey replied.Ill take one, too.Cary joined us by the breakfast bar.He was wearing loose fitting black jeans and an off the shoulder black sweater.The look was casual and elegant, and did a phenomenal job of offsetting his dark brown hair and emerald eyes.I went to the wine fridge and pulled out a random bottle.Trey shoved his hands in the pockets of his jeans and rocked back on his heels, talking quietly with Cary as I uncorked and poured.The phone rang and I grabbed the handset off the wall.Hello?Hey, Eva?Its Parker Smith.Parker, hi.I leaned my hip into the counter.How are you?I hope you dont mind my calling.Your stepdad gave me your number.Gah.Id had enough of Stanton for one day.Not at all.Whats up?Honestly?Everythings looking up right now.Your stepdad is like my fairy godfather.Hes funding a few safety improvements to the studio and some much needed upgrades.Thats why Im calling.The studios going to be out of commission for the rest of the week.Classes will resume next Monday.I closed my eyes, struggling to tamp down a flare of exasperation.It wasnt Parkers fault that Stanton and my mom were overprotective control freaks.Clearly they didnt see the irony of defending me while I was surrounded by people trained to do that very thing.Sounds good.I cant wait.Im really excited to be training with you.Im excited, too.Im going to work you hard, Eva.Your parents are going to get their moneys worth.I set a filled glass in front of Cary and took a big gulp out of my own.It never ceased to amaze me how much cooperation money could buy.But again, that wasnt Parkers fault.No complaints here.Well get started first thing next week.Your driver has the schedule.Great.See you then.I hung up and caught the glance Trey shot Cary when he thought neither of us was looking.It was soft and filled with a sweet yearning, and it reminded me that my problems could wait.Im sorry I caught you on the way out, Trey.Do you have time for pizza Wednesday night?Id love to do more than say hi and bye.I have class.He gave me a regretful smile and shot another side glance at Cary.But I could come by on Tuesday.Thatd be great.I smiled.We could order in and have a movie night.Id like that.I was rewarded with the kiss Cary blew me as he headed to the door to show Trey out.When he returned to the kitchen he grabbed his wine and said, All right.Spill it, Eva.You looked stressed.I am, I agreed, grabbing the bottle and moving into the living room.Its Gideon Cross, isnt it?Oh, yeah.But I dont want to talk about him.Although Gideons pursuit was exhilarating, his goal sucked.Lets talk about you and Trey instead.How did you two meet?I ran across him on a job.Hes working part time as a photographers assistant.Sexy, isnt he?His eyes were bright and happy.And a real gentleman.In an old school way.Who knew there were any of those left?I muttered before polishing off my first glass.Whats that supposed to mean?Nothing.Im sorry, Cary.He seemed great, and he obviously digs you.Is he studying photography?Veterinary medicine.Wow.Thats awesome.I think so, too.But forget about Trey for a minute.Talk about whats bugging you.Get it out.I sighed.My mom.She found out about my interest in Parkers studio and now shes freaking out.What?Howd she find out?I swear I havent told anyone.I know you didnt.Never even crossed my mind.Grabbing the bottle off the table, I refilled my glass.Get this.Shes been tracking my cell phone.Carys brows rose.Seriously?Thatscreepy.I know, right?Thats what I told Stanton, but he doesnt want to hear it.Well, hell.He ran a hand through his long bangs.So what do you do?Get a new phone.And meet with Dr.Petersen to see if he cant talk some sense into her.Good move.Turn it over to her shrink.Sois everything okay with your job?Do you still love it?Totally.My head fell back into the sofa cushions and my eyes closed.My work and you are my lifesavers right now.What about the young hottie bazillionaire who wants to nail you?Come on, Eva.You know Im dying here.What happened?I told him, of course.I wanted his take on it all.But when I finished, he was quiet.I lifted my head to look at him, and found him bright eyed and biting his lip.Cary?What are you thinking?Im feeling kind of hot from that story.He laughed and the warm, richly masculine sound swept a lot of my irritation away.Hes got to be so confused right now.I wouldve paid money to see his face when you hit him with that bit he wanted to spank you over.I cant believe he said that.Just remembering Crosss voice when he made that threat had my palms damp enough to leave steam on my glass.What the hell is he into?Spankings not deviant.Besides, he was going for missionary on the couch, so hes not averse to the basics.He fell into the couch, a brilliant smile lighting up his handsome face.Youre a huge challenge to a guy who obviously thrives on them.And hes willing to make concessions to have you, which Id bet hes not used to.Just tell him what you want.I split the last of the wine between us, feeling marginally better with a bit of alcohol in my veins.What did I want?Aside from the obvious?Were totally incompatible.Is that what you call what happened on his couch?Cary, come on.Boil it down.He picked me up off the lobby floor, and then asked me to fuck.Thats really it.Even a guy I take home from a bar has more going for him than that.Hey, whats your name?Come here often?Whos your friend?What are you drinking?Like to dance?Do you work around here?All right, all right.I get it.He set his glass down on the table.Lets go out.Hit a bar.Dance til we drop.Maybe meet some guys wholl talk you up some.Or at least buy me a drink.Hey, Cross offered you one of those in his office.I shook my head and stood.Whatever.Let me take a shower and well go.I threw myself into clubbing like it was going out of style.Cary and I bounced all over downtown clubs from Tribeca to the East Village, wasting stupid money on cover charges and having a fabulous time.I danced until my feet felt like they were going to fall off, but I toughed it out until Cary complained about his heeled boots first.Wed just stumbled out of a techno pop club with a plan to buy me flip flops at a nearby Walgreens when we ran across a hawker promoting a lounge a few blocks away.Great place to get off your feet for a while, he said, without the usual flashy smile or exaggerated hype most of the hawkers employed.His clothes black jeans and turtleneck were more upscale, which intrigued me.And he didnt have fliers or postcards.What he handed me was a business card made from papyrus paper and printed with a gilded font that caught the light of the electric signage around us.I made a mental note to hang on to it as a great piece of print advertising.A stream of quickly moving pedestrians flowed around us.Cary squinted down at the lettering, having a few more drinks in him than I had.Looks swank.Show them that card, the hawker urged.Youll skip the cover.Sweet.Cary linked arms with me and dragged me along.Lets go.You might find a quality guy in a swanky joint.My feet were seriously killing me by the time we found the place, but I quit bitching when I saw the charming entrance.The line to get in was long, extending down the street and around the corner.Amy Winehouses soulful voice drifted out of the open door, as did well dressed customers who exited with big smiles.True to the hawkers word, the business card was a magic key that granted us immediate and free entrance.A gorgeous hostess led us upstairs to a quieter VIP bar that overlooked the stage and dance floor below.We were shown to a small seating area by the balcony and settled at a table hugged by two half moon velvet sofas.She propped a beverage menu in the center and said, Your drinks are on the house.Enjoy your evening.Wow.Cary whistled.We scored.I think that hawker recognized you from an ad.Wouldnt that rock?He grinned.God, its a great night.Hanging out with my best girl and crushing on a new hunk in my life.Oh?I think Ive decided to see where things go with Trey.That made me happy.It felt like Id been waiting forever for him to find someone whod treat him right.Has he asked you out yet?No, but I dont think its because he doesnt want to.He shrugged and smoothed his artfully ripped T shirt.Paired with black leather pants and spiked wristlets, he looked sexy and wild.I just think hes trying to figure out the situation with you first.He wigged when I told him I lived with a woman and that Id moved across the country to be with you.Hes worried I might be bi curious and secretly hung up on you.Thats why I wanted you two to meet today, so he could see how you and I are together.Im sorry, Cary.Ill try to put him at ease about it.Its not your fault.Dont worry about it.Itll work out if its supposed to.His assurances didnt make me feel better.I tried to think if there was a way I could help.Two guys stopped by our table.Okay if we join you?the taller one asked.I glanced at Cary, and then back at the guys.They looked like brothers and they were very attractive.Both were smiling and confident, their stances loose and easy.I was about to say, Sure, when a warm hand settled on my bare shoulder and squeezed firmly.This ones taken.Across from me, Cary gaped as Gideon Cross rounded the sofa and extended his hand to him.Taylor.Gideon Cross.Cary Taylor.He shook Gideons hand with a wide smile.But you knew that.Nice to meet you.Ive heard a lot about you.I couldve killed him.I seriously thought about it.Good to know.Gideon settled on the seat beside me, his arm draped behind me so that his fingertips could brush casually and possessively up and down my arm.Maybe theres hope for me yet.Twisting at the waist, I faced him and whispered fiercely, What are you doing?He shot me a hard glance.Whatever it takes.Im going to dance.Cary stood with a mischievous grin.Be back in a bit.Ignoring my pleading glance, my best friend blew me a kiss and the guys followed him.I watched them all go, my heart racing.After another minute, ignoring Gideon became ridiculous, as well as impossible.My gaze slid over him.He wore dress slacks in graphite gray and a black V neck sweater, the overall effect being one of careless sophistication.I loved the look on him and was attracted to the softness it gave him, even though I knew it was only an illusion.He was a hard man in a lot of ways.I took a deep breath, feeling like I needed to make an effort to socialize with him.After all, wasnt that my big complaint?That he wanted to skip past the getting to know you stage and jump straight into bed?You look I paused.Fantastic.Wonderful.Amazing.So damn sexyIn the end, I went with the lame, I like the way you look.His brow arched.Ah, something you like about me.Is that a general like of the overall package?Or just the clothes?Only the sweater?Or maybe its the pants?The edge to his tone rubbed me the wrong way.And if I say its just the sweater?Ill buy a dozen and wear them every damn day.That would be a shame.You dont like the sweater?He was pissy, his words coming clipped and fast.My hands flexed restlessly in my lap.I love the sweater, but I also like the suits.He stared at me a minute, and then nodded.How was your date with B. O. B. ?Oh hell.I looked away.It was a lot easier talking about masturbation over the phone.Doing it while squirming under that piercing blue stare was mortifying.I dont kiss and tell.He brushed the backs of his fingers over my cheek and murmured, Youre blushing.I heard the amusement in his voice and swiftly changed topics.Do you come here often?Shit.Where did that clichd line come from?His hand dropped to my lap and caught one of mine, his fingers curling into my palm.When necessary.A quick stab of jealousy made me stiffen.I glared at him, even though I was mad at myself for caring either way.What does that mean?When youre on the prowl?Gideons mouth curved into a genuine smile that hit me hard.When expensive decisions need to be made.I own this club, Eva.Of course he did.Jeez.A pretty waitress set two pinkish colored iced drinks in square tumblers on the table.She looked at Gideon and gave him a flirtatious smile.Here you go, Mr.Cross.Two Stoli Elites and cranberry.Can I get you anything else?Thatll be all for now.Thanks.I could totally see that she wanted to get on the preapproved list and I bristled at that; then I was distracted by what wed been served.It was my beverage of choice when clubbing and what Id been drinking all night.My nerves tingled.I watched him take a drink, swirl it around in his mouth like a fine wine, and then swallow it.The working of his throat made me hot, but that was nothing compared to what the intensity of his stare did to me.Not bad, he murmured.Tell me if we made it right.He kissed me.He moved in fast, but I saw it coming and didnt turn away.His mouth was cold and flavored with alcohol laced cranberry.Delicious.All the chaotic emotion and energy that had been writhing around inside me abruptly became too much to contain.I shoved a hand in his glorious hair and clenched it tight, holding him still as I sucked on his tongue.His groan was the most erotic sound Id ever heard, making the flesh between my legs tighten viciously.Shocked by the fury of my reaction, I wrenched away, gasping.Gideon followed, nuzzling the side of my face, his lips brushing over my ear.He was breathing hard, too, and the sound of the ice in his tumbler clinking against the glass skittered across my inflamed senses.I need to be inside you, Eva, he whispered roughly.Im aching for you.My gaze fell to my drink on the table, my thoughts swirling around in my head, a clusterfuck of impressions and recollections and confusion.How did you know?His tongue traced the shell of my ear and I shivered.It felt like every cell in my body was straining toward his.Resisting him took an impossible amount of energy, draining me and making me feel tired.Know what?he asked.What I like to drink?What Carys name is?He inhaled deeply, and then pulled away.Setting his drink down, he shifted on the sofa and drew a knee up onto the cushion between us so that he faced me directly.His arm once again draped over the sofa back, his fingertips drawing circles on the curve of my shoulder.You visited another of my clubs earlier.Your credit card popped and your drinks were recorded.And Cary Taylor is listed on the rental agreement for your apartment.The room spun.No wayMy cell phone.My credit card.My fucking apartment.I couldnt breathe.Between my mother and Gideon, I felt claustrophobic.Eva.Jesus.Youre white as a ghost.He shoved a glass into my hand.Drink.It was the Stoli and cranberry.I pounded it, draining the tumbler.My stomach churned for a moment, then settled.You own the building I live in?I gasped.Oddly enough, yes.He moved to sit on the table, facing me, his legs on either side of mine.He took my glass and set it aside; then warmed my chilled hands with his.Are you crazy, Gideon?His mouth thinned.Is that a serious question?Yes.Yes, it is.My mom stalks me, too, and she sees a shrink.Do you have a shrink?Not presently, but youre driving me crazy enough to make that a possibility.So this behavior isnt normal for you?My heart was pounding.I could hear the blood rushing past my eardrums.Or is it?He shoved a hand through his hair, restoring order to the strands Id mussed when wed kissed.I accessed information you voluntarily made available to me.Not to you!Not for what you used it for!That has to violate some kind of privacy law.I stared at him, more confused than ever.Why would you do that?He had the grace to look disgruntled at least.So I can figure you out, damn it.Why dont you just ask me, Gideon?Is that so fucking hard for people to do nowadays?It is with you.He grabbed his drink off the table and tossed back most of it.I cant get you alone for more than a few minutes at a time.Because the only thing you want to talk about is what you have to do to get laid!Christ, Eva, he hissed, squeezing my hand.Keep your voice down!I studied him, taking in every line and plane of his face.Unfortunately, cataloging the details didnt lessen my awe even a tiny bit.I was beginning to suspect Id never get over being dazzled by his looks.And I wasnt alone; Id seen how other women reacted around him.And he was crazy rich, which made even old, bald, and paunchy guys attractive.It was no wonder he was used to snapping his fingers and scoring an orgasm.His gaze darted over my face.Why are you looking at me like that?Im thinking.About what?His jaw tightened.And Im warning you, if you say anything about orifices, preapprovals, or seminal emissions, I wont be held accountable for my actions.That almost made me smile.I want to understand a few things, because I think its possible Im not giving you enough credit.Id like to understand a few things myself, he muttered.Im guessing the I want to fuck you approach has a high success rate for you.Gideons face smoothed into unreadable impassivity.Im not touching that one, Eva.Okay.You want to figure out what its going to take to get me into bed.Is that why youre here in this club right now?Because of me?And dont say what you think I want to hear.His gaze was clear and steady.Im here for you, yes.I arranged it.Suddenly the threads the street hawker had been wearing made sense.Wed been hustled by someone on Cross Industriess payroll.Did you figure that getting me here would get you laid?His mouth twitched with suppressed amusement.Theres always the hope, but I expected it would take more work than a chance meeting over drinks.Youre right.So why do it?Why not wait until Monday lunch?Because youre out trolling.I cant do anything about B. O. B. , but I can stop you from picking up some asshole in a bar.You want to score, Eva, Im right here.Im not trolling.Im burning off tension after a stressful day.Youre not the only one.He fingered one of my silver chandelier earrings.So you drink and dance when youre tense.I work on the problem thats making me tense in the first place.His voice had softened, and it stirred an alarming yearning.Is that what I am?A problem?Absolutely.But there was a hint of a smile around his lips.I knew that was a lot of the appeal for him.Gideon Cross wouldnt be where he was, at such a young age, if he took no gracefully.Whats your definition of dating?A frown marred the space between his brows.Lengthy social time spent with a woman during which were not actively fucking.Dont you enjoy the company of women?The frown turned into a scowl.Sure, as long as there arent any exaggerated expectations or excessive demands on my time.Ive found the best way to steer clear of those is to have mutually exclusive sexual relationships and friendships.There were those pesky exaggerated expectations again.Clearly, those were a sticking point with him.So, you do have female friends?Of course.His legs tightened around mine, capturing me.Where are you going with this?You segregate sex from the rest of your life.You separate it from friendship, workeverything.Ive got good reasons for doing that.Im sure you do.Okay, here are my thoughts.It was difficult concentrating when I was so close to Gideon.I told you I dont want to date and I dont.My job is priority number one and my personal life as a single woman is a close second.I dont want to sacrifice any of that time on a relationship and theres really not enough left over to squeeze in anything steady.Im right there with you.But I like sex.Good.Have it with me.His smile was an erotic invitation.I shoved his shoulder.I need a personal connection with the men I sleep with.It doesnt have to be intense or deep, but sex needs to be more than an emotionless transaction for me.Why?I could tell he wasnt being flippant.As bizarre as this conversation must be for him, Gideon was taking it seriously.Call it one of my quirks, and Im not saying that lightly.It pisses me off to feel used for sex.I feel devalued.Cant you look at it as you using me for sex?Not with you.He was too forceful, too demanding.A sizzling, predatory glimmer sparked in his eyes as I bared my weakness for him.Besides, I went on quickly, thats semantics.I need an equal exchange in my sexual relationships.Or to have the upper hand.Okay.Okay?You said that really quickly considering Im telling you I need to combine two things you work so hard to avoid putting together.Im not comfortable with it and I dont claim to understand, but Im hearing you its an issue.Tell me how to get around it.
