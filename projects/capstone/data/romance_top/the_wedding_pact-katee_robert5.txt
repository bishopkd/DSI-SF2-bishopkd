If their father was determined to nail his ass to the wall, it gave his little sisters a chance to find their feet.Not Carrigan, though.I dont know what youre talking about.Yes, you do.Dont play stupid.This came from Aiden.He actually took a step forward, his fists clenching, before their father held up a hand to stall him.Weve all mourned Devlin For fucks sake.Cillian straightened.Really?Because it seems to have been business as usual.Real nostalgic.No one was saying what they were thinkingthat it would have been better if he had been the one to take the bullet.The shock of the thought nearly took his breath away.It was a truth that hed been dancing around for months, and there was something cathartic in finally letting himself think it.It should have been me.Devlin was the one with the world at his feet.Cillian was just going through the motions, dicking around as much as possible.Even with his destined role as accountant, he was expendable.And they all knew it.Aiden crossed his arms over his chest.And getting shit housed drunk every night of the week is honoring our brother?Please.Dont play the martyr to cover up that youre doing what youve always doneskipping out on family business when we need you the most.If I need to drink to deal with shit, then Im going to goddamn well drink.If they thought thats what he was doing, he wasnt going to set them straight.Alcohol had become the enemy the same way the Hallorans were the enemy.Hed been so fucking weak his entire life, had always chosen the easiest path.He was done with that shit now.Enough.Seamus didnt raise his voice, but he might as well have roared by how the single word cut through the room.He waited, but neither Aiden nor Cillian made a sound.Apparently satisfied, their father sat back.We all mourn Devlin in our own ways.You, of all people, should know that, Cillian.Cut down your drinking and take one of our men with you when you go.I refuse to lose another son to carelessness.God forbid another one of your beloved assets slips away.The thought wasnt fair, but Cillian could give two fucks.Maybe their father loved them.Maybe he didnt.But if he did, then he had a hell of a way of showing it.But Seamus was letting him get off easy this time, and he damn well knew it.Ill take an escort.For now.He pushed to his feet.If were done here Sit.His legs went out from beneath him before he made a conscious decision to obey.Bartholomew is retiring.You will begin training with him next week.Once hes satisfied you know whats necessary, you will take over his position.Next week.Hed known it was coming up fast, but hed had no idea how fast.Fuck.It wasnt that Cillian didnt like the idea of keeping the familys books.Ever since hed shown an aptitude for numbers and the morals required for creative accounting, it was assumed hed step into that role when the time came.Hell, a part of him had even looked forward to it.He might never run the OMalleysand, seriously, that wasnt a position he aspired tobut with their finances within his control, hed have the keys to the kingdom, so to speak.Every cent that filtered through their businessesboth legit and illegalwent through the bookkeeper.But then Devlin died, and Teague was married off and helping to run things on the Sheridan side now.And Carrigan Every time he thought about the lost and terrified look on her face when she told him she was going to have to marry a stranger, it made him want to hit something.If that Dmitri guy was any indication, the sharks were already circling, scenting blood in the water.He couldnt imagine his strong willed sister married to someone like that.But she didnt have a choice any more than the rest of them did.He was getting off easy.He knew that.Hed always known that.Once upon a time, hed even reveled in the knowledge.Not anymore.But that had more to do with him than the job he was expected to step into.There wasnt much he got excited about these days, and it sure as fuck wasnt going to be keeping the books with a side of computer hacking that convinced him that the night Devlin died hadnt been a horrible case of fate making a mistake.He blinked, realizing that both his father and brother expected a response from him.A harsh laugh slipped free.Ill be there.He stood again.If theres nothing else His father waved a hand.Go.Gladly.He turned on his heel and marched out of the room before Aiden could chase him down and yell at him for being disrespectful.It used to be that he didnt lose sleep over his siblings fatesnot when he always knew his.Now he couldnt stop thinking about themabout what Devlin would be doing if he wasnt six feet underground.Hed have started his junior year of college in the fall, going about school with the same enthusiasm he went about life.It wasnt the same way Cillian had always lost himself in the partying and good times.Devlin genuinely enjoyed everything from his morning coffee to the lectures from his professors to whatever book he was buried in at the moment.At twenty, part of him had just been soyoung.Full of potential.Potential that had been cut short because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.And his other siblings?Teague was fine.Hell, Teague was better than fine.He had a banging hot wife who seemed to genuinely care about him.If anyone in their family was living the dream, it was Teague.They didnt see him nearly enough these days, what with his attention being focused solely on solidifying the Sheridans hold on their portion of Boston.Cillian didnt blame him for that.His theoretical future kids would be as much Sheridans as OMalleysmore, really.Keira and SloanHe didnt even know.Hed barely seen them since they got back from the house in Connecticut, and that was indication enough that something was off.Keira was normally in the middle of everything, and for her to be playing least in sight wasnt a good sign.And Sloan was probably half a day from slitting her wrists in angst.Im going to need to talk to her sooner rather than later.Aiden didnt seem too torn up about being heir and preparing to step up and take over the family.Cillian had never pegged him for a clone of their father, but then hed been wrong about a lot of things.What did he know?And Carriganfuck.He turned the corner and picked up his pace, heading for the door.There wasnt a damn thing he could do to help Carrigan.There wasnt a damn thing he could do to help anyone.*** Carrigan walked into the restaurant and stopped cold.It was totally and completely empty.She glanced back at the door shed just come through.Surely if it was closed, it would have been locked?Shed been to Slingshot countless times in the last ten years and it didnt matter the day of the week or the hour, it was always damn near packed.She looked around again, wondering what the hell was going on.A flustered girl who couldnt be more than eighteen hurried up.Ms.OMalley?Yes The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end.Was this a trap?Dmitri was on her fathers list, so shed assumed he was safe enough to meet.Surely she hadnt assumed wrong?Damn it, I know better than this.Wheres Liam?Hed gone to park the car, so hed be here in just a few minutes.She touched her purse.The Taser was still stashed in the bottom of it.She could use it if she had toit wouldnt kill anyone, but itd give her a chance to run.If there was a legitimate threat, Liam was more equipped to deal with it than she was, no matter how much she hated relying on someone else to ride in and save the day.Its safe.The Russian accent rolled over her like the best kind of vodka.The man who stepped out from behind the column matched it perfectly.Carrigan had the wild thought that hed been standing there with the sole purpose to make an entrance, but then he took a step closer and she was too busy staring to speak.He waswell, he was gorgeous.Dark hair styled perfectly.Cheekbones sharp enough to cut, which should have made him look feminine but didnt in the least.And those gray eyes.Good lord, the man was sex on a stick.If you didnt mind that the stick was more likely to beat you to death than fuck you.Other women might miss it, but there was a coldness in his eyes that his smile didnt touch.She had a feeling those eyes never warmed up.Not to mention everything about this meeting was orchestrated to put him in a position of power for their exchange.Hed shown up first, made sure one of the most popular restaurants in the neighborhood was empty, and had waited until she had her guard down in the confusion to make his entrance.If she was taking bets, shed bet that he never went into any situation without first making sure he would be in control of every aspect of it.Dangerous.Very, very dangerous.She cleared her throat.Dmitri Romanov, I presume.You presume correctly.He motioned at the empty restaurant behind him.I thought our meal would proceed smoother if we didnt have an audience.Either that, or he wanted as few witnesses as possible to take care of after he murdered her.She glanced back at the door again.Where the hell was Liam?Dmitri caught her look.If youre uncomfortable, we can go somewhere else.Damn it, she was so flustered, she wasnt bothering to mask her expressions.Carrigan took a careful breath and smiled.No, this is fine.Its just unexpected.And strangely thoughtful, though she was still more inclined to look at it through the potentially violent lens than the romantic one.Shall we sit?He motioned to a table set back from the windows, where no one from the street would have a clear view of them.With a nod, she moved to the table and took a chair that put her back to the wall.Maybe this Dmitri wasnt a threat to her, but that didnt mean he wasnt dangerous.She already knew he was.The problem was that people tended to present the best versions of themselves when they first met strangers.It was up to her to dig through the bullshit to the meat beneath, and she couldnt do that until she got the conversation rolling.So, Dmitri, tell me about yourself.He sank into the chair across from her with an effortless grace she envied.First date questions, Carrigan?Ignoring the heat of embarrassment rising up her neck, she lifted her chin.Do you have a better idea?Im on a compressed timeline, which Im sure youre aware of.I have to start somewhere.Then why dont we start with why Im on this list of your fathers?He looked completely relaxed, as long as she ignored the eyes.Those eyes watched her like she was a deer and he was a wolf, just waiting for her to twitch in the wrong direction before he pounced.I run a very prominent empire in New York.You father wisely sees the value of allies outside Boston.New York.Which most likely meant shed be required to move down there, because he certainly wasnt going to relocate up here.Her lungs turned to lead, and she gripped the edge of her chair as she fought lightheadedness.Somehow, even in the middle of all this, shed never once considered that she might have to leave Boston.I see.There were days when she wanted to burn the city to the ground around her, but it was home.A waitress appeared next to their table, giving Carrigan a much needed breather, and set down two glasses of water.She poured them each a glass of red wine, and then left as silently as shed come.This Carrigan could focus on.High handed of you.Why did every rich man in the world think that drinking wine was required?At least hed ordered red instead of whitea tiny silver lining.I like to go into business meetings having the upper hand.His smile was more shark than sheepish.Forgive me, but I did a bit of research.If hed done as much research as he claimed, hed know she preferred dirty martinis to wine any day of the week.James had figured that out all on his own.Thinking about him right now is a mistake.Focus on the man across from you.She took a cautious sip of the wine and nearly melted into her seat.It was light and a little fruity and hands down the best wine shed ever had.This isnt half bad.Since he seemed to want to cut to the chase, she might as well play.Youll be expecting me to move to your home and play the little wife in between popping out half a dozen children.Setting aside the small talk.Good.This time his smile was almost real, though it still didnt reach his eyes.To answer your questionIm willing to negotiate.I have no interest in a little wife, as you so eloquently put it.Especially an unwilling one.Pretty words, but she trusted this man as far as she could throw him.So what is it you do want?A part time partner.I have no need of someone to help me run my various business ventures, but there are times when having a wife on my arm would make or break a deal.It also creates stability, because my people see me as settling down and providing heirs that will prevent a civil war.Stability, Carrigan, is key.So, yes, I will need children, though half a dozen seems excessiveno offense to your parents, of course.Of course.She took another sip of wine through numb lips.You say a part time partner.Should I take up knitting when you dont need to dust me off, prop me up, and have me entertain guests?He shot her a look.Hardly.I see no reason why you cant spend a good portion of the time here in Bostonas long as you agree to the appropriate protection.I simply ask that you do nothing to bring negative attention.And that you stay faithful.It was so strange to have it all laid out there in bald terms.Part of her wanted to scream at him for making her feel soWhat?If hed given her romance, she would have called him a liar.All hed done was tear away the thin curtain between her and reality.Shed known what these men expected of her.Dmitri was simply clearing the air.She sat back.Do you conduct all your negotiations like this?Only when the situation calls for it.Youre a smart woman, and I thought youd appreciate it if I was frank with you.He frowned, the first time his perfect mask had so much as cracked.Was I wrong?Would you prefer flowers and romance and pretty words?No, thank you.She could almost feel the room solidifying around her as she found her feet again.Hed caught her off guard, but she found she actually preferred this to the lies people tended to tell when they first met each other.James hasnt lied to you.Shut up.James wasnt her future.It didnt matter how he made her feel or that she said things to him she never would have said to anyone else.She couldnt hold him up in comparison to every man on her fathers list.Theyd all end up wanting.Dmitri was nothing like him.He was dark where James was light, polished where James was rough, a shark to Jamess junkyard dog.Maybe all the differences were a good thing.She set her wineglass down.Two children, and Im in Boston at least six months of the year.Ill agree to the two children.I cant promise specific timelines as I dont know when Ill need you.He paused and smiled at the waitress who now brought their food.Rueben for him, and a chicken Caesar wrap for her.Her favorite.This one you got right.She snagged a fry and took a bite.Perfection.Research allows me to surpass a lot of the unnecessary bits.He pushed his plate to the side.As I was saying, initially youll need to be in New York more.I have to establish your place in my home for both allies and enemies.The first year, possibly more, will require the majority of your time to be spent with me.She didnt like the idea of it, but it was fairfairer than any other deal she was likely to get.That didnt mean she had to drop everything and jump on it.Ill let you know.Dmitri smiled his sharks smile.I wouldnt expect anything else.He had her and he knew it.Unless her date tonight went spectacularlyor the one she had yet to set up with Charles Popeshe wasnt likely to get a better offer.Carrigan rose.Thank you for your time, Mr.Romanov.I look forward to seeing you again, Carrigan.She turned and walked away, feeling his gaze on the back of her neck the whole while.*** An hour in the gym later, and James couldnt get the feeling of blood off his hands.He stood beneath the scalding spray of the shower and scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed.It didnt help.Rationally, he knew nothing would help.The problem was mentalnot physical.He looked at his hands, red and raw from the repeated washings.Damn it.He turned off the shower and dried off.In the past, whenever he got too close to the edge, hed locked himself in the room with his mothers photo album and anchored himself by remembering happier days.That option wasnt availablehadnt been since Carrigan took the album.He needed it back, the sooner the better.The thought of carrying on like this without an anchor made him sick to his stomach.This life was a slippery slope, and he was already too far gone.If he wasnt careful, hed wake up one day and realize hed turned into his old man.James grabbed his phone and dialed.Hed meant to call her back earlier, since his promise to her was still ringing in his ears, but he couldnt with the memory of what hed done to Joe still riding him so hard.It wasnt going away anytime soon, though, and maybe some time with her was just what he needed to center himself.The longer the line rang, the tenser he got.What if shes in trouble?She hadnt left a message earlier, but that didnt mean a damn thing.Hed told her to call when she needed him, and then the first time shed called, he hadnt answered.Good job, dipshit.The call clicked over to voice mail and he cursed.Im sorry I missed your call.Im here now.As tempting as it was to keep talking, to postpone the moment when he had to admit hed fucked up, he made himself hang up.A knock on his door made him frown.What?Its me, boss.Michael poked his head in.I double checked that shit you gave me.Its all like Joe said.The first meeting Ricky actually pulled off was with those guys you met at Tit for Tat.His breath left him in a rush.Thank Christ hed been able to put the brakes on his brother before he did any more damage.Good.Anything else you need from me?Check on my brother and you can head out.Between Joe and the aftermath, hed wasted the day away.Where are you, Carrigan?He made sure his ringer was on and pocketed his phone.He wasnt going to be able to eat anytime soon, but he couldnt sit up here and mope in his room for the rest of the night.It was important he be seen, both as a warning and a promise to his people.Which meant Mickeys was on the agenda.He drove down there even though it was within walking distance.It was tempting to just keep driving.Too tempting.He had to remind himself of his responsibilities and what was expected of him more and more often as time went on.As shitty as it was, he dreaded the day where it all became second nature to him.When he finally fully stepped into the man he was required to be in order to run the Hallorans.The monster.Fuck, he was a moody bitch today.James walked into Mickeys, ignoring the way silence fell as the men there caught sight of him.He made a beeline to the bar and nodded at Tommy.Tommy actually blanched before he caught himself.Not you, too.James forced his shoulders back and nodded.Fear or love.He might have been coming in here since before he could legally drink, but that history didnt matter anymore.What mattered was that Tommy now saw him as someone to be feared.Whiskey.He ignored the way the bartenders hands shook as he poured a healthy glass and passed it over.James didnt say thanksjust took the glass and retreated to his customary booth in the back.From here he could see everyone in the place.He sipped his drink as they slowly relaxed, and conversation started back up.Good.He might scare the shit out of them now, but they werent completely crippled by it.When his old man came into a room, no one spoke until he left it again.James didnt like to think about what he had to have done in order to command that kind of fear.Because he already knew.He checked his phone again.Nothing.This was so damn stupid.James shook his head and downed half his whiskey.He should just track her ass down and make sure she was okayexcept that was stalking, and hed already crossed too many lines when it came to Carrigan.He couldnt drop everything and go rushing to her side when that wasnt what shed asked him to do.There had to be a line somewhere.He set his phone aside and concentrated on the whiskey in his glass, letting the low conversation from the pub roll over him.Shed call if she needed him.Simple as that.He just had to make sure he didnt drop the ball next time she did.If she called again.Thirteen Carrigan checked her phone for the twelfth time in five minutes.There was no way around it.Not only had James not called her back since the first time, but Kellen ONeill was late.Extremely late.Over thirty minutes late.She should have known after the conversation with her mother that the day was only going to go downhill from there, but the puppy had been so eager over the phone that she hadnt really thought hed stand her up.Another glance at her phone.Yeah, still late.She heaved a sigh.She should just go home.Dmitri had already offered her a legitimate choice, even if it was the best option of a group of truly shitty options.She didnt really need Kellen ONeill.But she didnt stand up and leave.A few more minutes.She eyed her empty glass.Another martini wouldnt hurt.It wasnt like she was driving.She smiled at the nervous looking waiter and ordered.He thinks Im being stood up, too.Wonderful.More to keep her hands busy than anything else, she texted James.Hey stranger.As soon as she pushed send, she regretted it.He hadnt answered her call earlier.Yes, hed called backa call shed ignoredbutreally, she didnt have a reason to be hurt or pissed or anything.Theyd had sex twice, but they were hardly friends.She shouldnt even be texting him right now.Another glance around the restaurant proved that Kellen was, in fact, still late.Her phone rang in her hand, startling her so bad, she almost dropped it.Hello?Im sorry I missed your call earlier.She was, too.Though it had allowed her to get through lunch without the distraction he offeredboth a blessing and a curse, as it turned out.What the hell was she going to do about Dmitri?She straightened the fork next to her plate.Its not a big deal.It is.I told you Id be there and then I fucked up.Im sorry.He went on before she could answer.What are you doing right now?Being stood up, I think.She forced a laugh.Another date with a guy from that list?Yes.This was what her life had been reduced toand it hadnt exactly been a dream to begin with.She was waiting for a man her father approved of, with the sole purpose of marrying her off, while on the phone with a man that was the enemy as far as the OMalleys were concerned.Apparently he doesnt find Ciao to his liking.Something rustled on the other end of the phone, and she thought she heard a door slam.Hes a fool.Im not arguing that.Ive giving him ten more minutes, and Im bailing.Right now a date with my bathtub sounds like heaven.James growled.I like the picture that brings to mind.Bubbles?Absolutely.She smiled and nodded her thanks to the waiter who brought her drink replacement.Mine smell like roses and suds up like crazy.Damn, lovely, Id like to see that.He wouldnt be able to, though.He wasnt welcome in her house, and she sure as hell wasnt going back to his anytime soon.Unlike Teague, James didnt keep an apartment somewhere outside the territory of their families.She let herself imagine what itd be like to have him in a bed, to be able to cozy up with him on a couch while watching a movie, to do any of the thousand little things that people took for granted.It would never happen.She glanced up to find a young man hustling through the tables toward her.His suit was wrinkled, and hed obviously been worrying at his tie because it was loose and hanging cockeyed.Shed bet this was Kellen ONeill.Ive got to go.I think my date is here.Hes not worth your time.No, he wasnt.Shed much rather stay on the phone, but this date was a necessary evil.Im not arguing that.Good night, James.She reluctantly hung up and slipped her phone into her purse.The guy stopped next to her table.Carrigan OMalley?Yes.I am so damn sorry.You wouldnt believe the hell I went through to get here.He dropped into the seat across from hers and scrubbed a hand over his face.My car broke down two miles away and I had to hoof it.He wasnt bad looking, though his red hair somehow made him look even younger than he likely was.Pretty blue eyes, though.She raised her eyebrows.His car broke down?It must have been some trek if he somehow managed to get lipstick on his collar in the process.Another one bites the dust.She sipped her drink.You made it, though.I did.His smile was kind of sweet, and she was struck by the thought that her world would eat him up and spit him out without hesitation.A puppy, indeed.Thank you for waiting.I almost didnt.If she didnt get this conversational ball rolling, theyd be reduced to commenting about the weather in thirty seconds flat.So what is it you do, Kellen?Why are you on my fathers list?Im in software engineering.He launched into the description of some kind of technological mumbo jumbo that she could barely follow.She could actually feel her eyes glazing over, but she tried to focus.He might be a puppy, but this guy seemed genuinely nice, even if he was a damn fool for showing up for this date with evidence of another woman on his collar.There was no shark lurking beneath his skin, and she doubted hed have the idiocy to shove her against a wall and force his tongue into her mouth.I could manipulate a man like this.With some careful planning, I could have him eating out of the palm of my hand.But he wouldnt be faithful.Who am I kidding?None of these men are going to be faithful.This is a business arrangement, not a love match.She sipped her drink again.Thats fascinating.He grinned.Its really not, but thanks for saying so.Im sure you have much more interesting stuff to talk about than my boring company.She might, but him nattering on about his company gave her the distance to let her thoughts wander.Carrigan started to ask another question, but movement near the front of the restaurant made her look over.She stared.She was seeing things.She had to be.There was no way that James was now shouldering past the harried looking hostess and stalking toward her, intent in every line of his body.He wore a pair of faded jeans and a black shirt and, holy shit, an obviously well loved leather jacket.She pressed her legs together.It was all too easy to imagine what it would be like to swing up behind him on a motorcycle, with his big body wedged between her thighs, and hang on for dear life as he gunned the engine and they took off.Shed felt free flying down the interstate in his car.How much more so would she feel on the back of a motorcycle?Do you know that guy?Huh?Hes looking at you likeuh, like he knows you.Kellen sounded uncomfortable, but Carrigan couldnt tear her gaze away from James.He stopped next to their table and took the seat next to Carrigan.Hey, lovely.Hi She finally looked at Kellen, whose mouth was hanging open.James, this is Kellen.Kellen, James.James barely glanced at him.You dont show up for a date with a woman like this with lipstick from another woman on your collar.Fuck, man, you dont show up for a date at all with another womans lipstick on you.He turned back to Carrigan.You seriously considering this guy?No, she wasnt.But there was something like jealousy in Jamess face, and she couldnt help poking at him a little.I dont know.He seems nice.Im sitting right here.Thats your first mistake.Theres no such thing as a nice guy.Were all dogs, lovely.Every single one of us.He jerked his thumb at Kellen.This one just pretties up better than most.Didnt your brothers tell you that its the so called nice guys you have to watch out for?She had had that conversation with Aiden many years ago.It made Carrigan smile to think about.Her oldest brother might be making choices right now that she hated, but once upon a time theyd been close.I think I remember hearing something about that.Still sitting right here.Pipe the fuck down, kid.James shot him a look.As I was saying, you dont really want to marry this guy, do you?She didnt really want to marry any guyespecially the ones her father had chosen.But wailing about it wasnt going to do a damn bit of good and they both knew it.Im doing the best I can with the options I have.I know.Hell, I know better than most.Abruptly he grinned and held out his hand.You want to get out of here?Are you fucking kidding me?She looked at Kellen, who didnt look all that nice now.Not that she could blame him.He was a mottled shade of red that didnt go well with his bright hair, and he looked about ready to burst a blood vessel in his forehead.I Go back to whatever woman you left to come here, kid.This one doesnt want you.Jesus Christ.Fine.Whatever.She seems like a stuck up bitch anyway.Kellen shoved to his feet, nearly knocking over his chair, and gave them one last disgusted look before he marched away.James snorted.Now, where were we?That was mean.A laugh bubbled up inside her, and she pressed a hand to her mouth to keep it inside.She should yell at him for his high handedness and showing up uninvited, but the truth was that hed saved her from another hour of boring conversation with a man who was barely more than a child.Really mean.You like me mean.He motioned her forward with his fingers.What do you say?She could go home, climb in a bath, and hope that would be enough to soak away her misery.Or she could take this mans hand and run away from reality for a while.Really, it was no contest.Carrigan slipped her hand into his.Where we going?Crazy, lovely.Were going crazy.*** Knowing Carrigan was marrying another man was one thing.Seeing her sit across the table from some douche who didnt deserve her was something else entirely.It made James see red.Hed wanted to snatch that little shit up and shake him for being so goddamn disrespectful enough to be late, let alone show up with evidence of another woman on his clothes.When you had a shot at a woman like Carrigan, all others paled in comparison.Except James didnt really have a shot.All he had was stolen time.He knew thatfuck, it was a truth he couldnt escapebut the thought still soured his stomach.He wasnt sure if knowing she obviously wanted him as much has he wanted her made things better or worse.Carrigan was the calm in the middle of the hurricane that was his life.It didnt make a damn bit of sense because half the time she drove him up the wall, but the second her hand slipped into his, the tightness in his chest loosened, just a little, and he could breathe again.He led the way out onto the street and waited for her to text her driver.Hes trustworthy?As trustworthy as anyone is.Though if you kill me and dump my body in a ditch, hes going to take it personally.James snorted.Lovely, there are half a million things Id love to do to your body, and not a single one of them includes pain, let alone death.Thatscomforting.She turned off her phone and dropped it into her purse.It brought his attention to her clothing.Hed been so focused on getting that asshole out of his presence that he had to step back and take a look at the long white dress she wore tonight.It was different from the one hed last seen her inthere was a definite Grecian feel to the way the fabric fell around her, but it was white and it covered more skin than it exposed.White is the last color Id choose for you.She shot him a sharp look.You dont get an opinion.Maybe not, but those tiny little excuses for dresses that you wear to the club are more you than this.He pinched the fabric that fell from her hips, and lifted it a little before letting it flutter back into place.What would you wear if you werent trying to play a role?Maybe one day Ill show you.She moved past him, the dress giving her the illusion of floating over the ground instead of walking on it.Wheres your car?This way.They strode around the corner to the tiny parking lot.He held the door open for her and then took the drivers seat.You up for a little drive?As if you have to ask.She ran her hand lovingly over the dashboard.I could spend days in this car.He pulled out of the parking lot, picturing what a road trip with Carrigan would look like.Would she wear jeans?Maybe kick off her shoes and prop her bare feet on the dash?Would she laugh as the wind whipped her long hair around, her green eyes hidden by a pair of oversized sunglasses?He liked the image.He liked the image too damn much.He drove out of Boston, heading north.The falling night was clear and cold, and the roads were almost deserted.From time to time, he glanced at Carrigan, but shed pulled her knees to her chest and was staring out the passenger window, obviously lost in thought.James wanted to know what she was thinking.Fuck, he wanted to know everything.But he didnt have a right to.Beyond that, he had a feeling that she got even less time to herself than he did.So he drove in silence and let his mind wander.Hed been so focused on Ricky, hed almost forgotten about the shipment of girls coming in soon.Just thinking about it made him feel dirty.Yeah, he wasnt going to set them up as slaves for his own purposes, but that was a cold comfort.Because it was just one shipment.There would be others that he couldnt help.Once the flesh peddlers realized he wasnt in the business anymore, theyd take their merchandise elsewhere.James seriously doubted whoever bought those girls would feel as sick about it as he did.What if I kept buying them?He tightened his grip on the steering wheel.It wasnt possiblewas it?He couldnt just buy the girls and then set them loose.Thatd be almost as fucked up as keeping them.Theyd each need to be offered a choice, and if they chose to go out on their own, theyd need their own start up fund.Thatd drain resources that were already strained.But if all his legit businesses started to see the increase that Tit for Tat did It was something to think about.The Hallorans put so much evil out into the world.Maybe it was time for him to start balancing the ledgers.He glanced at Carrigan again.What would she think of the so called plan?Before he could think better of it, he said, If you were going to buy up women from the flesh trade and set them free, how would you go about it?He braced for her to look at him like he was crazy, but she just twined a strand of hair around her finger and frowned.Thatd require a lot of resources if you wanted to make any kind of impact.I know.Resources he didnt have access to without stooping to lows he promised himself hed never touch.She frowned harder.And theres the added complication that youre just creating a demand for a very specific kind of product.Youd have to have something long term in place to take out the main players, otherwise it might actually contribute to the overall problem, rather than helping it.I know.He hadnt thought that far ahead, but it was a valid point.He could ship in all the girls he wanted, but hed just be ripping more women from their lives if he didnt cut the head off the snake, so to speak.For someone who doesnt want responsibility to begin with, you sure as fuck attract it.I have something in mind.The night that his old man had been arrested had given him the idea.Someone on the other side had been in bed with the feds.While James wasnt willing to go that far, he thought he could work something out where he threw them the information on the sellers he had and let them do their damn jobs.If it had the added bonus of helping keep them off his back and out of Halloran business, well, he was okay with that, too.In that case Carrigan snapped her fingers.Nonprofit.When he motioned for her to continue, she shrugged.They arent the simplest things to set up, and thered be some serious challenges along the wayespecially for a family like yours or minebut as long as you kept the funds collected going exactly where theyre supposed to and aboveboard, it would be a valid option.Maybe for her.She moved in the circles of society who liked to whip out their checkbooks for that kind of thing.In his neighborhood, most everyone was struggling just to get by.Hmm.She turned to face him fully.Are you seriously considering something like that?I thought you guys dealt in the sex trade.Sex trade is different than slave trade.He knew he sounded furious, but it was hard to rein it in when hed worked so fucking hard to get them out of it, only to have his brother trying to drag them back to hell.I got us out of the involuntary flesh trade.And now youre thinking about getting back into it for different reasons.Even in the moving shadows of his car, her green eyes saw too much.You could make a serious difference, James.Even if you did it on a small scale, every person you save is a miracle.He couldnt have her looking at him like that, like he was some kind of white knight or hero or some shit.He wasnt.He was just a man whod done more bad than good, a man who wanted to balance the scales in any way he could.It probably wouldnt work out anyway.James She trailed off and turned back to look out the window.I was going to offer to help, but I cant promise anything with my current situation.Which was the exact thing hed brought her out here to help her forget.Great job, asshole.He took the exit for York, and wound down to the little seaside town.It was a summer tourist spot, so it was nearly deserted this time of year, and the evening hour only added to that.Which was perfect.He didnt have the patience to deal with other people right now.All he wanted was some one on one time with Carrigan away from Boston.He parked next to the beach and climbed out of the car.She was out before he could come around to open the door for her, and she wasnt looking at the ocean behind them.Instead, she was focused on the house at his back.I know this house.If shed spent any time looking at that album, she would.It was my mothers.The only thing that had been hers and hers alone in her marriage with Victor.He didnt know how shed managed to pull that off, but he was grateful.Shed brought them up herejust her and her boysfor a few weeks each summer every year while they were growing up.Shed passed it to James when she died.He ignored the dull ache in his chest that always came with thoughts of this place.Some of the happiest times of his life had been spent in this little town, but they were all because of her.She could have taken them to a shack in the middle of the woods with no running water, and he still would have been in heaven.I havent been back here in something like twelve years.Not since hed come up here after he turned eighteen to set up a maid service to clean the place out once a month after his mother died.He looked over when Carrigan took his hand and squeezed.We dont have to go in if you dont want to.Her shiver belied her words.She wasnt dressed for the frigid winds coming off the water.That got him moving more than anything.He kept a hold of her hand as they crossed the street and walked up the steps.The place still looked the same as it had when he was fourteen.Hed paid for repairs out of pocket as they came upmost recently it had been the roof that needed to be completely replaced.James unlocked the door and stepped back to let Carrigan precede him.They moved through the entrance to the living room and kitchen, turning on lights as they went.It was like stepping into the past, the cheery beach decorations and bright colors still almost painful after all this time.She stopped in front of the mantel and touched a painting of three boys playing on the beach.None of their faces were visible, but he had no problem recognizing which was which.Your mother?She said painting calmed her thoughts and she needed all the calm she could scrape up in a houseful of boys.The bittersweet ache in his chest unraveled a little.His old man didnt talk about Elizabeth Halloran, and James had learned pretty damn fast after her death that to bring her up was as good as asking for a beating.But his brothers didnt want to talk about her, either.It seemed like the pictures of her had disappeared overnightas if shed been a figment of his imagination all along and he was the only one still clinging to it.This beach house was the only place left untouched, the only one that still bore the stamp of her years in this world.James sat on the couch and ran his hand over the knotted afghan draped over the back of it.The thing had more holes than yarn.She tried knitting, but she was terrible at it.He smiled at the memory of her cursing up a storm as she finally threw it across the room.And how hed picked it up and brought it back to her and told her that it was the most beautiful thing hed seen.Hed been maybe all of ten.You dont have to I know.He looked around the room again, seeing the ghosts of so many good memories that hed locked away.I didnt bring you out here to whine about my poor dead mother.This was just the one place I figured we could both sit down and breathe for a little bit.So you didnt bring me up here to seduce me.She smiled as she sat next to him.Im horribly disappointed.I think I could sneak in some seduction.He tugged on her hand, pulling her to sprawl across his chest.It felt right to have her here in this place with the wind howling around the house and the memories of a time long gone around them.Come out with me.She arched her eyebrows.I hate to be the one to point this out, but I am out with you.Thats not what I mean.He paused and tried to figure out the best way to go about this.She hadnt signed on for anything, let alone anything beyond sex.But seeing her sitting across the table from that kid tonight had really struck home how fucked up their situations had been since they met.He wanted a slice of normalcy, even if normalcy wasnt normal.Carrigan OMalley, Id like to take you on a date.Her eyebrows rose.A date.Yeah.The whole nine yards.But not tonight.Nope.He brushed her hair back from her face.Tonight I swept in and crashed your date with that idiotyoure welcome, by the wayso it doesnt count.Her lips twitched.You are a very strange man, James Halloran.Lovely, you have no idea.He kissed her, soft and slow, taking his time because neither of them had anywhere to be, and fuck if hed rush this.For the first time, he had her in a house with walls between them and the rest of the worldnot the backseat of his car or, worse, the goddamn storage closet in a club.She went soft as he traced the seam of her lips with his tongue.He pulled back, framing her face with his hands.Come to bed with me.Fourteen Carrigan couldnt shake the feeling that this was about to change everything.She could get up and walk away, and hed let her.She knew James well enough to know that now.Or she could say yes to his question that wasnt a question and jump headfirst down the rabbit hole.I only have a little less than two weeks left.What do I really have to lose?Nothing.But it still felt like a huge step when she nodded.Yes.He didnt move.Yes?Take me to bed, James.He grinned and pressed a quick kiss to her lips.Then he was up and sweeping her into his arms.She gave a startled shriek.Hey!Let me have my caveman ways.He strode through the house, not bothering to turn on any more lights and not missing a step despite the shadows.He nudged open a door with his foot and kicked it shut behind them.She sent him a questioning look, which he answered.Guest bedroom.I dont think anyone used it in the entire time this place has been ours.He set her carefully on her feet.Dont move.His terse orders shouldnt set fire to her blood.She hated orders in every other part of her life, so it didnt make a damn bit of sense that when they came from James, she had to fight not to melt into a puddle at his feet.
