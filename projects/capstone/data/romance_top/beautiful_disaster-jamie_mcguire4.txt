Im having lunch with my parents, but Ill call you later, okay?Okay.Thank you!I called after him, watching him trot down the stairs.I hurried into the apartment, unable to take my eyes off of my wrist.Holy shit, Abby!America said, grabbing my hand.Where did you get this?Parker brought it.Its my birthday present, I said.America gawked at me, and then down at the bracelet.He bought you a diamond tennis bracelet?After a week?If I didnt know better, Id say you have a magic crotch!I laughed out loud, beginning a ridiculous giggle fest in the living room.Shepley emerged from his bedroom, looking tired and satisfied.What are you fruitcakes shrieking about in here?America held up my wrist.Look!Her birthday present from Parker!Shepley squinted, and then his eyes popped open.Whoa.I know, right?America said, nodding.Travis stumbled around the corner, looking a bit beat up.You guys are loud as fuck, he groaned, buttoning his jeans.Sorry, I said, pulling my hand from Americas grip.Our almost moment crept into my mind, and I couldnt seem to look him in the eyes.He downed the rest of my orange juice, and then wiped his mouth.Who in the hell let me drink that much last night?America sneered, You did.You went out and bought a fifth after Abby left with Parker, and killed the whole thing by the time she got back.Damn, he said, shaking his head.Did you have fun?he asked, looking to me.Are you serious?I asked, showing my anger before thinking.What?America laughed.You pulled her out of Parkers car, seeing red when you caught them making out like high schoolers.They fogged up the windows and everything!Travis eyes unfocused, scanning his memories of the night before.I worked to stifle my temper.If he didnt remember pulling me from the car, he wouldnt remember how close I came to handing my virginity to him on a silver platter.How pissed are you?he asked, wincing.Pretty pissed.I was angrier that my feelings had nothing to do with Parker.I tightened my robe and stomped down the hall.Travis footsteps were right behind me.Pidge, he said, catching the door when I shut it in his face.He slowly pushed it open and stood before me, waiting to suffer my wrath.Do you remember anything you said to me last night?I asked.No.Why?Was I mean to you?His bloodshot eyes were heavy with worry, which only served to amplify my anger.No you werent mean to me!Youwe.I covered my eyes with my hands, and then froze when I felt Travis hand on my wrist.Whered this come from?he said, glaring at the bracelet.Its mine, I said, pulling away from him.He didnt take his eyes from my wrist.Ive never seen it before.It looks new.It is.Whered you get it?Parker gave it to me about fifteen minutes ago, I said, watching his face morph from confusion to rage.What the fuck was that douchebag doing here?Did he stay the night?he asked, his voice rising with each question.I crossed my arms.He went shopping for my birthday present this morning and brought it by.Its not your birthday, yet.His face turned a deep shade of red as he worked to keep his temper under control.He couldnt wait, I said, lifting my chin with stubborn pride.No wonder I had to drag your ass out of his car, sounds like you were.he trailed off, pressing his lips together.I narrowed my eyes.What?Sounds like I was what?His jaws tensed and he took a deep breath, blowing it out from his nose.Nothing.Im just pissed off, and I was going to say something shitty that I didnt mean.Its never stopped you before.I know.Im working on it, he said, walking to the door.Ill let you get dressed.When he reached for the knob, he paused, rubbing his arm.As soon as his fingers touched the tender splatter of purple pooling under his skin, he pulled up his elbow and noticed the bruise.He stared at it for a moment, and then turned to me.I fell on the stairs last night.And you helped me to bed.he said, sifting through the blurry images in his mind.My heart was pounding, and I swallowed hard as I watched realization strike.His eyes narrowed.We, he began, taking a step toward me, looking at the closet, and then to the bed.No we didnt.Nothing happened, I said, shaking my head.He cringed, the memory obviously replaying in his mind.You fog up Parkers windows, I pull you out of the car, and then I try to, he said, shaking his head.He turned for the door and grabbed the knob, his knuckles white.Youre turning me into a fucking psycho, Pigeon, he growled over his shoulder.I dont think straight when Im around you.So its my fault?He turned.His eyes fell from my face to my robe, to my legs, and then my feet, returning to my eyes.I dont know.My memory is a little hazybut I dont recall you saying no.I took a step forward, ready to argue that irrelevant little fact, but I couldnt.He was right.What do you want me to say, Travis?He looked at the bracelet, and then back at me with accusing eyes.You were hoping I wouldnt remember?No!I was pissed that you forgot!His brown eyes bored into mine.Why?Because if I would haveif we would haveand you didntI dont know why!I just was!He stormed across the room, stopping inches from me.His hands touched each side of my face, his breathing quick as he scanned my face.What are we doin, Pidge?My eyes began at his belt, and then rose over the muscles and tattoos of his stomach and chest, finally settling on the warm brown of his irises.You tell me.Abby?Shepley said, knocking on the door.Mare was going to run some errands, she wanted me to let you know in case you needed to go.Travis hadnt taken his eyes from mine.Pidge?Yeah, I called to Shepley.I have some stuff I need to take care of.All right, shes ready to go when you are, Shepley said, his footsteps disappearing down the hall.Pidge?I pulled a few things from the closet and slid past him.Can we talk about this later?I have a lot to do today.Sure, he said with a contrived smile.It was a relief when I reached the bathroom, hurriedly closing the door behind me.I had two weeks left in the apartment, and there was no way to put off the conversation for that long.The logical part of my brain insisted that Parker was my type: attractive, smart and interested in me.Why I bothered with Travis was something I would never understand.Whatever the reason, it was making us both insane.I had been divided into two separate people; the docile, polite person I was with Parker, and the angry, confused, frustrated person I turned into around Travis.The entire school had witnessed Travis going from unpredictable before, to damn near volatile.I dressed quickly, leaving Travis and Shepley to go downtown with America.She giggled about her morning sexcapade with Shepley, and I listened with dutiful nods in all the right places.It was hard to focus on the topic at hand with the diamonds of my bracelet creating tiny dots of light on the ceiling of the car, reminding me of the choice I was suddenly faced with.Travis wanted an answer, and I didnt have one.Okay, Abby.Whats going on?Youve been quiet.This thing with Travisits just a mess.Why?she said, her sunglasses pushing up when she wrinkled her nose.He asked me what we were doing.What are you doing?Are you with Parker or what?I like him but its been a week.Were not serious or anything.You have feelings for Travis, dont you?I shook my head.I dont know how I feel about him.I just dont see it happening, Mare.Hes too much of a bad thing.Neither one of you will just come out and say it, thats the problem.Youre both so scared of what might happen that youre fighting it tooth and nail.I know for a fact that if you looked Travis in the eye and told him you wanted him, he would never look at another woman again.You know that for a fact?Yes.I have the inside track, remember?I paused in thought for a moment.Travis had been talking to Shepley about me, but Shepley wouldnt encourage a relationship by telling America.He knew she would tell me, leading me to the only conclusion: America had overheard them.I wanted to ask her what was said, but thought better of it.That situation is a broken heart just waiting to happen, I said, shaking my head.I dont think hes capable of being faithful.He wasnt capable of carrying on a friendship with a female, either, but you two sure shocked the whole of Eastern.I fingered my bracelet and sighed.I dont know.I dont mind how things are.We can just be friends.America shook her head.Except that youre not just friends, she sighed.You know what?Im over this conversation.Lets go get our hair and makeup done.Ill buy you a new outfit for your birthday.I think thats exactly what I need, I smiled.After hours of manicures, pedicures, being brushed, waxed and powdered, I stepped into my shiny, yellow high heels and tugged on my new, grey dress.Now thats the Abby I know and love!she laughed, shaking her head at my ensemble.You have to wear that to your party tomorrow.Wasnt that the plan all along?I said, smirking.My cell phone buzzed in my purse, and I held it to my ear.Hello?Its dinner time!Where the hell did you two run off to?Travis said.We indulged in a little pampering.You and Shep knew how to eat before we came along.Im sure you can manage.Well, no shit.We worry about you, ya know.I looked at America and smiled.Were fine.Tell him Ill have you back in no time.I have to stop by Brazils to pick up some notes for Shep, and then well be home.Did you get that?I asked.Yeah.See you then, Pidge.We drove to Brazils in silence.America turned off the ignition, staring at the apartment building ahead.Shepley asking America to drive over surprised me; we were just a block from Shepley and Travis apartment,  Whats wrong, Mare?Brazil just gives me the creeps.The last time I was here with Shep, he was being all flirty.Well, Ill go in with you.If he so much as winks at you, Ill stab him in the eye with my new heels, okay?America smiled and hugged me.Thanks, Abby!We walked to the back of the building, and America took a deep breath before knocking on the door.We waited, but no one came.I guess hes not here?I asked.Hes here, she said, irritated.She banged on the wood with the side of her fist and then the door swung open.HAPPY BIRTHDAY!the crowd inside yelled.The ceiling was pink and black bubbles, every inch covered by helium balloons, with long, silver strings hanging down in the faces of the guests.The crowd separated, and Travis walked approached me with a broad smile, touching each side of my face and kissing my forehead.Happy birthday, Pigeon.Its not til tomorrow, I said.Still in shock, I tried smiling at everyone around us.Travis shrugged.Well, since you were tipped off, we had to make some last minute changes to surprise you.Surprised?Very!I said as Finch hugged me.Happy birthday, Baby!Finch said, kissing my lips.America nudged me with her elbow.Good thing I got you to go run errands with me today or you would have shown up looking like ass!You look great, Travis said, scanning my dress.Brazil hugged me, pressing his cheek to mine.And I hope you know Americas Brazil is Creepy story was just a line to get you in here.I looked at America and she laughed.It worked, didnt it?Once everyone took turns hugging me and wishing me a happy birthday, I leaned into Americas ear.Wheres Parker?Hell be here later, she whispered.Shepley couldnt get him on the phone to let him know until this afternoon.Brazil cranked up the volume on the stereo, and everyone screamed.Come here, Abby!he said, walking to the kitchen.He lined up shot glasses along the counter and pulled a bottle of tequila from the bar.Happy birthday from the football team, baby girl, he smiled, pouring each shot glass full of Petron.This is the way we do birthdays: You turn nineteen, you have nineteen shots.You can drink em or give em away, but the more you drink, the more of these you get, he said, fanning out a handful of twenties.Oh my God!I squealed.Drink em up, Pidge!Travis said.I looked to Brazil, suspicious.I get a twenty for every shot I drink?Thats right, lightweight.Gauging by the size of you, Im going to say well get away with losing sixty bucks by the end of the night.Think again, Brazil, I said, grabbing the first shot glass, rolling it across my lip, tipping my head back to empty the glass and then rolling it the rest of the way, dropping it into my other hand.Holy shit!Travis exclaimed.This is really a waste, Brazil.I said, wiping the corners of my mouth.You shoot Cuervo, not Petron.The smug smile on Brazils face faded, and he shook his head and shrugged.Get after it, then.Ive got the wallets of twelve football players that say you cant finish ten.I narrowed my eyes.Double or nothing says I can drink fifteen.Whoa!Shepley cried.Youre not allowed to hospitalize yourself on your birthday, Abby!She can do it, America said, staring at Brazil.Forty bucks a shot?Brazil said, looking unsure.Are you scared?I asked.Hell no!Ill give you twenty a shot, and when you make it to fifteen, Ill double your total.Thats how Kansans do birthdays, I said, popping back another shot.An hour and three shots later, I was in the living room dancing with Travis.The song was a rock ballad, and Travis mouthed the words to me as we danced.He dipped me at the end of the first chorus, and I let my arms fall behind me.He popped me back up, and I sighed.You cant do that when I start getting into the double digit shots, I giggled.Did I tell you how incredible you look tonight?I shook my head and hugged him, laying my head on his shoulder.He tightened his grip, and buried his face in my neck, making me forget about decisions or bracelets or my separate personalities; I was exactly where I wanted to be.When the music changed to a faster beat, the door opened.Parker!I said, running over to hug him.You made it!Sorry Im late, Abs, he said, pressing his lips against mine.Happy birthday.Thanks, I said, seeing Travis stare at us from the corner of my eye.Parker lifted my wrist.You wore it.I said I would.Wanna dance?He shook his head.UhI dont dance.Oh.Well, you wanna witness my sixth shot of Petron?I smiled, holding up my five twenties.I make double if I get to fifteen.Thats a bit dangerous, isnt it?I leaned into his ear.I am totally hustling them.Ive played this game with my dad since I was sixteen.Oh, he said, frowning with disapproval.You drank Tequila with your dad?I shrugged.It was his way of bonding.Parker seemed unimpressed as his eyes left mine, scanning the crowd.I cant stay long.Im leaving early for a hunting trip with my father.Its a good thing my party was tonight, or you wouldnt have made it tomorrow, I said, surprised to hear of his plans.He smiled and took my hand.I would have made it back in time.I pulled him to the counter, picked up another shot glass and killed it, slamming it on the counter upside down like I had the previous five.Brazil handed me another twenty, and I danced into the living room.Travis grabbed me, and we danced with America and Shepley.Shepley slapped me on the butt.One!America added a second swat on my backside, and then the entire party joined in, sans Parker.At number nineteen, Travis rubbed his hands together.My turn!I rubbed my sore posterior.Be easy!My ass hurts!With an evil smirk, he reared his hand far above his shoulder.I closed my eyes tight.After a few moments, I peeked back.Just before his hand made contact, he stopped and gave me a gentle pat.Nineteen!he exclaimed.The guests cheered, and America started a drunken rendition of Happy Birthday.I laughed when the part came to say my name and the entire room sang Pigeon.Another slow song came over the stereo, and Parker pulled me to the make shift dance floor.It didnt take me long to figure out why he didnt dance.Sorry, he said after stepping on my toes for the third time.I leaned my head on his shoulder.Youre doing just fine, I lied.He pressed his lips against my temple.What are you doing Monday night?Going to dinner with you?Yes.In my new apartment.You found one!He laughed and nodded.Well order in, though.My cooking isnt exactly edible.Id eat it, anyway, I smiled up at him.Parker glanced around the room and then led me to a hallway.He gently pressed me against the wall, kissing me with his soft lips.His hands were everywhere.At first I played along, but after his tongue infiltrated my lips, I got the distinct feeling that I was doing something wrong.Okay, Parker, I said, maneuvering away.Everything all right?I just think its rude of me to make out with you in a dark corner when I have guests out there.He smiled and kissed me again.Youre right, Im sorry.I just wanted to give you a memorable birthday kiss before I left.Youre leaving?He touched my cheek.I have to wake up in four hours, Abs.I pressed my lips together.Okay.Ill see you Monday?Youll see me tomorrow.Ill stop by when I get back.He led me to the door and then kissed my cheek before he left.I noticed that Shepley, America and Travis were all staring at me.Daddys gone!Travis yelled when the door closed.Time to get the party started!Everyone cheered, and Travis pulled me to the center of the floor.Hang onIm on a schedule, I said, leading him by the hand to the counter.I knocked back another shot, and laughed when Travis took one from the end, sucking it down.I grabbed another, and swallowed, and he did the same.Seven more, Abby, Brazil said, handing me two more twenty dollar bills.I wiped my mouth as Travis pulled me to the living room again.I danced with America, and then Shepley, but when Chris Jenks from the football team tried to dance with me, Travis pulled him back by the shirt and shook his head.Chris shrugged and turned, dancing with the first girl he saw.The tenth shot hit hard, and I felt a little dizzy standing on Brazils couch with America, dancing like clumsy grade schoolers.We giggled over nothing, waving our arms around to the beat.I stumbled, nearly falling off the couch backward, but Travis hands were instantly on my hips to steady me.Youve made your point, he said.Youve drank more than any girl weve ever seen.Im cutting you off.The hell you are, I slurred.I have six hundred bucks waiting on me at the bottom of that shot glass, and you of all people arent going to tell me I cant do something extreme for cash.If youre that hard up for money, Pidge.Im not borrowing money from you, I sneered.I was gonna suggest pawning that bracelet, he smiled.I smacked him on the arm just as America started the countdown to midnight.When the hands of the clock superimposed on the twelve, we all celebrated.I was nineteen.America and Shepley kissed each side of my cheek, and Travis lifted me off the ground, twirling me around.Happy birthday, Pigeon, he said with a soft expression.I stared into his warm, brown eyes for a moment, feeling lost inside of them.The room was frozen in time as we stared at each other, so close I could feel his breath on my skin.Shots!I said, stumbling to the counter.You look torn up, Abby.I think its time to call it a night, Brazil said.Im not a quitter, I said.I wanna see my money.Brazil placed a twenty under the last two glasses, and then he yelled at his teammates, Shes gonna drink em!I need fifteen!They all groaned and rolled their eyes, pulling out their wallets to form a stack of twenties behind the last shot glass.Travis had emptied the other four shots on the other side of my fifteen.I would have never believed that I could lose fifty bucks on a fifteen shot bet with a girl, Chris complained.Believe it, Jenks I said, picking up a glass in each hand.I knocked back each of the glasses and waited for the vomit rising in my throat to settle.Pigeon?Travis asked, taking a step in my direction.I raised a finger and Brazil smiled.Shes going to lose it, he said.No she wont, America shook her head.Deep breath, Abby.I closed my eyes and inhaled, picking up the last shot.Holy God, Abby!Youre going to die of alcohol poisoning!Shepley cried.Shes got this, America assured him.I tipped my head and let the tequila flow down my throat.My teeth and lips had been numb since shot number eight, and the kick of the eighty proof had long since lost its edge.The entire party erupted into whistles and yells as Brazil handed me the stack of money.Thank you, I said with pride, tucking the money away in my bra.You are incredibly sexy right now, Travis said in my ear as we walked to the living room.We danced into the morning, and the tequila running through my veins eased me into oblivion.When my eyes finally peeled open, I saw that my pillow consisted of denim and legs.Travis sat with his back against the tub, his head leaned against the wall, passed out cold.He looked as rough as I felt.I pulled the blanket off of me and stood up, gasping at my horrifying reflection in the mirror above the sink.I looked like death.Mascara smeared, black tear stains down my cheek, lipstick smudged across my mouth, and my hair had balls of rats on each side.Sheets, towels and blankets surrounded Travis.He had fashioned a soft pallet to sleep on while I expelled the fifteen shots of tequila Id consumed the night before.Travis had held my hair out of the toilet, and sat with me all night.I turned on the faucet, holding my hand under the water until it was the temperature I wanted.Scrubbing the mess from my face, I heard a moan from the floor.Travis stirred, rubbed his eyes and stretched, and then looked beside him, jerking in a panic.Im right here, I said.Why dont you go to bed?Get some sleep?You okay?he said, wiping his eyes once more.Yeah, Im good.Well, good as I can be.Ill feel better once I get a shower.He stood up.You took my crazy title last night, just so you know.I dont know where that came from, but I dont want you to do it again.Its pretty much what I grew up around, Trav.Not a big deal.He took my chin in his hands and wiped the remaining smeared mascara from under my eyes with his thumbs.It was a big deal to me.Fine, I wont do it again.Happy?Yes.But, I have something to tell you, if you promise not to freak out.Oh, God, what did I do?Nothing, but you need to call America.Where is she?At Morgan.She got into it with Shep last night.I rushed through my shower and yanked on the clothes Travis had set on the sink.When I emerged from the bathroom, Shepley and Travis were sitting in the living room.What did you do to her?I demanded.Shepleys face fell.Shes really pissed at me.What happened?I was mad that she encouraged you to drink so much.I thought we were going to end up taking you to the hospital.One thing led to another, and the next thing I know, were screaming at each other.We were both drunk, Abby.I said some things I cant take back, he shook his head, looking to the floor.Like what?I said, angry.I called her a few names Im not proud of and then told her to leave.You let her leave here drunk?Are you some kind of idiot?I said, grabbing at my purse.Easy, Pidge.He feels bad enough, Travis said.I fished my cell phone out of my purse, dialing Americas number.Hello?she answered.She sounded awful.I just heard, I sighed.Are you okay?I walke down the hall for privacy, glancing back once to shoot a dirty look at Shepley.Im fine.Hes an asshole.Her words were abrupt, but I could hear the hurt in her voice.America had mastered the art of hiding her emotions, and she could have hidden it from anyone but me.Im sorry I didnt go with you.You were out of it, Abby, she said dismissively.Why dont you come get me?We can talk about it.She breathed into the phone.I dont know.I dont really feel like seeing him.Ill tell him to stay inside, then.There was a long pause, and then I heard her keys clink in the background.All right.Ill be there in a minute.I walked into the living room, pulling my purse over my shoulder.They watched me open the door to wait for America, and Shepley scooted forward on the couch.Shes coming here?She doesnt want to see you, Shep.I told her youd stay inside.He sighed, and fell against the cushion.She hates me.Ill talk to her.You better get one amazing apology together, though.Ten minutes later, a car horn beeped twice outside, and I closed the door behind me.When I reached the bottom of the stairs, Shepley rushed past me to Americas red Honda, and hunched over to see her through the window.I stopped in my tracks, watching America snub him as she looked straight ahead.She rolled down her window, and Shepley seemed to be explaining, and then they began to argue.I went inside to give them their privacy.Pigeon?Travis said, trotting down the stairs.It doesnt look good.Let them figure it out.Come inside, he said, intertwining his fingers in mine to lead me up the stairs.Was it that bad?I asked.He nodded.It was pretty bad.Theyre just getting out of the honeymoon stage, though.Theyll work it out.For someone thats never had a girlfriend, you seem to know about relationships.I have four brothers and a lot of friends, he said, grinning to himself.Shepley stomped into the apartment and slammed the door behind him.Shes fucking impossible!I kissed Travis on the cheek.Thats my cue.Good luck, Travis smiled.I slid in beside America, and she huffed.Hes fucking impossible!I giggled, but she shot a glare in my direction.Sorry, I said, forcing my smile to fade.We set out for a drive and America yelled, and cried, and yelled some more.At times she broke into rants that seemed to be directed at Shepley, as if he were sitting in my place.I sat quietly, letting her work it out in a way only America can.He called me irresponsible!Me!As if I dont know you!As if I havent seen you rob your dad of hundreds of dollars drinking twice as much.He doesnt know what the hell hes talking about!He doesnt know what your life was like!He doesnt know what I know, and he acts like Im his child instead of his girlfriend!I rested my hand on hers, but she pulled it away.He thought you would be the reason we wouldnt work out, and then he ended up doing the job on his own.And speaking of you, what the hell was that last night with Parker?The sudden change of topic took me by surprise.What do you mean?Travis threw you that party, Abby, and you go off and make out with Parker.And you wonder why everyone is talking about you!Hold on a minute!I told Parker we shouldnt be back there.What does it matter if Travis threw me that party or not?Im not with him!America looked straight ahead, blowing a puff of air from her nose.All right, Mare.What is it?Youre mad at me, now?Im not mad at you.I just dont associate with complete idiots.I shook my head, and then looked out the window before I said something I couldnt take back..America had always been able to make me feel like shit on command.Do you even see whats going on?she asked.Travis quit fighting.He doesnt go out without you.He hasnt brought any girls home since the bimbo twinshas yet to murder Parker, and youre worried about what people are saying.You know why that is, Abby?Because its the truth!I turned, slowly craning my neck in her direction, trying to give her the dirtiest look I knew how.What the hell is wrong with you?Youre dating Parker, now, and youre so happy, she said in a mocking tone.Then why arent you at Morgan?Because I lost the bet, you know that!Give me a break, Abby!You talk about how perfect Parker is, you go on these amazing dates with him, talk to him for hours on the phone, and then you lay next to Travis every night.Do you see whats wrong with this situation?If you really liked Parker, your stuff would be at Morgan right now.I clenched my teeth.You know Ive never welched on a bet, Mare.Thats what I thought, she said, twisting her hands around the steering wheel.Travis is what you want, and Parker is what you think you need.I know it looks that way, but,  It looks that way to everyone.So if you dont like the way people are talking about you  change.Its not Travis fault.Hes done a one eighty for you.Youre reaping the rewards, and Parkers getting the benefits.A week ago you wanted to pack me up and never let Travis come near me again!Now youre defending him?Abigail!Im not defending him, Stupid!Im looking out for you!Youre both crazy about each other!Do something about it!How could you possibly think I should be with him?I wailed.You are supposed to be keeping me away from people like him!She pressed her lips together, clearly losing her patience.You have worked so hard to separate yourself from your father.Thats the only reason youre even considering Parker!Hes the complete opposite of Mick, and you think Travis is going to land you right back where you were.Hes not like your dad, Abby.I didnt say he was, but its putting me in a prime position to follow in his footsteps.Travis wouldnt do that to you.I think you underestimate just how much you mean to him.If youd just tell him,  No.We didnt leave everything behind to have everyone here look at me the way they did in Wichita.Lets focus on the problem at hand.Shep is waiting for you.I dont want to talk about Shep, she said, slowing to a stop at the light.Hes miserable, Mare.He loves you.Her eyes filled with tears and her bottom lip quivered.I dont care.Yes you do.I know, she whimpered, leaning against my shoulder.She cried until the light changed, and then I kissed her head.Green light.She sat up, wiping her nose.I was pretty mean to him earlier.I dont think hell talk to me now.Hell talk to you.He knew you were mad.America wiped her face, and then made a slow u turn.I was worried it would take a lot of coaxing on my part to get her to come in with me, but Shepley ran down the stairs before she turned off the ignition.He yanked open her car door, pulling her to her feet.Im so sorry, Baby.I should have minded my own business, Iplease dont leave.I dont know what Id do without you.America took his face in her hands and smiled.Youre an arrogant ass, but I still love you.Shepley kissed her over and over like he hadnt seen her in months, and I smiled at a job well done.Travis stood in the doorway, grinning as I made my way into the apartment.And they lived happily ever after, Travis said, shutting the door behind me.I collapsed on the couch, and he sat next to me, pulling my legs onto his lap.What do you wanna do today, Pidge?Sleep.Or restor sleep.Can I give you your present, first?I pushed his shoulder.Shut up.You got me a present?His mouth curved into a nervous smile.Its not a diamond bracelet, but I thought youd like it.Ill love it, sight unseen.He lifted my legs off of his lap, and then disappeared into Shepleys bedroom.I raised an eyebrow when I heard him murmuring, and then he emerged with a box.He sat it on the floor at my feet, crouching behind it.Hurry, I want you to be surprised, he smiled.Hurry?I asked, lifting the lid.My mouth fell open when a pair of big, dark eyes looked up at me.A puppy?I shrieked, reaching into the box.I lifted the dark, wiry haired baby to my face, and it covered my mouth in warm, wet kisses.Travis beamed, triumphant.You like him?Him?I love him!You got me a puppy!Its a Cairn Terrier.I had to drive three hours to pick him up Thursday after class.So when you said you were going with Shepley to take his car to the shop.We went to get your present, he nodded.Hes wiggly!I laughed.Every girl from Kansas needs a Toto, Travis said, helping me hang on to the tiny fuzz ball in my lap.He does look like Toto!Thats what Im going to call him, I said, wrinkling my nose at the squirmy pup.You can keep him here.Ill take care of him for you when youre back at Morgan, his mouth pulled up into a half smile, and its my security that youll visit when your month is up.I pressed my lips together.I would have come back, anyway, Trav.Id do anything for that smile thats on your face right now.I think you need a nap, Toto.Yes, you do, I cooed to the puppy.Travis nodded, pulled me onto his lap, and then stood up.Come on, then.He carried me into his bedroom, pulled back the covers, and then lowered me to the mattress.Crawling over me, he reached over to pull the curtains closed, and then fell onto his pillow.Thanks for staying with me last night, I said, stroking Totos soft fur.You didnt have to sleep on the bathroom floor.Last night was one of the best nights of my life.I turned to see his expression.When I saw that he was serious, I shot him a dubious look.Sleeping in between the toilet and the tub on a cold, hard tile floor with a vomiting idiot was one of your best nights?Thats sad, Trav.No, sitting up with you when youre sick, and you falling asleep in my lap was one of my best nights.It wasnt comfortable, I didnt sleep worth a shit, but I brought in your nineteenth birthday with you, and youre actually pretty sweet when youre drunk.Im sure between the heaving and purging I was very charming.He pulled me close, patting Toto who was snuggled up to my neck.Youre the only woman I know that still looks incredible with your head in the toilet.Thats saying something.Thanks, Trav.I wont make you babysit me again.He leaned against his pillow.Whatever.No one can hold your hair back like I can.I giggled and closed my eyes, letting myself sink into the darkness.Get up, Abby!America yelled, shaking me.Toto licked my cheek.Im up!Im up!We have class in half an hour!I jumped from the bed.Ive been asleep forfourteen hours?What the hell?Just get in the shower!If youre not ready in ten minutes, Im leaving your ass here!I dont have time to take a shower!I said, changing out of the clothes I fell asleep in.Travis propped his head on his hand and chuckled.You girls are ridiculous.Its not the end of the world if youre late for one class.It is if youre America.She doesnt miss and she hates being late, I said, pulling a shirt over my head, and stepping into my jeans.Let Mare go ahead.Ill take you.I hopped on one foot, and then the other, pulling my boots on.My bag is in her car, Trav.Whatever, he shrugged, just dont hurt yourself getting to class.He lifted Toto, cradling him with one arm like a tiny football, taking him down the hall.America rushed me out the door and into the car.I cant believe he got you that puppy, she said, looking behind her as she backed out from the parking spot.Travis stood in the morning sun, in his boxers and bare feet, clutching his arms around him from the cold.He watched Toto sniff a small patch of grass, coaxing him like a proud father.Ive never had a dog before, I said.This should be interesting.America glanced at Travis before shoving the Honda into gear.Look at him, she said, shaking her head.Travis Maddox: Mr.Mom.Toto is adorable.Even you will be putty in his paws.You cant take it back to the dorm with you, you know.I dont think Travis thought this out.Travis said hed keep him at the apartment.She raised one eyebrow.Of course he will.Travis thinks ahead, Ill give him that, she said, shaking her head as she slammed on the gas.I puffed, sliding into my seat with one minute to spare.Once the adrenaline absorbed into my system, the heaviness from my post birthday coma settled over my body.America elbowed me when class was dismissed, and I followed her to the cafeteria.Shepley met us at the door, and I noticed right away that something was wrong.Mare, Shepley said, grabbing her arm.Travis jogged to where we stood, and grabbed his hips, puffing until he caught his breath.Is there a mob of angry women chasing you?I teased.He shook his head.I was trying to catch youbefore youwent in, he breathed.Whats going on?America asked Shepley.Theres a rumor, Shepley began.Everyones saying that Travis took Abby home andthe details are different, but its pretty bad.What?Are you serious?I cried.America rolled her eyes.Who cares, Abby?People have been speculating about you and Trav for weeks.Its not the first time someone has accused you two of sleeping together.Travis and Shepley traded glances.What?I said.Theres something else, isnt there?Shepley winced.Theyre saying you slept with Parker at Brazils, and then you let Travistake you home, if you know what I mean.My mouth fell open.Great!So Im the school slut now?Travis eyes darkened and his jaws tensed.This is my fault.If it was anyone else, they wouldnt be saying that about you.He walked into the cafeteria, his hands in fists at his sides.America and Shepley followed behind him.Lets just hope no one is stupid enough to say anything to him, America said.Or her, Shepley added.Travis sat a few seats across and down from me, brooding over his Reuben.I waited for him to look at me, wanting to offer a comforting smile.Travis had a reputation, but I let Parker take me into the hall.Shepley elbowed me while I stared at his cousin.He just feels bad.Hes probably trying to deflect the rumor.You dont have to sit down there, Trav.Come on, come sit, I said, patting the empty surface in front of me.I heard you had quite a birthday, Abby, Chris Jenks said, throwing a piece of lettuce on Travis plate.Dont start with her, Jenks, Travis warned, glowering.Chris smiled, pushing up his round, pink cheeks.I heard Parker is furious.He said he came by your apartment yesterday, and you and Travis were still in bed.They were taking a nap, Chris, America sneered.My eyes darted to Travis.Parker came by?He shifted uncomfortably in his chair.I was gonna tell you.When?I snapped.America leaned into my ear.Parker heard the rumor, and came by to confront you.I tried to stop him, but he walked down the hall andtotally got the wrong idea.I planted my elbows on the table, covering my face with my hands.This just keeps getting better.So you guys really didnt do the deed?Chris asked.Damn, that sucks.Here I thought Abby was right for you after all, Trav.You better stop, now, Chris, Shepley warned.If you didnt sleep with her, mind if I take a shot?Chris said, chuckling to his teammates.My face burned with the initial embarrassment, but then America screamed in my ear, reacting to Travis jumping from his seat.He reached over the table, grabbed Chris by the throat with one hand, and a fist full of t shirt in the other.The linebacker slid across the table, and dozens of chairs grated across the floor as people stood to watch.Travis punching him repeatedly in the face, his elbow spiking high in the air before he landed each blow.The only thing Chris could do was to cover his face with his hands.No one touched Travis.He was out of control, and his reputation left every one afraid to get in his way.The football players ducked and winced as they watched their teammate being assaulted without mercy on the tile floor.Travis!I screamed, running around the table.In mid punch, Travis withheld his fist, and then released Chris shirt, letting him fall to the floor.He was panting when he turned to look at me; Id never seen him look so frightening.I swallowed.and took a step back as he shouldered past me.I took a step to follow him, but America grabbed my arm.Shepley kissed her quickly, and then followed his cousin out the door.Jesus, America whispered.We turned to watch Chris teammates pick him off the floor, and I cringed at his red and puffy face.Blood trickled from his nose, and Brazil handed him a napkin from the table.That crazy son  of  a  bitch!Chris groaned, sitting on the chair and holding his hand to his face.He looked at me, then.Im sorry, Abby.I was just kidding.I had no words to reply.I couldnt explain what had just happened anymore than he could.She didnt sleep with either of them, America said.You never know when to shut up, Jenks, Brazil said, disgusted.America pulled on my arm.Cmon.Lets go.She didnt waste time tugging me to her car.When she put the gear in drive, I grabbed her wrist.Wait!Where are we going?Were going to Sheps.I dont want him to be alone with Travis.Did you see him?Dudes gone off the deep end!Well, I dont want to be around him, either!America stared at me in disbelief.Theres obviously something going on with him.Dont you want to know what it is?My sense of self preservation is outweighing my curiosity at this point, Mare.The only thing that stopped him was your voice, Abby.Hell listen to you.You need to talk to him.I sighed and released her wrist, falling against the back of my seat.All right.Lets go.We pulled into the parking lot, and America slowed to a stop between Shepleys Charger and Travis Harley.She walked to the stairs, putting her hands on her hips with a touch of her own dramatic flare.Cmon, Abby!America called, motioning for me to follow.Hesitant, I finally followed, stopping when I saw Shepley hurry down the stairs to speak quietly in Americas ear.He looked at me, shook his head, and then whispered to her once again..What?I asked.Shep doesnt, she fidgeted, Shep doesnt think its a good idea that we go in.Travis is still pretty mad.You mean he doesnt think I should go in, I said.America shrugged sheepishly, and then looked to Shepley.Shepley touched my shoulder.You didnt do anything wrong, Abby.He just doesnthe doesnt want to see you right now.If I didnt do anything wrong, then why doesnt he want to see me?Im not sure; he wont talk to me about it.I think hes embarrassed that he lost his temper in front of you.He lost his temper in front of the entire cafeteria!What do I have to do with it?More than you think, Shepley said, dodging my eyes.I watched them for a moment, and then pushed past them, running up the stairs.I burst through the doors to find an empty living room.The door to Travis room was closed, so I knocked.Travis?Its me, open up.Walk away, Pidge, he called from the other side of the door.I peeked in to see him sitting on the edge of his bed, facing the window.Toto pawed at his back, unhappy about being ignored.What is going on with you, Trav?I asked.He didnt answer, so I stood beside him, crossing my arms.His jaw was tensed, but it was no longer the frightening expression he had in the cafeteria.He seemed sad.The deep, hopeless kind.Youre not going to talk to me about this?I waited, but he remained quiet.I turned for the door and he finally sighed.You know the other day when Brazil mouthed off to me and you rushed to my defense?Wellthats what happened.I just got a little carried away.You were angry before Chris said anything, I said, returning to sit beside him on the bed.He continued to stare out the window.I meant what I said before.You need to walk away, Pidge.God knows I cant walk away from you.I touched his arm.You dont want me to leave.Travis jaws tensed again, and then he took me under his arm.He paused for a moment, and then kissed my forehead, pressing his cheek against my temple.It doesnt matter how hard I try.Youre going to hate me when its all said and done.I wrapped my arms around him.We have to be friends.I wont take no for an answer, I quoted.His eyebrows pulled in, and then he cradled me to him with both arms, still staring out the window.I watch you sleeping a lot.You always look so peaceful.I dont have that kind of quiet.I have all this anger and rage boiling inside of me  except when I watch you sleep.Thats what I was doing when Parker walked in, he continued.I was awake, and he walked in, and just stood there with this shocked look on his face.I knew what he thought, but I didnt set him straight.I didnt explain because I wanted him to think something happened.Now the whole school thinks you were with us both in the same night.Toto nuzzled his way onto my lap, and I rubbed his ears.Travis reached over to pet him once, and then rested his hand on mine.Im sorry.I shrugged.If he believes the gossip, its his own fault.Its hard to think anything else when he sees us in bed together.He knows Im staying with you.I was fully clothed for Christs sake.Travis sighed.He was probably too pissed to notice.I know you like him, Pidge.I should have explained.I owe you that much.It doesnt matter.Youre not mad?he asked, surprised.Is that what youre so upset about?You thought Id be mad at you when you told me the truth?You should be.If someone single handedly sunk my reputation, Id be a little pissed.You dont care about reputations.What happened to the Travis that doesnt give a shit what anyone thinks?I teased, nudging him.That was before I saw the look on your face when you heard what everyones saying.I dont want you to get hurt because of me.You would never do anything to hurt me.Id rather cut off my arm, he sighed.He relaxed his cheek against my hair.I didnt have a reply, and Travis seemed to have said everything he needed to, so we sat in silence.Once in awhile, Travis would squeeze me tighter to his side.I gripped his shirt, not knowing how else to make him feel better other than to just let him hold me.When the sun began to set, I heard a faint knock at the door.Abby?Americas voice sounded small on the other side of the wood.Come in, Mare, Travis answered.America walked in with Shepley, and she smiled at the site of us tangled in each others arms.We were going to grab a bite to eat.You two feel like making a Pei Wei run?AghAsian again, Mare?Really?Travis asked.I smiled.He sounded like himself again.America noticed as well.Yes, really.You guys coming or not?Im starving, I said.Of course you are, you didnt get to eat lunch, he said, frowning.He stood up, bringing me with him.Come on.Lets get you some food.He kept his arm around me, and didnt let go until we were in the booth of Pei Wei.As soon as Travis left for the bathroom, America leaned in.So?What did he say?Nothing, I shrugged.She raised an eyebrow.You were in his room for two hours.He didnt say anything?He usually doesnt when hes that mad, Shepley said.He had to have said something, America prodded.He said he got a little carried away taking up for me, and that he didnt tell Parker the truth when he walked in.Thats it, I said, straightening the salt and pepper.Shepley shook his head, closing his eyes.What, Baby?America asked, sitting taller.Travis is, he sighed, rolling his eyes.Forget it.America wore a stubborn expression.Oh, hell no, you cant just,  She cut off when Travis sat down and swung his arm behind me.Damn it!The foods not here yet?We laughed and joked until the restaurant closed, and then filed into the car for the ride home.Shepley carried America up the stairs on his back, but Travis stayed behind, tugging on my arm to keep me from following.He looked up at our friends until they disappeared behind the door, and then offered a regretful smile.I owe you an apology for today, so Im sorry.Youve already apologized.Its fine.No, I apologized for Parker.I dont want you thinking Im some psycho that goes around attacking people over the tiniest thing, he said, but I owe you an apology because I didnt defend you for the right reason.And that would be.I prompted.I lunged at him because he said he wanted to be next in line, not because he was teasing you.Insinuating there is a line is plenty reason for you to defend me, Trav.Thats my point.I was pissed because I took that as him wanting to sleep with you.After processing what Travis meant, I grabbed the sides of his shirt and pressed my forehead against his chest.You know what?I dont care, I said, looking up at him.I dont care what people are saying, or that you lost your temper, or why you messed up Chris face.The last thing I want is a bad reputation, but Im tired of explaining our friendship to everyone.To hell with em.Travis eyes turned soft, and the corners of his mouth turned up.Our friendship?Sometimes I wonder if you listen to me at all.What do you mean?Lets go in.Im tired.I nodded, and he held me against his side until we were inside the apartment.America and Shepley had already shut themselves in their bedroom, and I slipped in and out of the shower.Travis sat with Toto outside while I dressed in my pajamas, and within half an hour, we were both in bed.I rested my head on my arm, breathing out a long, relaxing puff of air.Just two weeks left.What are you going to do for drama when I move back to Morgan?I dont know, he said.I could see his tormented frown, even in the darkness.Hey, I touched his arm.I was kidding.I watched him for a long time, breathing, blinking, and trying to relax.He fidgeted a bit and then looked over at me.Do you trust me, Pidge?Yeah, why?Cmere, he said, pulling me against him.I stiffened for a second or two before resting my head on his chest.Whatever was going on with him, he needed me near him, and I couldnt have objected even if Id wanted to.It felt right lying next to him.Finch shook his head.Okay, so youre with Parker, or with Travis?Im confused.Parkers not talking to me, so thats sort of up in the air right now, I said, bouncing to readjust my backpack.He blew out a puff of smoke, and then picked a piece of tobacco from his tongue.So are you with Travis?Were friends, Finch.You realize everyone thinks you two are having some sort of freaky friends with benefits thing going on that youre not admitting to, right?I dont care.They can think what they want.Since when?What happened to the nervous, mysterious, guarded Abby I know and love?She died from the stress of all the rumors and assumptions.Thats too bad.Im going to miss pointing and laughing at her.I smacked Finchs arm, and he laughed.Good.Its about time you quit pretending, he said.What do you mean?Honey, youre talking to someones whos lived most of his life pretending.I spotted you a mile away.What are you trying to say, Finch?That Im closet lesbian?No, that youre hiding something.The cardigans, the demure sophisticate that goes to fancy restaurants with Parker Hayesthats not you.Either you were a small town stripper or youve been to rehab.The latters my guess.I laughed out loud.You are a terrible guesser!So whats your secret?If I told you, it wouldnt be a secret, now would it?His features sharpened with an impish grin.Ive shown you mine, now show me yours.I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your sexual orientation isnt exactly a secret, Finch.Fuck!And I thought I had the mysterious sex kitten thing going for me, he said, taking another drag.I cringed before I spoke.Did you have a good home life, Finch?My moms greatmy dad and I had a lot of issues to work out, but were good, now.I had Mick Abernathy for a father.Whos that?I giggled.See?Its not a big deal if you dont know who he is.Who is he?A mess.The gambling, the drinking, the bad temperits hereditary in my family.America and I came here so I could start fresh, without the stigma of being the daughter of a drunken has been.A gambling has been from Wichita?I was born in Nevada.Everything Mick touched turned to gold back then.When I turned thirteen, his luck changed.And he blamed you.America gave up a lot to come here with me so I could get away, but I get here and walk face first into Travis.And when you look at Travis,  Its all too familiar.Finch nodded, flicking his cigarette to the ground.Shit, Abby.That sucks.I narrowed my eyes.If you tell anyone what I just told you, Ill call The Mob.I know some of them, you know.Bullshit.I shrugged.Believe what you want.Finch eyed me suspiciously, and then smiled.You are officially the coolest person I know.Thats sad, Finch.You should get out more, I said, stopping at the cafeteria entrance.He pulled my chin up.Itll all work out.Im a firm believer in the whole things happening for a reason adage.You came here, America met Shep, you found your way to The Circle, something about you turned Travis Maddoxs world upside down.Think about it, he said, planting a quick kiss on my lips.Hey now!Travis said.He grabbed me by the waist, lifted me off my feet, returning me to the ground behind him.Youre the last person Id have to worry about that shit from, Finch!
