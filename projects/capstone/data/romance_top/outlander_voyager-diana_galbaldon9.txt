I glanced at Jamie.Not you.His head was bent over a second orange, hands moving swiftly as he scored it with his dirk, but I could see the faint smile in the corner of his mouth.No, Sassenach, ye dinna frighten me.Or rather ye do, but only when I think ye may kill yourself from carelessness.I snorted briefly.You scare me, for the same reason, but I dont suppose theres anything I can do about it.His chuckle was deep and easy.And ye think I canna do anything about it, either, so I shouldna be worrit?I didnt say you shouldnt worrydo you think I dont worry?But no, you probably cant do anything about me.I saw him opening his mouth to disagree.Then he changed his mind, and laughed again.He reached out and popped an orange segment into my mouth.Well, maybe no, Sassenach, and maybe so.But Ive lived a long enough time now to think it maybe doesna matter so muchso long as I can love you.Speechless with orange juice, I stared at him in surprise.And I do, he said softly.He leaned into the berth and kissed me, his mouth warm and sweet.Then he drew back, and gently touched my cheek.Rest now, he said firmly.Ill bring ye some broth, in a bit.I slept for several hours, and woke up still feverish, but hungry.Jamie brought me some of Murphys brotha rich green concoction, swimming in butter and reeking with sherryand insisted, despite my protests, on feeding it to me with a spoon.I have a perfectly good hand, I said crossly.Aye, and Ive seen ye use it, too, he replied, deftly gagging me with the spoon.If yere clumsy with a spoon as wi that needle, youll have this all spilt down your bosom and wasted, and Murphy will brain me wi the ladle.Here, open up.I did, my resentment gradually melting into a sort of warm and glowing stupor as I ate.I hadnt taken anything for the pain in my arm, but as my empty stomach expanded in grateful relief, I more or less quit noticing it.Will ye have another bowl?Jamie asked, as I swallowed the last spoonful.Yell need your strength kept up.Not waiting for an answer, he uncovered the small tureen Murphy had sent, and refilled the bowl.Wheres Ishmael?I asked, during the brief hiatus.On the after deck.He didna seem comfortable belowdecksand I canna say I blame him, having seen the slavers at Bridgetown.I had Maitland sling him a hammock.Do you think its safe to leave him loose like that?What kind of soup is this?The last spoonful had left a delightful, lingering taste on my tongue; the next revived the full flavor.Turtle; Stern took a big hawksbill last night.He sent word hes saving ye the shell to make combs of, for your hair.Jamie frowned slightly, whether at the thought of Lawrence Sterns gallantry or Ishmaels presence, I couldnt tell.As for the black, hes not looseFergus is watching him.Fergus is on his honeymoon, I protested.You shouldnt make him do it.Is this really turtle soup?Ive never had it before.Its marvelous.Jamie was unmoved by contemplation of Ferguss tender state.Aye, well, hell be wed a long time, he said callously.Do him no harm to keep his breeches on for one night.And they do say that abstinence makes the heart grow firmer, no?Absence, I said, dodging the spoon for a moment.And fonder.If anythings growing firmer from abstinence, it wouldnt be his heart.Thats verra bawdy talk for a respectable marrit woman, Jamie said reprovingly, sticking the spoon in my mouth.And inconsiderate, forbye.I swallowed.Inconsiderate?Im a wee bit firm myself at the moment, he replied evenly, dipping and spooning.What wi you sitting there wi your hair loose and your nipples starin me in the eye, the size of cherries.I glanced down involuntarily, and the next spoonful bumped my nose.Jamie clicked his tongue, and picking up a cloth, briskly blotted my bosom with it.It was quite true that my shift was made of thin cotton, and even when dry, reasonably easy to see through.Its not as though you havent seen them before, I said, amused.He laid down the cloth and raised his brows.I have drunk water every day since I was weaned, he pointed out.It doesna mean I canna be thirsty, still.He picked up the spoon.Youll have a wee bit more?No, thanks, I said, dodging the oncoming spoon.I want to hear more about this firmness of yours.No, ye dont; youre ill.I feel much better, I assured him.Shall I have a look at it?He was wearing the loose petticoat breeches the sailors wore, in which he could easily have concealed three or four dead mullet, let alone a fugitive firmness.You shall not, he said, looking slightly shocked.Someone might come in.And I canna think your looking at it would help a bit.Well, you cant tell that until I have looked at it, can you?I said.Besides, you can bolt the door.Bolt the door?What dye think Im going to do?Do I look the sort of man would take advantage of a woman whos not only wounded and boiling wi fever, but drunk as well?he demanded.He stood up, nonetheless.I am not drunk, I said indignantly.You cant get drunk on turtle soup!Nonetheless, I was conscious that the glowing warmth in my stomach seemed to have migrated somewhat lower, taking up residence between my thighs, and there was undeniably a slight lightness of head not strictly attributable to fever.You can if yeve been drinking turtle soup as made by Aloysius OShaughnessy Murphy, he said.By the smell of it, hes put at least a full bottle o the sherry in it.A verra intemperate race, the Irish.Well, Im still not drunk.I straightened up against the pillows as best I could.You told me once that if you could still stand up, you werent drunk.You arent standing up, he pointed out.You are.And I could if I wanted to.Stop trying to change the subject.We were talking about your firmness.Well, ye can just stop talking about it, because He broke off with a small yelp, as I made a fortunate grab with my left hand.Clumsy, am I?I said, with considerable satisfaction.Oh, my.Heavens, you do have a problem, dont you?Will ye leave go of me?he hissed, looking frantically over his shoulder at the door.Someone could come in any moment!I told you you should have bolted the door, I said, not letting go.Far from being a dead mullet, the object in my hand was exhibiting considerable liveliness.He eyed me narrowly, breathing through his nose.I wouldna use force on a sick woman, he said through his teeth, but youve a damn healthy grip for someone with a fever, Sassenach.If you  I told you I felt better, I interrupted, but Ill make you a bargain; you bolt the door and Ill prove Im not drunk.I rather regretfully let go, to indicate good faith.He stood staring at me for a moment, absentmindedly rubbing the site of my recent assault on his virtue.Then he lifted one ruddy eyebrow, turned, and went to bolt the door.By the time he turned back, I had made it out of the berth and was standinga trifle shakily, but still uprightagainst the frame.He eyed me critically.Its no going to work, Sassenach, he said, shaking his head.He looked rather regretful, himself.Well never stay upright, wi a swell like there is underfoot tonight, and ye know Ill not fit in that berth by myself, let alone wi you.There was a considerable swell; the lantern on its swivel bracket hung steady and level, but the shelf above it tilted visibly back and forth as the Artemis rode the waves.I could feel the faint shudder of the boards under my bare feet, and knew Jamie was right.At least he was too absorbed in the discussion to be seasick.Theres always the floor, I suggested hopefully.He glanced down at the limited floor space and frowned.Aye, well.There is, but wed have to do it like snakes, Sassenach, all twined round each other amongst the table legs.I dont mind.No, he said, shaking his head, it would hurt your arm.He rubbed a knuckle across his lower lip, thinking.His eyes passed absently across my body at about hip level, returned, fixed, and lost their focus.I thought the bloody shift must be more transparent than I realized.Deciding to take matters into my own hands, I let go my hold on the frame of the berth and lurched the two paces necessary to reach him.The roll of the ship threw me into his arms, and he barely managed to keep his own balance, clutching me tightly round the waist.Jesus!he said, staggered, and then, as much from reflex as from desire, bent his head and kissed me.It was startling.I was accustomed to be surrounded by the warmth of his embrace; now it was I who was hot to the touch and he who was cool.From his reaction, he was enjoying the novelty as much as I was.Light headed, and reckless with it, I nipped the side of his neck with my teeth, feeling the waves of heat from my face pulsate against the column of his throat.He felt it, too.God, youre like holding a hot coal!His hands dropped lower and pressed me hard against him.Firm is it?Ha, I said, getting my mouth free for a moment.Take those baggy things off.I slid down his length and onto my knees in front of him, fumbling mazily at his flies.He freed the laces with a quick jerk, and the petticoat breeches ballooned to the floor with a whiff of wind.I didnt wait for him to remove his shirt; just lifted it and took him.He made a strangled sound and his hands came down on my head as though he wanted to restrain me, but hadnt the strength.Oh, Lord!he said.His hands tightened in my hair, but he wasnt trying to push me away.This must be what its like to make love in Hell, he whispered.With a burning she devil.I laughed, which was extremely difficult under the circumstances.I choked, and pulled back a moment, breathless.Is this what a succubus does, do you think?I wouldna doubt it for a moment, he assured me.His hands were still in my hair, urging me back.A knock sounded on the door, and he froze.Confident that the door was indeed bolted, I didnt.Aye?What is it?he said, with a calmness rather remarkable for a man in his position.Fraser?Lawrence Sterns voice came through the door.The Frenchman says the black is asleep, and may he have leave to go to bed now?No, said Jamie shortly.Tell him to stay where he is; Ill come along and relieve him in a bit.Oh.Sterns voice sounded a little hesitant.Surely.Hisum, his wife seemseager for him to come now.Jamie inhaled sharply.Tell her, he said, a small note of strain becoming evident in his voice, that hell be therepresently.I will say so.Stern sounded dubious about Marsalis reception of this news, but then his voice brightened.Ahis Mrs.Fraser feeling somewhat improved?Verra much, said Jamie, with feeling.She enjoyed the turtle soup?Greatly.I thank ye.His hands on my head were trembling.Did you tell her that Ive put aside the shell for her?It was a fine hawksbill turtle; a most elegant beast.Aye.Aye, I did.With an audible gasp, Jamie pulled away and reaching down, lifted me to my feet.Good night, Mr.Stern!he called.He pulled me toward the berth; we struggled four legged to keep from crashing into tables and chairs as the floor rose and fell beneath us.Oh.Lawrence sounded faintly disappointed.I suppose Mrs.Fraser is asleep, then?Laugh, and Ill throttle ye, Jamie whispered fiercely in my ear.She is, Mr.Stern, he called through the door.I shall give her your respects in the morning, aye?I trust she will rest well.There seems to be a certain roughness to the sea this evening.Ihave noticed, Mr.Stern.Pushing me to my knees in front of the berth, he knelt behind me, groping for the hem of my shift.A cool breeze from the open stern window blew over my naked buttocks, and a shiver ran down the backs of my thighs.Should you or Mrs.Fraser find yourselves discommoded by the motion, I have a most capital remedy to handa compound of mugwort, bat dung, and the fruit of the mangrove.You have only to ask, you know.Jamie didnt answer for a moment.Oh, Christ!he whispered.I took a sizable bite of the bedclothes.Mr.Fraser?I said, Thank you!Jamie replied, raising his voice.Well, I shall bid you a good evening, then.Jamie let out his breath in a long shudder that was not quite a moan.Mr.Fraser?Good evening, Mr.Stern!Jamie bellowed.Oh!Ergood evening.Sterns footsteps receded down the companionway, lost in the sound of the waves that were now crashing loudly against the hull.I spit out the mouthful of quilt.OhmyGod!His hands were large and hard and cool on my heated flesh.Youve the roundest arse Ive ever seen!A lurch by the Artemis here aiding his efforts to an untoward degree, I uttered a loud shriek.Shh!He clasped a hand over my mouth, bending over me so that he lay over my back, the billowing linen of his shirt falling around me and the weight of him pressing me to the bed.My skin, crazed with fever, was sensitive to the slightest touch, and I shook in his arms, the heat inside me rushing outward as he moved within me.His hands were under me then, clutching my breasts, the only anchor as I lost my boundaries and dissolved, conscious thought a displaced element in the chaos of sensationsthe warm damp of tangled quilts beneath me, the cold sea wind and misty spray that wafted over us from the rough sea outside, the gasp and brush of Jamies warm breath on the back of my neck, and the sudden prickle and flood of cold and heat, as my fever broke in a dew of satisfied desire.Jamies weight rested on my back, his thighs behind mine.It was warm, and comforting.After a long time, his breathing eased, and he rose off me.The thin cotton of my shift was damp, and the wind plucked it away from my skin, making me shiver.Jamie closed the window with a snap, then bent and picked me up like a rag doll.He lowered me into the berth, and pulled the quilt up over me.How is your arm?he said.What arm?I murmured drowsily.I felt as though I had been melted and poured into a mold to set.Good, he said, a smile in his voice.Can ye stand up?Not for all the tea in China.Ill tell Murphy ye liked the soup.His hand rested for a moment on my cool forehead, passed down the curve of my cheek in a light caress, and then was gone.I didnt hear him leave.57  PROMISED LAND  Its persecution!Jamie said indignantly.He stood behind me, looking over the rail of the Artemis.Kingston Harbor stretched to our left, glowing like liquid sapphires in the morning light, the town above half sunk in jungle green, cubes of yellowed ivory and pink rose quartz in a lush setting of emerald and malachite.And on the cerulean bosom of the water below floated the majestic sight of a great three masted ship, furled canvas white as gull wings, gun decks proud and brass gleaming in the sun.His Majestys man of war Porpoise.The filthy boats pursuing me, he said, glaring at it as we sailed past at a discreet distance, well outside the harbor mouth.Everywhere I go, there it is again!I laughed, though in truth, the sight of the Porpoise made me slightly nervous, too.I dont suppose its personal, I told him.Captain Leonard did say they were bound for Jamaica.Aye, but why would they no head straight to Antigua, where the naval barracks and the navy shipyards are, and them in such straits as ye left them?He shaded his eyes, peering at the Porpoise.Even at this distance, small figures were visible in the rigging, making repairs.They had to come here first, I explained.They were carrying a new governor for the colony.I felt an absurd urge to duck below the rail, though I knew that even Jamies red hair would be indistinguishable at this distance.Aye?I wonder whos that?Jamie spoke absently; we were no more than an hour away from arrival at Jareds plantation on Sugar Bay, and I knew his mind was busy with plans for finding Young Ian.A chap named Grey, I said, turning away from the rail.Nice man; I met him on the ship, just briefly.Grey?Startled, Jamie looked down at me.Not Lord John Grey, by chance?Yes, that was his name?Why?I glanced up at him, curious.He was staring at the Porpoise with renewed interest.Why?He heard me when I repeated the question a second time, and glanced down at me, smiling.Oh.Its only that I ken Lord John; hes a friend of mine.Really?I was no more than mildly surprised.Jamies friends had once included the French minister of finance and Charles Stuart, as well as Scottish beggars and French pickpockets.I supposed it was not remarkable that he should now count English aristocrats among his acquaintance, as well as Highland smugglers and Irish seacooks.Well, thats luck, I said.Or at least I suppose it is.Where do you know Lord John from?He was the Governor of Ardsmuir prison, he replied, surprising me after all.His eyes were still fixed on the Porpoise, narrowed in speculation.And hes a friend of yours?I shook my head.Ill never understand men.He turned and smiled at me, taking his attention at last from the English ship.Well, friends are where ye find them, Sassenach, he said.He squinted toward the shore, shading his eyes with his hand.Let us hope this Mrs.Abernathy proves to be one.As we rounded the tip of the headland, a lithe black figure materialized next to the rail.Now clothed in spare seamans clothes, with his scars hidden, Ishmael looked less like a slave and a good deal more like a pirate.Not for the first time, I wondered just how much of what he had told us was the truth.I be leavin now, he announced abruptly.Jamie lifted one eyebrow and glanced over the rail, into the soft blue depths.Dinna let me prevent ye, he said politely.But would ye not rather have a boat?Something that might have been humor flickered briefly in the black mans eyes, but didnt disturb the severe outlines of his face.You say you put me ashore where I want, I be tellin you bout those boys, he said.He nodded toward the island, where a riotous growth of jungle spilled down the slope of a hill to meet its own green shadow in the shallow water.That be where I want.Jamie looked thoughtfully from the uninhabited shore to Ishmael, and then nodded.Ill have a boat lowered.He turned to go to the cabin.I promised ye gold as well, no?Dont be wantin gold, mon.Ishmaels tone, as well as his words, stopped Jamie in his tracks.He looked at the black man with interest, mingled with a certain reserve.Yell have something else in mind?Ishmael jerked his head in a short nod.He didnt seem outwardly nervous, but I noticed the faint gleam of sweat on his temples, despite the mild noon breeze.I be wantin that one arm nigger.He stared boldly at Jamie as he spoke, but there was a diffidence under the confident facade.Temeraire?I blurted out in astonishment.Why?Ishmael flicked a glance at me, but addressed his words to Jamie, half bold, half cajoling.He aint no good to you, mon; cant be doin field work or ship work neither, aint got but one arm.Jamie didnt reply directly, but stared at Ishmael for a moment.Then he turned and called for Fergus to bring up the one armed slave.Temeraire, brought up on deck, stood expressionless as a block of wood, barely blinking in the sun.He too had been provided with seamans clothes, but he lacked Ishmaels raffish elegance in them.He looked like a stump upon which someone had spread out washing to dry.This man wants you to go with him, to the island there, Jamie said to Temeraire, in slow, careful French.Do you want to do this thing?Temeraire did blink at that, and a brief look of startlement widened his eyes.I supposed that no one had asked him what he wanted in many yearsif ever.He glanced warily from Jamie to Ishmael and back again, but didnt say anything.Jamie tried again.You do not have to go with this man, he assured the slave.You may come with us, and we will take care of you.No one will hurt you.But you can go with him, if you like.Still the slave hesitated, eyes flicking right and left, clearly startled and disturbed by the unexpected choice.It was Ishmael who decided the matter.He said something, in a strange tongue full of liquid vowels and syllables that repeated like a drumbeat.Temeraire let out a gasp, fell to his knees, and pressed his forehead to the deck at Ishmaels feet.Everyone on deck stared at him, then looked at Ishmael, who stood with arms folded with a sort of wary defiance.He be goin with me, he said.And so it was.Picard rowed the two blacks ashore in the dinghy, and left them on the rocks at the edge of the jungle, supplied with a small bag of provisions, each equipped with a knife.Why there?I wondered aloud, watching the two small figures make their way slowly up the wooded slope.There arent any towns nearby, are there?Or any plantations?To the eye, the shore presented an unbroken expanse of jungle.Oh, there are plantations, Lawrence assured me.Far up in the hills; thats where they grow the coffee and indigothe sugarcane grows better near the coast.He squinted toward the shore, where the two dark figures had disappeared.It is more likely that they have gone to join a band of Maroons, though, he said.There are Maroons on Jamaica as well as on Hispaniola?Fergus asked, interested.Lawrence smiled, a little grimly.There are Maroons wherever there are slaves, my friend, he said.There are always men who prefer to take the chance of dying like animals, rather than live as captives.Jamie turned his head sharply to look at Lawrence, but said nothing.Jareds plantation at Sugar Bay was called Blue Mountain House, presumably for the sake of the low, hazy peak that rose inland a mile behind it, blue with pines and distance.The house itself was set near the shore, in the shallow curve of the bay.In fact, the veranda that ran along one side of the house overhung a small lagoon, the building set on sturdy silvered wood pilings that rose from the water, crusted with a spongy growth of tunicates and mussels and the fine green seaweed called mermaids hair.We were expected; Jared had sent a letter by a ship that left Le Havre a week before the Artemis.Owing to our delay on Hispaniola, the letter had arrived nearly a month in advance of ourselves, and the overseer and his wifea portly, comfortable Scottish couple named MacIverswere relieved to see us.I thought surely the winter storms had got ye, Kenneth MacIver said for the fourth time, shaking his head.He was bald, the top of his head scaly and freckled from long years exposure to the tropic sun.His wife was a plump, genial, grandmotherly soulwho, I realized to my shock, was roughly five years younger than myself.She herded Marsali and me off for a quick wash, brush, and nap before supper, while Fergus and Jamie went with Mr.MacIver to direct the partial unloading of the Artemiss cargo and the disposition of her crew.I was more than willing to go; while my arm had healed sufficiently to need no more than a light bandage, it had prevented me from bathing in the sea as was my usual habit.After a week aboard the Artemis, unbathed, I looked forward to fresh water and clean sheets with a longing that was almost hunger.I had no landlegs yet; the worn wooden floorboards of the plantation house gave the disconcerting illusion of seeming to rise and fall beneath my feet, and I staggered down the hallway after Mrs.MacIver, bumping into walls.The house had an actual bathtub in a small porch; wooden, but filledmirabile dictu!with hot water, by the good offices of two black slave women who heated kettles over a fire in the yard and carried them in.I should have felt much too guilty at this exploitation to enjoy my bath, but I didnt.I wallowed luxuriously, scrubbing the salt and grime from my skin with a loofah sponge and lathering my hair with a shampoo made from chamomile, geranium oil, fat soap shavings, and the yolk of an egg, graciously supplied by Mrs.MacIver.Smelling sweet, shiny haired, and languid with warmth, I collapsed gratefully into the bed I was given.I had time only to think how delightful it was to stretch out at full length, before I fell asleep.When I woke, the shadows of dusk were gathering on the veranda outside the open French doors of my bedroom, and Jamie lay naked beside me, hands folded on his belly, breathing deep and slow.He felt me stir, and opened his eyes.He smiled sleepily and reaching up a hand, pulled me down to his mouth.He had had a bath, too; he smelled of soap and cedar needles.I kissed him at length, slowly and thoroughly, running my tongue across the wide curve of his lip, finding his tongue with mine in a soft, dark joust of greeting and invitation.I broke loose, finally, and came up for air.The room was filled with a wavering green light, reflections from the lagoon outside, as though the room itself were underwater.The air was at once warm and fresh, smelling of sea and rain, with tiny currents of breeze that caressed the skin.Ye smell sweet, Sassenach, he murmured, voice husky with sleep.He smiled, reaching up to twine his fingers into my hair.Come here to me, curly wig.Freed from pins and freshly washed, my hair was clouding over my shoulders in a perfect explosion of Medusa like curls.I reached up to smooth it back, but he tugged gently, bending me forward so the veil of brown and gold and silver fell loose over his face.I kissed him, half smothered in clouds of hair, and lowered myself to lie on top of him, letting the fullness of my breasts squash gently against his chest.He moved slightly, rubbing, and sighed with pleasure.His hands cupped my buttocks, trying to move me upward enough to enter me.Not bloody yet, I whispered.I pressed my hips down, rolling them, enjoying the feel of the silky stiffness trapped beneath my belly.He made a small breathless sound.We havent had room or time to make love properly in months, I told him.So were taking our time about it now, right?Ye take me at something of a disadvantage, Sassenach, he murmured into my hair.He squirmed under me, pressing upward urgently.Ye dinna think we could take our time next time?No, we couldnt, I said firmly.Now.Slow.Dont move.He made a sort of rumbling noise in his throat, but sighed and relaxed, letting his hands fall away to the sides.I squirmed lower on his body, making him inhale sharply, and set my mouth on his nipple.I ran my tongue delicately round the tiny nub, making it stand up stiff, enjoying the coarse feel of the curly auburn hairs that surrounded it.I felt him tense under me, and put my hands on his upper arms to hold him still while I went on with it, biting gently, sucking and flicking with my tongue.A few minutes later, I raised my head, brushed my hair back with one hand, and asked, Whats that youre saying?He opened one eye.The rosary, he informed me.Its the only way Im going to stand it.He closed his eyes and resumed murmuring in Latin.Ave Maria, gratia plena  I snorted and went to work on the other one.Youre losing your place, I said, next time I came up for air.Youve said the Lords Prayer three times in a row.Im surprised to hear Im still makin any sense at all.His eyes were closed, and a dew of moisture gleamed on his cheekbones.He moved his hips with increasing restiveness.Now?Not yet.I dipped my head lower and seized by impulse, went Pffft!into his navel.He convulsed, and taken by surprise, emitted a noise that could only be described as a giggle.Dont do that!he said.Will if I want to, I said, and did it again.You sound just like Bree, I told him.I used to do that to her when she was a baby; she loved it.Well, Im no a wee bairn, if ye hadna noticed the difference, he said a little testily.If ye must do that, at least try it a bit lower, aye?I did.You dont have any hair at all at the tops of your thighs, I said, admiring the smooth white skin there.Why is that, do you think?The cow licked it all off last time she milked me, he said between his teeth.For Gods sake, Sassenach!I laughed, and returned to my work.At last I stopped and raised myself on my elbows.I think youve had enough, I said, brushing hair out of my eyes.You havent said anything but Jesus Christ over and over again for the last few minutes.Given the cue, he surged upward, and flipped me onto my back, pinning me with the solid weight of his body.Youre going to live to regret this, Sassenach, he said with a grim satisfaction.I grinned at him, unrepentant.Am I?He looked down at me, eyes narrowed.Take my time, was it?Youll beg for it, before Ive done wi ye.I tugged experimentally at my wrists, held tight in his grasp, and wriggled slightly under him with anticipation.Ooh, mercy, I said.You beast.He snorted briefly, and bent his head to the curve of my breast, white as pearl in the dim green water light.I closed my eyes and lay back against the pillows.Pater noster, qui es in coelis I whispered.We were very late to supper.Jamie lost no time over supper in asking about Mrs.Abernathy of Rose Hall.Abernathy?MacIver frowned, tapping his knife on the table to assist thought.Aye, seems Ive heard the name, though I canna just charge my memory.Och, ye ken Abernathys fine, his wife interrupted, pausing in her instructions to a servant for the preparation of the hot pudding.Its that place up the Yallahs River, in the mountains.Cane, mostly, but a wee bit of coffee, too.Oh, aye, to be sure!her husband exclaimed.What a memory yeve got, Rosie!He beamed fondly at his wife.Well, I might not ha brought it to mind mysel, she said modestly, only as how that minister over to New Grace kirk last week was askin after Mrs.Abernathy, too.What minister is this, maam?Jamie asked, taking a split roast chicken from the huge platter presented to him by a black servant.Such a fine braw appetite as ye have, Mr.Fraser!Mrs.MacIver exclaimed admiringly, seeing his loaded plate.Its the island air does it, I expect.The tips of Jamies ears turned pink.I expect it is, he said, carefully not looking at me.This minister?Och, aye.Campbell, his name was, Archie Campbell.I started, and she glanced quizzically at me.Youll know him?I shook my head, swallowing a pickled mushroom.Ive met him once, in Edinburgh.Oh.Well, hes come to be a missionary, and bring the heathen blacks to the salvation of Our Lord Jesus.She spoke with admiration, and glared at her husband when he snorted.Now, yell no be makin your Papist remarks, Kenny!The Reverend Campbells a fine holy man, and a great scholar, forbye.Im Free Church myself, she said, leaning toward me confidingly.My parents disowned me when I wed Kenny, but I told them I was sure hed come to see the light sooner or later.A lot later, her husband remarked, spooning jam onto his plate.He grinned at his wife, who sniffed and returned to her story.So, twas on account of the Reverends bein a great scholar that Mrs.Abernathy had written him, whilst he was still in Edinburgh, to ask him questions.And now that hes come here, he had it in mind to go and see her.Though after all Myra Dalrymple and the Reverend Davis telt him, I should be surprised hed set foot on her place, she added primly.Kenny MacIver grunted, motioning to a servant in the doorway with another huge platter.I wouldna put a great deal of stock in anything the Reverend Davis says, myself, he said.The mans too godly to shit.But Myra Dalrymples a sensible woman.Ouch!He snatched back the fingers his wife had just cracked with a spoon, and sucked them.What did Miss Dalrymple have to say of Mrs.Abernathy?Jamie inquired, hastily intervening before full scale marital warfare could break out.Mrs.MacIvers color was high, but she smoothed the frown from her brow as she turned to answer him.Well, a great deal of it was no more than ill natured gossip, she admitted.The sorts of things folk will always say about a woman as lives alone.That shes owerfond of the company of her men slaves, aye?But there was the talk when her husband died, Kenny interrupted.He slid several small, rainbow striped fish off the platter the stooping servant held for him.I mind it well, now I come to think on the name.Barnabas Abernathy had come from Scotland, and had purchased Rose Hall five years before.He had run the place decently, turning a small profit in sugar and coffee, causing no comment among his neighbors.Then, two years ago, he had married a woman no one knew, bringing her home from a trip to Guadeloupe.And six months later, he was dead, Mrs.MacIver concluded with grim relish.And the talk is that Mrs.Abernathy had something to do with it?Having some idea of the plethora of tropical parasites and diseases that attacked Europeans in the West Indies, I was inclined to doubt it, myself.Barnabas Abernathy could easily have died of anything from malaria to elephantiasis, but Rosie MacIver was rightfolk were partial to ill natured gossip.Poison, Rosie said, low voiced, with a quick glance at the door to the kitchen.The doctor who saw him said so.Mind, it could ha been the slave women.There was talk about Barnabas and his female slaves, and its more common than folk like to say for a plantation cook girl to be slipping something into the stew, but She broke off as another servant came in, carrying a cut glass relish pot.Everyone was silent as the woman placed it on the table and left, curtsying to her mistress.You neednt worry, Mrs.MacIver said reassuringly, seeing me look after the woman.Weve a boy who tastes everything, before its served.Its all quite safe.I swallowed the mouthful of fish I had taken, with some difficulty.Did the Reverend Campbell go to see Mrs.Abernathy, then?Jamie put in.Rosie took the distraction gratefully.She shook her head, agitating the lace ruffles on her cap.No, Im sure not, for twas the very next day there was the stramash about his sister.In the excitement of tracking Ian and the Bruja, I had nearly forgotten Margaret Jane Campbell.What happened to his sister?I asked, curious.Why, shes disappeared!Mrs.MacIvers blue eyes went wide with importance.Blue Mountain House was remote, some ten miles out of Kingston by land, and our presence provided an unparalleled opportunity for gossip.What?Fergus had been addressing himself to his plate with singleminded devotion, but now looked up, blinking.Disappeared?Where?The whole islands talking of it, Kenny put in, snatching the conversational ball from his wife.Seems the Reverend had a woman engaged as abigail to his sister, but the woman died of a fever on the voyage.Oh, thats too bad!I felt a real pang for Nellie Cowden, with her broad, pleasant face.Aye.Kenny nodded offhandedly.Well, and so the Reverend found a place for his sister to lodge.Feebleminded, I understand?He lifted a brow at me.Something like that.Aye, well, the lass seemed quiet and biddable, and Mrs.Forrest, who had the house where she lodged, would take her to sit on the veranda in the cool part of the day.So Tuesday last, a boy comes to say as Mrs.Forrest is wanted quicklike to come to her sister, whos having a child.And Mrs.Forrest got flustered and went straight off, forgetting Miss Campbell on the veranda.And when she thought of it, and sent someone back to seewhy Miss Campbell was gone.And not a smell of her since, in spite of the Reverend raising heaven and earth, ye might say.MacIver rocked back on his chair, puffing out his sun mottled cheeks.Mrs.MacIver wagged her head, tsking mournfully.Myra Dalrymple told the Reverend as how he should go to the Governor for help to find her, she said.But the Governors scarce settled, and not yet ready to receive anyone.Hes having a great reception this coming Thursday, for to meet all the important folk o the island.Myra said as the Reverend must go, and speak to the Governor there, but hes no of a mind to do that, it bein such a worldly occasion, aye?A reception?Jamie set down his spoon, looking at Mrs.MacIver with interest.Is it by invitation, dye know?Oh, no, she said, shaking her head.Anyone may come as likes to, or so Ive heard.Is that so?Jamie glanced at me, smiling.What dye think, Sassenachwould ye care to step out wi me at the Governors Residence?I stared at him in astonishment.I should have thought that the last thing he would wish to do was show himself in public.I was also surprised that he would let anything at all stop his visiting Rose Hall at the earliest opportunity.Its a good opportunity to ask about Ian, no?he explained.After all, he might not be at Rose Hall, but someplace else on the island.Well, aside from the fact that Ive nothing to wear I temporized, trying to figure out what he was really up to.Och, thats no trouble, Rosie MacIver assured me.Ive one of the cleverest sempstresses on the island; shell have ye tricked out in no time.Jamie was nodding thoughtfully.He smiled, eyes slanting as he looked at me over the candle flame.Violet silk, I think, he said.He plucked the bones delicately from his fish and set them aside.And as for the otherdinna fash, Sassenach.Ive something in mind.Youll see.58  MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH  Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?And what has he been after that they groan and shake their fists?And wherefore is he wearing such a conscience stricken air?Oh theyre taking him to prison for the colour of his hair.Jamie put down the wig in his hand and raised one eyebrow at me in the mirror.I grinned at him and went on, declaiming with gestures:  Tis a shame to human nature, such a head of hair as his;   In the good old time twas hanging for the colour that it is;   Though hanging isnt bad enough and flaying would be fair   For the nameless and abominable colour of his hair!Did ye not tell me yed studied for a doctor, Sassenach?he inquired.Or was it a poet, after all?Not me, I assured him, coming to straighten his stock.Those sentiments are by one A.  E.  Housman.Surely one of him is sufficient, Jamie said dryly.Given the quality of his opinions.He picked up the wig and fitted it carefully on his head, raising little puffs of scented powder as he poked it here and there.Is Mr.Housman an acquaintance of yours, then?You might say so.I sat down on the bed to watch.Its only that the doctors lounge at the hospital I worked at had a copy of Housmans collected works that someone had left there.There isnt time between calls to read most novels, but poems are ideal.I expect I know most of Housman by heart, now.He looked warily at me, as though expecting another outburst of poetry, but I merely smiled at him, and he returned to his work.I watched the transformation in fascination.Red heeled shoes and silk stockings clocked in black.Gray satin breeches with silver knee buckles.Snowy linen, with Brussels lace six inches deep at cuff and jabot.The coat, a masterpiece in heavy gray with blue satin cuffs and crested silver buttons, hung behind the door, awaiting its turn.He finished the careful powdering of his face, and licking the end of one finger, picked up a false beauty mark, dabbed it in gum arabic, and affixed it neatly near the corner of his mouth.There, he said, swinging about on the dressing stool to face me.Do I look like a red heided Scottish smuggler?I inspected him carefully, from full bottomed wig to morocco heeled shoes.You look like a gargoyle, I said.His face flowered in a wide grin.Outlined in white powder, his lips seemed abnormally red, his mouth even wider and more expressive than it usually was.Non!said Fergus indignantly, coming in in time to hear this.He looks like a Frenchman.Much the same thing, Jamie said, and sneezed.Wiping his nose on a handkerchief, he assured the young man, Begging your pardon, Fergus.He stood up and reached for the coat, shrugging it over his shoulders and settling the edges.In three inch heels, he towered to a height of six feet seven; his head nearly brushed the plastered ceiling.I dont know, I said, looking up at him dubiously.Ive never seen a Frenchman that size.Jamie shrugged, his coat rustling like autumn leaves.Aye, well, theres no hiding my height.But so long as my hair is hidden, I think it will be all right.Besides, he added, gazing with approval at me, folk willna be looking at me.Stand up and let me see, aye?I obliged, rotating slowly to show off the deep flare of the violet silk skirt.Cut low in the front, the dcolletage was filled with a froth of lace that rippled down the front of the bodice in a series of Vs.Matching lace cascaded from the elbow length sleeves in graceful white falls that left my wrists bare.Rather a pity I dont have your mothers pearls, I remarked.I didnt regret their lack; I had left them for Brianna, in the box with the photographs and family documents.Still, with the deep dcolletage and my hair twisted up in a knot, the mirror showed a long expanse of bare neck and bosom, rising whitely out of the violet silk.I thought of that.With the air of a conjuror, Jamie produced a small box from his inside pocket and presented it to me, making a leg in his best Versailles fashion.Inside was a small, gleaming fish, carved in a dense black material, the edges of its scales touched with gold.Its a pin, he explained.Ye could maybe wear it fastened to a white ribbon round your neck?Its beautiful!I said, delighted.Whats it made of?Ebony?Black coral, he said.I got it yesterday, when Fergus and I were in Montego Bay.He and Fergus had taken the Artemis round the island, disposing at last of the cargo of bat guano, delivered to its purchaser.I found a length of white satin ribbon, and Jamie obligingly tied it about my neck, bending to peer over my shoulder at the reflection in the mirror.No, they wont be looking at me, he said.Half o them will be lookin at you, Sassenach, and the other half at Mr.Willoughby.Mr.Willoughby?Is that safe?I mean I stole a look at the little Chinese, sitting patiently cross legged on a stool, gleaming in clean blue silk, and lowered my voice.I mean, theyll have wine, wont they?Jamie nodded.And whisky, and cambric, and claret cup, and port, and champagne punchand a wee cask of the finest French brandycontributed by the courtesy of Monsieur Etienne Marcel de Provac Alexandre.He put a hand on his chest and bowed again, in an exaggerated pantomime that made me laugh.Nay worry, he said, straightening up.Hell behave, or Ill have his coral globe backwill I no, ye wee heathen?he added with a grin to Mr.Willoughby.The Chinese scholar nodded with considerable dignity.The embroidered black silk of his round cap was decorated with a small carved knob of red coralthe badge of his calling, restored to him by the chance encounter with a coral trader on the docks at Montego, and Jamies good nature.Youre quite sure we have to go?The palpitations I was experiencing were due in part to the tightness of the stays I was wearing, but in greater degree to recurring visions of Jamies wig falling off and the reception coming to a complete stop as the entire assemblage paused to stare at his hair before calling en masse for the Royal Navy.Aye, we do.He smiled at me reassuringly.Dinna worry, Sassenach; if anyones there from the Porpoise, its not likely theyll recognize menot like this.I hope not.Do you think anyone from the ship will be there tonight?I doubt it.He scratched viciously at the wig above his left ear.Where did ye get this thing, Fergus?I believe its got lice.Oh, no, milord, Fergus assured him.The wigmaker from whom I rented it assured me that it had been well dusted with hyssop and horse nettle to prevent any such infestations.Fergus himself was wearing his own hair, thickly powdered, and was handsomeif less startling than Jamiein a new suit of dark blue velvet.There was a tentative knock at the door, and Marsali stepped in.She too had had her wardrobe refurbished, and glowed in a dress of soft pink, with a deep rose sash.She glowed somewhat more than I thought the dress accounted for, in fact, and as we made our way down the narrow corridor to the carriage, pulling in our skirts to keep them from brushing the walls, I managed to lean forward and murmur in her ear.Are you using the tansy oil?Mm?she said absently, her eyes on Fergus as he bowed and held open the carriage door for her.What did ye say?Never mind, I said, resigned.That was the least of our worries at the moment.The Governors mansion was ablaze with lights.Lanterns were perched along the low wall of the veranda, and hung from the trees along the paths of the ornamental garden.Gaily dressed people were emerging from their carriages on the crushed shell drive, passing into the house through a pair of huge French doors.We dismissed our ownor, rather, Jaredscarriage, but stood for a moment on the drive, waiting for a brief lull in the arrivals.Jamie seemed mildly nervousfor him; his fingers twitched now and then against the gray satin, but his manner was outwardly as calm as ever.There was a short reception line in the foyer; several of the minor dignitaries of the island had been invited to assist the new governor in welcoming his guests.I passed ahead of Jamie down the line, smiling and nodding to the Mayor of Kingston and his wife.I quailed a bit at the sight of a fully decorated admiral next in line, resplendent in gilded coat and epaulettes, but no sign of anything beyond a mild amazement crossed his features as he shook hands with the gigantic Frenchman and the tiny Chinese who accompanied me.There was my acquaintance from the Porpoise; Lord Johns blond hair was hidden under a formal wig tonight, but I recognized the fine, clear features and slight, muscular body at once.He stood a little apart from the other dignitaries, alone.Rumor had it that his wife had refused to leave England to accompany him to this posting.He turned to greet me, his face fixed in an expression of formal politeness.He looked, blinked, and then broke into a smile of extraordinary warmth and pleasure.Mrs.Malcolm!he exclaimed, seizing my hands.I am vastly pleased to see you!The feeling is entirely mutual, I said, smiling back at him.I didnt know you were the Governor, last time we met.Im afraid I was a bit informal.He laughed, his face glowing with the light of the candles in the wall sconces.Seen clearly in the light for the first time, I realized what a remarkably handsome man he was.You might be thought to have had an excellent excuse, he said.He looked me over carefully.May I say that you are in remarkable fine looks this evening?Clearly the island air must agree with you somewhat more than the miasmas of shipboard.I had hoped to meet you again before leaving the Porpoise, but when I inquired for you, I was told by Mr.Leonard that you were unwell.I trust you are entirely recovered?Oh, entirely, I told him, amused.Unwell, eh?Evidently Tom Leonard was not about to admit to losing me overboard.I wondered whether he had put my disappearance in the log.May I introduce my husband?I turned to wave at Jamie, who had been detained in animated conversation with the admiral, but who was now advancing toward us, accompanied by Mr.Willoughby.I turned back to find the Governor gone green as a gooseberry.He stared from Jamie to me, and back again, pale as though confronted by twin specters.Jamie came to a stop beside me, and inclined his head graciously toward the Governor.John, he said softly.Its good to see ye, man.The Governors mouth opened and shut without making a sound.Let us make an opportunity to speak, a bit later, Jamie murmured.But for nowmy name is Etienne Alexandre.He took my arm, and bowed formally.And may I have the pleasure to present to you my wife, Claire?he said aloud, shifting effortlessly into French.Claire?The Governor looked wildly at me.Claire?Er, yes, I said, hoping he wasnt going to faint.He looked very much as though he might, though I had no idea why the revelation of my Christian name ought to affect him so strongly.The next arrivals were waiting impatiently for us to move out of the way.I bowed, fluttering my fan, and we walked into the main salon of the Residence.I glanced back over my shoulder to see the Governor, shaking hands mechanically with the new arrival, staring after us with a face like white paper.The salon was a huge room, low ceilinged and filled with people, noisy and bright as a cageful of parrots.I felt some relief at the sight.Among this crowd, Jamie wouldnt be terribly conspicuous, despite his size.A small orchestra played at one side of the room, near a pair of doors thrown open to the terrace outside.I saw a number of people strolling there, evidently seeking either a breath of air, or sufficient quiet to hold a private conversation.At the other side of the room, yet another pair of doors opened into a short hallway, where the retiring rooms were.We knew no one, and had no social sponsor to make introductions.However, due to Jamies foresight, we had no need of one.Within moments of our arrival, women had begun to cluster around us, fascinated by Mr.Willoughby.My acquaintance, Mr.Yi Tien Cho, Jamie introduced him to a stout young woman in tight yellow satin.Late of the Celestial Kingdom of China, Madame.Ooh!The young lady fluttered her fan before her face, impressed.Really from China?But what an unthinkable distance you must have come!Do let me welcome you to our small island, Mr.Mr.Cho?She extended a hand to him, clearly expecting it to be kissed.Mr.Willoughby bowed deeply, hands in his sleeves, and obligingly said something in Chinese.The young woman looked thrilled.Jamie looked momentarily startled, and then the mask of urbanity dropped back over his face.I saw Mr.Willoughbys shining black eyes fix on the tips of the ladys shoes, protruding from under the hem of her dress, and wondered just what he had said to her.Jamie seized the opportunityand the ladys handbowing over it with extreme politeness.Your servant, Madame, he said in thickly accented English.Etienne Alexandre.And might I present to you my wife, Claire?Oh, yes, so pleased to meet you!The young woman, flushed with excitement, took my hand and squeezed it.Im Marcelline Williams; perhaps youll be acquainted with my brother, Judah?He owns Twelvetreesyou know, the large coffee plantation?Ive come to stay with him for the season, and Im having ever so marvelous a time!No, Im afraid we dont know anyone here, I said apologetically.Weve only just arrived ourselvesfrom Martinique, where my husbands sugar business is.Oh, Miss Williams cried, her eyes flying wide open.But you must allow me to make you acquainted with my particular friends, the Stephenses!I believe they once visited Martinique, and Georgina Stephens is such a charming personyou will like her at once, I promise!And that was all there was to it.Within an hour, I had been introduced to dozens of people, and was being carried slowly round the room, eddying from one group to the next, passed hand to hand by the current of introductions launched by Miss Williams.Across the room, I could see Jamie, standing head and shoulders above his companions, the picture of aristocratic dignity.He was conversing cordially with a group of men, all eager to make the acquaintance of a prosperous businessman who might offer useful contacts with the French sugar trade.I caught his eye once, in passing, and he gave me a brilliant smile and a gallant French bow.I still wondered what in the name of God he thought he was up to, but shrugged mentally.He would tell me when he was ready.Fergus and Marsali, as usual needing no ones company but each others, were dancing at one end of the floor, her glowing pink face smiling into his.For the sake of the occasion, Fergus had forgone his useful hook, replacing it with a black leather glove filled with bran, pinned to the sleeve of his coat.This rested against the back of Marsalis gown, a trifle stiff looking, but not so unnatural as to provoke comment.I danced past them, revolving sedately in the arms of a short, tubby English planter named Carstairs, who wheezed pleasantries into my bosom, red face streaming sweat.As for Mr.Willoughby, he was enjoying an unparalleled social triumph, the center of attention of a cluster of ladies who vied with each other in pressing dainties and refreshments on him.His eyes were bright, and a faint flush shone on his sallow cheeks.Mr.Carstairs deposited me among a group of ladies at the end of the dance, and gallantly went to fetch a cup of claret.I at once returned to the business of the evening, asking the ladies whether they might be familiar with people to whose acquaintance I had been recommended, named Abernathy.Abernathy?Mrs.Hall, a youngish matron, fluttered her fan and looked blank.No, I cannot say I am acquainted with them.Do they take a great part in society, do you know?Oh, no, Joan!Her friend, Mrs.Yoakum, looked shocked, with the particular kind of enjoyable shock that precedes some juicy revelation.Youve heard of the Abernathys!You remember, the man who bought Rose Hall, up on the Yallahs River?Oh, yes!Mrs.Halls blue eyes widened.The one who died so soon after buying it?Yes, thats the one, another lady chimed in, overhearing.Malaria, they said it was, but I spoke to the doctor who attended himhe had come to dress Mamas bad leg, you know she is such a martyr to the dropsyand he told mein strictest confidence, of course  The tongues wagged merrily.Rosie MacIver had been a faithful reporter; all the stories she had conveyed were here, and more.I caught hold of the conversational thread and gave it a jerk in the desired direction.Does Mrs.Abernathy have indentured labor, as well as slaves?Here opinion was more confused.Some thought that she had several indentured servants, some thought only one or twono one present had actually set foot in Rose Hall, but of course people said  A few minutes later, the gossip had turned to fresh meat, and the incredible behavior of the new curate, Mr.Jones, with the widowed Mrs.Mina Alcott, but then, what could be expected of a woman with her reputation, and surely it was not entirely the young mans fault, and she so much older, though of course, one in Holy Orders might be expected to be held to a higher standardI made an excuse and slipped away to the ladies retiring room, my ears ringing.I saw Jamie as I went, standing near the refreshment table.He was talking to a tall, red haired girl in embroidered cotton, a trace of unguarded tenderness lingering in his eyes as he looked at her.She was smiling eagerly up at him, flattered by his attention.I smiled at the sight, wondering what the young lady would think, did she realize that he was not really looking at her at all, but imagining her as the daughter he had never seen.I stood in front of the looking glass in the outer retiring room, tucking in stray curls loosened by the exertion of dancing, and took pleasure in the temporary silence.The retiring room was luxuriously appointed, being in fact three separate chambers, with the privy facilities and a room for the storage of hats, shawls, and extraneous clothing opening off the main room, where I stood.This had not only a long pier glass and a fully appointed dressing table, but also a chaise longue, covered in red velvet.I eyed it with some wistfulnessthe slippers I was wearing were pinching my feet badlybut duty called.So far, I had learned nothing beyond what we already knew about the Abernathy plantation, though I had compiled a useful list of several other plantations near Kingston that employed indentured labor.I wondered whether Jamie intended to call upon his friend the Governor to help in the search for Ianthat might possibly justify risking an appearance here tonight.But Lord Johns response to the revelation of my identity was both puzzling and disturbing; you would think the man had seen a ghost.I squinted at my violet reflection, admiring the glitter of the black and gold fish at my throat, but failed to see anything unsettling in my appearance.My hair was tucked up with pins decorated with seed pearls and brilliants, and discreet use of Mrs.MacIvers cosmetics had darkened my lids and blushed my cheeks quite becomingly, if I did say so myself.I shrugged, fluttered my lashes seductively at my image, then patted my hair and returned to the salon.I made my way toward the long tables of refreshments, where a huge array of cakes, pastries, savories, fruits, candies, stuffed rolls, and a number of objects I couldnt put a name to but presumed edible were displayed.As I turned absentmindedly from the refreshment table with a plate of fruit, I collided headlong with a dark hued waistcoat.Apologizing to its owner in confusion, I found myself looking up into the dour face of the Reverend Archibald Campbell.Mrs.Malcolm!he exclaimed in astonishment.ErReverend Campbell, I replied, rather weakly.What a surprise.I dabbed tentatively at a smear of mango on his abdomen, but he took a marked step backward, and I desisted.He looked rather coldly at my dcolletage.I trust I find you well, Mrs.Malcolm?he said.Yes, thank you, I said.I wished he would stop calling me Mrs.Malcolm before someone to whom I had been introduced as Madame Alexandre heard him.I was so sorry to hear about your sister, I said, hoping to distract him.Have you any word of her yet?He bent his head stiffly, accepting my sympathy.No.My own attempts at instigating a search have of course been limited, he said.It was at the suggestion of one of my parishioners that I accompanied him and his wife here tonight, with the intention of putting my case before the Governor, and begging his assistance in locating my sister.I assure you, Mrs.Malcolm, no less weighty a consideration would have impelled my attendance at a function such as this.He cast a glance of profound dislike at a laughing group nearby, where three young men were competing with each other in the composition of witty toasts to a group of young ladies, who received these attentions with much giggling and energetic fan fluttering.Im truly sorry for your misfortune, Reverend, I said, edging aside.Miss Cowden told me a bit about your sisters tragedy.If I should be able to be of help  No one can help, he interrupted.His eyes were bleak.It was the fault of the Papist Stuarts, with their wicked attempt upon the throne, and the licentious Highlanders who followed them.No, no one can help, save God.He has destroyed the house of Stuart; he will destroy the man Fraser as well, and on that day, my sister will be healed.Fraser?The trend of the conversation was making me distinctly uneasy.I glanced quickly across the room, but luckily Jamie was nowhere in sight.That is the name of the man who seduced Margaret from her family and her proper loyalties.His may not have been the hand that struck her down, but it was on his account that she had left her home and safety, and placed herself in danger.Aye, God will requite James Fraser fairly, he said with a sort of grim satisfaction at the thought.Yes, Im sure he will, I murmured.If you will excuse me, I believe I see a friend I tried to escape, but a passing procession of footmen bearing dishes of meat blocked my way.God will not suffer lewdness to endure forever, the Reverend went on, evidently feeling that the Almightys opinions coincided largely with his own.His small gray eyes rested with icy disapproval on a group nearby, where several ladies fluttered around Mr.Willoughby like bright moths about a Chinese lantern.Mr.Willoughby was brightly lit, too, in more than one sense of the word.His high pitched giggle rose above the laughter of the ladies, and I saw him lurch heavily against a passing servant, nearly upsetting a tray of sorbet cups.Let the women learn with all sobriety, the Reverend was intoning, avoiding all gaudiness of clothing and broided hair.He seemed to be hitting his stride; no doubt Sodom and Gomorrah would be up next.A woman who has no husband should devote herself to the service of the Lord, not be disporting herself with abandon in public places.Do you see Mrs.Alcott?And she a widow, who should be engaged in pious works!I followed the direction of his frown and saw that he was looking at a chubby, jolly looking woman in her thirties, with light brown hair done in gathered ringlets, who was giggling at Mr.Willoughby.I looked at her with interest.So this was the infamous merry widow of Kingston!The little Chinese had now got down upon his hands and knees and was crawling around on the floor, pretending to look for a lost earring, while Mrs.Alcott squeaked in mock alarm at his forays toward her feet.I thought perhaps I had better find Fergus without delay, and have him detach Mr.Willoughby from his new acquaintance before matters went too far.Evidently offended beyond bearing by the sight, the Reverend abruptly put down the cup of lemon squash he had been holding, turned and made his way through the crowd toward the terrace, vigorously elbowing people out of his way.I breathed a sigh of relief; conversation with the Reverend Campbell was a lot like exchanging frivolities with the public hangmanthough, in fact, the only hangman with whom I had been personally acquainted was much better company than the Reverend.Suddenly I saw Jamies tall figure, heading for a door on the far side of the room, where I assumed the Governors private quarters to be.He must be going to talk to Lord John now.Moved by curiosity, I decided to join him.The floor was by now so crowded that it was difficult to make my way across it.By the time I reached the door through which Jamie had gone, he had long since disappeared, but I pushed my way through.I was in a long hallway, dimly lighted by candles in sconces, and pierced at intervals by long casement windows, through which red light from the torches on the terrace outside flickered, picking up the gleam of metal from the decorations on the walls.These were largely military, consisting of ornamental sprays of pistols, knives, shields and swords.Lord Johns personal souvenirs?I wondered, or had they come with the house?Away from the clamor of the salon, it was remarkably quiet.I walked down the hallway, my steps muffled by the long Turkey carpet that covered the parquet.There was an indistinguishable murmur of male voices ahead.I turned a corner into a shorter corridor and saw a door ahead from which light spilledthat must be the Governors private office.Inside, I heard Jamies voice.Oh, God, John!he said.I stopped dead, halted much more by the tone of that voice than by the wordsit was broken with an emotion I had seldom heard from him.Walking very quietly, I drew closer.Framed in the half open door was Jamie, head bowed as he pressed Lord John Grey tight in a fervent embrace.I stood still, completely incapable of movement or speech.As I watched, they broke apart.Jamies back was turned to me, but Lord John faced the hallway; he could have seen me easily, had he looked.He wasnt looking toward the hallway, though.He was staring at Jamie, and on his face was a look of such naked hunger that the blood rushed to my own cheeks when I saw it.I dropped my fan.I saw the Governors head turn, startled at the sound.Then I was running down the hall, back toward the salon, my heartbeat drumming in my ears.I shot through the door into the salon and came to a halt behind a potted palm, heart pounding.The wrought iron chandeliers were thick with beeswax candles, and pine torches burned brightly on the walls, but even so, the corners of the room were dark.I stood in the shadows, trembling.My hands were cold, and I felt slightly sick.What in the name of God was going on?The Governors shock at learning that I was Jamies wife was now at least partially explained; that one glimpse of unguarded, painful yearning had told me exactly how matters stood on his side.Jamie was another question altogether.He was the Governor of Ardsmuir prison, he had said, casually.And less casually, on another occasion, Dye ken what men in prison do?I did know, but I would have sworn on Briannas head that Jamie didnt; hadnt, couldnt, under any circumstances whatever.At least I would have sworn that before tonight.I closed my eyes, chest heaving, and tried not to think of what I had seen.I couldnt, of course.And yet, the more I thought of it, the more impossible it seemed.The memories of Jack Randall might have faded with the physical scars he had left, but I could not believe that they would ever fade sufficiently for Jamie to tolerate the physical attentions of another man, let alone to welcome them.But if he knew Grey so intimately as to make what I had witnessed plausible in the name of friendship alone, then why had he not told me of him before?Why go to such lengths to see the man, as soon as he learned that Grey was in Jamaica?My stomach dropped once more, and the feeling of sickness returned.I wanted badly to sit down.As I leaned against the wall, trembling in the shadows, the door to the Governors quarters opened, and the Governor came out, returning to his party.His face was flushed and his eyes shone.I could at that moment easily have murdered him, had I anything more lethal than a hairpin to hand.The door opened again a few minutes later, and Jamie emerged, no more than six feet away.His mask of cool reserve was in place, but I knew him well enough to see the marks of a strong emotion under it.But while I could see it, I couldnt interpret it.Excitement?Apprehension?Fear and joy mingled?Something else?I had simply never seen him look that way before.He didnt seek conversation or refreshments, but instead began to stroll about the room, obviously looking for someone.For me.I swallowed heavily.I couldnt face himnot in front of a crowd.I stayed where I was, watching him, until he finally went out onto the terrace.Then I left my hiding place, and crossed the room as quickly as I could, heading for the refuge of the retiring room.At least there I would be able to sit down for a moment.I pushed open the heavy door and stepped inside, relaxing at once as the warm, comforting scents of womens perfume and powder surrounded me.Then the other smell struck me.It too was a familiar scentone of the smells of my profession.But not expected here.The retiring room was still quiet; the loud rumble from the salon had dropped abruptly to a faint murmur, like a far off thunderstorm.It was, however, no longer a place of refuge.Mina Alcott lay sprawled across the red velvet chaise, her head hanging backward over the edge, her skirts in disarray about her neck.Her eyes were open, fixed in upside down surprise.The blood from her severed throat had turned the velvet black beneath her, and dripped down into a large pool beneath her head.Her light brown hair had come loose from its dressing, the matted ends of her ringlets dangling in the puddle.I stood frozen, too paralyzed even to call for help.Then I heard the sound of gay voices in the hallway outside, and the door pushed open.There was a moments silence as the women behind me saw it too.Light from the corridor spilled through the door and across the floor, and in the moment before the screaming began, I saw the footprints leading toward the windowthe small neat prints of a felt soled foot, outlined in blood.59  IN WHICH MUCH IS REVEALED  They had taken Jamie somewhere.I, shaking and incoherent, had been putwith a certain amount of ironyin the Governors private office with Marsali, who insisted on trying to bathe my face with a damp towel, in spite of my resistance.They canna think Da had anything to do with it!she said, for the fifth time.They dont.I finally pulled myself together enough to talk to her.But they think Mr.Willoughby didand Jamie brought him here.She stared at me, wide eyed with horror.Mr.Willoughby?But he couldnt!I wouldnt have thought so.I felt as though someone had been beating me with a club; everything ached.I sat slumped on a small velvet love seat, aimlessly twirling a glass of brandy between my hands, unable to drink it.I couldnt even decide what I ought to feel, let alone sort out the conflicting events and emotions of the evening.My mind kept jumping between the grisly scene in the retiring room, and the tableau I had seen a half hour earlier, in this very room.I sat looking at the Governors big desk.I could still see the two of them, Jamie and Lord John, as though they had been painted on the wall before me.I just dont believe it, I said out loud, and felt slightly better for the saying.Neither do I, said Marsali.She was pacing the floor, her footsteps changing from the click of heels on parquet to a muffled thump as she hit the flowered carpet.He cant have!I ken hes a heathen, but weve lived wi the man!We know him!Did we?Did I know Jamie?I would have sworn I did, and yetI kept remembering what he had said to me at the brothel, during our first night together.Will ye take me, and risk the man that I am, for the sake of the man ye knew?I had thought thenand sincethat there was not so much difference between them.But if I were wrong?Im not wrong!I muttered, clutching my glass fiercely.Im not!If Jamie could take Lord John Grey as a lover, and hide it from me, he wasnt remotely the man I thought he was.There had to be some other explanation.He didnt tell you about Laoghaire, said an insidious little voice inside my head.Thats different, I said to it stoutly.Whats different?Marsali was looking at me in surprise.I dont know; dont mind me.I brushed a hand across my face, trying to wipe away confusion and weariness.Its taking them a long time.The walnut case clock had struck two oclock in the morning before the door of the office opened and Fergus came in, accompanied by a grim looking militiaman.Fergus was somewhat the worse for wear; most of the powder had gone from his hair, shaken onto the shoulders of his dark blue coat like dandruff.What was left gave his hair a grayish cast, as though he had aged twenty years overnight.No surprise; I felt as though I had.We can go now, chrie, he said quietly to Marsali.He turned to me.Will you come with us, milady, or wait for milord?Ill wait, I said.I wasnt going to bed until I had seen Jamie, no matter how long it took.I will have the carriage return for you, then, he said, and put a hand on Marsalis back to usher her out.The militiaman said something under his breath as they passed him.I didnt catch it, but evidently Fergus did.He stiffened, eyes narrowing, and turned back toward the man.The militiaman rocked up onto the balls of his feet, smiling evilly and looking expectant.Clearly he would like nothing better than an excuse to hit Fergus.To his surprise, Fergus smiled charmingly at him, square white teeth gleaming.My thanks, mon ami, he said, for your assistance in this most trying situation.He thrust out a black gloved hand, which the militiaman accepted in surprise.Then Fergus jerked his arm suddenly backward.There was a brief rip, and a pattering sound, as a small stream of bran struck the parquet floor.Keep it, he told the militiaman graciously.A small token of my appreciation.And then they were gone, leaving the man slack jawed, staring down in horror at the apparently severed hand in his grasp.It was another hour before the door opened again, this time to admit the Governor.He was still handsome and neat as a white camellia, but definitely beginning to turn brown round the edges.I set the untouched glass of brandy down and got to my feet to face him.Where is Jamie?Still being questioned by Captain Jacobs, the militia commander.He sank into his chair, looking bemused.I had no notion he spoke French so remarkably well.I dont suppose you know him all that well, I said, deliberately baiting.What I wanted badly to know was just how well he did know Jamie.He didnt rise to it, though; merely took off his formal wig and laid it aside, running a hand through his damp blond hair with relief.Can he keep up such an impersonation, do you think?he asked, frowning, and I realized that he was so occupied with thoughts of the murder and of Jamie that he was paying little, if any, attention to me.Yes, I said shortly.Where do they have him?I got up, heading for the door.In the formal parlor, he said.But I dont think you should  Not pausing to listen, I yanked open the door and poked my head into the hall, then hastily drew it back and slammed the door.Coming down the hall was the Admiral I had met in the receiving line, face set in lines of gravity suitable to the situation.Admirals I could deal with.However, he was accompanied by a flotilla of junior officers, and among the entourage I had spotted a face I knew, though he was now wearing the uniform of a first lieutenant, instead of an oversized captains coat.He was shaved and rested, but his face was puffy and discolored; someone had beaten him up in the not too distant past.Despite the differences in his appearance, I had not the slightest difficulty in recognizing Thomas Leonard.I had the distinct feeling that he wouldnt have any trouble recognizing me, either, violet silk notwithstanding.I looked frantically about the office for someplace to hide, but short of crawling into the kneehole of the desk, there was no place at all.The Governor was watching me, fair brows raised in astonishment.What he began, but I rounded on him, finger to my lips.Dont give me away, if you value Jamies life!I hissed melodramatically, and so saying, flung myself onto the velvet love seat, snatched up the damp towel and dropped it on my face, andwith a superhuman effort of willforced all my limbs to go limp.I heard the door open, and the Admirals high, querulous voice.Lord John he began, and then evidently noticed my supine form, for he broke off and resumed in a slightly lower voice, Oh!I collect you are engaged?Not precisely engaged, Admiral, no.Grey had fast reflexes, I would say that for him; he sounded perfectly self possessed, as though he were quite used to being found in custody of unconscious females.The lady was overcome by the shock of discovering the body.Oh!said the Admiral again, this time dripping with sympathy.I quite see that.Beastly shock for a lady, to be sure.He hesitated, then dropping his voice to a sort of hoarse whisper, said, Dyou think shes asleep?I should think so, the Governor assured him.Shes had enough brandy to fell a horse.My fingers twitched, but I managed to lie still.Oh, quite.Best thing for shock, brandy.The Admiral went on whispering, sounding like a rusted hinge.Meant to tell you I have sent to Antigua for additional troopsquite at your disposalguards, search the townif the militia dont find the fellow first, he added.I hope they may not, said a viciously determined voice among the officers.Id like to catch the yellow bugger myself.There wouldnt be enough of him left to hang, believe me!A deep murmur of approval at this sentiment went through the men, to be sternly quelled by the Admiral.Your sentiments do you credit, gentlemen, he said, but the law will be observed in all respects.You will make that clear to the troops in your command; when the miscreant is taken, he is to be brought to the Governor, and justice will be properly executed, I assure you.I didnt like the way he emphasized the word executed, but he got a grudging chorus of assent from his officers.The Admiral, having delivered this order in his ordinary voice, dropped back into a whisper to take his leave.I shall be staying in the town, at MacAdams Hotel, he croaked.Do not hesitate to send to me for any assistance, Your Excellency.There was a general shuffle and murmur as the naval officers took their leave, observing discretion for the sake of my slumbers.Then came the sound of a single pair of footsteps, and then the whoosh and creak of someone settling heavily into a chair.There was silence for a moment.Then Lord John said You can get up now, if you wish.I am supposing that you are not in fact prostrate with shock, he added, ironically.Somehow I suspect that a mere murder would not be sufficient to discompose a woman who could deal single handedly with a typhoid epidemic.I removed the towel from my face and swung my feet off the chaise, sitting up to face him.He was leaning on his desk, chin in his hands, staring at me.There are shocks, I said precisely, smoothing back my damp curls and giving him an eyeball, and then there are shocks.If you know what I mean.He looked surprised; then a flicker of understanding came into his expression.He reached into the drawer of his desk, and pulled out my fan, white silk embroidered with violets.This is yours, I suppose?I found it in the corridor.His mouth twisted wryly as he looked at me.I see.I suppose, then, you will have some notion of how your appearance earlier this evening affected me.I doubt it very much, I said.My fingers were still icy, and I felt as though I had swallowed some large, cold object that pressed uncomfortably under my breastbone.I breathed deeply, trying to force it down, to no avail.You didnt know that Jamie was married?He blinked, but not in time to keep me from seeing a small grimace of pain, as though someone had struck him suddenly across the face.I knew he had been married, he corrected.He dropped his hands, fiddling aimlessly with the small objects that littered his desk.He told meor gave me to understand, at leastthat you were dead.Grey picked up a small silver paperweight, and turned it over and over in his hands, eyes fixed on the gleaming surface.A large sapphire was set in it, winking blue in the candlelight.Has he never mentioned me?he asked softly.I wasnt sure whether the undertone in his voice was pain or anger.Despite myself, I felt some small sense of pity for him.Yes, he did, I said.He said you were his friend.He glanced up, the fine cut face lightening a bit.Did he?You have to understand, I said.HeIwe were separated by the war, the Rising.Each of us thought the other was dead.I found him again onlymy God, was it only four months ago?I felt staggered, and not only by the events of the evening.I felt as though I had lived several lifetimes since the day I had opened the door of the printshop in Edinburgh, to find A.  Malcolm bending over his press.The lines of stress in Greys face eased a little.I see, he said slowly.Soyou have not seen him sincemy God, thats twenty years!He stared at me, dumbfounded.And four months?Whyhow He shook his head, brushing away the questions.Well, thats of no consequence just now.But he did not tell youthat ishas he not told you about Willie?I stared at him blankly.Whos Willie?Instead of explaining, he bent and opened the drawer of his desk.He pulled out a small object and laid it on the desk, motioning me to come closer.It was a portrait, an oval miniature, set in a carved frame of some fine grained dark wood.I looked at the face, and sat down abruptly, my knees gone to water.I was only dimly aware of Greys face, floating above the desk like a cloud on the horizon, as I picked up the miniature to look at it more closely.He might have been Brees brother, was my first thought.The second, coming with the force of a blow to the solar plexus, was My God in heaven, he is Brees brother!There couldnt be much doubt about it.The boy in the portrait was perhaps nine or ten, with a childish tenderness still lingering about his face, and his hair was a soft chestnut brown, not red.But the slanted blue eyes looked out boldly over a straight nose a fraction of an inch too long, and the high Viking cheekbones pressed tight against smooth skin.The tilt of the head held the same confident carriage as that of the man who had given him that face.My hands trembled so violently that I nearly dropped it.I set it back on the desk, but kept my hand over it, as though it might leap up and bite me.Grey was watching me, not without sympathy.You didnt know?he said.Who My voice was hoarse with shock, and I had to stop and clear my throat.Who is his mother?Grey hesitated, eyeing me closely, then shrugged slightly.Was.Shes dead.Who was she?The ripples of shock were still spreading from an epicenter in my stomach, making the crown of my head tingle and my toes go numb, but at least my vocal cords were coming back under my control.I could hear Jenny saying, Hes no the sort of man should sleep alone, aye?Evidently he wasnt.Her name was Geneva Dunsany, Grey said.My wifes sister.My mind was reeling, in an effort to make sense of all this, and I suppose I was less than tactful.Your wife?I said, goggling at him.He flushed deeply and looked away.If I had been in any doubt about the nature of the look I had seen him give Jamie, I wasnt any longer.I think you had better bloody well explain to me just what you have to do with Jamie, and this Geneva, and this boy, I said, picking up the portrait once more.He raised one brow, cool and reserved; he had been shocked, too, but the shock was wearing off.I cannot see that I am under any particular obligation to do so, he said.I fought back the urge to rake my nails down his face, but the impulse must have shown on my face, for he pushed back his chair and got his feet under him, ready to move quickly.He eyed me warily across the expanse of dark wood.I took several deep breaths, unclenched my fists, and spoke as calmly as I could.Right.Youre not.But I would appreciate it very much if you did.And why did you show me the picture if you didnt mean me to know?I added.Since I know that much, Ill certainly find out the rest from Jamie.You might as well tell me your side of it now.I glanced at the window; the slice of sky that showed between the half open shutters was still a velvet black, with no sign of dawn.Theres time.He breathed deeply, and laid down the paperweight.I suppose there is.He jerked his head abruptly at the decanter.Will you have brandy?I will, I said promptly, and I strongly suggest you have some, too.I expect you need it as much as I do.A slight smile showed briefly at the corner of his mouth.Is that a medical opinion, Mrs.Malcolm?he asked dryly.Absolutely, I said.This small truce established, he sat back, rolling his beaker of brandy slowly between his hands.You said Jamie mentioned me to you, he said.I must have flinched slightly at his use of Jamies name, for he frowned at me.Would you prefer that I referred to him by his surname?he said, coldly.I should scarcely know which to use, under the circumstances.No.I waved it away, and took a sip of brandy.Yes, he mentioned you.He said you had been the Governor of the prison at Ardsmuir, and that you were a friendand that he could trust you, I added reluctantly.Possibly Jamie felt he could trust Lord John Grey, but I was not so sanguine.The smile this time was not quite so brief.I am glad to hear that, Grey said softly.He looked down into the amber liquid in his cup, swirling it gently to release its heady bouquet.He took a sip, then set the cup down with decision.I met him at Ardsmuir, as he said, he began.And when the prison was shut down and the other prisoners sold to indenture in America, I arranged that Jamie should be paroled instead to a place in England, called Helwater, owned by friends of my family.He looked at me, hesitating, then added simply, I could not bear the thought of never seeing him again, you see.In a few brief words, he acquainted me with the bare facts of Genevas death and Willies birth.Was he in love with her?I asked.The brandy was doing its bit to warm my hands and feet, but it didnt touch the large cold object in my stomach.He has never spoken to me of Geneva, Grey said.He gulped the last of his brandy, coughed, and reached to pour another cup.It was only when he finished this operation that he looked at me again, and added, But I doubt it, having known her.His mouth twisted wryly.He never told me about Willie, either, but there was a certain amount of gossip about Geneva and old Lord Ellesmere, and by the time the boy was four or five, the resemblance made it quite clear who his father wasto anyone who cared to look.He took another deep swallow of brandy.I suspect that my mother in law knows, but of course she would never breathe a word.She wouldnt?He stared at me over the rim of his cup.No, would you?If it were a choice of your only grandchild being either the ninth Earl of Ellesmere, and heir to one of the wealthiest estates in England, or the penniless bastard of a Scottish criminal?I see.I drank some more of my own brandy, trying to imagine Jamie with a young English girl named Genevaand succeeding all too well.Quite, Grey said dryly.Jamie saw, too.And very wisely arranged to leave Helwater before it became obvious to everyone.And thats where you come back into the story, is it?I asked.He nodded, eyes closed.The Residence was quiet, though there was a certain distant stir that made me aware that people were still about.Thats right, he said.Jamie gave the boy to me.The stable at Ellesmere was well built; cozy in the winter, it was a cool haven in summer.The big bay stallion flicked its ears lazily at a passing fly, but stood stolidly content, enjoying the attentions of his groom.Isobel is most displeased with you, Grey said.Is she?Jamies voice was indifferent.There was no need any longer to worry about displeasing any of the Dunsanys.She said you had told Willie you were leaving, which upset him dreadfully.Hes been howling all day.Jamies face was turned away, but Grey saw the faint tightening at the side of his throat.He rocked backward, leaning against the stable wall as he watched the curry comb come down and down and down in hard, even strokes that left dark trails across the shimmering coat.Surely it would have been easier to say nothing to the boy?Grey said quietly.I suppose it wouldfor Lady Isobel.Fraser turned to put up the curry comb, and slapped a hand on the stallions rump in dismissal.Grey thought there was an air of finality in the gesture; tomorrow Jamie would be gone.He felt a slight thickening in his own throat, but swallowed it.He rose and followed Fraser toward the door of the stall.Jamie he said, putting his hand on Frasers shoulder.The Scot swung round, his features hastily readjusting themselves, but not fast enough to hide the misery in his eyes.He stood still, looking down at the Englishman.Youre right to go, Grey said.Alarm flared in Frasers eyes, quickly supplanted by wariness.Am I?he said.Anyone with half an eye could see it, Grey said dryly.If anyone ever actually looked at a groom, someone would have noticed long before now.He glanced back at the bay stallion, and cocked one brow.Some sires stamp their get.I have the distinct impression that any offspring of yours would be unmistakable.Jamie said nothing, but Grey fancied that he had grown a shade paler than usual.Surely you can seewell, no, perhaps not, he corrected himself, I dont suppose you have a looking glass, have you?Jamie shook his head mechanically.No, he said absently.I shave in the reflection from the trough.He drew in a deep breath, and let it out slowly.Aye, well, he said.He glanced toward the house, where the French doors were standing open onto the lawn.Willie was accustomed to play there after lunch on fine days.Fraser turned to him with sudden decision.Will ye walk with me?he said.Not pausing for an answer, he set off past the stable, turning down the lane that led from the paddock to the lower pasture.It was nearly a quarter mile before he came to a halt, in a sunny clearing by a clump of willows, near the edge of the mere.Grey found himself puffing slightly from the quick pacetoo much soft living in London, he chided himself.Fraser, of course, was not even sweating, despite the warmth of the day.Without preamble, turning to face Grey, he said, I wish to ask a favor of ye.The slanted blue eyes were direct as the man himself.If you think I would tell anyone Grey began, then shook his head.Surely you dont think I could do such a thing.After all, I have knownor at least suspectedfor some time.No.A faint smile lifted Jamies mouth.No, I dinna think ye would.But I would ask ye   Yes, Grey said promptly.The corner of Jamies mouth twitched.Ye dinna wish to know what it is first?I should imagine that I know; you wish me to look out for Willie; perhaps to send you word of his welfare.Jamie nodded.Aye, thats it.He glanced up the slope, to where the house lay half hidden in its nest of fiery maples.Its an imposition, maybe, to ask ye to come all the way from London to see him now and then.Not at all, Grey interrupted.I came this afternoon to give you some news of my own; I am to be married.Married?The shock was plain on Frasers face.To a woman?I think there are not many alternatives, Grey replied dryly.But yes, since you ask, to a woman.To the Lady Isobel.Christ, man!Ye canna do that!I can, Grey assured him.He grimaced.I made trial of my capacity in London; be assured that I shall make her an adequate husband.You neednt necessarily enjoy the act in order to perform itor perhaps you were aware of that?There was a small reflexive twitch at the corner of Jamies eye; not quite a flinch, but enough for Grey to notice.Jamie opened his mouth, then closed it again and shook his head, obviously thinking better of what he had been about to say.Dunsany is growing too old to take a hand in the running of the estate, Grey pointed out.Gordon is dead, and Isobel and her mother cannot manage the place alone.Our families have known each other for decades.It is an entirely suitable match.Is it, then?The sardonic skepticism in Jamies voice was clear.Grey turned to him, fair skin flushing as he answered sharply.It is.There is more to a marriage than carnal love.A great deal more.Fraser swung sharply away.He strode to the edge of the mere, and stood, boots sunk in the reedy mud, looking over the ruffled waves for some time.Grey waited patiently, taking the time to unribbon his hair and reorder the thick blond mass.At long last, Fraser came back, walking slowly, head down as though still thinking.Face to face with Grey he looked up again.You are right, he said quietly.I have no right to think ill of you, if ye mean no dishonor to the lady.Certainly not, Grey said.Besides, he added more cheerfully, it means I will be here permanently, to see to Willie.You mean to resign your commission, then?One copper eyebrow flicked upward.Yes, Grey said.He smiled, a little ruefully.It will be a relief, in a way.I was not meant for army life, I think.Fraser seemed to be thinking.I should begrateful, then, he said, if you would stand as stepfather toto my son.He had likely never spoken the word aloud before, and the sound of it seemed to shock him.Iwould be obliged to you.Jamie sounded as though his collar were too tight, though in fact his shirt was open at the throat.Grey looked curiously at him, and saw that his countenance was slowly turning a dark and painful red.In returnIf you wantI mean, I would be willing tothat is   Grey suppressed the sudden desire to laugh.He laid a light hand on the big Scots arm, and saw Jamie brace himself not to flinch at the touch.My dear Jamie, he said, torn between laughter and exasperation.Are you actually offering me your body in payment for my promise to look after Willie?Frasers face was red to the roots of his hair.Aye, I am, he snapped, tight lipped.Dye want it, or no?At this, Grey did laugh, in long gasping whoops, finally having to sit down on the grassy bank in order to recover himself.Oh, dear God, he said at last, wiping his eyes.That I should live to hear an offer like that!Fraser stood above him, looking down, the morning light silhouetting him, lighting his hair in flames against the pale blue sky.Grey thought he could see a slight twitch of the wide mouth in the darkened facehumor, tempered with a profound relief.Ye dinna want me, then?Grey got to his feet, dusting the seat of his breeches.I shall probably want you to the day I die, he said matter of factly.But tempted as I am He shook his head, brushing wet grass from his hands.Do you really think that I would demandor acceptany payment for such a service?he asked.Really, I should feel my honor most grossly insulted by that offer, save that I know the depth of feeling which prompted it.Aye, well, Jamie muttered.I didna mean to insult ye.Grey was not sure at this point whether to laugh or cry.Instead, he reached a hand up and gently touched Jamies cheek, fading now to its normal pale bronze.More quietly, he said, Besides, you cannot give me what you do not have.Grey felt, rather than saw, the slight relaxation of tension in the tall body facing him.You shall have my friendship, Jamie said softly, if that has any value to ye.A very great value indeed.The two men stood silent together for a moment, then Grey sighed and turned to look up at the sun.Its getting late.I suppose you will have a great many things to do today?Jamie cleared his throat.Aye, I have.I suppose I should be about my business.Yes, I suppose so.Grey tugged down the points of his waistcoat, ready to go.But Jamie lingered awkwardly a moment, and then, as though suddenly making up his mind to it, stepped forward and bending down, cupped Greys face between his hands.Grey felt the big hands warm on the skin of his face, light and strong as the brush of an eagles feather, and then Jamie Frasers soft wide mouth touched his own.There was a fleeting impression of tenderness and strength held in check, the faint taste of ale and fresh baked bread.Then it was gone, and John Grey stood blinking in the brilliant sun.Oh, he said.Jamie gave him a shy, crooked smile.Aye, well, he said.I suppose Im maybe not poisoned.He turned then, and disappeared into the screen of willows, leaving Lord John Grey alone by the mere.The Governor was quiet for a moment.Then he looked up with a bleak smile.That was the first time that he ever touched me willingly, he said quietly.And the lastuntil this evening, when I gave him the other copy of that miniature.I sat completely motionless, the brandy glass unregarded in my hands.I wasnt sure what I felt; shock, fury, horror, jealousy, and pity all washed through me in successive waves, mingling in eddies of confused emotion.A woman had been violently done to death nearby, within the last few hours.And yet the scene in the retiring room seemed unreal by comparison with that miniature; a small and unimportant picture, painted in tones of red.For the moment, neither Lord John nor I was concerned with crime or justiceor with anything beyond what lay between us.The Governor was examining my face, with considerable absorption.I suppose I should have recognized you on the ship, he said.But of course, at the time, I had thought you long dead.Well, it was dark, I said, rather stupidly.I shoved a hand through my curls, feeling dizzy from brandy and sleeplessness.Then I realized what he had said.Recognized me?But youd never met me!He hesitated, then nodded.Do you recall a dark wood, near Carryarrick in the Scottish Highlands, twenty years ago?And a young boy with a broken arm?You set it for me.He lifted one arm in demonstration.Jesus H.  Roosevelt Christ.I picked up the brandy and took a swallow that made me cough and gasp.I blinked at him, eyes watering.Knowing now who he was, I could make out the fine, light bones and see the slighter, softer outline of the boy he had been.Yours were the first womans breasts I had ever seen, he said wryly.It was a considerable shock.From which you appear to have recovered, I said, rather coldly.You seem to have forgiven Jamie for breaking your arm and threatening to shoot you, at least.He flushed slightly, and set down his beaker.Iwellyes, he said, abruptly.We sat there for quite some time, neither of us having any idea what to say.He took a breath once or twice, as though about to say something, but then abandoned it.At last, he closed his eyes as though commending his soul to God, opened them and looked at me.Do you know he began, then stopped.He looked down at his clenched hands, then, not at me.A blue stone winked on one knuckle, bright as a teardrop.Do you know, he said again, softly, addressing his hands, what it is to love someone, and nevernever!be able to give them peace, or joy, or happiness?He looked up then, eyes filled with pain.To know that you cannot give them happiness, not through any fault of yours or theirs, but only because you were not born the right person for them?I sat quiet, seeing not his, but another handsome face; dark, not fair.Not feeling the warm breath of the tropical night, but the icy hand of a Boston winter.Seeing the pulse of light like hearts blood, spilling across the cold snow of hospital linens.only because you were not born the right person for them.I know, I whispered, hands clenched in my lap.I had told FrankLeave me.But he could not, no more than I could love him rightly, having found my match elsewhere.Oh, Frank, I said, silently.Forgive me.I suppose I am asking whether you believe in fate, Lord John went on.The ghost of a smile wavered on his face.You, of all people, would seem best suited to say.Youd think so, wouldnt you?I said bleakly.But I dont know, any more than you.He shook his head, then reached out and picked up the miniature.I have been more fortunate than most, I suppose, he said quietly.There was the one thing he would take from me.His expression softened as he looked down into the face of the boy in the palm of his hand.And he has given me something most precious in return.Without thinking, my hand spread out across my belly.Jamie had given me that same precious giftand at the same great cost to himself.The sound of footsteps came down the hall, muffled by the carpet.There was a sharp rap at the door, and a militiaman stuck his head into the office.Is the lady recovered yet?he asked.Captain Jacobs has finished his questions, and Monsieur Alexandres carriage has returned.I got hastily to my feet.Yes, Im fine.I turned to the Governor, not knowing what to say to him.Ithank you forthat is  He bowed formally to me, coming around the desk to see me out.I regret extremely that you should have been subjected to such a shocking experience, maam, he said, with no trace of anything but diplomatic regret in his voice.He had resumed his official manner, smooth and polished as his parquet floors.I followed the militiaman, but at the door I turned impulsively.When we met, that night aboard the PorpoiseIm glad you didnt know who I was.Iliked you.Then.He stood for a second, polite, remote.Then the mask dropped away.I liked you, too, he said quietly.Then.I felt as though I were riding next to a stranger.The light was beginning to gray toward dawn, and even in the dimness of the coach, I could see Jamie sitting opposite me, his face drawn with weariness.He had taken off the ridiculous wig as soon as we drove away from Government House, discarding the facade of the polished Frenchman to let the disheveled Scot beneath show through.His unbound hair lay in waves over his shoulders, dark in that predawn light that robs everything of color.Do you think he did it?I asked at last, only for something to say.His eyes were closed.At this, they opened and he shrugged slightly.I dont know, he said.He sounded exhausted.I have asked myself that a thousand times tonightand been asked it even more.He rubbed his knuckles hard over his forehead.I canna imagine a man I know to do such a thing.And yetwell, ye ken hell do anything when hes drink taken.And hes killed before, drunkyoull mind the Customs man at the brothel?I nodded, and he leaned forward, elbows on his knees, sinking his head into his hands.This is different, though, he said.I canna thinkbut maybe so.Ye ken what he said about women on the ship.And if this Mrs.Alcott was to have toyed wi him  She did, I said.I saw her.He nodded without looking up.So did any number of other people.But if she led him to think she meant more than she maybe did, and then perhaps she put him off, maybe laughed at himand him fu as a puggie wi drink, and knives to hand on every wall of the place He sighed and sat up.God knows, he said bleakly.I dont.He ran a hand backward through his hair, smoothing it.Theres something else about it.I had to tell them that I scarcely knew Willoughbythat wed met him on the packet boat from Martinique, and thought it kindly to introduce him about, but didna ken a thing of where he came from, or the sort of fellow he truly was.Did they believe it?He glanced at me wryly.So far.But the packet boat comes in again in six daysat which point, theyll question the captain and discover that hes never laid eyes on Monsieur Etienne Alexandre and his wife, let alone a wee yellow murdering fiend.That might be a trifle awkward, I observed, thinking of Fergus and the militiaman.Were already rather unpopular on Mr.Willoughbys account.Nothing to what we will be, if six days pass and they havena found him, he assured me.Six days is also maybe as long as it will take for gossip to spread from Blue Mountain House to Kingston about the MacIvers visitorsfor ye ken the servants there all know who we are.Damn.He smiled briefly at that, and my heart turned over to see it.Youve a nice way wi words, Sassenach.Aye, well, all it means is that we must find Ian within six days.I shall go to Rose Hall at once, but I think I must just have a wee rest before setting out.He yawned widely behind his hand and shook his head, blinking.We didnt speak again until after we had arrived at Blue Mountain House and made our way on tiptoe through the slumbering house to our room.I changed in the dressing room, dropping the heavy stays on the floor with relief, and taking out the pins to let my hair fall free.Wearing only a silk chemise, I came into the bedroom, to see Jamie standing by the French door in his shirt, looking out over the lagoon.He turned when he heard me, and beckoned, putting a finger to his lips.Come see, he whispered.There was a small herd of manatees in the lagoon, big gray bodies gliding under the dark crystal water, rising gleaming like smooth, wet rocks.Birds were beginning to call in the trees near the house; besides this, the only sound was the frequent whoosh of the manatees breath as they rose for air, and now and then an eerie sound like a hollow, distant wail, as they called to each other.We watched them in silence, side by side.The lagoon began to turn green as the first rays of sun touched its surface.In that state of extreme fatigue where every sense is preternaturally heightened, I was as aware of Jamie as though I were touching him.John Greys revelations had relieved me of most of my fears and doubtsand yet there remained the fact that Jamie had not told me about his son.Of course he had reasonsand good onesfor his secrecy, but did he not think he could trust me to keep his secret?It occurred to me suddenly that perhaps he had kept quiet because of the boys mother.Perhaps he had loved her, in spite of Greys impressions.She was dead; could it matter if he had?The answer was that it did.I had thought Jamie dead for twenty years, and it had made no difference at all in what I felt for him.What if he had loved this young English girl in such a way?I swallowed a small lump in my throat, trying to find the courage to ask him.His face was abstracted, a small frown creasing his forehead, despite the dawning beauty of the lagoon.What are you thinking?I asked at last, unable to ask for reassurance, fearing to ask for the truth.Its only that I had a thought, he answered, still staring out at the manatees.About Willoughby, aye?The events of the night seemed far away and unimportant.Yet murder had been done.What was that?Well, I couldna think at first that Willoughby could do such a thinghow could any man?He paused, drawing a finger through the light mist of condensation that formed on the windowpanes as the sun rose.And yet He turned to face me.Perhaps I can see.His face was troubled.He was aloneverra much alone.A stranger, in a strange land, I said quietly, remembering the poems, painted in the open secrecy of bold black ink, sent flying toward a long lost home, committed to the sea on wings of white paper.Aye, thats it.He stopped to think, rubbing a hand slowly through his hair, gleaming copper in the new daylight.And when a man is alone that waywell, its maybe no decent to say it, but making love to a woman is maybe the only thing will make him forget it for a time.He looked down, turning his hands over, stroking the length of his scarred middle finger with the index finger of his left hand.Thats what made me wed Laoghaire, he said quietly.Not Jennys nagging.Not pity for her or the wee lassies.Not even a pair of aching balls.His mouth turned up briefly at one corner, then relaxed.Only needing to forget I was alone, he finished softly.He turned restlessly, back to the window.So I am thinking that if the Chinee came to her, wanting thatneeding thatand she wouldna take him He shrugged, staring out across the cool green of the lagoon.Aye, maybe he could have done it, he said.I stood beside him.Out in the center of the lagoon, a single manatee drifted lazily to the surface, turning on her back to hold the infant on her chest toward the sunlight.He was silent for several minutes, and I was as well, not knowing how to take the conversation back to what I had seen and heard at Government House.I felt rather than saw him swallow, and he turned from the window to face me.There were lines of tiredness in his face, but his expression was filled with a sort of determinationthe sort of look he wore facing battle.Claire, he said, and at once I stiffened.He called me by my name only when he was most serious.Claire, I must tell ye something.What?I had been trying to think how to ask, but suddenly I didnt want to hear.I took half a step back, away from him, but he grabbed my arm.He had something hidden in his fist.He took my unresisting hand and put the object into it.Without looking, I knew what it was; I could feel the carving of the delicate oval frame and the slight roughness of the painted surface.Claire.I could see the slight tremor at the side of his throat as he swallowed.ClaireI must tell ye.I have a son.I didnt say anything, but opened my hand.There it was; the same face I had seen in Greys office, a childish, cocky version of the man before me.I should ha told ye before.He was searching my face for some clue to my feelings, but for once, my giveaway countenance must have been perfectly blank.I would haveonly He took a deep breath for strength to go on.I havena ever told anyone about him, he said.Not even Jenny.That startled me enough to speak.Jenny doesnt know?He shook his head, and turned away to watch the manatees.Alarmed by our voices, they had retreated a short distance, but then had settled down again, feeding on the water weed at the edge of the lagoon.It was in England.ItshesI couldna say he was mine.Hes a bastard, aye?It might have been the rising sun that flushed his cheeks.He bit his lip and went on.I havena seen him since he was a wee lad.I never will see him againexcept it might be in a wee painting like this.He took the small picture from me, cradling it in the palm of his hand like a babys head.He blinked, head bent over it.I was afraid to tell ye, he said, low voiced.For fear ye would think that perhaps Id gone about spawning a dozen bastardsfor fear yed think that I wouldna care for Brianna so much, if ye kent I had another child.But I do care, Clairea great deal more than I can tell ye.He lifted his head and looked directly at me.Will ye forgive me?Did you The words almost choked me, but I had to say them.Did you love her?An extraordinary expression of sadness crossed his face, but he didnt look away.No, he said softly.Shewanted me.I should have found a wayshould have stopped her, but I could not.She wished me to lie wi her.And I did, andshe died of it.He did look down then, long lashes hiding his eyes.I am guilty of her death, before God; perhaps the more guiltybecause I did not love her.I didnt say anything, but put up a hand to touch his cheek.He pressed his own hand over it, hard, and closed his eyes.There was a gecko on the wall beside us, nearly the same color as the yellow plaster behind it, beginning to glow in the gathering daylight.What is he like?I asked softly.Your son?He smiled slightly, without opening his eyes.Hes spoilt and stubborn, he said softly.Ill mannered.Loud.Wi a wicked temper.He swallowed.And braw and bonny and canty and strong, he said, so softly I could barely hear him.And yours, I said.His hand tightened on mine, holding it against the soft stubble of his cheek.And mine, he said.He took a deep breath, and I could see the glitter of tears under his closed lids.You should have trusted me, I said at last.He nodded, slowly, then opened his eyes, still holding my hand.Perhaps I should, he said quietly.And yet I kept thinkinghow should I tell ye everything, about Geneva, and Willie, and Johnwill ye know about John?He frowned slightly, then relaxed as I nodded.He told me.About everything.His brows rose, but he went on.Especially after ye found out about Laoghaire.How could I tell ye, and expect ye to know the difference?What difference?GenevaWillies mothershe wanted my body, he said softly, watching the geckos pulsing sides.Laoghaire needed my name, and the work of my hands to keep her and her bairns.He turned his head then, dark blue eyes fixed on mine.Johnwell.He lifted his shoulders and let them drop.I couldna give him what he wantedand he is friend enough not to ask it.But how shall I tell ye all these things, he said, the line of his mouth twisting.And then say to youit is only you I have ever loved?How should you believe me?The question hung in the air between us, shimmering like the reflection from the water below.If you say it, I said, Ill believe you.You will?He sounded faintly astonished.Why?Because youre an honest man, Jamie Fraser, I said, smiling so that I wouldnt cry.And may the Lord have mercy on you for it.Only you, he said, so softly I could barely hear him.To worship ye with my body, give ye all the service of my hands.To give ye my name, and all my heart and soul with it.Only you.Because ye will not let me lieand yet ye love me.I did touch him then.Jamie, I said softly, and laid my hand on his arm.You arent alone anymore.He turned then and took me by the arms, searching my face.I swore to you, I said.When we married.I didnt mean it then, but I sworeand now I mean it.I turned his hand over in both mine, feeling the thin, smooth skin at the base of his wrist, where the pulse beat under my fingers, where the blade of his dirk had cut his flesh once, and spilled his blood to mingle with mine forever.I pressed my own wrist against his, pulse to pulse, heartbeat to heartbeat.Blood of my blood I whispered.Bone of my bone.His whisper was deep and husky.He knelt quite suddenly before me, and put his folded hands in mine; the gesture a Highlander makes when swearing loyalty to his chieftain.I give ye my spirit, he said, head bent over our hands.Til our life shall be done, I said softly.But it isnt done yet, Jamie, is it?Then he rose and took the shift from me, and I lay back on the narrow bed naked, pulled him down to me through the soft yellow light, and took him home, and home, and home again, and we were neither one of us alone.60  THE SCENT OF GEMSTONES  Rose Hall was ten miles out of Kingston, up a steep and winding road of reddish dust that led into blue mountains.The road was overgrown, so narrow that we must ride in single file most of the way.I followed Jamie through the dark, sweet scented caverns of cedar boughs, under trees nearly a hundred feet high.Huge ferns grew in the shade below, the fiddleheads nearly the size of real violin necks.Everything was quiet, save for the calling of birds in the shrubberyand even that fell silent as we passed.Jamies horse stopped dead, once, and backed up, snorting; we waited as a tiny green snake wriggled across the path and into the undergrowth.I looked after it, but could see no farther than ten feet from the edge of the road; everything beyond was cool green shadow.I half hoped that Mr.Willoughby had come this wayno one would ever find him, in a place like this.The Chinaman had not been found in spite of an intensive search of the town by the island militia.The special detachment of marines from the barracks on Antigua was expected to arrive tomorrow.In the meantime, every house in Kingston was shut up like a bank vault, the owners armed to the teeth.The mood of the town was thoroughly dangerous.Like the naval officers; it was the militia colonels opinion that if the Chinaman were found, he would be lucky to survive long enough to be hanged.Be torn to pieces, I expect, Colonel Jacobs had said as he escorted us from the Residence on the night of the murder.Have his balls ripped off and thrust down his stinking throat, I daresay, he added, with obvious grim satisfaction at the thought.I daresay, Jamie had murmured in French, assisting me into the carriage.I knew that the question of Mr.Willoughby was still troubling him; he had been quiet and thoughtful on the ride through the mountains.And yet there was nothing we could do.If the little Chinese was innocent, we could not save him; if he was guilty, we could not give him up.The best we might hope for was that he would not be found.And in the meantime, we had five days to find Young Ian.If he were indeed at Rose Hall, all might be well.If he were not   A fence and small gate marked the division of the plantation from the surrounding forest.Inside, the ground had been cleared, and planted in sugarcane and coffee.Some distance from the house, on a separate rise, a large, plain, mud daub building stood, roofed with palm thatch.Dark skinned people were going in and out, and the faint, cloying scent of burnt sugar hung over the place.Below the refineryor so I assumed the building to bestood a large sugar press.A primitive looking affair, this consisted of a pair of huge timbers crossed in the shape of an X, set on an enormous spindle, surmounting the boxlike body of the press.Two or three men were clambering over the press, but it was not working at present; the oxen who drove it were hobbled some distance away, grazing.How do they ever get the sugar down from here?I asked curiously, thinking of the narrow trail we had come up.On mules?I brushed cedar needles off the shoulders of my coat, making myself presentable.No, Jamie answered absently.They send it down the river on barges.The rivers just over there, down the wee pass ye can see beyond the house.He pointed with his chin, reining up with one hand, and using the other to beat the dust of travel from the skirts of his coat.Ready, Sassenach?As Ill ever be.Rose Hall was a two storied house; long and graciously proportioned, with a roof laid in expensive slates, rather than in the sheets of tin that covered most of the planters residences.A long veranda ran all along one side of the house, with long windows and French doors opening on to it.A great yellow rosebush grew by the front door, climbing on a trellis and spilling over the edge of the roof.The scent of its perfume was so heady that it made breathing difficult; or perhaps it was only excitement that made my breath come short and stick in my throat.I glanced around as we waited for the door to be answered, trying to catch a glimpse of any white skinned figure near the sugar refinery above.Yes, sah?A middle aged slave woman opened the door, looking out curiously at us.She was wide bodied, dressed in a white cotton smock, with a red turban wrapped round her head, and her skin was the deep, rich gold in the heart of the flowers on the trellis.Mr.and Mrs.Malcolm, to call upon Mrs.Abernathy, if ye please, Jamie said politely.The woman looked rather taken aback, as though callers were not a common occurrence, but after a moments indecision, she nodded and stepped back, swinging the door wide.You be waitin in the salon, please, sah, she said, in a soft lilt that made it sallong.I be askin the mistress will she see you.It was a large room, long and graciously proportioned, lit by huge casement windows all down one side.At the far end of the room was the fireplace, an enormous structure with a stone overmantel and a hearth of polished slates that occupied nearly the whole wall.You could have roasted an ox in it without the slightest difficulty, and the presence of a large spit suggested that the owner of the house did so on occasion.The slave had shown us to a wicker sofa and invited us to be seated.I sat, looking about, but Jamie strolled restlessly about the room, peering through the windows that gave a view of the cane fields below the house.It was an odd room; comfortably furnished with wicker and rattan furniture, well equipped with fat, soft cushions, but ornamented with small, uncommon curios.On one window ledge sat a row of silver handbells, graduated from small to large.Several squat figures of stone and terra cotta sat together on the table by my elbow; some sort of primitive fetishes or idols.All of them were in the shape of women, hugely pregnant, or with enormous, rounded breasts and exaggerated hips, and all with a vivid and mildly disturbing sexuality about them.It was not a prudish age, by any means, but I wouldnt have expected to find such objects in a drawing room in any age.Somewhat more orthodox were the Jacobite relics.A silver snuffbox, a glass flagon, a decorated fan, a large serving plattereven the large woven rug on the floor; all decorated with the square white rose of the Stuarts.That wasnt so odda great many Jacobites who had fled Scotland after Culloden had come to the West Indies to seek the repair of their fortunes.I found the sight encouraging.A householder with Jacobite sympathies might be welcoming to a fellow Scot, and willing to oblige in the matter of Ian.If hes here, a small voice in my head warned.Steps sounded in the inner part of the house, and there was a flutter at the door by the hearth.Jamie made a small grunting sound, as though someone had hit him, and I looked up, to see the mistress of the house step into the room.I rose to my feet, and the small silver cup I had picked up fell to the floor with a clank.Kept your girlish figure, I see, Claire.Her head was tilted to one side, green eyes gleaming with amusement.I was too paralyzed with surprise to respond aloud, but the thought drifted through my stunned mind that I couldnt say the same for her.Geillis Duncan had always had a voluptuous abundance of creamy bosom and a generous swell of rounded hip.While still creamy skinned, she was considerably more abundant and generous, in every dimension visible.She wore a loose muslin gown, under which the soft, thick flesh wobbled and swayed as she moved.The delicate bones of her face had long since been submerged in swelling plumpness, but the brilliant green eyes were the same, filled with malice and humor.I took a deep breath, and got my voice back.I trust you wont take this the wrong way, I said, sinking slowly back onto the wicker sofa, but why arent you dead?She laughed, the silver in her voice as clear as a young girls.Think I should have been, do you?Well, youre no the firstand I daresay youll not be the last to think so, either.Eyes creased to bright green triangles by amusement, she sank into her own chair, nodded casually to Jamie, and clapped her hands sharply to summon a servant.Shall we have a dish of tea?she asked me.Do, and Ill read the leaves in your cup for ye, after.Ive a reputation as a reader, after all; a fine teller o the future, to be sureand why not?She laughed again, plump cheeks pinkening with mirth.If she had been as shocked by my appearance as I was at hers, she disguised it masterfully.Tea, she said, to the black maidservant who appeared in response to the summons.The special kind in the blue tin, aye?And the bittie cakes wi the nuts in, too.Youll take a bite?she asked, turning back to me.Tis something of an occasion, after all.I did wonder, she said, tilting her head to one side, like a gull judging the chances of snatching a fish, whether our paths might cross again, after that day at Cranesmuir.My heart was beginning to slow, the shock overcome in a great wave of curiosity.I could feel the questions bubbling up by the dozens, and picked one off the top at random.Did you know me?I asked.When you met me in Cranesmuir?She shook her head, the strands of cream white hair coming loose from their pins and sliding down her neck.She poked haphazardly at her knot, still surveying me with interest.Not at the first, no.Though sure and I thought there was a great strangeness about yenot that I was the only one to think that.Ye didna come through the stones prepared, did ye?Not on purpose, I mean?I bit back the words, Not that time, and said instead, No, it was an accident.You came on purpose, thoughfrom 1967?She nodded, studying me intently.The thickened flesh between her brows was creased, and the crease deepened slightly as she looked at me.Ayeto help Prince Tearlach.Her mouth twisted to one side, as though she tasted something bad, and quite suddenly, she turned her head and spat.The globule of saliva hit the polished wooden floor with an audible plop.An gealtaire salach Atailteach!she said.Filthy Italian coward!Her eyes darkened and shone with no pleasant light.Had I known, I should have made my way to Rome and killed him, while there was time.His brother Henry might ha been no better, thougha ballock less, sniveling priest, that one.Not that it made a difference.After Culloden, any Stuart would be as useless as another.She sighed, and shifted her bulk, the rattan of the chair creaking beneath her.She waved a hand impatiently, dismissing the Stuarts.Still, thats done with for now.Ye came by accidentwalked through the stones near the date of a Fire Feast, did ye?Thats how it usually happens.Yes, I said, startled.I came through on Beltane.But what do you mean, usually happens?Have you met a great many otherslikeus?I ended hesitantly.She shook her head rather absently.Not many.She seemed to be pondering something, though perhaps it was only the absence of her refreshments; she picked up the silver bell and rang it violently.Damn that Clotilda!Like us?she said, returning to the question at hand.No, I havent.Only one besides you, that I ken.Ye could ha knocked me over wi a feather, when I saw the wee scar on your arm, and kent ye for one like myself.She touched the great swell of her own upper arm, where the small vaccination scar lay hidden beneath the puff of white muslin.She tilted her head in that bird like way again, surveying me with one bright green eye.No, when I said thats how it usually happens, I meant, judging from the stories.Folk who disappear in fairy rings and the stone circles, I mean.They usually walk through near Beltane or Samhain; a few near the Sun FeastsMidsummers Day or the winter solstice.Thats what the list was!I said suddenly, reminded of the gray notebook I had left with Roger Wakefield.You had a list of dates and initialsnearly two hundred of them.I didnt know what they were, but I saw that the dates were mostly in late April or early May, or near the end of October.Aye, thats right.She nodded, eyes still fixed on me in speculation.So ye found my wee book?Is that how ye knew to come and look for me on Craigh na Dun?It was you, no?That shouted my name, just before I stepped through the stones?Gillian, I said, and saw her pupils widen at the name that had once been hers, though her face stayed smooth.Gillian Edgars.Yes, it was me.I didnt know if you saw me in the dark.I could see in memory the night black circle of stonesand in the center, the blazing bonfire, and the figure of a slim girl standing by it, pale hair flying in the heat of the fire.I didnt see ye, she said.Twas only later, when I heard ye call out at the witch trial and thought Id heard your voice before.And then, when I saw the mark on your arm She shrugged massively, the muslin tight across her shoulders as she settled back.Who was with ye, that night?she asked curiously.There were two I sawa bonnie dark lad, and a girl.She closed her eyes, concentrating, then opened them again to stare at me.Later on, I thought I kent herbut I couldna put a name to her, though I could swear Id seen the face.Who was she?Mistress Duncan?Or is it Mistress Abernathy, now?Jamie interrupted, stepping forward and bowing to her formally.The first shock of her appearance was fading, but he was still pale, his cheekbones prominent under the stretched skin of his face.She glanced at him, then looked again, as though noticing him for the first time.Well, and if its no the wee fox cub!she said, looking amused.She looked him carefully up and down, noting every detail of his appearance with interest.Grown to a bonny man, have ye no?she said.She leaned back in the chair, which creaked loudly under her weight, and squinted appraisingly at him.Youve the look of the MacKenzies about ye, laddie.Ye always did, but now youre older, youve the look of both your uncles in your face.I am sure both Dougal and Colum would be pleased yed remember them so well.Jamies eyes were fixed on her as intently as hers on him.He had never liked herand was unlikely to change his opinion nowbut he could not afford to antagonize her; not if she had Ian here somewhere.The arrival of the tea interrupted whatever reply she might have made.Jamie moved to my side, and sat with me on the sofa, while Geilie carefully poured the tea and handed us each a cup, behaving exactly like a conventional hostess at a tea party.As though wishing to preserve this illusion, she offered the sugar bowl and milk jug, and sat back to make light conversation.If ye dinna mind my asking, Mrs.Abernathy, Jamie said, how did ye come to this place?Politely left unspoken was the larger questionHow did you escape being burned as a witch?She laughed, lowering her long lashes coquettishly over her eyes.Well, and yell maybe recall I was wi child, back at Cranesmuir?I seem to recall something of the sort.Jamie took a sip of his tea, the tips of his ears turning slightly pink.He had cause to remember that, all right; she had torn off her clothes in the midst of the witch trial, disclosing the secret bulge that would save her lifeat least temporarily.A small pink tongue poked out and delicately skimmed the tea droplets from her upper lip.Have ye had children yourself?she asked, cocking an eyebrow at me.I have.Terrible chore, isnt it?Dragging about like a mud caked sow, and then being ripped apart for the sake of something looks like a drowned rat.She shook her head, making a low noise of disgust in her throat.The beauty o motherhood, is it?Still, I should not complain, I suppose the wee ratling saved my life for me.And wretched as childbirth is, its better than being burnt at the stake.Id suppose so, I said, though not having tried the latter, I couldnt say for sure.Geillis choked in her tea, spraying brown droplets over the front of her dress.She mopped at them carelessly, eyeing me with amusement.Well, Ive not done it either, but Ive seen them burn, poppet.And I think perhaps even lyin in a muddy hole watching your belly grow is better than that.They kept you in the thieves hole all the time?The silver spoon was cool in my hand, but my palm grew sweaty at the memory of the thieves hole in Cranesmuir.I had spent three days there with Geillis Duncan, accused as a witch.How long had she stayed there?Three months, she said, staring meditatively into her tea.Three mortal months of frozen feet and crawling vermin, stinking scraps of food and the grave smell clinging to my skin day and night.She looked up then, mouth twisting in bitter amusement.But I bore the child in style, at the end.When my pains began, they took me from the holelittle chance Id run then, aye?and the babe was born in my own old bedroom; in the fiscals house.Her eyes were slightly clouded, and I wondered whether the liquid in her glass was entirely tea.I had diamond paned windows, do ye recall?All in shades of purple and green and whitethe finest house in the village.She smiled reminiscently.They gave me the bairn to hold, and the green light fell over his face.He looked as though he was drowned indeed.I thought he should be cold to the touch, like a corpse, but he wasnt; he was warm.Warm as his fathers balls.She laughed suddenly, an ugly sound.Why are men such fools?Ye can lead them anywhere by the cockfor a while.Then give them a son and ye have them by the balls again.But its all ye are to them, whether theyre coming in or going outa cunt.She was leaning back in her chair.At this, she spread her thighs wide, and hoisted her glass in ironic toast above her pubic bone, squinting down across the swelling bulge of belly.Well, heres to it, I say!Most powerful thing in the world.The niggers know that, at least.She took a deep, careless swig of her drink.They carve wee idols, all belly and cunt and breasts.Same as men do where we came fromyou and I.  She squinted at me, teeth bared in amusement.Seen the dirty mags men buy under the counters then, aye?The bloodshot green eyes swiveled to Jamie.And youll know the pictures and the books the men pass about among themselves in Paris now, wont ye, fox?Its all the same.She waved a hand and drank again, deeply.The only difference is the niggers have the decency to worship it.Verra perceptive of them, Jamie said calmly.He was sitting back in his chair, long legs stretched out in apparent relaxation, but I could see the tension in the fingers of the hand that gripped his own cup.And how dye ken the pictures men look at in Paris, MistressAbernathy, is it now?She might be tipsy, but was by no means fuddled.She looked up sharply at the tone of his voice, and gave him a twisted smile.Oh, Mistress Abernathy will do well enough.When I lived in Paris, I had another nameMadame Melisande Robicheaux.Like that one?I thought it a bit grand, but your uncle Dougal gave it me, so I kept itout of sentiment.My free hand curled into a fist, out of sight in the folds of my skirt.I had heard of Madame Melisande, when we lived in Paris.Not a part of society, she had had some fame as a seer of the future; ladies of the court consulted her in deepest secrecy, for advice on their love lives, their investments, and their pregnancies.I imagine you could have told the ladies some interesting things, I said dryly.Her laugh this time was truly amused.Oh, I could, indeed!Seldom did, though.Folk dont usually pay for the truth, ye know.Sometimes, thoughdid ye ken that Jean Paul Marats mother meant to name her bairn Rudolphe?I told her I thought Rudolphe was ill omened.I wondered now and then about thatwould he grow up a revolutionary with a name like Rudolphe, or would he take it all out in writing poems, instead?Ever think that, foxthat a name might make a difference?Her eyes were fixed on Jamie, green glass.Often, he said, and set down his cup.It was Dougal got ye away from Cranesmuir, then?She nodded, stifling a small belch.Aye.He came to take the babealone, for fear someone would find out he was the father, aye?I wouldna let it go, though.And when he came near to wrest it from mewhy, I snatched the dirk from his belt and pressed it to the childs throat.A small smile of satisfaction at the memory curved her lovely lips.Told him Id kill it, sure, unless he swore on his brothers life and his own soul to get me safe away.And he believed you?I felt mildly ill at the thought of any mother holding a knife to the throat of her newborn child, even in pretense.Her gaze swiveled back to me.Oh, yes, she said softly, and the smile widened.He knew me, did Dougal.Sweating, even in the chill of December, and unable to take his eyes off the tiny face of his sleeping son, Dougal had agreed.When he leaned over me to take the child, I thought of plunging the dirk into his own throat instead, she said, reminiscently.But it would have been a good deal harder to get away by myself, so I didnt.Jamies expression didnt change, but he picked up his tea and took a deep swallow.Dougal had summoned the locksman, John MacRae, and the church sexton, and by means of discreet bribery, insured that the hooded figure dragged on a hurdle to the pitch barrel next morning would not be that of Geillis Duncan.I thought theyd use straw, maybe, she said, but he was a cleverer man than that.Auld Grannie Joan MacKenzie had died three days before, and was meant to be burying that same afternoon.A few rocks in the coffin and the lid nailed down tight, and Bobs your uncle, eh?A real body, fine for burning.She laughed, and gulped the last swallow of her drink.Not everyones seen their own funeral; fewer still ha seen their own execution, aye?It had been the dead of winter, and the small grove of rowan trees outside the village stood bare, drifted with their own dead leaves, the dried red berries showing here and there on the ground like spots of blood.It was a cloudy day, with the promise of sleet or snow, but the whole village turned out nonetheless; a witch burning was not an event to be missed.The village priest, Father Bain, had died himself three months before, of fever brought on by a festering sore, but a new priest had been imported for the occasion from a village nearby.Perfuming his way with a censer held before him, the priest had come down the path to the grove, chanting the service for the dead.Behind him came the locksman and his two assistants, dragging the hurdle and its black robed burden.I expect Grannie Joan would have been pleased, Geilie said, white teeth gleaming at the vision.She couldna have expected more nor four or five people to her buryingas it was, she had the whole village, and the incense and special prayers to boot!MacRae had untied the body and carried it, lolling, to the barrel of pitch ready waiting.The court granted me the mercy to be weirrit before the burning, Geillis explained ironically.So they expected the body to be deadno difficulty there, if I was strangled already.The only thing anyone might ha seen was that Grannie Joan weighed half what I did, newly delivered as I was, but no one seemed to notice she was light in MacRaes arms.You were there?I said.She nodded smugly.Oh, aye.Well muffled in a cloakeveryone was, because o the weatherbut I wouldna have missed it.As the priest finished his last prayer against the evils of enchantment, MacRae had taken the pine torch from his assistant and stepped forward.God, omit not this woman from Thy covenant, and the many evils that she in the body committed, he had said, and flung the fire into the pitch.It was faster than I thought it would be, Geillis said, sounding mildly surprised.A great whoosh!of firethere was a blast of hot air and a cheer from the crowd, and naught to be seen but the flames, shooting up high enough to singe the rowan branches overhead.The fire had subsided within a minute, though, and the dark figure within was clear enough to be seen through the pale daylight flames.The hood and the hair had burned away with the first scorching rush, and the face itself was burned beyond recognition.A few moments more, and the clean dark shapes of the bones emerged from the melted flesh, an airy superstructure rising above the charring barrel.Only great empty holes where her eyes had been, she said.The moss green eyes turned toward me, clouded by memory.I thought perhaps she was looking at me.But then the skull exploded, and it was all over, and folk began to come awayall except a few who stayed in hopes of picking up a bit of bone as a keepsake.She rose and went unsteadily to the small table near the window.She picked up the silver bell and rang it, hard.Aye, she said, her back turned to us.Childbirth is maybe easier.So Dougal got ye away to France, Jamie said.The fingers of his right hand twitched slightly.How came ye here to the West Indies?Oh, that was later, she said carelessly.After Culloden.She turned then, and smiled from Jamie to me.And what might bring the two of ye here to this place?Surely not the pleasure of my company?I glanced at Jamie, seeing the slight tensing of his back as he sat up straighter.His face stayed calm, though, only his eyes bright with wariness.Weve come to seek a young kinsman of mine, he said.My nephew, Ian Murray.Weve some reason to think he is indentured here.Geilies pale brows rose high, making soft ridges in her forehead.Ian Murray?she said, and shook her head in puzzlement.Ive no indentured whites at all, here.No whites, come to that.The only free man on the place is the overseer, and hes what they call a griffone; one quarter black.Unlike me, Geillis Duncan was a very good liar.Impossible to tell, from her expression of mild interest, whether she had ever heard the name Ian Murray before.But lying she was, and I knew it.Jamie knew it, too; the expression that flashed through his eyes was not disappointment, but fury, quickly suppressed.Indeed?he said politely.And are ye not fearful, then, alone wi your slaves here, so far from town?Oh, no.Not at all.She smiled broadly at him, then lifted her double chin and waggled it gently in the direction of the terrace behind him.I turned my head, and saw that the French door was filled from jamb to doorpost with an immense black man, several inches taller than Jamie, from whose rolled up shirt sleeves protruded arms like tree trunks, knotted with muscle.Meet Hercules, Geilie said, with a tiny laugh.He has a twin brother, too.Named Atlas, by chance?I asked, with an edge to my voice.You guessed!Is she no the clever one, eh, fox?She winked conspiratorially at Jamie, the rounded flesh of her cheek wobbling with the movement.The light caught her from the side as she turned her head, and I saw the red spiderwebs of tiny broken capillaries that netted her jowls.Hercule took no note of this, or of anything else.His broad face was slack and dull, and there was no life in the deep sunk eyes beneath the bony brow ridge.It gave me a very uneasy feeling to look at him, and not only because of his threatening size; looking at him was like passing by a haunted house, where something lurks behind blind windows.That will do, Hercule; ye can go back to work now.Geilie picked up the silver bell and tinkled it gently, once.Without a word, the giant turned and lumbered off the veranda.I have no fear o the slaves, she explained.Theyre afraid o me, for they think Im a witch.Verra funny, considering, is it not?Her eyes twinkled behind little pouches of fat.Geiliethat man.I hesitated, feeling ridiculous in asking such a question.Hes not aa zombie?She laughed delightedly at that, clapping her hands together.Christ, a zombie?Jesus, Claire!She chortled with glee, a bright pink rising from throat to hair roots.Well, Ill tell ye, hes no verra bright, she said at last, still gasping and wheezing.But hes no dead, either!and went off into further gales of laughter.Jamie stared at me, puzzled.Zombie?Never mind, I said, my face nearly as pink as Geilies.How many slaves have you got here?I asked, wanting to change the subject.Hee hee, she said, winding down into giggles.Oh, a hundred or so.Its no such a big place.Only three hundred acres in cane, and a wee bit of coffee on the upper slopes.She pulled a lace trimmed handkerchief from her pocket and patted her damp face, sniffing a bit as she regained her composure.I could feel, rather than see, Jamies tension.I was sure he was as convinced as I that Geilie knew something about Ian Murrayif nothing else, she had betrayed no surprise whatever at our appearance.Someone had told her about us, and that someone could only be Ian.The thought of threatening a woman to extract information wasnt one that would come naturally to Jamie, but it would to me.Unfortunately, the presence of the twin pillars of Hercules had put a stop to that line of thought.The next best idea seemed to be to search the house and grounds for any trace of the boy.Three hundred acres was a fair piece of ground, but if he was on the property, he would likely be in or near the buildingsthe house, the sugar refinery, or the slave quarters.I came out of my thoughts to realize that Geilie had asked me a question.Whats that?I said, she repeated patiently, that ye had a great deal of talent for the healing when I knew ye in Scotland; youll maybe know more now?I expect I might.I looked her over cautiously.Did she want my skill for herself?She wasnt healthy; a glance at her mottled complexion and the dark circles beneath her eyes was enough to show that.But was she actively ill?Not for me, she said, seeing my look.Not just now, anyway.Ive two slaves gone sick.Maybe yed be so kind as to look at them?I glanced at Jamie, who gave me the shadow of a nod.It was a chance to get into the slave quarters and look for Ian.I saw when we came in as ye had a bit of trouble wi your sugar press, he said, rising abruptly.He gave Geilie a cool nod.Perhaps I shall have a look at it, whilst you and my wife tend the sick.Without waiting for an answer, he took off his coat and hung it on the peg by the door.He went out by the veranda, rolling up the sleeves of his shirt, sunlight glinting on his hair.A handy sort, is he?Geilie looked after him, amused.My husband Barnabas was that sortcouldna keep his hands off any kind of machine.Or off the slave girls, either, she added.Come along, the sick ones are back o the kitchen.The kitchen was in a separate small building of its own, connected to the house by a breezeway covered with blooming jasmine.Walking through it was like floating through a cloud of perfume, surrounded by a hum of bees loud enough to be felt on the skin, like the low drone of a bagpipe.Ever been stung?Geillis swiped casually at a low flying furry body, batting it out of the air.Now and then.So have I, she said.Any number of times, and nothing worse than a red welt on my skin to show for it.One of these wee buggers stung one o the kitchen slaves last spring, though, and the wench swelled up like a toad and died, right before my eyes!She glanced at me, eyes wide and mocking.Did wonders for my reputation, I can tell ye.The rest o the slaves put it about Id witched the lass; put a spell on her to kill her for burning the sponge cake.I havena had so much as a scorched pot, since.Shaking her head, she waved away another bee.While appalled at her callousness, I was somewhat relieved by the story.Perhaps the other gossip I had heard at the Governors ball had as little foundation in fact.I paused, looking out through the jasmines lacy leaves at the cane fields below.Jamie was in the clearing by the sugar press, looking up at the gigantic crossbars of the machine while a man I assumed to be the overseer pointed and explained.As I watched, he said something, gesturing, and the overseer nodded emphatically, waving his hands in voluble reply.If I didnt find any trace of Ian in the kitchen quarters, perhaps Jamie would learn something from the overseer.Despite Geilies denials, every instinct I had insisted that the boy was heresomewhere.There was no sign of him in the kitchen itself; only three or four women, kneading bread and snapping peas, who looked up curiously as we came through.I caught the eye of one young woman, and nodded and smiled at her; perhaps I would have a chance to come back and talk, later.Her eyes widened in surprise, and she bent her head at once, eyes on the bowl of peapods in her lap.I saw her steal a quick glance at me as we crossed the long room, and noticed that she balanced the bowl in front of the small bulge of an early pregnancy.The first sick slave was in a small pantry off the kitchen itself, lying on a pallet laid under shelves stacked high with gauze wrapped cheeses.The patient, a young man in his twenties, sat up blinking at the sudden ray of light when I opened the door.Whats the trouble with him?I knelt down beside the man and touched his skin.Warm, damp, no apparent fever.He didnt seem in any particular distress, merely blinking sleepily as I examined him.He has a worm.I glanced at Geilie in surprise.From what I had seen and heard so far in the islands, I thought it likely that at least three quarters of the black populationand not a few of the whitessuffered from internal parasites.Nasty and debilitating as these could be, though, most were actively threatening only to the very young and the very old.Probably a lot more than one, I said.I pushed the slave gently onto his back and began to palpate his stomach.The spleen was tender and slightly enlargedalso a common finding herebut I felt no suspicious masses in the abdomen that might indicate a major intestinal infestation.He seems moderately healthy; why have you got him in here in the dark?As though in answer to my question, the slave suddenly wrenched himself away from my hand, let out a piercing scream, and rolled up into a ball.Rolling and unrolling himself like a yo yo, he reached the wall and began to bang his head against it, still screaming.Then, as suddenly as the fit had come on, it passed off, and the young man sank back onto the pallet, panting heavily and soaked with sweat.Jesus H.  Roosevelt Christ, I said.What was that?A loa loa worm, Geilie said, looking amused at my reaction.They live in the eyeballs, just under the lining.They cross back and forth, from one eye to the other, and when they go across the bridge o the nose, Im told its rather painful.She nodded at the slave, still quivering slightly on his pallet.The dark keeps them from moving so much, she explained.The fellow from Andros who told me about them says ye must catch them when theyve just come in one eye, for theyre right near the surface, and ye can lift them out with a big darning needle.If ye wait, they go deeper, and ye canna get them.She turned back to the kitchen and shouted for a light.Here, I brought the needle, just in case.She groped in the bag at her waist and drew out a square of felt, with a three inch steel needle thrust through it, which she extended helpfully to me.Are you out of your mind?I stared at her, appalled.No.Did ye not say ye were a good healer?she asked reasonably.I am, but I glanced at the slave, hesitated, then took the candle one of the kitchenmaids was holding out to me.Bring me some brandy, and a small sharp knife, I said.Dip the knifeand the needlein the brandy, then hold the tip in a flame for a moment.Let it cool, but dont touch it.As I spoke, I was gently pulling up one eyelid.The mans eye looked up at me, an oddly irregular, blotched brown iris in a bloodshot sclera the yellow of heavy cream.I searched carefully, bringing the candle flame close enough to shrink the pupil, then drawing it away, but saw nothing there.I tried the other eye, and nearly dropped the candle.Sure enough, there was a small, transparent filament, moving under the conjunctiva.I gagged slightly at the sight, but controlled myself, and reached for the freshly sterilized knife, still holding back the eyelid.Take him by the shoulders, I said to Geilie.Dont let him move, or I may blind him.The surgery itself was horrifying to contemplate, but surprisingly simple to perform.I made one quick, small incision along the inside corner of the conjunctiva, lifted it slightly with the tip of the needle, and as the worm undulated lazily across the open field, I slipped the tip of the needle under the body and drew it out, neat as a loop of yarn.Repressing a shudder of distaste, I flicked the worm away.It hit the wall with a tiny wet splat!and vanished in the shadows under the cheese.There was no blood; after a brief debate with myself, I decided to leave it to the mans own tear ducts to irrigate the incision.That would have to be left to heal by itself; I had no fine sutures, and the wound was small enough not to need more than a stitch or two in any case.I tied a clean pad of cloth over the closed eye with a bandage round the head, and sat back, reasonably pleased with my first foray into tropical medicine.Fine, I said, pushing back my hair.Wheres the other one?The next patient was in a shed outside the kitchen, dead.I squatted next to the body, that of a middle aged man with grizzled hair, feeling both pity and outrage.The cause of death was more than obvious: a strangulated hernia.The loop of twisted, gangrenous bowel protruded from one side of the belly, the stretched skin over it already tinged with green, though the body itself was still nearly as warm as life.An expression of agony was fixed on the broad features, and the limbs were still contorted, giving an unfortunately accurate witness to just what sort of death it had been.Why did you wait?I stood up, glaring at Geilie.For Gods sake, you kept me drinking tea and chatting, while this was going on?Hes been dead less than an hour, but he must have been in trouble a long time sincedays!Why didnt you bring me out here at once?He seemed pretty far gone this morning, she said, not at all disturbed by my agitation.She shrugged.Ive seen them so before; I didna think you could do anything much.It didna seem worth hurrying.I choked back further recrimination.She was right; I could have operated, had I come sooner, but the chances of it doing any good were slim to nonexistent.The hernia repair was something I might have managed, even with such difficult conditions; after all, that was nothing more than pushing back the bowel protrusion and pulling the ruptured layers of abdominal muscle back together with sutures; infection was the only real danger.But once the loop of escaped intestine had twisted, so that the blood supply was cut off and the contents began to putrefy, the man was doomed.But to allow the man to die here in this stuffy shed, alonewell, perhaps he would not have found the presence of one white woman more or less a comfort, in any case.Still, I felt an obscure sense of failure; the same I always felt in the presence of death.I wiped my hands slowly on a brandy soaked cloth, mastering my feelings.One to the good, one to the badand Ian still to be found.Since Im here now, perhaps Id best have a look at the rest of your slaves, I suggested.An ounce of prevention, you know.Oh, theyre well enough.Geilie waved a careless hand.Still, if ye want to take the time, youre welcome.Later, though; Ive a visitor coming this afternoon, and I want to talk more with ye, first.Come back to the house, nowsomeone will take care o this.A brief nod disposed of this, the slaves contorted body.She linked her arm in mine, urging me out of the shed and back toward the kitchen with soft thrustings of her weight.In the kitchen, I detached myself, motioning toward the pregnant slave, now on her hands and knees, scrubbing the hearthstones.You go along; I want to have a quick look at this girl.She looks a bit toxic to meyou dont want her to miscarry.Geilie gave me a curious glance, but then shrugged.Shes foaled twice with no trouble, but youre the doctor.Aye, if thats your notion of fun, go ahead.Dont take too long, though; that parson said hed come at four oclock.I made some pretense of examining the bewildered woman, until Geilies draperies had disappeared into the breezeway.Look, I said.Im looking for a young white boy named Ian; Im his aunt.Do you know where he might be?The girlshe couldnt be more than seventeen or eighteenlooked startled.She blinked, and darted a glance at one of the older women, who had quit her own work and come across the room to see what was going on.No, maam, the older woman said, shaking her head.No white boys here.None at all.No, maam, the girl obediently echoed.We don know nothin bout your boy.But she hadnt said that at first, and her eyes wouldnt meet mine.The older woman had been joined now by the other two kitchenmaids, coming to buttress her.I was surrounded by an impenetrable wall of bland ignorance, and no way to break through it.At the same time, I was aware of a current running among the womena feeling of mutual warning; of wariness and secrecy.It might be only the natural reaction to the sudden appearance of a white stranger in their domainor it might be something more.I couldnt take longer; Geilie would be coming back to look for me.I fumbled quickly in my pocket, and pulled out a silver florin, which I pressed into the girls hand.If you should see Ian, tell him that his uncle is here to find him.Not waiting for an answer, I turned and hurried out of the kitchen.I glanced down toward the sugar mill as I passed through the breezeway.The sugar press stood abandoned, the oxen grazing placidly in the long grass at the edge of the clearing.There was no sign of Jamie or the overseer; had he come back to the house?I came through the French windows into the salon, and stopped short.Geilie sat in her wicker chair, Jamies coat across the arm, and the photographs of Brianna spread over her lap.She heard my step and looked up, one pale brow arched over an acid smile.What a pretty lassie, to be sure.Whats her name?Brianna.My lips felt stiff.I walked slowly toward her, fighting the urge to snatch the pictures from her hands and run.Looks a great deal like her father, doesnt she?I thought she seemed familiar, that tall red haired lass I saw that night on Craigh na Dun.He is her father, no?She inclined her head toward the door where Jamie had vanished.Yes.Give them to me.It made no difference; she had seen the pictures already.Still, I couldnt stand to see her thick white fingers cupping Briannas face.Her mouth twitched as though she meant to refuse, but she tapped them neatly into a square and handed them to me without demur.I held them against my chest for a moment, not knowing what to do with them, then thrust them back into the pocket of my skirt.Sit ye down, Claire.The coffees come.She nodded toward the small table, and the chair alongside.Her eyes followed me as I moved to it, alive with calculation.She gestured for me to pour the coffee for both of us, and took her own cup without words.We sipped silently for a few moments.The cup trembled in my hands, spilling hot liquid across my wrist.I put it down, wiping my hand on my skirt, wondering in some dim recess of my mind why I should be afraid.Twice, she said suddenly.She looked at me with something akin to awe.Sweet Christ Jesus, ye went through twice!Or nothree times, it must have been, for here ye are now.She shook her head, marveling, never taking her bright green eyes from my face.How?she asked.How could ye do it so many times, and live?I dont know.I saw the look of hard skepticism flash across her face, and answered it, defensively.I dont!I justwent.Was it not the same for you?The green eyes had narrowed into slits of concentration.What was it like, there between?Did ye not feel the terror?And the noise, fit to split your skull and spill your brains?Yes, it was like that.I didnt want to talk to about it; didnt even like to think of the time passage.I had blocked it deliberately from my mind, the roar of death and dissolution and the voices of chaos that urged me to join them.Did ye have blood to protect you, or stones?I wouldna think yed the nerve for bloodbut maybe Im wrong.For surely yere stronger than I thought, to have done it three times, and lived through it.Blood?I shook my head, confused.No.Nothing.I told youIwent.Thats all.Then I remembered the night she had gone through the stones in 1968; the blaze of fire on Craigh na Dun, and the twisted, blackened shape in the center of that fire.Greg Edgars, I said.The name of her first husband.You didnt just kill him because he found you and tried to stop you, did you?He was  The blood, aye.She was watching me, intent.I didna think it could be done at all, the crossingnot without the blood.She sounded faintly amazed.The auld onesthey always used the blood.That and the fire.They built great wicker cages, filled wi their captives, and set them alight in the circles.I thought that was how they opened the passage.My hands and my lips felt cold, and I picked up the cup to warm them.Where in the name of God was Jamie?And ye didna use stones, either?I shook my head.What stones?She looked at me for a moment, debating whether to tell me.Her little pink tongue flicked over her lip, and then she nodded, deciding.With a small grunt, she heaved herself up from the chair and went toward the great hearth at the far end of the room, beckoning me to follow.She knelt, with surprising grace for one of her figure, and pressed a greenish stone set into the mantelpiece, a foot or so above the hearth.It moved slightly, and there was a soft click!as one of the hearth slates rose smoothly out of its mortared setting.Spring mechanism, Geilie explained, lifting the slate carefully and setting it aside.A Danish fellow named Leiven from St.Croix made it for me.She reached into the cavity beneath and drew out a wooden box, about a foot long.There were pale brown stains on the smooth wood, and it looked swollen and split, as though it had been immersed in seawater at some time.I bit my lip hard at its appearance, and hoped my face didnt give anything away.If I had had any doubts about Ian being here, they had vanishedfor here, unless I was very much mistaken, was the silkies treasure.Fortunately, Geilie wasnt looking at me, but at the box.I learned about the stones from an Indiannot a red Indian, a Hindoo from Calcutta, she explained.He came to me, looking for thornapple, and he told me about how to make medicines from the gemstones.I looked over my shoulder for Jamie, but there was no sign of him.Where the hell was he?Had he found Ian, somewhere on the plantation?Ye can get the powdered stones from a London apothecary, she was saying, frowning slightly as she pushed at the sliding lid.But theyre mostly poor quality, and the bhasmas doesnt work so well.Best to have a stone at least of the second qualitywhat they call a nagina stone.Thats a goodish sized stone thats been polished.A stone of the first quality is faceted, and unflawed for preference, but most folk canna afford to burn those to ash.The ashes of the stone are the bhasmas, she explained, turning to look up at me.Thats what ye use in the medicines.Here, can ye pry this damn thing loose?Its been spoilt in seawater, and the locking bit swells whenever the weathers dampwhich it is all the time, this season of the year, she added, making a face over her shoulder at the clouds rolling in over the bay, far below.She thrust the box into my hands and rose heavily to her feet, grunting with the effort.It was a Chinese puzzle box, I saw; a fairly simple one, with a small sliding panel that unlocked the main lid.The problem was that the smaller panel had swollen, sticking in its slot.Its bad luck to break one, Geilie observed, watching my attempts.Else Id just smash the thing and be done with it.Here, maybe this will help.She produced a small mother of pearl penknife from the recesses of her gown and handed it to me, then went to the window ledge and rang another of her silver bells.I pried gently upward with the blade of the knife.I felt it catch in the wood, and wiggled it gingerly.Little by little, the small rectangle of wood edged out of its place, until I could get hold of it between thumb and forefinger and pull it all the way loose.There you go, I said, handing her back the box with some reluctance.It felt heavy, and there was an unmistakable metallic chinking as I tilted it.Thanks.As she took it, the black servingmaid came in through the far door.Geilie turned to order the girl to bring a tray of fresh tarts, and I saw that she had slipped the box between the folds of her skirts, hiding it.Nosy creatures, she said, frowning toward the departing maids back as the girl passed through the door.One of the difficulties wi slaves; its hard to have secrets.She put the box on the table, and pushed at the top; with a small, sharp skreek!of protest, the lid slid back.She reached into the box and drew out her closed hand.She smiled mischievously at me, saying, Little Jackie Horner sat in the corner, eating her Christmas pie.She put in her thumb, and pulled out a plumshe opened her hand with a flourishand said What a good girl am I!I had been expecting them, of course, but had no difficulty in looking impressed anyway.The reality of a gem is both more immediate and more startling than its description.Six or seven of them flashed and glimmered in her palm, flaming fire and frozen ice, the gleam of blue water in the sun, and a great gold stone like the eye of a lurking tiger.Without meaning to, I drew near enough to look down into the well of her hand, staring with fascination.Big enough, Jamie had described them as being, with a characteristic Scottish talent for understatement.Well, smaller than a breadbox, I supposed.I got them for the money, to start, Geilie was saying, prodding the stones with satisfaction.Because they were easier to carry than a great weight of gold or silver, I mean; I didna think then what other use they might have.What, as bhasmas?The idea of burning any of those glowing things to ash seemed a sacrilege.Oh, no, not these.Her hand closed on the stones, dipped into her pocket, and back into the box for more.A small shower of liquid fire dropped into her pocket, and she patted it affectionately.No, Ive a lot o the smaller stones for that.These are for something else.She eyed me speculatively, then jerked her head toward the door at the end of the room.Come along up to my workroom, she said.Ive a few things there youll maybe be interested to see.Interested was putting it mildly, I thought.It was a long, light filled room, with a counter down one side.Bunches of drying herbs hung from hooks overhead and lay on gauze covered drying racks along the inner wall.Drawered cabinets and cupboards covered the rest of the wall space, and there was a small glass fronted bookcase at the end of the room.The room gave me a mild sense of dj vu; after a moment, I realized that it was because it strongly resembled Geilies workroom in the village of Cranesmuir, in the house of her first husbandno, second, I corrected myself, remember the flaming body of Greg Edgars.How many times have you been married?I asked curiously.She had begun building her fortune with her second husband, procurator fiscal of the district where they lived, forging his signature in order to divert money to her own use, and then murdering him.Successful with this modus operandi, I imagined she had tried it again; she was a creature of habit, was Geilie Duncan.She paused a moment to count up.Oh, five, I think.Since I came here, she added casually.Five?I said, a little faintly.Not just a habit, it seemed; a positive addiction.A verra unhealthy atmosphere for Englishmen it is in the tropics, she said, and smiled slyly at me.Fevers, ulcers, festering stomachs; any little thing will carry them off.She had evidently been mindful of her oral hygiene; her teeth were still very good.She reached out and lightly caressed a small bottle that stood on the lowest shelf.It wasnt labeled, but I had seen crude white arsenic before.On the whole, I was glad I hadnt taken any food.Oh, youll be interested in this, she said, spying a jar on an upper shelf.Grunting slightly as she stood on tiptoe, she reached it down and handed it to me.It contained a very coarse powder, evidently a mixture of several substances, brown, yellow, and black, flecked with shreds of a semitranslucent material.Whats this?Zombie poison, she said, and laughed.I thought yed like to see.Oh?I said coldly.I thought you told me there was no such thing.No, she corrected, still smiling.I told ye Hercule wasnt dead; and hes not.She took the jar from me and replaced it on the shelf.But theres no denying that hes a good bit more manageable if hes had a dose of this stuff once a week, mixed with his grain.What the hell is it?She shrugged, offhanded.A bit of this and a bit of that.The main thing seems to be a kind of fisha little square thing wi spots; verra funny looking.Ye take the skin and dry it, and the liver as well.But there are a few other things ye put in with itI wish I kent what, she added.You dont know whats in it?I stared at her.Didnt you make it?No.I had a cook, Geilie said, or at least they sold him to me as a cook, but damned if Id feel safe eating a thing he turned out of the kitchen, the sly black devil.He was a houngan, though.A what?Houngan is what the blacks call one of their medicine priests; though to be quite right about it, I believe Ishmael said his sort of black called him an oniseegun, or somesuch.Ishmael, hm?I licked my dry lips.Did he come with that name?Oh, no.He had some heathen name wi six syllables, and the man who sold him called him Jimmythe auctioneers call all the bucks Jimmy.I named him Ishmael, because of the story the seller told me about him.Ishmael had been taken from a barracoon on the Gold Coast of Africa, one of a shipment of six hundred slaves from the villages of Nigeria and Ghana, stowed between decks of the slave ship Persephone, bound for Antigua.Coming through the Caicos Passage, the Persephone had run into a sudden squall, and been run aground on Hogsty Reef, off the island of Great Inagua.The ship had broken up, with barely time for the crew to escape in the ships boats.The slaves, chained and helpless betweendecks, had all drowned.All but one man who had earlier been taken from the hold to assist as a galley mate, both messboys having died of the pox en route from Africa.This man, left behind by the ships crew, had nonetheless survived the wreck by clinging to a cask of spirits, which floated ashore on Great Inagua two days later.The fishermen who discovered the castaway were more interested in his means of salvation than in the slave himself.Breaking open the cask, however, they were shocked and appalled to find inside the body of a man, somewhat imperfectly preserved by the spirits in which he had been soaking.I wonder if they drank the crme de menthe anyway, I murmured, having observed for myself that Mr.Overholts assessment of the alcoholic affinities of sailors was largely correct.I daresay, said Geilie, mildly annoyed at having her story interrupted.In any case, when I heard of it, I named him Ishmael straight off.Because of the floating coffin, aye?Very clever, I congratulated her.Erdid they find out who the man in the cask was?I dont think so.She shrugged carelessly.They gave him to the Governor of Jamaica, who had him put in a glass case, wi fresh spirits, as a curiosity.What?I said incredulously.Well, not so much the man himself, but some odd fungi that were growing on him, Geilie explained.The Governors got a passion for such things.The old Governor, I mean; I hear theres a new one, now.Quite, I said, feeling a bit queasy.I thought the ex governor was more likely to qualify as a curiosity than the dead man, on the whole.Her back was turned, as she pulled out drawers and rummaged through them.I took a deep breath, hoping to keep my voice casual.This Ishmael sounds an interesting sort; do you still have him?No, she said indifferently.The black bastard ran off.Hes the one who made the zombie poison for me, though.Wouldnt tell me how, no matter what I did to him, she added, with a short, humorless laugh, and I had a sudden vivid memory of the weals across Ishmaels back.He said it wasnt proper for women to make medicine, only men could do it.Or the verra auld women, once theyd quit bleeding.Hmph!She snorted, and reached into her pocket, pulling out a handful of stones.Anyway, thats not what I brought ye up to show ye.Carefully, she laid five of the stones in a rough circle on the countertop.Then she took down from a shelf a thick book, bound in worn leather.Can ye read German?she asked, opening it carefully.Not much, no, I said.I moved closer, to look over her shoulder.Hexenhammer, it said, in a fine, handwritten script.Witches Hammer?I asked.I raised one eyebrow.Spells?Magic?The skepticism in my voice must have been obvious, for she glared at me over one shoulder.Look, fool, she said.Who are ye?Or what, rather?What am I?I said, startled.Thats right.She turned and leaned against the counter, studying me through narrowed eyes.What are ye?Or me, come to that?What are we?I opened my mouth to reply, then closed it again.Thats right, she said softly, watching.Its not everyone can go through the stones, is it?Why us?I dont know, I said.And neither do you, Ill be bound.It doesnt mean were witches, surely!Doesnt it?She lifted one brow, and turned several pages of the book.Some people can leave their bodies and travel miles away, she said, staring meditatively at the page.Other people see them out wandering, and recognize them, and ye can bloody prove they were really tucked up safe in bed at the time.Ive seen the records, all the eyewitness testimony.Some people have stigmata ye can see and touchIve seen one.But not everybody.Only certain people.She turned another page.If everyone can do it, its science.If only a few can, then its witchcraft, or superstition, or whatever you like to call it, she said.But its real.She looked up at me, green eyes bright as a snakes over the crumbling book.Were real, Claireyou and me.And special.Have ye never asked yourself why?I had.Any number of times.I had never gotten a reasonable answer to the question, though.Evidently, Geilie thought she had one.She turned back to the stones she had laid on the counter, and pointed at them each in turn.Stones of protection; amethyst, emerald, turquoise, lapis lazuli, and a male ruby.A male ruby?Pliny says rubies have a sex to them; who am I to argue?she said impatiently.The male stones are what ye use, though; the female ones dont work.I suppressed the urge to ask precisely how one distinguished the sex of rubies, in favor of asking, Work for what?For the travel, she said, glancing curiously at me.Through the stones.They protect ye from thewhatever it is, out there.Her eyes grew slightly shadowed at the thought of the time passage, and I realized that she was deathly afraid of it.Little wonder; so was I.   When did ye come?The first time?Her eyes were intent on mine.From 1945, I said slowly.I came to 1743, if thats what you mean.I was reluctant to tell her too much; still, my own curiosity was overwhelming.She was right about one thing; she and I were different.I might never again have the chance to talk to another person who knew what she did.For that matter, the longer I could keep her talking, the longer Jamie would have to look for Ian.Hm.She grunted in a satisfied manner.Near enough.Its two hundred year, in the Highland taleswhen folk fall asleep on fairy duns and end up dancing all night wi the Auld Folk; its usually two hundred year later when they come back to their own place.You didnt, though.You came from 1968, but youd been in Cranesmuir several years before I came there.Five years, aye.She nodded, abstracted.Aye, well, that was the blood.Blood?The sacrifice, she said, suddenly impatient.It gives ye a greater range.And at least a bit of control, so ye have some notion how far yere going.How did ye get to and fro three times, without blood?she demanded.Ijust came.The need to find out as much as I could made me add the little else I knew.I thinkI think it has something to do with being able to fix your mind on a certain person whos in the time you go to.Her eyes were nearly round with interest.Really, she said softly.Think o that, now.She shook her head slowly, thinking.Hm.That might be so.Still, the stones should work as well; theres patterns ye make, wi the different gems, ye ken.She pulled another fistful of shining stones from her pocket and spread them on the wooden surface, pawing through them.The protection stones are the points of the pentacle, she explained, intent on her rummaging, but inside that, ye lay the pattern wi different stones, depending which way ye mean to go, and how far.And ye lay a line of quicksilver between them, and fire it when ye speak the spells.And of course ye draw the pentacle wi diamond dust.Of course, I murmured, fascinated.Smell it?she asked, looking up for a moment and sniffing.Ye wouldna think stones had a scent, aye?But they do, when ye grind them to powder.I inhaled deeply, and did seem to find a faint, unfamiliar scent among the smell of dried herbs.It was a dry scent, pleasant but indescribablethe scent of gemstones.She held up one stone with a small cry of triumph.This one!This is the one I needed; couldna find one anywhere in the islands, and finally I thought o the box Id left in Scotland.The stone she held was a black crystal of some kind; the light from the window passed through it, and yet it glittered like a piece of jet between her white fingers.What is it?An adamant; a black diamond.The auld alchemists used them.The books say that to wear an adamant brings ye the knowledge of the joy in all things.She laughed, a short, sharp sound, devoid of her usual girlish charm.If anything can bring knowledge o joy in that passage through the stones, I want one!Something was beginning to dawn on me, rather belatedly.In defense of my slowness, I can only argue that I was simultaneously listening to Geilie and keeping an ear out for any sign of Jamie returning below.You mean to go back, then?I asked, as casually as I could.I might.A small smile played around the corners of her mouth.Now that Ive got the things I need.I tell ye, Claire, I wouldna risk it, without.She stared at me, shaking her head.Three times, wi no blood, she murmured.So it can be done.Well, best we go down now, she said, suddenly brisk, sweeping the stones up and dumping them back into her pocket.The fox will be backFraser is his name, is it no?I thought Clotilda said something else, but the stupid bitch likely got it wrong.As we made our way down the long workroom, something small and brown darted across the floor in front of me.Geilie was quick, despite her size; her small foot stamped on the centipede before I could react.She watched the half crushed beast wriggling on the floor for a moment, then stooped and slid a sheet of paper under it.Scooping it up, she decanted the thing thriftily into a glass jar.Ye dinna want to believe in witches and zombies and things that go bump in the night?she said, with a small, sly smile at me.She nodded at the centipede, struggling round and round in frenzied, lopsided circles.Well, legends are many legged beasties, aye?But they generally have at least one foot on the truth.She took down a clear brown glass jug and poured the liquid into the centipedes bottle.The pungent scent of alcohol rose in the air.The centipede, washed up by the wave, kicked frantically for a moment, then sank to the bottom of the bottle, legs moving spasmodically.She corked the bottle neatly, and turned to go.You asked me why I thought we can pass through the stones, I said to her back.Do you know why, Geilie?She glanced over her shoulder at me.Why, to change things, she said, sounding surprised.Why else?Come along; I hear your man down there.Whatever Jamie had been doing, it had been hard work; his shirt was dampened with sweat, and clung to his shoulders.He swung around as we entered the room, and I saw that he had been looking at the wooden puzzle box that Geilie had left on the table.It was obvious from his expression that I had been correct in my surmiseit was the box he had found on the silkies isle.I believe I have succeeded in mending your sugar press, mistress, he said, bowing politely to Geilie.A matter of a cracked cylinder, which your overseer and I contrived to stuff with wedges.Still, I fear ye may be needing another soon.Geilie quirked her eyebrows, amused.Well, and Im obliged to ye, Mr.Fraser.Can I not offer ye some refreshment after your labor?Her hand hovered over the row of bells, but Jamie shook his head, picking up his coat from the sofa.I thank ye, mistress, but I fear we must take our leave.Its quite some way back to Kingston, and we must be on our way, if we mean to reach it before dark.His face went suddenly blank, and I knew he must have felt the pocket of his coat and realized that the photographs were missing.He glanced quickly at me, and I gave him a brief nod, touching the side of my skirt where they lay.Thank you for your hospitality, I said, snatching up my hat, and moving toward the door with alacrity.Now that Jamie was back, I wanted nothing so much as to get quickly away from Rose Hall and its owner.Jamie hung back a moment, though.I wondered, Mistress Abernathysince ye mentioned having lived in Paris for a timewhether ye might have been acquainted there wi a gentleman of my own acquaintance.Did ye by chance ken the Duke of Sandringham?She cocked her cream blond head at him inquisitively, but as he said no more, she nodded.Aye, I kent him.Why?Jamie gave her his most charming smile.No particular reason, mistress; only a curiosity, ye might say.The sky was completely overcast by the time we passed the gate, and it was clear that we werent going to make it back to Kingston without getting soaked.Under the circumstances, I didnt care.Yeve got Briannas pictures?was the first thing Jamie asked, reining up for a moment.Right here.I patted my pocket.Did you find any sign of Ian?He glanced back over his shoulder, as though fearing we might be pursued.I couldna get anything out of the overseer or any o the slavestheyre bone scairt of that woman, and I canna say I blame them a bit.But I know where he is.He spoke with considerable satisfaction.Where?Can we sneak back and get him?I rose slightly in my saddle, looking back; the slates of Rose Hall were all that was visible through the treetops.I would have been most reluctant to set foot on the place again for any reasonexcept for Ian.Not now.Jamie caught at my bridle, turning the horses head back to the trail.Ill need help.Under the pretext of finding material to repair the damaged sugar press, Jamie had managed to see most of the plantation within a quarter mile of the house, including a cluster of slave huts, the stables, a disused drying shed for tobacco, and the building that housed the sugar refinery.Everyplace he went, he suffered no interference beyond curious or hostile glancesexcept near the refinery.That big black bugger who came up onto the porch was sitting on the ground outside, he said.When I got too close to him, it made the overseer verra nervous indeed; he kept calling me away, warning me not to get too close to the fellow.That sounds like a really excellent idea, I said, shuddering slightly.Not getting close to him, I mean.But you think he has something to do with Ian?He was sitting in front of a wee door fixed into the ground, Sassenach.Jamie guided his horse adroitly around a fallen log in the path.It must lead to a cellar beneath the refinery.The man had not moved an inch, in all the time that Jamie contrived to spend around the refinery.If Ians there, thats where he is.Im fairly sure hes there, all right.I told him quickly the details of my visit, including my brief conversation with the kitchenmaids.But what are we going to do?I concluded.We cant just leave him there!After all, we dont know what Geillis wants with him, but it cant be innocent, if she wouldnt admit he was there, can it?Not innocent at all, he agreed, grim faced.The overseer wouldna speak to me of Ian, but he told me other things that would curl your hair, if it wasna already curled up like sheeps wool.He glanced at me, and a half smile lit his face, in spite of his obvious perturbation.Judging by the state of your hair, Sassenach, I should say that its going to rain verra soon now.How observant of you, I said sarcastically, vainly trying to tuck in the curls and tendrils that were escaping from under my hat.The fact that the skys black as pitch and the air smells like lightning wouldnt have a thing to do with your conclusions, of course.The leaves of the trees all round us were fluttering like tethered butterflies, as the edge of the storm rose toward us up the slope of the mountain.From the small rise where we stood, I could see the storm clouds sweep in across the bay below, with a dark curtain of rain hanging beneath it like a veil.Jamie rose in his saddle, looking over the terrain.To my unpracticed eye, our surroundings looked like solid, impenetrable jungle, but other possibilities were visible to a man who had lived in the heather for seven years.Wed best find a bit of shelter while we can, Sassenach, he said.Follow me.On foot, leading the horses, we left the narrow path and pressed into the forest, following what Jamie said was a wild pigs trail.Within a few moments, he had found what he was looking for; a small stream that cut deep through the forest floor, with a steep bank, overgrown with ferns and dark, glossy bushes, interspersed with stands of slender saplings.He set me to gathering ferns, each frond the length of my arm, and by the time I had returned with as many as I could carry, he had the framework of a tidy snug, formed by the arch of the bent saplings, tied to a fallen log, and covered over with branches cut from the nearby bushes.Hastily roofed with the spread ferns, it was not quite waterproof, but a great deal better than being caught in the open.Ten minutes later, we were safe inside.There was a moment of absolute quiet as the wind on the edge of the storm passed by us.No birds chattered, no insects sang; they were as well equipped as we were to predict the rain.A few large drops fell, splattering on the foliage with an explosive sound like snapping twigs.Then the storm broke.Caribbean rainstorms are abrupt and vigorous.None of the misty mousing about of an Edinburgh drizzle.The heavens blacken and split, dropping gallons of water within a minute.For as long as the rain lasts, speech is impossible, and a light fog rises from the ground like steam, vapor raised by the force of the raindrops striking the ground.The rain pelted the ferns above us, and a faint mist filled the green shadows of our shelter.Between the clatter of the rain and the constant thunder that boomed among the hills, it was impossible to talk.It wasnt cold, but there was a leak overhead, which dripped steadily on my neck.There was no room to move away; Jamie took off his coat and wrapped it around me, then put his arm around me to wait out the storm.In spite of the terrible racket outside, I felt suddenly safe, and peaceful, relieved of the strain of the last few hours, the last few days.Ian was as good as found, and nothing could touch us, here.I squeezed his free hand; he smiled at me, then bent and kissed me gently.He smelled fresh and earthy, scented with the sap of the branches he had cut and the smell of his own healthy sweat.It was nearly over, I thought.We had found Ian, and God willing, would get him back safely, very soon.And then what?We would have to leave Jamaica, but there were other places, and the world was wide.There were the French colonies of Martinique and Grenada, the Dutch held island of Eleuthera; perhaps we would even venture as far as the continentcannibals notwithstanding.So long as I had Jamie, I was not afraid of anything.The rain ceased as abruptly as it had started.Drops fell singly from the shrubs and trees, with a pit a pat drip that echoed the ringing left in my ears by the storms roar.A soft, fresh breeze came up the stream bed, carrying away humidity, lifting the damp curls from my neck with delicious coolness.The birds and the insects began again, quietly, and then in full voice, and the air itself seemed to dance with green life.I stirred and sighed, pushing myself upright and shrugging off Jamies coat.You know, Geilie showed me a special stone, a black diamond called an adamant, I said.She said its a stone the alchemists used; it gives a knowledge of the joy in all things.I think there might be one under this spot.Jamie smiled at me.I shouldna be surprised at all, Sassenach, he said.Here, yeve water all down your face.He reached into his coat for a handkerchief, then stopped.Briannas pictures, he said suddenly.Oh, I forgot.I dug in my pocket, and handed him back the pictures.He took them and thumbed rapidly through them, stopped, then went through them again, more slowly.Whats wrong?I asked, suddenly alarmed.One of thems gone, he said quietly.I felt an inexpressible feeling of dread begin to grow in the pit of my stomach, and the joy of a moment before began to ebb away.Are you sure?I know them as well as I know your face, Sassenach, he said.Aye, Im sure.Its the one of her by the fire.I remembered the picture in question well; it showed Brianna as an adult, sitting on a rock, outdoors by a campfire.Her knees were drawn up, her elbows resting on them, and she was looking directly into the camera, but with no knowledge of its presence, her face filled with firelit dreams, her hair blown back away from her face.Geilie must have taken it.She found the pictures in your coat while I was in the kitchen, and I took them away from her.She must have stolen it then.Damn the woman!Jamie turned sharply to look toward the road, eyes dark with anger.His hand was tight on the remaining photographs.What does she want with it?Perhaps its only curiosity, I said, but the feeling of dread would not go away.What could she do with it, after all?She isnt likely to show it to anyonewho would come here?As though in answer to this question, Jamies head lifted suddenly, and he grasped my arm in adjuration to be still.Some distance below, a loop of the road was visible through the overgrowth, a thin ribbon of yellowish mud.Along this ribbon came a plodding figure on horseback, a man dressed in black, small and dark as an ant at this distance.Then I remembered what Geilie had said.Im expecting a visitor.And later, That parson said hed come at four oclock.Its a parson, a minister of some kind, I said.She said she was expecting him.Its Archie Campbell, is who it is, Jamie said, with some grimness.What the devilor perhaps I shouldna use that particular expression, wi respect to Mistress Duncan.Perhaps hes come to exorcise her, I suggested, with a nervous laugh.Hes his work cut out for him, if so.The angular figure disappeared into the trees, but it was several minutes before Jamie deemed him safely past us.What do you plan to do about Ian?I asked, once we had made our way back to the path.Ill need help, he answered briskly.I mean to come up the river with Innes and MacLeod and the rest.Theres a landing there, no great distance from the refinery.Well leave the boat there, go ashore and deal wi Herculesand Atlas, too, if hes a mind to be troublesomebreak open the cellar, snatch Ian, and make off again.The dark o the moons in two daysI wish it could be sooner, but it will likely take that long to get a suitable boat and what arms well need.Using what for money?I inquired bluntly.The expenditure for new clothes and shoes had taken a substantial portion of Jamies share of profit from the bat guano.What was left would feed us for several weeks, and possibly be sufficient to rent a boat for a day or two, but it wouldnt stretch to buying large quantities of weapons.Neither pistols nor swords were manufactured on the island; all weapons were imported from Europe and were in consequence expensive.Jamie himself had Captain Rainess two pistols; the Scots had nothing but their fish knives and the odd cutlassinsufficient for an armed raid.He grimaced slightly, then glanced at me sidelong.I must ask John for help, he said simply.Must I not?I rode silently for a moment, then nodded in acquiescence.I suppose youll have to.I didnt like it, but it wasnt a question of my liking; it was Ians life.One thing, though, Jamie  Aye, I know, he said, resigned.Ye mean to come with me, no?Yes, I said, smiling.After all, what if Ians hurt, or sick, or  Aye, ye can come!he said, rather testily.Only do me the one wee favor, Sassenach.Try verra hard not to be killed or cut to pieces, aye?Its hard on a mans sensibilities.Ill try, I said, circumspectly.And nudging my horse closer to his, rode side by side down toward Kingston, through the dripping trees.61  THE CROCODILES FIRE  There was a surprising amount of traffic on the river at night.Lawrence Stern, who had insisted on accompanying the expedition, told me that most of the plantations up in the hills used the river as their main linkage with Kingston and the harbor; roads were either atrocious or nonexistent, swallowed by lush growth with each new rainy season.I had expected the river to be deserted, but we passed two small craft and a barge headed downstream as we tacked laboriously up the broad waterway, under sail.The barge, an immense dark shape stacked high with casks and bales, passed us like a black iceberg, huge, humped, and threatening.The low voices of the slaves poling it carried across the water, talking softly in a foreign tongue.It was kind of ye to come, Lawrence, Jamie said.We had a small, single masted open boat, which barely held Jamie, myself, the six Scottish smugglers, and Stern.Despite the crowded quarters, I too was grateful for Sterns company; he had a stolid, phlegmatic quality about him that was very comforting under the circumstances.Well, I confess to some curiosity, Stern said, flapping the front of his shirt to cool his sweating body.In the dark, all I could see of him was a moving blotch of white.I have met the lady before, you see.Mrs.Abernathy?I paused, then asked delicately, Erwhat did you think of her?Ohshe was a very pleasant lady; mostgracious.Dark as it was, I couldnt see his face, but his voice held an odd note, half pleased, half embarrassed, that told me he had found the widow Abernathy quite attractive indeed.From which I concluded that Geilie had wanted something from the naturalist; I had never known her treat a man with any regard, save for her own ends.Where did you meet her?At her own house?According to the attendees at the Governors ball, Mrs.Abernathy seldom or never left her plantation.Yes, at Rose Hall.I had stopped to ask permission to collect a rare type of beetleone of the Cucurlionidaethat I had found near a spring on the plantation.She invited me in, andmade me most welcome.This time there was a definite note of self satisfaction in his voice.Jamie, handling the tiller next to me, heard it and snorted briefly.What did she want of ye?he asked, no doubt having formed conclusions similar to mine about Geilies motives and behavior.Oh, she was most gratifyingly interested in the specimens of flora and fauna I had collected on the island; she asked me about the locations and virtues of several different herbs.Ah, and about the other places I had been.She was particularly interested in my stories of Hispaniola.He sighed, momentarily regretful.It is difficult to believe that such a lovely woman might engage in such reprehensible behavior as you describe, James.Lovely, aye?Jamies voice was dryly amused.A bit smitten, were ye, Lawrence?Lawrences voice echoed Jamies smile.There is a sort of carnivorous fly I have observed, friend James.The male fly, choosing a female to court, takes pains to bring her a bit of meat or other prey, tidily wrapped in a small silk package.While the female is engaged in unwrapping her tidbit, he leaps upon her, performs his copulatory duties, and hastens away.For if she should finish her meal before he has finished his own activities, or should he be so careless as not to bring her a tasty presentshe eats him.There was a soft laugh in the darkness.No, it was an interesting experience, but I think I shall not call upon Mrs.Abernathy again.Not if were lucky about it, no, Jamie agreed.The men left me by the riverbank to mind the boat, and melted into the darkness, with instructions from Jamie to stay put.I had a primed pistol, given to me with the stern injunction not to shoot myself in the foot.The weight of it was comforting, but as the minutes dragged by in black silence, I found the dark and the solitude more and more oppressive.From where I stood, I could see the house, a dark oblong with only the lower three windows lighted; that would be the salon, I thought, and wondered why there was no sign of any activity by the slaves.As I watched, though, I saw a shadow cross one of the lighted windows, and my heart jumped into my throat.It wasnt Geilies shadow, by any conceivable stretch of the imagination.It was tall, thin, and gawkily angular.I looked wildly around, wanting to call out; but it was too late.The men were all out of earshot, headed for the refinery.I hesitated for a moment, but there was really nothing else to do.I kilted up my skirts and stepped into the dark.By the time I stepped onto the veranda, I was damp with perspiration, and my heart was beating loudly enough to drown out all other sounds.I edged silently next to the nearest window, trying to peer in without being seen from within.Everything was quiet and orderly within.There was a small fire on the hearth, and the glow of the flames gleamed on the polished floor.Geilies rosewood secretary was unfolded, the desk shelf covered with piles of handwritten papers and what looked like very old books.I couldnt see anyone inside, but I couldnt see the whole room, either.My skin prickled with imagination, thinking of the dead eyed Hercules, silently stalking me in the dark.I edged farther down the veranda, looking over my shoulder with every other step.There was an odd sense of desertion about the place this evening.There were none of the subdued voices of slaves that had attended my earlier visit, muttering to one another as they went about their tasks.But that might mean nothing, I told myself.Most of the slaves would stop work and go to their own quarters at sundown.Still, ought there not to be house servants, to tend the fire and fetch food from the kitchen?The front door stood open.Spilled petals from the yellow rose lay across the doorstep, glowing like ancient gold coins in the faint light from the entryway.I paused, listening.I thought I heard a faint rustle from inside the salon, as of someone turning the pages of a book, but I couldnt be sure.Taking my courage in both hands, I stepped across the threshold.The feeling of desertion was more pronounced in here.There were unmistakable signs of neglect visible; a vase of wilted flowers on the polished surface of a chest, a teacup and saucer left to sit on an occasional table, the dregs dried to a brown stain in the bottom of the cup.Where the hell was everybody?I stopped at the door into the salon and listened again.I heard the quiet crackle of the fire, and again, that soft rustle, as of turning pages.By poking my head around the jamb, I could just see that there was someone seated in front of the secretary now.Someone undeniably male, tall and thin shouldered, dark head bent over something before him.Ian!I hissed, as loudly as I dared.Ian!The figure started, pushed back the chair, and stood up quickly, blinking toward the shadows.Jesus!I said.Mrs.Malcolm?said the Reverend Archibald Campbell, astonished.I swallowed, trying to force my heart down out of my throat.The Reverend looked nearly as startled as I, but it lasted only a moment.Then his features hardened, and he took a step toward the door.What are you doing here?he demanded.Im looking for my husbands nephew, I said; there was no point in lying, and perhaps he knew where Ian was.I glanced quickly round the room, but it was empty, save for the Reverend, and the one small lighted lamp he had been using.Wheres Mrs.Abernathy?I have no idea, he said, frowning.She appears to have left.What do you mean, your husbands nephew?Left?I blinked at him.Where has she gone?I dont know.He scowled, his pointed upper lip clamped beaklike over the lower one.She was gone when I rose this morningand all of the servants with her, apparently.A fine way to treat an invited guest!I relaxed slightly, despite my alarm.At least I was in no danger of running into Geilie.I thought I could deal with the Reverend Campbell.Oh, I said.Well, that does seem a bit inhospitable, I admit.I suppose you havent seen a boy of about fifteen, very tall and thin, with thick dark brown hair?No, I didnt think you had.In that case, I expect I should be go  Stop!He grabbed me by the upper arm, and I stopped, surprised and unsettled by the strength of his grip.What is your husbands true name?he demanded.WhyAlexander Malcolm, I said, tugging at my captive arm.You know that.Indeed.And how is it, then, that when I described you and your husband to Mrs.Abernathy, she told me that your family name is Fraserthat your husband in fact is James Fraser?Oh.I took a deep breath, trying to think of something plausible, but failed.I never had been good at lying on short notice.Where is your husband, woman?he demanded.Look, I said, trying to extract myself from his grasp, youre quite wrong about Jamie.He had nothing to do with your sister, he told me.He  Youve spoken to him about Margaret?His grip tightened.I gave a small grunt of discomfort and yanked a bit harder.Yes.
