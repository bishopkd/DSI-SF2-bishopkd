Then do me!Not yet, he murmured, moving lower, rimming my navel with the tip of his tongue.Youre not ready yet.What?Ah, GodI cant get any readier.I tugged on his hair, trying to pull him up.Gideon caught my wrists and pinned them to the mattress.You have a tight little cunt, Eva.Ill bruise you if I dont get you soft and relaxed.A violent shiver of arousal moved through me.It turned me on when he talked so bluntly about sex.Then he slid lower and I tensed.No, Gideon.I need to shower for that.He buried his face in my cleft and I struggled against his hold, flushed with sudden shame.He nipped at my inner thigh with his teeth.Stop it.Dont.Please.You dont have to do that.His glare stilled my frantic movements.Do you think I feel differently about your body than you do mine?he asked harshly.I want you, Eva.I licked my dry lips, so crazily turned on by his animal need that I couldnt form a single word.He growled softly and dove for the slick flesh between my legs.His tongue pushed into me, licking and parting the sensitive tissues.My hips churned restlessly, my body silently begging for more.It felt so good I couldve wept.God, Eva.Ive wanted my mouth on your cunt every day since I met you.As the velvet softness of his tongue flickered over my swollen clit, my head pressed hard into the pillow.Yes.Like that.Make me come.He did, with the gentlest of suction and a hard lick.I writhed as the orgasm jolted through me, my core tensing violently, my limbs shaking.His tongue thrust into my sex as it convulsed, rippling along the shallow penetration, trying to pull him deeper.His groans vibrated against my swollen flesh, goading the climax to roll on and on.Tears stung my eyes and coursed down my temples, the physical pleasure destroying the wall that kept my emotions at bay.And Gideon didnt stop.He circled the trembling entrance to my body with the tip of his tongue and lapped at my throbbing clit until I quickened again.Two fingers pushed inside me, curving and stroking.I was so sensitive I thrashed against the onslaught.When he drew on my clit with steady, rhythmic suction, I came again, crying out hoarsely.Then he had three fingers in me, twisting and opening me.No.My head tossed from side to side, every inch of my skin tingling and burning.No more.Once more, he coaxed hoarsely.Once more, then Ill fuck you.I cant  You will.He blew a slow stream of air over my wet flesh, the coolness over fevered skin reawakening raw nerve endings.I love watching you come, Eva.Love hearing the sounds you make, the way your body quivers  He massaged a tender spot inside me and an orgasm pulsed through me in a slow, heated roll of delight, no less devastating for being gentler than the two before it.His weight and heat left me.In a distant corner of my dazed mind, I heard a drawer opening, followed swiftly by the sound of foil tearing.The mattress dipped as he returned, his hands rough now as he yanked me down to the center of the bed.He stretched himself on top of me, pinning me, tucking his forearms on the outside of my biceps and pressing them to my sides, capturing me.My gaze was riveted to his austerely beautiful face.His features were harsh with lust, his skin stretched tight over his cheekbones and jaw.His eyes were so dark and dilated they were black, and I knew I was staring into the face of a man whod passed the limits of his control.It was important to me that hed made it that far for my benefit and that hed done so to pleasure and prepare me for what I knew would be a hard ride.My hands fisted in the bedspread, anticipation building.Hed made sure I got mine, over and over again.This would be for him.Fuck me, I ordered, daring him with my eyes.Eva.He snapped out my name as he rammed into me, sinking balls deep in one fierce drive.I gasped.He was big, hard as stone, and so damn deep.The connection was startlingly intense.Emotionally.Mentally.Id never felt so completelytaken.Possessed.I wouldnt have thought I could bear to be restrained during sex, not with my past being what it was, but Gideons total domination of my body ratcheted my desire to an outrageous level.Id never been so hot for it in my life, which seemed insane after what Id experienced with him so far.I clenched around him, relishing the feel of him inside me, filling me.His hips ground against mine, prodding as if to say, Feel me?Im in you.I own you.His entire body hardened, the muscles of his chest and arms straining as he pulled out to the tip.The rigid tightening of his abs was the only warning I got before he slammed forward.Hard.I cried out and his chest rumbled with a low, primitive sound.ChristYou feel so good.Tightening his hold, he starting fucking me, nailing my hips to the mattress with wildly fierce drives.Pleasure rippled through me again, pushing through me with every hot shove of his body into mine.Like this, I thought.I want you just like this.He buried his face in my neck and held me tightly in place, plunging hard and fast, gasping raw, heated sex words that made me crazed with desire.Ive never been so hard and thick.Im so deep in youI can feel it against my stomachfeel my dick pounding into you.Id thought of this round as his, and yet he was still with me, still focused on me, swiveling his hips to stroke pleasure through my melting core.I made a small, helpless sound of need and his mouth slanted over mine.I was desperate for him, my nails digging into his pumping hips, struggling with the grinding urge to rock into the ferocious thrusts of his big cock.We were dripping in sweat, our skin hot and slicked together, our chests heaving for air.As an orgasm brewed like a storm inside me, everything tightened and clenched, squeezing.He cursed and shoved one hand beneath my hip, cupping my rear and lifting me into his thrusts so that his cock head stroked over and over the spot that ached for him.Come, Eva, he ordered harshly.Come now.I climaxed in a rush that had me sobbing his name, the sensation enhanced and magnified by the way hed confined my body.He threw his head back, shuddering.Ah, Eva!He clasped me so tightly I couldnt breathe, his hips pumping as he came long and hard.Ive no idea how long we lay like that, leveled, mouths sliding over shoulders and throats to soothe and calm.My entire body tingled and pulsed.Wow, I managed finally.Youll kill me, he muttered with his lips at my jaw.Were going to end up fucking each other to death.Me?I didnt do anything.Hed controlled me completely and how freakin sexy was that?Youre breathing.Thats enough.I laughed, hugging him.Lifting his head, he nuzzled my nose.Were going to eat, and then well do that again.My brows lifted.You can do that again?All night.He rolled his hips and I could feel that he was still semi hard.Youre a machine, I told him.Or a god.Its you.With a soft sweet kiss, he left me.He removed the condom, wrapped it in a tissue from the nightstand, and tossed the whole in the wastebasket by the bed.Well shower, then order from the restaurant downstairs.Unless you want to go down?I dont think I can walk.The flash of his grin stopped my heart for a minute.Glad Im not the only one.You look fine.I feel phenomenal.He sat back on the side of the bed and brushed my hair back from my forehead.His face was soft, his smile warmly affectionate.I thought I saw something else in his eyes and the possibility closed my throat.It scared me.Shower with me, he said, running his hand down my arm.Gimme me a minute to find my brain, then Ill join you.Okay.He went into the bathroom, giving me a prime view of his sculpted back and perfect ass.I sighed with pure female appreciation of a prime male specimen.The water came on in the shower.I managed to sit up and slide my legs over the side of the bed, feeling exquisitely shaky.My gaze caught on the slightly open bedside drawer and I saw condoms through the gap.My stomach twisted.The hotel was too upscale to be the kind that provided condoms along with the requisite Bible.With a slightly trembling hand, I pulled the drawer out further and found a sizable quantity of prophylactics, including a bottle of feminine lubrication and spermicidal gel.My heart started pounding all over again.In my mind, I backtracked through our lust fueled trip to the hotel.Gideon hadnt asked which rooms were available.Whether he had a master key or not, hed need to know which rooms were occupied before he took oneunless hed known beforehand that this particular room would be empty.Clearly it was his room a fuck pad outfitted with everything hed need to have a good time with the women who served that purpose in his life.As I pushed to my feet and walked over to the closet, I heard the glass shower door open in the bathroom, then close.I caught the two knobs of the louvered walnut closet doors and pushed them apart.There was a small selection of mens clothes hanging on the metal rod, some business shirts and slacks, as well as khakis and jeans.My temperature dropped and a sick misery spread through my orgasmic high.The right side dresser drawers held neatly folded T shirts, boxer briefs, and socks.The top one on the left side held sex toys still in their packages.I didnt look at the drawers below that one.Id seen enough.I pulled on my pants and stole one of Gideons shirts.As I dressed, my mind went through the steps Id learned in therapy: Talk it out.Explain what triggered the negative feelings to your partner.Face the trigger and work through it.Maybe if Id been less shaken by the depth of my feelings for Gideon, I could have done all that.Maybe if we hadnt just had mind blowing sex, I would have felt less raw and vulnerable.Id never know.What I felt was slightly dirty, a little bit used, and a whole lot hurt.This particular revelation had hit me with excruciating force, and like a child, I wanted to hurt him back.I scooped up the condoms, lube, and toys, and tossed them on the bed.Then, just as he called out my name in an amused and teasing voice, I picked up my bag and left him.10  I kept my head down as I made the walk of shame past the registration desk and exited the hotel through a side door.I was red faced with embarrassment remembering the manager whod greeted Gideon as we got on the elevator.I could only imagine what hed thought of me.He had to know what Gideon reserved that room for.I couldnt stand the thought of being the next in a line of many and yet thats exactly what Id been from the moment we entered the hotel.How hard would it have been to stop by the front desk and secure a room that was ours alone?I started walking with no direction or destination in mind.It was dark out now, the city taking on a whole new life and energy from what it had during the business day.Steaming food carts dotted the sidewalks, along with a vendor selling framed artwork, another hawking novelty T shirts, and yet another who had two folding tables covered in movie and television episode scripts.With every step I took, the adrenaline from my flight burned away.The maliciously gleeful thoughts of Gideon coming out of the bathroom to find an empty room and paraphernalia strewn bed ran their course.I began to calm downand seriously think about what had just happened.Was it a coincidence that Gideon invited me to a gym that just so happened to be conveniently close to his fuck pad?I remembered the conversation wed had in his office over lunch and the way hed struggled to express himself to keep me.He was as confused and torn about what was happening between us as I was, and I knew how easy it was to fall into established patterns.After all, hadnt I just fallen into one of my own by bailing?Id spent enough years in therapy to know better than to wound and run when I was hurting.Heartsick, I stepped into an Italian bistro and took a table.I ordered a glass of shiraz and a pizza margherita, hoping wine and food would calm the vibrating anxiety inside me so that I could think properly.When the waiter returned with my wine, I gulped down half the glass without really tasting it.I missed Gideon already, missed the playful happy mood hed been in when I left.His scent was all over me the smell of his skin and hot, grinding sex.My eyes stung and I let a few tears slide down my face, despite being in a very public, very busy restaurant.My food came and I picked at it.It tasted like cardboard, although I doubted that had anything to do with the chef or the venue.Pulling over the chair where Id set my bag, I dug out my new smartphone with the intention of leaving a message with Dr.Traviss answering service.Hed suggested we have video chat appointments until I found a new therapist in New York and I decided to take him up on that offer.Thats when I noticed the twenty one missed calls from Gideon and a text; I fucked up again.Dont break up with me.Talk to me.Pls.The tears welled again.I held the phone to my heart, at a loss for what to do.I couldnt get the images of Gideon and other women out of my mind.I couldnt stop picturing him fucking the hell out of another woman on that same bed, using toys on her, driving her crazy, taking his pleasure from her body  It was irrational and pointless to think of such things, and it made me feel petty and small and physically sick.I startled when the phone vibrated against me, nearly dropping it.Nursing my misery, I debating letting it go to voice mail because I could see on the screen that it was Gideon plus he was the only one who had the number but I couldnt ignore it, because he was clearly frantic.As much as Id wanted to wound him earlier, I couldnt stand to do it now.Hello.My voice didnt sound like mine, clogged as it was with tears and emotion.Eva!Thank God.Gideon sounded so anxious.Where are you?Looking around, I didnt see anything that would tell me the name of the restaurant.I dont know.IIm sorry, Gideon.No, Eva.Dont.Its my fault.I need to find you.Can you describe where youre at?Did you walk?Yes.I walked.I know which exit you took.Which way did you head?He was breathing quickly and I could hear the sounds of traffic and car horns in the background.To the left.Did you turn any corners after that?I dont think so.I dont know.I looked around for a server I could ask.Im in a restaurant.Italian.Theres seating on the sidewalkand a wrought iron fence.French doorsJesus, Gideon, I   He appeared, silhouetted in the entrance with the phone held to his ear.I knew him immediately, watched as he froze when he saw me seated against the wall toward the back.Shoving the phone into the pocket of jeans hed had stored at the hotel, he strode past the hostess whod starting speaking to him and headed straight for me.I barely managed to get to my feet before he hauled me against him and embraced me tightly.God.He shook slightly and buried his face in my neck.Eva.I hugged him back.He was fresh from a shower, making me achingly aware of my need for one.I cant be here, he said hoarsely, pulling back to cup my face in his hands.I cant be in public right now.Will you come home with me?Something on my face must have betrayed my lingering wariness, because he pressed his lips to my forehead and murmured, It wont be like the hotel, I promise.My mothers the only woman whos ever been to my place, aside from the housekeeper and staff.This is stupid, I muttered.Im being stupid.No.He brushed the hair back from my face and bent closer to whisper in my ear.If youd taken me to a place you reserved for fucking other men, I wouldve lost it.The waiter returned and we pulled apart.Should I get you a menu, sir?That wont be necessary.Gideon dug his wallet out of his back pocket and handed over his credit card.Were leaving.We took a cab to Gideons place and he held on to my hand the entire time.I shouldnt have been so nervous riding a private elevator up to a penthouse apartment on Fifth Avenue.The sight of high ceilings and prewar architecture wasnt new to me, and really, it was all to be expected when dating a man who seemed to own damn near everything.And the coveted view of Central Parkwell, of course hed have one.But Gideons tension was palpable, and it made me realize that this was a big deal to him.When the elevator opened directly into his apartments marbled entry foyer, his grip on my hand tightened before he released me.He unlocked the double door entrance to usher me inside, and I could feel his anxiety as he watched for my reaction.Gideons home was as beautiful as the man himself.It was so very different from his office, which was sleek, modern, and cool.His private space was warm and sumptuous, filled with antiques and art anchored by gorgeous Aubusson rugs laid over gleaming hardwood floors.Itsamazing, I said softly, feeling privileged to see it.It was a glimpse into the private Gideon I was desperate to know and it was stunning.Come in.He tugged me deeper into the apartment.I want you to sleep here tonight.I dont have clothes and stuff  All you need is the toothbrush in your purse.We can run by your place in the morning for the rest.I promise to get you to work on time.He pulled me into him and set his chin on the crown of my head.Id really like you to stay, Eva.I dont blame you for running, but it scared the hell out of me.I need to hang on to you for a while.I need to be held.I pushed my hands under the back of his T shirt to caress the silken hardness of his bare back.I could also use a shower.With his nose in my hair, he inhaled deeply.I like you smelling like me.But he led me through the living room and down a hall to his bedroom.Wow, I breathed when he flicked on the light.A massive sleigh bed dominated the space, the wood dark which he seemed to prefer and the linens a soft cream.The rest of the furnishings matched the bed and the accents were brushed gold.It was a warm, masculine space with no art on the walls to detract from the serene night view of Central Park and the magnificent residential buildings on the other side.My side of Manhattan.The bathrooms in here.As I took in the vanity, which appeared to have been made out of an antique claw footed walnut cabinet, he pulled towels out of a companion armoire and set them out for me, moving with that confident sensual grace I admired so much.Seeing him in his home, dressed so casually, touched me.Knowing I was the only woman to have this experience with him affected me even more.I felt like I was seeing him more naked now than I ever had.Thank you.He glanced at me and seemed to understand that I was talking about more than the towels.His stare burned through me.It feels good to have you here.I have no idea how I ended up like this, with you.But I really, really liked it.Does it matter?Gideon came to me, tilting my chin up to press a kiss to the tip of my nose.Ill lay out a T shirt for you on the bed.Caviar and vodka sound good to you?Wellthats quite a step up from pizza.He smiled.Petrossians Ossetra.I stand corrected.I smiled back.Several hundred steps up.I showered and dressed in the oversized Cross Industries shirt he laid out for me; then I called Cary to tell him Id be out all night and give him a brief rundown about the hotel incident.He whistled.Im not even sure what to say about that.A speechless Cary Taylor spoke volumes.I joined Gideon in the living room, and we sat on the floor at the coffee table to eat the prized caviar with mini toast and crme fraiche.We watched a rerun of a New York set police procedural that just happened to include a scene filmed on the street in front of the Crossfire.I think itd be cool to see a building I owned on TV like that, I said.Its not bad, if they dont close off the street for hours to film.I bumped shoulders with him.Pessimist.We crawled into Gideons bed at ten thirty and watched the last half of a show while curled up together.Sexual tension crackled in the air between us, but he didnt make any overtures so I didnt either.I suspected he was still trying to make amends for the hotel, trying to prove that he wanted to spend time with me not actively fucking.It worked.As much as I desired his outrageously sexy body, it felt good just hanging out together.He slept in the nude, which was fabulous for me to cuddle up against.I tossed one leg over his, wrapped an arm around his waist, and rested my cheek over his heart.I dont remember the ending of the show, so I suppose I fell asleep before it was over.When I woke it was still dark in the room and Id rolled to the far side of my half of the bed.I sat up to see the digital clock face on Gideons nightstand and found it was barely three in the morning.I usually slept straight through the night and thought maybe the strange surroundings were keeping me from sleeping deeply; then Gideon moaned and shifted restlessly and I realized what had disturbed me.The sound he made was pained, his subsequent hiss of breath tormented.Dont touch me, he whispered harshly.Get your fucking hands off of me!I froze, my heart racing.His words sliced through the dark, filled with fury.You sick bastard.He writhed, his legs kicking at the covers.His back arched on a groan that sounded perversely erotic.Dont.Ah, ChristIt hurts.He strained, his body twisting.I couldnt bear it.Gideon.Because Cary had nightmares sometimes, I knew better than to touch a man in the throes of one.Instead, I knelt on my side of the bed and called his name.Gideon, wake up.Stilling abruptly, he fell to his back, tense and expectant.His chest heaved with panting breaths.His cock was hard and lay heavily along his belly.I spoke firmly, although my heart was breaking.Gideon.Youre dreaming.Come back to me.He deflated into the mattress.Eva?Im here.Shifting, I moved out of the way of the moonlight, but saw no luminous glitter that would tell me his eyes were open.Are you awake?His breathing began to slow, but he didnt speak.His hands were fisted in the bottom sheet.I pulled the shirt I was wearing over my head and dropped it on the bed.I sidled closer, reaching out with a tentative hand to touch his arm.When he didnt move, I caressed him, my fingertips sliding gently over the hard muscle of his biceps.Gideon?He jerked awake.What?What is it?I sat back on my heels with my hands on my thighs.I saw him blink at me, and then shove both hands through his hair.I could feel the nightmare clinging to him, could sense it in the rigidness of his body.Whats wrong?he asked gruffly, pushing up onto one elbow.You okay?I want you.I stretched out against him, aligning my bare body to his.Pressing my face into his damp throat, I sucked gently on his salty skin.I knew from my own nightmares that being held and loved could push the specters back into the closet for a little while.His arms came around me, his hands running up and down the curve of my spine.I felt him let go of the dream with a long, deep sigh.Pushing him to his back, I climbed over him and sealed my mouth over his.His erection was notched between the lips of my sex and I rocked against him.The feel of his hands in my hair, holding me to take control of the kiss, quickly made me wet and ready.Fire licked just beneath my skin.I stroked my clit up and down his thick length, using him to masturbate until he made a rough sound of desire and rolled to put me beneath him.I dont have any condoms in the house, he murmured before wrapping his lips around my nipple and sucking gently.I loved that he wasnt prepared.This wasnt his fuck pad; this was his home and I was the only lover hed brought into it.I know you mentioned swapping bills of health when we talked about birth control and thats the responsible way to go, but   I trust you.He lifted his head, looking at me in the faint light of the moon.Kneeing my legs open, he pushed the first bare inch inside me.He was scorching hot and silky soft.Eva, he breathed, clutching me tightly to him.Ive neverChrist, you feel so good.Im so glad youre here.I tugged his lips down to mine and kissed him.Me, too.I woke the way Id fallen asleep, with Gideon on top of me and inside me.His gaze was heavy lidded with desire as I rose from unconsciousness into heated pleasure.His hair hung around his shoulders and face, looking even sexier for being sleep tousled.But best of all, there were no shadows in his gorgeous eyes, nothing lingering from the pain that haunted his dreams.I hope you dont mind, he murmured with a wicked grin, sliding in and out.Youre warm and soft.I cant help but want you.I stretched my arms over my head and arched my back, pressing my breasts into his chest.Through the slender arch topped windows, I saw the soft light of dawn fill the sky.UmmI could get used to waking up like this.That was my thought at three this morning.He rolled his hips and sank deep into me.I thought Id return the favor.My body revved to life, my pulse quickening.Yes, please.Cary was gone when we got to my apartment, leaving a note behind to tell me he was on a job, but would be back in plenty of time for pizza with Trey.Since Id been too upset to enjoy my pie the night before, I was ready to try again when I was having a good time.I have a business dinner tonight, Gideon said, leaning over my shoulder to read.I was hoping youd come with me and make it bearable.I cant bail out on Cary, I said apologetically, turning to face him.Chicks before dicks and all that.His mouth twitched and he caged me to the breakfast bar.He was dressed for work in a suit Id picked out, a graphite gray Prada with a soft sheen.His tie was the blue one that matched his eyes, and as Id lain on his bed and watched him dress, Id had to fight the urge to take it all off him.Cary isnt a chick.But I get the point.I want to see you tonight.Can I come over after the dinner and stay the night?Heated anticipation rushed through me.I smoothed my hands over his vest, feeling like I had a special secret because I knew exactly what he looked like without his clothes on.Id love it if you did.Good.He gave a satisfied nod.Ill make us coffee, while you get dressed.The beans are in the freezer.The grinders next to the coffee pot.I pointed.And I like lots of milk and a little sweetener.When I came out twenty minutes later, Gideon grabbed two travel mugs of coffee off the breakfast bar and we headed down to the lobby.Paul hustled us out the front door and into the backseat of Gideons waiting Bentley SUV.As Gideons driver pulled into traffic, Gideon checked me out and said, Youre definitely trying to kill me.Are you wearing the garters again?Pulling the hem of my skirt up, I showed him where the top of my black silk stockings hooked to my black lace garter belt.His muttered curse made me smile.Id chosen a black short sleeved silk turtleneck sweater paired with a decently short pleated skirt in lipstick red and heeled Mary Janes.Because Cary hadnt been around to manage something fancy with my hair, Id pulled it back in a ponytail.You like?Im hard.His voice was husky, and he adjusted himself in his trousers.How the hell am I going to get through the day thinking about you dressed like that?Theres always lunch, I suggested, fantasizing about a nooner on Gideons office couch.I have a business lunch today.Id reschedule, if I hadnt moved it already yesterday.You rescheduled an appointment for me?Im flattered.He reached over and brushed his fingertips over my cheek, a now habitual gesture of affection that was tender and fiercely intimate.I was coming to depend on receiving those touches.I leaned my cheek into his palm.Can you carve fifteen minutes out of your day for me?Ill manage it.Call me when you know the time.Taking a deep breath, I dug into my bag and wrapped my hand around a gift I wasnt sure hed want, but I couldnt get the memory of his nightmare out of my head.I hoped that what I had for him would remind him of me and three A. M.  sex, and help him cope.I have something.I thought  It suddenly seemed conceited to give him what Id brought.He frowned.Whats wrong?Nothing.Its just I exhaled in a rush.Listen, I have something for you, but I just realized its one of those gifts well, its not really a gift.Im already thinking its not appropriate and   He thrust out his hand.Give it to me.You can totally decide not to take it   Shut up, Eva.He crooked his fingers.Give it to me.I pulled it out of my bag and handed it over.Gideon stared down at the framed photograph in complete silence.It was a novelty frame depicting die cut images of things relating to graduation, including a digital clock face that read 3:00 A. M.  The picture was of me posing on Coronado Beach in a coral bikini with a big floppy straw hat I was tanned, happy, and blowing a kiss to Cary, whod playacted the role of a high fashion photographer by calling out ridiculous encouragements.Beautiful, dahling.Show me sassy.Show me sexy.Brilliant.Show me cattyrawr  Embarrassed, I squirmed a little on the seat.Like I said, you dont have to keep   I  He cleared his throat.Thank you, Eva.Ah, well I was grateful to see the Crossfire outside my window.I jumped out quickly when the driver pulled over and ran my hands over my skirt, feeling self conscious.If you want, I can hang on to it until later.Gideon shut the door of the Bentley and shook his head.Its mine.Youre not taking it back.He linked our fingers together and gestured toward the revolving door with the hand holding the frame.I warmed when I realized he intended to take my picture into work with him.One of the fun things about the ad business was that no day was ever the same as the one before it.I was hopping all morning and was just beginning to contemplate what to do about lunch when my phone rang.Mark Garritys office, Eva Tramell speaking.Ive got news, Cary said by way of greeting.What?I could tell by his voice that it was good news, whatever it was.I landed a Grey Isles campaign.Oh my God!Cary, thats awesome!I love their jeans.What are you doing for lunch?I grinned.Celebrating with you.Can you be here at noon?Im already on my way.I hung up and rocked back in my chair, so thrilled for Cary I felt like dancing.Needing something to do to kill the fifteen minutes remaining before my lunch break, I checked my inbox again and found a Google alert digest for Gideons name.Over thirty mentions, in just one day.I opened the e mail and freaked out a little at the numerous mystery woman headlines.I clicked on the first link and found myself landing on a gossip blog.There, in living color, was a photo of Gideon kissing me senseless on the sidewalk outside of his gym.The accompanying article was short and to the point:  Gideon Cross, New Yorks most eligible bachelor since John F.  Kennedy Jr., was spotted yesterday in a passionate public embrace.A source at Cross Industries identified the lucky mystery woman as socialite Eva Tramell, daughter of multimillionaire Richard Stanton and his wife, Monica.When queried about the nature of the relationship between Cross and Tramell, the source confirmed that Miss Tramell is the significant woman in the moguls life at present.We imagine hearts are breaking across the country this morning.Oh, crap, I breathed.11  I quickly clicked through other links in the digest to find the same picture with similar captions and articles.Alarmed, I sat back and thought about what this meant.If one kiss was headline news, what chance would Gideon and I have to make a relationship work?My hands werent quite steady as I closed the browser tabs.I hadnt considered the press coverage, but I should have.Damn it.Anonymity was my friend.It protected me from my past.It protected my family from embarrassment, and Gideon, too.I didnt even have any social networking accounts so people who werent actively in my life couldnt find me.A thin, invisible wall between me and exposure was gone.Hell, I breathed, finding myself in a painful situation I could have avoided if Id dedicated any of my brain cells to something other than Gideon.There was also his reaction to this mess to considerI cringed inwardly just thinking about it.And my mother.It wouldnt be long before she was calling and blowing everything out of   Shit.Remembering that she didnt have my new cell number, I picked up my desk phone and called my other voice mail to see if shed already tried to reach me.I winced when I heard that my mailbox was full.I hung up and grabbed my purse; then headed off to lunch, knowing Cary would help me put it all in perspective.I was so flustered when I reached the lobby level that I rushed out of the elevator with my only thought being to find my roommate.When I spotted him, I didnt take note of anyone else until Gideon sidestepped smoothly in front of me and blocked my path.Eva.He frowned down at me.Cupping my elbow, he turned me slightly around.Thats when I saw the two women and a man whod hidden him from my view.I managed to find a smile for them.Hello.Gideon introduced me to his lunch dates.Then he excused us and tugged me off to the side.Whats wrong?Youre upset.Its all over the place, I whispered.A picture of us together.He nodded.Ive seen it.I blinked up at him, confused at his nonchalance.Youre okay with it?Why wouldnt I be?For once, theyre reporting the truth.A sneaking suspicion niggled at me.You planned it.You planted the story.Not entirely true, he said smoothly.The photographer happened to be there.I just gave him a picture worth printing, and told PR to make it clear who you are and what you are to me.Why?Why would you do that?You have your way of dealing with jealousy and I have mine.Were both off the market and now everyone knows it.Why is that a problem for you?I was worried about your reaction, but theres moreThere are things you dont know and I  I took a deep, shaky breath.It cant be that way between us, Gideon.We cant be public.I dont want Damn it.Ill embarrass you.You couldnt.Its not possible.He brushed a loose lock of hair off my face.Can we talk about this later?If you need me   No, its okay.Go.Cary came over.Dressed in baggy black cargo pants and a V neck white undershirt, he still managed to look expensive.Everything all right?Hi, Cary.Everythings fine.Gideon squeezed my hand.Enjoy your lunch and dont worry.He could say that because he didnt know better.And I didnt know whether or not hed still want me once he did.Cary faced me as Gideon walked away.Worry about what?Whats wrong?Everything.I sighed.Lets get out of here, and Ill tell you over lunch.Well, Cary murmured, looking at the link Id forwarded from my smartphone to his.Thats some kiss.The dip was a great touch.He couldnt look more into if he tried.Thats the thing.I took another big gulp of water.He did try.He shoved his phone into his pocket.Last week you kept shooting him down for only wanting your vagina.This week hes publicizing that hes in a committed, passionate relationship with you, and youre still unhappy.Im starting to feel bad for the guy.He cant win for trying.That stung.Reporters are going to dig, Cary, and theyre going to find dirt.And since its juicy dirt theyre going to splash it all over hell and back, and its going to embarrass Gideon.Baby girl.He set his hand over mine.Stanton buried all that.Stanton.I straightened.I hadnt thought of my stepfather.Hed see the disaster coming and keep a lid on it because he knew what the revelation would do to my mother.StillIll have to talk to Gideon about it.He has a right to be warned.Just the thought of that conversation made me miserable.Cary knew how my brain worked.If you think hes going to cut and run, I think youre wrong.He looks at you like youre the only person in the room.I poked at my tuna Caesar salad.Hes got a few demons of his own.Nightmares.Hes closed himself off, I think, because of whatevers eating at him.But hes let you in.And hed already shown hints of how possessive he could be about that connection.I accepted that because it was a flaw I shared, but still  Youre analyzing this to death, Eva, Cary said.Youre thinking the way he feels about you has to be a fluke or a mistake.Someone like him couldnt really be into you for your big heart and sharp mind, right?My self esteem isnt that bad, I protested.He took a sip of his champagne.Isnt it?So tell me something you think he likes about you that doesnt have to do with sex or codependency.I thought about it and came up empty, which made me scowl.Right, he went on with a nod.And if Cross is anywhere near as messed up as we are, hes thinking the same thing in reverse, wondering what a hot babe like you sees in a guy like him.Youve got money, so what has he got going for him besides being a stud who keeps screwing up?Sitting back in my chair, I absorbed everything hed said.Cary, I love you madly.He grinned.Back atcha, sweets.My advice, for what its worth?Couples therapy.Its always been my plan to get into it when I find the one I want to settle down with.And try to have fun with him.Youve got to have as many good times as bad or it all becomes too painful and too much work.I reached over and squeezed his hand.Thank you.For what?He shrugged off my gratitude with an elegant wave of his hand.Its easy to pick apart someone elses life.You know I couldnt get through my rough spots without you.Which you dont have any of now, I pointed out, shifting the focus to him.Youre about to be splashed across a Times Square billboard.You wont be my secret any longer.Should we upgrade dinner from pizza to something more worthy of the occasion?How about we haul out that case of Cristal Stanton gave us?Now youre talking.Movies?Anything in particular you want to watch?Whatever you want.I wouldnt want to screw with your big dumb blow em up movie genius.I grinned, feeling better as Id known I would after an hour with Cary.Youll let me know if Im too dense to figure out when you and Trey want to be alone.Ha!Dont worry about that.Your tempestuous love life is making me feel dull and boring.I could use a hot, sweaty bang with my own stud.You just had a maintenance closet romp a couple days ago!He sighed.Id nearly forgotten.How sad is that?It isnt when your eyes are laughing.Id just gotten back to my desk when I checked my smartphone and found a text from Gideon letting me know he had fifteen minutes to spare at quarter to three.I nursed a secret rush of anticipation for the next hour and a half, having decided to take Carys advice and have a little fun.Gideon and I would have to wade through the ugliness of my past soon enough, but for now, I could give us both something to smile about.I texted him just before I left, letting him know I was on my way.Considering the time constraints, we couldnt waste a minute.Gideon must have felt the same way, because I found Scott waiting for me at reception when I reached the Cross Industries waiting area.He walked me back after the receptionist buzzed me in.Hows your day been?I asked him.He smiled.Great so far.Yours?I smiled back.Ive had worse.Gideon was on the phone when I entered his office.His tone was clipped and impatient as he told the person on the other end of the line that they should be able to manage the job without him having to oversee it personally.He held up one finger to me to tell me hed be another minute.I responded by blowing a big bubble with the gum I was chewing and popping it loudly.His brows shot up, and he hit the buttons to close the doors and frost the glass wall.Grinning, I sauntered over to his desk and hopped onto it, curling my fingers around the lip and swinging my legs.He popped the next bubble I blew with a quick jab of his finger.I pouted prettily.Deal with it, he said with quiet authority to whoever was on the phone.Itll be next week before I can get out there and waiting will set us back further.Stop talking.I have something time sensitive on my desk and youre keeping me away from it.I guarantee thats not improving my disposition.Fix what needs fixing and report back to me tomorrow.He returned the phone to its cradle with suppressed violence.Eva   I held up one hand to cut him off and wrapped my gum in a Post it I took from a dispenser on his desk.Before you reprimand me, Mr.Cross, I want to say that when we reached an impasse in our merger discussions at the hotel yesterday I shouldnt have walked out.It didnt help to resolve the situation.And I know I didnt react very well to the PR issue with the photo.But stillEven though Ive been a naughty secretary, I think I should be given another chance to excel.His gaze narrowed as he studied me, assessing and reevaluating the situation on the fly.Did I ask for your opinion on the appropriate action to take, Miss Tramell?I shook my head and looked up at him from beneath my lashes.I could see the lingering frustration from his phone call falling away from him, replaced by his growing interest and arousal.Hopping down from the desk, I sidled closer and smoothed his immaculate tie with both hands.Cant we work something out?I do possess a wide variety of useful skills.He caught me by the hips.Which is one of the many reasons youre the only woman Ive ever considered for the position.Warmth flowed through me at his words.Boldly cupping his cock in my hand, I fondled him through his slacks.Maybe I should reapply myself to my duties?I could demonstrate some of the ways Im uniquely qualified to assist you.Gideon hardened with delectable swiftness.Such initiative, Miss Tramell.But my next meeting is less than ten minutes away.Also, Im not accustomed to exploring job enrichment opportunities in my office.I freed the button of his fly and lowered his zipper.With my lips to his jaw, I whispered, If you think theres anywhere I wont make you come, youll have to revisit and revise.Eva, he breathed, his eyes hot and tender.He cupped my throat, his thumbs brushing over my jaw.Youre unraveling me.Do you know that?Are you doing it on purpose?I reached inside his boxer briefs and wrapped my hands around him, offering up my lips for a kiss.He obliged me, taking my mouth with a fierceness that left me breathless.I want you, he growled.I sank to my knees on the carpeted floor, pulling his pants down enough to give me the access I needed.He exhaled harshly.Eva, what are you   My lips flowed over the wide crown.He reached back for the edge of his desk, his hands curling around the lip with white knuckled force.I held him with both hands and mouthed the plush head, sucking gently.The softness of his skin and his uniquely appealing scent made me moan.I felt the vibration ripple through his entire body and heard a rough sound rumble in his chest.Gideon touched my cheek.Lick it.Aroused by the command, I fluttered my tongue across the underside and shivered with delight when he rewarded me with a hot burst of pre cum.Fisting the root of him with one hand, I hollowed my cheeks and drew rhythmically, hoping for more.I wished I had the time to make it last.Drive him crazy  He made a sound filled with the sweetest agony.God, Evayour mouth.Keep sucking.Like thathard and deep.I was so turned on by his pleasure I squirmed.His hands pushed into my bound hair, pulling and tugging at the roots.I loved how he started out with tenderness, then grew rougher as the lust he felt for me overwhelmed his control.The soft bite of pain made me hungrier, greedier.My head bobbed as I pleasured him, jacking him with one hand while I sucked and stroked the crest with my mouth.Heavy veins coursed the length of his cock, and I slid the flat of my tongue along them, tilting my head to find and caress each one.He swelled, growing thicker and longer.My knees were uncomfortable, but I didnt care; my gaze was riveted to Gideon as his head fell back and he fought for breath.Eva, you suck me so good.He held my head still and took over.Thrusting his hips.Fucking my mouth.Stripped to a level of base need where only the race to orgasm mattered.The thought made me crazed, the image in my mind of how we must look: Gideon in all his urbane sophistication, standing at the desk where he ruled an empire, stroking his big cock in and out of my greedy mouth.I gripped his straining thighs in both hands, frantically working my lips and tongue, desperate for his climax.His balls were heavy and big, an audacious display of his powerful virility.I cupped them, rolling them gently, feeling them tighten and draw up.Ah, Eva.His voice was a guttural rasp.His grip tightened in my hair.Youre making me come.The first spurt of semen was so thick, I struggled to swallow.Mindless in his pleasure, Gideon was thrusting against the back of my throat, his cock throbbing with every wrenching pulse into my mouth.My eyes watered and my lungs burned, but still I pumped my fists, milking him.His entire body shuddered as I took everything he had.The sounds he made and the muttered, breathless praise were the most gratifying Id ever heard.I licked him clean, marveling at how he didnt fully soften even after an explosive orgasm.He was still capable of fucking me senseless and more than willing to, I knew.But there was no time and I was happy about that.I wanted to do this for him.For us.For me, really, because I needed to know I could indulge in a selfless sexual act without feeling taken advantage of.I have to go, I murmured, standing and pressing my lips to his.I hope the rest of your day is awesome, and your business dinner tonight, too.I started to move away, but he caught my wrist, his gaze on the clock readout on his desk phone.I noticed my picture then, sitting in a place of prominence where hed see it all day.EvaDamn it.Wait.I frowned at his tone, which sounded anxious.Frustrated.He quickly restored his appearance, tucking himself back into his boxer briefs and straightening the tail of his shirt so he could fasten his pants.There was something sweet in watching him pull himself back together, restoring the faade he wore for the world while I knew at least a little of the man beneath it.Tugging me close, Gideon pressed his lips to my brow.His hands moved through my hair to unclip my tortoise barrette.I didnt get you off.No need.I loved the feel of his hands on my scalp.That rocked just the way it was.He was overly focused on fixing my hair, his cheeks flushed from his orgasm.I know you need an even exchange, he argued gruffly.I cant let you leave feeling like I used you.A bittersweet tenderness pierced me.Hed listened.He cared.I cupped his face in my hands.You did use me, with my permission, and it was seriously hot.I wanted to give you this, Gideon.Remember?I warned you.I wanted you to have this memory of me.His eyes widened with alarm.Why the fuck do I need memories when I have you?Eva, if this is about the photo   Shut up and enjoy the high.We didnt have the time to get into the photo issue now and I didnt want to.It was going to ruin everything.If wed had an hour, I still wouldnt let you get me off.Im not keeping score with you, ace.And honestly, youre the first guy I can say that to.Now, I have to go.You have to go.I started away again, but he caught me back.Scotts voice came through the speaker.Excuse me, Mr.Cross.But your three oclock is here.Its okay, Gideon, I assured him.Youre coming over tonight, right?Nothing could keep me away.I shoved up onto my tiptoes and kissed his cheek.Well talk then.After work, I took the stairs down to the ground floor to feel less guilty about skipping the gym and seriously regretted it by the time I reached the lobby.Lack of sleep from the night before had left me wiped out.I was contemplating taking the subway rather than walking when I saw Gideons Bentley at the curb.When the driver got out and greeted me by name, I halted abruptly, surprised.Mr.Cross asked that I take you home, he said, looking smart in his black suit and chauffeur hat.He was an older gentleman with graying red hair, pale blue eyes, and the softest of cultured accents.As much as my legs ached, I was grateful for the offer.Thank you?Im sorry what was your name?Angus, Miss Tramell.How had I not remembered that?The name was so cool, it made me smile.Thank you, Angus.He tipped his hat.My pleasure.I slid through the back door he opened for me and as I settled into the seat, I caught a glimpse of the handgun he wore in a shoulder holster beneath his jacket.It appeared that Angus, like Clancy, was both bodyguard and driver.We pulled away from the curb and I asked, How long have you been working for Mr.Cross, Angus?Eight years now.Quite a while.Ive known him longer than that, he volunteered, catching my gaze in the rearview mirror.I drove him to school when he was a boy.He hired me away from Mr.Vidal when the time came.Once again, I tried to picture Gideon as a child.No doubt hed been beautiful and charismatic even then.Had he enjoyed normal sexual relationships when he was a teenager?I couldnt imagine that women werent throwing themselves at him even then.And as innately sexual as he was, I imagined hed been a horny teen.Digging in my purse, I pulled out my keys and leaned forward to set them on the front passenger seat.Can you see that Gideon gets those?Hes supposed to come over after whatever it is hes doing tonight and depending on how late that is, I might not hear him knock.Of course.Paul opened the door for me when we arrived at my apartment and he greeted Angus by name, reminding me that Gideon owned the building.I waved to both men, told the front desk Gideon would be coming over later, and then took myself upstairs.Carys raised brows when he opened the door to me made me laugh.Gideons coming over later, I explained, but Im feeling so hammered right now I may not stay up long.So I gave him my keys to let himself in.Did you order already?I did.And I tossed a few bottles of Cristal in the wine fridge.Youre the best.I shoved my bag at him.I showered and called my mom from the phone in my room, wincing at her strident, I have been trying to reach you for days!Mom, if its about Gideon Cross   Well, of course, its partly about him!For goodness sake, Eva.Youre being called the significant woman in his life.How could I not want to talk about that?Mom   But theres also the appointment you asked me to make with Dr.Petersen.The note of smug amusement in her voice made me smile.Were scheduled to meet with him Thursday at six oclock in the evening.I hope that works for you.He doesnt do many evening appointments.I plopped backward onto my bed with a sigh.Id been so distracted by work and Gideon that the appointment had slipped my mind.Thursday at six will be fine.Thank you.Now, then.Tell me about Cross  When I emerged from my bedroom dressed in jersey pants and a San Diego State University sweatshirt, I found Trey seated with Cary in the living room.Both men stood when I came in and Trey gifted me with an open, friendly smile.Im sorry I look so ragged, I said sheepishly, running my fingers through my damp ponytail.Taking the stairs at work almost killed me today.Elevator take the day off?he asked.Nope.My brain did.What the hell was I thinking?Spending the night with Gideon was enough of a workout.The doorbell rang and Cary went to get it while I headed into the kitchen for the Cristal.I joined him at the breakfast bar as he signed the credit card receipt and the look in his eyes when he glanced at Trey had me hiding a smile.There were a lot of those looks going back and forth between the two men as the evening progressed.And I had to agree with Cary that Trey was a hottie.Dressed in distressed jeans, matching vest, and a long sleeved shirt, the aspiring veterinarian looked casual but well put together.He was very different personality wise from the type of guy Cary usually dated.Trey seemed more grounded; not quite somber, but definitely not flighty.I thought hed be a good influence on Cary, if they stayed together long enough.The three of us made it through two bottles of Cristal and two pizzas between us, plus all of Demolition Man before I called it a night.I urged Trey to stay for Driven to round out the Stallone mini marathon; then I went to my room and changed into a sexy black baby doll Id been given as part of a bridesmaid gift bag sans the matching panties.Leaving a candle burning for Gideon, I crashed.I woke to darkness and the scent of Gideons skin, the lights and sounds of the city shut out by soundproofed windows and blackout drapes.Gideon slid over me, a moving shadow, his bare skin cool to the touch.His mouth slanted over mine, kissing me slow and deeply, tasting of mint and his own unique flavor.My hands slid down his sleekly muscular back, my legs parting so he could settle comfortably between them.The weight of him against me made my heart sigh and my blood warm with desire.Well, hello to you, too, I said breathlessly when he let me up for air.Youll come with me next time, he murmured in that sexy and decadent voice, nibbling at my throat.Will I?I teased.He reached down and cupped my butt in his hand, squeezing and lifting me into a deft roll of his hips.Yes.I missed you, Eva.I ran my fingers through his hair, wishing I could see him.You havent known me long enough to miss me.Shows how much you know, Gideon scoffed, sliding downward and nuzzling between my breasts.I gasped as his mouth covered my nipple and sucked through the satin, deep pulls that echoed in the clenching of my core.He moved to my other breast, his hand pushing up the hem of my baby doll.I arched into him, lost to the magic of his mouth as it moved over my body, his tongue dipping into my navel, then sliding lower.And you missed me, too, he purred with masculine satisfaction, the tip of his middle finger rimming my cleft.Youre swollen and wet for me.He pulled my legs over his shoulders and licked between my folds, soft and provocative laps of hot velvet against my sensitive flesh.My hands fisted in the sheet, my chest heaving as he circled my clit with the tip of his tongue, then nudged the hypersensitive knot of nerves.I keened, my hips moving restlessly into the devious torment, my muscles tightening with the clawing need to come.The light, teasing flutters were driving me insane, giving me just enough to make me writhe but not enough to get me off.Gideon, please.Not yet.He tortured me, coaxing my body to the brink of orgasm, and then letting me slide back down.Over and over.Until sweat misted my skin and my heart felt like it would burst.His tongue was tireless and diabolical, cleverly focusing on my clit until a single stroke would set me off, then moving lower to thrust into me.The soft, shallow plunges were maddening, the flickering against the nerve laden tissues making me desperate enough to beg shamelessly.Please, Gideonlet me comeI need to come, please.Shh, angelIll take care of you.He finished me with a tenderness that made the orgasm roll through me like a crashing wave, building and swelling and spreading through me in a warm rush of pleasure.He threaded his fingers with mine when he came over me again, restraining my arms.The head of his cock aligned with the slick entrance of my body and he pushed inexorably into me.I moaned, shifting to accommodate the heavy surge of his penis.Gideons breath gusted hard and humid against my throat, his big frame trembling as he slid carefully inside me.Youre so soft and warm.Mine, Eva.Youre mine.I wrapped my legs around his hips, welcoming him deeper, feeling his buttocks flex and release against my calves as he demonstrated to my body that it would indeed take his thick length all the way to the root.With our hands linked, he took my mouth and began to move, gliding in and out with languid skill, the tempo precise and relentless yet smooth and easy.I felt every rock hard inch of him, felt the unmistakable reiteration that every inch of me was his to possess.He drove the message home repeatedly until I was gasping against his mouth, thrashing restlessly beneath him, my hands bloodless from the strength of my grip on his.He spoke heated praise and encouragement, telling me how beautiful I washow perfect I felt to himhow hed never stopcouldnt stop.I came with a sharp cry of relief, vibrating with the ecstasy of it, and he was right there with me.His pace quickened for several slamming thrusts; then he climaxed with a hiss of my name, spilling into me.I sank lax into the mattress, sweaty and boneless and replete.Im not done, he whispered darkly, adjusting his knees to increase the force of his thrusts.The pace remained expertly measured, each plunge staking a claim your body exists to serve me.Biting my lip, I fought back the sounds of helpless pleasure that mightve broken the tranquility of the nightand betrayed the frightening depths of emotion I was beginning to feel for Gideon Cross.
