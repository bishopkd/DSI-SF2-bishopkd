I bit my lip and nodded, ashamed.I had no idea what hed been through, and hearing him say the words made a sharp pain twist inside my chest.Im soso sorry.Youre forgiven, he said with a grin.Dont ever do it again.I wont.I promise.He flashed his dimple and shook his head.I fucking love you.The weeks passed, and it was a surprise to me how quickly Spring Break was upon us.The expected stream of gossip and stares had vanished, and life had returned to normal.The basements of Eastern U hadnt held a fight in weeks.Adam made a point of keeping a low profile after the arrests had lead to questions about what exactly had gone on that night, and Travis grew irritable waiting for a phone call to summon him to his last fight of the year; the fight that paid most of his bills for the summer, and well into the fall.The snow was still thick on the ground, and on the Friday before break, one last snowball fight broke out on the crystalline lawn.Travis and I weaved through the flying ice to the cafeteria, and I held tight to his arm, trying to avoid both the snowballs and falling to the ground.Theyre not going to hit you, Pidge.They know better, Travis said, holding his red, cold nose to my cheek.Their aim isnt synonymous with their fear of your temper, Trav.He held me against his side, rubbing my coat sleeve with his hand as he guided me through the chaos.We came to an abrupt halt when a handful of girls screamed past as they were pelted by the merciless aim of the baseball team.Once they cleared the path, Travis led me safely to the door.See?I told you wed make it, he said with a smile.His amusement faded when a tightly packed snowball exploded against the door, just between our faces.Travis glare scanned the lawn, but the sheer numbers of students darting in every direction doused his urge to retaliate.He pulled open the door, watching the melting snow slide down the painted metal to the ground.Lets get inside.Good idea, I nodded.He led me by the hand down the buffet line, piling different steaming dishes on one tray.The cashier had given up her predictable baffled expression weeks before, used to our routine.Abby.Brazil nodded to me and then winked at Travis.You guys have plans next week?Were staying here.My brothers are coming in, Travis said, distracted as he organized our lunches, dividing the small Styrofoam plates in front of us on the table.Im going to kill David Lapinski!America announced, shaking snow out of her hair as she approached.Direct hit!Shepley laughed.America shot him a warning glare and his laugh turned into a nervous chuckle.I meanwhat an asshole.We laughed at his regretful expression as he watched her stomp to the buffet line, following quickly after.Hes so whipped, Brazil said with a disgusted look on his face.Americas a little uptight, Travis explained.Shes meeting his parents this week.Brazil nodded, his eyebrows shooting up.So theyre.There, I said, nodding with him.Its permanent.Whoa, Brazil said.The shock didnt leave his face as he picked at his food, and I could see the confusion swirl around him.We were all young, and Brazil couldnt wrap his head around Shepleys commitment.When you have it, Brazilyoull get it, Travis said, smiling at me.The room was abuzz with excitement, from both the spectacle outside and the quickly approaching last hours before break.As the seats filled, the steady stream of chatter grew to a loud echo, the volume rising as everyone began talking over the noise.By the time Shepley and America returned with their trays, they had made up.She happily sat in the empty seat next to me, prattling on about her impending meet the parents moment.They would leave that evening for his parents, the perfect excuse for one of Americas infamous meltdowns.I watched her pick at her bread as she fretted about what to pack and how much luggage she could take without appearing pretentious, but she seemed to be holding it together.I told you, Baby.Theyre gonna love you.Love you like I love you, love you, Shepley said, tucking her hair behind her ear.America took a breath and the corners of her mouth turned up in the way they always did when he made her feel more at ease.Travis phone shivered, causing it to glide a few inches across the table.He ignored it, regaling Brazil with our first game of poker with his brothers.I glanced at the display, tapping Travis on the shoulder when I read the name.Baby?Without apology, he turned away from Brazil and gave me his undivided attention.Yeah, Pigeon?You might want to get that.He looked down at his cell phone and sighed, Or not.It could be important.He pursed his lips before holding the receiver to his ear.Whats up, Adam?His eyes searched the room as he listened, nodding occasionally.This is my last fight, Adam.Im not sure, yet.I wont go without her and Sheps leaving town.I knowI heard you.Hmmmthats not a bad idea, actually.My eyebrows pulled in, seeing his eyes brighten with whatever idea Adam had enlightened him with.When Travis hung up the phone, I stared at him expectantly.Its enough to pay rent for the next eight months.Adam got John Savage.Hes trying to go pro.I havent seen him fight, have you?Shepley asked, leaning forward.Travis nodded.Just once in Springfield.Hes good.Not good enough, I said.Travis leaned in and kissed my forehead with soft appreciation.I can stay home, Trav.No, he said, shaking his head.I dont want you to get hit like you did last time because youre worried about me.No, Pidge.Ill wait up for you, I smiled, trying to seem happier with the idea than I felt.Im going to ask Trent to come.Hes the only one Id trust so I can concentrate on the fight.Thanks a lot, asshole, Shepley grumbled.Hey, you had your chance, Travis said, only half teasing.Shepleys mouth pulled to the side with chagrin.He still felt at fault for the night at Hellerton.He apologized to me daily for weeks, but his guilt finally became manageable enough for him to suffer in silence.America and I tried to convince him that he wasnt to blame, but Travis would always hold him accountable.Shepley, it wasnt your fault.You pulled him off of me, remember?I said, reaching around America to pat his arm.I turned to Travis, When is the fight?Next week sometime, he shrugged.I want you there.I need you there.I smiled, resting my chin on his shoulder.Then Ill be there.Travis walked me to class, his grip tensing a few times when my feet slipped on the ice.You should be more careful, he teased.Im doing it on purpose.Youre such a sucker.If you want my arms around you, all you have to do is ask, he said, pulling me into his chest.We were oblivious to the students passing and the snowballs flying overhead as he pressed his lips against mine.My feet left the ground and he continued to kiss me, carrying me with ease across campus.When he finally set me on my feet in front of the door of my classroom, he shook his head.When we make our schedules for next semester, it would be more convenient if we had more classes together.Ill work on that, I said, giving him one last kiss before making my way to my seat.I looked up, and Travis gave me one last smile before making his way to his class in the next building.The students around me were as used to our shameless displays of affection as his class was used to him being a few minutes late.I was surprised that the time ticked by so quickly.I turned in my last test of the day and made my way to Morgan Hall.Kara was sitting in her usual spot on the bed, reading, as I rifled through my drawers for a few needed items.You going out of town?Kara asked.No, I just needed a few things.Im headed over to the Science building to pick up Trav, and then Ill be at the apartment all week.I figured, she said, keeping her eyes on the pages of her book.Have a good break, Kara.Mmmhmm.The campus was nearly empty, with only a few stragglers left.When I turned the corner, I saw Travis standing outside, finishing a cigarette.He wore a knit cap over his shaved head and one hand was shoved in the pocket of his worn, dark brown leather jacket.Smoke drifted from his nostrils as he looked down to the ground, deep in thought.It wasnt until I was just a few feet from him that I noticed how distracted he was.Whats on your mind, Baby?I asked.He didnt look up.Travis?His lashes fluttered when my voice registered and the troubled expression was replaced with a contrived smile.Hey, Pigeon.Everything okay?It is now, he said, pulling me against him.Okay.Whats up?I said with a raised eyebrow and a frown, making a show of my skepticism.Just have a lot on my mind, he sighed.When I waited expectantly, he continued.This week, the fight, you being there.I told you I would stay home.I need you there, Pidge, he said, flicking his cigarette to the ground.He watched it disappear into a deep footprint in the snow and then cupped his hand around mine, pulling me toward the parking lot.Have you talked to Trent?I asked.He shook his head.Im waiting for him to call me back.America rolled down the window and poked her head out of Shepleys Charger.Hurry up!Its freaking freezing!Travis smiled and picked up the pace, opening the door for me to slide in.Shepley and America repeated the same conversation theyd had since she learned she would be meeting his parents while I watched Travis stare out of the window.Just as we pulled into the parking lot of the apartment, Travis phone rang.What the fuck, Trent?he answered.I called you four hours ago, its not like youre productive at work or anything.Whatever.Listen, I need a favor.Ive got a fight next week.I need you to go.I dont know when it is, but when I call you, I need you there within an hour.Can you do that for me?Can you do it or not, douche bag?Because I need you to keep an eye on Pigeon.Some asshole put his hands on her last time andyeah.His voice lowered to a frightening tone.I took care of it.So if I call?Thanks, Trent.Travis clicked his phone shut and leaned his head against the back of the seat.Relieved?Shepley asked, watching Travis in the rearview mirror.Yeah.I wasnt sure how I was going to do it without him there.I told you, I began.Pidge, how many times do I have to say it?he frowned.I shook my head at his impatient tone.I dont understand it, though.You didnt need me there before.His fingers lightly grazed my cheek.I didnt know you before.When youre not there, I cant concentrate.Im wondering where you are, what youre doingif youre there and I can see you, I can focus.I know its crazy, but thats how it is.And crazy is exactly the way I like it, I smiled, leaning up to kiss his lips.Obviously, America muttered under breath.In the shadows of Keaton Hall, Travis held me tight against his side.The steam from my breath entangled with his in the cold night air, and I could hear the low conversations of those filtering in a side door a few feet away, oblivious to our presence.Keaton was the oldest building at Eastern, and although The Circle had been held there before, I was uneasy about the venue.Adam expected a full house, and Keaton wasnt the most spacious of basements on campus.Beams formed a grid along the aging brick walls, just one sign of the renovations taking place inside.This is one of the worst ideas Adam has had yet, Travis grumbled.Its too late to change it, now, I said, looking up at the scaffolds.Travis cell phone lit up and he popped it open.His face was tinged with blue against the display, and I could finally see the two worry lines between his eyebrows I already knew were there.He clicked buttons and then snapped the phone shut, gripping me tighter.You seem nervous tonight, I whispered.Ill feel better when Trent gets his punk ass here.Im here, you whiny little girl, Trent said in a hushed voice.I could barely see his outline in the darkness, but his smile gleamed in the moonlight.How ya been, sis?he said.He hugged me with one arm, and then playfully shoved Travis with the other.Im good, Trent.Travis immediately relaxed, and then he led me by the hand to the back of the building.If the cops show and we get separated, meet me at Morgan Hall, okay?Travis said to his brother.We stopped at an open window low to the ground, the signal that Adam was inside and waiting.Youre fuckin with me, Trent said, staring down at the window.Abbys barely gonna fit through there.Youll fit, Travis assured him, crawling down into the blackness inside.Like so many times before, I leaned down and pushed myself backwards, knowing Travis would catch me.We waited for a few moments, and then Trent grunted as he pushed off the ledge and landed on the floor, nearly losing his balance as his feet hit the concrete.Youre lucky I love Abby.I wouldnt do this shit for just anyone, Trent grumbled, brushing off his shirt.Travis jumped up, pulling the window closed with one quick movement.This way, he said, leading us through the dark.Hallway after hallway, I gripped Travis hand in mine, feeling Trent pinching the fabric of my shirt.I could hear small pieces of gravel scrape the concrete and I shuffled along the floor.I felt my eyes widen, trying to adjust to the blackness of the basement, but there was no light to help them focus.Trent sighed after the third turn.Were never gonna find our way out of here.Just follow me out.Itll be fine, Travis said, irritated with Trents complaining.When the hallway grew lighter, I knew we were close.When the low roar of the crowd came to a feverish pitch of numbers and names, I knew we had arrived.The room where Travis waited to be called usually had only one lantern and one chair, but with the renovations, it was full of desks and chairs and random equipment covered in white sheets.Travis and Trent discussed strategy for the fight as I peeked outside.It was as packed and chaotic as the last fight, but with less room.Furniture covered in dusty sheets lined the edges of the walls, pushed aside to make room for the spectators.The room was darker than usual, and I guessed that Adam wanted to be careful not to draw attention to our whereabouts.Lanterns hung from the ceilings, creating a dingy glow on the cash being held high as bets were still being called.Pigeon, did you hear me?Travis said, touching my arm.What?I said, blinking.I want you to stand by this doorway, okay?Keep hold of Trents arm at all times.I wont move.I promise.Travis smiled, his perfect dimple sinking into his cheek.Now you look nervous.I glanced to the doorway and then back to him.I dont have a good feeling about this, Trav.Not about the fight, butsomething.This place gives me the creeps.We wont be here long, Travis assured me.Adams voice came over the horn, and then a pair of warm, familiar hands were on each side of my face.I love you, he said, as he lifted me off the floor, squeezing me to him as he kissed me.He lowered me to the ground and hooked my arm around Trent.Dont take your eyes off of her, he said to his brother.Even for a second, this placell get crazy once the fight starts.so lets welcome tonights contenderJOHN SAVAGE!Ill guard her with my life, little brother, Trent said, tugging on my arm.Now go kick this guys ass and lets get out of here.TRAVIS MAD DOG MADDOX!Adam yelled through the horn.The volume was deafening as Travis made his way through the crowd.I looked up to Trent, who had the tiniest crook of a smile on his face.Anyone else might not have noticed, but I could see the pride in his eyes.When Travis reached the center of The Circle, I swallowed.John wasnt much bigger, but he looked different than anyone Travis had fought before, including the man he fought in Vegas.He wasnt trying to intimidate Travis with a severe stare like the others; he was studying him, preparing the fight in his mind.As analytical as his eyes were, they were also absence of reason.I knew before the fight began that Travis had more than a fight on his hands, he was standing in front of a demon.Travis seemed to notice the difference as well.His usual smirk was gone, in its place an intense stare.When the horn sounded, John attacked.Jesus, I said, gripping Trents arm.Trent moved as Travis did, as if they were one.I tensed with each swing John threw, fighting the urge to shut my eyes.There were no wasted movements; John was cunning and precise.All of Travis other fights seemed sloppy in comparison.The raw strength behind the punches alone were awe inspiring, as if the whole thing had been choreographed and practiced to perfection.The air in the room was heavy and stagnate; the dust from the sheets had been disturbed and caught in my throat each time I gasped.The longer the fight lasted, the worse the ominous feeling became.I couldnt shake it, and yet I forced myself to stay in place so Travis could concentrate.In one moment, I was hypnotized by the spectacle in the middle of the basemenet, in the next, I was shoved from behind.My head jerked back with the blow, but I tightened my grip, refusing to budge from my promised spot.Trent turned and grabbed the shirts of two men behind us and tossed them to the ground as though they were rag dolls.Back the fuck up or Ill kill you!he yelled to those staring at the fallen men.I gripped his arm tighter and he patted my hand.I got ya, Abby.Just watch the fight.Travis was doing well, and I sighed when he drew first blood.The crowd grew louder, but Trents warning kept those around us at a safe distance.Travis landed a solid punch and then glanced at me, quickly returning his attention to John.His movements were lithe, almost calculating, seeming to predict Johns attacks before he made them.Noticeably impatient, John wrapped his arms around Travis, pulling him to the ground.As one unit, the crowd surrounding the make shift ring tightened around them, leaning in as the action fell to the floor.I cant see him, Trent!I cried as I bounced on my tip toes.Trent looked around, finding Adams wooden chair.In a dance like motion, he passed me from one arm to the other, helping me as I climbed above the mob.Can you see him?Yeah!I said, holding Trents arm for balance.Hes on top, but Johns legs are around his neck!Trent leaned forward on his toes, cupping his free hand around his mouth, SLAM HIS ASS, TRAVIS!I glanced down to Trent and then leaned forward to get a better look at the men on the floor.Suddenly Travis was on his feet, John holding tight around Travis neck with his legs.Travis fell on his knees, slamming Johns back and head against the concrete in a devastating blow.Johns legs went limp, releasing Travis neck, and then Travis reared back is elbow, pummeling John over and over with his clenched fist until Adam pulled him away, throwing the red square on Johns flaccid body.The room erupted, cheering as Adam lifted Travis hand into the air.Trent hugged my legs, calling out victory to his brother.Travis looked up at me with a broad, bloody smile; his right eye had already begun to swell.As the money passed hands and the crowd began to meander about, preparing to leave, my eyes drifted to a wildly flickering lantern swaying back and forth in the corner of the room behind Travis.Liquid was dripping from its base, soaking the sheet below it.My stomach sank.Trent?Catching his attention, I pointed to the corner.In that moment, the lantern fell from its clip, crashing into the sheet below, immediately bursting into flames.Holy shit!Trent said, gripping my legs.A few men around the fire jumped back, watching in awe as the flames crawled to the adjacent sheet.Black smoke bellowed from the corner, and in unison, every person in the room flew into a panic, pushing their way to the exits.My eyes met Travis, and a look of terror distorted his face.Abby!he screamed, pushing at the sea of people between us.Cmon!Trent yelled, pulling me from the chair to his side.The room darkened, and a loud popping noise sounded from another side of the room.The other lanterns were igniting and adding to the fire in small explosions.Trent grabbed my arm, pulling me behind him as he tried to force his way through the crowd.We cant get out that way!Well have to go back the way we came!I cried, resisting.Trent looked around, forming a plan of escape in the center of the confusion.I looked to Travis again, watching as he tried to make his way across the room.As the crowd surged, Travis was pressed farther and farther away.The excited cheering from before was now horrified shrieks of fear and desperation as everyone fought to reach the exits.Trent pulled me to the doorway, and I looked back.Travis!I yelled, reaching out for him.He was coughing, waving the smoke away.This way, Trav!Trent called to him.Just get her out of here, Trent!Get Pigeon out!he said, coughing.Conflicted, Trent looked down to me.I could see the fear in his eyes.I dont know the way out.I looked to Travis once more, his form flickering behind the flames that had spread between us.Travis!Just go!Ill catch up to you outside!His voice was drowned out by the chaos around us, and I gripped Trents sleeve.This way, Trent!I said, feeling the tears and smoke burn my eyes.Dozens of panicked people were between Travis and his only escape.I tugged on Trents hand, shoving anyone in my path.We reached the doorway, and then I looked back and forth.Two dark hallways were dimly lit by the fire behind us.This way!I said, pulling on his hand again.You sure?Trent asked, his voice thick with doubt and fear.Cmon!I said, tugging on him again.The farther we ran, the darker the rooms became.After a few moments, my breaths were easier as we left the smoke behind, but the screams didnt subside, louder and more frantic than before.The horrific sounds behind us fueled my determination, keeping my steps quick and purposeful.By the second turn, we were walking blindly through the darkness.I held my hand in front of me, feeling along the wall with my free hand, gripping Trents hand with the other.Do you think he got out?Trent asked.His question undermined my focus, and I tried to push the answer from my mind.Keep moving, I choked out.Trent resisted for a moment, but when I tugged on him again, a light flickered.He held up a lighter, squinting into the small space for the way out.I followed the light as he waved it around the room, and gasped when a doorway came into view.This way!I said, tugging on him again.As I rushed through to the next room, a wall of people crashed into me, throwing me to the ground.Three women and two men, all with dirty faces and wide, frightened eyes looked down at me.One of the boys reached down to help me up.Theres some windows down here we can get out of!he said.We just came from that way, theres nothing down there, I said, shaking my head.You must have missed it.I know theyre this way!Trent tugged on my hand.Cmon, Abby, they know the way out!I shook my head.We came in this way with Travis.I know it.He tightened his grip.I told Travis I wouldnt let you out of my sight.Were going with them.Trent, weve been down that waythere were no windows!Lets go, Jason!a girl cried.Were going, Jason said, looking to Trent.Trent tugged on my hand again and I pulled away.Trent, please!Its this way, I promise!Im going with them, he said, Please come with me.I shook my head, tears flowing down my cheeks.Ive been here before.Thats not the way out!Youre coming with me!he yelled, pulling on my arm.Trent, stop!Were going the wrong way!I cried.My feet slid across the concrete as he pulled me along, and when the smell of smoke grew stronger, I yanked away, running in the opposite direction.ABBY!ABBY!Trent called.I kept running, holding my hands out in front of me, anticipating a wall.Come on!Shes gonna get you killed!a girl said.My shoulder crashed into a corner and I spun around, falling to the ground.I crawled along the floor, holding my trembling hand in front of me.When my fingers touched sheet rock, I followed it up, rising to my feet.The corner of a doorway materialized under my touch and I followed it into the next room.The darkness was endless, but I willed away the panic, carefully keeping my footsteps straight, reaching out for the next wall.Several minutes passed by, and I felt the fear well up inside me as the wails from behind rung in my ears.Please, I whispered in the blackness, let this be the way out.I felt another corner of a doorway, and when I made my way through, a silver stream of light glowed before me.Moonlight filtered through the glass of the window, and a sob forced its way from my throat.T TRENT!Its here!I called behind me.TRENT!I squinted my eyes, seeing a tiny bit of movement in the distance.Trent?I called out, my heart beat fluttering wildly in my chest.Within moments, shadows danced against the walls, and my eyes widened with horror when I realized what I thought were people, was actually the flickering light of flames.Oh my God, I said, looking up at the window.Travis had closed it behind us, and it was too high for me to reach.I looked around for something to stand on.The room was lined with wooden furniture covered in white sheets.The same sheets that would feed the fire until the room turned into an inferno.I grabbed a piece of white cloth, yanking it from a desk.Dust clouded around me as threw the sheet to the ground and lugged the bulky wood across the room to the space beneath the window.I shoved it next to the wall and climbed up, coughing with the smoke that was slowly seeping into the room.The window was still a few feet above me.I grunted as I tried to shove it open, clumsily twisting the lock back and forth between each push.It wouldnt budge.Come on, dammit!I yelled, leaning into my arms.I leaned back, using my body weight with the little momentum I could manage to force it open.When that didnt work, I slid my nails under the edges, pulling until I thought my nails had pulled away from the skin.Light flashed from the corner of my eye, and I cried out when I saw the fire barreling down the white sheets lining the hallway I had traveled just moments before.I looked up at the window, once again digging my nails into the edges.Blood dripped from my fingertips, the metal edges sinking into my flesh.Instinct overcame all other senses, and my hands balled into fists, ramming into the glass.A small crack splintered across the pane, along with my blood smearing and spattering with each blow.I hammered the glass once more with my fist, and then pulled off my shoe, slamming it with full force.Sirens wailed in the distance and I sobbed, beating my palms against the window.The rest of my life was just a few inches away, on the other side of the glass.I clawed at the edges once more, and then began slapping the glass with both palms.HELP ME!I screamed, seeing the flames draw nearer.SOMEBODY HELP ME!A faint cough sputtered behind me.Pigeon?I flipped around to the familiar voice.Travis appeared in a doorway behind me, his face and clothes covered in soot.TRAVIS!I cried.I scrambled off the desk and ran across the floor to where he stood, exhausted and filthy.I slammed into him, and he wrapped his arms around me, coughing as he gasped for air.His hands grabbed my cheeks.Wheres Trent?he said, his voice raspy and weak.He followed them!I bawled, tears streaming down my face.I tried to get him to come with me, but he wouldnt come!Travis looked down at the approaching fire and his eyebrows pulled in.I sucked in a breath, coughing when smoke filled my lungs.He looked down at me, his eyes filling with tears.Im gonna get us outta here, Pidge.His lips pressed against mine in one quick, firm movement, and then he climbed on top of my make shift ladder.He pushed at the window, and then twisted the lock, the muscles of his arms quivering as he used all of his strength against the glass.Get back, Abby!Im gonna break the glass!Afraid to move, I could only manage one step away from our only way out.Travis elbow bent as he reared back his fist, yelling as he rammed it into the window.I turned away, shielding my face with my bloody hands as the glass shattered above me.Come on!he yelled, holding his hand out to me.The heat from the fire took over the room, and I soared into the air as he lifted me from the ground and pushed me outside.I waited on my knees as Travis climbed out, and then helped him to his feet.The sirens were blaring from the other side of the building, and red and blue lights from fire engines and police cruisers danced across the brick on the adjacent buildings.We ran to the crowd of people standing in front of the building, scanning the dirty faces for Trent.Travis yelled his brothers name, his voice becoming more and more hopeless with each call.He pulled out his cell phone to check for a missed call and then slammed it shut, covering his mouth with his blackened hand.TRENT!Travis screamed, stretching his neck as he searched the crowd.Those that had escaped were hugging and whimpering behind the emergency vehicles, watching in horror as the pumper truck shot water through the windows and firefighters ran inside, pulling hoses behind them.Travis ran his hand over the stubble on his scalp, shaking his head.He didnt get out, he whispered.He didnt get out, Pidge.My breath caught as I watched the soot on his cheeks streak with his tears.He fell to his knees and I fell with him.Trents smart, Trav.He got out.He had to have found a different way, I said, trying to convince myself as well.Travis collapsed into my lap, gripping my shirt with both fists.I held him.I didnt know what else to do.An hour had passed.We watched with waning hope as the firefighters brought out two people, and then continuously came out empty handed.As the paramedics tended to the injured and ambulances tore into night with burn victims, we waited.Half an hour later, the bodies they were returning with were beyond saving.The ground was lined with casualties, far outnumbering those of us that had escaped.Travis eyes didnt leave the door, waiting for them to pull his brother from the ashes.Travis?We turned at the same time to see Adam standing beside us.Travis stood up, pulling me along with him.Im glad to see you guys made it out, Adam said, looking stunned and bewildered.Wheres Trent?Travis didnt answer.Our eyes returned to the charred remains of Keaton Hall, the thick black smoke still billowing from the windows.I buried my face into Travis chest, shutting my eyes tight, hoping at any moment I would wake up.I have to uhI have to call my dad, Travis said, his eyebrows pulling together as he opened his cell phone.I took a breath, hoping my voice would sound stronger than I felt.Maybe you should wait, Travis.We dont know anything, yet.His eyes didnt leave the number pad, and his lip quivered.This aint fucking right.He shoulda never been there.It was an accident, Travis.You couldnt have known something like this was going to happen, I said, touching his cheek.His face compressed, his eyes shutting tight.He took in a deep breath and began to dial his fathers number.The numbers on the screen were replaced with a name as the phone began to ring, and Travis eyes widened when he read the display.The phone was at his ear with a blurring movement.Trent?A surprised laugh escaped his lips, and a smile broke out on his face as he looked at me, Its Trent!I gasped and squeezed his arm as he spoke.Where are you?What do you mean youre at Morgan?Ill be there in a second, dont you fucking move!I surged forward, my feet struggling to keep up with Travis as he sprinted across the campus, dragging me behind him.When we reached Morgan, my lungs were screaming for air.Trent ran down the steps, crashing into both of us.Jesus H.  Christ, brother!I thought you were toast!Trent said, squeezing us so tightly I couldnt breathe.You ASSHOLE!Travis screamed, shoving his brother away.I thought you were fucking dead!Ive been waiting for the firefighters to carry your charred body from Keaton!Travis frowned at Trent for a moment, and then pulled him into a hug.His arm shot out, fumbling around until he felt my shirt, and then pulled me into a hug as well.After several moments, Travis released Trent, keeping me close beside him.Trent looked at me with an apologetic frown.Im sorry, Abby.I panicked.I shook my head.Im just glad youre okay.Me?I would have been better off dead if Travis had seen me come out of that building without you.I tried to find you after you ran off, but then I got lost and had to find another way.I walked along the building looking for that window, but I ran into some cops and they made me leave.Ive been flippin the fuck OUT over here!he said, running his hand over his short hair.Travis wiped my cheeks with his thumbs, and then pulled up his shirt, using it to wipe the soot from his face.Lets get out of here.The cops are going to be crawling all over the place soon.After hugging his brother once more, we walked to Americas Honda.Travis watched me buckle my seat belt and then frowned when I coughed.Maybe I should take you to the hospital.Get you checked out.Im fine, I said, interlacing my fingers in his.I looked down, seeing a deep cut across his knuckles.Is that from the fight or the window?The window, he answered, frowning at my bloodied nails.You saved my life, you know.His eyebrows pulled together.I wasnt leaving without you.I knew youd come, I smiled, squeezing his fingers between mine.We held hands until we arrived at the apartment.I couldnt tell whose blood was whose as I washed the crimson and ash from my skin in the shower.Falling into Travis bed, I could still smell the stench of smoke and smoldering skin.Here, he said, handing me a short glass filled with amber liquid, Itll help you relax.Im not tired.He held out the glass again.His eyes were exhausted, blood shot and heavy.Just try to get some rest, Pidge.Im almost afraid to close my eyes, I said, taking the glass and gulping the liquid down.He took the glass and set it on the night stand, sitting beside me.We sat in silence, letting the last hours sink in.I shut my eyes tight when the memories of the terrified cries of those trapped in the basement filled my mind.I wasnt sure how long it would take me to forget, or if I ever would.Travis warm hand on my knee pulled me from my conscious nightmare.A lot of people died tonight.I know.We wont find out until tomorrow just how many.Trent and I passed a group of kids on the way out.I wonder if they made it.They looked so scared.I felt the tears fill my eyes, but before they touched my cheeks, Travis solid arms were surrounding me.Immediately I felt protected, flush against his skin.Feeling so at home in his arms had once terrified me, but in that moment, I was grateful that I could feel so safe after experiencing something so horrific.There was only one reason I could ever feel that way with anyone.I belonged to him.It was then that I knew.Without a doubt in my mind, without worry of what others would think, and having no fear of mistakes or consequences, I smiled at the words I would say.Travis?I said against his chest.What, Baby?he whispered into my hair.Our phones rang in unison, and I handed his to him as I answered mine.Hello?ABBY?America shrieked.Im okay, Mare.Were all okay.We just heard!Its all over the news!I could hear Travis explaining to Shepley next to me, and I tried my best to reassure America.Fielding dozens of her questions, trying to keep my voice steady while recounting the scariest moments of my life, I relaxed the second Travis covered my hand with his.It seemed I was telling someone elses story, sitting in the comfort of Travis apartment, a million miles away from the nightmare that could have killed us.America wept when I finished, realizing how close we came to losing our lives.Im going to start packing now.Well be home first thing in the morning, America sniffed.Mare, dont leave early.Were fine.I have to see you.I have to hug you so Ill know youre all right, she cried.Were fine.You can hug me on Friday.She sniffed again.I love you.I love you, too.Have a good time.Travis looked at me and then pressed the phone tight against his ear, Better hug your girl, Shep.She sounds upset.I know manme too.See you soon.I hung up seconds before Travis did, and we sat in silence for a moment, still processing what had happened.After several moments, Travis leaned back against his pillow, and then pulled me against his chest.America all right?he asked, staring up at the ceiling.Shes upset.Shell be okay.Im glad they werent there.I clenched my teeth.I hadnt even thought about what might have happened had they not stayed with Shepleys parents.My mind flashed to the terrified expressions of the girls in the basement, fighting against the men to escape.Americas frightened eyes replaced the nameless girls in that room.I felt nauseous thinking about her beautiful blonde hair soiled and singed along with the rest of the bodies laid out on the lawn.Me too, I said with a shiver.Im sorry.Youve been through a lot tonight.I dont need to add anything else to your plate.You were there, too, Trav.He was quiet for several moments, and just when I opened my mouth to speak again, he took a deep breath.I dont get scared very often, he said finally.I was scared the first morning I woke up and you werent here.I was scared when you left me after Vegas.I was scared when I thought I was going to have to tell my dad that Trent had died in that building.But when I saw you across the flames in that basementI was terrified.I made it to the door, was a few feet from the exit, and I couldnt leave.What do you mean?Are you crazy?I said, my head jerking up to look into his eyes.Ive never been so clear about anything in my life.I turned around, made my way to that room you were in, and there you were.Nothing else mattered.I didnt even know if we would make it out or not, I just wanted to be where you were, whatever that meant.The only thing Im afraid of is a life without you, Pigeon.I leaned up, kissing his lips tenderly.When our mouths parted, I smiled.Then you have nothing to be afraid of.Were forever.He sighed.Id do it all over again, you know.I wouldnt trade one second if it meant we were right here, in this moment.My eyes felt heavy, and I took in a deep breath.My lungs protested, still burning from the smoke.I coughed a bit, and then relaxed, feeling Travis warm lips against my forehead.His hand glided over my damp hair, and I could hear his heart beating steady in his chest.This is it, he said with a sigh.What?The moment.When I watch you sleepingthat peace on your face?This is it.I havent had it since before my mom died, but I can feel it again.He took another deep breath and pulled me closer.I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed.Turns out it wasnt something about you at all.It was just you.The corner of my mouth turned up as I buried my face into his chest.Its us, Trav.Nothing makes sense unless were together.Have you noticed that?Noticed?Ive been telling you that all year!he teased.Its official.Bimbos, fights, leaving, Parker, Vegaseven firesour relationship can withstand anything.I lifted my head up once more, noticing the contentment in his eyes as he looked at me.It was similar to the peace I had seen on his face after I lost the bet to stay with him in the apartment, after I told him I loved him for the first time, and the morning after the Valentines dance.It was similar, but different.This was absolute  permanent.The cautious hope had vanished from his eyes, unqualified trust taking its place.I recognized it only because his eyes mirrored what I was feeling.Vegas?I asked.His brow furrowed, unsure of where I was headed.Yeah?Have you thought about going back?His eyebrows shot up.I dont think thats a good idea for me.What if we just went for a night?He looked around the dark room, confused.A night?Marry me, I said without hesitation.I was surprised at how quickly and easily the words came.His mouth spread into a broad smile.When?I shrugged.We can book a flight tomorrow.Its Spring Break.I dont have anything going on tomorrow, do you?Im callin your bluff, he said, reaching for his phone.American Airlines, he said, watching my reaction closely as he was connected.I need two tickets to Vegas, please.Tomorrow.Hmmmm, he looked at me, waiting for me to change my mind.Two days, round trip.Whatever you have.I rested my chin on his chest, waiting for him to book the tickets.The longer I let him stay on the phone, the wider his smile became.Yeahuh, hold on a minute, he said, pointing to his wallet.Grab my card, would ya, Pidge?He waited again for my reaction.I happily leaned over, pulled his credit card from his wallet and handed it to him.Travis called out the numbers to the agent, glancing up at me after each set.When he gave the expiration date and saw my lack of protesting, he pressed his lips together.Er, yes mam.Well just pick them up at the desk.Thank you.He handed me his phone and I sat it on the night table, waiting for him to speak.You just asked me to marry you, he said, still waiting for me to admit some kind of trickery.I know.That was the real deal, you know.I just booked two tickets to Vegas for noon tomorrow.So that means were getting married tomorrow night.Thank you.His eyes narrowed.Youre going to be Mrs.Maddox when you start classes on Monday.Oh, I said, looking around.Travis raised an eyebrow.Second thoughts?Im going to have some serious paperwork to change next week.He nodded slowly, cautiously hopeful.Youre going to marry me tomorrow?I smiled.Uh huh.Youre serious?Yep.I fucking love you!He grabbed each side of my face, slamming his lips against mine.I love you so much, Pigeon, he said, kissing me over and over.Just remember that in fifty years when Im still kicking your ass in poker, I giggled.He smiled, triumphant.If it means sixty or seventy years with you, Babyyou have my full permission to do your worst.I raised one eyebrow, Youre gonna regret that.You wanna bet?I smiled with as much deviance as I could muster.Are you confident enough to bet that shiny bike outside?He shook his head, a serious expression replacing the teasing smile he had just seconds before.Ill put in everything I have.I dont regret a single second with you, Pidge, and I never will.I held out my hand and he took it without hesitation, shaking it once, and then bringing it to his mouth, pressing his lips tenderly against my knuckles.The room was quiet, his lips leaving my skin and the air escaping his lungs the only sound.Abby Maddox, he said, his smile beaming in the moonlight.I pressed my cheek against his bare chest.Travis and Abby Maddox.Has a nice ring to it.Ring?he said, frowning.Well worry about rings later, Baby.I sort of sprung this on you.Uh, he trailed off, watching me for the reaction he expected.What?I asked, feeling myself tense.Dont freak out, he said as he shifted nervously.His grip around me tightened.I kind ofalready took care of that part.What part?I said, my head craning to see his face.He stared up at the ceiling and sighed.Youre going to freak out.Travis.I frowned as he pulled one arm away from me, reaching for the drawer of his night stand.He felt around for a moment and I blew my damp bangs from my eyes.What?You bought condoms?He laughed once, No, Baby.His eyebrows pulled together as he made more of an effort, reaching farther into the drawer.Once he found what he was looking for, his focus changed, and he watched me as he pulled a small box from its hiding place.I looked down as he placed the small velvet square on his chest, reaching behind him to rest his head on his arm.Whats that?I asked.What does it look like?Okay.Let me rephrase the question.when did you get that?Travis inhaled, and as he did, the box rose with his chest, and fell when he pushed the air from his lungs.A while ago.Trav,  I just happened to see it one dayand I knew there was only one place it could belongon your perfect little finger.One day when?Does it matter?he rebutted.He squirmed a bit, and I couldnt help but laugh.Can I see it?I smiled, suddenly feeling a bit giddy.His smile matched mine, and he looked to the box.Open it.I touched it with one finger, feeling the lush velvet under my fingertip.I grasped the golden seal with both hands, slowly pulling the lid open.A glimmer caught my eye and I slammed the lid shut.TRAVIS!I wailed.I knew youd freak out!he said, sitting up and cupping his hands over mine.I could feel the box pressing against both of my palms, feeling like a prickly grenade that could detonate at any moment.I closed my eyes and shook my head.Are you insane?I know.I know what youre thinking, but I had to.It was The One.And I was right!I havent seen one since that was as perfect as this one!My eyes popped open and instead of the anxious pair of brown eyes I expected, he was beaming with pride.He gently peeled my hands from the case and pulled the lid open, pulling the ring from the tiny slit that held it in place.The large round diamond glittered even in the dim light, catching the moonlight in every facet.Its.my God, its amazing, I whispered as he took my left hand in his.Can I put it on your finger?he asked, peering up at me.When I nodded, he pressed his lips together, sliding the silver band over my knuckle, holding it in place for a moment before letting go.Now its amazing.We both stared at my hand for a moment, equally shocked at the contrast of the large diamond sitting atop my small, slender finger.The band spanned the bottom of my finger, splitting in two on each side as it reached the solitaire, smaller diamonds lining each sliver of white gold.You could have put a down payment on a car for this, I said under my breath, unable to put any strength behind my voice.My eyes followed my hand as Travis brought it up to his lips.Ive imagined what this would look like on your hand a million times.Now that its there.What?I smiled, watching him stare at my hand with an emotional grin.He looked up at me.I thought I was going to have to sweat five years before Id feel like this.I wanted it as much as you did.Ive just got a hell of a poker face, I smiled, pressing my lips against his.EPILOGUE  Travis squeezed my hand as I held my breath.I tried to keep my face smooth, but when I cringed, his grip became tighter.The white ceiling was tarnished in some places by leak stains.Other than that, the room was immaculate.No clutter, no utensils strewn about.Everything had its place, which made me feel moderately at ease about the situation.I had made the decision.I would go through with it.Baby, Travis said, frowning.I can do this, I said, staring at spots in the ceiling.I jumped when fingertips touched my skin, but I tried not to tense.I could see the worry in Travis eyes when the buzzing began.Pigeon, Travis began again, but I shook my head dismissively.All right.Im ready.I held the phone away from my ear, wincing from both the pain and the inevitable lecture.Im going to kill you, Abby Abernathy!America cried.Kill you!Technically, its Abby Maddox, now, I said, smiling at my new husband.Its not fair!she whined, the anger subsiding from her tone.I was supposed to be your maid of honor!I was supposed to go dress shopping with you and throw a bachelorette party and hold your bouquet!I know, I said, watching Travis smile fade as I winced again.You dont have to do this, you know, he said, his eyebrows pulling together.I squeezed his fingers together with my free hand.I know.You said that already!America snapped.I wasnt talking to you.Oh, youre talking to me, she fumed.You are sooo talking to me.You are never going to hear the end of this, do you hear me?I will never, ever forgive you!Yes you will.You!Youre a!Youre just plain mean, Abby!Youre a horrible best friend!I laughed, causing the man seated beside me to jerk.Hold still, Mrs.Maddox.Im sorry, I said.Who was that?America snapped.That was Griffin.Who the hell is Griffin?Let me guess, you invited a total stranger to your wedding and not your best friend?Her voice became shriller with each question.No.He didnt go to the wedding, I said, sucking in a breath of air.Travis sighed and shifted nervously in his chair, squeezing my hand.Im supposed to do that to you, remember?I said, smiling up at him through the pain.Sorry.I dont think I can take this, he said, his voice thick with distress.He relaxed his hand, looking down to Griffin.Hurry up, would ya?Griffin shook his head.Covered in tats and cant take your girlfriend getting a simple script.Ill be finished in a minute, Mate.Travis frown deepened.Wife.Shes my wife.America gasped once the conversation processed in her mind.Youre getting a tattoo?What is going on with you, Abby?Did you breathe toxic fumes in that fire?I looked down at my stomach, to the smeared black mess just to the inside of my hip bone and smiled.Trav has my name on his wrist, I sucked in another breath when the buzzing continued.Griffin wiped ink from my skin and began again.I spoke through my teeth, Were married.I wanted something, too.Travis shook his head.You didnt have to.I narrowed my eyes.Dont start with me.We discussed this.America laughed once.Youve gone crazy.Im admitting you to the asylum when you get home.Her voice was still piercing and exasperated.Its not that crazy.We love each other.We have been practically living together on and off all year.Why not?Because youre nineteen, you idiot!Because you ran off and didnt tell anyone, and because Im not there!she cried.Im sorry, Mare, I have to go.Ill see you tomorrow, okay?I dont know if I want to see you tomorrow!I dont think I want to see Travis ever again!she sneered.Ill see you tomorrow, Mare.You know you want to see my ring.And your tat, she said, a smile in her voice.I clicked the phone shut, handing it to Travis.The buzzing resumed again, and my attention focused on the burning sensation followed by the sweet second of relief as he wiped the excess ink away.Travis shoved my phone in his pocket, gripping my hand with both of his, leaning down to touch his forehead to mine.Did you freak out this much when you got your tattoos?I asked him, smiling at the apprehensive expression on his face.He shifted, seeming to feel my pain a thousand times more than I.  Uhno.This is different.This is much, much worse.Done!Griffin said with as much relief in his voice as was on Travis face.I let my head fall back against the chair.Thank God!Thank God!Travis sighed, patting my hand.I looked down at the beautiful black lines on my red and angry skin:   Mrs.Maddox   Wow, I said, rising up on my elbows to get a better look.Travis frown instantly turned into a triumphant smile.Its beautiful.Griffin shook his head.If I had a dollar for every inked up new husband that brought his wife in here and took it worse than she didwell.I wouldnt have to tat anyone ever again.Just tell me how much I owe, smart ass, Travis mumbled.Ill have your bill at the counter, Griffin said, amused with Travis retort.I looked around the room at the shiny chrome and posters of sample tattoos on the wall, and then back down to my stomach.My new last name shined in thick, elegant black letters.Travis watched me with pride, and then peered down at his titanium wedding band.We did it, Baby, he said in a hushed voice.I still cant believe youre my wife.Believe it, I said, smiling.He helped me from the chair and I favored my right side, conscious of every movement I made that cause my jeans to rub against my raw skin.Travis pulled out his wallet, signing the receipt quickly before leading me by the hand to the cab waiting outside.My cell phone rang again, and when I saw that it was America, I let it ring.Shes going to lay the guilt trip on thick, isnt she?Travis said with a frown.Shell pout for twenty four hours after she sees the pictures, then shell get over it.Travis shot me a mischievous grin.Are you sure about that, Mrs.Maddox?Are you ever going to stop calling me that?Youve said it a hundred times since we left the chapel.He shook his head as he held the cab door open for me.Ill quit calling you that when it sinks in that this is real.Oh, its real all right, I said, sliding to the middle of the seat to make room.I have wedding night memories to prove it.He leaned against me, running his nose up the sensitive skin of my neck until he reached my ear.We sure do.Ow, I said when he pressed against my bandage.Oh, dammit, Im sorry, Pidge.Youre forgiven, I smiled.We rode to the airport hand in hand, and I giggled as I watched Travis stare at his wedding band without apology.His eyes held the peaceful expression I was becoming accustomed to.When we get back to the apartment, I think it will finally hit me, and Ill quit acting like such a jackass.Promise?I smiled.He kissed my hand and then cradled it in his lap between his palms.No.I laughed, resting my head on his shoulder until the cab slowed to a stop in front of the airport.My cell phone rang again, displaying Americas name once again.Shes relentless.Let me talk to her, Travis said, reaching for my phone.Hello?he said, waiting out the shrill stream on the other end of the line.He smiled, Because Im her husband.I can answer her phone, now.He glanced at me, and then shoved open the cab door, offering his hand.Were at the airport, America.Why dont you and Shep pick us up and you can yell at us both on the way home?Yes, the whole way home.We should arrive around three.All right, Mare.See you then.He winced with her sharp words and then handed me the phone.You werent kidding.Shes pissed.He tipped the cabby and then threw his bag over his shoulder, pulling up the handle to my rolling luggage.His tattooed arms tensed as he pulled my bag, his free hand reaching out to take mine.I cant believe you gave her the green light to let us have it for an entire hour, I said, following him through the revolving door.You dont really think Im going to let her yell at my wife, do you?Youre getting pretty comfortable with that term.I guess its time I admit it.I knew you were going to be my wife pretty much from the second I met you.Im not going to lie and say I havent been waiting for the day I could say itso Im going to abuse the title.You should get used to it, now.He said this all matter of factly, as if he were giving a practiced speech.I laughed, squeezing his hand.I dont mind.He peered at me from the corner of his eye.You dont?I shook my head and he pulled me to his side, kissing my cheek.Good.Youre going to get sick of it over the next few months, but just cut me some slack, okay?I followed him through the hallways, up escalators, and lines of security.When Travis walked through the metal detector, a loud buzzer went off.When the airport guard asked Travis to remove his ring, his face turned severe.Ill hold onto it, sir, the officer said.It will only be for a moment.I promised her Id never take it off, Travis said through his teeth.The officer held out his palm, patience and amused understanding wrinkling the thin skin around his eyes.Travis begrudgingly removed his ring, slammed it into the guards hand, and then sighed when he walked through the doorway, that time without setting off the alarm.I walked through without event, handing over my ring as well.Travis expression was still tense, but when we were allowed to pass, his shoulders relaxed.Its okay, Baby.Its back on your finger, I said, giggling at his overreaction.He kissed my forehead, pulling me to his side as we made our way to the terminal.When I caught the eyes of those we passed, I wondered if it was obvious that we were newlyweds, or if they simply noticed the ridiculous grin on Travis face, a stark contrast from his shaved head, inked arms and bulging muscles.The airport was abuzz with excited tourists, the beeping and ringing of slot machines in the air, and people meandering in every direction.I smiled at a young couple holding hands, looking as excited and nervous as Travis and I did when we arrived.I didnt doubt that they would leave feeling the same mixture of relief and bewilderment that we felt, accomplishing what we had come for.In the terminal, I thumbed through a magazine, and gently touched Travis wildly bouncing knee.His leg froze and I smiled, keeping my eyes on the pictures of celebrities.He was nervous about something, but I waited for him to tell me, knowing he was working it out internally.After a few minutes, his knee bobbed again, but this time he stopped it on his own, and then slowly slumped down into his chair.Pigeon?Yeah?A few moments passed, and then he sighed.Nothing.The time passed too quickly, and it seemed we had just sat down when our flight number was called to board.A line quickly formed, and we stood up, waiting our turn to show our tickets and walk down the long hall to the airplane that would take us home.Travis hesitated.I cant shake this feeling, he said under his breath.What do you mean?Like a bad feeling?I said, suddenly nervous.He turned to me with concern in his eyes, I have this crazy feeling that once we get home, Im going to wake up.Like none of this was real.I slid my arms around his waist, running my hands up the lean muscles of his back.Is that what youre worried about?He looked down to his wrist, and then glanced to the thick silver band on his left finger.I just cant shake the feeling that the bubbles going to burst, and Im going to be lying in my bed alone, wishing you were there with me.I dont know what Im going to do with you, Trav!Ive dumped someone for you  twice  Ive picked up and went to Vegas with you  twice  Ive literally gone through hell and back, married you and branded myself with your name.Im running out of ideas to prove to you that Im yours.A small smile graced his lips.I love it when you say that.That Im yours?I asked.I leaned up on the balls of my feet, pressing my lips against his.I.  Am.Yours.Mrs.Travis Maddox, forever and always.His small smile faded as he looked at the boarding gate and then down to me.Im gonna fuck it up, Pigeon.Youre gonna get sick of my shit.I laughed.Im sick of your shit, now.I still married you.I thought once we got married, that Id feel a little more reassured about losing you.But I feel like if I get on that plane.Travis?I love you.Lets go home.His eyebrows pulled in.You wont leave me, right?Even when Im a pain in the ass?I vowed in front of Godand Elvisthat I wouldnt, didnt I?His frown lightened a bit.This is forever?One corner of my mouth turned up.Would it make you feel better if we made a wager?Other passengers began to walk around us, however slowly, watching and listening to our ridiculous conversation.Like all the other times, I was glaringly aware of prying eyes, but this time was different.The only thing I could think about was the peace returning to Travis eyes.What kind of husband would I be if I bet against my own marriage?I smiled.The stupid kind.Didnt you listen to your dad when he told you not to bet against me?He raised an eyebrow.So youre that sure, huh?Youd bet on it?I wrapped my arms around his neck and smiled against his lips.Id bet my first born.Thats how sure I am.And then the peace returned.You cant be that sure, he said, the anxiousness absent from his voice.I raised an eyebrow, and my mouth pulled to one side.Wanna bet?
