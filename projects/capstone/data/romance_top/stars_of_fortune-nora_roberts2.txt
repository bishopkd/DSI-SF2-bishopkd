He scrubbed both hands over his face.Bad enough, isnt it, to wake when its barely past the middle of the bloody night, but then to have a woman shrieking on top of it.Im not shrieking.Those crystal blue eyes fired like flames.You want to hear shrieking?You will if you dont tell me what the hell youre doing in my bed.Relax, fidh, for it was nothing but sleeping on both parts.A pity, he thought, as she was fairly glorious when wound up.Dont tell me to relax.Why are you in my room, in my bed, instead of in your own?Well, Ill tell you if you stop shouting.By all the gods, is there no tea or coffee in the world at this moment?Im two seconds away from calling hotel security.After a frantic glance around, she grabbed one of her sandals, brandished it like a weapon.Explain.He angled his head, apparently unconcerned, lifted that scarred eyebrow.If you throw that at me, darling, Ill be very annoyed, I can promise you.He shoved out of bed, spotted her minibar, strode to it.He plucked out a Coke and, rolling his shoulders, had the lightning bolt tattoo on his left shoulder blade rippling.Ah well, you take what there is and be grateful.Opening the bottle, he guzzled it down.Thats something anyway.Get out.He turned around again, tall, leanly muscled, in nothing but the jeans hed hastily pulled on and hadnt bothered to button.Through her fury, lust clanged like iron bells.Are you wanting me to get out or to explain?I want you to explain, then get out.How did you get in here?I walked in, with you.She cocked the shoe back another inch as if prepared to pitch.You absolutely did not.I may dance around the truth here and there, but I dont make a habit of stomping on it.You were dream walking.You came knocking on my door.II dont walk in my sleep.But she heard the doubt in her own voice.Its not altogether sleep, is it?He sat on the side of the bed, drank more of the Coke, then held it out.Want a bit?No.Yes.Ill get my own.Halfway to the minibar, she realized she wore nothing but her chemise and detoured quickly to grab the hotel robe.A bit late for that now, dont you think, as Ive already taken in the view.And its a fine and appealing one.At her sharp look, he laughed.And if I were going to do something about that, I had plenty of opportunity in the night.He held up his free hand, palm out.Hands off, I swear to you.She shoved her arms in the robe.I dont remember.I can see that, and in your place Id hate it as much as you.It was an hour or so after wed parted ways for the night, you came knocking on my door.Not quite awake, not quite asleepyou understand what I mean.You said she was at the window.Who?I asked the same.She wanted to be let in, and you knew better.She promised you your hearts desire, and you knew better.You came for me.Fear crawled on sharp hands and knees up her spine.Did you ...Did you see anything?A shadow, nothing more than a shadow, and what sounded like the rustle of wings.I dont doubt there was something.He gave her a long, direct look.I dont doubt you.His last words brought tears to her eyes, so she turned away quickly, went to the minibar.Fighting the tears back, she found a small bottle of orange juice.You stayed with me.You were worried shed come back, and you were cold.Shed left you cold.So I tucked you up as I might a ...sister, and as I didnt fancy sleeping on the floor, I shared the bed.And here we are now.Im sorry.I shouldve known.I would have known if I hadnt jumped so fast.You jumped to logical enough conclusions.Maybe.Now she sat on the side of the bed.He took the bottle from her, opened it, handed it back.But she only stared down at it.Thank you for staying with me.Youre welcome.But he took the shoe she still held, set it on the floor.Just in case.And wished those sizzling sparks of outrage hadnt died away into weariness.Its just the beginning, isnt it?Shadows at the window.Theyre only the beginning.It began long ago.This is another step along the way.Youll do fine.You think so?I do, as Im the one who nearly got bashed in the head with a shoe.Youre not alone in this.He gave her a friendly pat on the leg before he pushed to his feet.What do you say we meet down for breakfast in an hour?All right.An hour.He reached down, tipped her face up.Remember.You didnt let her in.When she nodded, he walked to the door and out.And nearly into Riley.Her eyebrows rose, her lips curved as she tugged earbuds out of her ears.Quick work, Irish.Not of the matter youre thinking.Youre up and about early.Got a workout in.If you can slap yourself together in a half hour, Ill go down to breakfast with you, tell you what happened with Sasha.Shell be an hour, and that would save her from having to go over it all again.Now youve got me curious.Make it twenty minutes.Riley jogged to her door, stopped to look back.She okay?She is.Tougher than I thought, and certainly than she thinks of herself.Twenty minutes, he repeated.If youre not ready Ill meet you downstairs, as if I dont have coffee by then I may murder someone.Ill be ready.* * *  			She was as good as her word and rapped on his door closer to fifteen minutes than twenty.They went down, agreed to grab coffee, take it out by the pool so he could fill her in.First, just to get it out of the way, Ive gotta respect you didnt dive into the pooland I dont mean this one.Sex?He shook his head.A man whod take advantage of a dream walker doesnt have much respect for himself or the woman.Add in, if were in this together, we need some level of trust.Youre right there.And I trust youre not telling us everything about Bran Killian.Im not, Dr.Gwin.On a laugh, she toasted him with her coffee.Googled me?I did.Only fair.I did the same with you.That club of yoursor clubs, because youve got another in Dublinlooks pretty kick ass.I like to think so.Ill have to check it out, next time Im in New York or Dublin.But right now, we should probably get a table.Sasha strikes me as the timely type.Plus Im starving.Rising, they strolled toward the open air buffet with its billowing white curtains.You got any ideas on who was at her window last night?A few.Funny, I have a few, too.After telling the waiter theyd be three, they got a table, waited for the coffee refill.Riley took a notebook out of one of the pockets of her cargo pants, tore off a sheet.You write down your first choice, Ill do the same.And well compare.I dont have a pen on me.You can use my pencil in a minute.Riley scrawled a name on her sheet, tossed him the pencil.Is this to make certain Im not winding you up?Lets say itll show if either of us is full of shit.She held her sheet out to him between two fingers, and he did the same.Nerezza, he murmured.Riley set his sheet down beside her, nodding to Sasha as she walked to the table.Nerezza.Shes the mother of darkness.Sasha stared at the billowing white curtains.She is made of lies.Bran rose, took her arm, felt her shudder.Sasha.Yes.Sit down now.Will you have coffee?She slid into the chair, nodded.Yes.She picked up the two sheets of paper.I know this name.Ive heard it in my head.This was who came to the window.She was outside the window, a third floor window.It wasnt a dream, not really a dream.How can that be?Who is she?Its more what, Bran said, shifted his gaze back to Riley.Have you ever taken on a god before?Cant say I have.This should be fun.She stood up.Im hitting the buffet.Sasha watched Riley stride off to one of the loaded buffet tables, lift the lid on a chafing dish, and begin to pile on food.If I had a million dollars, Id give every cent of it to have her confidence.Youve got your own, Bran told her.Youve just tucked it away here and there.Wed best get some breakfast before Riley eats all there is.* * *  			Rileys jeep, a rough, rusted out red, was battered and battle scarred and roofless.After a long study, Bran climbed in the back.Where did you get this thing?I have contacts, worked a deal.Figured Id need transportation.She got behind the wheel, tossed a folded map at Sasha.Shotgun navigates.All right, but its helpful to know where were going.North along the coast to start.Its a big island, but my research leads me toward a coastal location.Why?Even as the question formed, Riley hit the gas.It might have looked like it hovered one step out of the nearest junkyard, but the jeep had enough kick to leap forward like a panther.Why?Riley shouted over the engines roar as she punched down a narrow road, the shops a blur at the edges, toward the coast.What makes an island an island?Sasha wondered if a crash hurt less if the eyes stayed closed.Its surrounded by water.So why choose an island to hide treasure if youre just going inland?The coastbays, inlets, caves.Most translations of the legend talk about the Fire Star waiting to light again, that it sleeps in the cradle of land beneath the sea.Some mythologists figure Atlantis.That follows, as Atlantis is a myth.Riley flicked Sasha a look.Youre here looking for a fallen star created by a moon goddess, but dissing Atlantis?And hoping I dont die in a car crash.Thats what the roll bars for.I have a colleague whos been searching for Atlantis for nearly twenty years now.Im leaving that one to him.The road was like a speedway where every driver seemed determined to cross his personal finish line before the rest.Riley drove like a maniacal demon, barely slowing when they zipped through a village.Kontokali, if youre checking the map, she said.Its got one of the oldest churches on the island, and a castle ruin Ill check out if I have spare time.How you doing back there, Irish?Hed angled sideways, propped his feet up on the second seat.You drive like a hellhound, Riley.I always get where Im going.Seeing as there are three of us now, I had a thought.We can each keep shelling out separately for a hotel room, or we could pool it, rent a place.Itd be cheaper all around.And more private, Bran added, as hed had the thought himself.It gets a bit awkward trying to discuss hunting for stars and evading dark gods in hotel restaurants.What do you think, Sasha?She stared out at the sea, and the skier flying along the blue behind a bright white boat.I guess its more practical.Done, Riley announced.Ill make some calls.To your contacts, Bran finished.Pays to have them.Gouvia, she added as they came to another village.Old Venetian shipyards.Multiple beaches and coves.May bear looking into.Sasha had time to consider the sun washed color of buildings, pedestrians in holiday gear, a stream of coastline before the village lay behind them.You dont appear to need a navigator.Not yet.Sasha got used to the speed, at least used enough for her heart to stop knocking at every turn of the road.She soothed herself with the sea, the movement of it, the scent of it in the blowing air.The fragrance of flowers mixed with it as they bloomed wild and free on the roadsides, their colors more vivid and intense than any shed seen.Madly red poppies springing out of a field, greedy morning glory smothering hedges in violent blue, the curving branches of a Judas tree bursting with searing magenta.She was here, Sasha thought, to find answers to questions that dogged her.But she was here in such bright, hot beauty, and that alone was a personal miracle.She gave over to it, lifted her face to the sky, let the warm, perfumed air wash over her.Riley had some tidbit about every village they passed through.Sasha wondered what it was like to be a kind of human guidebook, to have traveled so widely, to actually and actively seek out adventure.For now, she let herself be in the moment, one of sun, speed, scenery.She could paint for years here.Maybe her heart knocked again when they sped along a stretch with sharp turns, with the sea a breathless drop tucked close to the road.Gradually they turned west, bypassed a large and busy town Sasha identified on the map as Kassiopi.The road snaked again, skimmed by a lake she longed to sketch.Coming in to Acharavi.Originally called Hebeprobably after Zeuss daughterin ancient times.Then Octavian sacked it in like 32 BC, so the current name, which basically means ungracious life, since being sacked and burned is pretty ungracious.Well take a pit stop there, Riley continued as they flew by a water park.And Ill make those calls.Albania.She gestured to the land mass across the water.Albania, Sasha repeated, both giddy and astonished.Imagine that.A family water park where she could hear squeals as kids came down the slides on one side, and the coast of Albania on the other.Was that really any more amazing than a star of fire?Acharavi bustled with its wide array of shops lining the main street.April had barely begun but holiday goers thronged the resort town, wandering the shops or enjoying lunch at one of the pavement cafes.Spring break, Riley commented, and turned off the main road.A lot of Brits and Americans, Id say, because I see a lot of pale skin thats going to burn.Hope you stocked up on the sunscreen, Irish.Im covered there, thanks.The minute she stopped, he boosted himself out, rolled his shoulders.You picked a good spot to stretch things out.Aim to please.She pulled out her phone.If you two want to walk down to the beach, Ill catch up.Golden sand, sea oats, blue water, and the boats on it, some trailed by skiers.And Albania shadowing the horizon.Sasha grabbed her pack.She wanted ten minutesmaybe twentyjust to sketch.Youre going to want to get yourself a hat, Bran told her.He took his own, dark gray with a wide, flat brim, and dropped it on her head.If Id been wearing one, it wouldve blown off in the first five minutes.She can drive.He hoisted his own pack on his shoulder as they walked.So, did anything strike you along the way?Im thinking shes doing this coastal tour to see if something does.Of course, Sasha thought.Not just a wild ride along the coastbut another kind of search.I shouldve thought of that.No.Its all beautiful, even at the speed of sound, but I didnt feel anything.I dont even know if it works like that.Ive never tried.Why not?Having something unusual, it separates you, makes you feel like the odd man out, I guess.I used to want to fit in, so much, then I finally realized, well, thats not going to happen.Ive just focused on my work, at least until all this started.And now ...Now?Im in Greece and Im looking out at Albaniaso close it looks as if you could swim to it.Its more than anything I could imagine.She closed her eyes, breathed deep.Even the airs exotic.But if she drove here, stopped here hoping Id have some sort of vision, its not happening.I think it wont be so easy.She thought of the visions shed had.Blood and fear and pain and the dark.No, it wont be.We need to find a place, Riley had the right of that.A place the three of us can spread out, study up, plan.A kind of HQ.The idea made her smile.HQs seemed as far removed from her world as swimming to Albania.HQ.Exactly.And as I dont know that the other three youve drawn will just walk up to us, as we did to each other, well need to ramble about like we are today.We have to come together.Until we do, we can look but we wont see; seek, but not find.Not a vision, she said quickly.Just a kind of knowing.Which strikes me as the same.Maybe.I want to sketch while were here.Well need to get you a chair.We can rent one, I expect, or ...Theres a taverna right over there.Hows that view?That would be fine.Once they had a table, and shed angled her chair, he studied the view as she did.Want a beer?Oh, no, thanks.Maybe something cold.Pulling out her pad, she began to draw the flowing sea oats and long slice of beach.He ordered a Mythos for himself, and the Greek juice that was a combination of orange, apple, and apricot for Sasha.As she sketched, he took out his phone to check his emails.Even as he dealt with work he watched her, those slim, pretty hands conjuring a scene with paper and pencil.She left out things that were there, he noted.The people.Her beach was deserted but for birds winging over the sea.She flipped to another page, began another.He supposed shed term them rough sketches, but he found them both wonderfully lean and fluid.It was a kind of magic, he thought, that she could with quick, sure strokes of a pencil create her vision.She started a thirda different perspective, he saw.Not quite the beach spread in front of them, and hers with a moon, not quite full, floating through a drift of clouds over a sea where waves tossed.A woman stood at the edge of the sea, facing it, her dark hair a tumble to her waist.Her skirts billowed around her knees.To her right, high, sheer cliffs rose, and on them stood the shadow of a house where a light glowed in a single window.When Sasha stopped, turned back to finally pick up her drink, he set his phone down.Will she go into the sea or back to the house on the cliff?I dont know.Sasha blew out a breath, sipped again.I dont think she knows either.Its not here.I dont know why I looked out there and saw this so clearly.Maybe were close.Shes the only person you drew.In the other sketches of this beach, you left out the people.Oh.She shrugged.Its more peaceful without them.I dont usually draw people.Or I didnt.When I was studying and we used models, Id end up reading them.Its the focus, and it always felt so intrusive.I learned how to block it out, but it didnt seem worth the effort.I like the mystery of a scene empty of people.She propped her chin on her fist, smiled at him.You like scenes full of people.Conversationssomething shed avoided tucked away in the mountainstook a different tone, had a new appeal, when she had them with someone who knew what she was, and accepted.And how would you know?Clubs, she explained.You own clubs, and perform, so you must like people.And audiences who marvel at your magic tricks.I can appreciate an empty beach as well.But ...He held up a hand, empty palm toward her, closed it into a fist, flashed out his other hand.Then offered her a curved white shell from his once empty palm.I like the marvel.She laughed, shook her head.How do you do that?Nothing up my sleeve.And no smoke and mirrors around either.She traced the edges of the shell.How did you learn to do magic?You could say its a family tradition.My mother actually taught me my first ...bit.Your mother.Does she perform, too?In her way.Because he liked her laugh, he took a deck of cards from his pack, fanned them out.Pick a card, any card.She drew one out, glanced at it.Now what?Back in it goes, and you take the deck.Shuffle it up.We should reward ourselves with a swim at the end of the day.Which would you pick, sea or pool?The sea.If no one else was on the beach, she added to herself.How often will I have the chance to swim in the Ionian?Is that enough?It is, sure, if it feels enough for you.Set the deck down again, and fan it out yourself.She did as he instructed, leaned forward, eyes sharp.Now where do you suppose your card might be.Here?he tapped a card.No, no, maybe here.Ah, here comes our Riley.Playing cards and drinking beer, while Ive been sweating over a hot cell phone.She dropped down, picked up what was left of Brans beer, and drained it.Hes doing a card trick, but I dont think its working out for him.Such lack of faith and wonder.Bran sighed.He ran a fingertip along the fanned cards.Not here or there at all, it seems, because ...Do you mind?he said to Riley and took the hat from her head, turned it over.Your Queen of Hearts is in Rileys hat.Sashas eyes widened.Thats not possible.And yet it is.He held up the queen between two fingers, turned his hand at the wrist, and held nothing.Ive gotta say, Riley commented as Sasha gaped.Thats some of the best close up magic Ive seen.I also have to say Ive done some magic of my own.Weve got a place if we want it.How did the card get in Rileys hat when she wasnt here?Sasha demanded.But she is here, and shes polished off my beer.But ...Then with a laugh, Sasha held up her hands in surrender.I want to see you do it again when Did you say you found a place?Yeah, and that earns me a beer of my own.But Ill wait until we get there, take a look at it.Its not far.Just outside of Sidari.I saw Sidari on the mapwest of here.You got it.I had some luck.Now Riley reached out, took a long sip of Sashas juice.Friend of a friend of an uncle.Its his villa, and hes in the States on business for the next few weeks.His lucky day, too, as the couple who was caretaking the place had to leave just yesterday.Guy took a bad fall, broke his leg.So the friend of a friend of an uncle says we can use the place if we do the caretaking thing.What does that mean, exactly?Bran asked.Yard work, gardening, maintaining the pooldid I mention theres a pool?Theres also a dogso feed and waterand chickens.Chickens?Sasha repeated.Feed and water again, and help ourselves to the eggs.We take care, we stay for free until he gets back in about four weeks.Sounds like a hell of a deal to me.We should certainly have a look.Bran put his cards back in their case.Ready for it?Nodding, Sasha got to her feet.I think I could live with staying at a villa on the Ionian Sea.Its just when things sound too good to be true ...Theres usually a catch.Bran stood, took her hand.Why dont we go find the catch, see if we can live with whatever it might be.The road west was nearly straight, until it wasnt.Then it was a quick series of curves and loops Riley drove with the same careless speed.Sasha saw clearly why Sidari was billed as the top resort area in the north.Its situation right on the bay, its spectacular views.Too many people was her first thought, far too many filling the streets, the beaches, the shops.The noise of them made her head ache, stretched her nerves wire thin.But the jittery feeling didnt pass, even when theyd left the town behind, turned onto a narrow road.She shifted her gaze to the sea again, trying to recapture that sensation of being in the moment.She saw it, knew it, understood the feeling now.The promontory rose up from the sea, high and proud.Shed stood there with him, in the night wind of an oncoming storm.He had lightning in his hand, and she a terrible burning in her heart.Her painting.She hadnt shown them, either of them, and yet the road had brought them here.Dimly she heard Rileys voice talking about coves and inlets, caves, both above and under water.Its going to get bumpy, Riley added.House is up, on the cliff.Views ought to be killer.She didnt look, not yet.She already knew what shed see.Instead she concentrated on the wildflowers, blooming heroically along the side of what was now no more than a track, even blooming in the track itself.The jeep banged and bumped, forced Riley to at last slow down, then stop when they came to a set of iron gates.Ive got the passcode.She leaned out, punched the code into a keypad.He said he had a neighbor come by this morning to feed the dog, do the chicken deal, check on things.And claims the dogs friendly.The road smoothed out a bit, then made a sweeping turn.Just let me say score!With a little war whoop, Riley arrowed toward the villa.Not the kind of digs I usually bunk in.In rich cream against blue sky, the villa rose on its high perch.It angled toward the sea, offering that sweep of view from front and back.The impressive front boasted enough room for a swath of flowering bushes, a few fruit trees, and a verdant lawn before the stone wall.And there the land dropped off as if cleaved by axes.Even the rough steps leading down to the beach made Sasha think of muscular gnomes or trolls with primitive tools hacking at the stone.It owned a majestic set of doors, jutting terraces, wide expanses of glass.More flowers, more trees graced the side of the house where a stone pathway wandered.Even as Riley turned off the car, a big white dog, a fuzzy polar bear with a long, feathered tail, came strolling out of the shady trees toward the car.Hes huge.Sasha forgot her nerves long enough for new ones to shove in.You said friendly.Hes just a big boy.Hey, Apollohis names Apollo.Fearlessly, Riley got out of the car, crouched, held out a hand.The dog stopped, stared into her eyes.The moment stretched so long Sasha considered jumping out, pulling Riley back in.Though she wondered if a dog that big could simply eat the jeep, with them in it.Then he walked over to Riley, tail wagging, and nuzzled her outstretched hand.Youre a good boy.She straightened, set a hand on Apollos head when he sat.What are you guys waiting for?Just waiting to see how big a chunk he might take out of you.Bran launched himself out of the jeep and, just as casually as Riley, stroked a hand down the dogs back.Come on, Sasha, read him if youre worried.You should be able to read a dog, Riley pointed out.They have feelings.Whats he feeling?Happy.Sasha sighed and got out of the jeep.Hes feeling really happy.Pack animals.Riley bent down, kissed the dogs head.Need a pack, and thats going to be us for a bit.Ive got the alarm code, too, and it seems the caretakers left the keys in the potted palm by the cliff wall, so ...Riley, striding confidently in worn boots, the dog at her heels, walked over to the wall.Wowzer view.Have a gander.Sasha made herself walk over to the stone wall, and there, far below, was the beach shed drawn at the table at the tavern, when the image of it had overlaid the other.Its only missing the moon and the woman, Bran said quietly.Say what?I drew this while we were waiting for you at Acharavi, Sasha told Riley.I didnt know where it was.Now I do.She was there, down there at the edge of the water.The woman we havent met yet.And the villa was a silhouette on the cliff.Pleased, Riley fisted her hands on her hips.Excellent.So this is where were supposed to be.I guess it is.The dog bumped his head under Sashas hand, looked up at her with appealing dark eyes, radiating the happiness shed just felt from him.It made her smile again.This is where.Then lets go check it out.I call first pick on bedrooms.Riley set off at a run, and with a joyful bark, Apollo raced behind her.We can flip a coin for second pick, Bran offered, and Sasha felt her balance return.As if Id flip a coin with a magician.I call it, she announced, and ran after the dog.FOUR     			Sasha believed herself to be a creature of order, of practical routine.When she elected to do something outside that routine, it was after careful thought and deliberation.Or it had been until shed flown to Corfu.Now, roughly twenty four hours after shed checked in, unpacked her bags, she was packing them again, preparing to check out, to move into a villa with two people shed known less than a day.And no matter how many times she questioned the sanity of it, she knew it was the right thing to do.The only thing to do if she wanted real answers.The villa was beautiful, spacious, and even a woman who considered herself practical couldnt deny the thrill of walking through it, considering shed live there for ...However long she did.Tumbled tile floors, she thought as she carefully packed, wide, wide stretches of sparkling glass, the soaring entranceway and double curves of stairs leading to the second floor.Where, Sasha recalled, Riley had arrowed toward.Her new friend chose the master with its massive bed, one Riley had bounced on gleefully before bulleting into the en suite and crowing in triumph over the freestanding stone tubbig enough for a partyand the equally generous shower.For herself, Sasha had studied several options, all lovely, but had fallen for the four poster with its domed and pleated canopy of sea blue linen.Like the other bedrooms, it opened to a terrace, and she imagined herself painting there.Even when she realized her view would include the promontory, she couldnt persuade herself to select a room facing away.She closed her suitcases, checked the room twice to be sure shed left nothing behind, and was about to call for a bellman when someone knocked at the door.She opened it to Bran.Are you set then?he asked.Yes, just now.I was going to call for a bellman.He glanced in at her suitcases, pack, tote.We should be able to handle it.He hooked her tote around the handle of one suitcase, slung her pack over his shoulder.Can you manage the other?Sure, but can we handle your bags, too?Ive already taken them down, loaded them.Of course, Ive about half of what youve got here.Of course you do.Youre a man.Sasha walked out behind him without giving her room a backward glance.I am that.Ill just check on Riley, and well Well, no need, he added as Riley stepped out, rolling a single wheeled duffle behind her.Thats it?Your backpack and a duffle?Sasha demanded.Got everything I need and room for more.Sasha looked at her own luggage, actually felt Rileys smirk.I have my art supplies, she began.Uh huh.With the smirk still in place, Riley headed for the elevator.I do!And my travel easel, several small canvases, a spare sketchbook, not to mention paints, brushes.Your brushes arent going to make it in this elevator on this trip.You two go, Bran suggested.Ill take the stairs.That case is heavy, Sasha began.Its the spare sketch pad.Sasha gave Riley a scowl, then laughed.Oh, shut up.She maneuvered her case into the elevator, turned to thank Bran.But he was already gone.By the time shed checked out, they had her luggage loaded, and everything strapped in with bungee cords out of Rileys duffle.Sasha eyed them doubtfully, thought of her painting supplies.Will those really hold?Havent let me down yet.Kick ass villa, here we come.Riley roared off just as she had that morning.This time, Bran shared the backseat with luggage.You should have the front.Sasha swiveled around.I didnt think of it.Im smaller than you, and wouldnt be as crowded.Oh, were fine here, me and your paintbrushes.And the way Riley drives, well be there long before my legs have time to cramp.The speedoutrageousseemed slightly more exhilarating than frightening this time.Sasha took in the blur of sea and flowers, cars, sun washed buildings while she half listened to Riley and Bran debate whether to stop somewhere for lunch or just get where they were going.She didnt care either way.It was all so surreal, and reckless.Prior, the most reckless thing she could remember doing had been hacking off her hair when shed been twelve.An act of anger and defiance shed regretted before the last snip of the scissors.Clearly, this reckless act carried more risk and weightand yet, just at the moment, it felt absolutely right.Shed unpack first, she decided.She wouldnt feel settled until she did.And then shed set up her easel ...maybe outside, try a chalk study of the gardens.Or try a watercolor.She rarely used that medium, but  			Whats your vote?Riley demanded.Sorry, what?Food or destination?Youre the tie breaker.Oh, it doesnt matter.Tie breaker, Riley insisted.It has to matter.Brans for getting there.Im for food.I dont want to be the tie breaker.Youre stuck with it.Hes all theres food in the villathe caretakers had it stocked and weve got the green light to use what we want, but we have to get there, then throw something together.Can anybody cook?Of course I can cook, Sasha began, and immediately saw her mistake.Im absolutely not going to be in charge of the kitchen.A big, beautiful kitchen, she remembered, and she wouldnt mind making a meal or two, but  			Somebody has to be.If you want something fried up on a Coleman stove, Im your girl, otherwise, Im sandwiches and stirring.I can stir.And chop, she added.Im hell on chopping.I dont know how to cook for people.What do you cook for?Bran wondered.Bears?Myself.But  			Im not bad at breakfast.Bran rolled right over her objections.But I doubt anyones up for a full fry every meal.Sidaris not far, for going out to eat, but if were wanting more privacy to discuss our business, a home cooked seems the thing.Sashas definitely elected.Popular vote.I abstain.Honestly, she felt a tickle of panic in her throat at being voted in charge of anything.Or abdicate.Miles flew by as they argued about it, and as Sasha began to see herself in a losing battle.Were definitely stopping for lunchtie brokenand if anyones hungry tonight, they can eat one of Rileys famous sandwiches.My specialty.Ill cook something tomorrow night after Ive had time to think about it, but after that ...She trailed off, struck by the sight of a hitchhiker, brim of his ball cap tipped down, his thumb cocked out.We still have to eat after that, Riley said.I get cranky when Im hungry, and you dont want me  			Stop!Shed only glimpsed his face as theyd passed, but it was enough.Stop the car!Riley reacted quickly, hit the brakes.Whats the deal?she demanded as she swerved to the side of the road.Back up.The hitchhiker.Turn around or back up.The hitchhiker.Oh, yeah.Riley tipped down her sunglasses, aimed a look as sarcastic as her tone.Weve got plenty of room for one more.Sasha pushed out of the jeep.He is one more.Of us.No shit?Bran boosted out of the jeep as Sasha took a step down the shoulder.Just lets hold here a minute then, darling.Hes coming to us.Lets gauge our ground first.He jogged up the road and still seemed to saunter, a pack hitched to his back, hiking boots worn and dusty.He wore the black ball cap over shaggy, dark blond hair.His eyes, though she couldnt see them behind the dark glasses, she knew to be gray.He sent them a quick, sunny smile.Kalimera, he began.Efkharisto, ah  			Dont strain yourself, Bran advised.English works.Good thing.Thanks for stopping.American, are you?Im surrounded.Yeah.Sawyer, Sawyer King.He added a fresh smile and a nod when Riley walked up.Where are you heading, Sawyer King?she asked.Oh, around for now.A ride however far youre going would work, but you look pretty packed in.That we are, Bran agreed.Were going a bit past Sidari.Bran Killian.Irish, huh?Sawyer accepted the offered hand.Yall vacating?Not exactly.Riley turned, looked meaningfully at Sasha.Well?Yes, Im sure.Sawyer hooked a thumb in his belt loopan easy stancebut clearly went on alert.Sure of what?A picture could be worth any number of words, Sasha decided.Can you wait a minute?Yeah.He flashed a grinquick lightningbut stayed on alert.Ive always got time.She went to the jeep, leaned in to pull out her tote from where it was wedged on the floor of the backseat.She dug out her portfolio, then the sketch of the six.She took it back to him, offered it.I drew that about three weeks ago, in North Carolinawhere I live.He studied it, took his sunglasses off, studied it a bit more.Yes, gray eyes, like evening mist over a shadowy lake.He said, Huh.I know how strange it soundsisbut Ive got other drawings in here.Of us, of youof this, she said, waving her arms.Who are you?Sasha Riggs, and this is Riley Gwin.Who are the other two in the drawing?I dont know.The way things are moving, Bran said, I dont think itll be long before we find out.As I dont think this strikes you as strange as it might, youll know what I mean by the Stars of Fortune.Sawyer swung his sunglasses by the earpiece.Yeah, I know what you mean.So we can discuss all this here, on the side of the road, and risk being mowed down by a passing car whose driver enjoys great rates of speed, as does our Riley, or we can go discuss it over a pint.Wouldnt say no to a beer.Sawyer handed the sketch back to Sasha.I change my vote.We should go straight to the villa.Sawyer lifted his eyebrows.Youve got a villa?Friend of a friend of an uncle.Hands on hips, Riley studied the jeep, the luggage.Im good at making things fit, but this is it.Sashas going to have to sit on your lap, Sawyer.Hell have the back, Bran corrected.She can sit on mine, as shes known me longer.That cant be legal.To drive like that.Riley snorted, headed to the drivers door.You kill me, Sash.Its only about twenty more kilometers.Bran nudged her toward the jeep.Well all be fine.He got in, patted a hand on his legs.Come on then.Dont be so delicate, Sasha.Jesus, youve already slept with the guy.I did not.Well, technically, but  			To solve it, Bran took her hand, pulled her in.This should be fun.Sawyer swung long legs over the back, slid down.Yeah, were a merry band.Riley bulleted back on the road, and had Sashas knuckles whitening on the dashboard she gripped like the last thread of life.Relax.Amused, Bran wrapped his arms around her waist, eased her back.Its clear enough were not meant to die in a car crash in a borrowed jeep on the way to a borrowed villa.Speaking of villas.Riley flicked a glance in the rearview.You cook, Sawyer?And Sasha, crushed on Brans lap, flying down the road like a reckless and carefree teenager, laughed until her sides ached.By the time they bumped up the track toward the gate, it had been established that Sawyer could cook, which, according to Riley, made him cocaptain of the kitchen with Sasha.Three bedrooms are spoken for, Riley continued.But there are four more, so youve got next pick.Just like that?Well have that drink, and maybe Riley will create some of her world renowned sandwiches.Then, Bran added, we can all decide.Hes one of us, Riley said simply as she took the turn that brought the villa into full view.From the backseat, Sawyer let out a whistle.Yobanny v rot.Riley angled back to study him.Howd a nice Virginia boythats a coastal Virginia accent you got there.Good ear.Little place called Willow Cove, on the Chesapeake.Yeah, so howd a nice Virginia boy learn to swear in Russian?Russian grandfather.You speak Russian?Im multilingual in obscenities.And yeah, the place earns a yobanny v rot.What does it mean?Sasha asked.Cleanest translation?Holy shit.Riley pushed out of the jeep to greet the dog.Hey, Apollo.Were back.Look at that.With a young boys delight in his voice, Sawyer swung out and, without preamble or introductions, scrubbed his hands all over the dog.Youre one big, handsome bastard.This your house?Youre a lucky dog.Apollo sat, offered a paw.Watching them, Sasha forgot her situation until she turned her head, smiled at Bran.And found their faces intimately close.Oh, sorry.I need to get offout.I suppose you do.Though its cozy here.He opened the door, then slid an arm under her legs.Let me give you a hand, he said, and swiveled her around.Just held there.Ah.Thanks.Youre welcome.He let her go, took his time getting out behind her.Everybody grab something, Riley ordered.Lets haul it in.Bran, maybe you can give the newest member of our club the tour while I make those sandwiches.If I dont eat soon, Im going to take a bite out of somebody.When they carted luggage in, and Sawyers head turned side to side and up, Bran gave Sashas ponytail a tug.Well haul this up, Sawyer and I.  Why dont you see about those pints?Okay.So she wouldnt unpack firstshed have a sandwich, help Riley and Bran explain things to Sawyer.And hopefully have Sawyer explain things to them.And she wanted a couple minutes to really look at the place, so crossed the entrance with its warm golden tiles into the airy living area.The wide windows could be shuttered against the beat of the sun, but she loved the light pouring in.Twin sofas in bold peacock blue formed a conversation area centered by a large leather ottoman of chocolate brown.Cream colored built ins flanked a fireplace of glossy tiles in that same blue and held a colorful collection of glassware and pottery.A vivid pattern of exotic birds that seemed poised to take flight covered deeply cushioned chairs.A tall chest boasted doors carved in a similar pattern and looked old and exquisite.But the pull of the room lay outside the glass, in the sweep of flowers and trees that led to the cliff edge and out to the rich blue sea.Hey.She turned to Riley.Its just beautiful.Yeah.Bask later.Food now.Youre in charge of sandwiches.Its a big kitchen.Plus I just got a text letting me know we can hit any of the wine up here.If we go through it, theres a wine cellarbut anything we take from there, we replace.Im going for wine instead of the brew.How about you?I usually dont this early in the day.Obviously amused, Riley cocked a hip.Are you usually in a villa in Greece about to talk about god stars this early in the day?No.Good point.Ill have the wine.Sasha followed, past an archway that opened into a room with a piano and another smaller fireplace, another room filled with books, a formal dining room, a masculine den or study, and on to the kitchen.Riley had thrown open the triple doors of glass to the shaded terrace beyond so the scent of lemons and roses danced in on the breeze.This is the most incredible place.I cant believe anyone would just let us stay here.Pays to have contacts.The guy has vineyards.Riley tapped a bottle of white shed taken from the wine cooler.I figured its only polite we start with one of his.Why dont you deal with that?Okay.She ran a hand over one of the counters, the granite swirled with gold and cream and brown.A kitchen this big should be intimidating, but its homey.Everythings really up to date, but you contrast that with the dishes in the breakfront there, the butcher block table and island, the cottagey style chairs, and its relaxed.Ill be more relaxed with food and wine.Sasha hunted up a corkscrew while Riley poked through an enormous refrigerator.Big pantry over thereyou could live in it.And a vegetable garden outside were to harvest from.Well work out some sort of divvying for the yard work.And the chickens.The coops out behind the garden.Riley sliced from a big round of brown bread.Thats a commercial stove, she added, which means Im not going near it.Though she couldnt wait to try it out, Sasha decided to keep that to herself before Riley decided she was full captain of the kitchen again.The men wanted beer.Is there beer?Riley jerked a thumb at the refrigerator, and switched from slicing bread to slicing tomatoes.We should eat outside.Ill set that up.She found bamboo place mats, opted for the colorful plates, cherry red napkins, and entertained herself setting a festive table under the wooden slats of a pergola.She transferred the bowl of fruit from the butcher block to the outside table, turned back when she heard male voices.Lets test it out then.She came back in as Bran poured a small amount of the wine into a glass.After a sip, he nodded.Ill go with it.Make it unanimous.You scored a hell of a place here.My thoughts exactly.Sasha says we eat outside, and Im all for it.Riley set the last of four enormous sandwiches on a platter, dumped half the contents of a bag of chips into a bowl.Lets eat.Sasha eyed the size of the sandwiches, and when they sat down, cut one in half, put the second half back on the platter.Bran took a hefty bite of his own.Youre definitely the queen of sandwiches.Busy with her own, Riley nodded.Its a gift.So, Sawyer King, well start with the lightning round for the fabulous prize of a stay in a fabulous villa by the sea.Whats your version of the Stars of Fortune?He held up a finger until he swallowed, then picked up his wine.The way I heard it, a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away  			Points for the Star Wars reference.A favorite.Three goddesses of the moon, to celebrate the rise of their new queen, created three stars, one of fire, one of ice, one of water.He told it well, seemed to have no problem being the focus of attention.Okay, that jibes.Riley crunched into a chip.For the second part of the round  			A two parter.Yeah.How do you know about them?My Russian grandfather.Is that so?Bran poured more wine all around.Yeah, thats so.It was one of his favorite stories, which is what I thought it was when I was a kid.Just a story.But he got sick a while backwe didnt think he was going to make it, and neither did he.Thats when he sat me down, told me it was truth, and more than truth, a kind of destiny.Mine.And you believed him?Sasha asked.Hed never lied to me in my life, Sawyer said simply.Dedulya told me the story, and the responsibility, had been passed down in the family for generations.Over ...time, many had searched, but no luck.But, well, into each generation a seeker is born.Oh.Riley pointed at him.Serious bonus points for the paraphrase of Buffy.I like to rack them up.He said I was it, and Id know I was on the right path when I met five other seekers.He plucked a couple of grapes from the bowl.Looks like three out of five so far.Dedulyaand it shouldnt sound any more weird than the rest of thishes sort of psychic.And was that passed down, too?Bran wondered.Not to me.Why here?Sasha asked.Why Corfu?Since they were there, Sawyer dumped more chips on his plate.Ive been at this awhile, hitting dead ends, but gathering some information.Separating the obvious bullshit from what might not be is the key.I was on Sardiniahell of a placeand traced a lead.This story about Poseidonnot Neptune, so Greek not Roman, and Im in Italy.Anyway, Poseidon and Korkyra.Pleased, Riley, took a handful of grapes for herself.The beautiful nymph he loved, and who he brought to an unnamed island.He named it Korkyra, for her.Right, and that became Kerkyra.Corfu.The story talked about a Fire Star, gone cold, hidden between land and sea, and waiting to flame again.So, I followed the lead.Same lead I picked up.Riley popped a grape in her mouth.You?Sawyer gestured to Bran.Mine spoke of the land of Phaiax.Poseidons and Korkyras son, so the island inhabitants were once Phaeacians, and Corfu the island thereof.You know a lot about it, Sawyer commented.She has a doctorate, Bran told him.No shit?Well, Dr.Gwin, did I pass the audition?Youve got my vote.Sasha dreamed of you, with us, Bran pointed out.So theres no question, really.I have one.I just wonder, Sasha began, what you do?How you support yourself while you search?Im a traveler, and I fix things.He held up his hands, wiggled his fingers.When youre handy, you can always pick up work.And one more?You spoke of your grandfather in the present tense, so he recovered.Now Sawyer grinned.Yeah.Hes tough.Im glad.What about you guys?Seer, magician, digger, Riley said, pointing to each in turn.Sawyer studied Sasha.I figured that, with the dreams and the drawing.Im an artist.If she could have, Sasha would have shrugged the term seer off like an itchy sweater.The other is just what it is.Okay.So whats a digger?Archaeologist, mythology a specialty.Huh.Indiana Jones.Fits.And magician.The grin came back.Like: Watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat?Oh, if thats Rocky and Bullwinkle, this could be love.Sawyer laughed over at Riley.Alumnus of Wossamotta U.  Tricks and illusions, escapes?he asked Bran.Thats right.Bran held up a coin, turned his hand, vanished it.It pays the bills.Very cool.So, what now?It could be we ended up here so wed hook with you, Riley speculated.But you were heading in the same direction.Felt right.Yeah, it feels right.The drawing you made of the beach, the moon, Bran said to Sasha.It wasnt of Sawyer, but a woman.From the back, yes, but the body type, the hair, its clear shes the one in your other drawings.Id like to see it again, Sawyer said.And youve got more?Sasha rose.Yes.Ill get them.Youre not going to eat that?Riley gestured to the half sandwich.No, I couldnt.I can.Where do you put it?Bran wondered.You eat like a birdas in triple your own weight.Fast metabolism.Ill do my share, clear this up, while Sasha gets the drawings.Sawyer pushed away from the table, turned to the view of the sea.Beats the hell out of pitching a tent.I hear that, Riley agreed, and bit into the sandwich.* * *  			They spent more than an hour going over the sketches, discussing theories, locations theyd triedexcept for Sashastories theyd heard.Then Riley announced she was giving her brain a rest, and trying out the pool.Resting the brains a good idea, Bran decided.Its been an illuminating couple of days.I wouldnt mind getting my bearings.Still Sawyer picked up a sketch of the woman theyd yet to meet.Do you think shes really this hot?Thats how I see her.Cant wait to meet her.Im going to wander around.Sawyer got to his feet again.I like to have a better sense of where I am while Im there.The pool looks good.Might end up there.Plenty of room.Regroup later?Without waiting for an answer, Riley strolled back into the house.Its the first time Ive had a team on this.Its been interesting so far.With that, Sawyer wandered off.Your sense about him?Bran asked Sasha.Oh, Sawyer?Adores his grandfatherthats a tight bond.Optimism.I get a strong sense of optimism, and a strong sense of purpose.I dont like to pry, she added, but it seemed we should know.Theres something more to himI dont know whatbut I didnt get any ...evil.I guess its not too strong a word, considering.I dont get anything dark or evil.In fact, so much the opposite.You trust him.Dont you?Im a bit slower with that than you might be, but he strikes me as true enough.And there he is, after all.He tapped the sketch.Well, Im after a walk on the beach.Come with me.
