Were doing as well as we can with the diagnosis, she said, making it sound almost as if shed known as long as her mother had.Now, when Id like her nearby, when shes getting worse, I want a house for her.A one level house.A beautiful flat house.Shes certainly not up to looking at houses, but everyone knows youre the best there is.Fortunately, my father took care of my motherhe passed a long time ago.That San Francisco house will bring a nice price and she has a healthy pension.She can afford to spend her last months in comfort.Almost anything in San Francisco can fetch a good price.Do you know what kind of house youre looking for besides one level?She shook her head.I dont.It has to be ready.We dont have weeks or months to decorate.Even though my mother isnt getting around much, it should be spacious.And will you be staying with her?Im sure Ill be spending my share of nights there, but lets think of her.I want her to have something to look at  				Oceanfront?That would be wonderful, but anything that doesnt feel like a hospital room.She has ALS.The symptoms are coming faster now.I think shell be bedridden in a few months.And your price range?I dont have one.I dont know how much my mother has socked away, but theres plenty.She has old family money and, Ray Anne, I dont want any of it.I want her nearby or else Ill have to close the shop and go to San Francisco until...She cleared her throat.If you find something wonderful, Ill look at it and if its perfect, Ill find a way.My mother has always lived well.I assume you want to rent?Im flexible, Grace said.If theres nothing stunning for rent but theres a listing thats perfect, I can always sell it...She looked down.Later, she finally said.Ray Anne reached out and touched her arm.There are some nice properties around.Have you looked online?I havent.But I could  				Dont worry about it.Write your email address on the back of this card, she said, helping herself to one of Graces flower shop business cards and flipping it over.Ill get right to work on this.I can see why youre in a hurry.Ill send you some links.Is this possible, Ray Anne?Grace asked.Because I have to convince my mother that this is a better idea than me moving to San Francisco for a year.If its possible, darling, I can do it.Itll give me a chance to show Ginger a few things about real estate and hunting property in case...Well, my darling girl is with me for at least a few weeks, maybe longer, and were visiting local businesses to see if anyone needs help.Ginger wants to work while shes here.Are you serious?What kind of work?Grace asked.Ginger flushed and looked down.My experience is mostly in retail.I worked in womens clothing, housewares, a little bit in an office.Ive done a lot of things.Did you work in decorating at all, while you worked in housewares?I wouldnt call it decorating, no.But I did things like bridal registries.Im desperate for help.Especially now, with my mother and all.Do you have any interest in flower design?This is a small boutique, but its busy.Not crowded, but busy.There are a lot of phone orders and arrangements to design.I spend a lot of time in the workroom, putting them together.Most of them are not originals but created from pictures I have and theyre pretty easy to learn.I try new things from time to time.I dont know, she said with a shrug.I could try.Would you like to spend a morning with me?Just to see how it feels?Its very messy work.Could I?The idea of a small shop appeals to me a lot more than a restaurant or she glanced at Ray Anne real estate.Its okay, babe, Ray Anne said.Not everyone is cut out for my job, even though they think they are.Can you come tomorrow morning?Early?Eight oclock?I can do that, she said.Wonderful!Ray Anne, thank you.Send me pictures, please.Sixteen  				Mikhail Petrovs flight arrived promptly at three in the afternoon and he walked into the baggage claim area with a duffel over his shoulder.He was sixty six and his face was whiskery and lined with age, but his hair was reddish brown.Bad color, Grace thought.Hed had bad hair color for so many years.But for a man his age, he was fit and strong.Small but built like an ox with his big shoulders and short legs.She held up her tablet upon which she had typed, in very large letters, PETROV.He didnt smile, but she did.He was accustomed to limos or at least town car service.It wasnt as if he wouldnt recognize the best figure skater hed ever coached.I see, he said.You think youre funny.I do, she said, grinning.Do you have luggage?He held out his duffel.Only this.Two days, maybe three, that is all I have for you.Not for me, Mikhail.You came for Winnie, remember?Right, he said.Lead the way.Grace directed him to the parking area and opened the back of the van.It was custom painted in pink, yellow, purple, blue with lime green lettering in script.Pretty Petals.Your luggage, sir.What is this?he said, handing over the duffel.The flower mobile, she said.Jump in front.We have a long drive.He did as he was told Well make one stop, golubushka.The grocer, please, he said.You wont need food, she said, buckling in.Is just for some fruit, if you dont mind so much.You drive this thing?Remember Mamie and Ross Jenkins?Ross taught me to drive.I love driving!Love the control.Tell me, Mikhail, have you been well?You look exactly the same.They call it preserved, he said.I have been six months traveling and now we train in Chicago.There are three assistants and twelve US contenders, from which the US will take a few to the finals, maybe not mine.There is time, but this will be my last Winter Games, if any of my girls are selected.From the look of it, I say there is no a chance in hell.But there is time.And sheet of gods, they need it!He turned in his seat and looked at her.Tell me how is Winifred?I spent the day with her yesterday.The first day Ive spent with her in five years.She looks very beautiful, but shes thinner and has aged.I think its the stress of knowing shes battling ALS and is losing.The tremors and weakness are obvious and she said this is just within the past few months.She has no idea how much time she has.Shes taking a drug to slow the progression but shes cynicalshe doesnt see how it matters.She said, What good is three more months?All she wants to do is clean house, so to speak.Settle her affairs.Get the end of her life in order, but this would mean in order to her satisfaction.Its not as though she can control it from the grave.She bit her lips against the threat of tears.If anyone can do that, is Winifred, he grumbled.I am afraid she has contract with God.That brought a laugh from Grace.Spurts of laughter through tears had become common the past few days.We never communicated, Mikhail.She instructed, criticized, praised, but we never talked about our feelings.I talked with my therapist or Mamie.Now I understand that Winnie wasnt ready to retire when I was.It destroyed her.There is the thing with athletes and their mothers.He peered at her.The mother is not doing skating.She cant make decisions like that.She is there for cheering, no more.It is not about Winifred.Unless she wants to take on the ice, then it is not about her.Is about you.I wish Id understood, Grace said.You understood, he said.You knew.You did the right thing.Is time to have life for yourself.He looked around the van.In flower mobile.Grace pulled into a grocery store lot not far from the resort in Bandon.It occurred to her that since Mikhail wanted some fruit, she could pick up a couple of things for later.Troy would probably come over after his evening at Coopers.They walked into the grocery store and Grace went immediately to the deli and bakery while Mikhail presumably went to the produce section.When she went looking for him he was holding a bottle of vodka and looking a little lost.Have you found your fruit?she asked.Where is raisins?Raisins?Lets see, she said, walking down an aisle and around a central counter.Ah.Raisins.He selected a big box of plump golden raisins.Wow.You like your raisins, she said.Fruit of the gods, he told her.Would you like some apples?Oranges?Bananas?Good to go, he said, heading for the checkout.Are raisins your favorite snack?she asked.Put raisins in the vodka, let sit overnight, perfect.Ah, she said, laughing at his pronunciation.And then you eat the raisins?Nyet!Drink the vodka!She was a little shocked, even though she had remembered that Mikhail liked his wodka, especially after the trials or competitions were done.She laughed softly.Right, she said.* * *  				Virginia let them into the cottage and then discreetly left the room.Winnie was standing beside the sofa.There was a tray of hors doeuvres on a small table, a couple of wineglasses sitting out and an ice bucket.Mikhail dropped his duffel and put his grocery bag on the short counter in the little galley kitchen before entering and going to Winnie.Winifred, this is lie I am told, that you are sick.He put his hands on her face and kissed her cheeks.In high society they stuck to air kissing, but Mikhail always gave the real thing in loud smacks.You are beautiful.Its all fading, she said.Sit down, my dove.You are tired?Weak?Things dont work like they once did but Im getting by fine.Can we get you something?Food?Drink?Ice, he said.A glass and ice.He brought his grocery bag to the chair adjacent to her and pulled out his bottle of vodka, putting it on the coffee table.Grace quickly fixed his glass for him.As refined as ever, Winnie quipped.Grace took one of the chairs near them.It had the feel of a reunion, the way these two poked at each other, but the affection between them was so obvious.Is perfect, he said.What do we give you?Im fine, Mikhail.After youve had a drink, we can order some dinner.Grace, she said.Will you have dinner?A glass of wine?Nothing for me.I have a drive ahead.And your young man?Winnie asked.Mikhail peered at her.Hes working tonight, his part time job.Ill see him later.Grace is in love with a schoolteacher, Winnie said.You could not find her a prince or dictator?Mikhail asked with a smirk.I choose my own men, Grace said.If you dont mind, I think Ill go home now so you can visit.I have to open the shop in the morning, Mother.I have a new employee coming early to train.If youre feeling well, maybe youll come and look at my little town?Lets see what the morning brings, Grace.Then she shook her head.This new name.It just doesnt fit you.Youll get used to it.She gave her mother a kiss on the forehead.Well talk in the morning.* * *  				Left alone, Mikhail fetched the tray of snacks and placed it on the coffee table, within reach.He sampled a small toast square with tapenade and hummed his approval.He sipped his drink.What is your plan, Winnie?he asked.Plan?Do not do this coy with me, it is Mikhail you talk to.You have plan.Like always.I want to take Izzy to San Francisco.Home.But she doesnt want to go.Then why?Leave the child to have her life.She will visit.Theres an estate to settle.A complicated estate.Furnishings, jewelry, art, investments.I cant wave my wand and have it done.Its hers.She has decisions to make.I dont know what she wants to do with all of it.I cant just leave it behind.Ah, you will take it with you?He chuckled and sipped his vodka.If anyone can, is you.I just want to make sure its all properly dealt with.All the possessions.She looks better than Ive ever seen her, Mikhail said.I think it is because the weight of all the world is not on her back.All the burdens of the worldgone.The need to win for her mother, for her team, her country, is done now.Behind her.And she thrives.That is your legacy, WinnieIzzy.She is your estate.Think on this.I have a responsibility...She has had hard life, working to bring home gold when she is only a child.You gave birth to champion, Winnie, and she spent her life to give you what you could not get for yourself.You want her to miss you when you are gone?Set her free.She doesnt work for us any longer.Thats cruel.Is truth.* * *  				When Grace was back in Thunder Point, she texted Troy to tell him she was home with food and wine.If there wasnt so much going on, shed be out at the beach, keeping him company while he served.Instead, she poured herself a glass of wine, got out her laptop and checked messages.Ray Anne had sent her a dozen listings to look at and she breezed through them with disappointment.There was one with a Pacific view that was spacious and beautiful, but the kitchen was dated and the bedrooms were all upstairs.Just like the San Francisco house.Did her mother really want to die in that house?That small mansion?The thought made her shudder.Was that a conversation that had to take place?Two days after she learned about Winnies degenerative disease?She was up to the task of saying, I think you should live near me, where we can be close to each other.But the subtext of that discussion would be, Come to Oregon where I can be available when the end is near.Thats what this was really about, wasnt it?From all she read, she wasnt sure what was involved in taking care of someone with ALS.They could hire nurses.Hospice seemed to be the end stage necessity.But were specialists required?Because Winnie would have to have the best, shed demand it.It seemed many ALS patients needed feeding tubes.IVs.Respirators.Shed have to see Scott Grant, talk to him.Maybe he could tell her what shed need and whether it was all available here.She started to cry.It came at the most unexpected moments and she told herself it was because she was so tired.She hadnt been sleeping well and the pressure was back, that pressure to do the right thing, to please.And this time she had to get it right because her mother was terminal.As soon as she managed to get her crying jag under control, she went back to her internet research.Finally a text came in from Troy.Nice night on the beach.Wont get there till around ten.Then she started to cry again, for no reason and every reason.* * *  				Ginger got up earlier than she had in months.She showered, blew out her hair, applied a little light makeup and put on one of her new outfits.Just to be safe, she put a pair of her old jeans and a T shirt in a little bagGrace had said it was dirty work.Shed ask Grace if she should change before doing anything that might wreck her new clothes.When she looked in the mirror she admitted to herself that Ray Anne had been rightshe needed to be presentable.It didnt make that ache in her heart disappear, but it made her feel slightly less pathetic.Her father had given her some money, just walking around money he called it, but if she earned a little something she might run over to Target in the next town and buy herself some less expensive jeans and shirts that fit, that she could afford to go to work in.Ray Anne was in the kitchen, sitting at the table with her laptop open, glasses perched on the end of her nose, clicking through listings.Well, dont you look pretty, she said.I feel kind of guilty, she said.My mom has been asking me for months to try to do something about my appearance and I blew her off.But Im here two days and you have me cleaned up and in new clothes.Im very bossy that way, Ray Anne said.Plus, we have a lot of shopping history, you and me.Are you excited about your new job?Nervous, she said.What if I just dont have the...energy?Then youll tell Grace you need a break.Get a soda or cup of coffee.Eat a little something.I think youre going to like it.Its such pretty workmaking up beautiful bouquets.Ive never done anything like this before.You helped people pick out their household accessories, linens, dishes, table accoutrements.You have good taste.And if it doesnt prove to be right for you, youll get a different kind of job.I dont think Grace is going to expect you to take on weddings.Shell probably hand you a broom.Probably, Ginger agreed.I think Ill get going.Ginger!Ray Anne snapped.Choke down a cup of coffee and a piece of toast!Dont go to your first day without any fuel!Right, she said, going to the coffeepot.Are you finding anything for Grace?I mean, for her mother?Its pretty tough.I have absolutely no idea what the womans expectations are.I mean the motherswould she be grateful just to be near Grace or is she very particular?There are a couple of little duplexes with good views for rent.Theyre small.I sent pictures to Grace yesterday and last night she emailed back that she was looking for something larger and more custom.Something more like the resort facilities but with a full kitchen and deck and view and one level, at least three thousand square feet.And dont worry about the price, she says.When people say that, they mean anything from two hundred thousand or seven hundred a month rent.They dont know how pricey their wishes and dreams can get.Are you going to ask those things?Sure.Finding the right house usually takes many conversations, never all at once.Asking again and again, dribbling it out, so it isnt so overwhelming.And I find the answers change over time.Unfortunately, Grace is in a hurry.But lucky for her, Im good.Then she smiled.How did you sleep?Very well, as a matter of fact.This house is so quiet.And smallit feels cozy.Plus, I think Im still recovering from shopping with you.I dont have time to screw around, Ray Anne said.Well see how you survive the day and if you get through it all right, Ill plan a dinner with my girlfriends for the end of the week.Theyre dying to get a look at you.Oh, Ray, Im no fun, she complained.You dont have to be fun, but I bet you accidentally have a good time.She snapped her computer shut.I better get on it.I have properties to preview.* * *  				Grace was in the workroom of the shop, working on her designs for centerpieces on order.If she got them done this morning Justin could deliver them all this afternoon.She had three orders for church flowerstwo in Bandon and one in Coquillethat she really couldnt do before Saturday morning.The shop wasnt open yet.She was wearing her yoga pants and a long sleeved T shirtthe mornings on the ocean were pretty nippy in April.Troy was still upstairs in her bed.Leaving him there hadnt been easyhed been facedown, arms stretched over his head, beautiful round booty sticking out of the sheets.She knew if she kissed his shoulder or stroked his handsome butt he would roll over and  				There was a knock at the back door.It was Iris, peeking in the window.What are you doing here?Grace asked, opening the door.Grace, why didnt you call me?I can help you!Call you?Seth and I went for a walk on the beach last night and stopped by the bar for a beer.Troy told us about your motherthat shes here in Oregon and shes sick.I mean, very sick.As in trying to settle her affairs sick.ALS, Grace said somberly.I see her after five years and apparently our reconciliation has an expiration date on it.Oh, Grace, Im so sorry.Thank you.But look, try not to worry.I just have to find a way to make sure our last year together is...My relationship with my mother wasnt like the one you had with your mother.It was...God, she said.Then she started to cry again.Im sorry.I am out of control.My mother and I had a very difficult relationship, but we loved each other.I thought being estranged was for the best, our time together was so frustrating.But I didnt want this.I thought shed live to be a hundred and ten.In fact, she said, brushing away a tear.I thought shed be a giant pain till a very old age.Shes really much too controlling to succumb to this.Iris stroked her upper arm.Listen, I can help you.Im off this week.Im back to school next week, but I can work after school.And Im off all weekend, of course.I can help with big jobs.I can clean up and take orders.Whatever you need.Can you help train a new employee?I gave Ray Annes niece a job and shell be here at eight.Iris puffed up.Yes.I can!I dont want to take advantage of you.Let me help you get on your feet.My mother wants me to go to San Francisco.She wants to get her house in order.Iris made a sad face.She probably has no one else to ask.Oh, she has an army of people to ask.But she wants me involved.Iris, my mother is wealthy.She has expensive things and complicated finances and I think she believes Im not up to the job of taking care of her things.Iris was shaking her head, but she had a kind smile on her face.Its peace of mind, Grace.Ten years before my mother died she started asking me questions like, Before I take this old sewing cabinet to the thrift shop, is it something you might want someday?and Iris, I have all these old Christmas cardsyears of them.Do you want to save them so you know the names of all our acquaintances?I was surprised that it even mattered to her because it didnt matter to me.But it was important to her.And she was the opposite of wealthy.Well, when things lighten up a little, Im going to go for a few days.Ill listen to her tell me what shes worried about, look at her inventory and talk to her lawyers, who I actually already know.I lived in that house for thirteen years.Then she can lock up the house.Im trying to find her something up here so I can see her often.When its all over and done, I can go back, take a couple of things to remember her and have her lawyers arrange an estate sale.Wow, Iris said.The difference between rich and poor.Garage sale versus estate sale.You dont want to live in that house?And do what?I dont know.Have a kitchen and a large bathroom?She rolled her eyes upward, indicating the loft.At that moment, Troy came in the back door.His hair was errant from sleep and he wore a set of sweats that had somehow found a home in Graces loft.Hands in his pockets, he shuffled in wearing his docksiders and no socks.He nodded at Iris and went straight to Grace, kissing her cheek.Id rather have this, Grace said, putting her arms around his waist.* * *  				Iris, Troy and Grace had a completely unplanned and very productive brainstorming session and it was Iris who provided a solution, if Winnie would go along with it.Go now, she said.Go now, while Im on spring break.Take a few days.Make sure you leave me with your flower orders.Knowing you, you have everything you need for Peyton and Scotts wedding written down somewhere so I can place the order.If your new assistant is good, shell be available to open the shop next week if youre still gone.If not, she said with a shrug, Ill post a sign.Closed For Family Business.Leave me your work cell and Ill fill phone orders after school.I can help, Troy said.Grace bit her lip.I was kind of hoping youd come with me, she said.Me?I dont want to get in the way.Even if its just for a couple of days...You should, Troy, Iris agreed.All thisGraces mother, the business of Grace dealing with her will and propertythis could affect you.Shes right, Troy.If you can.If you dont want to, I understand.I know my mother can be hard to take.Winnie doesnt get to me like she gets to you, he said.But you better open this discussion about her relocation right away.She doesnt strike me as the kind of woman who gives in to someone elses ideas easily.And moving out of her home when shes sick and feeling vulnerablethat might be too much to ask of her.Moving is hard, but Winnie wont have to actually do any moving.Shes been directing traffic her whole life.Shell have other people do it all.Shell board a plane.Her assistant will handle everything from the luggage to the flight.Shes the gatekeeper of the records and BlackBerry.When I was young, before I left Mothers house, there was a different assistant in charge and my mother showed me a cataloged inventory of her possessions that was as thick as a big city phone book.Must be nice, Iris said.Its how she chooses to live, the same way her parents lived.Its not that its easya lot of energy goes into everything she does.And she does good things.Shes a socialiteshes raised millions for charities.But she cant drive a car.I prefer a different kind of life, a much lighter load.I dont want my life to be that complicated.She thought for a second.This could work except for one thingthe Lacoumette Grant wedding.I have to be back for that.I want to be back for that wedding.Its a big job but I really want to see a Basque wedding in a pear grove!It could be so good for my rsum!Grace, you have a week.And I can keep the shop open for you on that weekend, if you want me to.Were not going.Half the town is going and my deputy is going to guard the town, Iris said.Grace sank onto the stool at her worktable.Do you think theres any chance Winnie will go for this idea?Whats the alternative?Iris asked.I guess I could fly down to San Francisco a lot.Seventeen  				Ginger started her day at eight that morning and at five she went back to Ray Annes.To her surprise, Ray Anne was there as if waiting for her.She was sitting on the sofa with her laptop open.Ray Anne had stopped by the flower shop in the afternoon to talk with Grace, but Ginger was too busy to say more than a quick hello.She suspected Ray was watching her, making sure she wasnt going to pieces or running to hide.How was your day?Ray Anne asked.Oh, God, it was unbelievable!Tears suddenly ran down Gingers cheeks.The second I walked in, Grace and her friend Iris explained all the complications of the week and how important it was that I get the feel of the shop because they were desperate for help.Iriss mother used to own that shop and Iris started showing me how to make centerpieces and bouquets.She had me watching videos of floral construction right away.Then she helped me do my ownfollowing a pictureand my first two werent so good, but my third was pretty good and she could fix them.A shipment of flowers came in the afternoon.And Graces mother and some man came to see her.I had to constantly clean up, run the register, take ordersbut I could never get them right the first time so I needed help.I had so much trouble pricing them at first.She sniffed.Graces boyfriend brought us lunch that we had to eat in shifts.Iriss husband stopped by three times to see if she needed anything, and Peyton whos marrying the doctor came to check in with Grace about her wedding up near Portland on her familys farm, and I had to learn to write up flower purchase orders, and I think I swept that shop floor more than Ive ever swept in my life.Oh, honey, Ray Anne said sympathetically.Was it just horrible?Huh?she said, and grabbed a tissue to blow her nose.It was wonderful!Wonderful?Ray Anne asked carefully.Its just a little flower shop but it felt like the hub of a big city!I guess word has gotten out that Graces mother is sick, but she didnt look very sick.Shes beautiful and is being chauffeured around with some Russian man who is her escort or something.But people were dropping in all day to check on Grace, ask if theres any way they can help, offering anything she might need and they were so nice to me!And then she broke down and sobbed into her tissue.Ray Anne moved closer to Ginger.She put a hand on her back.Is this normal?To be sobbing because it went well?I dont know, Ginger murmured.She blew her nose again.Now that Im home and sitting down, Im exhausted.And I want my baby, Ray!I want my baby so much.Oh, angel.But I only thought about him a couple of times today because I was so busy.Maybe it was a few times, but I didnt dwell.I usually think about him from the second my eyes open till I close them again at night.I know it seems like such a little thing, but sometimes being busy helps us persevere.Especially if the work feels meaningful.Did it feel meaningful?To the people who chose flowers for special occasions, it means the world to them.Thankfully we didnt make up any funeral flowers.Grace told me if I wanted to go to the wedding to help her, shed be so happy.And I can visit my parents.I can spend a night with them.Do you want to do that, Ginger?Ray Anne asked her.Ginger grabbed Ray Anne and hugged her hard, crying on her shoulder while Ray Anne stroked her back.Will you do me a favor, Ray?If I can, she said.Will you call my mom and ask her to take down the crib?And put away some of those baby things?Ray Anne held her away, looking at her in shock.Ginger, have you had the crib and all those baby things sitting out all this time?For nine months?She nodded and wiped her eyes.I couldnt let go.I dont know if Ill ever be able to get rid of everything.But Im afraid if I go to my folks, even for one night, with all his little stuff sitting around like its ready for him to come back and use it, Ill just spiral downward.Im afraid Ill crawl right back into the bed and stay there forever.Listen to me, Ray Anne said.You will have bad days.You will get emotional and sad and long for little Josh.And youll get through it and move on to the next hour, the next day, the next week.And if I hear youre in bed and cant get up, I will drive up there and get you.She gave her hair a stroke.Dont make me do that.Im very busy right now.I have to get a grip, Ginger said, sniffing.I think maybe I need a shower.And on Sunday Im going to run over to Target and get some nice clothes that arent so expensive for work.I just couldnt make myself change into those baggy old jeans.Thats my girl.I think I fell apart a little bit.Ya think?Ray Anne asked.She gave her a fond pat on the shoulder.I think I better have a glass of wine.You take a shower.* * *  				Troy and Grace were on their way to Bandon to have dinner with Winnie and Mikhail.They were both extremely quiet for the first fifteen minutes.Then Grace reached for his hand and gave it a squeeze.I know you didnt sign on for this.I really appreciate all your support, but I know how stressful and crazy it is.When youve had enough...I understand.Its too much to ask of anyone.He squeezed back.Im not going to bail out on you in the middle of this.We were just dating, seeing where it would go, then the world seemed to explode.Listen, I can do this.I can.I can go with my mother for a few days, get things a little organized, plan how it will go after her...Enough for her to have some peace of mind.Hopefully Ray Anne will find a suitable house and  				And if Winnie rejects that idea?he asked.Then I guess Ill be making some trips to San Francisco to visit her, but my life is here.Im not moving.Not even for six months.The only way well live near each other is if shes willing to move here.She said you have a trust from your father.Are you actually rich?Nah.I have enough to ensure I wont be homeless or hungry.I couldve spent it in one weekend, but Ive taken very good care of it.Could you live off it?The way I live?In one room?For a few years.But I love working.Listen, Im never going to live the way Winnie lives.Do you think Im just saying that?Thats one of the two main reasons we barely spoke for five years.I wouldnt compete anymore and I wouldnt come home to step into that life.Was it hard?I gave it a lot of thought.Im not the first person to disagree with her parents or to reject their lifestyle for my own choice.But what was hard was disappointing my mother, letting her down like that.It made her so angry.I might have made a different decision had I known she only had five years.But as Mikhail would say, die is cast!Im sorry this has landed on your shoulders.Just do what you have to do and when I can help, I will.Thank you, she said quietly.This isnt what I envision my life to beone crisis after another.Gracie, sometimes thats how it is.We cant plan everything.I try.I really try.I like to stay ahead of things, but this...jeez, its insane, thats what it is.Winnie had chosen the same restaurant Troy had met her in last Sunday evening.This time when he approached the matre d he was expected.Mikhail stood when they approached the table.He grabbed Graces face and kissed her on each cheek in his way.Then they sat and ordered drinks while looking at the menu.Your flower shop is very cute, Grace, Winnie said.You must be proud of it.Is perfect!Mikhail said loudly.Grace looked over the top of her menu.All right, who are you and what have you done with my mother?If I understood you, its exactly what you want.Yes?Yes, Grace said.Why are you being so nice to me?Troy grabbed her hand.Gracie, let your mother be nice.Right.Thank you.Troy says were button pushing maniacs.He would be correct, Mikhail said sharply.Where is waiter?We should toast something.I dont know what, but something.We are together.Is good enough.I have an idea, Mother.Why dont I go to San Francisco with you for a few days.You can tell me all the things youre concerned about.We can make decisions about how you want things to be handled, and you can give me the names of agents and lawyers if you feel like it.Then Ill come home.I already have someone looking for a house for you in Coos County so we can be closer to each other.What?I asked a Realtor to look for something nicer than the cottage youre staying in here at the resort, one level with a full kitchen, and I asked for an ocean view.The ocean is beautiful in summer.Its beautiful all year, but we have six months of mild weather ahead.Ill be nearby and can see you all the time.What about my house?My things?Well have Virginia and the housekeeper pack and ship what you want with you.I think I can find a place and have it ready quickly.Lets close up the house.Ill deal with it later.With your instructions and Virginias help, Ill take care of everything, down to the last crystal ashtray.Right now, I want you nearby.I want to spend more time with you if possible.Then come to San Francisco!She calmly shook her head.I dont live there.In fact, with all the traveling you do, you dont even spend six months a year there.Im willing to do anything you saydictate your instructions to whomever you like.If I know you, youve already done so.If you dont like this idea then Ill visit you as often as I can.But Im not going to move to San Francisco.My home is here.But I can move you.I can find you a lovely place and excellent home care professionals if that becomes necessary.Is excellent notion!Mikhail bellowed.We will toast it.Heads turned in the restaurant.Excellent notion?Winnie said.Leave my home for a strange place during the last months of my life?How is this excellent?Grace reached for her hand.Because I dont think I can keep you comfortable in that big drafty urban mini mansion.Its full of stairs, even in your bedroom and bath.The kitchen is a mile from the master bedroom and when you need assistance with things like getting around, bathing, eating...believe me, youre going to want a little less space and no stairs.Remember that little house you rented in Cabo?One story, nice accessible patio, view of the sea from the window?Hardly a prison, Mama.But I think youll be miserable stuck in an upstairs bedroom in San Francisco, tended by servants.She sensed rather than saw Troys head turn to look at her.I dont know...Mama, I want you to be comfortable.I want to be around to be sure...Do you even know anything about this condition?Oh, yes, she said.Ive been up till all hours reading about it every night.I talked to our local doctor about what you might need and if it would all be readily available.She got a little teary.I think this can work, she said softly.Is excellent notion!Mikhail bellowed again.The drinks arrived right as he shouted.We go at once!This can happen.Dont you have a team to coach?Grace asked.I have family emergency.Excuse meI will have lovely Virginia make arrangements, he said, standing.Id like Troy to come, if thats all right.Certainly, Winnie said, leaning her head into her hand.But, Izzy...Grace, I meant Grace, well be busy with family matters.No problem, Mikhail said.I will teach him poker.I know poker, Troy said.Ha.You think you know poker.Is too early to tell!* * *  				Before dinner was over, Virginia had flight arrangements for all of them.They were to meet at the regional airport in North Bend for a two oclock departure the next afternoon.Troy took Grace home and stayed the night.He was holding her after loving her.Are you sure, Troy?You feel okay about going with me?Even though youll miss a couple of days of work?He stroked her hair away from her eyes.I dont know how we can go forward until you try to fix this thing with your mother.Shes not easy, I can see that.But shes your family.And I think if you and your mothers roles were reversed, shed be there for you.As best she could.And maybe not in the exact way you want her to bejust like youbut shed do her best.Probably...And if you were relying on her, youd go to her.Probably.I get real put out with my family sometimes.We have our issues, our fights and standoffs.Then we pull it together.My folks are in their early sixties now, thinking about retirement, and I cant even imagine losing them.He gave her a little kiss on her temple.When we get through some of this craziness, I want you to meet them.I bet theyre very nice people.Youre very nice people, Gracie.I know you must ask yourself how you got into this situation.Oh, I think it was New Years Eve.He chuckled.Im sure you cant come up with any more surprises now.God, I hope not, she said emphatically, then curled up against him and went to sleep.Grace was a little frantic in the morning, trying to figure out how to get everything ready.She wanted to leave the shop in good shape for Iris and Ginger, her loft cleaned up for her return, and she wanted to pack, shower, look presentable when it was time to go.She threw on her jeans from the day before and dashed down to the shop, leaving Troy in her bed once again.To her surprised delight, Iris and Ginger were already in the shop and Ginger had before her a beautiful white centerpiece.Look at you!Grace said.Im getting a little better, but my instructor is right beside me, moving things around, pointing, shaking her head when I choose the wrong stem or stalk, cutting off ends to the right length.I didnt exactly do this alone.But shes catching on, Iris said.In a couple of weeks, shell be re creating some of your stock pieces on her own.Also, Im extremely slow and careful, Ginger said.Iris whips em out in twenty minutes.Iris grew up in this shop.I was helping to make centerpieces and wreaths and bouquets when I was ten.I guess you could say Ive had a little practice.Im leaving at around noon today for a two oclock flight, Grace said.Lets go over the schedule and what you need from me before I leave.Iris, there will be a flower delivery today.The vendor will get here at about two and Ill be gone.Ive done it before, Grace, Iris said.Be sure to give him the order for next Thursday, which includes the flowers for the Lacoumette Grant wedding, and tell him Ill need it before noon.Post a sign that the shop will be closed Monday and Tuesday.Ill be back Tuesday night, open Wednesday.I can open Monday and Tuesday, Ginger said.Dont worry, I wont attempt any extravagant arrangements.If you think it will be slow, I might not even have orders to fill.Ginger and I can make up a few stock arrangements so she has some on hand in the cooler to sell if anyone wanders in.And Ill check in after school on Monday to see if we should make anything up for Tuesday.You guys, she said.Youre so fantastic.We can figure out how to put a sign on the door.When are you headed to Portland for the wedding?Friday morning, first thing.You still want to go, Ginger?She nodded enthusiastically.Are you sure its okay?Are you sure I wont be deadweight?Id love for you to come.Im going to make up a few centerpieces early Friday morning for their Friday night party but Ill transport the rest of my flowers in the back of the van, which is refrigerated.Ill make up the wedding flowers at my old shop in Portland early Saturday.That way if Im missing anything Mamie and Ross can probably help me fill in.Were closing the shop for the wedding.Thats how it rolls for a big out of town affair.Ill be around if you want someone in the shop that Saturday, Iris reminded her.Nah, Grace said.When I took this wedding I made a decisionId close for a couple of days.What I could earn keeping the shop open is more than offset by Peytons wedding.Lets not drive ourselves crazy.I can recommend other florists in the area or take orders for Monday pickup or delivery.Excellent, Iris said.In that case, hand over the store cell phone.Ill take it until youre back.Grace took it off her belt, looked at it and gave it to her.The charger is on my desk.I think Im having separation anxiety already.Just make sure your desk and computer are just as you want themI might have to share them until youre back.Then get out of here, get ready to go.Right, she said, heading for her office.A half hour later she was hauling some of her spring sidewalk displays outside.When she turned, Iris was standing there, tapping her foot, arms crossed over her chest.All right, Iris said.Ginger and I have this.Go.Youre sure?I still have time...Go.If I have a question, which I probably wont, I know your number.Okay.She looked at her watch.Ill be upstairs till noon.Ill stop in to say goodbye.Great.Well be fine.Grace dashed up the stairs and into her loft.Troy was just tugging up and zipping his pants and she grinned.Looks like Im seconds too late.He pulled the zipper down.I have a little time to spare.I should have learned by now, we dont joke around about sex, since youre a sex maniac.Zip those britches, misterI have a lot to do.I want to clean up around here and pack.Im sure you have things to do, too.He tilted his head.Im a guy.My cleaning up and packing will take about fifteen minutes.Thats great, just dont show up here until noon.It takes me longer.Yes, maam, he said, grabbing her around the waist and pulling her close to kiss her.Thanks for last night.Then he let her go and shot out the door.Grace took just a second to savor the moment.It was so nice having a real live boyfriend wanting her and letting her know it.She never in her wildest dreams imagined this could happen to her, especially not with someone as wonderful as Troy.She thought it only happened in novels.She shook herself and got busy.It wouldnt take longthis was like living in an RV and she loved it.She changed her sheets and smoothed the comforter over her bed.Then she opened the suitcase on top of the bed but before she packed her clothes, she scrambled around the little loft.She ran the vacuum she kept in the small broom closet, dusted off her wood furniture, wiped off the table, counters, microwave, fridge and left the cleaner in the bathroom for the sink and mirror.She checked the fridge for food that should be thrown out, packed her charged laptop in her briefcase, and then she started on her clothes.She wasnt taking anything dressy.She folded and packed underwear, a couple of pairs of nice pants, jeans, coordinated tops and a blazer.Shoes were added.She glanced at her watch, proudthere was plenty of time.Shed take a shower, clean the bathroom behind herself and be ready with time to spare.She stepped out of the shower after a nice scrub and shave, dried and moisturized, wrapped herself in a towel and reached under the sink for her makeup.Shed leave her makeup bag, hair dryer, brush and comb, lotion out on the counter so they could go right in her suitcase and  				There it was.Her box of tampons.That hadnt been touched in she wasnt sure how long.And right beside it in a little plastic bag was that pregnancy test Peyton had given her.Just in case...Oh, dear baby Jesus, she said aloud.She sank onto the closed toilet lid.What had happened?Okay, Peyton had suggested the test if her period didnt come.But instead of getting a period, shed gotten a scary note that appeared to be from her stalker.The world tipped.She had been consumed with fear, with protection plans that included using a Taser on her boyfriend.She had been filled with frightening memories of being a fourteen year old girl held captive in a maintenance closet until police could come.Denny and Becca came for a weekend, and Grace skated for them.Her mother made a surprise appearance and...Somewhere in there, with one crisis after another, shed completely forgotten about everything else.She tried counting the weeks since shed had a period and couldnt figure out the exact number.The best thing that could happen would be a negative test result now.She unwrapped the test, read the directions quickly and got ready.And nothing came.Come on, come on, come on, she chanted.She sat and sat and finally, she felt the urge and wet the stick.Then she had to let it sit for a few minutes.She just stared at it.Gradually, after the first minute and a half, a pink shadow began to appear on the yes side.But she stared at it without blinking, because surely it would go away.But no.It was two lines.A red button appeared and the word yes popped up.Grace felt as if she was going to throw up.She sat weakly on the toilet lid.Pregnant, she thought.Crap.Eighteen  				When Troy arrived back at Graces place with his packed bag, he saw that hers was sitting at the foot of the stairs to the loft.Sure enough, he found her in the shop, going over last minute details with Iris and Ginger.If Peyton should come in to check on things, tell her were right on schedule and not to worry about a thing.I think she plans on going to Portland with her sister, Scott to follow with his kids.Even though I wont be here, tell her were good to go, her flowers have been ordered, rest easy.She might not have my personal cell number so you can give it to her if she needs reassurance.Peytons not the jittery sort, Iris said.And I didnt think you were, but you seem to be wound up.Is taking the boyfriend home a little nerve racking?She shook her head.My mother has met Troy, so thats not it.I havent been home in years.In fact, my last four years in competition I was rarely home.I was wherever my coach or the competition was and that was everywhere but home.I seemed to be training in LA or Chicago, only visiting San Francisco when my mother happened to be there.I have no reason to be nervous.Well, if leaving the shop worries you, relax.Even if I really screw up the next four days, your shop will be here when you get home, Iris said.And I promise you, I can keep the place standing.
