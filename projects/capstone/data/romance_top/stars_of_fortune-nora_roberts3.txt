I havent even unpacked.Whats the hurry?Smiling, Bran rose, offered a hand.Its just a walk down the cliff steps.She should unpack, organize her tools, but she found herself putting her hand in his.All right.I want to find some good perspectives to sketch or paint anyway.There, youve found your sensible reason for a walk.I think for the rest of you, adventure and risk come naturally.And you think youre the quiet and settled sort.I am the quiet and settled sort.Not from where Im standing.Youre the most courageous among us.Stunned, she gaped at him as they circled toward the stone wall.Courageous?Me?Where do you get that?The rest of us?We knew what we were after, and why, and why we came here.But you?He walked to the pillars and gate, opened it.You left your home, came all this way, not knowing.And when you saw Riley, you walked right up to her, you risked telling a stranger a story you didnt understand yourself.Thats courage.She looked at him, the dark, compelling eyes, the way the wind blew his hair around his face.And the yearning came back into her, so strong she had to look away.I dont feel brave.You dont recognize your own bravery.Thats all it is.He took her hand again, started down the rough steps.Theyre really steep.And high.But look where theyll take us.I like a fine beach, though I often find myself more drawn to the forests and mountains.What are your mountains?The Blue Ridge.Lovely, are they?Yes.Lovely, and peaceful.I cant think the last time I was at the beach.Anywhere.It can be lovely and peaceful as well.See there, that high point?Her stomach jittered as he gestured toward the promontory.Yes.And the bit of land there, the channel of water between?Its called Canal dAmour, that channel, and its said if you swim there, from one end to the other, youll meet the love of your life.Thats a pretty thought, isnt it?Do you believe in that?Not the swimming part, but the love of your life part?That someoneanyoneloves for a lifetime?Absolutely.So youre a romantic.I wouldnt have thought.My own parents have been married over thirty years, and not just because they have four children and are used to each other.They love and enjoy each other.You have siblings.I do.A brother and two sisters, so my mothers fond of saying, she balanced it all out well with two of each sort.And that was enough of that.Its nice, a big family.A deaf man could have heard the wistfulness, Bran thought.It is, yes.Do you get back to see them?I do, of course, and they travel to me from time to time.Were a noisy bunchnot quiet and peaceful at allwhen were all together.And here we are, at the bottom.Shed barely noticed the rough climb down.You kept me talking so I wouldnt panic.You dont panic so easy.The last step was a drop.Bran jumped down easily, turned to take Sasha by the waist and lift her down.Then stood, testing both of them, with his hands on her.Do you, fidh?She knew the taste and feel of his mouth on hers, the way his hands moved on her skin, the angles of his body under her own.And the need to know all that outside of dreams was far too strong.Maybe, she said, and stepped away.Theres something youre not telling me.I can see it.He tapped a finger between her eyes.Why is that?We all have secrets, and when we find the other two, theyll have them.I guess trust doesnt run deep enough yet.Hardly a wonder in this short a time.Well then, well take what we have.What they had was golden sand and blue water.People, yes, but only a few sunning under the warm spring rays or sitting under the shade of an umbrella.Some children digging with plastic shovels, others wading in the surf.I expect the beaches closer to Sidari are more crowded than this, though, Bran continued.From what Ive read, therell be plenty wholl jump from the seawall into the canal, hoping to find their true love.That would make a fine painting, Id think.The rock, the water, the hopeful who take the leap.Intrigued by the idea, Sasha stopped, looked back.The colors, the textures, the angle of light.A figure, she imagined, poised to leap, another caught on the jump between wall and water.Perhaps one more with speared fingers just meeting the surface.She should have grabbed her sketch pad, then she could  			She saw a flash, something shimmering like jewels in the sunlight sliced out of the water.An instant, an instant only of sparkle and foam, of swirling blue, then gone.Did you see that?See what?In the canal.Something ...It came out of the water, then in again.I didnt see, but I was looking up.It was beautiful, like a sweep of jewels, just glittering in the sunlight.He laid a hand on her shoulder.The stars?No, no, it was sinuous, and alive.The movement.Some sort of fish?A dolphin maybe.He took his hand, fisted it lightly around the hair shed tied back, skimmed it down.Looking for true love.A dolphin.And the idea of a dolphin swimming the canal hoping for love made her smile.It mustve been.It was only a second, but it was gorgeous.With a sigh, she walked again, with the sea air flowing around her.FIVE     			She finally unpacked, and felt shed restored some order to her world.Then she walked out on the terrace to marvel at the view that would be hers for ...as long as it was.She hoped to see the dolphin againit mustve been a dolphin, and the sunlight and water that had given it the illusion of shimmering blues and greens.While shed thought shed sit out with her sketch pad on the terrace, she realized she didnt want solitude.Instead, she took her pad and pencils and went out to look for ...her team.Sawyer had called them thata team.And shed never been a part of one before.It felt good, even oddly comforting.Remembering, as part of that team, she was likely in charge of dinner, she went to the kitchen first to consider her options.She wished she knew how to make some traditional Greek meal, but failing that, she could do a pasta dish she often made herself at home, as it was quick and easy, and it appeared she had everything she needed at hand.Logically shed quadruple what she normally did, but that didnt take into account two of the four were men, and Riley ate like a starving wolf.So just make a lot, Sasha told herself.And it if didnt work, well, someone else could be in charge of the kitchen.She stepped outside, just breathed in, wondered if shed be allowed to cut some flowers for her room, for the house.She recognized lemon trees as the yellow fruit basked in the sun, and the dusky leaves of the olive, the orange trees.But others were beyond her, including the cactus with large flat leaves and gorgeous blooms.She took a moment to sketch one, then wandered on, past the vegetable garden, the coop where chickens clucked and pecked in their little fenced yard.Past shrubs of rosemary, toward the pool where she saw Riley and Sawyer in what appeared to be an animated conversation as they sat facing each other on white padded chaise lounges.The big white dog sprawled under the shade of Rileys chair and slept.Sawyer wore cutoffs and a golden tan, and Riley a red tank style bathing suit.Still talking, Riley waved at her, gestured to come on out.Were debating Khan.Genghis Khan?No.Khan Noonien Singh.I dont know who that wasis.Star Trek.Oh.I saw the movie.The, as in singular?Which one?Riley demanded.Im not sure.It was on cable.On a sigh, Riley patted the space beside her.Girl needs an education.Want a beer?Sawyer gestured toward a wide stone table Sasha saw held a barbecue pit.Theres a fridge back there.We stocked it from the kitchen.No, Im fine.Its wonderful out here, but it feels too cool yet for swimming.Not for hardy souls, right, Sawyer?Plus its solar heated.She angled her head to look at the sketch.Prickly pear.Is that what it is?Yeah.It should fruit in a couple months.What do they taste like?Mmm.Watermelon, sort of.Sasha let out a quick laugh.Watermelon on a cactus.As strange as mythical stars.I saw a dolphinI thinkin the water.In what Bran said they call Canal dAmour.Going for a swim to look for your one true love?With a quick smirk, Riley lifted her beer.I dont think so, but I may paint it.Might be fun to try itthe swim, Sawyer explained.We mate for life in my family, so maybe Id run into her.Huh.Same with mine.They mate for life.Which is why, Riley said definitely, I wouldnt risk the swim.I find my mate, thats it.No more playing around.She rose, stretched.What about you, Sash?The field or the goalposts?What?Playing the field or the touchdown with love?Sawyer interpreted.I ...She saw Bran, in black trunks and white unbuttoned shirt, crossing the lawn.Hearts did skip beats, she thought.It wasnt just a clich.I dont really think about it.Everybody thinks about it, Riley claimed.Im going back in.She dove off the side, surfaced sleek as a seal, then rolled to float.Hey, Irish, waters good.Take advantage.Well be hunting and scouting and digging before much longer.Youre right about that.And not much time for a beer by the pool.Sawyer set his down.Im on pool maintenance, unless you want it.Its all yours.As Sawyer jumped in with Riley, Bran shrugged out of his shirt.Cant swim?Of course I can swim.Good.He plucked her right up.Her utterly shocked Dont!had Apollo bellying out to dance and bark.Do!Riley shouted as Sasha tried to wiggle free.Dare you.Oh, well then, she dared me.This isnt funny.Just  			Whatever shed started to say ended on a scream as he got a running start and jumped in with her.She surfaced, sputtered.Its pretty funny, Sawyer said.With no choice, Sasha tread water.Its cold!Youre just not used to it yet.To help her along with that, Bran went under, and pulled her with him.Better?he asked when she came up again.What are you, twelve?The man who loses the boy is a sad and serious man.Irish philosophy?Sasha responded to it by shoving the heel of her hand through the water, and sending it into his face.Then she just sank down because it was pretty nice after all.* * *  			Her pasta dish turned out well, if she did say so herself.She might not want to be responsible for planning and cooking meals routinely, but there was some satisfaction in seeing the enormous amount shed made vanish down to a small container of leftovers.They didnt talk of the stars until Riley broke out a bottle of limoncello.I did lunch, Sasha did dinnerand kudos on thatso Id say you boys are on cleanup.Seems fair, and well deal with that, Bran said.But Id say its time we knuckled down a bit and got serious about why were all here.But were not all here, Sasha pointed out.Until we are, I dont think we stand much of a chance of finding anything.Doesnt mean we cant scout the area, Riley pointed out.Ive got some maps, and some ideas on that.Standing stills doing nothing, Bran pointed out.If we hadnt been moving forward, we might not have met Sawyer.And now were four.Like I said, this is the first time Ive looked with a team, and the first time Ive really felt close.Sawyer studied the liquid in his shot glass, then knocked it back.Nice kick.A couple of good meals, a few hours by the pool, and a kick ass roof over my head, thats all pretty great.But you dont find without looking.You got it.Riley tossed back her shot as well, poured herself and Sawyer a second.So I say we break out the maps first thing in the morning, make a plan, and pull on our hiking boots.She toasted with her drink.Time for some spelunking.Noting Sashas expression, Bran gave her hand a pat.Are you claustrophobic then?Not so far, but then Ive never spent any time in caves.But I know caves make me think of bats.Bats are enormously cool, Riley told her.And contrary to popular belief, arent blind.And dont go for your hair.She uses the form, twisting it to her needs.And the dark is hers.The dank and shadowy places, and what lives there she rules.Banished from the light, she craves it, and covets the flame.The light to extinguish, and the flame to burn until theres nothing but the dark, and ashes.Her eyes cleared, and her breath came back with a force that burned her throat.Okay, wow.Are you all right?Sawyer asked her.Shell be fine.Bran spoke sharply as he gripped Sashas hand.Look at me.Look at me now, and listen.Youre still trying to block it, and so when it comes it gives you pain.You have to stop mistrusting yourself and your gift.I dont want it.Well, you have it, dont you, so steady up.Hey, Sawyer began, as Brans tone was harsh, and Sasha pale.But Riley shook her head, warned him off.You dont know what its like to have something in you that takes you over.And you dont know what its like to embrace it, to learn to use it instead of trying to deny it so it uses you.My own father walked away because he couldnt live with it, with me.Every time Ive tried to get close to anyone, this gift has pushed through and ruined it, so I have no one.You have us.And we wont be walking away.He spoke briskly, without a hint of sympathy.But its you who does the walking, from what I can see.Away from yourself.We wouldnt be here if I hadnt come.Now thats exactly right.You should think about that, deal with that instead of weeping over what brought you.Too shocked and angry for words, Sasha shoved away from the table and walked away.You might go after her, Bran said to Riley.See that she takes something for the headache shes brought on herself.Yeah.She rose.Take a swipe at me like that?I hit back.You might be the one to teach her to do the same.Maybe I am.When she walked off, Sawyer shook his head.That was harsh, man.I know it.And left him with a hint of a headache himself.Its harsher yet, to my mind, for her to make herself ill.We are what we are, dont you think, mate?Sawyer considered his second shot.For some, maybe most of some, being different from everybody else is tough.Is it?Bran smiled, lifted his own glass.I find being unique is something to celebrate and respect.Until she does, what she has only hurts her.He turned the little glass of limoncello in his fingers, drank it.Wed best clean this up, and do it right, or well be unlikely to get another meal out of her.She matters to you, beyond what she is, and what were after.With considerable care, Bran set the little glass down again.Shes a beautiful woman with a damaged heart and a bright courage she doesnt recognize.Yes, she matters, beyond, or I wouldnt have spoken to her as I did.Okay then.Once theyd dealt with the dishes, set the kitchen to rights, Bran went outside, did a couple of circuits around the house.A kind of border patrol, he thought.But he saw nothing but moon and stars and sea, heard no whispering of bat wings, only the rush of water against land and rock.Pausing, he looked up at Sashas room, saw it was dark, her terrace doors closed.He hoped she slept, and peacefully.And hoped to Christ she didnt come knocking on his door in the night looking beautiful and dreamy.It had been one thing to share her bed, in sleep, the night before.But he accepted doing so again would severely test his will.She was far too appealing, in all manner of ways.He considered options, discarded them.And knowing sleep wouldnt come calling soon, he went back in.There was work he could do while the others slept.* * *  			Sawyer sent long, detailed emails home as he did whenever he was able.He tried reading, gave it up, and tried to work.But he was far too restless.A walk on the beach, he decided.Alone.For a man who enjoyed companionship, he was often alone and knew how to occupy himself and his mind.He pulled on a jacket, as the night was cool, went out through the terrace doors and down.He could appreciate the fragrance in the air, the way the clouds sailed over stars and moon, the steady heartbeat of the sea.And could be grateful those clouds were thin, and the moon bright enough to light the cliff steps.He considered his companions, as hed written about them.Riley, sharp, solid, and smart.A traveler, somewhat like him, and a woman who could handle herself.A scholar, but far from fusty.They shared a passionate attachment to science fiction, fantasy, and graphic novels.Bran?Clever, charming when he wanted to be, and plenty mysterious.Protective.He mightve been hard on Sasha after dinner, but hed been truthful when hed said she mattered.Sawyer sensed Bran would do whatever needed to be done to protect someone who mattered.And Sasha.Talentedgiftedand conflicted.Unsure of her footing, but she still walked the walk.So hed give Bran points for insight.She had courage she didnt recognize.And, Sawyer thought, was certainly the magnet that had drawn them all together.He wasnt entirely sure where he fit.After ten years of traveling, he could tell them where the stars werent.But the world was a very big place.He had theories, and hed come to them through trial, error, and experience.Having someone like Sasha should give them better direction.Maybe.The other two?They had secrets.But then again, so did he.A few hours, some drinks, and a couple of meals together didnt build the sort of trust it took to share secrets.He wasnt sure, yet, what would.So, it was wait and see.He liked the deserted beach, the moonlight floating on the water, the whoosh and whisper of waves.Those waves tempted him to take a quick swim.Hed freeze his ass off, but it might finish clearing his head so he could sleep.He decided to walk back, and if the urge was still there, strip down and dive incloser to the cliff steps, the house, and the warmth.And he saw her, standing on the edge of sea and shore.She looked out at the water, the thin white dress she wore swirling around her knees in the night wind.What seemed like miles of dark hair tumbled down her back.The sketch, he thought.Sashas sketch, alive and in person.He shouldnt have wondered, but he did.Shouldnt have been surprised, but he was.He started up the beach toward her, kept his eyes on her in case she vanished like a dream.Instead, she turned toward him, and he saw her face in the splashing moonlight.One of the six in the sketches, one who had stood beside him in the first sketch theyd shown him on the side of the road.A face made out of dreams, he thought as she smiled and walked toward him.Stunning.Beyond beautiful.Wide eyes tipped just a bit at the corners, a wide, full mouth curved now in what seemed to be both delight and welcome.Skin that looked soft, smooth, and pale gold in the moonlight.Tall and willowy in a thin white dress that flowed in the breeze.He stopped a foot away from her because with all hed seen, all hed experienced, hed never looked on anything like her.She said, Hello, with a hint of a laugh on the word.Yeah, hi.Where did you come from?Ive been here, for a little while.And you came.Reaching out, she took his hand.I hoped you would.Do you know me?She only smiled.I dont know your name.Sawyer.Sawyer.She repeated it, carefully.My name is Annika.I come I came, she corrected, to help you find the stars.Will you take me with you?Just like that, he thought.Yeah, I think Id better.Were up there.He pointed up to the villa, whereas in the sketcha single light glowed.I have some things.Where?Ill get them.She ran up the beach, the movements almost like a dance, then with a swirl of white dress and long dark hair, she disappeared behind the rocks.Wait.Shit.He ran after her, cursing himself for being so dumbfounded hed frozen.But she came out again, carrying two large bags.Not luggage, exactly, he noted, but two sacks, he supposed, both brightly patterned with trees, flowers, birds, and secured with the sort of clasps you might see on treasure chests.Let me get those.You take one, I take one, and the weight is half.The steps are wonderful!With her one bag, she raced for them.They go so high.Well be closer to the sky.Be careful, theyre steep.Someone always says be careful.She beamed at him as they started up.Annika, you are too reckless.But I dont think so.I only want to try everything.Not reckless, he thought, going off with some strange guy in the middle of the night?If not reckless, then way too trusting.Oh.At the top of the steps she paused, laid a hand on her heart.This is home for you?Its very beautiful.Its borrowed.I mean were just staying here for a while.I can smell the flowers.She trailed her hand along flowering shrubs.And the trees, and the grass.Look at this.She stopped to trail her fingers over a low hanging lemon.Its so cool and smooth.A lot of lemon trees around here.Lemon, she repeated, as she had his name.I didnt bring a key, so well go around and up the back.She looked at everything as they walked, went up the terrace steps with him without protest.Since the light remained on in Brans room, Sawyer gave a rap on the terrace doors.Still in his jeans and T shirt, Bran opened one of the doors.Look who I found.Hello.Annika smiled at him.Annika, this is Bran Killian.Brankillian, hello.Happy to meet you, Annika.I like happy.Sure and who doesnt?Best take her downthe kitchen, I guess, as this may call for either wine or coffee.Ill get the others.I like wine, she said as Sawyer led her down the terrace toward his open doors.Will I have some?Yeah, were loaded.Oh, this is very pretty.All the pictures and the little things.And the bed.Is the bed soft?She dropped her bag and sat on the side of it, bounced, then flopped back, arms spread.It is!She flung her arms back over her head, wiggled down.The gesture went straight to his loins.Down boy, he ordered.We should go on down.Down?She sat up, and for the first time looked distressed.Downstairs, he explained.So you can meet the others.The others, yes.She bounced off the bed, offered her hand.He led her out, started down the stairs while she tried to look at everything at once.I had the same reaction when I first got here.Its a hell of a place.Hell of a place, she repeated, her tone awed.When they got to the kitchen, she released his hand, ran hers over the refrigerator.It shines.After tugging on the handle, she let out a long ahh.Are you hungry?Yes!Its very cold inside.Professional grade.Weve got some pasta left over from dinner.Its good stuff.He pulled out the container.Go ahead and sit down.Ill heat it up.Thank you very much.She sat at the table, running her fingers over the top.This is very pretty, too.Everything is.She watched him dump the pasta onto a plate, stick the plate in a microwave, punch buttons.Before she could speak, the others came in, so she said, Hello.And then there were five, Riley said.Annika?Yes!Hello.Riley reached in the wine fridge.I guess this calls for a bottle.Riley.Riley Gwin.Whats the rest of yours?The rest of mine?Name.Your full name?After a long beat of silence, Riley dug out the corkscrew.As in first and last.Riley, first name, Gwin, last name.And we have Sasha.Riggs.Studying the newcomer, Sasha selected wineglasses.And you met Bran.And Sawyer.Annika beamed at him.King.Her eyes went huge, her voice dropped to a reverent whisper.Youre a king?As Riley snorted, Sawyer looked into those wide eyes, sea green, flecked with gold.My last names King.Im Annika, first name ...Waters, last name.Annika Waters, she said more definitely.Hello.I think shes a little high, Riley said to Bran in an undertone.We climbed the steps to the house.Its very high.Good ears.You been doing some drugs, Annika?No.Am I supposed to?No.Sasha sat across from her, set the portfolio on the table.Where are you from?Myfamilywe go many places.Originally?Where were you born?I dont know.I was only a baby.Laughing now, Sawyer set the plate in front of Annika.Got you there, Sasha.Annika picked up the fork, turned it to study, and very carefully stabbed a piece of penne.She slipped it into her mouth, then pressed her hands to her lips as she laughed.Warm.She speared a piece of cherry tomato, then a black olive.Closed her eyes a moment as she ate, then opened them, and ate more.Its good stuff, she said.She lifted the glass Riley had given her, sipped.Its good stuff, she repeated.I like wine, and this food.Thank you.Youre welcome.Sasha opened the portfolio, took out the sketch of all six, then slid it across the table.Annika let out a delighted gasp, traced her finger over her own face, then Sawyers.Its a picture.This is I, and this is Sawyer.Riley, Sasha, Brankillian.Bran, she corrected.Everyone is so pretty!But this one isnt here?No.Where is he?We dont know.Do you know him?She shook her head.I like my hat.Where did I get it?Rolling her eyes, Riley sat.Why are you here?Sawyer brought me.No, Annika, why are you here, on Corfu.Why did you come with Sawyer?Because Sawyer is ...the one who came.Im here to help find the stars.You know about the Stars of Fortune?Bran asked.Yes, everyone does.Everyone?Riley demanded.In my ...family.And the one who reads fates told me I would help find them.If I was She broke off, ate more pasta.Willing.Its a search.Thats not the word, but like it.Its a ...She circled a finger in the air.Qu qu   			Quest?Bran suggested.Yes!Thank you.Its a quest of danger, so I must be willing.I am.I came.They must be found, and taken back.Taken back?Riley repeated.Where?Annika blinked in surprise.Why, to the Island of Glass.Thats a myth.Im apology.A mist?Myth.A fable, Riley added.Usually a traditional story regarding the history of a people, and often containing supernatural beings.I like stories.May I have more wine?Ive never heard of this.Sasha looked around.I can see everyone else has.What is the Island of Glass?A mythical island that appears when and where it wills, Bran told her.A place out of time.A world to itself.Like Brigadoon?No.Riley shook her head.Brigadoon appeared every one hundred years like clockwork, same place.While in Brigadoon only a day would pass.I like a good mythobviouslyand there are a lot of great stories built around the Island of Glass.But it doesnt exist.It is real.And it is always there, but only a few have seen it, only a few have been allowed.The one who reads the fates does not lie.When we find the three stars, we must take them back to the place they were born.Youre saying the stars were created on the Island of Glass.Riley narrowed her eyes.Yes.By the goddesses three.Celene, Luna, Arianrhod, as gifts for the new queen, who is Aegle, the radiant.Riley leaned back, drummed her fingers.Where did you study?I studied very hard.Annikas face lit like the sun.Many places.I like to learn new things, and old things, and all things.Whos Nerezza?You should not speak her name in the night.Annika looked toward the windows.Or risk summoning her.Bunk.Who is she?She is the dark one, the mother of lies.She must never have the stars.I dont like to fight, but I would fight with you to keep them from her.We are together.She pointed to the sketch.And you are Sawyers friends, so you are mine.Just like that?You are very curious.Annika leaned toward Riley.I am very curious, too.So we will be friends.And I will help.This has been foretold.Riley glanced at Sasha.I cant piss on foretelling.But well see what we see.How  			Riley, Sawyer interrupted.Give it a rest.Do you have any questions, Annika?I have so many.My mother says Im made of questions.But its enough to be here for now.Im very tired.Can I sleep in the soft bed?Still a couple to pick from.Ill take you up, and you can decide which room you want.I wont sleep in your bed?What?No.Sawyer caught Brans amused look, rubbed the back of his neck.Everybody gets their own room.Ill take her up.Riley rose.Since were going to be friends.Thank you.And thank you for the good stuff and the wine.After Riley took her out, Sawyer lifted his arms.She was just there, standing on the beach.Like in the sketch.Just there.And now shes here.Bran looked at Sasha.What did you read?Joy.So much joy I nearly burst with it myself.And an incredible sweetness.Is she holding something back?Yes, Im sure she is.But everything she said about the stars, about this island, she believes is truth.Clearly English isnt her first language, Bran speculated.But if she needs to keep where shes from to herself for now, its a small thing.He picked up the sketch.Shes meant to be here, with us, and so she is.Five down, Sawyer said, one to go.Lets hope the one to go waits at least until morning.I want some sleep.Bran turned to Sasha.Youre tired yourself.Im not used to introductions and powwows at nearly two in the morning.Ill wash this up.Sawyer picked up the plate.Go ahead.Im right behind you.Bran took Sashas hand as they walked out and, testing, brought it to his lips.Not angry anymore?Oh, Im still angry.I can put it aside for the big picture.I get angry myself when I see you making yourself sick.Its my problem, my business.He flicked a nosegay of lavender out of the air, handed it to her at her door.Magic flower tricks dont charm me.They do.But more important, youre my problem and my business now as well.Cupping a hand behind her head, he pulled her in, took her mouth in a quick, warm warning of a kiss.Youll have to deal with that as well.Good night, fidh.She stepped quickly into her room, shut the door before she did something insane like pull him inside with her.It hadnt been a lovers kiss, she told herself, as she traced a finger over her own lips.Not brotherly either.It was more ...making a point.Thats what she needed to remember.He wasnt attracted to her.They were teammates, and he was trying to keep her in line.Well, shed keep herself in line.But she slept with the lavender on her pillow, and slept without dreams.SIX     			Sasha awakened to sun diamonds sparkling on blue water, and wondered at the turn her life had taken.Whatever came after, moments like this offered wild beauty.The idea of setting up her easel, trying to interpret that beauty on canvas had her pushing up in bed.Until she remembered she was part of a team, and the team had an agenda.A team of five now, she thought, with the addition of the gorgeous and quirky Annika Waters.She lifted the little nosegay from her pillow, held it to her nose.Immediately she was thrown back into that brief kiss, felt the warmth, the light pressure on her lips.A team, she reminded herself.Not a romance, but a mission.Though shed do her duty, she gave herself the pleasure of throwing open her terrace doors, stepping out into that wild beauty.She smelled fruit and flowers and sea, gave herself the assignment of finding a watering can so she could tend the terrace pots, all filled with spearing and tumbling flowers in breathlessly hot colors.She leaned on the iron railing, scanned the empty beach, then saw Annika topping the cliff steps.She wore a pink dress today, pale and pretty with a skirt that floated around her thighs as she started across the grass in bare feet.She paused every few feet to sniff flowers, stroke leaves.When she looked up, saw Sasha, she beamed a smile, waved.Hello!Good morning.Youre up and around early.I dont want to miss things, and I needed to swim.In what?Sasha nearly asked, then decided it wasnt her business.Everyone was sleeping, but youre awake now.Yes, I am.Im just going to get a shower and dress.Ill be down soon.Sasha basked in the shower, wondered what it would take to have body jets installed in her shower at homeand thought whatever it took, it would be worth it.Considering the agenda, she put on jeans, a tank, and a camp shirt, then laced up her hiking boots.She reordered her pack, lightening her load.And though it embarrassed her, even with no one to see, she took a sprig of lavender from the clutch and pressed it between the pages of the journal shed bought for the journey.Muttering at herself, she banded her hair back in a tail, and went downstairs.She heard voices as she approached the kitchen, and caught the morning scents of coffee and bacon.Bran said hed take breakfast, she remembered, and put on the casual smile shed practiced in the mirror.She walked in to see Annika frowning down at a mug of coffee.Why doesnt it taste the way it smells?Too strong, is it?I dont see the use of coffee unless its strong enough to stand up and dance, so Ive a habit of brewing it that way.Bran stood at the stove, scooping bacon from the frying pan with a fork, tossing it onto a plate covered with paper towels.Casual, Sasha thought, and strolled in.The stronger the better.Annika turned, held out the mug.You would like it?Thanks.Theres juice in the fridge if youd rather.At Annikas blank smile, Sasha walked over, got out the pitcher.Then, as the woman seemed so pleasantly helpless, a glass.Annika took a testing sip.Oh!This is very nice.I like it much more than the coffee.Im apology, Bran.Sorry.Youre sorry, he corrected.And no need to be.When did you learn English?Keeping it casual, Sasha leaned back against the counter.English?The language.Oh.I know this one and some others.But sometimes the words are wrong.You can tell me when they are, and I can learn.Can you cook, like Bran?I can cook.You can teach me.It looks fun and smells nice.Sure, I guess.But for now, maybe you could set the table.Annika pointed.The table.The one outside.We could have breakfast outside, on the patio.So you could set that table.Where should I set it?With a laugh, Sasha put her coffee aside.You could put the plates, the flatware, the napkins out.Were five, she said and chose five plates from the cabinet.So five plates, five sets of flatware.She opened a drawer.And the napkins are in the top drawer of that breakfront.I can set the table.Annika rattled around in the silverware drawer, counting under her breath.When she had her supplies, carried them out, Sasha turned to Bran.She never answered the question.Evaded it, charmingly.He scooped potatoes hed chipped and boiled out of the pot with a slotted spoon, dumped them in the frying pan.Grease snapped and sizzled.Shes clever.Part of me wants to pin her down, and the other part wants to watch it all evolve.I know theres no harm in her.Then the evolution might be more interesting.How did you sleep?Fine.In fact, great.You?The same.To keep busy, Sasha unwrapped the secondand lastround of bread, began to slice some for toast.It looks like itll be a good day for hiking, though if were going to be exploring caves I guess it doesnt matter much.I didnt pack a flashlightnever thought of it, but  			The knife clattered on the table as Bran spun her around.What  			Last night wasnt enough.His mouth took hers.Then came the whirlwind.Not the almost brotherly brush of lips, but a long, deep possession that spun everything she was into greed and need.For an instant, the storm blew in, all whipping wind, roaring thunder, and that bold, bright flash of lightning.She wanted to leap into it, ride it, no matter where it took her.But the risk, and the pain.She already knew the pain, knew it could shatter her beyond repair.She pressed a hand to his chest, and he gave her a breath.His eyesand she swore she saw worlds, wild worlds, swirling behind themlocked on hers.Were a team, she managed, and the hot, dangerous glint shifted into what might have been humor.That we are, fidh, but youre the only one I want for this.He lifted her to her toes and took her again.He hadnt been able to pry her out of his mind, to drain this singular desire out of his blood.There were countless reasons he should resist, to keep her as friend and teammate only.And only one reason to ignore all the rest.That simple touch of lips the night before had lit something in him.He wanted to see how hot it might burn.And she called to him, her wounded and courageous heart.Surely there was purpose there.But beyond purpose, beyond reason, the fire burned.Oh, hell.He eased back at Rileys voice, but kept his eyes on Sashas as Riley wandered in, Apollo happily at her heels.I figured youd circle around that for at least another day or two.She went straight to the coffee, grabbed a mug.If you want privacy, try one of the bedrooms.She poured her coffee, all but inhaled the first sip.Ill take the dogthe care and feeding thereof.And I nominate the new girl for chicken duty.Beginning after coffee.Whens breakfast?Shortly.Bran ran his hands down from Sashas shoulders, along her arms, then stepped back to the stove to put the pan hed had the wit to take off the flame back again.Good.Starved.I ...need a watering can.Sasha turned quickly, aimed for the doors.Riley shook her head at Bran, then a long glance at the dog sent Apollo trotting outside.Office romances, Irish, sticky business and usually get somebody fired.Lucky then, isnt it, were not being paid.He gave the potatoes a turn.Sasha doubted the morning air would cool her skin, her blood, but she needed a moment just to stand in it, try to settle.What should she do now?How did she behave now?Hed changed everything.Or no, she admitted, hed pushed it along the path.She looked over at the promontory, thought of the storm.Apollo brushed up to her, nuzzled his great head under her hand.After her absent stroke, he raced off.She needed to focus, Sasha warned herself.To concentrate on what needed to be done, not what she wished could be.Others depended on her keeping her balance, so  			She glanced over at the sound of laughter, watched Annika run in circles with the dog.She twirled, executing three very impressive cartwheels that had the dog letting out deep, joyful barks.Sasha couldnt stop the smile, and couldnt stop the wish she could be just that free, just that carelessly happy shed turn cartwheels on soft spring grass.With a sigh, she turned toward the table.Stopped dead.The plates fashioned a towerfour balanced on their rims holding the fifth, with a glass filled with wildflowers atop it.Shed balanced the flatware as well, crossing pieces like swords to form a kind of arbor, and under it grass, clover, buttercups twined together.A shrubbery, Sasha realized, fascinated and charmed.Shed draped napkins around the tall salt and pepper mills, like capes, and formed more grass into crowns to top them.Other napkins flowed outbright blue.The sea, Sasha thought.Glowing from her game with Apollo, Annika ran back.I set the table.I see.Its wonderful.A castle by the sea.The rulers are giants, Annika began.Sawyer!There was a joylike cartwheelsin the single word.Yeah, morning.He came out barefoot, gulping coffee, then studied the table presentation.Wow.Do you like it?Very cool.Breakfasts up, Riley announced, carrying out a platter loaded with bacon, eggs, potatoes, toast.She set it down, studied Annikas work.Nice.Bran followed her out with the pitcher of juice, a pot of coffee.They all stood, studying the castle.Is it wrong?Annika asked.Not at all, Bran told her.In fact its lovely and fun.Were all wishing we didnt have to take it down so we can eat.Oh, I can make another.The food smells good.Okay.Riley rubbed her hands together.Lets sack the castle.Once theyd set the table in a more mundane fashion and passed around the platter, Riley turned to the dog, who sat, watching hopefully.Thats yours, she told him, pointing to the bowl of kibble shed set out.He heaved a sigh filled with disappointment, but moved off to eat.So, well look over the maps, but my best sense is to head south, follow the river into the hills.My intel says theres a cave up there, multichambered, largely unexplored.The locals call it Anasa tou Diavolou.The Devils Breath.Sounds promising, she added, forking up some eggs.What about underwater caves?Sasha began, and Riley nodded as she ate.Got some on my list.But were going to need a boat, some gear.Im working on that.Anybody know how to handle a boat?Im okay with it, but Im better with a canoe or a kayak.Depends on the boat, Sawyer put in.What sort of gear?Sasha wanted to know.Snorkeling for certain, scuba most likely.Ive never done any scuba diving.Weve got a pool to practice in if we need to.Im certifiedor was.Probably still am.Riley shrugged.Maybe well get lucky on land.In any case, well eliminate areas, and get some scuba practice in.She gestured at Annika with her fork.That dress isnt going to work for the sort of hiking well do today.You dont like it?Looks good on you, but you need pants.Jeans or cargoes to protect your legs.A jacket, a hat, a backpack.And hiking boots.I dont have those things.I was afraid of that.Riley looked under the table at Annikas bare feet.Ive got spare boots, but your feet are longer than mine.Looks like a trip into the village to outfit her, Sawyer said.It shouldnt take long.Been on many shopping trips with women, mate?Bran asked him.Shopping.Annika bounced in her chair.You buy things.I have coins.No trouble understanding how shopping works, Bran added.Coins?I have many coins.Ill get them.When she raced off, Riley turned, jabbed her fork toward Bran.Youll eat that insult to my species, Irish.I can get her outfitted inside twenty minutes.Bet you a fiver you cant.Done.So into the village, deal with that.We can drive south from there for the first ten, twelve kilometers, but were off road after that.Id like a look at your maps, if its all the same to you, before we head out.Sawyer nodded at Bran, then Riley.Im going to second that.No problem.Nothing to say on this, Sasha?Im still stuck on Devils Breath.Anyway, I can read a map well enough, but Im pretty sure one cave will strike me the same as any other.Annika came back, hauling a royal blue drawstring bag with gold braiding.She set it on the table with a little oof, where it thudded heavily.My coins.She meant it literally.On a laugh, Sawyer got up to walk to the end of the table, look into the bag.Yobanny v rot!What are those words?Annika demanded.Its Russian.Riley got up herself to circle around, looked into the bag.And to borrow a phrase.Yobanny v rot.Mind?she said to Annika, and without waiting for an answer, tipped the bag onto the table so part of the contents poured out.Gold coins and silver, copper and bronze.Many, even with her untrained eye, Sasha recognized as old.Possibly ancient.We have here a lot of euros, Riley began, your pounds, punts, lire, drachma, yen, ducats, francsSwiss and FrenchU.S.  and Canadian coins, halfpennies, and yo ho ho, me hearties, your pieces of eight.Pirate coins?The notion had Sasha getting up for a closer look.Like this?Yeah, a reasonable shitload of them, from what I see.Theyd be worth about a hundred bucks each.Each.Sasha turned the oddly shaped coin in her hand.Each, if theyre in decent condition and the inscriptions legible, like the one youre holding.And this?Riley did a butt wiggle.This is a Carlos and Johanna.Gold doubloon, stamped 1521.A collector would pay a grand easy for this.She poked through more as Annika stood back smiling in delight.Hell of a collection here, Riley muttered.And you shouldnt keep it in a sack like this.Christ, this is a silver tetradrachm, circa 420 BC, probably worth a few thousand easy.And ...Gamoto.Greek for holy shit.She held up a gold coin.Do you have a clue what this is?she demanded of Annika.A coin.See this guy on here, the one wearing the laurel?See this name?This is Augustus Caesar, founder of the Roman Empire.And this cow on the backits a heifer.This coin?It was made somewhere between 27 and 18 B fucking C.  Its worth millions.Of dollars?Sawyer managed.There are only a handful of these known to exist.One went up for auction a couple years back.Went for, I think it was about fifteen, and yeah, brother, thats freaking million.It will buy hiking boots.Riley stared at Annika as if shed grown gossamer wings.You could buy a small third world country with whats in this sack, and Ive only skimmed over a part of it.Where the hell did you get this?She shook the gold coin.I found it.You ...found it.Yes.Its fun to find things, and I like pretty things.Do you like it?I freaking love it.You can have it.Say what?You can keep it.A gift.Seeing Sawyer about to speak, Riley held up a finger.Youre going to just give it to me.You like it, so a gift.For a friend.Riley, you cant  			She cut Sawyer off with a look.What do you take me for?Can I have another one instead?One you like better?Yes, you pick.Everyone should pick one, the one they like better.Id like this.Riley picked an old drachma.Ten, maybe fifteen bucks, she told Sawyer.Im going to keep it with me, for good luck.Thanks.Youre welcome.Sawyer, you pick!You came for me.Pick something pretty.He kept it simple, picked out a U. S.  quarter.
