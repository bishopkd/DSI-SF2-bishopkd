Then why?Why the phone number thing?After, she said.Well talk when theres less distraction.Good idea, he said, lifting her into his arms.He carried her into the tiny living room, eyed the couch and moved on past it to the bed.He set her down gently, sitting down beside her to kick off his shoes, get rid of his belt and shirt, then turned to take her into his arms again, delivering kisses that were hot and strong.He slid the straps of her dress down over her shoulders, pulled it down and kissed her breasts for a long time.She held his head there, his mouth sucking gently, then not so gently.She turned into soup.She felt the hot and molten passion inside her flow through her until she was almost aching for him.And that made her squirm.She pulled him down on the bed and reached for his jeans, struggling to find the snap or button or zipper but after a moment of that, he stilled her hands.Easy, he said.Ive got it.I thought it would be slow, she said with a shade of embarrassment.He pulled condoms out of his pocket before tossing the jeans aside.Itll be slow next time, he promised.Right now I think I should take care of you.Orgasm.He laughed.Great icebreaker.Her dress came down to her waist, up to her waist, and there she was with a whole bunch of clothing around her waist while everything above and below lay bare to his hungry eyes.Aw, Ginger, I love those little panties.I think Ill take them off.With my teeth.No teeth!she said, laughing.Okay, no teeth, he said.They were white lace, fitting around her hips.He tugged them down and said, Well now.Natural blonde, she confirmed.He got out of his boxers fast.He suited up right away, leaving nothing to chance, then he lay down beside her, brought her into his arms and, kissing her, his hands explored her whole body from her knees to her neck.Finally, frustrated by the cumbersome folds of that discarded sundress, he tugged it lower, down her legs and off.He tossed it.His hands on her were much freer and deeper, and she pushed at him with her hips, so ready.But it was when she tried to close her legs against the pressure of his hand on her that he stopped.He looked into her eyes and said, Uh uh.No.He pushed her legs apart once more and put himself there.Lets do this the old fashioned way.You want to come, dont you, my love?She squeezed her eyes closed and just nodded.Good idea, he whispered.You first.He entered her slowly, watching her face the whole time.Perfect, he said.Perfect.Then he began to move, creatively at first, listening for the response that said hed found the sweet spot.There was only the slightest whimper but she held his shoulders in a death grip and inhaled sharply.Her heels dug into the bed and she pushed against him.There it is, he whispered against her lips.There it is.And he slid down her neck to her breasts, licking them and sucking them while he pumped his hips.Ginger wasnt sure what hit hershe was full of him.Full and aching and tingling and spiraling, hanging on for dear life, letting go of every other thought and focused only on one thinglet it go, let it go, let it go.And then it came, hot and hard and sweet and she pushed her pelvis against him suddenly, holding him there.He slid a hand behind her, under her butt, and pressed himself deeply into her, his thrusts smaller and deeper, and she felt her insides grip him.Grip him, hold him tight, tremble, spasm.She heard him moan appreciatively and then it started to subside.She couldnt believe her own ears when she heard herself say, More.He chuckled.We can do more.His mouth latched on a nipple and sucked hard while he pumped his hips anew, hard and deep, and in just a second she had another oneso deep and hot and heavenly she thought she might faint.She relaxed beneath him, still quivering.More?he asked, a smile in his voice.Im good, she whispered.You are that, he said.Hold me.Her arms tightened around his torso, her legs came up to wrap around his hips, and she held on.For him.He rode her, thrusting deep and hard, groaning loudly, murmuring little victory shouts and calling her name.And then she felt him stiffen, harden inside her and spill in what seemed like a million short bursts.It went on longer than she was prepared for, long enough that she started to get turned on all over again while he throbbed inside of her.Finally he quieted and just moaned, but it was a very happy moan.She stroked his back and loosened her legs.And he put soft kisses on her lips.You are not quiet, she finally said.I couldnt help it, he said.It was that good.It was.I think you growled.Maybe barked.I didnt bark!he said, laughing.You prayed, she said.Sort of, he admitted.He rolled to one side, trying to keep them together a while longer, but nature had its way and he slipped out of her.Listen, probably this should have come first.I think I love you.She was quiet a moment.Do let me know when youre sure.Im sure.I love you.Scared me a little.I cant think of any reason it should scare me, but all of a sudden I froze up and worried about ridiculous things.Like what if it couldnt last, what if Im kidding myself, what if I just dont know what Im doing and make the same mistakes over and over again?What if its me?Do you understand?Am I just crazy?I dont know, Matt.I wont know until you tell me your story.A New Hope        Twelve Matt excused himself from the bed and returned a few minutes later with a couple of beers.He sat down on the bed and put the bottles on the bedside table.I can drink one or even both of those if youre letting me stay.She leaned against the headboard, the sheet covering her breasts.She looked down at herself.Im naked and just had wonderful sex.If you leave me now, I might change my number again.So, it was because of me, he said, handing her a beer.Only a little bit, she said, shaking her head.Look, we hadnt professed our love, hadnt been intimate, hadnt made promises.If you got busy or sidetracked or just plain lost interest and decided not to call after all, thats your option.Right?I think I know how things workwomen usually prefer to lay it on the line, say things like, I dont think this is going to work for me, while men tend to say theyll call, then they just dont.Obviously I couldve left my number just the same and if you didnt feel like going any further with me, you wouldnt call.But I wanted to hear from you.I reached out once and didnt get much of a response and it made me very sad and moody.Not the end of the world, right?But I saw a reflection of what I once was.I was that way with Mickso desperate for him to show me he cared.Obviously I dont feel that for Mick anymore but I was not going to get into an identical situation with you.I had to put a stop to it.So it wasnt really about you as much as about me.Do you see?I didnt have enough willpower to forget about you, so I cut myself off.I knew you could find me if you wanted to, but it helped me stop watching the phone.She touched his hand.Im sorry if I hurt you by doing that.He shook his head a little guiltily.I told myself it was because you heard from Mick and were cutting him off.A little of that, she said with a shrug.But truthfully, Mick isnt that hard to get rid of.Just tell him you dont live for the chance to worship him and hes long gone.Im sure Ill never hear from him again.Did he ever offer to support you and your child?Did he ever try to save it?The marriage?She shook her head.It wasnt what he wanted.He wants to be a star.Hes perfectly willing to take me along for the ride.He always said he made some of his best music with me.God, Matt said.You must hate him so much!No, I dont care about Mick.Sowhats making you crazy, Matt?He instantly hung his head.Then he raised it slowly.There are two things you have to know, Ginger.Number one, I havent told anyone, especially not my family.Im good at keeping confidences.And number two, Im not as good at relationships as you are.She smiled tenderly.Oh, you might be just as good.Its okay to take your time.He took a drink and shook his head.Im not sure where to start.Right where you think the beginning is, she said.Okay.I think I married Natalie because shes beautiful.And shes a playful little sex kitten.I think men make that mistake a lot.Well.Howd that work out for you?she asked, smiling in spite of herself.Dont be sarcastic, because youre beautiful.And talk about sexy.He shuddered.You almost killed me.In the best way.In the way I really want to die.She frowned.Im sure there was a compliment in there somewhere...She cleared her throat.Back to business.Guys looked at me with envy.Some of them, like my brothers, their eyes glowed right before they shook their heads like I was the dumbest ox.I wanted it to workit made me happy.She wanted to get married and I said, Okay.Why not?I wanted a wife.What Im only starting to understand is that Natalie had an agenda from the beginningshe was going to become my wife and we would begin to do everything her way, starting with getting me off that farm and into a suit.I swear to God, we talked about everything before we got married.We lived together for almost a year and there was a little grumbling about my hours, about the family being overwhelming, but nothing like after we got married.The second we were married we started to argue about how little we had in common, how disparate our lives were.So from the beginning we fought.And my family said, Could have told you that wasnt going to work.They all saw how she grimaced at the goat shit on her designer heels, picked at her food, wrinkled her nose at the smells, screeched if a dog or chicken got close to her, cried for hours before and after we spent some time at the farm.Wow, Ginger said.That must have been awful.Even I didnt cry for hours before and after Micks all night jam sessions or concerts.And I grew to hate them.It just wasnt going to work, we both knew it.I wouldnt change, she wouldnt change.But something happened that finished it.No one knows about this.Natalie had an abortion.She was planning to keep it a secret, sell it to me as a heavy period, but it got bad, she got scared and I had to take her to the emergency room.I left her right after that, as soon as I was sure she was okay.She had gone too far.I was angry and I was through.Ginger was speechless.She noticed that Matt had to look away to compose himself.She said nothing for a little while.Your baby, she finally whispered.Ours.And it meant nothing to her.Oh, Matt.Im so sorry.How did you find out?He took a breath.I came home one day and found her in bed, gripping her belly with cramps, crying.She was white as a ghost.She said her period was so bad she was scared she was bleeding to death.It was a lot of blood, staining the sheets and a towel and her clothes.I took her straight to the emergency room.I hear a buzzing in my ears when I remember her telling the doctor shed had a procedure that day and told him who performed that procedure, and heard the doctor say that hed examine her but a routine D&C for an abortion was often followed by heavy bleeding for several hours.And for a while I just shut down.Dear God.They looked at her, said it had already slowed down, suggested she stay off her feet for a day and if it didnt get considerably better to come back.They gave her instructionswatch for fever, severe cramping, hemorrhage...I helped her get dressed and took her home but I couldnt even look at her.I couldnt speak.She cried and yelled all the way home about how miserable her life was, how unhappy she was and how she felt trapped by getting pregnant.She didnt know what else to do.I left her the next day, as soon as I was sure she was not going to die.He gave a lame shrug.Thats pretty much it.It was already terrible and then it got worse.And these were things I should have known.I should have known how bad it could get.Or she should have, Ginger said.My family cant ever know about that.Theyd hate her.Is there a reason they should still hold her dear?I mean, are they going to run into her at the State Fair livestock show or something?No, its just...Its not just on her.Youre afraid theyll blame you.Maybe I am, he said.It blindsided me, thats for sure.I felt like a failure and a fool.And of course I knew in five minutes, youre nothing like Natalie.There was no reason for me to be afraid of getting close to you.Oh, I dont think you were, Matt.You just werent quite done with the last relationship.Its understandable if you need a little time to be sure youre ready.Youve been through a rough time.And with no one to talk to.I couldnt talk about it.I was too angry.Im still angry.That was wrong, what she did.And I hate her for it.I can imagine.It must hurt so much.I think you were right in the first placeyou and Natalie married the wrong people.No one understands that better than I doI did that, too.I should have known better.I wish I could explain what makes us blind and deaf to reality.Let me ask you something.Are you afraid of what your life could become with me?he asked, reaching out and tucking her hair behind her ear.Of course not.But see, I wasnt afraid of what Id become with Mick, either.I wanted a different life when I married a man who said he would never go that route.Oh, we have so much in common, Matt, she said, shaking her head sadly.I wanted Mick to turn into a domesticated husband and father when he promised me from the start that was never going to happen.You wanted Natalie to do the same thing when all she wanted was to get you off the farm.And how is that my fault?Oh, Matt, my sweet, sweet Matt.Its not about fault.Its just about understanding.Were all part of the equation, were complicit.Not to blame, but participants.I told Mick I wanted a family and he said, Knock yourself out, but you know that guy in the supermarket with the baby strapped to his chest?I am never going to be that guy.He meant it and I didnt hear him.What the hell was I thinking, being married to him, having a baby with him?What right did I have to expect things of him that werent possible?I had to forgive him.Its kind of freeing.Ill never forgive her.I hate her.That was underhanded and selfish and cruel.She smiled at him.It was, I agree.I love you, Matt, she said.Ive been honest with you.I swear.She couldnt resistshe reached out and ran her fingers through that glorious hair.How could you forgive him?he asked.Oh, he can still make me furiousfor about twenty minutes.When he called me I was outraged by his self centered idiocy.And then I just laughed at how predictable he is.I dont have room in my life for hate.I tried it for a while.It didnt work.And now I want to be with you and I dont want hate to be part of what we have.Then it isnt going to drive you away knowing Im still a little fucked up over my failed marriage?Youd hardly be the first.It takes time to heal.And I think youre going to figure it out real soon.At least you can finally talk about it.Im not sure talking about it got rid of the headache, he said.Mightve been something else, he said, grinning playfully, pulling down the sheet to expose her.He fondled her breast.Done talking, Matt?she asked, humor in her voice.For now, I think.Are you?Done talking?Depends.Whats the alternative?He took the beer from her hand and put it aside.He grabbed her around the waist and said, Come over here and find out.He pulled her close and just held her tight, held her like he was afraid to let go.After a little while he covered her body with his and smothered her with hungry kisses.* * * Ginger wasnt sure what time it was, but she heard the back door open and close and smelled coffee brewing.Matt came into the bedroom with a small satchel in one hand, his phone in the other.Your reputation is completely ruined, he said.Is that so?I went to my truck to get my phone and this bag.I went in my shorts, barefoot.There was a gray haired woman a few doors down tossing trash in the Dumpster and she eyeballed me.I gave her a wave.Carrie, Ginger said.She owns the deli.Shes close with Ray Anne.So, that means shell call Ray Anne?Will that get Ray Anne upset, that I spent the night?Are you kidding?Ray Anne thinks getting laid is a cure for almost anything.I knew I liked her, Matt said, dropping the bag and putting the phone down.He shed his boxers and climbed in.Lets cure a few things while the coffee perks.Youre insatiable...she murmured, acquiescing immediately.Im not the one who keeps saying more!It turns out youre up to the job.Are we going to get up?In case you hadnt noticed, I am up.Can you get in the mood again?Maybe.How long are you planning to stay?Until the last possible moment.God, why didnt I think of this weeks ago...?He finally stopped talking, and Ginger just relaxed and enjoyed him.He was a powerful lover, but also sweet and sensitive.His hands were a little rough and he apologized for them, but the roughness that came from hard work felt good on her skin.He couldnt be quiet, always whispering sweet things, always asking her how she felt and serving her needs.His one goal seemed to be making her happy, pleasing her.And when she said more!he laughed and seemed thrilled by it.Ginger hadnt had a lot of partners in her life.There were a couple of men before Mick when she was right around twenty, guys she knew immediately werent right for her.Then there was Mick who, to his credit, was very romantic when he felt like it, but their time together wasnt a priority for him.And while it wouldnt be ladylike to say so, Matts skill made Mick look like a bumbling lad.She didnt even want to know where he came by all this experience and skill.She was a little afraid of the answer.Limp and satisfied once more, she lay in the bed while he went to get them coffee.I have to go to work, she said.We dont open early on Saturdays and theres no wedding today, but Im needed in the shop.When do you open it?Were open ten till four on Saturdays, unless its the day before a holiday like Valentines or Mothers Daythen we stay open till six.Today is a short day.I might be able to sneak away early.But I really should shower and get down there.Will you go back to the farm?Is this the last possible moment now?Hell, no, sweetheart!Im hanging around unless you want me to leave.If Id known your work schedule Id have taken you out for breakfast.Ill grab a bowl of cereal or power bar.Maybe you should have both.How about we plan a nice dinner out tonight, he asked.Maybe well drive over to Bandon or Coos Bay.Just tell me what youd like and Ill find a nice restaurant for us.If I let you stay, let you sleep with me, is there any chance something is going to go all wonky in your head and youll turn into Mad Matt again?God, I hope not, he said.Heres what I think we should do.We should talk, like we already do.We should spend time together.We should take it easy and slow and make sure we understand each other.Right?If there are things about me you dont like, dont want to be stuck with, you have to promise to speak up.And vice versa.Im not going to try to change you, but I want to really know you.So far, youd have trouble convincing me youre not perfect.She laughed at him.Well, I guarantee you, Im not!Lets do it, Ginger.Lets check this outus.Ive been alone over a year and no one ever shook me up like you.Im not walking away without a real good reason.But if you tell me to go...He shrugged.Just be honest with me, thats all.Im sure Ill make mistakes but Im not going to force myself on a woman.And yet, you packed an overnight bag, she pointed out.I am the eternal optimist.Im going to get in the shower.What will you do today while I work?Well, with your permission, Im going to go see Peyton, tell her were together and ask her to butt out.Oh, Matt, she said.Seriously, shes been hell to bear ever since she first saw the way I looked at you.I love my sister but shes a bossy pain in the ass.Sisters should always be younger.Shes not the boss of me.Ginger laughed.You be nice to her or Ill dump you.Sure.Right.So then I might check and see if I can bring you lunch.Ill walk around town a little, maybe head down the beach if the weather holds.And there are some organic farms east of here.I like looking at farms, talking to farmers.He lay back on the bed, lacing his fingers together behind his head.He crossed one long, hairy leg over the other.Right now Im going to watch you do your morning things.And enjoy it.She took her coffee into the bathroom.No, she said.Youre not.And she slammed the door.* * * Well, good morning, Grace chirped when Ginger came in the back door of the shop.Grace was making a centerpiece, and Ginger marveled at how fast her hands moved, how perfectly symmetrically every stem and blossom fell into place.How was dinner last night?HilariousAshley and Eve joined us.They tell these riotous stories of college life, the older women get the vapors and we all laugh until we have to stop and take a bathroom break.And the food was out of this world.Zorbas.Have you been?I dont think so.Ill have to talk Troy into that some night when we need a break from Winnie.And how is dear Winnie?Ginger asked.Dear Winnie is in fine form.You know, I brought her here because it was practicalthat big old house in San Francisco wasnt going to work for an invalid.And selfishly, I thought the only way I could spend time with her without killing myself flying back and forth to the Bay Area was if I could get her up here.But I didnt realize how perfectly it would work out.First of all, Lin Su is a dream come true.Shes there almost every day in spite of the fact we hired her for a forty hour week.As long as she can slip away to take care of her own personal business while Winnie rests or is tended by Mikhail, shes happy to check on Winnie almost every day.And Winnie loves her.Whew, huh?And when Winnie is outside on the deck enjoying the activity on the beach and bay, people drop by to visit with her.Ill go out on a limb and say shes never had this in her lifeshes been too isolated by position.No one in Thunder Point knows or cares that Winnie is important.She laughed almost gaily.Mikhail is developing a routine and making friendshes off to the diner, the neighbors, Coopers, hes even driven up to the rink in North Bend to check out the skating and he let it slip the other night that hes thinking of retirement.Now, I dont know if thats true but I bet it means hes not leaving anytime soon.He must like this little town, Ginger said.Kind of sounds like it.Grace stopped working and looked at Ginger.I brewed coffee for you even though I am staying off caffeine.Apparently you dont need it, Ginger said.Youre pretty energetic.And you look fantastic this morning.You must have slept better than usual or something.I think so, yes, she said, getting herself some coffee.While dressing her coffee, without looking at Grace, she said, I had a surprise visitor last night.Oh?And who might that be?Matt, she said quietly.He came knocking...Grace gasped.Oh!Did you talk?Of course we talked, she said with a laugh.He freaked out that I was out of reach.And drove all the way down here!Grace said.And back?Thats about eight hours round trip!He didnt go back, Ginger said.I think hes showering right now.Grace gasped again.Oh, my God, get out of here!Go back upstairs.I can handle thistheres not much going on.You should have just called me!You could have had the day.After all youve done for me Its okay, Grace, Ginger said.Im not changing my schedule for Matt.And he has things to do today.Ill see him later.In fact, I might suggest we go to Zorbas for dinner.There are tons of things on the menu I want to try.If you dont mind me askingwhat does he have to do today?I think hes starting with a visit to Peyton to tell her hes here to see me.I hope that goes wellto hear Matt tell it, shes been trying to spare me Matts pursuit.I take it youd rather not be spared?Hes a wonderful man, Grace.Hes kind and generous and very strong in principle.I think Im falling in love with him.Think?Okay, Im sure, but dont tell, okay?Were both a little woundeda couple of painful relationships, a hard time getting back on our feet, all that baggage.Well be okay, I think.But we shouldnt have to deal with pressure from loving friends and family.Grace was grinning.No pressure.Check.But if I were you, Id go right back upstairs.No, Ginger said, laughing.I used to hate leaving Troy up there in my bed.He was so cute...Matt is beyond cute, Ginger thought, laughing.Still, it took great discipline to keep her work schedule knowing he was right up there.Im here to work, she said.Okay then, Grace said.But I bet youre not worth a damn with that love hangover glowing all over you.* * * Matt decided to walk to Peytons house.When she opened the door, his sister was dressed for cleaning with a feather duster thing in one hand.She had a babushka type scarf covering her head, wore yoga pants with an oversize T shirt and had bare feet.What are you doing here?she asked.You and I have to get a few things straight, he said.Can you take a break from whatever youre doing there?I guess.Is this going to lead to a fight?she asked.I hope so, he said.Im pretty pissed off at you.Where are Scott and the kids?He took them fishing for a while so I could clean house.Why are you pissed off at me?she asked, holding the door open for him.He entered.Gimme a break, Peyton.Youve been bossy and controlling, deciding things that are not for you to decide, and you know it.I mean, you couldve offered to call Ginger and deliver a message for me.Because I didnt give out Gingers phone number?I didnt feel it was my right to do that.She had a new phone number for a reason, after all.Yeah, and it wasnt me!You could have been helpful instead of mean.As it turns out, she wasnt upset with me.And I had to go to some trouble to track her down.I didnt know, she said stubbornly.Its not my business.And besides, I see you got down here bright and early to check it out.I came last night, he said, trying not to act smug about it.She raised one dark brow and suddenly Matt saw his mother in her face.Oh, boy.Really?she said.Now, I want you to listen, he said.Were together.I love her.Weve both been through some stuff and weve had a couple of rocky situations, and well probably have a couple more rocky moments while we try to get beyond our stuff, but we want to hammer it out because we both happen to think were good together.I dont know if this is going the distance.I want it to, but its possible were not perfect together or its not the right time or one of us isnt ready, but you gotta butt out.Really, youd fuck up a wet dream.Nice, Matt, she said, curling her lip.Im serious here, Peyton.Id never hurt Ginger.Im sorry Im not coming to her all perfect, but Im trying and Id never hurt her.Shes a good person.Shes a beautiful person.Talking to her really helps me and if I can believe her, it helps her, too.We seem to really care about each other and were working the kinks out.You have to back away slowly, let us be.Or I swear...Come in, Matt, she said almost cheerfully.Lets have a cup of coffee.He hesitated.Sounds like a trap, he said.Dont be ridiculous, she said, walking to the kitchen and leaving him to follow.Id just like to sit down and hear what you have to say.A little reluctantly, he followed.She put a cup of coffee in front of him and sipped herbal tea from her mug.She made a face, which made him laugh.You feeling all right, Peyton?he asked.Well, I have moments, she said.Im tired, get nauseous, cant have anything good to drink.I think when the baby moves, Ill feel lots better about giving up coffee and wine.Now, tell me about you and Ginger.In your dreams, Peyton.Im not here to discuss my personal life, just to get some boundaries in place.Well, what kind of rocky stuff are you working through?she asked.Like you dont know?Were just out of tough, unsuccessful relationships.Shes had losses and so have I.  I know you didnt like Natalie but that doesnt make it easier to know I failed at marriage.You know how the men in our family feel about marriage.In a miraculous moment of compassion, she tilted her head and the look on her face was contrite.I know, Matt.Im sorry that didnt work out.But youre not all that sorry, he said.Sorry for you, she insisted.Im sorry you were hurt.I knew you would be, but See, that knowing everything?Thats going to get between you and me.So you were right, good for you.But I did my best with Natalie and guess what?If you tell me right now that you dont think Im good enough for Ginger, that theres no way its going to work, Im not listening to that, either.See, I didnt see it working out with that asshole Ted you were with for three years but it was what you wanted at the time and I kept my mouth shut.And when you settled in with Scott, I thought that was great, but I never said anything like, Hey, great recovery, Peyton.Wow, she said.You didnt like Ted?Who did?he asked.I know you think Ginger is too good for me.Youre probably right.I know you think it would be great if I could somehow deserve her and make a decent life with a decent personI get that.The bottom line iswe didnt hire a matchmaker.Thats no good, Peyton.We have to find out if we work, not get together because someone as smart as you endorses it.You have to let it be up to us.You love her?I do.Shes amazing.I admire her so much.What about all those other women?she asked.I dont know.He shrugged.The question quieted him, made him think.Spinning my wheels.Marking time.Looking and making mistakes and...Look, Im not proud of that, all right?I didnt break laws.I was careful with their feelings.It didnt always work but I was.There hasnt been anyone in a while now.And if it makes you feel better, it didnt do anything to make me happy.In fact, it made me miserable.But Im happy right now, he went on.That doesnt mean Im diving in too fast, but for Gods sake, let me try being happy.Will you?Peyton got tears in her eyes.Aw, Matt...Jesus, dont cry!Dont!I want to smack you so dont cry!Im pregnant, she said, and tears ran down her cheeks.I hate that you ever thought I didnt want you to be happy.Awww...Im not mad at you, Peyton.Well, a little bit because I thought you wanted to keep me away from Ginger.I just thought you wanted me to be happy your way, he said.He got up from the kitchen table and found the box of tissues.He tossed it at her and it accidentally hit her in the head before she caught it.He winced.I did, she said.I wanted you to be happy my way.I have a little issue with that being right thing.But I didnt know you knew so much about yourself.About Ted.About rocky situations.About working through things with an amazing woman.About looking for love in all the wrong places.I just thought...That I was a big dumb lummox.Well...Save it, he said.And he waited while she mopped her eyes and blew her nose.He tried keeping a scowl on his face while she sniveled.He crossed his arms stubbornly over his chest.It was all an act.He wanted to hug her.Really, she said with a sniff.Nothing could make me happier than to think of you in a healthy relationship with a nice woman like Ginger.All evidence to the contrary, he said.If I say sorry can that be the end of it?I dont know, Peyton, he said.Can you mind your own business?She narrowed her eyes at him.You might want to go a little easy on me.Thats the price of forgiveness, he said.Your word.Then you stand by it and mind your own business.All right, she said irritably.I cant believe you made me cry.Those were fetal tears and you know it.I cant remember when youve ever cried over one of us boys.I might cry a little easier these days, she relented.So.Youre going to be around awhile?Im going to leave for the farm Sunday night.We might bump into each other but lets be clear, Im here to be with Ginger.I need to spend time with her.All right, jeez.He softened.He smiled warmly.Maybe next week or the week after we can get together.Well, dont go to any trouble, she shot back.So.We understand each other?he asked.We understand each other, mutiko, she said, meaning little boy.That made him frown.Dont push it, he warned.I have things to do.He stood to leave.After taking a couple of steps toward the door he turned back to her.He put a small kiss on her forehead.He hugged her gently.Behave, he warned.A New Hope        Thirteen Grace had never wished illness on her mother but it was true that the relationship she had with her now was better than ever.Their routine was calming.When Grace rose in the morning she would go upstairs to Winnies room.She would usually knock softly, not just to be sure Winnie was awake but also to be certain she wouldnt wake or disturb Mikhail, who never admitted to spending nights in the chair beside Winnies bed.Grace would go into her mothers room to find Winnie sitting up, wearing her favorite bed jacket.This particular morning shed seen Mikhail out on the deck with coffee.Winnies trembling had worsened and she could no longer fluff her hair or paint on her rose colored lipstwo things she hated to be seen without accomplishing.Grace actually enjoyed helping her mother with these small tasks.It made her feel useful, indispensable even.Time for that silly wench from the town to come out and give us a fix up, Winnie said of the local hairdresser who had obliged them by making regular house calls.As long as you promise not to call her that silly wench, Grace said with a laugh.I know better than that, for Gods sake.Its like insulting the chefhe might spit in the soup.You could end up with red hair.Or bald, Grace pointed out.Would you like to have your tea on the deck?Only if I dont look like the wrath of God, Winnie said.First the ladies room, please.The fog hasnt lifted, but the sun is over the mountains already.You can watch it rise and chase the fog out to sea, Grace told her.Youll need your shawl.Troy and Mikhail are already out there with their coffee.Its a lovely, dewy morning.Winnie didnt say so often but she liked this place.It was like a vacation, like a chilly and wintry Cabo San Lucas.When she was on the deck, which was a couple of times a day in good weather, there were regular visitors.Sarah Cooper liked to have a morning run with her Great Dane, Ham, and she would stop by some mornings to say hello to Winnie, leaving the dog at the foot of the stairs.Seth Sileski, on the other hand, enjoyed an early evening jog and would then meet friends at Coopers, but hed frequently stop by for a little report on the town first.Winnie really enjoyed the local news from Seth even if she didnt know half the people.Grace liked a walk on the beach now and then and she always walked to and from the flower shop if it wasnt raining.Dr.Grant took his little ones fishing off the dock sometimes and he used that opportunity to ask after Winnies health, and their next door neighborsthe Lawsonschecked in frequently if they saw Winnie enjoying the sunshine.This was actually new for Winniefriends and neighbors who werent intimidated by her, who cared if she was well or ill.Mikhail was often about, but he had his own routines.He now donned board shorts that were extralong on his short body, a hat, white socks in his brown German walking shoes.He walked on and off all day long.He went into town, had a meal at the diner almost every day, visited with Waylan at his bar, sometimes helped Grace and Ginger pull in their sidewalk displays at closing time.Even though he didnt drive he made regular visits to the service station having struck up friendships with the owner, Eric, and his right hand man, Al.These days he talked a lot about buying a car.And weirdly unsurprisingly, he had many female fans who honked their horns and waved as they drove by.He frequently walked out of town to the nearest farm stand and brought home fresh vegetables.Grace said he must log twenty miles some days.As July warmed the beach there was a new development that warmed Graces heart.She waved to a couple on the beach, and Winnie said, Who is it, Grace?Ginger and Matt.Holding hands and strolling.She sighed.Theyre in love and together every weekend.Do I know this Matt?I dont think so, Mother.We could have them to dinner some weekend if you like.Hes very nice.Hes a farmer from north of herethe Portland area.A farmer?That sounds tedious.Grace laughed.Its Peytons brother.Theyre not very showy people but that farm is enormous and very successful.Peyton tells me Matt is a scientist with an advanced degree, science applied to farming.Hes very smart.As the couple stopped on the beach and kissed, Winnie made a sound.Well, theres what your generation calls something...public displays of something.Is called PDA, Mikhail informed her.Public displays of affection, Babushka.Something you have never been accused of.Winnie leaned toward him.Im not agile and Im not strong anymore, but if you call me that again Im going to hurt you.That made Mikhail grin.Is adorable name for you, my dove.Is sweet Russian name for grandmother.Id rather be a dove than a sweet Russian grandmother.The sound of the front door opening and closing announced the arrival of Winnies nurse.She yelled, Good morning, from the foyer.Then she migrated to the deck.How is everyone this morning?Very well, Winnie said.All things considered.Now, Grace, who is that boy down there by the dock?I dont think I know him, Mama.A kid from town, no doubt.Thats my son, Charlie, Lin Su said.Ive brought him to the beach before.Dont worry, hes just going to hang out while Im with you.Cant we meet him?Grace asked.I didnt want to bring him to work, exactly.But I dont want him to sit in front of the computer or TV all summer while hes out of school.So on nice days I bring him along, and he gets some fresh air.No, you shouldnt allow all that TV and computer nonsense, Winnie said.Hell go blind and his brain will rot.But what will he do?Sit there all day?He has the run of the town.If he makes the slightest effort, he could actually meet people.Oh, Lin Su, you shouldnt let a child that young loose all day without your supervision.Hes not as young as he looks, she said.Hes fourteen, just kind of small for his age.And when he was little he had health problemsI suppose hes still catching up.He wont be any trouble for you, I promise.He has money for lunch.And sunscreen and stuff in the car, like his laptop, which he can only use for an hour or two.And we have our cell phones for texting so we can keep tabs on each other.Winnie turned and looked up at Lin Su.I want you to go down there and tell him hes welcome here anytime as long as hes not too wild or loud because sometimes I have to rest or Im useless.Tell him youll make him lunch heretheres an abundance of food, and Troy keeps buying more.He can even watch TV, just not all dayhe needs air and sunshine.Thats very sweet, Winnie, but Im done talking about it.Be a good little nurse and go talk to your son.Lin Su turned desperate eyes to Grace.We dont want to be any trouble...This is my job.Ill leave him home if You dont have to leave him home if hes no trouble, Winnie said.I didnt know you had a son.You never mentioned it.Lin Su, you must have been pretty young.You dont look much over thirty yourself, Grace said.Oh, Im sorrythat was rude.I didnt mean to pry!Maybe Im catching up, too, she said.Im not married.We make a pretty good team, me and Charlie.And now that he doesnt need babysitting or after school programs, we do very well.But Charlie is kind of shy...My specialty, Troy said, jumping up from his spot on the deck.Ill go invite him up.Oh, Troy, Lin Su said, embarrassed.Let him, Grace said.Troy needs a playmate.As do I, Mikhail said, rising a bit more slowly to follow.Grace looked at Lin Sus almost pleading expression and laughed.Try not to worry, Lin Su.Were not exactly a traditional family.Charlie might fit right in.After all, you have.* * * Matts world had changed because of Ginger.He was experiencing life in a whole new way, in a way he hadnt even been smart enough to long for, to hope for.Because the farm was stable, no drought, no damaging storms, no infestations or illnesses, he was sneaking away for at least three nights every week.He drove to Thunder Point on Thursday afternoon and home either Sunday night or Monday morning.Because his eyes were bright and his smile quick, Paco kept telling him to take time while he could.Come August, things will be crazy again, he warned Ginger.First the grapesUncle Sals grapes.I could probably get out of it, but I shouldnt.Those early grapes have to be brought in and we depend on his people when the pears are ready.Its steady for a couple of months.Its hard work.I could come to you, Ginger said.I could help a little.If you showed me what to do.Peyton will spend a couple of weekends at the farm, she hardly ever misses it.But Grace needs you, he said.Grace and I can job share a little bit.Im good at running the front of the store and Im getting better at creating the arrangements.Ive had days on my own with only delivery help from Justin.I can give her a couple of days off every week if she can give me a couple of days.You dont care when I come, do you?I just cant think about not having you next to me for more than a week, he said.Its torture.You might be getting a little spoiled, she said.And youre not?he asked, an evil little gleam in his eye.Matt couldnt remember ever feeling this way.He was a little embarrassed by that, though he wasnt sure how he was supposed to know the difference between a good thing and the real thing.There was no question that when he was deciding to marry Natalie his life had seemed good.If she wasnt having some wedding meltdown or issue with having Sunday dinner with his family, he was feeling pretty damn satisfied.But Ginger took that to a whole new level.Just being herself, she made him feel like the richest man on earth.He had never before felt this secure with a woman; he never felt even a second of doubt.Hed heard those ridiculous love songs about being willing to die for someone and he always found himself thinking, Id be willing to give up a few thingsbowling, shaving, driving a truck, cutting my hair.But die for someone?A little extreme...But here in his arms was a woman he would do anything for.Would he leave the farm for Ginger?He just might, except she wouldnt ask him to.If he was wrong about her he was going to retire to a mountaintop and live a completely celibate life, but if there was one thing that seemed real it was what Ginger said to him.She liked his farm.She loved him.And when someone loves you, they let you know your happiness is paramount to them.Hed never had that before.They had a few blissful weeks together that brought them to July; long phone conversations at night, long weekends filled with plenty of time in each others arms and also enjoyable time with Thunder Point friends.And with his sister.I have to admit, I never saw this coming, Peyton said to him.My brother, Mad Matt, all soft and cuddly.I told you if youd just get out of my way, I knew what I was doing, he said.Except, did you?Know what you were doing?Not really, but fortunately Ginger did.Really?And are you a man to be led around by the nose?Peyton teased.Yes.I am.There was a moment of doubt and worry in the middle of July when Ginger became a little quiet.It was sudden.He was getting ready to go back to the farm when she seemed very tired, a little down in the dumps.He wasnt used to seeing her eyes downcast.She wasnt as talkative on the phone that night or the next night; she didnt seem to have much to say.She complained of having a headache and being tired.I thought I drove away the headaches, he teased.Its very unusual for me and itll pass.Thanks for understanding.Of course Matt didnt understand at all.But he just kept telling her he loved her.He didnt know what else to do.* * * Al Michel climbed the back stairs to Gingers little apartment and tapped on the door.When she answered, it was obvious shed been crying.Hi, he said.Got a minute?Is it important?she asked.It is.I think its important.Could I just have a few minutes?Is Ray Anne all right?Shes excellent, but I wanted to talk to you, Al said.I wont take too much of your time.Okay, I guess, she said, opening the door.Im a little under the weather, though.Sure you are, honey, he said.Lets just sit down in there.She shrugged and let him follow her to the sofa, where they sat.I know what tomorrow is, Al said.Immediately, tears began to run down Gingers cheeks.Ray Anne told you, she murmured.Sort of.She told me a long time ago but its possible she doesnt even remember.I remembered.I stopped by the shop late today and youd already left, not feeling so good, Grace said.And she mentioned you were taking tomorrow off.She didnt think you were real sick, though.Im not so sure about that, she said.What youre feeling, its okay, Al said.Ive felt it myself.Felt it deep.Do you have a plan for how youre going to spend the day tomorrow?Driving, she said, letting a slightly embarrassed laugh squeak through the tears.I figured as much.How about I take you?You?she asked, shocked.I have experience with this.Ray told you, Im sure.I lost a son to SIDS.We think it was SIDSit was a real long time ago.Doctors know a lot more about it now.I was a young husband, only about twenty.Just a kid.I didnt go to his grave on the anniversary of his death.I went on his birthday every year.Every summer for over thirty years.You and mewe have some things in common.I dont know anyone else who lost a baby to SIDS, she said.There arent that many, thank God.My wife and I didnt stay together.She went on to have a good marriage and a couple of healthy kids.It took me a long time to give up going to that grave in absolute agony every year.Can you still feel him?she asked, fresh tears escaping.Not anymore, honey.For a long time I could feel him against my shoulder, his little head lying against me right here, he said, demonstrating by positioning his hands.I finally let the kid rest.I know youre going to do what you have to do, Ginger.I hope theres some way I can help.And I hope you dont dedicate as many years to grief as I did.Remembering is good.Agonizing is useless.Its the first year, she said, sniffing.Let me take you so you dont have to drive.I can manage not to talk.I wont ask questions.She shook her head.I just want to have a day alone to remember, thats all.You can talk about it if you want to, you know.She gave her head a little shake.You can talk to Matt.He seems a real good man.And I can tell, he cares about you.I just dont want to put this on Matt.Aw, hes a big tough guy, he can handle it...I want it to be mine, she said.Do you understand that?He laughed a little, a small laugh that said he knew exactly.Ginger, I left my wifeI couldnt even talk to her and it was her baby.Sweetheart, I know youre in pain right now.I just hope you dont do that to yourself.
