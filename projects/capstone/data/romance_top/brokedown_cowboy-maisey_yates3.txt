He had a ranch to work on.* * * SHED HAD FANTASIES about Connor before.Here, in the darkness of her room, she was woman enough to admit that.And yes, she had seen him without his shirt on.They spent a lot of time on the lake, down by the river and on the beach.Copper Ridge was surrounded by water and they, like most of the other residents, made the most of it.But somehow, seeing him in his underwear was different.Because it wasnt just his perfectly muscular chest, with a very perfect amount of chest hair sprinkled over it.Or his washboard flat abs and the tattoo that was starting to drive her crazy.No, it was combined with the full scope of his very muscular thighs, compliments of years in the saddle, and, it just...well, and...the very prominent bulge at the apex of said muscular thighs.There.Shed admitted it.It was burned into her brain now.The image of him standing in his kitchen nearly naked, looking as if hed just been slapped upside the head with a two by four.She rolled over onto her stomach and buried her head beneath her pillow.She had to be adult about this.She snorted and rolled back over, uncovering her face.That was the problem.She was being adult about this.Very adult.With lots of adult thoughts and desires and needs.What were you supposed to do when your adult needs were for your best friend and roommate?Where was her handbook?Ignore it, she said out loud, like always.It was the only thing to do.They would have to go on as though undiegate had never happened.She was just having a little Connor relapse due to the close proximity.Probably not aided at all by the recent amount of time shed been spending taking care of him.And definitely not helped by her extremely long bout of celibacy and singledom.When things settled down she would have to focus on getting a date.Yes, that would help.A little bit of normalcy, a man who wasnt Connor filling her time.Yes, that would help.And if in the meantime, she spent just a little bit of time thinking about how Connor had looked in his underwear, well, she was only human.It didnt mean anything.Just a little healthy female to male appreciation.That was her story, and she was sticking to it.THE MORNING THE INSURANCE settlement money went into Connors bank account he felt as if there was a timer ticking down.And there was a part of hima much larger part of him than he might have imaginedthat wanted to take the money and go down to Cancun.Just disappear from all this for a while, from Copper Ridge, from responsibility.But he couldnt do that.Because of the ranch, because of his family, because Elis election was coming up, and he had to be there for that.Damn responsibilities.He would rather have a margarita.But his family needed him here, and if there was one thing he wouldnt do, it was abandon them.Their mother had walked out when things had gotten tough, and Connor wasnt going to do the same.No, he wasnt his mother in this little play.He was the one who was left behind.He was a lot closer to being his father.He gritted his teeth.No, he wasnt.He saw to his responsibilities.Like getting the barn built?Yeah, he had to get the barn built.He had enough money to hire a crew to come out and get it done, which meant he needed to get started as soon as possible.There was no excuse.Maybe that was something else Liss could help him with.Liss.That was also feeling slightly difficult at the moment.And it was his fault.Because she had seemed fine after their little mostly naked run in a few days ago.But his brain had latched on to the vivid image of what she might look like in the mint colored thong and hadnt let go.It was starting to drive him crazy.On the long list of things he never wanted to talk to anyone about was the effect grief had on his sex drive.It just wasnt something anyone needed to know about.Yes, they all had a fair idea he wasnt getting any, if only because it was a small town, and they all lived in each others pockets.Okay, the town at large didnt know, but Eli knew that he didnt see women coming back to the property, and Jack knew that when he left the bar with a woman, Connor always left alone.They wouldnt have to ponder his actions too hard to figure that out.Plus, he had admitted as much to Eli during the worlds most horrific conversation a few months back.But what he hadnt admitted was that it was more than not feeling like engaging in a flirtation or a hookup.It was that his give a damn was busted on such a bone deep level that he didnt even fantasize about hooking up.It was pretty easy to abstain when you didnt even feel like jacking off to deal with a morning erection.A morning erection that had become a lot more insistent since Lisss thong had come into his life.Connor groaned and scooped up a pitchfork full of manure from his horses stall and chucked it into the back of the truck.He was going to deal with this the way he had dealt with it back in high school.Hard work.That was, in his experience, the worlds most effective boner killer.Except for the obvious.And he wasnt going to do either obvious thing.For equally obvious reasons.Hey, Connor, did that pitchfork do something terrible to you?Connor turned and saw Eli standing at the entrance to the stalls.Im shoveling shit, Eli.How excited am I supposed to look?All right, fair enough.You just dont normally look actively angry while doing it.Connor stuck the pitchfork into the shavings and leaned against it.I got my insurance money today.Well, damn, Eli said, monotone.Those bastards.Finally settling the score with you.I have half a mind to go and slap handcuffs on them.I didnt ask for your sarcasm.I dont know why youre standing there looking so upset about finally getting what youve been working toward for the past few months.Connor winced internally.But he was not about to have the same argument with Eli that he had already had with Liss.I guess its just time to rebuild.And I have a hard time feeling very enthusiastic about rebuilding.I dont have a great track record, Eli.I dont know if youve noticed.What do you mean by that?I tried to do the best I could by this ranch.By the family.But every time I try to make something better, nature finds a way to burn it to the ground, for lack of a less obvious metaphor.Eli frowned.I know things have been hard, but everything thats happened...do you really think thats all about you?Sure, or I have a lightning rod above my head.Its either that or its random, Eli.Tell me which one is supposed to make me feel better.Eli rubbed his hand over his forehead.I doubt anything I could say would make you feel better.Except that no matter the answer, you have to keep doing things.Sometimes Id rather not.That was what Dad did, Eli said.The total lack of judgment in Elis voice made the statement even worse.As though he couldnt blame their dad, and wouldnt blame Connor, either.But Connor would.Connor did.Yeah, well, its not what Im going to do.I work, dont I?I work the ranch every day.Not leaving it to my kids to do, not that I have any, but you get the point.Connor let out a long, slow breath.It hasnt escaped my notice that anything new I bring onto this ranch seems to die.He met his younger brothers gaze.Tell me thats not true.I cant, Eli said, his voice strained.Connor, youre probably the only person on this earth more connected to Jessies death than I am.I was there.I was the one who had to tell you.I feel it.The brutality of it, the suddenness of it.I feel it down to my bones.Please know that I dont take what youve been through lightly.And when I tell you I think you need to move on, when I tell you that I want to see you happy, its not because I dont realize what you went through.Because I was there, Connor.Connor knew Eli was talking about his reaction to his wifes death.Eli was the only witness to that moment, and he was probably the only one who remembered it with any real clarity.Connor could hardly piece together the memory, and it was probably all for the best.The moments after the words had left Elis mouth had been a blur.* * * IT WAS LATE, and the only person hed been expecting was Jessie, so the knock at the door was a surprise.Connor opened the door, and his brother turned to face him, something in his expression strange.Wrong.The porch light was on, a ring of gold surrounding Elis frame.Eli stepped inside, not saying a word.Another thing that seemed wrong.Connor, go on and sit down.He complied, because hed never seen his brother look quite so desolate.Not even when their mother had left.Not even after their father had died.There was an accident tonight, he said, his voice breaking.And he didnt even have to finish the sentence, because right then Connor knew.His whole body went cold, and something in his gut turned, and he knew.He knew it wasnt Eli, his brother, just paying a visit, but a sheriffs deputy doing his duty.A brother doing his duty.Jessie died tonight, Connor.* * * THERE HAD BEEN nothing after that.Just a kind of strange buzzing in his head that wouldnt go away.And he was aware of saying things, but not of what hed said.He couldnt remember anything that had happened after Eli spoke those words.He couldnt remember the rest of the night or the whole next day.A full twenty four hours that were gone forever.A gift, he imagined.Even knowing that, Eli continued, I want you to have more.But Eli didnt know everything.And Connor knew, in spite of his brothers good intentions, he thought he understood and empathized a bit better than he did.I want you to have what I have, Eli said.I didnt think I wanted to find love, but then I met Sadie.And everything changed.Everything changed.For some reason that part of the sentence stuck out in Connors mind.But he didnt want to overthink it.Yeah, and after what wed been through as kids, deciding to go ahead and get married wasnt the easiest decision for me.But thats what happens when you fall in love, Connor said.I know Sadie is this new chapter of your life, and I think because of the timing, you dont quite equate it with me losing Jessie.But thats what it is.What if you lost her, Eli?Would you want someone else?Eli looked away.No, he said, his voice rough.But I only mean it...I was afraid, too.Remember, we had this discussion.That love came here to die.But I found love again, and there was no room for me to stay scared when I found it.Just stay open.And...maybe start small.Like with building a barn.Connor cleared his throat.I can do that.If Jack were here, he would suggest adding sex to that list.Heat burst through Connors veins, because that word had become inextricably linked to the mint colored thong.I dont want to have this discussion with you.We tried it once.Lets never repeat it.Eli shifted, obviously uncomfortable.Well, I dont want to have the discussion.I just worry about you, dammit.Stop it.I dont need you to worry about me.I need you to focus on your woman and your campaign.Speaking of my campaign, and speaking of your barn...Connor crossed his arms over his chest.What about it?If you can get the barn built in time, Id love to have a party out here on election night.Well set up a TV and watch the results and well have a party.A big barbecue.Sadie has bewitched you.Because only six months ago you wouldve gagged and died thinking about having a party here.Connor rubbed his chin.Come to think of it, last time we had a party here, planned by Sadie, you burned my fucking barn down.And Im willing to take the risk again.Because a barn is meant to be used.Connor gritted his teeth and forced his brain not to apply that statement as a broader metaphor for life.Or for his dick.Fine.If its on track to be structurally sound by election night, its yours.And now the construction of the barn was for someone else, and that meant he had to get it done.Ill make some calls today.Eli took a step forward and slapped Connor on the back, which was about the closest they ever got to a touching moment.Thanks, man.I appreciate it.This is your ranch, too.You live on the property.Name is on the deed.Its not a favor.Its your right.Stop trying to act like youre a 100 percent mean son of a bitch, Eli said.Its only about 85 percent.Connor flipped him off and grabbed the pitchfork again.You going to stand there all day, or are you going to help shovel?Eli smiled.Guess Ill go get my own pitchfork.* * * THE WEATHER SAYS this is going to be the last nice day in a while.I think we should head up the mountain and go to Horseshoe Falls.Liss finished her last bite of breakfast and looked up at Connor expectantly.It was a little bit crisp outside, but the sun was already breaking through the clouds, and after a week spent behind her desk, all she wanted for her Saturday was to escape into the mountains.Solitude wouldve probably been the smarter choice, but once Connor had come downstairs, in flannel and worn jeans, shed been unable to pass up the chance of spending the day with him.Because he was her best friend, not because of his jeans.Or the way they fit.Or the way he looked wearing only the underwear that was undoubtedly beneath them.It was not about that at all.It was about friendship and togetherness and not the fine muscular structure of his thighs.I shouldnt skip out on work, Connor said, gripping the edge of the counter and leaning back against it.Just a couple of hours, Connor.A quick hike to the top of the trail.Yeah, that long to the top, and then we have to hike down.If you lie down on the trail, I can give you a good shove and maybe you can roll back down to the ranch, she said, trying to look innocent.He lifted his coffee mug to his lips.Felicity Foster, if I fall Im going to grab on to your ankles and bring you with me.He was teasing her, a humorous light in his dark eyes, and yet for some reason his words made her stomach knot up tight.Right.So, are we going to do this or not?Okay, lets do this.But you have to pack peanut butter sandwiches.I think I can handle that, she said, smiling brightly.Then lets go.* * * THE TRAIL THAT led up to Horseshoe Falls was almost completely closed in by trees.Shades of green filled in every available space.Ferns grew over the ground like a lush, velvet carpeting.The sun could only peek through the few windows in the branches, moss thriving in the near constant shade, growing on all sides of the trees and over the gray, craggy rocks.Lisss boot slipped on a patch of mud on the trail, and she pitched forward slightly, speeding up her steps to keep her balance.She reached out, grabbing a hold of Connors shoulder to keep from doing a face plant.He stopped walking and looked at her.Careful.Im not chasing after you if you roll over the ledge.I am being careful.But some of this trail is a little bit sludgier than I anticipated.You were the one who said it was a good day to hike.She released her hold on him, and they resumed walking.It is.Its a fantastic day to hike.She breathed in deep, relishing the crisp air that smelled like pine and soil.I dont think weve gone hiking up here since before summer.Its been a while.So, she said, knowing that she had just engaged in the clumsiest conversation transition of all time, do you have plans for getting the construction of the barn started?Im working on it.I talked to Eli a couple of days ago, and he wants to have his election night party in the new barn.Which means it needs to get going.Excellent.Because I have an idea.He stopped in the middle of the trail and turned, his hands on his lean hips, one of his dark brows raised.Oh, shit.You have an idea?Im really not sure how I feel about that reaction.Again, I feel compelled to remind you that normal people are thankful when their friends try to help them.You can sometimes be a little bit overexcited in your help.Forgive me for feeling cautious.You are forgiven, she said, waving her hand.The fact was, in Connors estimation this would be considered overexcited help.And she knew it.But she also felt as if it was the best way to get things moving.I think we should have a barn raising.Im sorry, did you hit your head and start hallucinating that you lived in a 1950s musical?No.I did not.But the fact is, most of the town was there when the barn burned down.I feel like they would love for this chance to give back to you and help you get back on your feet.I wasnt exactly down on my ass.She crossed her arms beneath her breasts and stared him down.Yes, you were.Not as much lately.He was right; she had not discovered him passed out on the couch once since shed moved in.So that was progress.Do we really need to make it a party?I figured it would be great.I think it would be great for Eli, it would be wonderful for Sadie and it will get your barn off the ground a lot faster.Well discuss it.We will.Were going to discuss it tomorrow, in fact.I already talked to Sadie, and she wants to have me come over tomorrow afternoon for tea and talk of logistics.Tea and logistics?Youre going to do this whether I fucking want to or not, arent you?Yeah, I fucking am, she said, smiling.And you should want me to do it because its smart.And Im smart.And Sadie is smart, and were all smart.So get on and hold on, cowboy.Liss, you are lucky as hell that you buy my groceries.And that youre adorable.Liss ignored the tightening in her stomach.Its true, I am adorable.But I am fierce.And I will have my way.I am familiar with your fierceness.But look, I dont want this to get out of hand.And with the way the barn was originally, Im going to have to have professionals do the finish work.But as far as getting the frame up, the more hands, the better.And I can definitely see your point where that is concerned.Excellent!I love when you can see my very valid, perfectly logical points.Even if it takes you a while.He reached out, and her breath caught in her throat, resting there like a little ball.He reached behind her head and grabbed the end of her ponytail, tugging it gently.Why do your logical points have to be wrapped up in my worst nightmares?He released his hold on her hair, but he was still very close to her.She was having a hard time breathing.Stupid fresh air.It had to be the fresh air.It was too pure or something.I dont mean to be...your worst nightmare, she said, hoping her voice didnt sound as thin and shaky to him as it did to her own ears.You arent my worst nightmare.But your desire to see me socialize is.She nodded, her head feeling a little bit fuzzy now.If she wanted to, she could reach right out and touch his bottom lip.Could trace the outline of it with her thumb.Not that she would.Why would she do that?Why would anyone do that?Why would anyone even think of that?Never mind the fact that it was a very nice bottom lip.Even framed by his beard.Or maybe especially framed by his beard.Really, it was hard to find fault.Better than tracing the outline of it would be tasting it.That thought found her stumbling backward, away from him.Whoa!Connor reached out and grabbed her forearm, tugging her back toward him, obviously afraid she had tripped, rather than rightly guessing that she was scurrying away from him because she had just had a fantasy about licking his face.And suddenly, she was on the exact opposite trajectory from the one she had intended to be on.She was not only closer to Connor than she had been only a moment ago, but her breasts were pressed against his chest.Holy crap.She was dizzy.She should say something.She should break his hold.She should step on his foot and run screaming down the trail back toward civilization.Really, she should do anything but what she was doing.Which was just staying in his hold, resting up against his solidly muscled chest, allowing the heat from his body to wash over her.Are you...okay?he asked, still holding on to her.Yes, she said, swallowing hard.She realized with no small amount of uncertainty that had Jack stumbled back on the trail, Connor would not be holding him to his chest at this moment.She realized that the only reason he was still holding on to her was that she was a woman.Even if she was his friend.She wasnt sure what to do with that information.Obviously, they didnt view each other as genderless.They never had.It wasnt as though they changed in the same locker rooms.But still, this was interesting.And he was still holding her.What would happen if she leaned in?The idea entered her head and stuck.But she didnt do it.She simply froze, waiting.Waiting to see what he would do next.Waiting to see what she would do next.Well, we better keep going if we want to make it to the top.Yes, she said, extricating herself from his hold.Suddenly, she was very conscious of the fact that she had just sort of melted into him, and had spent nearly a full minute lingering.She was also suddenly conscious of just how revealing that was.Stupid.Stupid and dangerous and stupid.Yes, the top.Views, and waterfalls and shit, she said, her tone overly bright.Okay.To the top.Connor turned away from her and started to walk back up the trail, and Liss followed behind trying to get a grip on her sanity.Though she feared, at this point, it might be beyond her reach.CONNOR HAD SERIOUSLY fucked up.There was no doubt about it.He walked into his bedroom and slammed the door behind him, kicking off his boots and leaving them where they landed, moving through to his bathroom.Yeah, he was an idiot.When he had taken a hold of Liss back on the trail, he hadnt been thinking about the thong.Or more specifically about the fact that his best friend was a woman.Which was the crux of the issue.He imagined that her underwear couldve been cotton with full coverage on the ass and little white bunnies printed on the fabric, and it would have had the same effect.Okay, maybe not the exact same effect, but an effect nonetheless.Because it reminded him that she was very much female.With female undergarments.He hadnt touched female undergarments in way too long.He was thinking of them as female undergarments, and if that didnt say it all, he didnt know what would.But now he had held her up against his body, in combination with feeling her underwear.And somehow he was having a barn raising.Yes, somewhere in all of this he had gone wrong.Very, very wrong.He stripped his shirt off and turned the water on in the shower, working at his belt before taking his jeans and underwear off.He was a mess.But then, that was nothing new.It was just suddenly some of his mess was tangled up in Liss, and seeing as she was usually his well ordered sanity, that was a problem.He took a deep breath and thought of that moment on the trail again.How her skin had felt beneath his hands as he caught her, how her breasts had felt pressed up against his chest as he held her tight.And his dick was getting hard.Perfect.His dick had basically been asleep for the past three years.And now he was getting wood over his best friend.Because he had touched her panties, because she lived in his house, because he knew how soft her skin was and because he hadnt gotten laid in three years.He gritted his teeth and stepped into the shower, not caring if the water was hot or cold.Actually, cold might be good.It wasnt cold, and he couldnt bring himself to add to his torture by freezing his balls off.He rested his forearm against the shower wall and leaned his forehead against the tile.What was happening?He had very little in the way of stability in his life, and Liss was a cornerstone of the crumbling foundation he did have.You did not mess that shit up for the sake of a hard on.He turned around and took the bar of soap off the wire rack that still hung around the showerhead, in spite of the fact that he never put anything in it but a bar of Irish Spring, and it had space for all kinds of shampoos and conditioners.He gritted his teeth as he rubbed the soap over his skin, trying to keep himself detached from any of the sensations he was feeling thanks to the slickness of the suds combined with the hot water.It felt good.And it made him want more.Made him want to reach down and take a hold of himself, because damn that would feel nice.But no.His penis didnt deserve nice things.Especially not since it was getting overexcited about Liss.Just thinking her name brought a picture of her into his mind again.Golden eyes looking at him, all wide and surprised, and those breasts...Yeah, they were nice breasts.He was acutely aware of that fact now that he had been in such close contact with them.His cock jerked and he lowered his hand, wrapping his fingers around himself and squeezing tight.Heat tore through him, and he braced himself on the wall, a harsh sound ripping from his lips.How long had it been since hed come?A long time.Pretty much not since the last time hed had sex.And he knew how long that had been.But hed wanted to fantasize about his dead wife.In his mind, that just hadnt seemed right.And hed never been in a space where he felt as if he could fantasize about anyone else, either.Well, want hadnt really come into it.His body had violently rejected both options for sexual satisfaction, and so he had remained unsatisfied.But for some reason, this was working for him.He was so tempted.No one will know.Just do it.Just do it and get back to normal.He did not argue with his internal voice of reason for too long.Mainly because getting off was on the horizon, and he desperately wanted to get off.Just a few minutes of oblivion.A couple of seconds of blank white light were all he felt was good.He hadnt realized until this moment just how badly he missed it.How badly he needed it.So he squeezed himself tighter, running his palm along his hard length, his breath hissing through his teeth.Yeah, this would be fine.He closed his eyes as he continued to touch himself, visions of Liss, Liss as she had been today, how soft her hair had felt, how she had looked at him.And then he went deeper, into those forbidden fantasies he had been fighting since that day in the laundry room.Images of Liss wearing nothing but that thong, the color vibrant against her skin, her coppery hair spilling over her shoulders.She was so pale.Her nipples would be pale, too.His heart was thundering hard, his blood running through his veins.He lowered his head, quickening the strokes of his hand, bracing himself against the shower wall with the other as his release tore through him, raging around inside him like an animal.And for a glorious moment, there was nothing.There was no pain, there was no barn, no responsibilities at all.There was nothing but complete, pure pleasure.And seductive, golden eyes that could only belong to one woman.And he grabbed that moment and held on to it for as long as he could.But as always, damn reality started to crowd in far too soon.And then he was just standing there, bare ass naked with the realization that he had just gotten his rocks off fantasizing about his best friend.Shame crawled over his skin like an army of ants.He turned and shut the water off, grabbing a towel and drying himself off as roughly as possible.He deserved for the towel to scrape off his skin.He certainly didnt deserve to hang out basking in good feelings.He was an asshole.An asshole who was suddenly exhausted.Who still had a barn raising looming in the future, and would have to face his friend at some point in the near future.He sat down on the edge of his bed.He considered going down to the kitchen to get a drink.But there were two problems with that.The first being that Liss might still be up.The second being that if he got even a little bit drunk he couldnt be responsible for what else might happen.For the past three years getting drunk meant one thing, seeking oblivion.But now that his libido seemed to be back in action, getting drunk might mean lower inhibitions and poor decision making, much like it had back in his early twenties.And with Liss in the house, with him this close to the edge...No, no alcohol for him.Fortunately, he was actually feeling tired.Nothing like an orgasm to knock you out.He had forgotten how effective it could be.He had forgotten how good it was.And he was going to forget again.Well, maybe not the orgasm part.But what had gotten him there.That was off limits.Never again.He closed his eyes and let his exhaustion wash over him.He was sleeping now.Everything else could wait until tomorrow.* * * WHEN CONNOR CAME BACK to the house for lunch, he hoped very much to avoid Liss.Because unfortunately, last nights little slipup had not been forgotten about in the cold light of day.On the contrary, it seemed more vivid.His first thought when his eyes had opened that morning had been of Liss in her thong.And then, because it was morning, he had an erection.And his immediate thought had been to take himself in hand, using the image that he now knew was tried and true, while he worked his way toward the kind of oblivion that couldnt be found in the bottom of a bottle.He had not.Because, dammit, he had a moral compass even if it was wonky.So he had gotten into a cold shower, got dressed as quickly as possible and stomped out of the house without eating any breakfast.He was back now, and thanks to the past four hours of hard labor with no breakfast to fuel him up, he was now starving and willing to take a chance of running into Liss.And of course, thirty seconds after walking through the door, he did.She was wearing a loose, low cut gray sweater, with a pink tank top underneath that was peeking out the top, looking a little bit too much like a bra for his liking.Paired with that was a tight fitting black skirt, a pair of textured tights and some knee high boots.It was as if she was trying to kill him.Felicity Foster, in his kitchen, with her Grade A cleavage.Hi, she said brightly.Too brightly in his opinion.It was almost as though nothing had changed between them.And then he realized that as far as she was concerned, nothing had.She had been acting completely normal, even since the underwear incident.He was the one with the issues.The one dealing with hormones that rivaled those of a fourteen year old boy.Hi, he said, probably also too brightly, since he usually lacked brightness altogether.I am actually headed over to Sadies to discuss you.You should come.Is this the tea and logistics thing?Because I dont think I should be involved in that.He started to move away from Liss and edged closer to the kitchen.Yes, it is the tea and logistics.And it is about you and your barn.Also, I have been assured that there will be cupcakes.Not only will there be cupcakes, there will possibly be quiche.He grunted.That is a whole lot of very girlie food.And you want it.Dont bother to deny it.You know, its probably quiche with bacon in it.His stomach chose that very moment to growl.Traitor.Okay, I could use some food.Great.So why dont you walk me over?He gritted his teeth.Sure.He pulled the front door open again and held it for her, waiting for her to get out onto the porch before he followed her, slamming it shut behind them.She tromped down the stairs, obviously oblivious of just how her skirt tightened around her ass.He was not oblivious, dammit.It was as though a veil had been ripped from in front of his eyes.And suddenly, Liss was a woman.With breasts, and a perfect ass and interesting underwear.It was a disaster.Its about time for the oaks to start dropping their leaves, Liss said, kicking at a dried brown leaf on the ground.Yeah, about the time the madrones stop dropping them.If Oregon has one thing, its trees.He grunted.He was not in the space to be making small talk.Really, he was not in the space to be walking through the property with her.He needed to be in avoidance mode.They crossed the little grove of trees that ran between his driveway and the driveway that led back to the Catalogue House.No oak trees here, just thick evergreens.When they reached the end of the road, Connor was shocked again by all that Sadie had done with the place.He didnt come by very often.Usually, when Eli and Sadie were feeling social they came to the main house, and occasionally Connor went to Elis.But he didnt often have occasion to stop by the bed and breakfast.The front yard was perfectly manicured, with little patches of green lawn surrounded by rhododendron, pansies and a whole bunch of other flowers he didnt know the names for.Flowers had been Jessies thing, not his.Even now, something about the sight of little flower beds like this made him want to go get her, so he could show her.Or made him think she must have just been around.And if he went back to the house he would find her on the front porch, wiping the sweat off her forehead and taking off dirty gardening gloves, having just finished planting.It was such a strange feeling, and so persistent once it took hold, that it was hard to shake.Frankly, he preferred the post masturbation shame.Though if he had a choice, he would take neither.He turned his attention away from the flowers and focused on Liss again.On the way she looked when she walked up the stairs.He was officially a bastard.Oh, well.Everyone already thought he was.Might as well embrace it.Liss knocked on the door, and it took only a few moments for Sadie to answer.When she saw him, Sadies blue eyes widened.Oh, Connor, I didnt know you were coming.Is it a problem?No!Im glad you came.Im not!a voice called from inside the house.And Kates here, he said.Yes, she wanted to come and help.And she was already acting as assistant baker.I have a full house.Though everyone is out on a whale watching tour right now.How fun, Liss said, walking inside.Its funny, when you live here you never do half as much as people visiting seem to.Connor listened to them make small talk as they walked through the entryway and into the dining area.There was indeed a decent selection of food on the table, though he maintained that the food on offer was girlie.His sister was sitting at the head of the table, a slice of quiche on a plate in front of her, a dainty little mug with something hot inside sitting next to it.He didnt think he had ever seen Kate with something so feminine that close to her.In spite of her floral cup she was in her usual uniform of plaid shirt and shapeless work jeans, her dark hair in one long braid.His sister was definitely a contrast next to Liss with her skirt, and Sadie with her armful of bangles, long dress and blond hair loose around her shoulders.Part of him worried that being raised by a couple of half civilized men had done Kate a disservice.Another part of him was just glad he didnt have to beat the boys off her with a stick.Go ahead.Grab a plate and a chair, Connor, Sadie said.He complied, sitting in the chair next to Kate.He declined the generous offer of tea, because he was not going to drink out of one of those pansy ass cups.He did not, however, decline the quiche, which did indeed have bacon in it.Thank you so much for agreeing to the barn raising, Sadie said.And it took him a moment to realize she was talking to him.I didnt really agree to anything, he said.I got steamrolled by Liss.Liss snorted.You did not.I dont do that.I dont steamroll.Kate laughed, slapping her hand on the table.Sorry, Liss, but you kind of do.I mean that in a good way.You get stuff done.Well, its a good idea, Liss said, her tone insistent.And I knew you would need pushing.Its...aggressive assistance, is a nice name for it.Steamrolling, he said.Well, however we arrived at this point, with you at my table eating quiche and agreeing, Im thankful, Sadie said.My guests are thrilled at the prospect of being a part of this.So you know this helps me in ways I hadnt even considered.And he really was glad about that.Because Sadie was a good person, and he certainly appreciated all that she had done in Elis life.Great.I just dont want things to get out of hand.Whats out of hand to you?Sadie asked.Anything more than two people and a cooler full of beer, Kate said.His sister was mocking him, but she was pretty close to the truth.I dont know, maybe no sponsors, he said.I already called Ace, Sadie said, speaking as though he hadnt, and he agreed to donate some beer.On tap.Hes too giving, Connor said.Plus, his gesture would attract a hell of a lot of people.Lydia wants to help spread the word, Sadie said, talking about Copper Ridges president of the Chamber of Commerce.We were thinking of touting it as an old fashioned barbecue and barn raising, to help a family who has given so much to the community.Eli has given so much to the community.All I do is play darts and ranch cattle.Look, Kate said, picking at her quiche with her fingers, people love you.Dont ask me why, because I think youre a rather unpleasant cuss.But they do.They want to help.So many people saw the barn burn, and they feel connected to this.Did you take an informal poll?he asked.Well, seeing as I work at one of the towns main hubs, yeah, I kind of did.Or rather, I didnt have to, Kate said, looking defiant.Because people ask about you.They ask about the barn, they ask about the ranch.They want to know how youre doing.Connor shifted in his seat.It wasnt really as if the towns concern surprised him.Everybody had been very concerned about him when Jessie had died.Hed had more casseroles than one man could humanly consume.Yeah, he knew they cared.But he didnt know what to do with all that caring.Because it kind of made his chest tight, and then that made him angry and he just wanted to be left alone.Or drunk.And it was a really bad combination in the end.Being ignored was better than receiving sympathy.Or it had gotten twisted into that in his mind.Dealing with sympathy was hard.It felt as though you needed to be strong and reassuring for the people who showed up at your doorstep with sad eyes and layers of tuna and cheese in a pan.They wanted to know that you were okay, so you had to look okay.They asked if things were getting better.But they wanted only one answer.You couldnt tell them that things were getting worse, because your wife was still buried six feet under the ground, and that wasnt likely to change anytime soon.Yeah, Connor sucked with sympathy.Talking to people is hard, Connor said.Youre talking to us right now, Sadie said.Do I look like Im enjoying myself?he asked, taking another bite of his quiche.If youre not enjoying yourself, you had better spit my quiche out and walk on home, Sadie said.Oh, yeah, cranky man, I have your number.And Im not going to put up with your crap.He grumbled and took another bite of the quiche.I will eat as much quiche as I damn well please.It was Liss who looked at him, sympathy in her golden eyes.Sympathy he did not deserve, considering what he had just done over her image the night before.Connor, I actually do understand that this is hard.Because I know how people used to look at you, and how they look at you now.His throat tightened.What the hell does that mean?It means that before you lost her everybody knew you were strong.They treated you like a man.And now they treat you like something that might break.They look at you like youre a widower.And nothing else.And I know thats a serious pain in the ass, especially because you dont want to feel that way.He gritted his teeth, trying to ignore the way Liss cut right through with the truth, like a precision blade sliding right up under his skin.It really is only because they care, though.So let them care.And show them that youre okay, she said.He nodded slowly.Fine, do what you want.Were going to have caramel apples, Kate said, smiling widely.Sounds festive.You couldnt sound less thrilled, Liss said.I have fillings.Caramel apples are more of an obstacle course than a treat, he said drily.We got a band, Sadie said, almost exploding with her joyousness.Joyousness he did not share.Im getting the feeling that you were going to do this even if I said no.Kate had the decency to look somewhat sheepish.Eli and I were going to outvote you.Damn part owners.You dont even do anything.He was joking.Mostly.Yes, I know family can be a real pain in the ass, Kate said, her tone cheery.Im not going to fight you anymore.I surrender.He held his hands up and earned smiles from all three women.It was a rare thing in his world, to have a woman smile at him.Having three of them do it at once was sort of amazing.As soon as we can get all of the materials we need for the frame, we can have the barn raising.So Im thinking well schedule it for two weeks from now.How does that sound?Sadie asked.Does it really matter what I think, Sadie?No, Liss said.When I die, Im half convinced my gravestone will read here lies Connor Garrett, good intentions were the death of him.Better than wolverines, Kate said.Death by wolverine would suck.That depends, Sadie said.Are we talking Hugh Jackman Wolverine, or flea infested, forest dweller wolverine with the hinky little claws?I was thinking the flea infested, hinky version, but Hugh Jackman would be a pretty decent way to go, Kate said.This has been great, he said, standing up from the table.But I think Im going to go back to work now.Kate stood up and wrapped her arms around him in an uncharacteristic hug.He threw one arm around her shoulders and squeezed.Dont be mad, Connor.I love you.I just wanted to do this because I love you.He took a deep breath, and for some reason it was difficult.Like Kate was squeezing him too tight.But that wasnt it.It was something on the inside.I know, Katie.I love you, too.Okay, lets stop with all this now, she said, pulling away from him and smiling.I can only take so much mushiness.I think my tolerance is even lower than yours.Ill walk you back, Liss said.You trust these two with the rest of the details?he asked.Trust me, Connor, Im a professional, Sadie said.You arent a professional party planner, he said.She shrugged.Yeah, but Im a professional something.Ha ha.Thats very comforting, he said.Bye, Connor.Bye, Liss, Sadie said, clearly eager to get rid of him so she could start figuring out how to hire party clowns, balloon animal artists and other things that were sure to horrify him down to his bones.Behave yourself, he said as he and Liss walked back out onto the porch.She is not going to behave herself, Liss said sagely.She doesnt know how.You, he said, holding his finger out toward her.You started this.She snapped her teeth near the end of his finger, and he lowered it.Do that again and Ill bite it off, she said.Anyway, you deserve this.Why does that sound like an insult and not something positive?Liss smiled.Because its a little bit of both.I ought to send you out to the shed to live.You can nest in all of your stored belongings instead of sleeping in my nice warm house.You wouldnt do that to me, she said, walking past him and starting down the stairs, putting him in direct line of sight with her butt again.Because I am adorable.We went through this already.You keep forgetting that I am not very nice.No, you keep forgetting that you are all bark and no bite.I, on the other hand, have a little bite, as I believe I just proved.That was not a bite.That was a snap.Threats dont count.He walked down the stairs after her, quickly catching up to her on the path.And you were right.I dont know what to do with people.There, I admitted it.You didnt need to admit it to me.I already knew.Its just that I dont really know what to do with casseroles and sympathy.Honestly, I dont know what to do with casseroles.What the hell is that?Why do people bring you food that seems designed to make you sadder?It isnt like people actually make that shit for themselves.Its the designated bereavement food, and its terrible.I lost my wife, not my taste buds.People should bring cake and Jack Daniels.Liss laughed, and he appreciated that.Not very many people would have laughed, because his brand of dark humor tended to make normal people uncomfortable.He made people uncomfortable.I think its just because theyre easy to transport.I dont think its because theyre actively trying to sadden you with their one pot meals.Sure.Nobody is ever trying to actively hurt you.They do a pretty good job, though, dont they?Connor reached up and grabbed a twig off a low hanging branch and snapped it off.Mainly because people make everything about themselves.How your pain feels to them.And what they think you should do with it.I dont think they mean to.Its just that were all really selfish when it comes down to it.And Ive been selfish, God knows.But I feel a little justified.You are.He threw the twig off to the side.I guess I have to try sometime, though, right?To not be a big surly beast?Yeah, probably.He closed his eyes and stopped walking.I just never want to...He opened his eyes.You never want to make other people hurt like you do.So you keep a lot of stuff to yourself.Im not sure its the best.Liss stopped, turning to face him.Connor, you never have to keep things from me.You dont have to protect me.The words were hovering on his lips, words that he had never spoken out loud.But he held them back.Good to know.There was no point in talking about any of it now.No point in telling Liss the secret he had kept for three long years.It was better to just keep it inside.At least there, it would hurt only him.So, he said, changing the subject, if I wanted a dunk tank, could we use you as the victim?I am not going to get in a dunk tank.Not even for you.Come on, Liss, youre ruining the carnival atmosphere.You get in the dunk tank.Its my barn raising.I should not have to get in the dunk tank.Liss laughed and turned away from him, and he followed after her.This felt normal.This did not feel like an interaction he would have with the Liss of his late night fantasies.This was Liss, his best friend.This was just how it should be.LISS LOOKED AROUND at the collection of people who had turned out for the barn raising.She wanted to go around and give each and every person a hug and a kiss, except she wouldnt, because that was gross.And because she really wasnt that much of a toucher.But in spirit, she felt like doing it.While the turnout was not as grand as it had been for the great Fourth of July barbecue a couple of months back, it was still very impressive.A few guys from town had brought out their barbecues and were grilling Garrett beef, hot dogs and veggie burgers.Alison had brought several pies and cakes, while Ace was a one man refreshment machine.Everyone was about to fuel up before the volunteers took to raising the frame.The pad had been cleared, and the pieces assembled and laid out the previous week by the crew Connor had hired to do most of the fine detail work.And today the bulk of the structure would get installed, speeding up the construction.Eli was making his way through the crowd of people, making sure to greet everyone.Out of uniform today, he looked handsome in his black T shirt, jeans and cowboy hat.But, in Lisss opinion, he couldnt compete with Connor.Connor, who was not making the rounds, but was standing near the building materials nursing a beer.He was still rocking his beard, though he had trimmed it a little bit for the event.He was wearing a battered baseball cap, a tight white T shirt that exposed the hard muscles beneath and faded jeans with holes in the knees.Just looking at him made her mouth dry.Made her stomach tight.Made her want things that she absolutely shouldnt want.Living with him was definitely the special kind of torture she had anticipated.In the three weeks since she had come to his house, she had seen him in his underwear only once, but she was coming to realize that Connor in constant doses was dangerous whether he was fully clothed or not.She had thought that maybe being immersed in daily domestic tasks with him would make it all feel commonplace.That was not the case.If anything, the web of intimacy that she had felt caught in that morning she brought him cereal had tightened around them both.Of course, he probably didnt feel it.Because men didnt worry about things like the intimacy of eating cereal.Of course, whether or not men worried about it was moot.Connor just didnt see her that way.He never had.She looked at him again and her heart started to beat faster.How on earth could you be friends with a man for as long as she had been friends with him, and still not be immune to him?Her...attraction, feelings...whatever, had lessened over the years, of course, but they seemed to be intensifying again.She tried not to think about the year when Jessie had gone off to college.She and Connor had both stayed in town, and their bond had intensified during that time.And sometimes shed imagined...But then, when Jessie had come back, Connor had proposed.And shed just felt stupid.And small.And mean.For wishing that her two best friends would break up.For wishing that she could have Connor to herself.For hoping that, while Jessie had been away, the bond between herself and Connor had become strong enough that it would become something more.She was a terrible friend.Fortunately, nobody knew.Just like nobody knew that the night of Jessie and Connors wedding, Liss had snuck onto Garrett property and gone down to the river they had spent so much time at when they were teenagers.Shed sat on the swing, the one Connor had talked her into jumping from on a hot summer day years before, and shed rocked back and forth, inhaling the familiar breeze.Getting used to being alone.Getting used to being without him.Shed gotten drunk on champagne from their wedding reception, still wearing her maid of honor dress, while she cried until her throat hurt.But the next morning, with only her hangover as a companion, shed been certain shed purged her feelings for him from her system.Connor and Jessie were married; the fairy tale was over.She wasnt the princess.That was life.Shed done a damn fine job of believing that.But then Connors happily ever after had gone terribly wrong.The story had changed again.It was all her body, her heart, needed to rekindle the flame.Apparently.And that just made her feel like the biggest dick of all time.As if there was an opportunity open to her because of Connors grief.
