And in that image she was looking at him with wide, sad eyes.Well, this is your fault, anyway, he said, knowing she couldnt hear him.Unsurprisingly, she didnt answer him.But he could still see her in his mind.Those big golden eyes begging him not to drink anymore...for her.And then with a growl, he slammed the glass back down on the counter.He braced his palms flat on the granite, leaning forward, lowering his head.Yeah, the last thing he needed was Liss finding him hungover in the morning and blaming herself.Because she would.Because she was like that.But the alternative was spending the night sober.Considering he had just screwed his best friend and abandoned her, naked and in bed, he imagined he deserved whatever penance there was to be paid.He swore and tipped the contents of the glass over into the sink.Immediately regretting that piece of dumb assery.He couldve at least saved it for later.But apparently, he wasnt thinking clearly tonight.If he ever was.If he ever had.He tightened his fingers over the rim of the glass, lifting it from the counter.He turned toward the cabinet then suddenly decided against putting it away.Because everything was stupid.And his entire life was a mess.So why even bother to keep the kitchen clean?Instead, he released his hold on it and let it crash to the hardwood floor, sending a spray of glass across the pine surface.He would deal with that in the morning.Right now he couldnt give a rats ass.He walked across the kitchen, stepping on remnants of the glass, knowing he would regret that in the morning, too.Right now, though, he didnt care.Mainly because he knew he would have a whole host of regrets in the morning, and all of them bigger than a few pieces of glass in his feet.He walked up the stairs, taking a quick look at Lisss room, and noticed that the door was firmly shut now.For the best.He continued on into his bedroom and slammed the door behind him, lying facedown on the bed, not bothering to get dressed.His head was already starting to pound, which just seemed like adding insult to injury, since he had skipped the alcohol.He closed his eyes tight and spent the rest of the night in that uncomfortable space between gritty eyed exhaustion and unconsciousness.Peppered with images of his brother standing on the front porch, a ring of light all around him, his expression grim.And interspersed with that was the image of Liss, her breasts bare, her name on his lips like a prayer.* * * LISS SAT AT the kitchen table, her eyes feeling like theyd been rubbed with sandpaper, her hands wrapped around a hot cup of coffee.She was simultaneously terrified and praying with intensity that Connor would show up and they would be forced to interact.She took a deep breath, her chest aching as she did.She drummed her fingers on the mug, fighting back a feeling of misery and some tears.Huh.She hadnt really imagined that the culmination of a decade and a half of fantasies would end in her having the sensation of being dipped into a vat of feelings and wrung out to dry.No, when she had imagined all this going down, she had focused decidedly on the physical aspect of it.Right now she wished that she could recapture the simple buzz that had come with the physical side of what had happened.Because right now?Right now it was all feelings.Damn, miserable feelings.She wanted to see him, to try to gauge whether or not they were okay, or if things were terminally weird.She also wanted to avoid him for the rest of her life.Possibly move to Bulgaria, change her name and work in an apple orchard.Those two very strong desires warred with equal force inside her.But since she didnt have a passport she figured hanging out and trying to face this thing head on was probably her best bet.Anyway, Felicity Foster was many things, but a coward wasnt one of them.She heard the front door open behind her then footsteps on the threshold, and she jerked her arms backward, sloshing coffee over the edge of her mug.She rolled her eyes at herself and got up from her seat, making her way over to the paper towels, which had been refreshed since she had moved in.She pulled one off the roll, getting ready to turn around and face both the coffee spill and Connor.But when she turned she came face to face with the only person it could possibly be more horrifying to see right now than the man whose brains she had thoroughly screwed out the night before.His little sister.Good morning, Kate said, walking into the kitchen.Good morning, Liss responded, moving back to the table and awkwardly dabbing at the spill.What brings you by?I have the day off at the Farm and Garden, so I figured I would come grab a coffee and maybe see if Connor needed any help today.Oh, well, I havent seen him this morning, Liss said, her face heating.She had the distinct feeling that she was telegraphing all of her memories from last night straight into Kates brain.All of her X rated memories.The horror of that did not even bear pondering.Thats okay.He was doing something with the fencing today, right?Im not sure, she said, feeling really uncomfortable and a little bit as if she was getting the third degree.It made her feel like a kid with her hand caught in the cookie jar.Or a teenager caught with condoms in her purse.Just wondering.Jack usually comes by to help with things like that.And suddenly Liss felt relieved, because she realized that the line of questioning had nothing to do with her and Connor.Were you hoping to see him?Kates expression went through several different incarnations.Shock, embarrassment and finally disgust.No, not especially.I was just curious.Liss had a feeling Kate was a little more than curious, and she could think of nothing worse besides her own current situation than dear sweet Kate having a crush on the much older, much more experienced Jack.Right.Idle curiosity about the whereabouts of Connors dear friend.She was pushing, mainly because it was better than focusing on her own issues.And as diversionary tactics went, it wasnt a bad one.Idle curiosity about the amount of help Connor was receiving on a project, Kate said, her tone measured.Kate certainly didnt look as though she was out trying to impress a guy.She was dressed in her typical daily wear of extremely untrendy work jeans, a shapeless T shirt tucked into the waistband and a belt with a silver buckle.Her dark hair was restrained in a braid, a cowgirl hat firmly in place on her head.As far as Liss knew, Kate did not own makeup of any kind, and she had never seen evidence to the contrary.Still, she wondered.Well, Im very sorry that I cant answer the question.Because I havent seen Connor, Eli or Jack today.I have seen coffee, and thats about it.I would like to see some coffee, Kate said, obviously letting her subtle Jack accusations go.Feel free, she said, smiling back.Kate was like a little sister to her, which meant she felt at liberty to give her some grief.Up until recently, she would have lied and said that Connor was like a brother to her.She wouldve been very aware of the fact that it was a lie, but she would have tried it all the same.But now she wouldnt even be able to pretend.Because now it would be creepy.She heard the front door open again, and this time it was Connor who came walking into the kitchen, freezing when he saw both her and Kate standing there.Great, the only thing that could be more awkward than Connor walking in earlier was Connor encountering her for the first time in the broad light of day with Kate there.Good morning, he mumbled, crossing the kitchen and heading toward the coffeemaker.Morning, she and Kate said in unison.Are you doing the fence today?Kate asked.Yep, Connor said, bypassing Kate and grabbing a mug, taking the carafe from the coffeemaker before Kate could and pouring himself a cup.Do you need help?I could always use an extra pair of hands, he said.Great, Kate said.Im happy to do it in exchange for coffee.After I have some.He finished pouring his cup and walked back to the table, his expression contorting when he put weight on one of his feet.Are you okay?Liss asked.Connor gave her a measured look.Im fine.Why are you limping?Kate asked.Connor shot her a deadly glare.I stepped on a nail.Luckily, my tetanus is up to date.Liss frowned.Are you okay?I already said I was, he answered, clearly in a vile temper.Great.Fine for him to be in a mood.He was the one who had stormed out last night after theyd had sex.He was the reason she felt so teary this morning.He had no right to be grumpy.She was grumpy.The stupid thing was, it wasnt even surprising that he had done that.It was a classic Connor move.He was not the kind of guy who talked about his feelings, and yet last night he had started talking about them.Logically, she knew he was hardly going to cuddle with her after doing something that made him feel so exposed, so uncomfortable.But dammit, whether she understood or not, it still hurt.Yeah, Connor, Kate said, you seem totally fine.Like always.By which I mean you seem like a jackass.Connor gave Kate a look that could only be categorized as deadly, but Kate didnt seem to notice.She was busy getting her coffee, and probably thinking she was just dealing with normal everyday grumpy Connor.Liss knew differently.Liss knew that Kate was treading on dangerous ground.However, jumping in to save Kate might put her in the line of fire, and she wasnt sure if she wanted to do that or not.Mercenary, perhaps.But she wasnt all that concerned about it at the moment.Watch it, Connor said.Kate crossed her arms, her expression fierce.Or maybe you lighten up and stop acting so much like a guy who just peed into a live electric fence.Stay out of this, Katie.Dont.Call me that.Kates eyes were glittering fiercely now.Stop being such a baby and get out there and fix my fence.First of all, I own one third of that fence, you raging asshole.Second of all, I dont have to be here helping you.Its my day off, Kate said, her cheeks flushed red.And third of all.She held up her middle finger and said nothing else.Go home, then, he said.Kate scrunched up her face, took a sip of coffee and set it down on the table with a mighty thump.No.See you out at the fence line.She turned on her heel and stormed out of the kitchen.All things considered, Liss was not surprised that she had still opted in to fence work.And if she was right about Kates Jack feelings, all she could do was feel sorry for her.Because she knew all about harboring feelings for someone who would never return them.Though in Kates case, it was for the best if Jack never looked twice at her.Because as bad bets went, he was like going all in on a pair of twos.Of course, Connor was a close second.So she supposed she should probably work on her own issues, rather than focusing on someone elses.But it was a lot more fun, and less crazy making, to focus on someone elses.What was her problem?he asked.You.You were her problem, Liss said.Connor grunted.She shouldnt be this annoying this early.And maybe you shouldnt treat her like shes fifteen.But thats a different conversation.Is it a different conversation?We could have it now.You mean instead of the one we should have?Connor looked up from his coffee, his expression baleful.Pretty much.How long do you think we can avoid it?Id give it another ten minutes.For the caffeine to hit my system.What happened to your foot?I told you I stepped on a rusty nail.And for some reason I dont believe you.She didnt know why; she only knew she didnt.Fine.I broke a glass.And I stepped on the broken glass.Liss frowned, a growing feeling of unease rolling over her like fog.How did you manage that?Not pouring myself a drink last night.Okay, well, I did pour myself one.But then I dumped it out.I didnt drink it.Suddenly, Lisss eyes felt prickly.Well, thats good.Right.Glad you think so.You dont?I dont know.Progress, I guess.But you know, I slept like hell.Alcohol probably wouldve helped.Staying with me might have helped, too.She shouldnt have said that.It sounded needy, which was fair, because she felt needy, but she should have played it a little bit more cool.Couldnt, he said, lifting his mug to his lips and taking a sip.Really, she should not expect more out of Connor than one word answers.But unfortunately, she wanted more out of him than that.Because it was one thing to accept being shut out of his emotional storage locker as a friend.But as a lover?Yeah, but are you really his lover?Good question.Maybe one night of sex didnt make her a lover.Really, it wasnt fair for her to want things to change in some ways, when she desperately wanted to believe that one night of sex wouldnt change other things.She imagined it wasnt something you could cherry pick.Which just sucked.She wanted to cherry pick, dammit.She wanted a customizable menu of options with boxes she could check.Access to his finer feelings?Check.Awkward self consciousness?No.A solid, unshakable friendship?Check.Crippling loneliness and despair?No.Consequence free orgasms on tap?She would double check that.She had a feeling, however, she would not be getting any of those things.Except the things she didnt want.Those she would probably get.Because life was a superhelpful bitch like that.Right, she said.Probably shouldve just grabbed your penis again instead of trying to talk about feelings.Connor sputtered, coffee sloshing over the edge of his mug.What the hell, Liss?You cant just say stuff like that.Now is not really the time to get precious.The horse has left the barn, run across the pasture and trampled the daisies.If you go after him now, hell just get spooked and kick you in the head.Come to think of it, I do feel a little bit like Ive been kicked in the head by a horse.Which just reinforces my theory that I probably should have just gotten drunk last night.Instead of having sex with me?She was just digging herself in deeper and deeper.I meant...after the sex.Probably, though, your idea is better, and I should have just gotten drunk before we had sex instead of having sex, because then we wouldnt be having this discussion now.Wow.Youre really good for my self esteem.Come on, Liss.He sighed, a heavy, defeated sound.I needed last night.Im not going to lie to you.But I have no idea what it gave to you.And theres really nothing...beyond what happened that I can offer to make it more for you.Who said I needed more?I think its pretty obvious what I got out of it.The same thing you did.I dont...I did not have sex with you under sufferance, Connor.I wanted to.I liked it.I got orgasms, and really good oral sex and skin to skin contact out of it.And youre not sure why I enjoyed it?Well, its just that youre a woman...Whoa.Put that truck in reverse, cowboy.Im worried about your emotions.She let out a sharp, one note laugh.Oh, my emotions!I forgot about those somewhere around the time I was screaming your name.Not just your emotions.Im worried about our friendship.But I feel like a massive jerk seeing as Im basically using you for therapy.I thought I agreed to that.He dragged his hand over his face and let out another long, drawn out sigh.You did.But that doesnt make me feel any better about it.After the fact.Which is very convenient.Nothing about this is convenient, he said, shouting now.Well, this was going worse than she had imagined it might.Which was really saying something, because her imagination was not overly optimistic.Good.I dont want to be convenient sex.Congratulations.You arent.Youre the most inconvenient sex I have ever had.What, you are...You are just...the most post orgasmically grumpy human being on the face of the planet.Being this unpleasant after getting some that was that good is a real commitment to being an asshat.Im good with commitments.Long commitments.Marriage.Being a jackass.Its kind of my wheelhouse.Oh, go build your barn.Im working on the fence today.The crew is coming by later to deal with the barn.Whatever.Just get out of here.Im trying to drink my coffee, and you are ruining it.This is my kitchen.For the time being it is our kitchen.I live here, too.If you want equal share, you need to pay at least half of the mortgage, he said.Well, no, thank you.Somehow, I thought that would be a deterrent.I think Ill stay in my kitchen for a while, all things considered.She picked up her coffee mug and raised it in salute.You do that.I did a lot of thinking last night.Sometime after I stepped on the glass and before I got up this morning.And then a little bit more thinking when I walked on cut feet out to the barn.And?He took a deep breath, his dark eyes meeting hers.We cant do that again.Her stomach withered and sank into her toes like a dried out leaf falling from a tree.Oh?Ive lost too much.And you know, the reasons we did it still stand.You were right.I was building it up to be something huge in my head.It was like a mental block.And now Ive pushed past it.So...you pushed past your mental block...with the help of my vagina?Dammit, Liss.Im trying to be sincere.Im just trying to figure out what exactly is happening between us.Nothing.Nothing new.So you can just forget?You can just pretend that you never saw me naked?You can just pretend that you never...you know, all those things you did?Everything we did?Im not going to forget.I wont forget.But I still think we need to draw a line under it and call it done, he said, his tone firm, authoritative.She wasnt used to him being like this.Decisive, commanding.It was hot.Which was completely inconvenient, since he was currently telling her that they were not going to do the sex thing anymore.Which meant his being more of a turn on was not okay.I. ..And she realized she was standing in the mans kitchen, barefoot and wearing pjs, about to beg him for more sex.She had never felt sorrier for herself.And that included when she had returned her prom dress.And also the moment she had found out that the man she had lived with, supported, made lackluster love to for years, had stolen her identity then gotten the hell out of Dodge.Yes, realizing that you were on the cusp of begging your best friend for more sex while wearing sheep festooned flannel pants was a new low.What, Liss?I think youre right.Even though she didnt.About?If this is the end result of what happened last night, were not doing it again.Whatever has been happening the past couple of days...I just think it accomplished what we needed it to.I was...well, not back in the game after Marshall.And obviously you werent.And now we kind of broke the wall down, like you said, before I got all gross.She took a deep breath, trying to keep her voice from shaking, trying to keep from crying.Weird that she felt like crying.Weird that this felt like the end of something.But it wasnt really anything.Their friendship, all eighteen years of it, that was something to protect.One night of sex should hardly show up on the radar.They were getting back on track.They were putting things back the way they should be.It wasnt really a change.And it shouldnt be sad.Im glad were on the same page.He looked slightly shocked, as though he had not expected her to agree quite so quickly.The same side of the bed, so to speak.She didnt know why she was trying to make the conversation more awkward.Apparently, it was her natural instinct.No wonder shed been single for two years.Or in agreement, in different bedrooms.Since that is what we are agreeing on.She took a deep breath.Connor, Im sorry if I added confusion to what I know has been a seriously effed up few months.Months?Try years.Sure.But I want to help you.And you cant keep going the way you have been.I know.And now Ive changed some things.Had sex.Started building a barn.Nice to know Im on par with barn building.She winced.Sorry, I should probably stop mentioning the thing that we did that we arent going to do again.Like I said, Im not going to forget that it happened.I dont think theres any point in pretending it didnt happen.Unless were in front of the others.A shiver of horror wound through her.They must never know.Never.That, she could agree to with no reservation at all.I had better go get to work.Yeah, probably.I imagine Kate is out there ordering Eli and Jack around like shes the foreman.Connor rolled his eyes.Likely.She waved a hand.Intervene.He looked at her hard, too hard for her liking, because she had a feeling he was seeing a layer or two deeper than skin.Down to all of her vulnerabilities and bare, fragile emotions.Are you going to be okay?She forced a smile, fully aware that it stopped well short of her eyes.Ill be fine.I need to reorient is all.Yeah, well...last night was...intense.And we dont usually do intense, Liss said, rocking back on her heels.No.And I havent done intense at all in a while.I think I maxed myself out and...shut down.Kind of...hibernation or something.But yeah, less of that now.He offered her a smile in exchange for hers.Just as manufactured and superficial as the one shed given him.She tried to feel happy for him.That last night had been some sort of transcendent experience as far as he was concerned.Therapy by orgasm.But it was hard when she was feeling so damn sad for herself.Last night was less transcendent for her and more a weird, very final confirmation of the fact that she was destined to forever feel more and different for Connor than he did for her.She wasnt sure what she felt for him, but it was somewhere past simple friendship.Not like either of the romantic relationships shed had in the past, either, but then, that wasnt too surprising.Over the past three years shed been helping him glue his life back together, making sure he was functional, getting his groceries, that shed stepped into a different role in his life than the one shed grown up in.Shed become more like a wife without the benefits.And without the love.That thought had a sharp point on it, and it stabbed straight through her skull and down into her chest, hitting her heart.She did her best to ignore it.To make eye contact with Connor and to try not to look as though she was having some sort of emotional meltdown.Great, she said.She could feel the inadequacy of the word as it hit the air and went flat.But she couldnt find it in her to add to it.To try to dig deeper and say something encouraging when she frankly felt like shit and wanted to crawl beneath a fuzzy blanket for the rest of the day and hide.As it was her day off, she could if she wanted to.And she just might.She needed to watch Sense and Sensibility.And maybe find out if Alan Rickman wanted to come and marry her to rescue her from her wayward feelings.All right, then.Ill catch you later.He turned and walked out of the kitchen, and Liss sagged against the wall, unable to prevent an epic whining sound from escaping her lips.Shed been so caught up in what it would be like to make love with Connor that she hadnt spent nearly enough time imagining what it would be like after she made love with Connor.Though, even if she had spent time thinking about it, she doubted she could have possibly guessed how horrifying it would really be.But she was living it now.So she would just have to deal.But for a while she would be dealing with it from beneath a fuzzy blanket.So for a few hours at least, it might not seem so bad.CONNOR FELT...RESOLUTE, if not better.He had made his decision, and he stood by it.By it, behind it, in front of it.Basically, he had a whole fence around the decision so that it couldnt escape and flee off into the wilderness, leaving him with no decisiveness and a hard on that wouldnt quit.Because, even though he knew it was the right decision, it wasnt the one hed wanted to make.No, the one his body wanted to make was the one that would see him back in bed with Liss, her legs wrapped around his hips as he sank deep inside her.But that was the wrong choice.So his body didnt get a vote.He straightened, pushing his hat back and looking around.Eli was leaning against a post, drinking a cup of coffee.Kate was down the fence line with Jack, holding a wire straight while he worked something with a pair of pliers.It was an overcast day, gray clouds rolling over the caps of the mountains, lowering the sky so that everything felt a little bit more closed in.This kind of weather suited Connor just fine when he was doing heavy labor.The cool, damp air refreshing rather than freezing, since they were out there working their asses off.Normally, a project like this helped him exhaust his body until it was numb.Which he usually only needed to help with the loneliness, the sadness and the general soberness he went about his day in until he was able to reach for a little alcohol at the end of the day to help him out.But he was trying not to drink.And really, sadness and loneliness werent his issues right now.It was the fact that his libido was suddenly wide awake.And hungry.There was a whole hibernating bear analogy in there, he was sure of it.Actually, that applied across the board.Something about dealing with the barn, breaking through the barrier of lust and sex, putting down the bottle and just dealing with things was making him feel a lot more awake in general.Too bad doing things had consequences.That was one point in favor for lying around being a drunk.The only consequence you had to deal with was the hangover.And what he was dealing with now was a lot more complex.Complex, emotion type things.And he didnt like that.But the alternative was essentially sinking into the same kind of pattern his dad had been in.Hell, hed pretty much been there.And now, with the benefit of it being in hindsight, he could see that.He had been excusing it, since he had been getting the ranch work done.But he hadnt gotten anything else done, and he imagined a sad drunk was a sad drunk as far as family and friends were concerned, whether he did his ranch work or not.Everything going okay down there?Eli asked.Fine, Connor said, realizing his answer had come out somewhere between a grunt and a growl.He was going to have to work on that, too.Since he was working on things.Making decisions, and having normal human interaction and shit.Almost done.There, the last part of that sounded a little bit friendlier.Whats on the schedule for the rest of the day?Eli asked.Ill probably see whats going down with the barn.The crew should be by later today.A lot of it is finish work that I cant contribute much to.But I should at least go check it out.Do you think it will be done by election night?Connor laughed.Just asking out of idle interest?No, Im asking out of selfish interest, Eli said, crossing his arms over his chest.At least youre honest.Hey, it feels like a lot is riding on the election.I mean, if I dont win I still have a job I love, and I still have a position in the community.But I would never have started running if it didnt mean something to me.If I didnt feel like I was the best man for the job.You are the best man for the job, Connor said.He had always thought that, but he had never said it.Because sincerity was hard for him; because tapping into any kind of real emotion was hard for him.But Eli deserved to hear it.Eli offered him a half smile.Thanks.And my offer to paint your face on my chest and direct voters to check the appropriate box stands.One too far.Connor grinned, actually feeling it a little bit.I have limited skills.But I could do that.If we were going to strip anyone down and use sex to sell my campaign, it would be Jack, Eli said.I heard my name and sex, Jack said, walking up to where they were standing.Not too unusual, but I am curious.Should I leave?Kate was standing a little bit behind Jack, barely visible, peering around his shoulder.No, we arent actually going to pimp Jack out for Elis campaign, Connor said.Why not?I would probably do it, Jack said.That is probably not the best way for me to start my political career.You have to wait a couple of years to get involved in sex scandals, Eli said.If you ever do get involved in a sex scandal, it will probably be somehow related to your association with Jack, Kate said.And Sadie will have to stand behind you at a press conference looking grave.Maybe its time to defriend Jack.You arent getting rid of me that easily, Katie, Jack said, turning to face Kate.Im what you call a fixture.It would be harder to get me off Garrett land than it would be to uproot a stump.Im pretty handy with a winch and a tractor, Monaghan, Kate said, her expression fierce.If anyone could uproot your ass, I could.But why would you want to?Jack asked, turning on that charm of his that seemed to get him anywhere and everywhere he wanted to go in life.Let me count the ways, Kate said.Stop trying to scare my friends off, Connor said.I have two.Of course, he had done a fairly good job of alienating the other one.But he was trying to fix that.By not undressing her again.Maybe choose better friends, she said, her words cut off when Jack put his hand over her face.Jack!Her shout was muffled.Katie is no longer available for comment, Jack said, smiling broadly.If only it were that easy, Connor said.For the second time that day he earned a one finger salute from his younger sister.At least this one seemed a little bit more good natured than the one in the kitchen.So it was possible all was forgiven.Now, if only things with Liss could be smoothed over quite so easily.Jack hissed and pulled his hand away from Kates face.Dammit, Katie!You bit me.You face palmed me.Son of a bitch.You left teeth marks.Jack looked at Connor, and Connor shrugged.In his estimation, any guy who was dumb enough to try to pull shit with Kate had swift retribution coming.He was protective of Kate, but truth be told, she mainly protected herself.Okay, she said brightly, ignoring Jacks evil eye.We have one more section to finish shoring up.So maybe we should get back to work.Who died and made you foreman, Kate?Eli asked.In the absence of adequate leadership, someone has to rise to the occasion, she said, crossing her arms and giving them a smart ass smile.Or, in the absence of leadership, we can skip work and go get a hamburger, Jack said.Hamburger after work, Kate said resolutely, turning around and heading back toward the section of the fence she and Jack had been working on earlier.I should go help her, or shell put a rattlesnake in my boots.Or bite my ankle herself, Jack said, turning and following after Kate.Do you want to go check out the barn while we let them finish the less desirable work?Connor asked Eli.Absolutely, he said.* * * A DAY OF HIDING beneath a blanket had not done much to defuse the feelings that were rioting through Liss.She had done nothing but sit in bed wearing woolen socks, drinking warm beverages and watching saccharine movies, and, unsurprisingly, she did not feel better.She felt cozy, but slightly stale, and as twilight settled over the scenery outside, more than a little bit maudlin.Because her greatest fantasy had come to screaming, sweaty life, and it had been everything she had ever wanted and more from a physical standpoint.But it had left her feeling hollowed out emotionally.Now it was over, never to be repeated.And it just didnt feel like enough.Actually, that was the worlds biggest damn understatement.It was like the incredible crash that came after Christmas morning.If Christmas only came once in eighteen years and then promised to never come again.She let out a heavy sigh and flopped backward, one of her throw pillows just under the center of her spine.She contorted her expression, reached underneath herself, grabbed the edge of the pillow and yanked it out, throwing it across the room.Everything was against her and her comfort.She let out a long, drawn out groan and then rolled over onto her stomach.She lifted her head slightly, pitifully, and looked over at her nightstand.There were four mugs on it.Representing the progression of the day.One that had contained coffee, one that had contained tea, one that had contained cocoa and then another coffee mug from when she had gone into the kitchen, forgotten the first mug and been too lazy to correct the error.You are a pathetic creature, Felicity Foster, she said to the emptiness of her room.But what could she do?And how could she be anything but pathetic?She had peaked.Fantasy wise, anyway.And she was currently living with the man who had peaked her fantasies.And then crashed her fantasies.She rolled off the bed and stood up, scrubbing her hands over her face.Then she walked over to the window and looked outside.She could see the line of pine trees that stood sentinel along the yard, separating Connors home from Elis, Kates and the rest of the ranch.And she could see the porch, the light on, casting the lawn in a yellow glow.She was as familiar with this house, with this property, as she had been with her own former house.Very few things had changed over the years, and ironically, in this house that seemed so unchanged, her relationship with Connor had changed past the point of no return.And they were trying to return.Because it was what Connor wanted.She frowned.She didnt want that.And she hadnt fought for anything else, for anything more.Because she was so used to being accommodating that it had just never even occurred to her.What Connor wanted was what she had agreed to.Just the idea of asking for something more had seemed like begging to her.Had seemed sad and pitiful rather than a reasonable thing.Why did she do that?Why did she think what she wanted shouldnt matter?That it was wrong somehow?Stupid question; she knew why she did that.She did that because every single person in her life whom she cared about always made her feel as if she had to earn her spot.Except for Connor.Connor had never done that.She moved closer to the window, pressing her forehead against the glass and letting out a long breath, fogging up her view.She was so tired.Her relationship with her mother made her tired; the fact that she had spent years in a relationship with Marshall made her tired.The fact that she had been acting the part of Connors wife, while getting nothing of the good part in return, for the past three years, made her tired.And the worst part was, she had no one to blame but herself.Shed established these behaviors; shed continued in these behaviors.Connor hadnt asked her to take over his grocery shopping, to bring him dinner.She hadnt been married to Marshall; she could have walked out the door at any moment, or rather shown him the door at any moment.She could have told her mother that guilt trips werent going to work.But she hadnt.Because she had not wanted to risk it.And where had that gotten her?Here.Here in this exact moment.This exact, unhappy moment, staring down a future where sex with Connor was done, and never happening again.Well, forget that.She pushed back away from the window and took a couple of steps toward the center of the room, breathing hard.She wanted more.She wasnt done.She walked over to the door and opened it, making her way down the hall, down the stairs and into the living room.Connors boots were by the door, which meant he was home.Or out running barefoot in the field.But she would put her money on him being home.At that exact moment, he came walking in from the kitchen.Hey, he said, stuffing his hands into his pockets, his expression both adorable and sheepish.The muscles on his forearms flexed, her eyes drawn, yet again, to his tattoo.Seeing it now felt kind of poignant.Also, still sexy.That was the power of her attraction to Connor.Hi, how was work?Good.The barn is looking good, he finished lamely.How was your day?Oh, you know.I sort of spent the day lying around in my room.Dealing with things of the emotional variety.He winced and pulled one of his hands out of his pockets, rubbing the back of his neck.Right.You okay?Yeah, she said.Just...processing.I did a little bit of that today myself.But you know, it works best for me when Im outdoors.Your method is probably healthier.Mine involves pastries and a lot of warm drinks.Im not sure I do anything more emotionally healthy than you do.Maybe if I drink more hot chocolate I would be in a better space?All things are possible with cocoa.Provided you have marshmallows.Obviously.Liss took a deep breath, gearing up to say what she was thinking, then decided against it.Probably this wasnt the best moment to tell him that she would really like to keep going with the physical side of their relationship.Not when he was dirty from working on the ranch all day, exhausted.Not when there was still this much awkwardness between them.Yeah, but that isnt going to just go away.And hes an idiot to think it will.Thinking of Connor as an idiot cheered her slightly.Anyway, it was true.Do you have any serious Sunday plans?she asked.Not really.Eli and Kate will probably come for dinner, and Ill do the regular ranch stuff in the morning.But your afternoon is free?I feel like youre leading me somewhere, Liss.I am.I was wondering if you wanted to go on a hike down to the swimming hole.Its too cold to swim.Im not in the mood to freeze my ba Much to Lisss surprise, color darkened Connors cheeks, and he cleared his throat and redirected.Im not in the mood to swim in an ice bath.His sudden discomfort with saying the word balls in front of her was exhibit A for the case she was mounting.Things were not back to normal.Not having sex would not put them back to normal.I dont want to swim.I want to hike.I want to eat and look at scenery.She rocked back on her heels, her hands clasped behind her back, a bit of guilt tightening her chest.She was scheming.And she was being dishonest.But it was for the greater good.Or something.Well, that sounds fine.Do you want me to see if anyone else wants to come?No!Her answer came out a little bit too quick and a little bit too emphatic.I mean, I think it would be nice for us to do something.His eyes narrowed.Okay.What?Dont look at me like that.Like what?Like youre afraid Im going to jump on you and violate your person.She wasnt going to jump on him; she was going to talk to him and use rational points to lay out why they should in fact continue on with the physical relationship.Completely different.Now, if that failed, she might jump on him.He cleared his throat.I did not look at you like that.You did!She held her hands up and curled her fingers in, making little claws.Im not that scary.He reached out and grabbed one of her fingers, squeezing it tight and shaking it gently.Scary.The contact sent a rush of heat through her body, and she jerked her hand away, taking a step back, hoping he couldnt tell that she was blushing.Good grief.You would think she was a teenage girl dealing with her first crush, and not a woman in her thirties who had seen loves first bloom wither and die a couple of times at this point.I promise not to scare you.Except, she was sort of lying.Because she might very well scare him.But do you promise to bring hot chocolate and marshmallows?Because now that youve mentioned it, I want some.That can be arranged.Okay, then.Sounds like a good plan.They both stood there, lingering awkwardly, silence filling the space between them and forcing the awkwardness to expand.I need a shower.Right.She fought against the mental images of Connor, naked and wet, for a full thirty seconds before she just went ahead and let her imagination have a field day.Enjoy that.I will.He walked past her and back up the stairs.And she let out a breath she wasnt aware she had been holding.Her plan might be a little bit evil, but it had to be better than this.Because if everything went according to her plan, she could have Connor again, and it might even fix some of what seemed to be broken between them now.Anything was better than this.CONNOR HAD SOME reservations about disappearing into the woods with Liss.Especially considering that his resolutions were on a shaky foundation at present.When hed tried to go to sleep at night his dreams had been plagued, not by images of his brother standing on his porch, but by images of Liss, lying next to him in bed, her body bare, pale, highlighted by the moonlight filtering in through the window.And when he woke up, he was alone.Still, he couldnt cancel on her.Because that would require honesty.And he didnt want to give honesty on that score.Not even a little bit.Well, it didnt require honesty.But he would feel kind of like a dick if he didnt give it to her.Especially since she had gone out of her way to be honest with him.Yesterday she hadnt put on a brave face and pretended everything had gone back to normal.She had admitted that it was a rough day, and it was more than he would have been inclined to do.He ran his hand over his hair and put a baseball cap on, walking out of his bedroom and shutting the door hard behind him before heading down the stairs.His heart hit the back of his breastbone hard when he saw Liss, standing in the entryway holding a picnic basket, wearing a fluttery, floral dress that went down just past her knees and a pair of brown, lace up boots.Her rich, coppery hair was pulled back, a few strands escaping the confines, framing her face.As far as he could tell, she wasnt wearing makeup, but there was something sexier about that just now.Maybe because it left her skin bare, exposed to him.Get a grip, Garrett.You go three years without sex and suddenly everything gets you hard because a chick actually touched you?It was a hell of a lot more than that, but minimizing it seemed like it might help.It didnt, but he had thought for a brief shining moment that it might.Youre ready, he said, because if all you could think about was your friends bare skin, you were better off saying something inane.Yes, I am.Positively laden with foodstuffs.Good, he said, continuing down the line of inane comments, because Im hungry.A spark of tension crackled between them, the dual meaning in his words impossible to miss.Dammit.Would conversation ever not be loaded between them?Or would he be doomed to think of the sexual every time he said something innocuous?Liss didnt seem to notice.And if she did, she didnt care.Good, she said, a smile curving her lips.She turned and opened the front door, walking out onto the porch.And his eyes were glued to the way her skirt hem swished with each step, revealing a little bonus leg each time.Liss had always been in possession of a great set of legs.But now those legs had been wrapped around his waist.As a result his admiration had a slightly different context.He wrenched his damn dirty eyes away while she took the stairs.And he knew her skirt rode up even more as she did.It was costing him to play the part of gentleman right now.Costing him dearly.Connor decided to focus on the scenery rather than Lisss legs.It was certainly safer.If not more satisfying.They walked through the line of trees that separated his portion of the property from Elis, and they made their way along the dirt driveway that ran past where the barn was being constructed, and past one of the vast, fenced off fields that contained the livestock.It was a gray afternoon, mist hanging in the air, thick with salt from the sea, casting a dull shade over the green around them.The clouds hanging over the pine trees made them look as though theyd been wrapped in cotton.Like department store Christmas decorations stuck down into the landscape.The old barn, the one that had been in use back when Connor was a kid, came into view, and Liss took a right past the dilapidated structure.The path that ran through the field here was still well worn and familiar.They had taken it down to the river all the time when they were kids.Hot summer days always made more bearable by a quick dip in the water.Days made more bearable by escaping the house, his fathers drunken slurs and the empty liquor bottles that littered the floor for most of the day.Until Eli was able to get Kate to bed, so he had a chance to clean up.A whole host of memories hit him as they wandered down this path.They had spent a lot of time down here during their high school years.When a lot of their peers had opted for bonfires and beach parties, their small, close knit group had chosen instead to do their underage drinking on Garrett land.Not Eli, obviously, ever the upstanding citizen.Though he had always come, looking over his shoulder nervously as Jack passed beer around.And Liss had been there, of course.Jessie, too.It hit him then that he hadnt been back here since before Jessie died.He didnt know why he hadnt realized it last night.It was one of the many places, including the stretch of road shed died on, that hed eliminated from his geographical vocabulary.This wasnt one of the particularly weighty ones, just a place with happy memories hed preferred never to confront.His stomach tightened as they entered into the grove of trees that grew along the riverbank, stepping around creeping blackberry vines as they made their way closer to the water.He half expected to see a ghost down at the rivers edge, but when they came to the sandy bank there were no apparitions.It was just him and Liss.And it was just now, not the past.The water moved slow here, the surface of it nearly still, smooth like a green glass bottle.The rope swing theyd used back in the day was still there, tied to a tree limb that stretched out over the river.Theyd spent a lot of lazy days here.Days when hed allowed himself to relax and be a kid, a luxury for him and Eli, since theyd been working men raising a child for most of their teenage years.Picking up the slack their father couldnt, because he was lost in his pain.It made him ache to be here.Not the bad kind.In a wistful, bittersweet way.He avoided certain places and memories of the past for this very reason.But right now...right now he felt pretty happy to be here.Its been too long since weve been down here, Liss said.Yeah, it had been.And now that he was here, he knew avoiding it hadnt been necessary.Or at least it wasnt anymore.Im starving, he said.Was that a hint?she asked, a smile tugging at her lips.It was a hint that he was tired of thinking about the past.And ready to eat some of the feelings that were rioting around inside him.They werent all bad feelings, but there was a lot of them.A damn lot.Liss set the basket down on a moss covered rock, bending at the waist, yet again giving him an unintentional and illicit showing of her legs.This time he didnt look away.He was having a weak moment.Year.Lifetime.She opened the basket and took a patterned blanket off the top, unfolding it and spreading it out on the sand.Then she took out a few colored bowls with lids that she must have brought from her house when she moved in, because he certainly didnt have anything like that intact.A few scattered lids that went with nothing.Which had not concerned him for a while, since he didnt really keep actual food in the house, either.She set the bowls down on the blanket and gestured at the spread.Have a seat.Dont mind if I do, he said, settling down on the blanket, dampness from the sand seeping through and into his jeans.He didnt really mind that, either, because it was so nice to have someone do something like this for him because they wanted to, and not because he was sad or hungover.At least, he was going to pretend that was why.This wasnt casserole.This was a picnic.And this was different.Liss sat down beside him, pulling one of the largest bowls onto her lap and taking the lid off.There was a small knife inside, berries and peaches.Did you bring me out here to kill me?She grinned at him, holding the paring knife up.I would need something a lot bigger to take you down, Garrett.Though it would be effective on parts of you.Too far, he said.Is it?she asked, her smile widening.I dont feel like Ive gone too far yet.Yeah, because none of your body parts have been threatened.You better be slicing peaches.She arched a brow.That could be taken two ways.Stop, he said, feeling uncomfortable, like he had yesterday when hed just about said balls in front of her.Which was dumb, because he had said a whole lot crasser things to her over the years.But now that they had actually been naked together, every comment seemed a lot more pointed.And seemed to hit him in the gut, low and hard, making heat spread through his veins.Okay, she said, looking all innocence and light as she wrapped her hand around a peach and pulled it out of the bowl, sliding the edge of the blade through the skin, a bead of juice breaking through and running down her arm.She switched hands and lifted her arm to her mouth, running her tongue along the wet line left behind by the juice.He felt the impact of the movement as though she had run her tongue along his skin.It was such a sensual thing to see.And he could hardly be bothered beating himself up for feeling that way.Because he was only human.Only a man.With a newly reinvigorated sex drive.And she had run her tongue over his skin.Intimately.The only woman to ever do that...And he really needed to redirect his thinking now.She went back to the task of dividing the peach into equal sections, throwing the pit into the water and disturbing the surface, creating ripples that expanded slowly and blurred the reflection of the trees.She took another peach out of the bowl, and she lingered over slicing that one, too.It took him a moment to realize that they were just sitting there in silence, and that he was watching her every movement with the kind of attention he gave to very few things.His cows, football and Liss slicing peaches.She mixed the cut peaches in with the blackberries then scooped a bit onto his plate, doing the same for her.Then she opened the other bowls, revealing some pasta salad, and in the other one a couple of sandwiches with what looked like turkey on them.
