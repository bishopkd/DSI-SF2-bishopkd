 						ONE To endeavor to forget anyone is a 					certainway of thinking of nothing else.Jean de La Bruyre, Les Caractres 						(1688) 6th of July, 1830, early 						afternoon New York City GEORGIA EMILY MILTON rarely cared to notice any of 						the well to do men strutting about Broadway as it was a long standing rule 						of hers to never yearn for anything she couldnt have and/or didnt need.But as she bustled down the crowded, respectable stretch of Broadway, 						heading back toward the not so respectable trenches of Little Water, an 						astonishingly tall, well groomed gentleman strode toward her at a leisurely 						pace, making her not only slow but inwardly wish she had been born a 						lady.Weaving past others to ensure a 						better view, she caught staggered glimpses of an impressive, muscled frame 						garbed in a gray morning coat, well fitted trousers and an embroidered 						waistcoat with double row buttons.Gloved hands strategically angled his 						dove gray top hat forward and down to better shade his eyes against the 						bright sun gleaming across the surrounding stretch of shop 					windows.His hat alone had to be worth 						two months of her wages.As he smoothly rounded several 						people and strode toward her side of the pavement, his smoldering gray eyes 						caught and held hers from beneath the rim of his hat.The pulsing intensity 						of that raw, heated gaze bashed the breath out of her.Tightening his jaw, he aligned 						himself directly in her path, the expanse between them lessening with each 						frantic beat of her heart.That black leather booted stride slowed when he 						finally came upon her.He formally albeit a bit too gravelyinclined his dark head toward her, 						publicly acknowledging her in a way his sort never did during the 						day.He behaved as if he didnt see a 						rag in calico skirts, which had washed itself over from Orange Street, but 						an elegant young lady strolling alongside her mother with a lace parasol in 						hand.For making her feel so uncommonly attractive, Georgia considered 						blowing him a kiss.Fortunately, she knew how to keep herself out of 						trouble.Glancing away, she set her chin 						as any respectable woman would, and sashayed past his towering frame, 						purposefully letting her own arm brush against his, only to stumble against 						the dragging skirts of a washerwoman who had rudely darted before her.Of 						all the  His large hand jumped out and 						grabbed hold of her corseted waist, balancing her upright with a swift jerk.Georgia froze as her reticule swung against her wrist, hitting the sleeved 						coat of his solid forearm that held her in place.Her heart slid off into oblivion 						upon realizing her bum now dug against a solid, male thigh.His solid, male 						thigh.His head dipped toward her from 						behind, his muscles tensing as he pressed her backside more possessively 						against his front side.His arm tightened around her waist.Are you all 						right, madam?His voice was husky and refined, 						laced with a regal British accent that made the Irish girl in her inwardly 						put up both fists.That I am, sir.Thank you.Trying to shake off the intimacy of that hold, Georgia tried to politely 						ease away.He released her, his hand 						skimming from her waist toward the expanse of her back, making the skin 						beneath her clothing zing.Her eyes widened as that same 						hand curved its way back up her side, intent on outlining the rest of her 						body.Though she tried to peddle away, 						he tightened his hold on her upper arm and drew her back firmly toward 						himself.Madam.Sucking in a breath, she jerked 						away and shoved him back hard, causing him to stumble.Dont you be gropin 						me!Your bonnet.He held up both 						of his hands in a quick truce and gestured toward it.One of the ribbons 						came loose.That is all.Oh.Her cheeks bloomed with 						heat as she reached up and patted around the curve of her bonnet trying to 						find it.How utterly humiliating.Im ever so sorry, sir.I didnt mean to 						actually  No worries.Allow me.Setting 						a large hand against the small of her back, he guided her with forceful 						nudges over to the shop window beyond, removing them from the pathway of 						hustling pedestrians.Realizing that he intended to 						affix the ribbon himself, she glanced up wide eyed.Theres really no need 						for you to  Yes, there is.You will lose 						the ribbon otherwise.Now, please.Hold still.He angled her toward himself 						and leaned in close, lifting the discolored, frayed ribbon dangling off the 						side of her bonnet.Georgia awkwardly lingered 						before him as he wove the length of the ribbon back into place.Although she 						wanted to dash away, knowing that her bonnet was an atrocity not worth 						touching, sometimes a girl needed to gaze up at the stars that so willingly 						sought to shine.Even if those stars were far beyond the reach of a 						penniless girls imagination.As his fingers skimmed her 						bonnet and tucked the ribbon, she resisted reaching up and grazing her hand 						adoringly against that smooth, shaven face.What, oh, what would it be like 						to belong to a man such as this?Glimpsing a single black band 						fitted around the shifting gray coat of his bulking upper biceps, she 						glanced back up at him, her heart squeezing.He was in mourning.Tis almost affixed, he 						offered conversationally, his eyes scanning her bonnet.He leaned in closer.Im using one of the other pins to keep it in place.Thank you, she murmured, 						lowering her gaze.His coat smelled like mulled 						spice and cedar.It was divinely warm and inviting, even on a summers day.The double row of buttons on his embroidered waistcoat shifted against the 						expanse of his broad chest as he finished maneuvering the last of her ribbon 						into place.She could tell by the reflective metal gleam of those buttons 						that they werent painted brass made to emulate silver, but were, in fact, 						real 						silver.Only an elite group of men in New York could afford silver buttons.It was an elite group she knew shed never be able to touch, not even with 						an outstretched toe.There we are.Meeting her 						gaze, he drew his gloved hands away and offered in a low baritone, And how 						are you today, madam?Blinking up at him, she noted 						the way his eyes and his brow had softened, lending to a boyish 						vulnerability that didnt match his imposing height of more than six feet.She tried to quell the anxious tingle knotting her stomach.Despite the full 						bustle on Broadway, this glorious man sought to share in a bit of 						conversation with her.Im very well, sir.Thank you.She refrained from asking how he 						was out of respect for the band around his arm, and instead offered a 						flirtatious smile, gesturing toward the pleated rim of her bonnet.Rather 						impressive.Have you considered takin up haberdashery?He slowly grinned, the edges of 						those handsome gray eyes and that firm full mouth crinkling, brightening his 						overly serious appearance.No.I havent.Of course he hadnt.He had 						silver buttons.He probably owned every haberdashery in town.Or in the town 						from whence he came.He shifted toward her, his large 						frame blocking whatever view she had of the street.Are you from around 						these parts?She refrained from snorting.Youre overly kind, to be sure, but given that my bonnet cant even hold a 						ribbon, most certainly not.Only gold feathered peacocks can afford these 						parts, sir.Im merely passin through.Gold feathered peacocks?He 						smirked and set his hands behind his back, broadening his impressive 						shoulders.Is that what you like to call those of wealth?She scrunched her nose 						playfully.Nah, not really.Im bein polite, seein that youre one of 						them, and Ive roughed you up well enough.A gruff laugh escaped his lips.Rest assured, I am quite used to it, he remarked, still intimately holding 						her gaze.Ive already endured more than my share of elbowing from the 						public given that Im British.Too many Americans still remember the burning of 						Washington, but I swear to you I didnt do it.Georgia burst into laughter, 						smitten with his marvelously wry humor.Ah, now, can you readily blame 						them?You Brits are nothin but gadflies cloaked in a fancy 					accent.He paused and leaned in, 						heatedly searching her face without any further attempt to mask his 						unabashed interest.Might I cease being polite for one brief moment and ask 						whether you would like to join me for coffee over at my hotel?Its been 						quite some time since I have allowed myself a moment of leisure.Honor 						me.The wistful intensity lingering 						within that taut face was so galvanizing, it sent a tremor through her body.Though tempted to glimpse how the other half lived over the rim of a 						porcelain cup, she knew better than to involve herself with a man who wore 						silver buttons.It would never last beyond the toss of her skirts and a 						single night.She eyed the people weaving 						past.I dont mean to be rude, sir, given that youve been nothin but 						kind, but I really ought to go.Ive a long day ahead of me.She gestured 						toward the pavement as if that explained everything.His hopeful expression melted to 						disappointment.I understand and will detain you no more.He inclined his 						head, touching the tips of his gloved fingers to the satin rim of his hat.I bid you a very good day, madam.By all that was blue, his 						manners were as divine as the rest of him.And a very good day to you, as 						well, sir.I appreciate the unexpected service you rendered my 						bonnet.His mouth quirked.It was an 						honor to be of service.Good day.Stepping back, he eased his large frame 						around a passing couple.Glancing back at her one last time, he smiled and 						disappeared into the surrounding wall of bodies.Georgia eased out a wistful 						breath knowing she had just glimpsed life as it might have been had she been 						born a genteel lady of high society.Ah, money.If only it could also buy a 						woman true love and happiness, she would be the first to dash into the local 						bank and point a pistol at every clerk, demanding tens and 					twenties.Swiveling toward the opposite 						direction, Georgia resumed her steady march home, which was still a good 						forty minute walk.Why couldnt such refined gentlemen exist in her part of 						town?It wasnt in the least bit fair that her only selection of men smacked 						the bottoms of passing women and whistled through crooked, unchalked teeth.Not for long, though.She was only six dollars short of moving west and 						couldnt wait to climb into that stagecoach and leave her piss of 						a life behind.A towering, broad frame suddenly 						appeared beside her and veered in, startling her.Madam.Her eyes widened.Upon her soul, 						it was her Brit.Slowing her step, she offered a quick, Yes?He swung toward her, trotting 						backward in an effort to face her before jumping into her path and coming to 						an abrupt halt.Georgia squeaked and skid to 						prevent herself from dashing herself against him.He leaned toward her.I can 						only apologize for being so uncommonly bold, but I must have your 						name.She glanced up in astonishment.And what do you intend to do with my name, sir?He lifted a dark brow.Perhaps 						you and I can discuss that over coffee?Couldnt you make time for one small 						cup?Just one?My nickel.What was he thinking?Did she 						really look the sort?I appreciate the offer, sir, but I dont drink 						coffee.Or men.Im swearin off both until I move west.His eyes darkened.I am not 						asking you to drink me.Despite the warmth of the day, 						another shiver of awareness grazed the length of her body, knowing full well 						what the man meant.Not yet you arent, but youre invitin me to join you 						for coffee at your hotel.I may be third generation Irish, but that doesnt 						make me stupid.He lowered his chin.Coffee was 						merely a suggestion.Oh, I know full well what 						youre suggestin, and I suggest you leave off.Do I look desperate for a toss 						or 						coffee?A smile ruffled his lips.Have 						mercy upon a smitten man.What is your name?It was times like these that she 						hated her life.Such an attractive man graced with wealth and status would 						only ever view her as a one night commodity.Although she knew better than 						to want more for herself, given that she was nothing but a Five Points 						widow, her dear Raymond had taught her she had a right to want the universe, 						and by God, she was going to get it.There was only one way to go 						about protecting what little honor she had.Shed give him the name of the 						best prostitute in the ward.That way, everyone would benefit from her 						cleverness should he decide to hunt the name down.The name is Mrs.Elizabeth Heyer, sir.Emphasis on the Mrs.Sorry I cant join you.My 						husband wouldnt be pleased.She quickly rounded him.Now if youll excuse 						me  He stepped before her, blocking 						her from moving any farther.I ask that you provide your real name.I just did.He shook his head from side to 						side, never once breaking their gaze.It took a few breaths too long for 						you to answer and you didnt even look at me when you said it.Why?Do I 						unnerve you?She glared up at him.If you 						havent noticed, Im tryin to take my leave.If you were married, you would 						have mentioned it earlier.He leveled her with a reprimanding stare.Do 						you mean to say that you are the sort of woman who enjoys bantering with men 						whilst her husband isnt about?Shame on you if that is true, and shame on 						you if it isnt.Either way, the lady appears to be a liar.Curse him for honing in on the 						details.He leaned in.Dont deny that 						you are blatantly flirting with me in the same manner I am blatantly 						flirting with you.Her eyes widened.She stepped 						back.If I were flirtin, youd know it, because Id be draggin you 						straight home instead of takin up coffee.Im not one to play games, sir.I 						either do somethin or I dont.Then do something.His jaw 						tightened, his expression stilling.Im not married.An afternoon of 						conversation is all I ask.He met her gaze.For now.The smooth but predatory way he 						said it caused her to instinctively step back.Regardless of the fact that 						she was no longer married, it was obvious the sanctity of matrimony meant 						nothing to him.And what shall I tell my husband, sir, should he ask how I 						spent my afternoon?His eyes clung to hers as if 						methodically gauging her reaction.If you are indeed married, I will not 						only desist, but run.I am not interested in creating a mess for you 						or myself.I was merely looking to get to know a woman who genuinely piqued my 						interest.Is that wrong?Georgia could feel her palms 						growing moist.Tempted though she was to experience one spine tingling 						adventure of ripping off all the clothes of a most provocative stranger, she 						knew it wouldnt end well if Matthew and the boys were to ever find out.Theyd probably hunt him down and kill him.After they robbed him of 						everything he was worth, that is.Itd be a mess either way.She glanced around, ensuring she 						didnt see anyone she recognized.Unlike you, sir, Im lookin to marry.Not dance.A woman of little means, such as myself, needs a dependable 						relationship better known as forever and a day.Not your version of a day 						and a night.I think that about says it all.Good day.Without meeting his 						gaze, she swept past.He wordlessly angled away, 						allowing her passage.Georgia quickened her step and 						scolded herself for having encouraged him in the first place.Fifteen 						decades on the rosary praying for her Jezebel soul ought to readmit her into 						heaven.Although fifteen decades wouldnt even begin to include Matthews 						sins from this week alone that she had yet to pray for.That man required a 						set of his own damn beads.Not that he believed in God or anything else for 						that matter.All he believed in was money, money, money.She paused on the pavement and 						instinctively tightened her hold on her reticule, allowing others to weave 						past.For some reason, she had this niggling feeling that she was being 						followed by the Brit she thought shed left behind.Pinching her lips together, she 						swiveled on her heel and froze upon glimpsing him four strides away, despite 						her having already forged well over a block.Her reticule slid from her 						calico sleeved elbow down to her wrist, mirroring her disbelief that the man 						was following her like a dog shed unknowingly fed scraps to.Are you 						following me?Gray eyes heatedly captured hers 						as he came to a halt.Instead of coffee, how about you and I go for a walk 						and get to know each other that way?He smiled, ceremoniously announcing 						that he was capable of being respectable and that it was now up to her to 						decide as to how they should proceed.Georgia dragged in a much needed 						breath, her heart frantically pounding.Did he actually think she was going 						to change her mind based off that smoldering need blazing in those gunmetal 						eyes?She didnt even have time for a tryst.Not with all the laundry she 						had yet to do.A quick movement shadowed the 						corner of her eye as a youth darted in and yanked back her wrist with the 						violent tug of her own reticule.The glint of a blade whizzed 					past.Her eyes widened as she jerked 						around, realizing that the strings on her reticule had been slit by a 						passing thief.Ey!Georgia pounced for it, trying to reclaim what was 						hers, but the lanky youth skid out of reach, shoving past people, and dashed 						out of sight.Her heart popped realizing shed 						just been robbed by a ten year old.Hiking up her skirts above her ankle 						boots, she sprinted after the damn whoreson, shoving herself through those 						around her.Youd best run!she shouted after the boy, trying to keep up.Because Im about to shuck you like an oyster!Ill anchor him, the Brit 						called out from behind.His broad frame sped past her, 						and dodged left, then right, then left again, disappearing into the bustle 						of Broadway.Having lost sight of him 						and the 						boy, Georgia paused to frantically ask others if they had seen a youth being 						chased by a gent in a dove gray hat.She was repeatedly pointed onward and 						downward.So onward and downward she went.Dragging in breaths, she tried 						to keep up with the pace of her own booted feet as the jogging facade of 						Broadway shops tapered into pristine Italian row houses.If she didnt get 						that damn reticule back, shed have to dig money out of her box to make the 						rent.Again.Shouts and a gathering crowd of 						men on the upcoming dirt road made her jerk to a halt and snap her gaze 						toward a pluming dust that was settling.An overturned dove gray top hat lay 						oddly displaced outside the crowd in the middle of the street.She sucked in a breath, scanning 						the men who were yelling at women to stand back.What?The driver of an omnibus, who 						had already brought his horses to a full halt, untied the calling rope from 						his ankled boot, hopped down from his box seat and hurried into the crowd as 						passengers within the omni craned and gaped through the small 						windows.Oh, God.Her stomach clenched 						as she scrambled forward.The Brit had been struck by the 						omni and was lying motionless there on the street corner of Howard and 						Broadway.LIGHT EDGED IN THROUGH the waving darkness and pulsed 						against his eyelids.Slowly opening his eyes, he squinted against the 						glaring brightness of the sun that pierced through a cloudless sky.Taking 						in several jagged breaths, he drifted, unable to lift his head from the 						dirt pounded street that dug into his shaven cheek and throbbing 						temple.Several booted feet and 						countless hovering faces blocked his skewed view of painted placards posted 						on buildings and a blue sky that rose beyond a street he did not recognize.Shouts boomed all around him and the dust ridden, heat laced air made it 						difficult for him to breathe.A bearded man with a cap slung 						low against his brow leaned over him.Good to see you stayed below the 						clouds, sir.Are you able to get up?Why were there so many people 						gathered around him?What was going on?He rolled onto his back, wincing 						against the searing, razorlike sensations coiling throughout the length of 						his body.He staggered to sit up, only to sway and stumble back against the 						dirt road beneath him.The scuffed imprint of a booted foot that had been 						pressed deeply into the dirt beside him drew his gaze.One day it happened that, going to my 						boat, I saw the print of a mans naked foot on the shore, very evident on 						the sand, as the toes, heels and every part of it.He winced, pushing the odd, 						misplaced voice out of his head.His vision blurred as the acrid taste of 						blood coated his mouth and tongue.Something trickled down the side of his 						face, its wet warmth dribbling toward his earlobe.He swiped the moisture 						away with a trembling hand and glanced toward it.The fingertips of his 						brown leather glove were smeared with blood.Hoist him up, a female voice 						insisted from within the blur of surrounding faces.There was a pause.Oh, 						saints preserve us.She sounded more panicked.We need to get him over to 						the hospital.He swallowed and glanced up 						toward that lilting female voice that appeared concerned for him.Was he in 						some strange part of Ireland?Despite trying to find that voice, there only 						seemed to be an endless blur of male faces floating around him.Hands slid beneath his morning 						coat and trouser clad thighs.A group of men jerked him upward with a 						unified grunt.Pain whizzed straight up to his 						clenched teeth and skull.He gasped, twisting against their pinching grasps.Gentlemen, he seethed out between ragged breaths.Whilst your concern is 						appreciated, I hardly think a full procession is necessary.Such posh manners for one who 						is dying, one of the men carrying him hooted playfully.One can only 						wonder whatll come out of his mouth when hes dead.A quick hand reached out and 						knocked the cap off the mans head.Less tongue, more muscle.Move!Ey!the man yelled back, 						stumbling against him and all the others carrying him.Keep them mammet 						little hands to yourself, woman.I was only having a bit of fun.You think it fun watchin a man 						bleed?Keep movin him, you lout.Lest I make you bleed.The freckled face of a 						young woman with the brightest set of green eyes hed ever seen suddenly 						peered in from between all of the broad shoulders carrying him.Her rusty 						arched brows came together as she trotted alongside him, trying to hold his 						gaze through moving limbs.A loose, soft looking strand of strawberry red 						hair swayed against the wind, having tumbled out of her frayed blue 						bonnet.Where are you stayin?She 						shoved the loose strand of hair back into her bonnet with a bare hand, 						trying to keep up with the men carrying him.Close?Far?Gritting his teeth, he tried to 						focus, but couldnt.Are you from around here?she 						insisted, still bustling alongside him.Or are you visitin from abroad?You mentioned a hotel.Which hotel are you stayin at?Hotel?he echoed up at her, 						his throat tightening.When did I mention a hotel?She squinted down at him, 						searching his face.Never you mind that.We need to contact your family.Give me a name and address, and after we deliver you to the hospital, Ill 						run myself over to them at once.Family?He blinked, glancing up at the swaying, hazy blue 						sky above as he was guided up toward a hackney.Countless names and faces 						flipped through his minds eye like the pages of an endless book whipping 						past.There were so many names.Strada.Ludovicus.Casparus.Bruyre.Horace.Sloane.Lovelace.Shakespeare.Fielding.Pilkington.La Croix.They 						couldnt all be related to him.Orcould they?I was called Robinson Kreutznaer, which 						not being easily pronounced in the English tongue, we are commonly known by 						the name of Crusoe.Wait.Crusoe.Yes.It was a name 						he remembered very well.Robinson Crusoe of York.Was that not him?It had 						to be, and yet he couldnt remember if it was or it wasnt.Oh, God.What 						was happening to him?Why couldnt he remember what was what?He winced, realizing that he was 						now being tucked against the leather seat of an enclosed hackney.The firm 						hands that had been pushing him to sit upright against the seat left his 						body one by one as all the men turned away and jumped down and out of the 						hackney, leaving him alone against the seat.Everything swayed as he slumped 						against the weight of his heavy limbs.He panicked, unable to control his 						own body, and fought to remain upright by using his gloved hands against the 						sides of the hackney.The woman with the green eyes 						shoved her way past the others and frantically climbed up into the hackney, 						slamming the door behind her.Im takin you in myself.Ill not leave your 						side.I promise.The vehicle rolled forward as 						she landed beside him on the seat with a bounce.She leaned toward him.Come.Her arms slid around him as she dragged him gently toward herself.She guided his shoulder and head down onto her lap, scooting across the seat 						to better accommodate his size.He collapsed against the warmth 						of her lap, thankful he didnt have to hold himself up anymore.Wrapping a 						trembling hand around her knee, he buried it into the folds of her gown, 						taking comfort that he wasnt alone.The scent of lye and soap drifted up 						from the softness of her gown, which grazed his cheek and throbbing temple.He could die here and know eternal peace.Her hand rubbed his shoulder.I 						want you to talk.That way, Ill know youre doin all right.So go on.Talk.He swallowed, wanting to thank 						her for her compassion and for giving him a breath of hope even though he 						sensed there was none.Was death nothing more than a long sleep?His hand 						slowly and heavily slid inch by inch from her knee as he felt his entire 						world tip.Sir?She leaned down toward 						him and shook him.Sir?A snowy, rippling haze overtook 						the last of his vision, and though he fought to stay awake in those heavenly 						arms, everything faded and he along with it.The height of cleverness is to be 						able to conceal it.Franois de La Rochefoucauld, Maximes Morales (1678) Nine days later, early 						evening New York Hospital GEORGIA LET OUT AN EXASPERATED breath and 						adjusted her bonnet, setting both ankled boots up onto the wicker chair 						opposite the one shed been sitting in for the past ten minutes.She leaned 						forward and shook the bundled length of her brown calico gown to allow 						cooler air to relieve the heat of the room that would not 					dissipate.Falling back into the wicker 						chair again, she glanced impatiently toward the surgeon who appeared to be 						far more invested in his desk than in her.How much longer, sir?Ive yet 						to cross back into town before they cease all rides and I really have no 						desire to walk over fifteen blocks in the dark.Dr.Carter casually reached out 						and gripped the porcelain cup beside him.Lifting the rim to his mustached 						lip, he took a long swallow of murky coffee, before setting it back onto the 						saucer beside him with a clink.He leaned over the sizable ledger on his desk and 						scribed something.His condition remains the same, Miss Milton.As such, 						you may go.She glared at him.Tis 						Mrs.Milton 						til another man comes along to change it, and I didnt pay a whole twelve 						and a half cents for the omni to hear that.Last week you claimed he was 						fully recovered.I expected him to be gone by now.Why is he still 						here?The tip of his quill kept 						scratching against the parchment.Because, Mrs.Milton, I am still conflicted as 						to how I should proceed.Wrinkling his brow, he paused and reached toward 						the inkwell with a poised quill.His mental state isnt what it should be.I havent disclosed his condition to anyone outside a trusted few out of 						fear he could be tossed into an asylum.Her lips parted.An asylum?Why 						would anyone  Since he regained consciousness 						nine days ago, Mrs.Milton, he has been unable to provide me with a name or 						any details pertaining to his life.I even had to reacquaint him with the 						most basic of care, including how he was to shave and knot his own 						cravat.She dropped her legs from the 						chair and sat up, her heart pounding.Dearest God.What do you plan to do?What can 						you do?He shrugged.I intend to 						dismiss him within the week.He doesnt belong here any more than he does in 						an asylum.Her eyes widened.And what of 						his family, sir?We have to find a way to contact them before you let him 						wander off.What if he should disappear and they never hear from him 						again?He stared at her, edging back 						his hand from over the inkwell.If he hasnt the means to remember them, I 						havent the means to find them.Do you understand?There is nothing more 						that I can physically do for him.There is plenty more you can 						physically 						do for him!Such as?His tone was of 						pained tolerance.You can contact the British 						Consulate about whether or not theyre missin a citizen.I have already done that.No 						one is missing.Damn.Wellisnt there a way to 						bring in an artist and acquire a sketch of his face?That has already been done.I 						mandate profile sketches of all my patients.It allows for extended funding 						from the government.Good.Well be able to make use 						of it and submit his sketch to every newspaper and hotel across town.Someone is bound to know who he is, given he appears to be of the upper 						circles.Though I recommend no reward.That would only attract 						imposters.Dr.Carter tossed his quill 						aside and leaned into the desk, scrunching his gray pin striped waistcoat 						and his overcoat in the process.This is a hospital, Mrs.Milton.Not an 						investigative branch of the United States government.You clearly have no 						understanding as to how these things work.How typical that shed be 						treated like some stupid, scampering rat darting through the legs of 						society.She managed to refrain from jumping up and smacking him for it.Last I knew, sir, and correct me if Im wrong, but the New York Hospital is 						funded by a contributin branch of the United States government.As such, 						you have an 						obligation to oversee the well bein of every citizen that passes through 						these doors, be that citizen a Brit or not.Have the laws somehow changed?Is that what youre tellin me?He sighed.The funding I 						receive from the government is very limited.It doesnt provide for these 						sorts of things.She rolled her eyes.Everythin 						involvin our government is very limited.They only give the people just 						enough to prevent revolution whilst robbin every last one of us blind.In 						my opinion, these politicians ought to be boiled in their own whiskey.They 						dont give a spit about anythin but their own agenda.A tap resounded against the door 						of the small office.Yes?he called out, lifting 						his chin toward its direction.What is it?The door swung open and a 						balding man hurried in, bare hands adjusting a blood spattered, yellowing 						apron that had been carelessly tied across his waistcoat and trousers.Bed 						sixteen is shaving, despite orders that he remain in bed.He insists on yet 						another 						bath and intends to depart within the hour.What am I to do?Dr.Carter blew out a breath.There is nothing we can do.If he insists on departing, I cannot physically 						hold him.Send him into my office.Ill ensure he pays the bill and will 						direct him to one of the local boardinghouses.Yes, Dr.Carter.The man 						jogged back out.Bed sixteen?That was the Brits 						bed.Georgias wicker chair screeched against the floorboards as she jumped 						onto booted feet.You intend on lettin him walk out into the night despite 						his condition?And plan on layin him with a bill, too?She pointed at him, 						wishing she had it in her to grab his head and pound it into his own desk.A thug is what you are.A bedeviled, government funded thug who ought to 						be  Mrs.Milton, please.I havent 						the time for this.Youd best make the time, Dr.Carter, as it only involves the poor mans life.Directin him to a local 						boardinhouse is like tellin a fox to take up residence with the hounds.At 						the very least, you ought to turn him over to the state.He rubbed his temple.Mrs.Milton.He dropped his hand to his side and sat back against his leather 						chair.The man is far too old to become a ward of any state.He swept a 						grudging hand toward the open window beside him that mirrored a quiet, 						moonless night.Given his size and level of intelligence, I doubt hell run 						into any trouble.The bastard didnt even care 						that the minute that Brit put his polished boots on the wrong street, hed 						be dead.She marched toward him, halting before his desk.Whilst I know the 						world is full of woes we cant mend, we sure as hell ought to try.I want 						you to board him.He blinked.What?Here?No, you dunce.In your home.What better way to care for your patient than givin him a room next to your 						own?Dr.Carter threw back his head 						and puffed out a breath.After staring up at the ceiling for a long moment, 						he leveled his head and confided in a very impersonal tone, I cannot take 						him home with me.My wife would throw a fit if I commenced bringing home all 						of my patients.Better your wife than 						me.He pointed at her.Im asking 						you to leave before I have you tossed on your goddamn nose.Ive had enough 						of this.He swept a finger to the door.Get out.It was obvious this man wasnt 						taking her seriously.Setting both hands atop his piled ledgers, she leaned 						across the desk toward him and lowered her voice a whole octave to better 						deliver her threat.Before you go about tossin me out on my nose, Dr.Carter, I want 						you to think about whether or not your life means anythin to 					you.He rose to his feet, towering 						above her.The broad planes of his aging face tightened as he leaned toward 						her across the desk.Are you threatening me?he rasped, placing both of 						his hands parallel to her own.Nah.Tis just a question 						likebetween friends, dont you see.Georgia narrowed her gaze to match 						his.But supposin the Forty Thieves, who provide me with whatever 						protection I require, were to hear of my distress?What then?Id be 						thinkin itd be in your best interest to help this man along.Because if 						you dont, Id reckon that the quality of your life will diminish to the 						point that the Holy Virgin wouldnt even be able to help you.His eyes held hers, his rigid 						brow flickering with renewed uncertainty.I am a servant of the state.No 						rabble has power or say over me.Georgia continued to stare him 						down.Toss me on my nose and count all of the men who will show up at your 						door.I dare you.Go on.Toss me.Dr.Carter edged back and away, 						slowly removing his hands from the desk.Swiping a trembling hand across his 						face, he sat and shifted in his seat, refusing to look at her.Might I ask 						why you are so intent on assisting him?Is he a customer who never fully 						disclosed his name and owes you money?Is that what this is 					about?Georgia lowered her chin, her 						pulse roaring in her ears.How dare you?I sell hot corn on the hour of 						every summer and scrub clothes for priests in three wards, barely makin 						half of 						what you eat in an effort to stay respectable.She snapped a finger toward 						the open door.I dont know who the hell that man is any more than you do!Cursed that I am, I feel guilt for what happened to him.He was hit runnin after my reticule.I may not be fobbin high society, sir, but how 						does showin an ounce of concern for a man make me a whore?Dr.Carter fell back against the 						chair and sighed.I simply wanted to know what I was attaching my name 						to.Well, now you know.I do 						laundry.Not men.He cleared his throat.Thank 						you for more than clarifying that.I still dont understand a spit 						of any of this.How does a man forget his own name and life?Running the tips of his fingers 						against his mustache, he eyed her.Ive actually read about a condition 						similar to his known as memory loss in one of my medical journals.It 						involved a soldier who was rendered blank after a severe blow to the head 						during the war.I myself never thought it medically possible, but its 						obvious this mans memory is for the most part gone.I wanted you to be 						aware of that given your concern.She swallowed, bringing her 						shaky hands together.This was her fault.She should have never looked at 						him that day.Perhaps things might have been different.Perhaps hed still 						have had a mind.Dont you know anythin about him?Anythin at 						all?A few things, yes.Tis obvious 						by the clothing he arrived in, his speech and mannerisms, as well as the 						money that was found on his person, that he appears to be of British 						affluence.She huffed out a breath.I 						already knew that.His buttons were made out of silver, sir.Not even 						bankers can afford silver buttons.Then you know about as much 						about the man as I do, Mrs.Milton.He held up a hand, shifting in his 						seat.Threats aside, I will agree that assisting him is the right thing to 						do, but my time is very limited, so I am going to ask for your assistance, 						in turn.I work as many as twelve hours a day and my wife and six children 						barely see me.What little time I do have, I spend with them and hope to God 						youll not impose on what I consider to be incredibly precious.Georgia blinked, her throat 						tightening.Now she felt like a bloke of the worst sort, having bullied a 						family man.I didnt mean to toss threats, but I learned a long time ago 						that generosity and compassion have to be threatened out of 					people.He held her gaze for a long 						moment.You are far more impressive in nature than you let on.She set her chin.The frayed 						gown has a tendency to mislead people into thinkin Im as equally frayed.Now lets get on with this.What will you have me do?Ill see to it if it 						means helpin him.Thats all I really care about.He sighed.Find a means to 						board him until he is claimed.She lifted a brow.He wanted 						her to 						board him?Impossible.There was only one bed in her low closet and it 						belonged to her.Even if she did manage to get past sharing it with a man 						she didnt know, hed only end up leeching resources she barely had.Bein 						a respectable widow, sir, Ive neither the money nor the means.Dr.Carter leaned over and 						yanked open one of the drawers on the desk, scooping up a stringed, small 						leather satchel.I retrieved everything from his pockets when he first 						arrived to prevent anything from being stolen.The patients here arent 						particularly trustworthy.He tapped it.Inside, youll find a fob and a 						pocketbook containing one hundred and thirty two dollars.It should be more 						than enough to oversee all of his expenses.Ill even waive the hospital fee 						if you promise to board him for however long it takes to locate his 						family.Georgia gawked at the lopsided 						satchel.One hundred and thirty two dollars?Away with you.Who wanders 						about the city with that much money in one pocket?He smirked.A pirate, I 						suppose.He paused and shifted awkwardly in his seat.I should probably 						disclose that he claims to be a Sal pirate.She gasped.Whatever do you 						mean he claims to be?He cleared his throat.If you 						intend to board him, which I hope you will, I highly recommend you not 						exasperate his situation.He isnt in the least bit dangerous, but riling 						him into questioning his own sanity will only result in pointless paranoia.If he says he is a Sal pirate, he is.Do you understand?Heaven preserve her soul.What 						was she getting herself into?Whilst, yes, she wanted to help, and the man 						seemed infinitely divine on the street, she didnt know who this Brit was or 						what he was capable of.What if hed already been deranged prior to being 						clipped by the omni and his so called memory loss was, in fact, who he 						really was?Abide by calling him Robinson 						Crusoe, he continued.He prefers it.She blinked.I thought you had 						said he didnt know his name.He doesnt.He thinks Robinson 						Crusoe is 						his name.She squinted, not understanding 						his point.Beggin your pardon, but Robinson Crusoe sounds like a very 						legitimate name to me.He blinked rapidly.You 						obviously havent read the book.Now he really wasnt making any 						sense.What book?Dr.Carter leaned toward her, 						awkwardly refusing to meet her gaze.Mrs.Milton.Yes?Robinson Crusoe is the name of 						a character from a book.Tis a story decades old and well known amongst 						boys and men alike.The main character is a sailor whose ship is overtaken 						by Sal pirates who force him into becoming a slave.He manages to escape, 						only to be shipwrecked on an island frequented by cannibals.So you seeour 						Sal slave and pirate thinks he is this character.He thinks he is Robinson 						Crusoe.Her eyed widened.That doesnt 						sound like memory loss to me.He soundsderanged.I know.Believe me, I know.But 						he isnt.He shifted toward her.In trying to understand his most unusual 						condition, I presented him a map of the world and asked him where we were 						and where he lived.Imagine my astonishment when he points to France and 						mentions rue des Francs Bourgeois in Paris.Tis a street I know very well, 						given my wifes parents had lived on that same street prior to the 						Revolution that pushed them out.Tis still an impressive area frequented by 						those of affluence and one Robinson Crusoe would have never frequented.I 						have written to his address to inquire, but without a name or house number, 						it may lead nowhere.So you see, he may not remember 						who he is, 						but he still remembers factual things outside of this Crusoe.Factual things 						that must pertain to his own life.I have therefore concluded that his 						condition isnt one of full blown fantasy but an inability to decipher 						between fact and fiction.That doesnt make him deranged.It only makes 						himunreliable.Something to keep in mind whilst you board him.He plucked 						up a piece of stationery from his cluttered desk, along with an 						ink slathered quill.I will require your name and address before you depart 						with him.She angled toward him.Dont 						you think that a man who claims to have met cannibals is a walkin liability 						I ought to avoid?Regardless of if he knows life outside of thisthis 						Crusoe?What if he should eat me and all of my neighbors in honor of his cannibal 						friends?What then, sir?Dr.Carter burst into laughter 						and caught himself against the desk, eyeing her.He wont He laughed 						again, shaking his head.No.He wont.Not this man.She set her hands on her hips.Im bein quite serious and I wish to Joseph youd be, too.Ive seen far 						too much to question what is or isnt rational.Men are never rational, sir.They only pretend to be and Im rather worried I may end up swimmin in my 						own blood.His features sagged.I cannot 						predict what he will or will not do, but the man is genuinely compassionate 						and protective of others.Throughout his entire stay, hes done nothing but 						lecture us on our inability to tend to patients and is always getting out of 						bed to assist others in the hall, despite having orders that he rest.If 						that assurance isnt enough, I suggest you let him walk out into the world, 						Mrs.Milton.For he is neither your responsibility nor mine.So what will 						you have me do?The choice is yours.Oh, now, that just wasnt fair.She sighed.Ill find a means to board him, she grouched, waving toward 						the parchment.The name is Mrs.Georgia Emily Milton and the tenement is 28 						Orange Street.Orange.Like the bastard who destroyed Ireland.Dr.Carter paused, leaned over 						the parchment and sloppily scribed her name and address.Thank 					you.This was going to be a mess.Shed probably have to hover over this Brit like a hen over a cracked egg.But then again, if there was anyone who understood cracked, it most 						certainly was her.About how long will I have to board him?Exactly?That I cannot say.It could be 						a few days or several months, depending on how long it takes for someone to 						recognize him.She refrained from groaning.Though she hated submitting to guilt, for it was a pesky emotion that always 						got her into trouble, she owed the man this much, given it was her reticule that had 						sent him under an omni.Dr.Carter set aside the quill, 						swiped up the satchel and held it out.I will leave this in your care and 						will be in touch.Make the money last.We dont know how long it will be 						before anyone claims him.Dont you worry.Ill ensure 						both he and it lasts.She reached out and tugged the small, 						weighty satchel from his hand.Why did she have this eerie feeling that she 						was taking on a man who was about to do far more than ruin her 					month?She Ventures, and He 					Wins.A Comedy Written by a Young Lady 						(1696) A MAN OBNOXIOUSLY CLEARED 						his throat from behind Georgia where she still lingered before Dr.Carters 						desk.I realize the hour is anything but convenient, Dr.Carter, but Im 						asking to depart all the same before I lead a revolt in the hall.None of 						the goddamn linens in our beds have been tended to in over three days.For 						those men who have fluids pouring out from more than the usual places, I 						find it vile and disturbing.You and your minions ought to be hanged for 						your wretched disregard for humanity.Hanged.The harsh British voice startled 						Georgia into turning to the man.She instinctively pressed the small satchel 						in her hand against her hip, her eyes jumping from a broad chest up to a 						taut, masculine face.The man didnt sound quite as mindless as Dr.Carter 						had led her to believe.The Brit, who lingered all but a 						stride away, glanced down at her and paused.His black hair had been brushed 						back from his forehead with tonic, giving him the appearance of the 						distinguished gentleman she had met on the street, but that sizable scab and 						the large yellowing bruise marring the right side of his cheekbone and 						square jaw made him look like one of the boys.Dried blood from the day of 						the accident still spattered parts of his knotted cravat and full sections 						of his outer gray coat near the width of his broad shoulder.Merciful God.They had never 						even washed his clothes.The rest of him appeared to be well scrubbed, 						though she sensed it was not anything the hospital had bothered with, but 						something he had insisted on.Shifting toward her, he searched 						her face and drew in a ragged breath.I know you.She smiled awkwardly.Aye.That 						you do.He half nodded.Yes.His 						shaven face flushed.Forgive me.I didnt realize anyone would be coming.Stepping toward her, he reached out and swept up her hand, making her almost 						drop the satchel that was still pressed in the other one.Her heart flipped at the base of 						her throat as he bent over to softly kiss her bare hand.No one but her Raymond had ever 						kissed her hand like that.It was the signature of a gentleman who could see 						beyond the rags.Georgia swallowed against the tightness of her throat and 						tried to tug her hand loose only to find that the man wouldnt let go.Might Ihave my hand back?Or do you plan on keepin it?He glanced up and tightened his 						hold, that large hand taking complete command of hers.It was obvious he planned on 						keeping it.With a solid twist, she tugged 						her hand out of his, a rising heat overtaking her cheeks.I realize things 						are a bit muddled for you, Brit, but when I ask for somethin back, you give 						it back.Be it a hand or anythin else.Agreed?He edged closer, his pensive 						expression gauging her.I apologize for being unable to remember the 						details pertaining to our relationship, but are you my wife?Her lips parted.Oh, the poor 						mans mind had been completely bashed.He didnt remember her at all, and 						given his cheeky behavior on the street that day, he probably did have a wife, damn 						bastard.Dr.Carter cleared his throat 						from behind.Mrs.Crusoe, I recommend you heed my earlier advice of not 						riling him into a form of paranoia.Tis best.Mrs.Crusoe?Georgia swung toward the man and pointed at him.Oh, no.Oh, no, no.There isnt goin to be any of that.Mrs.Crusoe.Dr.Carters voice dropped to a low warning.I 						hold you responsible for his health and his delicate state of mind for as 						long as he is in your care.I will say no more.Oh, this couldnt be right.How 						could feeding into a mans delusions be responsible?It wasnt!She swiveled 						back, intent on settling this before she took him home.Never you mind him, Brit.You 						and I most certainly arent married.In truth, I barely consider us 						friends.You barely consider us 						friends?His mouth tightened as he continued to stare.That isnt at all 						what I remember.She quirked a brow.And what 						exactly do you remember?He shifted his scabbed jaw and 						glanced toward Dr.Carter before recapturing her gaze.Tis hardly 						respectable to say, given that we are not married.Her eyes widened.I beg your 						pardon?He smoothed his blood spattered 						cravat against his throat and set his chin, avoiding her gaze.Whilst I am 						pleased that you are here, for I was beginning to wonder if anyone would 						come, given my inability to remember names, I ask that we save this 						conversation for another time.Would you be so kind as to return me to my 						flat?
