We got bacon?Yes.For Gods sake, Riley.Im hungry.No reason you cant do the breakfast thing while I talk.Can you work a juicer?I can figure it out.Oranges.She pointed to the bowl.Juicer.Talk.While bacon sizzled and the juicer whirled, Riley filled in the details.He ...flew?More floated.Annika and I are on broom detailI confess I straddled mine once, just to see if it would take off.No luck.But every once in a while, one of us would hit, like, this little pocket of ...dark.Just something like a shadow, but more tangible, then wed hit it with the broom, and poof.All gone.And the other guys are sprinkling water, and this white vapor would puff up for a second.Wild stuff.All the while Bran floating up there with his bowl, and the vapors drifting down over the house.Like the curtain you said we needed.Riley poured herself a short glass of juice to test.Good stuff.You really missed it, Sash.And my take?Hes got a lot more than hes shown us.Sasha hesitated, glanced toward the doorway.Ive dreamed about him.Yeah, you said.I didnt ...not everything.Shed spokenor prophesizedabout the need for trust, then didnt give her own.Out there, on the cliff, Bran and I.  Standing there, in a storm.Lightning, thunder, the wind, the sea crashing.He called the storm.He holds the lightning like reins.And were together.I dont just mean on the cliff together.I get what you mean.Why does that worry you?Being with him?Because Ive never been with anyone.I admit itll give you a minute thinking about sex with a sorcerer but ...Whoa.Riley stopped herself, turned fully around.Anyone?Ever?At all?Every time I came closehad feelings, thought I was close to someoneId do or say something that ruined it, and theyd step back.First lessonlike the jab.Why are you to blame?Some of the time, sure.We all screw up.But every time its you?Thats bullshit and its annoying.Id be the one saying or doing it.Id forget to be careful, and something would slip.Then Id be an oddity instead of a person.Or at least an oddity as well as a person.And Id feel their feelings shift away.Thats on them.Id say picking the wrong guys on you, but youve got to try a few on to see what fits.So, maybe you should try him on.Youre no oddity to any of us, and certainly not to Bran.This doesnt seem like the time to ...try anyone on.More bullshit.We could lose.I dont intend to, but youve got to factor it in.Do you want to go out not knowing?Think about it, she said as she heard bootsteps approach.And cut yourselfand from where Im standing hima break.* * *  			She could think about it, Sasha decided.She wasnt sure which brought more stress.Thinking about being with Bran or thinking about riding in an inflatable boat, then diving under the water.They both gave her the jitters.After breakfast, eaten in shifts, she packed sunscreen, an extra shirt, her sketch pad.Then stopped stalling and went to Brans terrace doors.He glanced up from studying the contents of one of his cases.Ready, are you?Im nearly.I wanted toto thank you.I found the little bag, the charm, under my pillow.And this.She touched the necklace.They helped?They helped.This.He stepped over, tapped one of the stones on the necklace.Cobbled together a bit hastily.I like it.I wanted to give you this.Taking the leap, she opened her bag, and the sketchbook, to take out the sketch shed laid inside.His easy smile faded; his eyes sharpened as he took it.When did you draw this?Before I met you.It was one of the strongest dreams, recurring.I even painted it, felt I had to.I know things can be changed.A different choice, a different outcome.At least some of the time.And I realized by not showing you, I wasnt giving you that choice.And what of your choice?I made mine.I guess I made mine by giving that to you.Gathering her courage, she framed his face with her hands, touched her lips to his.Theyll be waiting for us, she said, and turned for the doors.He closed them with a thought before she reached them.Do you think I need a sketch to decide if I want you?I thought you should know that, just like the six of us being here ...Its all part of it.And you shouldnt be bound by that, not for something so personal.Nerves frayed, she reached behind her, twisted the knob.Would you open the doors?No.Theyll be waiting for us.They can bloody well wait.He crossed to her, laid his hands on the glass on either side of her head.Nervous, are you?Youre deliberately making me nervous.You should be nervous.Be a little afraid as well, of what the man you drew is able to do.You wont hurt me that way, and Im not helpless.Not anymore.Youve never been.My choice?Thats what youre asking?He took her mouth, hard and fast, trapping her against the door with his body, letting his hands mold hers.Thats my choice.Thats been my choice since you came knocking on my door, eyes dream struck.Its not your dreams binding me.Its you.His lips came back to hers, but this time she held on, this time she poured herself into the kiss.Ive wanted you since before I met you.I want  			She broke off at the pounding on the door.Were rolling!Doyle called.All right.But he kissed her again.Well be finishing what weve started here, fidh.Yes.The laugh fluttered up from her heart.We will.But now you have to open the doors.ELEVEN     			It didnt look like an inflatable boat.As Sashas imagination had formed a big yellow life raft with paddles, seeing an actual boat with motor, covered cabin, benchesand one that remained reasonably steady when she stepped on boardflooded her with relief.Until she saw the diving equipment.Buck up.Riley slapped her shoulder.Youll do fine.What about you, Irish, and the bit about sorcerers not being able to cross water?Its not cant so much as would rather not.He took a small vial from his pocket, downed the contents.Ill do fine as well.Wholl be piloting this thing?Riley hesitated, then glanced over at Doyle as he checked over the equipment in the wheelhouse.Can you handle it?He shrugged.Sure.Ill give you the bearings.That way I can go over the equipment and basics with the novices.Meaning me, Sasha said.Shouldnt someone stay with the boat?I could stay with the boat.Thats what anchors and buoys are for.Youve dived?Riley asked Bran.A few times, yes.And you?Sawyer nodded.More than a few.I know this, Annika put in before Riley asked.Okay, grab wetsuits, and Ill get us going.She walked to the wheelhouse.Sasha might have been full of doubts, but she reassured herself.She was a good swimmer, a strong swimmer, so if worse came to worst ...She stripped down to her bathing suita simple black tank, and a far cry from Annikas microscopic bikiniand busied herself slithering and tugging herself into a wetsuit while Doyle eased the boat out of its slip.Its fun, Sawyer told her as he zipped up his own.A whole new experience.It feels like Ive been having whole new experiences daily since I got to Corfu.He grinned, turned to the tanks to check them.Thats what makes it fun.When she saw him lift a harpoon, examine it, she thought heall of themhad to prepare for more than fun.Okay.Riley walked back on deck, opened the top of a long, low bench.First dive sites only a few minutes away.Masks, regulators, belts.Well go over all of it, she promised Sasha.Captain Bligh up theres not too happy about it, but were going to start with a nice, easy dive.Were not likely to find a flaming star waiting for us, but itll give everybody a chance tohar harget their feet wet.Visibility should be good, so lets everybody stay together ishstay in sight.Standard buddy system.Ive got her, Riley.Bran took his own dive knife out of his bag.Shell stop being nervous once shes in the water.Will I?Trust me.Lets go over the gear.Riley picked up a thick vest.Your buoyancy control deviceBCD.This will hold your tank, and help you maintain neutral buoyancy.Thats the goal.On the surface, you tend to float, so this, being weighted, will help your descent.The deeper you go, the less buoyancy, so it will regulate.You want the science?I think no.Youve got clips here for accessories and necessities.Regulator gauge, depth gauge, knife.You want to keep everything clipped off and tucked.Riley started talking about drag, swimming trim, breathing techniques.All of it spun around in Sashas head as she stood and the various equipment being explained was attached to or loaded on her.Doyle cut the engine far too soon.Lets keep it at about thirty minutes, see how it goes.A half hour?Down there?Itll go quicker than you imagine, Bran told her as he competently saw to his own gear.Doyle weighed anchor; Riley tossed out the marker buoy.The caves due east.She pointed toward the cliff face.Sawyer, why dont you and Annika go in, then Sasha can follow with Bran.Doyle and I should be right behind you.Just take a couple minutes to get used to it, she told Sasha, and strapped on a BCD.Sawyer put on his mask, his mouthpiece, and sitting on the side, gave a thumbs up before rolling backward into the water.Sasha had time to thinkOh, my Godbefore Annika laughed, then mimicked Sawyer.You can go in feetfirst if youd rather, Bran began.Ladder on the port side, Doyle said as he zipped his wetsuit.Why dont I help you down that way?Help her, Sasha thought.Watch her, look out for her.The hell with it.She clomped over to the side in her fins, boosted herself up.Hold your mask in place with one hand.Just roll out.Bran gave her leg an easy pat.Im two seconds after you.Before she could talk herself out of it, Sasha shut her eyes and let herself roll back.It was a longer drop than shed anticipated.When she hit the water, she let out a short scream, sucked in too much air.She started to kick back to the surface, but Bran was there, taking her hand.He made a slow, downward movement with his free hand, clearly signaling her to slow down, relax.Though she wanted to go up, go up into light and air, he pointed down, and drew her with him.Panic tickled at her throat, brought on an odd dizziness.She knew she was breathing too fastexactly what Riley warned not to dobut couldnt seem to control it.Then she saw Annika through the impossibly clear water, doing fluid somersaults with the sunlight cutting through the surface to spotlight her.Oh, to be that free, she thought, then realized she wasor could be.Nothing held her back but her own fears.Maybe she wasnt ready for somersaults, but that didnt mean she had to give up.She struggled with her breathingstill too fast, but betterand gave Brans hand a light squeeze to let him know she was all right.And finally let herself see the world around her.The colors, so deep and rich in the coral, the waving plants, the boldly darting fish.So much more than what shed experienced in the very rudimentary snorkeling shed done when shed talked herself into a winter vacation in Aruba some years before.This time, she wasnt just looking down at the worldlike peering through a glass window.She was part of it.With Bran she swam along the reef, gestured with wonder when she spotted a pumpkin colored starfish clinging to a rock.She saw another, and a deep red sponge, and watched a lobster scramble across the sandy bottom as if late for an appointment.When she saw the mouth of the cave, the panic wanted to rise again.Then Riley streaked by her, glanced back with a quick wave before spearing straight toward the dark, shallow mouth ahead.Doyle speared through the water after her, might have cut straight into the cave but Riley blocked him.Waiting for her, she realized, the four of them, with Annika swimming a circle around the other three.She kicked her feet, sent herself forward with Bran beside her.The six went into the cave, two by two, where the light hung murky.Here, the world was a shadowy green and what lived in it came as shadowed blurs.The blurs became a long, sinuous eel, a pair of octopi with undulating tentacles.The wavering plants hid things, she imagined, that could sting and bite.She heard the beat of her heart in her own head as she swam through the eerie green light of the tunnel.It opened, reminding her of the land cave she thought of as Nerezzas.She looked up, almost expecting to see bats swimming and swooping.Instead she saw light, trees, and stared in wonder at the open ceiling between worlds.Another octopus, uninterested in them, flowed across the bottom of the cave while a school of silvery fish speared away as one as she reached out a hand to touch.She forgot fear as she explored the madly artistic shapes of coral, the living sponges, the oddly fluid movement of a starfish that left its perch when disturbed.She thought of the painting she could do if she kept all this in her head long enough to sketch it.She forgot her fears, and for a time the true purpose, in the thrill of exploration.It surprised her when Riley tapped her shoulder, pointed at her watch, then the tunnel.With a reluctance she hadnt anticipated, she swam out again with the others.When she surfaced, the bright flash of sun, the taste of air, the feel of it on her skin disoriented her.She pulled herself up, then stood, mask in her hand, staring at the water.Knowing what lived in it.Youre a natural.Riley gave her a light punch on the shoulder before sitting to take off her flippers.Up for another?Yes.I think we stick with one or two more, easy ones, today.You didnt get any sense when we were down there?Sense?Oh.No.No, but I wasnt thinking about the stars, not once we got going.I should have  			I think the pull might come more naturally if youre relaxed.Bran handed her a bottle of water.If all of us are.You enjoyed it.You were right.Thirty minutes went by so fast, and wasnt nearly enough.You kept trim.Sawyer grabbed a can of Coke from the cooler and, at Rileys nod, tossed it to her, got another for himself.Not everybody who knows how to swim translates it for divingnot right away.This one?He pulled another Coke out, handed it to Annika.Shes a freaking fish.Its fun to swim with friends.The chances of finding what were after in the other two caves youve got down here are zilch.Doyle broke out a water for himself.Thats how we cross them off the list, and give Sasha some practice.I wish you wouldnt hold back on my account.Ill do okay.Yeah, most likely.But what you have to consider is thats not your environment down there, and youre only alive down there because you have equipment that makes it possible.If we run into trouble while were under, the way we did in the cave up here?Getting out of its going to take some experience.She turned to Doyle then, shoved a hand over her water slick hair.Am I wrong?No.He drank deep from the bottle.No, youre not wrong.And its not like we dont have time, he said to Sasha.But youre ready to get it done.Im long past ready.He shook his head, drank again before he turned toward the wheelhouse.But theres time.* * *  			They dived twice more, and Sasha felt more comfortable each time.But she had to admit, to herself at least, the idea of coming up against a dark god while twenty or thirty feet underwater caused considerable anxiety.Pain, she remembered.Her dreams had been painted with pain and blood and battle.But she could recall none about drowning.Maybe that was a good sign.They headed back in to have the tanks refilled, and by popular vote grabbed lunch in the village.They ate on the sidewalk, keeping the conversation about the dives, rather than their underlying purpose.The combination of the food, the sun, the voices, the bustle all around shifted Sashas exhilaration into a comfortable, cat lazy fatigue.Too used to Rileys driving to worry about it, she half dozed on the short drive back to the villa, imagining curling up on her bed in her quiet room and napping.Got some things I want to check into.Riley got out as the dog trotted over.Told you wed be back.She gave him a good rub.Same deal tomorrow, so I guess we should work out a strategy, try at least one of the more challenging dives.Can I take the jeep?I want to pick up a few things, Sawyer explained.We were just in the village.Didnt want to hold everybody up.With a shrug, Riley tossed him the keys.Can I go with you?Can I shop?Oh, well ...But Sawyer made the mistake of looking into Annikas sparkling eyes.Sure.Man down, Doyle commented.Later, you can get the coins out, Bran.Ive got a contact wholl give Annika a fair price on a few of them.I can sort those out, and we can make that stop before we get on the boat in the morning.Youll have some actual spending money, Riley told Annika.Shopping money.Yeah, that, too.Ill touch base with him.Bring that back in one piece, she added, and walked toward the villa with Apollo.Got work of my own.Doyle trailed off behind her.You should pick up some fresh supplies.Sawyer shot Sasha a look as he got behind the wheel.Hell.Yeah, I figured.Ill work it out.I want new earrings.Annika jumped into the passenger seat.What is it with women and earrings?Sawyer wondered.Theyre pretty.Bye.She waved to Sasha and Bran.Were going shopping!May the gods take pity on him, Bran stated, then took her hand to lead her toward the terrace steps.I feel like I should do something productive.Its not even three in the afternoon.Productive.I should sketch out whats in my head, what I saw today.The light in the cave.I want to capture that.And I know I shouldnt try when I feel this lazy.Then youll capture it when youre not.Meanwhile ...He turned into her room with her, booted the doors closed, then whipped her around to press her back against them.I think this is where we left off.He took her mouth, and took her under.Now?Oh, absolutely now.He took his lips on a lazy journey along the column of her throat.Do you have a problem with that?Everything inside her sparked.No.No, now would be fine.Now would be good.His hands skimmed up to brush over her breasts.Now would be wonderful.Wanting, willing, she wrapped around him, thrilled by the rush of her own pulse, the flood of her own needs.Needs shed locked away for so long spun freeand there was such joy in them.She laughed, only a hint of nerves, when he turned her again, walked her backward toward the bed with his mouth still hungry on hers.Then she was tumbling back, and he with her.And oh, what a sensation, the weight and shape of his body pressed to hers, to feel her own yielding to it.His hands, so strong and sure, molding her like clay until her blood ran hot under her skin.She wanted to touch him, feared shed fumble something as she fought to pull off his shirt.She wanted her hands on flesh, on muscle.I need to tell you  			His teeth scraped lightly down her throat; her fingers dug into his shoulder blades.In case I do something wrong ...Nothing could be wrong.He flipped open the buttons of her shirt, his lips following his fingers.Its just I might.Oh, God, this feels amazing.Ive never done this before so I might make a mistake.She realized shed just made one when everything stilled.She closed her eyes, asked herself why, why, couldnt she have just let it go, just said nothing until it was done.Not done what before, exactly?She opened her eyes, found his, so dark, so intense, on hers.Sex.I shouldnt have said anything.Why does it have to matter?He shifted, sitting up, drawing her with him.And she felt all the joy and delight leak away into mortification.Of course you should have told me, and of course it matters.You either want me or you dont.She dug for anger, for anything that would cover the humiliation of tears that wanted to spill.Thats not the issue.It matters, he repeated, taking her arms when she tried to turn away.In approach, in tone.The first shouldnt be rushed and greedy, and I was feeling both.Since I was feeling the same, why cant we just  			Because you dont know.But you will.He lifted her hand, turned it over to lay a kiss lightly in her palm.If youre sure.Its a gift that cant be taken back.Im sure.I want to feel what you make me feel.I want to be with you.Now.Then trust me.I couldnt be here if I didnt.We want moonlight and stars.As he spoke the room went dusky blue.Lightscandles?stars?glimmered through it.The song of the sea, the scent of flowers.She heard the waves, like a whisper as he laid her back on what had become a bower.Youre so much more than youve shown us.Illusions, he thought, but the moment called for them.And for romance, and tenderness.He found he had them for her, and could call on them as easily as he could whistle up the wind.He cupped her face with one hand, took her lips slow, slow, deep, deeper, until he felt her melt into his bed of feathers and flowers.He could seduce, degree by degree, give them both the sumptuous.She smelled of the sea, tasted of honey.And under his hands her skin was soft as satin.On impulse he ran his hands through her hair, scattered tiny rosebuds through it.Looked down to enjoy the way it spread and tumbled over his bower.You look like a faerie queen.If I had your gift, I would paint you just like this.Or ...He waved a finger through the air, and she was naked but for a scatter of flower petals.Oh!Instinctively, she lifted a hand to cover her breasts, but he caught it, brought it to his lips as he skimmed his gaze over her.Yes, just like this.Im commissioning you to do this self portrait.Name your price, he murmured and took her mouth again.How could she have known she could float and fly, could soar and dive all at the same time?That she could burn and shudder.And want, want, want.His mouth took hers with soul deep kisses and whispered words she didnt understand.And his hands glided over her, awakening fresh thrills.His thumbs brushed her nipples, then his tongue, stirring something deep in her belly.Then his mouth closed over her, and that stirring, that pulling flashed into a fast, shocking leap of pleasure.She cried out from it, arched up as it struck like an arrow.Youre quick, he murmured.What?What?Just the start.Just a sample.He pressed his lips to her thundering heart.This time youll take, and taking, you give.He gripped her hands with his, as her touch, her explorations tempted him to rush.So he used only his mouth on her, roaming down her torso, pleasing himself when her belly quivered under his tongue.She moaned for him, moved for him, and the mix of her need and surrender sparked like a wire in his blood.Another time he would give in to that, another time he would let that hunger loose.But now he would seduce her, now he would torment them both.He brushed his lips over her thigh, and then his tongue along the vulnerable line beside her center.And his teeth, lightly, lightly, until her breath became long, sighing moans, until her body undulated.He found her warm and wet, so ready to fly up again.It was like being showered with warm liquid gold, showered with melted jewels.Every inch of her sparkled, shone, glimmered, gleamed.The world was warm and soft, and smothered in flowers, drenched in moonlight.And the world was only him.As his mouth came back to hers again, as her hands were free to touch and stroke, she thought nothing could ever be more beautiful.Will you look at me now?Look at me, Sasha.She opened eyes dark and heavy with the glorious weight of pleasure.Bran.This is ours, only.He banished even the thought of pain as he slipped into her.And she learned there was more beauty.She opened for it, welcomed it.Keeping her eyes on his, she moved with him, let that beauty, the glory of it saturate her.It took her higher to where the air thinned, the world spun.As even the air shattered around her, she laid her hand on his cheek.Yes, she said.Yes, she sighed, and let herself slide down.She imagined her body pulsing off light.Pale pink and gold light.Warm and soft and lovely.He lay full on her so she imagined the light pulsed right through him as well, and filled the room with color.She wondered, if this is how sex made you feel, how people managed to do anything else.Well, we can be a bit preoccupied with it.What?Did I say that out loud?You did.He raised his head, gave her face a study out of dark, sleepy eyes.And its a fine compliment to me.You gave me a bed of flowers and moonlight.Im full of compliments.He shifted, rolled so he could draw her up against his side.I want that painting.She laughed, happy to rest her head on his shoulder.I dont know how I looked.Ill see that you do.Is it bad timing to ask why you havent been with someone before this?No.I felt I had to be honest about things before I slept with someone.And whenever things got to that point, the man was either put off or too interested in that part of me.It wasnt about me anymore, about wanting me anymore.You already knew.And you have something ...it balances things.That sounds calculated.No, it sounds human.Now she shifted, propped up so she could see his face.This?She gestured to the flowers, the moonlight.What you have, are?Its fascinating.Its compelling.But its not why Im here with you now.This?He laid a hand on her temple.What you have and are is fascinating and compelling.But its not why I want you here.Content, she settled down again.We have so many things to deal with, to figure out.Gods and stars and caves and vanishing islands.Right now none of it seems real.But it is.And well do what needs doing.Well find the star thats here for us.Youve seen it.Not everything comes through exactly as I see it.Well trust this does, and more, keep looking until we find it.Youve had more time than I have to believe.Im still working on it.I guess we should go down, start planning tomorrows search.Be good soldiers, he agreed and stroked a hand down her arm.Can I ask you a question first?I think you could ask most anything under the circumstances.Is it always like that?Sex?Well, its notnot from what Ive read, or heard.But do you think it was amazing because it was the first time, or it might be amazing for us?I couldnt say, but I can be sure of one thing.Were going to find out.When he rolled over onto her, she laughed.I guess they can get started downstairs without us.TWELVE     			The second time proved amazingand as for the third, sex in the shower was an experience she definitely wanted to repeat.Often.Sasha wondered if going without sex for her entire adult life had given her a voracious appetite for it.Regardless, she considered herself well and truly sated, and made her way down to the kitchen to attend to another appetite.She was starving.She grabbed an apple out of the bowl, poured a glass of wine before perusing the contents of the fridge.Someone, she noted, had done some shopping.And since shed contributed nothing there, unless anyone objected, she knew what to do with the lamb chops.Humming, she put together an easy marinade, hunted out a bowl deep enough to hold the dozen chops, poured it on, set it aside.And turning, let out a squeak when she saw Riley leaning against the doorjamb.God!You scared me.I didnt hear you.You were too busy singing to bluebirds and butterflies and making rainbows.Im marinating lamb chops.Uh huh.Riley eyed the wine bottle, got herself a glass.Well, I have to cross off any idea of using you if we need to sacrifice a virgin.What?Oh.Ha.No need to ask if youre okay, as youve got those rainbows coming out of your ears.It was amazing.I keep using that word.There has to be a better word.It works.Riley toasted her.Congratulations.Does everybody know what we That we ...Anybody whos not brain dead.Wheres your studly sorcerer?Sasha winced, glanced at both doorways.He had some things to do, and I was starving.Good sex burns a lot of calories.Sasha held up three fingers.Three times?Now youre making me jealous.Is that usual?Its probably a stupid question, but I dont have anyone to ask.Let me just say congratulations again.Riley boosted herself up to sit on the table.Threes a lot for your first rodeo, but you look pretty fresh yet.And let me also repeat: stud.He made it magic.Literally.I probably shouldnt talk about it.Tell you.Oh, au contraire.You really should, and step by step is best.How long does that sit?Riley gestured toward the bowl with her glass.An hour would be good.Great.Lets take a walk, and you can give me the play by play.Riley pushed off the table.Look, Annika may be more of a girl, but Im girl enough to know when it comes to sexespecially the intro toyoure allowed to share.Plus, I havent had any myself in a while, so I need my perks where I can get them.Where is everybody else?Riley topped off both glasses.Sawyerand we can thank him for the provisionswent down to the beach for a swim.He looked a little shell shocked, as Annika dragged him around the village for earrings.Shes either upstairs admiring them or she went down for a swim, too.The Seventh Samurai  			Who?As they walked outside, Riley mimed pulling a sword out of a sheath, wielding it.Oh, Doyle.Yeah, since everybody else was, well say occupied, he and I sat down with the maps.And butted heads over where to look tomorrow.Hes got a really hard head.Where are we going?My pick.And his, Riley added.We decided on both before blood was spilled.So were heading out at seven thirty.Now, you can describe magical sex, in finite detail, while you practice your combinations.My combinations?Puzzled, Sasha punched her fist.But Ive been drinking.Sash.With a headshake, Riley set her glass on the stone wall.The best fights happen when youve been drinking.Riley danced on her toes, bounced her shoulders.Show me some stuff.Well, all right.But I dont know how Im supposed to punch and talk about having sex at the same time.Multitask.As he worked, Bran caught the movement outside.He paused to step closer to his open doors, and saw Sasha practicing her boxing with Riley.Not in the cover of the olive grove this time, he noted.But in the open.So much about her had opened.It seemed miraculous that less than a week had passed since hed stepped out onto that hotel terrace and seen her.Fated, he didnt question that.Fated for the six of them, all so different, all from other places, to come together here.To join together here for the search that had been part of his familys legacy, part of their duty, for countless generations.But had he been fated to have such strong feelings for the reluctant seer from America?The attraction, the desire?Basic, normal, simple.But the rest ...He needed time to explore and evaluate the rest.And time was so crowded.Hed taken more than he should to be with her that day.Was taking more now just to watch her.But it was a bright thing, wasnt it, to see her laugh when Riley snapped her head back, flung out her arms and dropped to the ground as if suffering a knockout punch.That was friendship, he thought.An oddly tight one for so short a time.The tough little scientist and the insular artist.As he considered it, Annika came up the cliff steps, a flowered sarong blowing around the very tiny bikini she wore.Another oddity, he thought as Annika went toward the other women while Sasha executed what he thought was meant to be a side kick and Riley shook her headher amused pity all but visible.The three of them stood in the softening sunlight, all beauties in their own unique way.Annika flung her arms around Sasha in one of her joyful hugs, then did a trio of cartwheels that sent her sarong flyingand the dog chasing it.Not to be undone, he supposed, Riley did a handspring.Annika a backflip.Then the two women began to coach Sashawho clearly needed it.He watched a moment more, struck by the way the setting sun gleamed over them, the way their laughter carried to him on the evening breeze.Then he went back in to finish the work.The laughter was a tonic, he thought, but the lessons were honing weapons.And he would do the same.* * *  			Sasha found Sawyer sniffing at her marinating chops when she came back in.He glanced up at her.Got plans for them?Oh, did you?He shrugged.I was just going to toss them on the grill.This looks fancier.Its really not.I thought Greece, lamb, and looked up some recipes last night.Its pretty basic and quick.Some browning in olive oil and garlic.A little seasoning, some lemon juice.Have at it.I havent thought about sides, and its later than I meant it to be.Ill handle that part.He got out a beer.Teamwork.He popped the beer, took a hit.You look ...healthy.Healthy?Yeah.He grinned.Healthy.Im going to go grab some herbs.I could use some thyme for the lamb.You got it.He tapped her cheek as he walked by.Healthy.Great, she thought, and moved to the sink to wash up.There was nothing wrong with a grown woman looking healthy.She just wasnt sure how she felt about advertising it, as she apparently was.She got out an enormous skillet, the oil, picked up a bulb of garlic.Annika breezed in to get dishes.She heard Rileys voice from outside, and Doyles as she bundled her hair up and out of the way to cook.As she prepped the garlic, Sawyer came back with the herbs.He put a pot of water on the stove before dumping some new red potatoes in the sink.Boil em till theyre tender, he said, scrubbing, then sort of saut them or whatever in butter and herbs, heavy on the rosemary.Looks fancy, like your chops, but isnt.Teamwork.Completely.She grinned at him, then saw Bran come in.And felt very, very healthy.This looks domestic and under control.Need a hand with anything?Know how to prep asparagus?Sawyer asked him.Havent a clue, Bran said as he helped himself to Sashas wine.Youre about to get one.She heated her oil as the potatoes boiled.Got Bran his own glass of wine as Sawyer instructed him how to prep the asparagus.Riley came in to feed the dog; Doyle got a beer and asked when the hell they were going to eat.Annika came in for more candles.Like family, Sasha thought.It felt like family.Whatever happened tomorrow, tonight she had family.* * *  			She found out what it was like to share a bed with a man.They took up considerable room, but it made waking up an entirely new experience.With Bran on breakfast detail, she took time to send her mother an email, with pictures of her view attached.What it lacked in detaileliminating sex, vengeful gods, and learning how to boxit made up for in bright chatter.And she thought how pleased her mother would be that she was enjoying her ...holiday.And making friends.Once sent, Sasha grabbed the exercise bands Riley lent her, used them as instructed for biceps curls, triceps kickbacks, lateral raises, shoulder raises.She thought there was more, but couldnt quite rememberand since her arms felt like rubber, called it a session.She grabbed her bag, her hat, and took the terrace doors out.The sun, brutally bright, had her lifting a hand to shield her eyes as she dug with the other for her sunglasses.When she reached the base of the steps, pushed them on, the world went night dark.There, she said, and lifted an arm to point out toward the sea.Her black dogs come, malformed curs riding the night on bat wings.Formed for death, no more, no less.Steel to slice, to tear.But fire, red as bloodshed, hot as the hell her hounds spring from, must burn and burn and burn.Red is the star, fire is its heart.Fire will shield it.The time of transformation is here.The bright, white moon, and the bright, white magick with it, with the chosen six and all they are.Against this she strikes.Against her we to the life or to the death.For this we were born, for this we were joined.And worlds wait, for their fates are in our hands.When she swayed, Bran slid an arm around her waist to support her.God, my head.You will fight it still, he said softly and eased her down at the table to sit.Its automatic.Habit.Some juice.Annika crouched beside her.Do you want water instead?No, thanks.This is good.Shaky yet, Sasha sipped at the juice.Do you remember what you said?Dont poke at her!Riley snapped at Doyle.Im asking a question.Its all right.Yes, I think so.I could see.It went from day to night.Like a switch flipped.And I could see them flying in from over the water.Like the bats in the cave, but bigger.You called them dogs, Bran prompted her.Yes, sort of.Like ...gargoyles.Twisted bodies, oversized heads.Claws, fangs.Attacking.When?I dont know.Its not clear.Night.Tonight?Tomorrow night?Next week?I dont know.Shes with them, and when they bleed, or we do, it feeds her.Like a vampire.Blood and death feed her.You spoke of fire.As a weapon and a shield for the star.I wish I knew what it meant.Bright magick.Bran stroked a hand down her hair.White magick.We fight her with it as she fights against it.But something more, or something more through that.I can work on it.And meanwhile?Doyle asked.This time of transformation?Whats that?Im not looking for Optimus Prime, Sawyer put in.But were transforming, in a way.From each of us going on our own to working as a unit.Were not all the way there, maybe, so weve still got some work to do on it.Maybe so, but while that transformings going on, weve got a fight coming.Sooner or later, Doyle said.It seems to me were leaning too heavy on witchcraft.When Im going up against a homicidal god, I like having a witch in my corner, Riley tossed back.Not saying different.But since were going up against a homicidal god, we ought to have some battle plans.Riley nodded.Ill give you that.We should eat, get going, and we can start working on those plans on the boat.Cold breakfasts still breakfast, she said as she sat.Bran waved a hand over the platter of bacon and eggs.Now its hot.See that?Happily Riley piled food on her plate.Having a witch arounds handy.She rubbed Sashas thigh under the table with one hand, scooped eggs onto Sashas plate with the other.Even if youre a little queasy, itll settle youand its going to be a long workday.Shed carry her weight, Sasha promised herself.And despite being a little queasy, picked up her fork and ate.* * *  			Sasha worked on her nerves on the way to the first cave.Shed done all right on the dives the day beforeeven enjoyed part of them.But the morning vision left her shaken and uneasy.She hoped the cool, damp wind, the flashing sun off the water would clear out those nerves.When they didnt, she dug out her sketchbook.Well be fine.When she glanced over at Bran, he tapped a finger on her temple.You dont have to be a seer to see.Youd do better to relax.Were here for a purpose, and it isnt to lose when weve barely begun.I could smell the blood, she said quietly.Hear the shrieks those things made as they poured out of the sky.And feel the madness in them.Her creations, Bran, formed of nothing but hate and madness.Their only purpose is death.Ours is life.I believe life, if its willing to fight for it, wins.Trust life.Trust yourself and whats in you.Im working on it.When they geared up, Sawyer hooked on a camera.I picked this up in the village yesterday.Depth rated to two hundred feet.I figured we should start documenting.Im keeping a log.Riley studied the camera.Thats a really nice toy.Good idea, Sawyer.Stills and video?Yeah.Ill do some of both, see how it goes.Though the dive proved pleasant and pretty, even amusing as Annika performed underwater gymnastics for the camera, they found nothing but sea life.And while Sasha caught herself glancing over her shoulder, half expecting to see a black cloud of winged creatures slicing through the sea, she felt more confident in her rudimentary diving skills by the time she pulled herself back on deck.Hydrate.Riley dug in the cooler for bottles of water after shed stowed her used tank.Thats three crossed off.My picks next, she added, tossed a bottle to Doyle.Im going to review the pictures.I want to see.Annika snuggled onto the bench beside Sawyer.Because shed leaned in as well, bracing a hand on Sawyers shoulder, Sasha felt the lust punch through him.Surprised at how clear it came, embarrassed she hadnt blocked it, she eased back just a bit.Not that anyone could blame him, she thought, as Annika wiggled closer.But understanding it and feeling it were different things.To ensure his privacy, Sasha moved to the other side of the deck where Doyle pored over maps.Do you have another location in mind?she asked him.A lot of possibilities.We should pick up the pace.Which is slower because Im inexperienced.Youre doing all right.He looked up then, and she sensed something hard and deeply guarded.Looking for something?She answered as coolly as hed asked.Trying not to.Still watching her, he picked up his water.Anyone else in your family with the sight?It tends to run in families.No.Not that I ever heard of.It occurred to her she didnt know him, not the way she felt shed come to know the others.He held himself just a little aloof.Still, it meant he didnt know her either.Maybe they should try to fix that.Not much family anyway, she continued.Both my parents were only children, and I only saw my grandparents sporadically.My father left when I was about twelve.He couldnt handle what I have.My mother made excuses for me, then made excuses for him.I resented that, which isnt really fair.She did her best.She does her best.But given all that, I chose to live alone, so I didnt have to deal with what I have.Where I could focus on art, and I liked it.She looked back to where the other four passed around Sawyers camera.I like this better.Even knowing what could happen, knowing some of what will happen, this is better.What about you?What about me?Do you have family?No.Not anymore.Its hard, without family.I didnt realize until ...She looked back again.It feels like alones easy until you realize.Its got its advantages.Only one person to worry about.You want to go left, you go left because nobodys pushing you to go right.Id rather go right, at least give right a try, than be alone again.I like the way Sawyer talks about his family, his grandfather especially.And Riley and Bran theirs.They dont know alone, not the way we do.And Annika ...She couldnt imagine Annika alone, but it occurred to her shed never asked.Annika?Do you have family?Family?Tossing back her long braid, Annika smiled.Yes.I have six sisters.Six Sawyer began.Sisters?Riley finished.Yes.I am the youngest.Chantalla is the oldest, then Loreli, then  			Youre the seventh daughter, Bran interrupted.My father says hes cursed with girls.Hes joking, she added.Your mother?Doyle shifted around.Does she have sisters?She has six, as I have six.And shes the youngest?Bran glanced at Doyle as Annika nodded.Well, kick my ass.Riley shoved the camera back at Sawyer.Weve got us a seventh daughter of a seventh daughter.Do you have the sight, Anni?Oh, not like Sasha.I know things.Just know sometimes.I knew to be on the beach for Sawyer.To be herethis time, this place.So I came.I dont like to fight, but I knew I would.I will.Sasha sees things that help.That warn.I only see what Im meant to do.What you see might help, too, Sawyer told her.You should let us know.I want to help.When we find the Fire Star, it will get harder.Shell be angry we have what she wants.Thats a good bet, Riley agreed.I say set the course, Doyle.Brans gaze gleamed hard and bright.And lets see if we can really piss her off.* * *  			They found nothing, though they pushed it to three dives.Fatigue hung over the boat like a cloud on the trip back to the marina.Sasha tried to shake it, reminding herself theyd barely begun.They werent likely to stumble across the prize without a lot of sweat and effort.But the sensation of adventure had faded for the day, and only a thin shadow of dread remained.It seemed infectious.Sawyer toyed with his compass and brooded.Riley huddled over her logs.Even Annika had lost some of her shine and sat curled on a bench, staring out over the water.Your vision, Bran said at length.On the cliff, in the storm.Calling the storm.The lightning.Maybe its time.No.Panic clawed through her belly.You cant let fear cloud it.It does.It does, but its not only that.There was something urgent, immediate, even desperate in it.Beyond the danger of it, even beyond the power.Its not for now.I dont know when or why, but Im sure its not now.But youll say when it is?He closed a hand over hers before she answered.Truth, Sasha.And a promise.Yes.I think youll know as well as I, but yes.That added another layer of dread as they dealt with the gear and equipment.She wanted her paints, Sasha decided.To lose herself in them for an hour.By the time Riley pulled up at the villa, Doyle roaring in behind her on his bike, shed set plans to begin her series of local flora.Im heading back to the village, Riley announced.Ive got some people I want to talk to, some lines to tug.I could go with you, Annika began.Im not looking to shop.Dont look for me for dinner, she added.In fact, dont wait up.I might get a hot date out of this.Maybe you shouldnt be going out on your own, Sawyer said.I can handle myself, cowboy.The dog poked its head in the jeep, wagged all over.You hang here, big guy.Though she ruffled his fur, she nudged him away.Ill be back when Im back.The dog looked mournfully after her when she drove off, then leaned his big body against Annika.Its all right.Ill play with you.After the others walked off, Sasha stood, staring after the dust the jeep kicked up behind it on the narrow road.What is it?Bran demanded.I dont know.It just feels off.Something.Open to it, Sasha.He laid his hands on her shoulders, rubbed.I cant get there.She doesnt want me to.I just know she wasnt telling the truthor not all of it.I need to clear some of this out.I need to paint awhile.Ive work of my own.We dont feel together, she said as they started for the house.I dont mean you and me.I mean all of us.Last evening, it felt we wereor really close.But now, it feels as if weve all closed into our separate places.Maybe thats what feels off.Id say were all a bit tired.Its been a long day.Thats probably all it is.But she glanced back at the road again, at the dust settling as they climbed the terrace steps.THIRTEEN     			Sasha painted until the sun bled over the western horizon.She couldnt quite lose the edgy feeling, but shed dulled it.Shed hoped to see the jeep drive back by the time she cleaned her brushes, but nothing came up the bumpy little road.She wanted Riley back, wanted her new family under one roof, however silly it sounded.And because shed sensed Riley wanted exactly the oppositeand knew just how it felt to need solitudeshe made herself go down.She supposed shed be in charge of dinneragainand there wasnt any point in resenting it just because she was in a bad mood.But when she stepped into the kitchen, she found Annika carefully chopping peppers.Sawyers teaching me to cook.I like learning.You catch on quick.Doing a big stir fry, he told Sasha.I figured Id just toss stuff in.Anything you dont like, hell, eat around it.I can do that.Anything else I can do?You could crack open a bottle of white.I dont care what kind.Some for this, some for us.That I can also do.It dulled the edge a bit more, watching Sawyer show Annika how to chop and slice, sipping wine while others cooked.
