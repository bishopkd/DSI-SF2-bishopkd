No, Dad, Im good.Its been so great to see you.Ill visit real soon once Im settled in Seattle.Good luck with the interviews.Let me know how they go.Sure thing, Dad.Love you, Annie.Love you too, Dad.He smiles, his brown eyes warm, glowing, and he climbs back into his car.I wave him off as he drives into the dusk, and I wander listlessly back into the apartment.First thing I do is check my cell phone.It needs recharging, so I have to hunt down the charger and plug it in before I can collect my messages.Four missed calls, one voice message, and two texts.Three missed calls from Christian no messages.One missed call from Jos and a voice mail from him wishing me all the best for graduation.I open the texts.*Are you home safe*  *Call me*  They are both from Christian, why didnt he call the house?I head into my bedroom and fire up the mean machine.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Tonight  Date: May 25 2011 23:58  To: Anastasia Steele  I hope you made it home in that car of yours.Let me know if youre okay.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Jeez...why is he so worried about my Beetle.It has given me three years of loyal service, and Jos has always been on hand to maintain it for me.Christians next email is from today.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Soft Limits  Date: May 26 2011 17:22  To: Anastasia Steele  What can I say that I havent already?Happy to talk these through anytime.You looked beautiful today.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.I want to see him.I hit reply  From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Soft Limits  Date: May 26 2011 19:23  To: Christian Grey  I can come over this evening to discuss if youd like.Ana  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Soft Limits  Date: May 26 2011 19:27  To: Anastasia Steele      Ill come to you.I meant it when I said I wasnt happy about you driving that car.Ill be with you shortly.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Holy crap hes coming over now.I have to get one thing ready for him  the first edition Thomas Hardy books are still on the shelves in the living room.I cannot keep them.I wrap them in brown paper, and I scrawl on the wrapping a direct quote from Tess from the book:      Hi.I feel unbearably shy when I open the door.Christian is standing on the porch in his jeans and leather jacket.Hi, he says, and his face lights up with his radiant smile.I take a moment to admire the pretty.Oh my, hes hot in leather.Come in.If I may, he says amused.He holds up a bottle of champagne as he walks in.I thought wed celebrate your graduation.Nothing beats a good Bollinger.Interesting choice of words, I comment dryly.He grins.Oh, I like your ready wit, Anastasia.We only have teacups.Weve packed all the glasses.Teacups?Sounds good to me.I head into the kitchen.Nervous, butterflies flooding my stomach, its like having a panther or mountain lion all unpredictable and predatory in my living room.Do you want saucers as well?Teacups will be fine, Anastasia, Christian calls distractedly from the living room.When I return, hes staring at the brown parcel of books.I place the cups on the table.Thats for you, I murmur anxiously.Crap this is probably going to be a fight.Hmm, I figured as much.Very apt quote.His long index finger absently traces the writing.I thought I was DUrberville, not Angel.You decided on the debasement.He gives me a brief wolfish smile.Trust you to find something that resonates so appropriately.Its also a plea, I whisper.Why am I so nervous?My mouth is dry.A plea?For me to go easy on you?I nod.I bought these for you, he says quietly his gaze impassive.Ill go easier on you if you accept them.I swallow convulsively.Christian, I cant accept them, theyre just too much.You see, this is what I was talking about, you defying me.I want you to have them, and thats the end of the discussion.Its very simple.You dont have to think about this.As a submissive you would just be grateful for them.You just accept what I buy you because it pleases me for you to do so.I wasnt a submissive when you bought them for me, I whisper.No but youve agreed, Anastasia.His eyes turn wary.I sigh.I am not going to win this, so over to plan B.   So they are mine to do with as I wish?He eyes me suspiciously, but concedes.Yes.In that case, Id like to give them to a charity, one working in Darfur since that seems to be close to your heart.They can auction them.If thats what you want to do.His mouth sets into a hard line.Hes disappointed.I flush.Ill think about it, I murmur, I dont want to disappoint him, and his words come back to me.I want you to want to please me.Dont think, Anastasia.Not about this.His tone is quiet and serious.How can I not think?You can pretend to be a car, like his other possessions, my subconscious makes an unwelcome vitriolic return.I ignore her.Oh, cant we rewind?The atmosphere between us is now tense.I dont know what to do.I stare down at my fingers.How do I retrieve this situation?He puts the champagne bottle on the table and stands in front of me.Putting his hand under my chin, he tilts my head up.He gazes down at me, his expression grave.I will buy you lots of things, Anastasia.Get used to it.I can afford it.Im a very wealthy man.He leans down and plants a swift, chaste kiss on my lips.Please.He releases me.Ho my subconscious mouths at me.It makes me feel cheap, I murmur.Christian runs his hand through his hair, exasperated.It shouldnt.Youre over thinking it, Anastasia.Dont place some vague moral judgment on yourself based on what others might think.Dont waste your energy.Its only because you have reservations about our arrangement, thats perfectly natural.You dont know what youre getting yourself into.I frown, trying to process his words.Hey, stop this, he commands softly, cupping my chin again and pulling at it gently so I release my lower lip from my teeth.There is nothing about you that is cheap, Anastasia.I wont have you thinking that.I just bought you some old books that I thought might mean something to you, thats all.Have some champagne.His eyes warm and soften, and I smile tentatively back up at him.Thats better, he murmurs.He picks up the champagne, takes off the foil top and cage, twists the bottle rather than the cork, and opens it with a small pop and a practiced flourish that doesnt spill a drop.He half fills the cups.Its pink, I murmur, surprised.Bollinger Grande Anne Ros 1999, an excellent vintage, he says with relish.In teacups.He grins.In teacups.Congratulations on your degree, Anastasia.We clink cups, and he takes a drink, but I cant help thinking this is really about my capitulation.Thank you, I murmur and take a sip.Of course its delicious.Shall we go through the soft limits?He smiles, and I blush.Always so eager.Christian takes my hand and leads me to the couch where he sits and tugs me down beside him.Youre stepfathers a very taciturn man.Oh not soft limits then.I just want to get this out of the way; the anxiety is gnawing at me.You managed to have him eating out of your hand.I pout.Christian laughs softly.Only because I know how to fish.How do you know he liked fishing?You told me.When we went for coffee.Oh did I?I take another sip.Wow he has a memory for detail.Hmm this champagne really is very good.Did you try the wine at the reception?Christian makes a face.Yes.It was foul.I thought of you when I tasted it.How did you get to be so knowledgeable about wine?Im not knowledgeable, Anastasia, I just know what I like.His gray eyes shine, almost silver, and it makes me flush.Some more?he asks, referring to the champagne.Please.Christian rises gracefully and collects the bottle.He fills my cup.Is he getting me tipsy?I eye him suspiciously.This place looks pretty bare, are you ready for the move?More or less.Are you working tomorrow?Yes, my last day at Claytons  Id help you move, but I promised to meet my sister at the airport.Oh this is news.Mia arrives from Paris very early Saturday morning.Im heading back to Seattle tomorrow, but I hear Elliot is giving you two a hand.Yes, Kate is very excited about that.Christian frowns.Yes, Kate and Elliot, who would have thought?he murmurs, and for some reason, he doesnt look pleased.So what are you doing about work in Seattle?When are we going to talk about the limits?Whats his game?I have a couple of interviews for intern places.You were going tell me this when?He arches a brow.Err Im telling you now.He narrows his eyes.Where?For some reason, possibly because he might use his influence, I dont want to tell him.A couple of publishing houses.Is that what you want to do, something in publishing?I nod warily.Well?He looks at me patiently wanting more information.Well what?Dont be obtuse, Anastasia, which publishing houses?he scolds.Just small ones, I murmur.Why dont you want me to know?Undue influence.He frowns.Oh, now youre being obtuse.He laughs.Obtuse?Me?God, youre challenging.Drink up, lets talk about these limits.He fishes out another copy of my email and the list.Does he wander about with these lists in his pockets?I think theres one in his jacket that I have.Shit, Id better not forget that.I drain my cup.He glances quickly at me.More?Please.He smiles that oh so smug private smile of his, holds the champagne bottle up, and pauses.Have you eaten anything?Oh no not this old chestnut.Yes.I had a three course meal with Ray.I roll my eyes at him.The champagne is making me bold.He leans forward and holds my chin, staring intently into my eyes.Next time you roll your eyes at me, I will take you across my knee.What?!Oh, I breathe, and I can see the excitement in his eyes.Oh, he responds, mirroring my tone.So it begins, Anastasia.My heart slams against my chest, and the butterflies escape from my stomach into my constricting throat.Why is that hot?He fills my cup, and I drink practically all of it.Chastened, I stare up at him.Got your attention now, havent I?I nod.Answer me.Yes youve got my attention.Good, he smiles a knowing smile.So sexual acts.Weve done most of this.I move closer to him on the couch and glance down at the list.APPENDIX 3   Soft Limits   To be discussed and agreed between both parties:  Which of the following sexual acts are acceptable to the Submissive?Masturbation   Fellatio   Cunnilingus   Vaginal intercourse   Vaginal fisting   Anal intercourse   Anal fisting  No fisting, you say.Anything else you object to?he asks softly.I swallow.Anal intercourse doesnt exactly float my boat.Ill agree to the fisting, but Id really like to claim your ass, Anastasia.But well wait for that.Besides, its not something we can dive into, he smirks at me.Your ass will need training.Training?I whisper.Oh yes.Itll need careful preparation.Anal intercourse can be very pleasurable, trust me.But if we try it and you dont like it, we dont have to do it again.He grins down at me.I blink up at him.He thinks Ill enjoy it?How does he know its pleasurable?Have you done that?I whisper.Yes.Holy crap.I gasp.With a man?No.Ive never had sex with a man.Not my scene.Mrs.Robinson?Yes.Holy shit how?I frown.He moves on down the list.Okay swallowing semen.Well, you get an A in that.I flush, and my inner goddess smacks her lips together glowing with pride.So.He looks down at me grinning.Swallowing semen okay?I nod, not able to look him in the eye, and drain my cup again.More?he asks.More.And Im suddenly reminded of our conversation earlier today as he refills my cup.Is he referring to that or just the champagne?Is this whole champagne thing more?Sex toys?he asks.I shrug, glancing down the list.Is the use of sex toys acceptable to the Submissive?Vibrators   Dildos   Butt Plugs   Other  Butt plug?Does it do what it says on the tin?I scrunch my nose up in distaste.Yes, he smiles.And I refer to anal intercourse above.Training.Oh whats in other?Beads, eggs that sort of stuff.Eggs?Im alarmed.Not real eggs, he laughs loudly, shaking his head.I purse my lips at him.Im glad you find me funny.I cant keep my injured feelings out of my voice.He stops laughing.I apologize.Miss Steele, Im sorry, he says, trying to look contrite, but his eyes are still dancing with humor.Any problem with toys?No, I snap.Anastasia, he cajoles.I am sorry.Believe me.I dont mean to laugh.Ive never had this conversation in so much detail.Youre just so inexperienced.Im sorry.His eyes are big and gray and sincere.I thaw a little and take another sip of champagne.Right  bondage, he says, returning to the list.I examine the list, and my inner goddess bounces up and down like a small child waiting for ice cream.Is Bondage acceptable to the Submissive?Hands in front  Hands behind back   Ankles  Knees   Elbows   Wrists to ankles   Spreader bars   Tied to furniture     Blindfolding   Gagging   Bondage with Rope   Bondage with Tape   Bondage with leather cuffs   Suspension   Bondage with handcuffs/metal restraints  Weve talked about suspension.And its fine if you want to set that up as a hard limit.It takes a great deal of time, and I only have you for short periods of time anyway.Anything else?Dont laugh at me, but whats a spreader bar?I promise not to laugh.Ive apologized twice.He glares at me.Dont make me do it again, he warns.And I think I visibly shrink...oh, hes so bossy.A spreader is a bar with cuffs for ankles and/or wrists.Theyre fun.Okay Well gagging me.Id be worried I wouldnt be able to breathe  Id be worried if you couldnt breathe.I dont want to suffocate you.And how will I use safe words if Im gagged?He pauses.First of all, I hope you never have to use them.But if youre gagged, well use hand signals, he says simply.I blink up at him.But if Im trussed up, hows that going to work?My brain is beginning to fog hmm alcohol.Im nervous about the gagging.Okay.Ill take note.I stare up at him, realization dawning.Do you like tying your submissives up so they cant touch you?He gazes at me, his eyes widening.Thats one of the reasons, he says quietly.Is that why youve tied my hands?Yes.You dont like talking about that, I murmur.No, I dont.Would you like another drink?Its making you brave, and I need to know how you feel about pain.Holy crap this is the tricky part.He refills my teacup, and I sip.So, whats your general attitude to receiving pain?Christian looks expectantly at me.Youre biting your lip, he says darkly.I stop immediately, but I dont know what to say.I flush and stare down at my hands.Were you physically punished as a child?No.So you have no sphere of reference at all?No.Its not as bad as you think.Your imagination is your worst enemy in this, he whispers.Do you have to do it?Yes.Why?Goes with the territory, Anastasia.Its what I do.I can see youre nervous.Lets go through methods.He shows me the list.My subconscious runs, screaming, and hides behind the couch.Spanking   Paddling   Whipping   Caning   Biting   Nipple clamps   Genital clamps   Ice   Hot wax   Other types/methods of pain  Well, you said no to genital clamps.Thats fine.Its caning that hurts the most.I blanch.We can work up to that.Or not do it at all, I whisper.This is part of the deal, baby, but well work up to all of this.Anastasia, I wont push you too far.This punishment thing, it worries me the most.My voice is very small.Well, Im glad youve told me.Well keep caning off the list for now.And as you get more comfortable with this stuff, well increase intensity.Well take it slow.I swallow, and he leans forward and kisses me on my lips.There, that wasnt so bad was it?I shrug, my heart in mouth again.Look, I want to talk about one more thing, then Im taking you to bed.Bed?I blink rapidly, and my blood pounds round my body, warming places I didnt know existed until very recently.Come on, Anastasia, talking through all this, I want to fuck you into next week, right now.It must be having some effect on you too.I squirm.My inner goddess is panting.See?Beside, theres something I want to try.Something painful?No  stop seeing pain everywhere.Its mainly pleasure.Have I hurt you yet?I flush.No.Well then.Look, earlier today you were talking about wanting more, he halts, uncertain all of a sudden.Oh my wheres this going?He clasps my hand.Outside of the time youre my sub, perhaps we could try.I dont know if it will work.I dont know about separating everything.It may not work.But Im willing to try.Maybe one night a week.I dont know.Holy cow my mouth drops open, my subconscious is in shock, Christian Grey is up for more!Hes willing to try!My subconscious peeks out from behind the couch, still registering shock on her harpy face.I have one condition.He looks warily at my stunned expression.What?I breathe.Anything.Ill give you anything.You graciously accept my graduation present to you.Oh.And deep down I know what it is.Dread spawns in my belly.Hes staring down at me, gauging my reaction.Come, he murmurs and rises, dragging me up.Taking his jacket off, he drapes it over my shoulders and heads for the door.Parked outside is a red hatchback car, a two door compact Audi.Its for you.Happy graduation, he murmurs, pulling me into his arms and kissing my hair.Hes bought me a damned car, brand new by the looks of it.Jeez Ive had enough trouble with the books.I stare at it blankly, trying desperately to determine how I feel about this.I am appalled on one level, grateful on another, shocked that hes actually done it, but the overriding emotion is anger.Yes, Im angry, especially after everything I told him about the books but then hed already bought this.Taking my hand, he leads me down the path toward this new acquisition.Anastasia, that Beetle of yours is old and frankly dangerous.I would never forgive myself if something happened to you when its so easy for me to make it right, he trails off.His eyes are on me, but at the moment I cannot bring myself to look at him.I stand silently staring at its awesome bright red newness.I mentioned it to your stepfather.He was all for it, he murmurs.Turning, I glare at him, my mouth open in horror.You mentioned this to Ray.How could you?I can barely spit the words out.How dare he?Poor Ray.I feel sick, mortified for my dad.Its a gift, Anastasia.Cant you just say thank you?But you know its too much.Not to me it isnt, not for my peace of mind.I frown at him, at a loss what to say.He just doesnt get it!Hes had money all his life.Okay, not all his life  not as a small child  and my world view shifts.The thought is very sobering, and I soften towards the car, feeling guilty about my fit of pique.His intentions are good, misguided, but not from a bad place.Im happy for you to loan this to me, like the laptop.He sighs heavily.Okay.On loan.Indefinitely.He looks warily at me.No, not indefinitely, but for now.Thank you.He frowns.I reach up and kiss him briefly on his cheek.Thank you for the car, sir.I say as sweetly as I can manage.He grabs me suddenly and yanks me up against him, one hand at my back holding me to him and the other fisting in my hair.You are one challenging woman, Ana Steele.He kisses me passionately, forcing my lips apart with his tongue, taking no prisoners.My blood heats immediately, and Im returning his kiss with my own passion.I want him badly  in spite of the car, the books, the soft limits the caning I want him.Its taking all my self control not to fuck you on the hood of this car right now, just to show you that you are mine, and if I want to buy you a fucking car, Ill buy you a fucking car, he growls.Now lets get you inside and naked.He plants a swift rough kiss on me.Boy, hes angry.He grabs my hand and leads me back into the apartment and straight into my bedroom no passing go.My subconscious is behind the sofa again, head hidden under her hands.He switches on the sidelight and halts, staring at me.Please dont be angry with me, I whisper.His gaze is impassive; his gray eyes cold shards of smoky glass.Im sorry about the car and the books, I trail off.He remains silent and brooding.You scare me when youre angry, I breathe, staring at him.He closes his eyes and shakes his head.When he opens them, his expression has softened fractionally.He takes a deep breath and swallows.Turn round, he whispers.I want to get you out of that dress.Another mercurial mood swing, its so hard to keep up.Obediently, I turn and my heart is thumping, desire instantly replacing unease, coursing through my blood and settling dark and yearning low, low in my belly.He scoops my hair off my back so it hangs down my right side, curling at my breast.He places his index finger at the nape of my neck and achingly slowly drags it down my spine.His well manicured fingernail gently grazes down my back.I like this dress, he murmurs.I like to see your flawless skin.His finger reaches the back of my halter dress midway down my spine, and hooking his finger beneath the top, he pulls me closer so that I step back against him.I feel him flush against my body.Leaning down, he inhales my hair.You smell so good, Anastasia.So sweet.His nose skims past my ear down my neck, and he trails soft, feather light kisses along my shoulder.My breathing changes, becoming shallow, rushed, full of expectation.His fingers are at my zipper.Achingly slow, once more he eases it down while his lips move, licking and kissing and sucking their way across to my other shoulder.He is so tantalizingly good at this.My body resonates, and I start to squirm languidly beneath his touch.You.Are.Going.To.Have.To.Learn.To.Keep.Still, he whispers, kissing me around my nape between each word.He tugs at the fastening at the halter neck, and the dress drops and pools at my feet.No bra, Miss Steele.I like that.His hands reach round and cup my breasts, and my nipples pucker at his touch.Lift your arms and put them around my head, he murmurs against my neck.I obey immediately, and my breasts rise and push into his hands, my nipples hardening further.My fingers weave into his hair, and very gently I tug his soft, sexy hair.I roll my head to one side to give him easier access to my neck.Mmm  he murmurs into that space behind my ear, as he starts to extend my nipples with his long fingers, mirroring my hands in his hair.I groan as the sensation registers sharp and clear in my groin.Shall I make you come this way?he whispers.I arch my back to force my breasts into his expert hands.You like this, dont you, Miss Steele?Mmm   Tell me.He continues the slow sensuous torture, pulling gently.Yes.Yes, what.Yes Sir.Good girl.He pinches me hard, and my body writhes convulsively against his front.I gasp at the exquisite, acute, pleasure/pain.I feel him against me.I moan and my hands clench in his hair pulling harder.I dont think youre ready to come yet, he whispers, stilling his hands, and he gently bites my earlobe and tugs at it.Besides, you have displeased me.Oh no, what will this mean?My brain registers through the fog of needy desire as I groan.So perhaps I wont let you come after all.He returns the attention of his fingers to my nipples, pulling, twisting, kneading.I grind my behind against him moving side to side.I feel his grin against my neck as his hands move down to my hips.His fingers hook into my panties at the back, stretching them, and he pushes his thumbs through the material, shredding them and tossing them in front of me so I can see  holy shit.His hands move down to my sex and from behind, he slowly inserts his finger.Oh, yes.My sweet girl is all ready, he breathes as he whirls me round so Im facing him.His breathing has quickened.He puts his finger in his mouth.You taste so fine, Miss Steele.He sighs.Undress me, he commands quietly, staring down at me, eyes hooded.All Im wearing is my shoes, well, Kates high heeled pumps.Im taken aback.Ive never undressed a man.You can do it, he cajoles softly.Oh my.I blink rapidly.Where to start?I reach for his t shirt, and he grabs my hands and shakes his head, smiling slyly at me.Oh no.He shakes his head, grinning.Not the t shirt, you may need to touch me for what I have planned.His eyes are alive with excitement.Oh this is news I can touch with clothes.He takes one of my hands and places it against his erection.This is the effect you have on me, Miss Steele.I gasp and flex my fingers around his girth, and he grins.I want to be inside you.Take my jeans off.Youre in charge.Holy fuck me in charge.My mouth drops open.What are you going to do with me?he teases.Oh the possibilities my inner goddess roars, and from somewhere born of frustration, need, and sheer Steele bravery, I push him on to the bed.He laughs as he falls, and I gaze down at him feeling victorious.My inner goddess is going to explode.I yank off his shoes, quickly, clumsily, and his socks.Hes staring up at me, his eyes luminous with amusement and desire.He looks glorious mine.I crawl up the bed and sit astride him to undo his jeans, sliding my fingers under the waistband, feeling the hair in his oh so happy trail.He closes his eyes and flexes his hips.Youll have to learn to keep still, I scold, and I tug at the hair under his waistband.His breath hitches, and he grins at me.Yes, Miss Steele, he murmurs, eyes burning bright.In my pocket, condom, he breathes.I search in his pocket slowly, watching his face as I feel around.His mouth is open.I fish out both foil packets that I find and lay them on the bed by his hips.Two!My over eager fingers reach for the button of his waistband and undo it, fumbling a little.I am beyond excited.So eager, Miss Steele, he murmurs, his voice laced with humor.I tug down the zipper, and now Im faced with the problem of removing his pants hmm.I shuffle down and pull.They hardly move.I frown.How can this be so difficult?I cant keep still if youre going to bite that lip, he warns, then arches his pelvis up off the bed so Im able to tug down his trousers and his boxers at the same time, whoa  freeing him.He kicks his clothes to the floor.Holy Moses, hes all mine to play with, and suddenly its Christmas.Now what are you going to do?he breathes, all trace of humor gone.I reach up and touch him, watching his expression as I do.His mouth shapes like a letter O as he takes a sharp breath.His skin is so smooth and soft and hard hmm, what a delicious combination.I lean forward, my hair falling around me, and hes in my mouth.I suck, hard.He closes his eyes, his hips jerking beneath me.Jeez, Ana, steady, he groans.I feel so powerful, its such a heady feeling, teasing and testing him with my mouth and tongue.He tenses underneath me as I run my mouth up and down him, pushing him to the back of my throat, my lips tight again and again.Stop, Ana, stop.I dont want to come.I sit up, blinking at him, and Im panting like him, but confused.I thought I was in charge?My inner goddess looks like someone snatched her ice cream.Youre innocence and enthusiasm is very disarming, he gasps.You, on top thats what we need to do.Oh.Here, put this on.He hands me a foil packet.Holy Crap.How?I rip the packet open, and the rubbery condom is all tacky in my fingers.Pinch the top and then roll it down.You dont want any air in the end of that sucker,  he pants.And very slowly, concentrating hard, I do as Im told.Christ, youre killing me here, Anastasia, he groans.I admire my handiwork and him.He really is a fine specimen of a man, looking at him is very, very arousing.Now.I want to be buried inside you, he murmurs.I stare down at him, daunted, and he sits up suddenly, so were nose to nose.Like this, he breathes, and he snakes one hand round my hips, lifting me slightly, and with the other he positions himself beneath me, and very slowly, eases me on to him.I groan as he stretches me open, filling me, my mouth hanging open in surprise at the sweet, sublime, agonizing, over full feeling.Oh please.Thats right, baby, feel me, all of me, he growls and briefly closes his eyes.And hes inside me, sheathed to the hilt, and he holds me in place, for seconds minutes I have no idea,, staring intently into my eyes.Its deep this way, he murmurs.He flexes and swivels his hips in the same motion, and I groan oh my  the sensation radiates throughout my belly everywhere.Fuck!Again, I whisper.He grins a lazy grin and obliges.Moaning, I throw my head back, my hair tumbling down my back, and very slowly, he sinks back down on to the bed.You move, Anastasia, up and down, how you want.Take my hands, he breathes, his voice hoarse and low and oh so sexy.I clasp his hands, holding on for life.Gently I push off him and back down, oh my.His eyes are burning with wild anticipation.His breathing is ragged, matching mine, and he lifts his pelvis as I come down, bouncing me back up.We pick up the rhythm up, down, up, down over and over and it feels so good.Between my panting breaths, the deep down, brimming fullness the vehement sensation pulsing through me thats building quickly, I watch him, our eyes locked and I see wonder there, wonder at me.I am fucking him.I am in charge.Hes mine, and Im his.The thought pushes me, weighted with concrete, over the edge, and I climax around him shouting incoherently.He grabs my hips, and closing his eyes, tipping his head back, his jaw strained, he comes quietly.I collapse on to his chest, overwhelmed, somewhere between fantasy and reality, a place where there are no hard or soft limits.Slowly the outside world invades my senses, and oh my, what an invasion.I am floating, my limbs soft and languid, utterly spent.Im lying on top of him, my head on his chest, and he smells divine: fresh, laundered linen and some expensive body wash, and the best, most seductive scent on the planet Christian.I dont want to move, I want to breathe this elixir for eternity.I nuzzle him, wishing I didnt have the barrier of his t shirt.And as rhyme and reason return to the rest of my body, I stretch my hand out on his chest.This is the first time Ive touched him here.Hes firm strong.His hand swoops up and grabs mine, but he softens the blow by pulling it to his mouth and sweetly kissing my knuckles.He rolls over so hes gazing down at me.Dont, he murmurs, then kisses me lightly.Why dont you like to be touched?I whisper, staring up into soft gray eyes.Because Im fifty shades of fucked up, Anastasia.Oh his honesty is completely disarming.I blink up at him.I had a very tough introduction to life.I dont want to burden you with the details.Just dont.He strokes his nose against mine, and then he pulls out of me and sits up.I think thats all the very basics covered.How was that?He looks thoroughly pleased with himself and sounds very matter of fact at the same time, like hes just marked another tick box in a checklist.Im still reeling from the tough introduction to life comment.Its so frustrating  I am desperate to know more.But he wont tell me.I cock my head to one side, like he does, and make an enormous effort to smile at him.If you imagine for one minute that I think you ceded control to me, well you havent taken into account my GPA.I smile shyly at him.But thank you for the illusion.Miss Steele, you are not just a pretty face.Youve had six orgasms so far and all of them belong to me, he boasts, playful again.I flush and blink at the same time, as he stares down at me.Hes keeping count!His brow furrows.Do you have something to tell me?his voice is suddenly stern.I frown .Crap.I had a dream this morning.Oh?He glares at me.Double crap.Am I in trouble?I came in my sleep.I throw my arm over my eyes.He says nothing.I peek up at him from under my arm, and he looks amused.In your sleep?Woke me up.Im sure it did.What were you dreaming about?Crap.You.What was I doing?I throw my arm over my eyes again.And like a small child, I briefly entertain the thought that if I cant see him, then he cant see me.Anastasia, what was I doing?I wont ask you again.You had a riding crop.He moves my arm.Really?Yes.I am crimson.Theres hope for you yet, he murmurs.I have several riding crops.Brown plaited leather?He laughs.No, but Im sure I could get one.His gray eyes blaze with excitement.Leaning down, he gives me a brief kiss then stands and grabs his boxers, oh no hes going.I glance quickly at the time  its only nine forty.I scoot out of bed too and grab my sweat pants and a cami top, then sit back on the bed, cross legged, watching him.I dont want him to go.What can I do?When is your period due?He interrupts my thoughts.What!I hate wearing these things, he grumbles.He holds up the condom, then puts it on the floor, and slips on his jeans.Well?he prompts when I dont reply, and he looks at me expectantly as if hes waiting for my opinion on the weather.Holy crap this is personal stuff.Next week.I stare down at my hands.You need to sort out some contraception.He is so bossy.I stare at him blankly.He sits back on the bed as he puts on his shoes and socks.Do you have a doctor?I shake my head.We are back to mergers and acquisitions  another 180 degree mood swing.He frowns.I can have mine come and see you at your apartment  Sunday morning before you come and see me.Or he can see you at my place.Which would you prefer?No pressure then.Something else that hes paying for but actually this is for his benefit.Your place.That means I am guaranteed to see him Sunday.Okay.Ill let you know the time.Are you leaving?Dont go stay with me please.Yes.Why?How are you getting back?I whisper.Taylor will pick me up.I can drive you.I have a lovely new car.He gazes at me, his expression warm.Thats more like it.But I think youve had too much to drink.Did you get me tipsy on purpose?Yes.Why?Because you over think everything, and youre reticent like your stepdad.A drop of wine in you and you start talking, and I need you to communicate honestly with me.Otherwise you clam up, and I have no idea what youre thinking.In vino veritas, Anastasia.And you think youre always honest with me?I endeavor to be.He looks down at me warily.This will only work if were honest with each other.Id like you to stay and use this.I hold up the second condom.He smiles and his eyes glow with humor.Anastasia, I have crossed so many lines here tonight.I have to go.Ill see you on Sunday.Ill have the revised contract ready for you, and then we can really start to play.Play?Holy shit.My heart leaps into my mouth.Id like to do a scene with you.But I wont until youve signed, so I know youre ready.Oh.So I could stretch this out, if I dont sign?He gazes at me assessing, and then his lips twitch into a smile.Well, I suppose you could, but I may crack under the strain.Crack?How?My inner goddess has woken and is paying attention.He nods slowly, and then he grins, teasing.Could get really ugly.His grin is infectious.Ugly, how?Oh you know, explosions, car chases, kidnapping, incarceration.Youd kidnap me?Oh yes, he grins.Hold me against my will?Jeez this is hot.Oh yes, he nods.And then were talking TPE 24/7.Youve lost me, I breathe, my heart is pounding is he serious?Total Power Exchange  round the clock.His eyes are shining, and I can feel his excitement from where I sit.Holy shit.So you have no choice, he says sardonically.Clearly.I cant keep the sarcasm out of my voice as my eyes reach for the heavens.Oh, Anastasia Steele, did you just roll your eyes at me?Crap.No, I squeak.I think you did.What did I say Id do to you if you rolled your eyes at me again?Shit.He sits down on the edge of the bed.Come here, he says softly.I blanch.Jeez hes serious.I sit staring at him completely immobile.I havent signed, I whisper.I told you what Id do.Im a man of my word.Im going to spank you, and then Im going to fuck you very quick and very hard.Looks like well need that condom after all.His voice is so soft, menacing, and its damned hot.My insides practically contort with potent, needy, liquid, desire.He gazes at me, waiting, eyes blazing.Tentatively, I uncurl my legs.Should I run?This is it, our relationship hangs in the balance, right here, right now.Do I let him do this or do I say no, and then thats it?Because I know it will be over if I say no.Do it!My inner goddess pleads with me, my subconscious is as paralyzed as I am.Im waiting, he says.Im not a patient man.Oh for the love of all thats holy.Im panting, afraid, turned on.Blood pounding through my body, my legs are like jelly.Slowly, I crawl over to him until I am beside him.Good girl, he murmurs.Now stand up.Oh shit cant he just get this over with?Im not sure if I can stand.Hesitantly, I clamber to my feet.He holds his hand out, and I place the condom in his palm.Suddenly he grabs me, tipping me across his lap.With one smooth movement, he angles his body so my torso is resting on the bed beside him.He throws his right leg over both of mine and plants his left forearm on the small of my back, holding me down so I cannot move.Oh fuck.Put your hands up on either side of your head, he orders.I obey immediately.Why am I doing this, Anastasia?he asks.Because I rolled my eyes at you, I can barely speak.Do you think thats polite?No.Will you do it again?No.I will spank you each time you do it, do you understand?Very slowly, he pulls down my sweatpants.Oh, how demeaning is this, demeaning and scary and hot.Hes making such a meal of this.My heart is in my mouth.I can barely breathe.Shit, is this going to hurt?He places his hand on my naked behind, softly fondling me, stroking round and round with his flat palm.And then his hand is no longer there and he hits me  hard.Ow!My eyes spring open in response to the pain, and I try to rise, but his hand moves between my shoulder blades keeping me down.He caresses me again where hes hit me, and his breathings changed  its louder, harsher.He hits me again and again, quickly in succession.Holy fuck it hurts.I make no sound, my face screwed up against the pain.I try and wriggle away from the blows  spurred on by adrenaline spiking and coursing through my body.Keep still, he growls.Or Ill spank you for longer.Hes rubbing me now, and the blow follows.A rhythmic pattern emerges, caress, fondle, slap hard.I have to concentrate to handle this pain.My mind empties as I endeavor to absorb the grueling sensation.He doesnt hit me in the same place twice in succession   hes spreading the pain.Aargh!I cry out on the tenth slap  and Im unaware that I have been mentally counting the blows.Im just getting warmed up.He hits me again then he strokes me softly.The combination of the hard stinging blow and his gentle caress is so mind numbing.He hits me again this is getting harder to take.My face hurts, its screwed up so tight.He strokes me gently and then the blow comes.I cry out again.No one to hear you, baby, just me.And he hits me again and again.From somewhere deep inside, I want to beg him to stop.But I dont.I dont want to give him the satisfaction.He continues the unrelenting rhythm.I cry out six more times.Eighteen slaps in total.My body is singing, singing from his merciless assault.Enough, he breathes hoarsely.Well done, Anastasia.Now Im going to fuck you.He caresses my behind gently, and it burns as he strokes me round and round and down.Suddenly, he inserts two fingers inside me, taking me completely by surprise.I gasp, this new assault breaking through the numbness around my brain.Feel this.See how much your body likes this, Anastasia.Youre soaking just for me.There is awe in his voice.He moves his fingers, in and out in quick succession.I groan, no surely not, and then his fingers are gone and Im left wanting.Next time, I will get you to count.Now wheres that condom?He reaches beside him for the condom and lifts me gently, pushing me face down onto the bed.I hear the sound of his zipper and the rip of the foil.He drags my sweatpants off and then guides me into a kneeling position, gently caressing my now very sore behind.Im going to take you now.You can come, he murmurs.What?Like I have a choice.And hes inside me, quickly filling me, I moan loudly.He moves, pounding into me, a fast, intense pace against my sore behind.The feeling is beyond exquisite, raw and debas ing and mind blowing.My senses are ravaged, disconnected, solely concentrating on what hes doing to me.How hes making me feel, that familiar pull deep in my belly, tightening, quickening.NO and my traitorous body explodes in an intense, body shattering orgasm.Oh, Ana!he cries out loudly as he finds his release, holding me in place as he pours himself into me.He collapses, panting hard beside me, and he pulls me on top of him and buries his face in my hair, holding me close.Oh, baby, he breathes.Welcome to my world.We lie there, panting together, waiting for our breathing to slow.He gently strokes my hair.Im on his chest again.But this time, I dont have the strength to lift my hand and feel him.Boy I survived.That wasnt so bad.Im more stoic than I thought.My inner goddess is prostrate well at least shes quiet.Christian nuzzles my hair again, inhaling deeply.Well done, baby, he whispers, quiet joy in his voice.His words curl around me like a soft fluffy towel from the Heathman Hotel, and Im so pleased that hes happy.He picks at the strap on my camisole.Is this what you sleep in?he asks gently.Yes, I breathe sleepily.You should be in silks and satins, you beautiful girl.Ill take you shopping.I like my sweats, I murmur, trying and failing to sound irritated.He kisses my head again.Well see, he says.We lie for a few more minutes, hours, who knows, and I think I doze.I have to go, he says, and leaning down, he kisses my forehead gently.Are you okay?His voice is soft.I think about his question.My backside is sore.Well, glowing now, and amazingly I feel, apart from exhausted, radiant.The realization is humbling, unexpected.I dont understand.Holy shit.Im okay, I whisper.I dont want to say more than that.He rises.Wheres your bathroom?Along the corridor to the left.He scoops up the other condom and heads out of the bedroom.I rise stiffly and put my sweatpants back on.They chafe a little against my still smarting behind.Im so confused by my reaction.I remember him saying  I cant remember when  that I would feel so much better after a good hiding.How can that be so?I really dont get it.But strangely, I do.I cant say that I enjoyed the experience, in fact, I would still go a long way to avoid it, but now I have this safe, weird, bathed in afterglow, sated feeling.I put my head in my hands.I just dont understand.Christian re enters the room.I cant look him in the eye.I stare down at my hands.I found some baby oil.Let me rub it into your behind.What?No.Ill be fine.Anastasia, he warns, and I want to roll my eyes but quickly stop myself.I stand facing the bed.Sitting beside me, he gently pulls my sweatpants down again.Up and down like whores drawers my subconscious remarks bitterly.In my head, I tell her where to go.Christian squirts baby oil into his hand and then rubs my behind with careful tenderness   from makeup remover to smoothing balm for a spanked ass, who would have thought it was such a versatile liquid.I like my hands on you, he murmurs, and I have to agree, me too.There, he says when hes finished, and he pulls my pants up again.I glance over at my clock.Its ten thirty.Im leaving now.Ill see you out.I still cant look at him.Taking my hand, he leads me to the front door.Fortunately, Kate is still not home.She must still be having dinner with her folks and Ethan.Im really glad shes not been around to hear my chastisement.Dont you have to call Taylor?I ask, avoiding eye contact.Taylors been here since nine.Look at me, he breathes.I struggle to meet his eyes, but when I do, hes gazing down at me with wonder.You didnt cry, he murmurs, then grabs me suddenly and kisses me fervently.Sunday, he whispers against my lips, and its both a promise and a threat.I watch him walk down the path and climb into the big black Audi.He doesnt look back.I close the door and stand helpless in the living room of an apartment that I shall only spend another two nights in.A place I have lived happily for almost four years yet today, for the first time ever, I feel lonely and uncomfortable here, unhappy with my own company.Have I strayed so far from who I am?I know that lurking, not very far under my rather numb exterior, is a well of tears.What am I doing?The irony is I cant even sit down and enjoy a good cry.Ill have to stand.I know its late, but I decide to call my mom.Honey, how are you?How was graduation?she enthuses down the phone.Her voice is a soothing balm.Sorry its so late, I whisper.She pauses.Ana?Whats wrong?Shes all seriousness now.Nothing, Mom, I just wanted to hear your voice.Shes silent for a moment.Ana, what is it?Please tell me.Her voice is soft and comforting, and I know that she cares.Uninvited, my tears begin to flow.I have cried so often in the last few days.Please, Ana, she says, and her anguish reflects mine.Oh, Mom, its a man.Whats he done to you?Her alarm is palpable.Its not like that.Although it is Oh crap.I dont want to worry her.I just want someone else to be strong for me at the moment.Ana, please, youre worrying me.I take a big breath.Ive kind of fallen for this guy, and hes so different from me, and I dont know if we should be together.Oh, darling.I wish I could be with you.I am so sorry I missed your graduation.Youve fallen for someone, finally.Oh, honey, men, they are so tricky.Theyre a different species, honey.How long have you known him?Christian is definitely a different species different planet.Oh, nearly three weeks or so.Ana, darling, thats no time at all.How can you possibly know someone in that kind of time frame?Just take it easy with him and keep him at arms length until you decide whether hes worthy of you.Wow its unnerving when my mother is so insightful, but shes just too late on this.Is he worthy of me?Thats an interesting concept.I always wonder whether I am worthy of him.Honey, you sound so unhappy.Come home  visit with us.I miss you, darling.Bob would love to see you too.You can get some distance and maybe some perspective.You need a break.Youve been working so hard.Oh boy, is this tempting.Run away to Georgia.Grab some sunshine, some cocktails.My mothers good humor her loving arms.I have two job interviews in Seattle on Monday.Oh, thats wonderful news.The door opens and Kate appears, grinning at me.Her face falls when she sees Ive been crying.Mom, I have to go.Ill think about a visit.Thank you.Honey, please, dont let a man get under your skin.Youre far too young.Go and enjoy yourself.Yes, Mom, love you.Oh, Ana, I love you too, so much.Stay safe, honey.I hang up and face Kate who glares at me.Has that obscenely rich fucker upset you again?No sort of err yes.Just tell him to take a hike, Ana.Youve been so up and down since you met him.Ive never seen you like this.The world of Katherine Kavanagh is very clear, very black and white.Not the intangible, mysterious, vague hues of gray that color my world .Welcome to my world.Sit, lets talk.Lets have some wine.Oh, youve had champagne.She spies the bottle.Some good stuff too.I smile ineffectually, looking apprehensively at the couch.I approach it with caution.Hmm sitting.Are you okay?I fell over and landed on my behind.She doesnt think to question my explanation, because I am one of the most un coordinated people in Washington State.I never thought Id see that as a blessing.I sit down gingerly, pleasantly surprised that Im okay, and turn my attention to Kate, but my mind glazes over and Im pulled back to the Heathman  Well, if you were mine you wouldnt be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday.He said it then, and all      I could concentrate on at the time was being his.All the warning signs were there, I was just too clueless and too enamored to notice.Kate comes back into the living area with a bottle of red wine and washed teacups.Here we go.She hands me a cup of wine.It wont taste as good as the Bolly.Ana, if hes a jerk with commitment issues, dump him.Though I dont really understand his commitment issues.He couldnt take his eyes off you in the marquee, watched you like a hawk.Id say he was completely smitten, but maybe he has a funny way of showing it.Smitten?Christian?Funny way of showing it?Ill say.Kate, its complicated.How was your evening?I ask.I cant talk this through with Kate without revealing too much, but one question on her day and Kate is off.Its so reassuring to sit and listen to her normal chatter.The hot news is that Ethan may be coming to live with us after their holiday.That will be fun  Ethan is a hoot.I frown.I dont think Christian will approve.Well tough.Hell just have to suck it up.I have a couple of teacups of wine and decide to call it a night.Its been one very long day.Kate hugs me, and then grabs the phone to call Elliot.I check the mean machine after I brush my teeth.Theres an email from Christian.From: Christian Grey  Subject: You  Date: May 26 2011 23:14  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele  You are quite simply exquisite.The most beautiful, intelligent, witty and brave woman I have ever met.Take some Advil  this is not a request.And dont drive your Beetle again.I will know.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Oh, not drive my car again!I type out my reply.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Flattery  Date: May 26 2011 23:20  To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grey  Flattery will get you nowhere, but since youve been everywhere the point is moot.I will need to drive my Beetle to a garage so I can sell it  so will not graciously accept any of your nonsense over that.Red wine is always more preferable to Advil.Ana  PS: Caning is a HARD limit for me.I hit send.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Frustrating women who cant take compliments Date: May 26 2011 23:26  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Ms.Steele  I am not flattering you.You should go to bed.I accept your addition to the hard limits.Dont drink too much.Taylor will dispose of your car and get a good price for it too.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Taylor  Is he the right man for the job?Date: May 26 2011 23:40  To: Christian Grey  Dear Sir  I am intrigued that you are happy to risk letting your right hand man drive my car  but not some woman you fuck occasionally.How can I be sure that Taylor is the man to get me the best deal for said car?I have, in the past, probably before I met you, been known to drive a hard bargain.Ana  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Careful!Date: May 26 2011 23:44  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Ms.Steele  I am assuming it is the RED WINE talking, and that youve had a very long day.Though I am tempted to drive back over there to ensure that you dont sit down for a week, rather than an evening.Taylor is ex army and capable of driving anything from a motorcycle to a Sherman Tank.Your car does not present a hazard to him.Now please do not refer to yourself as some woman I fuck occasionally because, quite frankly it makes me MAD, and you really wouldnt like me when Im angry.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Careful yourself  Date: May 26 2011 23:57  To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grey  Im not sure I like you anyway, especially at the moment.Ms.Steele  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Careful yourself  Date: May 27 2011 00:03  To: Anastasia Steele  Why dont you like me?Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Careful yourself  Date: May 27 2011 00:09  To: Christian Grey  Because you never stay with me.There, thats given him something to think about.I shut the machine down with a flourish I dont really feel and crawl into my bed.I switch off my sidelight and stare up at the ceiling.Its been one long day, one emotional wrench after another.It was heartwarming to spend some time with Ray.He looked well, and weirdly he approved of Christian.Jeez, Kate and her gargantuan mouth.Hearing Christian speak about being hungry.What the hell is that all about?God, and the car.I havent even told Kate about the new car.What was Christian thinking?And then this evening, he actually hit me.Ive never been hit in my life.What have I gotten myself into?Very slowly, my tears, halted by Kates arrival, begin to slide down the side of my face and into my ears.I have fallen for someone whos so emotionally shut down, I will only get hurt  deep down I know this  someone who by his own admission is completely fucked up.Why is he so fucked up?It must be awful to be as affected as he is, and the thought that as a toddler he suffered some unbearable cruelty makes me cry harder.Perhaps if he was more normal he wouldnt want you, my subconscious contributes snidely to my musings and in my heart of hearts I know this is true.I turn into my pillow and the sluice gates open and for the first time in years, I am sobbing uncontrollably into my pillow.I am momentarily distracted from my dark night of the soul by Kate shouting.What the fuck do you think youre doing here?Well you cant!What the fuck have you done to her now?Since shes met you she cries all the time.You cant come in here!Christian bursts into my bedroom and unceremoniously switches on the overhead light, making me squint.Jesus, Ana, he mutters.He flicks the switch off again and is at my side in a moment.What are you doing here?I gasp between sobs.Crap.I cant stop crying.He switches on the sidelight making me squint again.Kate comes and stands in the doorway.Do you want me to throw this asshole out?she asks, radiating thermo nuclear hostility.Christian raises his eyebrows at her, no doubt surprised by her flattering epithet and her feral antagonism.I shake my head, and she rolls her eyes at me.Oh I wouldnt do that near Mr.G.   Just holler if you need me, she says more gently.Grey  your cards are marked,  she hisses at him.He nods at her, and she turns and pulls the door to but doesnt close it.Christian gazes down at me, his expression grave, his face ashen.Hes wearing his pinstriped jacket, and from his inside pocket, he pulls out a handkerchief and hands it to me.I think I still have his other one somewhere.Whats going on?he asks quietly.Why are you here?I ask, ignoring his question.My tears have miraculously ceased, but Im left with dry heaves racking my body.Part of my role is to look after your needs.You said you wanted me to stay, so here I am.And yet I find you like this.He blinks at me, truly bewildered.Im sure Im responsible, but I have no idea why.Is it because I hit you?I pull myself up, wincing from my sore behind.I sit and face him.Did you take some Advil?I shake my head.He narrows his eyes, stands, and leaves the room.I hear him talking to Kate but not what they are saying.Hes back a few moments later with pills and a teacup of water.Take these, he orders gently as he sits on my bed beside me.I do as Im told.Talk to me, he whispers.You told me you were okay.Id never have left you if I thought you were like this.I stare down at my hands.What can I say that I havent said already?I want more.I want him to stay because he wants to stay with me, not because Im a blubbering mess, and I dont want him to beat me, is that so unreasonable?I take it that when you said you were okay, you werent.I flush.I thought I was fine.Anastasia, you cant tell me what you think I want to hear.Thats not very honest,  he admonishes me.How can I trust anything youve said to me?I peek up at him, and hes frowning, a bleak look in his eye.He runs both hands through his hair.How did you feel while I was hitting you and after?I didnt like it.Id rather you didnt do it again.You werent meant to like it.Why do you like it?I stare up at him.My question surprises him.You really want to know?Oh, trust me, Im fascinated.And I cant quite keep the sarcasm out of my voice.He narrows his eyes again.Careful, he warns.I blanch.Are you going to hit me again?I challenge.No, not tonight.Phew...my subconscious and I both breathe a silent sigh of relief.So, I prompt.I like the control it brings me, Anastasia.I want you to behave in a particular way, and if you dont, I shall punish you, and you will learn to behave the way I desire.I enjoy punishing you.Ive wanted to spank you since you asked me if I was gay.I flush at the memory .Jeez, I wanted to spank myself after that question.So Katherine Kavanagh is responsible for all this, and if shed gone to that interview and asked her gay question, shed be sitting here with the sore ass.I dont like that thought.How confusing is this?So you dont like the way I am.He stares at me, bewildered again.I think youre lovely the way you are.So why are you trying to change me?I dont want to change you.Id like you to be courteous and to follow the set of rules Ive given you and not defy me.Simple, he says.But you want to punish me?Yes I do.Thats what I dont understand.He sighs and runs his hands through his hair again.Its the way Im made, Anastasia.I need to control you.I need you to behave in a certain way, and if you dont  I love to watch your beautiful alabaster skin pink and warm up under my hands.It turns me on.Holy shit.Now were getting somewhere.So its not the pain youre putting me through?He swallows.A bit, to see if you can take it, but thats not the whole reason.Its the fact that you are mine to do with as I see fit  ultimate control over someone else.And it turns me on.Big time, Anastasia.Look, Im not explaining myself very well Ive never had to before.Ive not really thought about this in any great depth.Ive always been with like minded people, he shrugs apologetically.And you still havent answered my question  how did you feel afterwards?Confused.You were sexually aroused by it, Anastasia, he closes his eyes briefly, and when he re opens them and gazes at me, they are smoldering smoky embers.His expression pulls at that dark part of me, buried in the depths of my belly  my libido, woken and tamed by him, but even now, insatiable.Dont look at me like that, he murmurs.I frown.Jeez what have I done now?I dont have any condoms, Anastasia, and you know, youre upset.Contrary to what your roommate believes, Im not a priapic monster.So, you felt confused?I squirm under his intense gaze.You have no problem being honest with me in print.Your emails always tell me exactly how you feel.Why cant you do that in conversation?Do I intimidate you that much?I pick at an imaginary spot on my mothers blue and cream quilt.You beguile me, Christian.Completely overwhelm me.I feel like Icarus flying too close to the Sun, I whisper.He gasps.Well, I think youve got that the wrong way around, he whispers.What?Oh, Anastasia, youve bewitched me.Isnt it obvious?No, not to me.Bewitched my inner goddess is staring open mouthed.Even she doesnt believe this.Youve still not answered my question.Write me an email, please.But right now, Id really like to sleep.Can I stay?Do you want to stay?I cant hide the hope in my voice.You wanted me here.You havent answered my question.Ill write you an email, he mutters petulantly.Standing, he empties his jeans pockets of BlackBerry, keys, wallet, and money.Holy cow, men carry a lot of crap in their pockets.He strips off his watch, his shoes, socks, and jeans and places his jacket over my chair.He walks round to the other side of the bed and slides in.Lie down, he orders.I slip slowly under the covers, wincing slightly, staring at him.Jeez hes staying.I think Im numb with elated shock.He leans up on one elbow staring down at me.If you are going to cry.Cry in front of me.I need to know.Do you want me to cry?Not particularly.I just want to know how youre feeling.I dont want you slipping through my fingers.Switch the light off.Its late, and we both have to work tomorrow.So here and still so bossy, but I cant complain, hes in my bed.I dont quite understand why maybe I should weep more often in front of him.I switch off the bedside light.Lie on your side, facing away from me, he murmurs in the darkness.I roll my eyes in the full knowledge that he cannot see me, but I do as Im told.Gingerly, he moves over and puts his arms around me and pulls me to his chest  oh my.Sleep, baby, he whispers, and I feel his nose in my hair as he inhales deeply.Holy cow.Christian Grey is sleeping with me, and in the comfort and solace of his arms, I drift into a peaceful sleep.The candle flame is too hot.It flickers and dances in the over warm breeze, a breeze that brings no respite from the heat.Soft gossamer wings flutter to and fro in the dark, sprinkling dusty scales in the circle of light.Im struggling to resist, but Im drawn.And then its so bright, and I am flying too close to the sun, dazzled by the light, fried and melting from the heat, weary in my endeavors to stay airborne.I am so warm.The heat its stifling, overpowering.It wakes me.I open my eyes, and Im draped in Christian Grey.Hes wrapped around me like a victory flag.Hes fast asleep with his head on my chest, his arm over me, holding me close, one of his legs thrown over and hooked around both of mine.Hes suffocating me with his body heat, and hes heavy.I take a moment to absorb that hes still in my bed and fast asleep, and its light outside  morning.He has spent the whole night with me.My right arm is stretched, no doubt in search of a cool spot, and as I process the fact that hes still with me, the thought occurs that I can touch him.Hes asleep.Tentatively, I lift my hand and run the tips of my fingers down his back.Deep in his throat, I hear a faint distressed groan, and he stirs.He nuzzles my chest, inhaling deeply as he wakes.Sleepy, blinking gray eyes meet mine beneath his tousled mop of hair.Good morning, he mumbles and frowns.Jesus, even in my sleep Im drawn to you.He moves slowly, unpeeling his limbs from me as he gets his bearings.I become      aware of his erection against my hip.He notices my wide eyed reaction, and he smiles a slow sexy smile.Hmm this has possibilities, but I think we should wait until Sunday.He leans down and nuzzles my ear with his nose.I flush, but then I feel seven shades of scarlet from his heat.Youre very hot, I murmur.Youre not so bad yourself, he murmurs and presses himself against me, suggestively.I flush some more.Thats not what I meant.He props himself up on his elbow gazing down at me, amused.He bends, and to my surprise, plants a gentle kiss on my lips.Sleep well?he asks.I nod, staring up at him, and I realize that Ive slept very well except maybe for the last half hour when I was too hot.So did I.  He frowns.Yes, really well.He raises his eyebrows in confused surprise.Whats the time?I glance at my alarm.Its 7:30.7:30 shit.He scrambles out of bed and drags on his jeans.It is my turn to look amused as I sit up.Christian Grey is late and flustered.This is something I have never seen before.I belatedly realize that my behind is no longer sore.You are such a bad influence on me.I have a meeting.I have to go  I have to be in Portland at eight.Are you smirking at me?Yes.He grins.Im late.I dont do late.Another first, Miss Steele.He pulls on his jacket and then bends down and grasps my head, his hands on either side.Sunday, he says, and the word is pregnant with an unspoken promise.Everything deep in my body uncurls and then clenches in delicious anticipation, the feeling is exquisite.Holy hell, if my mind could just keep up with my body.He leans forward and kisses me quickly.He grabs his stuff from my side table and his shoes  which he doesnt put on.Taylor will come and sort your Beetle.I was serious.Dont drive it.Ill see you at my place on Sunday.Ill email you a time.And like a whirlwind, hes gone .Oh my, Christian Grey spent the night with me, and I feel rested.And there was no sex, only cuddling.He told me he never slept with anyone  but hes slept three times with me.I grin and slowly climb out of my bed.I feel more optimistic than I have for the last day or so.I head for the kitchen, needing a cup of tea.After breakfast, I shower and dress quickly for my last day at Claytons.It is the end of an era  goodbye to Mr.& Mrs.Clayton, WSU, Vancouver, the apartment, my Beetle.I glance at the mean machine  its only 7:52.I have time.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Assault and Battery: The after effects Date: May 27 2011 08:05      To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grey  You wanted to know why I felt confused after you  which euphemism should we apply   spanked, punished, beat, assaulted me.Well during the whole alarming process I felt demeaned, debased and abused.And much to my mortification, youre right, I was aroused, and that was unexpected.As you are well aware, all things sexual are new to me  I only wish I was more experienced and therefore more prepared.I was shocked to feel aroused.What really worried me was how I felt afterwards.And thats more difficult to articulate.I was happy that you were happy.I felt relieved that it wasnt as painful as I thought it would be.And when I was lying in your arms, I felt  sated.But I feel very uncomfortable, guilty even, feeling that way.It doesnt sit well with me, and Im confused as a result.Does that answer your question?I hope the world of Mergers and Acquisitions is as stimulating as ever and that you werent too late.Thank you for staying with me.Ana  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Free Your Mind  Date: May 27 2011 08:24  To: Anastasia Steele  Interesting if slightly overstated title heading Miss Steele.To answer your points:   Ill go with spanking  as thats what it was.So you felt demeaned, debased, abused & assaulted  how very Tess Durbeyfield of you.I believe it was you who decided on the debasement if I remember correctly.Do you really feel like this or do you think you ought to feel like this?Two very different things.If that is how you feel, do you think you could just try and embrace these feelings, deal with them, for me?Thats what a submissive would do.I am grateful for your inexperience.I value it, and Im only beginning to understand what it means.Simply put it means that you are mine in every way.Yes, you were aroused, which in turn was very arousing, theres nothing wrong with that.Happy does not even begin to cover how I felt.Ecstatic joy comes close.Punishment spanking hurts far more than sensual spanking  so thats about as hard as it gets, unless of course you commit some major transgression, in which case Ill use some implement to punish you with.My hand was very sore.But I like that.I felt sated too   more so than you could ever know.Dont waste your energy on guilt, feelings of wrongdoing etc.We are consent ing adults and what we do behind closed doors is between ourselves.You need to free your mind and listen to your body.The world of M&A is not nearly as stimulating as you are Miss Steele.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Holy crap mine in every way.My breath hitches.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Consenting Adults!Date: May 27 2011 08:26  To: Christian Grey  Arent you in a meeting?Im very glad your hand was sore.And if I listened to my body, Id be in Alaska by now.Ana  PS: I will think about embracing these feelings.From: Christian Grey  Subject: You Didnt Call the Cops  Date: May 27 2011 08:35  To: Anastasia Steele  Miss Steele  I am in a meeting discussing the futures market if youre really interested.For the record   you stood beside me knowing what I was going to do.You didnt at any time ask me to stop  you didnt use either safe word.You are an adult  you have choices.Quite frankly, Im looking forward to the next time my palm is ringing with pain.Youre obviously not listening to the right part of your body.Alaska is very cold and no place to run.I would find you.I can track your cell phone  remember?Go to work.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.I scowl at the screen.Hes right of course.Its my choice.Hmm.Is he serious about coming to find me, should I decide to escape for a while?My mind flits briefly to my mothers offer.I hit reply.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Stalker  Date: May 27 2011 08:36  To: Christian Grey  Have you sought therapy for your stalker tendencies?Ana      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Stalker?Me?Date: May 27 2011 08:38  To: Anastasia Steele  I pay the eminent Dr.Flynn a small fortune with regard to my stalker and other tendencies.Go to work.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Expensive Charlatans  Date: May 27 2011 08:40  To: Christian Grey  May I humbly suggest you seek a second opinion?I am not sure that Dr.Flynn is very effective.Miss Steele  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Second Opinions  Date: May 27 2011 08:43  To: Anastasia Steele  Not that its any of your business, humble or otherwise, but Dr.Flynn is the second opinion.You will have to speed, in your new car, putting yourself at unnecessary risk  I think thats against the rules.GO TO WORK.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: SHOUTY CAPITALS  Date: May 27 2011 08:47  To: Christian Grey  As the object of your stalker tendencies  I think it is my business actually.I havent signed yet.So rules schmules.And I dont start until 9:30.Miss Steele  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Descriptive Linguistics  Date: May 27 2011 08:49      To: Anastasia Steele  Schmules?Not sure where that appears in Websters Dictionary Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Descriptive Linguistics  Date: May 27 2011 08:52  To: Christian Grey  Its between control freak and stalker.And descriptive linguistics is a hard limit for me.Will you stop bothering me now?Id like to go to work in my new car.Ana  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Challenging but amusing Young Women  Date: May 27 2011 08:56  To: Anastasia Steele  My palm is twitching.Drive safely Miss Steele.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.The Audi is a joy to drive.It has power steering.Wanda, my Beetle, has no power in it at all  anywhere, so my daily workout, which was driving my Beetle, will cease.Oh, but I will have a personal trainer to contend with, according to Christians rules.I frown.I hate exercising.While I am driving, I try and analyze our email exchange.Hes a patronizing son of a bitch sometimes.And then I think of Grace and I feel guilty.But of course, she wasnt his birth mother.Hmm thats a whole world of unknown pain.Well, patronizing son of a bitch works well then.Yes.Im an adult, thank you for reminding me, Christian Grey, and it is my choice.The problem is, I just want Christian, not all his baggage  and right now he has a 747 holds worth of baggage.Could I just lie back and embrace it?Like a submissive?Ive said Id try.Its an awfully big ask.I pull into the parking lot at Claytons.As I make my way in, I can hardly believe its my last day.Fortunately, the store is busy and time passes quickly.At lunchtime, Mr.Clayton summons me from the stockroom.Hes standing beside a motorcycle courier.Miss Steele?the courier asks.I frown questioningly at Mr.Clayton, who shrugs, as puzzled as me.My heart sinks.What has Christian sent me now?I sign for the small package and open it straight away.Its a BlackBerry.My heart sinks further.I switch it on.From: Christian Grey  Subject: BlackBerry ON LOAN  Date: May 27 2011 11:15  To: Anastasia Steele  I need to be able to contact you at all times, and since this is your most honest form of communication, I figured you needed a BlackBerry.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Consumerism Gone Mad  Date: May 27 2011 13:22  To: Christian Grey  I think you need to call Dr.Flynn right now.Your stalker tendencies are running wild.I am at work.I will email you when I get home.Thank you for yet another gadget.I wasnt wrong when I said you were the ultimate consumer.Why do you do this?Ana  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Sagacity from one so young  Date: May 27 2011 13:24  To: Anastasia Steele  Fair point well made, as ever Miss Steele.Dr.Flynn is on vacation.And I do this because I can.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.I put the thing in my back pocket, hating it already.Emailing Christian is addictive, but I am supposed to be working.It buzzes once against my behind how apt, I think ironically, but summoning all my willpower, I ignore it.At four, Mr.and Mrs.Clayton gather all the other employees in the shop, and during a hair curlingly embarrassing speech, present me with a check for three hundred dollars.In that moment, three weeks of  exams, graduation, intense, fucked up billionaires, de       flowering, hard & soft limits, playrooms with no consoles, helicopter rides  and the fact that I will move tomorrow, all well up inside me.Amazingly, I hold myself together.My subconscious is in awe.I hug the Claytons hard.They have been kind and generous em ployers, and I will miss them.Kate is climbing out of her car when I arrive home.Whats that?she says accusingly, pointing at the Audi.I cant resist.Its a car, I quip.She narrows her eyes, and for a brief moment, I wonder if shes going to put me across her knee too.My graduation present.I try and act nonchalant.Yes, I get expensive cars given to me everyday.Her mouth drops open.Generous, over the top bastard, isnt he?I nod.I did try not to accept it, but frankly, its just not worth the fight.Kate purses her lips.No wonder youre so overwhelmed.I did note that he stayed.Yeah.I smile wistfully.Shall we finish packing?I nod and follow her inside.I check the email from Christian.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Sunday  Date: May 27 2011 13:40  To: Anastasia Steele  Shall I see you at 1 p. m.  Sunday?The doctor will be at Escala to see you at 1:30.Im leaving for Seattle now.I hope your move goes well, and I look forward to Sunday.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Jeez, he could be discussing the weather.I decide to email him once weve finished packing, he can be such fun one minute, and then he can be so formal and stuffy.Its difficult to keep up.Honestly, its like an email to an employee.I roll my eyes at it defiantly and join Kate to pack.Kate and I are in the kitchen when theres a knock at the door.Taylor stands on the porch, looking immaculate in his suit.I notice the trace of ex army in his buzz cut, trim physique, and his cool stare.Miss Steele, he says.Ive come for your car.Oh yes, of course.Come in, Ill fetch the keys.Surely this is above and beyond the call of duty.I wonder again at Taylors job description.I hand him the keys, and we walk in an uncomfortable silence for me   toward the light blue Beetle.I open the door and remove the flashlight from the glove box.Thats it.I have nothing else thats personal in the Wanda.Goodby,, Wanda.Thank you.I caress her roof as I close the passenger door.How long have you worked for Mr.Grey?I ask.Four years, Miss Steele.
