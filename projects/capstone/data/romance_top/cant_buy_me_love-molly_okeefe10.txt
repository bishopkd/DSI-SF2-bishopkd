Tara?He shook his head.Youd better stay inside.Call the police.The front lawn was washed in moonlight, creating a gray, flat landscape.The shadows were so thick past the gleaming bumpers of the cars that it took a second to see Tara Jeans pale face, silvered in tears.His heart hammered in quick relief.Well, look whos here, Tara, Dennis said, all bonhomie.His arm slung over her shoulder like they were two drunks out on the town.But the gun in his hand stood out, a black nightmare against the pale skin of Taras throat, the white gauze of her sweater.The very man we wanted to see.But that shotgun has got to go, Luc.His hands flexed on the barrel, but when Dennis held the gun to Taras head he slid it to the ground, not wanting to antagonize the man.Police would be here in twenty minutes, if they ignored the speed limit.Twenty minutes.A period of NHL hockey.The world stopped turning; birds were silent and the breeze was still.His heart slowed to a calm rhythm and the world receded to this moment.This spot on the earth.That gun and the woman he loved.What do you want?Not so nice, is it, Ice Man, having someone spy on you?Having someone show up outside your house demanding things, like theyve got the right.Im sorry I had you followed Not as sorry as your sister was.Or youre going to be.Cold hands squeezed his guts.He could barely look at Tara without seeing the mistakes shed warned him not to make.Its on you if this blows up in your face, thats what shed said.And she had been so right.Justtell me what you want.What do you think I want?Dennis asked.I want some fucking money.Fine No!Tara cried, and Dennis shoved her hard to the ground and she skidded across the gravel.Luc lurched off the porch toward her.Luc!No!Immediately, he realized his mistakehed left the door open and Dennis, always a man with an eye on an upgrade, had climbed up the steps of the porch kicking the shotgun into the bushes.Ill get you money, Luc said, crouching over Tara but keeping his eyes on Dennis.Right now.JustI need to go inside.Run down the clock, that was all he had to do.Run down the clock.Call someone else, Dennis said, pointing the gun with terrible intent toward Taras head.You can wait out here with us Uncle Luc?For a moment, the world rushed back into place as his nephew stood in the doorway in his SpongeBob Square Pants pajamas, rubbing his eyes, his curls waving in the breeze.Jacob!Luc yelled but it was too lateDennis grabbed the boy, holding the gun to his temple.I think the boy makes a much better bartering chip than you, sweetheart, Dennis said, sneering at Tara.In fact, I want money and whatever jewelry is inside that house.Now.Fine, Luc said, holding out his hands, edging toward the porch.Ill go Not you.Dennis shook his head and leaned down to whisper in Jacobs ear.Call for your mommy.Jacobs scared rabbit eyes turned to Luc, who could only nod and clench his fists.His plan to stall burned to a crisp in his anger.Now he just wanted to kill Dennis.Beat him into a pulp for scaring Jacob.Mommy!Jacobs trembling voice pierced the night, accompanied by Taras guttural moan.In a heartbeat Victoria was in the doorway, panting and terrified.Jacob!she cried, lurching toward him until she saw the gun in Denniss hands.She stopped on a dime and Luc got a hard look at the bruising on her face, he hadnt seen it before this moment, and he wanted to scream at his ineffectiveness.For a man who prided himself on taking care of everyone he loved, hed been doing a shit job of it.Well, hello there, Dennis said to Victoria.You look like you ran into quite a door.In Denniss arms Jacob started to wheeze, his small chest heaving.He needs his inhaler!Victoria cried, holding her fingers to her lips.Dennis, whatever you want, you can have.But let him go.Please, he has asthma.Well, Dennis said.You better hurry.Hurry?She shook, her eyes locked on her son, shock making a mess of her.Vicks, Luc said, trying to pull her attention away from the dark barrel of that gun pressed to Jacobs head.Go inside, get the money from Dads desk.My bedroom dresser.And get the jewelry from Celestes room.Ill go, Tara said, stepping forward, but Dennis pulled the boy up the stairs, getting in her way.Sit down, Dennis told Tara.Like a good dog.This situation was fraying at every corner, pulling at every seam, and Luc had to fix this.Control it.Go, he said to his sister, reaching up to her arm, nudging her into action.His touch seemed to snap her forward and she ducked back into the dark doorway.Listen to your brother, Victoria, Dennis said.The minute I hear sirens Im leaving, with the money or the kid.Dennis, Tara said, stepping up the steps toward him.The smile on her face was the bravest thing Luc had ever seen.Lets just go.The cops are coming.Well start over someplace new.Florida.Imagine those rich old men in the retirement homes down there!Well make more there than we can here.Tara, Luc breathed, broken at her efforts to protect them.Dont do this But Dennis talked over him and he wasnt sure if Tara was even listening to him.Right.Like Im going to trust you again.You can, Dennis.I swear.I made a mistake.ButI want to do this.Lets just go.I cant just go.I need this money to get out of a little jam.Jacob wheezed in Denniss arms.Okay, Dennis.She reached a trembling hand for Denniss shoulder, like she was touching a lover, and Luc felt like dying watching her sacrifice herself.But please, let Jacob have his inhaler.Please.Theres one in the truck.Its sweet how attached she is to the kid, isnt it?Dennis asked, as if Tara Jean werent there, and Luc got an ugly view of what her life must have been like with this asshole.I mean, Im surprised as hell.She hates kids.Jacobs lips were turning blue.Screw you, Dennis, Tara snapped, and she ran toward the truck.Tara, stop!Luc cried, knowing it was just the kind of thing to make Dennis lose it.Dennis fired the gun, and gravel and dust exploded four feet in front of Tara.Lucs heart stopped.Tara froze.The gunshot echoed, filling the silence for miles.Eli, he thought, come on, Eli.He had to have heard that.You move, Dennis sneered, when I say you can move.He waited a second, a sick smile crossing his face.Go ahead.She ran to the car and grabbed the inhaler and then raced back to Jacob, helping him with the puffer.Luc stepped forward to help, to get closer, within arms distance to that weak little man and his gun.Un uh, Dennis sang.Stay back there, Ice Man.Luc stopped, chewing his tongue, feeling blocked in at every step.Jacob caught his breath, the color returning to his cheeks.Its going to be okay, Tara whispered, and Dennis shoved her backward.She nearly tripped and fell down the porch steps, but Luc grabbed her.Holy shit, Dennis!Luc yelled, pulling Tara back, while frustration chewed through his control.Were doing everything you want.Just relax!When Ive got the money, Dennis said, all his bonhomie gone, the wide eyed smiling act vanishing.Hurry up!he yelled over his shoulder.A rifle blast split the night and Luc dove, covering Tara Jean with his body.Eli.About goddamned time.Dennis flinched and Jacob, the clever boy, managed to slip away.Dennis grabbed onto the hem of the boys shirt, holding him in place, while Jacob strained against the fabric, SpongeBob stretching across his belly.Let the boy go.Eli stepped out of the shadows, holding the twelve gauge, and Luc was relieved that just one thing had gone right tonight.Not on your life.Eli fired into the porch right between Denniss legs and the boy shrieked, the shirt tore, and he ran into the house.Who the fuck are you?Dennis asked, pointing the gun at Eli.You okay?Luc whispered to Tara, who nodded against his arm.There were a thousand things he wanted to say to Tara, but they would have to wait.You the asshole that hit a woman?Eli asked and Dennis shook his head, his face going red.I said who the fuck are you?he yelled, spittle flying into the night.The moment was slipping out of Denniss hands and Luc carefully slid from Tara, easing low and slow across the ground.Hold it right there, Ice Man, Dennis warned, training the gun on him.Luc froze.But then, as if theyd planned it, Eli moved, stepping toward the porch, and Dennis turned to face him.Luc sprang off the ground, flying up the stairs, tackling Dennis and bringing him down.The gun fired, something hot brushed past his arm, setting his skin on fire, but then Eli was there, kicking the gun away, and Luc used his good arm to wrap his hand around Denniss throat.He leaned a little weight into his wrist and watched Denniss eyes bug.You touched the people I love and I will see you rot in jail for as long as it is legally allowed, and then when youre out, I will find you.And I will hurt you so bad, youll pray to God to be back in jail Luc.Eli touched his shoulder and Luc sat up.Eli tipped his head toward the door where his nephew, sister, and mother all stood watching him with round eyes and white knuckles.Keep him down, Luc told Eli and Eli nodded, holding the barrel of the shotgun against Denniss nose.Not so funny anymore, are you?Luc asked.Screw you, Dennis said, and Luc stepped on the mans bellydelighting in his grunt of painto get to his family, pulling them all into his arms.And they pulled him into theirs.Money and boxes of jewelry fell from Celeste and Victorias hands as they clutched at him.Family.You, he said, crouching to look into his nephews eyes, are one tough kid.I dont feel tough, he said, and shook his inhaler before taking another puff.I feel scared.Me too, Luc admitted.But you got away from him.And you knocked him down, Jacob said.But I brought him here, he thought, light headed with grief and guilt.Youve been shot, Celeste said.He looked down at the bloody crease in his arm, the raw skin.Sirens got louder and the lights sliced through the night as the cars turned down the long driveway.Tara Jean stumbled to her feet, her face as pale as her sweater.This wasnt your fault, Luc, she said.Hiring that P. I.  didnt make any difference.You dont know that.He was going to try and rob you no matter what.Youre just too rich for an idiot like Dennis to pass up.You were going to go with him?he asked.Back to conning old men in nursing homes?Dont be ridiculous, I had to get him away from here.It was the only thing I could think of.He could think of a thousand other things, like trusting him.Like trusting the cops.But Tara Jean didnt trust in anything, so he swallowed his words.The yard erupted and Luc had to step forward to deal with the police, and he felt Tara Jean melting away from him.Easing into the shadows, perhaps to run, maybe just to hide.He didnt know which.But he wasnt going to let her go.Maman?he called, and Celeste stepped off the porch, regal in her purple silk robe, just as if thered never been a terrible hostage situation on her front lawn.Look after Tara Jean, would you?Celeste approached Tara like one would a wounded animal, carefully, murmuring soft things in French that there was no way Tara would understand, but she responded.Ducking her head, her shoulders shook, and Celeste wrapped her up in her arms and led her into the house.30 Dawn broke over the mountains, bloodying the sky.Tara watched it from the kitchen window.All the statements had been taken; Dennis had been locked up in the squad car, spitting and kicking at the window.Jacob, Celeste, and Victoria had all gone back to bed.Ruby made a pot of coffee and then, as if she didnt know what else to do, took out eggs to start breakfast.Go back to bed, Ruby, Tara said.No one wants to eat.Are you sure?she asked, coming to touch Tara Jeans hair, sweeping it back away from her face, all but clucking like a hen.Tara was just too tired to resist the mothering.You should eat.Tara Jean shook her head and then took Rubys hand and kissed it, surprising both of them.But the touch.The contact.It felt good.Thank you for calling the police.Oh, sweetie, Ruby said, pulling Tara into her arms.Tara Jean soaked it up, parched to the bone.Are you going to stay?she asked, her breath whispering across Taras hair.This is my home, isnt it?Tara tried to make it a joke, but it wasnt.And Ruby knew it.Always, she said.Always.Always.Another pat.A kiss.A squeeze.Honestly, Tara hadnt been touched so much by the woman in the four years shed lived here.Ill go and see if I can get some sleep, Ruby said, and then she was gone.And it was just she and the dawn, waiting for Luc.During that drive back out to the ranch with Denniswith that gun, and the reality of what he was going to try to do with it, she had realized how weak she was.Because if she could have gone back in time and not pushed Luc out the door, she would have done it.In a heartbeat.Not to save herself or the Bakers from whatever nightmare Dennis had planned, but because the ugliness of her life, the wretchedness of her past and her decisions, terrified her.She had thought she was so tough pushing Luc out that door, putting on this ridiculous outfit that hung in tatters around her battered body.But shed just been a fool, rejecting love for pain.Who the hell cared if she didnt deserve Luc?Luc didnt, so why should she?If he wanted to tie himself to a monster, she should be delighted to let him.She should tie the damn knot.He came in the front door, his chest streaked with blood and dirt, a white bandage across his arm.Her hands useless, always so useless, flinched in her lap.In the doorway, he paused at the sight of her.She felt small in her skin.As if shed been put in a bag and shaken so hard pieces of her had fallen off, crumbled and broken, and she couldnt quite tell what was left of her.You all right?he asked, still so far away.Still watching her.The shaking started again, and she wanted to clutch herself, gathering uplike laundrywhat remained of who she was.Tara?Im fine, she said, pleased her voice was still part of what she had.How are you?She pointed, uselessly.Your arm.Flesh wound.His laugh was brief and surprising; she felt herself start at the sound of it.Eli called me a pussy when I asked for painkillers.Amazingly, she smiled and then, suddenly, she was laughing, the sound torn from her gut, and she couldnt stop.She pressed her fingers to her lips, knowing she sounded hysterical, and then she was crying.The tears hot and blinding and Luc was beside her, his strong arms around her.And suddenly, she didnt need to hold onto herself because he was doing it.Everythings okay, he whispered into her hair.Everyones all right.Dennis is gone and will be gone for a long, long time.She nodded, trying to beat back the storm of her madness.Pulling away, she wiped her eyes with her scraped hands.He touched her knees, the tiny tears in her leather pants.You were right, he said.Having him followed blew up in my face.I just wanted to take care of my family.Of you.Responsibility settled around his shoulders in a way she could see, weighing him down, suffocating him.She prayed she wasnt too late, that she hadnt killed everything he felt for her.Maybe someone needs to take care of you.He blinked at her and she held her breath, waiting for her courage to be rewarded.Waiting for him to sweep her up in his arms, to rain a thousand kisses on her face, to promise a future so bright shed forget about her past.Youre going to stay?Ifif youll have me.Its your home.This was not the reaction she expected and she reeled for a moment, realizing he must have changed his mind about her.You said you loved me, she whispered, not above using guilt.See, she was a total monster.His smile was so sad.I do.Youre not acting like it.How do I prove it, Tara?How do I prove it so that youll believe me?Not just for right now.But forever.His hand twitched as if he were going to reach for her but then he dropped his arms at his sides, his fingers curved over his knees as if keeping himself there.They both stared at his hands, as if they would point the way to safety.To home.She opened her mouth to tell him she did believe him, but no words came out.She tried to force it, to make herself believe, but she didnt know where belief lived.How to manufacture it.Was it in her brain?Could she convince herself?Was it in her heart?Could she dream it, wish it into being?But inside, she was a wasteland, a frozen desert thick with mistakes and betrayals.And in the end, under the heat of his gaze, in the face of his love and faith, she couldnt do it.She didnt believe him.In front of her eyes, she watched him break.Watched the belief in him turn to doubt.I would stay here, he whispered, looking around the kitchen.I would run this ranch that Ive hated my whole life.I would make this my home.For you.And it wouldnt be enough, would it?She stared at her hands; those fists knew what to do even when she didnt know what she was fighting.But there was no fight in her anymore; she was so beaten she could barely sit upright.Im broken, Luc.I am.Deep down.Youre right, you deserve more than I can give you.More than But then he kissed her, sweetly, tenderly, and she sighed into his lips.Hope a match strike against her chest.Her hands reached for him but he pulled away, violently, his eyes burning into hers.I love you, Tara.But the problem is you dont even like yourself.You dont even see the woman you are and until you do, I dont have a chance of convincing you.And I would stay here and I would fight every day and I would try to fix you.Try to make you see yourself the way I see you.Because thats what I do, Tara.Thatsthats what I do.And it wouldnt work.It never has worked.Not with my sister.My mother.Fuck, look what happened tonight He swallowed hard, blinking up at the ceiling until he turned to her, burning with sudden purpose that made her lean back, made her try to stand up, but he stopped her, his hands holding her in place.Tara.Listen to me, because this is the truth.My truth.When you are ready, I will be waiting for you.Your life will be waiting for you.He kissed her again, a hard seal, as if she were a letter he was marking as his, and then he stood and braced himself for a second against the table, like a man in rocky seas.She waited, after he left, in a shaft of sunlight that grew and spread like a leak, unstoppable.Until she realized she was blinded by the sunlightand numb to its warmth.Victoria lay in bed next to Jacob, feeling the rise and fall of his little rib cage against her stomach.His hand was curled into hers, and his feet rested flat against the tops of her own.His lips parted on each breath, a little snore in his nose every time he inhaled, and the sound was so sweet, so alive, it brought a smile to her lips.Which cracked and then bled into her mouth.Carefully, she pressed the bloody Kleenex to her lip as she had all night long.There was a soft knock on her door, and even that had the power to send her heart screaming into her throat.Celeste opened the door, wincing when she saw Jacob sleeping.Luc has asked for all of us to meet in the den, she whispered.Victoria twisted, trying not to disturb Jacob to look at the clock.So early?Hes got a flight out of Dallas at noon.What?Celeste shrugged and left the door open as she walked down the hallway.Victoria eased out of bed and nearly ran to the den, wondering what had happened in last nights nightmare to make him leave the ranch.Leave Tara.There was no glee in Victoria.No victory.Particularly when she got a good look at Lucs hard face as he sat behind her fathers desk, looking oddly as though he fit there.Whats going on?Victoria asked.Good, youre here, he said on a big sigh, his arm in a sling at his side.I have a flight at noon back to Toronto, so I just want to tell everyone whats happening.Victoria glanced around and saw Eli and Celeste, and Ruby.Wheres Tara?Luc stared at his hands for a second.Im not sure, he said.Is she staying at the ranch?II dont know, Vicks.Please, let me just get this stuff taken care of so I can leave.The naked appeal in his eyes, in his voice, stilled her tongue.And she dropped like a rock onto the couch next to Celeste.Im not totally sure if Im breaking the rules of the will, since my off season is now indefinite and Im leaving before my five months are up.Vicks, I dont think youre going to get that million.She held up her hand.Its okay.It is.I dont need it.What are you going to do?She shrugged, not sure, but wanting to put on a brave face for her brothers sake.Ill get a job.Thatsgood, Vicks.Eli He looked up at the cowboy, who stood in the back of the room.The ranch is in escrow and I leave it in your hands to run it until the year is up and then you can buy the ranch, but I want your promise that my sister and Tara Youre selling the ranch?Victoria asked.Luc nodded.The house too?Victoria, its just easier What if I want it?she asked, and felt everyone staring at her.Their collective gazes, particularly Elis from behind her, were heavy and she couldnt quite think past the weight.Want what?Luc looked as baffled as if shed asked for Santa Claus to come to the ranch and give her a pony.The ranch.The house The whole thing.She pushed the weight of everyones flabbergasted shock, everyones skepticism, away.For the first time in her life she acted on her own impulse.Her own gut.Youve got to be kidding me, Eli said.Luc Luc held up his hand and Eli crumpled his hat in his fist.What are you going to do with the ranch?Luc asked, and Victoria felt as if she were lifted above her body, floating, watching herself do this.Watching her take charge of her life.This woman with the lightning in her eyes, the purpose in the muscles of her body, the smile broken on one side by a mans fist.That woman was her.I dont know.Horses?she said.Like we used to.What do you know about horses?Eli demanded.Not much.She looked at him, feeling challenge and entreaty fill her eyes.But you do.Elis chest heaved and it looked like he was chewing on a whole bunch of words, probably none of them nice.His eyes raked her, and she could tell the poor man was not comfortable hating a woman as much as he hated her right now.Luc Eli said, and then stopped as if he knew what Luc was going to say.Vicks, the ranch is yours to run for the year.After that if you want it, its yours.You want to sell it to Eli, thats fine too.Im sorry, Eli.Luc smiled slightly at Victoria, as if giving her his blessing, as if he was happy to be doing it.But family comes first.It always has with you people, Eli growled and left the room.Sitting ramrod straight, eyes on Luc while he talked about Tara Jean and the greenhouse, Celeste reached over and patted Victorias hand.Victoria, feeling as if she were filled in equal parts with helium and lead, grabbed onto that hand like a lifeline.31 Tara Jean sat in Lyles old room, watching the rain make tracks across the window, distorting the wet world outside.She wished she drank.A little alcohol, a blistering hangover, something to distract her from the throbbing numbness.Something to fill the vacuum Lucs departure had created in her chest.But even candy, her sweet comfort, had lost its appeal.So for three days straight she had done little but lie in a fetal position in Lyles blue robe, staring out the window and wondering who the hell she was.Tara Jean flopped over onto her back just as the door to the room opened and Celeste walked in.Rayanne hadnt been much for stern lectures, she had been more of a begging for forgiveness kind of mother, so it wasnt as if Tara had a lot of experience with tough love.But Celeste looked like a mother ready to dish some out.Are you finished feeling sorry for yourself?No.Tara stared up at the ceiling, the stucco painted light blue.That had been her idea.Give Lyle a little sky.Well youve got a business to run, or have you forgotten?Tara shook her head, rolling it across the plastic mattress.The crinkle sounded distinctly hospital like.When they first got this bed, shed covered the mattress in those foamy egg carton things.She imagined it had made Lyle feel less like everyone thought he was going to wet the bed.Ill just mess it up, she said.Ask Claire Hughes, shell tell you.I have no business trying to run a company.Since when did you care what people think about you?Honestly, Tara, thats one of your few redeeming qualities.Dont give it up now.She laughed, a tired huff of a laugh that made her bones ache with even that small effort.Thats not true, she said.And you know it.That you dont care what people think of you?Celeste shut the door behind her and perched on the edge of the bed.The weight made Taras legs slide toward the other woman and just as she mustered up the energy to move herself, Celeste awkwardly patted her leg.I thinkI think thats all Ive ever cared about, Tara said, looking hard at all her weaknesses.Ive let what people think of me dictate every single thing Ive ever done.It made me throw away the Nordstrom deal.It made me push She shook her head, too tired to enumerate her sins.Too broken to talk about Luc.Youve run that business for a while now.And before that you turned it around, made it count for something again.And I, for one, am proud of you.My son is Tara rolled off the bed, stared at her bare toes and the carpet beneath them.Lets not talk about him.Then lets concentrate on getting you out of this bed and back in your workshop.I dont like leather anymore, she said.What do you like?I dont know.Then maybe its time to find out.For two days she made sketches of sex toys, mostly to watch Celeste roll her eyes.Needling Celeste had become her reason to get out of bed most days.That and Jacob, who sat beside her at her bench, drawing cowboys and robots and suns with big smiley faces on them.Why are you even here?Tara said, after Celeste tossed the whips and chains collection in the trash.Your flesh and blood has left, or did you miss that?Celeste arched an imperial eyebrow, standing at the door of the workshop.Doesnt mean Im not needed.Now, stop being cute and do some work.Tara Jean stared down at the paper in front of her.But Im not a designer.Not really.Who cares?Celeste asked, and Tara Jean Sweet blinked in stunned silence.Who cares?It was like one of those summer rains pouring through her, clearing away the humidity and confusion, the itchy anger at herself, leaving behind fresh air and glittering purpose.Who cares, indeed.I care was the only answer that mattered.Dressed in a white T shirt and blue jeans, Tara Jean opened up the filing cabinet and took out her binders.Tearing out with delirious and happy abandon the thongs and bustiers.What are you doing?Jacob asked.Getting rid of the prostitute line.Whats a prostitute?She smiled, feeling devilish, which for her was an improvement.Go ask your mom.Part of her, she realized, was this leather, these designs.She couldnt get rid of all of them andfaced with the choiceshe didnt want to.She was proud of some of this work.She left the pants, but only in black.Most of the jackets stayed.All of the bags.The shirt with the heart cutouts on the collar gave her an idea, and she riffled through the torn pages to the clean white paper underneath.Little red boots, with hearts and silver stitching for a young girl.A matching quarter length jacket.A set of barrettes.A pair of black motorcycle boots in miniature for a young boy.A yoga bag.Tasteful items.Useful.She became obsessed with useful.With wallets and eyeglass holders.A diaper bag.A bunch of them.In amazing colors with pouches and pockets.Briefcases, sleek and stylish, but in lime green.She made a note to herself to look up other fabrics.Water resistant.Environmentally friendly.She laughed, thinking of Lyle rolling over in his grave.At the thought of Lyle she paused.Sat down hard in her chair.Her mind was free of the past, her mothers voice silenced for good, and it was slightly dizzying, like having a set of blinders taken off, but the viewthe view was just so good without the past.Useful.Maybemaybe it was time to become useful again.She ran back into the house to shower and find a phone book.The next day Tara stood on the porch, an address in her hand, an appointment set in stone.She wore a sleeveless black button down shirt and pair of khaki walking shorts.The problem was, she had no shoes.Nothing that wasnt ten inches high or plush and shaped like a rabbit.Tara?It was Victoria, walking out onto the porch, her son beside her.She smiled down at the boy and felt a little taller, a little smarter and more worthy, when he beamed up at her.You okay?Victoria asked, and Tara Jean reluctantly pulled her attention to Jacobs stern faced motherwho, in the buttery yellow sunlight of a brand new day, was not so stern faced.She was almostpretty.Girlish, with her hair around her face, curling lightly in the humidity.Though she still wore a god awful shirt with a silk tie at the throat like she was eighty years old.Where are your shoes?Jacob asked, pointing to Tara Jeans bare feet.I She wiggled her toes, feeling stupid.She should just stay on the ranch.Design leather litter boxes or something.She shook her head, uprooting the thought as it emerged, tossing it aside.I am going to go into Springfield to the hospital to read some books and comics to some people there and II dont have any shoes to wear.She shrugged.I might just wear my slippers.I have some shoes you can wear, Victoria said.Im a size nine.Really?Good Lord, the woman had boat feet.Do you want the shoes?Victoria snapped.I do, Tara Jean said.Im a seven and a half; they should work okay.Victoria ran back inside and brought out a pair of red Chanel ballet slippers.Elegant, and as Tara Jean realized when she slipped them on, comfortable.She wiggled her toes in the inch of extra room.Will those work?Victoria asked and Tara Jean nodded, suddenly feeling choked up.Suddenly feeling grateful beyond words.They are just shoes, she told herself, but she couldnt help her tears.Can we come with you?Jacob asked, and Victoria turned to her son.You want to go to a hospital?Are there kids there?he asked.Because Ive got some Captain Underpants books I can bring them.And we could play checkers.Remember, Mom?When people would come in and do that with me?Tara Jean could feel Victorias pride like the heat from a stove and she took a step away before getting scorched.Victoria stroked her sons hair.Go and get them, she whispered and the boy took off like a shot, leaving the two of them alone.Hes a special boy, Tara Jean said to fill the silence.Thank you.My special boy asked me what a prostitute was yesterday.Any idea why?No clue.Tara Jean almost laughed, but then Victoria turned to her, eyeing her shrewdly.Youre hurting my brother, you know, Victoria said, and Tara Jean started down the steps, running from the conversation as if it were a hive of bees.Thanks for the shoes.Ill see you at the hospital Were more than our mistakes, Victoria said, and Tara Jean jerked at the words, as if they were bullets entering her chest.More than our past.We can be more than the things we let define us.What are you going to be?Tara Jean asked, feeling petulant and scared, naked and shivering in the sun.Because she wanted this to be true.In the darkest, loneliest part of her night, she prayed that this was true.She could be more than the trailer, her sixteenth birthday, Dennis, the old men she made victims when all they wanted was a friend.Victoria shrugged.No idea.And Im scared to death.But each morning I wake up excited.Happy.Happy.The word was a foreign treat and tasted like ginger and spices, cherries and everything delicious and real after a diet of everything false.If Luc made you happy, Tara, Victoria said, you should talk to him.See him.Heshes a little lost right now.I cant be a substitute for hockey.I mean when he realizes hes made a mistake grabbing onto me My brother is no dummy.Victoria was a tiny but staunch defender.And neither are you, and I would thinklord knows I would hopethat the chance to be happy, really happy, might outweigh the risks of being wrong.But you hate me.Youre growing on me.Tara Jean stood there wondering how in the world shed found such odd friends.When shed never had any.Im not that brave, Victoria.It took a long moment, but Victoria shrugged.Could have fooled me.Jacob raced back out of the house, carrying a stack of books and a book bag that slammed and banged against his bum as he ran.In some kind of fog, Tara Jean watched Victoria and Jacob climb into their car.Well see you at the hospital?Victoria asked, and numb, Tara Jean nodded.Could have fooled me.Tara Jean smiled, laughter bubbling out of her.The volcano with a changed purposeher fear turned to incredulous joy.Surprised glee.For the first time, in perhaps her whole life, she wasnt fooling anyone.Not anymore.The August press conference was dull.Even as the center of attention, Luc was bored out of his mind.The conference room at the Royal York was like a gray box.Gray walls, gray table.A sea of blah.The vipers were all well behaved.Even Addie looked bored.A month since leaving the ranch and this was his life now.He was supposed to be announcing his agreement to join the coaching staff for the Cavaliers.The brass had found a way to keep him around after all, just as Billy had predicted.He was going to be Lashenkos babysitter.No one believed him when he said he was a shitty babysitter.He leaned toward Beckett, who gleamed gold in all the gray.Luc would bet money the man dyed his hair to look like money.Dunbar, the general manager, prattled on about his hope that Luc would always have a home with the Cavaliers.Home, he thought.Thinking of Tara, her hair in the sunlight.The dust of Crooked Creek on her hot pink cowboy boots.His whole family had defected to Taras side and he was glad for it.Glad that she wasnt alone on that ranch with just her ghosts.But being glad didnt make him happy.It made him sour.I need a drink, he murmured in his agents ear.Beckett reeled back.Its ten a. m.  So?Come on, man, whatever strange trip youre on these days, lets just keep it together until the cameras go home.Im bored.Yeah?And Ive got ulcers with your name on them.Beckett turned to face him, his minted face reflecting all sorts of worry and pity.Do you want this?No.Well, too bad.Beckett surged to his feet.Its what youve got.He turned his sparkling visage to the lights and cameras and Luc sat back in his chair, trying not to scowl.Trying not to think of Tara Jeans skin on his.Her breath in his ear.The strawberry scent of her.In the back, there was a commotion behind the camera crew.A camera light swerved across the ceiling when a cameraman stepped forward, letting someone pass him against the wall at his back.Billy probably, he thought.His friend had called earlier to get the information about the press conference because he was in town getting his stuff set to move to Dallas.He sat up a little straighter, happy to see his friends miserable face.Billy would have a drink with him.But it wasnt Billys ruined face that cleared Addies shoulders to the left of the podium.It was Tara Jeans perfection.Her button nose, the wheat of her hair, the lush curve of her lips.Static buzzed in his ears, a vast sizzling expectation, an awed and hopeful wonder.Her eyes went wide at the scene in front of her and she stepped back as if to shrink into the wall, as if to leave, and he leapt to his feet.Beckett and every cameraman swiveled to face him.Luc?Becketts mouth smiled while his eyes shot daggers.You want to make your statement.Luc didnt say anything, he stared at Tara Jean, the hesitancy and hope in her beautiful blue eyes.Shes here, his heart pounded.Shes here, and her smile, the slow curve of it, promised him a home.He smiled back, feeling brand new.The boredom fell away, the ennui, the worry and anger.And he stood there, on fire with love.A flame of hope.Her shoulders shook with laughter and tears filled her eyes and he smiled harder.Burned brighter.Luc?Beckett said through his teeth.You want to talk about how glad you are to be staying in Toronto I dont think so, he said, and Tara Jean slowly shook her head.Nope.He turned to the crowd, Not staying.The room erupted and Tara Jean held her fingers up to her smiling lips, a gesture so sweet and girlish, joy and love blasted through him.Sorry, he said to Beckett.Im going to go get something better.He jumped off the dais, ignoring the questions, the flashbulbs, the mayhem he left in his wake.He got close to Tara Jean and she reached out a hand, clasping his in a grip so strong and true it was as if she clutched his heart.Shouldering past the boldest of the reporters, he made his way to the door.Ice Man!One voice cut through the cacophony, Addie, standing on a chair.Who is she?The Tara Jean he looked at was familiar but at the same time wholly different.She wore a gauzy loose blue blouse with a tank top beneath it, a pair of jeans, and sandals.Her hair lay in sleek lines down her back, straight and sophisticated.Im not sure, he said.They made it out to the hallway and Luc broke into a run, pulling Tara Jean behind him, turning corners, rounding bends, taking the stairs until finally, they got to the swimming pool.He used his key card to get them into the empty cavernous room, filled with humidity and the scent of chlorine.I dont think theyll find us here, Luc said, glancing through the windows before pulling a privacy shade over the door.In the humidity the tips of her hair curled, a small glimpse of the woman he knew in Texas.What are you doing here?He was suddenly at a loss for words, and he laughed at his embarrassment.I mean I have something I need to say, she told him and he stilled, ready to listen to whatever it was.Im sorry for turning you away.Im sorry for the problems I brought into your life Tara Let me finish.Im sorry for Dennis.And for being too scared to believe that you loved me.Im sorry for hurting you.Im sorry you got shot and that you lost your career.But she shook her head, Im not sorry for pretending to marry your father, because he brought you to me.Im not sorry for sleeping with you, because you made me feel good and beautiful after years of feeling ugly inside and out.Im not sorry Her voice broke and for a moment she looked down at her feet, her hair sweeping across her cheek in a curtain, hiding her from him.He itched to push that hair back, to look into her eyes, but this was her moment and the best thing he could do was let her fight through it herself.Im not sorry I love you, she said, shaking back her hair, lifting her eyes to his with fierce pride.Which no doubt will cause you plenty of problems in the future.Which Im not going to apologize for, either.I dont want your apologies, he told her.Sometimes it feels like thats all I have.He started to deny that, but she put her hand to his chest, stilling him.And Im working on that, she said and took a deep breath.Im working on me.For the first time in my life, Im working on me.Im glad.You deserve it.She nodded and chewed her lips.I thought I would wait, that I would come to you with maybe the Nordstrom deal, or a new line of items for the stores.But I realized if you had the courage to love me without hockey telling you what you were worth, I could come to you the same way.Determining my own worth.Im worth loving, Luc.And I want you to love me.Tears burned behind his eyes, and with a foot between them, filled with his pride in her, his respect for her, he let those tears fall, unchecked.I love you, Tara Jean Sweet.I love you, too, Ice Man.Thatsthats not me anymore.Idont know what Im going to do now.I dont think anyone is going to offer me a coaching job after that little stunt I pulled in the press conference.Did you want to coach?Not really.Well, youre in luck, Luc.I need a male model for a new line Im designing and you would be perfect for the job.Boots?Nope.He narrowed his eyes.Pants?Thongs.For men.Very uncomfortable.Well, as long as the pay is good.Oh, she slid into his arms as if shed never been gone, its very good.She howled with laughter and he joined her.The sound of their happiness echoed, endlessly, endlessly surrounding them, lifting them toward a future bright with promise.Can't Buy Me Love       To Maureen, Sinead, Stephanie, and Eileen.While I might be able to do this without you,it wouldnt be nearly as much fun.Can't Buy Me Love      Desperate to knowwhat happens next at Crooked Creek?Crazy for cowboys?You wont want to miss  the story of Victoriassecond chance at life and love.Read on for a sneak peek!Victoria Schulman was hugging his horse.If that wasnt enough to piss a man off, Eli Turnbull didnt know what was.That she was doing it in one of those fussy satin shirts only made it worse.The woman was tiny, a paisley covered speck against his horses wide black head.Eli had some inclination to worry about Victoriaabout her thinness, and the dark circles under her eyesbut he ignored it.And he felt bad bullying a woman who clearly needed not only a good meal but someone to take care of her.But every time he tried to be nicethinking about honey versus vinegar and all that shitsomething about her would just make him crazy.Like, right now, her shoes.They were red and they had bows.How in the world could she put on those shoes and say yeah, Ill be a rancher?Honestly, he wanted to be nice, but she was just so ridiculous.You need boots if youre going to be in here.His voice cut up the distance between them and she stepped away from his horse.Not very nice.Instead of flinching, she lifted her chin as if they were about to box.Hed give her points for foolish courage, but foolish courage never helped anyone.Iah She glanced down at the silly shoes on her feet.I suppose youre right.He stepped across the wide aisle between the tack room and the stall where he kept Patience, his mare.Victoria didnt back away.Her hands flexed into fists for a moment, but then she spread them wide and ran them down the edges of her skirt.Her efforts at control were totally ruined by her eyes.Their navy blue depths betrayed her interest.He felt her gaze travel across his chest, his arms.Felt it linger at the base of his throat where the sweat ran down his shirt.She tried to act nonchalant, she really did, but she failed.AhRuby said you were looking for me, she said.Its nine.I was looking for you at seven this morning.Okay, that wasnt nice either, but he couldnt resist pointing out how terribly unsuited she was for this place.For this job shed taken on.I have a son, Eli.I cant drop everything when you need me.Biting his tongue, he opened the stall to lead Patience into the aisle.Careful, he said when Victoria stumbled out of the way.She glared up at him as if she knew what he was doing, how he was trying to bully her.He gave a smile another shot.Oh, you can stop the act, Eli.I know youre mad.Im not mad.Eli, its not like Im doing this to hurt you.The brief touch of her hand against his back, like lightning over the high pastures, lit him up from the inside.This time he shied away, feeling the burn of her hand under his skin.Of course not.Youre taking over the ranch because you have a deep and abiding love of the land.Is that so hard to believe?He looked pointedly at her hair, pulled so tight from her face, that stupid ruffled collar, her stick thin legs beneath the hem of her skirt.Those ridiculous shoes.Yes.Two hours ago hed had a plan for this conversation; now he had to get going, and Victoria was wearing those stupid shoes and he was angry when hed intended to be nice.Fine.All right.Look, Eli, we both know I have no clue what Im doing with this ranch, but I want to learn.I want She took a deep breath and squared her shoulders.Oh crap.She was going to reveal something now.Something that was supposed to make him feel bad, make him want to help her.Dont, he wanted to say.Dont hand me any more weapons to use against you.I want to be good at this.Because youve failed at everything else?Color rose in her cheeks and he smiled in the face of her shame.Through convoluted means shed gained control of this ranch that should by rights be his, and he just had to correct the mistake.Which he could do, right now.I was looking for you this morning because I can make you an offer.For what?Be.Nice.For the ranch.Im not Two million.Dollars?Ah, the Scarecrow was cute when she was confused.A year from now when the ranch is out of escrow and youre begging your brother to sell this place, you wont get that kind of offer.And two million dollars will buy a lot of security for you and your son.That pushed her back on her heels.Youtheres no way you have that kind of money.To his ears it sounded like she was wavering, and his heart pounded hard in his throat.This was it.His hands went numb.I can get it by tomorrow.Then you can go back to throwing parties and buying curtains and whatever the hell else it is women like you do.Oddly, she smiled.And for a moment, surrounded by sun shot dust motes, he saw the girl shed been years before, when her father had forced her to come down to this ranch for the summer.Sweet and out of place, shed followed Eli around like a shadow, even though she was older.Shed been game, always game.And hed liked her.A lot.But when shed arrived at the ranch a few months ago when Lyle Baker was dying, hed been unable to find any of that girl in the pinched, angry, and scared woman shed become.A woman who hadnt even recognized him at first.Shed looked down at him as if he were a servant.A slow and clumsy waiter.He didnt want to see that girl now, not when he was doing his best to crush the woman under his boot heel.Do I seem so useless?You know the answer to that.The barb sunk deep but instead of curling in on herself, she stood up straighter and somehow, he realized too late, hed galvanized her.Im sorry, Eli Sorry?His guts twisted.Didnt you hear me?I said two million dollars.Two million dollars wont buy me any pride.Or self respect.And when you fail at this?How much pride are you going to have then?Im not going to fail.He laughed at her then.Right at her.And that smile faded, replaced by the most ridiculous determination.The most asinine belief in herself.It was like watching a house cat trying to be a tiger.Not if you help me.Im uninformed, Eli.Not stupid.And I want to learn.I wantI want To be good at this, yeah, you said.He managed to dismiss all of her good intentions, all of her noble and brave efforts, with a curt wave of his hand.Victoria Schulman, the society widow who had lost her fortune, had just turned down two million dollars.And Eli was back in the same position hed been in for the past ten years of his lifethrowing money at a Baker who just wouldnt take it.Damn it.He slipped a padded blue saddle blanket over Patiences back while she sidestepped and shook out her mane.Heaving the saddle on next, he fumed.Victoria was still standing there.Still expecting his help.He nudged his knee into Patiences belly as he tightened the saddle cinch.If only every woman in his life were this easy to manage.But the truth was that Victoria had given him the tools to make her fail, to ensure her defeat.The poor woman had been too honest; she couldnt even hide her desire for himher curiosity.The way her eyes clung to his body for just a moment too long.Between his own father and Lyle Baker, the man hed worked for his entire life, Eli had learned everything he needed to know about being a cruel, self serving bastard.Hed never had a reason to use those lessons.Until now.He would wear her down until she begged him to take the ranch.Victoria felt naked, utterly skinless in front of Eli.Shed said all she could to convince him of her good intentions toward the ranch and the land.She didnt know how else to sway him, and yet he seemed unswayed.He slipped the bridle over his giant horses head, tucking the bit into her mouth, clucking when the horse gummed at him.It was as if Victoria were totally invisible and after being invisible to every man in her entire life, shed had enough.Where are you going?Eli tipped his hat back off his eyes and she forced herself not to look away.Those eyes were like sunlight on a mirror.Too bright.Too sharp.Its Saturday.Auction day for the Angus herd.Up in the north pasture.Today?she asked and he nodded, leaning past her.The smell of himsunshine and sweat, horse and dirteddied around her, making her dizzy with a terrible hunger.In the early days of their courtship, Joel had called her femininity delicate.And hed loved that; her weakness had made him feel strong.Like a protector.So, like any good idiot, shed cultivated it.Until she was treated like glass, which was fine in public, but boring in private.Their sex life had been respectful, she told herself.And if smelling Eli Turnbull made her feel as if shed been missing out on something in all those years of quiet and plain missionary position, well, then, add it to the pile of disappointments.She watched his muscles flex and bulge under his brown and white plaid shirt as he lifted a shovel that had been tucked into the corner of the stall.Over the last few years of her marriage, all she had seen Joel lift was his martini glass and the occasional disapproving eyebrow.The herd is mine to do with as I will.Said so in the will.I just have to split any proceeds from the sale with Luc.Howhow many are you selling?Not that she knew how many there were, but she had to try.All of them.My father hasnt been dead four months and youre selling off his pride and joy?Yep.Thats She stopped.Her laughter was a surprise, like finding something shed lost so long ago shed forgotten all about it.Lyle Baker had been a terrible father, a whole hearted son of a bitch, and throwing stones at his bastard daughter had been his favorite pastime.Selling his pride and joy seemed like a marvelous idea.Awesome.Elis green eyes slid over her, over her face and eyes, the two thin collarbones revealed by the ruffled shell she wore, her breasts, small hills against the silk, and then away.Light headed, she had to put a hand on the stall door for balance.Id like to go with you.It seemed like the rancherly thing to do.You want to learn how to be a rancher; you can start at the beginning.Great.Joy surged through her and she fought the urge to clap her hands with excitement.Ill come Youll stay, he said, handing her the shovel.And muck stalls.Like any good greenhorn.No.She pushed the shovel back at him.You want my help?The shovel dangled between them.This is a test?she asked.He shrugged, his smile gleaming with ugly victory.She yanked the shovel out of his hand.You have nothing to teach me about embarrassment, Eli.You think youre punishing me.You think youre teaching me a lesson about something, but trust me, you smug bastard, theres nothing I dont know about degradation.Ill muck your stalls.Ill do whatever you think I need to do Thats right.She leaned in close, her anger a bright flame in her chest, lighting her up in a way shed never experienced before.As if a pilot light had exploded in her furnace.But Im still your boss.For a beautiful moment Eli was blank faced and silent, and she knew she should regret angering the one person she needed as an ally, but it was just too delicious.She smiled as the skin beneath the scruff on his cheeks got red.He swung himself up onto his horse in one smooth, effortless motion.Her body turned to pudding.Did he have to be sobig?Masculine?It made her feelsmall.And to her great shame, damp.I want every stall in this barn cleaned up by the time I get back.And then he was gone.She stood there in her inappropriate shoes, holding a shovel that smelled like poop, and smoldered.He might have won this battle, but he didnt know who he was up against.After years of lying down, of capitulating, of surrendering before she even realized she had something she wanted to fight for, she was filled with an unholy hostility.There was a wars worth of lost fights inside of her.And if Eli was going to stand in the way of what she wantedwell, she smiled, hed better brace himself.She was a woman who was just beginning to realize how scorned she truly was.
