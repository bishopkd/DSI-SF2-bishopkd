You spent two years in the French army and stayed a virgin?I blurted out incredulously.I had had a number of Frenchmen in my care, and I doubted very much that the Gallic attitude toward women had changed appreciably in two hundred years.One corner of Jamies mouth twitched, and he looked down at me sideways.If ye had seen the harlots that service the French army, Sassenach, yed wonder Ive the nerve even to touch a woman, let alone bed one.I choked, spluttering wine and coughing until he was obliged to pound me on the back.I subsided, breathless and red faced, and urged him to go on with his story.He had returned to Scotland a year or so ago, and spent six months alone or with a gang of broken menmen without clansliving hand to mouth in the forest, or raiding cattle from the borderlands.And then, someone hit me in the head wi an ax or something o the sort, he said, shrugging.And Ive to take Dougals word for what happened during the next two months, as I wasna taking much notice of things myself.Dougal had been on a nearby estate at the time of the attack.Summoned by Jamies friends, he had somehow managed to transport his nephew to France.Why France?I asked.Surely it was taking a frightful risk to move you so far.More of a risk to leave me where I was.There were English patrols all over the districtwed been fairly active thereabouts, ye see, me and the ladsand I suppose Dougal didna want them to find me lying senseless in some cottars hut.Or in his own house?I said, a little cynically.I imagine hed ha taken me there, but for two things, Jamie replied.For one, hed an English visitor at the time.For the second, he thought from the look of me I was going to die in any case, so he sent me to the abbey.The Abbey of Ste.Anne de Beaupr, on the French coast, was the domain, it seemed, of the erstwhile Alexander Fraser, now abbot of that sanctuary of learning and worship.One of Jamies six Fraser uncles.He and Dougal do not get on, particularly, Jamie explained, but Dougal could see there was little to be done for me here, while if there was aught to help me, it might be found there.And it was.Assisted by the monks medical knowledge and his own strong constitution, Jamie had survived and gradually mended, under the care of the holy brothers of St.Dominic.Once I was well again, I came back, he explained.Dougal and his men met me at the coast, and we were headed for the MacKenzie lands when we, er, met with you.Captain Randall said you were stealing cattle, I said.He smiled, undisturbed by the accusation.Well, Dougal isna the man to overlook an opportunity of turning a bit of a profit, he observed.We came on a nice bunch of beasts, grazing in a field, and no one about.So He shrugged, with a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitabilities of life.Apparently I had come upon the end of the confrontation between Dougals men and Randalls dragoons.Spotting the English bearing down on them, Dougal had sent half his men around a thicket, driving the cattle before them, while the rest of the Scots had hidden among the saplings, ready to ambush the English as they came by.Worked verra well too, Jamie said in approval.We popped out at them and rode straight through them, yelling.They took after us, of course, and we led them a canty chase uphill and through burns and over rocks and such; and all the while the rest of Dougals men were making off over the border wi the kine.We lost the lobsterbacks, then, and denned up at the cottage where I first saw ye, waiting for darkness to slip out.I see, I said.Why did you come back to Scotland in the first place, though?I should have thought youd be much safer in France.He opened his mouth to reply, then reconsidered, sipping wine.Apparently I was getting near the edge of his own area of secrecy.Well, thats a long story, Sassenach, he said, avoiding the issue.Ill tell it ye later, but for now, what about you?Will ye tell me about your own family?If ye feel ye can, of course, he added hastily.I thought for a moment, but there really seemed little risk in telling him about my parents and Uncle Lamb.There was, after all, some advantage to Uncle Lambs choice of profession.A scholar of antiquities made as muchor as littlesense in the eighteenth century as in the twentieth.So I told him, omitting only such minor details as automobiles and airplanes, and of course, the war.As I talked, he listened intently, asking questions now and then, expressing sympathy at my parents death, and interest in Uncle Lamb and his discoveries.And then I met Frank, I finished up.I paused, not sure how much more I could say, without getting into dangerous territory.Luckily Jamie saved me.And yed as soon not talk about him right now, he said understandingly.I nodded, wordless, my vision blurring a little.Jamie let go of the hand he had been holding, and putting an arm around me, pulled my head gently down on his shoulder.Its all right, he said, softly stroking my hair.Are ye tired, lass?Shall I leave ye to your sleep?I was tempted for a moment to say yes, but I felt that that would be both unfair and cowardly.I cleared my throat and sat up, shaking my head.No, I said, taking a deep breath.He smelled faintly of soap and wine.Im all right.Tell metell me what games you used to play, when you were a boy.* * *    The room was furnished with a thick twelve hour candle, rings of dark wax marking the hours.We talked through three of the rings, only letting go of each others hands to pour wine or get up to visit the privy stool behind the curtain in the corner.Returning from one of these trips, Jamie yawned and stretched.It is awfully late, I said, getting up too.Maybe we should go to bed.All right, he said, rubbing the back of his neck.To bed?Or to sleep?He cocked a quizzical eyebrow and the corner of his mouth twitched.In truth, I had been feeling so comfortable with him that I had almost forgotten why we were there.At his words, I suddenly felt a hollow panic.Well I said, faintly.Either way, youre no intending to sleep in your gown, are ye?he asked, in his usual practical manner.Well, no, I suppose not.In fact, during the rush of events, I had not even thought about a sleeping garmentwhich I did not possess, in any case.I had been sleeping in my chemise or nothing, depending on the weather.Jamie had nothing but the clothes he wore; he was plainly going to sleep in his shirt or naked, a state of affairs which was likely to bring matters rapidly to a head.Well, then, come here and Ill help ye wi the laces and such.His hands did in fact tremble briefly as he began to undress me.He lost some of his self consciousness, though, in the struggle with the dozens of tiny hooks that attached the bodice.Ha!he said in triumph as the last one came loose, and we laughed together.Now let me do you, I said, deciding that there was no point in further delay.I reached up and unfastened his shirt, sliding my hands inside and across his shoulders.I brought my palms slowly down across his chest, feeling the springy hair and the soft indentations around his nipples.He stood still, hardly breathing, as I knelt down to unbuckle the studded belt around his hips.If it must be sometime, it may as well be now, I thought, and deliberately ran my hands up the length of his thighs, hard and lean under his kilt.Though by this time I knew perfectly well what most Scotsmen wore beneath their kiltsnothingit was still something of a shock to find only Jamie.He lifted me to my feet then, and bent his head to kiss me.It went on a long while, and his hands roamed downward, finding the fastening of my petticoat.It fell to the floor in a billow of starched flounces, leaving me in my chemise.Where did you learn to kiss like that?I said, a little breathless.He grinned and pulled me close again.I said I was a virgin, not a monk, he said, kissing me again.If I find I need guidance, Ill ask.He pressed me firmly to him, and I could feel that he was more than ready to get on with the business at hand.With some surprise, I realized that I was ready too.In fact, whether it was the result of the late hour, the wine, his own attractiveness, or simple deprivation, I wanted him quite badly.I pulled his shirt loose at the waist and ran my hands up over his chest, circling his nipples with my thumbs.They grew hard in a second, and he crushed me suddenly against his chest.Oof!I said, struggling for breath.He let go, apologizing.No, dont worry; kiss me again.He did, this time slipping the straps of the chemise down over my shoulders.He drew back slightly, cupping my breasts and rubbing my nipples as I had done his.I fumbled with the buckle that held his kilt; his fingers guided mine and the clasp sprang free.Suddenly he lifted me in his arms and sat down on the bed, holding me on his lap.He spoke a little hoarsely.Tell me if Im too rough, or tell me to stop altogether, if ye wish.Anytime until we are joined; I dinna think I can stop after that.In answer, I put my hands behind his neck and pulled him down on top of me.I guided him to the slippery cleft between my legs.Holy God, said James Fraser, who never took the name of his Lord in vain.Dont stop now, I said.* * *    Lying together afterward, it seemed natural for him to cradle my head on his chest.We fitted well together, and most of our original constraint was gone, lost in shared excitement and the novelty of exploring each other.Was it like you thought it would be?I asked curiously.He chuckled, making a deep rumble under my ear.Almost; I had thoughtnay, never mind.No, tell me.What did you think?Im no goin to tell ye; yell laugh at me.I promise not to laugh.Tell me.He caressed my hair, smoothing the curls back from my ear.Oh, all right.I didna realize that ye did it face to face.I thought ye must do it the back way, like; like horses, ye know.It was a struggle to keep my promise, but I didnt laugh.I know that sounds silly, he said defensively.Its justwell, ye know how you get ideas in your head when youre young, and then somehow they just stick there?Youve never seen people make love?I was surprised at this, having seen the crofters cottages, where the whole family shared a single room.Granted that Jamies family were not crofters, still it must be the rare Scottish child who had never waked to find his elders coupling nearby.Of course I have, but generally under the bedclothes, ye know.I couldna tell anything except the man was on top.That much I knew.Mm.I noticed.Did I squash you?he asked, a little anxiously.Not much.Really, though, is that what you thought?I didnt laugh, but couldnt help grinning broadly.He turned slightly pink around the ears.Aye.I saw a man take a woman plain, once, out in the open.But thatwell, it was a rape, was what it was, and he took her from the back.It made some impression on me, and as I say, its just the idea stuck.He continued to hold me, using his horse gentling techniques again.These gradually changed, though, to a more determined exploration.I want to ask ye something, he said, running a hand down the length of my back.Whats that?Did ye like it?he said, a little shyly.Yes, I did, I said, quite honestly.Oh.I thought ye did, though Murtagh told me that women generally do not care for it, so I should finish as soon as I could.What would Murtagh know about it?I said indignantly.The slower the better, as far as most women are concerned.Jamie chuckled again.Well, youd know better than Murtagh.I had considerable good advice offered me on the subject last night, from Murtagh and Rupert and Ned.A good bit of it sounded verra unlikely to me, though, so I thought Id best use my own judgment.It hasnt led you wrong yet, I said, curling one of his chest hairs around my finger.What other sage bits of advice did they give you?His skin was a ruddy gold in the candlelight; to my amusement, it grew still redder in embarrassment.I could no repeat most of it.As I said, I think its likely wrong, anyway.Ive seen a good many kinds of animals mate with each other, and most seem to manage it without any advice at all.I would suppose people could do the same.I was privately entertained by the notion of someone picking up pointers on sexual technique from barnyard and forest, rather than locker rooms and dirty magazines.What kinds of animals have you seen mating?Oh, all kinds.Our farm was near the forest, ye see, and I spent a good deal of time there, hunting, or seeking cows as had got out and suchlike.Ive seen horses and cows, of course, pigs, chickens, doves, dogs, cats, red deer, squirrels, rabbits, wild boar, oh, and once even a pair of snakes.Snakes!?Aye.Did ye know that snakes have two cocks?male snakes, I mean.No, I didnt.Are you sure about that?Aye, and both of em forked, like this.He spread his second and third fingers apart in illustration.That sounds terribly uncomfortable for the female snake, I said, giggling.Well, she appeared to be enjoying herself, said Jamie.Near as I could tell; snakes havena got much expression on their faces.I buried my face in his chest, snorting with mirth.His pleasant musky smell mingled with the harsh scent of linen.Take off your shirt, I said, sitting up and pulling at the hem of the garment.Why?he asked, but sat up and obliged.I knelt in front of him, admiring his naked body.Because I want to look at you, I said.He was beautifully made, with long graceful bones and flat muscles that flowed smoothly from the curves of chest and shoulder to the slight concavities of belly and thigh.He raised his eyebrows.Well then, fairs fair.Take off yours, then.He reached out and helped me squirm out of the wrinkled chemise, pushing it down over my hips.Once it was off, he held me by the waist, studying me with intense interest.I grew almost embarrassed as he looked me over.Havent you ever seen a naked woman before?I asked.Aye, but not one so close.His face broke into a broad grin.And not one thats mine.He stroked my hips with both hands.You have good wide hips; yed be a good breeder, I expect.What!?I drew away indignantly, but he pulled me back and collapsed on the bed with me on top of him.He held me until I stopped struggling, then raised me enough to meet his lips again.I know once is enough to make it legal, but He paused shyly.You want to do it again?Would ye mind verra much?I didnt laugh this time either, but I felt my ribs creak under the strain.No, I said gravely.I wouldnt mind.* * *    Are you hungry?I asked softly, sometime later.Famished.He bent his head to bite my breast softly, then looked up with a grin.But I need food too.He rolled to the edge of the bed.Theres cold beef and bread in the kitchen, I expect, and likely wine as well.Ill go and bring us some supper.No, dont you get up.Ill fetch it.I jumped off the bed and headed for the door, pulling a shawl over my shift against the chill of the corridor.Wait, Claire!Jamie called.Yed better let me but I had already opened the door.My appearance at the door was greeted by a raucous cheer from some fifteen men, lounging around the fireplace of the main room below, drinking, eating and tossing dice.I stood nonplussed on the balcony for a moment, fifteen leering faces flickering out of the firelit shadows at me.Hey, lass!shouted Rupert, one of the loungers.Yere still able t walk!Isnt Jamie doin his duty by ye, then?This sally was greeted with gales of laughter and a number of even cruder remarks regarding Jamies prowess.If yeve worn Jamie out aready, Ill be happy t take is place!offered a short dark haired youth.Nay, nay, es no good, lass, take me!shouted another.Shell ha none o ye, lads!yelled Murtagh, uproariously drunk.After Jamie, shell need somethin like this to satisfy er!He waved a huge mutton bone overhead, causing the room to rock with laughter.I whirled back into the room, slammed the door and stood with my back to it, glaring at Jamie, who lay naked on the bed, shaking with laughter.I tried to warn ye, he said, gasping.You should see your face!Just what, I hissed, are all those men doing out there?Jamie slid gracefully off our wedding couch and began rummaging on his knees through the pile of discarded clothing on the floor.Witnesses, he said briefly.Dougal is no takin any chances of this marriage bein annulled.He straightened with his kilt in his hands, grinning at me as he wrapped it around his loins.Im afraid your reputations compromised beyond repair, Sassenach.He started shirtless for the door.Dont go out there!I said, in sudden panic.He turned to smile reassuringly, hand on the latch.Dinna worry, lass.If theyre witnesses, they may as well have somethin to see.Besides, Im no intendin to starve for the next three days for fear of a wee bit o chaff.He stepped out of the room to a chorus of bawdy applause, leaving the door slightly ajar.I could hear his progress toward the kitchen, marked by shouted congratulations and ribald questions and advice.How was yer first time, Jamie?Did ye bleed?shouted Ruperts easily recognized gravel pit voice.Nay, but ye will, ye auld bugger, if ye dinna clapper yer face, came Jamies spiked tones in broad Scots reply.Howls of delight greeted this sally, and the raillery continued, following Jamie down the hall to the kitchen and back up the stairs.I pushed open the door a crack to admit Jamie, face red as the fire below and hands piled high with food and drink.He sidled in, followed by a final burst of hilarity from below.I choked it off with a decisive slam of the door, and shot the bolt to.I brought enough well no need to go out again for a bit, Jamie said, laying out dishes on the table, carefully not looking at me.Will ye have a bite?I reached past him for the bottle of wine.Not just yet.What I need is a drink.* * *    There was a powerful urgency in him that roused me to response despite his awkwardness.Not wanting to lecture nor yet to highlight my own experience, I let him do what he would, only offering an occasional suggestion, such as that he might carry his weight on his elbows and not my chest.As yet too hungry and too clumsy for tenderness, still he made love with a sort of unflagging joy that made me think that male virginity might be a highly underrated commodity.He exhibited a concern for my safety, though, that I found at once endearing and irritating.Sometime in our third encounter, I arched tightly against him and cried out.He drew back at once, startled and apologetic.Im sorry, he said.I didna mean to hurt ye.You didnt.I stretched languorously, feeling dreamily wonderful.Are you sure?he said, inspecting me for damage.Suddenly it dawned on me that a few of the finer points had likely been left out of his hasty education at the hands of Murtagh and Rupert.Does it happen every time?he asked, fascinated, once I had enlightened him.I felt rather like the Wife of Bath, or a Japanese geisha.I had never envisioned myself as an instructress in the arts of love, but I had to admit to myself that the role held certain attractions.No, not every time, I said, amused.Only if the man is a good lover.Oh.His ears turned faintly pink.I was slightly alarmed to see the look of frank interest being replaced with one of growing determination.Will you tell me what I should do next time?he asked.You dont need to do anything special, I assured him.Just go slowly and pay attention.Why wait, though?Youre still ready.He was surprised.You dont need to wait?I canna do it again right away after  Well, women are different.Aye, I noticed, he muttered.He circled my wrist with thumb and index finger.Its justyoure so small; Im afraid Im going to hurt you.You are not going to hurt me, I said impatiently.And if you did, I wouldnt mind.Seeing puzzled incomprehension on his face, I decided to show him what I meant.What are you doing?he asked, shocked.Just what it looks like.Hold still.After a few moments, I began to use my teeth, pressing progressively harder until he drew in his breath with a sharp hiss.I stopped.Did I hurt you?I asked.Yes.A little.He sounded half strangled.Do you want me to stop?No!I went on, being deliberately rough, until he suddenly convulsed, with a groan that sounded as though I had torn his heart out by the roots.He lay back, quivering and breathing heavily.He muttered something in Gaelic, eyes closed.What did you say?I said, he answered, opening his eyes, I thought my heart was going to burst.I grinned, pleased with myself.Oh, Murtagh and company didnt tell you about that, either?Aye, they did.That was one of the things I didnt believe.I laughed.In that case, maybe youd better not tell me what else they told you.Do you see what I meant, though, about not minding if youre rough?Aye.He drew a deep breath and blew it out slowly.If I did that to you, would it feel the same?Well, you know, I said, slowly, I dont really know.I had been doing my best to keep my thoughts of Frank at bay, feeling that there should really be no more than two people in a marriage bed, regardless of how they got there.Jamie was very different from Frank, both in body and mind, but there are in fact only a limited number of ways in which two bodies can meet, and we had not yet established that territory of intimacy in which the act of love takes on infinite variety.The echoes of the flesh were unavoidable, but there were a few territories still unexplored.Jamies brows were tilted in an expression of mocking threat.Oh, so theres something you dont know?Well, well find out then, wont we?As soon as Ive the strength for it.He closed his eyes again.Next week, sometime.* * *    I woke in the hours before dawn, shivering and rigid with terror.I could not recall the dream that woke me, but the abrupt plunge into reality was equally frightening.It had been possible to forget my situation for a time the night before, lost in the pleasures of newfound intimacy.Now I was alone, next to a sleeping stranger with whom my life was inextricably linked, adrift in a place filled with unseen threat.I must have made some sound of distress, for there was a sudden upheaval of bedclothes as the stranger in my bed vaulted to the floor with the heartstopping suddenness of a pheasant rising underfoot.He came to rest in a crouch near the door of the chamber, barely visible in the pre dawn light.Pausing to listen carefully at the door, he made a rapid inspection of the room, gliding soundlessly from door to window to bed.The angle of his arm told me that he held a weapon of some sort, though I could not see what it was in the darkness.Sitting down next to me, satisfied that all was secure, he slid the knife or whatever it was back into its hiding place above the headboard.Are you all right?he whispered.His fingers brushed my wet cheek.Yes.Im sorry to wake you.I had a nightmare.What on earth I started to ask what it was that had made him spring so abruptly to the alert.A large warm hand ran down my bare arm, interrupting my question.No wonder; youre frozen.The hand urged me under the pile of quilts and into the warm space recently vacated.My fault, he murmured.Ive taken all the quilts.Im afraid Im no accustomed yet to share a bed.He wrapped the quilts comfortably around us and lay back beside me.A moment later, he reached again to touch my face.Is it me?he asked quietly.Can ye not bear me?I gave a short hiccupping laugh, not quite a sob.No, it isnt you.I reached out in the dark, groping for a hand to press reassuringly.My fingers met a tangle of quilts and warm flesh, but at last I found the hand I had been seeking.We lay side by side, looking up at the low beamed ceiling.What if I said I couldnt bear you?I asked suddenly.What on earth could you do?The bed creaked as he shrugged.Tell Dougal you wanted an annulment on grounds of nonconsummation, I suppose.This time I laughed outright.Nonconsummation!With all those witnesses?The room was growing light enough to see the smile on the face turned toward me.Aye well, witnesses or no, its only you and me that can say for sure, isnt it?And Id rather be embarrassed than wed to someone that hated me.I turned toward him.I dont hate you.I dont hate you, either.And theres many good marriages have started wi less than that.Gently, he turned me away from him and fitted himself to my back so we lay nested together.His hand cupped my breast, not in invitation or demand, but because it seemed to belong there.Dont be afraid, he whispered into my hair.Theres the two of us now.I felt warm, soothed, and safe for the first time in many days.It was only as I drifted into sleep under the first rays of daylight that I remembered the knife above my head, and wondered again, what threat would make a man sleep armed and watchful in his bridal chamber?16    ONE FINE DAY    The hard won intimacy of the night seemed to have evaporated with the dew, and there was considerable constraint between us in the morning.After a mostly silent breakfast taken in our room, we climbed the small hillock behind the inn, exchanging rather strained politenesses from time to time.At the crest, I settled on a log to rest, while Jamie sat on the ground, back against a pine sapling, a few feet away.Some bird was active in the bush behind me, a siskin, I supposed, or possibly a thrush.I listened to its dilatory rustlings, watched the small fluffy clouds float by, and pondered the etiquette of the situation.The silence was becoming really too heavy to bear, when Jamie suddenly said, I hope then stopped and blushed.Though I rather felt it should be me blushing, I was glad that at least one of us was able to do it.What?I said as encouragingly as possible.He shook his head, still pink.It doesna matter.Go ahead.I reached out a foot and nudged his leg with a tentative toe.Honesty, remember?It was unfair, but I really couldnt stand any more nervous throat clearing and eye twitching.His clasped hands tightened around his knees, and he rocked back a bit, but fixed his gaze directly on me.I was going to say, he said softly, that I hoped the man who had the honor to lie first wi you was as generous as you were with me.He smiled, a little shyly.But on second thought, that didna sound quite right.What I meantwell, all I wanted was to say thank you.Generosity had nothing to do with it!I snapped, looking down and brushing energetically at a nonexistent spot on my dress.A large boot pushed into my downcast field of vision and nudged my ankle.Honesty, is it?he echoed, and I looked up to meet a derisively raised pair of eyebrows above a wide grin.Well, I said defensively, not after the first time, anyway.He laughed, and I discovered to my horror that I was not beyond blushing after all.A cool shadow fell over my heated face and a large pair of hands took firm hold of mine and pulled me to my feet.Jamie took my place on the log, and patted his knee invitingly.Sit, he said.I reluctantly obliged, keeping my face turned away.He settled me comfortably against his chest and wrapped his arms about my waist.I felt the steady thump of his heart against my back.Now then, he said.If we canna talk easy yet without touching, well touch for a bit.Tell me when youre accustomed to me again.He leaned back so that we were in the shade of an oak, and held me close without speaking, just breathing slowly, so that I felt the rise and fall of his chest and the stir of his breath in my hair.All right, I said after a moment.Good.He loosened his grip and turned me to face him.At close range, I could see the bristle of auburn stubble on cheek and chin.I brushed my fingers across it; it was like the plush on an old fashioned sofa, stiff and soft at the same time.Im sorry, he said, I couldna shave this morning.Dougal gave me a razor before the wedding yesterday, but he took it backin case I cut my throat after the wedding night, I expect.He grinned down at me and I smiled back.The reference to Dougal reminded me of our conversation of the night before.I wondered I said.Last night, you said Dougal and his men met you at the coast when you came back from France.Why did you come back with him, instead of going to your own home, or the Fraser lands?I mean, the way Dougals treated you I trailed off, hesitant.Oh, he said, shifting his legs to bear my weight more evenly.I could almost hear him thinking to himself.He made up his mind quite quickly.Well, its something ye should know, I suppose.He frowned to himself.I told ye why Im outlawed.Well, for a time afterafter I left the Fort, I didna care muchabout anything.My father died about that time, and my sister He paused again, and I sensed some kind of struggle going on inside him.I twisted around to look at him.The normally cheerful face was shadowed with some strong emotion.Dougal told me, he said slowly, Dougal told me that that my sister was wi child.By Randall.Oh, dear.He glanced sideways at me, then away.His eyes were bright as sapphires and he blinked hastily once or twice.II couldna bring myself to go back, he said, low voiced.To see her again, after what happened.And toohe sighed, then set his lips firmlyDougal told me that shethat after the child was born, shewell, of course, she couldna help it; she was alonedamn it, I left her alone!He said she had taken up wi another English soldier, someone from the garrison, he didna know which one.He swallowed heavily, then went on more firmly.I sent back what money I could, of course, but I could notwell, I couldna bring myself to write to her.What could I say?He shrugged helplessly.Anyway, after a time I grew tired of soldiering in France.And I heard through my Uncle Alex that hed had word of an English deserter, named Horrocks.The man had left the army and taken service wi Francis MacLean o Dunweary.He was in his cups one day and let out that hed been stationed wi the garrison at Fort William when I escaped.And hed seen the man who shot the sergeant major that day.So he could prove that it wasnt you!This sounded good news, and I said so.Jamie nodded.Well, yes.Though the word of a deserter would likely not count for much.Still, its a start.At least Id know myself who it was.And while Iwell, I dinna see how I can go back to Lallybroch; still it would be as well if I could walk the soil of Scotland without the risk of being hanged.Yes, that seems a good idea, I said dryly.But where do the MacKenzies come into it?There followed a certain amount of complicated analysis of family relationships and clan alliances, but when the smoke cleared away, it appeared that Francis MacLean was some connection with the MacKenzie side, and had sent word of Horrocks to Colum, who had sent Dougal to make contact with Jamie.Which is how he came to be nearby when I was wounded, Jamie finished up.He paused, squinting into the sun.I wondered, afterward, ye know, whether perhaps hed done it.Hit you with an ax?Your own uncle?Why on earth!?He frowned as though weighing how much to tell me, then shrugged.I dinna ken how much ye know about the clan MacKenzie, he said, though I imagine ye canna have ridden wi old Ned Gowan for days without hearin something of it.He canna keep off the subject for long.He nodded at my answering smile.Well, youve seen Colum for yourself.Anyone can see that hell not make old bones.And wee Hamish is barely eight; hell no be able to lead a clan for ten years yet.So what happens if Colum dies before Hamish is ready?He looked at me, prompting.Well, Dougal would be laird, I suppose, I said slowly, at least until Hamish is old enough.Aye, thats true.Jamie nodded.But Dougals not the man Colum is, and there are those in the clan that wouldna follow him so gladlyif there were an alternative.I see, I said slowly, and you are the alternative.I looked him over carefully, and had to admit that there was a certain amount of possibility there.He was old Jacobs grandson; a MacKenzie by blood, if only on his mothers side.A big, comely, well made lad, plainly intelligent, and with the family knack for managing people.He had fought in France and proved his ability to lead men in battle; an important consideration.Even the price on his head might not be an insurmountable obstacleif he were laird.The English had enough trouble in the Highlands, between the constant small rebellions, the border raids and the warring clans, not to risk a major uprising by accusing the chieftain of a major clan of murderwhich would seem no murder at all to the clansmen.To hang an unimportant Fraser clansman was one thing; to storm Castle Leoch and drag out the laird of the clan MacKenzie to face English justice was something else again.Do you mean to be laird, if Colum dies?It was one way out of his difficulties, after all, though I suspected it was a way hedged with its own considerable obstacles.He smiled briefly at the thought.No.Even if I felt myself entitled to itwhich I dontit would split the clan, Dougals men against those that might follow me.I havena the taste for power at the cost of other mens blood.But Dougal and Colum couldna be sure of that, could they?So they might think it safer just to kill me than to take the risk.My brow was furrowed, thinking it all out.But surely you could tell Dougal and Colum that you dont intendoh.I looked up at him with considerable respect.But you did.At the oath taking.I had thought already how well he had handled a dangerous situation there; now I saw just how dangerous it had been.The clansmen had certainly wanted him to take his oath; just as certainly Colum had not.To swear such an oath was to declare himself a member of the clan MacKenzie, and as such, a potential candidate for chieftain of the clan.He risked open violence or death for refusal; he risked the samemore privatelyfor compliance.Seeing the danger, he had taken the prudent course of staying away from the ceremony.And when I, by my botched escape attempt, had led him straight back to the edge of the abyss, he had set a sure and certain foot on a very narrow tightrope, and walked it to the other side.Je suis prest, indeed.He nodded, seeing the thoughts cross my face.Aye.If I had sworn my oath that night, chances are I wouldna have seen the dawn.I felt a little shaky at the thought, as well as at the knowledge that I had unwittingly exposed him to such danger.The knife over his bed suddenly seemed nothing more than a sensible precaution.I wondered how many nights he had slept armed at Leoch, expecting death to come visiting.I always sleep armed, Sassenach, he said, though I had not spoken.Except for the monastery, last night is the first time in months Ive not slept wi my dirk in my fist.He grinned, plainly remembering what had been in his fist, instead.How the bloody hell did you know what I was thinking?I demanded, ignoring the grin.He shook his head good naturedly.Youd make a verra poor spy, Sassenach.Everything ye think shows on your face, plain as day.You looked at my dirk and then ye blushed.He studied me appraisingly, bright head on one side.I asked ye for honesty last night, but it wasna really necessary; it isna in you to lie.Just as well, since Im apparently so bad at it, I observed with some asperity.Am I to take it that at least you dont think Im a spy, then?He didnt answer.He was looking over my shoulder toward the inn, body suddenly tense as a bowstring.I was startled for a moment, but then heard the sounds that had attracted his attention.The thud of hooves and jangle of harness; a large group of mounted men was coming down the road toward the inn.Moving cautiously, Jamie crouched behind the screen of bushes, at a spot commanding a view of the road.I tucked my skirts up and crawled after him as silently as I could.The road hooked sharply past a rocky outcrop, then curved more gently down to the hollow where the inn lay.The morning breeze carried the sounds of the approaching group in our direction, but it was a minute or two before the first horse poked its nose into sight.It was a group of some twenty or thirty men, mostly wearing leather trews and tartan clad, but in a variety of colors and patterns.All, without exception, were well armed.Each horse bore at least one musket strapped to the saddle, and there was an abundance of pistols, dirks, and swords on view, plus whatever further armament might be concealed in the capacious saddlebags of the four packhorses.Six of the men also led extra mounts, unburdened and saddleless.Despite their warlike accoutrements, the men seemed relaxed; they were chatting and laughing in small groups as they rode, though here and there a head raised, watchful of the surroundings.I fought back the urge to duck as one mans gaze passed over the spot where we lay hidden; it seemed as though that searching look must surely discover some random movement or the gleam of the sun off Jamies hair.Glancing up at this thought, I discovered that it had occurred to him as well; he had pulled a fold of his plaid up over his head and shoulders, so that the dull hunting pattern made him effectively part of the shrubbery.As the last of the men wound down into the innyard, Jamie dropped the plaid and motioned back toward the path up the hill.Do you know who they are?I panted, as I followed him up into the heather.Oh, aye.Jamie took the steep path like a mountain goat, with no loss of breath or composure.Glancing back, he noticed my labored progress and stopped, reaching down a hand to help me.Its the Watch, he said, nodding back in the direction of the inn.Were safe enough, but I thought wed as soon be a bit further away.I had heard of the famous Black Watch, that informal police force that kept order in the Highlands, and heard also that there were other Watches, each patrolling its own area, collecting subscriptions from clients for the safeguarding of cattle and property.Clients in arrears might well wake one morning to find their livestock vanished in the night, and none to tell where they had gone certainly not the men of the Watch.I was seized by a sudden irrational terror.Theyre not looking for you, are they?Startled, he looked back as though expecting to see men scrambling up the hill in pursuit, but there was no one, and he looked back at me with a relieved smile and put an arm about my waist to help me along.Nay, I doubt it.Ten pound sterling is not enough to make me worth the hunting by a pack like that.And if they kent I was at the inn, they wouldna have come as they did, traipsing up to the door all of a piece.He shook his head decisively.No, were they hunting anyone, theyd send men to guard the back and the windows before coming in the front door.Theyve but stopped there for refreshment, likely.We continued to climb, past the spot where the, rude path petered out in clumps of gorse and heather.We were among foothills here, and the granite rocks rose higher than Jamies head, reminding me uncomfortably of the standing stones of Craigh na Dun.We emerged then, onto the top of a small dun, and the hills sloped away in a breathtaking fall of rocks and green on all sides.Most places in the Highlands gave me a feeling of being surrounded by trees or rocks or mountains, but here we were exposed to the fresh drafts of the wind and the rays of the sun, which had come out as though in celebration of our unorthodox marriage.I experienced a heady sense of freedom at being out from under Dougals influence and the claustrophobic company of so many men.I was tempted to urge Jamie to run away, and to take me with him, but common sense prevailed.We had neither of us any money nor any food beyond the bit of lunch that he carried in his sporran.We would certainly be pursued if we did not return to the inn by sundown.And while Jamie could plainly climb rocks all day without breaking a sweat or getting out of breath, I was in no such training.Noticing my red face, he led me to a rock and sat beside me, contentedly gazing out over the hills while he waited for me to regain my breath.We were certainly safe here.Thinking of the Watch, I laid a hand impulsively on Jamies arm.Im awfully glad youre not worth very much, I said.He regarded me for a moment, rubbing his nose, which was beginning to redden.Well, I might take that several ways, Sassenach, but under the circumstances, he said, thank you.I should thank you, I said, for marrying me.I must say that Id rather be here than in Fort William.I thank ye for the compliment, lady, he said, with a slight bow.So would I.  And while were busy thanking each other, he added, I should thank you for marrying me, as well.Er, well I blushed once more.Not only for that, Sassenach, he said, his grin widening.Though certainly for that as well.But I imagine youve also saved my life for me, at least so far as the MacKenzies are concerned.Whatever do you mean?Being half MacKenzie is one thing, he explained.Being half MacKenzie wi an English wife is quite another.There isna much chance of a Sassenach wench ever becoming lady of Leoch, whatever the clansmen might think of me alone.Thats why Dougal picked me to wed ye to, ye ken.He lifted one brow, reddish gold in the morning sun.I hope ye wouldna have preferred Rupert, after all?No, I wouldnt, I said with emphasis.He laughed and got up, brushing pine needles from his kilts.Well, my mother told me Id be some lassies choice one fine day.He reached down a hand and helped me up.I told her, he continued, that I thought it was the mans part to choose.And what did she say to that?I asked.She rolled her eyes and said Youll find out, my fine wee cockerel, youll find out.He laughed.And so I have.He looked upward, to where the sun was now seeping through the pine needles in lemon threads.And it is a fine day, at that.Come along, Sassenach.Ill take ye fishin.We went further up into the hills.This time Jamie turned to the north, and over a jumble of stone and through a crevice, into the head of a tiny glen, rock walled and leafy, filled with the gurgling of water from the burn that spilled from a dozen wee falls among the rocks and plunged roistering down the length of the canyon into a series of rills and pools below.We dangled our feet in the water, moving from shade to sun and back to shade as we grew too warm, talking of this and that and not much of anything, both aware of each others smallest movement, both content to wait until chance should bring us to that moment when a glance should linger, and a touch should signal more.Above one dark speckled pool, Jamie showed me how to tickle trout.Crouched to avoid the low growing branches overhead, he duck walked along an overhanging ledge, arms outstretched for balance.Halfway along, he turned carefully on the rock and stretched out his hand, urging me to follow.I had my skirts tucked up already, for walking through rough country, and managed well enough.We stretched full length on the cool rock, head to head, peering down into the water, willow branches brushing our backs.All it is, he said, is to pick a good spot, and then wait.He dipped one hand below the surface, smoothly, no splashing, and let it lie on the sandy bottom, just outside the line of shadow made by the rocky overhang.The long fingers curled delicately toward the palm, distorted by the water so that they seemed to wave gently to and fro in unison, like the leaves of a water plant, though I saw from the still muscling of his forearm that he was not moving his hand at all.The column of his arm bent abruptly at the surface, seeming as disjointed as it had been when I had met him, little more than a monthmy God, only a month?before.Met one month, married one day.Bound by vows and by blood.And by friendship as well.When the time came to leave, I hoped that I would not hurt him too badly.I found myself glad that for the moment, I need not think about it; we were far from Craigh na Dun, and not a chance in the world of escape from Dougal for the present.There he is.Jamies voice was low, hardly more than a breath; he had told me that trout have sensitive ears.From my angle of view, the trout was little more than a stirring of the speckled sand.Deep in the rock shadow, there was no telltale gleam of scales.Speckles moved on speckles, shifted by the fanning of transparent fins, invisible but for their motion.The minnows that had gathered to pluck curiously at the hairs on Jamies wrist fled away into the brightness of the pool.One finger bent slowly, so slowly it was hard to see the movement.I could tell it moved only by its changing position, relative to the other fingers.Another finger, slowly bent.And after a long, long moment, another.I scarcely dared breathe, and my heart beat against the cold rock with a rhythm faster than the breathing of the fish.Sluggishly the fingers bent back, lying open, one by one, and the slow hypnotic wave began again, one finger, one finger, one finger more, the movement a smooth ripple like the edge of a fishs fin.As though drawn by the slow motion beckoning, the trouts nose pressed outward, a delicate gasping of mouth and gills, busy in the rhythm of breathing, pink lining showing, not showing, showing, not showing, as the opercula beat like a heart.The chewing mouth groped and bit water.Most of the body was clear of the rock now, hanging weightless in the water, still in the shadow.I could see one eye, twitching to and fro in a blank, directionless stare.An inch more would bring the flapping gill covers right over the treacherous beckoning fingers.I found that I was gripping the rock with both hands, pressing my cheek hard against the granite, as though I could make myself still more inconspicuous.There was a sudden explosion of motion.Everything happened so fast I couldnt see what actually did take place.There was a heavy splatter of water that sluiced across the rock an inch from my face, and a flurry of plaid as Jamie rolled across the rock above me, and a heavy splat as the fishs body sailed through the air and struck the leaf strewn bank.Jamie surged off the ledge and into the shallows of the side pool, splashing across to retrieve his prize before the stunned fish could succeed in flapping its way back to the sanctuary of the water.Seizing it by the tail, he slapped it expertly against a rock, killing it at once, then waded back to show it to me.A good size, he said proudly, holding out a solid fourteen incher.Do nicely for breakfast.He grinned up at me, wet to the thighs, hair hanging in his face, shirt splotched with water and dead leaves.I told you Id not let ye go hungry.He wrapped the trout in layers of burdock leaves and cool mud.Then he rinsed his fingers in the cold water of the burn, and clambering up onto the rock, handed me the neatly wrapped parcel.An odd wedding present, may be, he nodded at the trout, but not without precedent, as Ned Gowan might say.There are precedents for giving a new wife a fish?I asked, entertained.He stripped off his stockings to dry and laid them on the rock to lie in the sun.His long bare toes wiggled in enjoyment of the warmth.Its an old love song, from the Isles.Dye want to hear it?Yes, of course.Er, in English, if you can, I added.Oh, aye.Ive no voice for music, but Ill give you the words.And fingering the hair back out of his eyes, he recited,  Thou daughter of the King of bright lit mansions  On the night that our wedding is on us,  If living man I be in Duntulm,  I will go bounding to thee with gifts.Thou wilt get a hundred badgers, dwellers in banks,  A hundred brown otters, natives of streams,  A hundred silver trout, rising from their pools    And on through a remarkable list of the flora and fauna of the Isles.I had time, watching him declaim, to reflect on the oddity of sitting on a rock in a Scottish pool, listening to Gaelic love songs, with a large dead fish in my lap.And the greater oddity that I was enjoying myself very much indeed.When he finished, I applauded, keeping hold of the trout by gripping it between my knees.Oh, I like that one!Especially the I will go bounding to thee with gifts.He sounds a most enthusiastic lover.Eyes closed against the sun, Jamie laughed.I suppose I could add a line for myselfI will leap into pools for thy sake.We both laughed, and then were quiet for a time, basking in the warm sun of the early summer.It was very peaceful there, with no sound but the rushing of water beyond our still pool.Jamies breathing had calmed.I was very conscious of the slow rise and fall of his breast, and the slow beat of the pulse in his neck.He had a small triangular scar, just there at the base of his throat.I could feel the shyness and constraint beginning to creep back.I reached out a hand and grasped his tightly, hoping that the touch would reestablish the ease between us as it had before.He slid an arm about my shoulders, but it only made me aware of the hard lines of his body beneath the thin shirt.I pulled away, under the pretext of plucking a bunch of pink flowered storksbill that grew from a crack in the rock.Good for headache, I explained, tucking them into my belt.It troubles you, he said, tilting his head to look at me intently.Not headache, I dont mean.Frank.Youre thinking of him, and so it troubles you when I touch you, because ye canna hold us both in your mind.Is that it?Youre very perceptive, I said, surprised.He smiled, but made no move to touch me again.No great task to puzzle that out, lass.I knew when we married that you couldna help but have him often in your mind, did ye want to or no.I didnt, at the moment, but he was right; I couldnt help it.Am I much like him?he asked suddenly.No.In fact, it would be difficult to imagine a greater contrast.Frank was slender, lithe and dark, where Jamie was large, powerful and fair as a ruddy sunbeam.While both men had the compact grace of athletes, Franks was the build of a tennis player, Jamies the body of a warrior, shapedand batteredby the abrasion of sheer physical adversity.Frank stood a scant four inches above my own five foot six.Face to face with Jamie, my nose fitted comfortably into the small hollow in the center of his chest, and his chin could rest easily on top of my head.Nor was the physical the only dimension where the two men varied.There was nearly fifteen years difference in their ages, for one thing, which likely accounted for some of the difference between Franks urbane reserve and Jamies frank openness.As a lover, Frank was polished, sophisticated, considerate, and skilled.Lacking experience or the pretense of it, Jamie simply gave me all of himself, without reservation.And the depth of my response to that unsettled me completely.Jamie was watching my struggle, not without sympathy.Well, then, it would seem I have two choices in the matter, he said.I can let you brood about it, or  He leaned down and gently fitted his mouth over mine.I had kissed my share of men, particularly during the war years, when flirtation and instant romance were the light minded companions of death and uncertainty.Jamie, though, was something different.His extreme gentleness was in no way tentative; rather it was a promise of power known and held in leash; a challenge and a provocation the more remarkable for its lack of demand.I am yours, it said.And if you will have me, then  I would, and my mouth opened beneath his, wholeheartedly accepting both promise and challenge without consulting me.After a long moment, he lifted his head and smiled down at me.Or, I can try to distract ye from your thoughts, he finished.He pressed my head against his shoulder, stroking my hair and smoothing the leaping curls around my ears.I do not know if it will help, he said, quietly, but I will tell you this: it is a gift and a wonder to me, to know that I can please youthat your body can rouse to mine.I hadna thought of such a thingbeforehand.I drew a long breath before replying.Yes, I said.It helps.I think.We were silent again for what seemed a long time.At last Jamie drew away and looked down at me, smiling.I told ye Ive neither money nor property, Sassenach?I nodded, wondering what he intended.I should have warned ye before that wed likely end up sleeping in haystacks, wi naught but heather ale and drammach for food.I dont mind, I said.He nodded toward an opening in the trees, not taking his eyes off me.I havena got a haystack about me, but theres a fair patch of fresh bracken yonder.If yed care to practice, just to get the way of it?* * *    A little later, I stroked his back, damp with exertion and the juice of crushed ferns.If you say thank you once more, I will slap you, I said.Instead, I was answered with a gentle snore.An overhanging fern brushed his cheek, and an inquisitive ant crawled across his hand, making the long fingers twitch in his sleep.I brushed it away and leaned back on one elbow, watching him.His lashes were long, seen thus with his eyes closed, and thick.Oddly colored, though; dark auburn at the tips, they were very light, almost blond at the roots.The firm line of his mouth had relaxed in sleep.While it kept a faintly humorous curl at the corner, his lower lip now eased into a fuller curve that seemed both sensual and innocent.Damn, I said softly to myself.I had been fighting it for some time.Even before this ridiculous marriage, I had been more than conscious of his attraction.It had happened before, as it doubtless happens to almost everyone.A sudden sensitivity to the presence, the appearance, of a particular manor woman, I suppose.The urge to follow him with my eyes, to arrange for small inadvertent meetings, to watch him unawares as he went about his work, an exquisite sensitivity to the small details of his bodythe shoulder blades beneath the cloth of his shirt, the lumpy bones of his wrists, the soft place underneath his jaw, where the first prickles of his beard begin to show.Infatuation.It was common, among the nurses and the doctors, the nurses and the patients, among any gathering of people thrown for long periods into one anothers company.Some acted on it, and brief, intense affairs were frequent.If they were lucky, the affair flamed out within a few months and nothing resulted from it.If they were notwell.Pregnancy, divorce, here and there the odd case of venereal disease.Dangerous thing, infatuation.I had felt it, several times, but had had the good sense not to act on it.And as it always does, after a time the attraction had lessened, and the man lost his golden aura and resumed his usual place in my life, with no harm done to him, to me, or to Frank.And now.Now I had been forced to act on it.And God only knew what harm might be done by that action.But there was no turning back from this point.He lay at ease, sprawled on his stomach.The sun glinted off his red mane and lit the tiny soft hairs that crested his spine, running down to the reddish gold fuzz that dusted his buttocks and thighs, and deepened into the thicket of soft auburn curls that showed briefly between his spread legs.I sat up, admiring the long legs, with the smooth line of muscling that indented the thigh from hip to knee, and another that ran from knee to long, elegant foot.The bottoms of his feet were smooth and pink, slightly callused from going barefoot.My fingers ached, wantingto trace the line of his small, neat ear and the blunt angle of his jaw.Well, I thought, the action had been taken, and it was far past the time for restraint.Nothing I did now could make matters worse, for either of us.I reached out and gently touched him.He slept very lightly.With a suddenness that made me jump, he flipped over, bracing himself on his elbows as though to leap to his feet.Seeing me, he relaxed, smiling.Madam, you have me at a disadvantage.He made a very creditable courtly bow, for a man stretched at full length in a patch of ferns, wearing nothing but a few dappled splotches of sunlight, and I laughed.The smile stayed on his face, but it altered as he looked at me, naked in the ferns.His voice was suddenly husky.In fact, Madam, you have me at your mercy.Have I, then?I said softly.He didnt move, as I reached out once more and drew my hand slowly down his cheek and neck, over the gleaming slope of his shoulder, and down.He didnt move, but he closed his eyes.Dear Holy Lord, he said.He drew his breath in sharply.Dont worry, I said.It doesnt have to be rough.Thank God for small mercies.Keep still.His fingers dug deeply into the crumbling earth, but he obeyed.Please, he said after a time.Glancing up, I could see that his eyes were open now.No, I said, enjoying myself.He closed his eyes again.Youll pay for this, he said a short time later.A fine dew of sweat shone on the straight bridge of his nose.Really?I said.What are you going to do?The tendons stood out in his forearms as he pressed his palms against the earth, and he spoke with an effort, as though his teeth were clenched.I dont know, butby Christ and St.AgnesI willth think of s something!God!Please!All right, I said, releasing him.And I uttered a small shriek as he rolled onto me, pinning me against the ferns.Your turn, he said, with considerable satisfaction.* * *    We returned to the inn at sunset, pausing at the top of the hill to be sure that the horses of the Watch were no longer hobbled outside.The inn looked welcoming, light already shining through the small windows, and through the chinks in the walls.The last of the sun glowed behind us as well, so that everything on the hillside threw a double shadow.The breeze rose with the cooling of the day, and the fluttering leaves of the trees made the multiple shadows dance on the grass.I could easily imagine that there were fairies on the hill, dancing with those shadows, threading their way through the slender trunks to blend into the depths of the wood.Dougals not back yet, either, I observed as we came down the hill.The large black gelding he customarily rode was not in the inns small paddock.Several other beasts were missing as well; Ned Gowans for one.No, he shouldna come back for another day at leastmaybe two.Jamie offered me his arm and we descended the hill slowly, careful of the many rocks that poked through the short grass.Where on earth has he gone?Caught in the rush of recent events, I had not thought to question his absenceor even to notice it.Jamie handed me over the stile at the back of the inn.To do his business wi the cottars nearby.Hes got but a day or two before hes supposed to produce you at the Fort, ye ken.He squeezed my arm reassuringly.Captain Randall willna be best pleased when Dougal tells him hes not to have ye, and Dougal would as soon not linger in the area afterward.Sensible of him, I observed.Also kind of him to leave us here to, erget acquainted with each other.Jamie snorted.Not kindness.That was one of the conditions I set for takin ye.I said Id wed if I must, but damned if Id consummate my marriage under a bush, wi twenty clansmen lookin on and offering advice.I stopped, staring at him.So that was what the shouting had been about.One of the conditions?I said, slowly.And what were the others?It was growing too dark to see his face clearly, but I thought he seemed embarrassed.Only two others, he said finally.Which were?Well, he said, kicking a pebble diffidently out of the way, I said ye must wed me proper, in kirk, before a priest.Not just by contract.As for the otherhe must find ye a suitable gown to be wed in.He looked away, avoiding my gaze, and his voice was so soft I could scarcely hear him.II knew ye didna wish to wed.I wanted to make itas pleasant as might be for you.I thought ye might feel a bit lesswell, I wanted ye to have a decent dress, is all.I opened my mouth to say something, but he turned away, toward the inn.Come along, Sassenach, he said gruffly.Im hungry.* * *    The price of food was company, as was obvious from the moment of our appearance at the door of the inns main room.We were greeted by raucous cheers, and hurriedly pushed into seats at the table, where a hearty supper was already in progress.Having been somewhat prepared this time, I didnt mind the rough jests and crude remarks at our expense.For once, I was pleased to be modestly self effacing, scrunching back into the corner and leaving Jamie to deal with the rough teasing and bawdy speculations about what we had been doing all day.Sleeping, said Jamie, in answer to one question of this sort.Didna catch a wink last night.The roars of laughter that greeted this were topped by louder ones as he added in confidential tones, She snores, ye ken.I obligingly cuffed his ear, and he gathered me to him and kissed me soundly, to general applause.After supper there was dancing, to the accompaniment of the landlords fiddle.I had never been much of a dancer, being rather prone to trip over my own feet in times of stress.I scarcely expected that I would do better, attired in long skirts and clumsy footgear.Once I had shed the clogs, though, I was surprised to find that I danced with no difficulty and great enjoyment.Women being in short supply, the innkeepers wife and I tucked up our skirts and danced jigs and reels and strathspeys without ceasing, until I had to stop and lean against the settle, red faced and gasping for breath.The men were absolutely indefatigable, whirling about like plaid tops, by themselves or with each other.Finally, they stood back against the wall, watching, cheering and clapping, as Jamie took both my hands and led me through something fast and frantic called The Cock o the North.Ending up by forethought near the stair, we swirled to a close with his arm about my waist.Here we paused, and he made a short speech, mixed in Gaelic and English, which was received with further applause, particularly when he reached into his sporran and tossed a small wash leather bag to the landlord, instructing that worthy to serve whisky so long as it lasted.I recognized it as his share of the wagers from his fight at Tunnaig.Likely all the money he had in the world; I thought it could not have been better spent.We had made it up to the balcony, followed by a hail of indelicate good wishes, when a voice louder than the others called Jamies name.Turning, I saw Ruperts broad face, redder than usual above its bush of black beard, grinning up from below.No good, Rupert, called Jamie.Shes mine.Wasted on ye, lad, said Rupert, mopping his face with his sleeve.Shell haye on the floor in an hour.No stayin power, these young lads, he called to me.Ye want a man who doesna waste his time sleepin, lass, let me know.In the meantime He flung something upward.A fat little bag clanked on the floor at my feet.A wedding present, he called.Courtesy of the men of the Shimi Bogil Watch.Eh?Jamie stooped to pick it up.Some of us dinna spend our day idlin about the grassy banks, lad, he said reprovingly, rolling his eyes lewdly at me.That money was hard earned.Oh, aye, said Jamie, grinning.Dice or cards?Both.A raffish grin split the black beard.Skint em to the bone, lad.To the bone!Jamie opened his mouth, but Rupert held up a broad, callused palm.Nay, lad, nay need o thanks.Just give her a good one for me, eh?I pressed my fingers to my lips and blew him a kiss.Slapping a hand to his face as though struck, he staggered back with an exclamation and reeled off into the taproom, weaving as though drunk, which he wasnt.After all the hilarity below, the room seemed a haven of peace and quiet.Jamie, still laughing quietly to himself, sprawled out on the bed to recover his breath.I loosened my bodice, which was uncomfortably tight, and sat down to comb the tangles out of my dance disordered hair.Youve the loveliest hair, said Jamie, watching me.What?This?I raised a hand self consciously to my locks, which as usual, could be politely described as higgledy piggledy.He laughed.Well, I like the other too, he said, deliberately straightfaced, but yes, I meant that.But its socurly, I said, blushing a little.Aye, of course.He looked surprised.I heard one of Dougals girls say to a friend at the Castle that it would take three hours with the hot tongs to make hers look like that.She said shed like to scratch your eyes out for looking like that and not lifting a hand to do so.He sat up and tugged gently on one curl, stretching it down so that, uncurled, it reached nearly to my breast.My sister Jennys hair is curly, too, but not so much as yours.Is your sisters hair red, like yours?I asked, trying to envision what the mysterious Jenny might look like.She seemed to be often in Jamies mind.He shook his head, still twisting curls in and out between his fingers.No.Jennys hair is black.Black as night.Im red like my mother, and Jenny takes after Father.Brian Dhu, they called him, Black Brian, for his hair and his beard.Ive heard that Captain Randall is called Black Jack,  I ventured.Jamie laughed humorlessly.Oh, aye.But thats with reference to the color of his soul, not his hair.His gaze sharpened as he looked down at me.Youre not worrying about him, are ye, lass?Ye shouldna do so.His hands left my hair and tightened possessively on my shoulders.I meant it, ye know, he said softly.I will protect you.From him, or anyone else.To the last drop of my blood, mo duinne.Mo duinne?I asked, a little disturbed by the intensity of this speech.I didnt want to be responsible for any of his blood being spilt, last drop or first.It means my brown one.He raised a lock of hair to his lips and smiled, with a look in his eyes that started all the drops of my own blood chasing each other through my veins.Mo duinne, he repeated, softly.I have been longing to say that to you.Rather a dull color, brown, Ive always thought, I said practically, trying to delay things a bit.I kept having the feeling of being whirled along much faster than I intended.Jamie shook his head, still smiling.No, Id not say that, Sassenach.Not dull at all.He lifted the mass of my hair with both hands and fanned it out.Its like the water in a burn, where it ruffles over the stones.Dark in the wavy spots, with bits of silver on the surface where the sun catches it.Nervous and a little breathless, I pulled away in order to pick up the comb I had dropped on the floor.I came up to find Jamie eyeing me steadily.I said I wouldna ask for anything you did not wish to tell me, he said, and I wont, but I draw my own conclusions.Colum thought perhaps you were an English spy, though he couldna imagine in that case why youd no Gaelic.Dougal thinks youre likely a French spy, maybe looking for support for King James.But in that case, he canna imagine why you were alone.And what about you?I asked, pulling hard at a stubborn tangle.What do you think I am?He tilted his head appraisingly, looking me over carefully.To look at, you could be French.Youve that fine boned look through the face that some of the Angevin ladies have.Frenchwomen are usually sallow faced, though, and you have skin like an opal.He traced a finger slowly across the curve of my collarbone, and I felt the skin glow beneath his touch.The finger moved to my face, drawing from temple to cheek, smoothing the hair back behind my ear.I remained immobile under his scrutiny, trying not to move as his hand passed behind my neck, thumb gently stroking my earlobe.Golden eyes; Ive seen a pair like that once beforeon a leopard.He shook his head.Nay, lass.Ye could be French, but youre not.How do you know?Ive talked with you a good deal; and listened to you besides.Dougal thinks youre French because you speak French wellverra well.Thank you, I said sarcastically.And the fact that I speak French well proves Im not French?He smiled and tightened his grip on my neck.Vous parlez trs bienbut not quite as well as I do, he added, dropping back into English.He released me suddenly.I spent a year in France, after I left the castle, and two more later on with the army.I know a native speaker of French when I hear one.And French is not your mother tongue.He shook his head slowly.Spanish?Perhaps, but why?Spains no interests in the Highlands.German?Surely not.He shrugged.Whoever you are, the English would want to find out.They canna afford to have unknown quantities at large, with the clans restless and Prince Charlie waiting to set sail from France.And their methods of finding out are not very gentle.Ive reason to know.And how do you know Im not an English spy, then?Dougal thought I was, you said so.Its possible, though your spoken English is more than a little odd too.If you were, though, why would you choose to wed me, rather than go back to your own folk?That was another reason for Dougals makin ye wed meto see would ye bolt last night, when it came to the point.And I didnt bolt.So what does that prove?He laughed and lay back down on the bed, an arm over his eyes to shield them from the lamp.Damned if I know, Sassenach.Damned if I know.There isna any reason able explanation I can think of for you.You might be one of the Wee Folk, for all I knowhe peeked sideways from under his armno, I suppose not.Youre too big.Arent you afraid.I might kill you in your sleep some night, if you dont know who I am?He didnt answer, but took his arm away from his eyes, and his smile widened.His eyes must be from the Fraser side, I thought.Not deepset like the MacKenzies, they were set at an odd angle, so that the high cheekbones made them look almost slanted.Without troubling to lift his head, he opened the front of his shirt and spread the cloth aside, laying his chest bare to the waist.He drew the dirk from its sheath and tossed it toward me.It thunked on the boards at my feet.He put his arm back over his eyes and stretched his head back, showing the place where the dark stubble of his sprouting beard stopped abruptly, just below the jaw.Straight up, just under the breastbone, he advised.Quick and neat, though it takes a bit of strength.The throat cuttings easier, but its verra messy.I bent to pick up the dirk.Serve you right if I did, I remarked.Cocky bastard.The grin visible beneath the crook of his arm widened still further.Sassenach?I stopped, dirk still in my hand.What?Ill die a happy man.17    WE MEET A BEGGAR    We slept fairly late the next morning, and the sun was high as we left the inn, heading south this time.Most of the horses were gone from the paddock, and none of the men from our party seemed to be about.I wondered aloud where they had gone.Jamie grinned.I canna say for sure, but I could guess.The Watch went that way yesterdayhe pointed westso I should say Rupert and the others have gone that way.Pointing east.Cattle, he explained, seeing that I still didnt understand.The estate holders and tacksmen pay the Watch to keep an eye out, and get back their cattle, if theyre stolen in a raid.But if the Watch is riding west toward Lag Cruime, any herds to the east are helplessfor a bit, anyway.Its the Grants lands down that way, and Ruperts one of the best cattle lifters Ive ever seen.Beasts will follow him anywhere, wi scarcely a bleat amongst them.And since theres no more entertainment to be had here, most likely hes got restless.Jamie himself seemed rather restless, and set a good pace.There was a deer trail through the heather, and the going was fairly easy, so I kept up with no difficulty.After a bit, we came out onto a stretch of moorland, where we could walk side by side.What about Horrocks?I asked suddenly.Hearing him mention the town of Lag Cruime, I had remembered the English deserter and his possible news.You were supposed to meet him in Lag Cruime, werent you?He nodded.Aye.But I canna go there now, wi both Randall and the Watch headed that way.Too dangerous.Could someone go for you?Or do you trust anyone enough?He glanced down at me and smiled.Well, theres you.Since ye didna kill me last night after all, I suppose I may trust you.But Im afraid you couldna go to Lag Cruime alone.No, if necessary, Murtagh will go for me.But I may be able to arrange something elsewell see.You trust Murtagh?I asked curiously.I had no very friendly feelings toward the scruffy little man, since he was more or less responsible for my present predicament, having kidnapped me in the first place.Still, there was clearly a friendship of some kind between him and Jamie.Oh, aye.He glanced at me, surprised.Murtaghs known me all my lifea second cousin of my fathers, I think.His father was my  Hes a Fraser, you mean, I interrupted hastily.I thought he was one of the MacKenzies.He was with Dougal when I met you.Jamie nodded.Aye.When I decided to come over from France I sent word to him, asking him to meet me at the coast.He smiled wryly.I didna ken, ye see, whether it was Dougal had tried to kill me earlier.And I did not quite like the idea of meeting several MacKenzies alone, just in case.Didna want to end up washing about in the surf off Skye, if thats what they had in mind.I see.So Dougal isnt the only one who believes in witnesses.He nodded.Very handy things, witnesses.On the other side of the moorland was a stretch of twisted rocks, pitted and gouged by the advance and retreat of glaciers long gone.Rainwater filled the deeper pits, and thistle and tansy and meadowsweet surrounded these tarns with thick growth, the flowers reflected in the still water.Sterile and fishless, these pools dotted the landscape and formed traps for unwary travelers, who might easily stumble into one in darkness and be forced to spend a wet and uncomfortable night on the moor.We sat down beside one pool to eat our morning meal of bread and cheese.This tarn at least had birds; swallows dipped low over the water to drink, and plovers and curlews poked long bills into the muddy earth at its edges, digging for insects.I tossed crumbs of bread onto the mud for the birds.A curlew eyed one suspiciously, but while it was still making up its mind, a quick swallow zoomed in under its bill and made off with the treat.The curlew ruffled its feathers and went back to its industrious digging.Jamie called my attention to a plover, calling and dragging a seemingly broken wing near us.Shes a nest somewhere near, I said.Over there.He had to point it out several times before I finally spotted it; a shallow depression, quite out in the open, but with its four spotted eggs so close in appearance to the leaf speckled bank that when I blinked I lost sight of the nest again.Picking up a stick, Jamie gently poked the nest, pushing one egg out of place.The mother plover, excited, ran up almost in front of him.He sat on his heels, quite motionless, letting the bird dart back and forth, squalling.There was a flash of movement and he held the bird in his hand, suddenly still.He spoke to the bird in Gaelic, a quiet, hissing sort of speech, as he stroked the soft mottled plumage with one finger.The bird crouched in his hand, completely motionless, even the reflections frozen in its round black eyes.He set it gently on the ground, but the bird did not move away until he said a few more words, and waved his hand slowly back and forth behind it.It gave a short jerk and darted away into the weeds.He watched it go, and, quite unconscious, crossed himself.Why did you do that?I asked, curious.What?He was momentarily startled; I think he had forgotten I was there.You crossed yourself when the bird flew off; I wondered why.He shrugged, mildly embarrassed.Ah, well.Its an old tale, is all.Why plovers cry as they do, and run keening about their nests like that.He motioned to the far side of the tarn, where another plover was doing exactly that.He watched the bird for a few moments, abstracted.Plovers have the souls of young mothers dead in childbirth, he said.He glanced aside at me, shyly.The story goes that they cry and run about their nests because they canna believe the young are safe hatched; theyre mourning always for the lost oneor looking for a child left behind.He squatted by the nest and nudged the oblong egg with his stick, turning it bit by bit until the pointed end faced in, like the others.He stayed squatting, even after the egg had been replaced, balancing the stick across his thighs, staring out over the still waters of the tarn.Its only habit, I suppose, he said.I did it first when I was much younger, when I first heard that story.I didna really believe they have souls, of course, even then, but, ye ken, just as a bit of respect He looked up at me and smiled suddenly.Done it so often now, Id not even notice.Theres quite a few plovers in Scotland, ye ken.He rose and tossed the stick aside.Lets go on, now; theres a place I want to show you, near the top of the hill yon.He took my elbow to help me out of the declivity, and we set off up the slope.I had heard what he said to the plover he released.Though I had only a few words of Gaelic, I had heard the old salutation often enough to be familiar with it.God go with ye, Mother, he had said.A young mother, dead in childbirth.And a child left behind.I touched his arm and he looked down at me.How old were you?I asked.He gave me a half smile.Eight, he answered.Weaned, at least.He spoke no more, but led me uphill.We were in sloping foothills, now, thick with heather.Just beyond, the countryside changed abruptly, with huge heaps of granite rearing up from the earth, surrounded by clusters of sycamore and larch.We came over the crest of the hill, and left the plovers crying by the tarns behind us.* * *    The sun was growing hot, and after an hour of shoving through thick foliageeven with Jamie doing most of the shovingI was ready for a rest.We found a shady spot at the foot of one of the granite outcrops.The spot reminded me a bit of the place where I had first met Murtaghand parted company with Captain Randall.Still, it was pleasant here.Jamie told me that we were alone, because of the constant birdsong all around.If anyone came near, most birds would stop singing, though the jays and the jackdaws would screech and call in alarm.Always hide in a forest, Sassenach, he advised me.If ye dinna move too much yourself, the birds will tell you in plenty of time if anyones near.Looking back from pointing out a squawking jay in the tree overhead, his eyes caught mine.And we sat as though frozen, within hands reach but not touching, barely breathing.After a time, the jay grew bored with us and left.It was Jamie who looked away first, with an almost imperceptible shiver, as though he were cold.The heads of shaggy cap mushrooms poked whitely through the mold beneath the ferns.Jamies blunt forefinger flipped one off its stem, and traced the spokes of the basidium as he marshaled his next words.When he spoke carefully, as now, he all but lost the slight Scots accent that usually marked his speech.I do not wish tothat is.I do not mean to imply.He looked up suddenly and smiled, with a helpless gesture.I dinna want to insult you by sounding as though I think youve a vast experience of men, is all.But it would be foolish to pretend that ye dont know more than I do about such matters.What I meant to ask is, is thisusual?What it is between us, when I touch you, when youlie with me?Is it always so between a man and a woman?In spite of his difficulties, I knew exactly what he meant.His gaze was direct, holding my eyes as he waited my answer.I wanted to look away, but couldnt.Theres often something like it, I said, and had to stop and clear my throat.But no.No, it isntusual.I have no idea why, but no.This isdifferent.He relaxed a bit, as though I had confirmed something about which he had been anxious.I thought perhaps not.Ive not lain with a woman before, but Iveah, had my hands on a few.He smiled shyly, and shook his head.It wasna the same.I mean, Ive held women in my arms before, and kissed them, andwell.He waved a hand, dismissing the and.It was verra pleasant indeed.Made my heart pound and my breath come short, and all that.But it wasna at all as it is when I take you in my arms and kiss you.His eyes, I thought, were the color of lakes and skies, and as fathomless as either.He reached out and touched my lower lip, barely brushing the edge.It starts out the same, but then, after a moment, he said, speaking softly, suddenly its as though Ive a living flame in my arms.His touch grew firmer, outlining my lips and caressing the line of my jaw.And I want only to throw myself into it and be consumed.I thought of telling him that his own touch seared my skin and filled my veins with fire.But I was already alight and glowing like a brand.I closed my eyes and felt the kindling touch move to cheek and temple, ear and neck, and shuddered as his hands dropped to my waist and drew me close.* * *    Jamie seemed to have a definite idea where we were going.At length he stopped at the foot of a huge rock, some twenty feet high, warty with lumps and jagged cracks.Tansy and eglantine had taken root in the cracks, and waved in precarious yellow flags against the stone.He took my hand and nodded at the rock face before us.Dye see the steps, there, Sassenach?Think ye can manage it?There were, in fact, faintly marked protuberances in the stone, rising at an angle across the face of the rock.Some were bona fide ledges, and others merely a foothold for lichens.I couldnt tell whether they were natural, or perhaps had known some assistance in their forming, but I thought it might just be possible to climb them, even in a full length skirt and tight bodice.With some slippages and scares, and with Jamie pushing helpfully from the rear on occasion, I made it to the top of the rock, and paused to look around.The view was spectacular.The dark bulk of a mountain rose to the east, while far below to the south the foothills ran out into a vast, barren moorland.The top of the rock sloped inward from all sides, forming a shallow dish.In the center of the dish was a blackened circle, with the sooty remnants of charred sticks.We were not the first visitors, then.You knew this place?Jamie stood to one side a little, observing me and taking pleasure in my raptness.He shrugged, deprecating.Oh, aye.I know most places through this part of the Highlands.Come here, theres a spot ye can sit, and see down to where the road comes past the hill.The inn also was visible from here, reduced from doll house to childs building block by the distance.A few tethered horses were clustered under the trees by the road, small blobs of brown and black from here.No trees grew on the top of the rock, and the sun was hot on my back.We sat side by side, legs dangling over the edge, and companionably shared one of the bottles of ale that Jamie had thoughtfully lifted from the well in the inn yard as we left.There were no trees atop the rock, but the smaller plants, the ones that could gain a foothold in the precarious cracks and root themselves in meager soil, sprouted here and there, raising their faces bravely to the hot spring sun.There was a small clump of daisies sheltering in the lee of an outcrop near my hand, and I reached to pluck one.There was a faint whir, and the daisy leaped off its stem and landed on my knee.I stared stupidly, my mind unable to make sense of this bizarre behavior.Jamie, a good deal faster than I in his apprehensions, had flung himself flat on the rock.Get down!he said.A large hand fastened on my elbow and jerked me flat beside him.As I hit the spongy moss, I saw the shaft of the arrow, still quivering above my face, where it had struck home in a cleft of the outcrop.I froze, afraid even to look around, and tried to press myself still flatter against the ground.Jamie was motionless at my side, so still that he might have been a stone himself.Even the birds and insects seemed to have paused in their song, and the air hung breathless and waiting.Suddenly Jamie began to laugh.He sat up, and grasping the arrow by the shaft, twisted it carefully out of the rock.It was fletched with the split tail feathers of a woodpecker, I saw, and banded with blue thread, wrapped in a line half an inch wide below the quills.Laying the arrow aside, Jamie cupped his hands around his mouth and gave a remarkably good imitation of the call of a green woodpecker.He lowered his hands and waited.In a moment, the call was answered from the grove below, and a broad smile spread across his face.A friend of yours?I guessed.He nodded, eyes intent on the narrow path up the rock face.Hugh Munro, unless someone else has taken to making arrows in his style.We waited a moment longer, but no one appeared on the path below.Ah, said Jamie softly, and whirled around, just in time to confront a head, rising slowly above the edge of the rock behind us.The head burst into a jack o lantern grin, snaggle toothed and jolly, beaming with pleasure at surprising us.The head itself was roughly pumpkin shaped, the impression enhanced by the orange brown, leathery skin that covered not only the face but the round, bald crown of the head as well.Few pumpkins, however, could boast such a luxuriant growth of beard, nor such a pair of bright blue eyes.Stubby hands with filthy nails planted themselves beneath the beard and swiftly hoisted the remainder of the jack o lantern up into view.The body rather matched the head, having a distinct look of the Halloween goblin about it.The shoulders were very broad, but hunched and slanted, one being considerably higher than the other.One leg, too, seemed somewhat shorter than its fellow, giving the man a rather hopping, hitching sort of gait.Munro, if this was indeed Jamies friend, was clad in what appeared to be multiple layers of rags, the faded colors of berry dyed fabric peeking out through rents in a shapeless garment that might once have been a womans smock.He carried no sporran at his beltwhich was in any case no more than a frayed length of rope, from which two furry carcasses swung, head down.Instead, he had a fat leather wallet slung across his chest, of surprisingly good quality, considering the rest of his outfit.A collection of small metal oddments dangled from the strap of the wallet: religious medals, military decorations, what looked to be old uniform buttons, worn coins, pierced and sewn on, and three or four small rectangular bits of metal, dull grey and with cryptic marks incised in their surfaces.Jamie rose as the creature hopped nimbly over the intervening protrusions of rock, and the two men embraced warmly, thumping each other hard on the back in the odd fashion of manly greeting.And how goes it then, with the house of Munro?inquired Jamie, standing back at length and surveying his old companion.Munro ducked his head and made an odd gobbling noise, grinning.Then, raising his eyebrows, he nodded in my direction and waved his stubby hands in a strangely graceful interrogatory gesture.My wife, said Jamie, reddening slightly with a mixture of shyness and pride at the new introduction.Married but the two days.Munro smiled more broadly still at this information, and executed a remarkably complex and graceful bow, involving the rapid touching of head, heart, and lips and ending up in a near horizontal position on the ground at my feet.Having executed this striking maneuver, he sprang to his feet with the grace of an acrobat and thumped Jamie again, this time in apparent congratulation.Munro then began an extraordinary ballet of the hands, motioning to himself, away down toward the forest, at me, and back to himself, with such an array of gestures and wavings that I could hardly follow his flying hands.I had seen deaf mute talk before, but never executed so swiftly and gracefully.Is that so, then?Jamie exclaimed.It was his turn to buffet the other man in congratulation.No wonder men got impervious to superficial pain, I thought.It came from this habit of hammering each other incessantly.Hes married as well, Jamie explained, turning to me.Six months since, to a widowoh, all right, to a fat widow, he amended, in response to an emphatic gesture from Munro, with six children, down in the village of Dubhlairn.How nice, I said politely.It looks as though theyll eat well, at least.I motioned to the rabbits hanging from his belt.Munro at once unfastened one of the corpses and handed it to me, with such an expression of beaming goodwill that I felt obliged to accept it, smiling back and hoping privately that it didnt harbor fleas.A wedding gift, said Jamie.And most welcome, Munro.Ye must allow us to return the favor.With which, he extracted one of the bottles of ale from its mossy bed and handed it across.The courtesies attended to in this manner, we all sat down again to a companionable sharing of the third bottle.Jamie and Munro carried on an exchange of news, gossip, and conversation which seemed no less free for the fact that only one of them spoke.I took little part in the conversation, being unable to read Munros hand signs, though Jamie did his best to include me by translation and reference.At one point, Jamie jabbed a thumb at the rectangular bits of lead that adorned Munros strap.Gone official, have ye?he asked.Or is that just for when the game is scarce?Munro bobbed his head and nodded like a jack in the box.What are they?I asked curiously.Gaberlunzies.Oh, to be sure, I said.Pardon my asking.A gaberlunzie is a license to beg, Sassenach, Jamie explained.Its good within the borders of the parish, and only on the one day a week when beggings allowed.Each parish has its own, so the beggars from one parish canna take overmuch advantage of the charity of the next.A system with a certain amount of elasticity, I see, I said, eyeing Munros stock of four lead seals.Ah, well, Munros a special case, dye see.He was captured by the Turks at sea.Spent a good many years rowing up and down in a galley, and a few more as a slave in Algiers.Thats where he lost his tongue.Theycut it out?I felt a bit faint.Jamie seemed undisturbed by the thought, but then he had apparently known Munro for some time.Oh, aye.And broke his leg for him, as well.The back, too, Munro?No, he amended, at a series of signs from Munro, the back was an accident, something that happened jumping off a wall in Alexandria.The feet, though; that was the Turks doing.I didnt really want to know, but both Munro and Jamie seemed dying to tell me.All right, I said, resigned.What happened to his feet?With something approaching pride, Munro stripped off his battered clogs and hose, exposing broad, splayed feet on which the skin was thickened and roughened, white shiny patches alternating with angry red areas.Boiling oil, said Jamie.Its how they force captive Christians to convert to the Mussulman religion.It looks a very effective means of persuasion, I said.So thats why several parishes will give him leave to beg?To make up for his trials on behalf of Christendom?Aye, exactly.Jamie was evidently pleased with my swift appreciation of the situation.Munro also expressed his admiration with another deep salaam, followed by a very expressive if indelicate sequence of hand movements which I gathered were meant to be praising my physical appearance as well.Thank ye, man.Aye, shell do me proud, I reckon.Jamie, seeing my uplifted brows, tactfully turned Munro so that his back was to me and the flying fingers hidden.Now, tell me whats doing in the villages?The two men drew closer together, continuing their lopsided conversation with an increased intensity.Since Jamies part seemed to be limited mainly to grunts and exclamations of interest, I could glean little of the content, and busied myself instead with a survey of the strange little rock plants sprouting from the surfaces of our perch.I had collected a pocketful of eyebright and dittany by the time they finished talking and Hugh Munro rose to go.With a final bow to me and a thump on the back for Jamie, he shuffled to the edge of the rock and disappeared as quickly as one of the rabbits he poached might vanish into its hole.What fascinating friends you have, I said.Oh, aye.Nice fellow, Hugh.I hunted wi him and some others, last year.Hes on his own, now that hes an official beggar, but his work keeps him moving about the parishes; hell know everything that goes on within the borders of Ardagh and Chesthill.Including the whereabouts of Horrocks?I guessed.Jamie nodded.Aye.And hell carry a message for me, to change the meeting place.Which foxes Dougal rather neatly, I observed.If he had any ideas about holding you to ransom over Horrocks.He nodded, and a smile creased one corner of his mouth.Aye, theres that about it.* * *    It was near supper time again as we reached the inn.This time, though, Dougals big black and its five companions were standing in the inn yard, contentedly munching hay.Dougal himself was inside, washing the road dust from his throat with sour ale.He nodded to me and swung round to greet his nephew.Instead of speaking, though, he just stood there, head on one side, eyeing Jamie quizzically.Ah, thats it, he said finally, in the satisfied tones of a man who has solved a difficult puzzle.Now I know what ye mind me of, lad.He turned to me.Ever seen a red stag near the end of the rutting season, lass?he said confidentially.The poor beasts dinna sleep nor eat for several weeks, because they canna spare the time, between fightin off the other stags and serving the does.By the end o the season, theyre naught but skin and bones.Their eyes are deep sunk in their heads, and the only part o them that doesna shake wi palsy is their  The last of this was lost in a chorus of laughter as Jamie pulled me up the stairs.We did not come down to supper.* * *    Much later, on the edge of sleep, I felt Jamies arm around my waist, and felt his breath warm against my neck.Does it ever stop?The wanting you?His hand came around to caress my breast.Even when Ive just left ye, I want you so much my chest feels tight and my fingers ache with wanting to touch ye again.He cupped my face in the dark, thumbs stroking the arcs of my eyebrows.When I hold ye between my two hands and feel you quiver like that, waitin for me to take youLord, I want to pleasure you til ye cry out under me and open yourself to me.And when I take my own pleasure from you, I feel as though Ive given ye my soul along with my cock.He rolled above me and I opened my legs, wincing slightly as he entered me.He laughed softly.Aye, Im a bit sore, too.Do ye want me to stop?I wrapped my legs around his hips in answer and pulled him closer.Would you stop?I asked.No.I cant.We laughed together, and rocked slowly, lips and fingers exploring in the dark.I see why the Church says it is a sacrament, Jamie said dreamily.This?I said, startled.Why?Or at least holy, he said.I feel like God himself when Im in you.I laughed so hard he nearly came out.He stopped and gripped my shoulders to steady me.Whats so funny?Its hard to imagine God doing this.Jamie resumed his movements.Well, if God made man in His own image, I should imagine Hes got a cock.He started to laugh as well, losing his rhythm again.Though ye dinna remind me much of the Blessed Virgin, Sassenach.We shook in each others arms, laughing until we came uncoupled and rolled apart.Recovering, Jamie slapped my hip.Get on your knees, Sassenach.Why?If youll not let me be spiritual about it, youll have to put up wi my baser nature.Im going to be a beast.He bit my neck.Do ye want me to be a horse, a bear, or a dog?A hedgehog.A hedgehog?And just how does a hedgehog make love?he demanded.No, I thought.I wont.I will not.But I did.Very carefully, I replied, giggling helplessly.So now we know just how old that one is, I thought.Jamie collapsed in a ball, wheezing with laughter.At last he rolled over and got to his knees, groping for the flint box on the table.He glowed like red amber against the rooms darkness as the wick caught and the light swelled behind him.He flopped back on the foot of the bed, grinning down at me, where I still shook on the pillow with spasms of giggles.He rubbed the back of his hand across his face and assumed a mock stern expression.All right, woman.I see the time has come when I shall have to exert my authority as your husband.Oh, you will?Aye.He dived forward, grabbing my thighs and spreading them.I squeaked and tried to wriggle upward.No, dont do that!Why not?He lay full length between my legs, squinting up at me.He kept a firm hold on my thighs, preventing my struggles to close them.Tell me, Sassenach.Why dont ye want me to do that?He rubbed his cheek against the inside of one thigh, ferocious young beard rasping the tender skin.Be honest.Why not?He rasped the other side, making me kick and squirm wildly to get away, to no avail.I turned my face into the pillow, which felt cool against my flushed cheek.Well, if you must know, I muttered, I dont thinkwell, Im afraid that it doesntI mean, the smell My voice faded off into an embarrassed silence.There was a sudden movement between my legs, as Jamie heaved himself up.He put his arms around my hips, laid his cheek on my thigh, and laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks.Jesus God, Sassenach, he said at last, snorting with mirth, dont ye know whats the first thing you do when youre getting acquainted with a new horse?No, I said, completely baffled.He raised one arm, displaying a soft tuft of cinnamon colored hair.You rub your oxter over the beasts nose a few times, to give him your scent and get him accustomed to you, so he wont be nervous of ye.He raised himself on his elbows, peering up over the slope of belly and breast.Thats what you should have done wi me, Sassenach.You should ha rubbed my face between your legs first thing.Then I wouldnt have been skittish.Skittish!He lowered his face and rubbed it deliberately back and forth, snorting and blowing in imitation of a nuzzling horse.I writhed and kicked him in the ribs, with exactly as much effect as kicking a brick wall.Finally he pressed my thighs flat again and looked up.Now, he said, in a tone that brooked no opposition, lie still.I felt exposed, invaded, helplessand as though I were about to disintegrate.Jamies breath was alternately warm and cool on my skin.Please, I said, not knowing whether I meant please stop or please go on.It didnt matter; he didnt mean to stop.Consciousness fragmented into a number of small separate sensations: the roughness of the linen pillow, nubbled with embroidered flowers; the oily reek of the lamp, mingled with the fainter scent of roast beef and ale and the still fainter wisps of freshness from the wilting flowers in the glass; the cool timber of the wall against my left foot, the firm hands on my hips.The sensations swirled and coalesced behind my closed eyelids into a glowing sun that swelled and shrank and finally exploded with a soundless pop that left me in a warm and pulsing darkness.Dimly, from a long way away, I heard Jamie sit up.Well, thats a bit better, said a voice, gasping between words.Takes a bit of effort to make you properly submissive, doesnt it?The bed creaked with a shifting of weight and I felt my knees being nudged further apart.Not as dead as you look, I hope?said the voice, coming nearer.I arched upward with an inarticulate sound as exquisitely sensitive tissues were firmly parted in a fresh assault.Jesus Christ, I said.There was a faint chuckle near my ear.I only said I felt like God, Sassenach, he murmured, I never said I was.And later, as the rising sun began to dim the glow of the lamp, I roused from a drifting sleep to hear Jamie murmur once more, Does it ever stop, Claire?The wanting?My head fell back onto his shoulder.I dont know, Jamie.I really dont.18    RAIDERS IN THE ROCKS    What did Captain Randall say?I asked.With Dougal on one side and Jamie on the other, there was barely room for the three horses to ride abreast down the narrow road.Here and there, one or both of my companions would have to drop back or spur up, in order to avoid becoming entangled in the overgrowth that threatened to reclaim the crude track.Dougal glanced at me, then back at the road, in order to guide his horse around a large rock.A wicked grin spread slowly across his features.He wasna best pleased about it, he said circumspectly.Though I am not sure I should tell ye what he actually said; theres likely limits even to your tolerance for bad language, Mistress Fraser.I overlooked his sardonic use of my new title, as well as the implied insult, though I saw Jamie stiffen in his saddle.I, er, dont suppose he means to take any steps about it?I asked.Despite Jamies assurances, I had visions of scarlet coated dragoons bursting out of the bushes, slaughtering the Scots and dragging me away to Randalls lair for questioning.I had an uneasy feeling that Randalls ideas of interrogation might be creative, to say the least.Shouldnt think so, Dougal answered casually.Hes more to worry about than one stray Sassenach wench, no matter how pretty.He raised an eyebrow and half bowed toward me, as though the compliment were meant in apology.Hes also better sense than to rile Colum by kidnapping his niece, he said, more matter of factly.Niece.I felt a small shiver run down my spine, in spite of the warm weather.Niece to the MacKenzie chieftain.Not to mention to the war chieftain of clan MacKenzie, riding so nonchalantly by my side.And on the other side, I was now presumably linked with Lord Lovat, chief of clan Fraser, with the abbot of a powerful French abbey, and with who knew how many other assorted Frasers.No, perhaps John Randall wouldnt think it worthwhile to pursue me.And that, after all, had been the point of this ridiculous arrangement.I stole a glance at Jamie, riding ahead now.His back was straight as an alder sapling and his hair shone under the sun like a helmet of burnished metal.Dougal followed my glance.Could have been worse, no?he said, with an ironic lift of his brow.* * *    Two nights later, we were encamped on a stretch of moorland, near one of those strange outcroppings of glacier pocked granite.It had been a long days travel, with only a hasty meal eaten in the saddle, and everyone was pleased to stop for a cooked dinner.I had tried early on to assist with the cooking, but my help had been more or less politely rejected by the taciturn clansman whose job it apparently was.One of the men had killed a deer that morning, and a portion of the fresh meat, cooked with turnips, onions, and whatever else he could find, had made a delicious dinner.Bursting with food and contentment, we all sprawled around the fire, listening to stories and songs.Surprisingly enough, little Murtagh, who seldom opened his mouth to speak, had a beautiful, clear tenor voice.While it was difficult to persuade him to sing, the results were worth it.I nestled closer to Jamie, trying to find a comfortable spot to sit on the hard granite.We had camped at the edge of the rocky outcrop, where a broad shelf of reddish granite gave us a natural hearth, and the towering jumble of rocks behind made a place to hide the horses.When I asked why we did not sleep more comfortably on the springy grass of the moor, Ned Gowan had informed me that we were now near the southern border of the MacKenzie lands.And thus near the territory of both Grants and Chisholms.Dougals scouts say theres no sign of anyone nearabouts, he had said, standing on a large boulder to peer into the sunset himself, but ye can never tell.Better safe than sorry, ye ken.When Murtagh called it quits, Rupert began to tell stories.While he lacked Gwyllyns elegant way with words, he had an inexhaustible fund of stories, about fairies, ghosts, the tannasg or evil spirits, and other inhabitants of the Highlands, such as the waterhorses.These beings, I was given to understand, inhabited almost all bodies of water, being especially common at fords and crossings, though many lived in the depths of the lochs.Theres a spot at the eastern end of Loch Garve, ye ken, he said, rolling his eyes around the gathering to be sure everyone was listening, that never freezes.Its always black water there, even when the rest o the loch is frozen solid, for thats the waterhorses chimney.The waterhorse of Loch Garve, like so many of his kind, had stolen a young girl who came to the loch to draw water, and carried her away to live in the depths of the loch and be his wife.Woe betide any maiden, or any man, for that matter, who met a fine horse by the waters side and thought to ride upon him, for a rider once mounted could not dismount, and the horse would step into the water, turn into a fish, and swim to his home with the hapless rider still stuck fast to his back.Now, a waterhorse beneath the waves has but fishs teeth, said Rupert, wiggling his palm like an undulating fish, and feeds on snails and waterweeds and cold, wet things.His blood runs cold as the water, and hes no need of fire, dye ken, but a human womans a wee bit warmer than that.Here he winked at me and leered outrageously, to the enjoyment of the listeners.So the waterhorses wife was sad and cold and hungry in her new home beneath the waves, not caring owermuch for snails and waterweed for her supper.So, the waterhorse being a kindly sort, takes himself to the bank of the loch near the house of a man with the reputation of a builder.And when the man came down to the river, and saw the fine golden horse with his silver bridle, shining in the sun, he couldna resist seizing the bridle and mounting.Sure enough, the waterhorse carries him straight into the water, and down through the depths to his own cold, fishy home.And there he tells the builder if he would be free, he must build a fine hearth, and a chimney as well, that the waterhorses wife might have a fire to warm her hands and fry her fish.I had been resting my head on Jamies shoulder, feeling pleasantly drowsy and looking forward to bed, even if that was only a blanket spread over granite.Suddenly I felt his body tense.He put a hand on my neck, warning me to keep still.I looked around the campsite, and could see nothing amiss, but I caught the air of tension, running from man to man as though transmitted by wireless.Looking in Ruperts direction, I saw him nod fractionally as he caught Dougals eye, though he went on with the story imperturbably.So the builder, havin little choice, did as he was bid.And so the waterhorse kept his word, and returned the man to the bank near his home.And the waterhorses wife was warm, then, and happy, and full of the fish she fried for her supper.And the water never freezes over the east end of Loch Garve because the heat from the waterhorses chimney melts the ice.Rupert was seated on a rock, his right side toward me.As he spoke, he bent down as though casually to scratch his leg.Without the slightest hitch in his movements, he grasped the knife that lay on the ground near his foot and transferred it smoothly to his lap, where it lay hidden in the folds of his kilt.I wriggled closer and pulled Jamies head down as though overcome by amorousness.What is it?I whispered in his ear.He seized my earlobe between his teeth and whispered back.The horses are restless.Someones near.One man got up and strolled to the edge of the rock to relieve himself.When he returned, he sat down in a new spot, next to one of the drovers.Another man rose and peered into the cook pot, helping himself to a morsel of venison.All around the campsite, there was a subtle shifting and moving, while Rupert kept on talking.Watching carefully, with Jamies arm tight around me, I finally realized that the men were moving closer to wherever their weapons had been placed.All of them slept with their dirks, but generally left swords, pistols, and the round leather shields called targes in small, neat heaps near the edge of the campsite.Jamies own pair of pistols lay on the ground with his sword, just a few feet away.I could see the firelight dancing on the damascened blade.While his pistols were no more than the customary horn handled dags worn by most of the men, both broadsword and claymore were something special.He had showed them to me with pride at one of our stops, turning the gleaming blades over lovingly in his hands.The claymore was wrapped inside his blanket roll; I could see the enormous T shaped hilt, the grip roughened for battle by careful sanding.I had lifted it, and nearly dropped it.It weighed close to fifteen pounds, Jamie told me.If the claymore was somber and lethal looking, the broadsword was beautiful.Two thirds the weight of the larger weapon, it was a deadly, gleaming thing with Islamic tracery snaking its way up the blue steel blade to the spiraled basket hilt, enameled in reds and blues.I had seen Jamie use it in playful practice, first right handed with one of the men at arms, later left handed with Dougal.He was a glory to watch under those conditions, swift and sure, with a grace made the more impressive by his size.But my mouth grew dry at the thought of seeing that skill used in earnest.He bent toward me, planting a tender kiss under the edge of my jaw, and taking the opportunity to turn me slightly, so that I faced one of the jumbled piles of rocks.Soon, I think, he murmured, kissing me industriously.Dye see the small opening in the rock?I did; a space less than three feet high, formed by two large slabs fallen together.He clasped my face and nuzzled me lovingly.When I say go, get into it and stay there.Have ye the dirk?He had insisted I keep the dirk he had tossed to me that night at the inn, despite my own insistence that I had neither the skill nor the inclination to use it.And when it came to insisting, Dougal had been right; Jamie was stubborn.Consequently, the dirk was in one of the deep pockets of my gown.After a day of uncomfortable awareness of its weight against my thigh, I had grown almost oblivious to it.He ran a hand playfully down my leg, checking to make certain of its presence.He lifted his head then, like a cat scenting the breeze.Looking up, I could see him glance at Murtagh, then down at me.The little man gave no outward sign, but rose and stretched himself thoroughly.When he sat down again, he was several feet nearer to me.A horse whickered nervously behind us.As though it had been a signal, they came screaming over the rocks.Not English, as I had feared, nor bandits.Highlanders, shrieking like banshees.Grants, I supposed.Or Campbells.On hands and knees, I made for the rocks.I banged my head and scraped my knees, but managed to wedge myself into the small crevice.Heart hammering, I fumbled for the dirk in my pocket, almost jabbing myself in the process.I had no idea what to do with the long, wicked knife, but felt slightly better for having it.There was a moonstone set in the hilt and it was comforting to feel the small bulge against my palm; at least I knew I had hold of the right end in the darkness.The fighting was so confused that at first I had no idea what was going on.The small clearing was filled with yelling bodies, heaving to and fro, rolling on the ground, and running back and forth.My sanctuary was luckily to one side of the main combat, so I was in no danger for the moment.Glancing around, I saw a small, crouching figure close by, pressed against my rock in the shadow.I took a firmer grip on my dirk, but realized almost at once that it was Murtagh.So that was the purpose of Jamies glance.Murtagh had been told off to guard me.I couldnt see Jamie himself anywhere.Most of the fighting was taking place in the rocks and shadows near the wagons.Of course, that must be the object of the raid; the wagons and the horses.The attackers were an organized band, well armed and decently fed, from the little I could see of them in the light of the dying fire.If these were Grants, then, perhaps they were seeking either booty or revenge for the cattle Rupert and friends had pilfered a few days before.Confronted with the results of that impromptu raid, Dougal had been mildly annoyednot with the fact of the raid, but only concerned that the cattle would slow our progress.He had managed to dispose of them almost at once, though, at a small market in one of the villages.It was soon clear that the attackers were not much concerned with inflicting harm on our party; only with getting to the horses and wagons.One or two succeeded.I crouched low as a barebacked horse leaped the fire and disappeared into the darkness of the moor, a caterwauling man clinging to its mane.Two or three more raced away on foot, clutching bags of Colums grain, pursued by furious MacKenzies shouting Gaelic imprecations.From the sound of it, the raid was dying down.Then a large group of men staggered out into the firelight and the action picked up again.This seemed to be serious fighting, an impression borne out by the flashing of blades and the fact that the participants were grunting a good deal, but not yelling.At length I got it sorted out.Jamie and Dougal were at the center of it, fighting back to back.Each of them held his broadsword in the left hand, dirk in the right, and both of them were putting the arms to good use, so far as I could see.They were surrounded by four menor five; I lost count in the shadowsarmed with short swords, though one man had a broadsword hung on his belt and at least two more carried undrawn pistols.It must be Dougal, or Jamie, or both, that they wanted.Alive, for preference.For ransom, I supposed.Thus the deliberate use of smallswords, which might merely wound, rather than the more lethal broadsword or pistols.Dougal and Jamie suffered from no such scruples, and were attending to business with considerable grim efficiency.Back to back, they formed a complete circle of threat, each man covering the others weaker side.When Dougal drove his dirk hand upward with considerable force, I thought that weaker might not be precisely the term.The whole roiling, grunting, cursing mess was staggering toward me.I pressed myself back as far as I could, but the crevice was barely two feet deep.I caught a stir of movement from the corner of my eye.Murtagh had decided to take a more active part in affairs.I could scarcely pull my horrified gaze away from Jamie, but saw the little clansman draw his pistol, so far unfired, in a leisurely manner.He checked the firing mechanism carefully, rubbed the weapon on his sleeve, braced it on his forearm and waited.And waited.I was shivering with fear for Jamie, who had given up finesse and was slashing savagely from side to side, beating back the two men who now faced him with sheer bloody mindedness.Why in hell didnt the man fire?I thought furiously.And then I realized why not.Both Jamie and Dougal were in the line of fire.I seemed to recall that flintlock pistols sometimes lacked a bit in the way of accuracy.This supposition was borne out in the next minute, as an unexpected lunge by one of Dougals opponents caught him at the wrist.The blade ripped up the length of his forearm and he sank to one knee.Feeling his uncle fall, Jamie pulled back his own blade and took two quick steps backward.This put his back near a rock face, Dougal crouched to one side, within reach of the protection of his single blade.It also brought the attackers side on to my hiding place and Murtaghs pistol.Close at hand, the report of the pistol was startlingly loud.It took the attackers by surprise, particularly the one who was hit.The man stood still for a moment, shook his head in a confused way, then very slowly sat down, fell limply backward, and rolled down a slight decline into the dying embers of the fire.Taking advantage of the surprise, Jamie knocked the sword from the hand of one attacker.Dougal was on his feet again, and Jamie moved to the side to give him room for swordplay.One of the fighters had abandoned the fray and run down the hill to drag his wounded companion out of the hot ashes.Still, that left three of the raiders, and Dougal wounded.I could see dark drops splashing against the rock face as he wielded the sword.They were close enough now that I could see Jamies face, calm and intent, absorbed with the exultancy of battle.Suddenly Dougal shouted something to him.Jamie tore his eyes from his opponents face for a split second and glanced down.Glancing back just in time to avoid being skewered, he ducked to one side and threw his sword.His opponent gazed in considerable surprise at the sword sticking in his leg.He touched the blade in some bemusement, then grasped it and pulled.From the ease with which it came out, I assumed the wound was not deep.The man still seemed slightly bewildered, and glanced up as though to ask the purpose of this unorthodox behavior.He uttered a scream, dropped the sword, and ran, limping heavily.Startled by the noise, the other two attackers looked over, turned, and likewise fled, pursued by Jamie, moving like an avalanche.He had succeeded in yanking the huge claymore out of the blanket roll, and was swinging it in a murderous, two handed arc.Backing him up came Murtagh, shouting something highly uncomplimentary in Gaelic and brandishing both sword and reloaded pistol.Things mopped up quite quickly after that, and it was only a quarter of an hour or so before the MacKenzie party had reassembled and assessed its damages.These had been slight; two horses had been taken, and three bags of grain, but the drovers, who slept with their loads, had prevented further depredations on the wagons, while the men at arms had succeeded in driving off the would be horse thieves.The major loss seemed to be one of the men.I thought when he was missed at first that he must have been wounded or killed in the scrimmage, but a thorough search of the area failed to turn him up.Kidnapped, said Dougal grimly.Blast, hell cost me a months income in ransom.Could ha been worse, Dougal, said Jamie, mopping his face on his sleeve.Think what Colum would say if theyd taken you!If theyd taken you, lad, Id ha let them keep ye, and ye could change your name to Grant, Dougal retorted, but the mood of the party lightened substantially.I unearthed the small box of medical supplies I had packed, and lined up the injured in order of severity.Nothing really bad, I was pleased to see.The wound on Dougals arm was likely the worst.Ned Gowan was bright eyed and fizzing with vitality, apparently so intoxicated with the thrill of the fight as hardly to notice the tooth that had been knocked out by an ill aimed dagger hilt.He had, however, retained sufficient presence of mind to keep it carefully held under his tongue.Just on the off chance, dye see, he explained, spitting it into the palm of his hand.The root was not broken, and the socket still bled slightly, so I took the chance and pressed the tooth firmly back into place.The little man went quite white, but didnt utter a sound.He gratefully swished his mouth with whisky for disinfectant purposes, though, and thriftily swallowed it.I had bound Dougals wound at once with a pressure bandage, and was glad to see that the bleeding had all but stopped by the time I unwrapped it.It was a clean slash, but a deep one.A tiny rim of yellow fat showed at the edge of the gaping cut, which went at least an inch deep into the muscle.No major vessels severed, thank goodness, but it would have to be stitched.The only needle available turned out to be a sturdy thing like a slender awl, used by the drovers to mend harness.I eyed it dubiously, but Dougal merely held out his arm and looked away.I dinna mind blood in general, he explained, but Ive some objection to seein my own.He sat on a rock as I worked, teeth clenched hard enough to make his jaw muscles quiver.The night was turning cold, but sweat stood out on the high forehead in beads.At one point, he asked me politely to stop for a moment, turned aside and was neatly sick behind a rock, then turned back and braced his arm on his knee again.By good luck, one tavern owner had chosen to remit his rent this quarter in the form of a small keg of whisky, and it came in quite handily.I used it to disinfect some of the open wounds, and then let my patients self medicate as they liked.I even accepted a cupful myself, at the conclusion of the doctoring.I drained it with pleasure and sank thankfully onto my blanket.The moon was sinking, and I was shivering, half with reaction and half with cold.It was a wonderful feeling to have Jamie lie down and firmly gather me in, next to his large, warm body.Will they come back, do you think?I asked, but he shook his head.Nay, it was Malcolm Grant and his two boysit was the oldest I stuck in the leg.Theyll be home in their own beds by now, he replied.He stroked my hair and said, in softer tones, Ye did a braw bit o work tonight, lass.I was proud of ye.I rolled over and put my arms about his neck.Not as proud as I was.You were wonderful, Jamie.Ive never seen anything like that.He snorted deprecatingly, but I thought he was pleased, nonetheless.Only a raid, Sassenach.Ive been doin that since I was fourteen.Its only in fun, ye see; its different when youre up against someone who really means to kill ye.Fun, I said, a little faintly.Yes, quite.His arms tightened around me, and one of the stroking hands dipped lower, beginning to inch my skirt upward.Clearly the thrill of the fight was being transmuted into a different kind of excitement.Jamie!Not here!I said, squirming away and pushing my skirt down again.Are ye tired, Sassenach?he asked with concern.Dinna worry, I wont take long.Now both hands were at it, rucking the heavy fabric up in front.No!I replied, all too mindful of the twenty men lying a few feet away.Im not tired, its just I gasped as his groping hand found its way between my legs.Lord, he said softly.Its slippery as waterweed.Jamie!There are twenty men sleeping right next to us!I shouted in a whisper.They wilna be sleeping long, if you keep talking.He rolled on top of me, pinning me to the rock.His knee wedged between my thighs and began to work gently back and forth.Despite myself, my legs were beginning to loosen.Twenty seven years of propriety were no match for several hundred thousand years of instinct.While my mind might object to being taken on a bare rock next to several sleeping soldiers, my body plainly considered itself the spoils of war and was eager to complete the formalities of surrender.He kissed me, long and deep, his tongue sweet and restless in my mouth.Jamie, I panted.He pushed his kilt out of the way and pressed my hand against him.Bloody Christ, I said, impressed despite myself.My sense of propriety slipped another notch.Fighting gives ye a terrible cockstand, after.Ye want me, do ye no?he said, pulling back a little to look at me.It seemed pointless to deny it, what with all the evidence to hand.He was hard as a brass rod against my bared thigh.Eryesbut  He took a firm grip on my shoulders with both hands.Be quiet, Sassenach, he said with authority.It isna going to take verra long.It didnt.I began to climax with the first powerful thrust, in long, racking spasms.I dug my fingers hard into his back and held on, biting the fabric of his shirt to muffle any sounds.In less than a dozen strokes, I felt his testicles contract, tight against his body, and the warm flood of his own release.He lowered himself slowly to the side and lay trembling.The blood was still beating heavily in my ears, echoing the fading pulse between my legs.Jamies hand lay on my breast, limp and heavy.Turning my head, I could see the dim figure of the sentry, leaning against a rock on the far side of the fire.He had his back tactfully turned.I was mildly shocked to realize that I was not even embarrassed.I wondered rather dimly whether I would be in the morning, and then wondered no more.* * *    In the morning, everyone behaved as usual, if moving a little more stiffly from the effects of fighting and sleeping on rocks.Everyone was in a cheerful humor, even those with minor wounds.The general humor was improved still further when Dougal announced that we would travel only as far as the clump of woods we could see from the edge of our rocky platform.There we could water and graze the horses, and rest a bit ourselves.I wondered whether this change of plan would affect Jamies rendezvous with the mysterious Horrocks, but he seemed undisturbed at the announcement.The day was overcast but not drizzling, and the air was warm.Once the new camp was made, the horses taken care of, and the wounded all rechecked everyone was left to his own devices, to sleep in the grass, to hunt or fish, or merely to stretch legs after several days in the saddle.I was sitting under a tree talking to Jamie and Ned Gowan, when one of the men at arms came up and flipped something into Jamies lap.It was the dirk with the moonstone hilt.Yours, lad?he asked.Found it in the rocks this morning.I must have dropped it, in all the excitement, I said.Just as well; Ive no idea what to do with it.Id likely have stabbed myself if Id tried to use it.Ned eyed Jamie censoriously over his half spectacles.Ye gave her a knife and didnt teach her to use it?There wasna time, under the circumstances, Jamie defended himself.But Neds right, Sassenach.Ye should learn how to handle arms.Theres no tellin what may happen on the road, as ye saw last night.So I was marched out into the center of a clearing and the lessons began.Seeing the activity, several of the MacKenzie men came by to investigate, and stayed to offer advice.In no time, I had half a dozen instructors, all arguing the fine points of technique.After a good deal of amiable discussion, they agreed that Rupert was likely the best among them at dirks, and he took over the lesson.He found a reasonably flat spot, free of rocks and pine cones, in which to demonstrate the art of dagger wielding.Look, lass, he said.He held the dagger balanced on his middle finger, resting an inch or so below the haft.The balance point, thats where ye want to hold it, so it fits comfortable in yer hand.I tried it with my dagger.When I had it comfortably fitted, he showed me the difference between an overhand strike and an underhanded stab.Generally, ye want to use the underhand; overhand is only good when yere comin down on someone wi a considerable force from above.He eyed me speculatively, then shook his head.Nay, youre tall for a woman, but even if ye could reach as high as the neck, ye wouldna have the force to penetrate, unless hes sittin.Best stick to underhand.He pulled up his shirt, revealing a substantial furry paunch, already glistening with sweat.Now, here, he said, pointing to the center, just under the breastbone, is the spot to aim for, if yere killin face to face.Aim straight up and in, as hard as ye can.Thatll go into the heart, and it kills wiin a minute or two.The only problem is to avoid the breastbone; it goes down lower than ye think, and if ye get yer knife stuck in that soft bit on the tip, it will hardly harm yer victim at all, but yell be wiout a knife, and hell ha you.Murtagh!Ye ha a skinny back; come ere and well show the lass how to stick from the back.Spinning a reluctant Murtagh around, he yanked up the grubby shirt to show a knobbly spine and prominent ribs.He poked a blunt forefinger under the lower rib on the right, making Murtagh squeak in surprise.This is the spot in backeither side.See, wi all the ribs and such, tis verra difficult to hit anythin vital when ye stab in the back.If ye can slip the knife between the ribs, thats one thing, but thats harder to do than ye might think.But here, under the last rib, ye stab upward into the kidney.Get him straight up, and hell drop like a stone.Rupert then set me to try stabbing in various positions and postures.As he grew winded, all the men took it in turns to act as victim, obviously finding my efforts hilarious.They obligingly lay on the grass or turned their backs so I could ambush them, or leaped at me from behind, or pretended to choke me so I could try to stab them in the belly.The spectators urged me on with cries of encouragement, and Rupert instructed me firmly not to pull back at the last moment.Thrust as though ye meant it, lass, he said.Ye canna pull back if its in earnest.And if any o these laggards canna get themselves out of the way in time, they deserve what they get.I was timid and extremely clumsy at first, but Rupert was a good teacher, very patient and good about demonstrating moves, over and over.He rolled his eyes in mock lewdness when he moved behind me and put his arm about my waist, but he was quite businesslike about taking hold of my wrist to show me the way of ripping an enemy across the eyes.Dougal sat under a tree, minding his wounded arm and making sardonic comments on the training as it progressed.It was he, though, who suggested the dummy.Give her something she can sink her dirk into, he said, when I had begun to show some facility at lunging and jabbing.Its a shock, the first time.So it is, Jamie agreed.Rest a bit, Sassenach, while I manage something.He went off to the wagons with two of the men at arms, and I could see them standing heads together, gesticulating and pulling bits of things from the wagon bed.Thoroughly winded, I collapsed under the tree next to Dougal.He nodded, a slight smile on his face.Like most of the men, he had not bothered to shave while traveling, and a heavy growth of dark brown beard framed his mouth, accentuating the full lower lip.How is it, then?he asked, not meaning my skill with small arms.Well enough, I answered warily, not meaning knives either.Dougals gaze flicked toward Jamie, busy with something by the wagons.Marriage seems to suit the lad, he observed.Rather healthy for himunder the circumstances, I agreed, somewhat coldly.His lips curved at my tone.And you, lass, as well.A good arrangement for everyone, it seems.Particularly for you and your brother.And speaking of him, just what do you think Colums going to say when he hears about it?The smile widened.Colum?Ah, well.I should think hed be only too pleased to welcome such a niece to the family.The dummy was ready, and I went back into training.It proved to be a large bag of wool, about the size of a mans torso, with a piece of tanned bulls hide wrapped around it, secured with rope.This I was to practice stabbing, first as it was tied to a tree at man height, later as it was thrown or rolled past me.What Jamie hadnt mentioned was that they had inserted several flat pieces of wood between the wool sack and the hide; to simulate bones, as he later explained.The first few stabs were uneventful, though it took several tries to get through the bull hide.It was tougher than it looked.So is the skin on a mans belly, I was informed.On the next try, I tried a direct overhand strike, and hit one of the wood pieces.I thought for a moment that my arm had suddenly fallen off.The shock of impact reverberated all the way to my shoulder, and the dirk dropped from my nerveless fingers.Everything below the elbow was numb, but an ominous tingling warned me that it wouldnt be for long.Jesus H.  Roosevelt Christ, I said.I stood gripping my elbow and listening to the general hilarity.Finally Jamie took me by the shoulder and massaged some feeling back into the arm, pressing the tendon at the back of the elbow, and digging his thumb into the hollow at the base of my wrist.All right, I said through my teeth, gingerly flexing my tingling right hand.What do you do when you hit a bone and lose your knife?Is there a standard operating procedure for that?Oh, aye, said Rupert, grinning.Draw your pistol wi the left hand and shoot the bastard dead.This resulted in more howls of laughter, which I ignored.All right, I said, more or less calmly.I gestured at the long claw handled pistol Jamie wore on his left hip.Are you going to show me how to load and shoot that, then?I am not.He was firm.I bristled a bit at this.Why not?Because youre a woman, Sassenach.I felt my face flush at this.Oh?I said sarcastically.You think women arent bright enough to understand the workings of a gun?He looked levelly at me, mouth twisting a bit as he thought over various replies.Ive a mind to let ye try it, he said at last.It would serve ye right.Rupert clicked his tongue in annoyance at us both.Dinna be daft, Jamie.As for you, lass, turning to me, its not that women are stupid, though sure enough some o em are; its that theyre small.Eh?I gaped stupidly at him for a moment.Jamie snorted and drew the pistol from its loop.Seen up close, it was enormous; a full eighteen inches of silvered weapon measured from stock to muzzle.Look, he said, holding it in front of me.Ye hold it here, ye brace it on your forearm, and ye sight along here.And when ye pull the trigger, it kicks like a mule.Im near a foot taller than you, four stone heavier, and I know what Im doin.It gives me a wicked bruise when I fire it; it might knock you flat on your back, if it didna catch ye in the face.He twirled the pistol and slid it back into its loop.Id let ye see for yourself, he said, raising one eyebrow, but I like ye better wi all of your teeth.Youve a nice smile, Sassenach, even if ye are a bit feisty.Slightly chastened by this episode, I accepted without argument the mens judgment that even the lighter smallsword was too heavy for me to wield efficiently.The tiny sgian dhu, the sock dagger, was deemed acceptable, and I was provided with one of those, a wicked looking, needle sharp piece of black iron about three inches long, with a short hilt.I practiced drawing it from its place of concealment over and over while the men watched critically, until I could sweep up my skirt, grab the knife from its place and come up in the proper crouch all in one smooth move, ending up with the knife held underhand, ready to slash across an adversarys throat.Finally I was passed as a novice knife wielder, and allowed to sit down to dinner, amid general congratulationswith one exception.Murtagh shook his head dubiously.I still say the only good weapon for a woman is poison.Perhaps, replied Dougal, but it has its deficiencies in face to face combat.19    THE WATERHORSE    We camped the next night on the banks above Loch Ness.It gave me an odd feeling to see the place again; so little had changed.Or would change, I should say.The larches and alders were a deeper green, because it was now midsummer, not late spring.The flowers had changed from the fragile pinks and whites of May blossom and violets to the warmer golds and yellows of gorse and broom.The sky above was a deeper blue, but the surface of the loch was the same; a flat blue black that caught the reflections from the bank above and held them trapped, colors muted under smoked glass.There were even a few sailboats visible, far up the loch.Though when one drew near, I saw it was a coracle, a rough half shell of tanned leather on a frame, not the sleek wooden shape I was used to.The same pungent scent that pervades all watercourses was there; a sharp mix of tangy greenness and rotted leaf, fresh water, dead fish, and warm mud.Above all, there was that same feeling of lurking strangeness about the place.The men as well as the horses seemed to feel it, and the air of the camp was subdued.Having found a comfortable place for my own bedroll and Jamies, I wandered down to the edge of the loch to wash my face and hands before supper.The bank sloped sharply down until it broke in a jumble of large rock slabs that formed a sort of irregular jetty.It was very peaceful under the bank, out of sight and sound of the camp, and I sat down beneath a tree to enjoy a moments privacy.Since my hasty marriage to Jamie, I was no longer followed every moment; that much had been accomplished.I was idly plucking the clusters of winged seeds from a low hanging branch and tossing them out into the loch when I noticed the tiny waves against the rocks growing stronger, as though pushed by an oncoming wind.A great flat head broke the surface not ten feet away.I could see the water purling away from keeled scales that ran in a crest down the sinuous neck.The water was agitated for some considerable distance, and I caught a glimpse here and there of dark and massive movement beneath the surface of the loch, though the head itself stayed relatively still.I stood quite still myself.Oddly enough, I was not really afraid.I felt some faint kinship with it, a creature further from its own time than I, the flat eyes old as its ancient Eocene seas, eyes grown dim in the murky depths of its shrunken refuge.And there was a sense of familiarity mingled with its unreality.The sleek skin was a smooth, deep blue, with a vivid slash of green shining with brilliant iridescence beneath the jaw.And the strange, pupilless eyes were a deep and glowing amber.So very beautiful.And so very different from the smaller, mud colored replica I remembered, adorning the fifth floor diorama in the British Museum.But the shape was unmistakable.The colors of living things begin to fade with the last breath, and the soft, springy skin and supple muscle rot within weeks.But the bones sometimes remain, faithful echoes of the shape, to bear some last faint witness to the glory of what was.Valved nostrils opened suddenly with a startling hiss of breath; a moment of suspended motion, and the creature sank again, a churning roil of waters the only testimony to its passage.I had risen to my feet when it appeared.And unconsciously I must have moved closer in order to watch it, for I found myself standing on one of the rock slabs that jutted out into the water, watching the dying waves fall back into the smoothness of the loch.I stood there for a moment, looking out across the fathomless loch.Goodbye, I said at last to the empty water.I shook myself and turned back to the bank.A man was standing at the top of the slope.I was startled at first, then recognized him as one of the drovers from our party.His name was Peter, I recalled, and the bucket in his hand gave the reason for his presence.I was about to ask him whether he had seen the beast, but the expression on his face as I drew near was more than sufficient answer.His face was paler than the daisies at his feet, and tiny droplets of sweat trickled down into his beard.His eyes showed white all around like those of a terrified horse, and his hand shook so that the bucket bumped against his leg.Its all right, I said, as I came up to him.Its gone.Instead of finding this statement reassuring, it seemed occasion for fresh alarm.He dropped the bucket, fell to his knees before me and crossed himself.Ha have mercy, lady, he stammered.To my extreme embarrassment, he then flung himself flat on his face and clutched at the hem of my dress.Dont be ridiculous, I said with some asperity.Get up.I prodded him gently with my toe, but he only quivered and stayed pressed to the ground like a flattened fungus.Get up, I repeated.Stupid man, its only a I paused, trying to think.Telling him its Latin name was unlikely to help.Its only a wee monster, I said at last, and grabbing his hand, tugged him to his feet.I had to fill the bucket, as he would (not unreasonably) not go near the waters edge again.He followed me back to the camp, keeping a careful distance, and scuttled off at once to tend to his mules, casting apprehensive glances over his shoulder at me as he went.As he seemed undisposed to mention the creature to anyone else, I thought perhaps I should keep quiet as well.While Dougal, Jamie, and Ned were educated men, the rest were largely illiterate Highlanders from the remote crags and glens of the MacKenzie lands.They were courageous fighters and dauntless warriors, but they were also as superstitious as any primitive tribesmen from Africa or the Middle East.So I ate my supper quietly and went to bed, conscious all the time of the wary gaze of the drover Peter.20    DESERTED GLADES    Two days after the raid, we turned again to the north.We were drawing closer to the rendezvous with Horrocks, and Jamie seemed abstracted from time to time, perhaps considering what importance the English deserters news might have.I had not seen Hugh Munro again, but I had wakened in darkness the night before to find Jamie gone from the blanket beside me.I tried to stay awake, waiting for him to return, but fell asleep as the moon began to sink.In the morning, he was sound asleep beside me, and on my blanket rested a small parcel, done up in a sheet of thin paper, fastened with the tail feather of a woodpecker thrust through the sheet.Unfolding it carefully, I found a large chunk of rough amber.One face of the chunk had been smoothed off and polished, and in this window could be seen the delicate dark form of a tiny dragonfly, suspended in eternal flight.I smoothed out the wrapping.A message was incised on the grimy white surface, written in small and surprisingly elegant lettering.What does it say?I asked Jamie, squinting at the odd letters and marks.I think its in Gaelic.He raised up on one elbow squinting at the paper.Not Gaelic.Latin.Munro was a schoolmaster once, before the Turks took him.Its a bit from Catullus, he said.da mi basia mille, diende centum,  dein mille altera, dein secunda centum    A faint blush pinkened his earlobes as he translated:  Then let amorous kisses dwell  On our lips, begin and tell  A Thousand and a Hundred score  A Hundred, and a Thousand more.Well, thats a bit more high class than your usual fortune cookie, I observed, amused.What?Jamie looked startled.Never mind, I said hastily.Did Munro find Horrocks for you?Oh, aye.Its arranged.Ill meet him in a small place I know in the hills, a mile or two above Lag Cruime.In four days time, if nothing goes wrong meanwhile.The mention of things going wrong made me a bit nervous.Do you think its safe?I mean, do you trust Horrocks?He sat up, rubbing the remnants of sleep from his eyes and blinking.An English deserter?God, no.I imagine hed sell me to Randall as soon as hed spit, except that he canna very well go to the English himself.They hang deserters.No, I dinna trust him.Thats why I came wi Dougal on this journey, instead of seeking out Horrocks alone.If the mans up to anything, at least Ill have company.Oh.I wasnt sure that Dougals presence was all that reassuring, given the apparent state of affairs between Jamie and his two scheming uncles.Well, if you think so, I said doubtfully.I dont suppose Dougal would take the opportunity to shoot you, at least.He did shoot me, Jamie said cheerfully, buttoning his shirt.You should know, ye dressed the wound.I dropped the comb I had been using.Dougal!I thought the English shot you!Well, the English shot at me, he corrected.And I shouldna say it was Dougal shot me; in fact, it was probably Ruperthes the best marksman among Dougals men.No, when we were running from the English, I realized we were near the edge of the Fraser lands, and I thought Id take my chances there.So I spurred up and cut to the left, around Dougal and the rest.There was a good deal of shooting goin on, mind ye, but the ball that hit me came from behind.Dougal, Rupert, and Murtagh were back of me then.And the English were all in frontin fact, when I fell off the horse, I rolled down the hill and ended almost in their laps.He bent over the bucket of water I had brought, splashing cold handfuls over his face.He shook his head to clear his eyes, then blinked at me, grinning, glistening drops clinging to his thick lashes and brows.Come to that, Dougal had a sore fight to get me back.I was lyin on the ground, not fit for much, and he was standing over me, pulling on my belt with one hand to get me up and his sword in the other, going hand to hand with a dragoon who thought he had a certain cure for my ills.Dougal killed the man and got me on his own horse.He shook his head.Everything was a bit dim to me then; all I could think of was how hard it must be on the horse, tryin to make it up a hill like that with four hundred pounds on his back.I sat back, a little stunned.Butif hed wanted to, Dougal could have killed you then.Jamie shook his head, taking out the straight razor he had borrowed from Dougal.He moved the bucket slightly, so the surface formed a reflecting pool, and pulling his face into the tortuous grimace men use when they shave, began to scrape his cheeks.No, not in front of the men.Besides, Dougal and Colum didna necessarily want me deadespecially not Dougal.But My head was beginning to whirl again, as it seemed to do whenever I encountered the complexities of Scottish family life.Jamies words were a little muffled, as he stuck out his chin, tilting his head to reach the bit of stubble beneath his jaw.Its Lallybroch, he explained, feeling with his free hand for stray whiskers.Besides being a rich bit of ground, the estate sits at the head of a mountain pass, dye see.The only good pass into the Highlands for ten miles in either direction.Come to another Rising, it would be a valuable bit of land to control.And if I were to die before wedding, chances are the land would go back to the Frasers.He grinned, stroking his neck.No, Im a pretty problem to the brothers MacKenzie.On the one hand, if Im a threat to young Hamishs chieftainship, they want me safely dead.On the other, if Im not, they want meand my propertysecurely on their side if it comes to warnot wi the Frasers.Thats why theyre willing to help me wi Horrocks, ye see.I canna do that much wi Lallybroch while Im outlawed, even though the lands still mine.I rolled up the blankets, shaking my head in bewilderment over the intricateand dangerouscircumstances through which Jamie seemed to move so nonchalantly.And it struck me suddenly that not only Jamie was involved now.I looked up.You said that if you died before wedding, the land would go back to the Frasers, I said.But youre married now.So who  Thats right, he said, nodding at me with a lopsided grin.The morning sun lit his hair with flames of gold and copper.If Im killed now, Sassenach, Lallybroch is yours.* * *    It was a beautiful sunny morning, once the mist had risen.Birds were busy in the heather, and the road was wide here, for a change, and softly dusty under the horses hooves.Jamie rode up close beside me as we crested a small hill.He nodded to the right.See that wee glade down below there?Yes.It was a small green patchwork of pines, oaks, and aspens, set back some distance from the road.Theres a spring with a pool there, under the trees, and smooth grass.A very bonny place.I looked over at him quizzically.A little early for lunch, isnt it?Thats not precisely what I had in mind.Jamie, I had found out by accident a few days previously, had never mastered the art of winking one eye.Instead, he blinked solemnly, like a large red owl.And just what did you have in mind?I inquired.My suspicious look met an innocent, childlike gaze of blue.I was just wondering what youd look likeon the grassunder the treesby the waterwith your skirts up around your ears.Er I said.Ill tell Dougal were going to fetch water.He spurred up ahead, returning in a moment with the water bottles from the other horses.I heard Rupert shout something after us in Gaelic as we rode down the hill, but couldnt make out the words.I reached the glade first.Sliding down, I relaxed on the grass and shut my eyes against the glare of the sun.Jamie reined up beside me a moment later, and swung down from the saddle.He slapped the horse and sent it away, reins dangling, to graze with mine, before dropping to his knees on the grass.I reached up and pulled him down to me.It was a warm day, redolent with grass and flower scents.Jamie himself smelled like a fresh plucked grass blade, sharp and sweet.Well have to be quick, I said.Theyll be wondering why its taking so long to get water.They wont wonder, he said, undoing my laces with a practiced ease.They know.What do you mean?Did ye no hear what Rupert said as we left?I heard him, but I couldnt tell what he said.My Gaelic was improving to the point that I could understand the more common words, but conversation was still far beyond me.Good.It wasna fit for your ears.Having freed my breasts, he buried his face in them, sucking and biting gently until I could stand it no more and slid down beneath him, tucking my skirts up out of the way.Feeling absurdly self conscious after that fierce and primitive encounter on the rock, I had been shy about letting him make love to me near the camp, and the woods were too thick to safely move very far from the campsite.Both of us were feeling the mild and pleasant strain of abstinence, and now, safely removed from curious eyes and ears, we came together with an impact that made my lips and fingers tingle with a rush of blood.We were both nearing the end when Jamie froze abruptly.Opening my eyes, I saw his face dark against the sun, wearing a perfectly indescribable expression.There was something black pressed against his head.My eyes at last adjusting to the glare, I saw it was a musket barrel.Get up, you rutting bastard.The barrel moved sharply, jarring against Jamies temple.Very slowly, he rose to his feet.A drop of blood began to well from the graze, dark against his white face.There were two of them; Redcoat deserters from the look of their ragtag remnants of uniform.Both were armed with muskets and pistols, and looked very much amused by what chance had delivered into their hands.Jamie stood with his hands raised, the barrel of a musket pressed against his chest, face carefully expressionless.You might ha let im finish, Arry, said one of the men.He grinned broadly, with a fine display of rotting teeth.Stoppin in the middle like thats bad for a mans ealth.His fellow prodded Jamie in the chest with the musket.Is ealths no concern o mine.An it wont be any concern to im for much longer.Ive a mind to take a piece o that, he nodded briefly in my direction, an I dont care to come second to any man, let alone a Scottish whoreson like this.Rotten teeth laughed.I baint so bloody particular.Kill im, then, and get on wi it.Harry, a short, stout man with a squint, considered a moment, eyeing me speculatively.I still sat on the ground, knees drawn up and skirts pressed firmly around my ankles.I had made some effort to close my bodice, but a good deal was still exposed.Finally the short man laughed and beckoned to his companion.No, let im watch.Come ower ere, Arnold, and old your musket on im.Arnold obeyed, still grinning widely.Harry set his musket down on the ground and dropped his pistol belt beside it in preparation.Pressing my skirts down, I became aware of a hard object in the right hand pocket.The dagger Jamie had given me.Could I bring myself to use it?Yes, I decided, looking at Harrys pimpled, leering face, I definitely could.I would have to wait til the last possible second, though, and I had my doubts as to whether Jamie could control himself that long.I could see the urge to kill marked strong on his features; soon consideration of the consequences would no longer be enough to hold him back.I didnt dare let too much show on my face, but narrowed my eyes and glared at him as hard as I could, willing him not to move.The cords stood out in his neck, and his face was suffused with dark blood, but I saw an infinitesimal nod in acknowledgment of my message.I struggled as Harry pressed me to the ground and tried to pull up my skirts, more in order to get my hand on the dagger hilt than in actual resistance.He slapped me hard across the face, ordering me to be still.My cheek burned and my eyes watered, but the dagger was now in my hand, concealed under the folds of my skirt.I lay back, breathing heavily.I concentrated on my objective, trying to erase everything else from my mind.It would have to be in the back; the quarters were too close to try for the throat.The filthy fingers were digging into my thighs now, wrenching them apart.In my mind, I could see Ruperts blunt finger stabbing at Murtaghs ribs, and hear his voice, Here, lass, up under the lowest ribs, close to the backbone.Stab hard, upward into the kidney, and hell drop like a stone.It was almost time; Harrys foul breath was disgustingly warm on my face, and he was fumbling between my bared legs, intent on his goal.Take a good look, laddie buck, and see how its done, he panted, Ill ave your slut moaning for more before  I whipped my left arm around his neck to hold him close; holding the knife hand high, I plunged it in as hard as I could.The shock of impact reverberated up my arm, and I nearly lost my hold on the dagger.Harry yelped and squirmed, twisting to get away.Unable to see, I had aimed too high, and the knife had skittered off a rib.I couldnt let go now.Luckily, my legs were free of the entangling skirts.I wrapped them tightly around Harrys sweating hips, holding him down for the precious seconds I needed for another try.I stabbed again, with a desperate strength, and this time found the spot.Rupert had been right.Harry bucked in a hideous parody of the act of love, then collapsed without a sound in a limp heap on top of me, blood jetting in diminishing spurts from the wound in his back.Arnolds attention had been distracted for an instant by the spectacle on the ground, and an instant was more than long enough for the maddened Scotsman he held at bay.By the time I had gathered my wits sufficiently to wriggle out from under the defunct Harry, Arnold had joined his companion in death, throat neatly cut from ear to ear by the sgian dhu that Jamie carried in his stocking.Jamie knelt beside me, pulling me out from under the corpse.We were both shaking with nerves and shock, and we clung together without speaking for minutes.Still without speaking, he picked me up and carried me away from the two bodies, to a grassy space behind a screen of aspen.He lowered me to the ground and sat down awkwardly beside me, collapsing as though his knees had suddenly given way.I felt a chilly isolation, as though the winter wind blew through my bones, and reached for him.He raised his head from his knees, face haggard, and stared at me as though he had never seen me before.When I put my hands on his shoulders, he pulled me hard against his chest with a sound midway between a groan and a sob.We took each other then, in a savage, urgent silence, thrusting fiercely and finishing within moments, driven by a compulsion I didnt understand, but knew we must obey, or be lost to each other forever.It was not an act of love, but one of necessity, as though we knew that left alone, neither of us could stand.Our only strength lay in fusion, drowning the memories of death and near rape in the flooding of the senses.We clung together on the grass then, disheveled, blood stained, and shivering in the sunshine.Jamie muttered something, his voice so low that I caught only the word sorry.Not your fault, I muttered, stroking his hair.Its all right, were both all right.I felt dreamlike, as though nothing whatever was real around me, and I dimly recognized the symptoms of delayed shock.Not that, he said.Not that.It was my fault.So foolish to come here without taking proper heed.And to let you beI didna mean that, though.I meantIm sorry for using ye as I did just now.To take you like that, so soon afterlike some sort of animal.Im sorry, ClaireI dont know whatI couldna help it, butLord, youre so cold, mo duinne, your hands are ice, Come then, let me warm ye.Shock, too, I thought fuzzily.Funny how it takes some people in talk.Others just shake quietly.Like me.I pressed his mouth against my shoulder to quiet him.Its all right, I said, over and over.Its all right.Suddenly a shadow fell across us, making us both jump.Dougal stood glowering down at us, arms folded.He courteously averted his eyes while I hastily did up my laces, frowning instead at Jamie.Now look ye, lad, takin your pleasure wi your wife is all verra weel, but when it comes to leavin us all waiting for more than an hour, and being so taen up wi each other that ye dinna even hear me cominthat kind o behavior will get ye in trouble one day, laddie.Why, someone could come up behind ye and clap a pistol to your head before ye knew  He stopped in his tirade to stare incredulously at me, rolling on the grass in hysterics.Jamie, red as a beetroot, led Dougal to the other side of the aspen screen, explaining in a subdued voice.I continued to whoop and giggle uncontrollably, finally stuffing a handkerchief in my mouth to muffle the noise.The sudden release of emotions, coupled with Dougals words, had evoked a picture of Jamies face, caught in the act as it were, that I found totally hilarious in my unhinged state.I laughed and moaned until my sides ached.Finally, I sat up, wiping my eyes on my kerchief, to see Dougal and Jamie standing over me, wearing identical expressions of disapproval.Jamie hoisted me to my feet and led me, still hiccuping and snorting occasionally, to where the rest of the men were waiting with the horses.* * *    Except for a lingering tendency to laugh hysterically over nothing, I seemed to suffer no ill effects from our encounter with the deserters, though I became very cautious about leaving the campsite.Dougal assured me that bandits were not, in fact, that common on the Highland roads, only because there were not many travelers worth robbing, but I found myself starting nervously at sounds in the wood, and hastening back from routine chores like fetching wood and water, eager for the sight and sound of the MacKenzie men.I also found new reassurance in the sound of their snoring around me at night, and lost whatever self consciousness I might have had about the discreet writhings that took place under our blankets.I was still somewhat fearful of being alone when, a few days later, the time for the meeting with Horrocks arrived.Stay here?I said in disbelief.No!Im going with you.You cant, said Jamie patiently, once more.The bulk of the men will go on to Lag Cruime wi Ned, to collect the rents as expected.Dougal and a few of the others are coming wi me to the meeting, in case of any treachery by Horrocks.You cant be seen in the open near Lag Cruime, though; Randalls men may be about, and I wouldna put it past him to take ye by force.And as for the meeting wi Horrocks, Ive no idea what may happen.No, theres a small copse near the bend of the roadits thick and grassy, and theres water nearby.Youll be comfortable there, until I come back for ye.No, I said stubbornly.Im coming with you.Some sense of pride made me unwilling to tell him that I was frightened of being away from him.But I was willing to tell him that I was frightened for him.You said yourself you dont know what will happen with Horrocks, I argued.I dont want to wait here, wondering all day whats happening to you.Let me come with you, I coaxed.I promise Ill stay out of sight during the meeting.But I dont want to stay here alone, worrying all day.He sighed impatiently, but didnt argue further.When we reached the copse, though, he leaned over and seized my horses bridle, forcing me off the road into the grass.He slid off his horse, tying both sets of reins to a bush.Ignoring my vociferous objections, he disappeared into the trees.Stubbornly, I refused to dismount.He couldnt make me stay, I thought.He came down at last to the road.The others had gone on before, but Jamie, mindful of our last experience with deserted glades, wouldnt leave until he had thoroughly searched the copse, quartering methodically through the trees and swishing the tall grass with a stick.Coming back, he untied the horses, and swung up into his saddle.Its safe, he said.Ride up well into the thicket, Claire, and hide yourself and the horse.Ill be back for ye, as soon as our business is done.I canna tell how long, but surely by sunset.No!Im coming with you.I couldnt stand the thought of stewing in a forest, not knowing what was happening.I would far rather be in active danger than be left for anxious hours, waiting and wondering.And alone.Jamie curbed his impatience to be gone.He reached over and grasped my shoulder.Did ye no promise to obey me?he asked, shaking me gently.Yes, but But only because I had to, I was going to say, but he was already urging my horses head around toward the thicket.Its verra dangerous, and Ill not have ye there, Claire.I shall be busy, and if it comes to it, I cant fight and protect you at the same time.Seeing my mutinous look, he dropped his hand to the saddlebag and began rummaging.What are you looking for?Rope.If ye wilna do as I say, I shall tie ye to a tree until I come back.You wouldnt!Aye, I would!Plainly he meant it.I gave in with bad grace, and reluctantly reined in my horse.Jamie leaned to kiss me glancingly on the cheek, already turning to go.Take care, Sassenach.Youve your dirk?Good.I shall come back as soon as I can.Oh, one more thing.Whats that?I said sullenly.If you leave that copse before I come for ye, Ill tan your bare arse wi my sword belt.Ye wouldna enjoy walking all the way to Bargrennan.Remember, he said, pinching my cheek gently, I dinna make idle threats.He didnt, either.I rode slowly toward the grove, looking back to watch him racing away, bent low over the saddle, one with the horse, the ends of his plaid flying behind.
