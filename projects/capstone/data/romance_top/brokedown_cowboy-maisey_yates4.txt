Because of the loss of Jessie.Yeah, a huge dick.She looked away from Connor, and over at the dance floorwhich was really just some boards that had been anchored to the ground temporarilywhere people had already coupled off and were holding each other close as the band played a slow country song.Did you get a drink?Liss looked over and saw Ace standing beside her, holding out a red plastic cup with beer filled to the top.I didnt, she said, taking his offering.Thanks.Im taking a break, he said, rocking back on his heels.Do you want to take one, too?Are you hitting on me?she asked.She had known Ace in passing for years, and while he was definitely sexy, she had never really thought of him that way.Mainly because she had either been in a relationship or pining after Connor.Which didnt leave a whole lot of time to look at the perfectly nice eligible men who littered the town.That should change.He smiled, his blue eyes glittering.Maybe.Unless you dont want me to.In which case, maybe lets just start with a dance.She set her beer down on the table next to her.I cant remember the last time I danced.Sure.His smile broadened, and he held his hand out.She took it.It was warm and strong.It was nice.But it didnt turn her on.Nothing like when Connor had taken hold of her arm when he caught her on the trail.Of course, she hadnt even begun to think of Ace in a sexual way, and Connor had the benefit of more than fifteen years of fantasy built around him.So maybe that was the reason.They moved to the edge of the dance floor, and he pulled her up against his chest, one hand around her waist, the other holding hers.How come weve never danced before?he asked, a hint of double entendre lacing his tone.No good reason I can think of, she said.Liss saw movement out of the corner of her eye and saw Connor walking toward the dance floor.For one heart stopping second, she thought he was coming for her.And if he did, she would go with him.There was no question.Yes, Ace was hot.And being held up close against his body felt nice, but that was all it was.Nice.Kind of comfortable like a pair of socks.And she barely knew the guy.Shed known Connor for the better part of her life, and try as she might, she couldnt make touching him comfortable.Touching Connor was like standing in a field during a lightning storm.Exhilarating, beautiful, terrifying.Probably dangerous.It had been, from the time shed been a fifteen year old girl until now as a thirty three year old woman.But Connor wasnt walking toward them.He wasnt even looking at them.Instead, Connor walked straight past all of the dancing and went right for the stage.The band stopped playing, and Connor went to stand in front of the lead singers microphone.Nobody panic.Im not going to sing.Everyone laughed, and Liss suddenly became aware that she was still standing, holding on to Ace.Which, when she thought about it, was a little bit weird when there was no music.I just wanted to thank everyone for coming out today, Connor said, clearing his throat nervously.Other than when hed spoken his vows in front of the guests at his wedding, Liss didnt think Connor had ever spoken in front of a group of people before.She felt nervous on his behalf.Everyone here has been a lot better to me than Ive ever been to them.And thats the truth.Eli is the best of us Garretts.Kate comes in a close second.I think Im somewhere way down the list, even though most of the spaces on the list are blank.Liss extricated herself from Aces hold, offering him a smile and tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, trying to minimize the little bit of awkwardness that always followed when youd just squirmed out of a guys arms.All that to say, Connor continued, lets raise a barn.There was a smattering of applause after his announcement, but Connor was already moving away from the stage and toward the building site.I guess thats my cue, Ace said, offering her a smile and walking toward Connor.But Lisss brain ceased to process anything when Connor gripped the hem of his white T shirt and tugged it over his head, sending his baseball cap flying to the ground, exposing his broad, muscular back and his lean waist.Those jeans were riding dangerously low on his hips, and she absolutely stared as he bent down to retrieve the cap hed lost during his unintentional strip show.Connor wasnt the only worker who decided to ditch his shirt.It was a veritable all male revue.Of course, none of them flipped her switch quite the way Connor did.Not bad.Kate Garrett was standing at Lisss side, obviously enjoying the show.Though Liss imagined for very different reasons.No, indeed, Sadie said, coming to stand on the other side of Liss.Of course, the object of my affection has left his shirt on.Hes far too appropriate sometimes.Well, not in all venues.She winked, and Kate groaned.Liss couldnt help but feel as if there was something slightly pointed in the way Sadie had worded the previous sentence.And she didnt like it at all.Ace left his shirt on, Liss said, talking directly to Sadie.Shame, Kate said.Sadie offered her a look that spoke volumes.A real tragedy for you.Kate made a noise in the back of her throat.Oh, look, Jack took this opportunity to take his shirt off, too.I dont think he likes to keep his clothes on if he can help it.Not if the rumors about him are true, Liss said, more than happy to take the focus off her.Do you think they are?Kate asked.For some reason Liss didnt really want to confirm for Kate that she was 99 percent sure the rumors about Jack were understated if anything.I feel like we should help, Kate said.I organized most of this, so I do not feel the need to pick up a tool of any kind, Sadie said.Kate rolled her eyes.A little sweat isnt going to hurt you, she said, rolling up the sleeves on her plaid shirt.I can only think of a couple good reasons to sweat, Sadie said.Scratch that, I can think of one good reason to sweat.And it has nothing to do with raising a barn.I get it, Sadie.You have sex with my brother.We dont ever need to speak of it.Kate flipped her braid over her shoulder.Now, if youll excuse me, Im going to go make myself useful.Kate turned and walked toward the action, and Liss and Sadie watched her go.Then Sadie turned her far too keen blue eyes onto Liss.So, how are things going?Well, my car is starting almost every time, so thats nice.I meant with Connor.With the arrangement.Liss narrowed her eyes.I dont know what youre getting at.Yes, you do.You were dancing with Ace, who, may I say, is a pretty hot specimen, and you were holding on to him like he was a toad.Liss gasped.I was not.I was dancing with him like he was an attractive man.And you kept looking at Connor.Liss sputtered, her protest stumbling on her lips.And in the end she decided against voicing it at all.Okay, so Im not attracted to Ace.Im not going to pretend.But nothing is happening with me and Connor.Nothing ever will.There is history wrapped in issues between us, not to mention the fact that were basically siblings.Sadie held her hands up in mock surrender.All right, all right.No need to get touchy.Liss sneaked a peek at Sadie.You believe me, right?She shook her head.No.I dont believe you.I think you want to jump his bones.But I wont push you.Even if I wanted to, I cant.Just saying the words made her feel desolate.She hated that.Why not?Friendship.Nearly two decades of it.Plus, the baggage.The fact that his late wife was one of my best friends.Liss looked down, her heart beating heavily.I know you didnt really know Jessie, but she was wonderful.Shes also not here anymore, Sadie said.And he is.And you are.I. ..Its not that simple.I didnt say it would be simple.I just said you wanted it.She should deny it.She really should.But she felt as though any denial would be feeble, and epically transparent.I really want simple.Mainly, I would like to not lose the good things I have.What if you added better things?I think this is when I ask when Eli is going to propose to you, Liss said.Sadie arched a brow.Nice.Hes probably waiting until hes sure I wont skitter off.Im a proven flight risk.Somehow, I dont think you are anymore.Sadie smiled, a happiness in her eyes that Liss craved with an intensity that shocked her.No, not anymore.Hes got me for good.And he didnt even have to handcuff me to anything.True love.Yeah, it is.And in my experience, it was worth facing down a little bit of fear.Liss cleared her throat.Well, I will keep that in mind should it ever become relevant.Someday well talk about your denial, Sadie said.You didnt get your therapist license renewed, did you?Sadie just smiled and walked over to the table with all of the pie.Liss stayed in her spot, watching as the walls of the barn went up.By the end of the evening, everyone was exhausted, but the frame and the roof were intact.Looking at it now, as all of the people in town started to dissipate, as the laughter faded, Liss felt her throat tighten.It was such an amazing thing, their town.The community that was here.The way they all supported each other.The way they were here for Connor, the way Connor had been here for her.Given her a place to stay when she needed him.It was something that ran so much deeper than attraction.Something she prized more than anything else.It was loyaltyunbreakable, unconditional and deep.It was something shed never had with the father she didnt know.Something she hadnt had with her mother, who was content to take until Liss had nothing more to give.It was real.And, Liss decided, standing there in the fading light, looking at the barn, not worth risking for anything.* * * IT HAD TO be close to midnight.Everyone had gone home hours ago.But not Connor.He couldnt sleep.And he didnt want to drink.Not after hed gone so many nights without doing it.But he was pissed, and his brain was going double time.Energy was pouring through his veins, making it impossible for him to sit still.So he was in the barn, hammering siding up himself, in the light of the big yellow work lamp he always used for this kind of project.Sweat was rolling down his chest, in spite of the fact that the dark air was cold.He put another board in place and started to hammer the nail.He should be using a nail gun.But he wanted to pound on something.He wasnt sure if he wanted to get the barn up, or if he was trying to knock it down.Wasnt sure if he was happy about it, or if he hated it.When the original barn had been built, it had been with a view to the future.It had been his dream, and Jessies dream.This was something different.Something he wasnt sure he was ready to have.This restlessness had been eating at him since they first started preparing the site for the raising today.And it had only gotten worse over the course of the day.Then Ace Thompson had put his fucking hands on Liss.Sure, it was just dancing.She probably hadnt even gone home with him.Probably.He didnt know, because he hadnt gone back to the house.He didnt want to know.He didnt want to be upset about it, either.But he was.Seeing as he had recently decided that he wanted to put his hands on Liss.No, decided was a terrible word for it.He hadnt decided anything.His dick had made that decision.And it was a terrible decision.He knew it.But it didnt stop him from hating the man who had perfect freedom to touch her.Because Connor couldnt.For so many reasons.So many damn reasons.All perfectly valid.Because she was his best friend.Because he hadnt felt this way until shed moved in.Because he was pretty sure he felt this way only because of the close proximity.And because of the fact that he hadnt had sex in three years.And those were all terrible reasons to screw up the best relationship you had.So he was out here hammering nails.Because he couldnt get hammered, and he couldnt nail Liss.If he hadnt been in such a crappy mood, he wouldve laughed at his own joke.He kept on hammering the nail long past when it had been driven into the wood.But he wasnt even thinking now, wasnt even trying to be productive.He was just trying to burn off the feelings that were crawling around inside him, like living things that needed to be choked out with movement.Connor?A feminine voice rose up above the hammer strikes.He turned and saw Liss standing there, her eyes wide, her face washed in light.Are you just getting home?he asked, instantly enraged.What?You.Are you just getting home?Where would I have been?I dont know.With Ace.Getting laid.For your information, asshole, I was in your kitchen getting warm milk.Not that its your business either way.If I want to have more milk, I will have more milk.And if I want to have sex, I will have that, so just...Yeah.Not at my house.He knew he was being unreasonable, and he didnt care.Because the moment she had walked in, he had pictured her with Ace, his hands on her skin, and he had seen red.What are you, my dad?You know what, you cant be my dad, because he was never around, so he didnt care who I brought home.So I dont even know what you are.* * * LISS HAD NO IDEA what had gotten under Connors skin.She had been out looking for him, because when she had realized that he hadnt come in, shed been afraid he was off somewhere drinking himself into a stupor.Frankly, she didnt trust him.Not when emotions were this close to the surface; and where the barn was concerned, clearly, there were emotions.The fact that they were standing here yelling at each other about something as stupid as him thinking she hooked up with Ace was evidence of that.The fact that he was in here at midnight putting up siding with a hammer, pounding on the board as if he wanted to put a hole in it, was yet more definitive evidence.Just your friend, who opened up his house to you, and worries about you.And who, frankly, does not want you to sleep with a skanky bartender.Since when is it your business who I sleep with?she asked.When I said it was.What is your problem?What isnt my problem?he asked, throwing his hands wide, the hammer still gripped tightly in one of his fists.His chest was bare, a golden beam from the work light throwing the muscles on his torso into sharp relief, highlighting the beads of sweat on his skin that were trailing down through the ridges of his abs.It was difficult to have a fight with somebody when you were light headed from looking at them.Things are moving.Theyre moving faster than I want.Moving on, and Im not ready, he said, dropping his arms to his sides.This barn is getting built, whether Im ready for it to be built or not.Im starting to want sex again, even though I dont really want it.Liss blinked, her heart stuttering as she absorbed his words.Wait, what?And you, he said, taking a few steps toward her, you are not helping.What again?she asked, blinking rapidly, her heart pounding so hard she was afraid she might pass out.Just think that away, onto the floor of the partially built barn.You, he said, his voice rough, and your lacy panties.I saw them in the laundry.And now I cant stop picturing you in them.Her stomach twisted into a knot, her heart thundering against her breastbone.You thought about me in my panties?I cant stop thinking about you in them.Well, I saw you in...your underwear.You didnt see me in mine.You seem fine.I am not fine.He dropped the hammer with a dull thud and took another step toward her, wrapping his arm around her waist and drawing her up against his chest.Im not fine.He raised his hand, brushing her cheekbone with his thumb.Im just not.She could hear the pain in his voice, the confusion, the plea.He wanted her to fix this, wanted her to make it better, to take away the anguish that was tearing at him from the inside out.But she couldnt.She didnt want him to stop picturing her that way.Because she didnt want him to let her go.As far as this was concerned, she didnt want it to be okay.She wanted to be different.She wanted to be everything.He needed her help, and she wanted something else entirely.She hated herself for that weakness, but she couldnt fight it.And she didnt move away from him.Im not fine, either, she said, her voice small.For a moment he just looked at her, his chest rising and falling with each breath, his eyes glittering.Then he moved.Fuck, he said, just before his mouth covered hers.Liss was glad that he was holding on to her, because if he hadnt been, she wouldve crumpled straight to the ground.Years of fantasies could not have prepared her for the reality of Connors lips on hers.It was new, and it was familiar in the most beautiful way.Like Christmas.Different all the time and somehow the same.With surprises and tradition all wrapped into one.That was kissing Connor.His scent surrounding her, so familiar, but mingling together now with his flavor.She had never tasted him before, and it was the most wonderful thing.The most perfect thing.He angled his head, sliding his tongue across the seam of her mouth as she opened to him, sighing as his tongue moved against hers.She wrapped her arms around his neck, pressed herself hard up against him and kissed him back with all of the repressed enthusiasm that had been building inside her since shed first imagined what it might be like to taste his lips.He was everything.The sunset on the ocean, the salt breeze through the pine trees, a burst of the seasons first ripe blackberry on her tongue.He tasted like heartbreak and hope, and it made her ache down so deep it was physical pain.He shifted their positions and cupped her face, the kiss intensifying.His mouth was firm, his beard rasping against her skin, his tongue slick against hers.The depth to the kiss, the intensity of it...it couldnt be anyone but him.Shed spent years studying his lips, and now she finally knew what it felt like to have them beneath hers.Shed talked to him, but shed never heard him groan like he did as she swept her tongue across his bottom lip.She knew him, as well as a friend could ever know another friend, and yet, she hadnt known what he sounded like when he was aroused.But she did now.And it was better than anything.Better than ice cream.When he pulled away from her, she was shaking, a strange, sick feeling in the pit of her stomach.Terror mingling with desire, excitement, adrenaline.She didnt know what to say; she didnt know what to do.She wanted to lean in and kiss him again, and she wanted to run away.She couldnt really do both at the same time.Unless she kissed him really quickly and then ran for the hills.There was no question that she had just revealed a hell of a lot.Because you didnt kiss a guy like that if you hadnt thought about it before.If you hadnt thought about it for years and years, over and over again.But he had kissed her back.And even though he was looking at her now as if she had sprouted a second head, the fact remained he had instigated this.And he had thought about her in her panties.She didnt want to speak, because that would mean the moment was over.And it was a moment she had spent so many years waiting for, she didnt think she could face the end of it.But she did have to deal with the fact that this could very well be the end of the moment.Because he wasnt moving toward her again.Didnt look like he was leaning in for another kiss.Didnt look like he would extend his hands to her and lead her to his bedroom.A shiver ran through her body.She wanted to go to his bedroom.She just let the thought sit there, fully formed, acknowledged.She wanted to go to Connors bedroom.She wanted more of what had just happened.She wanted him naked, wanted to touch him everywhere, taste him everywhere.Once would never be enough.One touch of his mouth against hers was nothing more than a glimpse at paradise.How could she go back now that shed experienced this?Connor was fantasy made flesh.And now that she knew desire like this was real and living, how could she ever go back to what shed accepted before?This was heat and fire, the kind that left scorched earth and devastation in its wake.The kind that reshaped everything it touched.Too soon it was over.Sorry, he said, taking a step away from her.It was over.That step backward made it official.She hated it.Hated that she was only going to kiss Connor once.She had spent a very long time accepting the fact that she was never going to kiss him at all.But this was worse.Dont apologize, she said.It sucks.That was probably too honest.She should stop talking.She should go back into the house and not say anything.She should just say it was okay and nod along when he said it shouldnt happen again, that their friendship was too important.Because it shouldnt, and their friendship was too important.But she didnt want to have that conversation.And she didnt want to nod along.Seeing as she didnt agree.I just grabbed you and kissed you.We dont kiss.If that doesnt merit an apology, Im not really sure what does.Just dont say youre sorry you kissed me.Because Im not sorry.Why arent you sorry?he asked.I liked it.The words hung there between them, like dust in the air, highlighted by the work light, swirling around them.You liked it?Yeah, she said, shrugging a shoulder.I havent been kissed in a while.And you didnt kiss Ace.No, I did not kiss Ace.I didnt even want to.In spite of the fact that it has been a long time since Ive been kissed.But you wanted to kiss me?He looked so confused, and if she didnt feel so conflicted, so tied up in knots, it mightve been funny.Well, I wasnt opposed to the idea.He lifted his hands then lowered them, slapping them on his thighs.What does...Well, what the hell does that mean?I dont know.She started picking at the remnants of pink polish on her thumbnail.Does it have to mean anything?Does a kiss ever mean...nothing?I think sometimes it just means that people like to kiss.That sounded lame.Well, but usually it means people have certain feelings.Things they want to do that are kissing.That are more than kissing.This is the most awkward conversation Ive ever had, she said.Well, how is it supposed to be not awkward?Weve spent a lot of years not kissing.And then I kissed you.It wouldve been a lot easier if you wouldve just let me sweep it under the rug with an apology.I know.But I didnt feel like it.Liss, you are a pain in the ass.Well, thank you, Connor.You kissed me and then you called me a name.The state of our friendship is a little bit weird at the moment.Connor put his hands on his head.I know.I think theres something weird happening to me.He let out a long breath and relaxed his arms again.There has been for a long time.And I think something is happening, with you living with me, and it having been...a while.Three years.So its proximity, then.That hurt.Probably.What else could it be?Ouch again.Nothing, she said, leaving it at that.Anything else would be admitting that her attraction was long standing, and his, apparently wasnt.If he was even really attracted to her.He hadnt really said.He was talking about sex deprivation and proximity, which wasnt the same thing.We should forget this.Apparently, Im kind of dangerous when I dont drink.He also had some spark back.A little bit of wildness, like the Connor he used to be.She liked it.She liked it a whole lot better.No, dont do that.If its a choice between drinking or making out, I think you should just make out with me.Her aim had been to make him laugh.But he wasnt laughing.Instead, his eyes caught hers, a serious light in them.A predatory light.Connor had never looked at her that way before.It made her feel light headed, made her feel like maybe that step back hadnt meant the end, after all.Medicinal making out?Liss swallowed hard, feeling dizzy.Sure.What scares me is the hangover, he said, his tone grave.Yeah, that was the thing that scared her, too.Because the kissing was fine, and she was sure sex would be better.The aftermath was the concern.It made her feel panicky, made her feel like a wild beast was clawing at her insides.Possibly Kates wolverine.Yeah.Those can be a bitch.Im well acquainted.He extended his hand, fingertips drifting over her cheek.We should go inside, he said, breaking contact with her.Suddenly, she was freezing.Her teeth chattered, and she wrapped her arms around her midsection.Good idea, she said.It was very inconvenient that she and Connor had to go back to the same place tonight.She needed distance.She needed it badly.Because depending, she had a feeling she could be easily convinced to run away screaming into the night, or fall right into his arms and spend the night screaming with him, in his bed.Oh, boy.They were both still standing there, neither of them making a move to go in.We should go, he said again.Good idea, she repeated.I dont know why its hard, he said.Liss tried to hold back the laugh that built in her chest, but she was unsuccessful.It burst out, somewhere between a snort and a sputter.Thats what she said.Really, Liss?Im sorry.Im so inappropriate.This is really uncomfortable.And I guess when things get uncomfortable, I figure you might as well add a penis joke.Connor turned away from her and started out of the barn.What?At least this is more normal.She trailed after him, pleased that somehow she had managed to break the tension, even if it was accidental.It is that, he said, not turning back to look at her.They walked on for a while, not saying anything.If you didnt have anything non penis related to say, you shouldnt say anything at all.Or something.The house came into view, the porch light off, the only light provided by the moon.Connor walked up the steps, his hands shoved in his pockets.Liss hung back.He looked at her, his expression serious.You can come in.Im not going to jump you.Good to know, she said, walking up the stairs and joining him on the porch.I didnt really think you were going to.She had a feeling there was a much higher chance of her jumping him.Well, good, Im glad you realize that.I trust you, Connor.Im not sure you should, he said.Connor, let me tell you something.I dont even know my dad.I think he sent a card once, but I dont know for sure, because my mom took it and burned it.She never could separate what happened between them from my relationship with him.It would have been one thing if she had been angry at him because of the way he ignored me, but that was never it.She was just never over the fact that he didnt stay with her.That he didnt take care of her.Unlike my dad, shes always been there.But shes never hesitated to tell me how difficult Ive made her life.Being a single mom is hard, and she made sure I knew.But I did learn very quickly that there were ways I could make things easier.When I kept the house clean, when I got myself to school, things were easier.And...Liss swallowed hard; she was embarrassed to tell him the next part, not because the story was embarrassing, but the level of emotion she still felt about it was.This is going to sound really stupid.But remember how I didnt go to senior prom?Vaguely.I was kind of over prom, since Id already been to mine and as a graduate it all felt like kid stuff to me, but it was important to Jessie, so I went.Well, I wanted to go.I was waiting tables at The Crows Nest to save up to buy this dress that I saw at the bridal store.With hindsight, and some maturity, I think it was a very ugly dress.She didnt.She still thought it was beautiful.Cotton candy pink with spaghetti straps, clear beads on the bodice and heavy satin skirt.And if she ever saw it, she would buy it.Just because she could.Anyway, I saved up for a few months for that prom dress.And I bought it.I put it in my room, still in the little plastic garment bag, hanging on the outside of my closet so I could look at it whenever.Then, like, three days before prom, my mom saw the dress and got really upset.She started telling me about all these problems.The car wasnt working well, and our power bill was really big.And I shouldnt spend my money on something like that.She said I needed to help around the house more, because she did so much for me.I was so angry at her, and at myself.I knew she was manipulating me.And I knew there was nothing I could do about how it made me feel.Connor grimaced.Liss...I returned it.And I gave my mom the money I had saved.The night of the prom, we went out.We had hamburgers and milk shakes.She was happy with me.And that is what I have to do to have a relationship with her.But you dont do that to me.And thats why I trust you.So dont tell me that I shouldnt.She paused, her heart up in her throat.Youre the best I have.Oh, Liss, he said, taking a step toward her, wrapping his arm around her waist, drawing her in for a hug.It was just a dress.He moved his hand over her back slowly, the motion so unintentionally erotic she was besieged by both guilt and arousal.Its not, though.He was right.It wasnt just a dress.It was yards of pink satin as a metaphor for her mother daughter relationship.Or maybe for her life.She certainly hadnt been any better off living with Marshall than she had been with her mother.He always needed something, always wanted something.Always something she needed to sacrifice to make his life easier, so that she was fulfilling her position as girlfriend to the best of her ability.And still, no matter how much she had given, it never seemed as if it was enough.Marshall had taken off with the truck she had bought with him for heavens sake.She cleared her throat.Yeah, well, its easier if its just a dress.Yeah, I get that.Suddenly, she became very aware of his heart beating hard against her chest, of the heat of his body, the strength in his hold.She should move away from him, but she didnt want to.So instead, she leaned into him, resting her head on his shoulder.Liss shifted in Connors hold, pressed her cheek against his chest, could feel his heart rate start to speed up.And along with that, she could feel...She wiggled a little bit, trying to see if she could force her hip into more definitive contact with what she was almost certain was a very inappropriate erection.She felt his muscles go rigid, felt him freeze.And now she was completely certain.Connor?What?He sounded strained, like he was in pain.Do you...I mean...He moved away from her, his hands up as he backed away.Sorry.She stood there for a second, feeling stunned.As if shed been slapped upside the head with a piece of barn siding.And then, before her brain could catch up with her body, a decision was made.She started to close the distance between them, and he took another step away.But she reached out, looped her arm around the back of his neck, her momentum propelling him back against the side of the house, her chest flush against his.Then she stretched up on her tiptoes and closed the distance between them.Connor growled, lacing his fingers through her hair and pulling her more tightly against him.This was different than the kiss in the barn; this wasnt a test.This was rough, intense.Angry.Both of them realized that a horse had been let out of the gate, and they couldnt figure out how to put it back.He reversed their positions, pushing her back against the wall, pressing the erection that had started it all hard against her stomach.She moaned, biting his lower lip, because she wasnt quite able to help herself.Shed never done anything like that before.And under normal circumstances, she might have felt a little bit embarrassed about it, or at least a little bit afraid that the guy hadnt liked it.But she wasnt, not with him.Because there was no doubt based on the sound he made, based on the way he tightened his hold on her hair, that he had enjoyed it.And this was Connor, and she knew how to read him better than any other person on the planet.She slid her hands down the front of his chest, relishing the feel of his bare skin, his muscles.He was so hot, and hard and perfect.He was so everything a man should be, and nothing she had ever had before.Marshall had been a backseat driver, in life and in bed.He had no trouble asking her to do things differently, but he never took control.Connor suffered no such problem.Connor led by example.And it was a very good example.Liss let her fingers drift over the ridges of muscle on his abs then reached to the side, feeling around for the doorknob.She managed to get the door open, and let them both inside, still kissing him.She was dizzy now, but really, who needed air?She was kissing Connor Garrett.She didnt need anything else.They half stumbled to the couch, Liss landing on his lap, her thighs on either side of his.Connor put his hands on her waist, sliding them upward, beneath the hem of her top.She wrenched her mouth from his, a gasp escaping her lips.He released his hold on her and gripped the front of her T shirt, tugging the neckline downward, revealing a healthy amount of cleavage, and the tops of her lacy bra cups.Damn, he said, the word like a prayer.He leaned in, pressing his lips to her breasts, before tracing the line where fabric met skin with the tip of his tongue.This was getting a lot further a lot faster than she had imagined it might.Well, the truth was, she hadnt really thought ahead the moment she had decided to kiss him out on the porch.And in her imagination, in her fantasies past, things had always been hazy.Sensual, but hazy.There was a limit to how deep and detailed she could go with her fantasies about him and still look him in the eye the next day.This, while sensual, was not at all hazy.It was sharp, to the point of pain, pleasure so acute it twisted into something decidedly different, wholly unique, like she had never felt before.She slid forward on his lap, her knees hitting the back of the couch, bringing her into very decisive contact with his arousal.Need pierced her, and she rocked her hips against him, need rolling through her like a wave.She reached between them, fumbling with his belt buckle.When did she get so clumsy?When did basic things like undoing belts become a near impossibility?Maybe around the time getting a belt open had started to feel like a life and death situation.Connor, she said, panting, and not even caring that she was, Connor, I need...I need...Before she could get the words out, he had pulled her shirt up over her head in one efficient movement while working at the clasp of her bra with his other hand.He seemed to be having as much trouble as she was.New plan, you get the belt, Ill get the bra, she said.His hands immediately went down to his belt buckle.Works for me, he said.She unhooked her bra and tossed it to the side, and Connor froze.You, belt.I held up my end of the deal.I cant...I. ..Just a second.He cupped her breasts, sliding his hands beneath them, pushing them together before releasing his hold, watching her intently.Fuck.He leaned in, tracing the outline of her nipple with the tip of his tongue before sucking it in deep, his tongue slick, his whiskers burning her sensitive skin in the very best way.She arched her back, rocking her hips forward, chasing the climax that was building, strong and low inside her.Then she looked down, and the sight almost sent her over the edge.Connor.This was Connor.Finally.He lifted his head, his dark eyes meeting hers.Sorry about that.Its been three years since Ive seen actual breasts in person.And breasts are, like, my favorite thing.Your breasts specifically are my favorite thing right now.Heat assaulted her cheeks.Could you stop apologizing to me every time you do something that feels amazing?Otherwise youre going to be groaning an apology about the time I make you come.You have to stop talking right now, or it wont be long until the apology happens.He reached down and undid his belt buckle, sliding his pants down his hips, leaving his underwear in place.She reached down, sliding her hand over the black fabric, feeling the hard ridge of his cock.She nearly whimpered.She had hit the jackpot.She would have wanted Connor either way; she had for enough years that she could honestly say size didnt matter.But it turned out he was extremely impressive, and she found she was very happy about that.She moved her palm over his length, squeezing him gently.He let his head fall back, air hissing through his teeth.She lifted the waistband of his underwear and slipped her fingers beneath, making contact with his skin.She wanted to freeze this moment.This moment, where she was touching him for the very first time.Arousal and emotion curled around her stomach, twisting it tight.She had her hand wrapped around Connors cock.And the thought alone was enough to send her straight to the edge.She pushed his underwear down, pulling him out so she could see him.Oh, Connor.She slid off his lap, getting on her knees in front of him, her hands planted on his thighs.His gaze was intent on hers, his jaw clenched tight.If all she had was tonight, and she feared very much it was all she would have, then she was going to fulfill her every fantasy.Yes, she would love to believe this would be the start of something lasting.Would love to believe this was only the first of a thousand times.But she wasnt quite that naive.Tomorrow the sun would rise.The light would clear up the fog that had settled between them, and they would be left with trying to figure out what to do with their friendship.With trying desperately to get things back to the way they were.She didnt mind that she still had a light grasp on reality.It made her more determined to take this moment and make it everything.Everything she had always wanted.She curled her fingers around his shaft and leaned in; keeping her eyes on his, she flicked her tongue over the head of his cock.He gripped her hair and tugged her head up.Liss, I dont...What?He couldnt stop it now.He could not stop her now.Ive never...I dont...She froze.Well, you arent a virgin, that I know.He didnt say anything for a moment, his expression pained, the tendons in his neck standing out.Ive never had anyone do that before.A shock wave rolled through her body, immobilizing her.Then she shook it off, fantasy taking hold and blunting reality just enough.Okay.Well, youre about to.Were going to talk about this later.Right now Im not interested in talking.* * * LISS LEANED IN, picking up where she had left off, sliding her tongue over the head of his cock before tilting her head and taking him in deep, moving her hand in time with her mouth.Connor kept his hand buried in her hair, his fingers clenched into a fist.His best friend in the entire world had his cock in her mouth.And all he could do was sit there, his fingers tangled in her hair, and think one word over and over again.Fuck fuck fuck fuck.He only wished he had let her get this far before he had gone and confessed that he was a blow job virgin.Hell, he wished he hadnt confessed at all.It was a stupid thing.A stupid thing hed never worried all that much about.Until, of course, a woman unexpectedly got on her knees in front of him.Then it seemed like a big freaking deal.A huge deal.She made a satisfied, throaty sound as she took him in deeper, the slick friction of her tongue over his skin almost too much to handle.But then, this was the first time anyone had put their hands on him in three years.The first time anyone had put their mouth on him in ever.His stomach muscles tightened, fire roaring through his veins.He was dangerously close to coming, and he didnt want to.Not yet.Liss...She shifted position, gripping the base of his shaft with her hand, tilting her head and sliding her tongue along the length of him.He released his hold on her hair, sifting it through his fingers, watching as the copper strands caught the light.Gold, red and deep brown all highlighted by the lamp near the couch.And her skin, so pale and pretty and very, very bare.He looked down at the elegant line of her back, at the hint of her ass, visible thanks to her position, and her very low cut jeans.She straightened slightly, still teasing him with her tongue, her breasts visible now, her pink nipples tight, so perfect.Desire built in him, the heat in his blood intensifying, drawing close to a boil.And he knew he couldnt fight it any longer.Liss, he said, her name a plea now.Because he needed her to stop or else he was going to lose all control.She looked at him, those golden eyes lit with a matching fire to the one that burned through him.She knew.Knew he was close to losing it.But she didnt stop.He closed his eyes, tightening his hold on her hair, embracing the release that was roaring through him as she continued to slide her hand over his length, drawing his release out of him in long, slow waves of pleasure.When his blood cooled, his vision coming back into focus, he looked at her.Fuck.Hed come all over her tits like some kind of animal.Oh, shit, he said, unable to catch his breath.Liss blinked.Dont apologize.Dammit, he had been about to apologize.Because who the hell did that?Who lost their control like that?Who just did that to a woman without even talking about it first?He certainly didnt.His first reaction was to apologize, because he couldnt imagine her feeling anything but disgust.This wasnt a good idea, he said.Liss recoiled, getting to her feet, scrambling for her T shirt.She picked it up and held it over her breasts, her expression fierce.Okay, so thats nice.This is a bad idea after you get your orgasm?No, it was a bad idea from the beginning.He expected a fight; he expected her to get mad.Instead, her shoulders sagged, a sadness that made him ache filling her eyes.You know what?Obviously, it was a bad idea.We werent thinking.Like we discussed in the barn, its been a long time for both of us.She gestured toward him.Apparently, its been forever for you, for that.And...and...I need a shower.Of course she did.And it was his fault.Because she had to wash him off her.She turned and walked out of the room, and Connor stood, doing his pants back up, pacing the length of the room.He was such an asshole.Hed let all of his sick fantasies get out of hand, and then it had ended up like that.With him completely disrespecting his best friend.With him taking advantage of her.His brain rebelled against his revision of the events, trying to remind him that out on the porch Liss had been the one to kiss him.But it butted up against his desire to cast himself as the bad guy.So he dismissed it.Because he was comfortable as the bad guy.This was what he did.He let people down.He fucked stuff up.And Liss was no exception, apparently.He pushed his hand through his hair and walked into the kitchen, on a hunt for alcohol.It had been a few days.But hammering apparently didnt fix anything.Jack Daniels didnt, either.Not permanently.But it made for a nice temporary haze.And he needed that.More than anything.Needed something to keep him from going into Lisss room and finishing what theyd started.He took a glass down from the cabinet, and for the first night in weeks, Connor Garrett poured himself a drink.IN LISSS OPINION, the morning after should come with a whole lot more buzz than this.But then, in her opinion, the night before should have concluded in an entirely different manner.Instead, the entire day had been filled with the sound of clattering dishes, awkward no eye contact greetings and a whole lot of scampering around each other like frightened cats when they had accidental encounters.And yay, hooray, tonight was the poker game.Which meant they were going to have to take this awkward little show on the road, in front of all their friends and family.She felt as though she had a stamp on her forehead that said I totally sucked my friends dick.The strangest thing was, she still didnt regret it.Or maybe, it wasnt that strange.How could she regret the culmination of half a lifetimes worth of fantasies?Well, culmination was a strong word.There was still unfinished business.Namely the fact that he had gotten off and she hadnt.Watching him come had certainly been an aphrodisiac, but she would have really liked a little bit of that action herself.She should be more regretful.She really should be.But it was hard, with the memory of Connors lips, and Connors...other things, still fresh in her mind.Well, when she was by herself she wasnt regretful.But the idea of seeing him again in a few minutes, with a room full of other people, made her slightly regretful.She wasnt entirely sure what insanity had exploded between them.Wasnt sure what had dropped the invisible barrier that had always been there, stripping them of their inhibitions and their clothes.She closed her eyes and imagined him as hed been last night.What it had been like to be on her knees in front of him.And he had never had...No one had ever...She didnt even understand how that was possible.How could any woman resist that?She and Jessie had never talked about her and Connors sex life because Liss was not a masochist.So shed had no idea her friend had hang ups about oral sex.Dear Lord, why was she going there now?It was just that she didnt understand.And she was obsessing about it now.Obsessing about the fact that she was the first to ever go down on him.Is the oven preheated?She jumped as Connor came into the room, knocking over the stack of red plastic cups that she was next to.Yeah, she said.Good.I want to have everything ready when people get here.Yes, because this is the classiest of dinner parties.We dont want peoples beer to get warm while they await their frozen pizza.Theres chips and salsa.Everyone will live.Good, she said.Their eyes met and held.It was the first time all day.She regretted it instantly.Now she really wished everybody would just hurry up and get here.She heard the front door open, and she almost groaned with relief.In here!she said.Heavy footsteps crossed the wood floor, and then Jack appeared in the doorway of the kitchen.Im here to take your money, he said.Now give me a beer.Get your own, Connor said, and Liss was nothing but grateful to have a buffer between her and her best friend.She could honestly say it was the first time she had ever been pleased about that.Is the ice bucket out?Yes, Connor said, but there isnt any beer in it yet.You can make yourself useful, Jack.How about that for a change of pace?Well, I dont have much experience with that, Jack said, shrugging, but I can try.Jack walked over to the fridge and opened it, bending down and pulling out a few bottles of beer.So I spent my day dealing with sperm.How was your workday?Lisss head whipped to the side, and her gaze collided with Connors.Then looked away.What?We artificially inseminated one of my horses today, Jack said, straightening, two beer bottles in each hand.And that was way closer to that sort of thing than Ive ever wanted to be.It feels mean, really, making it all such a sterile process.But its cheaper to ship frozen horse semen than it is to ship the horse.Connor winced.Could you stop saying that word?And words related to it?You run a ranch, Garrett.I wouldve thought you had a little more fortitude than that.Yeah, normally he did, and Liss knew it.Though it was a little bit trickier to be discussing these topics considering what happened last night.Man, I just let a bull loose in the field and he can have at it, Connor said, holding his hands up.I dont order containers of champion baby gravy.Because you raise these guys for meat.Im breeding champions.
