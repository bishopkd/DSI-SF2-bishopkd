Shoulders back, chin up, daring the whole world to take their best shot.It was impossible not to admire her guts.She got in her car and started down the driveway toward the Springfield Police Station.She was really going to do it.Pride warred with his anger.He wasnt upset about the money or the old men.Hell, he almost felt sorry for her and the load of guilt she carried over her mistakes.Alone was no way to die, and shed brought some happiness to those men in their last days.Maybe hed see it differently if it was his old man and his money getting conned by a pretty blonde with a great rackbut he doubted it.Truth be told, if he were dying alone somewhere, hed like a woman like Tara coming to read him the Sports page.No, the wellspring of his anger was that she had brought Dennisthis threatto bear against his family.His sister.His nephew.And she had lied and would have kept on lying about it if he hadnt forced the truth out of her.And that she honestly thought he was going to sit back and do nothing while Dennis circled like a vulture was ludicrous.She didnt know him.At all.He tapped the business card in his hand against the window.Gary Thiele, the private investigator whod uncovered Tara Jeans real name.Funny, hed thought at the time that her name change was the worst of her crimes.He grabbed his phone and dialed the number.It was time to find out a little bit more about Dennis Murphy.Those episodes of CSI: Miami she used to watch had misled her.The kindly receptionist at the front desk at the Springfield Police Station had to direct her to the county courthouse in Wassaw to get the protection orderit wasnt even called a restraining order in Texas.You just couldnt trust TV anymore for a proper education.A forty minute drive later, and a very bored county clerk had her fill out three forms and then made copies at a glacial pace.Your hearing will be in two weeks; after that, Dennis Murphy will be notified of the protection order.Two weeks?Is this an immediate problem?He just got out of jail and he threatened to rape me.And beat me.So, you know, the sooner the better.The clerk gave her another form and told her to wait in the corner for the judge to see her.So far no one had doubted her.No one had suggested that maybe shed asked for the abuse.No one had asked about her past.CSI: Miami had led her to believe some smarmy redheaded cop was going to interrogate her.So, all in all, she was feeling pretty good about this protection order business.An hour later, she was led into an office where a man in half glasses sat behind a large desk.He gestured to the chair in front of him and Tara sat, relieved that this very long, very bizarre day was about to end without parading the ghosts of her past.But then Judge Phillips looked at her over the edge of those half glasses and despite the air conditioning, sweat bloomed across her chest, pooling and running down her back.Her legs stuck to the chair.So, Judge Phillips asked, how exactly do you know Dennis Murphy?For a moment, her mouth dry, and she considered lying.Because the good judge was a grandfather.Pictures of gap toothed kids covered his desk, and he might be fifteen years younger than the men shed stolen from but he wasnt stupid.Hed put himself in the shoes of those four men, and she couldnt face it.Couldnt face herself.But then she thought about Jacob and Victoria.Denniss erection against her belly.Those leather samples hanging up in her studio.Luc.She had something to protect.Something to fight for.And shed promised and she wanted, for the first time in her life, for her word to mean something.She unfisted her hands, opened her mouth, and forced the story out.Two hours later she parked her Honda in front of the ranch and stared at the building, so ugly in the sunlight.Luc, sitting on the steps, slowly stood.Waiting for her.Unbelievably, she felt tears gather behind her eyes.Dont be ridiculous, she told herself, and picking up her purse, and the tattered edges of her pride, she climbed out of the car.Hes not waiting for you.Hes waiting to make sure you did what you said youd do.Hes waiting on behalf of his family.Not for you.Never for you.How did it go?he asked once she was close.Grateful for her sunglasses, she tilted up her face.Within the next twenty four hours Dennis will be served with a temporary ex parte protective order.He blinked.Nodded.Thats good.Good?she thought, emotion boiling inside her stomach.None of this was good.Im going inside.What about the other stuff.Did you tell them?The words in her mouth were too heavy and they tasted like iron and tears.She had thought, stupidly, that going into that police station and the courthouse and telling someone what shed done would make her feel cleaner.Feelforgiven.But instead she felt worse.Sick.So sick of herself she couldnt stand it.There was no forgiveness for her.I did.The words slid out of her mouth with barely a sound.What did they say?She remembered the way Judge Phillipss smile had gone flat, the way hed looked at her.Like she was something he wished he could lock away.Its not a crime to accept a gift.But the police are going to check in the cities where those men lived to see if there are any files opened under my name by people who caught on to what I did.That must have been hard.You think?Her voice cracked and she shook her head, needing to get up to her room and under the blankets of her bed so that she could just hide for awhile, but he touched her hand, his fingers sliding around her wrist.She had no shell anymore and she felt that touch all the way through her body.His warmth, his strength, the calluses on his fingers.It was the kitchen all over again and she was transfixed.When he pulled off her sunglasses, she didnt have the strength to push him away.To tell him to go to hell.She could only stand there and feel him.Im proud of you, he whispered.The tears fell.And he reached up to touch them, his face broken with sympathy, but she yanked herself away.That makes one of us, she said and ran into her room, wherefully dressedshe climbed under the covers of her bed.The knock on the door that night was unwelcome and so she ignored it.When it persisted, she fished under her bed for a shoe, which she pitched at the door.The bang made her flinch, but afterward it was silent.And then another knock.What?she barked.The doorknob turned and she stared up at the ceiling, pissed that she hadnt thought to lock the damn thing.Luc, go away, I dont need a Boy Scout It wasnt Luc in the doorway.It was the boy.Jacob.His black curls were growing long, the tips touching the edge of his red Spiderman T shirt.He stood there, held still by her gaze.But she couldnt stand to look at him, as if he were a too bright light against a black sky.When she sat up, he moved toward the bed.A quick shuffle step.What do you want?Her bark stopped him in his tracks.Im sorry, he murmured.About the whoopee cushion.Your mom got mad at you, huh?She smiled slightly and the boy brightened, as if she were opening a door for him to step through.And maybe she was.Maybe she was just that alone.Took away my Gameboy.She hummed in sympathy.Ruby said you like these.He stepped up to the bed, and she braced herself as best she could, but she had nothing to push the boy away with.No nasty words.No shell.Not even a stick.Nothing.So she could only sit there and try not to cry.Go away, she silently begged.Please, Jacob, dont get close.Please just go away.Here.He put something on her knee.Finally, she looked over at him, his face shimmery and magnified through her tears.Are you sad?he asked.She nodded.Because of the whoopee cushion?It was so ridiculous she laughed, and the tears spilled hot over her cheeks.No, she whispered.Not because of the whoopee cushion.She wiped her face and saw the box of candy on her knee.Mike and Ikes.Fresh tears burned in her eyes.Thank you, she said.Theyre my favorite.His smile, generated by the very specific gladness that hed made her happy, that hed done something for her that was good and appreciated, tore through the room, illuminating the dark that surrounded her.I used to feel that way, she thought, dimly.Reading to those old men.Finding their favorite socks.Filling in the crossword puzzles.It didnt make it right, but she had enjoyed that part of it.That part had been honest.Its my favorite candy, too, he said, nodding seriously, as if they were discussing modern art.But I only like the yellows.She blinked at him, doubting shed heard him right.The yellows?He nodded, launching into some rationale she didnt hear, because she was trying to figure out how to reject this gift.Because she was unsure of where it came from or what it meant.She wanted to pick it apart.Find the strings, the hidden angles.But he was a kid.Just a kid.And maybe, maybe it would be okay to accept one thing at face value.There was no forgiveness for her.She understood that, accepted it.But maybe there could be salvation.All that innocence shed pushed away since shed lost her own, maybe if she let it back in, let it swirl around her and lift her to someplace bettermaybe she could find some redemption.Dont, the demon warned, her voice a sharp crack against the inside of her head.Not for you.This is not for you!But she ignored the demon and ripped open the box.The oblong candy spilled everywhere, down the hills of her knees, across the plains of the bedspread.She picked up three yellows and held them out to him in the cupped palm of her hand.Go ahead, she said with a shaky shrug.I dont like the yellows.Really?Thats funny.His little fingers grabbed them, their touch sending sparks across her hand, right into her black and broken heart, where a hundred locks were sprung open.And for the first time since she turned sixteen, she realized she was free.Free of Dennis.Free of fear.For a moment she thought she might just soar up to the ceiling.Up past the roof, into that wide blue sky.You okay?Jacob asked.Youre crying.Am I?She laughed, she couldnt help it.Freedom tasted like sugar, felt like a kids sweaty palm in hers.And for all her grief and all her regrets, she was suddenly very proud that shed arrived at this moment.She pushed the blankets off her body, no longer willing to hide.Lets go do something, she said to Jacob, who blinked up at her.What?I dont know, what do you like to do?Draw stuff.She laughed.Perfect.Absolutely perfect.20 Friday morning, the workshop was a beehive of activity.The three models stood at the back sorting through the samples in their sizes.Edna and Joyce were unloading their equipment.Edna had dried up gunk on the shoulder of her shirt from one of her babies.As if it werent regurgitated body fluids, she laughed and tried to flake it off.Tara Jean rolled her eyes.Honestly.Well start with tops.Tara pulled out her binder and everyone quieted down and started to work.After Jacobs visit three days ago, shed thrown herself into work with all the fervor of the converted.This business, the winter line, the Baker Leather stores and brand, would be her new life.This would be her last fresh start; this would become who she was, and shed do it right or die trying.Tara directed the models to the privacy screen she had for just this purpose.Maggie, the large model, didnt have much modesty, and she stripped naked in front of everyone.Over the last few years, Tara Jean had grown as accustomed to the sight of Maggies freckled breasts as she had to Ednas face.But Rubys niece, Maria, was shy, and she ducked behind the privacy screen.As did Lucia, the medium model, who worked very very hard at staying a medium.Tara Jean smiled at her assembled crew and pushed aside any doubt or grief.This was her world now.All hers.The models came out wearing the white leather bustier, and Tara and the seamstresses descended.Tara Jean didnt even hear Celeste walk in until they got to the purple blazer.Its too short, Celeste said, her calm accented voice settling down over the crowd like a net, stopping all work.Excuse me?Tara Jean asked, caught off guard.She was trying to refit the blazer on Maggie, but it wasnt working.Celeste walked down the center island to stand next to her.It needs to hit here.Celeste drew a line on Maggies hip a few centimeters past where the purple hem sat awkwardly.And this buttonits too low.She put her hand between the single button at Maggies waist and all but cupped the womans breasts.The girls are running wild.It took less than a second for Tara to see that Celeste was right.The jacket didnt look right, not because of the fit, but because of the design.Christ, even Edna was nodding!Were fitting, Tara said through her teeth, glancing at the other models to see if the problem ran across all the sizes.It did.Damn it.Not designing.She shook her head, angry that shed bothered to defend herself.What are you doing here?I was curious.Well, you can leave.I dont think so.Celeste circled Maria, who nearly quaked in front of the imperial bullshit she was laying down.Stop intimidating my models.Suddenly, realization dawned, and Tara laughed with evil delight.Are you here because you thought I needed a small model?Oh my God, are you here to work for me?Celestes smile was short and sharp.Dont be ridiculous.You cant afford me.Did your son send you to check up on me?My son is and always has been focused on one thing.Hockey.He doesnt care about this venture.Celeste stood in front of Maria and smiled.Your skin is lovely, she said, and Marias face began to glow.Just put your shoulders back a little bit, yes.She touched Maria gently between the shoulder blades.And shift your legs like so.There.Maria slowly transformed from a nervous girl to a young woman with some power.Some bearing.Celeste stepped up to Maggie, the forty year old redhead covered in freckles, whose blue eyes rivaled the Texas sky in summer.Again Celeste smiled, and Maggie grinned.You dont scare me, Maggie said, and Tara snorted.Maggie was the mother of six boys and she rehabilitated horses in her spare time.Nothing scared her.Celeste put a hand under Maggies chin and amazingly, Maggie didnt bite her.That is because you are magnificent.But you could use a better bra.Tara Jean watched with a strange wonder as Celeste came back to stand in front of her.So help me, Tara raised a finger, if you touch me or talk about my bra, were going to have words.Celeste laughed, the sound a surprising bark.Very un Celeste like.My son may not care.Celeste tipped her head sideways, the look on her face unreadable, and Tara wondered if that was French.It seemed French.But I find I aminterested.Youre kidding.Im not.And I have no intention of interfering, but perhaps anopinion.She arched an eyebrow.When its required?Tara waited for a second.And then another.The truth was, Celeste had been a high fashion model; any involvement she might have in this company could only be a good thing.In terms of sales, of course.And maybe design.Oh no!the demon said.No you dont, honey, we dont need her.You can do this by yourself, remember?With my help, you dont need anyone else.Tara ignored the demon.Having Celeste here could be interesting.Unlesswell, unless Celeste thought her opinion was required more often than it really was.You have no stock in this company, Tara Jean felt obligated to remind her.Actually, she felt obligated to mark her territory, but she wasnt sure where to pee in this situation.Celeste agreed.None at all.So, if you stay, its at my discretion.If I ask you to leave Off I go.Im the boss.I understand.Tara Jean shook her head in astonished envy.Celeste managed to agree with her mouth, but her whole demeanor said otherwise.No one was this womans boss.Ill sic Maggie on you if you give me grief, Tara Jean said, and Celeste laughed.That will not be necessary.Celeste walked over to one of the stools at the high counter.I will sit here and be quiet.No!the demon cried.We dont need her.We dont need anyone.Its you and me, baby.Deep down, past her guilt and her shame over the memories of her major and minor crimes, was the memory of her mother saying that.Tara Jean had already met Dennis, and Momma had been too late.Luc slammed the truck door shut and leaned against it, letting the metal take the weight off his battered bones, his sore muscles.Christ, Luc.Billy limped by.I didnt even skate the workout and I hurt.Thats the point, he thought, but didnt say.The point was to hurt now, so that in October in some overtime game against the Sabres, hed still be fast, still be strong.But, good lord, the headache!He was going to give this headache a name, try to befriend it, because as an enemy, it was kicking his ass.It was a good call getting that Jenkins kid on the ice, hes fast, but?His temper.Luc nodded.Tyler Jenkins had been easing closer and closer to the ice every day.He rarely said anything, just sat in the bleachers, his quick eyes missing nothing.Yesterday, tired of working out by himself, Luc had asked him to get on the ice.And this morning Tyler was there again.Already dressed.The kid had been eager to show off, but when Luc stripped the puck off him, the kid had gotten mad.And it got worse every time Luc outskated him until the kid had tried to check him into the boards.I can handle it, Luc said.Hes just a kid.What about the peewees?Theyre fun, arent they?Luc asked, and Billy shook his head.Youre supposed to be training, Luc.Not really, he thought.Im not supposed to be training at all.Its an hour a day, Billy.Its hardly a distraction.Fine, but you were the one talking about no distractions a week ago.Hed been talking about Tara Jean, who was still a distraction, but Luc wasnt going to discuss it.Im gonna let Ruby know were home, see what she can put together for lunch, Billy said, and stepped into the house.Luc waited until his friend was gone, because there was a chance that when he stepped forward on his noodle legs he was going to fall flat on his face.Finally, bracing himself, Luc pushed himself away from the truck and turned, coming face to face with the greenhouse.Silhouette figures crowded the windows, lifting their arms, turning on command.He heard Taras laugh, not the flirty one or the fake one.The real one, deep and rich, a sound with the smell and heft of dark coffee.That laugh stirred a reaction in him.Lust and sympathy.Curiosity.Unwanted concern.Pride.But he didnt have to be told a third time that his opinion, his help, hell, his very presence werent needed and so hed stayed away.From the ranch.From her.Tara laughed again, and this time it was followed by the sound of Celestes voice.Luc would have lifted his eyebrows in surprise if they didnt hurt.The queen and the girl from the wrong side of the tracks were swapping jokes.Go figure.A shadow detached from the darkness surrounding the door and began to walk toward the house.It took him a few seconds before he realized the shadow was his sister, her hands holding the deep V neckline of her sweater closed.Vicks?She jumped, her hand slipping.He looked away quickly, but he could still see that his sister, always perfectly dressed in layers of silk and cashmere, didnt have anything on under the sweater.What are you doing?she asked.Getting back from practice.He shook his head, wishing he could think clearly past the pain in his head and his body.What are you doing?She glanced quickly over her shoulder and then flashed him a bright smile.Nothing, she said.In fact, Im heading into Dallas later tonight.I have a date.Yesterday, the investigator had found Dennis in a sublet apartment outside Dallas.A shabby low rise totally at odds with the mans act.Luc was having Thiele watch the man while he tried to figure out what to do with this information.With Dennis?Whats wrong with Dennis?Tara told you about him.And I am not about to take the word of a known liar.She was so fiercely proud, her eyes daring him to hurt her, to take what he knew about that asshole and use it to break her all over again.He opened his mouth, but the wordshes lying to you.Hes playing you because youre so desperate and blind and the cops have a file on him an inch thick didnt come out.He would protect his sister another way.Another way that would hurt so much less and might, in the end, actually convince her.Because bringing up Tara Jean and a restraining order would send Victoria through the roof, and undoubtedly, right toward Dennis.Invite him here.What?Look, Vicks, if you really like him, I believe you.But I feel like maybe I should get to know him a bit better.Just so I can rest easy.For a moment he felt bad preying on that approval she always needed, but he knew she wouldnt be able to resist the chance to get his blessing.You would?Her smile put rocks in his stomach.Im just trying to keep you safe, he thought, rationalizing the guilt.When youre hell bent against it.Absolutely.Well put some steaks on the grill.Just let me shower.Give me two hours.Okay.Ill call him.Slowly she began to smile, a weak sunrise through clouds.She walked away and reproach ate at him.He was setting her up for disappointment.Either way this panned out, Victoria was going to get hurt.He grabbed his bag from the back of the truck and turned for the house, but was stopped by the sight of Tara Jean standing in the open door of the greenhouse.As much as he hadnt been seeing Tara Jean, hed been thinking about her plenty.But somehow, in all of his thoughts, he never did her beauty justice.She was, quite simply, breathtaking.Her hair was pulled back in a sloppy bun, and the sun hit the gold and turned it white in places, light red and brown in others.Even her hair wasnt what it seemed.His stomach growled and his head floated for a second, pushed off his neck by hunger and fatigue.Are you okay, Luc?She stepped forward, and then stopped when he scowled.Why is everyone asking me that?Because you look like shit.It was a hard workout.Youre training a lot these days, arent you?I meanI havent seen you here.Much.I got the impression you didnt want me around.Much.Silently, she licked her lips and he nearly moanedit felt like Lashenko had taken a slap shot to his skull.Your headis it bothering you?He dropped his hand, not even realizing hed been rubbing his forehead.I think this staying out of each others business thing works both ways.He slammed the car door shut.You dont have anything left to prove, Luc, she said.Youre the best I thought I was a washed up hockey player too stupid to know when to retire.Well, youre that too, she said with a half smile that unbelievably made him laugh.Maybe it was because he was so tired, worn thin in so many places, but for a moment, a second, he wished he didnt have to work so hard anymore.He wished he could sit back and look at what hed done, what hed achieved, and feel the pride he knew he should.That anyone in his right mind would feel.The woman in front of him, with all her complications, was looking at him with both pride and worry.He wondered what she saw.And why he couldnt see himself the same way.But he couldnt.There was some engine at work in him and it wouldnt let him rest.Wouldnt leave him alone.Luc, honestly, are you okay?Tara, you keep acting so concerned, I might get the wrong idea.You seem to get those anyway.Again, that slight smile, and the distance between them shrank to nothing.As angry as he was, as confused by her actions and stunned by her lack of trustunder all of that was the hard truth.He liked Tara Jean Sweet.It wasnt just desire, or curiosity.He liked her.In a way that he didnt like a lot of people.Was Victoria here?she asked, looking puzzled and so beautiful that his body, weakened by too much exercise, got hard in the space of a heartbeat.He nodded, and her shoulders fell slightly.Whyd she go?She and Dennis had a date, but I convinced her to invite him here.He cant come if Im here, she said on a sputter.The restraining orderif he comes within five hundred feet of me, hell get arrested, and hes been served.He knows that.He wont come.I know that.But Victoria She sighed and looked up at the big house, where he knew his sister was going into supreme hostess mode.Oh, Luc, she sighed.Everything I say bounces off of her.I cant convince her.I havent been able to convince her of anything since her husband ruined her life.But if Dennis shows her what an ass he ismaybe then shell believe me.This is going to hurt her, Tara said softly, her voice flush with sympathy, and Luc nodded.What else can I do, Tara?No one ever asked her opinion.Not unless it was about the width of a leather strap.Just like no one had ever expressed being proud of her.Or offered her something without expecting something in returnand yet Luc had done it over and over.A place to stay.Offering to sell the company.And she didnt even know how to show him how grateful she was.Not without getting naked.Thats sick, she thought, watching his lean face crease into a grimace.Something was bothering him and she wondered if other womennormal womenwould know how to make him feel better.Without getting naked.Shed never recognized the careful fence line Lyle had put up around her when she first moved out here four years ago.He had given her this environment where she worked, she playedwhat had Jacob called her?Bimbo Barbie?Perfect.She played the part of Bimbo Barbie with such skill that even she looked in the mirror and was fooled.And she had thrown herself into Baker Leather.Everything else was scrub brush and dirt on the other side of the fence.How to be something other than a con artist?How to feel about men, and the past?Relationships, being alone?How to feel about Jane Simmons?All of that had been gratefully pushed away.It was as if Lyle had understood how her head hurt, how her battered heart just couldnt take it anymore.And so she had lived four years inside this fence, and nowhaving told the cops about her past, having gotten rid of the Dennis threatshe realized she wanted more.Not a husband or a bunch of kids burping on her clothesbut a life.A real one.A chance to figure out who she was between Tara Jean Sweet and Jane Simmons.And what better way than with Luc?She was safe with him.As safe as she wanted to be, and he was leaving in five months to go back to his life.He could be her training wheels.Can Ican I help?she asked, and his eyes opened wide.I mean its not like she believes me, but You want to come?Eat dinner with my family?She took a deep breath and slapped down every rogue fear, every lingering ghost, and took that first step outside the fence she lived behind.If thats what youre doing.She smiled, but nerves quickly chased the smile away.He watched her, his eyes level and unreadable, and her stomach curled with humiliation.He was going to say no; shed pushed him away too many times.He knewholy hell, he knew too much about her.Why in the world would he even consider having her at his family dinner?She was the poison.He knew that.Never mind Yes.Butyou know what I did.Yeah.And you still want me there?I still want you, Tara.21 This was a nightmare of epic proportions.Three hours ago, Dennis had been excited about coming to the ranch and shed set the table with such care, her heart on fire with hope, setting out the good crystal so that it caught the end of day sunlight and threw prisms across the formal dining room.But then the sun set behind the trees.And six oclock came and went.And she stood in the dark dining room unable to turn on the lights feeling the weight of everyones expectation and disapproval pushing nails into her skin.Vicks?Luc called from the kitchen, his footsteps coming down the small hallway toward her.She couldnt face him.Couldnt face any of them.Not like this.Put on the steaks, she cried and ran to the bathroom, her cell phone gripped in her cold, clammy hands.Locking the door behind her she sat on the stool, grabbed the bluebells shed put on the windowsill in an effort to make everything lovely for Dennis, and dumped them in the garbage.And then she took a deep breath and called him.Im sorry, Dennis said, answering after the second ring.Im so sorry.Something came up.Will you be here soon?she asked, trying not to sound desperate but failing, at least to her own ears.Im sorry, Victoria.But I just cant get away.Weve had some developments on that land deal outside Phoenix and I have to drive down there tonight.Im on the road.Phoenix?Now?Its the nature of the business, Victoria.You wouldnt understand.His tone, his words rankled, setting loose the small beasts left over from her marriage.Do.Not.Condescend.To.Me.But, because she had the practice, had gotten so good she didnt even realize she was doing it until it was too late, she swallowed her protests, like a swarm of angry bees.How long will you be gone?A week.Two at the most.Shed been down this road before with Joel, and arguing, begging, and pleading for attention only got her less.I am sorry, he said.Really.I was looking forward to spending more time with you.She licked dry lips.Itsits okay.Ill talk to you later tonight.It was her brothers fault, Tara Jeans fault, but suddenly she felt suspiciously played.Orchestrated.Well see, she whispered and hung up.Victoria carefully smoothed back her hair and ran a hand down the front of her ivory silk shell, as if it were the combination to a lock.Hair in place, clothes orderly, life in control.She splashed some water over her face and then carefully applied lipstick, a little more blush.With hands that shook.He could be lying, she knew that.She was in fact terrifyingly aware that he probably was, but she couldnt help wanting to believe him.She couldnt help wanting his words to be real.In fact, staring at herself in the mirror, she was well aware that she needed to believe them.She needed a man to give her worth.She met her own eyes, so dark in the ghostly face in the mirror.I hate you, she breathed.Someone rattled the door and she jumped, dropped her phone into the sink, and swore, blinking back acidic tears.Just a second, she called.Using the cream hand towels, she dried off her phone and swung open the door.Only to find Tara Jean, like the Spanish Inquisition with a boob job, waiting for her.Instinctively, Tara Jean stepped back, because for all her silk shells and knee length skirts, Victoria looked like a nuclear bomb about to go off.Its all yours, Victoria said, trying to slide past Tara Jean.Tara Jean sidestepped in her way, and Victoria reared back as if she had been slapped.And people call me dramatic, Tara thought.Hes not coming, Victoria hissed like a cornered cat.He had to leave town.Are you happy?Tara shook her head, sympathy nearly swamping her.No.Im not.Oh, stop pretending like you care about me, or my family.No one is going to marry you and make you rich anymore.You can drop the act.I dont want to fight, Tara Jean said, feeling as if she were negotiating with a crazed gunman.I justI wanted to make sure youre okay.Bullshit.The curse was surprising.Guttural.And then, much to Taras surprise, Victoria pushed her, a sharp jab to the shoulder.The womans eyes opened wide and thenshe did it again.Hard enough to hurt a little.You dont care about me.Well, well, well, thought Tara Jean.Though it had been a while since shed been in a hair pulling catfight, it might just be what Victoria needed.In fact, Tara Jean would put money on it.She pulled off her earrings.Shed learned the hard way about big hoops.What are you doing?Victoria asked as Tara Jean braced herself against the wall to kick off her shoes.Getting ready to fight.Isnt that what you want?Id lose the necklace if I were you.Those pearls are going to be a bitch to find once I snap the string.Im not going to fight you.Victoria channeled the aghast queen pretty well, and Tara smiled.You sure?Because I think you could use it.You have no idea what I need, Victoria said, and Tara sobered.This wasnt funny, and a fightjust like screwing around with Lucwasnt going to change that.I do, Tara Jean said.I know you dont want to believe that, but I do.And I think, down under those pearls and the uptight hairdo Victoria put her hand to the loose bun at the back of her neckyou know it, too.Victoria opened her mouth to say something, but nothing came out and sensing weakness, Tara Jean pushed ahead.Whatever Dennis has told you, she said, or made you believe, its a lie.Its what he does.He lies.Victorias cheeks went white and then bright red, and in a heartbeat she knew what Dennis had made Victoria believe.That she was beautiful.Womanly.Desired.You guys okay?It was Luc coming around the corner at the worst possible time and Victoria went on the attack, like a wounded, cornered badger.What the hell is she even doing here?Victoria asked Luc, pointing at Tara.I didnt know there was a guest list.And you want to fuck her.Oh!Tara Jean would have applauded if it wouldnt have made things worse.It seemed Victoria was finding some backbone under that ugly cashmere sweater.Honestly, it was June in Texaswho was that woman dressing for?Vicks?Luc stepped toward her, but Victoria slapped his hand away.You are just like Dad.Lucs head snapped backward and Tara held her breath, knowing that wasnt an insult he would let slide.Thats not true.And you know it.Are you going to deny that you want to fuck her?Okay, Tara said.This is getting a little I like Tara Jean, Luc answered as if she werent actually speaking, and Taras mouth shut so hard her teeth clicked.I like her a lot, and if you gave her a chance you would like her too.I doubt it.I dont have a dick.Tara Jean went back to slipping off her shoes.Now, she was the one who needed a fight.Stop.Luc held out his handsa bad referee between a wounded badger and a wounded slut.Juststop.Dads dead, Luc, Victoria snapped.He cant see you chasing after his would be wife, he cant see you killing yourself on the ice or bossing me around I know that, Luc insisted.I dont think you do, because youre still waiting for that guy to give you a reaction.Or his approval.And its not going to happen!Yeah, and what are you waiting for?Luc asked back.Another man to come along and screw up your life even worse?Luc, Tara said, stepping in where she knew she wasnt wanted, but just might be needed.I think she gets the point.Victorias eyes darted between Luc and Tara Jean and slowly she smiled, and Tara realized too late what this looked like.What she looked like.If you were waiting for a woman to screw up yours, I think you found her, Victoria said, snide and superior.And right.Victoria stomped off, her head held high, and Tara had to give the woman points for her exit.You all right?Luc asked.The day I cant handle your skinny sister is the day they put me in my grave.I dont know, she was pretty pissed, wasnt she?His lips curled up in a soft smile, utterly at odds with the insults his sister had thrown at him.And thats a good thing?Anger has to be an improvement, doesnt it?Over depression?And desperation?Over lying down and playing dead every time someone recognizes her and hates her for crimes she didnt commit?Anger is better.Tara couldnt help but admire Lucs brain.His empathy.His too big heart.He saw things for what they really were, past the lies people told and the walls they put up.Lord knows, most of the time when he turned those handsome hazel eyes on her they felt like a spotlight she had no hope of hiding from.Probably, she agreed.Anger had kept her warm on many a cold night.His regard grew familiar, intimate, and she realized how small this corner was.How dim.How little effort it would take to believe the rest of the house, the whole world was gone.And it was just them.He was so close she could smell the beer he must have drunk on his breath.Shed smelled beer on a hundred mens breath.And somehow it was always sour, the smell of a bad decision.But Luc smelled sweet.Intoxicating.You like me, huh?she asked, relaxing into the shadows.Relaxing into the way this man made her feel.His hand landed on the wall beside her head, his body close enough that she could feel the heat of him.The smell of him, beer and spices, soap and that little something extra that was all him.She wanted to investigate that smell, trace it back to its origins.I think Ive made that clear.He didnt ease closer, just left that distance between them, and she wanted to arch toward him.Pull him flush against her bodyand she could have done that a month ago, but now she found herself lacking the courage.Unbelievably, she felt shy.Unsure of her welcome.She played with the collar of his golf shirt, her finger brushing the hot skin of his neck, and her body woke up with a hum, a long, slow purr of pleasure.When he leaned down, she closed her eyes, her body thrumming, pulled taut on a wire of expectation.Im not used to begging.He breathed against her skin and her breath left in a whoosh, leaving her empty, waiting to be filled.By him.You dont have to beg.She nearly laughed.She was ready to beg; she was ready to do whatever this man wanted.His fingers left the wall, feathered across her collarbone, then his thumb traced her ear.He breathed a kiss across her cheek.Her lips.She sighed, reached for him, and he was gonea wind she couldnt catch.She smiled, her eyes fluttering shut.This felt like falling backwards into a dream.Some kind of fantasy.A game for someone younger, far more innocent than she.It seems I do.The air between them, the inches that separated them, was thick.Flush with restraint.Ripe with illicit possibility.Youve pushed me away too often, Tara, for me to accept this at face value.His thumb traced her eyebrows, her hairline.You want to know if my intentions are honorable?I want to know if this is just a game for you.A chance to fuck with my head.Oh, oh she hated that that was what he thought, but of course he did.What else could he think?She put her hands against his cheeks, feeling the rough scrape of his beard, the hard clench of his muscles.In the dark room his eyes shimmered.My intention is to get into your pants.She couldnt resist the sudden sweetness of his smile, so she kissed him, a hard smack.I wont push you away again, Luc.I dont have the strength.I like you.A lot.His chuckle against her ear lit fires along her body, small pockets of heat that breathed to life in her neck, her breasts, between her legs, and her blood began to hum, carrying the fire across her skin.All she could do was stand there, inches from him, and burn.He leaned closer, his chest meeting her breasts, and she gasped, melting hard against him.His big, hot hands curled around the small of her back, making her feel delicate, a feather on a breeze.Finally, in the dark, in the heated shadows, she found his mouth.And it was like the answer to a question she didnt know she needed answered.Curling her hands into the silk of his hair, she held onto him and opened her mouth, licking his lips.Taking her time to taste him, to chart the contours of his mouth, the delicate arch of his lips, the hard ridge of his teeth.The kisses were long and slow, open mouthed and consuming.As if they had all the time in the world to just stand here and kiss.It was somehow both innocent and the best kind of sinful.He stepped forward, pushing her against the wall, his fingers cupping her head as if he was holding her still so he could just taste her.Just eat her.One kiss rolled into the next.It was the sexiest thing shed ever been a part of, this endless kiss.Her skin opened up to his and it was as if their clothes had melted and she felt him along her bones, in her blood.Her fingers traced the rigid muscles of his back, marveling at the strength that made him so different.So delicious.She wanted to lay him out and taste every inch of him, every muscle and sinew.She wanted to lay him down and make snow angels on all that skin.Whats so funny?he asked against her lips, and she shook her head.You dont want to know.Is it dirty?Because if its dirty, Id really like to hear it.Standing on tiptoe, she whispered some choice filth in his ear and he groaned, pulling her closer into the bow of his body, and she wished she could just stay there.Stay there forever, caught in this web of lust and affection.But as the kisses became less languorous and more consuming, lust outweighed affection and soon she was pushing herself into him, grinding the hottest of her hot spots against his body, searching for the relief she knew he could so spectacularly give her.Her fingers found the soft, sensitive skin just under the hem of his shirt, the muscles that flexed and jumped at her touch, and she curved her hands under his belt, over the hard curves of his professional athlete ass.A muffled curse split the darkness just before the overhead lights flipped on, and Tara leapt away from Luc as if he were suddenly made of bees.Eli, his hand frozen on the light switch, stood in the opposite doorway, the formal dining room table dressed to the nines between them.Eliah, what are you doing?To her great embarrassment, her voice squeaked.Luc didnt help matters by laughing.Ruby called my cell, said there was an extra steak.There is!she cried.Isnt that great?Calm down, Tara, Luc said.He just caught us kissing.We werent robbing the place.Elis eyes, full of accusation, sliced through Tara, right to Luc.Lucs laughter stopped on a dime, and the room exploded with tension.If you have a problem, Eli Luc pushed away from Tara, stepping toward Eli, and Tara put a hand on his chest, felt his heart thunder under her palm.Dont, she whispered.It took a moment but finally he smiled, lifted her hand from his chest, and kissed the palm.Id better go check on those steaks.The hush that settled over the dining room as Luc left was weighty, but she shook it off.It was just a kiss Dont bullshit me, Tara.All right, I had my hands down his pants.His eyes shamed her, because he was just worried.When so many people didnt think of her twice, Eli was worried.Im okay, Eli.Honestly.Hes a Baker Not all of them are bad, Eli.LucLuc is a good guy.Hes going to leave.Once this farce of a will is done, hes out of here.And you think that bothers me?she asked, surprised at the way he must think of her.You think Ive got plans past next week?He blew a long breath out of his nose, sounding like one of the Anguses.Im just worried about you, Tara.Her heart melted a little.And that is about the sweetest thing, Eli.But I dont need worrying.He grunted, and she didnt know if that grunt meant agreement or that he thought she was full of shit, but he stepped around the table and headed toward the kitchen, where the scent of grilling meat was beginning to waft in from the patio grill.Falling in step behind him, she had to marvel at the strange turn her life had taken.After a lifetime of taking care of herself, of fending off the wolves on her own, she suddenly had a hockey player and a cowboy standing up to defend her long gone honor.It was enough to make a girl giddy.Jacob!Luc yelled, walking through the barn into the empty arena.It had been a long night, and hed spent most of it staring up at the ceiling telling himself that Tara had to come to him.Hed chased her enough.But she never came.Come on, buddy, its time to go!He paused, waiting for movement, waiting for the kid to sneeze, but there was nothing but silence and the cry of barn swallows.Frustrated and running late, he headed back through the barn.From the corner of his eye, Luc saw Eli step into the barn and stop, staring at him down the long middle aisle.In the back of his head, the spaghetti western music started up.Hey, Eli.Luc walked down the hallway, ready to bite this particular problem off at the root.He didnt need an overprotective cowboy with a grudge against the Bakers messing up his sex life.Luc.Eli brusquely dropped the saddlebag he carried over the low open door of the stable.About last night Taras a big girl.She made it clear it was none of my business.Oh.Luc felt like hed shaken off his gloves for nothing.Good.But this ranch is my business.Elis smile held no affection, and very little humor.It was the anti smile.Im holding an auction for the Angus herd.Youre selling it?Luc asked, startled.I am.Beginning of September.Eli stood there, shoulders squared, as if daring Luc to oppose him.All right, he said with a shrug.And I want to buy back my familys land.The guy was carrying a hundred year old generational grudge, as if the wounds were fresh.The bitterness was poisonous and Luc wanted nothing to do with it.Look, Eli, I have no interest in keeping your land.Really?Then youll have no problem selling it to me.All the land.Some of it.He didnt care.Its yours.Luc shook his head.I think with the exception of the house and Taras studio I want it all.Now, Luc could give a shit about the ranch, but the tone in Elis voice put every single battle instinct on edge and he found himself wanting to fight for the sake of fighting.This land was my familys, Eli said.From the very beginning.And your family lost it or sold it for nothingfrom the very beginning.And Im going to get it back.Ill take care of Tara.And the ranch.All of it.When you go back to your life, theres no reason for you to come back here.Is this about Tara?Luc had no idea where this animosity was coming from, because it felt jealous and protective.No, Luc, its about the damn ranch.Once this land is rid of all of you I can start again.Fresh.Luc gaped at the man in front of him.The man who had worked year after year for Lyle Baker, playing the part of loyal employee.Practically a family member.All these years, I always thought my dad would have been happier with you as a son.But you were just biding your time until you could get back the land?I didnt like him, Luc.Maybe not as much as you didnt like him, but not by much.The man took advantage of my father at the worst time of his life.That sounds like Lyle.Suddenly, Luc wanted nothing more than to be free of the past, of his fathers machinations, of this mans bitterness.Other than Tara, there was nothing here for him.And Eli knew itwas counting on it.Look, theres nothing I can do for a few more months, Luc said.My hands are tied by that will.When they are untied I want the land.My sister is planning on staying at the ranch She can pay rent.Luc laughed.Honestly, Eli, you cant be serious.Pay rent?Those are my terms.I havent even sold you the damn land yet.Your family has no interest in this place.If your sister is looking for a quiet place to hide out, shes welcome to do it here.For a small fee, probably much smaller than shed pay anywhere else.Ive been paying rent on my familys home for twenty years.Luc did the quick math.Since your mom left?Since Dad started drinking and had to sell the land to Lyle in order to pay his debts.Oh Christ, Eli, I had no idea Why would you?You had a life of your own.A career.The old man drove you away.Just like he drove off everyone else.Except you.And Tara Jean.There it was, the wellspring of Elis protectiveness toward Tara; Eli didnt think Luc deserved her.He clearly didnt know the whole truth about the woman he was defending.As soon as the ugly thought entered his head, his stomach twisted.That wasnt how he saw her.Was it?Youre going to leave, Luc, Eli said as if reading Lucs mind.Dont hurt her any more than shes already been hurt.What do you think?Jacob asked, lifting up the page of sketch paper hed been drawing on.Is it a dog?Tara asked.A horse!Tara winced.Horses have longer legs.Reaching over his shoulder to grab one of her wax pencils, she accidentally knocked over the cup.Pencils spilled across the drafting table and he scurried to pick them up.Ill get them, he cried and carefully, as if defusing a bomb, she reached out and touched his shoulder, the fragile bird bones of his shoulder.Its all right.Hed been coming to her studio every day since last Tuesday, and as hard as she thought it might be to hang out with this kidany kidafter years of thinking of them as one step up from nuclear waste, it wasnt.It was a joy.So?Are you a good artist?he asked, as they chased pencils across the floor.I like art.She shrugged, not quite sure how to answer such a question.I always liked to draw.He nodded like a puppy, his hair flopping like ears, his eyes shining with the most pure and simple affection.It was addicting, that affection.Better than candy.Id love to draw all day.That part is fun.Then youre lucky, arent you?he asked, blinking his big, wide eyes at her.Lucky?The word was like ancient Arabic.Something she needed translated to understand.I think youre lucky, he said, handing her the wax pencils like a bouquet of flowers.Jacob?Tara nearly dropped the pencils and stepped away from the boy, as if shed been caught doing something wrong.Hey, Uncle Luc, Jacob called in greeting, spinning around on his stool to face Luc where he stood in the doorway to her studio, backlit by bright sunshine.Watching Luc walk toward Jacob, his body so lean and powerful, a work of art underneath a gray T shirt and a pair of athletic shorts, she wished they were alone.First shed strip him, exorcise this lust that had been eating her brain since hed stepped onto the ranch, and thenthen shed draw him.All those curves and planes, the strength and grace.Shed never done that beforesketched someonebut she wanted to sketch him.Maybe she was more of an artist than she thought.Or maybe she just needed to get laid.Lucs eyes blazed as if he could read her mind.You ready to go?Luc asked, and Jacob shook his head.Uncle Luc, the boy whined, I hate Saturday morning craft club.Sorry, kiddo, but your mom signed you up Moms at the lawyers, she wont know if I dont go.I can stay here and hang out with Tara!Tara blushed at his enthusiasm, suffused with pleasure, like a sugar rush that didnt crash.Its fine with me, she said.Hes drawing, thats all.Its sort of like craft club.I can get out the glue gun and the bedazzler.Bedazzler?Just one of the tricks of my trade.Well, as enticing as a bedazzler might be, my sister will have my head if she comes back and finds Jacob here.But Uncle Luc How about we go to the arena.You can skate with the peewees.The peewees?Jacob gasped as if Luc had offered to let him suit up with the Olympic team.Sure thing.Head on inside and get cleaned upwere leaving in ten.
