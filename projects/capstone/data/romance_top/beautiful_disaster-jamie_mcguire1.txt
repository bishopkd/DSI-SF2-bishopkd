  red flag  Everything in the room screamed that I didnt belong.The stairs were crumbling, the rowdy patrons were shoulder to shoulder, and the air was a medley of sweat, blood and mold.Voices blurred as they yelled numbers and names back and forth, and arms flailed about, exchanging money and gestures to communicate over the noise.I squeezed through the crowd, following close behind my best friend.Keep your cash in your wallet, Abby!America called to me.Her broad smile gleamed even in the dim light.Stay close!Itll get worse once it starts!Shepley yelled over the noise.America grabbed his hand, and then mine as Shepley led us through the sea of people.The sharp bleating of a bull horn cut through the smoky air.The noise startled me, and I jumped in reaction, looking for the source of the blast.A man stood on a wooden chair, holding a wad of cash in one hand, the horn in the other.He held the plastic to his lips.Welcome to the blood bath!If you are looking for Economics one oh oneyou are in the wrong fucking place, my friend!If you seek The Circle, this is Mecca!My name is Adam, I make the rules and I call the fight.Betting ends once the opponents are on the floor.No touching the fighters, no assistance, no bet switching, and no encroachment of the ring.If you break these rules, you will get the piss beat out of you and you will be thrown out on your ass without your money!That includes you, ladies!So dont use your hoes to scam the system, boys!Shepley shook his head.Jesus, Adam!he yelled to the emcee over the noise, clearly disapproving of his friends choice of words.My heart pounded in my chest.With a pink cashmere cardigan and pearl earrings, I felt like a school marm on the beaches of Normandy.I promised America that I could handle whatever we happened upon, but at ground zero I felt the urge to grip her toothpick of an arm with both hands.She wouldnt put me in any danger, but being in a basement with fifty or so drunken college boys intent on bloodshed and capital, I wasnt exactly confident of our chances to leave unscathed.After America met Shepley at freshman orientation, she frequently accompanied him to the secret fights held in different basements of Eastern University.Each event was held in a different spot, and kept secret until just an hour before the fight.Because I ran in somewhat tamer circles, I was surprised to learn of an underground world at Eastern; but Shepley knew about it before he had ever enrolled.Travis, Shepleys roommate and cousin, entered his first fight seven months before.As a freshman, he was rumored to be the most lethal competitor Adam had seen in the three years since creating The Circle.Beginning his sophomore year, Travis was unbeatable.Together, Travis and Shepley easily paid their rent and bills with the winnings.Adam brought the bull horn to his mouth once again, and the yelling and movement escalated to a feverish pace.Tonight we have a new challenger!Easterns star varsity wrestler, Marek Young!Cheering ensued, and the crowd parted like the red sea when Merek entered the room.A circular space cleared, and the mob whistled, booed and taunted the contender.He bounced up and down, and rocked his neck back and forth; his face severe and focused.The crowd quieted to a dull roar, and then my hands shot to my ears when music blared through the large speakers on the other side of the room.Our next fighter doesnt need an introduction, but because he scares the shit outta me, Ill give him one, anyway!Shake in your boots, boys, and drop your panties, ladies!I give you: Travis Mad Dog Maddox!The volume exploded when Travis appeared in a doorway across the room.He made his entrance, shirtless, relaxed and unaffected.He strolled into the center of the circle as if he were showing up to another day at work.The lean muscles stretched under his tattooed skin as he popped his fists against Mareks knuckles.Travis leaned in and whispered something in Mareks ear, and the wrestler struggled to keep his stern expression.Marek stood toe to toe with Travis, and they looked directly into each others eyes.Mareks expression was murderous; Travis looked mildly amused.The men took a few steps back, and Adam sounded the horn.Marek took a defensive stance, and Travis attacked.I stood on my tip toes when I lost my line of sight, leaning from side to side to get a better view.I inched up, sliding through the screaming crowd.Elbows jabbed into my sides, and shoulders rammed into me, bouncing me back and forth like a pin ball.The tops of Mareks and Travis heads became visible, so I continued to push my way forward.When I finally reached the front, Marek grabbed Travis with his thick arms and attempted to throw him to the ground.When Marek leaned down with the motion, Travis rammed his knee into Mareks face.Before Marek could shake off the blow, Travis lit into him; his fists making contact with Mareks bloodied face over and over.Five fingers sank into my arm and I jerked back.What the hell are you doing, Abby?Shepley said.I cant see from back there!I called to him.I turned just in time to see Marek land a solid punch.Travis turned, and for a moment I thought he had dodged another blow, but he made a complete circle, crashing his elbow straight into the center of Mareks nose.Blood sprayed my face, and splattered down the front of my cardigan.Marek fell to the concrete floor with a thud, and for a brief moment the room was completely silent.Adam threw a scarlet square of fabric on Mareks limp body, and the mob detonated.Cash changed hands once again, and the expressions divided into the smug and the frustrated.I was pushed around with the movement of those coming and going.America called my name from somewhere in the back, but I was mesmerized by the trail of red from my chest to my waist.A pair of heavy black boots stepped in front of me, diverting my attention to the floor.My eyes traveled upward; jeans spattered with blood, a set of finely chiseled abs, a bare, tattooed chest drenched in sweat, and finally a pair of warm, brown eyes.I was shoved from behind, and Travis caught me by the arm before I fell forward.Hey!Back up off her!Travis frowned, shoving anyone who came near me.His stern expression melted into a smile at the sight my shirt, and then he dabbed my face with a towel.Sorry about that, Pigeon.Adam patted the back of Travis head.Cmon, Mad Dog!You have some dough waitin on ya!His eyes didnt stray from mine.Its a damn shame about the sweater.It looks good on you.In the next moment he was engulfed by fans, disappearing the way he came.What were thinking you idiot?America yelled, yanking my arm.I came here to see a fight, didnt I?I smiled.You arent even supposed to be here, Abby, Shepley scolded.Neither is America, I said.She doesnt try to jump in the circle!he frowned.Lets go.America smiled at me and wiped my face.You are such a pain in the ass, Abby.God, I love you!She hooked her arm around my neck, and we made our way up the stairs and out into the night.America followed me into my dorm room, and then sneered at my roommate, Kara.I immediately peeled off the bloody cardigan, throwing it into the hamper.Gross.Where have you been?Kara asked from her bed.I looked to America, who shrugged.Nose bleed.You havent seen one of Abbys famous nose bleeds?Kara pushed up her glasses and shook her head.Oh, you will.She winked at me and then shut the door behind her.Less than a minute later, my cell phone chimed.Per her usual, America texted me seconds after we had said goodbye.staying w shep c u 2morrow ring queen   I peeked at Kara who watched me as if my nose would gush at any moment.She was kidding, I said.Kara nodded with indifference, and then looked down to the mess of books on her bedspread.I guess Ill get a shower, I said, grabbing a towel and my shower bag.Ill alert the media, Kara deadpanned, keeping her head down.The next day, Shepley and America joined me for lunch.I had intended to sit alone, but as students filtered into the cafeteria, the chairs around me were filled by either Shepleys frat brothers or members of the football team.Some of them were at the fight, but no one mentioned my ring side experience.Shep, a passing voice called.Shepley nodded, and America and I both turned to see Travis take a seat at the end of the table.He was followed by two voluptuous bottle blondes wearing Sigma Kappa tees.One of them sat on Travis lap, the other sat beside him, pawing at his shirt.I think I just threw up a little bit in my mouth, America muttered.The blonde on Travis lap turned to America.I heard that, skank.America grabbed her roll and threw it down the table, narrowly missing the girls face.Before the girl could say another word, Travis let his knees give way, sending her tumbling to the floor.Ouch!she squealed, looking up at Travis.Americas a friend of mine.You need to find another lap, Lex.Travis!she whined, scrambling to her feet.Travis turned his attention to his plate, ignoring her.She looked at her sister and huffed, and then they left hand in hand.Travis winked at America, and as if nothing had happened, shoveled another bite into his mouth.It was then that I noticed a small cut on his eyebrow.He traded glances with Shepley, and then began a conversation with one of the football guys across from him.Although the lunch table had thinned, America, Shepley and I lingered to discuss our weekend plans.Travis stood up to leave, but stopped at our end of the table.What?Shepley asked loudly, holding his hand to his ear.I tried to ignore him for as long as possible, but when I looked up, Travis was staring at me.You know her, Trav.Americas best friend?She was with us the other night, Shepley said.Travis smiled at me in what I assumed was his most charming expression.He oozed sex and rebelliousness with his buzzed, brown hair and tattooed forearms, and I rolled my eyes at his attempt to lure me in.Since when do you have a best friend, Mare?Travis asked.Since junior year, she answered, pressing her lips together as she smiled in my direction.Dont you remember, Travis?You ruined her sweater.Travis smiled.I ruin a lot of sweaters.Gross, I muttered.Travis spun the empty chair beside me and sat, resting his arms in front of him.So youre the Pigeon, huh?No, I snapped.I have a name.He seemed amused at the way I regarded him, which only served to make me angrier.Well?What is it?he asked.I took a bite of the last apple spear on my plate, ignoring him.Pigeon it is, then, he shrugged.I glanced up at America, and then turned to Travis.Im trying to eat, here.Travis settled in for the challenge I presented.My names Travis.Travis Maddox.I rolled my eyes.I know who you are.You do, huh?Travis said, raising his wounded eyebrow.Dont flatter yourself.Its hard not to notice when fifty drunks are chanting your name.Travis sat up a bit taller.I get that a lot.I rolled my eyes again, and Travis chuckled.Do you have a twitch?A what?A twitch.Your eyes keep wiggling around.He laughed again when I glared at him.Those are some amazing eyes though, he said, leaning just inches from my face.What color is that, anyway?Grey?I looked down to my plate, letting the long strands of my caramel hair create a curtain between us.I didnt like the way it made me feel when he was so close.I didnt want to be like the other scores of girls at Eastern that blushed in his presence.I didnt want him to affect me in that way at all.Dont even think about it, Travis.Shes like my sister, America warned.Baby, Shepley said.You just told him no.Hes never gonna stop, now.Youre not her type, she hedged.Travis feigned insult.Im everyones type!I peeked over at him and smiled.Ah!A smile.Im not a rotten bastard after all, he winked.It was nice to meet you, Pidge.He walked around the table and leaned into Americas ear.Shepley threw a french fry at his cousin.Get your lips outta my girls ear, Trav!Networking!Im networking!Travis walked out with his hands up in an innocent gesture.A few more girls followed behind him, giggling and running their fingers through their hair to get his attention.He opened the door for them, and they nearly squealed in delight.America laughed.Oh, no.Youre in trouble, Abby.What did he say?I asked, wary.He wants you to bring her to the apartment, doesnt he?Shepley said.America nodded and he shook his head.Youre a smart girl, Abby.Im telling you now, if you fall for his shit and then end up getting mad at him, you cant take it out on me and America, all right?I smiled.I wont fall for it, Shep.Do I look like one of the Barbie twins to you?She wont fall for it, America assured him, touching his arm.This isnt my first rodeo, Mare.Do you know how many times hes screwed things up for me because he one nights the best friend?All of a sudden its a conflict of interest to date me because its fraternizing with the enemy!Im tellin ya, Abby, he looked at me, dont tell Mare she cant come over or date me because you fall for Travs line of BS.Consider yourself warned.Unnecessary, but appreciated, I said.I tried to assure Shepley with a smile, but his pessimism was driven by years of being burned by Travis endeavors.America waved, leaving with Shepley as I walked to my afternoon class.I squinted one eye from the bright sun, gripping my backpack straps.Eastern was exactly what I hoped it would be; from the smaller classrooms to the unfamiliar faces.It was a new start for me; I could finally walk somewhere without the whispers of those who knew  or thought they knew  anything about my past.I was as indistinguishable as any other wide eyed, over achieving freshman on their way to class; no staring, no rumors, no pity or judgment.Only the illusion of what I wanted them to see: Cashmered, no nonsense Abby Abernathy.I sat my backpack on the floor, and collapsed into the chair, bending down to fish my laptop from my bag.When I popped up to set it on my desk, Travis fell into the next desk.Good.You can take notes for me, he said.He chewed on a pen and smiled, undoubtedly his most charming.I shot a disgusted look at him.Youre not even in this class.The hell if Im not.I usually sit up there, he said, nodding to the top row.A small group of girls were staring at me, and I noticed an empty chair in the center.Im not taking notes for you, I said, booting up my computer.Travis leaned so close that I could feel his breath on my cheek.Im sorrydid I offend you in some way?I sighed and shook my head.Then what is your problem?I kept my voice low.Im not sleeping with you.You should give up, now.A slow smile crept across his face before he spoke.I havent asked you sleep with me, his eyes drifted to the ceiling in thought, have I?Im not a Barbie twin or one of your little groupies up there, I said, glancing at the girls behind us.Im not impressed with your tattoos, or your boyish charm, or your forced indifference, so you can stop the antics, okay?Okay, Pigeon.He was infuriatingly impervious to my rudeness.Why dont you come over with America tonight?I sneered at his request, but he leaned closer.Im not trying to bag you.I just wanna hang out.Bag me?How do you ever get laid talking like that?Travis burst into laughter, shaking his head.Just come over.I wont even flirt with you, I swear.Ill think about it.Professor Chaney strolled in, and Travis turned his attention to the front of the room.A residual smile lingered on his face, making the dimple in his cheek sink in.The more he smiled, the more I wanted to hate him, and yet it was the very thing that made hating him impossible.Who can tell me which President had a cross eyed wife with a bad case of the uglies?Chaney asked.Make sure you get that down, Travis whispered.Im gonna need to know that for job interviews.Sshh, I said, typing Chaneys every word.Travis grinned and relaxed into his chair.As the hour progressed, he alternated between yawning and leaning against my arm to look at my monitor.I made a concentrated effort to ignore him, but his proximity and the muscles bulging from his arm made it difficult.He picked at the black leather band around his wrist until Chaney dismissed us.I hurried out the door and down the hall.Just when I felt sure I was a safe distance, Travis Maddox was at my side.Have you thought about it?he asked, slipping on his sunglasses.A petite brunette stepped in front of us, wide eyed and hopeful.Hey, Travis, she lilted, playing with her hair.I paused, recoiling from her sugary tone, and then walked around her.Id seen her before, talking normally in the commons area of the girls dorm, Morgan Hall.Her tone sounded much more mature, then, and I wondered what it was about a toddlers voice she thought Travis would find appealing.She babbled in a higher octave for a bit longer until he was next to me once again.Pulling a lighter from his pocket, he lit a cigarette and blew out a thick cloud of smoke.Where was I?Oh yeahyou were thinking.I grimaced.What are you talking about?Have you thought about coming over?If I say yes, will you quit following me?He considered my stipulation and then nodded.Yes.Then Ill come over.When?I sighed.Tonight.Ill come over tonight.Travis smiled and stopped in his tracks.Sweet.See you then, Pidge, he called after me.I rounded the corner to see America standing with Finch outside our dormitory.The three of us ended up at the same table at freshman orientation, and I knew he would be the welcome third wheel to our well oiled machine.He wasnt excessively tall, but still he towered over my five feet, four inches.His round eyes offset his long, lean features, and his bleached hair was usually fashioned into a spike at the front.Travis Maddox?Jesus, Abby, since when did you start fishing in the deep end?Finch said with disapproving eyes.America pulled the gum from her mouth in a long string.Youre only making it worse by brushing him off.Hes not used to that.What do you suggest I do?Sleep with him?America shrugged.Itll save time.I told him Id come over tonight.Finch and America traded glances.What?He promised to quit bugging me if I said yes.Youre going over there tonight, right?Well, yeah, America said.Youre really coming?I smiled and walked past them into the dorms, wondering if Travis would make good on his promise not to flirt.He wasnt hard to figure out; he either saw me as a challenge, or safely unattractive enough to be a good friend.I wasnt sure which bothered me worse.Four hours later, America knocked on my door to take me to Shepley and Travis.She didnt hold back when I walked into the hall.Yuck, Abby!You look homeless!Good, I said, smiling at my ensemble.My hair was piled on top of my head in a messy bun.I had scrubbed the makeup from my face and replaced my contacts with rectangular black rimmed glasses.Sporting a ratty t shirt and sweatpants, I shuffled along in a pair of flip flops.The idea had come to me hours before that either way, unattractive was the best plan.Ideally, Travis would be instantly turned off and stop his ridiculous persistence.If he was looking for a buddy, I was aiming for too homely to be seen with.America rolled down her window and spit out her gum.Youre so obvious.Why didnt you just roll in dog shit to make your outfit complete?Im not trying to impress anyone, I said.Obviously.We pulled into the parking lot of Shepleys apartment complex, and I followed America to the stairs.Shepley opened the door, laughing as I walked in.What happened to you?Shes trying to be unimpressive, America said.America followed Shepley into his room.The door closed and I stood alone, feeling out of place.I sat in the recliner closest to the door, and kicked off my flip flops.Their apartment was more aesthetically pleasing than the typical bachelor pad.The predictable posters of half naked women and stolen street signs were on the walls, but it was clean, the furniture was new, and the smell of stale beer and dirty clothes was notably absent.Its about time you showed up, Travis said, collapsing onto the couch.I smiled and pushed my glasses up the bridge of my nose, waiting for him to recoil at my appearance.America had a paper to finish.Speaking of papers, have you started the one for history, yet?He didnt bat an eye at my messy hair, and I frowned at his reaction.Have you?I finished it this afternoon.Its not due until next Wednesday, I said, surprised.I just plugged it out.How hard can a two page essay on Grant be?Im a procrastinator, I guess, I shrugged.I probably wont start on it until this weekend.Well, if you need help just let me know.I waited for him to laugh, or to show some sign that he was joking, but his expression was sincere.I raised an eyebrow.Youre going to help me with my paper.I have an A in that class, he said, a bit miffed at my disbelief.He has As in all his classes.Hes a freakin genius.I hate him, Shepley said as he led America into the living room by the hand.I watched Travis with a dubious expression and his eyebrows shot up.What?You dont think a guy covered in tats and that trades punches for a living can get the grades?Im not in school because I have nothing better to do.Why do you have to fight at all, then?Why didnt you try for scholarships?I asked.I did.I was awarded half my tuition.But there are books, living expenses, and I gotta come up with the other half some time.Im serious, Pidge.If you need help with anything, just ask.I dont need your help.I can write a paper.I wanted to leave it at that.I should have left it at that, but the new side of him hed revealed gnawed at my curiosity.You cant find something else to do for a living?Less  I dont know  sadistic?Travis shrugged.Its an easy way to make a buck.I cant make that much working at the mall.I wouldnt say its easy if youre getting hit in the face.What?Youre worried about me?he winked.I made a face and he chuckled.I dont get hit that often.If they swing, I move.Its not that hard.I laughed once.You act as if no one else has come to that conclusion.When I throw a punch they take it and try to reciprocate.Thats not gonna win a fight.I rolled my eyes.What are youthe Karate Kid?Where did you learn to fight?Shepley and America glanced at each other, and then their eyes wandered to the floor.It didnt take long to recognize I had said something wrong.Travis didnt seem affected.I had a dad with a drinking problem and a bad temper, and four older brothers that carried the asshole gene.Oh.My ears smoldered.Dont be embarrassed, Pidge.Dad quit drinking, the brothers grew up.Im not embarrassed.I fidgeted with the falling strands of my hair and then decided to pull it down and smooth it into another bun, trying to ignore the awkward silence.I like the au naturel thing you have going on.Girls dont come over here like that.I was coerced into coming here.It didnt occur to me to impress you, I said, aggravated that my plan had failed.He smiled his boyish, amused grin, and I turned up my anger a notch, hoping it would cover my unease.I didnt know how most girls felt around him, but Id seen how they behaved.I was experiencing more of a disorientated, nauseous feeling than giggly infatuation, and the harder he worked to make me smile, the more unsettled I felt.Im already impressed.I dont normally have to beg girls to come to my apartment.Im sure, I said, screwing my face into disgust.He was the worst kind of confident.Not only was he shamelessly aware of his appeal, he was so used to women throwing themselves at him that he regarded my cool demeanor as refreshing instead of an insult.I would have to change my strategy.America pointed the remote at the television and switched it on.Theres a good movie on tonight.Anyone want to find out where Baby Jane is?Travis stood up.I was just heading out for dinner.You hungry, Pidge?I already ate, I shrugged.No you havent, America said before realizing her mistake.Oherthats right, I forgot you grabbed apizza?Before we left.I grimaced at her miserable attempt to fix her blunder, and then waited for Travis reaction.He walked across the room and opened the door.Cmon.Youve gotta be hungry.Where are you going?Wherever you want.We can hit a pizza place.I looked down at my clothes.Im not really dressed.He appraised me for a moment and then grinned.You look fine.Lets go, Im starvin.I stood up and waved to America, passing Travis to walk down the stairs.I stopped in the parking lot, watching in horror as he straddled a matte black motorcycle.Uh.I trailed off, scrunching my exposed toes.He shot me an impatient glare.Oh, get on.Ill go slow.What is that?I asked, reading the writing on the gas tank too late.Its a Harley Night Rod.Shes the love of my life, so dont scratch the paint when you get on.Im wearing flip flops!Travis stared at me as if Id spoken a foreign language.Im wearing boots.Get on.He slipped on his sunglasses, and the engine snarled when he brought it to life.I climbed on and reached for something to grab on to, but my fingers slipped from leather to the plastic cover of the taillight.Travis grabbed my wrists and wrapped them around his middle.Theres nothing to hold on to but me, Pidge.Dont let go, he said, pushing the bike backward with his feet.With a flick of his wrist, he pulled onto the street, and took off like a rocket.The pieces of my hair that hung loose beat against my face, and I ducked behind Travis, knowing I would end up with bug guts on my glasses if I looked over his shoulder.He gunned the throttle when we pulled into the driveway of the restaurant, and once he slowed to a stop, I wasted no time scrambling to the safety of the concrete.Youre a lunatic!Travis chuckled, leaning his bike onto its kickstand before dismounting.I went the speed limit.Yeah, if we were on the Autobahn!I said, pulling out my bun to separate the rats with my fingers.Travis watched me pull hair away from my face and then walked to the door, holding it open.I wouldnt let anything happen to you, Pigeon.I stormed past him into the restaurant, my head not quite in sync with my feet.Grease and herbs filled the air as I followed him across the red, breadcrumb speckled carpet.He chose a booth in the corner, away from the patches of students and families, and then ordered two beers.I scanned the room, watching the parents coaxing their boisterous children to eat, and looking away from the inquisitive glances of Eastern students.Sure, Travis, the waitress said, writing down our drink orders.She looked a bit high from his presence as she returned to the kitchen.I tucked the wind blown hairs behind my ears, suddenly embarrassed by my appearance.Come here often?I asked acerbically.Travis leaned on the table with his elbows, his brown eyes fixated on mine.So whats your story, Pidge?Are you a man hater in general, or do you just hate me?I think its just you, I grumbled.He laughed once, amused at my mood.I cant figure you out.Youre the first girl thats ever been disgusted with me before sex.You dont get all flustered when you talk to me, and you dont try to get my attention.Its not a ploy.I just dont like you.You wouldnt be here if you didnt like me.My frown involuntarily smoothed and I sighed.I didnt say youre a bad person.I just dont like being a foregone conclusion for the sole reason of having a vagina.I focused on the grains of salt on the table until I heard a choking noise from Travis direction.His eyes widened and he quivered with howling laughter.Oh my God!Youre killing me!Thats it.We have to be friends.I wont take no for an answer.I dont mind being friends, but that doesnt mean you have to try to get in my panties every five seconds.Youre not sleeping with me.I get it.I tried not to smile, but failed.His eyes brightened.You have my word.I wont even think about your pantiesunless you want me to.I rested my elbows on the table and leaned into them.And that wont happen, so we can be friends.An impish grin sharpened his features as he leaned in a bit closer.Never say never.So whats your story?I asked.Have you always been Travis Mad Dog Maddox, or is that just since you came here?I used two fingers on each hand as quotation marks when I said his nickname, and for the first time his confidence waned.He looked a bit embarrassed.No.Adam started that after my first fight.His short answers were beginning to bug me.Thats it?Youre not going to tell me anything about yourself?What do you wanna know?The normal stuff.Where youre from, what you want to be when you grow upthings like that.Im from here, born and raised, and Im a criminal justice major.With a sigh, he unrolled his silverware and straightened them beside his plate.He looked over his shoulder, and I noticed his jaw tensing a bit at those around us.Two tables seating the Eastern soccer team erupted in laughter, and Travis seemed to be annoyed at what they were laughing about.Youre joking, I said in disbelief.No, Im a local, he said, distracted.I meant about your major.You dont look like the criminal justice type.His eyebrows pulled together, suddenly focused on our conversation.Why?I scanned the tattoos covering his arm.Ill just say that you seem more criminal and less justice.I dont get in any troublefor the most part.Dad was pretty strict.Where was your mom?She died when I was a kid, he said as a matter of fact.ImIm sorry, I said, shaking my head.His answer caught me off guard.He dismissed my sympathy.I dont remember her.My brothers do, but I was just three when she died.Four brothers, huh?How did you keep them straight?I teased.I kept them straight by who hit the hardest, which also happened to be oldest to youngest.Thomas, the twinsTaylor and Tyler, and then Trenton.You never, ever got caught alone in a room with Taylor and Ty.I learned half of what I do in The Circle from them.Trenton was the smallest, but hes fast.Hes the only one that can land a punch on me, now.I shook my head, dumbfounded at the thought of five Travises running around in one household.Do they all have tattoos?Pretty much.Except Thomas.Hes an ad exec in California.And your dad?Wheres he?Around, he said.His jaws were working again, increasingly irritated with the soccer team.What are they laughing about?I asked, gesturing to the rowdy table.He shook his head, clearly not wanting to share.I crossed my arms and squirmed in my seat, nervous about what they were saying that caused him so much aggravation.Tell me.Theyre laughing about me having to take you to dinner, first.Its not usuallymy thing.First?When the realization settled on my face, Travis winced at my expression.I spoke before I thought.And I was afraid they were laughing about you being seen with me dressed like this, and they think Im going to sleep with you, I grumbled.Why wouldnt I be seen with you?What were we talking about?I asked, warding off the heat rising under my cheeks.You.Whats your major?he asked.Oh, ergeneral ed, for now.Im still undecided, but Im leaning toward Accounting.Youre not a local, though.You must be a transplant.Wichita.Same as America.How did you end up here from Kansas?I picked at the label of my beer bottle.We just had to get away.From what?My parents.Oh.What about America?She has parent issues, too?No, Mark and Pam are great.They practically raised me.She sort of tagged along; she didnt want me to come alone.Travis nodded.So, why Eastern?Whats with the third degree?I said.The questions were drifting from small talk to personal, and I was beginning to get uncomfortable.Several chairs knocked together as the soccer team left their seats.They traded one last joke before they meandered toward the door.Their pace quickened when Travis stood up.Those in the back of the group pushed those in front to escape before Travis made his way across the room.He sat down, forcing the frustration and anger away.I raised an eyebrow.You were going to say why you chose Eastern, he prompted.Its hard to explain, I said, shrugging.I guess it just felt right.He smiled as he opened his menu.I know what you mean.Familiar faces filled the seats of our favorite lunch table.America sat on one side of me, Finch on the other, and the rest of the spaces were picked off by Shepley and his Sigma Tau brothers.It was hard to hear with the low roar inside the cafeteria, and the air conditioner seemed to be on the fritz again.The air was thick with the smells of fried foods and sweaty skin, but somehow everyone seemed to be more energetic than usual.Hey Brazil, Shepley said, greeting the man sitting in front of me.His olive skin and chocolate eyes offset the white Eastern Football hat pulled low on his forehead.Missed you after the game Saturday, Shep.I drank a beer or six for ya, he said with a broad, white grin.I appreciate it.I took Mare out to dinner, he said, leaning over to kiss the top of Americas long, blonde hair.Youre sittin in my chair, Brazil.Brazil turned to see Travis standing behind him, and then looked to me, surprised.Oh, is she one of your girls, Trav?Absolutely not, I said, shaking my head.Brazil looked to Travis, who stared at him expectantly.Brazil shrugged and then took his tray to the end of the table.Travis smiled at me as he settled into the seat.Whats up, Pidge?What is that?I asked, unable to look away from his tray.The mystery food on his plate looked like a wax display.Travis laughed and took a drink from his water glass.The cafeteria ladies scare me.Im not about to critique their cooking skills.I didnt miss the appraising eyes of those sitting at the table.Travis behavior piqued their curiosity, and I subdued a smile at being the only girl they had seen him insist on sitting by.Ughthat Bio test is after lunch, America groaned.Did you study?I asked.God, no.I spent the night reassuring my boyfriend that you werent going to sleep with Travis.The football players seated at the end of our table stopped their obnoxious laughter to listen more closely, making the other students take notice.I glared at America, but she was unconcerned with any blame, nudging Shepley with her shoulder.Jesus, Shep.Youve got it that bad, huh?Travis asked, throwing a packet of ketchup at his cousin.Shepley didnt answer, but I smiled appreciatively at Travis for the diversion.America rubbed his back.Hes going to be okay.Its just going to take him awhile to believe Abby is resistant to your charms.I havent tried to charm her, Travis sniffed, seeming offended.Shes my friend.I looked to Shepley.I told you.You have nothing to worry about.Shepley finally met my eyes, and upon seeing my sincere expression, his eyes brightened a bit.Did you study?Travis asked me.I frowned.No amount of studying is going to help me with Biology.Its just not something I can wrap my head around.Travis stood up.Cmon.What?Lets go get your notes.Im going to help you study.Travis.Get your ass up, Pidge.Youre gonna to ace that test.I tugged on one of Americas long, yellow braids as I passed.See you in class, Mare.She smiled.Ill save you a seat.Ill need all the help I can get.Travis followed me to my room, and I pulled out my study guide while he popped open my book.He quizzed me relentlessly, and then clarified a few things I didnt understand.In the way that he explained it, the concepts went from being confusing to obvious.and somatic cells use mitosis to reproduce.Thats when you have the phases.They sound sort of like a womans name: Prometa Anatela.I laughed.Prometa Anatela?Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase and Telophase.Prometa Anatela, I repeated, nodding.He smacked the top of my head with the papers.You got this.You know this study guide backwards and forwards.I sighed.Wellwell see.Im going to walk you to class.Ill quiz you on the way.I locked the door behind us.Youre not going to be mad if I flunk this test, are you?Youre not going to flunk, Pidge.We need to start earlier for the next one, though, he said, keeping in step with me to the science building.How are you going to tutor me, do your homework, study and train for your fights?Travis chuckled.I dont train for my fights.Adam calls me, tells me where the fight is, and I go.I shook my head in disbelief as he held the paper in front of him to ask the first question.We nearly finished a second round of the study guide when we reached my class.Kick ass, he smiled, handing me the notes and leaning against the door jamb.Hey, Trav.I turned to see a tall, somewhat lanky man smile at Travis on his way into the classroom.Parker, Travis nodded.Parkers eyes brightened a bit when he looked to me, and he smiled.Hi, Abby.Hi, I said, surprised that he knew my name.I had seen him in class, but wed never met.Parker continued to his seat, joking with those sitting beside him.Whos that?I asked.Travis shrugged, but the skin around his eyes seemed tenser than before.Parker Hayes.Hes one of my Sig Tau brothers.Youre in a frat?I asked, doubtful.Sigma Tau, same as Shep.I thought you knew that, he said, looking beyond me to Parker.Wellyou dont seem thefraternity type, I said, eyeing the tattoos on his forearms.Travis turned his attention to me and grinned.My dad is an alumn, and my brothers are all Sig Tausits a family thing.And they expected you to pledge?I asked, skeptical.Not really.Theyre just good guys, he said, flicking my papers.Better get to class.Thanks for helping me, I said, nudging him with my elbow.America passed, and I followed her to our seats.How did it go?she asked.I shrugged.Hes a good tutor.Just a tutor?Hes a good friend, too.She seemed disappointed, and I giggled at the fallen expression on her face.It had always been a dream of Americas for us to date friends, and roommates slash cousins, for her, was hitting the jackpot.She wanted us to room together when she decided to come with me to Eastern, but I vetoed her idea, hoping to spread my wings a bit.Once she finished pouting, she focused on finding a friend of Shepleys to introduce me to.Travis healthy interest in me had surpassed her ideas.I breezed through the test and sat on the steps outside the building, waiting for America.When she slumped down beside me in defeat, I waited for her to speak.That was awful!she cried.You should study with us.Travis explains it really well.America groaned and leaned her head on my shoulder.You were no help at all!Couldnt you have given me a courtesy nod or something?I hooked my arm around her neck and walked her to our dorm.Over the next week, Travis helped with my history paper and tutored me in Biology.We stood together scanning the grade board outside Professor Campbells office.My student number was three spots from the top.Third highest test grade in the class!Nice, Pidge!he said, squeezing me.His eyes were bright with excitement and pride, and an awkward feeling made me to take a step back.Thanks, Trav.Couldnt have done it without you, I said, pulling on his t shirt.He tossed me over his shoulder, making his way through the crowd behind us.Make way!Move it, people!Lets make room for this poor womans hideously disfigured, ginormous brain!Shes a fucking genius!I giggled at the amused and curious expressions of my classmates.As the days went by, we fielded the persistent rumors about a relationship.Travis reputation helped to quiet the gossip.He had never been known to stay with one girl longer than a night, so the more times we were seen together, the more people understood our platonic relationship for what it was.Even with the constant questions of our involvement, the stream of attention Travis received from his co eds didnt recede.He continued to sit next to me in History, and eat with me at lunch.It didnt take long to realize I had been wrong about him, even finding myself defensive towards those that didnt know Travis the way that I did.In the cafeteria, Travis set a can of orange juice in front of me.You didnt have to do that.I was going to grab one, I said, peeling off my jacket.Well, now you dont have to, he said, flashing the dimple on his left cheek.Brazil snorted.Did she turn you into a cabana boy, Travis?Whats next, fanning her with a palm tree leaf, wearing a Speedo?Travis shot him a murderous glare, and I jumped to his defense.You couldnt fill a Speedo, Brazil.Shut the hell up.Easy, Abby!I was kidding!Brazil said, holding up his hands.Justdont talk about him like that, I said, frowning.Travis expression was a mixture of surprise and gratitude.Now Ive seen it all.I was just defended by a girl, he said, standing up.Before he left with his tray, he offered one more warning glare to Brazil, and then walked outside to stand with a small group of fellow smokers outside the building.I tried not to watch him while he laughed and talked.Every girl in the group subtly competed for the space next to him, and America shoved her elbow in my ribs when she noticed my attention was elsewhere.Whatcha lookin at, Abby?Nothing.Im not looking at anything.She rested her chin on her hand and shook her head.Theyre so obvious.Look at the red head.Shes ran her fingers through her hair as many times as shes blinked.I wonder if Travis gets tired of that.Shepley nodded.He does.Everyone thinks hes this asshole, but if they only knew how much patience he has dealing with every girl that thinks she can tame himhe cant go anywhere without them bugging him.Trust me; hes much more polite than I would be.Oh, like you wouldnt love it, America said, kissing his cheek.Travis was finishing his cigarette outside the cafeteria when I passed.Wait up, Pidge.Ill walk you.You dont have to walk me to every class, Travis.I know how to get there on my own.Travis was easily sidetracked by a girl with long, black hair and a short skirt walking by that smiled at him.He followed her with his eyes and nodded in the girls direction, throwing down his cigarette.Ill catch up with you later, Pidge.Yeah, I said, rolling my eyes as he jogged to the girls side.Travis seat remained empty during class, and I found myself a bit aggravated with him for missing over a girl he didnt know.Professor Chaney dismissed early, and I hurried across the lawn, aware that I was to meet Finch at three to give him Sherri Cassidys Music Appreciation notes.I looked at my watch and quickened my pace.Abby?Parker jogged across the grass to walk beside me.I dont think weve officially met, he said, holding out his hand.Parker Hayes.I took his hand and smiled.Abby Abernathy.I was behind you when you got your bio test grade.Congratulations, he smiled, shoving his hands in his pockets.Thanks.Travis helped, or I wouldve been at the bottom of that list, trust me.Oh, are you guys.Friends.Parker nodded and smiled.Did he tell you theres a party at the House this weekend?We mostly just talk about Biology and food.Parker laughed.That sounds like Travis.At the door of Morgan Hall, Parker scanned my face with his big green eyes.You should come.Itll be fun.Ill talk to America.I dont think we have any plans.Are you a package deal?We made a pact this summer.No parties solo.Smart, he nodded in approval.She met Shep at orientation, so I havent really had to tag along with her much.This will be the first time Ive needed to ask her, so Im sure shell be happy to come.I inwardly cringed.Not only was I babbling, Id made it obvious that I didnt get asked to parties.Great.Ill see you there, he said.He flashed his perfect, Banana Republic model smile with his square jaw and naturally tan skin, turning to walk across campus.I watched him walk away; he was tall, clean shaven, with a pressed pin striped dress shirt and jeans.His wavy, dark blonde hair bounced when he walked.I bit my lip, flattered by his invitation.Now hes more your speed, Finch said in my ear.Hes cute, huh?I asked, unable to stop smiling.Hell yes, hes cutein that preppy, missionary position kind of way.Finch!I cried, smacking him on the shoulder.Did you get Sherris notes?I did, I said, pulling them from my bag.He lit a cigarette, held it between his lips, and squinted at the papers.Fucking brilliant, he said, scanning the pages.He folded them away in his pocket, and then took another drag.Good thing Morgans boilers are out.Youll need a cold shower after getting ogled by that tall drink of water.The dorm doesnt have hot water?I wailed.Thats the word, Finch said, sliding his backpack over his shoulder.Im off to Algebra.Tell Mare I said not to forget me this weekend.Ill tell her, I grumbled, glaring up the antique brick walls of our dormitory.I stomped up to my room, pushed through my door, and let my backpack fall to the floor.No hot water, Kara mumbled from her side of the desk.I heard.My cell phone buzzed and I clicked it open, reading a text message from America cursing the boilers.A few moments later there was a knock on the door.America walked in and plopped onto my bed, arms crossed.Can you believe this shit?How much are we paying and we cant even take a hot shower?Kara sighed.Stop whining.Why dont you just stay with your boyfriend?Havent you been staying with him, anyway?Americas eyes darted in Karas direction.Good idea, Kara.The fact that youre a total bitch comes in handy sometimes.Kara kept her eyes on her computer monitor, unfazed by Americas jab.America pulled out her cell phone and clicked out a text message with amazing precision and speed.Her cell phone chirped, and she smiled at me.Were staying with Shep and Travis until they fix the boilers.What?Im not!I cried.Oh, yes you are.Theres no reason for you to be stuck here, freezing in the shower when Travis and Shep have two bathrooms at their place.I wasnt invited.Im inviting you.Shep already said it was fine.You can sleep on the couchif Travis isnt using it.And if hes using it?America shrugged.Then you can sleep in Travis bed.No way!She rolled her eyes.Dont be such a baby, Abby.You guys are friends, right?If he hasnt tried anything by now, I dont think he will.Her words made my open mouth snap shut.Travis had been around me in one way or another every night for weeks.I had been so occupied with making sure everyone knew we were just friends, it hadnt occurred to me that he really was interested only in friendship.I wasnt sure why, but I felt insulted.Kara looked at us with disbelief.Travis Maddox hasnt tried to sleep with you?Were friends!I said in a defensive tone.I know, but he hasnt eventried?Hes slept with everyone.Except us, America said, looking her over.And you.Kara shrugged.Well, Ive never met him.Ive just heard.Exactly, I snapped.You dont even know him.Kara returned to her monitor, oblivious to our presence.I sighed.All right, Mare.I need to pack.Make sure you pack for a few days, who knows how long it will take them to fix the boilers, she said, entirely too excited.Dread settled over me as if I were about to sneak into enemy territory.Ughall right.America bounced when she hugged me.This is going to be so fun!Half an hour later we loaded down her Honda and headed for the apartment.America hardly took a breath between ramblings as she drove.She honked her horn as she slowed to a stop in her usual parking space.Shepley jogged down the steps, and pulled both of our suitcases from the trunk, following us up the stairs.Its open, he puffed.America pushed the door and held it open.Shepley grunted when he dropped our luggage to the floor.Christ, Baby!Your suitcase is twenty more pounds than Abbys!America and I froze when a woman emerged from the bathroom, buttoning her blouse.Hi, she said, surprised.Her mascara smeared eyes examined us before settling on our luggage.I recognized her as the leggy brunette Travis had followed from the cafeteria.America glared at Shepley.He held up his hands.Shes with Travis!Travis rounded the corner in a pair of boxer shorts and yawned.He looked at his guest, and then patted her backside.My companys here.Youd better go.She smiled and wrapped her arms around him, kissing his neck.Ill leave my number on the counter.Ehdont worry about it, Travis said in a casual tone.What?she asked, leaning back to look in his eyes.Every time!America said.She looked at the woman.How are you surprised by this?Hes Travis fucking Maddox!He is famous for this very thing, and every time theyre surprised!she said, turning to Shepley.He put his arm around her, gesturing for her to calm down.The girl narrowed her eyes at Travis, and then grabbed her purse and stormed out, slamming the door behind her.Travis walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge as if nothing had happened.America shook her head and walked down the hall.Shepley followed her, angling his body to compensate for the weight of her suitcase as he trailed behind.I collapsed against the recliner and sighed, wondering if I was crazy for agreeing to come.I didnt realize Shepleys apartment was a revolving door for clueless bimbos.Travis stood behind the breakfast bar, crossed his arms over his chest and smiled.Whats wrong, Pidge?Hard day?No, Im thoroughly disgusted.With me?He was smiling.I should have known that he expected the conversation.It only made me less inclined to hold back.Yes, you.How can you just use someone like that, and treat them that way?How did I treat her?She offered her number, I declined.My mouth fell open at his lack of remorse.Youll have sex with her, but you wont take her number?Travis leaned on the counter with his elbows.Why would I want her number if Im not going to call her?Why would you sleep with her if youre not going to call her?I dont promise anyone anything, Pidge.She didnt stipulate a relationship before she spread eagle on my couch.I stared at the couch with revulsion.Shes someones daughter, Travis.What if, down the line, someone treats your daughter like that?My daughter better not drop her panties for some jackass she just met, lets put it that way.I crossed my arms, angry that he made sense.So, besides admitting that youre a jackass, youre saying that because she slept with you, she deserved to be tossed out like a stray cat?Im saying that I was honest with her.Shes an adult, it was consensual she was a little too eager about it if you want to know the truth.You act like I committed a crime.She didnt seem as clear about your intentions, Travis.Women usually justify their actions with whatever they make up in their heads.She didnt tell me upfront that she expected a relationship anymore than I told her I expected sex with no strings.How is it any different?Youre a pig.Travis shrugged.Ive been called worse.I stared at the couch, the cushions still askew and bunched up from its recent use.I recoiled at the thought of how many women had given themselves away against the fabric.Itchy fabric at that.I guess Im sleeping on the recliner, I grumbled.Why?I glared at him, furious over his confused expression.Im not sleeping on that thing!God knows what Id be laying in!He lifted my luggage off the floor.Youre not sleeping on the couch or the recliner.Youre sleeping in my bed.Which is more unsanitary than the couch, Im sure.Theres never been anyone in my bed but me.I rolled my eyes.Give me a break!Im absolutely serious.I bag em on the couch.I dont let them in my room.Then why am I allowed in your bed?One corner of his mouth pulled up into an impish grin.Are you planning on having sex with me tonight?No!Thats why.Now get your cranky ass up, take your hot shower, and then we can study some Bio.I glared at him for a moment and then grudgingly did as he commanded.I stood under the shower entirely too long, letting the water wash away my aggravation.Massaging the shampoo through my hair, I sighed at how wonderful it was to shower in a non communal bathroom again  no flip flops, no toiletry bag, just the relaxing blend of water and steam.The door opened, and I jumped.Mare?No, its me, Travis said.I automatically wrapped my arms over the parts I didnt want him to see.What are you doing in here?Get out!You forgot a towel, and I brought your clothes, and your toothbrush, and some weird face cream I found in your bag.You went through my stuff?I shrieked.He didnt answer.Instead, I heard the faucet turn on and the sound of his toothbrush against his teeth.I peeked out of the plastic curtain, holding it against my chest.Get out, Travis.He looked up at me, his lips covered in suds from his toothpaste.I cant go to bed without brushing my teeth.If you come within two feet of this curtain, I will poke out your eyes while you sleep.I wont peek, Pidge, he chuckled.I waited under the water with my arms wrapped tightly across my chest.He spit, gurgled, and spit again, and then the door closed.I rinsed the soap from my skin, dried as quickly as possible, and then pulled my t shirt and shorts on, slipping on my glasses, and raking a comb through my hair.The night moisturizer Travis had brought caught my eye, and I couldnt help but smile.He was thoughtful, and almost nice when he wanted to be.Travis opened the door again.Cmon, Pidge!Im gettin old, here!I threw my comb at him and he ducked, shutting the door and laughing to himself all the way to his room.I brushed my teeth and then shuffled down the hall, passing Shepleys bedroom on the way.Night, Abby, America called from the darkness.Night, Mare.I hesitated before landing two soft knocks on Travis door.Come in, Pidge.You dont have to knock.He pulled the door open and I walked in, seeing his black iron rod bed parallel to the line of windows on the far side of the room.The walls were bare except for a lone sombrero above his headboard.I half expected his room to be covered in posters of barely clothed women, but I didnt even see an advertisement for a beer brand.His bed was black, his carpet gray, everything else in the room was white.It looked as if hed just moved in.Nice PJs, Travis said, noting my yellow and navy plaid shorts, and grey Eastern tee.He sat on his bed and patted the pillow beside him.Well, come on.Im not going to bite you.Im not afraid of you, I said, walking over to the bed and dropping my biology book beside him.Do you have a pen?He nodded to his night table.Top drawer.I reached across the bed and pulled open the drawer, finding three pens, a pencil, a tube of KY jelly, and a clear, glass bowl overflowing with packages of different brands of condoms.Revolted, I grabbed a pen and shoved the drawer shut.What?he asked, turning a page of my book.Did you rob the health clinic?No.Why?I pulled the cap off the pen, unable to keep the sickened expression from my face.Your lifetime supply of condoms.Better safe than sorry, right?I rolled my eyes.Travis returned to the pages, a wry smile breaking across his lips.He read the notes to me, highlighting the main points while he asked me questions and patiently explained what I didnt comprehend.After an hour, I pulled off my glasses and rubbed my eyes.Im beat.I cant memorize one more macromolecule.Travis smiled, closing my book.All right.I paused, unsure of our sleeping arrangements.Travis left the room and walked down the hall, mumbling something into Shepleys room before turning on the shower.I turned back the covers and then pulled them up to my neck, listening to the high pitched whine of the water running through the pipes.Ten minutes later, the water shut off, and the floors creaked under Travis steps.He strolled across the room with a towel wrapped around his hips.He had tattoos on opposite sides of his chest, and black tribal art covering each of his bulging shoulders.On his right arm, the black lines and symbols spanned from his shoulder to his wrist, on the left, the tattoos stopped at his elbow, with one single line of script on the underside of his forearm.I intentionally kept my back to him while he stood in front of his dresser and dropped his towel to slip on a pair of boxers.After flipping off the light, he crawled into the bed beside me.Youre sleeping here, too?I asked, turning to look at him.The full moon outside the windows cast shadows across his face.Well, yeah.This is my bed.I know, but I.  I paused.
