I had to guess  Its perfect.Youre perfect.Gideon caught up my hands and kissed my ring; then watched as I repeated the gesture with his.What you make me feel, Evait hurts.My pulse leaped.Is that bad?Its wonderful.He cupped my face, his ring cool against my cheek.He kissed me passionately, his lips demanding against mine, his tongue thrusting with wicked skill into my mouth.I wanted more, but restrained myself, thinking that Id already gone overboard enough for one day.Plus, hed been too distracted by my unexpected appearance to frost the glass wall to give us privacy.Tell me again what you said in the car, he whispered.HmmI dont know.I brushed my free hand over his vest.I was afraid to tell him again that I loved him.Hed taken it hard the first time, and I wasnt sure hed fully taken in what it meant for us.For him.Youre ridiculously handsome, you know.Its a sucker punch every time I see you.AnywayI dont want to risk scaring you away.Leaning toward me, he touched his forehead to mine.You regret what you said, dont you?All the flowers, the ring   Do you really like it?I asked anxiously, pulling back to study his face and see if he was hedging on the truth.I dont want you to wear it for me if you hate it.His fingers traced the shell of my ear.Its perfect.Its how you see me.Im proud to wear it.I loved that he got it.Of course, thats because he got me.If youre trying to soften the blow of taking back what you said  he began, his gaze betraying a surprising anxiety.I couldnt resist the soft plea in his eyes.I meant every word, Gideon.Ill make you say it again, he threatened in a seductive purr.Youll scream it by the time Im done with you.I grinned and backed away.Get back to work, fiend.Ill give you a lift home at five.He watched me move to the door.I want your cunt naked and wet when you come down to the car.If you touch yourself to get there, dont make yourself come or there will be consequences.Consequences.A little shiver moved through me, but it carried a level of fear I could deal with.I trusted Gideon to know just how far to push me.Will you be hard and ready?A wry smile twisted his lips.When am I not, with you?Thank you for today, Eva.Every minute of it.I blew him a kiss and watched his eyes darken.The look on his face stayed with me the rest of the day.It was six oclock before I made it back to my apartment in a state of well fucked dishevelment.Id known what I was in for when I found Gideons limousine at the curb after work instead of the Bentley.Hed damn near tackled me as I climbed into the back; then proceeded to demonstrate his phenomenal oral skills before nailing me into the seat with vigorous enthusiasm.I was grateful that I kept in shape.Otherwise, Gideons insatiable sexual appetite combined with his seemingly endless stamina mightve exhausted me by now.Not that I was complaining.Just an observation.Clancy was already waiting for me in the lobby of my apartment building when I came rushing in.If he noted my hideously wrinkled dress, flushed cheeks, and messy hair, he didnt point it out.I changed swiftly upstairs and we took off for Parkers studio.I hoped the orientation would start out easy because my legs were still a bit jellied from two toe curling orgasms.By the time we arrived at the converted warehouse in Brooklyn, I was excited and ready to learn.About a dozen students were engaged in various exercises with Parker overseeing and offering encouragement from the edge of the mats.When he saw me, he came over and directed me to a far corner of the sparring area where we could work one on one.Sohows it going?I asked, to break my own tension.He smiled, showing off a very interesting and arresting face.Nervous?A little.Were going to work on your physical strength and stamina, as well as your awareness.Im also going to start training you not to freeze or hesitate in unexpected confrontations.Before we began, I thought I had pretty good physical strength and stamina, but I learned both could be better.We started out with a brief introduction to the equipment and layout of the space, and then moved on to an explanation of both fighting and neutral/passive stances.We warmed up with basic bodyweight calisthenics; then progressed to tagging, where we tried to tag each others shoulders and knees while standing face to face and blocking countermoves.Parker was amazing at tagging, of course, but I started to get the hang of it.The majority of the time, however, was spent covering groundwork and I really sunk my teeth into that.I knew very well what it was like to be down and at a disadvantage.If Parker noted my underlying vehemence, he didnt comment on it.When Gideon showed up at my apartment later that evening, he found me soaking my aching body in my bathtub.Although I could tell he was fresh from a shower after his own workout with his personal trainer, he stripped and slid into the bath behind me, cradling me with his arms and legs.I whimpered as he rocked me.That good, huh?he teased, catching my earlobe in his teeth.Who knew rolling around for an hour with a hot guy could be so exhausting?Cary had been right about Krav Maga causing bruises; I could see a few shadows blooming beneath my skin already and we hadnt even gotten to the hard stuff yet.I might be jealous, Gideon murmured, squeezing my breasts, if I didnt know Smith was married with children.I snorted at yet another tidbit of knowledge he shouldnt know.Do you also know his shoe and hat sizes?Not yet.He laughed at my exasperated growl and I couldnt hold back a smile at hearing the rare sound.One day soon we were going to have to talk about his obsession with information gathering, but today wasnt the day to get into it.Wed been at odds too much lately and Carys warning about making sure we had as much fun as not was ever present in my mind.Playing with the ring on Gideons finger, I told him about the conversation Id had with my dad on Saturday and how his fellow cops had been ribbing him over the gossip about me dating the Gideon Cross.He sighed.Im sorry.Turning, I faced him.Its not your fault youre news.You cant help being insanely attractive.One of these days, he said dryly, Ill figure out whether my face is a curse or not.Well, if my opinion counts for anything, Im rather fond of it.Gideons lips twitched and he touched my cheek.Your opinion is the only one that means anything.And your dads.I want him to like me, Eva, not think Im exposing his daughter to invasions of her privacy.Youll win him over.He just wants me to be safe and happy.He visibly relaxed and pulled me closer.Do I make you happy?Yes.I rested my cheek over his heart.I love being with you.When were not together, I wish we were.You said you didnt want to fight anymore, he murmured in my hair.Its been bugging me.Are you getting tired of me fucking up all the time?You do not fuck up all the time.And Ive screwed up, too.Relationships are hard, Gideon.Most of them dont have kick ass sex like we do.I put us in the lucky column.He cupped water in his hand and poured in down my back, over and over, soothing me with its sinuous warmth.I dont really remember my dad.Oh?I tried to not tense up and reveal my surprise.Or my agitated excitement and desperate hunger to learn more about him.Hed never talked about his family before.It killed me not to prod with questions, but I didnt want to push if he wasnt ready  His chest lifted and fell on a deep exhale.There was something in the sound of his sigh that brought my head up and ruined my intention to be cautious.I ran my hand over his hard pectorals.Want to talk about what you do remember?Justimpressions.He wasnt around much.He worked a lot.I guess I get my drive from him.Maybe workaholism is that a word?is something you have in common, but thats it.How would you know?he shot back, defiant.Reaching up, I brushed the hair back from his face.Im sorry, Gideon, but your father was a fraud who took the easy, selfish way out.You dont have it in you to be that way.Not that way, no.He paused.But I dont think he ever learned how to connect to people, how to care about anything but his own immediate needs.I studied him.Do you think that describes you?I dont know, he answered quietly.Well, I know, and it doesnt.I pressed a kiss to the tip of his nose.Youre a keeper.I better be.His arms tightened around me.I cant think about you with someone else, Eva.Just the idea of another man seeing you the way I do, seeing you like thisputting his hands on youIt takes me to a dark place.Its not going to happen, Gideon.I knew how he felt.I wouldnt be able to bear it if he was intimate with another woman.Youve changed everything for me.I couldnt stand losing you.I hugged him.The feelings mutual.Tilting my head back, Gideon took my mouth in a fierce kiss.In moments it became clear we were soon going to be sloshing water all over the floor.I pulled away.I need to eat if you want to go at it again, fiend.Says the girlfriend rubbing her wet naked body all over me.He sat back with a sinful smile.Lets order cheap Chinese and eat it out of the box with chopsticks.Lets order good Chinese and do that.19  Cary joined us in the living room for excellent Chinese, a sweet plum wine, and Monday night television.As we flipped channels and laughed over the hilarious names of some reality television shows, I watched as two of the most important men in my life enjoyed some relaxation time and each other.They got along well, ribbing and playfully insulting each other in that way men had.Id never seen that side of Gideon before and I loved it.While I hogged one whole side of our sectional sofa, the two guys sat cross legged on the floor and used the coffee table as a dining table.Both were wearing loose sweatpants and fitted T shirts, and I appreciated the view.Was I a lucky girl or what?Cracking his knuckles, Cary dramatically prepared to open his fortune cookie.Lets see.Will I be rich?Famous?About to meet Mr.or Ms.Tall, Dark, and Tasty?Traveling to distant lands?Whatd you guys get?Mines lame, I said.In the end all things will be known.Duh.I didnt need a fortune to figure that out.Gideon opened his and read, Prosperity will knock on your door soon.I snorted.Cary shot me a look.I know, right?You snatched someone elses cookie, Cross.He better not be anywhere near someone elses cookie, I said dryly.Reaching over, Gideon plucked half of mine out of my fingers.Dont worry, angel.Your cookie is the only one I want.He popped it in his mouth with a wink.Gag, Cary muttered.Get a room.He cracked his fortune with a flourish, and then scowled.What the fuck?I leaned forward.Whats it say?Confucius say, Gideon ad libbed, man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day.Cary threw half his cookie at Gideon, who caught it deftly and grinned.Give me that.I snatched the fortune out from between Carys fingers and read it.Then laughed.Fuck you, Eva.Well?Gideon prodded.Pick another cookie.Gideon smiled.Pwned by a fortune.Cary threw the other half of his cookie.I was reminded of similar evenings spent with Cary when I was attending SDSU, which made me try and picture what Gideon had been like in college.From the articles Id read, I knew hed attended Columbia for his undergraduate studies, then left to focus on his expanding business interests.Had he associated with the other students?Did he go to frat parties, screw around and/or drink too much?He was such a controlled man, I had a hard time picturing him that carefree, and yet here he was being exactly that with me and Cary.He glanced at me then, still smiling, and my heart turned over in my chest.He looked his age for once, young and seriously fine and so very normal.At that moment, we were just a twenty something couple relaxing at home with a roommate and a remote control.He was just my boyfriend, hanging out.It was all so sweet and uncomplicated, and I found the illusion a poignant one.The intercom buzzed and Cary leaped to his feet to answer it.He glanced at me with a smile.Maybe its Trey.I held up a hand with my fingers crossed.But when Cary answered the door a few minutes later, it was the leggy blonde from the other night who came in.Hey, she said, taking in the remnants of dinner on the table.She eyed Gideon appraisingly as he politely unfolded and stood in that powerfully graceful way of his.She shot me a smirk; then unleashed a dazzling supermodel smile on Gideon and held out her hand.Tatiana Cherlin.He shook her hand.Evas boyfriend.My brows lifted at his introduction.Was he protecting his identity?Or his personal space?Either way, I liked his response.Cary came back into the room with a bottle of wine and two glasses.Come on, he said, gestured down the hallway to his bedroom.Tatiana gave a little wave and preceded Cary out.I mouthed behind her back to Cary, What are you doing?He winked and whispered, Picking another cookie.Gideon and I called it a night shortly after and headed to my room.As we got ready for bed, I asked him something Id wondered about earlier.Did you have a fuck pad in college, too?His T shirt cleared his head.Excuse me?You know, like the hotel room.Youre a randy guy.I just wondered if youd had some kind of setup even then.He was shaking his head as I ogled his divinely perfect torso and lean hips.Ive had as much sex since I met you as Ive had in the last two years combined.No way.I work hard and I work out harder, both of which keep me pleasantly exhausted most of the time.Occasionally, I mightve gotten an offer I didnt refuse, but otherwise I could take or leave sex until I met you.Bullshit.I found that impossible to believe.He shot me a look before he headed toward the bathroom with a black leather toiletry bag.Keep doubting me, Eva.See what happens.What?I followed him, enjoying the sight of his delectable ass.Youre going to prove that you can take or leave sex by doing me again?It takes two.He opened his bag and pulled out a new toothbrush that he extricated from its packaging and dropped into my toothbrush holder.Youve initiated sex between us as much as I have.You need the connection as much as I do.Youre right.Its just  Just what?He pulled open a drawer, frowned at finding it full, and moved on to pull open another.Other sink, I said, smiling at his presumption that he would get drawers at my place, too, and his scowl when he couldnt find them.Theyre all yours.Gideon moved over to the second sink and began unpacking his bag into the drawers.Just what?he repeated, taking shampoo and body wash over to my shower.Leaning my hip into the sink and crossing my arms, I watched him stake his claim all over my bathroom.There was no doubt thats what he was doing, just as there was no doubt that anyone walking into the room would know right away there was a man in my life.It struck me then that I had a similar claim on his private space.His household staff had to know their boss was in a committed relationship now.The thought gave me a little thrill.I was thinking about you in college earlier, I went on, when we were eating dinner, imagining what it would be like to see you around on campus.I wouldve been obsessed with you.I would have gone out of my way to see you around just to enjoy the view.I wouldve tried to get in the same classes as you, so I could daydream during lectures about getting into your pants.Sex maniac.He kissed the tip of my nose as he passed me and went to brush his teeth.We both know what wouldve happened once I saw you.I brushed my hair and teeth; then washed my face.Sodid you have a sex pad for the rare occasions some lucky bitch got you in bed?His gaze caught my soapy reflection in the mirror.Ive always used the hotel.Thats the only place youve had sex?Before me?The only place Ive had consensual sex, he said quietly, before you.Oh.My heart broke.I walked over to him, hugging him from behind.I rubbed my cheek against his back.We went to bed and wrapped ourselves around each other.I buried my face in his neck and breathed him in, snuggling.His body was hard, yet it was wonderfully comfortable against mine.He was so warm and strong, so powerfully male.I only had to think of him to want him.I slid my leg over his hips and rose above him, my hands splayed atop the ridges of his abdomen.It was dark, I couldnt see him, but I didnt need to.As much as I loved that face of his the one he resented at times it was the way he touched me and murmured to me that really got to me.As if there was no one else in the world for him, nothing he wanted more.Gideon.I didnt need to say anything else.Sitting up, he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me deeply.Then he rolled me beneath him and made love to me with a tender possessiveness that rocked me to the soul.I woke with a jolt of surprise.A heavy weight crushed me and a harsh voice spit ugly, nasty words into my ear.Panic gripped me, cutting off my air.Not again.NoPlease, no  My stepbrothers hand covered my mouth and he yanked my legs apart.I felt the hard thing between his legs poking blindly, trying to push into my body.My scream was muffled by his palm smashed over my lips and I cringed away, my heart pounding so hard I thought it would burst.Nathan was so heavy.So heavy and strong.I couldnt buck him off.I couldnt shove him away.Stop it!Get off me.Dont touch me.Oh, Godplease dont do that to menot again  Where was Mama?Ma ma!I screamed, but Nathans hand covered my mouth.It pressed down on me, squashing my head into the pillow.The more I fought, the more excited he became.Panting like a dog, he rammed against me over and overtrying to shove himself inside me  Youre going to know what it feels like.I froze.I knew that voice.I knew it wasnt Nathans.Not a dream.Still a nightmare.God, no.Blinking madly in the darkness, I struggled to see.The blood was roaring through my ears.I couldnt hear.But I knew the smell of his skin.Knew his touch, even when it was cruel.Knew the feel of his body on mine, even as it tried to invade me.Gideons erection battered into the crease of my thigh.Panicked, I heaved upward with all my strength.His hand on my face dislodged.Sucking air into my lungs, I screamed.His chest heaved as he growled, Not so neat and tidy when youre the one getting fucked.Crossfire, I gasped.A flash of light from the hallway blinded me, followed by the blessed removal of Gideons smothering weight.Rolling to my side, I sobbed, my eyes streaming tears that blurred my view of Cary shoving Gideon across the room and into the wall, denting the drywall.Eva!Are you okay?Cary turned on the bedside light, cursing when he saw me curled in a fetal position, rocking violently.When Gideon straightened, Cary rounded on him.Move one fucking muscle before the cops get here and Ill beat you to a bloody pulp!Swallowing past my burning throat, I pushed up to a seated position.My gaze locked with Gideons and I watched the haze of sleep leave his eyes, replaced by a dawning horror.Dream, I choked out, catching Carys arm as he reached for the phone.Hes d dreaming.Cary glanced at where Gideon crouched naked on the floor like a wild animal.Carys arm dropped back to his side.Jesus Christ, he breathed.And I thought I was fucked up.Sliding off the bed, I stood on shaky legs, sick with lingering fear.My knees gave out and Cary caught me, lowering to the floor with me and holding me as I cried.Im gonna crash on the couch.Cary ran a hand through his sleep mussed hair and leaned into the hallway wall.The door to my bedroom was open behind me and Gideon was inside, looking pale and haunted.Ill set out some blankets and pillows for him, too.I dont think he should go home alone.Hes shredded.Thanks, Cary.The arms I had wrapped around my middle tightened.Is Tatiana still here?Hell, no.Its not like that.We just fuck.What about Trey?I asked quietly, my mind already drifting back to Gideon.I love Trey.I think hes the best person Ive ever met aside from you.He bent forward and kissed my forehead.And what he doesnt know wont hurt him.Stop worrying about me and take care of you.I looked up at him, my eyes swimming in tears.I dont know what to do.Cary sighed, his green eyes dark and serious.I think you need to decide if youre in over your head, baby girl.Some people cant be fixed.Look at me.Ive got a great guy and Im giving it to a girl I cant stand.Cary Reaching out, I touched his shoulder.He caught my hand and squeezed it.Im here if you need me.Gideon was zipping up his duffel bag when I returned to my room.He looked at me and fear slithered in my gut.Not for me, but for him.Id never seen anyone look so desolate, so utterly broken.The bleakness in his beautiful eyes frightened me.There was no life in him.He was gray as death with deep shadows in all the angles and planes of his breathtaking face.What are you doing?I whispered.He backed up, as if he wanted to be as far away from me as he could get.I cant stay.It worried me that I felt a surge of relief at the thought of being alone.We agreed no running.That was before I attacked you!he snapped, showing the first sign of spirit in over an hour.You were unconscious.Youre not going to be a victim ever again, Eva.My Godwhat I almost did to you He turned his back to me, his shoulders hunched in a way that scared me as much as the attack had.If you leave, we lose and our pasts win.I saw my words hit him like a blow.Every light in my room was on, as if electricity alone could banish all the shadows on our souls.If you give up now, Im afraid itll be easier for you to stay away and for me to let you.Well be over, Gideon.How can I stay?Why would you want me to?Turning around, he looked at me with such longing it brought fresh tears to my eyes.Id kill myself before I hurt you.Which was one of my fears.I had a difficult time picturing the Gideon I knew the dominant, willful force of nature taking his own life, but the Gideon standing before me was an entirely different person.And he was the child of a suicidal parent.My fingers plucked at the hem of my T shirt.Youd never hurt me.Youre afraid of me, he said hoarsely.I can see it on your face.Im afraid of me.Afraid of sleeping with you and doing something that will destroy us both.He was right.I was afraid.Dread chilled my stomach.Now I knew the explosive violence in him.The festering fury.And we were so impassioned with each other.Id slapped his face at the garden party, lashing out physically when I never did that.It was the nature of our relationship to be lusty and emotional, earthy and raw.The trust that held us together also opened us up to each other in ways that made us both vulnerable and dangerous.And it would get worse before it got better.He shoved a hand through his hair.Eva, I   I love you, Gideon.God.He looked at me with something that resembled disgust.Whether it was directed at me or himself, I didnt know.How can you say that?Because its the truth.You just see this he gestured at himself with a wave of his hand.Youre not seeing the fucked up, broken mess inside.I inhaled sharply.You can say that to me?When you know Im fucked up and broken, too?Maybe youre wired to go for someone whos terrible for you, he said bitterly.Stop it.I know youre hurting, but lashing out at me is only going to make you hurt worse.I glanced at the clock and saw it was four in the morning.I walked toward him, needing to get past my fear of touching him and being touched by him.He held up a hand as if to hold me off.Im going home, Eva.Sleep on the couch here.Dont fight me about this, Gideon.Please.Ill worry myself sick if you go.Youll be more worried if I stay.He stared at me, looking lost and angry and filled with terrible yearning.His eyes pleaded with me for forgiveness, but he wouldnt accept it when I tried to give it to him.I went to him and took his hand, fighting back the surge of apprehension that hit me when we touched.My nerves were still raw, my throat and mouth still sore, the memory of his attempts at penetration so like Nathans were still too fresh.Well g get through this, I promised him, hating that my voice quavered.Youll talk to Dr.Petersen and well go from there.His hand lifted as if to touch my face.If Cary hadnt been here   He was, and Ill be fine.I love you.Well get past this.I walked into him, hugging him, pushing my hands beneath his shirt to touch his bare skin.Were not going to let the past get in the way of what we have.I wasnt sure which of us I was trying to convince.Eva.His returning hug squeezed all of the air out of me.Im sorry.Its killing me.Please.Forgive meI cant lose you.You wont.My eyes closed, focusing on the feel of him.The smell of him.Remembering that I once feared nothing when I was with him.Im so sorry.His shaking hands stroked the curve of my spine.Ill do anything  Shh.I love you.Well be okay.Turning his head, he kissed me softly.Forgive me, Eva.I need you.Im afraid of what Ill become if I lose you  Im not going anywhere.My skin tingled beneath the restless glide of his hands on my back.Im right here.No more running.He paused, his breath gusting harshly against my lips.Then he tilted his head and sealed his mouth over mine.My body responded to the gentle coaxing of his kiss.I arched into him without volition, pulling him closer.He cupped my breasts in his hands, kneading them, circling the pads of his thumbs over my nipples until they peaked and ached.I moaned with a mixture of fear and hunger, and he quivered at the sound.Eva?I I cant.The memory of how Id woken up was too fresh in my mind.It hurt me to deny him, knowing he needed the same thing from me as Id needed from him when I told him about Nathan proof that the desire was still there, that as ugly as the scars of our pasts were, they didnt affect what we were to each other now.But I couldnt give him that.Not yet.I felt too raw and vulnerable.Just hold me, Gideon.Please.He nodded, wrapping his arms around me.I urged him to sink to the floor with me, hoping I could get him to fall asleep.I curled into his side, my leg thrown over his, my arm draped over his hard stomach.He squeezed me gently, pressing his lips to my forehead, whispering over and over again how sorry he was.Dont leave me, I whispered.Stay.Gideon didnt answer, didnt make any promises, but he didnt let me go either.I woke sometime later, hearing Gideons heart beating steadily beneath my ear.All the lights were still on, and the carpeted floor was hard and uncomfortable.Gideon lay on his back, his beautiful face youthful in sleep, his shirt lifted just enough to expose his navel and the ripped muscles of his abdomen.This was the man I loved.This was the man whose body gave me such pleasure, whose thoughtfulness moved me over and over again.He was still here.And from the frown that marred the space between his brows, he was still hurting.I slid my hand into his sweatpants.For the first time since wed been together, he wasnt hot steel in my palms, but he quickly swelled and thickened as I tentatively stroked him from root to tip.Fear lingered just beneath my arousal, but I was more afraid of losing him than of living with the demons inside him.He stirred, his arm tightening around my back.Eva?This time I answered him the way I couldnt before.Lets forget, I breathed into his mouth.Make us forget.Eva.He rolled into me, peeling my shirt off with cautious movements.I was similarly tentative in undressing him.We approached each other as if each of us was breakable.The bond between us was fragile just then, both of us apprehensive about the future and the wounds we could inflict with all of our jagged edges.His lips wrapped around my nipple, his cheeks hollowing slowly, his seduction subdued.The tender suckling felt so good I gasped and arched into his hand.He caressed my side from breast to hip and back again, over and over, gentling me as my heart raced wildly.He kissed across my chest to the other breast, murmuring words of apology and need in a voice broken by regret and misery.His tongue lapped at the hardened point, worrying it, before surrounding it with wet heat and suction.Gideon.The delicate pulls expertly coaxed desire through my skittish mind.My body was already lost in him, greedily seeking the pleasure and beauty of his.Dont be afraid of me, he whispered.Dont pull away.He kissed my navel, and then moved lower, his hair caressing my stomach as he settled between my legs.He held me open with shaking hands and nuzzled my clit.His light, teasing licks through my cleft and the fluttering dips into my trembling sex took me to the edge of insanity.My back bowed.Hoarse pleas left my lips.Tension spread through my body, tightening everything until I felt like I might snap under the pressure.And then he pushed me into orgasm with the softest nudge of the tip of his tongue.I cried out, heated relief pulsing through my writhing body.I cant let you go, Eva.Gideon levered over me as I vibrated with pleasure.I cant.Brushing away the tear tracks from his face, I stared into his reddened eyes.His torment was painful for me to witness, hurting my heart.I wouldnt let you if you tried.He took himself in hand and fed his cock slowly, carefully into me.My head pressed hard into the floor as he sank deeper, possessing my body one thick inch at a time.When Id taken all of him, he began to move in measured, deliberate thrusts.I closed my eyes and focused on the connection between us.Then he settled onto me, his stomach pressed to mine, and my pulse leaped with panic.Abruptly frightened, I hesitated.Look at me, Eva.His voice was so hoarse it was unrecognizable.I did, and saw his anguish.Make love to me, he begged in a breathless whisper.Make love with me.Touch me, angel.Put your hands on me.Yes.My palms pressed flat to his back; then stroked over the quivering muscles to his ass.Squeezing the hard flexing flesh, I urged him to move faster, plunge deeper.The rhythmic strokes of his heavy cock through the clenching depths of my sex pushed ecstasy through me in heated waves.He felt so good.My legs wrapped around his plunging hips, my breath quickening as the cold knot inside me began to melt.Our gazes held.Tears coursed down my temples.I love you, Gideon.Please His eyes squeezed shut.I love you.He lured me to orgasm with the skilled rolling of his hips, stirring his cock inside me.My sex clenched tightly, trying to hold him, trying to keep him deep in me.Come, Eva, he gasped against my throat.I struggled for it, struggled to get past the lingering apprehension that came from having him on top of me.The anxiety mingled with the desire, keeping me on edge.He made a hoarse sound filled with pain and regret.Need you to come, Evaneed to feel youPlease  Cupping my buttocks, he angled my hips and stroked over and over that sensitive spot inside me.He was tireless, relentless, fucking me long and hard until my mind lost control of my body and I came violently.I bit his shoulder to stem my cries as I shook beneath him, the tiny muscles inside me trembling with ecstatic ripples.He groaned deep in his chest, a serrated sound of tormented pleasure.More, he ordered, deepening his drives to give me that delectable bite of soreness.That he once again trusted us both enough to introduce that little touch of pain chased away the last of my reservations.As much as we trusted each other, we were learning to trust our instincts, too.I came again, ferociously, my toes curling until they cramped.I felt the familiar tension grip Gideon and tightened my grasp on his hips, spurring him on, desperate to feel him spurting inside me.No!He wrenched away, falling to his back and throwing an arm over his eyes.Punishing himself by denying his body the comfort and pleasure of mine.His chest heaved and glistened with sweat.His cock lay heavily on his belly, brutal looking with its broad purpled head and thick roping of veins.I dove for it with hands and mouth, ignoring his vicious curse.Pinning his torso with my forearm, I pumped him hard with my other fist and sucked voraciously on the sensitive crown.His thighs quivered, his legs kicking restlessly.Damn it, Eva.Fuck.He stiffened and gasped, his hands shoving into my hair, his hips bucking.Oh, fuck.Suck it hardAh, Christ  He exploded in a powerful rush that almost choked me, coming hard, flooding my mouth.I took it all, my fist milking pulse after pulse up the throbbing length of his cock, swallowing repeatedly until he shuddered with the surfeit of sensation and begged me to stop.I straightened and Gideon sat up and wrapped himself around me.He took me back down to the floor where he buried his face in my throat and cried until dawn.I wore a black long sleeved silk blouse and slacks to work on Tuesday, feeling the need to have a barrier between myself and the world.In the kitchen, Gideon cupped my face in his hands and brushed his mouth across mine with heartrending tenderness.His gaze remained haunted.Lunch?I asked, feeling like we needed to cling to the connection between us.I have a business lunch.He ran his fingers through my loose hair.Would you come?Ill make sure Angus gets you back to work on time.Id love to come along.I thought of the schedule of evening events, meetings, and appointments hed sent to my smartphone.And tomorrow night we have a benefit dinner at the Waldorf=Astoria?His gaze softened.Dressed for work, he looked somber yet collected.I knew he was anything but.You really wont give up on me, will you?he asked quietly.I held up my right hand and showed him my ring.Youre stuck with me, Cross.Get used to it.On the drive to work, he cuddled me in his lap, and again on the ride to lunch at Jean Georges.I didnt speak more than a dozen words during the meal, which Gideon ordered for me and I enjoyed immensely.I sat quietly at his side, my left hand resting on his hard thigh beneath the tablecloth, a wordless affirmation of my commitment to him.To us.One of his hands rested over mine, warm and strong, as he discussed a new property in development on St.Croix.We kept that connection throughout the entire meal, each of us choosing to eat one handed rather than separate.With each hour that passed, I felt the horror of the night before drain away from both of us.It would be another scar to add to his collection, another bitter memory hed always have, a memory I would share and fear along with him, but it wouldnt rule us.We wouldnt let it.Angus was waiting to take me home when my day ended.Gideon was working late, and then going directly from the Crossfire to Dr.Petersens office.I used the length of the drive to steel myself for the next round of training with Parker.I debated skipping it, but ended up deciding it was important to keep to a routine.So much in my life was uncontrollable at the moment.Following a schedule was one of the few things totally within my power.After an hour and a half of tagging and groundwork with Parker at the studio, I was relieved when Clancy dropped me off at home and proud of myself for working out when it was the last thing Id wanted to do.When I stepped into the lobby, I found Trey talking to the front desk.Hey, I greeted him.Going up?He turned to face me, his brown eyes warm and his smile open.Trey had a gentleness to him, a kind of straightforward navet that was different from the other relationships Caryd had before.Or maybe I should just say Trey was normal, which so few of the people in my and Carys lives were.Carys not in, he said.They just tried calling.Youre welcome to come up with me and wait.I wont be going out again.If you really dont mind.He fell into step beside me as I waved at the gal at the front desk and moved toward the elevators.I brought something for him.I dont mind at all, I assured him, returning his sweet smile.He eyed my yoga pants and tank top.You just get back from the gym?Yeah.Despite it being one of those days when Id rather have done anything else.He laughed as we stepped into the elevator.I know that feeling.As we rode up, silence descended.It was weighted.Everything all right?I asked him.Well Trey adjusted the sling of his backpack.Carys just seemed a little off the last few days.Oh?I bit my lower lip.In what way?I dont know.Its hard to explain.I just feel like maybe somethings up with him and Im missing what it is.I thought of the blonde and winced inwardly.Maybe hes stressed about the Grey Isles job and he doesnt want to bother you with it.He knows youve got your hands full with your job and school.The tension in his shoulders softened.Maybe thats it.It makes sense.Okay.Thank you.I let us in to the apartment and told him to make himself at home.Trey headed to Carys room to drop his stuff, while I went to the phone to check the voice mail.A shout from down the hallway had me reaching for the phone for a different reason, my heart thudding with thoughts of intruders and imminent danger.More yelling followed, with one voice clearly belonging to Cary.I exhaled in a rush, relieved.With the phone in my hand, I ventured to see what the hell was going on.I was nearly run over by Tatiana rounding the hallway corner still buttoning her blouse.Oops, she said, with an unapologetic grin.See ya.I couldnt hear the door shut behind her over Treys shouting.Fuck you, Cary.We talked about this!You promised!Youre blowing this out of proportion, Cary barked.Its not what you think.Trey came storming out of Carys bedroom in such a rush that I plastered myself to the hallway wall to get out of his way.Cary followed, with a sheet slung around his waist.As he passed me, I shot him a narrow eyed glance that earned me a fuck off middle finger.I left the two men alone and escaped into my shower, angry at Cary for once again ruining something good in his life.It was a pattern I kept hoping hed break, but he couldnt seem to kick it.When I came out to the kitchen a half hour later, the stillness in the apartment was absolute.I focused on cooking dinner, deciding to go with a pork roast and new potatoes with asparagus, one of Carys favorite dinners, in case he was home for dinner and needed some cheering up.The sight of Trey stepping into the hallway while I was putting the roast in the oven surprised me, and then it made me sad.I hated to see him leave looking flushed, disheveled, and crying.My pity turned to fierce disappointment when Cary joined me in the kitchen with the scent of male sweat and sex clinging to him.He shot me a scowl as he passed me on his way to the wine fridge.I faced him with my arms crossed.Screwing a heartbroken lover on the same sheets hes just caught you cheating on isnt going to make things better.Shut up, Eva.Hes probably hating himself right now for giving in.I said shut the fuck up.Fine.I turned away from him and focused on seasoning the potatoes to put in the oven with the roast.Cary grabbed wineglasses out of the cupboard.I can feel you judging me.Stop it.He wouldnt be half as pissed if itd been a man he caught me fucking.Its all his fault, huh?Newsflash: Your love life isnt perfect either.Low blow, Cary.Im not going to be your punching bag over this.You messed up, and then you made it worse.Its all on you.Dont get on your damn high horse.Youre sleeping with a man whos going to rape you any day now.Its not like that!He snorted and leaned his hip against the counter, his green eyes filled with pain and anger.If youre going to make excuses for him because hes sleeping when he attacks you, youll have to make those same excuses for drunks and druggies.They dont know what theyre doing either.The truth of his words struck me hard, as did the fact that he was deliberately trying to wound me.You can put down a bottle.You cant quit sleeping.Straightening, Cary opened the bottle hed selected and poured two glasses, sliding one across the counter toward me.If anyone knows what its like to be involved with people who hurt you, its me.You love him.You want to save him.But whos going to save you, Eva?Im not always going to be around when youre with him and hes a ticking time bomb.You wanna talk about being in relationships that hurt, Cary?I shot back, deflecting him away from my painful truths.Did you screw Trey over to protect yourself?Did you figure youd push him away before he had the chance to disappoint you?Carys mouth curved bitterly.He tapped his glass to mine, which still sat on the counter.Cheers to us, the seriously fucked up.At least we have each other.He stalked out of the room and I deflated.Id known this was coming the unraveling of circumstances too good to be true.Contentment and happiness didnt exist in my life for more than a few moments at a time, and they were really only illusionary.There was always something hidden.Lying in wait to spring up and ruin everything.20  Gideon arrived just as dinner was coming out of the oven.He had a garment bag in one hand and a laptop case in the other.Id worried that he would try to go home alone after his session with Dr.Petersen and was relieved when hed called to say he was on his way.Still, when I first opened the door and saw him on the threshold, a shiver of unease slid through me.Hey, he said quietly, following me back into the kitchen.Smells delicious in here.I hope youre hungry.Theres a lot of food and Ill be surprised if Cary joins us to help eat it all.Gideon dropped his stuff on the breakfast bar and approached me cautiously, his gaze searching my face as he neared.I brought some things with me to stay the night, but Ill go if you want.At any time.Just tell me.I blew out my breath in a harsh rush, determined not to let fear dictate my actions.I want you here.I want to be here.He paused beside me.Can I hold you?I turned into him and squeezed him hard.Please.He pressed his cheek against mine and hugged me close.The embrace wasnt as natural and easy as wed grown used to.There was a new wariness between us that was different from anything wed felt before.How are you doing?he murmured.Better now that youre here.But still nervous.He pressed his lips to my forehead.Me, too.I dont know how were ever going to fall asleep next to each other again.Pulling back slightly, I looked at him.That was my fear as well, and my earlier conversation with Cary didnt help matters.Hes a ticking time bomb  Well figure it out, I said.He was quiet for a long moment.Has Nathan ever contacted you?No.Although I had a deep rooted fear that I might see him again one day, whether accidentally or deliberately.He was out there somewhere, breathing the same airWhy?It was on my mind today.I pulled back to search his face, a knot forming in my throat at how tormented he looked.Why?Because weve got a lot of baggage between us.Are you thinking its too much?Gideon shook his head.I cant think that way.I didnt know what to do or say.What assurances could I give him, when I wasnt sure my love and his need would be enough to make our relationship work?Whats going through your mind?he asked.Thoughts of food.Im starving.Why dont you go see if Cary wants to eat?Then we can get started on dinner.Gideon found Cary sleeping, so he and I ate a candlelit dinner for two at the dining table, a somewhat formal meal while lounging in the worn T shirts and pajama bottoms wed put on after our respective showers.I was worried about Cary, but spending quiet downtime alone with Gideon felt like just what we needed.I had lunch with Magdalene in my office yesterday, he said after wed enjoyed a few initial bites.Oh?While Id been ring shopping, Magdalene had been enjoying private time with my man?Dont take that tone, he admonished.She ate a meal in an office covered in your flowers, with you blowing kisses from my desk.You were as much there as she was.Sorry.Knee jerk reaction.He lifted my hand to his mouth and pressed a quick, hard kiss to the back.Im relieved you can still get jealous over me.I sighed.My emotions had been all over the map all day; I couldnt decide how I felt about anything.Did you say anything to her about Christopher?That was the point of the lunch.I showed her the video.What?I frowned, remembering my phone had died in his car.Howd you do that?I took your phone up to my office and pulled the video off via USB.Didnt you notice I brought it back last night, fully charged?No.I set my silverware down.Dominant or not, Gideon and I were going to have to work on which lines crossed over into my freak out zone.You cant just hack into my phone, Gideon.I didnt hack into it.You havent set a password yet.Thats not the point!Its a serious invasion of my fucking privacy.Jesus Why in hell did no one in my life understand that I had boundaries?Would you like me rummaging through your stuff?Ive got nothing to hide.He pulled his smartphone out of an inner pocket of his sweats and held it out to me.And you wont either.I didnt want to get into a fight now, things were too shaky as it was, but Id let this go long enough.It doesnt matter whether or not I have something I dont want you to see.I have a right to space and privacy, and you need to ask before you help yourself to my information and my belongings.You have to stop taking whatever you want without my permission.What was private about it?he asked with a frown.You showed it to me yourself.Dont be like my mother, Gideon!I shouted.Theres only so much crazy I can handle.He jerked back at my vehemence, clearly surprised by how upset I was.Okay.Im sorry.I gulped down my wine, trying to rein in my temper and unease.Sorry Im mad?Or sorry you did it?After the length of several heartbeats, Gideon said, Im sorry youre mad.He really didnt get it.Why dont you see how weird this is?Eva.He sighed and shoved a hand through his hair.I spend a quarter of every day inside you.When you set limits outside of that I cant help but see them as arbitrary.Well, theyre not.Theyre important to me.If theres something you want to know, you need to ask me.All right.Dont do it anymore, I warned.Im not kidding, Gideon.His jaw tightened.Okay.I get it.Then, because I really didnt want to fight, I moved on.What did she say when she saw it?He visibly relaxed.It was difficult, of course.Even more difficult to know Id seen it.She saw us in the library.We didnt talk about that directly, but then, what was there to say?I wont apologize for making love to my girlfriend in a closed room.He leaned back in his chair and exhaled harshly.Seeing Christophers face on the video seeing what he really thought of her that hurt her.Its hard to see yourself being used that way.Especially by someone you think you know, someone whos supposed to care about you.To hide my reaction, I busied myself with refilling both my glass and his.He spoke as if from experience.What exactly had been done to him?After a quick gulp of wine, I asked, How are you doing with it?What can I do?Over the years, Ive made every attempt to talk to Christopher.Ive tried throwing money at him.Ive tried threatening him.Hes never shown any inclination to change.I realized long ago that I can only do damage control.And keep you as far away from him as possible.Ill be helping you with that, now that I know.Good.He took a drink, eyeing me over the lip of his glass.Youre not asking me about my appointment with Dr.Petersen.Its none of my business.Unless you want to share.I met his gaze, willing him to do just that.Im here to listen whenever you need an ear, but Im not going to pry.When youre ready to let me in, you will.That said, Id love to know if you like him.So far.He smiled.He talks me around in circles.Not many people can do that.Yes.Talks you back around and makes you come at it from a different angle that has you thinking, Now why didnt I see it like that?Gideons fingers stroked up and down the stem of his glass.He prescribed something for me to take at night before bed.I filled it before I came over.How do you feel about taking drugs?He looked at me with dark, haunted eyes.I feel its necessary.I have to be with you and I have to make that safe for you, whatever it takes.Dr.Petersen says the drug combined with therapy has been successful for other atypical sexual parasomniacs.I have to believe that.I reached over to squeeze his hand.Taking medication was a big step, especially for someone whod avoided facing his problems for a long time.Thank you.Gideons grip tightened.Apparently there are enough people with this problem that there have been sleep studies on it.He told me about a documented case where a man sexually assaulted his wife in his sleep for twelve years before they sought help.Twelve years?Jesus.Apparently part of the reason they waited so long was because the man was a better lay when he was asleep, he said dryly.And if thats not a killer blow to the ego, I dont know what is.I stared at him.Well, shit.I know, right?His wry smile faded.But I dont want you to feel pressured to share a bed with me, Eva.There is no magic pill.I can sleep on the couch or I can go home, although of the two choices Id prefer the couch.My whole day is better after getting ready for work with you.For me, too.Reaching over, Gideon caught my hand and lifted it to his lips.I never imagined I could have thisSomeone in my life who knows what you do about me.Someone who could talk about my fuck ups over dinner because they accept me anywayIm grateful for you, Eva.My heart twisted with a sweet pain in my chest.He could say such beautiful things, the perfect things.I feel the same way about you, ace.Deeper, maybe, because I loved him.
