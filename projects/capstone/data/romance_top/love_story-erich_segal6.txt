Very tight.Rocking to and fro.All Mr.Cavilleri could offer by way of further comment was the (now very soft) repetition of his daughter's name: 'Jennifer. 'And all his graduating Radcliffe with honors daughter could offer by way of reply was: 'Phil. 'I was definitely the odd man out.One thing about my couth upbringing helped me out that afternoon.I had always been lectured about not talking with my mouth full.Since Phil and his daughter kept conspiring to fill that orifice, I didn't have to speak.I must have eaten a record quantity of Italian pastries.Afterward I discoursed at some length on which ones I had liked best (I ate no less than two of each kind, for fear of giving offense), to the delight of the two Cavilleris.'He's okay,' said Phil Cavilleri to his daughter.What did that mean?I didn't need to have 'okay' defined; I merely wished to know what of my few and circumspect actions had earned for me that cherished epithet.Did I like the right cookies?Was my handshake strong enough?What?'I told you he was okay, Phil,' said Mr.Cavilleri's daughter.'Well, okay,' said her father, 'I still had to see for myself.Now I saw.Oliver?'He was now addressing me.'Yes, sir?''Phil. ''Yes, Phil, sir?''You're okay. ''Thank you, sir.I appreciate it.Really I do.And you know how I feel about your daughter, sir.And you, sir. ''Oliver,' Jenny interrupted, 'will you stop babbling like a stupid goddamn preppie, and  '  'Jennifer,' Mr.Cavilleri interrupted, 'can you avoid the profanity?The sonovabitch is a guest!'At dinner (the pastries turned out to be merely a snack) Phil tried to have a serious talk with me about you can guess what.For some crazy reason he thought he could effect a rapprochement between Olivers III and IV.'Let me speak to him on the phone, father to father,' he pleaded.'Please, Phil, it's a waste of time. ''I can't sit here and allow a parent to reject a child.I can't. ''Yeah.But I reject him too, Phil. ''Don't ever let me hear you talk like that,' he said, getting genuinely angry.'A father's love is to be cherished and respected.It's rare. ''Especially in my family,' I said.Jenny was getting up and down to serve, so she was not involved with most of this.'Get him on the phone,' Phil repeated.'I'll take care of this. ''No, Phil.My father and I have installed a cold line. ''Aw, listen, Oliver, he'll thaw.Believe me when I tell you he'll thaw.When it's time to go to church '  At this moment Jenny, who was handing out dessert plates, directed at her father a portentous monosyllable.'Phil ?''Yeah, Jen?''About the church bit '  'Yeah?''Uh  kind of negative on it, Phil. ''Oh?'asked Mr.Cavilleri.Then, leaping instantly to the wrong conclusion, he turned apologetically toward me.'I  uh  didn't mean necessarily Catholic Church, Oliver.I mean, as Jennifer has no doubt told you, we are of the Catholic faith.But, I mean, your church, Oliver.God will bless this union in any church, I swear. 'I looked at Jenny, who had obviously failed to cover this crucial topic in her phone conversation.'Oliver,' she explained, 'it was just too goddamn much to hit him with at once. ''What's this?'asked the ever affable Mr.Cavilleri.'Hit me, hit me, children.I want to be hit with everything on your minds. 'Why is it that at this precise moment my eyes hit upon the porcelain statue of the Virgin Mary on a shelf in the Cavilleris' dining room?'It's about the God blessing bit, Phil,' said Jenny, averting her gaze from him.'Yeah, Jen, yeah?'asked Phil, fearing the worst.'Uh  kind of negative on it, Phil,' she said, now glancing at me for support  which my eyes tried to give her.'On God?On anybody's God?'Jenny nodded yes.'May I explain, Phil?'I asked.'Please. ''We neither of us believe, Phil.And we won't be hypocrites. 'I think he took it because it came from me.He might maybe have hit Jenny.But now he was the odd man out, the foreigner.He couldn't look at either of us.'That's fine,' he said after a very long time.'Could I just be informed as to who performs the ceremony?''We do,' I said.He looked at his daughter for verification.She nodded.My statement was correct.After another long silence, he again said, 'That's fine. 'And then he inquired of me, inasmuch as I was planning a career in law, whether such a kind of marriage is  what's the word?legal?Jenny explained that the ceremony we had in mind would have the college Unitarian chaplain preside ('Ah, chaplain,' murmured Phil) while the man and woman address each other.'The bride speaks too?'he asked, almost as if this  of all things  might be the coup de grace.'Philip,' said his daughter, 'could you imagine any situation in which I would shut up?''No, baby,' he replied, working up a tiny smile.'I guess you would have to talk. 'As we drove back to Cambridge, I asked Jenny how she thought it all went.'Okay,' she said.10  Mr.William F.  Thompson, Associate Dean of the Harvard Law School, could not believe his ears.'Did I hear you right, Mr.Barrett?''Yes, sir, Dean Thompson. 'It had not been easy to say the first time.It was no easier repeating it.'I'll need a scholarship for next year, sir. ''Really?''That's why I'm here, sir.You are in charge of Financial Aid, aren't you, Dean Thompson?''Yes, but it's rather curious.Your father  '  'He's no longer involved, sir. ''I beg your pardon?'Dean Thompson took off his glasses and began to polish them with his tie.'He and I have had a sort of disagreement. 'The Dean put his glasses back on, and looked at me with that kind of expressionless expression you have to be a dean to master.'This is very unfortunate, Mr.Barrett,' he said.For whom?I wanted to say.This guy was beginning to piss me off.'Yes, sir,' I said.'Very unfortunate.But that's why I've come to you, sir.I'm getting married next month.We'll both be working over the summer.Then Jenny  that's my wife  will be teaching in a private school.That's a living, but it's still not tuition.Your tuition is pretty steep, Dean Thompson. ''Uh  yes,' he replied.But that's all.Didn't this guy get the drift of my conversation?Why in hell did he think I was there, anyway?'Dean Thompson, I would like a scholarship. 'I said it straight out.A third time.'I have absolutely zilch in the bank, and I'm already accepted. ''Ah, yes,' said Mr.Thompson, hitting upon the technicality.'The final date for financial  aid applications is long overdue. 'What would satisfy this bastard?The gory details, maybe?Was it scandal he wanted?What?'Dean Thompson, when I applied I didn't know this would come up. ''That's quite right, Mr.Barrett, and I must tell you that I really don't think this office should enter into a family quarrel.A rather distressing one, at that. ''Okay, Dean,' I said, standing up.'I can see what you're driving at.But I'm still not gonna kiss my father's ass so you can get a Barrett Hall for the Law School. 'As I turned to leave, I heard Dean Thompson mutter, 'That's unfair. 'I couldn't have agreed more.11  Jennifer was awarded her degree on Wednesday.All sorts of relatives from Cranston, Fall River   and even an aunt from Cleveland  flocked to Cambridge to attend the ceremony.By prior arrangement, I was not introduced as her fianc, and Jenny wore no ring: this so that none would be offended (too soon) about missing our wedding.'Aunt Clara, this is my boyfriend Oliver,' Jenny would say, always adding, 'He isn't a college graduate. 'There was plenty of rib poking, whispering and even overt speculation, but the relatives could pry no specific information from either of us  or from Phil, who I guess was happy to avoid a discussion of love among the atheists.On Thursday, I became Jenny's academic equal, receiving my degree from Harvard  like her own, magna cum laude.Moreover, I was Class Marshal, and in this capacity got to lead the graduating seniors to their seats.This meant walking ahead of even the summas, the super superbrains.I was almost moved to tell these types that my presence as their leader decisively proved my theory that an hour in Dillon Field House is worth two in Widener Library.But I refrained.Let the joy be universal.I have no idea whether Oliver Barrett III was present.More than seventeen thousand people jam into Harvard Yard on Commencement morning, and I certainly was not scanning the rows with binoculars.Obviously, I had used my allotted parent tickets for Phil and Jenny.Of course, as an alumnus, Old Stonyface could enter and sit with the Class of '26.But then why should he want to?I mean, weren't the banks open?The wedding was that Sunday.Our reason for excluding Jenny's relatives was out of genuine concern that our omission of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost would make the occasion far too trying for unlapsed Catholics.It was in Phillips Brooks House, an old building in the north of Harvard Yard.Timothy Blauvelt, the college Unitarian chaplain, presided.Naturally, Ray Stratton was there, and I also invited Jeremy Nahum, a good friend from the Exeter days, who had taken Amherst over Harvard.Jenny asked a girl friend from Briggs Hall and  maybe for sentimental reasons  her tall, gawky colleague at the reserve book desk.And of course Phil.I put Ray Stratton in charge of Phil.I mean, just to keep him as loose as possible.Not that Stratton was all that calm!The pair of them stood there, looking tremendously uncomfortable, each silently reinforcing the other's preconceived notion that this 'do it yourself wedding' (as Phil referred to it) was going to be (as Stratton kept predicting) 'an incredible horror show. 'Just because Jenny and I were going to address a few words directly to one another!We had actually seen it done earlier that spring when one of Jenny's musical friends, Marya Randall, married a design student named Eric Levenson.It was a very beautiful thing, and really sold us on the idea.'Are you two ready?'asked Mr.Blauvelt.'Yes,' I said for both of us.'Friends,' said Mr.Blauvelt to the others, 'we are here to witness the union of two lives in marriage.Let us listen to the words they have chosen to read on this sacred occasion. 'The bride first.Jenny stood facing me and recited the poem she had selected.It was very moving, perhaps especially to me, because it was a sonnet by Elizabeth Barrett:   		When our two souls stand up erect and strong, 		Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher, 		Until the lengthening wings break into fire   From the corner of my eye I saw Phil Cavilleri, pale, slack jawed, eyes wide with amazement and adoration combined.We listened to Jenny finish the sonnet, which was in its way a kind of prayer for   		A place to stand and love in for a day, 		With darkness and the death' hour rounding it.Then it was my turn.It had been hard finding a piece of poetry I could read without blushing.I mean, I couldn't stand there and recite lace doily phrases.I couldn't.But a section of Walt Whitman's Song of the Open Road, though kind of brief, said it all for me:  		 I give you my hand!I give you my love more precious than money, 		I give you myself before preaching or law; 		Will you give me yourself?will you come travel with me?Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?I finished, and there was a wonderful hush in the room.Then Ray Stratton handed me the ring, and Jenny and I  ourselves  recited the marriage vows, taking each other, from that day forward, to love and cherish, till death do us part.By the authority vested in him by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Mr.Timothy Blauvelt pronounced us man and wife.Upon reflection, our 'post game party' (as Stratton referred to it) was pretentiously unpretentious.Jenny and I had absolutely rejected the champagne route, and since there were so few of us we could all fit into one booth, we went to drink beer at Cronin's.As I recall, Jim Cronin himself set us up with a round, as a tribute to 'the greatest Harvard hockey player since the Cleary brothers. ''Like hell,' argued Phil Cavilleri, pounding his fist on the table.'He's better than all the Clearys put together. 'Philip's meaning, I believe (he had never seen a Harvard hockey game), was that however well Bobby or Billy Cleary might have skated, neither got to marry his lovely daughter.I mean, we were all smashed, and it was just an excuse for getting more so.I let Phil pick up the tab, a decision which later evoked one of Jenny's rare compliments about my intuition ('You'll be a human being yet, Preppie').It got a little hairy at the end when we drove him to the bus, however.I mean, the wet eyes bit.His, Jenny's, maybe mine too; I don't remember anything except that the moment was liquid.Anyway, after all sorts of blessings, he got onto the bus and we waited and waved until it drove out of sight.It was then that the awesome truth started to get to me.'Jenny, we're legally married!''Yeah, now I can be a bitch. '12  If a single word can describe our daily life during those first three years, it is 'scrounge. 'Every waking moment we were concentrating on how the hell we would be able to scrape up enough dough to do whatever it was we had to do.Usually it was just break even.And there's nothing romantic about it, either.Remember the famous stanza in Omar Khayyam?You know, the book of verses underneath the bough, the loaf of bread, the jug of wine and so forth?Substitute Scott on Trusts for that book of verses and see how this poetic vision stacks up against my idyllic existence.Ah, paradise?No, bullshit.All I'd think about is how much that book was (could we get it secondhand?)and where, if anywhere, we might be able to charge that bread and wine.And then how we might ultimately scrounge up the dough to pay off our debts.Life changes.Even the simplest decision must be scrutinized by the ever vigilant budget committee of your mind.'Hey, Oliver, let's go see Becket tonight'  'Listen, it's three bucks. ''What do you mean?''I mean a buck fifty for you and a buck fifty for me. ''Does that mean yes or no?''Neither.It just means three bucks. 'Our honeymoon was spent on a yacht and with twenty one children.That is, I sailed a thirty six foot Rhodes from seven in the morning till whenever my passengers had enough, and Jenny was a children's counselor.It was a place called the Pequod Boat Club in Dennis Port (not far from Hyannis), an establishment that included a large hotel, a marina and several dozen houses for rent.In one of the tinier bungalows, I have nailed an imaginary plaque: 'Oliver and Jenny slept here when they weren't making love. 'I think it's a tribute to us both that after a long day of being kind to our customers, for we were largely dependent on their tips for our income, Jenny and I were nonetheless kind to each other.I simply say 'kind,' because I lack the vocabulary to describe what loving and being loved by Jennifer Cavilleri is like.Sorry, I mean Jennifer Barrett.Before leaving for the Cape, we found a cheap apartment in North Cambridge.I called it North Cambridge, although the address was technically in the town of Somerville and the house was, as Jenny described it, 'in the state of disrepair. 'It had originally been a two family structure, now converted into four apartments, overpriced even at its 'cheap' rental.But what the hell can graduate students do?It's a seller's market.'Hey, Ol, why do you think the fire department hasn't condemned the joint?'Jenny asked.'They're probably afraid to walk inside,' I said.'So am I. ''You weren't in June,' I said.(This dialogue was taking place upon our reentry in September. )'I wasn't married then.Speaking as a married woman, I consider this place to be unsafe at any speed. ''What do you intend to do about it?'
