Good ears!Im a high school teacher!I have to hear everything!he shouted.And so do I, Spencer yelled from the bottom step.* * * Matt Lacoumette had one of those grueling weeks where he had to be everywhere at once.There was fertilizing to do in the orchardthe flowers were giving way to buds of fruit and it was a delicate time.Some of Georges ewes had lambed but there were some late breeders ready now.He liked to shear the ewes to make their lambing easier, and Matt helped with that.Then they liked to get the ewes delivered so theyd be ready to breed by fall.Everything happened in spring and fall, over monthsthe planting, the harvesting, the pears, the grapes, the lambing, the breeding.And things were not going to calm down anytime soonthere was more shearing to be done after lambing so the sheep could grow nice coats over summer.On top of that, he had to teach a couple of classes before the end of term.If all that wasnt enough, he had to deal with Lucy, who kept calling him.Despite the fact that hed been clear he was not in the market for a girlfriend, Lucy, like so many women, thought hed change his mind.So she cried and he had to do his best to assure her there was nothing at all wrong with hershe was lovely and smart and sexy.It was himhe was not going to be anyones boyfriend.It was brutal.And then, after leaving his last class of the week, he left the building to find Natalie leaning against his truck.She was sporting yet another hair color and stylethis time it was jet black.The last time hed seen her it was brown with red highlights.When they were together hed gotten the biggest kick out of her change in looks, every variation beautiful.There it was againhe was feeling both lust and rage.What is it, Nat?he asked.I thought maybe we could have a cup of coffee, she said.Because...?Because having you hate me is killing me!Please, Matt!He took a breath.I dont hate you, he said patiently.It was a lie, he really did hate her.The problem was that he was also still drawn to her.He could love her if hed just relax and let himself, but hed be damned if hed even entertain that notion.Were not having coffee.Were not trying again or patching things up or being good friends.We thought we felt the same way about things and it turned out we felt the opposite way about important things.We made a mistake, Natalie.I have to go now.Its been a long week.She didnt budge.And you have to get to bed!He ground his teeth.Ill call campus security, he threatened.And Ill tell Dr.Weymouth I cant give any more classes because his department secretary is harassing me.You wouldnt do that.I would.I should.Now get out of here and please, no more of this.But when are you going to forgive me?she said, crocodile tears running down her cheeks.Theres something I just cant forgive.Everything else is a distant memory, but that one thing God, who knew you were so Catholic!He clenched his hands into fists.Theyd been over this, too.It wasnt religious or political.It was his personal ethic about marriage, their marriage in particular, about how marriage had to work.There had to be give and take, they had to talk about deeply personal issues, they had to find a way to compromise.There had to be trust.They couldnt lie to each other.They failed at marriage and it had nothing to do with his religion.As far as he knew every religion shared similar if not identical ethics.He took out his cell phone.What are you doing?she asked.Calling campus security.Then Dr.Weymouth...Ugh!she grunted, moving out of his way.Then she stomped back toward the building in her high heels with ankle straps, her short skirt and long legs more than distracting.He grimaced.He should probably quit this gig anyway.He sure didnt do it for the money.Most months of the year he could slip it into his schedule easily but spring and fall especially, it was a real inconvenience.It was just that he liked the students.There were only a few who took these particular classes to check off a box or try to get by with an easy class.Most of them were either premed or heading into agriculture or environmental science.They asked stimulating questions, created interesting dialogue and arguments, gave him something to think about.They were sharp.He thought about going out for the evening or back to his apartment.Instead, he went to the farm even though hed been there all morning.The nice thing about the family home, he didnt need a reservation.The door was never locked; there was no possibility his parents wouldnt be home.If they had plans, somewhere to go, hed hear about it weeks in advance.He walked in, found his mother in the kitchen and gave her a kiss.She acted like she barely had time for the kiss.Coffee?Wine?He looked at his watch.Wine, thank you.Rioja.The red.Do you have a full table tonight?George, Ginny, their families.I have no trouble squeezing in one more.Thanks.Im starving.And, as you can plainly see, I am cooking.Ill have you some tapas in a minute.She put a glass of wine in front of him.You usually move in and out of this house without a word, unless its business.Tonight is different.Youre friendly.He laughed.His parents could really read their kids.Even as adults!I wanted to speak to Papa but youll do.I want to give up that apartmentits too much trouble.But I dont want to live in the house.What Id like to do is build on Lacoumette land.If theres a space that can be allotted to me for a house.Her eyes lit up and she was clearly excited.For a family?He shook his head.For me.Maybe someday there will be a family.But Mama, I still have wounds to heal, so not now please.These wounds, Matt, she said.If you feed them too much they can heal on the outside and keep getting worse on the inside.Then youre in trouble.His mother, who was not well educated in the traditional sense, knew all.Yes, Mama.Ill watch for that.Paco will be so happy to give you your choice of land.Not too close to the house, eh?So we dont see the hundreds of girls come and go?He laughed.He was going to change that, as well.Then his brother and sister and their families started trooping in.George shook his hand and thanked him for the hundredth time for his help with the ewes.Ginny kissed and hugged him.Lori, Georges wife, did the same.The kids pretty much ignored him, as he was not an uncommon sight around here.Then Paco came in and gave him the traditional greeting, a hand on the shoulder and a swat on the cheek.Matt wants to build a house on the farm, his mother said from the kitchen.And Paco, surprised and clearly thrilled, grabbed his son and kissed him on each cheek.Then did so again.There is a woman?he asked.Just me, your bachelor son.Good then.Well get you ready for a woman.* * * It was about nine forty five when Gingers cell phone rang.She didnt recognize the numberit wasnt a family member or Grace.She was in her room, reading.Ray Anne and Al were having a date up on Ray Annes private deck atop the garage.Ginger was committed to not getting anywhere near them.She was locked away so they could be alone.She wouldnt even go to the kitchen; she did not want to hear moaning, panting or giggling.Thinking it must be a wrong number, she answered uncertainly.Hi, Ginger.Its Matt.Matt?she asked, sitting up on the bed.Did I give you my number?He laughed.You did not.I got it out of my sister and I had to swear I would be a perfect gentleman or she was going to do to me what we do to goats were not going to breed.Ew.Exactly.You tell her I was less than perfect and Im a eunuch.She couldnt help it, she laughed.Gee, and Peyton seems so sweet.Ha.Dont let her fool you.She was the oldest of eight and could be mean as a rabid dog.Shed do unspeakable things to her younger brothers and sisters as long as there was no possibility shed get caught.You must have a reason for calling...I do.Dont think Im a loser, okay?I had a really crazy week that ended pretty good and here I am, home, and have no one to talk to but my mother!Your mother is there?And she couldnt help it, she thought red flag.No.He laughed.I had dinner at the farm, which I do a lot.Theres always plenty of good food and an unpredictable number of family members.And I talked to my mom for a while.But seriously, Ginger.A little chatting it up with Mom is not what Im looking for and I remembered we had a pretty cordial conversation.But what about Peyton?she asked.I bet you could talk to her anytime.Peyton?The pregnant newlywed who threatened to castrate me?She settled back against her pillows.Right.So what did you want to talk about?My week was nuts.I was all over that farm and had to help George with shearing some ewes who came into season late and were just now ready for lambing and the fruit trees are budding early and had to be aerated around the roots and fertilized.Dirty work.And I had to teach a two hour class at the collegeI should give that upits inconvenient.But its also dangerous.My ex was leaning against my truck when I came out of the building.Shes done this a few timesshe wants to talk.I had to threaten her with campus security to get her to go away...Oh, you didnt!she said.Oh, Matt, she must be so desperate!Well, thats not what I wanted to talk about, but yes, shes desperate.But why?I mean, we had that talkwe shouldnt have gotten married and were not happy.We were worse than unhappy, we were miserable.But thats not what I called about.I wanted to tell you something important.Okay...Shit, he said.Im an idiot.This probably wont be important to anyone but me.To me, its big.Youll probably think its just dumb.Or a big nothing.Youre so dramatic, she said.Just tell me.I hate this little apartment I live in.It was my concession to Natalie.Id be a farmer, but wouldnt live on the farm.When we split up, I stayed here because she couldnt afford it, but I hate it.I wasnt cut out to live on top of other people.I cant be happy without land.So I had this sudden epiphany and made a decisionIm going to build a house on the farm.My father was so excited, he almost kissed me on the mouth!He wants to get together tomorrow to look at the land.George is the only other Lacoumette living on the farm and Paco is ecstatic.And guess what?Im pretty excited, too.Of course Im a year away from making the transition, but I just had to tell someone.Im going to live in my favorite place.You could live with your parents until your house is built, she said.No, none of that, he said, laughing.Im almost thirty.Im not living with my parents.I do stay over when things are crazy at the farm, when were tracking possible bad weather at pear harvest or bringing in lambs or something that requires twenty four hour vigilance.But I need a little privacy, you know?But a house on the land...The most beautiful place in the world, she said.You think so?I cant imagine how much work it must be, but its incredibly beautiful...Those pear trees dont blossom year round, you know.Its not just the blossoms, although just the scent is hypnotic.I love Portland in the spring when the fruit trees all over the city are in bloom!Everything about your farm is lovelythe house, the barn, the chickens...The chickens?he asked.I bet you take them for granted, she said.Fresh eggs in the morning...Fresh chicken at night, he added with a laugh.I hadnt thought of that, but yes, I suppose...Peyton hates killing chickens.My mother doesnt like it, but she does it.If George is around the house shell send him to round up a few and shell cut them up and freeze them.She protects her best laying hens.Its about time for her to hatch a bunch of eggs, replenish the henhousetheres an incubator in the barn.I would love to see that, baby chicks, Ginger said, a little breathless.I dont think Id like killing them, either.Maybe youre just not a farm girl.Not everyone is.Peyton can do anything there is to do on the farm but she doesnt like it.Shes funny, she loves the farmshe wants the fresh food, wants to snuggle the new lambsbut our Peyton, her majesty, does not shovel shit.Shes what we call a gentleman farmerwants the land and animals, wants to pet the animals and eat the food, and other people have to do the work.Cant you be a farm girl and not like killing chickens?she asked.The cycle of life is important on a farm, he said.You grow it, eat it, grow some more.Were a commercial farm.Its not just about fresh eggs for breakfast, its a business and has to support a lot of people.It has to support the land, too.We cant deplete and not replenish or it will be a one generation farm.He paused and silence hung between them.Im sorry, Im boring you.No!No, youre not.Im really interested, believe it or not.I probably dont have any intelligent questions to ask but I like hearing about it.But youd like to see the chicks or new lambs?he asked.She sighed.I would love that.Maybe Ill visit my parents on a weekend when thats happening and I could come by the farm on my way back to Thunder Point.If thats all right?It would be great.You have to eat, however.No one comes to the farm without eating something.I wouldnt want to impose...Didnt you notice how much my family loves feeding people?Not everyone enjoys it, by the way, but its possible Scott married my sister for the food.Tell me about the classes you teach.I just guest lecture in the biology department.I usually talk about either plant biology or animal husbandry.I can lecture on the biology of the farm, the microbiology of soil.The students love talking about cloning and two headed sheep.Were making great progress as a biological as opposed to organic farm because we still use small amounts of chemicals and we immunize the sheep, but were cautious.We fertilize mostly with chicken manure, kill pests on the trees organically, stick to nature where we can.Sure, she said.You have to take care of the fruit...We have to protect the bees.If we kill the insects and the bees disappear, were doomed.The balance is delicate and the health of the plants and animals and consumers is...Am I putting you to sleep?No!she nearly shouted.I never thought of farming as a science...It is indeed a science.Paco is not a scientist but his experience and instincts are flawless.Everything he taught me holds up scientifically.Almost everything, at any rate.It is not true that if you put a statue of Saint Isidore the Farmer in the yard you will have a good crop year.Is there a statue of the saint in the garden?My mother has one in the garden, yes.Also Saint Maria and the Virgin.Not overwhelming in size, but obvious.And her garden is plentiful.They were quiet on the phone for a moment.Matt?Why did you really call me?Peyton asked the same question.What did you tell her?I told her there was a special bonding moment when I groped you and you knocked me out...She laughed almost uncontrollably for a moment.Really, he said.Its because you felt like a friend.Strange as it might feel to you, I think we somehow became friends.I hope youre okay with that.She smiled.Everyone can use a friend.* * * Ray Anne had a sweet little hideaway on top of the garage, a deck.From there she had a great view of storms rolling in over the bay.Or, when it wasnt storming, just starlight so deep and wide it was otherworldly.She and Al dragged out the bean bag chairs, he had a beer and she had a glass of wine.They reclined together, talked about their week, he told her about the boys and she reported on Ginger, who seemed to be doing better all the time.They kissed and fondled and made sneaky love under a blanket, then talked some more.It was almost eleven when Al carried down the bean bags and blanket and Ray Anne carried her glass and his bottle.They stood in the kitchen for a moment, safe in each others arms, reluctant to say good night.There was a sound in the house, a soft lilting coming from the bedroom.They both froze to listen.Oh, God, thats Ginger!Ray Anne said.Shes crying!She turned to go to her.Al grabbed her hand, stopping her.Ray, he whispered.Listen!She froze and listened.With their arms around each others waists, they moved closer to the bedroom door.Shes laughing, Ray Anne whispered.Shes talking on the phone and laughing!Al smiled down at her.I dont think she needs rescuing.Who in the world is she talking to?Laughing with?Maybe if youre very sneaky, you can worm it out of her.A New Hope        Four Matt had talked with Ginger for over an hour and hed congratulated himself that hed been rightshe was a genuine person who could be a friend with no agenda to redesign him.She wasnt a woman who wanted to sleep with him and then change him into at least a boyfriend, at best a husband.They didnt talk about it, but it was implicitly understood they were both too vulnerable to take on new partners.Ginger, like Matt, was in recovery from her own short, extremely disappointing marriage.And yet they had so many things in common.More than Ginger realized.No doubt she thought it was just their divorces.That was enough.But Matt, who had dated half of Portland, knew it was more.It was as though it balanced with his loss somehow.Shed wanted a family and fate had cruelly snatched it away from her.He wanted a family and hadnt had a chance at that.They might never talk about these things, he realized.He really didnt want to tell her or anyone how selfish and cruel his ex wife had been.But here was Matt with a new friend and he felt very tender toward her.He wasnt about to get involved, but she had already changed everything.He was going to stop fucking everything that moved, for one thing.That hadnt worked for him and hed probably hurt people in the process.He was going to clean up his act, show gratitude for friends and family and carry on in a much more chivalrous manner.Hed done a few insensitive, careless things himselfhe wasnt proud of that.Somehow Ginger reminded him that at his core he was a good man.He would at least behave in a way that wouldnt shame his mother and infuriate his father.Matt already had an idea of where hed like to build a house, if Paco agreed.On the far side of the orchard, just within sight of his parents home, there was a perfect spot.From the front he would see the grove, from the back, the mountains, to the west the big house.Hed have to grade a road.He tried sketching out a floor plan.He had inherited many of his fathers ways, but living lean to the bone wasnt one of them.He was frugal but he intended to have plenty of bathrooms in the house and an indulgently big master bedroom and bath.Hed be more than happy to extend the use of those extra bedrooms to the family who showed up at shearing and harvest to help them.Even though he didnt watch a lot of TV, there would be at least two in his house.And they would be large.Later in the week, he called Ginger again.Ive taken to sketching out a floor plan that I think I like and Ive learned something important.Oh?Whats that?Architects are geniuses.Do you have any idea how hard it is to string a bunch of rooms and hallways together?The rooms I want to be the largest look the smallest on the drawing and vice versa.I think I took mechanical drawing in high school.How come I cant do this?Just be sure to put those sliding shelves in the kitchen, she said.Huh?Well, you open a lower cupboard door and pull the shelf out instead of getting down on your hands and knees and practically crawling in to find what you need.Theyre so awesome!He was quiet for a moment.Ginger, Im going to live next door to my mother, who will probably cook almost every meal I eat.I wont even be able to fill the kitchen cupboards.That may not be the case forever, she said.I know you dont think so now, but you might actually get over this marriage phobia and meet someone nice who wants to live on the farm.And cook.In that kitchen.Highly unlikely.Will you?Get over it?Try again?Sure, she said.When Im fifty.I might just look you up when were fifty, he said.Then if it works out, you can put in the sliding shelves.That seems pretty reasonable, she said.And they both laughed.Whats happening in Thunder Point?A lot, as a matter of fact.Grace has been spending a lot of time at the new house so she can get her mother moved here.You know, I told you, her mother has ALS and is weakening by the day.Graces fianc is helping her whenever he can because he really wants Grace to meet his family and theyre having trouble finding a time to do that.She cant move her mother into the house and leave her to go south to meet Troys family.And he hasnt told his family that Grace is pregnant because he said they will all immediately pile into cars and head this way, invited or not.So...everyone around town is putting every effort toward getting that house ready for them.Even me.That stretch of beach has taken on a life of its ownits like a barn raising.Sounds like the Lacoumette family, he said.Peyton confirmed that.Except for the cultural dress, wine and dancing, it looks like it, too.Peyton is out there, too?Sometimes.Shes busy with the clinic and Scotts pretty busy with the clinic and being on call.But they cant seem to stay away.If theyre not out there working, theyre checking on the progress.They talked for over an hour and covered every subject.They laughed a lot; they were both good at puns.There was even a little cautious flirting going on, starting with hooking up at the age of fifty and touching on her reassurance that she was now convinced he could be a gentleman.Didnt you tell me youre usually asleep by eight oclock?she asked.I think Ive been a little excited about the prospect of getting out of this apartment.Its almost ten.Late for me, he said.For me, too.Ive been getting up very early to get into the shop and get things rolling so that when Grace comes in, she feels comfortable leaving it in my hands so she can do what she has to do.Youre vying for employee of the year, he said.Id far rather be awarded friend of the year.When they hung up Matt lay on his back on his bed with his phone in his hand.The phone was hot.Matt was hot.I have to stay away from Thunder Point, he thought.Very scary place to go.Ginger was so sweet.So kind and generous.Here she was, still hurting after being treated like crap by her husband and losing a baby she was devoted to, and what concerned her most right now was helping Grace and Troy, helping her new friends.Ginger didnt have a single sharp edge anywhere.She was pleasant, soft, unselfish...nice.She was nice.Mad Matt never thought about that when he thought about women, at least not lately.He thought about long legs and perky boobs.He thought about pretty, buoyant, confident and lively.When he fell for Natalie he was willing to make almost any compromise to keep her satisfied, to keep her home, but he hadnt ever once thought about if she was unselfish or how caring.He thought about not forcing her to deal with his overbearing family too much, about trying to balance her need for fun and a social life with his need for sleep, about trying to be sure none of the farm stayed on his hands or boots when he went home to her.Ginger was so nice, but she was not bland.When laughter took her by surprise, she sounded wicked and playful, which triggered his memory of her smile.Her smile could melt a mans heart.And he loved those freckles.Maybe it was the freckles that made her seem almost childlike to him, innocent, in need of a strong arm.Stay away from Thunder Point, he told himself.The thing about Matthed been with a lot of women, before and after Natalie.He wasnt bad looking, he was pretty smart, usually stable.Before Nat he was probably searching for someone permanent without really acknowledging it.After Nat he was looking for a way to get over her.But there was one thing, probably a cultural thing, a family traitmarriage was sacred.He didnt need a High Mass wedding to feel that way, it was just a thing with him.Once you pledged yourself to a woman, she became everything.Naturally it followed that he would be her everything, that she would do anything to see him happy and content.Between them there would always be complete honesty, trust.Everything would be shared, discussed, dealt with as a team.It was true that he had some firm, unshakable beliefs.That kind of went with the Lacoumette territory, especially the men.Stubbornness and passion might prevail, they might act like the king of their castle, but it was all a show.The women ran the castle.The men worked tirelessly to support their families and they served their women.He spent Saturday around the farm though his father and George hadnt been expecting him.If it wasnt crazy season, he usually took a couple of days off a week.On Sunday morning, he woke at four like a bad habit.He showered and got in his truck.He grabbed a fast food breakfast he could eat on the road and he drove south.Fast, along a deserted highway.He was in Thunder Point before nine in the morning.He drove right out to the parking lot behind Coopers place.It was no mystery where the action wasthere was already a lot of activity around the third house down from the bar.The garage door stood open, and three men he happened to know were armed with paint rollers and painting the inside walls of the garage.A truck holding four large ceramic planters filled with small trees was parked on the road.Hey, what are you doing here?Cooper asked Matt.I heard there was a barn raising and I was curious, thought Id check this out.And since Im here, maybe you can use a hand.I didnt know you were coming down, Scott Grant said.Scott was covered in paint and it was still early.Are you staying over?Cant.Monday morning Paco is snapping his whip early.Were temporarily caught up at the farm and I had a day, so...Does Peyton know youre here?Did you stop by the house?I didnt.Didnt call her, either.Spur of the moment.What can I do?I dont know, Cooper said.Project manager is Troy.Really, its Grace, but shes letting him think hes running things.Last time I saw him he was struggling with the light fixture in the kitchen.Apparently its complicated...I got that, Matt said with a laugh.When he got inside, Troy was apparently supervising while a big guy in a blue T shirt was on a ladder installing track lighting.He was introduced to Al, whose name hed heard in conjunction with Ray Anne.The great room was cluttered with furniture covered in plastic, several boxes and picture crates.And a lot of women with rags, mops, brooms and shelf paper were opening boxes, looking things over, organizing.Matt!Troy said in surprise.Matt?a tall curly haired woman he couldnt remember asked.Iris, this is Matt Lacoumette, Peytons brother, Ray Anne Dysart said.I cant believe youre here.Last minute, I know, but I thought since I had a day, maybe I could help.They all eagerly accepted the offer.Ginger, a kerchief tying back her strawberry blond hair, flushing slightly under her freckles, just smiled at him.He smiled right back at her.Were down to finishing touches, Grace said.Lots of finishing touches.Furniture was just delivered, my mothers assistant shipped some personal and household items that have to be put away after the cupboards and closets are cleaned, the basement and garage are getting painted today, light fixtures and bathroom fixtures have to be installed as well as washer and dryer hookup.And obviously serious cleanup.Whats your pleasure?I can clean like I was trained by Corinne Lacoumette and Im pretty fast with a screwdriver.Great.Youve got bathroom fixtures.Four bathrooms, the fixtures all in boxes in the bathrooms.One loft bathroom, master and main floor bathrooms, one bathroom downstairs.Ill go get my toolbox, he said, leaving them.As he was walking out to his truck, he heard the unmistakable sound of women giggling and whispering.And it made him smile.He remembered something Paco had told him long ago: try fooling women all you want, youll never get away with anything.How true.He wanted to stay away from Ginger; he wanted to be with her if he could.Everyone worked ferociously and work crews came and went.Cooper went home to take care of his little daughter and tend his bar while his helper, an old guy named Rawley, replaced him.Al left to go to work, Devon left to go home and Spencer replaced hersomeone had to watch the kids and this work in progress was no place for little ones.Peyton showed up and apparently got the word Matt was on the premises right away because she found him in the downstairs bathroom, head in the cabinet under the sink with a wrench, fixing a leaky pipe.I suppose you think youre fooling someone, she said.He sat up abruptly and hit his head.He scooted out cautiously.Women, it seemed, were a serious threat to his cranium.I dont know what youre talking about.Why are you here?she said.Ginger told me about this project, about the urgency because Graces mother is not well, and I am a very neighborly guy.She completely ignored his virtues.Youre pursuing Ginger and I told you not to.It makes no sense.Its not like you two got off to a good start.Peyton, he said very patiently.Boxers are sometimes friendly outside the ring.On weekends defense attorneys play golf with prosecutors.But youre wrong, Im not pursuing her.Weve talked a couple of times and neither of us is interested in a new relationship.For obvious reasons.Weve sworn off, all right?But were friends now.This is a bad idea.Bugger off, he said.And dont piss me off.Or what?Huh?I will do something terrible to you, without causing you any distress to your pregnancy.But youll never forget it, it will be so bad and dangerous.How can you talk like that to your pregnant sister?Gee, I dont know, he said.Didnt you threaten to castrate me?Now, leave me alone.I can pick my own friends.And for your information, Ginger is very nice.I know!And she likes me!Matt said, standing up and facing her.Why is it youre so upset at the idea of me being friends with her?I admit, I made an awful mistake at your wedding, but shes accepted my apology and Ive been perfectly perfect.Thats now, she said.Youve been...Well, Matt, you have a reputation.A love em and leave em reputation.Thats the last thing a nice girl like Ginger needs right now.He got it.Everyone thought he left Natalie because of a lot of annoying arguing.Because no one knew the whole story.And no one could know.Okay, okay.I give you my word, were friends and I will not do anything to hurt Ginger.I like her.Shes a good person.Im here today because she told me how everyone is helping Grace and Troy so they can get their families together and get married and I thought it was sweet and kind.She told me you and Scott were helping, even though you have little kids and a clinic to run.She told me she was going to be here all day working, even though she worked all week at the flower shop.I came to help.Thats why I came.You swear?she asked.I swear.Now, can I get back to my plumbing?She gave him one last withering glare, then left him.She was no longer his favorite sister.He rubbed his head.He bet no one ever accused Peyton of being a kind girl.No one who was related to her and really knew her at any rate.After the plumbing fixtures, he helped finish installing a couple of light fixtures, something Troy seemed to find a challenge.Coopers wife, Sarah, brought over a huge tray of sandwiches from Coopers bar.Right behind her was Cooper with a cooler full of cold drinks for everyone.The work party moved out to the deck to picnic in the warm afternoon sun, and Matt had to focus his attention on the men because his nosy sister wouldnt leave.After lunch, they were down to cleaning so that the area rugs could be rolled out, furniture uncovered and placed, kitchenware and linens put into drawers, closets and cupboards, beds made up.The cleaning went from top to bottom, cupboards, countertops first, floors last.He bravely took his life in his hands and joined Ginger in the kitchen.I was so surprised to see you, she said.What a good guy you must be, driving all the way down here to help out.Tell my sister, will you?That Im a good guy.I have two brothers, she said, laughing.I know about that brother sister thing.Not easy.Youll just have to be satisfied that I think youre good.Thank you.I have to drive back tonight.We start early on Monday mornings.But I brought a change of clothes.I could clean up at Peytons house and we could go out for something to eat.Something casual.Mexican?You like Mexican?I love Mexican!Thatll save us a phone call.You know a place around here?Because Im new in town, she reminded him.Ill find one.Someone around here will know a good place.I dont want you to stay too late and drive home tired...But Im here, Ginger.Lets do something.Fun.Lets have some fun.Arent you having fun?she asked him with a wicked grin.He leaned toward her.Im glad to help, but I came for you.Just, dont tell my sister.Why not?Because Peyton thinks Im a bad bet.And Im getting real sick of hearing about it.* * * Peyton watched Matt and Ginger from the deck as she swept up crumbs and collected empty cans and plastic bottles from lunch.Scott and Spencer carried a large potted plant through the house and out to the deck, placing it where theyd been told to.Then Scott was by Peytons side.If you frown and scowl and brood like that any longer, youre going to wrinkle, he told his wife.As soon as Matt leaves Ginger alone, hes going to get an earful of my opinion of his behavior, she muttered.Scott grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her to face the bay.He put an arm around her, holding her there.No.Hes not, Scott said.Youre going to keep your mouth shut.Huh?Listen, I can handle him.I said, no, Scott said firmly.I command you.She glanced up at him and laughed.Figures you would think thats funny.I want you to listen to me, Peyton, because when it comes to your family, youre a little on the blind and deaf side.He might be a little brother to you, but youre not in charge of him anymore.You have to leave him alone.Hes thirty and hes obviously experienced some difficult times.Hes been divorced over a year.And that marriage, it was very short and very miserable.And Ive only known the Lacoumette family for a year and the whole time Matt has been silent.A little cranky.Very absent.Your mother and some of your sibs have apologized for him, said he was one of the best natured men in the family.That short marriage obviously took its toll and hes been nursing some big wounds.And hes been coping by having a different woman every week!Peyton, hes smiling.Hes laughing.For that matter, I havent seen Ginger look so good since Ive met hershes smiling and laughing.Hanging out with my brother, she could get hurt!If you get in his business any further, youre going to get hurt.Youre going to get spanked!And just what big man is going to do that?she asked, laughter in her voice.This big man, your lord and master, he said.Oh, youre really pushing it...Were going to finish up here, grab the kids from next door where theyre watching a movie and were going to go home, without saying one word, because if it were you in there, flirting with me, and someone got in your way, youd be furious.Theyre adults.They appear to like each other.Theyre two people who have been through a lot and theyre having a good time for once.I suspect they know more about what they need right now than you do.He shook his head.Youve got a really scary big sister thing going on.Dont be a bully.She gasped.I just dont want either one of them to go down the wrong path with the wrong person.It seems dangerous to me.And I dont approve of the way Matt has handled himself the past year or so, but hes my brother.I love him.It wont make me feel good to see him hurt, either.After all, the past couple of years has been hard on everyone.I know.Letting go isnt easy.But Im right about this.He has to find his own way.And Ginger does, too.You told Matt about Ginger.Matt isnt going to use and abuse her.Can you really imagine he would?He might be your naughty little brother, but Ive gotten to know him.He probably wouldnt, she relented.I saw a sweetheart side of Matt today I didnt even know existed and Ive known him for a year, Scott said.Hes not fooling anybodyhes here because he heard about this barn raising from Ginger.He says they arent involved, she said.That theyve sworn off relationships.And maybe they have.But something there is helping them heal.When I let you turn around, look at them.Theyre enjoying each other, enjoying the day.Theyre up to their armpits in hard, dirty work and theyre smiling like kids.Honey, I want you to do something you have a hard time doing.I want you to have no opinion.Oh, now None.Zero.Nada.Now youre making me sound like a real buttinski!Like Im in everyones business!Youre related to half of northern Oregon, Peyton.And you are certainly not the only one in the family who butts in.Well...its a hot blooded family.Will you stay out of his business?Out of hers?All right, all right.Hey, you dont have some kind of spanking fantasy, do you?He grinned at her.Only if its you spanking me.He turned her around.Look, he said, indicating the couple in the kitchen.Ginger had a knee on Matts shoulder while she reached for the highest cupboard above the refrigerator with a rag; he braced her with hands stretched up and holding her at the waist.He snuck one hand upward to tickle her ribs, but he held her safely.She laughed as she wiped out the cupboard, and he lowered her to the floor gently.You going to leave that alone?Scott asked Peyton.Yes, she said tiredly.And Im not spanking you.Oh, nuts, he said, laughing at her.* * * The house on the hill above the beach was empty of helpers now.Smoke was rising from Coopers grill on his deck two doors down.There were people walking along the beach and as the sun set, lights from the town were starting to pop up like fireflies.Grace sat on one of the newly acquired chairs next to the newly acquired outdoor table, facing the ocean.Troy trudged up the outside deck stairs, wiping his hands on a rag.Thats that.Downstairs bathroom is scrubbed and outside deck swept.I havent put the sheets on the bed down there, but it wouldnt take five minutes if you want to stay here tonight.Makes more sense to go to your loft, though, where all your stuff is.We can get moved in this week, unless you changed your mind...She looked at him with moist eyes.They did this for us, she said softly.They cleaned, installed, unpacked, hung pictures.The window guy is putting in the shutters tomorrow.Its ready, Troy.Our friends got it ready.He sat down in the chair next to her.Because they dont want us to say I do minutes before I have to rush you to the hospital.You really want to move here right away?You dont want to let your mother settle in first?Once we have furniture in the game room itll be just like our own apartment.You can store your toys in the garage.After we let your parents use your apartment for their visit, we can bring your couch over for downstairs.Then you can give up the apartment and we can live here.Listen, weve talked about this a little bit, but this is serious business.Even though that downstairs is like a private residence, well be living with your mother, your old Russian coachbecause we both know hes never leavingand there will hopefully be nursing help.I cant have my pregnant wife making them all comfortable, directing traffic or waiting on an invalid day and night.Were going to have to agree on how were going to handle this situation.Gracie, its not going to be easy.It usually takes a staff of five to manage her.I know.I think well be okay.Schools out soon.Maybe we can tell your family on the phone, move into this house, let your family use the apartment and the loft for a visit and just get married while theyre here.On the beach?He pulled her close.I married you in my head weeks ago.We should give my son a proper name.Its a girl, Troy.Its a boy, Gracie.I know it.Its a girl.Bet?When can we find out?I dont know.Twenty weeks?We have things to do, Troy.Next we have to make a baby room.Weve just done so much.Can we have a day off?Im going to call my mother tomorrow and tell her the house is ready.I think she can be up here by the end of the week.Ill call my mom and dad tomorrow, too, he said.Are you going to insist your name be Gracie Dillon Banks Headly?Im going with Headly, she said.The most adorable history teacher at Thunder Point High.Not adorable, Grace.Hot.The girls think Im hot.A New Hope        Five When I was a little girl I made very little houses, Ginger told Matt.They sat at a small table in a dimly lit Mexican restaurant.She nursed a glass of wine and he had a beer and there were chips and salsa on the table.She had a plate of enchiladas and he had a mammoth burrito.I made miniature houses and people out of everythingQ tips, cotton balls, pipe cleaners, shoe boxes, paper cups and paper clips.I used twigs and flowers and leaves and gum wrappers.Eventually, when I had the supplies, I used cardboard, paper and glue.In winter when I was outside I used snow and made castles.When I was about seven my parents gave me a great big dollhouse for Christmasthe obvious gift, right?And I wanted nothing to do with it.It just sat in a corner of my bedroom because I liked the sloppy little houses I built.All little girls play house, he said.My sisters played house.Peyton was always the mother.And she was a very strict mother.Whats your earliest memory?she asked him.Hmm.Im not sure if its an early memory or some family story thats been repeated so often I think I remember it.It might be when Mikie showed up.My parents had two cribs and a bassinet in their bedroom.We were all lined up to meet him.Ellie was two, Sal was one and Mikie was in the bassinet by the bed.My mother said, This is your new brother, Michael, and from now on your father is sleeping in the barn.I didnt know what that meant for a long time.Eight kids in a little over ten years.She laughed happily at that.You have little leprechauns in your eyes.My mothers side of the family, I guess.Were the only green eyed members of the family.And Ive met most of the Lacoumettesno leprechauns there, I think.Thats for sure, he said.He put down his fork.What happened to your marriage?The marriage?she asked, like that was an odd question.Matt, I told you, I fell for a musician.A singer with a guitar.He played other instruments, too, but mostly guitar and piano.What I didnt tell you, I was a groupie.He was in and out of Portland and for three years I followed his gigs.He called when he was in town or even near town, like Seattle or Vancouver or Astoria, and would ask me to come.It was nothing for me to drive three hours just to be with him.On and off, off and on.Hes ten years older and even though hes had a few breaks here and there, he doesnt really have a pot to piss in.He wasnt interested in marriage or family or settling down, though he did move in with me because I had a freestanding garage he could use as a studio.So one night when he said, Hey, babe, maybe we should just get married, I jumped on it.Brilliant, yes?I was all over it because hey, I was over twenty five by that time and all Id ever really wanted was to be a wife and mother.So I married a self centered, absent, maybe even adulterous musician who rarely remembered to even call me.My mother thought Id lost my mind.My brothers hated him.My father still wants to kill him.I married him as fast as I could before he changed his mind.We were married for seven days when he got a job in San Francisco of uncertain duration and he not only took it, he said I wouldnt enjoy myself, given his terrible hours, and besides, I had to work.He said hed probably be back in a few weeks.Turned out it was sooner, but he left again a week later, that time for a month.When I tried to talk to him about it he said, Hey, I told you Id be a lousy husband.Im just not into it.My music is really important to me and Im so close.Baby, Im so close.And you love my music.Also, he usually needed money.And I stupidly gave him what I could.Matts mouth hung open.He was speechless.If there was one thing about the Lacoumette men, they would die before theyd live off a woman.Youre making this up.She gave him a rather patient smile.I could not make it up.I fell for a singer because he had what I thought was a beautiful voice and I believed that once he saw how happy I could make him, he would never want to leave me again.Ohhe would write music and play music, but our love for each other would come first.That was the lie I told myself.There was one part of the equation I hadnt taken into consideration.He didnt love me.You married him when he hadnt even said he loved you?Matt asked.Of course he said it, she said.He said it all the time, along with a lot of beautiful things.Sometimes I even heard them again and again in songs he wrote.He was extremely romantic.But he didnt mean them.Hes a poet, Matt.A dreamer.A liar.And you left him?Sort of.I left after he told me he just couldnt do itthat whole traditional marriage and family thing.He sat me down, told me how wonderful I was, how he didnt deserve meboy, wasnt that the truth.And he said it just wasnt for him.No wait, he said it wasnt his scene.She took a sip of her wine.I thought hed change his mind, come around.He didnt.I know you know, Matt.That I lost a baby to SIDS.How do you know I know?Because everyone knows.Its kind of strangeI thought that might be terrible, having everyone know.But its not.Its easier, in a way.Because I dont have to explain to anyone that yes, I have baggage.Heavy baggage.My newly pregnant friends are so carefulthey try not to talk about their happy new pregnancies too much.I wish they didnt have to guard my emotions like that.But its so thoughtful, dont you think?Im sorry, Ginger.Sorry for your loss.Yes, Peyton told me.If she hadnt, I dont know how I would have guessed.You seem...The sentence trailed off.Normal?she asked.Catch me some early, early morning when I wake up from a dream and cant breathe.Or maybe on a sunny afternoon when I wonder if hed be walking yet.Or in a store when I see something that would look so cute on him.She took another sip of her wine.Or maybe, take a look at me having dinner with a beautiful man I can never be more than friends with because my track record is...just...too much.I dont even make sense to myself.What was I thinking?You have to remember, my track record sucks, too, he reminded her.How long did it last?Your marriage?About three years.He smiled.I made it seven months.I didnt fall for a singer but I did fall for the prettiest girl in the biology department.She was a part time model.Completely self absorbed.She thinks farming is inconvenient, dirty and boring.We have completely different values.Maybe we should introduce her to Mick.Hes anything but boring.Wait a second.Mick?My ex.Mick Cantrell.His real name is Edwardhe changed it to Mick because he thought it was sexier.Youre kidding, right?he asked.He dunked another chip.I shouldve known better.Hell, she told me she didnt want to be a farm wife.And Mick told me being a husband and father wasnt his scene.I hope youre not still in love with him, Matt said.I dont think I am.Not only wouldnt I give him another chance, he doesnt want one.But dont give me any credit for being smart therejust look at what I put up with first.But you?Are you still...?He shrugged.It would be terrible to lie to her.Some days, he said.When I have those days that I dont understand why everything went to hell.
