thirty   I booked a meeting with Claudia at the usual caf to discuss social behavior.I realized that improving my ability to interact with other humans would require some effort and that my best attempts might not convince Rosie.But the skills would be useful in their own right.I had, to some extent, become comfortable with being socially odd.At school, I had been the unintentional class clown and eventually the intentional one.It was time to grow up.The server approached our table.You order, said Claudia.What would you like?A skinny decaf latte.This is a ridiculous form of coffee, but I did not point it out.Claudia would surely have received the message from previous occasions and would not want it repeated.It would be annoying to her.Id like a double espresso, I said to the server, and my friend will have a skinny decaf latte, no sugar, please.Well, said Claudia.Somethings changed.I pointed out that I had been successfully and politely ordering coffee all my life, but Claudia insisted that my mode of interaction had changed in subtle ways.I wouldnt have picked New York City as the place to learn to be genteel, she said, but there you go.I told her that, on the contrary, people had been extremely friendly, citing my experience with Dave the Baseball Fan, Mary the bipolar disorder researcher, David Borenstein the dean of medicine at Columbia, and the chef and weird guy at Momofuku Ko.I mentioned that we had dined with the Eslers, describing them as friends of Rosies family.Claudias conclusion was simple.All this unaccustomed social interaction, plus that with Rosie, had dramatically improved my skills.You dont need to try with Gene and me, because youre not out to impress us or make friends with us.While Claudia was right about the value of practice, I learn better from reading and observation.My next task was to download some educational material.I decided to begin with romantic films specifically mentioned by Rosie.There were four: Casablanca, The Bridges of Madison County, When Harry Met Sally, and An Affair to Remember.I added To Kill a Mockingbird and The Big Country for Gregory Peck, whom Rosie had cited as the sexiest man ever.It took a full week to watch all six, including time for pausing the DVD player and taking notes.The films were incredibly useful but also highly challenging.The emotional dynamics were so complex!I persevered, drawing on movies recommended by Claudia about male female relationships with both happy and unhappy outcomes.I watched Hitch, Gone with the Wind, Bridget Joness Diary, Annie Hall, Notting Hill, Love Actually, and Fatal Attraction.Claudia also suggested I watch As Good as It Gets, just for fun.Although her advice was to use it as an example of what not to do, I was impressed that the Jack Nicholson character handled a jacket problem with more finesse than I had.It was also encouraging that, despite serious social incompetence, a significant difference in age between him and the Helen Hunt character, probable multiple psychiatric disorders, and a level of intolerance far more severe than mine, he succeeded in winning the love of the woman in the end.An excellent choice by Claudia.Slowly I began to make sense of it all.There were certain consistent principles of behavior in male female romantic relationships, including the prohibition of infidelity.That rule was in my mind when I met with Claudia again for social practice.We worked through some scenarios.This meal has a fault, I said.The situation was hypothetical.We were only drinking coffee.That would be too confrontational, correct?Claudia agreed.And dont say fault or error.Thats computer talk.But I can say, Im sorry, it was an error of judgment, entirely my fault, correct?That use of fault is acceptable?Correct, said Claudia, and then laughed.I mean yes.Don, this takes years to learn.I didnt have years.But I am a quick learner and was in human sponge mode.I demonstrated.Im going to construct an objective statement followed by a request for clarification, and preface it with a platitude: Excuse me.I ordered a rare steak.Do you have a different definition of rare?Good start, but the questions a bit aggressive.Not acceptable?In New York maybe.Dont blame the waiter.I modified the question.Excuse me.I ordered a rare steak.Could you check that my order was processed correctly?Claudia nodded.But she did not look entirely happy.I was paying great attention to expressions of emotion, and I had diagnosed hers correctly.Don.Im impressed, but ...changing to meet someone elses expectations may not be a good idea.You may end up resenting it.I didnt think this was likely.I was learning some new protocols, that was all.If you really love someone, Claudia continued, you have to be prepared to accept them as they are.Maybe you hope that one day they get a wake up call and make the changes for their own reasons.This last statement connected with the fidelity rule that I had in my mind at the beginning of the discussion.I did not need to raise the subject now.I had the answer to my question.Claudia was surely talking about Gene.I organized a run with Gene for the following morning.I needed to speak to him in private, somewhere he could not escape.I started my personal lecture as soon as we were moving.My key point was that infidelity was totally unacceptable.Any benefits were outweighed by the risk of total disaster.Gene had been divorced once already.Eugenie and Carl  Gene interrupted, breathing heavily.In my effort to get the message across unambiguously and forcefully, I had been running faster than normal.Gene is significantly less fit than I am and my fat burning, low heart rate jogs are major cardiovascular workouts for him.I hear you, said Gene.Whatve you been reading?I told him about the movies I had been watching and their idealized representation of acceptable and unacceptable behavior.If Gene and Claudia had owned a rabbit, it would have been in serious danger from a disgruntled lover.Gene disagreed, not about the rabbit but about the impact of his behavior on his marriage.Were psychologists, he said.We can handle an open marriage.I ignored his incorrect categorization of himself as a real psychologist and focused on the central issue: all authorities and moral codes consider fidelity critical.Even theories of evolutionary psychology concede that if a person discovers that their partner is unfaithful, they will have strong reasons for rejecting them.Youre talking about men there, said Gene.Because they cant afford the risk of raising a child who doesnt have their genes.Anyway, I thought you were all about overcoming instinct.Correct.The male instinct is to cheat.You need to overcome it.Women accept it as long as you dont embarrass them with it.Look at France.I cited a counterexample from a popular book and film.Bridget Joness Diary?said Gene.Since when are we expected to behave like characters in chick flicks?He stopped and doubled over, gasping for breath.It gave me the opportunity to present him with the evidence without interruption.I finished by pointing out that he loved Claudia and that he should therefore be prepared to make all necessary sacrifices.Ill think about it when I see you changing the habits of a lifetime, he said.I had thought that eliminating my schedule would be relatively straightforward.I had just spent eight days without it, and while I had faced numerous problems, they were not related to inefficiency or unstructured time.But I had not factored in the impact of the enormous amount of turmoil in my life.As well as the uncertainty around Rosie, the social skills project, and the fear that my best friends were on the path to domestic disintegration, I was about to lose my job.The schedule of activities felt like the only stable thing in my life.In the end, I made a compromise that would surely be acceptable to Rosie.Everyone keeps a timetable of their regular commitments, in my case lectures, meetings, and martial arts classes.I would allow myself these.I would put appointments in my diary, as other people did, but reduce standardization.Things could change week by week.Reviewing my decision, I could see that the abandonment of the Standardized Meal System, the aspect of my schedule that provoked the most comment, was the only item requiring immediate attention.My next market visit was predictably strange.I arrived at the seafood stall and the proprietor turned to pull a lobster from the tank.Change of plan, I said.Whats good today?Lobster, he said, in his heavily accented English.Lobster good every Tuesday for you.He laughed, and waved his hand at his other customers.He was making a joke about me.Rosie had a facial expression that she used when she said, Dont fuck with me.I tried the expression.It seemed to work by itself.Im joking, he said.Swordfish is beautiful.Oysters.You eat oysters?I ate oysters, though I had never prepared them at home.I ordered them unshucked, as quality restaurants promoted their oysters as being freshly shucked.I arrived home with a selection of food not associated with any particular recipe.The oysters proved challenging.I could not get a knife in to open them without risking injury to my hand through slippage.I could have looked up the technique on the Internet, but it would have taken time.This was why I had a schedule based around familiar items.I could remove the meat from a lobster with my eyes closed while my brain worked on a genetics problem.What was wrong with standardization?Another oyster failed to provide an opening for my knife.I was getting annoyed and about to throw the full dozen in the trash when I had an idea.I put one in the microwave and heated it for a few seconds.It opened easily.It was warm but delicious.I tried a second, this time adding a squeeze of lemon juice and a grind of pepper.Sensational!I could feel a whole world opening up to me.I hoped the oysters were sustainable, because I wanted to share my new skills with Rosie.thirty one   My focus on self improvement meant that I had little time to consider and respond to the Deans threat of dismissal.I had decided not to take up Genes offer to construct an alibi; now that the breach of rules was in my conscious mind, it would be a violation of my personal integrity to compound the error.I succeeded in suppressing thoughts of my professional future but could not stop the Deans parting comment about Kevin Yu and my plagiarism complaint from intruding into my conscious mind.After much thought, I concluded that the Dean was not offering me an unethical deal: Withdraw the complaint and you can keep your job.What she said was bothering me because I had myself broken the rules in pursuing the Father Project.Gene had once told me a religious joke when I questioned the morality of his behavior.Jesus addresses the angry mob who are stoning a prostitute: Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.A stone flies through the air and hits the woman.Jesus turns around and says, Sometimes you really piss me off, Mother.I could no longer be equated with the Virgin Mary.I had been corrupted.I was like everyone else.My stone casting credibility had been significantly compromised.I summoned Kevin to a meeting in my office.He was from mainland China and aged approximately twenty eight (estimated BMI nineteen).I interpreted his expression and demeanor as nervous.I had his essay, partly or entirely written by his tutor, in my hand and showed it to him.I asked the obvious question: Why had he not written it himself?He averted his gazewhich I interpreted as a cultural signal of respect rather than of shiftinessbut instead of answering my question, he started to explain the consequences of his probable expulsion.He had a wife and child in China and had not yet told them of the problem.He hoped someday to emigrate or, if not, at least to work in genetics.His unwise behavior would mean the end of his dreams and those of his wife, who had managed for almost four years without him.He was crying.In the past, I would have regarded this as sad but irrelevant.A rule had been broken.But now I was also a rule breaker.I had not broken the rules deliberately, or at least not with any conscious thought.Perhaps Kevins behavior had been similarly unconsidered.I asked Kevin, What are the principal arguments advanced against the use of genetically modified crops?The essay had been on the ethical and legal issues raised by advances in genetics.Kevin gave a comprehensive summary.I followed with further questions, which Kevin also answered well.He seemed to have a good knowledge of the topic.Why didnt you write this yourself?I asked.I am a scientist.I am not confident writing in English about moral and cultural questions.I wanted to be sure not to fail.I did not think.I did not know how to respond to Kevin.Acting without thinking was anathema to me, and I did not want to encourage it in future scientists.Nor did I want my own weakness to affect a correct decision regarding Kevin.I would pay for my own error in this regard, as I deserved to.But losing my job would not have the same consequences for me as expulsion would for Kevin.I doubted he would be offered a potentially lucrative partnership in a cocktail bar as an alternative.I thought for quite a long time.Kevin just sat.He must have realized that I was considering some form of reprieve.But I was incredibly uncomfortable in this position of judgment as I weighed the impact of various decisions.Was this what the Dean had to do every day?For the first time, I felt some respect for her.I was not confident I could solve the problem in a short time.But I realized that it would be cruel to leave Kevin wondering if his life had been destroyed.I understand ..I started, and realized that this was not a phrase I was accustomed to using when talking about people.I stopped the sentence and thought for a while longer.I will create a supplementary taskprobably an essay on personal ethics.As an alternative to expulsion.I interpreted Kevins expression as ecstatic.I was conscious that there was more to social skills than knowing how to order coffee and being faithful to your partner.Since my school days, I had selected my clothes without regard to fashion.I started out not caring how I looked, then discovered that people found what I wore amusing.I enjoyed being seen as someone not tied to the norms of society.But now I had no idea how to dress.I asked Claudia to buy me some suitable clothes.She had proved her expertise with the jeans and shirt, but she insisted on my accompanying her.I may not be around forever, she said.After some reflection, I deduced that she was talking not about death but about something more immediate: marriage failure!I had to find a way to convince Gene of the danger.The actual shopping took a full morning.We went to several shops, acquiring shoes, pants, a jacket, a second pair of jeans, more shirts, a belt, and even a tie.I had more shopping to do, but I did not require Claudias help.A photo was sufficient to specify my requirements.I visited the optometrist, the hairdresser (not my regular barber), and the menswear shop.Everyone was extremely helpful.My schedule and social skills had now been brought into line with conventional practice, to the best of my ability within the time I had allocated.The Don Project was complete.It was time to commence the Rosie Project.On the inside of the closet in my office there was a mirror which I had never needed before.Now I used it to review my appearance.I expected I would have only one chance to cut through Rosies negative view of me and produce an emotional reaction.I wanted her to fall in love with me.Protocol dictated that I should not wear a hat indoors, but I decided that the PhD students area could be considered public.On that basis, it would be acceptable.I checked the mirror again.Rosie had been right.In my gray three piece suit, I could be mistaken for Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird.Atticus Tillman.Worlds sexiest man.Rosie was at her desk.So was Stefan, looking unshaven as always.I had my speech prepared.Good afternoon, Stefan.Hi, Rosie.Rosie, Im afraid its short notice but I was wondering if youd join me for dinner this evening.Theres something Id like to share with you.Neither spoke.Rosie looked a little stunned.I looked at her directly.Thats a charming pendant, I said.Ill pick you up at seven forty five.I was shaking as I walked away, but I had given it my best effort.Hitch from Hitch would have been pleased with me.I had two more visits to make before my evening date with Rosie.I walked straight past Helena.Gene was in his office looking at his computer.On the screen was a photo of an Asian woman who was not conventionally attractive.I recognized the format: she was a Wife Project applicant.Place of birthNorth Korea.Gene looked at me strangely.My Gregory Peck costume was doubtless unexpected but appropriate for my mission.Hi, Gene.Whats with the Hi?What happened to Greetings?I explained that I had eliminated a number of unconventional mannerisms from my vocabulary.So Claudia tells me.You didnt think your regular mentor was up to the job?I wasnt sure what he meant.He explained.Me.You didnt ask me.This was correct.Feedback from Rosie had prompted me to reassess Genes social competence, and my recent work with Claudia and the movie exemplars had confirmed my suspicion that his skills applied to a limited domain and that he was not employing them in the best interests of himself and his family.No, I told him.I wanted advice on socially appropriate behavior.Whats that supposed to mean?Obviously, youre similar to me.Thats why youre my best friend.Hence this invitation.There had been a great deal of preparation for this day.I gave Gene an envelope.He did not open it but continued the conversation.Im like you?No offense, Don, but your behavioryour old behaviorwas in a class of its own.If you want my opinion, you hid behind a persona that you thought people found amusing.Its hardly surprising people saw you as a ...buffoon.This was exactly my point.But Gene was not making the connection.As his buddy, it was my duty to behave as an adult male and give it to him straight.I walked over to his map of the world, with a pin for every conquest.I checked it for what I hoped would be the last time.Then I stabbed it with my finger, to create an atmosphere of threat.Exactly, I said.You think people see you as a Casanova.You know what?I dont care what other people think of you, but if you want to know, they think youre a jerk.And theyre right, Gene.Youre fifty six years old with a wife and two kids, though for how much longer I dont know.Time you grew up.Im telling you that as a friend.I watched Genes face.I was getting better at reading emotions, but this was a complex one.Shattered, I think.I was relieved.The basic male male tough advice protocol had been effective.It had not been necessary to slug him.thirty two   I went back to my office and changed from my Gregory Peck costume into my new pants and jacket.Then I made a phone call.The receptionist was not prepared to make an appointment for a personal matter, so I booked a fitness evaluation with Phil Jarman, Rosies father in air quotes, for 4:00 p. m.   As I got up to leave, the Dean knocked and walked in.She signaled for me to follow her.It was not part of my plan, but today was an appropriate day to close this phase of my professional life.We went down in the lift and then across the campus to her office, not speaking.It seemed that our conversation needed to take place in a formal setting.I felt uncomfortable, which was a rational response to the almost certain prospect of being dismissed for professional misconduct from a tenured position at a prestigious university.But I had expected this and my feelings came from a different source.The scenario triggered a memory from my first week at a new school, of being sent to the principals office as a result of allegedly inappropriate behavior.The purported misconduct involved a rigorous questioning of our religious education teacher.In retrospect, I understood that she was a well meaning person, but she used her position of power over an eleven year old to cause me considerable distress.The principal was, in fact, reasonably sympathetic but warned me that I needed to show respect.But he was too late: as I walked to his office, I had made the decision that it was pointless to try to fit in.I would be the class clown for the next six years.I have thought about this event often.At the time my decision felt like a rational response based on my assessment of the new environment, but in retrospect I understood that I had been driven by anger at the power structure that suppressed my arguments.Now as I walked to the Deans office, another thought occurred to me.What if my teacher had been a brilliant theologian, equipped with two thousand years of well articulated Christian thinking?She would have had more compelling arguments than an eleven year old.Would I have then been satisfied?I suspect not.As a scientist, with an allegiance to scientific thinking, I would have had a deep seated feeling that I was being, as Rosie would say, bullshitted.Was that how Faith Healer had felt?Had the flounder demonstration been an instance of bullying as heinous as the one committed by my religious education teacher, even though I was right?As we entered the Deans office for what I expected to be the last time, I took notice of her full name on the door, and a minor confusion was resolved.Professor Charlotte Lawrence.I had never thought of her as Charlie, but presumably Simon Lefebvre did.We entered her office and sat down.I see were in our job interview clothes, she said.Im sorry you didnt see fit to grace us with them during your time here.I did not respond.So.No report.No explanation?Again, I could not think of anything appropriate to say.Simon Lefebvre appeared at the door.Obviously this had been planned.The DeanCharliewaved him in.You can save time by explaining to Simon and me together.Lefebvre was carrying the documents that I had given him.At that point, the Deans personal assistant, Regina, who is not objectified by having the words The Beautiful included in her name, entered the room.Sorry to bother you, Professor, she said, ambiguously, as we were all professors, for the next few minutes at least, but the context made it clear she was addressing the Dean.Ive got a problem with your booking at Le Gavroche.They seem to have taken you off the VIP list.The Deans face registered annoyance, but she waved Regina away.Simon Lefebvre smiled at me.You couldve just sent me this, he said, referring to the documents.No need for the theatrical performance.Which I have to concede was beautifully done.As is the proposal.Well need to run it by the ethics guys, but its exactly what were looking for.Genetics and medicine, topics current, well both get publicity.I attempted to analyze the Deans expression.It was beyond my current skill set.So congratulations, Charlie, said Simon.Youve got your joint research project.The Medical Research Institute is prepared to put in four mil, which is more than the budget actually specifies, so youre set to go.I presumed he meant four million dollars.He pointed to me.Hang on to this one, Charlie.Hes a dark horse.And I need him to be part of the project.I got my first real return on my investment in improved social skills.I had worked out what was going on.I did not ask a silly question.I did not put the Dean in a position of untenable embarrassment where she might work against her own interests.I just nodded and walked back to my office.Phil Jarman had blue eyes.I knew this but it was the first thing I noticed.He was in his midfifties, about ten centimeters taller than me, powerfully built, and extremely fit looking.We were standing in front of the reception desk at Jarmans Gym.On the wall were newspaper cuttings and photos of a younger Phil playing football.If I had been a medical student without advanced martial arts skills, I would have thought carefully before having sex with this mans girlfriend.Perhaps this was the simple reason that Phil had never been informed of the identity of Rosies father.Get the prof some gear and get his signature on a waiver form.The woman behind the counter seemed puzzled.Its just an assessment.New procedure starts today, said Phil.I dont require an assessment, I began, but Phil seemed to have fixed ideas.You booked one, he said.Sixty five bucks.Lets get you some boxing gloves.I wondered if he realized that he had called me prof.Presumably Rosie had been right, and he had seen the dancing picture.I had not bothered to disguise my name.But at least I knew that he knew who I was.Did he know that I knew that he knew who I was?I was getting quite good at social subtleties.I changed into a T shirt and shorts, which smelled freshly laundered, and we put on boxing gloves.I had only done the occasional boxing workout, but I was not afraid of getting hurt.I had good defensive techniques if necessary.I was more interested in talking.Lets see you hit me, said Phil.I threw some gentle punches, which Phil blocked.Come on, he said.Try to hurt me.He asked for it.Your stepdaughter is trying to locate her real father because shes dissatisfied with you.Phil dropped his guard.Very poor form.I could have landed a punch unimpeded if we were in a real bout.Stepdaughter?he said.Thats what shes calling herself?Thats why youre here?He threw a hard punch and I had to use a proper block to avoid being hit.He recognized it and tried a hook.I blocked that too and counterpunched.He avoided it nicely.Since its unlikely shell succeed, we need to fix the problem with you.Phil threw a straight hard one at my head.I blocked and stepped away.With me?he said.With Phil Jarman?Who built his own business from nothing, who bench presses a hundred and forty five kilos, who plenty of women still think is a better deal than some doctor or lawyer.Or egghead.He threw a combination and I attacked back.I thought there was a high probability that I could take him down, but I needed to continue the conversation.Its none of your business, but I was on the school council, coached the senior football team  Obviously these achievements were insufficient, I said.Perhaps Rosie requires something in addition to personal excellence.In a moment of clarity, I realized what that something might be in my own case.Was all my work in self improvement in vain?Was I going to end up like Phil, trying to win Rosies love but regarded with contempt?Fighting and contemplation are not compatible.Phils punch took me in the solar plexus.I managed to step back and reduce the force but went down.Phil stood over me, angry.Maybe one day shell know everything.Maybe thatll help, maybe it wont.He shook his head hard, as though he were the one who had taken a punch.Did I ever call myself her stepfather?Ask her that.Ive got no other children, no wife.I did all the thingsI read to her, got up in the night, took her horse riding.After her mother was gone, I couldnt do a thing right.I sat up and shouted.I was angry too.You failed to take her to Disneyland.You lied to her.I scissored his legs, bringing him down.As a result of falling incompetently, he hit the floor hard.We struggled and I pinned him.His nose was bleeding badly and there was blood all over my shirt.Disneyland!said Phil.She was ten!She told everyone at school.Its still a major problem.He tried to break free, but I managed to hold him, despite the impediment of the boxing gloves.You want to know when I told her Id take her to Disneyland?One time.Once.You know when?At her mothers funeral.I was in a wheelchair.I was in rehab for eight months.It was a very reasonable explanation.I wished Rosie had provided this background information prior to my holding her stepfathers head on the floor with blood pouring from his nose.I explained to Phil that at my sisters funeral I made an irrational promise to donate to a hospice when the money would have been better applied to research.He seemed to understand.I bought her a jewelry box.Shed been on her mothers case forever to buy it.I thought shed forgotten about Disneyland when I came out of rehab.Predicting the impact of actions on other people is difficult.Amen to that, said Phil.Can we get up?His nose was still bleeding and was probably broken, so it was a reasonable request.But I was not prepared to let him go yet.Not until we solve the problem.It had been a very full day but the most critical task was still ahead.I examined myself in the mirror.The new glasses, vastly lighter, and the revised hair shape made a bigger difference than the clothes.I put the important envelope in my jacket pocket and the small box in my pants pocket.As I phoned for a taxi, I looked at my whiteboard.The schedule, now written in erasable marker, was a sea of red writingmy code for the Rosie Project.I told myself that the changes it had produced were worthwhile, even if tonight I failed to achieve the final objective.thirty three   The taxi arrived and we made an intermediate stop at the flower shop.I had not been inside this shopor indeed purchased flowers at allsince I stopped visiting Daphne.Daphne for Daphne; obviously the appropriate choice for this evening was roses.The vendor recognized me and I informed her of Daphnes death.After I purchased a dozen long stemmed red roses, consistent with standard romantic behavior, she snipped a small quantity of daphne and inserted it in the buttonhole of my jacket.The smell brought back memories of Daphne.I wished she was alive to meet Rosie.I tried to phone Rosie as the taxi approached her apartment building, but there was no answer.She was not outside when we arrived, and most of the bell buttons did not have names beside them.There was a risk that she had chosen not to accept my invitation.It was cold and I was shaking.I waited a full ten minutes, then called again.There was still no answer and I was about to instruct the driver to leave when she came running out.I reminded myself that it was I who had changed, not Rosie: I should have expected her to be late.She was wearing the black dress that had stunned me on the night of the Jacket Incident.I gave her the roses.I read her expression as surprised.Then she looked at me.You look different ...really different ...again, she said.What happened?I decided to reform myself.I liked the sound of the word: re form.We got in the taxi, Rosie still holding the roses, and traveled the short distance to the restaurant in silence.I was looking for information about her attitude toward me and thought it best to let her speak first.In fact she didnt say anything until she noticed that the taxi was stopping outside Le Gavrochethe scene of the Jacket Incident.Don, is this a joke?I paid the driver, exited the taxi, and opened Rosies door.She stepped out but was reluctant to proceed, clutching the roses to her chest with both hands.I put one hand behind her and guided her toward the door, where the matre d whom we had encountered on our previous visit was standing in his uniform.Jacket Man.He recognized Rosie instantly, as evidenced by his greeting.Rosie.Then he looked at me.Sir?Good evening.I took the flowers from Rosie and gave them to the matre d.  We have a reservation in the name of Tillman.Would you be kind enough to look after these?It was a standard formula but very confidence boosting.Everyone seemed very comfortable now that we were behaving in a predictable manner.The matre d checked the reservation list.I took the opportunity to smooth over any remaining difficulties and made a small prepared joke.My apologies for the misunderstanding last time.There shouldnt be any difficulties tonight.Unless they overchill the white Burgundy.I smiled.A male waiter appeared, the matre d introduced me, briefly complimenting me on my jacket, and we were led into the dining room and to our table.It was all very straightforward.I ordered a bottle of Chablis.Rosie still seemed to be adjusting.The sommelier appeared with the wine.He was looking around the room, as if for support.I diagnosed nervousness.Its at thirteen degrees, but if, sir would like it less chilled ...or more chilled ...That will be fine, thank you.He poured me a taste and I swirled, sniffed, and nodded approval according to the standard protocol.Meanwhile, the waiter who had led us to the table reappeared.He was about forty, BMI approximately twenty two, quite tall.Professor Tillman?he said.My names Nick and Im the headwaiter.If theres anything you need, or anything thats a problem, just ask for me.Much appreciated, Nick.Waiters introducing themselves by name was more in the American tradition than a local custom.Either this restaurant deliberately chose the practice as a point of difference, or we were being given unusually personal treatment.I guessed the latter: I was probably marked as a dangerous person.Good.I would need all the support I could get tonight.Nick handed us menus.Im happy to leave it to the chef, I said.But no meat, and seafood only if its sustainable.Nick smiled.Ill speak to the chef and see what he can do.I realize its a little tricky, but my friend lives by some quite strict rules, I said.Rosie gave me a very strange look.My statement was intended to make a small point, and I think it succeeded.She tried her Chablis and buttered a bread roll.I remained silent.Finally she spoke.All right, Gregory Peck.What are we doing first?The My Fair Lady story or the big revelation?This was good.Rosie was prepared to discuss things directly.In fact, directness had always been one of Rosies positive attributes, though on this occasion she had not identified the most important topic.Im in your hands, I said.Standard polite method for avoiding a choice and empowering the other person.Don, stop it.You know who my father is, right?Its Table Napkin Man, isnt it?Possibly, I said, truthfully.Despite the positive outcome of the meeting with the Dean, I did not have my lab key back.That isnt what I want to share.All right, then.Heres the plan.You share your thing; tell me who my father is; tell me what youve done to yourself; we both go home.I couldnt put a name to her tone of speech and expression, but it was clearly negative.She took another sip of her wine.Sorry.She looked a little apologetic.Go.The sharing thing.I had grave doubts about the likely efficacy of my next move, but there was no contingency plan.I had sourced my speech from When Harry Met Sally.It resonated best with me and with the situation and had the additional advantage of the link to our happy time in New York.I hoped Rosies brain would make that connection, ideally subconsciously.I drank the remainder of my wine.Rosies eyes followed my glass, then she looked up at me.Are you okay, Don?I asked you here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.I studied Rosies expression carefully.I diagnosed stunned.Oh my God, said Rosie, confirming the diagnosis.I followed up while she was still receptive.It seems right now that all Ive ever done in my life is making my way here to you.I could see that Rosie could not place the line from The Bridges of Madison County that had produced such a powerful emotional reaction on the plane.She looked confused.Don, what are you ...what have you done to yourself?Ive made some changes.Big changes.Whatever behavioral modifications you require from me are a trivial price to pay for having you as my partner.Rosie made a downward movement with her hand, which I could not interpret.Then she looked around the room and I followed her eyes.Everyone was watching.Nick had stopped partway to our table.I realized that in my intensity I had raised my voice.I didnt care.You are the worlds most perfect woman.All other women are irrelevant.Permanently.No Botox or implants will be required.I heard someone clapping.It was a slim woman of about sixty sitting with another woman of approximately the same age.Rosie took a drink of her wine, then spoke in a very measured way.Don, I dont know where to start.I dont even know whos asking methe old Don or Billy Crystal.Theres no old and new, I said.Its just behavior.Social conventions.Glasses and haircut.I like you, Don, said Rosie.Okay?Forget what I said about outing my father.Youre probably right.I really really like you.I have fun with you.The best times.But you know I couldnt eat lobster every Tuesday.Right?Ive abandoned the Standardized Meal System.Ive deleted thirty eight percent of my weekly schedule, excluding sleep.Ive thrown out my old T shirts.Ive eliminated all of the things you didnt like.Further changes are possible.You changed yourself for me?Only my behavior.Rosie was silent for a while, obviously processing the new information.I need a minute to think, she said.I automatically started the timer on my watch.Suddenly Rosie started laughing.I looked at her, understandably puzzled at this outburst in the middle of a critical life decision.The watch, she said.I say I need a minute and you start timing.Don is not dead.I waited.I looked at my watch.When there were fifteen seconds left, I assessed that it was likely that she was about to say no.I had nothing to lose.I pulled the small box from my pocket and opened it to reveal the ring I had purchased.I wished I had not learned to read expressions, because I could read Rosies now and I knew the answer.Don, said Rosie.This isnt what you want me to say.But remember on the plane, when you said you were wired differently?I nodded.I knew what the problem was.The fundamental, insurmountable problem of who I was.I had pushed it to the back of my mind since it had surfaced in the fight with Phil.Rosie didnt need to explain.But she did.Thats inside you.You cant fakesorry, start again.You can behave perfectly, but if the feelings not there inside ...God, I feel so unreasonable.The answer is no?I said, some small part of my brain hoping that for once my fallibility in reading social cues would work in my favor.Don, you dont feel love, do you?said Rosie.You cant really love me.Gene diagnosed love.I knew now that he had been wrong.I had watched thirteen romantic movies and felt nothing.That was not strictly true.I had felt suspense, curiosity, and amusement.But I had not for one moment felt engaged in the love between the protagonists.I had cried no tears for Meg Ryan or Meryl Streep or Deborah Kerr or Vivien Leigh or Julia Roberts.I could not lie about so important a matter.According to your definition, no.Rosie looked extremely unhappy.The evening had turned into a disaster.I thought my behavior would make you happy, and instead its made you sad.Im upset because you cant love me.Okay?This was worse!She wanted me to love her.And I was incapable.Don, she said, I dont think we should see each other anymore.I got up from the table and walked back to the entrance foyer, out of sight of Rosie and the other diners.Nick was there, talking to the matre d.  He saw me and came over.Can I help you with anything?Unfortunately, there has been a disaster.Nick looked worried, and I elaborated.A personal disaster.There is no risk to other patrons.Would you prepare the bill, please?We havent served you anything, said Nick.He looked at me closely for a few moments.Theres no charge, sir.The Chablis is on us.He offered me his hand and I shook it.
