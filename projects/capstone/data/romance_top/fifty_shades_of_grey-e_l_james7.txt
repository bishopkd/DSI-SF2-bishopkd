Suddenly, I have an overwhelming urge to bombard him with questions.What this man must know about Christian, all his secrets.But then hes probably signed an NDA.I look nervously at him.He has the same taciturn expression as Ray, and I warm to him.Hes a good man, Miss Steele, he says, and he smiles slightly.With that, he gives me a little nod, climbs into my car, and drives away.Apartment, Beetle, Claytons  its all change now.I shake my head as I wander back inside.And the biggest change of all is Christian Grey.Taylor thinks hes a good man.Can I believe him?Jos joins us with a Chinese take out at eight.Were done.Were packed and ready to go.He brings several bottles of beer, and Kate and I sit on the couch while hes cross legged on the floor between us.We watch crap TV, drink beer, and as the evening wears on, we fondly and loudly reminisce as the beer takes effect.Its been a good four years.The atmosphere between Jos and I has returned to normal, the attempted kiss forgotten.Well, its been swept under the rug that my inner goddess is lying on, eating grapes and tapping her fingers, waiting not so patiently for Sunday.Theres a knock on the door, and my heart leaps into my throat.Is it?Kate answers the door and is nearly knocked off her feet by Elliot.He seizes her in a Hollywood style clinch that moves quickly into a European art house embrace.Honestly  get a room.Jos and I stare at each other.Im appalled at their lack of modesty.Shall we walk down to the bar?I ask Jos, who nods frantically.We are too uncomfortable with the unrestrained sexing unfolding in front of us.Kate looks up at me, flushed and bright eyed.Jos and I are going for a quick drink.I roll my eyes at her.Ha!I can still roll my eyes in my own time.Okay, she grins.Hi Elliot, bye Elliot.He winks a big blue eye at me, and Jos and I are out of the door, giggling like teenagers.As we stroll down to the bar, I put my arm through Joss.God, hes so uncomplicated    I hadnt really appreciated that before.Youll still come to the opening of my show, wont you?Of course, Jos, when is it?June 9.What day is that?I suddenly panic.Its a Thursday.Yeah I should make that and you will visit us in Seattle?Try and stop me.He grins.Its late when I arrive back from the bar.Kate and Elliot are nowhere to be seen but boy can they be heard.Holy shit.I hope Im not that loud.I know Christian isnt.I flush at the thought and escape to my room.After a brief not at all awkward thank goodness hug, Jos has gone.I dont know when Ill see him again, probably his photographic show, and once again, Im blown away that he finally has an exhibition.I shall miss him and his boy ish charm.I couldnt bring myself to tell him about the Beetle, I know hell freak when he finds out, and I can only deal with one man at a time freaking out at me.Once in my room, I check the mean machine, and of course, theres an email from Christian.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Where Are You?Date: May 27 2011 22:14  To: Anastasia Steele  I am at work.I will email you when I get home.Are you still at work or have you packed your phone, BlackBerry and MacBook?Call me, or I may be forced to call Elliot.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Crap Jos shit.I grab my phone.Five missed calls and one voice message.Tentatively, I listen to the message.Its Christian.I think you need to learn to manage my expectations.I am not a patient man.If you say you are going to contact me when you finish work, then you should have the decency to do so.Otherwise, I worry, and its not an emotion Im familiar with, and I dont tolerate it very well.Call me.Double crap.Will he ever give me a break?I scowl at the phone.He is suffocating me.With a deep dread uncurling in my stomach, I scroll down to his number and press dial.My heart is in my mouth as I wait for him to answer.Hed probably like to beat seven shades of shit out of me .The thought is depressing.Hi, he says softly, and his response knocks me off balance because I am expecting his anger, but if anything, he sounds relieved.Hi, I murmur.I was worried about you.I know.Im sorry I didnt reply, but Im fine.He pauses for a beat.Did you have a pleasant evening?He is crisply polite.Yes.We finished packing and Kate and I shared a Chinese take out with Jos.I close my eyes tightly as I say Joss name.Christian says nothing.How about you?I ask to fill the sudden deafening chasm of silence.I will not let him guilt me out about Jos.Eventually, he sighs.I went to a fundraising dinner.It was deathly dull.I left as soon as I could.He sounds so sad and resigned.My heart clenches.I picture him all those nights ago sat at the piano in his huge living room and the unbearable bittersweet melancholy of the music he was playing.I wish you were here, I whisper, because I have an urge to hold him.Soothe him.Even though he wont let me.I want his proximity.Do you?he murmurs blandly.Holy mackerel.This doesnt sound like him, and my scalp prickles with dawning apprehension.Yes, I breathe.After an eternity, he sighs.Ill see you Sunday?Yes, Sunday, I murmur, and a thrill courses through my body.Goodnight.Goodnight, Sir.My address catches him unawares, I can tell by his sharp intake of breath.Good luck with your move tomorrow, Anastasia.His voice is soft.And were both hanging on the phone like teenagers, neither wanting to hang up.You hang up, I whisper.Finally, I sense his smile.No, you hang up.And I know hes grinning.I dont want to.Neither do I.   Were you very angry with me?Yes.Are you still?No.So youre not going to punish me?No.Im an in the moment kind of guy.Ive noticed.You can hang up now, Miss Steele.Do you really want me to, Sir?Go to bed, Anastasia.Yes, Sir.We both stay on the line.Do you ever think youll be able to do what youre told?Hes amused and exasperated at once.Maybe.Well see after Sunday.And I press end on the phone.Elliot stands and admires his handiwork.He has re plugged our TV into the satellite system in our Pike Place Market apartment.Kate and I flop on to the couch giggling, impressed by his prowess with a power drill.The flat screen looks odd against the brickwork of the converted warehouse, but no doubt I will get used to it.See, baby, easy.He grins a wide white toothed smile at Kate, and she almost literally dissolves into the couch.I roll my eyes at the pair of them.Id love to stay, baby, but my sister is back from Paris.Its a compulsory family dinner tonight.Can you come by after?Kate asks tentatively, all soft and un Katelike.I stand and make my way over to the kitchen area on the pretense of unpacking one of the crates.They are going to get icky.Ill see if I can escape, he promises.Ill come down with you.Kate smiles.Laters, Ana.Elliot grins.Bye, Elliot.Say hi to Christian from me.Just hi?His eyebrows shoot up suggestively.Yes.I flush.He winks at me, and I go crimson as he follows Kate out of the apartment.Elliot is adorable and so different from Christian.Hes warm, open, physical, very physical, too physical, with Kate.They can barely keep their hands off each other  to be honest its embarrassing   and I am pea green with envy.Kate returns about twenty minutes later with pizza, and we sit, surrounded by crates, in our new open space, eating straight from the box.Kates dad has done us proud.The apartment is not large, but its big enough, three bedrooms and a large living space that looks out on to Pike Place Market itself.Its all solid wood floors and red brick, and the kitchen tops are smooth concrete, very utilitarian, very now.We both love that we will be in the heart of the city.At eight the entry phone buzzes.Kate leaps up   and my heart leaps into my mouth.Delivery, Miss Steele, Miss Kavanagh.Disappointment flows freely and unexpectedly through my veins.Its not Christian.Second floor, apartment two.Kate buzzes the delivery boy in.His mouth falls open when he sees Kate, all tight jeans, t shirt, hair piled high with escaping tendrils.She has that effect on men.He holds a bottle of champagne with a helicopter shaped balloon attached.She gives him a dazzling smile to send him on his way and proceeds to read the card out to me.Ladies, Good luck in your new home, Christian Grey.Kate shakes her head in disapproval.Why cant he just write from Christian?And whats with the weird helicopter balloon?Charlie Tango.What?Christian flew me to Seattle in his helicopter.I shrug.Kate stares at me open mouthed.I have to say  I love these occasions  Katherine Kavanagh, silent and floored, they are so rare.I take a brief and luxurious moment to enjoy it.Yep, he has a helicopter, which he flew himself, I state proudly.Of course the obscenely rich bastard has a helicopter.Why didnt you tell me?Kate looks accusingly at me, but shes smiling, shaking her head in disbelief.Ive had a lot on my mind lately.She frowns.Are you going to be okay while Im away?Of course.I answer reassuringly.New city, no job nut job boyfriend.Did you give him our address?No, but stalking is one of his specialties.I muse, matter of fact.Kates brow knits further.Somehow Im not surprised.He worries me, Ana.At least its a good champagne and its chilled.Of course, only Christian would send chilled champagne or get his secretary to do it  or maybe Taylor.We open it there and then and find our teacups   they were the last items to be packed.Bollinger Grande Anne Ros 1999, an excellent vintage.I grin at Kate, and we clink teacups.I wake early to a gray Sunday morning after a surprisingly refreshing nights sleep and lie awake staring at my crates.You should really be unpacking these, my subconscious nags, pursing her harpy lips together.No todays the day.My inner goddess is beside herself, hopping from foot to foot.Anticipation hangs heavy and portentous over my head like a dark tropical storm cloud.Butterflies flood my belly  as well as a darker, carnal, captivating ache as I try to imagine what he will do to me and of course, I have to sign that damned contract or do I?I hear the ping of incoming mail from the mean machine on the floor beside my bed.From: Christian Grey  Subject: My Life in Numbers  Date: May 29 2011 08:04  To: Anastasia Steele      If you drive youll need this access code for the underground garage at Escala: 146963  Park in bay 5  its one of mine.Code for the elevator: 1880  Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: An excellent Vintage  Date: May 29 2011 08:08  To: Christian Grey  Yes Sir.Understood.Thank you for the champagne and the blow up Charlie Tango, which is now tied to my bed.Ana  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Envy  Date: May 29 2011 08:11  To: Anastasia Steele  Youre welcome.Dont be late.Lucky Charlie Tango.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.I roll my eyes at his bossiness, but his last line makes me smile.I head for the bathroom, wondering if Elliot made it back last night and trying hard to rein in my nerves.I can drive the Audi in high heels!At 12:55 p. m.  precisely, I pull into the garage at Escala and park in bay five.How many bays does he own?The Audi SUV is there, the R8, and two smaller Audi SUVs hmm.I check my seldom worn mascara in the light up vanity mirror on my sunshield.Didnt have one of these in the Beetle.Go girl!My inner goddess has her pom poms in hand   shes in cheerleading mode.In the infinity mirrors of the elevator, I check out my plum dress, well  Kates plum dress.The last time I wore this, he wanted to peel it off me.My body clenches at the thought.Oh my, the feeling is just exquisite, and I catch my breath.Im wearing the underwear that Taylor bought for me.I flush at the thought of his buzz cut roaming the aisles of Agent Provocateur or wherever he bought it.The doors open, and Im facing the foyer of apartment number one.Taylor stands at the double doors as I step out of the elevator.Good afternoon, Miss Steele, he says.Oh please call me, Ana.Ana, he smiles.Mr.Grey is expecting you.I bet he is.Christian is seated on his living room couch reading the Sunday papers.He glances up as Taylor directs me into the living area.The room is exactly as I remember it  its been a whole week since Ive been here  but it feels so much longer.Christian looks cool and calm  actually, he looks heavenly.Hes in a loose white linen shirt and jeans, no shoes or socks.His hair is tousled and unkempt, and his gray eyes twinkle wickedly at me.He is jaw droppingly handsome.He rises and strolls towards me, an amused appraising smile on his beautiful sculptured lips.I stand immobilized at the entrance of the room, paralyzed by his beauty and the sweet anticipation of whats to come.The familiar charge between us is there, sparking slowly in my belly, drawing me to him.Hmm that dress, he murmurs approvingly as he gazes down at me.Welcome back, Miss Steele, he whispers, and clasping my chin, he leans down and proffers a gentle light kiss on my lips.The touch of his lips to mine reverberates throughout my body.My breath hitches.Hi, I whisper as I flush.Youre on time.I like punctual.Come.He takes my hand and leads me to the couch.I wanted to show you something, he says as we sit.He hands me the Seattle Times.On page eight, theres a photograph of the two of us together at the graduation ceremony.Holy crap.Im in the paper.I check the caption.Christian Grey and friend at the graduation ceremony at WSU Vancouver.I laugh.So Im your friend now.So it would appear.And its in the newspaper, so it must be true.He smirks.Sitting beside me, his whole body is turned toward me, one of his legs tucked under the other.Reaching over, he tucks my hair behind my ear with his long index finger.My body comes alive at his touch, waiting and needful.So, Anastasia, you have a much better idea of what Im about since you were last here.Yes.Wheres he going with this?And yet youve returned.I nod shyly, and his gray eyes blaze.He shakes his head slightly as if hes struggling with the idea.Have you eaten?he asks out of the blue.Shit.No.Are you hungry?Hes really trying not to look annoyed.Not for food, I whisper, and his nostrils flare slightly in reaction.He leans forward and whispers in my ear.You are as eager as ever, Miss Steele, and just to let you into a little secret, so am I.   But Dr.Greene is due here shortly.He sits up.I wish youd eat, he scolds me mildly.My heated blood cools.Holy cow  the doctor.Id forgotten.What can you tell me about Dr.Greene?I ask to distract us both.Shes the best Ob/Gyn in Seattle.What more can I say?He shrugs.I thought I was seeing your doctor, and dont tell me youre really a woman, because I wont believe you.He gives me a dont be ridiculous look.I think its more appropriate that you see a specialist.Dont you?he says mildly.I nod.Holy Moses, if shes the best Ob/Gyn, hes scheduled her to see me on a Sunday   at lunchtime!I cannot begin to imagine how much that costs.Christian frowns suddenly as if recalling something unpleasant.Anastasia, my mother would like you to come to dinner this evening.I believe Elliot is asking Kate too.I dont know how you feel about that.It will be odd for me to introduce you to my family.Odd?Why?Are you ashamed of me?I cant keep the wounded hurt out of my voice.Of course not.He rolls his eyes at me.Why is it odd?Because Ive never done it before.Why are you allowed to roll your eyes, and Im not?He blinks at me.I wasnt aware that I was.Neither am I usually, I snap at him.Christian glares at me, speechless.Taylor appears at the doorway.Dr.Greene is here, Sir.Show her up to Miss Steeles room.Miss Steeles room!Ready for some contraception?he asks as he stands and holds out his hand to me.Youre not going to come as well are you?I gasp, shocked.He laughs.Id pay very good money to watch, believe me, Anastasia, but I dont think the good doctor would approve.I take his hand, and he pulls me up into his arms and kisses me deeply.I clutch on to his arms, taken by surprise.His hand is in my hair holding my head, and he pulls me against him, his forehead against mine.Im so glad youre here, he whispers.I cant wait to get you naked.Dr.Greene is tall, blond, and immaculate, dressed in a royal blue suit.Im reminded of the women who work in Christians office.Shes like an identikit model  another Stepford blonde.Her long hair is swept up in an elegant chignon.She must be in her early forties.Mr.Grey.She shakes Christians outstretched hand.Thank you for coming at such short notice, Christian says.Thank you for making it worth my while, Mr.Grey.Miss Steele.She smiles, her eyes cool and assessing.We shake hands, and I know shes one of those women who doesnt tolerate fools gladly.Like Kate.I like her immediately.She gives Christian a pointed stare, and after an awkward beat, he takes his cue.Ill be downstairs, he mutters, and he leaves what will be my bedroom.Well Miss Steele.Mr.Grey is paying me a small fortune to attend to you.What can I do for you?After a thorough examination and lengthy discussion, Dr.Greene and I decide on the mini pill.She writes me a pre paid prescription and instructs me to pick them up tomorrow.I love her no nonsense attitude  she has lectured me until shes as blue as her dress about taking it at the same time every day.And I can tell shes burning with curiosity about my so called relationship with Mr.Grey.I dont give her any details.Somehow I dont think shed look so calm and collected if shed seen his Red Room of Pain.I flush as we pass its closed door and head back downstairs to the art gallery that is Christians living room.Christian is reading, seated on his couch.A breathtaking aria is playing on the music system, swirling round him, cocooning him, filling the room with a sweet, soulful song.For a moment, he looks serene.He turns and glances at us when we enter and smiles warmly at me.Are you done?he asks as if hes genuinely interested.He points the remote at a sleek white box beneath the fireplace that houses his iPod, and the exquisite melody fades but continues in the background.Standing, he strolls towards us.Yes, Mr.Grey.Look after her; shes a beautiful, bright young woman.Christian is taken aback  as am I.  What an inappropriate thing for a doctor to say.Is she giving him some kind of not so subtle warning?Christian recovers himself.I fully intend to, he mutters, bemused.Gazing at him, I shrug, embarrassed.Ill send you my bill, she says crisply as she shakes his hand.Good day, and good luck to you, Ana.She smiles, her eyes crinkling as she does when we shake hands.Taylor appears from nowhere to escort her through the double doors and out to the elevator.How does he do that?Where does he lurk?How was that?Christian asks.Fine, thank you.She said that I had to abstain from all sexual activity for the next four weeks.Christians mouth drops open in shock, and I cannot keep a straight face any longer and grin at him like an idiot.Gotcha!He narrows his eyes, and I immediately stop laughing.In fact, he looks rather forbidding.Oh shit.My subconscious quails in the corner as all the blood drains from my face, and I imagine him putting me across his knee again.Gotcha!he says and smirks.He grabs me around my waist and pulls me up against him.You are incorrigible, Miss Steele, he murmurs, staring down into my eyes as he weaves his fingers into my hair, holding me firmly in place.He kisses me, hard, and I cling on to his muscular arms for support.As much as Id like to take you here, now, you need to eat and so do I.  I dont want you passing out on me later, he murmurs against my lips.Is that all you want me for  my body?I whisper.That and your smart mouth, he breathes.He kisses me again passionately, and then abruptly releases me, taking my hand and leading me to the kitchen.I am reeling.One minute were joking and the next I fan my heated face.Hes just sex on legs, and now I have to recover my equilibrium and eat something.The aria is still playing in the background.Whats the music?Villa Lobos, an aria from Bachianas Brasileiras.Good, isnt it?Yes, I murmur in total agreement.The breakfast bar is laid for two; Christian takes a salad bowl from the fridge.Chicken caesar salad okay with you?Oh thank heavens, nothing too heavy.Yes, fine, thank you.I watch as he moves gracefully through his kitchen.Hes so at ease with his body on one level, but then he doesnt like to be touched so maybe deep down he isnt.No man is an island, I muse  except perhaps Christian Grey.What are you thinking?he asks, pulling me from my reverie.I flush.I was just watching the way you move.He raises an eyebrow, amused.And?he says dryly.I flush some more.Youre very graceful.Why thank you, Miss Steele, he murmurs.He sits down beside me, holding a bottle of wine.Chablis?Please.Help yourself to salad, he says, his voice soft.Tell me   what method did you opt for?I am momentarily thrown by his question, when I realize hes talking about Dr.Greenes visit.Mini pill.He frowns.And will you remember to take it regularly, at the right time, every day?Jeez of course I will.How does he know?I blush at the thought, probably from one or more of the fifteen.Im sure youll remind me, I murmur dryly.He glances at me with amused condescension.Ill put an alarm on my calendar.He smirks.Eat.The chicken caesar is delicious.To my surprise, Im famished, and for the first time since Ive been with him, I finish my meal before he does.The wine is crisp, clean, and fruity.Eager as ever, Miss Steele?he smiles down at my empty plate.I look at him from beneath my lashes.Yes, I whisper.His breath hitches.And as he stares down at me, I feel the atmosphere between us slowly shift, evolve charge.His look goes from dark to smoldering, taking me with him.He stands, closing the distance between us, and tugs me off my bar stool into his arms.Do you want to do this?he breathes, looking down at me intently.I havent signed anything.I know  but Im breaking all the rules these days.Are you going to hit me?Yes, but it wont be to hurt you.I dont want to punish you right now.If youd caught me yesterday evening, well, that would have been a different story.Holy cow.He wants to hurt me how do I deal with this?I cant hide the horror on my face.Dont let anyone try and convince you otherwise, Anastasia.One of the reasons people like me do this is because we either like to give or receive pain.Its very simple.You dont, so I spent a great deal of time yesterday thinking about that.He pulls me against him, and his erection presses into my belly.I should run, but I cant.Im drawn to him on some deep, elemental level, that I cant begin to understand.Did you reach any conclusions?I whisper.No, and right now, I just want to tie you up and fuck you senseless.Are you ready for that?Yes, I breathe as everything in my body tightens at once wow.Good.Come.He takes my hand and, leaving all the dirty dishes on the breakfast bar, and we head upstairs.My heart starts pounding.This is it.Im really going to do this.My inner goddess is spinning like a world class ballerina, pirouette after pirouette.He opens the door to his playroom, standing back for me to walk through, and I am once more in the Red Room of Pain.Its the same, the smell of leather, citrus, polish and dark wood, all very sensual.My blood is running heated and scared through my system  adrenaline mixed with lust and longing.Its a heady, potent cocktail.Christians stance has changed completely, subtly altered, harder and meaner.He gazes down at me and his eyes are heated, lustful hypnotic.When youre in here, you are completely mine, he breathes, each word slow and measured.To do with as I see fit.Do you understand?His gaze is so intense.I nod, my mouth dry, my heart thumping for a way out of my chest.Take your shoes off, he orders softly.I swallow, and rather clumsily, I take them off.He bends and picks them up and deposits them beside the door.Good.Dont hesitate when I ask you to do something.Now Im going to peel you out of this dress.Something Ive wanted to do for a few days if I recall.I want you to be comfortable with your body, Anastasia.You have a beautiful body, and I like to look at it.It is a joy to behold.In fact, I could gaze at you all day, and I want you unembarrassed and unashamed of your nakedness.Do you understand?Yes.Yes, what?He leans over me, glaring.Yes, Sir.Do you mean that?he snaps.Yes, Sir.Good.Lift your arms up over your head.I do as instructed, and he reaches down and grabs the hem.Slowly, he pulls my dress up over my thighs, my hips, my belly, my breasts, my shoulders, and over my head.He stands back to examine me and absentmindedly folds my dress, not taking his eyes off me.He places it on the large chest beside the door.Reaching up, he pulls at my chin, his touch searing me.Youre biting your lip, he breathes.You know what that does to me, he adds darkly.Turn around.I turn immediately, no hesitation.He unclasps my bra and then taking both straps, he slowly pulls them down my arms, brushing my skin with his fingers and the tip of his thumbnails as he slides my bra off.His touch sends shivers down my spine, waking every nerve ending in my body.Hes standing behind me, so close that I feel the heat radiating from him, warming me, warming me all over.He pulls my hair so its all hanging down my back, grasps a handful at my nape, and angles my head to one side.He runs his nose down my exposed neck, inhaling all the way, then back up to my ear.The muscles in my belly clench, carnal and wanting.Jeez, hes hardly touched me, and I want him.You smell as divine as ever, Anastasia, he whispers as he places a soft kiss beneath my ear.I moan.Quiet, he breathes.Dont make a sound.Pulling my hair behind me, to my surprise, he starts braiding it in one large braid, his fingers fast and deft.He ties it with an unseen hair tie when hes finished and gives it a quick tug so Im forced back against him.I like your hair braided in here, he whispers.Hmm why?He releases my hair.Turn around, he orders.I do as Im bid, my breathing shallow, fear and longing mixed together.Its an intoxicating mix.When I tell you to come in here, this is how you will dress.Just in your panties.Do you understand?Yes.Yes, what?He glowers at me.Yes, Sir.A trace of a smile lifts the corner of his mouth.Good girl.His eyes burn into mine.When I tell you to come in here, I expect you to kneel over there.He points to a spot beside the door.Do it now.I blink processing his words, turn, and rather clumsily kneel as directed.You can sit back on your heels.I sit back.Place your hands and forearms flat on your thighs.Good.Now part your knees.Wider.Wider.Perfect.Look down at the floor.He walks over to me, and I can see his feet and shins in my field of vision.Naked feet.I should be taking notes if he wants me to remember.He reaches down and grasps my braid again, then pulls my head back so I am looking up at him.Its only just not painful.Will you remember this position, Anastasia?Yes, Sir.Good.Stay here, dont move.He leaves the room.Im on my knees, waiting.Wheres he gone?What is he going to do to me?Time shifts.I have no idea how long he leaves me like this a few minutes, five, ten?My breathing becomes shallower, the anticipation is devouring me from the inside out.And suddenly hes back  and all at once Im calmer and more excited in the same breath.Could I be more excited?I can see his feet.Hes changed his jeans.These are older, ripped, soft, and over washed.Holy cow.These jeans are hot.He shuts the door and hangs something on the back.Good girl, Anastasia.You look lovely like that.Well done.Stand up.I stand, but I keep my face down.You may look at me.I peek up at him, and hes staring at me intently, assessing, but his eyes soften.Hes taken off his shirt.Oh my I want to touch him.The top button of his jeans is undone.Im going to chain you now, Anastasia.Give me your right hand.I give him my hand.He turns it palm up, and before I know it, he swats the center with a riding crop I hadnt noticed is in his right hand.It happens so quickly that the surprise hardly registers.Even more astonishing  it doesnt hurt.Well, not much, just a slight ringing sting.How does that feel?he asks.I blink at him, confused.Answer me.Okay.I frown.Dont frown.I blink and try for impassive.I succeed.Did that hurt?No.This is not going to hurt.Do you understand?Yes.My voice is uncertain.Is it really not going to hurt?I mean it, he says.Jeez, my breathing is so shallow.Does he know what Im thinking?He shows me the crop.Its brown plaited leather.My eyes jerk up to meet his, and theyre alight with fire and a trace of amusement.We aim to please, Miss Steele, he murmurs.Come.He takes my elbow and moves me to beneath the grid.He reaches up and takes down some shackles with black leather cuffs.This grid is designed so the shackles move across the grid.I glance up.Holy shit  its like a subway map.Were going to start here, but I want to fuck you standing up.So well end up by the wall over there.He points with the riding crop to where the large wooden X is on the wall.Put your hands above your head.I oblige immediately, feeling like Im exiting my body  a casual observer of events as they unfold around me.This is beyond fascinating, beyond erotic.Its singularly the most exciting and scary thing Ive ever done.Im entrusting myself to a beautiful man who, by his own admission, is fifty shades of fucked up.I suppress the brief thrill of fear.Kate and Elliot, they know Im here.He stands very close as he fastens the cuffs.Im staring at his chest.His proximity is heavenly.He smells of body wash and Christian, an inebriating mix, and that drags me back into the now.I want to run my nose and tongue through that smattering of chest hair.I could just lean forward  He steps back and gazes at me, his expression hooded, salacious, carnal, and I am helpless, my hands tied, but just looking at his lovely face, reading his need and longing for me, I can feel the dampness between my legs.He walks slowly round me.You look mighty fine trussed up like this, Miss Steele.And your smart mouth, quiet for now.I like that.Standing in front of me again, he hooks his fingers into my panties, and at a most unhurried pace, peels them down my legs, stripping me agonizingly slowly, so that he ends up kneeling in front of me.Not taking his eyes off mine, he scrunches my panties in his hand, holds them up to his nose, and inhales deeply.Holy fuck.Did he just do that?He grins wickedly at me and tucks them into the pocket of his jeans.Uncoiling from the floor, rising lazily, like a jungle cat, he points the end of the riding crop at my navel, leisurely circling it  tantalizing me.At the touch of the leather, I quiver and gasp.He walks round me again, trailing the crop around the middle of my body.On his second circuit, he suddenly flicks the crop, and it hits me underneath my behind against my sex.I cry out in surprise as all my nerve endings stand to attention.I pull against the restraints.The shock runs through me, and its the sweetest strangest, hedonistic feeling.Quiet, he whispers as he walks around me again, the crop slightly higher around the middle of my body.This time when he flicks it against me in the same place, Im anticipat ing it oh my.My body convulses at the sweet, stinging bite.As he makes his way around me, he flicks again, this time hitting my nipple, and I throw my head back as my nerve endings sing.He hits the other a brief, swift, sweet chastisement.My nipples harden and elongate from the assault, and I moan loudly, pulling on my leather cuffs.Does that feel good?he breathes.Yes.He hits me again across the buttocks.The crop stings this time.Yes what?Yes, Sir, I whimper.He comes to a stop but I can no longer see him.My eyes are closed as I try to absorb the myriad of sensations coursing through my body.Very slowly, he rains small, biting licks of the crop down my belly, heading south.I know where this is leading, and I try and psyche myself up for it  but when he hits my clitoris, I cry out loudly.Oh please!I groan.Quiet, he orders, and he hits me again on my behind.I did not expect this to be like this I am lost.Lost in a sea of sensation.And suddenly, hes dragging the crop against my sex, through my pubic hair, down to the entrance of my vagina.See how wet you are for this, Anastasia.Open your eyes and your mouth.I do as Im told, completely seduced.He pushes the tip of the crop into my mouth, like my dream .Holy shit.See how you taste.Suck.Suck hard, baby.My mouth closes around the crop as my eyes lock on his.I can taste the rich leather and the saltiness of my arousal.His eyes are blazing.Hes in his element.He pulls the tip from my mouth, and he stands forward and grabs me and kisses me hard, his tongue invading my mouth.Wrapping his arms around me, he pulls me against him.His chest crushes mine, and I itch to touch, but I cant, my hands, useless above me.Oh, Anastasia, you taste mighty fine, he breathes.Shall I make you come?Please, I beg.The crop bites my buttock.Ow!Please, what?Please, Sir, I whimper.He smiles at me, triumphant.With this?He holds the crop up so I can see it.Yes, Sir.Are you sure?He looks sternly at me.Yes, please, Sir.Close your eyes.I shut the room out, him out the crop out.He starts small, biting licks of the crop against my belly once more.Moving down, soft small licks against my clitoris, once, twice, three times, again and again, until finally, thats it  I can take no more  and I come, gloriously, loudly, sagging weakly.His arms curl around me as my legs turn to jelly.I dissolve in his embrace, my head against his chest, and Im mewling and whimpering as the aftershocks of my orgasm consume me.He lifts me, and suddenly were moving, my arms still tethered above my head, and I can feel the cool wood of the polished cross at my back, and hes popping the buttons on his jeans.He puts me down against the cross briefly while he slides on a condom, and then his hands wrap around my thighs as he lifts me again.Lift your legs, baby, wrap them round me.I feel so weak, but I do as he asks as he wraps my legs around his hips and positions himself beneath me.With one thrust, hes inside me, and I cry out again, listening to his muffled moan at my ear.My arms are resting on his shoulders as he thrusts into me.Jeez, its deep this way.He thrusts again and again, his face at my neck, his harsh breathing at my throat.I feel the build up again.Jeez no not again I dont think my body will with stand another earth shattering moment.But I have no choice and with an inevitability thats becoming familiar, I let go and come again, and its sweet and agonizing and intense.I lose all sense of self.Christian follows, shouting his release through clenched teeth and holding me hard and close as he does.He pulls out of me swiftly and sets me down against the cross, his body supporting mine.Unbuckling the cuffs, he frees my hands, and we both sink to the floor.He pulls me into his lap, cradling me, and I lean my head against his chest.If I had the strength, Id touch him, but I dont.Belatedly, I realize hes still wearing his jeans.Well done, baby, he murmurs.Did that hurt?No, I breathe.I can barely keep my eyes open.Why am I so tired?Did you expect it to?he whispers as he holds me close, his fingers pushing some escaped tendrils of hair off my face.Yes.You see most of your fear is in your head, Anastasia, he pauses.Would you do it again?I think for a moment as fatigue clouds my brain  Again?Yes.My voice is so soft.He hugs me tightly.Good.So would I, he murmurs, then leans down and softly kisses the top of my head.And I havent finished with you yet.Not finished with me yet.Holy Moses.Theres no way I can do any more.I am utterly spent and fighting an overwhelming desire to sleep.Im leaning against his chest, my eyes are closed, and hes wrapped around me  arms and legs  and I feel safe, and oh so comfortable.Will he let me sleep, perchance to dream?My mouth quirks up at the silly thought, and turning my face into Christians chest, I inhale his unique scent and nuzzle him, but immediately he tenses oh crap.I open my eyes and glance up at him.Hes staring down at me.Dont, he breathes in warning.I flush and look back at his chest in longing.I want to run my tongue through the hair, kiss him, and for the first time, I notice he has a few random and faint small, round scars dotted around his chest.Chicken pox?Measles?I think absently.Kneel by the door, he orders as he sits back, putting his hands on his knees, effectively releasing me.No longer warm, the temperature of his voice has dropped several degrees.I stumble clumsily up into a standing position and scoot over to the door and kneel as instructed.Im shaky and very, very tired, monumentally confused.Who would have thought I could have found such gratification in this room.Who could have thought it would be so exhausting?My limbs are deliciously heavy, sated.My inner goddess has a  do not disturb sign on the outside of her room.Christian is moving about in the periphery of my vision.My eyes start to droop.Boring you, am I, Miss Steele?I jump awake, and Christian is standing in front of me, his arms crossed glaring down at me.Oh shit, caught napping  this is not going to be good.His eyes soften as I gaze up at him.Stand up, he orders.I climb warily to my feet.He stares at me, and his mouths quirks up.Youre shattered, arent you?I nod shyly, flushing.Stamina, Miss Steele.He narrows his eyes at me.I havent had my fill of you yet.Hold out your hands in front as if youre praying.I blink at him.Praying!Praying for you to go easy on me.I do as Im told.He takes a cable tie and fastens it around my wrists, tightening the plastic.Holy hell.My eyes fly to his.Look familiar, he asks, unable to conceal his smile.Jeez the plastic cable ties.Restocking at Claytons!It all becomes clear.I gape up at him as adrenaline spikes though my body anew.Okay  thats got my attention  Im awake now.I have scissors here.He holds them up for me to see.I can cut you out of this in a moment.I try to pull my wrists apart, testing my bonds, and as I do, the plastic bites into my flesh  its sore, but if I relax my wrists theyre fine  the tie is not cutting into my skin.Come.He takes my hands and leads me over to the four poster bed.I notice now that it has dark red sheets on it and a shackle at each corner.I want more  much, much more, he leans down and whispers in my ear.And my heartbeat starts pounding again.Oh boy.But Ill make this quick.Youre tired.Hold on to the post, he says.I frown.Not on the bed then?I find I can part my hands as I grasp the ornately carved wooden post.Lower, he orders.Good.Dont let go.If you do, Ill spank you.Understand?Yes, Sir.Good.He stands behind me and grasps my hips, and then quickly lifts me backward so Im bending forward, holding the post.Dont let go, Anastasia, he warns.Im going to fuck you hard from behind.Hold the post to support your weight.Understand?Yes.He smacks me across my behind with his hand.Ow It stings.Yes, Sir, I mutter quickly.Part your legs.He puts his leg between mine, and holding my hips, he pushes my right leg to the side.Thats better.After this, Ill let you sleep.Sleep?Im panting.Im not thinking of sleep now.He reaches up and gently strokes my back.You have such beautiful skin, Anastasia, he breathes as he bends down and kisses me along my spine, gentle feather light kisses.At the same time, his hands move round to my front palming my breasts, and as he does this, he traps my nipples between his fingers and tugs them gently.I stifle my moan as I feel my whole body respond, coming alive once more for him.He gently bites and sucks me at my waist, tugging my nipples, and my hands tighten on the exquisitely carved post.His hands drop away, and I hear the now familiar tear of foil, and he kicks off his jeans.You have such a captivating, sexy ass, Anastasia Steele.What Id like to do to it.His hands smooth and shape each of my buttocks, then his fingers glide down, and he slips two fingers inside me.So wet.You never disappoint, Miss Steele, he whispers, and I hear the wonder in his voice.Hold tight this is going to be quick, baby.He grabs my hips and positions himself, and I brace myself for his assault.But he reaches over me and grabs my braid near the end and winds it round his wrist to my nape holding my head in place.Very slowly he eases into me, pulling my hair at the same time oh the fullness.He eases out of me slowly, and his other hand grabs my hip, holding tight, and then he slams into me, jolting me forward.Hold on, Anastasia!he shouts through clenched teeth.I grip harder round the post and push back against him as he continues his merciless onslaught, again and again, his fingers digging into my hip.My arms are aching, my legs feel uncertain, my scalp is getting sore from his tugging my hair and I can feel a gathering deep inside me.Oh no and for the first time, I fear my orgasm if I come  Ill collapse.Christian continues to move roughly against me, in me, his breathing harsh, moaning, groaning.My body is responding  how?I feel a quickening.But suddenly, Christian stills, slamming really deep.Come on, Ana, give it to me, he groans, and my name on his lips sends me over the edge as I become all body and spiraling sensation and sweet, sweet release, and then completely and utterly mindless.When sense returns, Im lying on him.Hes on the floor, and Im lying on top of him, my back to his front, and Im staring at the ceiling, all post coital, glowing, shattered.Oh  the karabiners, I think absently  Id forgotten about those.Christian nuzzles my ear.Hold up your hands, he says softly.My arms feel like theyre made of lead, but I hold them up.He wields the scissors and passes one blade under the plastic.I declare this Ana open, he breathes, and cuts the plastic.I giggle and rub my wrists as theyre freed.I feel his grin.That is such a lovely sound, he says wistfully.He sits suddenly, taking me with him so that Im once more sitting in his lap.Thats my fault, he says and shifts me so that he can rub my shoulders and arms.Gently he massages some life back into my limbs  What?I glance up at him behind me, trying to understand what he means.That you dont giggle more often.Im not a great giggler, I mumble sleepily.Oh, but when it happens, Miss Steele, tis a wonder and joy to behold.Very flowery, Mr.Grey, I mutter, trying to keep my eyes open.His eyes soften, and he smiles.Id say youre thoroughly fucked and in need of sleep.That wasnt flowery at all, I grumble playfully.He grins and gently lifts me off him and stands, gloriously naked.I wish momentarily that I were more awake to really appreciate him.Picking up his jeans, he slides them back on, commando.Dont want to frighten Taylor, or Mrs.Jones for that matter, he mutters.Hmm they must know what a kinky bastard he is.The thought preoccupies me.He stoops to help me to my feet and leads me to the door, on the back of which hangs a grey waffle robe.He patiently dresses me as if Im a small child.I dont have the strength to lift my arms.When Im covered and respectable, he leans down and kisses me gently, his mouth quirks up in a smile.Bed, he says.Oh no  For sleep, he adds reassuringly when he sees my expression.Suddenly, he scoops me up and carries me curled against his chest to the room along the corridor where earlier today Dr.Greene examined me.My head drops against his chest.I am exhausted.I dont remember ever being this tired.Pulling back the duvet, he lays me down, and even more surprisingly, climbs in beside me and holds me close.Sleep now, gorgeous girl, he whispers, and he kisses my hair.And before I can make a facetious comment, Im asleep.Soft lips brush across my temple, leaving sweet tender kisses in their wake, and part of me wants to turn and respond, but mostly I want to stay asleep.I moan and burrow into my pillow.Anastasia, wake up.Christians voice is soft, cajoling.No, I moan.We have to leave in half an hour for dinner at my parents.Hes amused.I open my eyes reluctantly.Its dusk outside.Christian is leaning over, gazing at me intently.Come on sleepy head.Get up.He stoops down and kisses me again.Ive bought you a drink.Ill be downstairs.Dont go back to sleep, or youll be in trouble, he threatens, but his tone is mild.He kisses me briefly and exits, leaving me blinking sleep from my eyes in the cool, stark room.Im refreshed but suddenly nervous.Holy cow, I am meeting his folks!Hes just worked me over with a riding crop and tied me up using a cable tie which I sold him, for heavens sake  and Im going to meet his parents.It will be Kates first time meeting them too  at least shell be there for support.I roll my shoulders.Theyre stiff.His demands for a personal trainer dont seem so outlandish now, in fact, theyre mandatory if I am to have any hope of keeping up with him.I climb slowly out of bed and note that my dress is hanging outside the wardrobe and my bra is on the chair.Where are my panties?I check beneath the chair.Nothing.Then I remember  he squirreled them away in the pocket of his jeans.I flush at the memory, after he, I cant even bring myself to think about it, he was so  barbarous.I frown.Why hasnt he given me back my panties?I steal into the bathroom, bewildered by my lack of underwear.While drying myself after my enjoyable but far too brief shower, I realize hes done this on purpose.He wants me to be embarrassed and ask for my panties back, and hell either say yes or no.My inner goddess grins at me.Hell two can play that particular game.Resolving there and then not to ask him for them and not give him that satisfaction, I shall go meet his parents sans culottes.Anastasia Steele!My subconscious chides me, but I dont want to listen to her  I almost hug myself with glee because I know this will drive him crazy.Back in the bedroom, I put on my bra, slip into my dress, and climb into my shoes.I remove the braid and hastily brush out my hair, I then glance down at the drink hes left.Its pale pink.Whats this?Cranberry and sparkling water.Hmm it tastes delicious and quenches my thirst.Dashing back into the bathroom, I check myself in the mirror: eyes bright, cheeks slightly flushed, slightly smug look because of my panty plan, and I head downstairs.Fifteen minutes.Not bad, Ana.Christian is standing by the panoramic window, wearing the grey flannel pants that I love, the ones that hang in that unbelievably sexy way off his hips, and of course, a white linen shirt.Doesnt he have any other colors?Frank Sinatra sings softly over the surround sound speakers.Christian turns and smiles as I enter.He looks at me expectantly.Hi, I say softly, and my sphinx like smile meets his.Hi, he says.How are you feeling?His eyes are alight with amusement.Good, thanks.You?I feel mighty fine, Miss Steele.He is so waiting for me to say something.Frank.I never figured you for a Sinatra fan.He raises his eyebrows at me, his look speculative.Eclectic taste, Miss Steele, he murmurs, and he paces toward me like a panther until hes standing in front of me, his gaze so intense it takes my breath away.Frank starts crooning an old song, one of Rays favorites.Witchcraft.Christian leisurely traces his fingertips down my cheek, and I feel it all the way down there.Dance with me, he murmurs, his voice husky.Taking the remote out of his pocket, he turns up the volume and holds his hand out to me, his gray gaze full of promise and longing and humor.He is totally beguiling, and Im bewitched.I place my hand in his.He grins lazily down at me and pulls me into his embrace, his arm curling around my waist, and he starts to sway.I put my free hand on his shoulder and grin up at him, caught in his infectious, playful mood.And he starts to move.Boy can he dance.We cover the floor, from the window to the kitchen and back again, whirling and turning in time to the music.And he makes it so effortless for me to follow.We glide around the dining table, over to the piano, and backwards and forwards in front of the glass wall, Seattle twinkling outside, a dark and magical mural to our dance, and I cant help my carefree laugh.He grins down at me as the song comes to a close.Theres no nicer witch than you, he murmurs, then kisses me sweetly.Well, thats bought some color to your cheeks, Miss Steele.Thank you for the dance.Shall we go and meet my parents?Youre welcome, and yes, I cant wait to meet them, I answer breathlessly.Do you have everything you need?Oh, yes, I respond sweetly.Are you sure?I nod as nonchalantly as I can manage under his intense, amused scrutiny.His face splits into a huge grin, and he shakes his head.Okay.If thats the way you want to play it, Miss Steele.He grabs my hand, collects his jacket which is hanging on one of the barstools, and leads me through the foyer to the elevator.Oh, the many faces of Christian Grey.Will I ever be able to understand this mercurial man?I peek up at him in the elevator.Hes enjoying a private joke, a trace of a smile flirting with his beautiful mouth.I fear that it may be at my expense.What was I thinking?Im going to see his parents, and Im not wearing any underwear.My subconscious gives me an unhelpful I told you so expression.In the relative safety of his apartment, it seemed like a fun, teasing idea.Now, Im almost outside with No Panties!He peers down at me, and its there, the charge building between us.The amused look disappears from his face and his expression clouds, his eyes dark oh my.The elevator doors open on the ground floor.Christian shakes his head slightly as if to clear his thoughts and gestures for me to exit before him in a most gentlemanly manner.Whos he kidding?Hes no gentleman.He has my panties.Taylor draws up in the large Audi.Christian opens the rear door for me, and I climb inside as elegantly as I can, considering my state of wanton undress.Im grateful that Kates plum dress is so clingy and hangs to the top of my knees.We speed up the I 5, both of us quiet, no doubt inhibited by Taylors steady presence in the front.Christians mood is almost tangible and seems to shift, the humor dissipating slowly as we head north.Hes brooding, staring out of the window, and I can feel him slipping away from me.What is he thinking?I cant ask him.What can I say in front of Taylor?Where did you learn to dance?I ask tentatively.He turns to gaze at me, his eyes unreadable beneath the intermittent light of the passing street lamps.Do you really want to know?he replies softly.My heart sinks, and now I dont because I can guess.Yes, I murmur, reluctantly.Mrs.Robinson was fond of dancing.Oh, my worst suspicions confirmed.She has taught him well, and the thought depresses me  theres nothing I can teach him.I have no special skills.She must have been a good teacher.She was, he says softly.My scalp prickles.Did she have the best of him?Before he became so closed?Or did she bring him out of himself?He has such a fun, playful side.I smile involuntarily as I recall being in his arms as he spun me around his living room, so unexpected, and he has my panties, somewhere.And then theres the Red Room of Pain.I rub my wrists reflexively  thin strips of plastic will do that to a girl.She taught him all that too or ruined him, depending on ones point of view.Or perhaps he would have found his way there anyway in spite of Mrs.R.   I realize, in that moment, that I hate her.I hope that I never meet her because I will not be responsible for my actions if I do.I cant remember ever feeling this passionately about anyone, especially someone Ive never met.Gazing unseeing out of the window, I nurse my irrational anger and jealousy.My mind drifts back to the afternoon.Given what I understand of his preferences, I think hes been easy on me.Would I do it again?I cant even pretend to put up an argument against that.Of course I would, if he asked me  as long as he didnt hurt me and if its the only way to be with him.Thats the bottom line.I want to be with him.My inner goddess sighs with relief.I reach the conclusion that she rarely uses her brain to think but another vital part of her anatomy, and at the moment, its a rather exposed part.Dont, he murmurs.I frown and turn to look at him.Dont what?I havent touched him.Over think things, Anastasia.Reaching out, he grasps my hand, draws it up to his lips, and kisses my knuckles gently.I had a wonderful afternoon.Thank you.And hes back with me again.I blink up at him and smile shyly.Hes so confusing.I ask a question thats been bugging me.Why did you use a cable tie?He grins at me.Its quick, its easy, and its something different for you to feel and experience.I know theyre quite brutal, and I do like that in a restraining device.He smiles at me mildly.Very effective at keeping you in your place.I flush and glance nervously at Taylor, who remains impassive, eyes on road.What am I supposed to say to that?Christian shrugs innocently.All part of my world, Anastasia.He squeezes my hand and lets go, staring out of the window again.His world indeed, and I want to belong in it, but on his terms?I just dont know.He hasnt mentioned that damned contract.My inner musings do nothing to cheer me.I stare out of the window and the landscape has changed.Were crossing one of the bridges, surrounded by inky darkness.The somber night reflects my introspective mood, closing in, suffocating.I glance briefly at Christian, and hes staring at me.Penny for your thoughts?he asks.I sigh and frown.That bad, huh?I wish I knew what you were thinking.He smirks at me.Ditto, baby, he says softly as Taylor speeds into the night toward Bellevue.It is just before eight when the Audi draws into the driveway of a colonial style mansion.Its breathtaking, even down to the roses around the door.Picture book perfect.Are you ready for this?Christian asks as Taylor pulls up outside the impressive front door.I nod, and he gives my hand another reassuring squeeze.First for me too, he whispers, then smiles wickedly.Bet you wish you were wearing your underwear right now, he teases.I flush.Id forgotten my missing panties.Fortunately, Taylor has climbed out of the car and is opening my door so he cant hear our exchange.I scowl at Christian who grins broadly as I turn and climb out of the car.Dr.Grace Trevelyan Grey is on the doorstep waiting for us.She looks elegantly sophisticated in a pale blue silk dress; behind her stands Mr.Grey, I presume, tall, blond, and as handsome in his own way as Christian.Anastasia, youve met my mother, Grace.This is my dad, Carrick.Mr.Grey, what a pleasure to meet you.I smile and shake his outstretched hand.The pleasure is all mine, Anastasia.Please call me, Ana.His blue eyes are soft and gentle.Ana, how lovely to see you again.Grace wraps me in a warm hug.Come in, my dear.Is she here?I hear a screech from within the house.I glance nervously at Christian.That would be Mia, my little sister, he says almost irritably, but not quite.Theres an undercurrent of affection in his words, the way his voice grows softer and his eyes crinkle as he mentions her name.Christian obviously adores her.Its a revelation.And she comes barreling down the hall, raven haired, tall, and curvaceous.Shes about my age.Anastasia!Ive heard so much about you.She hugs me hard.Holy Cow.I cant help but smile at her boundless enthusiasm.Ana, please, I murmur as she drags me into the large vestibule.Its all dark wood floors and antique rugs with a sweeping staircase to the second floor.Hes never brought a girl home before, says Mia, dark eyes bright with excitement.I glimpse Christian rolling his eyes, and I raise an eyebrow at him.He narrows his eyes at me.Mia, calm down, Grace admonishes softly.Hello, darling, she says as she kisses Christian on both cheeks.He smiles down at her warmly, and then shakes hands with his father.We all turn and head into the living room.Mia has not let go of my hand.The room is spacious, tastefully furnished in creams, browns, and pale blue, comfortable, understated, and very stylish.Kate and Elliot are cuddled together on a couch, clutching champagne flutes.Kate bounces up to embrace me, and Mia finally releases my hand.Hi, Ana!She beams.Christian.She nods curtly to him.Kate.He is equally formal with her.I frown at their exchange.Elliot grasps me in an all embracing hug.What is this, hug Ana week?This dazzling display of affection  Im just not used to it.Christian stands at my side, wrapping his arm around me.Placing his hand on my hip, he spreads out his fingers and pulls me close.Everyone is staring at us.Its unnerving.Drinks?Mr.Grey seems to recover himself.Prosecco?Please, Christian and I speak in unison.Oh this is beyond weird.Mia claps her hands.Youre even saying the same things.Ill get them.She scoots out of the room.I flush scarlet, and seeing Kate sitting with Elliot, it occurs to me suddenly that the only reason Christian invited me is because Kate is here.Elliot probably freely and happily asked Kate to meet his parents.Christian was trapped  knowing that I would have found out via Kate.I frown at the thought.Hes been forced into the invitation.The realization is bleak and depressing.My subconscious nods sagely, a youve finally worked it out stupid look on her face.Dinners almost ready, Grace says as she follows Mia out of the room.Christian frowns as he gazes at me.Sit, he commands, pointing to the plush couch, and I do as Im told, carefully crossing my legs.He sits down beside me but doesnt touch me.We were just talking about vacations, Ana, Mr.Grey says kindly.Elliot has decided to follow Kate and her family to Barbados for a week.I glance at Kate, and she grins, her eyes bright and wide.Shes delighted.Katherine Kavanagh, show some dignity!Are you taking a break now youve finished your degree?Mr.Grey asks.Im thinking about going to Georgia for a few days, I reply.Christian gapes at me, blinking a couple of times, his expression unreadable.Oh shit.I havent mentioned this to him.Georgia?he murmurs.My mother lives there, and I havent seen her for a while.When were you thinking of going?His voice is low.Tomorrow, late evening.Mia saunters back into the living room and hands us champagne flutes filled with pale pink Prosecco.Your good health!Mr.Grey raises his glass.An appropriate toast from a doctors husband, it makes me smile.For how long?Christian asks, his voice deceptively soft.Holy crap hes angry.I dont know yet.It will depend how my interviews go tomorrow.His jaw clenches, and Kate gets that interfering look on her face.She smiles over sweetly.Ana deserves a break, she says pointedly at Christian.Why is she so antagonistic towards him?What is her problem?You have interviews?Mr.Grey asks.Yes, for internships at two publishers, tomorrow.I wish you the best of luck.Dinner is on the table, Grace announces.We all stand.Kate and Elliot follow Mr.Grey and Mia out of the room.I go to follow, but Christian clutches my elbow, bringing me to an abrupt halt.When were you going to tell me you were leaving?he asks urgently.His tone is soft, but hes masking his anger.Im not leaving, Im going to see my mother, and I was only thinking about it.What about our arrangement?We dont have an arrangement yet.He narrows his eyes, and then seems to remember himself.Releasing my hand, he takes my elbow and leads me out of the room.This conversation is not over, he whispers threateningly as we enter the dining room.Oh, crapola.Dont get your panties in such a twist and give me back mine.I glare at him.The dining room reminds me of our private dinner at the Heathman.A crystal chandelier hangs over the dark wood table and theres a massive, ornately carved mirror on the wall.The table is laid and covered with a crisp white linen tablecloth, a bowl of pale pink peonies as the center piece.Its stunning.We take our places.Mr.Grey is at the head of the table, while I sit at his right hand, and Christian is seated beside me.Mr.Grey reaches for the opened bottle of red wine and offers some to Kate.Mia takes her seat beside Christian, and grabbing his hand, squeezes it tightly.Christian smiles warmly at her.Where did you meet, Ana?Mia asks him.She interviewed me for the WSU student magazine.Which Kate edits, I add, hoping to steer the conversation away from me.Mia beams at Kate, seated opposite next to Elliot, and they start talking about the student magazine.Wine, Ana?Mr.Grey asks.Please.I smile at him.Mr.Grey rises to fill the rest of the glasses.I peek up at Christian, and he turns to look at me, his head cocked to one side.What?he asks.Please dont be mad at me, I whisper.Im not mad at you.I stare at him.He sighs.Yes, I am mad at you.He closes his eyes briefly.Palm twitchingly mad?I ask nervously.What are you two whispering about?Kate interjects.I flush, and Christian glares at her in a butt out of this Kavanagh kind of way  even Kate wilts under his stare.Just about my trip to Georgia, I say sweetly, hoping to diffuse their mutual hostility.Kate smiles, a wicked gleam in her eye.How was Jos when you went to the bar with him on Friday?Holy fuck, Kate.I widen my eyes at her.What is she doing?She widens her eyes back at me, and I realize shes trying to make Christian jealous.How little she knows.I thought Id got away with this.He was fine, I murmur.Christian leans over.Palm twitchingly mad, he whispers.Especially now.His tone is quiet and deadly.Oh no.I squirm.Grace reappears carrying two plates, followed by a pretty young woman with blonde pigtails, dressed smartly in pale blue, carrying a tray of plates.Her eyes immediately find Christian in the room.She blushes and gazes at him from under her long mascarad lashes.What!Somewhere in the house the phone starts ringing.Excuse me, Mr.Grey rises again and exits.Thank you, Gretchen, Grace says gently, frowning as Mr.Grey exits.Just leave the tray on the console.Gretchen nods, and with another furtive glance at Christian, she leaves.So the Greys have staff, and the staff are eyeing up my would be Dominant.Can this evening get any worse?I scowl at my hands in my lap.Mr.Grey returns.Call for you, darling.Its the hospital, he says to Grace.Please start, everyone.Grace smiles as she hands me a plate and leaves.It smells delicious  chorizo and scallops with roasted red peppers and shallots, sprinkled with flat leafed parsley.And in spite of the fact that my stomach is churning from Christians veiled threats, the surreptitious glances from pretty little Miss Pigtails, and the debacle of my missing underwear, I am starving.I flush as I realize its the physical effort of this afternoon thats given me such an appetite.Moments later Grace returns, her brow furrowed.Mr.Grey cocks his head to one side like Christian.Everything okay?Another measles case, Grace sighs.Oh no.Yes, a child.The fourth case this month.If only people would get their kids vacci nated.She shakes her head sadly, and then smiles.Im so glad our children never went through that.They never caught anything worse than chicken pox, thank goodness.Poor Elliot, she says as she sits down, smiling indulgently at her son.Elliot frowns mid chew and squirms uncomfortably.Christian and Mia were lucky.They got it so mildly, only a spot to share between them.Mia giggles, and Christian rolls his eyes.So, did you catch the Mariners game, Dad?Elliots clearly keen to move the conversation on.The hors doeuvres are delicious, and I concentrate on eating while Elliot, Mr.Grey, and Christian talk baseball.Christian seems relaxed and calm talking to his family.My mind is working furiously.Damn Kate, what game is she playing?Will he punish me?I quail at the thought.I havent signed that contract yet.Perhaps I wont.Perhaps Ill stay in Georgia where he cant reach me.How are you settling into your new apartment dear?Grace asks politely.Im grateful for her question, distracting me from my discordant thoughts, and I tell her about our move.As we finish our starters, Gretchen appears, and not for the first time, I wish I felt able to put my hands freely on Christian just to let her know  he may be fifty shades of fucked up, but hes mine.She proceeds to clear the table, brushing rather too closely to Christian for my liking.Fortunately, he seems oblivious to her, but my inner goddess is smoldering and not in a good way.Kate and Mia are waxing lyrical about Paris.Have you been to Paris, Ana?Mia asks innocently, distracting me from my jealous reverie.No, but Id love to go.I know Im the only one at the table who has never left mainland USA.We honeymooned in Paris.Grace smiles at Mr.Grey who grins back at her.Its almost embarrassing to witness.They obviously love each other deeply, and I wonder for a brief moment what it must be like to grow up with both ones parents in situ.Its a beautiful city, Mia agrees.In spite of the Parisians.Christian, you should take Ana to Paris, Mia states firmly.I think Anastasia would prefer London, Christian says softly.Oh he remembered.He places his hand on my knee  his fingers traveling up my thigh.My whole body tightens in response.No not here, not now.I flush and shift, trying to pull away from him.His hand clamps down on my thigh, stilling me.I reach for my wine, in desperation.Little Miss European Pigtails returns, all coy glances and swaying hips, with our en tre, a Beef Wellington, I think.Fortunately, she gives us our plates and then leaves, although she lingers handing Christian his.He looks quizzically at me as I watch her close the dining room door.So what was wrong with the Parisians?Elliot asks his sister.Didnt they take to your winsome ways?Ugh, no they didnt.And Monsieur Floubert, the ogre I was working for, he was such a domineering tyrant.I splutter into my wine.Anastasia, are you okay?Christian asks solicitously, taking his hand off my thigh.Humor has returned to his voice.Oh thank heavens.When I nod, he pats my back gently, and only removes his hand when he knows Ive recovered.The beef is delicious and served with roasted sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and green beans.It is even more palatable since Christian manages to retain his good humor for the rest of the meal.I suspect that its because Im eating so heartily.The conversation flows freely among the Greys, warm and caring, gently teasing each other.Over our dessert of lemon syllabub, Mia regales us with her exploits in Paris, lapsing at one point into fluent French.We all stare at her, and she stares back puzzled, until Christian tells her in equally fluent French what shes done, whereupon she bursts into a fit of giggles.She has a very infectious laugh and soon were all in stitches.Elliot holds forth about his latest building project, a new eco friendly community to the north of Seattle.I glance up at Kate, and shes hanging on every word Elliot says, her eyes glowing with lust or love.I havent quite worked out which yet.He grins down at her, and its as if an unspoken promise passes between them.Laters, baby, hes saying, and its hot, freaking hot.I flush just watching them.I sigh and peek up at Fifty Shades.Hes so beautiful, I could stare at him forever.He has light stubble over his chin, and my fingers itch to scratch it and feel it against my face, against my breasts between my thighs.I blush at the direction of my thoughts.He peers down at me and raises his hand to pull at my chin.Dont bite your lip, he murmurs huskily.I want to do that.Grace and Mia clear our dessert glasses and head to the kitchen, while Mr.Grey, Kate, and Elliot discuss the merits of solar panels in Washington State.Christian, feigning interest in their conversation, puts his hand once more on my knee, and his fingers travel up my thigh.My breathing hitches, and I press my thighs together in a bid to halt his progress.I can see him smirk.Shall I give you a tour of the grounds?he asks me quite openly.I know Im meant to say yes, but I dont trust him.Before I can answer however, hes on his feet and holding his hand out to me.I place my hand in his, and I feel all the muscles clench deep in my belly, responding to his dark, hungry gray gaze.Excuse me, I say to Mr.Grey and follow Christian out of the dining room.He leads me through the hallway and into the kitchen where Mia and Grace are stack ing the dishwasher.European Pigtails is nowhere to be seen.Im going to show Anastasia the backyard, Christian says innocently to his mother.She waves us out with a smile as Mia heads back to the dining room.We step out onto a grey flagstone patio area lit by recessed lights in the flagstones.There are shrubs in grey stone tubs and a chic metal table and chairs set up in one corner.Christian walks past those, up some steps, and onto a vast lawn that leads down to the bay oh my  its beautiful.Seattle twinkles on the horizon, and the cool, bright, May moon etches a sparkling silver path across the water toward a jetty where two boats are moored.Beside the jetty stands a boathouse.It is so picturesque, so peaceful.I stand and gape for a moment.Christian pulls me behind him, and my heels sink into the soft grass.Stop, please.I am stumbling in his wake.He stops and gazes at me, his expression unfathomable.My heels.I need to take my shoes off.Dont bother, he says, and he bends down and scoops me over his shoulder.I squeal loudly with shocked surprise, and he gives me a ringing slap on my behind.Keep your voice down, he growls.Oh no this is not good, my subconscious is quaking at the knees.Hes mad about something  could be Jos, Georgia, no panties, biting my lip.Jeez, hes easy to rile.Where are we going?I breathe.Boathouse, he snaps.I hang on to his hips as Im tipped upside down, and he strides purposefully in the moonlight across the lawn.Why?I sound breathless, bouncing on this shoulder.I need to be alone with you.What for?Because Im going to spank and then fuck you.Why?I whimper softly.You know why, he hisses.I thought you were an in the moment guy?I plead breathlessly.Anastasia, Im in the moment, trust me.Holy fuck.Christian bursts through the wooden door of the boathouse and pauses to flick on some lights.Fluorescents ping and buzz in sequence as harsh white light floods the large wooden building.From my upside down view, I can see an impressive motor launch in the dock floating gently on the dark water, but I only get a brief look before hes carrying me up some wooden stairs to the room above.He pauses at the doorway and touches another switch  halogens this time, they are softer, on a dimmer  and were in an attic room with sloping ceilings.Its decorated with a nautical New England theme: navy blues and creams with a dash of red.The furnishings are sparse, just a couple of couches are all I can see.Christian sets me on my feet on the wooden floor.I dont have time to examine my surroundings  my eyes cant leave him.I am mesmerized watching him like one would watch a rare and dangerous predator, waiting for him to strike.His breathing is harsh but then hes just carried me across the lawn and up a flight of stairs.Gray eyes blaze with anger, need, and pure unadulterated lust.Holy shit.I could spontaneously combust from his look alone.Please dont hit me, I whisper, pleading.His brow furrows, his eyes widening.He blinks twice.I dont want you to spank me, not here, not now.Please dont.His mouth drops open slightly in surprise, and beyond brave, I tentatively reach up and run my fingers down his cheek, along the edge of his sideburn, to the stubble on his chin.Its a curious mixture of soft and prickly.Slowly closing his eyes, he leans his face into my touch, and his breath hitches in his throat.Reaching up with my other hand, I run my fingers into his hair.I love his hair.His soft moan is barely audible, and when he opens his eyes, his look is  wary, like he doesnt understand what Im doing.Stepping forward so I am flush against him, I pull gently on his hair, bringing his mouth down to mine, and I kiss him, forcing my tongue between his lips and into his mouth.He groans, and his arms embrace me, pulling me to him.His hands find their way into my hair, and he kisses me back, hard and possessive.His tongue and my tongue twist and turn together, consuming each other.He tastes divine.He pulls back suddenly, our collective breathing ragged and mingling.My hands drop to his arms and he glares down at me.What are you doing to me?he whispers confused.Kissing you.You said no.What?No to what?At the dinner table, with your legs.Oh thats what this is all about.But we were at your parents dining table.I stare up at him, completely bewildered.No ones ever said no to me before.And its so  hot.His eyes widen slightly, filled with wonder and lust.Its a heady mix.I swallow instinctively.His hand moves down to my behind.He pulls me sharply against him, and I can feel his erection.Oh my  Youre mad and turned on because I said no?I breathe, astonished.Im mad because you never mentioned Georgia to me.Im mad because you went drinking with that guy who tried to seduce you when you were drunk and who left you when you were ill with an almost complete stranger.What kind of friend does that?And Im mad and aroused because you closed your legs on me.His eyes glitter dangerously, and hes slowly inching up the hem of my dress.I want you, and I want you now.And if youre not going to let me spank you  which you deserve  Im going to fuck you on the couch this minute, quickly, for my pleasure, not yours.My dress is now barely covering my naked behind.He moves suddenly so that his hand is cupping my sex, and one of his fingers sinks slowly into me.His other arm holds me firmly in place around my waist.I suppress my moan.This is mine, he whispers aggressively.All mine.Do you understand?He eases his finger in and out as he gazes down at me, gauging my reaction, his eyes burning.Yes, yours, I breathe as my desire, hot and heavy, surges through my bloodstream, affecting everything.My nerve endings, my breathing, my heart is pounding, trying to leave my chest, the blood thrumming in my ears.Abruptly, he moves, doing several things at once.Withdrawing his fingers, leaving me wanting, unzipping his fly, and pushing me down onto the couch so hes lying on top of me.Hands on your head, he commands through gritted teeth as he kneels up, forcing my legs wider, and reaching into the inside pocket of his jacket.He takes out a foil packet, gazing down at me, his expression dark, before shrugging off his jacket so it falls to the floor.He rolls the condom down over his impressive length.I place my hands on my head, and I know its so I wont touch him.Im so turned on.I feel my hips moving already up to meet him  wanting him inside me, like this  rough and hard.Oh the anticipation.We dont have long.This will be quick, and its for me, not you.Do you understand?Dont come, or I will spank you, he says through clenched teeth.Holy crap how do I stop?With one swift thrust, hes fully inside me.I groan loudly, gutturally, and revel in the fullness of his possession.He puts his hands on mine on top of my head, his elbows hold my arms out and down, and his legs pinion me.I am trapped.Hes everywhere, overwhelming me, almost suffocating.But its heavenly too, this is my power, this is what I do to him, and its a hedonistic, triumphant feeling.He moves quickly and furiously inside me, his breathing harsh at my ear, and my body responds, melting around him.I mustnt come.No.But Im meeting him thrust for thrust, a perfect counterpoint.Abruptly, and all too soon, he rams into me and stills as he finds his release, air hissing through his teeth.He relaxes momentarily, so I feel his entire, delicious weight on me.Im not ready to let him go, my body craving relief, but hes so heavy, and in that moment, I cant push against him.All of a sudden, he withdraws, leaving me aching and hungry for more.He glares down at me.Dont touch yourself.I want you frustrated.Thats what you do to me by not talking to me, by denying me whats mine.His eyes blaze anew, angry again.I nod, panting.He stands and removes the condom, knotting it at the end, and puts it in his pants pocket.I gaze at him, my breathing still erratic, and involuntarily I squeeze my thighs together, trying to find some relief.Christian does up his fly and runs his hand through his hair as he reaches down to collect his jacket.He turns back to gaze down at me, his expression softer.Wed better get back to the house.I sit up, a little unsteadily, dazed.Here.You may put these on.From his inside pocket, he produces my panties.I dont grin as I take them from him, but inside I know  Ive taken a punishment fuck but gained a small victory over the panties.My inner goddess nods in agreement, a satisfied grin over her face  You didnt have to ask for them.CHRISTIAN!Mia shouts from the floor below.He turns and raises his eyebrows at me.Just in time.Christ, she can be really irritating.I scowl back at him, hastily restore my panties to their rightful place, and stand with as much dignity as I can muster in my just fucked state.Quickly, I attempt to smooth my just fucked hair.Up here, Mia, he calls down.Well, Miss Steele, I feel better for that  but I still want to spank you, he says softly.I dont believe I deserve it Mr.Grey, especially after tolerating your unprovoked attack.Unprovoked?You kissed me.He tries his best to look wounded.I purse my lips.It was attack as the best form of defense.Defense against what?You and your twitchy palm.He cocks his head to one side and smiles at me as Mia comes clattering up the stairs.But it was tolerable?he asks softly.I flush.Barely, I whisper, but I cant help my smirk.Oh, there you are.She beams at us.I was showing Anastasia around.Christian holds his hand out to me, his gray eyes intense.I put my hand into his, and he gives it a soft squeeze.Kate and Elliot are about to leave.Can you believe those two?They cant keep their hands off each other.Mia feigns disgust and looks from Christian to me.What have you been doing in here?Jeez, shes forward.I blush scarlet.Showing Anastasia my rowing trophies, Christian says without missing a beat, completely poker faced.Lets go say goodbye to Kate and Elliot.Rowing trophies?He pulls me gently in front of him, and as Mia turns to go, he swats my behind.I gasp in surprise.I will do it again, Anastasia, and soon, he threatens quietly close to my ear, then he pulls me into an embrace, my back to his front, and kisses my hair.Back in the house, Kate and Elliot are making their farewells to Grace and Mr.Grey.Kate hugs me hard.I need to speak to you about antagonizing Christian, I hiss quietly in her ear as she embraces me.He needs antagonizing, then you can see what hes really like.Be careful, Ana  hes so controlling, she whispers.See you later.I KNOW WHAT HES REALLY LIKE  YOU DONT!I scream at her in my head.Im fully aware that her actions come from a good place, but sometimes she just oversteps the mark, and right now so far that shes into the neighboring state.I scowl at her, and she pokes her tongue out at me, making me smile unwillingly.Playful Kate is novel, must be Elliots influence.We wave them off at the doorway, and Christian turns to me.We should go too  you have interviews tomorrow.Mia embraces me warmly as we say our goodbyes.We never thought hed find anyone!she gushes.I flush, and Christian rolls his eyes again.I purse my lips.Why can he do that when I cant?I want to roll my eyes back at him, but I do not dare, not after his threat in the boathouse.Take care of yourself, Ana, dear, Grace says kindly.Christian, embarrassed or frustrated by the lavish attention Im receiving from the remaining Greys, grabs my hand and pulls me to his side.Lets not frighten her away or spoil her with too much affection, he grumbles.Christian, stop teasing.Grace scolds him indulgently, her eyes glowing with love and affection for him.Somehow, I dont think hes teasing.I surreptitiously watch their interaction.Its obvious Grace adores him with a mothers unconditional love.He bends and kisses her stiffly.Mom, he says, and theres an undercurrent in his voice  reverence maybe?Mr.Grey  goodbye and thank you.I hold out my hand to him, and he hugs me too!Please, call me Carrick.I do hope we see you again, very soon, Ana.Our farewells said, Christian leads me to the car where Taylor is waiting.Has he been waiting here the whole time?Taylor opens my door, and I slide into the back of the Audi.I feel some of the tension leaving my shoulders.Jeez, what a day.I am exhausted, physically and emotionally.After a brief conversation with Taylor, Christian clambers into the car beside me.He turns to face me.Well, it seems my family likes you, too, he murmurs.Too?The depressing thought about how I came to be invited pops unbidden and very unwelcome into my head.Taylor starts the car and heads away from the circle of light in the driveway to the darkness of the road.I gaze at Christian, and hes staring at me.What?
