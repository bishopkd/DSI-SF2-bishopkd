The Basque really know how to get married, Ginger Dysart thought.She hadnt attended the wedding ceremony and shed had doubts about attending this reception, given all the sadness shed suffered over the past year.Her own marriage had barely begun when it ended in divorce.But she was so glad shed come to the reception.It was an ethnic extravaganza the Basque food, the music, the dancing.The bride and groom, Scott and Peyton Grant, had whirled around the dance floor a couple of times, then parted so Scott could dance with his mother and Peyton could dance with her father.And then there was a series of handsome dark haired men who claimed the bride brothers, cousins, uncles.Paco Lacoumette presided over the party with all the aplomb of a king and was clearly in his element.The couples dancing would cease and the Basque men in their traditional dress of white with red vests and caps would take the floor and put on a show to the wild applause of the guests.Then more couples dancing.Even Ginger was dragged from her chair and pulled out to dance, despite her efforts to decline.She danced with men she knewCooper, Spencer, Mac, Scott and men she didnt know, those good looking, dark Lacoumette relatives.At one point she spied Troy, Graces boyfriend, who must have just arrived.Grace, Gingers boss and owner of the flower shop in Thunder Point, thought Troy wasnt going to make it and had been so disappointed, yet there he was, twirling Grace around with almost professional skill.And judging by the glowing look on Graces face, she was completely thrilled!Wine flowed, food was constantly replenished, dancing and laughter filled the night.Ginger felt pretty for the first time in so long.She wore a new dress, cut to her slim figure.Shed lost a lot of weight in the past several months; men were looking at her in a way they hadnt before, and she actually enjoyed the feel of their eyes on her.Those lusty, dark haired Basque men did nothing to conceal their appreciative gazes.The whole atmosphere was magical teenagers were dancing or dashing about the grounds and orchard, sneaking behind trees for stolen kisses, children were riding on the shoulders of fathers, grandfathers and uncles, women were clapping in time to the music, laughing, singing, gossiping.Peyton and Scott were in much demand on the dance floor and in between songs many toasts were made.There were far too many Lacoumettes to remember all their names, but they made her feel welcome and appreciated, thanking her repeatedly for helping Grace bring the wedding flowers.There was one darkly handsome man shed noticed right away because he was the only one who seemed sulky and unhappy, and he was the one approaching her now as she stood beside her table.He had the swarthy good looks and fierce eyes of a pirate or maybe a serial killer.And with such precision timing, he had singled her out while everyone else from her table was dancing.Hey, pretty lady, he said with a smile that was off kilter.His words were slurred.That would at least partially account for the half mast eyes and pouting expression he was obviously drunk.Well, this happened at weddings with great regularity, especially weddings where the wine flowed so liberally.Time for a dance!he said.Thank you, but Im going to sit this one out, she replied.Hmm, he said, stroking his chin.Then we should go straight to the hayloft!She was appalled.But she remained composed and confident.Im sitting that out, as well.No, come with me, he said.You and me lets do this.And then he reached for her.And grabbed her right breast.She shrieked, shoved him away.His feet got tangled, he fell backward over a chair and went down, hitting his head on the way.And there he lay, motionless and unconscious.Help, she said.Then louder.Help!She got far more attention than she wanted or expected.And of course, there were the questions.What happened?Are you hurt?Did he pass out?Is he dead?He grabbed at me, she said, waving a hand over the area of her breast without pointing or saying it.I shoved him away and he fell and...I think he mightve hit his head on the table.There he lay in a heap, on his back, his legs twisted awkwardly.In just seconds Peyton and Scott were there, Scott crouching and lifting the mans eyelids, looking at his pupils.Well, theyre equal, but damn...theyre big.Does he take anything?he asked his bride.Yes, wine, Peyton said.He killed a full skin before the dancing.Then Paco was pushing his way through the crowd, looking down.I knew it would come to this, he said.There was no slowing him down.I think we should call 911, get a head CT, make sure he didnt crack his skull, Scott said.His head is made of wood, Paco said.It would serve him right to be carried out of his sisters wedding on one of those backboard things and spend the night in a hospital.Paco reached for the ice bucket on the table.Everyone scooted back immediately, as if they knew what was coming.Peyton pulled Scott away while Paco took a bottle of white wine out of the bucket, put it on the table and doused the man with the ice water.He sputtered and coughed and sat up.See what Im telling you?Wood.George!Sal!Mikie!Get Matthew from your sisters wedding!Hide his keys!The men moved into action immediately.Paco looked at Ginger and said, Theres always one.I apologize.Then he took in the gathering crowd and clapped.I think its time I dance with my wife!Grace arrived, pushing her way through the crowd.Ginger!Is everything all right?Im not sure, she said, looking as the men were leaving three of them walking steadily and one weaving dangerously.My brother, Matt, Peyton said.He has issues.Divorce issues.He was divorced a little over a year ago but it appears hes still very bitter.Weddings dont seem to bring out the best in him.He didnt hurt you, did he?He didnt quite connect, Ginger said.I was about to say good night anyway.Im going back to my folks house in Portland for the night.I might kill Matt, Peyton said.Just enjoy the rest of your party, Ginger said.No harm done.To me, anyway.God, I hope I didnt hurt him.You heard my father his head is made of wood.Ill call you in the morning, Grace said.Troy had some car trouble on the way up here and well have to see where that stands in the morning and figure out how were all getting home.Ive got the van, you take your fathers car back to him.Ginger turned to Peyton.It was a wonderful reception.You look ravishing.And I was just thinking, the Basque people really know how to get married.* * * Gingers parents, Dick and Sue, had waited up.That was definite evidence as to how concerned they were about her they stayed up past ten when their usual bedtime was before nine.And when she walked in the front door, looking perfectly alive, they both stood from their recliners.They looked at her expectantly.Did you have a good time?Sue asked hesitantly.I had a lovely time, she said.The flowers were beautiful, the wedding party was gorgeous and the party was like something out of a fairy tale.You wouldnt believe the fun of Basque dancing and music!And the food?Oh, my God, the food was just amazing.And Im exhaustedIm going straight to bed.Are you...comfortable in your room, Ginger?Sue asked.Yes, of course.And thank you for making it so nice for me.She kissed them both on their cheeks and went upstairs.Upstairs to the large bedroom and small adjacent nursery that had been renovated especially for her when shed come home to her parents, pregnant and alone; to the room where she had cared for her little son for the four short months of his life.Ginger had been staying with her fathers cousin Ray Anne in Thunder Point for the last month.It was through Ray Anne that shed gotten the job in Graces flower shop, a job that was really saving her life, hour by hour.Before she came back to Portland with Grace for this wedding and weekend visit, Ray Anne had called Sue and asked her to pack up all those baby things that Ginger had been looking at since his death over nine months ago.The crib and mobile had been taken down, the clothes removed from the drawers, boxed up and stored, the necessary accoutrements like the car seat, bouncy chair, baby bean bag, bath items and changing table were all gone.She didnt think her parents had given them away, but they were out of sight.Probably stored in the attic or garage.There was only one framed picture of Ginger and Josh that she found in the top drawer.She took it out, put it on the bedside table and changed into her pajamas.When her father had suggested, rather emotionally, that Ginger go to Thunder Point and stay with Ray Anne for at least a few weeks, she had not wanted any part of it.But it was plain to see her parents needed a break from her grief.Now she was so glad she had gone.When she was in Thunder Point, she at least had the illusion of getting on with her life.She had a new, improved appearance, at Ray Annes insistence.She had that lovely little job in the flower shop.She had slept well and had an appetite again.Oh, shed longed for little Josh, like always.But she was marching on.She crawled into the bed at her parents house, turned the picture of herself and her baby toward her, left the light on so she could see it and sobbed.* * * Troy Headly had missed the Lacoumette Grant wedding ceremony and barely made it to the reception.His Jeep had broken down by the side of the road and AAA had to send a tow truck.At least the tow truck driver had been willing to drop him off at the Lacoumette farm where the festivities were held, but it left him and Grace with her flower delivery van to drive to a hotel in Portland.They left the valet to park the flower van so they could check in.The day was not going the way hed hoped it would.He had proposed, however.In the pear grove at the farm while the revelers had partied under a big tent beside the grove.And Grace had said yes.When he finally had her alone in the hotel room, he kissed her senseless.Do you really like the ring, Gracie?Because we could go together to the jeweler and get a better one...Youre not taking my ring!she said emphatically.She placed it on her finger.You picked it out yourself and I love it!I love you!I couldnt wear it tonight and draw attention to myself like that its Peytons day.But the second we get home, Im going to be showing everyone.Then she was the one who grew serious.Are you sure about this, Troy?Because you didnt want a wife so soon...He laughed and whirled her around and swept her onto the bed.He pulled off her pumps and ran a hand up her thigh.I didnt want children so soon, either, but guess what?Were starting right now.He covered her flat belly with his big hand.Were going to have to get better at this birth control thing or well end up with twenty.I dont think theres time for twenty, she said.Gracie, he said, his hand roaming, his voice a little breathless.Is this a garter belt?She shrugged.I think you bring out the slutty underwear in me.Oh, honey, you plan to drug me with sex and get at least ten babies out of me before I know whats hit me.Is that right?Huh?When are we getting married?We have a little time.Maybe we should elope before my mother tries to plan a coronation from her sickbed.I dont want to elope, he said.I want to party!Please, Gracie, take off this dress!Lets do it, then we can argue about the wedding.I always get my way after I make you feel good.He kissed her.I know exactly how to get my way.He pulled down the zipper on the back of her dress and helped her shimmy out of it.God, he said.Im going to make you very happy.* * * George Lacoumette and his wife, Lori, insisted on taking Matt to the hospital...with a bucket in his lap.They didnt really think hed cracked his head open, they explained.They thought the likelihood of concussion was lower than alcohol poisoning.But there would be nothing as awkward as the untimely death of a member of the wedding party.In an effort to protect Peytons happy memories of her special day, they forced Matt into their car and then into the emergency room.Matt was pissed as hell.He knew hed been out of line and regretted it, but he wanted to be taken home.He still lived in the apartment hed shared with his ex wife, Natalie, a woman he still loved, except that he hated her.It was Natalies fault that hed gotten smashed at the wedding.Theyd been married on the farm and he was still in a state of anger and depression over the divorce, which had come much too soon after the wedding.The ER doctor started an IV, then left the room as a bag of fluid ran into Matt.He sobered up fast.The doctor returned after a while.Wow, Matt said.I only see one of you!Welcome back.The doctor laughed.I didnt know you could do that!One IV, instant sobriety!Instant shame!Yeah, its magic.So, you have a headache?Right here, Matt said, pointing to the back of his head.Am I injured?Possible liver damage, but we didnt see any blood or bumps.Lets check the eyes.The doctor waved a light across his pupils.Im going to go out on a limb here and suggest you bumped your head on the way to passing out.So this a problem for you?Hitting my head and passing out?he asked.No, drinking like a pig and falling down, the doctor clarified.Are you an alcoholic?Ah, shit.He rubbed his head.Im divorced.I got married in that same orchard a couple of years ago.It didnt last long.The marriage, that is.It was kind of...whats the word?Painful?Embarrassing?Grievous?Lonely?Regrettable?the doctor tried.Yeah, those are the words.I mightve overdone it a little tonight.So youre not adjusting well?he asked.My brothers and sisters have taken to calling me Mad Matt.Does that tell you anything?You might want to consider some counseling.Before you really hurt yourself.Doc, I appreciate your help, but if theres one thing I dont ever want to talk about its my ex wife and my divorce.Brother, there is life after divorce.I am living proof.You?Me.According to my ex wife I keep lousy hours, Im inattentive off the job, I dont pitch in, Im snarky and critical, a tightwad, insensitive, selfish, many negative things.The list is long.I didnt think anyone divorced a doctor, Matt said, sounding surprised.The divorce rate among doctors is high, he said.Im going to let you go home.If you have any problems or questions, call me.Dont sit and wonder if youre okay, just call me.And be done drinking for the day.Funny, Matt said, the divorce rate among farmers is low.Yet...Even if you were given a reason, thats just one opinion, the doctor said.You going to be okay now?Yeah, he said, sitting up.I have to come up with a good apology for my sister, the bride.I dont think Ill see her tomorrow.Theres the honeymoon and everything.And she wasnt the only one he should apologize to, but that other woman, whose name he never got, was long gone.Look, kid, youre young, the doctor said.Youll get past this divorce thing.It happens to the best of us.The next time youll be wiser and more patient about everything.Next time?Matt asked.Youre kidding me, right?The doctor, who wasnt that much older than Matt, clapped a hand on his back and said, Youre like looking in an old mirror.* * * Matt had fallen in love with Natalie instantly.True, hed been all of twenty five, but if that hadnt been love hed sure like to know what it was.At the time he was giving a couple of lectures at Portland State; his masters degree was in biology.His undergrad degree was in plant biology, he had minored in agricultural science and he was a farmer.He was also a visiting professor, which had made his father laugh.But Matt knew a lot about farming, pesticides, organic farming, water runoff, landscape contouring, animal husbandry, you name it.In pursuit of his degrees hed studied agriculture, environmental science, and the care and breeding of animals, and that made him a valuable resource.It didnt hurt that his father was the owner of one of the most prosperous farms in the state, with two of his sons, Matt and George, being associates.And Natalie had been a biology department secretary, also twenty five, with the longest legs he had ever seen.She was so pretty and fun loving and dating her had been sheer bliss.He hadnt rushed into anything, despite that ER doctors assumptions.They went out for months before they moved in together.She wasnt Basque, which suited him fine.She was of Swedish descent, with a few other European countries in the mix.She was very polite to his family but made it no secret, from their first date, she was never going to be a farm wife.He had no quarrel with that, either.He wasnt looking for a farm wife, just as his sisters hadnt been looking to marry farmers.She didnt want a slew of children.He was okay with that, but he wanted a couple of kids and so had she.Later, shed said.No hurry.Matt loved the farm.But in order to commit to a relationship, one makes compromises.He and Natalie didnt have to live on the farm.Theyd build a house closer to the city, when they could afford it.He commuted from their small apartment near Portland and spent the occasional night on the farm when it was a real busy time planting, harvesting or lambing.George had the sheep, but Matt was always there to help, too with the breeding, shearing, lambing, inoculations, docking and castrating.Matt wouldnt marry Natalie until it was clear he wasnt giving up the farm.Knowing that, Natalie still wanted to get married.She chose the orchard as the venue but the reception was held in a large hall in Portland.When a bee stung her forehead during the vows, causing a very large red bump, it should have been an omen.But even with that big red bump the size of a quarter right in the middle of her forehead, the wedding was a success.The wedding pictures had to be doctored, but they were beautiful.If you could predict the success of the marriage by the wedding, they should have made it fifty years.Not only were all the Basque relatives present but also every friend and family member Natalie had ever known.Very soon after the wedding, before the last thank you note had been written, Natalie was already growing unhappy.She didnt like his hours or the dirt under his nails or those big family dinners on the farm with all the noise and chaos.Being married to a farmer, even a commuting farmer, was trying and boring for her.He was up at 4:00 a. m.  and home, exhausted and hungry, at five, and in bed by eight.Shed rather have brunch at the Hotel Monaco than dinner with the Lacoumette clan.She liked clubbing and dancing.And shed appreciate it if he could stay awake through one movie!Natalie had many suggestions for alternate careers.Matt could get his PhD and teach full time, even head a department.He could consult for companies.He could go to medical school; his degree was a premed qualifier.Or he could go to work for one of the big food companies, like Harry & David.Hed be president in no time!As for Natalie, she was only working at the college to supplement her income, most of which she spent on clothes, while she built her modeling career.It was important for a model to look good and she did.Well, she definitely had the body for it tall and lean and beautiful.Shed had a few modeling jobs, but that career choice wasnt exactly taking off for her and she was already aging out of it.Matt tried to be supportive even though he thought her expectations were unreasonable if not delusional.Thus, they argued quite a bit.Every day, in fact.A few times hed stormed out and gone back to the farm for the night.Though annoyed by the fighting, he tried not to take it too seriously.Sometimes he just laughed and kissed her ear.Ill try to get all the dirt out from under my nails before I come home, babe.He encouraged her to do what she wanted and he would follow his dream and they could meet in the middle.He supported them and she spent her money on herself, which was perfectly fine with him.He just wished she could be more agreeable.He wasnt sure what more he could do.Everyone in his family had an opinion about his disintegrating marriage.Theres a period of adjustment, his mother had said.Women have to think theyre getting their way, at least most of the time, George had said.Youre both young and need to mature, Lori had said.You have to talk to the priest, Ginny had said.You worked out these details before the wedding, Paco had said.Tell her a deals a deal!But it all unraveled.The fighting escalated; cruel and terrible things were said and done.There were tears and the sounds of hearts breaking.They didnt make it a year.Both of them were in a great deal of pain with a complete inability to find any more compromises or solutions and, ultimately, an inability to forgive and repair the damage.Matt spent many nights on the sofa while Natalie sobbed and raged.She wanted him to understand she felt trapped.She didnt want to be stuck in a small apartment with a bunch of kids, held captive in a life that she didnt sign on for, no nightlife, no romance, in laws who treated her like an outsiderlike a ridiculous child because she dressed nicely rather than in jeans and rubber boots.His work at Lacoumette Farms wasnt a job, it was a life sentence!She never saw him, they argued but never talked like they used to and he never saw the need to court her anymore.Then one fateful morning when Matt could go no further, he got up at his usual 4:00 a. m.  and left her a note.Ill be at the farm if you have an emergency and need me.Ill stay there until you move out.Please let me know when that will happen.Or, if you want the apartment, you can have it and I will live at the farm.Its over.A New Hope        Two The flower shop was a safe haven for Ginger.She couldnt possibly have handpicked a better place to rejoin the human race even though she found herself surrounded by pregnant women.She would have expected to be envious or frightened for them or thrown into worse depression over losing her own precious son.But strangely, it felt like exactly the right place for her, among this group of women.It allowed her to finally talk about her own pregnancy and childbirth, both of which were wonderful experiences.In fact, she had been so healthy and energetic, her son so perfect, he should be toddling around now, not gone.Truthfully, she was a little envious.The caveat was she probably would never have the courage to try for another baby, even if she had the chance.Talking with Peyton was particularly encouraging, however.Her medical training emphasized what Ginger had learned from the doctors and in her own readingshe had done nothing wrong.SIDS was extremely rare, one of those unpredictable flukes that was not likely to ever happen again in her family.As if Id ever be brave enough to risk it by having another child, Ginger said.I cant imagine how fearful that concept must be, Peyton said.But the next time youre blessed, your circumstances will be very different.Youll have a lot more support.Not to mention close medical supervision.Just getting over this one is a big enough job for right now.And thats what she was finally doing, one day at a time.And in the best possible placein a quiet shop that did brisk business but was not crowded with people all day.She was becoming skilled at building and even creating the arrangements that Grace sold and those hours she spent by herself in the back room with the flowers were important to her healing.She was productive and she could think, but she didnt think too much because Thunder Point was a town bristling with friendly people.Had she come here on her own, she mightve remained a stranger for a long time, but she was living with Ray Anne.Everyone knew Ray Anne.And since Ray Anne had told her friends about Gingers circumstances, she had frequent company.People would drop by the shop to chat, stop her on the street or in the diner to visit a little; theyd include her in plans, or sometimes Ray Anne would invite a small group of women over to the house.Rather than feeling self conscious and marked as the one whose husband left and baby died, she had an almost instant sense of belonging.There was abundant nurturing.And she was needed.Boy, was she needed!Grace spent every morning in the shop, usually starting early.But in the afternoons she had other tasks.She was trying to get the house out on the beach ready for her mother.Shed bought the house from Cooperit was one of three spec houses hed built and it was perfect for her needs.Graces mother had ALS and was using a wheelchair most of the time now.Grace wanted her nearbyit was uncertain how much time the incurable condition would give her.Grace made daily runs to the house to prod the workers and spent the rest of the time rounding up furnishings.Almost every day after school and on weekends, her fianc, Troy, was pitching in at the house, trying to finish up.In what Ginger learned was typical of Thunder Point, Troys friends were always lending a hand.Together the newly engaged couple put up drywall, textured, sanded, installed molding and painted, trying to get the entire house done before Winnie arrived, or at least to leave just a few decorating details on the upper and lower floors.Troy and Grace planned to move into the lower level because between the two of them and their tiny apartments, there was no space for a baby.The lower floor with two bedrooms, a large bathroom and a game room was perfect for them.Yes, it seems like half the town is pregnant, though its only the three of themGrace, Peyton and Iris, Ginger told her mother during one of their phone calls.In fact, their due dates are so close together it makes one wonder if there was a blackout or bad storm during one particular week in early April.Maybe it was just spring, Sue said.It was a beautiful spring.There was something about the feeling of rebirth that lent itself to Gingers desire for a fresh start, a new beginning.And one thing she now knew for certain, she couldnt make it in that bedroom in her parents house where she had lived when her baby died.Just that brief visit when she went with Grace to attend Peytons wedding had made it glaringly obvious.It was time for her to move on.She hoped Ray Anne wasnt feeling crowded in her small house.Given a little more time to get her finances in order shed look around for an apartment or something.The woman never complained and seemed to genuinely enjoy Gingers company, but Ray Anne had Al, her boyfriend, and Al had three foster sons at home.She was aware that time alone for the two of them was hard to find since Ginger had come to town.Late afternoon was Gingers favorite time, now that the days were longer and the weather milder.The middle of May was kind to the oceanside residents.Storms blew up at night sometimes but the afternoons were generally warm and sunny.Wildflowers bloomed on the hillsides that framed the town and bay.When Ginger was pulling in the shops sidewalk displays, people would stop to talk.Sometimes someone would insist on lending a hand.Waylan, a grizzly old coot who owned the bar across the street, had taken to her and she believed he watched for her to start her closing time ritual so he could at least come pass the time.Al seemed to be mysteriously available as well, right when a strong arm would come in handy.Lou Metcalf often stopped by before heading out of town after her day teaching at the middle school.Lou was a close friend of Ray Annes and had twice invited Ginger for a cup of coffee at the diner.And it was usually right about the time Ray Anne was quitting for the day and would drive that little BMW of hers to the flower shop to talk about dinner.Would they stay in, just the two of them?Go out?Get something from Carrie?Cook?Have Al to dinner?Should it be every man for himself tonight?But as she pulled in the big wooden Mothers Day tulip, she saw a man walking down the street who looked vaguely familiar.Her brow wrinkled as she studied him.Where had she seen him?He was tall and handsome, she could see that much from a block away.Black hair, broad shoulders, jeans and boots, the common wardrobe around town, but a crisply pressed cotton shirt, sleeves rolled up to expose strong forearms and big hands.As he got closer she could see the jeans were in very well preserved conditionthis guy had not just stepped off a fishing boat.His hair, brows and eyes were black and he sported a slight, whiskery beard, a day or twos worth.The moment she found herself thinking he was heart stoppingly sexy in a very exotic way she also realized who he was.Oh, my God, its Peytons brother!By then he was upon her and gave her a slightly shy but brilliant smile.Complete with dimples.He nodded his head, almost a bow.Miss Dysart...Ginger...I came to apologize.She actually took a step back.Um.Okay, she said a little nervously.You came all the way from Portland?I came to see my sister, he said.And to apologize to you.To explain.I can explain.Water over the dam, she said.You dont have to explain...I was drunk, he said, as if he hadnt heard her.Stinko.I dont get drunk and I dont like drunks.I got married in that same orchard a while ago and the marriage didnt take.Ive been divorced over a year and it was bitter.Im either going to stop going to those weddings or stop drinking.But I guess all the Lacoumettes are married now.If they have better luck than I did, we should be all right.Im sure Peyton understood, she said.He gave a bark of laughter.Shes my sister.Shes going to make me pay for a long time.I didnt hurt you or anything, did I?Because I remember reaching for you.I think I was going to drag you onto the dance floor.Im a clod.You groped me, she said.You said your intentions were to drag me to the hayloft but you missed my arm and got my...She stopped.But he understood.Oh, Jesus, he said, hanging his head slightly.What an ass.No damage done, she said.Apology accepted.Listen, can I take you to dinner?To make amends?he asked.Not necessary, Matt.It is Matt, right?Matt Lacoumette, he said, sticking out a hand.I know its not necessary, but it would make me feel better if I could do something for you.Peyton says youre one of the nicest women in town.Ginger tilted her head and her eyes rounded in surprise.And right then she heard the beep of Ray Annes horn as she pulled up in front of the shop.Ginger still wore her green work apron.Ray Anne stood just outside her closed car door, the motor still running.Quitting time?she asked.Almost, Ginger said.Ray Anne, this is Peytons brother Matt.Matt, this is my dads cousin Ray Anne.Ive been staying with her in Thunder Point.Its a pleasure, he said.I just invited Ginger to dinner and Id be happy if you joined us.Oh, you sweet boy, Ray Anne said.I just stopped by to tell Ginger I have plans for the evening, so you two go ahead.Ginger, Ill see you a little later, honey.She slipped back into her BMW and disappeared down the street.Ginger looked back at Matt.As it happens, its been a really long day, she said.Ive been thinking about a quiet evening at home tonight.I promise not to keep you out late.We can walk down to Cliffhangers or I can drive.Ive only eaten there once before, but it was excellent.And probably the best way to get rid of me is to accept, let me make my amends, and then Ill go back to the farm and leave you alone.Matt...Ill behave very well.Of course you will, but...Im kind of a pest until Ive had a chance to apologize properly.Because, really That damn Ray Anneshe doesnt have plans, Ginger blurted.At least she didnt until you invited her to dinner and then she got an idea that she could be sure I went and Im really not keen on the idea.And I dont buy that you have to make amends over dinner or you wont sleep at night.Okay, youre right.Its not just amends.I really want to convince you Im not a total asshole.I know how to treat women and I dont do...He shook his head.I dont do the things I did.Paco had his ways of training us in manners.In respect.Respect is very important in our family.I was disrespectful to you, to the bride and groom, to everyone.Paco has been reminding me daily.That made her smile in spite of herself.She raised one brow.Ice water?He grinned.And really, it was a convincing grin.As handsome as he was, it was boyish.Whatever is at hand, Matt said.Can I pick you up or would you like to walk down to Cliffs with me?I think Id like to go home and change.Im just closing now.Give me an hour?Ill meet you there.Can I help you move this stuff inside?he asked.Yes, she said.Yes, you can.* * * Matt had pulled that off perfectly while giving the impression dinner had been part of his plan from the start.It hadnt been.The truth was he didnt remember Ginger very well.Big surprise, since he had been completely toasted.All he really remembered was a blonde in a purple dress.In fact, he remembered the dress better than the blonde in it.Then when he saw her in jeans, green florists apron, simple knit shirt, so pretty, freckled, looking fresh as a schoolgirl, he was stung.He saw that she wasnt really blonde blonde.There was a little red in that hair streaked with gold and it looked so soft.And those green eyes sparkled in the afternoon sun.She didnt wear much makeupher cheeks were a peachy pink and her lips shiny.She had a fine arch to her light brows.And green stains on her fingers.At dinner, he would ask what it was like working with flowers.When he got back to Peyton and Scotts house, Peyton was spreading butter on a French baguette for garlic bread.There was red sauce bubbling on the stove and two empty Ragu jars on the counter.Peyton was not the cook his mother was.Im going out for dinner, he told his sister.Sorry its so last minuteI hope that doesnt spoil everything you have planned.Out?she asked.I went to see Ginger.I apologized and I asked her to dinner to make amends.Just here in town.That restaurant at the marina.Dinner?she said.I thought it was the polite thing to do.Listen, Matt, she said, putting down the spreader.Go easy on her, okay?Shes a sweet girl but shes coming off some hard times.Im sure she can take care of herself, but I dont think shes ready for a wolf.Wolf?Me?Yeah, you, she said.I know what youve been doing the last year and change.Chasing women, running through them fast, moving at warp speed...Thats ridiculous, he said.Ive been getting up at four and having dinner at the farm most nights.Dating hasnt been a priority at all.In fact, I mostly avoid women.Whatever, she said, picking up the spreader.But she was right.Thats why he kept the apartment he hated, to have a little privacy.Hed been whoring around since the day his divorce was final and he wasnt sure why.Oh, he had a healthy libido, he knew that.He came by it honestlyhis people were like that.But it was possible he was trying to change the taste Natalie left in his mouth.He might also get a little satisfaction from thinking it would make her unhappy if she knew, but then he never prowled around in her territory.Or maybe he just wanted to prove to himself that he could get along fine without a steady relationship because taking a chance on another marriage was out of the question.And sometimes when he had a woman under him, he forgot.After what hed been through with Natalie, he didnt even feel guilty.He did have the courtesy to warn them, however.He was temporary at best.It was amazing how many women were of a like mind.Come on, my hours are too long and dirty for women, he told his sister.Right, she said.Be nice to Ginger or youll be answering to me.You dont want to be answering to her, Scott said from somewhere.Shes relentless.She forgets nothing!Matt looked around.Where is he?Under the table, she said.In the fort.He heard giggling, and Matt went to the dining room table, which was covered with blankets.He pulled aside the flap and there were Scott and his kids, Will and Jenny.You are a strange, strange man.Arent you a little big for this?Were all getting a little big for this, Scott said.Come on, you guys, Peyton said.I told you to put the fort away so we can eat at the table.Im not leaving for a little while.Want me to make you some bruschetta?Matt asked.She smiled.That would be nice.You can have half of this baguette.It was his peace offering to Peyton, his favorite sister, and he had four to choose from.Matt didnt need to be reminded that no one got away with anything with Peyton, nor that she was relentless and had the memory of an elephant.He grew up in that house, after all.Ginny was too bossy, Ellie was too critical and Adele was too much like him.But Peyton, several years older than Matt, had always seemed wise and he loved her independence, her strength.But she happened to be closest to George and Adele.And young Mike, who was getting his postgrad degree, worshipped Matt.Ginny, who got on Matts last nerve, adored and pampered him and called him Mattie.And so it went in big families.Feuds, alliances, shared failures, victories, spats, celebrations and reconciliations.But they were family and Matt would go balls to the wall for any one of them.After supplying the bruschetta, he chose to walk down to the marina.Though it was Friday night, crowded and the closest thing to fine dining Thunder Point had to offer, at least half the people present were dressed as casually as he was.He took a seat at the bar, ordered a beer and asked if he could get a table for two in about fifteen minutes.The man behind the bar said it was no problem.It was only five minutes later that Ginger walked in, also early.And if possible, prettier than before.She looked a little fresher, like shed fluffed her hair and wet her lips.Shed changed clothes.Still jeans, but this time with a jacket and boots with heels instead of clogs.He stood and smiled at her and checked her hands.They werent green.He waved her over.Were ready whenever you are, Matt said to the guy behind the bar.Hey, Ginger, the man said.Hey, Cliff.Hows life?Always good.Always.This a friend of yours?This is Peyton Grants brother Matt.Matt, this is Cliff.This is his restaurant.After a little chat, mostly from Cliff about how grateful they all were that Peyton worked with Scott and that Scott had had the wisdom to marry her, though probably not for the sake of the town, he took them to a table in the dining room.He bragged a little about the lobster bisque, said anything on the menu with crab was outstanding and that there was mahimahi on the specials tonight.Rampresumably the chefdidnt fry too much, he recommended the blackened salmon or Cajun ahi.Then they were alone.I see you got the green stains off your hands, Matt said, smiling, making her laugh.Flowers are dirty work, she said.Tell me about dirty.Im in fruit.And potatoes.And sometimes sheep.Sometimes?I work with Paco on the farm and George, my oldest brother, he has the sheep end of the business.When its time to shear or breed or anything real busy, I help.Everyone helps.And Uncle Sal has the vineyardwe go to the wine harvest on and off between August and the end of September, the same time were bringing in the pears.The whole extended family is running around the stategrapes here, sheep there, pears and potatoes.That orchard, she said.One of the most beautiful places on earth.Cliff brought a glass of wine for Ginger, and they both ordered the same thingCajun ahi.Theres a small butcher shop in Portland where you can get ahi steaks.They cost the moon but you can eat them with a spoon, theyre that fresh and good.Portland?You live in Portland?he asked.Its where Im from.I live here now.I really hope it works out and that I can stay.At least for a long time.I love the town, the shop.Tell me about flowers, he said.What can I tell you?I work for Grace, who owns the shop.Ive only been there a short time but Im learning to make very nice displaysbouquets, centerpieces, wreaths, wall hangings.I love it when she gets an order from a big hotel or resort and we do something huge, like an underwater obsidian stem in a tall cylinder glass vase.Its more of a sculpture than an arrangement.Howd you know you wanted to do that?he asked.I didnt, Ginger said.I was visiting with Ray Anne, just sitting around completely unmotivated while she went to work, and she told me I had to do something, no matter how small it was.That very day Grace asked me if Id consider her shop.She was in desperate need of help and I had absolutely no experience.Honestly, I took it because it was there.I had no idea Id like it.I shouldnt be surprisedI like all those sorts of things.What sorts of things?he asked.She laughed a little uncomfortably and looked down at her hands.For lack of a better description, girl things.Ive worked in retail, in clothing, in housewares, in domestics.Im the youngest of three with two older brothers and am the only member of the family who doesnt work in the family business, my dads trucking company.Small but pretty successful.My dad runs it, my oldest brother is the comptroller, my other brother is operations VP and my mother has been the dispatcher and scheduler since he had one truck.And I, the baby of the family and a girl, never found my niche.Ive taken some college courses, never found a degree program.But boy, can I organize the house!And I know how to change the oil in the car, landscape the yard, bake a souffl, hang wallpaper.The joke around the family is that since my mother has always been at the company, working with Dad, I am the only housewife in the family.Landscape?Ever have a garden?I rented a small house and planted flowers around the border.Youd like my mothers garden, he said.I saw your mothers garden.A small farm!Looking at it made me hungry!We grow things for a living, he said with a smile.What was your last job before coming here?he asked.I worked in a department store in the bridal registries.But I needed a change.Then it came to him suddenly.Jesus, what a dunce!Dysart Trucking!Thats right, she said.Youve heard of them?He grinned.We use them, Ginger.They take our crops to market.Theyre a good size company.Locally, she said.My dad started with one truck.My grandfather started with a small grove and a few sheep and a lot of debt, but every time he had two nickels to rub together he bought more land.He invested in himself, she said.He invested in his sons.My dad has the grove and sheep and potatoes, Uncle Sal has grapes, Andreas has a couple of fishing boats.As you no doubt noticed, theres quite a lot of family.Then his phone vibrated in his pocket.He pulled it out and looked at it, sent the caller to voice mail, put it back in his pocket.Lucy.Theyd gone out a few times.Shed like to go out a few more.Time to move on.I dont mind if you take that call.Thats okay, Ill call back.So, everyone works in the trucking company...Except me.Im willing to help out but I dont have any talent for it, except maybe washing rigs.She laughed.Im very good at all the things people dont get paid much forcooking and cleaning, that sort of thing.I suppose when my parents are very old and infirm and Im an old maid, Ill be the one to take care of them.And all your family is involved in the farm?No, only a couple of us.Peyton is here, Ginny and Ellie are homemakers and their husbands are not farmers, Mike will be a professor married to a professor, Sal is a CPA for a large winemaker in Napa.Hed like to buy a vineyard someday.I guess, named for Uncle Sal, it makes perfect sense.Hes good with numbers and has a very good nose.Theyre all pretty successful.My parents pushed us hard.Through dinner they talked about their families, some of their childhood experiences, what movies and books they liked.He told her he was a part time teacher and she told him about her three best friends from high school and how theyd all left Portland for big careers.He made her laugh and he was mesmerized by her sweetness and charm.They had a cup of coffee but neither wanted dessert.Two hours had flown by.She told him that as apology dinners go, this was the best shed ever had.So, he said, what is it you like so much about this little town?Why do you want to stay?The people have been so lovely.And that flower shopits perfect for me.Im around people sometimes but I spend a lot of time alone, making up arrangements, cleaning up the cooler and back room.I need that timetime to think.But I shouldnt have too much time or I get caught brooding.And what does a pretty girl like you have to brood about?he asked, flashing his dimples.Peyton didnt tell you anything about me?Come to think of it, she told me youd had a bad year and made me promise I wouldnt be a wolf.Well, we have maybe a couple of things in common.Im also divorced.Just over a year.Is that so?Ill tell you mine if you tell me yours?You first, she said.Its not that interesting, he said.Everything Natalie and I talked about for the year leading up to our wedding, we agreed on.Immediately following the wedding, she was unhappy.She didnt want to be married to a farmer, I got up too early, went to bed too early, had dirt under my nails, shit on my boots.She wanted me to go to med school or get a PhD and teach.She wanted fancy cocktail parties rather than big hoedowns at the farm.She was intimidated by the sheer size of my family.So we fought, and fought and fought.Wed married the wrong people.It was a damn shame, but there it is.He shrugged.See?Not interesting.Make yours at least interesting.She took a breath.She twirled the coffee cup around on the saucer.Maybe I shouldnt...You dont have to, he said.I married the wrong person, too.I married a musician.A singer/songwriter with the voice of an angel.The first time I heard him sing was in Portland at a fair and he sang I Guess The Lord Must Be In New York City.My bones melted and I fell right in love with him.I was youngtwenty one.He was older and had been trying to make a breakthrough in the music business for a long time.He traveled a lot but when he was in the Pacific Northwest, which he called home, wed see each other.After a couple of years of that he suggested we live together, though he would continue to travel for every gig or business opportunity.He moved all his things into my little rented house.That went pretty well for a while.In fact, there were times it was a lot of funlots of musicians around, lots of music, a real party.We got married and he sang to me at our wedding.He also notified the newspapers and had a couple of photographers there.He was going to be the next Eric Clapton.I worked in a department store and he made a pittance on his gigs, barely enough to keep him in equipment and plane tickets.He did sell five songs to a big country star, they just never made the charts.Thats when I started to realize what a mistake Id madehe made a hundred thousand dollars and bought all new equipment.It was all about him.The big break that would set him up for life was always right around the corner.But of course marriage didnt work.He didnt want to be a husband.His music came first.He said, I told you, GingerI have to concentrate on my music and I thought you were on board with that.Matt gulped.Had he put the farm ahead of his wife?Would everything have been different if hed given her ideas a try?Im sorry, Ginger.Well, time to move on, right?she said.She was obviously trying to brighten up.He thought the pain of divorce must be much fresher for her.His phone vibrated and he looked.Lucy again.Hed call her later and explain he wasnt in Portland and shed have to find someone else for the night.He put the phone back in his pocket.Really, its okay...Just my kid brother, he lied.Ill call him back.What if its an emergency?she asked.If it was an emergency, Id hear from Paco and Peyton and Id answer for them because it would obviously be important.He probably has a work related question.Hes working on a biochem degree.Hes researching.Wow.You really do have an impressive family.He laughed.So do you, Ginger.He walked her to her car.She told him again that it was the best apology dinner shed ever had.With my sister living here, well see each other again.I can always apologize again.You really dont have to, she said with a laugh.Would you like a ride home?No thanks.I like to walk, especially at night.All right.Have a good visit then.She put out her hand.He pulled on that hand gently and kissed her cheek.Thanks.Take care.And he walked off into the night.When he got back to Peytons house, it was kind of dark.Theyd left the outside porch light on for him and when he went inside he found Dr.and Mrs.Grant were curled up together watching a movie.Peyton instantly put the movie on pause, flicked on the table lamp and sat up straight.Youre back, she said.Im back.Did you have a nice dinner?I had a very nice dinner, Matt said.Have you ever tried the Cajun ahi at Cliffs?Because its really good.I meant with Ginger!Did you realize that shes Ginger Dysart of Dysart Trucking?Whos that?The trucking company we use to take our crops to market.The company we rent our flatbeds from to take Christmas trees to market.Huh.I didnt realize.You couldve told me she was recovering from a divorce, just like me.I mightve understood why you were acting so protective of her.Well, it was a bit more than that.She told you about the baby?What baby?Peyton sighed as if trapped.Well, everyone knows.Its been easier for her, really, since everyone knows and no one asks.She got pregnant and her husband left her, I dont know the details.She said he didnt want children.He wanted to devote his time to his career.So he left her.Wheres the baby?Matt asked with a sinking feeling.She moved back with her parents, had her baby as a single mother, and he died of SIDS at four months.That was almost a year ago.Shes just coming back to life.Matt thought he might throw up.God.Shes doing well now, considering.But you can see why I didnt want you to be your tomcat self around her.For the last time, Im not a tomcat, he said.But he was.And he was damn lucky he hadnt offended Ginger for the second time because he found her very attractive.Very desirable.But now, knowing what he knew, he was going to get out of town and get back to Portland tomorrow.Hed make some excuse.He wasnt staying the weekend, after all.A New Hope        Three Grace walked around the great room of the new house.It was freshly painted.She hoped her mother would approve of the colors shed chosenivory with dark brown accents in the great room.Taupe with just a touch of mauve in it, dark accents, ivory ceiling in the master bedroom.It was restful, she thought.On Monday they would install the kitchen cupboards and light fixtures and continue work on the shower in the master bath.The thing she thought was the smartest and most practicala curved glass cinder block wall rather than a shower door for accessibility and also for the elegant designthat was taking the longest.Workers had spent days on that one small project.Troy was taking advantage of a warm sunny Saturday with only a light breeze rather than strong winds off the Pacific to seal the deck and steps to the beach.The sealer dried so quickly he was already on the second coat and it was early in the afternoon.Sealer had been sprayed on the underside of the deck before Troy brushed on the topside.Spencer, their next door neighbor and Troys colleague at the high school, was at work on the stepsfourteen from the deck to the lower level, fourteen from the lower level to the beach.The main level of the houses was thirty feet above the beach.She found herself standing just inside the great room doors watching Troy.His jeans were ripped at the knees and he wore a T shirt with the sleeves torn off, exposing those biceps and forearms she loved so much.The jeans fit perfectly on his booty.He wore a cap to cut down on the glare, but he yanked it off regularly to wipe the sweat from his brow.He was just as sexy sweaty as he was all primped up.He caught her staring and shot her that dazzling smile of his.What are you looking at, little mama?Dinner, I think.And then she bit her lip.There would be enough to do to keep them busy for quite a while, but she thought she could get her mother in the house in two weeks.And she suspected that her former skating coach, Mikhail, would be staying with them for some time.He had said, I will come to this place if you could secure a little room in a cheap hotel.Just a bed is all I needI despise to sleep on the floor.Someone should help get her settled.Winnie can be difficult.Then I will leave.Difficult?She could be a nightmare!But Winnie was ill now, losing her physical stamina, failing as ALS took over and the fatigue she suffered from made her more docile.It was true she had always listened to Mikhail.And Mikhail had said he was coming for two or three days and hed been there over a month already.Shed better get that second upstairs bedroom and bath finished for him.She had a feeling Mikhail planned to stay much longer than he let on.There was an affection between Mikhail and Winnie that Grace couldnt really identify.Not romance, certainly.Friendship, but more than the usual friendship.Partnership.Mikhail had been Graces coach for years, from the time she was fourteen until she was in her early twenties and quit competing, and through all that time he had stayed close to both Grace and Winnie.Virginia, Winnies assistant, would stay in her position until that big albatross of a house in San Francisco was closed and all the possessions were dealt with.There were a few pictures Grace wanted for this house, but the rest of her mothers art was going to a fine art museum on long term loanit would be displayed as The Banks Collection.With the help of the now part time housekeeper, some things were being packed and shipped to Thunder Pointjust a few treasured pieces of furniture, some dishes, kitchenware, her mothers precious bedroom rug, a valuable Aubusson.Then there would be an estate salethe furs and most of the jewelry would be included.Grace would have to make a couple of quick trips to look through thingsthere were undoubtedly photo albums, books, mementos and keepsakes that should be preserved.Virginia was looking for a roomy flat in the city where she could live and work until the estate was settled.Then Grace just might ask her if she wanted to continue to manage the estate after Winnie was gone.Meanwhile, that handsome history teacher on the deck was trying to get a binding pre nup.He wasnt looking for half, he was looking for nothing.He never wanted it even suggested that he was interested in Graces legacy.That would be the money she would inherit because as of now she had a flower shop and about a years income in the bank, cautiously invested.Troy had been intimidated by Winnies house and furnishings.If he ever saw the actual bottom line, the net worth, he might stroke out.Oh, they were going to make interesting neighbors.A teacher and flower shop owner, now expecting.A diva with ALS who would probably sit on the deck in a wheelchair wearing furs and diamonds.Full time nursing help.And a little Russian coach who liked raisins in his wodka.Troy!she called.I think Im going to do a little painting in the loft.He straightened and pulled off his cap.You paint nothing!There are fumes.You can sweep.Or go arrange flowers.Or call your mother and tell her how helpful I am.She already likes you more than she likes me, she muttered.As it should be, he said.Wow.
