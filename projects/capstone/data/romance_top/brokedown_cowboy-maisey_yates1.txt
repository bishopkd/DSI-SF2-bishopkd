CONNOR GARRETT WAS a grown ass man.He knew there was nothing to fear in sleep.He knew the darkness of his room didnt hide anything more sinister than a pair of carelessly discarded cowboy boots, waiting for him to stub his toe on them in the dead of night during a sleepy trip to the bathroom.He knew these things, just like he knew the sun would rise over the mountains just before six this time of year, whether he wanted it to or not.He knew these things as surely as he knew that an early morning breeze tinged with salt meant a storm would blow in from the coast later.That unintentional run ins with barbed wire fences burned like a son of a bitch.That wooden barns burned and people you loved left.Yeah, he knew all that.But it didnt stop him from waking up most nights in a cold sweat, his heart pounding harder than a spooked horses hooves on arena dirt.Because the simple truth was that Connor Garrett knew all these things, but his subconscious had yet to catch up.He sat bolt upright in bed, sweat beading on his bare chest and his forehead.If this werent standard procedure for his body, he mightve been concerned he was having a heart attack.Unfortunately, though, he knew at this point that the racing heart, accompanied by chest pain, was just stress.Anxiety.Damn lingering grief that refused to lessen even as the years passed.He wasnt surprised when he woke up alone in bed, not anymore.It had been three years, after all.He wasnt surprised, but he noticed.Every time.Was acutely aware of how cold the sheets were on her side of the bed.It wasnt even the same bed hed slept in with Jessie.Hed bought a new one about a year ago because continuing to sleep in the bed theyd shared had seemed too depressing.But it hadnt accomplished what he had hoped it might.Because no matter how hard he tried, whether he lay down in the middle of the bed at the start of the night, or even on the side nearest to the window, he always ended up on his side.The side by the door.In case of intruders or any other danger.The side that allowed him to protect the person sleeping next to him.The side he had taken every night during his eight years of marriage.It was as if his late wifes ghost was rolling him over in his sleep.And then waking him up.Unfortunately, Jessie didnt even have the decency to haunt him.She was just gone.And in her place was emptiness.Emptiness in his bed.In his house.In his chest.And when his chest wasnt empty, it was filled with pain and a kind of dread that took over his whole body and made it impossible to breathe.Like now.He swung his legs over the side of the mattress, the wood floor cold beneath his bare feet.He stood and walked over to the window, looked out into the darkness.The black shadows of pine trees filled his vision, and beyond that, the darker silhouette of the mountains, backlit by a slightly grayer sky.And down to the left he could barely make out the front porch.And the golden glow of the porch light that hed somehow managed to leave on before hed gone to sleep.His chest tightened.That was probably why hed woken up.Abruptly, the dream hed been having flooded back through his mind.It hadnt been a full dream so much as images.Opening the door late at night to see Eli standing there, his brothers face grim, bleaker than Connor had ever seen it.And a ring of gold light from the porch had shone around him.Made him look like an angel of some kind.An angel of death, it had turned out.As stupid as it was, he was half convinced that leaving that same light on downstairs brought the dreams back stronger.It didnt make sense.But if there was one thing hed learned over the years, it was that grief didnt make a lick of sense.He jerked the bedroom door open and walked downstairs, heading toward the entryway.He stood there in front of the door, looking at the porch light shining through the windows.For a second he had the thought that if he opened it, he would find Eli standing there.Would find himself transported back in time three years.Listening to the kind of news that no one should have to hear.There was a reason his darkest nightmares consisted of nothing more than his younger brother standing on his front porch.Because in that moment his life had transformed into a nightmare.There was nothing scarier than that.He was confident he could take the bogeyman if need be.But he couldnt fight death.And in the end he hadnt been able to save Jessie.And he was not opening the damn door.He flipped the light off and found himself walking into the kitchen and opening the fridge, rather than going back upstairs.He looked at the beer, which was currently the only thing on the shelves besides a bottle of ketchup and a bag that had an onion in it that had probably been there since the beginning of summer.He let out a heavy sigh and shut the fridge.He should not drink beer at three in the morning.Three in the morning was clearly Jack Daniels oclock.He walked over to the cabinet where he kept the harder stuff and pulled out his bottle of Jack.It was almost gone.And no one was here.No one was here, because his fucking house was empty.Because he was alone.Considering those things, he decided to hell with the glass.He picked up the bottle and tipped it back, barely even feeling the burn anymore as the alcohol slid down his throat.Maybe now he would be able to get some sleep.Maybe for a few hours he could forget.Hed given up on getting rest years ago.These days he just settled for oblivion.And this was the fastest way he knew to get it.* * * YOU SHOULD JUST INSTALL a drain in the house so you can hose it down and let all the dirt wash out.Just like you do out in the barn.What the hell are you doing here, Liss?Felicity Foster refused to be cowed by the overwhelmingly unfriendly greeting her best friend had just issued.It was just Connor, after all.She was used to his less than sparkly demeanor.She was also used to finding him passed out on the couch in the morning.It would be nice if that occurred less frequently, but if anything, he seemed to be getting worse.Not that she could blame him.She blamed his barn burning down.As far as the loss of Jessie was concerned, things might have continued to get better had he not lost that, too.It was just a building, bricks and wood, but it was his livelihood.It was just another piece of Connors dream burned down to the ground.Hed had enough of that.Too much of it.She was officially pissed at life on his behalf.How much was one man supposed to endure?And to answer your rather charming question, Connor, she said, stepping nearer to the couch, I brought you groceries.He sat up, his face contorting, making him look a bit like hed swallowed a porcupine.Groceries?Why did you do that?I know its been a while since youve gone out and socialized with actual people, rather than simply sharing your space with cows, so I feel compelled to remind you that the normal human response to this would be thank you.He swung his legs over the side of the couch and rubbed his hand over his face.She wanted to do something.To put her hand on his back and offer comfort.She was used to those kinds of impulses around Connor.Shed been fighting them for the better part of her adult life.But her conclusion was always that touching him would be a bad idea.So she stood there, her hands held awkwardly at her sides, leaving him uncomforted.Leaving the appropriate amount of space between them.That was part of being a good friend.At least, it was part of maintaining a healthy friendship as far as she and Connor were concerned.Thank you, he said, his voice gruff.But why the hell did you bring me groceries?And why did you bring them by before work?I brought you groceries because man cannot live on booze alone.Im bringing them this morning because I was too tired to lug them over last night, when I actually bought them.So I thought, in the spirit of goodwill and breakfast cereals, I would bring them by now.I do like breakfast cereals.Im ambivalent about goodwill.He stood up, wobbling slightly.Feeling a little bit ambivalent about gravity, too.Im surprised you feel like eating.How much did you drink?He looked away from her and shrugged in a classically Connor manner.Playing things off was an art form with this man.I dont know.I woke up in the middle of the night.I couldnt get back to sleep so I had a little bit to drink and ended up staying down here.Anyway, I dont really notice the hangovers anymore.I dont think building up a resistance to hangovers is a crowning achievement.For my lifestyle, it certainly is.She rolled her eyes.Come on, cowboy.Ill pour you some cereal.She shouldnt offer to do things like that for him.She knew it.But she did it anyway.Just like she brought his groceries when she knew his fridge contained nothing but beer.Just like she still came to his house every day to make sure he was taken care of.Whoa, wait a second, Liss.We do not know each other well enough for that shit.Ive known you since I was fifteen.The preparation of cereal is a highly contentious thing.You dont know how much milk I might want.Hell, I dont know how much milk I might want until I assess the density and quality of the cereal.Are you still drunk?Probably a little bit.Kitchen.Now.Connor offered her a smart ass smile, one side of his mouth curving upward.She couldnt help but watch him as he walked from the living room into the kitchen.His dark hair was longer than he used to keep it, a beard now covering his once clean shaven jaw.She didnt mind the look.Actually, didnt mind was an understatement; she thought he looked dead sexy.Though, in her opinion, there was no look Connor had ever sported that shed found less than sexy.Even that terrible haircut, gelled and spiked up, that hed had for about a year in high school, his one and only attempt at trendiness.No, on that score, the beard and hair were fine.The real issue was that his mountain man look wasnt a fashion statement, but an outward sign of the fact that he just didnt take care of himself anymore.They walked into the kitchen, and with the sun shining through the window like it was now, she could clearly see the coat of neglect that everything wore.The stove had a grease film over the top of it, a shocking amount of splatters on the white surface considering that she knew Connor never cooked anything here beyond frozen pizza.The pine cabinets looked dingy, the front window dotted with a white film of hard water stains.The house didnt wear its neglect with quite the same devilish flare its owner did.Connor reached up and opened one of the cabinets, taking out one of the brightly colored boxes of cereal she had just placed there.It struck her, in that moment, how funny it was she had known exactly where to put the cereal, and that he had known she would.He grabbed a bowl and placed it on the counter, turning to face her, and she realized then that Connor wasnt wearing his neglect quite as well as he would like everyone to believe.Sure, he was still sexy as hell, the tight lines by his eyes, the deep grooves in his forehead not doing anything to diminish that.But they were new.A map of the stress and grief of the past few years, deepened by his recent losses.She ached for him.But beyond buying the mans food, there was very little she could do.She had been about to unload on him about all the crap that was happening with her rental.But it wasnt a good time.Though she doubted with Connor there was ever a good time.Not because he wouldnt care, but because she didnt want to pile on.Connor poured milk on his cereal, milk she had brought, and set it back on the counter.He picked up his bowl and started eating, crunching loudly on his first bite.Are you going to have some, Liss?I never say no to cereal.I have important accounting stuff to attend to.I find an early morning carb rush is the best way to handle that.Coffee?he asked, talking around the food in his mouth.I had a carafe before I came over.I dont play around with caffeine consumption.Well, I need some.He set the bowl back down on the counter and made his way over to the coffeemaker.So you had coffee.Beer, and coffee.Im not an animal.Liss snickered while she got her own bowl and set about preparing her cereal.There was a strange domesticity to the scene.Mundane conversation, easy morning sounds.Water running in the sink, clattering dishes.The soft filter of early sunlight through the thick wall of evergreens that surrounded Connors front yard.There was something poignant about sharing this with him.This moment that seemed to have slipped right out of time.Like something shed stolen, something she shouldnt have.Seriously, you would think she was the one who had been drinking.She was maudlin.Connor started the coffee then returned to the island where hed prepared his cereal.They stood across from each other, eating in silence, except for the crunching.And the sounds of the coffeemaker.More morning sounds she was not entitled to.Because this was the kind of thing a guy shared with his lover or wife.Not with his oddly codependent best friend.Have you heard back from the insurance company about the settlement?The barn had burned down in July thanks to a few kids carelessly playing with fireworks, and while Liss knew that insurance companies could drag their feet to a pretty insane degree, this was going somewhere beyond that.It was mid September, and as far as she knew, Connors bank account remained void of settlements.Nope.Well, thats a little bit ridiculous, dont you think?He shrugged one shoulder then took another bite of cereal.Probably.Just havent had the energy to go chasing it down.Dont you think you should find the energy?All that equipment...Im very aware of what I lost in the fire.I dont need you to summarize.Anyway, Ive been making use of Buds old tractor.Plus, Jack had some extra tools.Thats very nice.But dont you want your own things?Yes, Liss, he said, his tone getting hard.I would very much like to have my own shit.Actually, what I would really like is for my barn not to have burned down.Connor Garrett was six feet four inches of solid muscle.When he crossed his arms over his chest, showing off the strength in his powerful forearms and the full sleeve tattoo hed gotten a couple of years ago, he made a very intimidating picture.To other people.But not to her.Too bad its not a perfect world, isnt it?Connor snorted.Yeah, Liss, I have noticed that the world isnt perfect.Noticing it isnt enough.You have to do something about it.I was not aware that my cereal came with a lecture.It wasnt supposed to.I have to go to work.She set her bowl down on the counter then turned away from him, shoving her hands in her jacket pockets.Wait.She heard footsteps, and no small amount of rustling behind her.She turned back toward Connor, who was pouring coffee into a travel mug.Im waiting.She watched as he put two spoonfuls of sugar and a splash of cream in the cup.Exactly the way she took her coffee.And of course he knew.Coffee.Youre allowed to leave mad, but youre not allowed to leave without caffeine.She took the cup from his hand, holding her breath as her fingers brushed his, tightening her stomach muscles before they could do so involuntarily.Thus ensuring that I dont leave mad.She lifted the cup.Evil genius, Garrett.I am that, Foster.As you should well know by now.Im familiar.Poker tonight?As far as I know.Eli has campaign stuff hes working on, so Im not sure if hell stop by, but Im pretty sure Sadie is coming.And unless Jack is getting laid with some random stranger...Oh, Jack.Its a real concern with that one.Jack Monaghan was Connors other best friend.Between Eli and Connor in age, hed been terrorizing Copper Ridge with the Garretts since the three of them were adolescent boys.And he had grown up to be a bigger terror than hed been at twelve.Unlike Eli, who was staid and responsible, running for sheriff of Logan County and in a serious, committed relationship with onetime bad girl Sadie Miller.And unlike Connor, who had gotten married in his early twenties and settled into ranch work.Jack had never settled into much of anything.Except sleeping his way through the female population, and steadfastly refusing to grow up by opting for a career as a rodeo cowboy.Jack was hell on cowboy boots, but he was a lot of fun to have around.So long as you werent counting on him for much.Yeah, well, one of us should go out there and get some.Liss resisted the urge to ask for any details regarding Connor and his getting some status.She was willing to bet he wasnt, but then, it wasnt like he told her everything.And Connors sex life was absolutely none of her business.In fact, she had spent the better part of the past seventeen years ignoring the fact that he had a sex life.Or at least trying to.Im happy for Jack to be the getting some ambassador.Down with relationships!Connor chuckled.I dont think Jack orders his sex with a side of relationship.Hes a better man than I am, Liss said.Yeah, me, too.Well, that might answer her question.The one she wasnt going to ask.The one she certainly wasnt going to dwell on.Though she was dwelling a little bit.Okay, Connor, I really have to go now.Thank you for the coffee.Thank you for the cereal.And the other things.My unending friendship, my support, my willingness to give you the hard truths?I meant the milk and the half and half.But sure.She shot Connor a mock dirty glare and gave him a good look at her middle finger before turning and walking out the door.The crisp air touched her skin, bathing her in a feeling of freshness.The weather had already cooled quite a bit, and mornings were starting to take on that tinge of salted frost that signaled the fact they were leaving summer further and further behind.She walked down the stairs and toward her little Toyota.Good thing she had this car free and clear.And hopefully it stayed running.Since, thanks to Marshall, her credit was on life support.That asshole, driving off one day in the brand new truck that had both their names on it.And then proceeding to not make payments.And then also continuing to use credit cards that were in both their names without her knowledge.Shed been able to get a certain amount of dings on the report taken care of, but some of it the bureaus had been unwilling to reverse.Right about now she couldnt get a car loan, or a new rental house, to save her life.Which, because of the general stability of her lifestyle, wasnt the biggest problem.Until a couple of days ago when shed found out that her landlord needed her out of the house in thirty days because she was selling it.Yes, that had thrown a wrench in the works.But she would figure it out.She always did.She could always move in with her mother, though the very idea of it made her shudder.She wouldnt be living on the streets, anyway, ideal situation or not.But she would worry about that later.First work, then poker.She could panic tomorrow.GET OUT OF my house, Miller.His brothers girlfriend looked up at him, the expression on her face comically innocent.I came bearing gifts, Connor.Is that any way to greet a guest with presents?You brought Beavers paraphernalia into my house.OSU fans can stay out on the lawn.We worship at the temple of green and gold here.Jack, who was already sitting at the table, thumped the side of the green ice bucket, proudly displaying the large University of Oregon O.  This is Duck country, sweetheart.Sadie batted her eyes.I had no idea.I just found this bright orange bowl and thought it would be a great bowl to bring black and orange M&Ms in.Shes a witch!Burn the witch!Jack chanted from his position at the table.Light anything else on my property on fire and I will roast you over the flames, Monaghan, Connor growled.Sorry, Con, he said.Bad joke, all things considered.Connor supposed it was.But then, if you couldnt laugh at lifes shit, you might as well lie down in it and die.Which...he was closer to doing some days than hed like to admit.Sadie ignored him and walked into the house, putting her giant orange bowl on the table, an ugly blot near his hallowed Ducks ice bucket.Eli should be by later.I invited Kate, too.This elicited a groan from Jack, and, he realized after the fact, from him, too.What?Sadie asked.Kate is my friend, and I want her here.Shes my little sister, Connor said.And I have to watch my mouth when shes around, Jack said.But you dont, Sadie said, arching her brow.Anyway, your boys club gets stale.The testosterone is so thick a girl can hardly breathe.Hey, Connor said.What about Liss?She is an excellent source of estrogen, but firmly on your team, Sadie said, reaching into her godforsaken bowl and taking out a handful of candy.He supposed he couldnt argue that point.Liss was his friend.And had been for years.Shed stuck by him almost as long as Jack.And she wasnt obligated by blood the way Eli was.Considering that, he definitely owed her an apology for being such a jackass this morning.But hangovers were not his friend.Considering that, he spent way more time with them than he should.Shes coming, right?Sadie asked.Yeah, Im surprised shes not here yet.As if on cue, the door burst open and Liss all but tumbled into the room, dropping her purse on the wooden floor and letting out a frustrated growl.My damn car wouldnt start.She straightened and pushed her dark, coppery hair from her forehead, her hazel eyes telegraphing her evil mood with supreme effect.I tried for twenty minutes in the parking lot at work, and then when I was getting ready to call a tow truck, it started for no apparent reason.Thats not a good sign.Sadie closed the distance between herself and Liss and picked Lisss purse up from the floor, not because Sadie was big into neatness, but because she seemed to like picking up after people.A therapist before shed come back to Copper Ridge to open her bed and breakfast, Sadie liked fixing other peoples problems more than she liked just about anything else.Except antagonizing them with sports rivalries, apparently.That sucks, Liss, Jack said, leaning back in his chair, his eyes on the forbidden bowl of candy.Eat the candy, Jack, Connor said, keeping his eyes on Liss.She was wearing the same clothes shed had on this morning, a pair of black dress pants and a blue button up shirt, her hair hanging loose around her shoulders.She looked flustered, which was unusual for Liss.Just one more thing I dont need, she grumbled.Something smells good.Frozen pizza,  la me, Connor said.Yum!Liss said, her crabby expression lightening.Anything else?I brought pizza rolls, Jack said.Anything else?Sadie asked.Theres cheesy garlic bread in the oven.And marinara sauce to dip in, Connor said.So, Sadie said, pizza, pizza thats folded in on itself and deconstructed pizza.Pretty much, Connor said.Any vegetables?Sadie asked.Its like you dont know us at all, Jack said.Im on board with your choice of menu for the evening, Liss said, sitting down at the table across from Jack and immediately snagging a beer from the Ducks bucket.I require carbs, cheese and grease to deal with my mood.Im sure Jake will take a look at your car, Connor said, referencing Copper Ridges new mechanic.Jake was still building a client base, and he was counting on word of mouth to help do that.Probably.But I dont really want to go begging for free work.Anyway, as long as its a minor issue I can afford to deal with it.But I am not in a position to buy a new car.Jack snorted.Who is?Probably you, Liss said.Jack just shrugged.Jack might be in the position but Connor certainly wasnt.Not with his barn reduced to ash and charred ranch equipment.Though, truly, he supposed that was a fixable problem.But somehow, every time he went to fix the paperwork the insurance place had sent over, he got distracted and ended up doing something else.So the changes never got made.And the paperwork never got fixed.And his bank account stayed empty.And his barn stayed ash.Damn, he needed a beer.He took one out of the bucket and rested the bottle against the corner of the table, pulling it down as he slammed his hand on the top of it.Show off, Sadie said.He shrugged.Yeah, I just figured Id put all my skills out there tonight.Putting frozen food in the oven, popping beer tops without a bottle opener.Im a badass.A superepic one, Liss said, taking a drink of her beer.And after Ive had this entire bottle, and possibly another, I might even upgrade you.To what?he asked.Superepic rock star badass.I like that.But I think cowboy should be in there somewhere.Jack winked.Youre not a real cowboy, though, Connor.When was the last time you rode a bucking bronco?No, asshole, youre confused.Youre not a real cowboy.You just play one in the ring, Connor said.Sadie started humming Rhinestone Cowboy, and Connor decided he liked her a little more than he had a few moments ago.The oven timer went off and Connor crossed the living room and went to the kitchen, getting some hot pads and taking the bread and pizza out of the oven.The pizza rolls were sitting in a ball on the counter, and he stacked the pan laden with the real pizza on top of the bowl and carried the tray of bread in his other hand, taking it all into the dining area.He set the food down in front of Liss and Jack, and Sadie gleefully reached for a plate, hovering near the bowl of pizza rolls.Next time, I promise to bake something, Sadie said.Quiche.That might elevate this a little bit.Although her expression said she didnt really mind slumming it with their subpar pizzas.Sure, Sadie, you could do that, Connor said.The door opened again, and Kate burst through it, followed by Eli, who was still in his uniform.Everything a stranger might want to know about his two younger siblings was conveyed by the way they walked into his house.Kate was exuberant, her footsteps loud, her grin irrepressible.Elis steps were measured, cautious.And when he saw Sadie, the slow, subtle smile that spread across his features expressed a depth of happiness that made Connors bones hurt.That had been him once.At least, that was how he remembered it.When hed walked into a room, there had been only one place his eyes had gone.Jessie.She had been his focal point, his North Star, from the time he was eighteen years old.And then suddenly, she was just gone.And so was his star.He cleared his throat and took another drink of beer.There was no point in following that train of thought.No point in thinking about her at all.Except it was hard on nights like this.On the one hand, he depended on these get togethers.They were his one opportunity to smile.To laugh.But when everyone was together like this, it was impossible to ignore the fact that it wasnt everyone.And it never would be again.Jessie had always sat next to him when they played poker.And sometimes she cheated, and he pretended he didnt notice.He hadnt played a hand since without wishing she was there to look at his cards.Still, it was better than drinking alone.Liss sat next to him now.And he figured if he couldnt be with his wife, he should be right near his best friend.Eli winced and reached into his jacket pocket, producing a vibrating cell phone.He let out a long suffering sigh.Ive got to take this.Campaign stuff.Its fine, Sadie said, answering for all of them.Ill turn it off for the game.Its fine, Connor reiterated.Eli waved a hand and walked back outside, the phone pressed to his ear.Sadie was smiling dreamily after him.Hes so sexy when hes doing political stuff, she said.Connor and Kate groaned.Then Kate moved farther into the room, offering her greetings.Hey, Jack.Hey, Sadie, Liss, she said, walking over to the table and taking a big piece of pizza off the pan, not bothering to use a plate.No greeting for him, but whatever.That was what younger sisters were for.Did you sort out the rental situation?It took him a moment to realize that Kate had directed the question at Liss.What rental situation?he asked.Sorry.I didnt realize you hadnt told everyone, Kate said, her expression sheepish.Liss looked slightly embarrassed.Oh, no, its not a big deal.Anyway, no, not yet.But I will.Wait a second, what rental thing?Is something happening with your house, Liss?Connor asked, feeling annoyed now, because his little sister knew something about his best friend that he didnt.Liss let out an exasperated breath.Im dealing, Connor.Put away your duct tape and superglue.You dont need to fix this.He almost opened his mouth to say he hadnt offered to fix a damn thing.Because it was true; he hadnt.He hadnt offered to fix a damn thing in years.There was no one around to complain if he didnt.So sinks stayed leaky, windows stayed drafty and...well, he got drunk while his friend was having a problem, and motherfucker, he didnt like that at all.Well, maybe I want to fix it if I can, he said.Thats nice of you, Connor, but I dont think you can.Unfortunately, Im uncovering a lot of damage Marshall did to my credit when he took off a couple of years ago.Some of it was obvious and came to my attention pretty quickly.Some of it has been less so.There were other credit cards, an additional car loan, plus what I already knew about.Basically, even with the credit bureaus correcting some of it, I cant get a new rental easily.And now that my landlord is selling...Thats not fair!Kate said around a mouthful of pizza.Most everybody here knows you, Liss.And a lot of us knew Marshall.So we kind of know he was an ass.If you had always known that, Kate, you might have let me in on it, Liss said, smiling ruefully.I think I did tell you that, Connor said through clenched teeth.Repeatedly.Liss tightened her lips into a bud, and Connor could tell she was holding back a deadly reply.He didnt really care.Shed been warned.She didnt listen.And while he didnt hold it against her, he had pretty much told her so the minute shed shacked up with that idiot who was, well, an idiot.Of course, Connord had to acknowledge, just to himself, that he mightve been being unfair, because no man seemed good enough for Liss.Kind of like how no man would ever seem good enough for Kate.But in the end, his instincts had been right on.Marshall had been a loser.Marshall had run off with Lisss money and the truck they had just bought.And now this.Thats beside the point, Connor continued.How long do you have to move out?Legally, I have thirty days.But its a private sale, and everything is moving really quickly.I figure Im going to be out on my rear one way or the other.I mean, if its that or going to live with my mother, then I will stay until the very last second, but...You should stay here, Kate said.Lisss eyes widened, and he felt his own mouth fall open.Here?As in...here here?Well, Sadie has the B and B.  Sadie winced.Im booked solid through Christmas.People coming to visit family, combined with the off season discount, created a deluge of reservations.Your bed and breakfast is your livelihood, Sadie, Liss said.Im not going to take advantage of that.No one would expect me to do accounting for free.I wouldnt do accounting for money, Jack said.You probably couldnt do accounting for money, either, Liss returned.Im wounded, Liss, Jack said.However, speaking of all that, maybe somebody has a room and could use your services?Connor thought about all the paperwork he had left to do for the insurance.No, it wasnt accounting, but he had accounting to do.Though Liss already did it for him.And he even paid her.It was one of the few administrative things that still got done on time and well, because he paid for the service, rather than pretending he would do it himself one day.And Liss had brought him groceries this morning.In exchange for nothing but a bowl of cereal.He used her services already, many of them, and gave back very little in return these days.You can stay with me, Liss, he said, before he had time to fully process the implications of what he was offering.Really?She looked shocked, and that made him feel even worse.Because why should she be shocked that her best friend was offering basic hospitality to her in her time of need?She shouldnt be.He was clearly an asshole.Yes, really.This house is huge.And Im here all by myself.Ive got three completely empty bedrooms, plus office space I never use.Jessie had used the office to manage ranch staff, but he never had.It felt weird offering her space up.But she was gone, and Liss was here.Liss needed him, and he was going to help.Anyway, it would just be until you can figure out a way to get a place of your own.Until you can find somebody whos willing to go outside the box for you.Or until your credit improves, or whatever.And you can save up for your deposit and first and last months rent and all that.Connor, I cant stay here for free.No, youll be staying here in exchange for groceries.She already bought them for him, anyway.Plus, I might need a little bit of help with my organization.Jack snorted.You think?We dont all have obsessive compulsive tendencies like Eli, Connor said drily.Eli, of course, chose that exact moment to walk back in, looking as if he was willing and able to lay down a little law and order.Sure, Eli was younger, but the two of them had banded together at a very young age to take care of the ranch and raise Kate.Hed had to start seeing Eli in a new light very quickly.There were only two years between them, anyway, but Connor had begun viewing him as an equal from the moment Eli had taken on household responsibilities.And now that Connor lived alone in the big house, barely able to clean up after himself, he really appreciated all that Eli had done to make their lives better when theyd been kids.Since then, Eli had gone from protecting the family to protecting the entire town.And while Connor didnt go around gushing about it, he couldnt be prouder.Even when Eli looked at him like he was a lost cause.Much like he was doing now.What did I miss?Eli asked.Connor is defending his lack of housekeeping skills, Jack said.Sadie crossed the room to Eli and wrapped her arms around his neck, kissing him deeply as though they hadnt just greeted each other a few moments ago.Hey, Sheriff, she said.Not yet, he said.Dont jinx it.Im not a jinx!Im the human incarnation of a lucky rabbits foot!Are you?he asked, cocking his head to the side, the whole interaction way too cute for his formerly stoic sibling.They separated slowly, Elis hand sliding over her hip before resting there.Connors stomach twisted.Connor isnt just defending his housekeeping, Sadie said.Hes offering Liss a place to stay until she can find a new rental.What happened with your old rental?Eli said, frowning deeply.Liss sighed.I should have known that once the Garrett family got involved this whole thing would get epic.Long story abridged, my credit sucks because of Marshall, and my landlord is selling.Elis breath hissed through his teeth.Thats a bad combination.But its going to be fine, Connor said, his tone insistent.Because she can stay with me until she figures something out.I have plenty of room here.Anyway, shes here every night as it is.And she already brings me groceries.Youre a little too attached to the grocery thing, Liss said.He shrugged.Hey, its your rent.A small price to pay for a bedroom at Chez Garrett.* * * LISS FIDGETED, LOOKING AROUND the room at all the expectant gazes.The Garretts were her surrogate family, so it was no surprise they had all rushed to her aid.But she hadnt told Connor for a specific reason.Shed found herself talking to Kate today during her lunch break, when theyd run into each other at the Crab Shanty during lunch hour.She should have known that the youngest Garrett wouldnt employ discretion.Anyway, this was a solution, and she did need a solution.It was just the idea of living with Connor was sort of a loaded one.For a variety of reasons.Though resisting would be...well, stupid.Because it was this or living with her mother, and she could genuinely imagine nothing worse than living with her mother.Except, maybe, living under a bridge.Actually, though, the bridge might be preferable.But Connor had a point.This was a huge house.She spent a lot of time here, anyway.Though, under normal circumstances, she wouldve wanted a little bit of time to think it over.Just because it was a change.Just because any commitment to move was kind of a big deal.But with the Garrett clan, Sadie and Jack all staring at her as if she had to issue a formal statement now, she felt as though she could hardly leave them waiting.So she just ran through a quick laundry list of excuses and drawbacks, to be on the safe side: Connors house was farther from work.She had never been that into the rustic look.Which his place had in spades.She would have to put some of her furniture in storage.Being in close proximity to Connor might make her loins burst into flame, starting another fire, leaving him homeless as well as barnless.Yes, that.That was a problem.But then, she had done a lot of work in the loin department where Connor was concerned.She should be able to handle it.Honestly, she had been friends with the man for more than fifteen years, so her coping skills where he was concerned should be more refined.They were possibly even more refined than she realized.High exposure to Connor might actually help.If so, things like this morning, and that intimacy she had felt in the moment, would seem more commonplace.So, there was a theory.And it was helping with her attempt at a snap decision.Thank you, Connor.I. ..Thank you.I really appreciate the offer.But were going to have to talk about logistics, because Im not just going to stay here and sponge off you.Im not worried about that.Honestly, he said.Well, I am.I dont want to take advantage of you or our friendship.You wont, he said, his tone carrying a note of finality.If anyone has been taking advantage over the past few years, its been me.I didnt even realize you were going through something.You didnt tell me.That says a lot.Connor, she said, her voice quiet, I just didnt want to pile on.Thats the thing.You sure as hell should not be thinking of sharing things with me as piling on.Im your friend.Yeah, Ive had my share of bullshit going on for the past couple of years, but that doesnt mean you need to keep all this to yourself.I shouldve made that clearer.Lisss chest tightened.She didnt like putting her crap on other people.Especially not someone who was already going through so much.Regardless of what he said, it did matter.She didnt like to be a burden to people.Least of all people she cared about.Why would anyone keep her around if she was taking more than she was giving?You should definitely stay here, Liss.It was Elis turn to give his two cents.Apparently.Im going to.Thank you.Jack took another piece of pizza off the tray and leaned back in his chair.Are we going to play cards, or are we going to stand around debating living situations?Not that you asked, Connor, but I might like to come and stay here, too.Why would you do that?Your house is nicer than mine.Yes, but Liss is going to be in your house, buying groceries.Im assuming she might even cook some of those groceries.I never said anything about cooking, Liss said.And even if I were going to cook, I would not be cooking for you.I will, however, kick your ass at poker.Jack spread his arms wide.Bring it on.Everyone jostled and started taking their spots at the table, Eli reaching out to the center of it and grabbing a deck of cards.Its about to be brought, Monaghan, Liss said.And for a moment things felt normal.Things felt sane.Pretty soon all of that would change, but for now they were just going to play some cards.HEY, LISS, CONNOR SAID, following her out the door to his house and down the steps of the porch.The poker game was done, and Jack had already gone home, while Kate was in the dining room lingering over the bowl of pizza rolls, and Eli and Sadie were just sort of happily sitting in the same chair.Liss was ready to go, blaming an early work schedule, but they still had some things to figure out as far as Connor was concerned.It was dark outside, cold enough that Connor could see his breath as he exhaled, the sharp bite of air in his lungs a signal that fall was fleeting and winter was biting at its ankles.We need to talk just a little bit before you go, he said.Liss paused and turned on her heel, the gravel crunching beneath her feet.Do we need to talk tonight?She sounded tired, and he couldnt blame her.Had she sounded tired this morning?Had she sounded tired for longer than that?What else hadnt he noticed?Its not going to be long and involved, I promise.I just want to get a few things straight.Youre not paying me rent.Im going to have to compensate you somehow.Sure you are.You will bring me food, like you already do, and I will actually give you something in return.Connor, dont be difficult about this.At least let me go over some of the paperwork for the ranch.Get things organized.And maybe the house, too.If Im going to be living in it, then I need things at a slightly higher level of cleanliness.Fine.Done.He ignored the tightening in his stomach.All of these offers of payment sounded very...domestic.Which was fair, he supposed, since they would be sharing the same house.Good, she said, nodding.Im glad we could come to an agreement.Something about the situation struck him as funny then, loosening the knot in his gut.I feel like we should shake hands or something.It does feel a little formal, doesnt it?Yeah.Better idea.He reached out and pulled Liss into a hug, not really thinking about it until she was pressed up against him, warm, soft and very feminine.He didnt hug people often.He didnt hug people ever, really.Sometimes he hugged Kate, an awkward half hug.And he was more likely to punch Eli in the face than pull him into an embrace.Very likely for those reasons the contact hit him with the force of a two by four.And while he was still reeling from the hit, time seemed to slow, and he became acutely aware of small things he would never normally notice.Of how soft she was, how tiny she was, folded into his arms, andof coursethe press of her breasts against his chest, because he was only human.Connor breathed in deep, inhaling a hint of wood smoke coming from his own chimney, a bit of sea salt mixed with pine and a floral note he knew was coming from Lisss hair.The kind of girlie shampoo that had once cluttered up his shower, but had been absent from his house and his senses.And for some reason, in this strange slow motion moment it seemed perfectly acceptable for him to run his palm up Lisss back.Connor, youre kind of squishing my face.Lisss muffled voice broke the moment, time suddenly returning to its normal speed.He laughed, a short, harsh sound that wasnt really intentional.But apparently, the release was necessary.He let go of her and took a step backward.Sorry about your face.Hang on to that, Connor.That could be a really useful insult later.I meant it sincerely.The squishing of your face, not the features of your face.The features of your face are fine.He had a feeling he wasnt making any of this better, or less weird.Thank you, she said, her tone letting him know that he definitely seemed weird to her.Im going to go home now.If I dont get my sleep, the numbers will not be effectively crunched tomorrow.That would be a shame.Not really.But I need the paycheck.So when do you want to move, then?She kicked her foot across the top of the gravel, the rocks clacking against each other.I dont know.I mean, I have time...Well, whatever you want.Ill even help you move.Liss pulled a face.What exactly has come over you?Youre being all helpful and things.I guess its the realization that I havent been very helpful at all recently.They both knew exactly since when.I understand.Im not going to tell you how you should handle all this.Its not my place.Youre about the only one who thinks that.Eli thinks I need to get over it.Jack thinks I need to get laid.Liss cleared her throat loudly.With that in mind, I will be the one who thinks you just need to do what you can.I can do this, Connor said.I can give this to you.So let me.She scuffed her toe over the gravel, the rocks clicking together.I am.Well work out the logistics later.Thank you.He gave her a halfhearted wave and turned away from her, walking back up the steps before pausing and watching her get into her car.Waiting until it started to go back inside.At least the thing would get her home tonight.He shut the front door behind him and walked into the dining area, coming face to face with three very rapt sets of eyes.What?he asked.So, Liss is going to move in?Eli asked.Were you not here for the entirety of this?Connor returned.Just confirming.She needs me.Shes a friend.I know, Eli said.Well, you look too interested.Theres nothing to be interested about.Sadies expression turned placating, which only irritated him more.Of course not.She reached into her offensive orange bowl and started digging around for candy.It is very nice that youre doing this for her.You all have the wrong end of the stick, he said, pointing at the group.You would not be reacting like this if I offered Jack a place to stay.And if Jack needed me, I would have him stay here, too.And hes a way bigger pain in the ass than Liss.True, Kate said.On all counts.See?Katie agrees with me.Not, Kate said, her tone filled with warning, if you keep calling me Katie.A smile tugged at his lips.Whatever you say, Katie.It was Kates turn to reach into the bowl.She pulled out a couple of M&Ms and hurled a couple at his head.Serves you right, she said when one clocked him in the temple.Oh, no, he said, in mock terror.You threw candy at me.Beaver candy, Sadie said.Okay, ladies, lets get out of Connors hair, Eli said, showing an uncharacteristic amount of sensitivity.Eli usually thought nothing of running roughshod over him.Mainly because Eli always seemed to think he knew how other people should live their lives, and Connor was no exception to that.Eli lifted Sadie from his lap and stood, raising his arms behind his head and stretching.I need to sleep, he said.With the election so close now, Im not doing very much of that.But youre going to win, Sadie said, her tone confident.You are, Kate agreed.Both women looked at Connor.You are, he said, and he wasnt just saying that to stroke his brothers ego.He was the best choice for the county; there was no question about that.Eli was a professional at sacrifice.He had sacrificed for Kate when hed been a teenager.Had sacrificed his safety when hed agreed to wear the uniform.And Connor knew, and never took for granted, the fact that Eli had sacrificed by being the one to come and tell him about Jessies accident.Connor knew that no one in the department would have ever asked it of him.But Connor also knew that Eli would have never given the responsibility to anyone else.For those reasons, and for so many more, Connor knew his brother was the man Logan County needed as its sheriff.Well, I appreciate the votes of confidence.Just make sure theyre also physical votes on election day.Are you kidding?Im going to go stand by the ballot drop boxes with my shirt off and my chest painted, Connor said.A big painting of your face.I will arrest you.And Im not joking, Eli said, lacing his fingers through Sadies and heading toward the door.Kate stood up and followed after them, offering him a goodbye wave.Goodbye, Connor, Sadie said as they headed out, shutting the door behind them.And he was left alone again, by himself and in his big empty house.But that was about to change.Disquiet lodged itself in his gut.Hed had quite enough change over the past few years, and this was more of it.But he wouldnt be alone.He was really fucking tired of being alone.But he was alone now so he took another beer out of the ice bucket.A couple more drinks would help drown out the silence.Would help him fall asleep.And there was no one here to tell him no.* * * I THINK I SOLVED my rental problem, Liss said, sliding a paper clip onto a stack of papers and looking up at Jeanette, her coworker, who sat at the desk opposite her.You found someone to rent to you?Jeanette asked, licking an envelope and smoothing it closed.Not exactly.But Connor has a lot of empty rooms, and hes agreed to let me stay with him until I can find a place.Jeanette arched a dark brow and looked to the left to make sure no one else was lingering nearby.Maria and Sandra were the only others in the office today, but the older women didnt necessarily enjoy listening to her and Jeanette gossip.Is this fine ass Connor?The one with the bulging forearms and very delicious tattoo?Your friend?The one whos been by to pick you up from work a few times?Jeanette had been in town for only a couple of years, so she didnt know everyones life or life story in as much detail as most of the locals did.Liss cleared her throat.Yes, that Connor.Get it, girl.Lisss face burned, and she knew full well that she was blushing.There will be no getting of it.Hes just helping me out.And he really is just a friend.Jeanette frowned.Sorry.I did not imagine for one second that you were really only just friends with a man who looked like that.I just thought you were slow on the rebound after that jerk left.Jeanette never remembered Marshalls name, or at least, she pretended she didnt remember his name.Because Jeanette was a goddess like that.Its not like that with us.I was really good friends with his wife.Him, too.But Jessie and I were friends for...years and...well, that would be weird.And you know.Too much baggage.It was a refrain she had repeated to herself often.Yeah, that makes sense.Thats a lot of history.A book full of it.Thats the problem with small towns, Liss said, sighing heavily.Theres history everywhere.That is perhaps why Ive been single for so long.Except she knew it wasnt just that.Thankfully, I came with a man in tow.Jeanette and her husband, Tom, had been married for five years, and Tom had come to Copper Ridge to work as a fisherman.It was a better plan than mine.Which was to grow up here, never leave and ensure every man in my age group knew me far too well to see me as anything other than a friend.Im thinking Copper Ridge could almost single handedly cause a boom in the mail order husband market.Maybe I could get myself a nice biddable Russian groom.One who would chop wood and open jars for me.Let me know how that works out.I might sign up.Jeanette winked and pushed a stack of papers beneath a hole punch, pressing it down firmly.Not that I need another husband.
