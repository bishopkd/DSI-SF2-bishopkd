I gaze at her in disbelief.Even I used to masturbate, before Elena sunk her claws into me.Shes probably never had an orgasmthough I find this hard to believe.Whoa.Im responsible for her first fuck and her first orgasm.Id better make this good.Well, well have to see what we can do about that.Im going to make you come like a freight train, baby.Hellshes probably never seen a naked man, either.Not taking my eyes off hers, I undo the top button on my jeans and ease them onto the floor, though I cant risk taking my shirt off, because she might touch me.But if she didit wouldnt be so badwould it?Being touched?I banish the thought before the darkness surfaces, and grasping her ankles, I spread her legs.Her eyes widen and her hands clench my sheets.Yes.Keep your hands there, baby.I crawl slowly up the bed, between her legs.She squirms beneath me.Keep still, I tell her, and lean down to kiss the delicate skin of her inner thigh.I trail kisses up her thighs, over her panties, across her belly, nipping and sucking as I go.She writhes beneath me.Were going to have to work on keeping you still, baby.If youll let me.Ill teach her to just absorb the pleasure and not move, intensifying every touch, every kiss, every nip.The thought alone is enough to make me want to bury myself in her, but before I do, I want to know how responsive she is.So far she hasnt held back.Shes allowing me free rein over her body.Shes not hesitant at all.She wants thisshe really wants this.I dip my tongue into her navel and continue my leisurely journey north, savoring her.I shift, lying beside her, one leg still between hers.My hand ghosts up her body, over her hip, up her waist, on to her breast.Gently I cup her breast, trying to gauge her reaction.She doesnt stiffen.She doesnt stop meshe trusts me.Can I extend her trust to letting me have complete dominion over her bodyover her?The thought is exhilarating.You fit my hand perfectly, Anastasia.Dipping my finger into her bra cup, I jerk it down, freeing her breast.The nipple is small, rose pink, and its already hard.I drag the cup down so that the fabric and underwire rest under her breast, forcing it upward.I repeat the process with the other cup and watch, fascinated, as her nipples grow under my steady gaze.WhoaI havent even touched her yet.Very nice, I whisper in awed appreciation, and blow gently on the nearest nipple, watching in delight as it hardens and extends.Anastasia closes her eyes and arches her back.Keep still, baby, just absorb the pleasure, it will feel so much more intense.Blowing on one nipple, I roll the other gently between my thumb and forefinger.She grasps the sheets tightly as I lean down and suckhard.Her body bows again and she cries out.Lets see if we can make you come like this, I whisper, and I dont stop.She starts to whimper.Oh, yes, babyfeel this.Her nipples extend farther and she starts grinding her hips, around and around.Keep still, baby.I will teach you to keep still.Oh, please, she begs.Her legs stiffen.Its working.Shes close.I continue my lascivious assault.Concentrating on each nipple, watching her response, sensing her pleasure, is driving me to distraction.Lord, I want her.Let go, baby, I murmur, and pull her nipple with my teeth.She cries out as she climaxes.Yes!I move quickly to kiss her, capturing her cries in my mouth.Shes breathless and panting, lost in her pleasureMine.I own her first orgasm, and Im ridiculously pleased by the thought.Youre very responsive.Youre going to have to learn to control that, and its going to be so much fun teaching you how.I cant waitbut right now, I want her.All of her.I kiss her once more and let my hand travel down her body, down to her vulva.I hold her, feeling her heat.Slipping my index finger through the lace of her panties, I slowly circle around herfuck, shes soaking.Youre so deliciously wet.God, I want you.I thrust my finger inside her, and she cries out.Shes hot and tight and wet, and I want her.I thrust into her again, taking her cries into my mouth.I press my palm to her clitorispushing downpushing around.She cries out and writhes beneath me.Fuck, I want hernow.Shes ready.Sitting up, I drag her panties off, then my boxers, and reach for a condom.I kneel up between her legs, pushing them farther apart.Anastasia watches me withwhat?Trepidation?Shes probably never seen an erect penis before.Dont worry.You expand, too, I mutter.Stretching out over her, I put my hands on either side of her head, taking my weight on my elbows.God, I want herbut I check shes still keen.You really want to do this?I ask.For fucks sake, please dont say no.Please, she begs.Pull your knees up, I instruct her.Thisll be easier.Have I ever been so aroused?I can barely contain myself.I dont get itit must be her.Why?Grey, focus!I position myself so I can take her at my whim.Her eyes are open wide, imploring me.She really wants thisas much as I do.Should I be gentle and prolong the agony, or do I go for it?I go for it.I need to possess her.Im going to fuck you now, Miss Steele.Hard.One thrust and Im inside her.F.  U.  C.  K.   Shes so fucking tight.She cries out.Shit!Ive hurt her.I want to move, to lose myself in her, and it takes all my restraint to stop.Youre so tight.You okay?I ask, my voice a hoarse, anxious whisper, and she nods, eyes wider.Shes like heaven on earth, so tight around me.And even though her hands are on my forearms, I dont care.The darkness is slumbering, perhaps because Ive wanted her for so long.Ive never felt this desire, thishunger before.Its a new feeling, new and shiny.I want so much from her: her trust, her obedience, her submission.I want her to be mine, but right nowIm hers.Im going to move, baby.My voice is strained as I ease back slowly.Its such an extraordinary, exquisite feeling: her body cradling my cock.I push into her again and claim her, knowing no one has before.She whimpers.I stop.More?Yes, she breathes, after a moment.This time I thrust into her more deeply.Again?I plead, as sweat beads on my body.Yes.Her trust in meits suddenly overwhelming, and I start to move, really move.I want her to come.I will not stop until she comes.I want to own this woman, body and soul.I want her clenching around me.Fuckshe starts meeting every thrust, matching my rhythm.See how well we fit together, Ana?I grasp her head, holding her in place while I claim her body and kiss her hard, claiming her mouth.She stiffens beneath mefuck yes.Her orgasm is close.Come for me, Ana, I demand, and she cries out as shes consumed, tipping her head back, her mouth open, her eyes closedand just the sight of her ecstasy is enough.I explode in her, losing all sense and reason, as I call out her name and come violently inside her.When I open my eyes Im panting, trying to catch my breath, and were forehead to forehead and shes staring up at me.Fuck.Im undone.I plant a swift kiss on her forehead and pull out of her and lie down beside her.She winces as I withdraw, but other than that she looks okay.Did I hurt you?I ask, and I tuck her hair behind her ear, because I dont want to stop touching her.Ana beams with incredulity.You are asking me if you hurt me?And for a moment I dont know why shes grinning.Oh.My playroom.The irony is not lost on me, I mutter.Even now she confounds me.Seriously, are you okay?She stretches out beside me, testing her body and teasing me with an amused but sated expression.You havent answered me, I growl.I need to know if she found that enjoyable.All the evidence points to a yesbut I need to hear it from her.While Im waiting for her reply I remove the condom.Lord, I hate these things.I discard it discreetly on the floor.She peers up at me.Id like to do that again, she says with a shy giggle.What?Again?Already?Would you now, Miss Steele?I kiss the corner of her mouth.Demanding little thing, arent you?Turn on your front.That way I know you wont touch me.She gives me a brief sweet smile, then rolls onto her stomach.My cock stirs with approval.I unhook her bra and run my hand down her back to her pert behind.You really have the most beautiful skin, I say, as I brush her hair off her face and push her legs apart.Gently I plant soft kisses on her shoulder.Why are you wearing your shirt?she asks.Shes so damn inquisitive.While shes on her front I know she cant touch me, so I lean back and pull my shirt over my head and let it drop to the floor.Fully naked, I lie on top of her.Her skin is warm, and melts against mine.HmmI could get used to this.So you want me to fuck you again?I whisper in her ear, kissing her.She squirms deliciously against me.Oh, this will never do.Keep still, baby.I skim my hand down her body to the back of her knee, then hitch it up high, parting her legs wide so that shes spread beneath me.Her breath catches and I hope its with anticipation.She stills beneath me.Finally!I palm her ass as I ease my weight onto her.Im going to take you from behind, Anastasia.With my other hand I grab her hair at the nape and tug gently, holding her in place.She cannot move.Her hands are helpless and splayed against the sheets, out of harms way.You are mine, I whisper.Only mine.Dont forget it.With my free hand I move from her ass to her clitoris and begin circling slowly.Her muscles flex beneath me as she tries to move, but my weight keeps her in place.I run my teeth along her jawline.Her sweet fragrance lingers over the scent of our coupling.You smell divine, I whisper, as I nuzzle behind her ear.She starts to circle her hips against my moving hand.Keep still, I warn.Or I might stop  Slowly I insert my thumb inside her and circle it around and around, taking particular care to stroke the front wall of her vagina.She groans and tenses beneath me, trying to move again.You like this?I tease, and my teeth trace her outer ear.I dont stop my fingers from tormenting her clitoris, but I begin to ease my thumb in and out of her.She stiffens, but cant move.She groans loudly, her eyes scrunched up tight.Youre so wet, so quickly.So responsive.Oh, Anastasia, I like that.I like that a lot.Right.Lets see how far youll go.I withdraw my thumb from her vagina.Open your mouth, I order, and when she does I thrust my thumb between her lips.See how you taste.Suck me, baby.She sucks my thumbhard.Fuck.And for a moment I imagine its my cock in her mouth.I want to fuck your mouth, Anastasia, and I will soon.Im breathless.She closes her teeth around me, biting me hard.Ow!Fuck.I grip her hair tightly and she loosens her mouth.Naughty, sweet girl.My mind flits through a number of punishments worthy of such a bold move that, if she were my submissive, I could inflict on her.My cock expands to bursting at the thought.I release her and sit back on my knees.Stay still, dont move.I grab another condom from my bedside table, rip open the foil, and roll the latex over my erection.Watching her, I see that shes still, except for the rise and fall of her back as she pants in anticipation.Shes gorgeous.Leaning over her again, I grasp her hair and hold her so she cant move her head.Were going to go real slow this time, Anastasia.She gasps, and gently I ease into her until I can go no farther.Fuck.She feels good.As I ease out I circle my hips and slowly slip into her again.She whimpers and her limbs tense beneath me as she tries to move.Oh no, baby.I want you still.I want you to feel this.Take all the pleasure.You feel so good, I tell her, and repeat the move again, circling my hips as I go.Slowly.In.Out.In.Out.Her insides start to tremble.Oh no, baby, not yet.No way am I letting you come.Not when Im enjoying this so much.Oh, please, she cries.I want you sore, baby.I pull out and sink into her again.Every time you move tomorrow, I want you to be reminded that Ive been here.Only me.You are mine.Please, Christian, she begs.What do you want, Anastasia?Tell me.I continue the slow torture.Tell me.You, please.Shes desperate.She wants me.Good girl.I increase the pace and her insides begin to quiver, responding immediately.Between each thrust I utter one word.You.Are.So.Sweet.I.  Want.You.So.Much.You.Are.Mine.Her limbs tremble with the strain of keeping still.Shes on the edge.Come for me, baby, I growl.And on command she shudders around me as her orgasm rips through her and she screams my name into the mattress.My name on her lips is my undoing, and I climax and collapse on top of her.Fuck.Ana, I whisper, drained yet elated.I pull out of her almost immediately and roll onto my back.She curls up at my side, and as I pull off the condom, she closes her eyes and falls asleep.SUNDAY, MAY 22, 2011    * * *      I wake with a start and a pervading sense of guilt, as if Ive committed a terrible sin.Is it because Ive fucked Anastasia Steele?Virgin?Shes snuggled up fast asleep beside me.I check the radio alarm: its after three in the morning.Ana sleeps the sound sleep of an innocent.Well, not so innocent now.My body stirs as I watch her.I could wake her.Fuck her again.There are definitely some advantages to having her in my bed.Grey.Stop this nonsense.Fucking her was merely a means to an end and a pleasant diversion.Yes.Very pleasant.More like incredible.It was just sex, for fucks sake.I close my eyes in what will probably be a futile attempt to sleep.But the room is too full of Ana: her scent, the sound of her soft breathing, and the memory of my first vanilla fuck.Visions of her head thrown back in passion, of her crying out a barely recognizable version of my name, and her unbridled enthusiasm for sexual congress overwhelm me.Miss Steele is a carnal creature.She will be a joy to train.My cock twitches in agreement.Shit.I cant sleep, though tonight its not nightmares that keep me awake, its little Miss Steele.Climbing out of bed, I collect the used condoms from the floor, knot them, and dispose of them in the wastepaper basket.From the chest of drawers I pull out a pair of PJ pants and drag them on.With a lingering look at the enticing woman in my bed, I venture into the kitchen.Im thirsty.Once Ive had a glass of water, I do what I always do when I cant sleepI check my e mail in my study.Taylor has returned and is asking if he can stand Charlie Tango down.Stephan must be asleep upstairs.I e mail him back with a yes, though at this time of night its a given.Back in the living room I sit down at my piano.This is my solace, where I can lose myself for hours.Ive been able to play well since I was nine, but it wasnt until I had my own piano, in my own place, that it really became a passion.When I want to forget everything, this is what I do.And right now I dont want to think about having propositioned a virgin, fucked her, or revealed my lifestyle to someone with no experience.With my hands on the keys, I begin to play and lose myself in the solitude of Bach.A movement distracts me from the music, and when I look up Anas standing by the piano.Wrapped in a comforter, her hair wild and curling down her back, eyes luminous, she looks stunning.Sorry, she says.I didnt mean to disturb you.Why is she apologizing?Surely, I should be saying that to you.I play the last notes and stand.You should be in bed, I chide.That was a beautiful piece.Bach?Transcription by Bach, but its originally an oboe concerto by Alessandro Marcello.It was exquisite, but very sad, such a melancholy melody.Melancholy?It wouldnt be the first time someone has used that word to describe me.May I speak freely?Sir.Leila is kneeling beside me while I work.You may.Sir, you are most melancholy today.Am I?Yes, Sir.Is there something that you would like me to do?I shake off the memory.Ana should be in bed.I tell her so again.I woke and you werent there.I find it difficult to sleep, and Im not used to sleeping with anyone.Ive told her thisand why am I justifying myself?I wrap my arm around her naked shoulders, enjoying the feel of her skin, and guide her back to the bedroom.How long have you been playing?You play beautifully.Since I was six.Im abrupt.Oh, she says.I think shes taken the hintI dont want to talk about my childhood.How are you feeling?I ask as I switch on the bedside light.Im good.Theres blood on my sheets.Her blood.Evidence of her now absent virginity.Her eyes dart from the stains to me and she looks away, embarrassed.Well, thats going to give Mrs.Jones something to think about.She looks mortified.Its just your body, sweetheart.I grasp her chin and tip her head back so I can see her expression.Im about to give her a short lecture on how not to be ashamed of her body, when she reaches out to touch my chest.Fuck.I step out of her reach as the darkness surfaces.No.Dont touch me.Get into bed, I order, rather more sharply than Id intended, but I hope she doesnt detect my fear.Her eyes widen with confusion and maybe hurt.Damn.Ill come and lie down with you, I add, as a peace offering, and from the chest of drawers I pull out a T shirt and quickly slip it on, for protection.Shes still standing, staring at me.Bed, I command more forcefully.She scrambles into my bed and lies down and I climb in behind her, folding her in my arms.I bury my face in her hair and inhale her sweet scent: autumn and apple trees.Facing away, she cant touch me, and while I lie there I resolve to spoon with her until shes asleep.Then Ill get up and do some work.Sleep, sweet Anastasia.I kiss her hair and close my eyes.Her scent fills my nostrils, reminding me of a happy time and leaving me repletecontent, even  Mommy is happy today.She is singing.Singing about what love has to do with it.And cooking.And singing.My tummy gurgles.She is cooking bacon and waffles.They smell good.My tummy likes bacon and waffles.They smell so good.Opening my eyes, light is flooding through the windows and theres a mouthwatering aroma coming from the kitchen.Bacon.Momentarily Im confused.Is Gail back from her sisters?Then I remember.Ana.A look at the clock tells me its late.I bounce out of bed and follow my nose to the kitchen.Theres Ana.Shes wearing my shirt, her hair in braids, dancing around to some music.Only I cant hear it.Shes wearing earbuds.Unobserved, I take a seat at the kitchen counter and watch the show.Shes whisking eggs, making breakfast, her braids bouncing as she jiggles from foot to foot, and I realize shes not wearing underwear.Good girl.She has to be one of the most uncoordinated females Ive ever seen.Its amusing, charming, and strangely arousing at the same time; I think of all the ways I can improve her coordination.When she turns and spots me, she freezes.Good morning, Miss Steele.Youre veryenergetic this morning.She looks even younger in her braids.I I slept well, she stammers.I cant imagine why, I quip, admitting to myself that I did, too.Its after nine.When did I last sleep past 6:30?Yesterday.After Id slept with her.Are you hungry?she asks.Very.And Im not sure if its for breakfast or for her.Pancakes, bacon, and eggs?she says.Sounds great.I dont know where you keep your placemats, she says, seeming at a loss, and I think shes embarrassed, because I caught her dancing.Taking pity on her, I offer to set places for breakfast and add, Would you like me to put some music on so you can continue yourerdancing?Her cheeks pink and she looks down at the floor.Damn.Ive upset her.Please, dont stop on my account.Its very entertaining.With a pout she turns her back on me and continues to whisk the eggs with gusto.I wonder if she has any idea how disrespectful this is to someone like mebut of course she doesnt, and for some unfathomable reason it makes me smile.Sidling up to her, I gently tug one of her braids.I love these.They wont protect you.Not from me.Not now that Ive had you.How would you like your eggs?Her tone is unexpectedly haughty.And I want to laugh out loud, but I resist.Thoroughly whisked and beaten, I reply, trying and failing to sound deadpan.She attempts to hide her amusement, too, and continues her task.Her smile is bewitching.Hastily, I set up the placemats, wondering when I last did this for someone else.Never.Normally over the weekend my submissive would take care of all domestic tasks.Not today, Grey, because shes not your submissiveyet.I pour us both orange juice and put the coffee on.She doesnt drink coffee, only tea.Would you like some tea?Yes, please.If you have some.In the cupboard I find the Twinings teabags Id asked Gail to buy.Well, well, who would have thought Id ever get to use them?She frowns when she sees them.Bit of a foregone conclusion, wasnt I?Are you?Im not sure weve concluded anything yet, Miss Steele, I answer with a stern look.And dont talk about yourself like that.I add her self deprecation to the list of behaviors that will need modifying.She avoids my gaze, busy with serving up breakfast.Two plates are placed on the placemats, then she fetches the maple syrup out of the fridge.When she looks up at me Im waiting for her to sit down.Miss Steele.I indicate where she should sit.Mr.Grey, she replies, with contrived formality, and winces as she sits.Just how sore are you?Im surprised by an uneasy sense of guilt.I want to fuck her again, preferably after breakfast, but if shes too sore that will be out of the question.Perhaps I could use her mouth this time.The color in her face rises.Well, to be truthful, I have nothing to compare this to, she says tartly.Did you wish to offer your commiserations?Her sarcastic tone takes me by surprise.If she were mine, it would earn her a spanking at least, maybe over the kitchen counter.No.I wondered if we should continue your basic training.Oh.She startles.Yes, Ana, we can have sex during the day, too.And Id like to fill that smart mouth of yours.I take a bite of my breakfast and close my eyes in appreciation.It tastes mighty fine.When I swallow shes still staring at me.Eat, Anastasia, I order.This is delicious, incidentally.She can cook, and well.Ana takes one bite of her food, then pushes her breakfast around on her plate.I ask her to stop biting her lip.Its very distracting, and I happen to know youre not wearing anything under my shirt.She fidgets with her teabag and the teapot, ignoring my irritation.What sort of basic training did you have in mind?she asks.Shes ever curiouslets see how far shell go.Well, as youre sore, I thought we could stick to oral skills.She splutters into her teacup.Hell.I dont want to choke the girl.Gently, I pat her on the back and hand her a glass of orange juice.Thats if you want to stay.I shouldnt push my luck.Id like to stay for today.If thats okay.I have to work tomorrow.What time do you have to be at work tomorrow?Nine.Ill get you to work by nine tomorrow.What?I want her to stay?Its a surprise to me.Yes, I want her to stay.Ill need to go home tonightI need clean clothes.We can get you some here.She flips her hair and gnaws nervously at her lipagain.What is it?I ask.I need to be home this evening.Boy, shes stubborn.I dont want her to go, but at this stage, with no agreement, I cant insist that she stay.Okay, this evening.Now eat your breakfast.She examines her food.Eat, Anastasia.You didnt eat last night.Im really not hungry, she says.Well, this is frustrating.I would really like you to finish your breakfast.My voice is low.What is it with you and food?she snaps.Oh, baby, you really dont want to know.I told you, I have issues with wasted food.Eat.I glare at her.Dont push me on this, Ana.She gives me a mulish look and starts to eat.As I watch her place a forkful of eggs in her mouth, I relax.Shes quite challenging in her own way.And its unique.Ive never dealt with this.Yes.Thats it.Shes a novelty.Thats the fascinationisnt it?When she finishes her food I take her plate.You cooked, Ill clear.Thats very democratic, she says, arching an eyebrow.Yes.Not my usual style.After Ive done this, well take a bath.And I can test her oral skills.I take a swift breath to control my instant arousal at the thought.Hell.Her phone rings and she wanders to the end of the room, deep in conversation.I pause by the sink and watch her.As she stands against the glass wall, the morning light silhouettes her body in my white shirt.My mouth dries.Shes slim, with long legs, perfect breasts, and a perfect ass.Still on her call, she turns toward me and I pretend my attention is elsewhere.For some reason I dont want her to catch me ogling.Who is it on the phone?I hear Kavanaghs name mentioned and I tense.What is she saying?Our eyes lock.What are you saying, Ana?She turns away and a moment later hangs up, then walks back toward me, her hips swaying in a soft, seductive rhythm beneath my shirt.Should I tell her what I can see?The NDA, does it cover everything?she asks, halting me in my tracks as I shut the pantry cupboard.Why?Wheres she going with this?What has she said to Kavanagh?She takes a deep breath.Well, I have a few questions, you know, about sex.And Id like to ask Kate.You can ask me.Christian, with all due respect She stops.Shes embarrassed?Its just about mechanics.I wont mention the Red Room of Pain, she says in a rush.Red Room of Pain?What the hell?Its mostly about pleasure, Anastasia.Believe me.Besides, your roommate is making the beast with two backs with my brother.Id really rather you didnt.I dont want Elliot to know anything about my sex life.Hed never let me live it down.Does your family know about yourum, predilection?No.Its none of their business.Shes burning to ask something.What do you want to know?I ask, standing in front of her, scrutinizing her face.What is it, Ana?Nothing specific at the moment, she whispers.Well, we can start with: how was last night for you?My breathing shallows as I wait for her answer.Our whole deal could hang on her response.Good, she says, and gives me a soft, sexy smile.Its what I want to hear.For me, too.Ive never had vanilla sex before.Theres a lot to be said for it.But then, maybe its because its with you.Her surprise and pleasure at my words are obvious.I brush her plump lower lip with my thumb.Im itching to touch heragain.Come, lets have a bath.I kiss her and take her into my bathroom.Stay there, I order, turning the faucet, then adding scented oil to the steaming water.The tub fills quickly as she watches me.Normally, I would expect any woman I was about to bathe with to have her eyes cast down in modesty.But not Ana.She doesnt drop her gaze, and her eyes glow with anticipation and curiosity.But she has her arms wrapped around herself; shes shy.Its arousing.And to think shes never bathed with a man.I can claim another first.When the bath is full I peel off my T shirt and hold out my hand.Miss Steele.She accepts my invitation and steps into the bath.Turn around, face me, I instruct.I know that lip is delicious, I can attest to that, but will you stop biting it?Your chewing it makes me want to fuck you, and youre sore, okay?She inhales sharply, releasing her lip.Yeah.Get the picture?Still standing, she gives me an emphatic nod.Good.Shes still wearing my shirt and I take the iPod from the breast pocket and place it by the sink.Water and iPodsnot a clever combination.I grab the hem and pull it off her.Immediately she hangs her head when I step back to admire her.Hey.My voice is gentle and encourages her to peek up at me.Anastasia, youre a very beautiful woman, the whole package.Dont hang your head like youre ashamed.You have nothing to be ashamed of, and its a real joy to stand here and look at you.Holding her chin, I tip her head back.Dont hide from me, baby.You can sit down now.She sits down with indecent haste and winces as her sore body hits the water.Okay  She screws her eyes shut as she lies back, but when she opens them, she looks more relaxed.Why dont you join me?she asks with a coy smile.I think I will.Move forward.Stripping, I climb in behind her, pull her to my chest, and place my legs around hers, my feet over her ankles, and then I pull her legs apart.She wriggles against me, but I ignore her motion and bury my nose in her hair.You smell so good, Anastasia, I whisper.She settles and I grab the body wash from the shelf beside us.Squeezing some into my hand, I work the soap into a lather and start massaging her neck and shoulders.She moans as her head lolls to one side under my tender ministration.You like that?I ask.Hmm, she hums in contentment.I wash her arms and her underarms, then reach my first goal: her breasts.Lord, the feel of her.She has perfect breasts.I knead and tease them.She groans and flexes her hips and her breathing accelerates.Shes aroused.My body responds in kind, growing beneath her.My hands skim over her torso and her belly toward my second goal.Before I reach her pubic hair I stop and grab a washcloth.Squirting some soap onto the cloth, I begin the slow process of washing between her legs.Gentle, slow but sure, rubbing, washing, cleaning, stimulating.She starts to pant and her hips move in synchronization with my hand.Her head resting against my shoulder, her eyes closed, her mouth open in a silent moan as she surrenders to my relentless fingers.Feel it, baby.I run my teeth along her earlobe.Feel it for me.Oh, please, she whines, and she tries to straighten her legs, but I have them pinioned under mine.Enough.Now that shes all worked up into a lather Im ready to proceed.I think youre clean enough now, I announce, and take my hands off of her.Why are you stopping?she protests, her eyes fluttering open, revealing frustration and disappointment.Because I have other plans for you, Anastasia.Shes panting and, if Im not mistaken, pouting.Good.Turn around.I need washing, too.She does, her face rosy, her eyes bright, pupils large.Lifting my hips, I grab my cock.I want you to become well acquainted, on first name terms, if you will, with my favorite and most cherished part of my body.Im very attached to this.Her mouth drops open as she looks from my penis to my faceand back again.I cant help my wicked grin.Her face is a picture of maidenly outrage.But as she stares, her expression changes.First thoughtful, then assessing, and when her eyes meet mine, the challenge in them is clear.Oh, bring it on, Miss Steele.Her smile is one of delight as she reaches for the body wash.Taking her sweet time, she drizzles some of the soap into her palm and, without taking her eyes off mine, rubs her hands together.Her lips part and she bites her bottom lip, running her tongue across the little indentations left by her teeth.Ana Steele, seductress!My cock responds in appreciation, hardening further.Reaching forward, she grabs me, her hand fisting around me.My breath hisses out through clenched teeth and I close my eyes, savoring the moment.Here, I dont mind being touched.No, I dont mind at allPlacing my hand over hers, I show her what to do.Like this.My voice is hoarse as I guide her.She tightens her hold around me and her hand moves up and down beneath mine.Oh yes.Thats right, baby.I release her and let her continue, closing my eyes and surrendering to the rhythm shes set.Oh, God.What is it about her inexperience that is so arousing?Is it that Im enjoying all her firsts?Suddenly she draws me into her mouth, sucking hard, her tongue torturing me.Fuck.WhoaAna.She sucks harder; her eyes are alight with feminine cunning.This is her revenge, her tit for tat.She looks stunning.Christ, I growl, and close my eyes so I dont come immediately.She continues her sweet torture, and as her confidence grows I flex my hips, pushing myself farther into her mouth.How far can I go, baby?Watching her is stimulating, so stimulating.I grab her hair and start to work her mouth as she supports herself with her hands on my thighs.Oh.Baby.That.Feels.Good.She confines her teeth behind her lips and pulls me into her mouth once more.Ah!I groan, and wonder how deep shell allow me.Her mouth torments me, her shielded teeth squeezing hard.And I want more.Jesus.How far can you go?Her eyes meet mine and she frowns.Then, with a look of determination, she slides down on me until I hit the back of her throat.Fuck.Anastasia, Im going to come in your mouth, I warn her, breathless.If you dont want me to, stop now.I thrust into her again and again, watching my cock disappear and reappear from her mouth.Its beyond erotic.Im so close.Suddenly she bares her teeth, gently squeezing me, and Im undone, ejaculating into the back of her throat, crying out my pleasure.Fuck.My breathing is labored.Shes completely disarmed meagain!When I open my eyes shes glowing with pride.As she should be.That was one hell of a blow job.Dont you have a gag reflex?I marvel at her as I catch my breath.Christ, Anathat wasgood, really good.Unexpected, though.You know, you never cease to amaze me.Praise for a job well done.Wait, that was so good, perhaps she has some experience after all.Have you done that before?I ask, and Im not sure I want to know.No, she says with obvious pride.Good.I hope my relief is not too obvious.Yet another first, Miss Steele.Well, you get an A in oral skills.Come, lets go to bed, I owe you an orgasm.I climb out of the bath a little dazed and wrap a towel around my waist.Grabbing another, I hold it up and help her out of the bath, swathing her in it so shes trapped.I hold her against me, kissing her, really kissing her.Exploring her mouth with my tongue.I taste my ejaculate in her mouth.Grasping her head, I deepen the kiss.I want her.All of her.Her body and soul.I want her to be mine.Staring down into bemused eyes, I implore her.Say yes.To what?she whispers.Yes to our arrangement.To being mine.Please, Ana.And its the closest Ive come to begging in a long time.I kiss her again, pouring my fervor into my kiss.When I take her hand, she looks dazed.Dazzle her further, Grey.In my bedroom, I release her.Trust me?I ask.She nods.Good girl.Good.Beautiful.Girl.I head into my closet to select one of my ties.When Im back in front of her, I take her towel and drop it on the floor.Hold your hands together in front of you.She licks her lips in what I think is a moment of uncertainty, then holds out her hands.Swiftly I bind her wrists together with the tie.I test the knot.Yes.Its secure.Time for more training, Miss Steele.Her lips part as she inhalesshes excited.Gently I tug both her braids.You look so young with these.But theyre not going to stop me.I drop my towel.Oh, Anastasia, what shall I do to you?I grasp her upper arms and push her gently back on the bed, keeping hold of her so that she doesnt fall.Once shes prostrate, I lie down beside her, grab her fists, and raise them above her head.Keep your hands up here, dont move them.Understand?She swallows.Answer me.I wont move my hands, she says, her voice husky.Good girl.I cant help my smile.She lies beside me, wrists bound, helpless.Mine.Not quite to do with as I wishyetbut getting there.Leaning down, I kiss her lightly and let her know that Ill kiss her all over.She sighs as my lips move from the base of her ear down to the hollow at the bottom of her neck.Im rewarded with her appreciative moan.Abruptly she lowers her arms so that they circle my neck.No.No.No.This will not do, Miss Steele.Glaring down at her, I place them firmly back above her head.Dont move your hands, or we just have to start all over again.I want to touch you, she whispers.I know.But you cant.Keep your hands above your head.Her lips are parted and her chest is heaving with each rapid breath.Shes turned on.Good.Cupping her chin, I start kissing my way down her body.My hand travels over her breasts, my lips in hot pursuit.With one hand on her belly, holding her in place, I pay homage to each of her nipples, sucking and nipping gently, delighting in their hardening response.She mewls and her hips start to move.Keep still, I warn against her skin.I plant kisses across her belly, where my tongue explores the taste and depth of her navel.Ah, she moans and squirms.I will have to teach her to keep still  My teeth graze her skin.Hmm.You are so sweet, Miss Steele.I gently nip between her navel and pubic hair, then sit up between her legs.Grabbing both her ankles, I spread her legs wide.Like this, naked, vulnerable, she is a glorious sight to behold.Holding her left foot, I bend her knee and raise her toes to my lips, watching her face as I do.I kiss each toe, then bite the soft pad on each.Her eyes are wide and her mouth is open, moving alternately from a small to a capital O.  When I bite the pad on her little toe a little harder, her pelvis flexes and she whimpers.I run my tongue over her instep to her ankle.She scrunches her eyes closed, her head twisting from side to side, as I continue to torment her.Oh, please, she begs when I suck and bite her little toe.All good things, Miss Steele, I tease.When I get to her knee, I dont stop but continue, licking, sucking, and biting up the inside of her thigh, spreading her legs wide as I do.She trembles, in shock, anticipating my tongue at the apex of her thighs.Oh nonot yet, Miss Steele.I return my attentions to her left leg, kissing and nipping from her knee up the inside of her thigh.She tenses when I finally lie between her legs.But she keeps her arms raised.Good girl.Gently, I run my nose up and down her vulva.She writhes beneath me.I stop.She has to learn to keep still.She raises her head to look at me.Do you know how intoxicating you smell, Miss Steele?Holding her stare with my own, I push my nose into her pubic hair and breathe deeply.Her head flops back in the bed and she groans.I blow gently up and down over her pubic hair.I like this, I mutter.Its been a long time since Ive seen pubic hair up close and personal like this.I tug it gently.Perhaps well keep this.Though its no good for wax play  Oh, please, she pleads.Hmm, I like it when you beg me, Anastasia.She moans.Tit for tat is not my usual style, Miss Steele, I whisper against her flesh.But youve pleased me today, and you should be rewarded.And I hold down her thighs, opening her up to my tongue, and slowly start circling her clitoris.She cries out, her body rising off the bed.But I dont stop.My tongue is ruthless.Her legs stiffen, her toes pointed.Ah, shes close, and slowly I slip my middle finger inside her.Shes wet.Wet and waiting.Oh, baby.I love that youre so wet for me.I start to move my finger clockwise, stretching her.My tongue continues to torment her clitoris, over and over.She stiffens beneath me and finally cries out as her orgasm crashes through her.Yes!I kneel up and grab a condom.Once its on, slowly I ease myself into her.Fuck, she feels good.Hows this?I check.Fine.Good.Her voice is hoarse.OhI start to move, reveling in the feel of her around me, beneath me.Again and again, faster and faster, losing myself in this woman.I want her to come again.I want her sated.I want her happy.Finally, she stiffens once more and whimpers.Come for me, baby, I utter through clenched teeth, and she detonates around me.Thank fuck, I cry, and let go, finding my own sweet release.Briefly I collapse on her, glorying in her softness.She moves her hands so they are around my neck, but because shes tied she cant touch me.Taking a deep breath, I rest my weight on my arms and stare down at her in wonder.See how good we are together?If you give yourself to me, it will be so much better.Trust me, Anastasia, I can take you places you dont even know exist.Our foreheads touch and I close my eyes.Please say yes.We hear voices outside the door.What the hell?Its Taylor and Grace.Shit!Its my mother.Ana cringes as I pull out of her.Leaping out of bed, I throw the condom in the wastepaper basket.What the hell is my mother doing here?Taylor has diverted her, thank heaven.Well, shes about to get a surprise.Ana is still prostrate on the bed.Come on, we need to get dressedthats if you want to meet my mother.I smile at Ana as I pull on my jeans.She looks adorable.ChristianI cant move, she protests, but shes grinning, too.Leaning down, I undo the tie and kiss her forehead.My mother is going to be thrilled.Another first, I whisper, unable to shift my grin.I have no clean clothes in here.I slip on a white T shirt, and when I turn around shes sitting up, hugging her knees.Perhaps I should stay here.Oh no you dont, I warn.You can wear something of mine.I like her wearing my clothes.Her face falls.Anastasia, you could be wearing a sack and youd look lovely.Please dont worry.Id like you to meet my mother.Get dressed.Ill just go and calm her down.Ill expect you in that room in five minutes, otherwise Ill come and drag you out of here myself in whatever youre wearing.My T shirts are in this drawer.My shirts are in the closet.Help yourself.Her eyes widen.Yes.Im serious, baby.Cautioning her with a pointed look, I open the door and exit to find my mother.Grace is standing in the corridor opposite the foyer door, and Taylor is talking to her.Her face lights up when she sees me.Darling, I had no idea you might have company, she exclaims, and she looks a little embarrassed.Hello, Mother.I kiss her proffered cheek.Ill deal with her from here, I say to Taylor.Yes, Mr.Grey.He nods, looking exasperated, and heads back into his office.Thank you, Taylor, Grace calls after him, then turns her full attention to me.Deal with me?she says in rebuke.I was shopping downtown and I thought I might pop in for coffee.She stops.If Id known you werent alone She shrugs in an awkward, girlish way.She has often stopped by for coffee and there was a woman hereshe just never knew.Shell join us in a moment, I admit, putting her out of her misery.Do you want to sit down?I wave in the direction of the sofa.She?Yes, Mother.She.My tone is dry as I try not to laugh.And for once shes silent as she wanders through the living room.I see youve had breakfast, she observes, eyeing the unwashed pans.Would you like some coffee?No.Thank you, darling.She sits down.Ill meet yourfriend and then Ill go.I dont want to interrupt you.I had a feeling that youd be slaving away in your study.You work too hard, darling.I thought I might drag you away.She looks almost apologetic when I join her on the sofa.Dont worry.Im thoroughly amused by her reaction.Why arent you at church this morning?Carrick had to work, so we thought wed go to evening Mass.I suppose its too much to hope that youll come with us.I raise an eyebrow in cynical contempt.Mother, you know thats not for me.God and I turned our backs on each other a long time ago.She sighs, but then Ana appearsdressed in her own clothes, standing shyly in the doorway.The tension between mother and son is averted, and I stand in relief.Here she is.Grace turns and gets to her feet.Mother, this is Anastasia Steele.Anastasia, this is Grace Trevelyan Grey.They shake hands.What a pleasure to meet you, Grace says with a little too much enthusiasm for my liking.Dr.Trevelyan Grey, Ana says politely.Call me Grace, she says, all at once amiable and informal.What?Already?Grace continues, Im usually Dr.Trevelyan, and Mrs.Grey is my mother in law.She winks at Ana and sits down.I motion to Ana and pat the cushion beside me, and she comes and takes a seat.So how did you two meet?Grace asks.Anastasia interviewed me for the student paper at WSU because Im conferring the degrees there this week.So youre graduating this week?Grace beams at Ana.Yes.Anas cell phone starts ringing and she excuses herself to answer it.And Ill be giving the commencement address, I say to Grace, but my attention is on Ana.Who is it?Look, Jos, nows not a good time, I hear her say.That fucking photographer.What does he want?I left a message for Elliot, then found out he was in Portland.I havent seen him since last week, Grace is saying.Ana hangs up.Grace continues as Ana approaches us again, and Elliot called to say you were aroundI havent seen you for two weeks, darling.Did he now?I remark.What does the photographer want?I thought we might have lunch together, but I can see you have other plans, and I dont want to interrupt your day.Grace stands, and for once Im grateful that shes intuitive and can read a situation.She offers me her cheek again.I kiss her good bye.I have to drive Anastasia back to Portland.Of course, darling.Grace turns her brightand if Im not mistaken, gratefulsmile on Ana.Its irritating.Anastasia, its been such a pleasure.Grace beams and takes Anas hand.I do hope we meet again.Mrs.Grey?Taylor appears on the threshold of the room.Thank you, Taylor, Grace responds, and he escorts her from the room and through the double doors to the foyer.Well, that was interesting.My mothers always thought I was gay.But as shes always respected my boundaries, shes never asked me.Well, now she knows.Ana is worrying her bottom lip, radiating anxietyas she should be.So the photographer called?I sound gruff.Yes.What did he want?Just to apologize, you knowfor Friday.I see.Maybe he wants another shot at her.The thought is displeasing.Taylor clears his throat.Mr.Grey, theres an issue with the Darfur shipment.Shit.This is what I get for not checking my e mail this morning.Ive been too preoccupied with Ana.Charlie Tango back at Boeing Field?I ask Taylor.Yes, sir.Taylor acknowledges Ana with a nod.Miss Steele.She gives him a broad smile and he leaves.Does he live here?Taylor?Ana asks.Yes.Heading into the kitchen, I pick up my phone and quickly check my e mail.Theres a flagged message from Ros and a couple of texts.I call her immediately.Ros, whats the issue?Christian, hi.The report back from Darfur is not good.They cant guarantee the safety of the shipments or road crew, and the State Department isnt willing to sanction the relief without the NGOs backing.Fuck this.Im not having either crew put at risk.Ros knows this.We could try and pull in mercenaries, she says.No, cancel  But the cost, she protests.Well air drop instead.I knew thats what youd say, Christian.I have a plan in the works.It will be costly.In the meantime, the containers can go to Rotterdam out of Philly and we can take it from there.Thats it.Good.I hang up.More support from the State Department would be helpful.I resolve to call Blandino to discuss this further.My attention reverts to Miss Steele, whos standing in my living room, regarding me warily.I need to get us back on track.Yes.The contract.Thats the next step in our negotiation.In my study, I gather the papers that are on my desk and stuff them into a manila envelope.Anas not moved from where I left her in the living room.Perhaps shes been thinking about the photographermy mood takes a nosedive.This is the contract.I hold up the envelope.Read it, and well discuss it next weekend.May I suggest you do some research, so you know whats involved?She looks from the manila envelope to me, her face pale.Thats if you agree, and I really hope you do, I add.Research?Youll be amazed what you can find on the Internet.She frowns.What is it?I ask.I dont have a computer.I usually use the computers at school.Ill see if I can use Kates laptop.No computer?How can a student not have a computer?Is she that broke?I hand her the envelope.Im sure I can, umlend you one.Get your things, well drive back to Portland and grab some lunch on the way.I need to dress.Ill just make a call, she says, her voice soft and hesitant.The photographer?I snap.She looks guilty.What the hell?I dont like to share, Miss Steele.Remember that.I storm out of the room before I say anything else.Is she hung up on him?Was she just using me to break her in?Fuck.Maybe its the money.Thats a depressing thoughtthough she doesnt strike me as a gold digger.She was quite vehement about me not buying her any clothing.I remove my jeans and put on a pair of boxer briefs.My Brioni tie is on the floor.I stoop to pick it up.She took to being tied up wellTheres hope, Grey.Hope.I stuff the tie and two others into a messenger bag along with socks, underwear, and condoms.What am I doing?Deep down I know Im going to stay at The Heathman all next weekto be near her.I gather a couple of suits and shirts that Taylor can bring down later in the week.Ill need one for the graduation ceremony.I slip on some clean jeans and grab a leather jacket, and my phone buzzes.Its a text from Elliot.Im driving back today in your car.Hope that doesnt screw up your plans.I text back.No.Im coming back to Portland now.Let Taylor know when you arrive.I buzz Taylor through the internal phone system.Mr.Grey?Elliot is bringing the SUV back sometime this afternoon.Bring it down to Portland tomorrow.Im going to stay at The Heathman until the graduation ceremony.Ive left some clothes that Id like you to bring down as well.Yes, sir.And call Audi.I may need the A3 sooner than I thought.Its ready, Mr.Grey.Oh.Good.Thanks.So thats the car taken care of; now its the computer.I call Barney, assuming hell be in his office, and knowing hell have a state of the art laptop lying around.Mr.Grey?he answers.What are you doing in the office, Barney?Its Sunday.Im working on the tablet design.The solar cell issue is bugging me.You need a home life.Barney has the grace to laugh.What can I do for you, Mr.Grey?Do you have any new laptops?I have two right here from Apple.Great.I need one.Sure thing.Can you set it up with an e mail account for Anastasia Steele?Shell be the owner.How are you spelling Steal?S. T. E. E. L. E.   Cool.Great.Andrea will be in touch today to arrange delivery.Sure thing, sir.Thanks, Barneyand go home.Yes, sir.I text Andrea with instructions to send the laptop to Anas home address, then return to the living room.Ana is sitting on the sofa, fidgeting with her fingers.She gives me a cautious look and rises.Ready?I ask.She nods.Taylor appears from his office.Tomorrow, then, I tell him.Yes, sir.Which car are you taking, sir?The R8.Safe trip, Mr.Grey.Miss Steele, Taylor says, as he opens the foyer doors for us.Ana fidgets beside me as we wait for the elevator, her teeth on her plump lower lip.It reminds me of her teeth on my cock.What is it, Anastasia?I ask, as I reach out and pluck her chin.Stop biting your lip, or I will fuck you in the elevator, and I dont care who gets in with us, I growl.Shes shocked, I thinkthough why would she be after all weve doneMy mood softens.Christian, I have a problem, she says.Oh?In the elevator I press the button for the garage.W Well, she stutters, uncertain.Then she squares her shoulders.I need to talk to Kate.Ive so many questions about sex, and youre too involved.If you want me to do all these things, how do I know?She stops, as if weighing her words.I just dont have any terms of reference.Not this again.Weve been over this.I dont want her talking to anyone.Shes signed an NDA.But shes asked, again.So it must be important to her.Talk to her if you must.Make sure she doesnt mention anything to Elliot.She wouldnt do that, and I wouldnt tell you anything she tells me about Elliotif she were to tell me anything, she insists.I remind her that Im not interested in Elliots sex life but agree that she can talk about what weve done so far.Her roommate would have my balls if she knew my real intentions.Okay, Ana says, and gives me a bright smile.The sooner I have your submission the better, and we can stop all this.Stop all what?You, defying me.I kiss her quickly and her lips on mine immediately make me feel better.Nice car, she says, as we approach the R8 in the underground garage.I know.I flash her a quick grin, and Im rewarded with another smilebefore she rolls her eyes.I open the door for her, wondering if I should comment about the eye rolling.So what sort of car is this?she asks, when Im behind the wheel.Its an Audi R8 Spyder.Its a lovely day; we can take the top down.Theres a baseball cap in there.In fact there should be two.I start the ignition and retract the roof, and the Boss fills the car.Gotta love Bruce.I grin at Ana and steer the R8 out of her safe place in the garage.Weaving in and out of the traffic on I 5, we head toward Portland.Ana is quiet, listening to the music and staring out the window.Its difficult to see her expression, behind oversized Wayfarers and under my Mariners cap.The wind whistles over us as we speed past Boeing Field.So far, this weekend has been unexpected.But what did I expect?I thought wed have dinner, discuss the contract, and then what?Perhaps fucking her was inevitable.I glance across at her.YesAnd I want to fuck her again.I wish I knew what she was thinking.She gives little away, but Ive learned some things about Ana.In spite of her inexperience, shes willing to learn.Who would have thought that under that shy exterior she has the soul of a siren?An image of her lips around my dick comes to mind and I suppress a moan.Yeahshes more than willing.The thought is arousing.I hope I can see her before next weekend.Even now Im itching to touch her again.Reaching across, I put my hand on her knee.Hungry?Not particularly, she responds, subdued.This is getting old.You must eat, Anastasia.I know a great place near Olympia.Well stop there.CUISINE SAUVAGE IS SMALL, and crowded with couples and families enjoying Sunday brunch.With Anas hand in mine, we follow the hostess to our table.The last time I came here was with Elena.I wonder what shed make of Anastasia.Ive not been here for a while.We dont get a choicethey cook whatever theyve caught or gathered, I say, grimacing, feigning my horror.Ana laughs.Why do I feel ten feet tall when I make her laugh?Two glasses of the pinot grigio, I order from the waitress, whos making eyes at me from beneath blond bangs.Its annoying.Ana scowls.What?I ask, wondering if the waitress is annoying her, too.I wanted a Diet Coke.Why didnt you say so?I frown.The pinot grigio here is a decent wine.It will go well with the meal, whatever we get.Whatever we get?she asks, her eyes round with alarm.Yes.And I give her my megawatt smile to make amends for not letting her order her own drink.Im just not used to askingMy mother liked you, I add, hoping this will please her and remembering Graces reaction to Ana.Really?she says, looking flattered.Oh yes.Shes always thought I was gay.Why?Because shes never seen me with a girl.Oh, not even one of the fifteen?You remembered.No, none of the fifteen.Oh.Yesonly you, baby.The thought is unsettling.You know, Anastasia, its been a weekend of firsts for me, too.It has?Ive never slept with anyone, never had sex in my bed, never flown a girl in Charlie Tango, never introduced a woman to my mother.What are you doing to me?Yeah.What the hell are you doing to me?This isnt me.The waitress brings us our chilled wine, and Ana immediately takes a quick sip, her bright eyes on me.Ive really enjoyed this weekend, she says, with bashful delight in her voice.I have, too, and I realize I havent enjoyed a weekend for a whilesince Susannah and I parted ways.I tell her so.Whats vanilla sex?she asks.I laugh at her unexpected question and complete change of topic.Just straightforward sex, Anastasia.No toys, no add ons.I shrug.You knowwell, actually you dont, but thats what it means.Oh, she says, and she looks a little crestfallen.What now?The waitress diverts us, putting down two soup bowls full of greenery.Nettle soup, she announces, and struts back into the kitchen.We glance at each other, then back at the soup.A quick taste informs us both that its delicious.Ana giggles at my exaggerated expression of relief.Thats a lovely sound, I say softly.Why have you never had vanilla sex before?Have you always done, what youve done?Shes as inquisitive as ever.Sort of.And then I wonder if I should expand on this.More than anything, I want her to be forthcoming with me; I want her to trust me.Im never this candid, but I think I can trust her so I choose my words carefully.One of my mothers friends seduced me when I was fifteen.Oh.Anas spoon pauses midway from the bowl to her mouth.She had very particular tastes.I was her submissive for six years.Oh, she breathes.So I do know what it involves, Anastasia.More than you know.I didnt really have a run of the mill introduction to sex.I couldnt be touched.I still cant.I wait for her reaction but she continues with her soup, mulling over this tidbit of information.So you never dated anyone in college?she asks, when shes finished her last spoonful.No.The waitress interrupts us to clear our empty bowls.Ana waits for her to leave.Why?Do you really want to know?Yes.I didnt want to.She was all I wanted, needed.And besides, shed have beaten the shit out of me.She blinks a couple of times as she absorbs this news.So if she was a friend of your mothers, how old was she?Old enough to know better.Do you still see her?She sounds shocked.Yes.Do you stiller She blushes crimson, her mouth turned down.No, I say quickly.I dont want her to have the wrong idea about my relationship with Elena.Shes a very good friend, I reassure her.Oh.Does your mother know?Of course not.My mother would kill meand Elena, too.The waitress returns with the main entre: venison.Ana takes a long sip of her wine.But it cant have been full time?Shes ignoring her food.Well, it was, though I didnt see her all the time.It wasdifficult.After all, I was still at school and then at college.Eat up, Anastasia.Im really not hungry, Christian, she says.I narrow my eyes.Eat.I keep my voice low, as I try to check my temper.Give me a moment, she says, her tone as quiet as mine.Whats her problem?Elena?Okay, I agree, wondering if Ive told her too much, and I take a bite of my venison.Finally, she picks up her cutlery and starts eating.Good.Is this what our, umrelationship will be like?she asks.You ordering me around?She scrutinizes the plate of food in front of her.Yes.I see.She tosses her ponytail over her shoulder.And whats more, youll want me to.Its a big step, she says.It is.I close my eyes.I want to do this with her, now more than ever.What can I say to convince her to give our arrangement a try?Anastasia, you have to go with your gut.Do the research, read the contract.Im happy to discuss any aspect.Ill be in Portland until Friday if you want to talk about it before then.Call memaybe we can have dinnersay, Wednesday?I really want to make this work.In fact, Ive never wanted anything as much as I want this.Whoa.Big speech, Grey.Did you just ask her on a date?What happened to the fifteen?she asks.Various things, but it boils down to incompatibility.And you think that I might be compatible with you?Yes.I hope so  So youre not seeing any of them anymore?No, Anastasia, Im not.I am monogamous in my relationships.I see.Do the research, Anastasia.She puts her knife and fork down, signaling that shes finished her meal.Thats it?Thats all youre going to eat?She nods, placing her hands in her lap, and her mouth sets in that mulish way she hasand I know it will be a fight to persuade her to clean her plate.No wonder shes so slim.Her eating issues will be something to work on, if she agrees to be mine.As I continue to eat, her eyes dart to me every few seconds and a slow flush stains her cheeks.Oh, whats this?Id give anything to know what youre thinking right at this moment.Shes clearly thinking about sex.I can guess, I tease.Im glad you cant read my mind.Your mind, no, Anastasia, but your bodythat Ive gotten to know quite well since yesterday.I give her a wolfish grin and ask for the check.When we leave, her hand is firmly in mine.Shes quietdeep in thought, it seemsand remains so all the way to Vancouver.Ive given her a great deal to think about.But shes also given me a great deal to think about.Will she want to do this with me?Damn, I hope so.Its still light when we arrive at her home, but the sun is sinking to the horizon and shining pink and pearl light on Mount St.Helens.Ana and Kate live in a scenic spot with an amazing view.Do you want to come in?she asks, after Ive switched off the engine.No.I have work to do.I know that if I accept her invitation Ill be crossing a line Im not prepared to cross.Im not boyfriend materialand I dont want to give her any false expectations of the kind of relationship shell have with me.Her face falls and, deflated, she looks away.She doesnt want me to go.Its humbling.Reaching across, I grasp her hand and kiss her knuckles, hoping to take the sting out of my rejection.Thank you for this weekend, Anastasia.Its beenthe best.She turns shining eyes to me.Wednesday?I continue.Ill pick you up from work, from wherever?Wednesday, she says, and the hope in her voice is disconcerting.Shit.Its not a date.I kiss her hand again and climb out of the car to open her door.I have to get out of here before I do something Ill regret.When she gets out of the car, she brightens, at odds with how she looked a moment ago.She marches up to her front door but before reaching the steps she turns suddenly.Oh, by the way, Im wearing your underwear, she says in triumph, and she yanks the waistband up so I can see the words Polo and Ralph peeking over her jeans.Shes stolen my underwear!Im stunned.And in that instant I want nothing more than to see her in my boxer briefsand only them.She tosses back her hair and swaggers into her apartment, leaving me standing on the curb, staring like a fool.Shaking my head, I climb back into the car, and as I start the engine I cannot help my shit eating grin.I hope she says yes.I FINISH MY WORK and take a sip of the fine Sancerre, delivered from room service by the woman with dark, dark eyes.Trawling through my e mails and answering where required has been a welcome distraction from thoughts of Anastasia.And now Im pleasantly tired.Is it the five hours of work?Or all the sexual activity last night and this morning?Memories of the delectable Miss Steele invade my mind: in Charlie Tango, in my bed, in my bath, dancing around my kitchen.And to think it all started here on Fridayand now shes considering my proposal.Has she read the contract?Is she doing her homework?I check my phone once again for a text or a missed call but, of course, theres nothing.Will she agree?I hope so  Andrea has sent me Anas new e mail address and assured me the laptop will be delivered tomorrow morning.With that in mind, I type out an e mail.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Your New Computer  Date: May 22 2011 23:15  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele,  I trust you slept well.I hope that you put this laptop to good use, as discussed.I look forward to dinner Wednesday.Happy to answer any questions before then, via e mail, should you so desire.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.The e mail doesnt bounce, so the address is live.I wonder how Ana will react in the morning when she reads it.I hope she likes the laptop.Guess Ill know tomorrow.Picking up my latest read, I settle onto the sofa.Its a book by two renowned economists who examine why the poor think and behave the way they do.An image of a young woman brushing out her long, dark hair comes to mind; her hair shines in the light from the cracked, yellowed window, and the air is filled with dancing dust motes.Shes singing softly, like a child.I shudder.Dont go there, Grey.I open the book and start to read.MONDAY, MAY 23, 2011    * * *      Its after one in the morning when I go to bed.Staring at the ceiling, Im tired, relaxed, but also excited, anticipating what the week will bring.I hope to have a new project: Miss Anastasia Steele.MY FEET POUND THE sidewalk on Main Street as I run toward the river.Its 6:35 in the morning and the suns rays are shimmering through the high rise buildings.The sidewalk trees are newly green with spring leaves; the air is clean, the traffic quiet.Ive slept well.O Fortuna from Orffs Carmina Burana is blaring in my ears.Today the streets are paved with possibility.Will she respond to my e mail?Its too early, far too early for any response, but feeling lighter than I have for weeks, I run past the statue of the elk and toward the Willamette.BY 7:45 IM IN front of my laptop, having showered and ordered breakfast.I e mail Andrea to let her know Ill be working from Portland for the week and to ask her to reschedule any meetings so that they can take place by phone or videoconference.I e mail Gail to let her know I wont be home until Thursday evening at the earliest.Then I work through my inbox and find among other things a proposal for a joint venture with a shipyard in Taiwan.I forward it to Ros to add to the agenda of items we need to discuss.Then I turn to my other outstanding matter: Elena.Shes texted me a couple of times over the weekend and Ive not replied.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: The Weekend  Date: May 23 2011 08:15  To: Elena Lincoln  Good morning, Elena.Sorry not to get back to you.Ive been busy all weekend, and Ill be in Portland all this week.I dont know about next weekend, either, but if Im free, Ill let you know.Latest results for the beauty business look promising.Good going, Maam  Best  C   Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.I press send, wondering again what Elena would make of Anaand vice versa.Theres a ping from my laptop as a new e mail arrives.Its from Ana.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Your New Computer (on loan)  Date: May 23 2011 08:20  To: Christian Grey  I slept very well, thank youfor some strange reasonSir.I understood that this computer was on loan, ergo not mine.Ana  Sir with a capital S; the girl has been reading, and possibly researching.And shes still talking to me.I grin stupidly at the e mail.This is good news.Though she is also telling me that she doesnt want the computer.Well, thats frustrating.I shake my head, amused.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Your New Computer (on loan)  Date: May 23 2011 08:22  To: Anastasia Steele  The computer is on loan.Indefinitely, Miss Steele.I note from your tone that you have read the documentation I gave you.Do you have any questions so far?Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.I hit send.How long will it be before she responds?I resume reading my e mail as a distraction while I wait for her reply.Theres an executive summary from Fred, the head of my telecom division, about the development of our solar powered tabletone of my pet projects.Its ambitious but few of my business ventures matter more than this one and Im excited about it.Bringing affordable first world technology to the third world is something Im determined to do.Theres a ping from my computer.Another e mail from Miss Steele.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Inquiring Minds  Date: May 23 2011 08:25  To: Christian Grey  I have many questions, but not suitable for e mail, and some of us have to work for a living.I do not want or need a computer indefinitely.Until later, good day.Sir.Ana  The tone of her e mail makes me smile, but it seems shes off to work, so this might be the last one for a while.Her reluctance to accept the damned computer is annoying.But I suppose it shows shes not acquisitive.Shes no gold diggerrare among the women Ive knownyet Leila was the same.Sir, I am not deserving of this beautiful dress.You are.Take it.And Ill not hear another word on this.Understand?Yes, Master.Good.And the style will suit you.Ah, Leila.She was a good submissive, but she became too attached and I was the wrong man.Fortunately, that wasnt for long.Shes married now and happy.I turn my attention back to Anas e mail and reread.Some of us have to work for a living.The sassy wench is implying I dont do any work.Well to hell with that!I spy Freds rather dry summary report open on my desktop and decide to set the record straight with Ana.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Your New Computer

The first one was so well deserved.;)   Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.Her response is not as immediate, and feeling a little crestfallen, I turn away and decide to go on my run.But as I open the door the ping from my inbox pulls me back.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Internet Research  Date: May 23 2011 17:59  To: Christian Grey  Mr.Grey,  What would you suggest I put into a search engine?Ana  Shit!Why didnt I think about this?I could have given her some books.Numerous websites spring to mindbut I dont want to frighten her off.Perhaps she should start with the most vanilla    * * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Internet Research  Date: May 23 2011 18:02  To: Anastasia Steele  Miss Steele,  Always start with Wikipedia.No more e mails unless you have questions.Understood?Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.I get up from my desk, thinking she wont respond, but as usual she surprises me and does.I cant resist.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Bossy!Date: May 23 2011 18:04  To: Christian Grey  YesSir.You are so bossy.Ana  Damned right, baby.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: In Control  Date: May 23 2011 18:06  To: Anastasia Steele  Anastasia, you have no idea.Well, maybe an inkling now.Do the work.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.Show some restraint, Grey.Before she can distract me again, Im out the door.With the Foo Fighters blaring in my ears I run to the river; Ive seen the Willamette at dawn, now I want to see it at dusk.Its a fine evening: couples are walking by the riverside, some sitting on the grass, and a few tourists are cycling up and down the concourse.I avoid them, the music blasting in my ears.Miss Steele has questions.She is still in the gamethis is not a no.Our e mail exchange has given me hope.As I run under the Hawthorne Bridge I reflect on how at ease she is with the written word, more so than when shes speaking.Maybe this is her preferred medium of expression.Well, she has been studying English literature.Im hoping that by the time I get back therell be another e mail, maybe with questions, maybe with some more of her sassy banter.Yeah.Thats something to look forward to.As I sprint down Main Street I dare to hope that shell accept my proposition.The thought is exciting, invigorating even, and I pick up my pace, sprinting back to The Heathman.ITS 8:15 WHEN I sit back in my dining chair.Ive eaten the wild Oregon salmon for dinner, courtesy of Miss Dark, Dark Eyes again, and I still have half a glass of Sancerre to finish.My laptop is open and powered up, should any important e mails arrive.I pick up the report that Ive printed out, on the brownfield sites in Detroit.It would have to be Detroit, I grumble out loud, and start to read.A few minutes later, I hear a ping.Its an e mail with Shocked of WSUV written in the subject line.The heading makes me sit up.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Shocked of WSUV  Date: May 23 2011 20:33  To: Christian Grey  Okay, Ive seen enough.It was nice knowing you.Ana  Shit!I read it again.Fuck.Its a no.I stare at the screen in disbelief.Thats it?No discussion?Nothing.Just It was nice knowing you?What.The.Fuck.I sit back in my chair, dumbfounded.Nice?Nice.NICE.She thought it was more than nice when her head was thrown back as she came.Dont be so hasty, Grey.Maybe its a joke?Some joke!I pull my laptop toward me to write a reply.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: NICE?Date: May 23 2011  To: Anastasia Steele  But as I stare at the screen, my fingers hovering over the keys, I cant think of what to say.How could she dismiss me so easily?Her first fuck.Get it together, Grey.What are your options?Maybe I should pay her a visit, just to make sure its a no.Maybe I can persuade her otherwise.I certainly dont know what to say to this e mail.Perhaps shes looked at some particularly hardcore sites.Why didnt I give her a few books?I dont believe this.She needs to look me in the eye and say no.Yep.I rub my chin as I formulate a plan, and moments later Im in my closet, retrieving my tie.That tie.This deal isnt dead yet.From my messenger bag I take some condoms and slide them into the back pocket of my pants, then grab my jacket and a bottle of white wine from the minibar.Damn, its a chardonnaybut it will have to do.Snatching my room key, I close the door and head toward the elevator to collect my car from the valet.AS I PULL UP in the R8 outside the apartment she shares with Kavanagh, I wonder if this is a wise move.Ive never visited any of my previous submissives at their homesthey always came to me.Im pushing all the boundaries that Ive set for myself.Opening the door of the car and climbing out, Im uneasy; its reckless and too presumptuous of me to come here.Then again, Ive already been here twice, though for only a few minutes.If she does agree, Ill have to manage her expectations.This wont happen again.Getting ahead of yourself, Grey.Youre here because you think its a no.Kavanagh answers when I knock at the door.Shes surprised to see me.Hi, Christian.Ana didnt say you were coming over.She stands aside to let me enter.Shes in her room.Ill call her.No.Id like to surprise her.I give her my most earnest and endearing look and in response she blinks a couple of times.Whoa.That was easy.Who would have thought?How gratifying.Wheres her room?Through there, the first door.She points to a door off the empty living room.Thanks.Leaving my jacket and the chilled wine on one of the packing crates, I open the door to find a small hallway with a couple of rooms off it.I assume one is a bathroom, so I knock on the other door.After a beat, I open it and theres Ana, sitting at a small desk, reading what looks like the contract.She has her earbuds in as she idly drums her fingers to an unheard beat.Standing there for a moment, I watch her.Her face is scrunched in concentration; her hair is braided and shes wearing sweats.Perhaps shes been for a run this eveningperhaps shes suffering from excess energy, too.The thought is pleasing.Her room is small, neat, and girlish: all whites, creams, and baby blues, and bathed in the soft glow of her bedside lamp.Its also a little empty, but I spy a closed packing crate with Anas room scrawled on the top.At least she has a double bedwith a white wrought iron bedstead.Yes.That has possibilities.Ana suddenly jumps, startled by my presence.Yes.Im here because of your e mail.She pulls out her earbuds and the sound of tinny music fills the silence between us.Good evening, Anastasia.She stares at me dumbfounded, her eyes widening.I felt that your e mail warranted a reply in person.I try to keep my voice neutral.Her mouth opens and closes, but she remains mute.Miss Steele is speechless.This I like.May I sit?She nods, continuing to stare in disbelief as I perch on her bed.I wondered what your bedroom would look like, I offer as an icebreaker, though chitchat is not my area of expertise.She scans her room as if seeing it for the first time.Its very serene and peaceful in here, I add, though I feel anything but serene or peaceful right now.I want to know why shes said no to my proposal with no discussion whatsoever.How?she whispers, but she stops, her disbelief still evident in her quiet tone.Im still at The Heathman.She knows this.Would you like a drink?she squeaks.No thank you, Anastasia.Good.Shes found her manners.But I want to get on with the business at hand: her alarming e mail.So, it was nice knowing me?I emphasize the word that offends me most in that sentence.Nice?Really?She examines her hands in her lap, her fingers nervously tapping against her thighs.I thought youd reply by e mail, she says, her voice as small as her room.Are you biting your lower lip deliberately?I inquire, my voice sterner than Id intended.I wasnt aware I was biting my lip, she whispers, her face pale.We gaze at each other.And the air almost crackles between us.Fuck.Cant you feel this, Ana?This tension.This attraction.My breathing shallows as I watch her pupils dilate.Slowly, deliberately, I reach for her hair and gently tug on the elastic, freeing one of her braids.She watches me, captivated, her eyes never leaving mine.I loosen her second braid.So you decided on some exercise?My fingers trace the soft shell of her ear.With great care, I tug and squeeze the plump skin of her earlobe.Shes not wearing earrings, though she does have pierced ears.
