If youre going to let her keep custody of your sons, it will take some getting used to when theres another man in the house.Not all stepdads make decent fathers.Roy started across the lawn, heading back to his vehicle.Where are you going?Mark asked.Roy shook his head as though he didnt want to answer.He opened the car door and looked back over his shoulder.Im going to find Maggie, he said.Im not fooled.I know what youre doing.Youre making me look at the idea of getting a divorce in ways I didnt want to see.Youre right, though.Maggie and I need to work this out.I dont want to lose my wife, and I dont want my sons being raised by another man.Mark joined him and gently slapped Roy across the back.Some things are easier to forgive than others, just like you said, but it takes a big man to forgive a bigger offense.Find your wife, Roy, and do what you can to hold your marriage together.Thats exactly what I plan to do.Once more Mark patted his back.Roy climbed into the car and drove off, and this time there was no spitting gravel.I waited until Roy had disappeared from the driveway before I stepped out from the side of the house.Marks gaze met mine.You handled that well, I told him.He shrugged as if it was no big deal.Sometimes all anyone needs is a little guidance.Anyone do that for you?I asked.He sighed and slowly shook his head.Are we back to that again?he asked, as if growing impatient with me.Actually, no.No?No, I repeated.Roy isnt the only one who took your advice.I did, too.Mark went still, and his gaze rushed back to me.You read Pauls letter?I nodded.It was a beautiful love letter  I found it impossible to add more.The things my husband had written were strictly for me and me alone.My throat started to close up.I wasnt about to get emotional in front of Mark.You dont need to worry, I wont be hounding you for any more of your secrets.Good to know  not that I have any secrets.Right, I murmured mockingly.Marks gaze went to the flowers in my wicker basket.For dinner with my family tomorrow afternoon.I thought Id put together a bouquet for the centerpiece.The hydrangeas are really lovely this year.I had both pink and purple blooms.If you want, Ill fertilize them for you later in the season.No need; I can do it.My budget was limited, and I wasnt willing to pay for anything I could do myself.Mark seemed to read my mind.I didnt plan on charging you.In other words, youre willing to work in the yard out of the goodness of your heart?For a long time, I wasnt convinced Mark had a heart.Not exactly.Ah, the truth comes out, I said, having trouble holding back a smile.I figure I owe you for all the cookies and meals you feed me.Good point, in which case feel free to work in my yard anytime you want.As far as I was concerned, it was a good deal all the way around.I headed to the house and paused on the top step and turned back to Mark.He stood where he was, watching me.Thanks again, I said, for talking sense into Roy.And then I did the oddest thing.I blew Mark a kiss.30     Ellies heart beat so frantically it felt as if it had grown too big for her chest.Even now, as she parked in front of Toms house, she wasnt sure coming to him was the right thing to do.Furthermore, she wasnt entirely sure she was ready to forgive him, despite the excuses and justifications Scott had mentioned.It was the look in her mothers eyes that had convinced her she needed to do this.The message was familiar, and Ellie could read it easily: Dont make the same mistakes I did.Only this time it wasnt a warning not to trust men or to give her heart away.Instead, it was encouragement to be willing to do exactly the opposite, to fall in love, find joy, and be happy.To say Ellie was confused would be grossly understating the facts.For a long time all she did was sit in the vehicle, nervous and unsure, toying with her options, the most appealing of which was to start the engine and drive off.Even now she wasnt sure what she would say to Tom.Thinking it was a lost cause, she inserted the key and started the car, intent on leaving, but then just as quickly changed her mind and turned it off.Her hand remained on the keychain when she saw Tom.He must have noticed her car out front because he stepped onto the porch.He stood there with his hands tucked inside his back jeans pockets, elbows jutting out while he waited.His gaze seemed to focus directly on her.If he hadnt moved outside, Ellie might have given up and driven off.Confronting him wouldnt be easy, but realizing that hed seen her, she felt compelled to act, to do something.Filled with equal parts of dread and anticipation, she got out of the car and stood next to the drivers side for several tense moments.Neither of them moved.Tom continued to stand exactly where he was on the porch, all the while watching her.With her mothers car as a barrier between them, Ellie felt more secure.She willed him to make the first move.He didnt.The look he wore reminded her that shed claimed she never wanted to see him again.The first move had to come from her.Ellie could be stubborn, too, but pride hadnt helped her father or mother, and it wouldnt solve matters for her, either.My dad  Scott came to the inn, she said, slowly moving around the car while keeping her hand on the hood as if she needed it to guide her.He and my mother are still there  theyre talking.Your mother?Ellie nodded.She came by  she was in the area.No need to explain further.Hows it going with the two of them?Good, I think.They discovered that theyd written love letters to each other after they separated that neither of them ever received.Tom walked down the three steps leading to the concrete walkway.Ellie stepped away from the curb.They met halfway between the house and the car, and while it was a short distance, Ellie felt like each one of those steps was a mile in length.She walked with the care of a soldier traversing a minefield.Did you get a chance to have Dad answer any more of your questions?Tom asked.A few.He always loved you, Ellie, always, but he was afraid youd been brainwashed against him.Tom said that as if it explained everything, only it didnt.He could have at least tried.Youre right, but the fact is, your father has a lot of baggage from his first marriage.We all have baggage, Ellie argued.But some more than others.The longer one drags it around, the heavier it seems.Im hoping youre willing to look past that disappointment and appreciate how hard it was for him to meet you, knowing that you might possibly hate him.Ellie didnt see it like that.It seemed wrong to hear Tom defend her father, but then she realized Scott was a safe subject.Discussing the older mans fears and doubts made it easier to avoid talking about their own troubles.Ellie found it interesting that her father had defended Tom.It hurt that Tom had such a strong relationship with him and she didnt.Can we not talk about my father?she asked.Tom agreed.Fine by me.Silence followed, as though they were each afraid to venture beyond to anything else.Finally, Ellie couldnt bear the tension any longer.You hurt me, she whispered.You took my feelings for you and used them for your own selfish purposes.I know, and Im sorry.He didnt deny it, didnt make excuses.Sorry, she repeated slowly, thinking it was such a weak, insipid word.I take that back.He stood directly in front of her now.They were both on the sidewalk, facing each other.Tom reached out and gripped her shoulders.Youre taking back your apology?She tried to break his hold, but he wouldnt let her go.I dont regret contacting you, reaching out to you.Okay, youre right, my original purposes were less than stellar.My intent was to introduce you to the father youd never known in a casual, nonthreatening way.I assumed that after the first few days Id nonchalantly mention I happened to be Scotts stepson and let the conversation go from there.Why didnt you?The words were more accusation than question.Because I was afraid that once I told you who I was that you would block my name and I wouldnt be able to talk to you again.It was a risk, but one I was willing to take for my dads sake, and for yours, too.Although privately Ellie was pleased, she felt obliged to say, Thats not a good excuse.Maybe not, he agreed, with some reluctance, his eyes pleading with hers for understanding.But, Ellie, I found it increasingly important to keep you in my life.Ellie had felt the same way, too, although she wasnt overly keen to admit it.Hearing from Tom each day had become progressively more important as their friendship developed.By the time theyd moved on to emails and phone calls, she was half in love with him.You have to remember my intentions were good, he said, as if that was enough to wipe out all the hurt this entire mess had caused her.No, they werent.You used me   You had a right to know your father, Tom argued.A right to know that he loved you and regretted the past.It didnt take me long to realize that youd been fed nothing but lies about the man Id only known to be decent and good and honorable.My mother was looking to protect me.By keeping your father out of your life?he demanded.She  I think it was a matter of several unfortunate incidents that kept them apart.I didnt want that to happen to us, Ellie.You have every right to be upset with me; I understand that.But look at it from my point of view.I wanted to bring a father and daughter together.Yes, I made mistakes, and yes, I was insensitive to you both, but I couldnt think of any other way to go about it.I wish youd been honest with me from the first.Would you have let me in your life if I had?he asked.That was the real question, and one Ellie wasnt sure she could answer.I  I dont know.Shed like to think she would have welcomed the opportunity to meet her father, but she couldnt be certain, couldnt be sure.Besides, if Scott had wanted to be part of her life, wouldnt he have reached out of his own accord instead of letting his stepson do it for him?Thats just it, Tom went on to say.I didnt want to take the chance of losing you, and then I realized by going about it the way I did Id basically guaranteed that once you discovered the truth I was in a no win situation.Thats why I asked you to trust me, no matter what happened this weekend.If Scott hadnt come to the inn, you would have, she whispered.Shed been angry and determined, and even now she wasnt completely sold that she should let Tom back into her life again.Exhaling slowly, Tom leaned his forehead against hers.Tell me youre here because youre willing to give me another chance.Im here because my parents urged me to talk to you.As of right this moment, Ellie wasnt sure of anything.Then it hit her.As she said parents, she realized that this was the first time in her life that shed ever referred to her mother and father as parents, her parents, because they were together and in agreement with each other.Im glad youre here, no matter what the reason, he whispered, and ran his hands down the length of her arms.More glad than you know, and I promise if you give me a second chance I wont blow it.The warmth of his touch chased away the chill that had come over her from that morning on the water and all that had happened afterward.The last thing I ever wanted to do was hurt you.If you believe nothing else, believe that.My father said basically the same thing, she confessed, with a sigh, and accepted that loving someone left her heart open and vulnerable to hurt and to so much more, including love and joy.I do want my father in my life, and I believe he wants to get to know me, too.Tom kissed her forehead and then her nose and the curve of her chin before asking, What about me  in your life?His kiss made it difficult to think clearly, especially as he eased his way toward her lips.That has yet to be determined, she whispered suggestively.He settled his mouth over hers in a lingering kiss that left her weak in the knees.Does that help you decide?he asked.I  it helps.Good, he whispered, and kissed her again, with even more intensity.Ellie clung to him, wrapping her arms around his neck and standing on her tiptoes as she felt her heart opening up to him.When they ended the kiss they were both breathing hard.Still, there were things Ellie had to know.What would you have done if I hadnt driven here to talk to you?she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.I dont know, but I can tell you thisI wouldnt have left matters as they were.Youre too important to me to let you walk away without putting up a fight.Really?Yes, really.Ellie sighed and felt herself weakening.She was being drawn into his arms, and it felt as if this was exactly the place she was meant to be.It would be too hard to live without him now.Are you willing to give me another chance?Tom asked, drawing back enough to be able to look her in the eye.That depends on if you have any more surprises to throw at me.She held his gaze, willing him to level with her.Some women like being surprised.Im not some women, Im me.Okay, no more surprises.Ellie laughed and, looping her arms around his middle and pressing her face against his chest, said, Then were in business.Tom laughed, too, and hugged her close for a long time.He released her but reached for her hand, intertwining their fingers.I think both your mother and Scott would like it if we stopped by the B and B.   You mean  now?No time like the present, Tom suggested, keeping her close to his side.And later you can tell me more about the love letters they wrote to each other that you mentioned a bit ago.Okay.Ellies mood lightened considerably as they drove in separate cars back to Rose Harbor Inn.Standing outside the inn, she filled Tom in on the letters and what each of her parents had learned about the other.It seems your grandparents have a lot to answer for, Tom said when shed finished.Ellie agreed, but at the same time she understood that they, too, had been motivated by good intentions.I believe my grandparents assumed Mom would marry again.They had someone else in mind, but it never panned out.Why not?Ellie had never been sure until now.She was in love with my father.At one point she swallowed her pride and went to him, but it was too late.Hed already married your mother.Tom tightly gripped her hand.Im sorry about that.Dont be.I believe that life flows the way it was meant to be.Were in charge of our own futures, but only to a certain point, and then God takes over, and thats for the best.You have a forgiving nature, Tom said, and I for one am grateful you do.If Mom and Dad had reunited when I was a kid, theres every likelihood that we would never have met, she reminded him.Tom mulled that over for several moments and then agreed.Your father is a good man, Ellie, and once you get to know him youll learn that for yourself.He made mistakes in his life; we all do.I have and you have, but we cant allow ourselves to get bogged down by errors in judgment.Ellie hoped that was the case with her parents.Tom took her hand as they walked toward the front steps.Rover was at the door to greet them, but he didnt bark or put up a fuss.Instead, he wagged his tail as if to say how pleased he was to see that they were back and that they were together.Virginia Reynolds glanced up when Ellie and Tom came into the living area.Her gaze went to their linked hands and she smiled.Did you two work everything out?she asked.Were getting there, Ellie explained, sitting down on the sofa next to her mother.Tom took the chair beside Scott.They hadnt discussed the future.That had yet to be determined.For now, it was enough that theyd cleared the air and decided to move forward.She didnt know what the future held for the two of them, but she sincerely hoped they would have one together.Time would tell.It seems to me, Scott Reynolds said, there are plenty of reasons for a celebration.Id like to treat us all to a wonderful dinner at DDs on the Cove.Virginia looked to Ellie as if seeking her permission.I think that would be lovely, Ellie said.Its time I got to know my daughter.Time I got to know my father, she returned.Virginia shifted and looked a bit uncomfortable.Perhaps it would be better if I stayed behind.Mom, no, Ellie insisted.I want you to come.It wouldnt be the same without you.But   Ginny, Scott said evenly.I invited you as well.Id like it if youd join us.Im going, Tom told her.I dont want to waste a minute of the time I have with Ellie before she heads back to Oregon.Virginia glanced from one to the other and then agreed.All right.Ellie knew her mother well enough to recognize that she wanted to be talked into joining the group.She read subtle hints that told her that while shed been away her parents had talked and, she hoped, cleared the air.As far as she was concerned, it was twenty two years later than it should have been.Still, it pleased her immensely that they were able to communicate now.S o  Tom said, dragging out the word and looking to his stepfather.Are you two  talking?Were talking, was all Scott would say.But Ellie noticed that her mother blushed ever so slightly.Were talking, she concurred.Theres been a lot of hurts and a lot of misunderstandings.I fear I misjudged Scott terribly.Your family  Scott said, and then bit off the rest of what he intended to say.Like we agreed, whats done is done.This is a brand new day.Its early evening, Virginia corrected.Scott chuckled.You always were a stickler for details, Ginny.All right, its a brand new early evening.I have both my daughter and the son of my heart by my side, and my ex wife and I are talking.Just talking, Virginia reminded him.Just talking, Scott agreed, but thats a vast improvement.A vast improvement, indeed.Ellies gaze met Toms and he winked, and, smiling, she winked back.It was a start for them all, and for that Ellie could only be grateful.31     Maggie took a seat near the back of the bus and sat with her head pressed against the window.It felt cool against her skin.Exhausted, she closed her eyes and tried not to think of all she would need to do once she reached Yakima.The thought of facing her family with the news that she and Roy were separating twisted her gut.She didnt know what she would tell her boys when they started asking why their daddy didnt live at home any longer.Sadness nearly overwhelmed her.The weight of loss and grief was almost more than her heart could absorb.Are you feeling all right?the woman sitting across the aisle from Maggie asked.She offered her fellow passenger a weak smile.Im just tired, Maggie said.Ill be fine.Late night?the woman pressed.Something like that.Maggie closed her eyes again, not really in the mood to strike up a conversation with a stranger.My goodness, would you look at that, the woman said.At what?she asked, although she wasnt really interested.That car, the woman continued.Hes pulled up on my side of the bus and is waving at the driver to pull over.Maggie sat up straighter and glanced out the window.No, it couldnt be.The vehicle was the same make and model as Roys car, the very one theyd driven over from Yakima, with the same bumper sticker for Jaxons T ball team.Half standing now, Maggie pressed her hand over her mouth.Obviously, it had to be Roy.She nearly gasped as she sat back down.Having him come racing after her like a madman was the last thing she needed.Or expected.Some clown is trying to pull you over, another passenger called out to the driver.It happens, the driver shouted back.People miss the bus and then try to catch up with me.It doesnt work that way.Our policy is clear.I leave on time, and if they arent at the stop, then I head out.Its as simple as that.Maggie heard the horn honk.Whats he doing now?One thing was sure, Roy had everyones attention.He continued to press against the horn while the driver did his best to ignore him.This fellows pretty insistent, the woman across from Maggie said, shaking her head.Hes weaving in and out of traffic now.It isnt going to do him any good, the driver called.I dont stop, especially on the highway.Not for anyone.Its company rules.Ive been driving for ten years, and Im not about to lose my job over some bozo who cant tell time.Good for you.As far as Maggie could see, the passengers agreed with the driver, including her.As for why Roy would want to stop the bus, she could only speculate.She wanted to believe hed reconsidered filing for divorce, but she doubted that was possible.Hed been adamant about what he wanted, and it wasnt for them to work on their marriage.Surely he didnt believe it would be possible for them to travel back to Yakima together.The three and a half hour ride over had been difficult enough.Following their last discussion, it would be impossible to be in the same car together.Roy had to recognize that.The bus exited the freeway, leaving Maggie to wonder if the driver had changed his mind about stopping.She sat up straighter and turned to her chatty neighbor.Whats the bus driver doing?Why did he pull off the freeway?Theres another stop ahead, the other woman explained.A stop?You mean the bus stops in other towns?Oh yes, there are six along this route.Cedar Cove is the second one.There are four others.Oh.It made perfect sense.This wasnt welcome news, although she should have realized the bus wouldnt go directly to the airport from Cedar Cove.The bare fact was, Maggie hadnt been thinking.She wasnt in an emotional place to let trivial matters such as bus stops enter her already overtaxed mind.Under normal circumstances it wouldnt have mattered, but this was anything but usual.The car is following us off the exit, her seatmate informed her, craning her neck to look out the window.Good thing, because that blasted horn was beginning to irritate me, someone else said, and took his fingers out of his ears.Whats the matter with people today?No one had an answer for him, least of all Maggie.She glanced around for some sign of where they were but saw nothing she recognized.As far as she could make out, the stopping point was little more than a transit parking lot.There didnt appear to be anything commercial within sightno convenience store, no service station, no fast food restaurants.Just a parking lot, and a sparsely used one at that.But then it was Saturday.Maggie saw a couple people standing next to their suitcases.The bus pulled up close to the two women and gradually eased to a stop.Both women boarded the bus, paid their fee, and then claimed their seats in the middle.The driver was about to close the door when Roy leaped on board.He stalked past the driver.Hey, buddy, you need to buy a ticket, the driver called after him as Roy continued down the aisle, headed directly to where Maggie had slouched in her seat.She kept her head down, her chin tucked against her chest, refusing to make eye contact with him.Maggie, you need to come with me, he said, standing directly alongside her seat.Maggie pretended not to hear.Maggie, he said, louder this time.Come with me.She crossed her arms over her chest.Why?Roy exhaled loud enough so shed know how deeply shed tried his patience.We need to talk this out.She did her best to sound calm and reasonable.The two of them had the attention of everyone on the bus.The last thing she wanted was for Roy to make a scene.I believe everything has already been said.Please, just leave.If you want to talk, we can do it once were in Yakima.This cant wait, Roy insisted.Itll have to.She could be just as stubborn as her soon to be ex husband.The driver stepped behind Roy.Either you pay your fare or you get off the bus, he said.Give me a minute, Roy pleaded.Listen, buddy, Ive got a schedule to keep.Do I need to call nine one one and have you deal with the sheriff?This is my wife, Roy told the driver.Not for much longer, Maggie informed the driver.Okay, you two, listen up.Im a bus driver, not a marriage counselor.So I advise you to settle whatever marital problems youre having elsewhere.I got people catching flights.Maggie could see that delaying everyone else wouldnt be appreciated.From his stance, she could tell that Roy wouldnt easily be moved until he got his way.In reality, Maggie didnt have much choice other than to gather her purse and vacate the bus.She wasnt happy about it, but her options were limited.Thank you, the driver said with apparent relief when she stood and scooted past the woman sitting next to her.Her seatmate gave her an encouraging smile and gently squeezed her hand as she slipped by.The driver got off the bus to retrieve her suitcase.The passengers on board applauded as Maggie moved past.The driver gave Maggie a hand as she climbed down the stairs off the bus.Im not a marriage counselor or a doctor, but I delivered a baby a few years back while on my route, he said proudly.I even made the Seattle newspapers and did an interview for the nightly newscast on Channel Five.You look like a nice couple; I hope everything works out.Thanks, Roy said, as he moved past the driver and picked up Maggies bag.She didnt hold out much hope that their talking would solve anything.Theyd come too far, said too much, to the point that raw nerves were exposed.As soon as she had her suitcase, the bus drove off, leaving Maggie standing with Roy in the middle of a nearly deserted parking lot.For someone who had come chasing after her, honking his horn and holding up a bus full of people in order to get to her, Roy didnt seem to have anything of importance to say.The drivers side of his car had been left open, indicating that hed leaped out in an all fired rush.That sense of urgency appeared to have deserted him now that she was with him.Silently, he walked around to the passenger side and held open the door for her.Then he took her suitcase and placed it in the back.While he dealt with that, Maggie got inside the car and closed her door.Then she leaned her head against the window and closed her eyes, much the same way shed done while sitting on the bus.Roy slid into the drivers seat and shut the door, but he didnt start the engine.Howd you know where to find me?she asked, still not looking at him.But her eyes were open now, wide open, and she was curious.You didnt make it easy.I didnt think youd care.I care, he returned.In answer to her question, he added, Connor told me youd asked about the bus.The young man at the Java Joint?I drove all over town looking for you and got a little desperate when I couldnt find you.So I started asking folks on the street and in the shops, showed them your photo, and the kid said youd been in there, drinking tea and asking questions about catching the bus.Why were you looking for me?she demanded.She found it hard to understand why he found it so important to talk to her now.Why do you think?His answer infuriated her.Please, Roy, I dont want to do this.You made your feelings clear.Youre finished with me.You dont want this baby.Nothing has changed in the last few hours.As far as I can see, there isnt anything left to say.All I want now is to get home, wrap my arms around my children, and make plans for my future and theirs.A future that didnt include him, other than as the father of her sons.Roy didnt seem to have anything to say.When he did speak, she noticed that his hands had a steel grip on the steering wheel, as if he were driving through an intense storm.Its a difficult thing to find out the woman Ive sworn to love could very well be carrying another mans child, he said, the emotion in his voice stark, his expression bleak.Maggie turned her head away as tears blurred her vision.She had nothing to add, nothing to say.And something else entirely, to think of living the rest of my life without you.The thing is, Maggie, I dont think I could manage it.Weve been one for so long that tearing us into two halves isnt going to work.I was a fool to have suggested we try.Swallowing tightly, Maggie held her breath for fear if she did breathe it would come out as a sob.You left your wedding ring behind in the room.At first it just made me mad  I saw it as a dig, a way of getting back at me.In all the years weve been married, I dont ever remember you taking it off.She had, but only out of necessity, never in anger or despair.Not until that very day.You left the letter, too.The one I wrote you in college.Like she would forget when she received it.I read the letter  I remember writing it, how I measured every word.I thanked you for making me a better man.I said that I would always love you.He hesitated, and then in a low voice added, I meant every single word of that letter.At the time, she qualified.I mean them now.Again, his words were low and rough.I mean them now, he repeated.Youre right, nothing has changed in the last few hours except the fact that I realize I dont want to live without you.It isnt easy dealing with this pregnancy.But Im trying.Give me a chance.I cant promise to be perfect, but at least give me credit for making the effort.Maggie lifted her head and turned to look at her husband.To her shock, she saw tears rolling down his cheeks.I dont know how well get through this, Maggie, he whispered brokenly, but we will.Well survive this and whatever else life throws at us.The baby  Her cheeks were moist as well, and she found it difficult to speak.The lump in her throat felt as large as a tennis ball.I promise you I will do everything within me to love this child, Roy said.From this moment forward I will work on accepting this child as my son or daughter.Maggie cupped her hand over her mouth, unable to hold back the sobs.But I dont know who the father is.It doesnt matter.How can you say that  how can you learn to love another mans child?Shed realized almost from the first moment shed discovered she was pregnant that she was asking Roy to do the impossible.He would always wonder, always suspect, always fear.Ill love this child because while we might not know who fathered this baby, there will never be a doubt who the mother is, Roy said, as he gently wiped the moisture from her cheeks.Youre the mother, the woman I love.A sob escaped her, and she pressed her forehead against her husbands shoulder.This is our baby, Maggie, yours and mine.There wont be a paternity test.Theres no need for one.Were in this together.I dont expect it will be easy for either one of us, but I cant let you go.His arm came around her as he buried his face in her shoulder.I want to be a better man, Maggie, he whispered, a better husband and a better father.Ive failed you, but I swear by everything that is holy, I wont again.She was weeping almost uncontrollably now, and Roy was, too.I vowed to love you.I meant it when I wrote that letter, and I meant it the day we were married.I mean it now.Nothing you could ever do will make me love you any less than I do right this minute.Maggie would have said the same to him, only she found it impossible to speak.Roy brushed the hair from her cheek with tenderness and love while he rubbed his chin over the crown of her head.I love you, Roy.I know, baby, I know.I want to go home.Me, too, but can we wait until the morning?Okay, Maggie whispered.Promise me one thing, he said, kissing the top of her head.Anything.Dont ever leave me again.Maggie grinned.You got it.She wrapped her arms around his middle and sighed, suddenly tired and depleted.Were going to be okay, Roy.She felt it in every fiber of her being.Their marriage would survive, and they would grow stronger as a couple and as a family because of this.Im hoping we have a girl this time.And if its a boy?she quizzed.Actually, Ill take whatever God gives us.While it didnt feel like it at the moment, Maggie was convinced that in time it would be true.This baby is a gift, Roy, a precious gift.You would have had a hard time convincing me of that earlier, but I think you may be right.He kissed her again, before he continued.He or she has yet to be born and already this unborn child has shown me how to be a better husband.And me to be a better wife.You ready to go back now?Roy asked.Maggie released a shuddering sigh and nodded.She was more than ready.32     First thing Sunday morning I fed my guests breakfast: fresh fruit, toast from bakery bread, crisp bacon, and an egg casserole, all of which were popular breakfast items.I couldnt help but notice that the atmosphere was completely different this morning than it had been previously.Everyone appeared to be in a jovial, happy mood.Ellie and her mother were in good spirits and promised to get in touch soon to book rooms for a return visit the following month.Before Ellie had time to bring down her suitcase, Tom arrived.The two sat on the deck and talked for some time.I heard Ellies laugh and watched Virginia smile.They get along so well, dont they?Virginia said, as I carted the dirty dishes into the kitchen.They certainly seem to.I invited Tom to visit us in Oregon, and he accepted my invitation, and I think Scott will come with him.This was quite a switch in Virginias attitude from what Ellie had mentioned earlier.The inn had worked its enchantment once again, healing wounded hearts, lifting spirits, blessing all who stayed.This was the promise I had gotten from Paul that first night, and it had certainly proved itself this weekend.The story was the same with the Porters.I was never quite sure of what was going on between the couple, although I was able to piece parts of the story together.Maggie herself had mentioned she was pregnant and shed said it as though in shock, struggling to hold back tears, and then shed disappeared.At first Roy had seemed more angry than concerned, but his attitude had changed after his chat with Mark, and hed set off determined to find her.When Maggie returned with Roy, her suitcase in tow, I noticed a drastic change in them both.In some way I felt I needed to thank Mark for talking sense into Roy Porter.This morning I felt I was looking at two entirely different people.They acted like newlyweds, so deeply in love they couldnt take their eyes off each other.The first thing Roy did when they sat down at the breakfast table with Ellie and Virginia was announce that Maggie was pregnant.Its our third, he said.Were both hoping for a girl this time.Do you have names picked out?Ellie asked, after congratulating the couple.Not yet, Maggie said, resting her hand against her abdomen.Margaret for a girl, Roy insisted.Right away Maggie waved her hand, dismissing his suggestion.Names are still under consideration.Well be checking out right after breakfast, Roy told me.Mark asked me to stop by his place on our way out of town.He did?That was odd, but I didnt stop to question Roy, seeing that I had quite a bit of work to do before my family arrived for dinner later in the afternoon.Plus, I had guests checking in, but they wouldnt arrive until later in the day.The house was empty before noon, and I started stripping down the beds.I had a busy Sunday ahead of me and wanted to get as much of the housekeeping chores finished as possible before starting the dinner preparations.I figured my family would arrive around three and wed eat about five.The weather was perfect, sunny and bright.I glanced out the window a couple times and realized I was hoping to see Mark.Not much chance there.My guess was, I wouldnt see hide nor hair of him all day.Hed as much as said so.Frankly, it was a relief.Id regretted asking Mom to ferret out information about my elusive neighbor and handyman.Curiosity had taken root in me and Id allowed it to get out of hand, making uncomfortable demands of someone I considered a friend.Id since made peace with Marks need for privacy.That wasnt the only reason I was eager for a breather from my neighbor.The kiss Id blown Mark after his chat with Roy Porter had been an impulsive gesture.After a night of mulling it over, I still couldnt imagine what had prompted me to do such a thing.Id seen Marks eyes widen with surprise, but his shock was no greater than my own.It embarrassed me now, and I was afraid Mark would take delight in bringing it up in conversation.That would be just like him.Talking about it, analyzing it, was way out of my comfort zone, and if Mark insisted, Id tell him so.Once that was decided, I immediately felt better.The phone rang in my office as I cleaned the kitchen, indicating a business call.Any personal call would come via my cell.Rose Harbor Inn, I answered, using my best professional voice.Oh hi, the woman on the other end of the line said, as if she was surprised to hear a real person.Im calling about booking a room, she said, and then quickly added, Actually, two rooms.She mentioned a date in early September, less than a month away.I checked my reservation schedule and saw that I had two rooms available.Its for my best friend and me, the woman explained.Its our class reunion.Im Kellie and my friends name is Katie.She laughed as she said it.You graduated from Cedar Cove High?We did.Time really does fly when youre having fun.My mom and dad live in Arizona now, Katie lives in Seattle and Ive recently moved from San Francisco back to Seattle.We could commute, its really not that far, but we didnt want to have to worry about getting back to Seattle if the night gets late.This should be interesting.Best friends coming back to Cedar Cove for a class reunion.Ive got you down for that weekend and have reserved two rooms for Friday through Sunday.Perfect.See you, she said, and the line was disconnected.I stared at the phone for a moment and shook my head.I could hardly wait to meet Kellie and Katie.As I expected, my family arrived around three.Also as I expected, my mother was full of questions regarding Mark.Id hoped he would have a change of heart and join us for dinner, Mom said, almost as soon as she was in the front door.If youre referring to Mark, then the answer is no.He wont be joining us.I hated to disappoint my mother.Really, there wasnt anything more to say.My father was even more inquisitive about Mark.Clearly, my parents had been discussing my relationship with the handyman, which made for an uncomfortable conversation.Dad stepped into the kitchen and dipped his finger in the salad dressing, licked it, and then gave me a nod of approval.You like this fellow, dont you?Dad!Mark is a friend, nothing more and nothing less.Nothing else?he pried, his thick brows arched with the question.No, I insisted, and busied myself getting the salmon ready for the grill in order to avoid further questions.Unfortunately, their inquisitiveness started up again once my brother and his family arrived.Mom said youd invited some guy you wanted us to meet, Todd said, looking about the room.Its Mark, and before you ask, hes a friend.Hes done quite a bit of work around the inn, and hes just a friend, I repeated, emphasizing our relationship didnt go beyond the bond of friendship.I remember, Todd said, brightening.Marks that handyman who irritates you.I feed him cookies and that helps tame the beast in him, I joked, and looked for a way to change the subject.Todd grinned.You like him, though, right?I mean, that was what Mom seemed to insinuate.I didnt know how many times I was going to have to repeat that Mark wasnt a potential love interest.I like him as a friend.Todd gave me that know it all look that said he read between the lines.Arguing would only convince him he was right, and so, hard as it was, I didnt further the discussion by protesting overly much.Everyone left around seven, and even if I say so myself, dinner turned out fabulous.Better than Id expected.Im sure all the cooking Ive been doing since taking over the inn has vastly improved my skills in the kitchen.My guests were out for the evening, and the inn felt especially quiet after my family left.In the end, I was eternally grateful Mark had stayed away.I would hate to think of the interrogation he would have undergone had he arrived unexpectedly.Thankfully, Mark seemed to have a sixth sense when it came to such matters.After brewing myself a cup of coffee I ventured outside to the alcove.Rover followed me and we sat in the chairs close to the fireplace.Id come to love this little haven.Mark had strung lights around the frame, and as dusk settled I turned them on.Sipping my coffee, I had a one sided conversation with Rover.Hed loved spending time with my brothers two kids.He would have made a great family pet.I was chatting away when Rover lifted his head and I felt someones presence behind me.Twisting around, I found Mark.Do you always talk to yourself?he asked, plunking himself down in the chair next to me.I was talking to Rover.Does he answer back?I shrugged.He does in his own way.Bet he doesnt argue much.Not like some people I could mention, I said pointedly.Mark grinned and leaned back in the chair, making himself comfortable.Roy Porter mentioned that youd asked him to stop by.He hadnt mentioned why, and I couldnt help being curious.I finished that cradle Ive been working on for the last few months.Its beautiful.I figured he and Maggie might put it to good use.I could hardly believe it.Mark, that cradle was a work of art and you gave it away?He shrugged as if it was something small and quickly changed the subject.Howd the dinner go with your family?Great.No questions about where I was or why I hadnt bothered to show?He had to ask!I could fib, but I dont think it would have done much good.Mark would see right through me.A few, I said, hoping hed leave it at that.Thankfully, he did, and we sat in relative peace for several moments, each taking in the beauty of the evening.Question, Mark said, breaking the silence.Sure.I wasnt the least bit sure, because I had a feeling I knew what was coming.You blew me a kiss.I knew it, I just knew he would bring that up.I was hoping youd overlook that.Hed gone still and serious.Did you mean it?The kiss?If I played dumb long enough, maybe hed change the subject.He didnt answer right away.Im afraid were wading into dangerous territory, Jo Marie, and it worries me.Dangerous territory?How so?I asked, rather than head straight into flat out denial.He clamped his hands together and went silent.It felt as if everything around us did the same.Even the breeze wafting the leaves ceased.The birds no longer chirped and the street traffic faded away.Mark?My given name is actually Jeremy.Jeremy?I repeated, confused now.Then exactly where did Mark come from?It was my fathers name.He was a good man who worked hard his entire life, who loved my mother and his children.He believed in God and family and the American way.And Jeremy?I asked, and as soon as I said the words I was sorry.Jeremy is dead.His voice was stark and hard.Now I really was confused.Listen, its not important that I know.You dont need to tell me a thing.I think it is important.Because Ive been pressuring you?Im sorry about that.Whatever reason you have for keeping it a secret is fine by me.Its not my affair.Its funny.What is?Personally, I wasnt finding anything amusing about any bit of this.I dont know when Id seen Mark more serious.He looked nervous and unsure.Everything about him said as much, the way he sat, leaning forward and gently rocking, the way he tapped his foot as if looking to run away from a past he didnt want to confront.Whats funny, he clarified, is that a couple days ago you couldnt have gotten me to tell you this if youd had me water boarded.What changed your mind?His eyes skirted to mine.That kiss you blew me.The kiss?I couldnt imagine what that had to do with any of what he insisted on telling me.All at once Mark was on his feet, his hands inside his pockets.You have to know the way I feel about you, Jo Marie.My mind and my heart started racing.I stared up at him, my mouth dry.I make every excuse imaginable to spend time with you.He did?I found myself incapable of speech.Dont pretend you didnt know.I didnt.It shocked me that I could be that oblivious, but then little things started adding up.His anger when he saw me climbing a ladder last spring, and how hed kept Peter McConnell out of the inn and insisted he stay overnight at his house.My eyes and body language must have betrayed me, because Mark said, I see youre filling in the blanks.I  I didnt know  Before you say anything, Mark said, cutting me off, let me tell you this thing I feel, this attraction, isnt going anywhere.Im nipping it in the bud right now.My thoughts were spinning, and I placed both hands on top of my head, looking to make sense of what seemed impossible.The only reason Im telling you this now, Mark continued, is that I can see youre starting to return those feelings, and its got to stop.Return his feelings?That was how hed read the meaning behind that silly throwaway kiss?For the sake of argument, can you explain why you feel there could never be anything  romantic between us?This was all pretty new to me, and I needed clarity.Mark started pacing the tight area inside of the alcove.There are things about me you dont know, things I dont want to talk about.Its okay, Mark.Im sorry I pressed you for information you arent willing to share.It doesnt matter to me what your past is.It matters to me, he said, nearly shouting, and then he repeated himself, lowering his voice.It matters to me.I didnt know what to say or how to respond.He crouched next to me and reached for my hand, gripping it with both of his own.His eyes held mine.You were married to Paul Rose, and he was a hero.He gave his life in defense of our country.Hes everything Im not.Im the antithesis of a hero, make no mistake in that.Im blemished.Flawed.Broken.Im crawling out of a black hole.By all thats fair and just, I should be the one who died, not Paul.Again, I was at a loss for words.He straightened and started to leave, but I leaped up, reached out, and grabbed hold of his elbow.We were only a few inches apart.From the time I took over the inn Id seen a good deal of Mark Taylor, often two and three times a day, but he was right.I didnt know him at all.This doesnt change anything, I whispered.His eyes were filled with sadness.Youre wrong.Not on my end.His gaze didnt waver, and I could see him struggle with indecision within himself.Like I said, were headed into dangerous territory.Maybe so, I agreed, and then I said it again.Maybe so.I think it might be best if I moved on, Mark told me, his voice low and serious.You mean leave the area?I couldnt believe hed even suggest such a thing.Then I remembered that hed mentioned earlier that in the past hed drifted from town to town.At the same time hed also mentioned that he was content in Cedar Cove.Its time.What about the gazebo?I asked desperately, trying to think of something, anything, to get him to reconsider.You dont seem the type to leave a project unfinished.He hesitated.All right, Ill finish that, but then Im leaving.From the look in his eyes I could see nothing I said would be able to change his mind.I suspected it earlier, but now I knew the truth.Mark was running from his past.It seemed the healing powers of the inn werent strong enough to heal the man who had become my closest friend.
