I will punish you if you digress from the rules.Other than that  well, I think its all up for discussion.Those are my requirements, Miss Steele.What say you to that?So I get to sleep with you?In your bed?Is that what you want?Yes.I agree then.Besides, I sleep very well when youre in my bed.I had no idea.His brow creases as his voice fades.I was frightened youd leave me if I didnt agree to all of it, I whisper.Im not going anywhere, Anastasia.Besides  He trails off, and after some thought, he adds.Were following your advice, your definition: compromise.You emailed it to me.And so far, its working for me.I love that you want more, I murmur shyly.I know.How do you know?Trust me.I just do.He smirks at me.Hes hiding something.What?At that moment, Leandra arrives with breakfast and our conversation ceases.My stomach rumbles, reminding me how ravenous I am.Christian watches with annoying approval as I devour everything on my plate.Can I treat you?I ask Christian.Treat me how?Pay for this meal.Christian snorts.I dont think so.he scoffs.Please.I want to.He frowns at me.Are you trying to completely emasculate me?This is probably the only place that Ill be able to afford to pay.Anastasia, I appreciate the thought.I do.But no.I purse my lips.Dont scowl, he threatens, his eyes glinting ominously.Of course he doesnt ask me for my mothers address.He knows it already, stalker that he is.When he pulls up outside the house, I dont comment.Whats the point?Do you want to come in?I ask shyly.I need to work, Anastasia, but Ill be back this evening.What time?I ignore the unwelcome stab of disappointment.Why do I want to spend every single minute with this controlling sex god?Oh yes, Ive fallen in love with him, and he can fly.Thank you for the more.My pleasure, Anastasia.He kisses me, and I inhale his sexy Christian smell.Ill see you later.Try and stop me, he whispers.I wave goodbye as he drives off into the Georgia sunshine.Im still wearing his sweatshirt and his underwear, and Im too warm.In the kitchen, my mom is in a complete flap.Its not every day she has to entertain a multi zillionaire, and its stressing her out.How are you, darling?she asks, and I flush because she must know what I was doing last night.Im good.Christian took me gliding this morning.I hope the new information will distract her.Gliding?As in a small plane with no engine?That sort of gliding?I nod.Wow.Shes speechless  a novel concept for my mother.She gapes at me, but eventually recovers herself and resumes her original line of questioning.How was last night?Did you talk?Jeez.I flush bright scarlet.We talked  last night and today.Its getting better.Good.She turns her attention back to the four cookery books she has open on the kitchen table.Mom if you like, Ill cook this evening.Oh, honey, thats kind of you, but I want to do it.Okay.I grimace, knowing full well that my mothers cooking is pretty hit or miss.Perhaps shes improved since she moved to Savannah with Bob.There was a time I wouldnt subject anyone to her cooking even  who do I hate?Oh yes  Mrs.Robinson   Elena.Well, maybe her.Will I ever meet this damned woman?I decide to send a quick thank you to Christian.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Soaring as opposed to sore ing  Date: June 2 2011 10:20 EST  To: Christian Grey  Sometimes, you really know how to show a girl a good time.Thank you  Ana x  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Soaring vs sore ing  Date: June 2 2011 10:24 EST  To: Anastasia Steele  Ill take either of those over your snoring.I had a good time too.But I always do when Im with you.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: SNORING  Date: June 2 2011 10:26 EST  To: Christian Grey  I DO NOT SNORE.And if I do, its very ungallant of you to point it out.You are no gentleman Mr.Grey!And you are in the Deep South too!Ana      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Somniloquy  Date: June 2 2011 10:28 EST  To: Anastasia Steele  I have never claimed to be a gentleman, Anastasia, and I think I have demonstrated that point to you on numerous occasions.I am not intimidated by your SHOUTY capitals.But I will confess to a small white lie: No  you dont snore, but you do talk.And its fascinating.What happened to my kiss?Christian Grey  Cad & CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Holy shit.I know I talk in my sleep.Kate has told me enough times.What the hell have I said?Oh no.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Spill the Beans  Date: June 2 2011 10:32 EST  To: Christian Grey  You are a cad and a scoundrel  definitely no gentleman.So, what did I say?No kisses for you until you talk!From: Christian Grey  Subject: Sleeping talking Beauty  Date: June 2 2011 10:35 EST  To: Anastasia Steele  It would be most ungallant of me to say, and I have already been chastised for that.But if you behave yourself, I may tell you this evening.I do have to go into a meeting now.Laters, baby.Christian Grey  CEO, Cad & Scoundrel, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Right!I shall maintain radio silence until this evening.I fume.Jeez.Supposing Ive said I hate him, or worse still, that I love him, in my sleep.Oh, I hope not.I am not ready to tell him that, and Im sure hes not ready to hear it, if he ever wants to hear it.I scowl at my computer and decide that whatever I cook, I will make bread.My mom has decided on gazpacho soup and a barbecue with steaks marinated in olive oil, garlic, and lemon.Christian likes meat, and its simple to do.Bob has volunteered to man the BBQ grill.What is it about men and fire, I ponder as I trail after my mother through the supermarket with the shopping cart?As we browse the raw meat cabinet, my phone rings.I scramble for it, thinking it may be Christian.I dont recognize the number.Hello?I answer breathlessly.Anastasia Steele?Yes.Its Elizabeth Morgan from SIP.Oh  hi.Im calling to offer you the job of assistant to Mr.Jack Hyde.Wed like you to start on Monday.Wow.Thats great.Thank you!You know the salary details?Yes.Yes thats  I mean, I accept your offer.Id love to come and work for you.Excellent.Well see you Monday at 8:30 a. m. ?See you then.Goodbye.And thank you.I beam at my mom.You have a job?I nod gleefully, and she squeals and hugs me in the middle of Publix supermarket.Congratulations, darling!We have to buy some champagne!Shes clapping her hands and jumping up and down.Is she forty two or twelve?I glance down at my phone and frown, theres a missed call from Christian.He never phones me.I call him straight back.Anastasia, he answers immediately.Hi, I murmur shyly.I have to return to Seattle.Somethings come up.I am on my way to Hilton Head now.Please apologize to your mother  I cant make dinner.He sounds very businesslike.Nothing serious, I hope?I have a situation which I have to deal with.Ill see you Friday.Ill send Taylor to collect you from the airport if I cant come myself.He sounds cold.Angry even.But for the first time, I dont immediately think its me.Okay.I hope you sort out your situation.Have a safe flight.You too, baby, he breathes, and with those words, my Christian is back briefly.Then he hangs up.Oh no.The last situation he had was my virginity .Jeez, I hope its nothing like that.I gaze at my mom.Her earlier jubilation has metamorphosed into concern.Its Christian, hes had to go back to Seattle.He apologizes.Oh!Thats a shame, darling.We can still have our barbecue, and now we have something to celebrate  your new job!You have to tell me all about it.Its late afternoon, and Mom and I are lying beside the pool.My mother has relaxed to the point where she is literally horizontal now that Mr.Megabucks is not coming to dinner.As I lie in the sun, endeavoring to lose the pale, I think about yesterday evening and breakfast today.I think about Christian, and my ridiculous grin refuses to subside.It keeps creeping across my face, unbidden and disconcerting, as I recall our various conversations and what we did what he did.There seems to be tidal shift in Christians attitude.He denies it but  he admits hes trying for more.What could have changed?What has altered since he sent his long email and when I saw him yesterday?What has he done?I sit up suddenly, almost spilling my Dr.Pepper.He had dinner with her.Elena.Holy Fuck!My scalp prickles at the realization.Did she say something to him?Oh to have been a fly on the wall during their dinner.I could have landed in her soup or on her wine glass and choked her.What is it, Ana, honey?Mom asks, startled from her torpor.Im just having a moment, Mom.What time is it?About 6:30 p. m. , darling.Hmm he wont have landed yet.Can I ask him?Should I ask him?Or perhaps she has nothing to do with it.I fervently hope so.What did I say in my sleep?Crap some unguarded remark while dreaming about him, I bet?Whatever it is, or was, I hope the sea of change is coming from within him and not because of her.I am sweltering in this damned heat.I need another dip in the pool.As I get ready for bed, I switch on my computer.I have heard nothing from Christian.Not even a word that hes arrived safely.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Safe Arrival?Date: June 2 2011 22:32 EST  To: Christian Grey  Dear Sir  Please let me know that you have arrived safely.I am starting to worry.Thinking of you.Your Ana.x  Three minutes later, I hear the ping from my email in box.From: Christian Grey

heart warming to know that you care for me.I am thinking of you too and as ever looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.I sigh, Christian is back to formality.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: The Situation  Date: June 2 2011 22:40 EST  To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grey  I think it is very evident that I care for you deeply.How could you doubt

Friday evening.Looking forward to it  ;)  Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Grrrrrr  Date: June 2 2011 23:02 EST  To: Christian Grey  I am officially pissed at you.Goodnight.Miss A.  R.  Steele  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Wild Cat  Date: June 2 2011 20:05  To: Anastasia Steele      Are you growling at me Miss Steele?I possess a cat of my own for growlers.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Cat of his own?Ive never seen a cat in his apartment.No, I am not going to answer him.Oh, he can be so exasperating sometimes.Fifty shades of exasperating.I clamber into bed and lie glaring at the ceiling as my eyes adjust to the dark.I hear another ping from my computer.I am not going to look.No definitely not.No, I am not going to look.Gah!Like the fool I am, I cannot resist the lure of Christian Greys words.From: Christian Grey  Subject: What you said in your sleep  Date: June 2 2011 20:20  To: Anastasia Steele  Anastasia  Id rather hear you say the words that you uttered in your sleep when youre conscious, thats why I wont tell you.Go to sleep.Youll need to be rested with what I have in mind for you tomorrow.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Oh no What have I said?Its as bad as I think, Im sure.My mother hugs me tightly.Follow your heart, darling, and please, please  try not to over think things.Relax and enjoy yourself.You are so young, sweetheart.You have so much of life to experience yet, just let it happen.You deserve the best of everything.Her heartfelt words are comforting whispered in my ear.She kisses my hair.Oh, Mom.Hot, unwelcome tears prick my eyes as I cling to her.Darling, you know what they say.You have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince.I give her a lopsided, bittersweet smile.I think Ive kissed a prince, Mom.I hope he doesnt turn into a frog.She gives me her most endearing motherly absolute unconditional love smile, and I marvel at the love I feel for this woman as we hug again.Ana  theyre calling your flight, Bobs voice is anxious.Will you visit, Mom?Of course darling  soon.Love you.Me too.Her eyes are red with unshed tears as she releases me.I hate leaving her.I hug Bob, and turning, head to the gate  I do not have time for the first class lounge today.I will myself not to glance back.But I do and Bob is holding my mom, and tears are streaming      down her face.I can no longer hold mine back.I put my head down and proceed to the gate, keeping my eyes on the shiny, white floor, blurred through my watery tears.Once on board, in the luxury of first class, I curl up in my seat and try to compose myself.It is always painful to wrench myself away from Mom she is scatty, disorganized, but newly insightful, and she loves me.Unconditional love  what every child deserves from its parents.I frown at my wayward thoughts, and pulling out my BlackBerry, stare at it despondently.What does Christian know of love?Seems he didnt get the unconditional love he was entitled to during his very early years.My heart twists, and my mothers words waft like a zephyr through my mind: Yes, Ana.Hell  what do you need?a neon sign flashing on his forehead?She thinks Christian loves me, but then shes my mother, of course shed think that.She thinks I deserve the best of everything.I frown.Its true, and in a moment of startling clarity, I see it.Its very simple: I want his love.I need Christian Grey to love me.This is why I am so reticent about our relationship  because on some basic, fundamental level, I recognize within me a deep seated compulsion to be loved and cherished.And because of his fifty shades  I am holding myself back.The BDSM is a distraction from the real issue.The sex is amazing, hes wealthy, hes beautiful, but this is all meaningless without his love, and the real heart fail is that I dont know if hes capable of love.He doesnt even love himself.I recall his self loathing, her love being the only form he found  acceptable.Punished  whipped, beaten, whatever their relationship entailed   he feels undeserving of love.Why does he feel like that?How can he feel like that?His words haunt me: Its very hard to grow up in a perfect family when youre not perfect.I close my eyes, imagining his pain, and I cant begin to comprehend it.I shudder as I remember that I may have divulged too much.What have I confessed to Christian in my sleep?What secrets have I revealed?I stare at the BlackBerry in the vague hope that it will give me some answers.Rather unsurprisingly, it is not very forthcoming.As we havent taken off yet, I decide to email my Fifty Shades.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Homeward Bound  Date: June 3 2011 12:53 EST  To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grey  I am once again ensconced in first class, for which I thank you.I am counting the minutes until I see you this evening, and perhaps torturing the truth out of you about my nocturnal admissions.Your Ana x  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Homeward Bound  Date: June 3 2011 09:58  To: Anastasia Steele      Anastasia, I look forward to seeing you.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.His response makes me frown.It sounds clipped and formal, not his usual witty, pithy style.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Homeward Bound  Date: June 3 2011 13:01 EST  To: Christian Grey  Dearest Mr.Grey  I hope everything is okay re the situation.The tone of your email is worrying.Ana x  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Homeward Bound  Date: June 3 2011 10:04  To: Anastasia Steele  Anastasia  The situation could be better.Have you taken off yet?If so you should not be emailing.You are putting yourself at risk, in direct contravention of the rule regarding your personal safety.I meant what I said about punishments.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Crap.Okay.Jeez.What is eating him?Perhaps the situation?Maybe Taylors gone AWOL, maybe hes dropped a few million on the stock market  whatever the reason.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Over Reaction  Date: June 3 2011 13:06 EST  To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grumpy  The aircraft doors are still open.We are delayed but only by ten minutes.My welfare and that of the passengers around me is vouchsafed.You may stow your twitchy palm      for now.Miss Steele  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Apologies   Twitchy Palm Stowed  Date: June 3 2011 10:08  To: Anastasia Steele  I miss you and your smart mouth Miss Steele.I want you safely home.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Apology Accepted  Date: June 3 2011 13:10 EST  To: Christian Grey  They are shutting the doors.You wont hear another peep from me, especially given your deafness.Laters.Ana x  I switch off the BlackBerry, unable to shake my anxiety.Something is up with Christian.Perhaps the situation is out of hand.I sit back, glancing up at the locker where my bags are stowed.I managed this morning, with my mothers help, to buy Christian a small gift to say thank you for first class and for the gliding.I smile at the memory of the soaring   that was something else.I dont know yet if Ill give my silly gift to him.He might think its childish  and if hes in a strange mood, maybe not.I am both eager to return and apprehensive of what awaits me at my journeys end.As I mentally flick through all the scenarios that could be the situation, I become aware that once again the only empty seat is beside me.I shake my head as the thought crosses my mind that Christian might have purchased the adjacent seat so that I couldnt talk to anyone.I dismiss the idea as ridiculous  no one could be that controlling, that jealous, surely.I close my eyes as the plane taxis towards the runway.I emerge into the Sea Tac arrivals terminal eight hours later to find Taylor waiting and holding up a board that reads Miss A Steele.Honestly!But its good to see him.Hello, Taylor.Miss Steele, he greets me formally, but I see a hint of smile in his sharp brown eyes.He looks his usual immaculate self  smart charcoal suit, white shirt, and charcoal tie.I do know what you look like Taylor, you dont need a board, and I do wish youd call me, Ana.Ana.Can I take your bags, please?No, I can manage.Thank you.His lips tighten perceptibly.But, if youd be more comfortable taking them, I stammer.Thank you.He grabs my backpack and my newly acquired wheelie case for the clothes my mother has bought me.This way, maam.I sigh.Hes so polite.I remember, though I would like to erase it from my memory, that this man has bought me underwear.In fact  and the thought unsettles me  hes the only man whos ever bought me underwear.Even Rays never had to endure that hardship.We walk in silence to the black Audi SUV outside in the airport parking lot, and he holds the door open for me.I clamber in, wondering if wearing such a short skirt for the return to Seattle was a good idea.It was cool and welcome in Georgia.Here I feel exposed.Once Taylor has stowed my bags in the trunk, we set off for Escala.The journey is slow, caught up in rush hour traffic.Taylor keeps his eyes on the road ahead.Taciturn does not begin to describe him.I can bear the silence no longer.Hows Christian, Taylor?Mr.Grey is preoccupied, Miss Steele.Oh, this must be the situation.I am mining a seam of gold.Preoccupied?Yes, maam.I frown at Taylor, and he glances at me in the rear view mirror, our eyes meet.Hes saying no more.Jeez, he can be as tightlipped as the control freak himself.Is he okay?I believe so, maam.Are you more comfortable calling me, Miss Steele?Yes, maam.Oh, okay.Well, that curtails our conversation, and we continue in silence.I begin to think that Taylors recent slip, when he told me that Christian had been hell on wheels, was an anom aly.Perhaps hes embarrassed about it, worried that hes been disloyal.The silence is suffocating.Could you put some music on please?Certainly, maam.What would you like to hear?Something soothing.I see a smile play on Taylors lips as our eyes meet briefly again in the mirror.Yes, maam.He pushes a few buttons on the steering wheel, and the gentle strains of Pachelbels canon fills the space between us.Oh yes this is what I need.Thank you.I sit back as we drive slowly but steadily along the I 5 into Seattle.Twenty five minutes, later he drops me outside the impressive faade that is the entrance to Escala.In you go, maam, he says, holding the door open for me.Ill bring up your luggage is.H expression is soft, warm, avuncular even.Jeez Uncle Taylor, what a thought.Thank you for meeting me.Its a pleasure, Miss Steele.He smiles, and I head into the building.The doorman nods and waves.As I ride up to the thirtieth floor, a thousand butterflies stretch their wings and flutter erratically in my stomach.Why am I so nervous?And I know its because I have no idea what kind of mood Christians going to be in when I arrive.My inner goddess is hopeful for one type of mood, my subconscious, like me, is fraught with nerves.The elevator doors open, and Im in the foyer.It is so strange not to be met by Taylor.Of course, hes parking the car.In the great room, Christian is on his BlackBerry talking quietly as he stares out of the glass doors at the early evening Seattle skyline.Hes wearing a gray suit with the jacket undone, and hes running his hand through his hair, hes.H agi tated, tense even.Oh no  whats wrong?Agitated or not, hes still beyond beautiful.How can he look so arresting?Its such a pleasure to stand and drink in the sheer sight of him.No trace Okay Yes.He turns and sees me, and his whole demeanor changes.From tension to relief to something else: a look that calls directly to my inner goddess, a look of sensual carnality, gray eyes blazing.My mouth goes dry and desire blooms in my body whoa.Keep me informed, he snaps and shuts off his phone as he strides purposefully toward me.I stand paralyzed as he closes the distance between us, devouring me with his eyes.Holy shit somethings amiss  the strain in his jaw, the anxiety around his eyes.He shrugs out of his jacket, undoes his dark tie, and slings them both on to the couch en route to me.Then his arms are wrapped around me, and hes pulling me to him, hard, fast, gripping my ponytail to tilt my head up, kissing me like his life depends on it.What the hell?He drags the hair tie painfully out of my hair, but I dont care.Theres a desperate, primal quality to his kiss.He needs me, for whatever reason, at this point in time, and I have never felt so desired and coveted.Its dark and sensual and alarming all at the same time.I kiss him back with equal fervor, my fingers twisting and fisting in his hair.Our tongues entwined, our passion and ardor erupting between us.He tastes divine, hot, sexy, and his scent  all body wash and Christian is so arousing.He drags his mouth away from mine, and hes staring down at me, gripped by some unnamed emotion.Whats wrong?I breathe.Im so glad youre back.Shower with me  now.I cant decide if its a request or a command.Yes, I whisper, and he grabs my hand, leading me out of the big room into his bedroom to his bathroom.Once there, he releases me and sets the water running in the far too spacious shower.Turning slowly, he gazes at me, eyes hooded.I like your skirt.Its very short, he says, his voice low.You have great legs.He steps out of his shoes and reaches down to take each of his socks off, never taking his eyes off me.I am rendered speechless by the look of hunger in his eyes.Wow to be this wanted by this Greek god.I mirror his actions and step out of my black flats.Suddenly, he reaches for me, backing me up against the wall.Kissing me, my face, my throat, my lips running his hands into my hair.I feel the cool, smooth tiled wall at my back as he pushes himself against me so that Im flattened between his heat and the chill of the ceramic.Tentatively, I place my arms on his upper arms, and he groans as I squeeze tightly.I want you now.Here fast, hard, he breathes, and his hands are on my thighs, pushing up my skirt.Are you still bleeding?No.I flush.Good.His thumbs hook over my white cotton panties, and abruptly he drops to his knees as he tugs them off.My skirt is now rucked up so that Im naked from the waist down and panting, wanting.He grabs my hips, pushing me against the wall again, and kisses me at the apex of my thighs.Grabbing my upper thighs, he forces my legs apart.I groan loudly, feeling his tongue circling my clitoris.Oh my.Tipping my head back involuntarily, I moan as my fingers find their way into this hair.His tongue is relentless, strong and insistent, laving me  swirling round and round, again and again  non stop.Its exquisite, the intensity of feeling  its almost painful.My body starts to quicken, and he releases me.What?No!My breathing is ragged as I pant, gazing at him with delicious anticipation.He grabs my face with both hands, holding me firmly, and he kisses me hard, thrusting his tongue into my mouth so I can taste my arousal.Unzipping his fly, he frees himself, grabs the backs of my thighs, and lifts me.Wrap your legs around me, baby, he commands, his voice urgent, strained.I do as Im told and wrap my arms around his neck, and he moves quickly and sharply, filling me.Ah!He gasps, and I groan.Holding my behind, his fingers digging into my soft flesh, he begins to move, slowly at first  a steady even tempo but as his control unravels, he speeds up faster, and faster.Ahhh!I tip my head back and concentrate on the invading, punishing, heavenly sensation pushing me, pushing me onward, higher, up and when I can take no more, I explode around him, spiraling into an intense, all consuming orgasm.He lets go with a deep growl, and he buries his head in my neck as he buries himself inside me, groaning loudly and incoherently as he finds his release.His breathing is erratic, but he kisses me tenderly, not moving, still inside me, and I blink, unseeing into his eyes.As he comes into focus, he gently pulls out of me, holding me steady while I place my feet on the floor.The bathroom is now cloudy with steam  and hot.I feel overdressed.You seem pleased to see me, I murmur with a shy smile.His lips quirk up.Yes, Miss Steele, I think my pleasure is pretty self evident.Come  let me get you in the shower.He undoes the next three buttons of his shirt, removes the cufflinks, tugs it over his head, and discards it on the floor.Removing his suit pants and boxer briefs, he kicks them to one side.He begins to undo the buttons on my blouse while I watch him, yearning to reach out and stroke his chest, but I contain myself.How was your journey?he asks mildly.He seems so much calmer now, his apprehension gone, dissolved by sexual congress.Fine, thank you, I murmur, still breathless.Thanks once again for first class.It really is a much nicer way to travel.I smile shyly at him.I have some news, I add nervously.Oh?he looks down at me as he undoes the last button, slips my blouse down my arms, and throws it on top of his discarded clothes.I have a job.He stills, then smiles at me, his eyes warm and soft.Congratulations, Miss Steele.Now will you tell me where?he teases.You dont know?He shakes his head, frowning slightly.Why would I know?With your stalking capabilities, I thought you might have  I trail off as his face falls.Anastasia, I wouldnt dream of interfering in your career, unless you ask me to, of course.He looks wounded.So you have no idea which company?No.I know there are four publishing companies in Seattle  so I am assuming its one of them.SIP  Oh, the small one, good.Well done.He leans forward and kisses my forehead.Clever girl.When do you start?Monday.That soon, eh?Id better take advantage of you while I still can.Turn round.I am thrown by his casual command, but do as Im bid, and he undoes my bra and unzips my skirt.He pushes my skirt down, cupping my behind as he does, and kissing my shoulder.He leans against, me and his nose nuzzles my hair, inhaling deeply.He squeezes my buttocks.You intoxicate me, Miss Steele, and you calm me.Such a heady combination.He kisses my hair.Grabbing my hand, he tugs me into the shower.Ow, I squeal.The water is practically scalding.Christian grins down at me as the water cascades over him.Its only a little hot water.And actually hes right.It feels heavenly, washing off the sticky Georgia morning and the stickiness from our lovemaking.Turn round, he orders, and I comply, turning to face the wall.I want to wash you,  he murmurs and reaches for the body wash.He squirts a little into his hand.I have something else to tell you, I murmur as his hands start on my shoulders.Oh, yes?he asks mildly.I steel myself with a deep breath.My friend Joss photography show is opening Thursday in Portland.He stills, his hands hovering over my breasts.I have emphasized the word friend.Yes, what about it?he asks sternly.I said I would go.Do you want to come with me?After what feels like a monumental amount of time, he slowly starts washing me again.What time?The opening is at 7:30 p. m.   He kisses my ear.Okay.Inside my subconscious relaxes and then collapses, slumped into an old battered arm chair.Were you nervous about asking me?Yes.How can you tell?Anastasia, your whole bodys just relaxed, he says dryly.Well, you just seem to be um on the jealous side.Yes, I am, he says darkly.And youd do well to remember that.But thank you for asking.Well take Charlie Tango.Oh, the helicopter of course, silly me.More flying cool!I grin.Can I wash you?I ask.I dont think so, he murmurs, and he kisses me gently on my neck to take the sting out of his refusal.I pout at the wall as he caresses my back with soap.Will you ever let me touch you?I ask boldly.He stills again, his hand on my behind.Put your hands on the wall Anastasia.Im going to take you again, he murmurs in my ear as he grabs my hips, and I know that the discussion is over.Later we are seated at the breakfast bar, dressed in bathrobes, having consumed Mrs.Joness rather excellent pasta alle vongole.More wine?Christian asks, gray eyes glowing.A small glass, please.The Sancerre is crisp and delicious.Christian pours one for me and one for himself.Hows the um situation that bought you to Seattle?I ask tentatively.He frowns.Out of hand, he murmurs bitterly.But nothing for you to worry about, Anastasia.I have plans for you this evening.Oh?Yes.I want you ready and waiting in my playroom in fifteen minutes.He stands and gazes down at me.You can get ready in your room.Incidentally, the walk in closet is now full of clothes for you.I dont want any arguments about them.He narrows his eyes, daring me to say something.When I dont, he stalks off to his study.Me!Argue?With you, Fifty Shades?Its more than my backsides worth.I sit on the bar stool, momentarily stupefied, trying to assimilate this morsel of information.Hes bought me clothes.I roll my eyes in an exaggerated fashion knowing full well he cant see me.Car, phone, computer clothes, itll be a damn condo next, and then I really will be his mistress.Ho!My subconscious has her snarky face on.I ignore her and make my way upstairs toward my room so, it is still mine why?I thought hed agreed to let me sleep with him.I suppose hes not used to sharing his personal space, but then, neither am I.  I console myself with the thought that at least I have somewhere to escape from him.Examining the door, I find that it has a lock but no key.I wonder briefly if Mrs.Jones has a spare.Ill ask her.I open the closet door and close it again quickly.Holy Crap  hes spent a fortune.It resembles Kates  so many clothes hanging neatly on the rail.Deep down, I know that theyll all fit.But I have no time to think about that  I have to get kneeling in the Red Room of Pain or Pleasure  hopefully this evening.Kneeling by the door, I am naked except for my panties.My heart is in my mouth.Jeez, I thought after the bathroom he would have had enough.The man is insatiable, or maybe all men are like him.I have no idea, no one to compare him too.Closing my eyes, I try to calm myself down, to connect with my inner sub.Shes there somewhere, hiding behind my inner goddess.Anticipation runs bubbling like soda through my veins.What will he do?I take a deep steadying breath, but I cannot deny it, Im excited, aroused, wet already.This is so I want to think wrong, but somehow its not.Its right for Christian.Its what he wants  and after the last few days after all hes done, I have to man up and take whatever he decides he wants, whatever he thinks he needs.The memory of his look when I came in this evening, the longing in his face, his determined stride toward me like I was an oasis in the desert.Id do almost anything to see that look again.I press my thighs together at the delicious memory, and it reminds me that I need to spread my knees.I shuffle them apart.How long will he make me wait?The wait is crippling me, crippling me with a dark and tantalizing desire.I glance quickly around the subtly lit room; the cross, the table, the couch, the bench that bed.It looms so large, and its made up with red satin sheets.Which piece of apparatus will he use?The door opens and Christian breezes in, ignoring me completely.I glance down quickly, staring at my hands, positioned with care on my spread thighs.Placing something on the large chest beside the door, he strolls casually toward the bed.I indulge myself in a quick glimpse at him, and my heart almost lurches to a stop.Hes naked except for those soft ripped jeans, top button casually undone.Jeez, he looks so freaking hot.My subconscious is frantically fanning herself, and my inner goddess is swaying and writhing to some primal carnal rhythm.Shes so ready.I lick my lips instinctively.My blood pounds through my body, thick and heavy with salacious hunger.What is he going to do to me?Turning, he nonchalantly walks back to the chest of drawers.Opening one, he begins to remove items and place them on the top.My curiosity burns, blazes even, but I resist the overwhelming temptation to sneak a quick peek.When he finishes what hes doing, he comes to stand in front of me.I can see his naked feet, and I want to kiss every inch of them run my tongue over his instep, suck each of his toes.Holy shit.You look lovely, he breathes.I keep my head down, conscious that hes staring at me while I am practically naked.I feel the flush as it slowly spreads over my face.He bends down and cups my chin, forcing my face up to meet his gaze.You are one beautiful woman, Anastasia.And youre all mine, he murmurs.Stand up.His command is soft full of sensual promise.Shakily, I get to my feet.Look at me, he breathes, and I stare up into his smoldering gray gaze.It is his Dom gaze  cold, hard, and sexy as hell, seven shades of sin in one enticing look.My mouth dries, and I know I will do anything he asks.An almost cruel smile plays across his lips.We dont have a signed contract, Anastasia.But weve discussed limits.And I want to re iterate we have safe words, okay?Holy fuck what has he got planned that I need safe words?What are they?he asks authoritatively.I frown slightly at his question, and his face hardens perceptibly.What are the safe words, Anastasia?he says slowly and deliberately.Yellow, I mumble.And?he prompts, his mouth setting in a hard line.Red, I breathe.Remember those.And I cant help it I raise my eyebrow at him and am about to remind him of my GPA, but the sudden frosty glint in his icy gray eyes stops me in my tracks.Dont start with your smart mouth in here, Miss Steele.Or I will fuck it with you on your knees.Do you understand?I swallow instinctively.Okay.I blink rapidly, chastened.Actually, its his tone of voice, rather than the threat, that intimidates me.Well?Yes, Sir, I mumble hastily.Good girl, he pauses as he stares at me.My intention is not that you should safeword because youre in pain.What I intend to do to you will be intense.Very intense, and you have to guide me.Do you understand?Not really.Intense?Wow.This is about touch, Anastasia.You will not be able to see me or hear me.But youll be able to feel me.I frown  not hear him?How is that going to work?He turns, and I hadnt noticed that above the chest is a sleek, flat, matt black box.As he waves his hand in front, the box splits in half: two doors slide open revealing a CD player and a host of buttons.Christian presses several of these buttons in sequence.Nothing happens, but he seems satisfied.I am mystified.When he turns to face me again, he wears his small I have a secret smile.I am going to tie you to that bed, Anastasia.But Im going to blindfold you first and,  he reveals his iPod in his hand, you will not be able to hear me.All you will hear is the music I am going to play for you.Okay.A musical interlude, not what I was expecting.Does he ever do what I expect?Jeez, I hope its not rap.Come.Taking my hand, he leads me over to the antique four poster bed.There are shackles attached at each corner, fine metal chains with leather cuffs, glinting against the red satin.Oh boy, I think my heart is going to leave my chest, and Im melting from the inside out, desire coursing through me.Could I be any more excited?Stand here.I am facing the bed.He leans down and whispers in my ear.Wait here, keep your eyes on the bed.Picture yourself lying here bound and totally at my mercy.Oh my.He moves away for a moment, and I can hear him near the door fetching something.All my senses are hyper alert, my hearing more acute.Hes picked up something from the rack of whips and paddles by the door.Holy cow.What is he going to do?I feel him behind me.He takes my hair, pulls it into a ponytail behind me, and starts to braid it.While I like your pigtails, Anastasia, I am too impatient to be at you right now.So one will have to do.His voice is low, soft.His deft fingers skim my back occasionally as they work down my hair, and each casual touch is like a sweet, electric shock against my skin.He fastens the end with a hair tie, then gently tugs the braid so that Im forced to step back flush against him.He pulls again to the side so that I angle my head, giving him easier access to my neck.Leaning down, he nuzzles my neck.Tracing his teeth and tongue from the base of my ear to my shoulder.He hums softly as he does, and the sound resonates through me.Right down...right down there, inside me.Unbidden, I groan quietly.Hush now, he breathes against my skin.He holds up his hands in front of me, his arms touching mine.In his right hand is a flogger.I remember the name from my first introduction to this room.Touch it, he whispers, and he sounds like the devil himself.My body flames in response.Tentatively, I reach out and brush the long strands.It has many long fronds, all soft suede with small beads at the end.I will use this.It will not hurt, but it will bring your blood to the surface of your skin and make you very sensitive.Oh, he says it wont hurt.What are the safe words, Anastasia?Um yellow and red, Sir, I whisper.Good girl.Remember, most of your fear is in your mind.He drops the flogger on the bed, and his hands move to my waist.You wont be needing these, he murmurs and hooks his fingers into my panties and sweeps them down my legs.I step unsteadily out of them, supporting myself on the ornate post of the bed.Stand still, he orders, and he kisses my behind and then gently nips me twice, making me tense.Now lie down.Face up, he adds as he smacks me hard on the behind, making me jump.Hastily, I crawl onto the beds hard, unyielding mattress and lie down, looking up at him.The satin of the sheet beneath me is soft and cool against my skin.His gaze is impassive, except for his eyes which glow with a barely leashed excitement.Hands above your head, he orders, and I do as Im bid.Jeez, my body hungers for him.I want him already.He turns, and out of the corner of my eye, I watch him saunter back over to the chest of drawers, returning with the iPod and what looks like an eye mask, similar to the one I used on my flight to Atlanta.The thought makes me want to smile, but I cant quite make my lips cooperate.I am too consumed with anticipation.I just know my face is completely immobile, my eyes huge, as I gaze at him.Sitting down on the edge of the bed, he shows me the iPod.It has a strange antenna device as well headphones.How odd.I frown as I try to figure this out.This transmits whats playing on the iPod to the system in the room., Christian answers my unspoken query as he taps the small antenna.I can hear what youre hearing, and I have a remote control unit for it.He smirks his private joke smile and holds up a small, flat device that looks like a very hip calculator.He leans across me, inserting the ear buds gently into my ears, and puts the iPod down somewhere on the bed above my head.Lift your head, he commands, and I do so immediately.Slowly, he slides the mask on, pulling the elastic over the back of my head, and Im blind.The elastic on the mask holds the ear buds in place.I can still hear him, though the sound is muffled as he rises from the bed.Im deafened by my own breathing  its shallow and erratic, reflecting my excitement.Christian takes my left arm, stretches it gently to the left hand corner, and attaches the leather cuff around my wrist.His long fingers stroke the length of my arm once hes finished .Oh!His touch elicits a delicious, tickly shiver.I hear him move slowly round to the other side, takes my right arm and cuffs it.Again, his long fingers linger along my arm.Oh my I am fit to burst already.Why is this so erotic?He moves to the bottom of the bed and grabs both of my ankles.Lift your head again, he orders.I comply, and he drags me down the bed so that my arms are stretched out and almost straining at the cuffs.Holy cow, I cannot move my arms.A frisson of trepidation mixed with tantalizing exhilaration sweeps through my body, making me wetter.I groan.Parting my legs, he cuffs first my right ankle and then my left so I am staked out, spread eagled, and totally vulnerable to him.Its so unnerving that I cant see him.I listen hard whats he doing?And I hear nothing, just my breathing and the pounding thud of my heart as blood pulses furiously against my eardrums.Abruptly, the soft silent hiss and pop of the iPod springs into life.From inside my head, a lone angelic voice sings unaccompanied a long sweet note, and its joined almost immediately by another voice, and then more voices  Holy cow, a celestial choir  singing acapella in my head, an ancient, ancient hymnal.What in heavens name is this?I have never heard anything like it.Something almost unbearably soft brushes against my neck, running languidly down my throat, slowly across my chest, over my breasts, caressing me pulling at my nipples, its so soft, skimming underneath.Its so unexpected.Its fur!A fur glove?Christian trails his hand, unhurried and deliberate, down to my belly, circling my navel, then carefully from hip to hip, and Im trying to anticipate where hes going next but the music its in my head transporting me the fur across the line of my pubic hair  between my legs, along my thighs, down one leg up the other it almost tickles but not quite more voices join the heavenly choir all singing different parts, their voices blending blissfully and sweetly together in a melodic harmony that is beyond anything Ive ever heard.I catch one word    deus   and I realize they are singing in Latin.And still, the fur is moving down my arms and round my waist back up across my breasts.My nipples harden beneath the soft touch and Im panting wondering where his hand will go next.Suddenly, the fur is gone, and I can feel the fronds of the flogger flowing over my skin, following the same path as the fur, and its so hard to concentrate with the music in my head  it sounds like a hundred voices singing, weaving an ethereal tapestry of fine, silken gold and silver through my head, mixed with the feel of the soft suede against my skin trailing over me oh my abruptly, it disappears.Then suddenly, sharply, it bites down on my belly.Aagghh!I cry out.It takes me by surprise, and it doesnt exactly hurt, but tingles all over, and he hits me again.Harder.Aaah!I want to move, to writhe to escape, or to welcome, each blow I dont know  its so overwhelming I cant pull my arms my legs are stuck I am held very firmly in place and again he strikes across my breasts  I cry out.And its a sweet agony  bearable, just pleasant  no, not immediately, but as my skin sings with each blow in perfect counterpoint to the music in my head, I am dragged into a dark, dark part of my psyche that surrenders to this most erotic sensation.Yes  I get this.He hits me across my hip.Then,t moves in swift blows over my pubic hair, on my thighs, and down my inner thighs and back up my body across my hips.He keeps going as the music reaches a climax, and then suddenly  the music stops.And so does he.Then the singing starts again building and building, and he rains down blows on me and I groan and writhe.Once again, it ceases and all is quiet except my wild breathing and wild yearning.For oh  whats happening?Whats he going to do now?The excitement is almost unbearable.Ive entered a very dark, carnal place.The bed moves and shifts as I feel him clamber over me, and the song starts again.Hes got it on repeat this time its his nose and lips that take the place of the fur running down my neck and throat, kissing, sucking trailing down to my breasts Ah!Taunting each of my nipples in turn his tongue swirling round one while his fingers relentlessly tease the other I groan, loudly I think, though I cant hear.I am lost.Lost in him lost in the astral, seraphic voices lost to all the sensations I cannot escape I am completely at the mercy of his expert touch.He moves down to my belly  his tongue circling my navel  following the path of the flogger and the fur I moan.Hes kissing and sucking and nibbling moving south  and then his tongue is there.At, a the junction of my thighs.I throw my head back and cry out as I almost detonate into orgasm Im on the brink, and he stops.No!The bed shifts, and he kneels between my legs.He leans toward the bedpost, and the cuff on my ankle is suddenly gone.I pull my leg to the middle of the bed resting it against him.He leans over to the opposite post and frees my other leg.His hands travel quickly down both my legs, squeezing and kneading, bringing life back into them.Then, grasping my hips, he lifts me so that my back is no longer on the bed.I am arched, resting on my shoulders.What?Hes kneeling up between my legs and in one swift, slamming move hes inside me oh fuck and I cry out again.The quiver of my impending orgasm begins, and he stills.The quiver dies oh no hes going to torture me further.Please!I wail.He grips me harder in warning?I dont know, his fingers digging into the flesh of my behind as I lay panting so I purposefully still.Very slowly, he starts to move again  out and then in agonizingly slowly .Holy fuck  Please!Im screaming inside And as the number of voices in the choral piece increases so does his pace, infinitesimally, hes so controlled so in time with the music.And I can no longer bear it.Please, I beg, and in one swift move, he lowers me back onto the bed, and hes lying on top of me, his hands on the bed beside my breasts as he supports his weight, and he thrusts into me,.as A the music reaches its climax, I fall free fall into the most intense, agonizing orgasm I have ever had, and Christian follows me thrusting hard into me, three more times finally stilling, then collapsing on top of me.As my consciousness returns from wherever its been, Christian pulls out of me.The music has stopped, and I can feel him stretch across my body as he undoes the cuff on my right wrist.I groan as my hand is freed.He quickly frees my other hand, gently pulls the mask from my eyes, and removes the ear buds.I blink in the dim soft light and stare up into his intense gray gaze.Hi, he murmurs.Hi, yourself, I breathe shyly back at him.His lips quirk up into a smile, and he leans down and kisses me softly.Well done, you, he whispers.Turn over.Holy fuck  whats he going to do now?His eyes soften.Im just going to rub your shoulders.Oh okay.I roll stiffly onto my front.I am so tired.Christian sits astride me and starts to massage my shoulders.I groan loudly  he has such strong, knowing fingers.Leaning down, he kisses my head.What was that music?I mumble almost inarticulately.Its called Spem In Alium, or the Forty Part Motet, by Thomas Tallis.It was overwhelming.Ive always wanted to fuck to it.Not another first, Mr.Grey?Indeed, Miss Steele.I groan again as his fingers work their magic on my shoulders.Well, its the first time Ive fucked to it, too, I murmur sleepily.Hmm you and I, were giving each other many firsts.His voice is matter of fact.What did I say to you in my sleep, Ch  err, Sir?His hands pause their ministrations for a moment.You said lots of things, Anastasia.You talked about cages and strawberries that you wanted more and that you missed me.Oh, thank heavens for that.Is that all?The relief in my voice is evident.Christian stops his heavenly massage and shifts so that hes lying beside me.His head propped up on his elbow.Hes frowning.What did you think youd said?Oh crap.That I thought you were ugly, conceited, and that you were hopeless in bed.He crease on his brow deepens.Well, naturally I am all those things, and now youve got me really intrigued.What are you hiding from me, Miss Steele?I blink at him innocently.Im not hiding anything.Anastasia, you are a hopeless liar.I thought you were going to make me giggle after sex, this isnt doing it for me.His lips quirk up.I cant tell jokes.Mr.Grey!Something you cant do?I grin at him, and he grins back.No, hopeless joke teller.He looks so proud of himself that I start to giggle.Im a hopeless joke teller too,  That is such a lovely sound, he murmurs, and he leans forward and kisses me.And you are hiding something, Anastasia.I may have to torture it out of you.I wake with a jolt.I think Ive just fallen down some stairs in a dream, and I bolt upright, momentarily disorientated.It is dark, and Im in Christians bed alone.Something has woken me, some nagging thought.I glance over at the alarm clock on his bedside.It is 5:00 in the morning, but I feel rested.Why is that?Oh  its the time difference  it would be 8:00 a. m.  in Georgia.Holy crap I need to take my pill.I clamber out of bed, grateful for whatever it is that has woken me.I can hear faint notes from the piano.Christian is playing.This I must see.I love watching him play.Naked, I grab my bathrobe from the chair and wander quietly down the corridor, slipping on my robeand listening to the magical sound of the melodic lament thats coming from the great room.Shrouded in darkness, Christian sits in a bubble of light as he plays, and his hair glints with burnished copper highlights.He looks naked, though I know hes wearing his PJ  bottoms.Hes concentrating, playing beautifully, lost in the melancholy of the music.I hesitate, watching from the shadows, not wanting to interrupt him.I want to hold him.He looks lost, sad even, and achingly lonely  or maybe its just the music thats so full of poignant sorrow.He finishes the piece, pauses for a split second, then starts to play it again.I move cautiously toward him, drawn as the moth to the flame the idea makes me smile.He glances up at me and frowns before his gaze returns to his hands Oh crap, is he pissed off that I am disturbing him?You should be asleep, he scolds mildly.I can tell hes pre occupied with something.So should you, I retort not quite as mildly.He glances up again, his lips twitching with a trace of a smile.Are you scolding me, Miss Steele?Yes, Mr.Grey, I am.Well, I cant sleep.He frowns once more as a trace of irritation or anger flashes across his face.With me?Surely not.I ignore his facial expression and very bravely sit down beside him on the piano stool, placing my head on his bare shoulder to watch his deft, agile fingers caress the keys.He pauses fractionally, and then continues to the end of the piece.What was that?I ask softly.Chopin.Opus 28, number 4.In E minor, if youre interested, he murmurs.Im always interested in what you do.He turns and softly presses his lips against my hair.I didnt mean to wake you.You didnt.Play the other one.Other one?The Bach piece that you played the first night I stayed.Oh, the Marcello.He starts to play slowly and deliberately.I feel the movement of his hands in his shoulder as I lean against him and close my eyes.The sad, soulful notes swirl slowly and mournfully around us, echoing off the walls.It is a hauntingly beautiful piece, sadder even than the Chopin, and I lose myself to the beauty of the lament.To a certain extent, it reflects how I feel.The deep poignant longing I have to know this extraordinary man better, to try and understand his sadness.All too soon, the piece is at an end.Why do you only play such sad music?I sit upright and gaze up at him as he shrugs in answer to my question, his expression wary.So you were just six when you started to play?I prompt.He nods, his wary look intensifying.After a moment he volunteers.I threw myself into learning the piano to please my new mother.To fit into the perfect family?Yes, so to speak, he says evasively.Why are you awake?Dont you need to recover from yesterdays exertions?Its 8:00 in the morning for me.And I need to take my pill.He raises his eyebrows in surprise.Well remembered, he murmurs, and I can tell hes impressed.His lips quirk up in a half smile.Only you would start a course of time specific birth control pills in a different time zone.Perhaps you should wait half an hour and then another half hour tomorrow morning.So s eventually you can take them at a reasonable time.Good plan, I breathe.So what shall we do for half an hour?I blink innocently at him.I can think of a few things, he grins, gray eyes bright.I gaze back impassively as my insides clench and melt under his knowing look.On the other hand, we could talk, I suggest quietly.His brow creases.I prefer what I have in mind.He scoops me onto his lap.Youd always rather have sex than talk, I laugh, steadying myself by holding on to his upper arms.True.Especially with you.He nuzzles my hair and starts a steady trail of kisses from below my ear to my throat.Maybe on my piano, he whispers.Oh my.My whole body tightens at the thought.Piano.Wow.I want to get something straight, I whisper as my pulse starts to accelerate, and my inner goddess closes her eyes, reveling in the feel of his lips on me.He pauses momentarily before continuing his sensual assault.Always so eager for information, Miss Steele.What needs straightening out?he breathes against my skin at the base of my neck, continuing his soft gentle kisses.Us, I whisper as I close my eyes.Hmm.What about us?He pauses his trail of kisses along my shoulder.The contract.He lifts his head to gaze down at me, a hint of amusement in his eyes, and sighs.He strokes his fingertips down my cheek.Well, I think the contract is moot, dont you?His voice is low and husky, his eyes soft.Moot?Moot.He smiles.I gape at him quizzically.But you were so keen.Well, that was before.Anyway, the Rules arent moot, they still stand.His expression hardens slightly.Before?Before what?Before, He pauses, and the wary expression is back, more.He shrugs.Oh.Besides, weve been in the playroom twice now, and you havent run screaming for the hills.Do you expect me to?Nothing you do is expected, Anastasia, he says dryly.So, let me be clear.You just want me to follow the Rules element of the contract all the time but not the rest of the contract?Except in the playroom.I want you to follow the spirit of the contract in the playroom, and yes, I want you to follow the rules  all the time.Then I know youll be safe, and Ill be able to have you anytime I wish.And if I break one of the rules?Then Ill punish you.But wont you need my permission?Yes, I will.And if I say no?He gazes at me for a moment, with a confused expression.If you say no, youll say no.Ill have to find a way to persuade you.I pull away from him and stand.I need some distance.He frowns as I stare down at him.He looks puzzled and wary again.So the punishment aspect remains.Yes, but only if you break the rules.Ill need to re read them, I say, trying to recall the detail.Ill fetch them for you.His tone is suddenly businesslike.Whoa.This has gotten serious so quickly.He rises from the piano and walks lithely to his study.My scalp prickles.Jeez, I need some tea.The future of our so called relationship is being discussed at 5:45 in the morning when hes pre occupied with something else   is this wise?I head into the kitchen which is still shrouded in darkness.Where are the light switches?I find them, flick them on, and pour water into the kettle.My pill!I rum mage in my purse that I left on the breakfast bar and find them quickly.One swallow, and Im done.By the time I finish, Christian is back, sitting on one of the bar stools, watching me intently.Here you go.He pushes a typed piece of paper toward me, and I notice that hes crossed some things out.RULES   Obedience:   The Submissive will obey any instructions given by The Dominant immediately without hesitation or reservation and in an expeditious manner.The Submissive will agree to

Anastasia?He breathes.Oh fuck.Possibly, depends what your reaction is.Same as always, he says, shaking his head slightly, his eyes alight with excitement.I swallow instinctively and a frisson of exhilaration runs through me.So...Holy shit.What am I going to do?Yes?He licks his lower lip.You want to spank me now.Yes.And I will.Oh, really, Mr.Grey?I challenge, grinning back at him.Two can play this game.Are you going to stop me?Youre going to have to catch me first.His eyes widen a fraction, and he grins, slowly getting to his feet.Oh, really, Miss Steele?The breakfast bar is between us.I have never been so grateful for its existence than in this moment.And youre biting your lip, he breathes, moving slowly to his left as I move to mine.You wouldnt, I tease.After all, you roll your eyes.I try reasoning with him.He continues to move toward his left, as do I.   Yes, but youve just raised the bar on the excitement stakes with this game.His eyes blaze, and wild anticipation emanates from him.Im quite fast you know.I try for nonchalance.So am I.   Hes stalking me, in his own kitchen.Are you going to come quietly?he asks.Do I ever?Miss Steele, what do you mean?he smirks.Itll be worse for you if I have to come and get you.Thats only if you catch me, Christian.And right now, I have no intention of letting you catch me.Anastasia, you may fall and hurt yourself.Which will put you in direct contravention of rule number seven.I have been in danger since I met you, Mr.Grey, rules or no rules.Yes you have.He pauses, and his brow furrows slightly.Suddenly, he lunges for me, making me squeal and run for the dining room table.I manage to escape, putting the table between us.My heart is pounding and adrenaline has spiked through my body boy...this is so thrilling.Im a child again, though thats not right.I watch him carefully as he paces deliberately toward me.I inch away.You certainly know how to distract a man, Anastasia.We aim to please, Mr.Grey.Distract you from what?Life.The universe.He waves one of his hands vaguely.You did seem very pre occupied as you were playing.He stops and folds his arms, his expression amused.We can do this all day, baby, but I will get you, and it will just be worse for you when I do.No, you wont.I must not be over confident.I repeat this as a mantra.My subconscious has found her Nikes, and shes on the starting blocks.Anyone would think you didnt want me to catch you.I dont.Thats the point.I feel about punishment the way you feel about me touching you.His entire demeanor changes in a nanosecond.Gone is playful Christian, and he stands staring at me as if Id slapped him.Hes ashen.Thats how you feel?he whispers.Those four words, and the way he utters them, speaks volumes.Oh no.They tell me so much more about him and how he feels.They tell me about his fear and loathing.I frown.No, I dont feel that bad.No way.Do I?No.It doesnt affect me quite as much as that, but it gives you an idea, I murmur, staring anxiously at him.Oh, he says.Crap.He looks completely and utterly lost, like Ive pulled the rug from under his feet.Taking a deep breath, I move round the table until I am standing in front of him, gazing into his apprehensive eyes.You hate it that much?he breathes, his eyes filled with horror.Well no, I reassure him.Jeez  thats how he feels about people touching him?No.I feel ambivalent about it.I dont like it, but I dont hate it.But last night, in the playroom, you  he trails off.I do it for you, Christian, because you need it.I dont.You didnt hurt me last night.That was in a different context, and I can rationalize that internally, and I trust you.But when you want to punish me, I worry that youll hurt me.His gray eyes blaze like a turbulent storm.Time moves, and expands and slips away before he answers softly.I want to hurt you.But not beyond anything that you couldnt take.Fuck!Why?He runs his hand through his hair, and he shrugs.I just need it.He pauses, gazing at me with anguish, and he closes his eyes and shakes his head.I cant tell you, he whispers.Cant or wont?Wont.So you know why.Yes.But you wont tell me.If I do, you will run screaming from this room, and youll never want to return.He stares at me warily.I cant risk that, Anastasia.You want me to stay.More than you know.I couldnt bear to lose you.Oh my.He gazes down at me, and suddenly, he pulls me into his arms and hes kissing me, kissing me passionately.It takes me completely by surprise, and I sense his panic and desperate need in his kiss.Dont leave me.You said you wouldnt leave me, and you begged me not to leave you, in your sleep, he murmurs against my lips.Oh my nocturnal confessions.I dont want to go.And my heart clenches, turning itself inside out.This is a man in need.His fear is naked and obvious, but hes lost somewhere in his darkness.His eyes wide and bleak and tortured.I can soothe him.Join him briefly in the darkness and bring him into the light.Show me, I whisper.Show you?Show me how much it can hurt.What?Punish me.I want to know how bad it can get.Christian steps back away from me, completely confused.You would try?Yes.I said I would.But I have an ulterior motive.If I do this for him, maybe he will let me touch him.He blinks at me.Ana, youre so confusing.Im confused too.Im trying to work this out.And you and I will know, once and for all, if I can do this.If I can handle this, then maybe you  My words fail me, and his eyes widen again.He knows I am referring to the touch thing.For a moment, he looks torn, but then a steely resolve settles on his features, and he narrows his eyes, gazing at me speculatively as if weighing up alternatives.Abruptly, he clasps my arm in a firm grip and turns, leading me out of the great room, up the stairs, and to the playroom.Pleasure and pain, reward and punishment  his words from so long ago echo through my mind.Ill show you how bad it can be, and you can make your own mind up.He pauses by the door.Are you ready for this?I nod, my mind made up, and Im vaguely lightheaded, faint as all the blood leaves my face.He opens the door, and still grasping my arm, grabs what looks like a belt from the rack beside the door, then leads me over to the red leather bench in the far corner of the room.Bend over the bench, he murmurs softly.Okay.I can do this.I bend over the smooth soft leather.Hes left my bathrobe on.In a quiet part of my brain, Im vaguely surprised that he hasnt made me take it off.Holy fuck this is going to hurt I know.My subconscious has passed out, and my inner goddess is endeavoring to look brave.Were here because you said yes, Anastasia.And you ran from me.I am going to hit you six times, and you will count with me.Why the hell doesnt he just get on with it?He always makes such a meal of punishing me.I roll my eyes, knowing full well he cant see me.He lifts the hem of my bathrobe, and for some reason, this feels more intimate than being naked.He gently caresses my behind, running his warm hand all over both cheeks and down to the tops of my thighs.I am doing this so that you remember not to run from me, and as exciting as it is, I never want you to run from me, he whispers.And the irony is not lost on me.I was running to avoid this.If hed opened his arms, Id run to him, not away from him.And you rolled your eyes at me.You know how I feel about that.Suddenly, its gone   that nervous edgy fear in his voice.Hes back from wherever hes been.I hear it in his tone, in the way he places his fingers on my back, holding me  and the atmosphere in the room changes.I close my eyes, bracing myself for the blow.It comes hard, snapping across my backside, and the bite of the belt is everything I feared.I cry out involuntarily, and take a huge gulp of air.Count, Anastasia!he commands.One!I shout at him, and it sounds like an expletive.He hits me again, and the pain pulses and echoes along the line of the belt.Holy shit  that smarts.Two!I scream.It feels so good to scream.His breathing is ragged and harsh.Whereas mine is almost non existent as I desperately scrabble around my psyche looking for some internal strength.The belt cuts into my flesh again.Three!Tears spring unwelcome into my eyes.Jeez  this is harder than I thought   so much harder than the spanking.Hes not holding anything back.Four!I yell as the belt bites me again, and now the tears are streaming down my face.I dont want to cry.It angers me that I am crying.He hits me again.Five.My voice is more a choked, strangled sob, and in this moment, I think I hate him.One more, I can do one more.My backside feels as if its on fire.Six, I whisper as the blistering pain cuts across me again, and I hear him drop the belt behind me, and hes pulling me into his arms, all breathless and compassionate and I want none of him.Let go no...And I find myself struggling out his grasp, pushing him away.Fighting him.Dont touch me!I hiss.I straighten and stare at him, and hes watching me as if I might bolt, gray eyes wide, bemused.I dash the tears angrily out of my eyes with the backs of my hands, glaring at him.This is what you really like?Me, like this?I use the sleeve of the bathrobe to wipe my nose.He gazes at me warily.Well, you are one fucked up son of a bitch.Ana, he pleads, shocked.Dont you dare, Ana me!You need to sort your shit out, Grey!And with that, I turn stiffly, and I walk out of the playroom, closing the door quietly behind me.I clasp the door handle behind me and briefly lean back against the door.Where to go?Do I run?Do I stay?I am so mad, angry scalding tears spill down my cheeks, and I brush them furiously aside.I just want to curl up.Curl up and recuperate in some way.Heal my shattered faith.How could I have been so stupid?Of course it hurts.Tentatively, I rub my backside.Aah!Its sore.Where to go?Not his room.My room, or the room that will be mine, no, is mine was mine.This is why he wanted me to keep it.He knew I would need distance from him.I launch myself stiffly in that direction, conscious that Christian may follow me.It is still dark in the bedroom, dawn only a whisper in the skyline.I climb awkwardly into bed, careful not to sit on my aching and tender backside.I keep the bathrobe on, wrapping it around me, and curl up and really let go  sobbing hard into my pillow.What was I thinking?Why did I let him do that to me?I wanted the dark, to explore how bad it could be  but its too dark for me.I cannot do this.Yet, this is what he does, this is how he gets his kicks.What a monumental wake up call.And to be fair to him, he warned me and warned me, time and again.Hes not normal.He has needs that I cannot fulfill.I realize that now.I dont want him to hit me like that again, ever.I think of the couple of times he has hit me, and how easy he was on me by comparison.Is that enough for him?I sob harder into the pillow.I am going to lose him.He wont want to be with me if I cant give him this.Why, why, why have I fallen in love with Fifty Shades?Why?Why cant I love Jos, or Paul Clayton, or someone like me?Oh, his distraught look as I left.I was so cruel, so shocked by the savagery will he forgive me will I forgive him?My thoughts are all haywire and jumbled, echoing and bouncing off the inside of my skull.My subconscious is shaking her head sadly, and my inner goddess is nowhere to be seen.Oh, this is a dark morning of the soul for me.Im so alone.I want my Mom.I remember her parting words at the airport, Follow your heart, darling, and please, please  try not to over think things.Relax and enjoy.You are so young, sweetheart, you have so much to experience, just let it happen.You deserve the best of everything.I did follow my heart, and I have a sore ass and an anguished, broken spirit to show for it.I have to go.Thats it I have to leave.Hes no good for me, and I am no good for him.How can we possibly make this work?And the thought of not seeing him again practically chokes me my Fifty Shades.I hear the door click open.Oh no  hes here.He puts something down on the bedside table, and the bed shifts under his weight as he climbs in behind me.Hush, he breathes, and I want to pull away from him, move to the other side of the bed, but Im paralyzed.I cannot move and lie stiffly, not yielding at all.Dont fight me, Ana, please, he whispers.Gently, he pulls me into his arms, burying his nose in my hair, kissing my neck.Dont hate me, he breathes softly against my skin, his voice achingly sad.My heart clenches anew and releases a fresh wave of silent sobbing.He continues to kiss me softly, tenderly, but I remain aloof and wary.We lie together like this, neither saying anything for ages.He just holds me, and very gradually, I relax and stop crying.Dawn comes and goes, and the soft light gets brighter as morning moves on, and still we lie quietly.I bought you some Advil and some arnica cream, he says after a long while.I turn very slowly in his arms so I can face him.I am resting my head on his arm.His eyes are flinty gray and guarded.I gaze at his beautiful face.Hes giving nothing away, but he keeps his eyes on mine, hardly blinking.Oh, he is so breathtakingly good looking.In such a short time, hes become so, so dear to me.Reaching up, I caress his cheek and run the tips of my fingers through his stubble.He closes his eyes and exhales slightly.Im sorry, I whisper.He opens his eyes and looks at me puzzled.What for?What I said.You didnt tell me anything I didnt know.And his eyes soften with relief.I am sorry I hurt you.I shrug.I asked for it.And now I know.I swallow.Here goes.I need to say my piece.I dont think I can be everything you want me to be, I whisper.His eyes widen slightly, and he blinks, his fearful expression returning.You are everything I want you to be.What?I dont understand.Im not obedient, and you can be as sure as hell Im not going to let you do that to me again.And thats what you need, you said so.He closes his eyes again, and I can see a myriad of emotions cross his face.When he reopens them, his expression is bleak.Oh no.Youre right.I should let you go.I am no good for you.My scalp prickles as every single hair follicle on my body stands to attention, and the world falls away from me, leaving a wide, yawning abyss for me to fall into.Oh no.I dont want to go, I whisper.Fuck  this is it.Pay or play.Tears swim in my eyes once more.I dont want you to go either, he whispers, his voice raw.He reaches up and gently strokes my cheek and wipes away a falling tear with his thumb.Ive come alive since I met you.His thumb traces the contours of my lower lip.Me too, I whisper, Ive fallen in love with you, Christian.His eyes widen again, but this time, with pure, undiluted fear.No, he breathes as if Ive knocked the wind out of him.Oh no.You cant love me, Ana.No thats wrong.Hes horrified.Wrong?Whys it wrong?Well, look at you.I cant make you happy.His voice is anguished.But you do make me happy.I frown.Not at the moment, not doing what I want to do.Holy fuck.This really is it.This is what it boils down to  incompatibility   and all those poor subs come to mind.Well never get past that, will we?I whisper, my scalp prickling in fear.He shakes his head bleakly.I close my eyes.I cannot bear to look at him.Well Id better go, then, I murmur, wincing as I sit up.No, dont go.He sounds panicked.Theres no point in me staying.Suddenly, I feel tired, really dog tired, and I want to go now.I climb out of bed, and Christian follows.Im going to get dressed.Id like some privacy, I say, my voice flat and empty as I leave him standing in the bedroom.Heading downstairs, I glance at the great room, thinking how only hours before I had rested my head on his shoulder as he played the piano.So much has happened since then.I have had my eyes opened and glimpsed the extent of his depravity, and I now know hes not capable of love  of giving or receiving love.My worst fears have been realized.And strangely, its very liberating.The pain is such that I refuse to acknowledge it.I feel numb.I have somehow escaped from my body and am now a casual observer to this unfolding tragedy.I shower quickly and methodically, thinking only of each second in front of me.Now squeeze body wash bottle.Put body wash bottle back in rack.Rub cloth on face, on shoulders on and on, all simple, mechanical actions, requiring simple mechanical thoughts.I finish my shower  and as I havent washed my hair, I can dry myself quickly.I dress in the bathroom, taking my jeans and t shirt out of my small suitcase.My jeans chafe against my backside, but quite frankly, its a pain I welcome as it distracts my mind from whats happening to my splintering, shattered heart.I stoop to shut my suitcase, and the bag holding Christians gift catches my eye, a modeling kit for a Blahnik L23 glider, something for him to build.Tears threaten.Oh no  happier times, when there was hope of more.I take it out of the case, knowing that I need      to give it to him.Quickly, I rip a small piece of paper from my notebook, hastily scribble a note for him, and leave it on top of the box.I gaze at myself in the mirror.A pale and haunted ghost stares back at me.I scoop my hair into a ponytail and ignore how swollen my eyelids are from the crying.My subconscious nods with approval.Even she knows not to be snarky right now.I cannot believe that my world is crumbling around me into a sterile pile of ashes, all my hopes and dreams cruelly dashed.No, no dont think about it.Not now, not yet.Taking a deep breath, I pick up my case, and after placing the glider kit and my note on his pillow, I head for the great room.Christian is on the phone.Hes dressed in black jeans and t shirt.His feet are bare.He said what!he shouts, making me jump.Well, he could have told us the fucking truth.Whats his number, I need to call him Welch, this is a real fuck up.He glances up and doesnt take his dark and brooding eyes off me.Find her, he snaps and presses the off switch.I walk over to the couch and collect my backpack, doing my best to ignore him.I take the Mac out of it and walk back toward the kitchen, placing it carefully on the breakfast bar, along with the BlackBerry and the car key.When I turn to face him, hes staring at me, stupefied with horror.I need the money that Taylor got for my Beetle.My voice is clear and calm, devoid of emotion extraordinary.Ana, I dont want those things, theyre yours, he says in disbelief.Please, take them.No Christian  I only accepted them under sufferance  and I dont want them anymore.Ana, be reasonable, he scolds me, even now.I dont want anything that will remind me of you.I just need the money that Taylor got for my car.My voice is quite monotone.He gasps.Are you really trying to wound me?No.I frown staring at him.Of course not I love you.Im not.Im trying to protect myself, I whisper.Because you dont want me the way I want you.Please, Ana, take that stuff.Christian, I dont want to fight  I just need the money.He narrows his eyes, but Im no longer intimidated by him.Well, only a little.I gaze impassively back, not blinking or backing down.Will you take a check?he says acidly.Yes.I think youre good for it.He doesnt smile, he just turns on his heel and stalks into his study.I take a last lingering look around his apartment  at the art on the walls  all abstracts, serene, cool cold, even.Fitting, I think absently.My eyes stray to the piano.Jeez  if Id kept my mouth shut, wed have made love on the piano.No, fucked, we would have fucked on the piano.Well, I would have made love.The thought lies heavy and sad in my mind.He has never made love to me, has he?Its always been fucking to him.Christian returns and hands me an envelope.Taylor got a good price.Its a classic car.You can ask him.Hell take you home.He nods in the direction over my shoulder.I turn, and Taylor is standing in the doorway, wearing his suit, as impeccable as ever.Thats fine, I can get myself home, thank you.I turn to stare at Christian, and I see the barely contained fury in his eyes.Are you going to defy me at every turn?Why change a habit of a lifetime?I give him a small, apologetic shrug.He closes his eyes in frustration and runs his hand through his hair.Please, Ana, let Taylor take you home.Ill get the car, Miss Steele, Taylor announces authoritatively.Christian nods at him, and when I glance around, Taylor has gone.I turn back to face Christian.We are four feet apart.He steps forward, and instinctively I step back.He stops, and the anguish in his expression is palpable, his gray eyes burning.I dont want you to go, he murmurs, his voice full of longing.I cant stay.I know what I want and you cant give it to me, and I cant give you what you need.He takes another step forward, and I hold up my hands.Dont, please.I recoil from him.Theres no way I can tolerate his touch now, it will slay me.I cant do this.Grabbing my suitcase and my backpack, I head for the foyer.He follows me, keeping a careful distance.He presses the elevator button, and the doors open.I climb in.Goodbye, Christian, I murmur.Ana, goodbye, he says softly, and he looks utterly, utterly broken, a man in agonizing pain, reflecting how I feel inside.I tear my gaze away from him before I change my mind and try to comfort him.The elevator doors close, and it whisks me down to the bowels of the basement and to my own personal hell.Taylor holds the door open for me, and I climb into the back of the car.I avoid eye contact.Embarrassment and shame washes over me.Im a complete failure.I had hoped to drag my Fifty Shades into the light, but its proved a task beyond my meager abilities.Desperately, I try to keep my emotions banked and at bay.As we head out onto 4th Avenue, I stare blankly out of the window, and the enormity of what Ive done slowly washes over me.Shit  Ive left him.The only man Ive ever loved.The only man Ive ever slept with.I gasp, and the levees burst.Tears course unbidden and unwelcome down my cheeks, and I wipe them away hurriedly with my fingers, scrambling in my bag for my sunglasses.As we pause at some traffic lights, Taylor holds out a linen handkerchief for me.He says nothing and doesnt look in my direction, and I take it with gratitude.Thank you, I mutter, and this small discreet act of kindness is my undoing.I sit back in the luxurious leather seats and weep.The apartment is achingly empty and unfamiliar.I have not lived here long enough for it to feel like home.I head straight to my room, and there, hanging limply at the end of my bed, is a very sad, deflated helicopter balloon.Charlie Tango, looking and feeling exactly like me.I grab it angrily off my bedrail, snapping the tie, and hug it to me.Oh  what have I done?I fall onto my bed, shoes and all, and howl.The pain is indescribable physical, mental metaphysical it is everywhere, seeping into the marrow of my bones.Grief.This is grief  and Ive brought it on myself.Deep down, a nasty, unbidden thought comes from my inner goddess, her lip curled in a snarl the physical pain from the bite of a belt is nothing, nothing compared to this devastation.I curl up, desperately clutching the flat foil balloon and Taylors handkerchief, and surrender myself to my grief.End of Part One
