Sunday?The doctor will be at Escala to see you at 1:30.Im leaving for Seattle now.I hope your move goes well, and I look forward to Sunday.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.Right.All done.I ease the R8 onto the road and roar toward I 5.As I pass the exit for Vancouver Im inspired.I call Andrea on the hands free and ask her to organize a housewarming present for Ana and Kate.What would you like to send?Bollinger La Grande Anne Ros, 1999 vintage.Yes, sir.Anything else?What do you mean, anything else?Flowers?Chocolates?A balloon?Balloon?Yes.What sort of balloons?Wellthey have everything.Okay.Good ideasee if you can get a helicopter balloon.Yes, sir.And a message for the card?Ladies, good luck in your new home.Christian Grey.Got that?I have.Whats the address?Shit.I dont know.Ill text it to you either later today or tomorrow.Will that work?Yes, sir.I can get it delivered tomorrow.Thanks, Andrea.Youre welcome.She sounds surprised.I hang up and floor my R8.BY 6:30 IM HOME and my earlier ebullient mood has souredI still havent heard from Ana.I select a pair of cuff links from the drawers in my closet and as I knot my bow tie for the nights event I wonder if shes okay.She said she would contact me when she got home; Ive called her twice, but Ive heard nothing, and its pissing me off.I try her once more and this time I leave a message.I think you need to learn to manage my expectations.Im not a patient man.If you say you are going to contact me when you finish work, then you should have the decency to do so.Otherwise I worry, and its not an emotion Im familiar with, and I dont tolerate it very well.Call me.If she doesnt call soon I am going to explode.IM SEATED AT A table with Whelan, my banker.Im his guest at a charity function for a nonprofit that aims to raise awareness of global poverty.Glad you could make it, Whelan says.Its a good cause.And thank you for your generous contribution, Mr.Grey.His wife is cloying, thrusting her perfect, surgically enhanced breasts in my direction.Like I said, its a good cause.I give her a patronizing smile.Why hasnt Ana called me back?I check my phone again.Nothing.I look around the table at all the middle aged men with their second or third trophy wives.God forbid this should ever be me.Im bored.Seriously bored and seriously pissed.What is she doing?Could I have brought her here?I suspect she would have been bored stiff, too.When the conversation around the table moves to the state of the economy, Ive had enough.Making my excuses, I leave the ballroom and exit the hotel.While the valet is retrieving my car, I call Ana again.Theres still no answer.Perhaps now that Im gone she wants nothing to do with me.When I get home, I head straight to my study and switch on the iMac.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Where Are You?Date: May 27 2011 22:14  To: Anastasia Steele  I am at work.I will e mail you when I get home.Are you still at work or have you packed your phone, BlackBerry, and MacBook?Call me, or I may be forced to call Elliot.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.I stare out of my window toward the dark waters of the Sound.Why did I volunteer to collect Mia?I could be with Ana, helping her pack all her shit, then going out for pizza with her and Kate and Elliotor whatever ordinary people do.For Gods sake, Grey.Thats not you.Get a grip.I wander around my apartment, my footsteps echoing through the living room, and it seems achingly empty since I was last here.I undo my bow tie.Perhaps its me thats empty.I pour myself an Armagnac and stare back out at the Seattle skyline toward the Sound.Are you thinking about me, Anastasia Steele?The winking lights of Seattle have no answer.My phone buzzes.Thank.Fuck.Finally.Its her.Hi.Im relieved that shes called.Hi, she says.I was worried about you.I know.Im sorry I didnt reply, but Im fine.Fine?I wish I was  Did you have a pleasant evening?I ask, reining in my temper.Yes.We finished packing, and Kate and I had Chinese takeout with Jos.Oh, this just gets better and better.The fucking photographer again.Thats why she hasnt called.How about you?she inquires when I dont respond, and theres a hint of desperation in her voice.Why?What isnt she telling me?Oh, stop overthinking this, Grey!I sigh.I went to a fund raising dinner.It was deathly dull.I left as soon as I could.I wish you were here, she whispers.Do you?Yes, she says fervently.Oh.Perhaps shes missed me.Ill see you Sunday?I confirm, trying to keep the hope out of my voice.Yes, Sunday, she says, and I think shes smiling.Good night.Good night, Sir.Her voice is husky and it takes my breath away.Good luck with your move tomorrow, Anastasia.She stays on the line, her breathing soft.Why doesnt she hang up?She doesnt want to?You hang up, she whispers.She doesnt want to hang up and my mood lightens immediately.I grin out at the view of Seattle.No, you hang up.I dont want to.Neither do I.   Were you very angry with me?she asks.Yes.Are you still?No.Now I know youre safe.So youre not going to punish me?No.Im an in the moment kind of guy.Ive noticed, she teases, and that makes me smile.You can hang up now, Miss Steele.Do you really want me to, Sir?Go to bed, Anastasia.Yes, Sir.She doesnt hang up, and I know shes grinning.It lifts my spirits higher.Do you ever think youll be able to do what youre told?I ask.Maybe.Well see after Sunday, she says, temptress that she is, and the line goes dead.Anastasia Steele, what am I going to do with you?Actually, I have a good idea, provided that riding crop turns up in time.And with that enticing thought I toss down the rest of the Armagnac and go to bed.SATURDAY, MAY 28, 2011    * * *      Christian!Mia squeals with delight and runs toward me, abandoning her cartload of luggage.Throwing her arms around my neck, she hugs me tightly.Ive missed you, she says.Ive missed you, too.I give her a squeeze in return.She leans back and examines me with intense dark eyes.You look good, she gushes.Tell me about this girl!Lets get you and your luggage home first.I grab her cart, which weighs a ton, and together we head out of the airport terminal toward the parking lot.So how was Paris?You appear to have brought most of it home with you.Cest incroyable!she exclaims.Floubert, on the other hand, was a bastard.Jesus.He was a horrible man.A crap teacher but a good chef.Does that mean youre cooking this evening?Oh, I was hoping Mom would cook.Mia proceeds to talk nonstop about Paris: her tiny room, the plumbing, Sacr Coeur, Montmartre, Parisians, coffee, red wine, cheese, fashion, shopping.But mainly about fashion and shopping.And I thought she went to Paris to learn to cook.Ive missed her chatter; its soothing and welcome.She is the only person I know who doesnt make me feeldifferent.This is your baby sister, Christian.Her name is Mia.Mommy lets me hold her.She is very small.With black, black hair.She smiles.She has no teeth.I stick out my tongue.She has a bubbly laugh.Mommy lets me hold the baby again.Her name is Mia.I make her laugh.I hold her and hold her.She is safe when I hold her.Elliot is not interested in Mia.She dribbles and cries.And he wrinkles his nose when she does a poop.When Mia is crying Elliot ignores her.I hold her and hold her and she stops.She falls asleep in my arms.Mee a, I whisper.What did you say?Mommy asks, and her face is white like chalk.Mee a.   Yes.Yes.Darling boy.Mia.Her name is Mia.And Mommy starts to cry with happy, happy tears.I TURN INTO THE driveway, pull up outside Mom and Dads front door, unload Mias luggage, and carry it into the hall.Where is everyone?Mia is in full pout.The only person around is my parents housekeepershes an exchange student, and I cant remember her name.Welcome home, she says to Mia in her stilted English, though shes looking at me with big cow eyes.Oh, God.Its just a pretty face, sweetheart.Ignoring the housekeeper, I address Mias question.I think Mom is on call and Dad is at a conference.You did come home a week early.I couldnt stand Floubert another minute.I had to get out while I could.Oh, I bought you a present.She grabs one of her cases, opens it up in the hallway, and starts rummaging through it.Ah!She hands me a heavy square box.Open it, she urges, beaming at me.She is an unstoppable force.Warily I open the box, and inside I find a snow globe containing a black grand piano covered in glitter.Its the kitschiest thing Ive ever seen.Its a music box.Here She takes it from me, gives it a good shake, and winds a small key on the bottom.A twinkly version of La Marseillaise starts to play in a cloud of colored glitter.What am I going to do with this?I laugh, because its so Mia.Thats great, Mia.Thank you.I give her a hug and she hugs me back.I knew it would make you laugh.Shes right.She knows me well.So tell me about this girl, she says.But were both distracted as Grace hurries through the door, allowing me a reprieve as mother and daughter embrace.Im so sorry I wasnt there to meet you, darling, Grace says.Ive been on call.You look so grown up.Christian, can you take Mias bags upstairs?Gretchen will give you a hand.Really?Im a porter now?Yes, Mom.I roll my eyes.I dont need Gretchen mooning over me.Once thats done, I tell them that I have an appointment with my trainer.Ill be back this evening.Quickly kissing them both, I leave before Im pestered with more questions about Ana.BASTILLE, MY TRAINER, WORKS me hard.Today were kickboxing at his gym.Youve gone soft in Portland, boy.He sneers after Im toppled onto the mat from his roundhouse kick.Bastille is from the hard knocks school of physical training, which suits me fine.I scramble to my feet.I want to take him down.But hes righthes all over my shit today, and I get nowhere.When we finish he asks, What gives?Youre distracted, man.Life.You know, I answer with an air of indifference.Sure.Youre back in Seattle this week?Yeah.Good.Well straighten you out.AS I JOG BACK to the apartment I remember the housewarming present for Ana.I text Elliot.Whats Ana and Kates address?I want to surprise them with a present.He texts me back an address and I forward it to Andrea.As Im riding in the elevator up to the penthouse, Andrea texts me back.Champagne and balloon sent.A.   Taylor hands me a package when I arrive back at the apartment.This came for you, Mr.Grey.Oh yes.I recognize the anonymous wrapping: its the riding crop.Thanks.Mrs.Jones said shed be back tomorrow, late afternoon.Okay.I think thats all for today, Taylor.Very good, sir, he says with a polite smile, and returns to his office.Taking the crop, I stroll into my bedroom.This will be the perfect introduction to my world: by her own admission Ana has no sphere of reference with regard to corporal punishment, except the spanking I gave her that night.And that turned her on.With the crop, Ill have to take it slow and make it pleasurable.Really pleasurable.The riding crop is perfect.Ill prove to her that the fear is in her head.Once she gets comfortable with this, we can move on.I hope we can move on   Well take it slow.And well only do what she can handle.If this is going to work were going to have to go at her pace.Not mine.I take one more look at the crop and put it in my closet for tomorrow.AS I FLIP OPEN my laptop to start work my phone rings.I hope its Ana, but its disappointingly Elena.Was I supposed to call her?Hello, Christian.How are you?Good, thanks.Youre back from Portland?Yes.Fancy dinner tonight?Not tonight.Mias just in from Paris and Ive been ordered home.Ah.By Mama Grey.How is she?Mama Grey?Shes good.I think.Why?What do you know that I dont?I was just asking, Christian.Dont be so touchy.Ill call you next week.Maybe we can do dinner then.Good.Youve been off the radar for a while.And Ive met a woman who I think might meet your needs.So have I.   I ignore her comment.Ill see you next week.Good bye.As I shower I wonder if having to chase Ana has made her more interestingor is it Ana herself?DINNER HAS BEEN FUN.My sister is back, the princess shes always been, the rest of the family merely her minions, wrapped around her little finger.With all her children home, Grace is in her element; shes cooked Mias favorite mealbuttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy.I have to say, its one of my favorites, too.Tell me about Anastasia, Mia demands as we sit around the kitchen table.Elliot leans back in his chair and rests his hands behind his head.This I have to hear.You know she popped his cherry?Elliot!Grace scolds, and swats him with a dish towel.Ow!He fends her off.I roll my eyes at all of them.I met a girl.I shrug.End of story.You cant just say that!Mia objects, pouting.Mia, I think he can.And he just did.Carrick gives her a reproving paternal stare over his glasses.Youll all meet her at dinner tomorrow, wont we, Christian?Grace says with a pointed smile.Oh, fuck.Kates coming, Elliot goads.Fucking stirrer.I glare at him.I cant wait to meet her.She sounds awesome!Mia bounces up and down in her chair.Yeah, yeah, I mumble, wondering if theres any way I can wriggle out of dinner tomorrow.Elena was asking after you, darling, Grace says.She was?I affect an uninterested air, developed over years of practice.Yes.She says she hasnt seen you in a while.Ive been in Portland on business.Speaking of which, I should get goingI have an important call tomorrow and I need to prepare.But youve not had dessert.And its apple cobbler.Hmmtempting.But if I stay theyll quiz me about Ana.I have to go.I have work to do.Darling, you work too hard, Grace says, as she starts from her chair.Dont get up, Mom.Im sure Elliot will help with the dishes after dinner.What?Elliot scowls.I wink at him, say my good byes, and turn to leave.But well see you tomorrow?Grace asks, too much hope in her voice.Well see.Shit.It looks like Anastasia Steele is going to meet my family.I dont know how I feel about this.SUNDAY, MAY 29, 2011    * * *      With the Rolling Stones Shake Your Hips blasting in my ears, I sprint down Fourth Avenue and turn right on Vine.Its 6:45 in the morning, and its downhill all the wayto her apartment.Im drawn; I just want to see where she lives.Its between control freak and stalker.I chuckle to myself.Im just running.Its a free country.The apartment block is a nondescript redbrick, with dark green painted window frames typical of the area.Its in a good location near the intersection of Vine Street and Western.I imagine Ana curled up in her bed under her comforter and her cream and blue quilt.I run several blocks and turn down into the market; the vendors are setting up for business.I dodge between the fruit and vegetable trucks and the refrigerated vans delivering the catch of the day.This is the heart of the cityvibrant, even this early on a gray, cool morning.The water on the Sound is a glassy leaden color, matching the sky.But it does nothing to dampen my spirits.Todays the day.AFTER MY SHOWER I don jeans and a linen shirt, and from my chest of drawers I take out a hair tie.I slip it into my pocket and head into my study to e mail Ana.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: My Life in Numbers  Date: May 29 2011 08:04  To: Anastasia Steele  If you drive youll need this access code for the underground garage at Escala: 146963.Park in bay fiveits one of mine.Code for the elevator: 1880.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.A moment or two later, theres a response.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: An Excellent Vintage  Date: May 29 2011 08:08  To: Christian Grey  Yes, Sir.Understood.Thank you for the champagne and the blow up Charlie Tango, which is now tied to my bed.Ana  An image of Ana tethered to her bed with my tie comes to mind.I shift in my chair.I hope shes brought that bed to Seattle.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Envy  Date: May 29 2011 08:11  To: Anastasia Steele  Youre welcome.Dont be late.Lucky Charlie Tango.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.She doesnt respond, so I hunt through the refrigerator for some breakfast.Gail has left me some croissants and, for lunch, a Caesar salad with chicken, enough for two.I hope Ana will eat this; I dont mind having it two days in a row.Taylor appears while Im eating my breakfast.Good morning, Mr.Grey.Here are the Sunday papers.Thanks.Anastasia is coming over at one today, and a Dr.Greene at one thirty.Very good, sir.Anything else on the agenda today?Yes.Ana and I will be going to my parents for dinner this evening.Taylor cocks his head, looking momentarily surprised, but he remembers himself and leaves the room.I return to my croissant and apricot jam.Yeah.Im taking her to meet my parents.Whats the big deal?I CANT SETTLE.IM restless.Its 12:15 p. m.  Time is crawling today.I give up on work and, grabbing the Sunday papers, wander back into the living room, where I switch on some music and read.To my surprise theres a photograph of Ana and me on the local news page, taken at the graduation ceremony at WSU.She looks lovely, if a little startled.I hear the double doors open, and there she isHer hair is loose, a little wild and sexy, and shes wearing that purple dress she wore to dinner at The Heathman.She looks gorgeous.Bravo, Miss Steele.Hmm, that dress.My voice is full of admiration as I saunter toward her.Welcome back, Miss Steele, I whisper, and, holding her chin, I give her a tender kiss on the lips.Hi, she says, her cheeks a little rosy.Youre on time.I like punctual.Come.Taking her hand, I lead her to the sofa.I wanted to show you something.We both sit, and I pass her The Seattle Times.The photograph makes her laugh.Not quite the reaction I was expecting.So Im your friend now, she teases.So it would appear.And its in the newspaper, so it must be true.Im calmer now that shes hereprobably because shes here.She hasnt run.I tuck her soft, silky hair behind her ear; my fingers are itching to braid it.So, Anastasia, you have a much better idea of what Im about since you were last here.Yes.Her gaze is intenseknowing.And yet youve returned.She nods, giving me a coy smile.I cant believe my luck.I knew you were a freak, Ana.Have you eaten?No.Not at all?Okay.Well have to fix this.I drag my hand through my hair, and in as even a tone as I can manage I ask, Are you hungry?Not for food, she teases.Whoa.She might as well be addressing my groin.Leaning forward, I press my lips to her ear and catch her intoxicating scent.You are as eager as ever, Miss Steeleand just to let you in on a little secret, so am I.  But Dr.Greene is due here shortly.I lean against the sofa.I wish youd eat.Its a plea.What can you tell me about Dr.Greene?She deftly changes the subject.Shes the best ob gyn in Seattle.What more can I say?Thats what my doctor told my PA, anyway.I thought I was seeing your doctor?And dont tell me youre really a woman, because I wont believe you.I suppress my snort.I think its more appropriate that you see a specialist.Dont you?She gives me a quizzical look, but she nods.One more topic to tackle.Anastasia, my mother would like you to come to dinner this evening.I believe Elliot is asking Kate, too.I dont know how you feel about that.It will be odd for me to introduce you to my family.She takes a second to process the information, then tosses her hair over her shoulder in that way she does before a fight.But she looks hurt, not argumentative.Are you ashamed of me?She sounds choked.Oh, for heavens sake.Of course not.Of all the ridiculous things to say!I glare at her, aggrieved.How could she think that about herself?Why is it odd?she asks.Because Ive never done it before.I sound irritable.Why are you allowed to roll your eyes, and Im not?I wasnt aware that I was.Shes calling me out.Again.Neither am I, usually, she snaps.Shit.Are we arguing?Taylor clears his throat.Dr.Greene is here, sir, he says.Show her up to Miss Steeles room.Ana turns and looks at me and I hold out my hand to her.Youre not going to come as well, are you?Shes horrified and amused at once.I laugh, and my body stirs.Id pay very good money to watch, believe me, Anastasia, but I dont think the good doctor would approve.She places her hand in mine, and I pull her up into my arms and kiss her.Her mouth is soft and warm and inviting; my hands glide into her hair and I deepen the kiss.When I pull away, she looks dazed.I press my forehead to hers.Im so glad youre here.I cant wait to get you naked.I cant believe how much I missed you.Come on.I want to meet Dr.Greene, too.You dont know her?No.I take Anas hand and we head upstairs, to what will be her bedroom.Dr.Greene has one of those myopic stares; its penetrating and that makes me a tad uncomfortable.Mr.Grey, she says, shaking my outstretched hand with a firm, no nonsense grip.Thank you for coming on such short notice.I flash her my most benign smile.Thank you for making it worth my while, Mr.Grey.Miss Steele, she says politely to Ana, and I know shes sizing up our relationship.Im sure that she thinks I should be twiddling a mustache like a silent movie villain.She turns and gives me a pointed leave now kind of look.Okay.Ill be downstairs, I acquiesce.Though I would like to watch.Im sure the good doctors reaction would be priceless if I made that request.I smirk at the thought and head downstairs to the living room.Now that Anas no longer with me, Im restless again.As a distraction I set the counter with two placemats.Its the second time Ive done this, and the first time was for Ana, too.Youre going soft, Grey.I select a Chablis to have with lunchone of the few chardonnays I likeand when Im done I take a seat on the sofa and browse through the sports section of the paper.Turning up the volume via the remote for my iPod, I hope the music will help me focus on stats from last nights Mariners win against the Yankees, rather than whats happening upstairs between Ana and Dr.Greene.Eventually their footsteps echo in the corridor, and I look up as they enter.Are you done?I ask, and hit the remote for the iPod, to quiet the aria.Yes, Mr.Grey.Look after her; shes a beautiful, bright young woman.What has Ana told her?I fully intend to, I say, with a quick what the fuck glance at Ana.She bats her lashes, clueless.Good.Its nothing shes said, then.Ill send you my bill, says Dr.Greene.Good day, and good luck to you, Ana.The edges of her eyes crinkle with a warm smile as we shake hands.Taylor escorts her toward the elevator and wisely closes the double doors to the foyer.How was that?I ask, a little bemused by Dr.Greenes words.Fine, thank you, Ana answers.She said that I had to abstain from all sexual activity for the next four weeks.What the hell?I gape at her in shock.Anas earnest expression dissolves into one of taunting triumph.Gotcha!Well played, Miss Steele.My eyes narrow and her grin vanishes.Gotcha!I cant help my smirk.Reaching around her waist, I pull her against me, my body hungering for her.You are incorrigible, Miss Steele.I weave my hands through her hair and kiss her hard, wondering if I should fuck her over the kitchen counter as a lesson.All in good time, Grey.As much as Id like to take you here and now, you need to eat and so do I.  I dont want you passing out on me later, I whisper.Is that all you want me formy body?she asks.That and your smart mouth.I kiss her once more, thinking of whats to comeMy kiss deepens and desire hardens my body.I want this woman.Before I fuck her on the floor, I release her, and were both breathless.Whats the music?she says, her voice hoarse.Villa Lobos, an aria from Bachianas Brasileiras.Good, isnt it?Yes, she says, gazing at the breakfast bar.I take the chicken Caesar out of the fridge, place it on the table between the placemats, and ask her if shes okay with salad.Yes, fine, thank you.She smiles.From the wine fridge I take out the Chablis, feeling her eyes on me.I didnt know I could be so domestic.What are you thinking?I ask.I was just watching the way you move.And?I ask, momentarily surprised.Youre very graceful, she says quietly, her cheeks pink.Why, thank you, Miss Steele.I sit beside her, unsure how to respond to her sweet compliment.Nobodys called me graceful before.Chablis?Please.Help yourself to salad.Tell mewhat method did you opt for?Mini pill, she says.And will you remember to take it regularly, at the right time, every day?A blush steals across her surprised face.Im sure youll remind me, she says with a hint of sarcasm, which I choose to ignore.You should have had the shot.Ill put an alarm on my calendar.Eat.She takes a bite, then anotherand another.Shes eating!So I can put chicken Caesar on the list for Mrs.Jones?I ask.I thought Id be doing the cooking.Yes.You will.She finishes before I do.She must have been starving.Eager as ever, Miss Steele?Yes, she says, giving me a demure look from beneath her lashes.Fuck.There it is.The attraction.As if under her spell, I get up and tug her into my arms.Do you want to do this?I whisper, inwardly begging her to say yes.I havent signed anything.I knowbut Im breaking all the rules these days.Are you going to hit me?Yes, but it wont be to hurt you.I dont want to punish you right now.If youd caught me yesterday evening, well, that would have been a different story.Her face turns to shock.Oh, baby.Dont let anyone try to convince you otherwise, Anastasia.One of the reasons people like me to do this is because we either like to give or receive pain.Its very simple.You dont, so I spent a great deal of time yesterday thinking about that.I wrap my arms around her, holding her against my hardening erection.Did you reach any conclusions?she whispers.No, and right now, I just want to tie you up and fuck you senseless.Are you ready for that?Her expression is darker, sensual, and full of carnal curiosity.Yes, she says, the word as soft as a sigh.Thank fuck.Good.Come.I lead her upstairs and into my playroom.My safe place.Where I can do what I wish with her.I close my eyes, briefly savoring the exhilaration.Have I ever been this excited?Pushing the door shut behind us, I release her hand and study her.Her lips are parted as she inhales; her breathing is quick and shallow.Her eyes are wide.Ready.Waiting.When youre in here, you are completely mine.To do with as I see fit.Do you understand?Her tongue quickly licks her upper lip, and she nods.Good girl.Take your shoes off.She swallows and proceeds to take off her high heeled sandals.I pick them up and put them neatly by the door.Good.Dont hesitate when I ask you to do something.Now Im going to peel you out of this dress.Something Ive wanted to do for a few days, if I recall.I pause, checking that shes still with me.I want you to be comfortable with your body, Anastasia.You have a beautiful body, and I like to look at it.It is a joy to behold.In fact, I could gaze at you all day, and I want you unembarrassed and unashamed of your nakedness.Do you understand?Yes.Yes, what?My tone is sharper.Yes, Sir.Do you mean that?I want you unashamed, Ana.Yes, Sir.Good.Lift your arms up over your head.Slowly she raises her arms in the air.I grab the hem and gently pull the dress up her body, revealing it inch by inch, for my eyes only.When its off I stand back so I can have my fill of her.Legs, thighs, belly, ass, tits, shoulders, face, mouthshes perfect.Folding her dress, I place it on the toy chest.Reaching up, I tug her chin.Youre biting your lip.You know what that does to me, I scold.Turn around.She complies and turns to face the door.I unfasten her bra and pull the straps down her arms, skimming her skin with my fingertips as I do and feeling her tremble beneath my touch.I take off her bra and toss it on top of her dress.I stand close, not quite touching her, listening to her rapid breathing and sensing the warmth radiating off her skin.Shes excited and shes not the only one.I gather her hair in both of my hands so it falls down her back.Its oh so silky to touch.I wind it around one hand and tug, angling her head to one side and exposing her neck to my mouth.I run my nose from her ear to her shoulder and back again, inhaling her heavenly scent.Fuck, she smells good.You smell as divine as ever, Anastasia.I place a kiss beneath her ear just above her pulse.She moans.Quiet.Dont make a sound.From my jeans pocket I grab the hair tie, and taking her hair in my hands, I braid it, slowly, enjoying the pull and twist against her beautiful, flawless back.Deftly I fasten the end with the hair tie and give it a quick tug, forcing her to step back and press her body into mine.I like your hair braided in here, I whisper.Turn around.She does so, immediately.When I tell you to come in here, this is how you will dress.Just in your panties.Do you understand?Yes.Yes, what?Yes, Sir.Good girl.Shes learning fast.Her arms are by her sides, her eyes trained on mine.Waiting.When I tell you to come in here, I expect you to kneel over there.I point to the corner of the room beside the door.Do it now.She blinks a couple of times, but before I have to tell her again, she turns and kneels, facing me and the room.I give her permission to sit back on her heels and she obliges.Place your hands and forearms flat on your thighs.Good.Now part your knees.Wider.I want to see you, baby.Wider.See your sex.Perfect.Look down at the floor.Dont look at me or the room.You can sit there and let your thoughts run wild while you imagine what Im going to do to you.I walk over to her, and Im pleased that she keeps her head bowed.Reaching down, I tug her braid, tilting her head so that our eyes meet.Will you remember this position, Anastasia?Yes, Sir.Good.Stay here, dont move.Walking past her, I open the door and for a moment look back at her.Her head is bowed; her eyes stay fixed on the floor.What a welcome sight.Good girl.I want to run, but I contain my eagerness and walk purposefully downstairs to my bedroom.Maintain some fucking dignity, Grey.In my closet I strip off all my clothes and from a drawer pull out my favorite jeans.My DJs.Dom jeans.I slip them on and fasten all the buttons except the top one.From the same drawer I retrieve the new riding crop and a gray waffle robe.As I leave I grab a few condoms and stuff them into my pocket.Here goes.Showtime, Grey.When I get back shes in the same position: her head bowed, her braid hanging down her back, her hands on her knees.I close the door and hang the robe on its hook.I walk past her.Good girl, Anastasia.You look lovely like that.Well done.Stand up.She stands, keeping her head down.You may look at me.Eager blue eyes peek up.Im going to chain you now, Anastasia.Give me your right hand.I hold out mine and she places her hand in it.Without taking my eyes off hers I turn her hand palm up, and from behind my back produce the riding crop.I quickly flick the end across her palm.She startles and cups her hand, blinking at me in surprise.How does that feel?I ask.Her breathing accelerates, and she glances at me before looking back at her palm.Answer me.Okay.Her brows knit together.Dont frown, I warn.Did that hurt?No.This is not going to hurt.Do you understand?Yes.Her voice is a little shaky.I mean it, I stress, and I show her the crop.Brown plaited leather.See?I listen.Her eyes meet mine, astonished.My lips twitch in amusement.We aim to please, Miss Steele.Come.I lead her to the middle of the room, beneath the restraining system.This grid is designed so the shackles move across the grid.She stares up at the intricate system, then back at me.Were going to start here, but I want to fuck you standing up.So well end up by the wall over there.I point to the Saint Andrews cross.Put your hands above your head.She does, immediately.Taking the leather cuffs that hang on the grid, I fasten one to each of her wrists in turn.Im methodical, but shes distracting.Being this close to her, sensing her excitement, her anxiety, touching her.I find it hard to concentrate.Once shes cuffed I step back and take a deep breath, relieved.Finally Ive got you where I want you, Ana Steele.Slowly I walk around her, admiring the view.Could she look hotter?You look mighty fine trussed up like this, Miss Steele.And your smart mouth quiet for now.I like that.I stop, facing her, curl my fingers into her panties, and oh so slowly drag them down her long legs until Im kneeling at her feet.Worshipping her.Shes glorious.With my eyes locked on hers, I take her panties, crush them to my nose, and inhale deeply.Her mouth pops open and her eyes widen in amused shock.Yes.I smirk.Perfect reaction.I slip the panties into the back pocket of my jeans and stand, considering my next move.Holding out the crop, I run it over her belly and gently circle her navel with the keeperthe leather tongue.She sucks in her breath and tremors at the touch.This will be good, Ana.Trust me.Slowly I begin to circle her, drawing the crop across her skin, across her belly, her flank, her back.On my second circuit I flick the tongue at the base of her behind so it makes sharp contact with her vulva.Ah!she cries, and she tugs against the shackles.Quiet, I warn, and prowl around her once more.I flick the crop against her in the same sweet spot and she whines on contact, her eyes closed as she absorbs the sensation.With another twitch of my wrist, the crop snaps against her nipple.She throws her head back and moans.I aim again, and the crop licks her other nipple, and I watch it harden and lengthen beneath the bite of the leather keeper.Does that feel good?Yes, she rasps, eyes closed, head back.I smack her across her behind, harder this time.Yes, what?Yes, Sir, she cries.Slowly and with care, I lavish strokes, licks, and flicks over her stomach and her belly, down her body, toward my goal.With one flick, the leather tongue bites her clitoris and she shouts out in a gargled cry, Oh, please!Quiet, I command, and reprimand her with a harder flick across her backside.I skim the leather tongue down through her pubic hair, against her vulva to her vagina.The brown leather is glistening with her arousal when I pull it back.See how wet you are for this, Anastasia.Open your eyes and your mouth.Shes breathing hard, but she parts her lips and stares at me, her eyes dazed and lost in the carnality of the moment.And I slip the keeper into her mouth.See how you taste.Suck.Suck hard, baby.Her lips close around the tip and its like theyre around my dick.Fuck.Shes so fucking hot and I cant resist her.Easing the crop from her mouth, I wrap my arms around her.She opens her mouth for me as I kiss her, my tongue exploring her, reveling in the taste of her lust.Oh, baby, you taste mighty fine, I whisper.Shall I make you come?Please, she pleads.One flick of my wrist and the crop smacks her behind.Please, what?Please, Sir, she whimpers.Good girl.I step back.With this?I ask, holding up the crop so she can see it.Yes, Sir, she says, surprising me.Are you sure?I can barely believe my luck.Yes, please, Sir.Oh, Ana.You fucking goddess.Close your eyes.She does as shes told.And with infinite care and not a little gratitude, I rain quick, stinging licks over her belly once more.Soon shes panting again, her arousal heightened.Moving south, I gently flick the leather tongue over her clitoris.Again.And again.And again.She pulls at her restraints, moaning and moaning.Then shes quiet and I know shes close.Suddenly she throws her head back and mouth open and she screams her orgasm as it shudders through her entire body.Instantly I drop the crop and grab her, supporting her as her body dissolves.She sags against me.Oh.Were not done, Ana.With my hands under her thighs, I lift her trembling body and carry her, still shackled to the grid, toward the Saint Andrews cross.There I release her, holding her upright, pinned between the cross and my shoulders.I tug my jeans, undoing all the buttons, and freeing my cock.Yanking a condom from my pocket, I rip the foil packet with my teeth and with one hand roll it over my erection.Gently I pick her up again and whisper, Lift your legs, baby, wrap them around me.Supporting her back against the wood, I help her wrap her legs around my hips, her elbows resting on my shoulders.You are mine, baby.With one thrust Im inside her.Fuck.Shes exquisite.I take a moment to savor her.Then I start to move, relishing each thrust.Feeling her, on and on, my own breathing labored as I gasp for air and lose myself in this beautiful woman.My mouth is open at her neck, tasting her.Her scent fills my nostrils, fills me.Ana.Ana.Ana.I dont want to stop.Suddenly she tenses, and her body convulses around me.Yes.Again.And I let go.Filling her.Holding her.Revering her.Yes.Yes.Yes.Shes so beautiful.And sweet hell, was that mind blowing.I pull out of her, and as she collapses against me I quickly unbuckle her wrists from the grid and support her as we both sink to the floor.I cradle her between my legs, wrapping my arms around her, and she sags against me, her eyes closed, breathing hard.Well done, baby.Did that hurt?No.Her voice is barely audible.Did you expect it to?I ask, and I push stray strands of her hair off her face so I can see her better.Yes.You see?Most of your fear is in your head, Anastasia.I caress her face.Would you do it again?I ask.She doesnt answer immediately, and I think shes fallen asleep.Yes, she whispers a moment later.Thank you, sweet Lord.I wrap her in my arms.Good.So would I.  Again and again.Tenderly I kiss the top of her head and inhale.She smells of Ana and sweat and sex.And I havent finished with you yet, I assert.Im so proud of her.She did it.She did everything I wanted.Shes everything I want.And suddenly Im overwhelmed by an unfamiliar emotion that rocks through me, slicing through sinew and bone, leaving unease and fear in its wake.She turns her head and starts to nuzzle my chest.The darkness swells, startling and familiar, replacing my unease with a sense of dread.Every muscle in my body tenses.Ana blinks up at me with clear, unflinching eyes as I struggle to control my fear.Dont, I whisper.Please.She leans back and peers at my chest.Get control, Grey.Kneel by the door, I order, uncurling around her.Go.Dont touch me.Shakily she gets to her feet and stumbles over to the door, where she resumes her kneeling position.I take a deep, centering breath.What are you doing to me, Ana Steele?I stand and stretch, calmer now.As she kneels by the door, she looks every bit the ideal submissive.Her eyes are glazed; shes tired.Im sure shes coming down from the adrenaline high.Her eyelids droop.Oh, this will never do.You want her as a submissive, Grey.Show her what that means.From my drawer of toys I fish out one of the cable ties I bought from Claytons, and a pair of scissors.Boring you, am I, Miss Steele?I ask, masking my sympathy.She startles awake and regards me guiltily.Stand up, I order.Slowly she gets to her feet.Youre shattered, arent you?She nods with a bashful smile.Oh, baby, youve done so well.Stamina, Miss Steele.I havent had my fill of you yet.Hold out your hands in front, as if youre praying.A crease mars her forehead for a moment, but she presses her palms together and holds up her hands.I fasten the cable tie around her wrists.Her eyes flash to mine with recognition.Look familiar?I give her a smile and run my finger around the plastic, checking that theres enough room and its not too tight.I have scissors here.I bring them into her view.I can cut you out of this in a moment.She looks reassured.Come.Taking her clasped hands, I lead her to the far corner of the four poster bed.I want moremuch, much more, I whisper in her ear as she stares down at the bed.But Ill make this quick.Youre tired.Hold on to the post.Halting, she grasps the wooden pillar.Lower, I order.She moves her hands down to the base until shes bending over.Good.Dont let go.If you do, Ill spank you.Understand?Yes, Sir, she says.Good.I grab her hips and lift her toward me so shes properly positioned, her beautiful behind in the air and at my disposal.Dont let go, Anastasia, I warn her.Im going to fuck you hard from behind.Hold the post to support your weight.Understand?Yes.I smack her hard across her backside.Yes, Sir, she says immediately.Part your legs.I push my right foot against hers, widening her stance.Thats better.After this, Ill let you sleep.Her back is a perfect curve, each vertebra outlined from her nape to her fine, fine ass.I trace the line with my fingers.You have such beautiful skin, Anastasia, I say to myself.Bending over her, I follow the path my fingers have taken with tender kisses down her spine.As I do, I palm her breasts, trapping her nipples between my fingers, and tug.She writhes beneath me, and I plant a soft kiss at her waist, then suck and gently nip her skin while working her nipples.She whimpers.I stop and stand back to admire the view, growing harder just looking at her.Reaching for a second condom from my pocket, I quickly kick my jeans off and open the foil packet.Using both hands, I wrap it around my cock.Id like to claim her ass.Now.But its too soon for that.You have such a captivating, sexy ass.What Id like to do to it.I stroke my hands over each cheek, fondling her, then slide two fingers inside her, stretching her.She whimpers again.Shes ready.So wet.You never disappoint, Miss Steele.Hold tight.This is going to be quick, baby.Clutching her hips, I position myself at the entrance of her vagina, then reach up, grab her braid, wind it around my wrist, and hold it tightly.With one hand on my cock and the other around her hair, I slide into her.She.Is.So.Fucking.Sweet.Slowly I slide out of her, then grip her hip with my free hand and tighten my hold on her hair.Submissive.I slam into her, forcing her forward with a cry.Hold on, Anastasia!I remind her.If she doesnt she might get hurt.Breathless, she pushes back against me, bracing her legs.Good girl.Then I start pounding into her, eliciting small, strangled cries from her as she clings to the post.But she doesnt back down.She pushes back.Bravo, Ana.And then I feel it.Slowly.Her insides curling around me.Losing control, I slam into her, and still.Come on, Ana, give it to me, I growl, as I come, hard, her release prolonging mine as I hold her up.Gathering her in my arms, I lower us to the floor with Ana on top of me, both of us facing the ceiling.Shes utterly relaxed, exhausted no doubt; her weight a welcome comfort.I stare up at the karabiners, wondering if shell ever let me suspend her.Probably not.And I dont care.Our first time together in here, and shes been a dream.I kiss her ear.Hold up your hands.My voice is husky.Slowly, she raises them as if theyre weighted with concrete, and I slide the scissors beneath the cable tie.I declare this Ana open.I murmur, and snip, freeing her.She giggles, her body juddering against mine.Its a strange and not unwelcome feeling that makes me grin.That is such a lovely sound, I whisper as she rubs her wrists.I sit up so that shes in my lap.I love making her laugh.She doesnt laugh enough.Thats my fault, I admit to myself as I rub some life back into her shoulders and arms.She turns her face to me with a weary, searching look.That you dont giggle more often, I clarify.Im not a great giggler, she says, and yawns.Oh, but when it happens, tis a wonder and joy to behold.Very flowery, Mr.Grey, she says, teasing me.I smile.Id say youre thoroughly fucked and in need of sleep.That wasnt flowery at all, she scoffs, scolding me.Lifting her off my lap so I can stand up, I reach for my jeans and slip them on.Dont want to frighten Taylor, or Mrs.Jones, for that matter.It wouldnt be the first time.Ana sits in a sleepy daze on the floor.I clasp her upper arms, help her to her feet, and take her to the door.From the hook on the back of the door I grab the gray robe and dress her.Shes no help whatsoever; she really is exhausted.Bed, I announce, kissing her quickly.An alarmed expression crosses her drowsy face.For sleep, I reassure her.And bending down, I gather her in my arms, cradle her against my chest, and carry her to the subs room.There I pull back the comforter and lay her down, and in a moment of weakness climb into the bed beside her.Covering us both with the duvet, I embrace her.Ill just hold her until shes asleep.Sleep now, gorgeous girl.I kiss her hair feeling utterly satedand grateful.We did it.This sweet, innocent woman let me loose on her.And I think she enjoyed it.I know I didmore than ever before.Mommy sits looking at me in the mirror with the big crack.I brush her hair.Its soft and smells of Mommy and flowers.She takes the brush and winds her hair round and round.So its like a bumpy snake down her back.There, she says.And she turns around and smiles at me.Today, shes happy.I like when Mommy is happy.I like it when she smiles at me.She looks pretty when she smiles.Lets bake a pie, Maggot.Apple pie.I like when Mommy bakes.I wake suddenly with a sweet scent invading my mind.Its Ana.Shes fast asleep beside me.I lie back and stare at the ceiling.When have I ever slept in this room?Never.The thought is unnerving, and for some unfathomable reason it makes me uneasy.Whats going on, Grey?I sit up carefully, not wanting to disturb her, and stare down at her sleeping form.I know what it isIm unsettled because Im in here with her.I climb out of bed, leaving her to sleep, and head back to the playroom.There I collect the used cable tie and condoms and stash them in my pocket, where I find Anas panties.With the crop, her clothes, and her shoes in hand, I leave and lock the door.Back in her room, I hang her dress on the closet door, place her shoes beneath the chair, and lay her bra on top.I take her panties from my pocketand a wicked idea comes to mind.I head for my bathroom.I need a shower before we head to dinner with my family.Ill let Ana sleep awhile longer.The piping hot water cascades over me, washing away all the anxiety and unease that Id felt earlier.As first times go, that was not bad, for either of us.And Id thought that a relationship with Ana was impossible, but now the future now seems full of possibility.I make a mental note to call Caroline Acton in the morning to dress my girl.After a productive hour in my study, catching up on my reading for work, I decide that Ana has had enough sleep.Its dusk outside, and we have to leave in forty five minutes for dinner at my parents.Its been easier to concentrate on my work, knowing that shes upstairs in her bedroom.Weird.Well, I know shes safe up there.From the refrigerator I take a carton of cranberry juice and a bottle of sparkling water.I mix them in a glass and head upstairs.Shes still fast asleep, curled up where I left her.I dont think shes moved at all.Her lips are parted as she breathes softly.Her hair is tousled, tendrils escaping from her braid.I sit on the edge of the bed beside her, lean down, and kiss her temple.She mumbles a protest in her sleep.Anastasia, wake up.My voice is gentle as I coax her awake.No, she grumbles, hugging her pillow.We have to leave in half an hour for dinner at my parents.Her eyes flicker open and focus on me.Come on, sleepyhead.Get up.I kiss her temple again.Ive brought you a drink.Ill be downstairs.Dont go back to sleep, or youll be in trouble, I warn as she stretches her arms.I kiss her once more and with a glance at the chair, where she wont find her panties, I saunter back downstairs, unable to suppress my grin.Playtime, Grey.While Im waiting for Miss Steele I press a button on the iPod remote and the music springs to life on random shuffle.Restless, I wander over to the balcony doors and stare out at the early evening sky, listening to Talking Heads And She Was.Taylor enters.Mr.Grey.Shall I bring the car around?Give us five minutes.Yes, sir, he says, and disappears toward the service elevator.Ana appears a few minutes later at the entrance to the living room.She looks luminous, stunning evenand amused.Whats she going to say about her missing panties?Hi, she says with a cryptic smile.Hi.How are you feeling?Her smile broadens.Good, thanks.You?She feigns nonchalance.I feel mighty fine, Miss Steele.The suspense is tantalizing and I hope my anticipation is not written all over my face.Frank?I never figured you for a Sinatra fan, she says, cocking her head and giving me a curious look, as the rich tones of Witchcraft fill the room.Eclectic taste, Miss Steele.I step toward her until Im standing right in front of her.Will she crack?Im searching for an answer in her glittering blue eyes.Ask me for your panties, baby.I caress her cheek with my fingertips.She leans her face into my touchand Im completely seducedby her sweet gesture, by her teasing expression, and by the music.I want her in my arms.Dance with me, I whisper, as I remove the remote from my pocket and turn up the volume until Franks crooning surrounds us.She gives me her hand.I circle her waist and pull her beautiful body against mine, and we start a slow, simple fox trot.She grasps my shoulder, but Im prepared for her touch, and together we whirl across the floor, her radiant face lighting up the roomand me.She falls into step with my lead, and when the song comes to an end, shes giddy and breathless.And so am I.   Theres no nicer witch than you.I plant a chaste kiss on her lips.Well, thats brought some color to your cheeks.Thank you for the dance.Shall we go and meet my parents?Youre welcome, and yes, I cant wait to meet them, she replies, looking flushed and lovely.Do you have everything you need?Oh yes, she says with easy confidence.Are you sure?She nods, her lips carved in a smirk.God, she has guts.I grin.Okay.I cant hide my delight.If thats the way you want to play it, Miss Steele.I grab my jacket and we head to the elevator.She never fails to surprise, impress, and disarm me.Now I will have to sit through dinner with my parents, knowing my girl is not wearing any underwear.In fact, Im traveling down in this elevator right now, knowing shes naked beneath her skirt.Shes turned the tables on you, Grey.SHES QUIET AS TAYLOR drives us north on I 5.I catch a glimpse of Union Lake; the moon disappears behind a cloud, and the water darkens, like my mood.Why am I taking her to see my parents?If they meet her, theyll have certain expectations.And so will Ana.And Im not sure if the relationship I want with Ana will live up to those expectations.And to make matters worse, I put all this in motion when I insisted she meet Grace.Im the only one to blame.Me, and the fact that Elliot is fucking her roommate.Who am I kidding?If I didnt want her to meet my folks, she wouldnt be here.I just wish I wasnt so anxious about it.Yeah.Thats the problem.Where did you learn to dance?she asks, interrupting my chain of thoughts.Oh, Ana.Shes not going to want me to go there.Christian, hold me.There.Properly.Right.One step.Two.Good.Keep in time to the music.Sinatra is perfect for the fox trot.Elena is in her element.Yes, Maam.Do you really want to know?I answer.Yes, she replies, but her tone says otherwise.You asked.I sigh in the darkness beside her.Mrs.Robinson was fond of dancing.She must have been a good teacher.Her whisper is tinged with regret and reluctant admiration.She was.Thats right.Again.One.Two.Three.Four.Baby, youve got this.Elena and I glide across her basement.Again.She laughs, her head thrown back, and she looks like a woman half her age.Ana nods and studies the landscape, no doubt concocting some theory about Elena.Or maybe shes thinking about meeting my parents.I wish I knew.Perhaps shes nervous.Like me.Ive never taken a girl home.When Ana starts fidgeting I sense something is worrying her.Is she concerned about what we did today?Dont, I say, my voice softer than I intend.She turns to look at me, her expression unreadable in the dark.Dont what?Overthink things, Anastasia.Whatever youre thinking about.I reach over, take her hand, and kiss her knuckles.I had a wonderful afternoon.Thank you.I get a brief flash of white teeth and a timid smile.Why did you use a cable tie?she asks.Questions about this afternoon; this is good.Its quick, its easy, and its something different for you to feel and experience.I know theyre quite brutal, and I do like that in a restraining device.My voice is dry as I try to inject a little humor back into our conversation.Very effective at keeping you in your place.Her eyes dart toward Taylor in the front seat.Sweetheart, dont worry about Taylor.He knows exactly whats going on, and hes done this for four years.All part of my world, Anastasia.I give her hand a reassuring squeeze before I release it.Ana returns to staring out of the window; were surrounded by water as we cross Lake Washington on the 520 bridge, my favorite part of this journey.She draws up her feet and, curled on the seat, coils her arms around her legs.Something is up.When she glances at me, I ask, Penny for your thoughts?She sighs.Shit.That bad, huh?I wish I knew what you were thinking, she says.I smirk, relieved to hear this, and glad she doesnt know whats really on my mind.Ditto, baby, I reply.TAYLOR PULLS UP OUTSIDE my parents front door.Are you ready for this?I ask.Ana nods and I squeeze her hand.First for me, too, I whisper.When Taylors out the door I give her a wicked, salacious grin.Bet you wish you were wearing your underwear right now.Her breath hitches and she scowls, but I climb out of the car to greet my mother and father, who are waiting on the doorstep.Ana looks cool and calm as she walks around the car to us.Anastasia, youve met my mother, Grace.This is my dad, Carrick.Mr.Grey, what a pleasure to meet you.She smiles and shakes his outstretched hand.The pleasure is all mine, Anastasia.Please, call me Ana.Ana, how lovely to see you again.Grace hugs her.Come in, my dear.Taking Anas arm, she leads her inside and I follow in her pantyless wake.Is she here?Mia screams from somewhere inside the house.Ana gives me a startled look.That would be Mia, my little sister.We both turn in the direction of the high heels clattering through the hall.And there she is.Anastasia!Ive heard so much about you!Mia wraps her in a big hug.Though shes taller than Ana, I remember theyre almost the same age.Mia takes her hand and drags her into the vestibule as my parents and I follow.Hes never brought a girl home before, Mia tells Ana in a shrill voice.Mia, calm down, Grace chides.Yes, for fucks sake, Mia.Stop making such a scene.Ana catches me rolling my eyes and shoots me a withering look.Grace greets me with a kiss on both cheeks.Hello, darling.Shes glowing, happy to have all her children home.Carrick offers his hand.Hello, son.Long time no see.We shake hands and follow the women into the living room.Dad, you saw me yesterday, I mutter.Dad jokesmy father excels at them.Kavanagh and Elliot are cuddling on one of the sofas.But Kavanagh gets up to hug Ana when we enter.Christian.She gives me a polite nod.Kate.And now Elliot has his big paws all over Ana.Fuck, who knew my family was so touchy feely all of a sudden?Put her down.I glare at Elliot and he grinsan Im just showing you how its done expression plastered all over his face.I slip my arm around Anas waist and pull her to my side.All eyes are on us.Hell.This feels like a freak show.Drinks?Dad offers.Prosecco?Please, Ana and I reply together.Mia bounces on the spot and claps her hands.Youre even saying the same things.Ill get them.She dashes out of the room.What the hell is wrong with my family?Ana frowns.Shes probably finding them weird, too.Dinners almost ready, Grace says as she follows Mia out of the room.Sit, I tell Ana, and I lead her over to one of the sofas.She does as shes told and I sit at her side, careful not to touch her.I need to set an example for my overly demonstrative family.Maybe theyve always been this way?My father diverts me.We were just talking about vacations, Ana.Elliot has decided to follow Kate and her family to Barbados for a week.Dude!I stare at Elliot.What the hell happened to Mr.Love Em and Leave Em?Kavanagh must be good in the sack.She certainly looks smug enough.Are you taking a break now that youve finished your degree?Carrick asks Ana.Im thinking about going to Georgia for a few days, she answers.Georgia?I exclaim, unable to hide my surprise.My mother lives there, she says, her voice wavering, and I havent seen her for a while.When were you thinking of going?I snap.Tomorrow, late evening.Tomorrow!What the fuck?And Im only learning of this now?Mia returns with pink prosecco for Ana and me.Your good health!Dad raises his glass.For how long?I persist, trying to keep my voice level.I dont know yet.It will depend how my interviews go tomorrow.Interviews?Tomorrow?Ana deserves a break, Kavanagh interrupts, staring at me with ill concealed antagonism.I want to tell her to mind her own fucking business, but for Anas sake I hold my tongue.You have interviews?Dad asks Ana.Yes, for internships at two publishers, tomorrow.When was she going to tell me this?Im here with her for two minutes and Im finding out details of her life that I should know!I wish you the best of luck, Carrick says to her with a kind smile.Dinner is ready, Grace calls from across the hall.I let the others exit the room but grab Anas elbow before she can follow.When were you going to tell me you were leaving?My temper is rapidly unraveling.Im not leaving.Im going to see my mother.And I was only thinking about it.Ana dismisses me, as if Im a child.What about our arrangement?We dont have an arrangement yet.But.I lead us through the living room door and into the hallway.This conversation is not over, I warn as we enter the dining room.Mom has gone all outbest china, best crystalfor Anas and Kavanaghs benefit.I hold out a chair for Ana; she sits down and I take a seat beside her.Mia beams at both of us from across the table.Where did you meet Ana?Mia asks.She interviewed me for the WSU student newspaper.Which Kate edits, Ana interjects.I want to be a journalist, Kate tells Mia.My father offers Ana some wine while Mia and Kate discuss journalism.Kavanagh has an internship at the Seattle Times, no doubt set up for her by her father.From the corner of my eye I notice that Anas studying me.What?I ask.Please dont be mad at me, she says, so low that only I can hear.Im not mad at you, I lie.Her eyes narrow, and its obvious she doesnt believe me.Yes, I am mad at you, I confess.And now I feel like Im overreacting.I close my eyes.Get a grip, Grey.Palm twitchingly mad?she whispers.What are you two whispering about?Kavanagh interrupts.Good God!Is she always like this?So intrusive?How the hell does Elliot put up with her?I glower at her, and she has the sense to back off.Just about my trip to Georgia, Ana says, with sweetness and charm.Kate smirks.How was Jos when you went to the bar with him on Friday?she asks, with a brash look in my direction.What.The.Fuck.Is.This?Ana tenses beside me.He was fine, she says quietly.Palm twitchingly mad, I whisper to her.Especially now.So she went to a bar with the guy who was trying to ram his tongue down her throat the last time I saw him.And shed already agreed to be mine.Sneaking off to a bar with another man?And without my permission  She deserves to be punished.Around me, dinner is being served.Ive agreed not to go too hard on hermaybe I should use a flogger.Or maybe I should administer a straightforward spanking, harder than the last one.Here, tonight.Yes.That has possibilities.Anas looking down at her fingers.Kate, Elliot, and Mia are in a conversation about French cooking, and Dad returns to the table.Wheres he been?Call for you, darling.Its the hospital, he says to Grace.Please start, everyone, Mom says, passing a plate of food to Ana.Smells good.Ana licks her lips and the action resonates in my groin.She must be starving.Good.Thats something.Mom has surpassed herself: chorizo, scallops, peppers.Nice.And I realize that I, too, am hungry.That cant be helping my mood.But I brighten watching Ana eat.Grace returns, looking worried.Everything okay?Dad asks, and we all look up at her.Another measles case.Grace sighs heavily.Oh no, Dad says.Yes, a child.The fourth case this month.If only people would get their kids vaccinated.Grace shakes her head.Im so glad our children never went through that.They never caught anything worse than chicken pox, thank goodness.Poor Elliot.We all look at Elliot, who stops eating, mid chew, mouth stuffed full, bovine.Hes uncomfortable being the center of attention.Kavanagh gives Grace a questioning look.Christian and Mia were lucky, Grace explains.They got it so mildly, only a spot to share between them.Oh, give it a rest, Mom.So, did you catch the Mariners game, Dad?Elliots clearly keen to move the conversation on, as am I.   I cant believe they beat the Yankees, Carrick says.Did you watch the game, hotshot?Elliot asks me.No.But I read the sports column.The Ms are going places.Nine games won out of the last eleven, gives me hope.Dad sounds excited.Theyre certainly having a better season than 2010, I add.Gutierrez in center field was awesome.That catch!Wow.Elliot throws up his arms.Kavanagh fawns over him like a lovesick fool.How are you settling into your new apartment, dear?Grace asks Ana.Weve only been there one night, and I still have to unpack, but I love that its so centraland a short walk to Pike Place, and near the water.Oh, so youre close to Christian, then, Grace remarks.Moms helper starts to clear the table.I still cant remember her name.Shes Swiss, or Austrian or something, and she doesnt stop simpering and batting eyelashes at me.Have you been to Paris, Ana?Mia asks.No, but Id love to go.We honeymooned in Paris, Mom says.She and Dad exchange a look across the table, which frankly Id prefer not to see.They obviously had a good time.Its a beautiful city, in spite of the Parisians.Christian, you should take Ana to Paris!Mia exclaims.I think Anastasia would prefer London, I respond to my sisters ridiculous suggestion.Placing my hand on Anas knee, I explore her thigh at a leisurely pace, her dress riding up as my fingers follow.I want to touch her; stroke her where her panties should be.As my cock rouses in anticipation I suppress a groan and shuffle in my seat.She jerks away from me as if to cross her legs, and I close my hand around her thigh.Dont you dare!Ana takes a sip of wine, not taking her eyes off my mothers housekeeper, who is serving our entres.So what was wrong with the Parisians?Didnt they take to your winsome ways?Elliot teases Mia.Ugh, no, they didnt.And Monsieur Floubert, the ogre I was working for, he was such a domineering tyrant.Ana chokes on her wine.Anastasia, are you okay?I ask, and release her thigh.She nods, her cheeks red, and I pat her back and gently caress her neck.Domineering tyrant?Am I?The thought amuses me.Mia shoots me a look of approval at my public display of affection.Mom has cooked her signature dish, Beef Wellington, a recipe she picked up in London.I have to say it ranks close to yesterdays buttermilk fried chicken.In spite of her choking episode, Ana tucks into her meal and its so good to see her eat.Shes probably hungry after our energetic afternoon.I take a sip of my wine as I contemplate other ways to make her hungry.Mia and Kavanagh are discussing the relative merits of St.Barts vs.Barbados, where the Kavanagh family will be staying.Remember Elliot and the jellyfish?Mias eyes shine with mirth as she looks from Elliot to me.I chuckle.Screaming like a girl?Yeah.Hey, that could have been a Portuguese man of war!I hate jellyfish.They ruin everything.Elliot is emphatic.Mia and Kate burst into giggles, nodding in agreement.Ana is eating heartily and listening to the banter.Everyone else has calmed down, and my family is being less weird.Why am I so tense?This happens every day all across the country, families gathering to enjoy good food and each others company.Am I tense because I have Ana here?Am I worried they wont like her, or that she wont like them?Or is it because shes fucking off to Georgia tomorrow, and I knew nothing about that?Its confusing.Mia takes center stage as usual.Her tales of French life and French cooking are entertaining.Oh, Mom, les ptisseries sont tout simplement fabuleuses.La tarte aux pommes de M.  Floubert est incroyable, she says.Mia, chrie, tu parles franais, I interrupt her.Nous parlons anglais ici.Eh bien,  lexception bien sr dElliot.Il parle idiote, couramment.Mia throws her head back with a bellowing laugh, and its impossible not to join her.But by the end of dinner the tension is really wearing me down.I want to be alone with my girl.Ive only so much tolerance for inane chatter, even if its with my family, and Ive reached my limit.I peer down at Ana, then reach over and tug her chin.Dont bite your lip.I want to do that.I also have to establish a few ground rules.We need to discuss her impromptu trip to Georgia and going out for drinks with men who are infatuated with her.I put my hand on Anas knee again; I need to touch her.Besides, she should accept my touch, whenever I want to touch her.I gauge her reaction as my fingers travel up her thigh toward her panty free zone, teasing her skin.Her breath catches and she squeezes her thighs together, blocking my fingers, stopping me.Thats it.I have to excuse us from the dinner table.Shall I give you a tour of the grounds?I ask Ana, and I dont give her a chance to answer.Her eyes are luminous and serious as she places her hand in mine.Excuse me, she says to Carrick, and I lead her out of the dining room.In the kitchen Mia and Mom are clearing up.Im going to show Anastasia the backyard, I announce to my mother, pretending to be cheerful.Outside, my mood plunges south as my anger surfaces.Panties.The photographer.Georgia.We cross the terrace and climb the steps to the lawn.Ana pauses for a moment to admire the view.Yeah, yeah.Seattle.Lights.Moon.Water.I continue across the vast lawn toward my parents boathouse.Stop, please, Ana pleads.I do, and glare at her.My heels.I need to take my shoes off.Dont bother, I growl, and lift her quickly over my shoulder.She squeals in surprise.Hell.I smack her ass, hard.Keep your voice down!I snap, and stride across the lawn.Where are we going?she wails as she bounces on my shoulder.Boathouse.Why?I need to be alone with you.What for?Because Im going to spank and then fuck you.Why?she whines.You know why, I snap.I thought you were an in the moment guy?Anastasia, Im in the moment, trust me.Throwing open the boathouse door, I step inside and switch on the light.As the fluorescents ping to life I head upstairs to the snug.There I flip another switch, and halogens illuminate the room.I slide Ana down my body, glorying in the feel of her, and I set her on her feet.Her hair is dark and untamed, her eyes shining in the glow of the lights, and I know shes not wearing her panties.I want her.Now.Please dont hit me, she whispers.I dont understand.I stare down at her blankly.I dont want you to spank me, not here, not now.Please dont.ButI gape at her, paralyzed.Thats why were here.She lifts her hand, and for a moment I dont know what shes going to do.The darkness stirs and twists around my throat, threatening to choke me if she touches me.But she places her fingers on my cheek and gently skims them down to my chin.The darkness melts into oblivion and I close my eyes, feeling her gentle fingertips on me.
