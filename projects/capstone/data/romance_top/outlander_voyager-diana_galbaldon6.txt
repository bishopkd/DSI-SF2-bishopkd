What on earth happened?I asked, more than curious.He looked up at me, helpless.I canna say.It wasna that anything was wrong, exactlyonly that nothing was right.He rubbed a hand tiredly between his brows.It was me, I think; my fault.I always disappointed her somehow.Wed sit down to supper and all of a sudden the tears would well up in her eyes, and shed leave the table sobbing, and me sitting there wi not a notion what Id done or said wrong.His fist clenched on the coverlet, then relaxed.God, I never knew what to do for her, or what to say!Anything I said just made it worse, and there would be daysnay, weeks!when shed not speak to me, but only turn away when I came near her, and stand staring out the window until I went away again.His fingers went to the parallel scratches down the side of his neck.They were nearly healed now, but the marks of my nails still showed on his fair skin.He looked at me wryly.You never did that to me, Sassenach.Not my style, I agreed, smiling faintly.If Im mad at you, youll bloody know why, at least.He snorted briefly and lay back on his pillows.Neither of us spoke for a bit.Then he said, staring up at the ceiling, I thought I didna want to hear anything about what it was likewi Frank, I mean.I was maybe wrong about that.Ill tell you anything you want to know, I said.But not just now.Its still your turn.He sighed and closed his eyes.She was afraid of me, he said softly, a minute later.I tried to be gentle wi herGod, I tried again and again, everything I knew to please a woman.But it was no use.His head turned restlessly, making a hollow in the feather pillow.Maybe it was Hugh, or maybe Simon.I kent them both, and they were good men, but theres no telling what goes on in a marriage bed.Maybe it was bearing the children; not all women can stand it.But something hurt her, sometime, and I couldna heal it for all my trying.She shrank away when I touched her, and I could see the sickness and the fear in her eyes.There were lines of sorrow around his own closed eyes, and I reached impulsively for his hand.He squeezed it gently and opened his eyes.Thats why I left, finally, he said softly.I couldna bear it anymore.I didnt say anything, but went on holding his hand, putting a finger on his pulse to check it.His heartbeat was reassuringly slow and steady.He shifted slightly in the bed, moving his shoulders and making a grimace of discomfort as he did so.Arm hurt a lot?I asked.A bit.I bent over him, feeling his brow.He was very warm, but not feverish.There was a line between the thick ruddy brows, and I smoothed it with a knuckle.Head ache?Yes.Ill go and make you some willow bark tea.I made to rise, but his hand on my arm stopped me.I dinna need tea, he said.It would ease me, though, if maybe I could lay my head in your lap, and have ye rub my temples a bit?Blue eyes looked up at me, limpid as a spring sky.You dont fool me a bit, Jamie Fraser, I said.Im not going to forget about your next shot.Nonetheless, I was already moving the chair out of the way, and sitting down beside him on the bed.He made a small grunting sound of content as I moved his head into my lap and began to stroke it, rubbing his temples, smoothing back the thick wavy mass of his hair.The back of his neck was damp; I lifted the hair away and blew softly on it, seeing the smooth fair skin prickle into gooseflesh at the nape of his neck.Oh, that feels good, he murmured.Despite my resolve not to touch him beyond the demands of caretaking until everything between us was resolved, I found my hands molding themselves to the clean, bold lines of his neck and shoulders, seeking the hard knobs of his vertebrae and the broad, flat planes of his shoulder blades.He was firm and solid under my hands, his breath a warm caress on my thigh, and it was with some reluctance that I at last eased him back onto the pillow and reached for the ampule of penicillin.All right, I said, turning back the sheet and reaching for the hem of his shirt.A quick stick, and youll My hand brushed over the front of his nightshirt, and I broke off, startled.Jamie!I said, amused.You cant possibly!I dinna suppose I can, he agreed comfortably.He curled up on his side like a shrimp, his lashes dark against his cheek.But a man can dream, no?I didnt go upstairs to bed that night, either.We didnt talk much, just lay close together in the narrow bed, scarcely moving, so as not to jar his injured arm.The rest of the house was quiet, everyone safely in bed, and there was no sound but the hissing of the fire, the sigh of the wind, and the scratch of Ellens rosebush at the window, insistent as the demands of love.Do ye know?he said softly, somewhere in the black, small hours of the night.Do ye know what its like to be with someone that way?To try all ye can, and seem never to have the secret of them?Yes, I said, thinking of Frank.Yes, I do know.I thought perhaps ye did.He was quiet for a moment, and then his hand touched my hair lightly, a shadowy blur in the firelight.And then he whispered, then to have it back again, that knowing.To be free in all ye say or do, and know that it is right.To say I love you, and mean it with all your heart, I said softly to the dark.Aye, he answered, barely audible.To say that.His hand rested on my hair, and without knowing quite how it happened, I found myself curled against him, my head just fitting in the hollow of his shoulder.For so many years, he said, for so long, I have been so many things, so many different men.I felt him swallow, and he shifted slightly, the linen of his nightshirt rustling with starch.I was Uncle to Jennys children, and Brother to her and Ian.Milord to Fergus, and Sir to my tenants.Mac Dubh to the men of Ardsmuir and MacKenzie to the other servants at Helwater.Malcolm the printer, then, and Jamie Roy at the docks.The hand stroked my hair, slowly, with a whispering sound like the wind outside.But here, he said, so softly I could barely hear him, here in the dark, with youI have no name.I lifted my face toward his, and took the warm breath of him between my own lips.I love you, I said, and did not need to tell him how I meant it.38  I MEET A LAWYER  As I had predicted, eighteenth century germs were no match for a modern antibiotic.Jamies fever had virtually disappeared within twenty four hours, and within the next two days the inflammation in his arm began to subside as well, leaving no more than a reddening about the wound itself and a very slight oozing of pus when pressed.On the fourth day, after satisfying myself that he was mending nicely, I dressed the wound lightly with coneflower salve, bandaged it again, and left to dress and make my own toilet upstairs.Ian, Janet, Young Ian, and the servants had all put their heads in at intervals over the last few days, to see how Jamie progressed.Jenny had been conspicuously absent from these inquiries, but I knew that she was still entirely aware of everything that happened in her house.I hadnt announced my intention of coming upstairs, yet when I opened the door to my bedroom, there was a large pitcher of hot water standing by the ewer, gently steaming, and a fresh cake of soap laid alongside it.I picked it up and sniffed.Fine milled French soap, perfumed with lily of the valley, it was a delicate comment on my status in the householdhonored guest, to be sure; but not one of the family, who would all make do as a matter of course with the usual coarse soap made of tallow and lye.Right, I muttered.Well, well see, wont we?and lathered the cloth for washing.As I was arranging my hair in the glass a half hour later, I heard the sounds below of someone arriving.Several someones, in fact, from the sounds of it.I came down the stairs to find a small mob of children in residence, streaming in and out of the kitchen and front parlor, with here and there a strange adult visible in the midst of them, who stared curiously at me as I came down the stairs.Entering the parlor, I found the camp bed put away and Jamie, shaved and in a fresh nightshirt, neatly propped up on the sofa under a quilt with his left arm in a sling, surrounded by four or five children.These were shepherded by Janet, Young Ian, and a smiling young man who was a Fraser of sorts by the shape of his nose, but otherwise bore only the faintest resemblances to the tiny boy I had seen last at Lallybroch twenty years before.There she is!Jamie exclaimed with pleasure at my appearance, and the entire roomful of people turned to look at me, with expressions ranging from pleasant greeting to gape mouthed awe.Youll remember Young Jamie?the elder Jamie said, nodding to the tall, broad shouldered young man with curly black hair and a squirming bundle in his arms.I remember the curls, I said, smiling.The rest has changed a bit.Young Jamie grinned down at me.I remember ye well, Auntie, he said, in a deep brown voice like well aged ale.Ye held me on your knee and played Ten Wee Piggies wi my toes.I cant possibly have, I said, looking up at him in some dismay.While it seemed to be true that people really didnt change markedly in appearance between their twenties and their forties, they most assuredly did so between four and twenty four.Perhaps ye can have a go wi wee Benjamin here, Young Jamie suggested with a smile.Maybe the knack of it will come back to ye.He bent and carefully laid his bundle in my arms.A very round face looked up at me with that air of befuddlement so common to new babies.Benjamin appeared mildly confused at having me suddenly exchanged for his father, but didnt object.Instead, he opened his small pink mouth very wide, inserted his fist and began to gnaw on it in a thoughtful manner.A small blond boy in homespun breeks leaned on Jamies knee, staring up at me in wonder.Whos that, Nunkie?he asked in a loud whisper.Thats your great auntie Claire, Jamie said gravely.Yell have heard about her, I expect?Oh, aye, the little boy said, nodding madly.Is she as old as Grannie?Even older, Jamie said, nodding back solemnly.The lad gawked up at me for a moment, then turned back to Jamie, face screwed up in scorn.Get on wi ye, Nunkie!She doesna look anything like as old as Grannie!Why, theres scarce a bit o silver in her hair!Thank you, child, I said, beaming at him.Are ye sure thats our great auntie Claire?the boy went on, looking doubtfully at me.Mam says Great Auntie Claire was maybe a witch, but this lady doesna look much like it.She hasna got a single wart on her nose that I can see!Thanks, I said again, a little more dryly.And whats your name?He turned suddenly shy at being thus directly addressed, and buried his head in Jamies sleeve, refusing to speak.This is Angus Walter Edwin Murray Carmichael, Jamie answered for him, ruffling the silky blond hair.Maggies eldest son, and most commonly known as Wally.We call him Snot rag, a small red haired girl standing by my knee informed me.Cause his neb is always clotted wi gook.Angus Walter jerked his face out of his uncles shirt and glared at his female relation, his features beet red with fury.Is not!he shouted.Take it back!Not waiting to see whether she would or not, he flung himself at her, fists clenched, but was jerked off his feet by his great uncles hand, attached to his collar.Ye dinna hit girls, Jamie informed him firmly.Its not manly.But she said I was snotty!Angus Walter wailed.I must hit her!And its no verra civil to pass remarks about someones personal appearance, Mistress Abigail, Jamie said severely to the little girl.Ye should apologize to your cousin.Well, but he is Abigail persisted, but then caught Jamies stern eyes and dropped her own, flushing scarlet.Sorry, Wally, she murmured.Wally seemed at first indisposed to consider this adequate compensation for the insult he had suffered, but was at last prevailed upon to cease trying to hit his cousin by his uncle promising him a story.Tell the one about the kelpie and the horseman!my red haired acquaintance exclaimed, pushing forward to be in on it.No, the one about the Devils chess game!chimed in one of the other children.Jamie seemed to be a sort of magnet for them; two boys were plucking at his coverlet, while a tiny brown haired girl had climbed up onto the sofa back by his head, and begun intently plaiting strands of his hair.Pretty, Nunkie, she murmured, taking no part in the hail of suggestions.Its Wallys story, Jamie said firmly, quelling the incipient riot with a gesture.He can choose as he likes.He drew a clean handkerchief out from under the pillow and held it to Wallys nose, which was in fact rather unsightly.Blow, he said in an undertone, and then, louder, and then tell me which youll have, Wally.Wally snuffled obligingly, then said, St.Bride and the geese, please, Nunkie.Jamies eyes sought me, resting on my face with a thoughtful expression.All right, he said, after a pause.Well, then.Yell ken that the greylag mate for life?If ye kill a grown goose, hunting, ye must always wait, for the mate will come to mourn.Then ye must try to kill the second, too, for otherwise it will grieve itself to death, calling through the skies for the lost one.Little Benjamin shifted in his wrappings, squirming in my arms.Jamie smiled and shifted his attention back to Wally, hanging open mouthed on his great uncles knee.So, he said, it was a time, more hundreds of years past than you could ken or dream of, that Bride first set foot on the stone of the Highlands, along with Michael the Blessed  Benjamin let out a small squawk at this point, and began to rootle at the front of my dress.Young Jamie and his siblings seemed to have disappeared, and after a moments patting and joggling had proved vain, I left the room in search of Benjamins mother, leaving the story in progress behind me.I found the lady in question in the kitchen, embedded in a large company of girls and women, and after turning Benjamin over to her, spent some time in introductions, greeting, and the sort of ritual by which women appraise each other, openly and otherwise.The women were all very friendly; evidently everyone knew or had been told who I was, for while they introduced me from one to another, there was no apparent surprise at the return of Jamies first wifeeither from the dead or from France, depending on what theyd been told.Still, there were very odd undercurrents passing through the gathering.They scrupulously avoided asking me questions; in another place, this might be mere politeness, but not in the Highlands, where any strangers life history was customarily extracted in the course of a casual visit.And while they treated me with great courtesy and kindness, there were small looks from the corner of the eye, the passing of glances exchanged behind my back, and casual remarks made quietly in Gaelic.But strangest of all was Jennys absence.She was the hearthfire of Lallybroch; I had never been in the house when it was not suffused with her presence, all the inhabitants in orbit about her like planets about the sun.I could think of nothing less like her than that she should leave her kitchen with such a mob of company in the house.Her presence was as strong now as the perfume of the fresh pine boughs that lay in a large pile in the back pantry, their presence beginning to scent the house; but of Jenny herself, not a hair was to be seen.She had avoided me since the night of my return with Young Iannatural enough, I supposed, under the circumstances.Neither had I sought an interview with her.Both of us knew there was a reckoning to be made, but neither of us would seek it then.It was warm and cozy in the kitchentoo warm.The intermingled scents of drying cloth, hot starch, wet diapers, sweating bodies, oatcake frying in lard, and bread baking were becoming a bit too heady, and when Katherine mentioned the need of a pitcher of cream for the scones, I seized the opportunity to escape, volunteering to fetch it down from the dairy shed.After the press of heated bodies in the kitchen, the cold, damp air outside was so refreshing that I stood still for a minute, shaking the kitchen smells out of my petticoats and hair before making my way to the dairy shed.This shed was some distance away from the main house, convenient to the milking shed, which in turn was built to adjoin the two small paddocks in which sheep and goats were kept.Cattle were kept in the Highlands, but normally for beef, rather than milk, cows milk being thought suitable only for invalids.To my surprise, as I came out of the dairy shed, I saw Fergus leaning on the paddock fence, staring moodily at the mass of milling wooly backs below.I had not expected to see him here, and wondered whether Jamie knew he had returned.Jennys prized Merino sheepimported, hand fed and a great deal more spoilt than any of her grandchildrenspotted me as I passed, and rushed en masse for the side of their pen, blatting frenziedly in hope of tidbits.Fergus looked up, startled at the racket, then waved halfheartedly.He called something, but it was impossible to hear him over the uproar.There was a large bin of frost blasted cabbage heads near the pen; I pulled out a large, limp green head, and doled out leaves to a dozen or so pairs of eagerly grasping lips, in hopes of shutting them up.The ram, a huge wooly creature named Hughie, with testicles that hung nearly to the ground like wool covered footballs, shouldered his massive way into the front rank with a loud and autocratic Bahh!Fergus, who had reached my side by this time, picked up a whole cabbage and hurled it at Hughie with considerable force and fair accuracy.Tais toi!he said irritably.Hughie shied and let out an astonished, high pitched Beh!as the cabbage bounced off his padded back.Then, shaking himself back into some semblance of dignity, he trotted off, testes swinging with offended majesty.His flock, sheeplike, trailed after him, uttering a low chorus of discontented bahs in his wake.Fergus glowered malevolently after them.Useless, noisy, smelly beasts, he said.Rather ungratefully, I thought, given that the scarf and stockings he was wearing had almost certainly been woven from their wool.Nice to see you again, Fergus, I said, ignoring his mood.Does Jamie know youre back yet?I wondered just how much Fergus knew of recent events, if he had just arrived at Lallybroch.No, he said, rather listlessly.I suppose I should tell him I am here.In spite of this, he made no move toward the house, but continued staring into the churned mud of the paddock.Something was obviously eating at him; I hoped nothing had gone wrong with his errand.Did you find Mr.Gage all right?I asked.He looked blank for a moment, then a spark of animation came back into his lean face.Oh, yes.Milord was right; I went with Gage to warn the other members of the Society, and then we went together to the tavern where they were to meet.Sure enough, there was a nest of Customs men there waiting, disguised.And may they be waiting as long as their fellow in the cask, ha ha!The gleam of savage amusement died out of his eyes then, and he sighed.We cannot expect to be paid for the pamphlets, of course.And even though the press was saved, God knows how long it may be until milords business is reestablished.He spoke with such mournfulness that I was surprised.You dont help with the printing business, do you?I asked.He raised one shoulder and let it fall.Not to say help, milady.But milord was kind enough to allow me to invest a part of my share of the profits from the brandy in the printing business.In time, I should have become a full partner.I see, I said sympathetically.Do you need money?Perhaps I can  He shot me a glance of surprise, and then a smile that displayed his perfect, square white teeth.Thank you, milady, but no.I myself need very little, and I have enough.He patted the side pocket of his coat, which jingled reassuringly.He paused, frowning, and thrust both wrists deep into the pockets of his coat.Noo he said slowly.It is onlywell, the printing business is most respectable, milady.I suppose so, I said, slightly puzzled.He caught my tone and smiled, rather grimly.The difficulty, milady, is that while a smuggler may be in possession of an income more than sufficient for the support of a wife, smuggling as a sole profession is not likely to appeal to the parents of a respectable young lady.Oho, I said, everything becoming clear.You want to get married?To a respectable young lady?He nodded, a little shyly.Yes, Madame.But her mother does not favor me.I couldnt say I blamed the young ladys mother, all things considered.While Fergus was possessed of dark good looks and a dashing manner that might well win a young girls heart, he lacked a few of the things that might appeal somewhat more to conservative Scottish parents, such as property, income, a left hand, and a last name.Likewise, while smuggling, cattle lifting, and other forms of practical communism had a long and illustrious history in the Highlands, the French did not.And no matter how long Fergus himself had lived at Lallybroch, he remained as French as Notre Dame.He would, like me, always be an outlander.If I were a partner in a profitable printing firm, you see, perhaps the good lady might be induced to consider my suit, he explained.But as it is He shook his head disconsolately.I patted his arm sympathetically.Dont worry about it, I said.Well think of something.Does Jamie know about this girl?Im sure hed be willing to speak to her mother for you.To my surprise, he looked quite alarmed.Oh, no, milady!Please, say nothing to himhe has a great many things of more importance to think of just now.On the whole, I thought this was probably true, but I was surprised at his vehemence.Still, I agreed to say nothing to Jamie.My feet were growing chilly from standing in the frozen mud, and I suggested that we go inside.Perhaps a little later, milady, he said.For now, I believe I am not suitable company even for sheep.With a heavy sigh, he turned and trudged off toward the dovecote, shoulders slumped.To my surprise, Jenny was in the parlor with Jamie.She had been outside; her cheeks and the end of her long, straight nose were pink with the cold, and the scent of winter mist lingered in her clothes.Ive sent Young Ian to saddle Donas, she said.She frowned at her brother.Can ye stand to walk to the barn, Jamie, or had he best bring the beast round for ye?Jamie stared up at her, one eyebrow raised.I can walk wherever its needful to go, but Im no going anywhere just now.Did I not tell ye hed be coming?Jenny said impatiently.Amyas Kettrick stopped by here late last night, and said hed just come from Kinwallis.Hobarts meaning to come today, he said.She glanced at the pretty enameled clock on the mantel.If he left after breakfast, hell be here within the hour.Jamie frowned at his sister, tilting his head back against the sofa.I told ye, Jenny, Im no afraid of Hobart MacKenzie, he said shortly.Damned if Ill run from him!Jennys brows rose as she looked coldly at her brother.Oh, aye?she said.Ye werent afraid of Laoghaire, either, and look where that got ye!She jerked her head at the sling on his arm.Despite himself, Jamies mouth curled up on one side.Aye, well, its a point, he said.On the other hand, Jenny, ye ken guns are scarcer than hens teeth in the Highlands.I dinna think Hobarts going to come and ask to borrow my own pistol to shoot me with.I shouldna think hed bother; hell just walk in and spit ye through the gizzard like the silly gander ye are!she snapped.Jamie laughed, and she glared at him.I seized the moment to interrupt.Who, I inquired, is Hobart MacKenzie, and why exactly does he want to spit you like a gander?Jamie turned his head to me, the light of amusement still in his eyes.Hobart is Laoghaires brother, Sassenach, he explained.As for spitting me or otherwise  Laoghaires sent for him from Kinwallis, where he lives, Jenny interrupted, and told him aboutall this.A slight, impatient gesture encompassed me, Jamie, and the awkward situation in general.The notion being that Hobarts meant to come round and expunge the slight upon his sisters honor by expunging me, Jamie explained.He seemed to find the idea entertaining.I wasnt so sure about it, and neither was Jenny.Youre not worried about this Hobart?I asked.Of course not, he said, a little irritably.He turned to his sister.For Gods sake, Jenny, ye ken Hobart MacKenzie!The man couldna stick a pig without cutting off his own foot!She looked him up and down, evidently gauging his ability to defend himself against an incompetent pigsticker, and reluctantly concluding that he might manage, even one handed.Mmphm, she said.Well, and what if he comes for ye and ye kill him, aye?What then?Then hell be dead, I expect, Jamie said dryly.And yell be hangit for murder, she shot back, or on the run, wi all the rest of Laoghaires kin after ye.Want to start a blood feud, do ye?Jamie narrowed his eyes at his sister, emphasizing the already marked resemblance between them.What I want, he said, with exaggerated patience, is my breakfast.Dye mean to feed me, or dye mean to wait until I faint from hunger, and then hide me in the priest hole til Hobart leaves?Annoyance struggled with humor on Jennys fine boned face as she glared at her brother.As usual with both Frasers, humor won out.Its a thought, she said, teeth flashing in a brief, reluctant smile.If I could drag your stubborn carcass that far, Id club ye myself.She shook her head and sighed.All right, Jamie, yell have it your way.But yell try not to make a mess on my good Turkey carpet, aye?He looked up at her, long mouth curling up on one side.Its a promise, Jenny, he said.Nay bloodshed in the parlor.She snorted.Clot, she said, but without rancor.Ill send Janet wi your parritch.And she was gone, in a swirl of skirts and petticoats.Did she say Donas?I asked, looking after her in bemusement.Surely it isnt the same horse you took from Leoch!Och, no.Jamie tilted his head back, smiling up at me.This is Donass grandsonor one of them.We give the name to the sorrel colts in his honor.I leaned over the back of the sofa, gently feeling down the length of the injured arm from the shoulder.Sore?I asked, seeing him wince as I pressed a few inches above the wound.It was better; the day before, the area of soreness had started higher.Not bad, he said.He removed the sling and tried gingerly extending the arm, grimacing.I dinna think Ill turn handsprings awhile yet, though.I laughed.No, I dont suppose so.I hesitated.Jamiethis Hobart.You really dont think  I dont, he said firmly.And if I did, Id still want my breakfast first.I dinna mean to be killed on an empty stomach.I laughed again, somewhat reassured.Ill go and get it for you, I promised.As I stepped out into the hall, though, I caught sight of a flutter through one of the windows, and stopped to look.It was Jenny, cloaked and hooded against the cold, headed up the slope to the barn.Seized by a sudden impulse, I snatched a cloak from the hall tree and darted out after her.I had things to say to Jenny Murray, and this might be the best chance of catching her alone.I caught up with her just outside the barn; she heard my step behind her and turned, startled.She glanced about quickly, but saw we were alone.Realizing that there was no way of putting off a confrontation, she squared her shoulders under the woolen cloak and lifted her head, meeting my eyes straight on.I thought Id best tell Young Ian to unsaddle the horse, she said.Then Im going to the root cellar to fetch up some onions for a tart.Will ye come with me?I will.Pulling my cloak tight around me against the winter wind, I followed her into the barn.It was warm inside, at least by contrast with the chill outdoors, dark, and filled with the pleasant scent of horses, hay, and manure.I paused a moment to let my eyes adapt to the dimness, but Jenny walked directly down the central aisle, footsteps light on the stone floor.Young Ian was sprawled at length on a pile of fresh straw; he sat up, blinking at the sound.Jenny glanced from her son to the stall, where a soft eyed sorrel was peacefully munching hay from its manger, unburdened by saddle or bridle.Did I not tell ye to ready Donas?she asked the boy, her voice sharp.Young Ian scratched his head, looking a little sheepish, and stood up.Aye, mam, ye did, he said.But I didna think it worth the time to saddle him, only to have to unsaddle him again.Jenny stared up at him.Oh, aye?she said.And what made ye so certain he wouldna be needed?Young Ian shrugged, and smiled down at her.Mam, ye ken as well as I do that Uncle Jamie wouldna run away from anything, let alone Uncle Hobart.Dont ye?he added, gently.Jenny looked up at her son and sighed.Then a reluctant smile lighted her face and she reached up, smoothing the thick, untidy hair away from his face.Aye, wee Ian.I do.Her hand lingered along his ruddy cheek, then dropped away.Go along to the house, then, and have second breakfast wi your uncle, she said.Your auntie and I are goin to the root cellar.But ye come and fetch me smartly, if Mr.Hobart MacKenzie should come, aye?Right away, Mam, he promised, and shot for the house, impelled by the thought of food.Jenny watched him go, moving with the clumsy grace of a young whooping crane, and shook her head, the smile still on her lips.Sweet laddie, she murmured.Then, recalled to the present circumstances, she turned to me with decision.Come along, then, she said.I expect ye want to talk to me, aye?Neither of us said anything until we reached the quiet sanctuary of the root cellar.It was a small room dug under the house, pungent with the scent of the long braided strings of onions and garlic that hung from the rafters, the sweet, spicy scent of dried apples, and the moist, earthy smell of potatoes, spread in lumpy brown blankets over the shelves that lined the cellar.Dye remember telling me to plant potatoes?Jenny asked, passing a hand lightly over the clustered tubers.That was a lucky thing; twas the potato crop kept us alive, more than one winter after Culloden.I remembered, all right.I had told her as we stood together on a cold autumn night, about to partshe to return to a newborn baby, I to hunt for Jamie, an outlaw in the Highlands, under sentence of death.I had found him, and saved himand Lallybroch, evidently.And she had tried to give them both to Laoghaire.Why?I said softly, at last.I spoke to the top of her head, bent over her task.Her hand went out with the regularity of clockwork, pulling an onion from the long hanging braid, breaking the tough, withered stems from the plait and tossing it into the basket she carried.Why did you do it?I said.I broke off an onion from another braid, but instead of putting it in the basket, held it in my hands, rolling it back and forth like a baseball, hearing the papery skin rustle between my palms.Why did I do what?Her voice was perfectly controlled again; only someone who knew her well could have heard the note of strain in it.I knew her wellor had, at one time.Why did I make the match between my brother and Laoghaire, dye mean?She glanced up quickly, smooth black brows raised in question, but then bent back to the braid of onions.Youre right; he wouldna have done it, without I made him.So you did make him do it, I said.The wind rattled the door of the root cellar, sending a small sifting of dirt down upon the cut stone steps.He was lonely, she said, softly.So lonely.I couldna bear to see him so.He was wretched for so long, ye ken, mourning for you.I thought he was dead, I said quietly, answering the unspoken accusation.He might as well have been, she said, sharply, then raised her head and sighed, pushing back a lock of dark hair.Aye, maybe ye truly didna ken hed lived; there were a great many who didnt, after Cullodenand its sure he thought you were dead and gone then.But he was sair wounded, and not only his leg.And when he came home from England She shook her head, and reached for another onion.He was whole enough to look at, but not She gave me a look, straight on, with those slanted blue eyes, so disturbingly like her brothers.Hes no the sort of man should sleep alone, aye?Granted, I said shortly.But we did live, the both of us.Why did you send for Laoghaire when we came back with Young Ian?Jenny didnt answer at first, but only went on reaching for onions, breaking, reaching, breaking, reaching.I liked you, she said at last, so low I could barely hear her.Loved ye, maybe, when ye lived here with Jamie, before.I liked you, too, I said, just as softly.Then why?Her hands stilled at last and she looked up at me, fists balled at her sides.When Ian told me yed come back, she said slowly, eyes fastened on the onions, ye could have knocked me flat wi a down feather.At first, I was excited, wanting to see yewanting to know where yed been she added, arching her brows slightly in inquiry.I didnt answer, and she went on.But then I was afraid, she said softly.Her eyes slid away, shadowed by their thick fringe of black lashes.I saw ye, ye ken, she said, still looking off into some unseeable distance.When he wed Laoghaire, and them standing by the altarye were there wi them, standing at his left hand, betwixt him and Laoghaire.And I kent that meant ye would take him back.The hair prickled slightly on the nape of my neck.She shook her head slowly, and I saw she had gone pale with the memory.She sat down on a barrel, the cloak spreading out around her like a flower.Im not one of those born wi the Sight, nor one who has it regular.Ive never had it before, and hope never to have it again.But I saw ye there, as clear as I see ye now, and it scairt me so that I had to leave the room, right in the midst o the vows.She swallowed, looking at me directly.I dinna ken who ye are, she said softly.Ororwhat.We didna ken your people, or your place.I never asked ye, did I?Jamie chose ye, that was enough.But then ye were gone, and after so longI thought he might have forgot ye enough to wed again, and be happy.He wasnt, though, I said, hoping for confirmation from Jenny.She gave it, shaking her head.No, she said quietly.But Jamies a faithful man, aye?No matter how it was between the two of them, him and Laoghaire, if hed sworn to be her man, he wouldna leave her altogether.It didna matter that he spent most of his time in Edinburgh; I kent hed always come back herehed be bound here, to the Highlands.But then you came back.Her hands lay still in her lap, a rare sight.They were still finely shaped, long fingered and deft, but the knuckles were red and rough with years of work, and the veins stood out blue beneath the thin white skin.Dye ken, she said, looking into her lap, I have never been further than ten miles from Lallybroch, in all my life?No, I said, slightly startled.She shook her head slowly, then looked up at me.You have, though, she said.Youve traveled a great deal, I expect.Her gaze searched my face, looking for clues.I have.She nodded, as though thinking to herself.Youll go again, she said, nearly whispering.I kent ye would go again.Youre not bound here, not like Laoghairenot like me.And he would go with ye.And I should never see him again.She closed her eyes briefly, then opened them, looking at me under her fine dark brows.Thats why, she said.I thought if ye kent about Laoghaire, yed go again at onceyou did she added, with a faint grimace, and Jamie would stay.But ye came back.Her shoulders rose in a faint, helpless shrug.And I see its no good; hes bound to ye, for good or ill.Its you thats his wife.And if ye leave again, he will go with ye.I searched helplessly for words to reassure her.But I wont.I wont go again.I only want to stay here with himalways.I laid a hand on her arm and she stiffened slightly.After a moment, she laid her own hand over mine.It was chilled, and the tip of her long, straight nose was red with cold.Folk say different things of the Sight, aye?she said after a moment.Some say its doomed; whatever ye see that way must come to pass.But others say nay, its no but a warning; take heed and ye can change things.What dye think, yourself?She looked sideways at me, curiously.I took a deep breath, the smell of onions stinging the back of my nose.This was hitting home in no uncertain terms.I dont know, I said, and my voice shook slightly.Id always thought that of course you could change things if you knew about them.But nowI dont know, I ended softly, thinking of Culloden.Jenny watched me, her eyes so deep a blue as almost to be black in the dim light.I wondered again just how much Jamie had told herand how much she knew without the telling.But ye must try, even so, she said, with certainty.Ye couldna just leave it, could ye?I didnt know whether she meant this personally, but I shook my head.No, I said.You couldnt.Youre right; you have to try.We smiled at each other, a little shyly.Youll take good care of him?Jenny said suddenly.Even if ye go?Ye will, aye?I squeezed her cold fingers, feeling the bones of her hand light and fragile seeming in my grasp.I will, I said.Then thats all right, she said softly, and squeezed back.We sat for a moment, holding each others hands, until the door of the root cellar swung open, admitting a blast of rain and wind down the stairs.Mam?Young Ians head poked in, eyes bright with excitement.Hobart MacKenzies come!Da says to come quick!Jenny sprang to her feet, barely remembering to snatch up the basket of onions.Has he come armed, then?she asked anxiously.Has he brought a pistol or a sword?Ian shook his head, his dark hair lifting wildly in the wind.Oh, no, Mam!he said.Its worse.Hes brought a lawyer!Anything less resembling vengeance incarnate than Hobart MacKenzie could scarcely be imagined.A small, light boned man of about thirty, he had pale blue, pale lashed eyes with a tendency to water, and indeterminate features that began with a receding hairline and dwindled down into a similarly receding chin that seemed to be trying to escape into the folds of his stock.He was smoothing his hair at the mirror in the hall when we came in the front door, a neatly curled bob wig sitting on the table beside him.He blinked at us in alarm, then snatched up the wig and crammed it on his head, bowing in the same motion.Mrs.Jenny, he said.His small, rabbity eyes flicked in my direction, away, then back again, as though he hoped I really wasnt there, but was very much afraid I was.Jenny glanced from him to me, sighed deeply, and took the bull by the horns.Mr.MacKenzie, she said, dropping him a formal curtsy.Might I present my good sister, Claire?Claire, Mr.Hobart MacKenzie of Kinwallis.His mouth dropped open and he simply gawked at me.I started to extend a hand to him, but thought better of it.I would have liked to know what Emily Post had to recommend in a situation like this, but as Miss Post wasnt present, I was forced to improvise.How nice to meet you, I said, smiling as cordially as possible.Ah he said.He bobbed his head tentatively at me.Umyourservant, maam.Fortunately, at this point in the proceedings, the door to the parlor opened.I looked at the small, neat figure framed in the doorway, and let out a cry of delighted recognition.Ned!Ned Gowan!It was indeed Ned Gowan, the elderly Edinburgh lawyer who had once saved me from burning as a witch.He was noticeably more elderly now, shrunken with age and so heavily wrinkled as to look like one of the dried apples I had seen in the root cellar.The bright black eyes were the same, though, and they fastened on me at once with an expression of joy.My dear!he exclaimed, hastening forward at a rapid hobble.He seized my hand, beaming, and pressed it to his withered lips in fervent gallantry.I had heard that you  How did you come to be  so delightful to see you!so happy to see you again, but  A cough from Hobart MacKenzie interrupted this rapturous exchange, and Mr.Gowan looked up, startled, then nodded.Oh, aye, of course.Business first, my dear, he said, with a gallant bow to me, and then if ye will, I should be most charmed to hear the tale of your adventures.AhIll do my best, I said, wondering just how much he would insist on hearing.Splendid, splendid.He glanced about the hall, bright little eyes taking in Hobart and Jenny, who had hung up her cloak and was smoothing her hair.Mr.Fraser and Mr.Murray are already in the parlor.Mr.MacKenzie, if you and the ladies would consent to join us, perhaps we can settle your affairs expeditiously, and proceed to more congenial matters.If you will allow me, my dear?He crooked a bony arm to me invitingly.Jamie was still on the sofa where I had left him, and in approximately the same conditionthat is, alive.The children were gone, with the exception of one chubby youngster who was curled up on Jamies lap, fast asleep.Jamies hair now sported several small plaits on either side, with silk ribbons woven gaily through them, which gave him an incongruously festive air.You look like the Cowardly Lion of Oz, I told him in an undertone, sitting down on a hassock behind his sofa.I didnt think it likely that Hobart MacKenzie intended any outright mischief, but if anything happened, I meant to be in close reach of Jamie.He looked startled, and put a hand to his head.I do?Shh, I said, Ill tell you later.The other participants had now arranged themselves around the parlor, Jenny sitting down by Ian on the other love seat, and Hobart and Mr.Gowan taking two velvet chairs.We are assembled?Mr.Gowan inquired, glancing around the room.All interested parties are present?Excellent.Well, to begin with, I must declare my own interest.I am here in the capacity of solicitor to Mr.Hobart MacKenzie, representing the interests of Mrs.James Fraser he saw me start, and added, with precisionthat is, the second Mrs.James Fraser, ne Laoghaire MacKenzie.That is understood?He glanced inquiringly at Jamie, who nodded.It is.Good.Mr.Gowan picked up a glass from the table next to him and took a tiny sip.My clients, the MacKenzies, have accepted my proposal to seek a legal solution to the imbroglio which I understand has resulted from the sudden and unexpectedthough of course altogether happy and fortuitous he added, with a bow to me, return of the first Mrs.Fraser.He shook his head reprovingly at Jamie.You, my dear young man, have contrived to entangle yourself in considerable legal difficulties, I am sorry to say.Jamie raised one eyebrow and looked at his sister.Aye, well, I had help, he said dryly.Just what difficulties are we speakin of?Well, to begin with, Ned Gowan said cheerily, his sparkling black eyes sinking into nets of wrinkles as he smiled at me, the first Mrs.Fraser would be well within her rights to bring a civil suit against ye for adultery, and criminal fornication, forbye.Penalties for which include  Jamie glanced back at me, with a quick blue gleam.I think Im no so worrit by that possibility, he told the lawyer.What else?Ned Gowan nodded obligingly and held up one withered hand, folding down the fingers as he ticked off his points.With respect to the second Mrs.Fraserne Laoghaire MacKenzieye could, of course, be charged wi bigamous misconduct, intent to defraud, actual fraud committedwhether wi intent or no, which is a separate questionfelonious misrepresentationhe happily folded down his fourth finger and drew breath for moreand  Jamie had been listening patiently to this catalogue.Now he interrupted, leaning forward.Ned, he said gently, what the hell does the bloody woman want?The small lawyer blinked behind his spectacles, lowered his hand, and cast up his eyes to the beams overhead.Weel, the ladys chief desire as stated, he said circumspectly, is to see ye castrated and disemboweled in the market square at Broch Mordha, and your head mounted on a stake over her gate.Jamies shoulders vibrated briefly, and he winced as the movement jarred his arm.I see, he said, his mouth twitching.A smile gathered up the wrinkles by Neds ancient mouth.I was obliged to inform Mrs.that is, the lady he amended, with a glance at me and a slight cough, that her remedies under the law were somewhat more limited than would accommodate her desires.Quite, Jamie said dryly.But I assume the general idea is that she doesna particularly want me back as a husband?No, Hobart put in unexpectedly.Crows bait, maybe, but not a husband.Ned cast a cold glance at his client.Ye willna compromise your case by admitting things in advance of settlement, aye?he said reprovingly.Or what are ye payin me for?He turned back to Jamie, professional dignity unimpaired.While Miss MacKenzie does not wish to resume a marital position wi regard to youan action which would be impossible in any case, he added fairly, unless ye should wish to divorce the present Mrs.Fraser, and remarry  No, I dinna want to do that, Jamie assured him hurriedly, with another glance at me.Well, in such case, Ned went on, unruffled, I should advise my clients that it is more desirable where possible to avoid the costand the publicity he added, cocking an invisible eyebrow in admonition to Hobart, who nodded hastily, of a suit at law, with a public trial and its consequent exposure of facts.That being the case  How much?Jamie interrupted.Mr.Fraser!Ned Gowan looked shocked.I havena mentioned anything in the nature of a pecuniary settlement as yet  Only because yere too busy enjoying yourself, ye wicked auld rascal, Jamie said.He was irritateda red patch burned over each cheekbonebut amused, too.Get to it, aye?Ned Gowan inclined his head ceremoniously.Weel, ye must understand, he began, that a successful suit brought under the charges as described might result in Miss MacKenzie and her brother mulcting ye in substantial damagesverra substantial indeed, he added, with a faint lawyerly gloating at the prospect.After all, Miss MacKenzie has not only been subject to public humiliation and ridicule leading to acute distress of mind, but is also threatened with loss of her chief means of support  She isna threatened wi any such thing, Jamie interrupted heatedly.I told her I should go on supporting her and the two lassies!What does she think I am?Ned exchanged a glance with Hobart, who shook his head.Ye dinna want to know what she thinks ye are, Hobart assured Jamie.I wouldna have thought she kent such words, myself.But ye do mean to pay?Jamie nodded impatiently, rubbing his good hand through his hair.Aye, I will.Only until shes marrit again, though.Everyones head turned in surprise toward Jenny, who nodded firmly to Ned Gowan.If Jamies married to Claire, the marriage between him and Laoghaire wasna valid, aye?The lawyer bowed.That is true, Mrs.Murray.Well, then, Jenny said, in a decided manner.Shes free to marry again at once, is she no?And once she does, my brother shouldna be providing for her household.An excellent point, Mrs.Murray.Ned Gowan took up his quill and scratched industriously.Well, we make progress, he declared, laying it down again and beaming at the company.Now, the next point to be covered  An hour later, the decanter of whisky was empty, the sheets of foolscap on the table were filled with Ned Gowans chicken scratchings, and everyone lay limp and exhaustedexcept Ned himself, spry and bright eyed as ever.Excellent, excellent, he declared again, gathering up the sheets and tapping them neatly into order.Sothe main provisions of the settlement are as follows: Mr.Fraser agrees to pay to Miss MacKenzie the sum of five hundred pounds in compensation for distress, inconvenience, and the loss of his conjugal servicesJamie snorted slightly at this, but Ned affected not to hear him, continuing his synopsisand in addition, agrees to maintain her household at the rate of one hundred pounds per annum, until such time as the aforesaid Miss MacKenzie may marry again, at which time such payment shall cease.Mr.Fraser agrees also to provide a bride portion for each of Miss MacKenzies daughters, of an additional three hundred pounds, and as a final provision, agrees not to pursue a prosecution against Miss MacKenzie for assault with intent to commit murder.In return, Miss MacKenzie acquits Mr.Fraser of any and all other claims.This is in accordance with your understanding and consent, Mr.Fraser?He quirked a brow at Jamie.Aye, it is, Jamie said.He was pale from sitting up too long, and there was a fine dew of sweat at his hairline, but he sat straight and tall, the child still asleep in his lap, thumb firmly embedded in her mouth.Excellent, Ned said again.He rose, beaming, and bowed to the company.As our friend Dr.John Arbuthnot says, Law is a bottomless pit.But not more so at the moment than my stomach.Is that delectable aroma indicative of a saddle of mutton in our vicinity, Mrs.Jenny?At table, I sat to one side of Jamie, Hobart MacKenzie to the other, now looking pink and relaxed.Mary MacNab brought in the joint, and by ancient custom, set it down in front of Jamie.Her gaze lingered on him a moment too long.He picked up the long, wicked carving knife with his good hand and offered it politely to Hobart.Will ye have a go at it, Hobart?he said.Och, no, Hobart said, waving it away.Better let your wife carve it.Im no hand wi a knifelikely cut my finger off instead.You know me, Jamie, he said comfortably.Jamie gave his erstwhile brother in law a long look over the saltcellar.Once I would ha thought, so, Hobart, he said.Pass me the whisky, aye?The thing to do is to get her married at once, Jenny declared.The children and grandchildren had all retired, and Ned and Hobart had departed for Kinwallis, leaving the four of us to take stock over brandy and cream cakes in the lairds study.Jamie turned to his sister.The matchmakings more in your line, aye?he said, with a noticeable edge to his voice.I expect you can think of a suitable man or two for the job, if ye put your mind to it?I expect I can, she said, matching his edge with one of her own.She was embroidering; the needle stabbed through the linen fabric, flashing in the lamplight.It had begun to sleet heavily outside, but the study was cozy, with a small fire on the hearth and the pool of lamplight spilling warmth over the battered desk and its burden of books and ledgers.Theres the one thing about it, she said, eyes on her work.Where dye mean to get twelve hundred pounds, Jamie?I had been wondering that myself.The insurance settlement on the printshop had fallen far short of that amount, and I doubted that Jamies share of the smuggling proceeds amounted to anything near that magnitude.Certainly Lallybroch itself could not supply the money; survival in the Highlands was a chancy business, and even several good years in a row would provide only the barest surplus.Well, theres only the one place, isnt there?Ian looked from his sister to his brother in law and back.After a short silence, Jamie nodded.I suppose so, he said reluctantly.He glanced at the window, where the rain was slashing across the glass in slanting streaks.A vicious time of year for it, though.Ian shrugged, and sat forward a bit in his chair.The spring tide will be in a week.Jamie frowned, looking troubled.Aye, thats so, but  Theres no one has a better right to it, Jamie, Ian said.He reached out and squeezed his friends good arm, smiling.It was meant for Prince Charles followers, aye?And ye were one of those, whether ye wanted to be or no.Jamie gave him back a rueful half smile.Aye, I suppose thats true.He sighed.In any case, its the only thing I can see to do.He glanced back and forth between Ian and Jenny, evidently debating whether to add something else.His sister knew him even better than I did.She lifted her head from her work and looked at him sharply.What is it, Jamie?she said.He took a deep breath.I want to take Young Ian, he said.No, she said instantly.The needle had stopped, stuck halfway through a brilliant red bud in the pattern, the color of blood against the white smock.Hes old enough, Jenny, Jamie said quietly.Hes not!she objected.Hes but barely fifteen; Michael and Jamie were both sixteen at least, and better grown.Aye, but wee Ians a better swimmer than either of his brothers, Ian said judiciously.His forehead was furrowed with thought.It will have to be one of the lads, after all, he pointed out to Jenny.He jerked his head toward Jamie, cradling his arm in its sling.Jamie canna very well be swimming himself, in his present condition.Or Claire, for that matter, he added, with a smile at me.Swim?I said, utterly bewildered.Swim where?Ian looked taken aback for a moment; then he glanced at Jamie, brows lifted.Oh.Ye hadna told her?Jamie shook his head.I had, but not all of it.He turned to me.Its the treasure, Sassenachthe seals gold.Unable to take the treasure with him, he had concealed it in its place and returned to Ardsmuir.I didna ken what best to do about it, he explained.Duncan Kerr gave the care of it to me, but I had no notion who it belonged to, or who put it there, or what I was to do with it.The white witch was all Duncan said, and that meant nothing to me but you, Sassenach.Reluctant to make use of the treasure himself, and yet feeling that someone should know about it, lest he die in prison, he had sent a carefully coded letter to Jenny and Ian at Lallybroch, giving the location of the cache, and the use for which it hadpresumablybeen meant.Times had been hard for Jacobites then, sometimes even more so for those who had escaped to Franceleaving lands and fortunes behindthan for those who remained to face English persecution in the Highlands.At about the same time, Lallybroch had experienced two bad crops in a row, and letters had reached them from France, asking for any help possible to succor erstwhile companions there, in danger of starvation.We had nothing to send; in fact, we were damn close to starving here, Ian explained.I sent word to Jamie, and he said as he thought perhaps it wouldna be wrong to use a small bit of the treasure to help feed Prince Tearlachs followers.It seemed likely it was put there by one of the Stuarts supporters, Jamie chimed in.He cocked a ruddy brow at me, and his mouth quirked up at one corner.I thought I wouldna send it to Prince Charles, though.Good thinking, I said dryly.Any money given to Charles Stuart would have been wasted, squandered within weeks, and anyone who had known Charles intimately, as Jamie had, would know that very well.Ian had taken his eldest son, Jamie, and made his way across Scotland to the seals cove near Coigach.Fearful of any word of the treasure getting out, they had not sought a fishermans boat, but instead Young Jamie had swum to the seals rock as his uncle had several years before.He had found the treasure in its place, abstracted two gold coins and three of the smaller gemstones, and secreting these in a bag tied securely round his neck, had replaced the rest of the treasure and made his way back through the surf, arriving exhausted.They had made their way to Inverness then, and taken ship to France, where their cousin Jared Fraser, a successful expatriate wine merchant, had helped them to change the coins and jewels discreetly into cash, and taken the responsibility of distributing it among the Jacobites in need.Three times since, Ian had made the laborious trip to the coast with one of his sons, each time to abstract a small part of the hidden fortune to supply a need.Twice the money had gone to friends in need in France; once it had been needed to purchase fresh planting stock for Lallybroch and provide the food to see its tenants through a long winter when the potato crop failed.Only Jenny, Ian, and the two elder boys, Jamie and Michael, knew of the treasure.Ians wooden leg prevented his swimming to the seals island, so one of his sons must always make the trip with him.I gathered that it had been something of a rite of passage for both Young Jamie and Michael, entrusted with such a great secret.Now it might be Young Ians turn.No, Jenny said again, but I thought her heart wasnt in it.Ian was already nodding thoughtfully.Would ye take him with ye to France, too, Jamie?Jamie nodded.Aye, thats the thing.I shall have to leave Lallybroch, and stay away for a good bit, for Laoghaires sakeI canna be living here with you, under her nose, he said apologetically to me, at least not until shes suitably wed to someone else.He switched his attention back to Ian.I havena told ye everything thats happened in Edinburgh, Ian, but all things considered, I think it likely best I stay away from there for a time, too.I sat quiet, trying to digest this news.I hadnt realized that Jamie meant to leave Lallybrochleave Scotland altogether, it sounded like.So what dye mean to do, Jamie?Jenny had given up any pretense of sewing, and sat with her hands in her lap.He rubbed his nose, looking tired.This was the first day he had been up; I privately thought he should have been back in bed hours ago, but he had insisted upon staying up to preside over dinner and visit with everyone.Well, he said slowly, Jareds offered more than once to take me into his firm.Perhaps I shall stay in France, at least for a year.I was thinking Young Ian could go with us, and be schooled in Paris.Jenny and Ian exchanged a long look, one of those in which long married couples are capable of carrying out complete conversations in the space of a few heartbeats.At last, Jenny tilted her head a bit to one side.Ian smiled and took her hand.Itll be all right, mo nighean dubh, he said to her in a low, tender voice.Then he turned to Jamie.Aye, take him.Itll be a great chance for the lad.Youre sure?Jamie hesitated, speaking to his sister, rather than Ian.Jenny nodded.Her blue eyes glistened in the lamplight, and the end of her nose was slightly red.I suppose its best we give him his freedom while he still thinks its ours to give, she said.She looked at Jamie, then at me, straight and steady.But youll take good care of him, aye?39  LOST, AND BY THE WIND GRIEVED  This part of Scotland was as unlike the leafy glens and lochs near Lallybroch as the North Yorkshire moors.Here there were virtually no trees; only long sweeps of rock strewn heather, rising into crags that touched the lowering sky and disappeared abruptly into curtains of mist.As we got nearer to the seacoast, the mist became heavier, setting in earlier in the afternoon, lingering longer in the morning, so that only for a couple of hours in the middle of the day did we have anything like clear riding.The going was consequently slow, but none of us minded greatly, except Young Ian, who was beside himself with excitement, impatient to arrive.How far is it from the shore to the seals island?he asked Jamie for the tenth time.A quarter mile, I make it, his uncle replied.I can swim that far, Young Ian repeated, for the tenth time.His hands were clenched tightly on the reins, and his bony jaw set with determination.Aye, I know ye can, Jamie assured him patiently.He glanced at me, the hint of a smile hidden in the corner of his mouth.Ye willna need to, though; just swim straight for the island, and the current will carry ye.The boy nodded, and lapsed into silence, but his eyes were bright with anticipation.The headland above the cove was mist shrouded and deserted.Our voices echoed oddly in the fog, and we soon stopped talking, out of an abiding sense of eeriness.I could hear the seals barking far below, the sound wavering and mixing with the crash of the surf, so that now and then it sounded like sailors hallooing to one another over the sound of the sea.Jamie pointed out the rock chimney of Ellens tower to Young Ian, and taking a coil of rope from his saddle, picked his way over the broken rock of the headland to the entrance.Keep your shirt on til youre down, he told the lad, shouting to be heard above the wave.Else the rock will tear your back to shreds.Ian nodded understanding, then, the rope tied securely round his middle, gave me a nervous grin, took two jerky steps, and disappeared into the earth.Jamie had the other end of the rope wrapped round his own waist, paying out the length of it carefully with his sound hand as the boy descended.Crawling on hands and knees, I made my way over the short turf and pebbles to the crumbling edge of the cliff, where I could look over to the half moon beach below.It seemed a very long time, but finally I saw Ian emerge from the bottom of the chimney, a small, antlike figure.He untied his rope, peered around, spotted us at the top of the cliff, and waved enthusiastically.I waved back, but Jamie merely muttered, All right, get on, then, under his breath.I could feel him tense beside me as the boy stripped off to his breeks and scrambled down the rocks to the water, and I felt his flinch as the small figure dived headlong into the gray blue waves.Brrr!I said, watching.The water must be freezing!It is, Jamie said with feeling.Ians right; its a vicious time of year to be swimming.His face was pale and set.I didnt think it was the result of discomfort from his wounded arm, though the long ride and the exercise with the rope couldnt have done it any good.While he had shown nothing but encouraging confidence while Ian was making his descent, he wasnt making any effort to hide his worry now.The fact was that there was no way for us to reach Ian, should anything go wrong.Maybe we should have waited for the mist to lift, I said, more to distract him than because I thought so.If we had til next Easter, we might, he agreed ironically.Though Ill grant ye, Ive seen it clearer than this, he added, squinting into the swirling murk below.The three islands were only intermittently visible from the cliff as the fog swept across them.I had been able to see the bobbing dot of Ians head for the first twenty yards as he left the shore, but now he had disappeared into the mist.Do you think hes all right?Jamie bent to help me scramble upright.The cloth of his coat was damp and rough under my fingers, soaked with mist and the fine droplets of ocean spray.Aye, hell do.Hes a bonny swimmer; and its none so difficult a swim, either, once hes into the current.Still, he stared into the mist as though sheer effort could pierce its veils.On Jamies advice, Young Ian had timed his descent to begin when the tide began to go out, so as to have as much assistance as possible from the tide race.Looking over the edge, I could see a floating mass of bladder wrack, half stranded on the widening strip of beach.Perhaps two hours before he comes back.Jamie answered my unspoken question.He turned reluctantly from his vain perusal of the mist hidden cove.Damn, I wish Id gone myself, arm or no arm.Both Young Jamie and Michael have done it, I reminded him.He gave me a rueful smile.Oh, aye.Ian will do fine.Its only that its a good deal easier to do something thats a bit dangerous than it is to wait and worry while someone else does it.Ha, I told him.So now you know whats it like being married to you.He laughed.Oh, aye, I suppose so.Besides, it would be a shame to cheat Young Ian of his adventure.Come on, then, lets get out of the wind.We moved inland a bit, away from the crumbling edge of the cliff, and sat down to wait, using the horses bodies as shelter.Rough, shaggy Highland ponies, they appeared unmoved by the unpleasant weather, merely standing together, heads down, tails turned against the wind.The wind was too high for easy conversation.We sat quietly, leaning together like the horses, with our backs to the windy shore.Whats that?Jamie raised his head, listening.What?I thought I heard shouting.I expect its the seals, I said, but before the words were out of my mouth, he was up and striding toward the cliffs edge.The cove was still full of curling mist, but the wind had uncovered the seals island, and it was clearly visible, at least for the moment.There were no seals on it now, though.A small boat was drawn up on a sloping rock shelf at one side of the island.Not a fishermans boat; this one was longer and more pointed at the prow, with one set of oars.As I stared, a man appeared from the center of the island.He carried something under one arm, the size and shape of the box Jamie had described.I didnt have long to speculate as to the nature of this object, though, for just then a second man came up the far slope of the island and into sight.This one was carrying Young Ian.He had the boys half naked body slung carelessly over one shoulder.It swung head down, arms dangling with a limpness that made it clear the boy was unconscious or dead.Ian!Jamies hand clamped over my mouth before I could shout again.Hush!He dragged me to my knees to keep me out of sight.We watched, helpless, as the second man heaved Ian carelessly into the boat, then took hold of the gunwales to run it back into the water.There wasnt a chance of making the descent down the chimney and the swim to the island before they succeeded in making their escape.But escape to where?Where did they come from?I gasped.Nothing else stirred in the cove below, save the mist and the shifting kelp beds, turning in the tide.A ship.Its a ships boat.Jamie added something low and heartfelt in Gaelic, and then was gone.I turned to see him fling himself on one of the horses and wrench its head around.Then he was off, riding hell for leather across the headland, away from the cove.Rough as the footing across the headland was, the horses were shod for it better than I was.I hastily mounted and followed Jamie, a high pitched whinny of protest from Ians hobbled mount ringing in my ears.It was less than a quarter of a mile to the ocean side of the headland, but it seemed to take forever to reach it.I saw Jamie ahead of me, his hair flying loose in the wind, and beyond him, the ship, lying to offshore.The ground broke away in a tumble of rock that fell down to the ocean, not so steep as the cliffs of the cove, but much too rough to take a horse down.By the time I had reined up, Jamie was off his horse, and picking his way down the rubble toward the water.To the left, I could see the longboat from the island, pulling round the curve of the headland.Someone on the ship must have been looking out for them, for I heard a faint hail from the direction of the ship, and saw small figures suddenly appear in the rigging.One of these must also have seen us, for there was a sudden agitation aboard, with heads popping up above the rail and more yelling.The ship was blue, with a broad black band painted all around it.There was a line of gunports set in this band, and as I watched, the forward one opened, and the round black eye of the gun peeked out.Jamie!I shrieked, as loudly as I could.He looked up from the rocks at his feet, saw where I was pointing, and hurled himself flat in the rubble as the gun went off.The report wasnt terribly loud, but there was a sort of whistling noise past my head that made me duck instinctively.Several of the rocks around me exploded in puffs of flying rock chips, and it occurred to me, rather belatedly, that the horses and I were a great deal more visible there at the top of the headland than Jamie was on the cliff below.The horses, having grasped this essential fact long before I did, were on their way back to where we had left their hobbled fellow well before the dust had settled.I flung myself bodily over the edge of the headland, slid several feet in a shower of gravel, and wedged myself into a deep crevice in the cliff.There was another explosion somewhere above my head, and I pressed myself even closer into the rock.Evidently the people on board the ship were satisfied with the effect of their last shot, for relative silence now descended.My heart was hammering against my ribs, and the air around my face was full of a fine gray dust that gave me an irresistible urge to cough.I risked a look over my shoulder, and was in time to see the longboat being hoisted aboard ship.Of Ian and his two captors, there was no sign.The gunport closed silently as I watched, and the rope that held the anchor slithered up, streaming water.The ship turned slowly, seeking wind.The air was light and the sails barely puffed, but even that was enough.Slowly, then faster, she was moving toward the open sea.By the time Jamie had reached my roosting place, the ship had all but vanished in the thick cloudbank that obscured the horizon.Jesus was all he said when he reached me, but he clutched me hard for a moment.Jesus.He let go then, and turned to look out over the sea.Nothing moved save a few tendrils of slow floating mist.The whole world seemed stricken with silence; even the occasional cries of the murres and shearwaters had been cut off by the cannons boom.The gray rock near my foot showed a fresh patch of lighter gray, where shot had struck off a wide flake of stone.It was no more than three feet above the crevice where I had taken refuge.What shall we do?I felt numbed, both by the shock of the afternoon, and by the sheer enormity of what had happened.Impossible to believe that in less than an hour, Ian had disappeared from us as completely as though he had been wiped off the face of the earth.The fogbank loomed thick and impenetrable, a little way off the coast before us, a barrier as impassible as the curtain between earth and the underworld.My mind kept replaying images: the mist, drifting over the outlines of the silkies island, the sudden appearance of the boat, the men coming over the rocks, Ians lanky, teenaged body, white skinned as the mist, skinny limbs dangling like a disjointed dolls.I had seen everything with that clarity that attends tragedy; every detail fixed in my minds eye, to be shown again and again, always with that half conscious feeling that this time, I should be able to alter it.Jamies face was set in rigid lines, the furrows cut deep from nose to mouth.I dont know, he said.Damn me to hell, I dont know what to do!His hands flexed suddenly into fists at his sides.He shut his eyes, breathing heavily.I felt even more frightened at this admission.In the brief time I had been back with him, I had grown once more accustomed to having Jamie always know what to do, even in the direst circumstances.This confession seemed more upsetting than anything that had yet happened.A sense of helplessness swirled round me like the mist.Every nerve cried out to do something.But what?I saw the streak of blood on his cuff, then; he had gashed his hand, climbing down the rocks.That, I could help, and I felt a sense of thankfulness that there was, after all, one thing I could do, however small.Youve cut yourself, I said.I touched his injured hand.Let me see; Ill wrap it for you.No, he said.He turned away, face strained, still looking desperately out into the fog.When I reached for him again, he jerked away.No, I said!Leave it be!I swallowed hard and wrapped my arms about myself under my cloak.There was little wind now, even on the headland, but it was cold and clammy nonetheless.He rubbed his hand carelessly against the front of his coat, leaving a rusty smear.He was still staring out to sea, toward the spot where the ship had vanished.He closed his eyes, and pressed his lips tight together.Then he opened them, made a small gesture of apology toward me, and turned toward the headland.I suppose we must catch the horses, he said quietly.Come on.We walked back across the thick, short turf and strewn rocks without speaking, silent with shock and grief.I could see the horses, small stick legged figures in the distance, clustered together with their hobbled companion.It seemed to have taken hours to run from the headland to the outer shore; going back seemed much longer.I dont think he was dead, I said, after what seemed like a year.I laid a hand tentatively on Jamies arm, meaning to be comforting, but he wouldnt have noticed if I had struck him with a blackjack.He walked on slowly, head down.No, he said, and I saw him swallow hard.No, he wasnt dead, or theyd not have taken him.Did they take him aboard the ship?I pressed.Did you see them?I thought it might be better for him if he would talk.He nodded.Aye, they passed him aboard; I saw it clear.I suppose thats some hope, he muttered, as though to himself.If they didna knock him on the head at once, maybe they wont.Suddenly remembering that I was there, he turned and looked at me, eyes searching my face.Youre all right, Sassenach?I was scraped raw in several places, covered with filth, and shaky kneed with fright, but basically sound.Im fine.I put my hand on his arm again.This time he let it stay.Thats good, he said softly, after a moment.He tucked my hand into the crook of his elbow, and we went on.Have you any idea who they were?I had to raise my voice slightly to be heard above the wash of the surf behind us, but I wanted to keep him talking if I could.He shook his head, frowning.The effort of talking seemed to be bringing him slowly out of his own shock.I heard one of the sailors shout to the men in the boat, and he spoke in French.But that proves nothingsailors come from everywhere.Still, I have seen enough of ships at the docks to think that this one didna have quite the look of a merchantnor the look of an English ship at all, he added, though I couldna say why, exactly.The way the sails were rigged, maybe.It was blue, with a black line painted round it, I said.That was all I had time to see, before the guns started firing.Was it possible to trace a ship?The germ of the idea gave me hope; perhaps the situation was not so hopeless as I had first thought.If Ian was not dead, and we could find out where the ship was going  Did you see a name on it?I asked.A name?He looked faintly surprised at the notion.What, on the ship?Do ships not usually have their names painted on the sides?I asked.No, what for?He sounded honestly puzzled.So you could bloody tell who they are!I said, exasperated.Taken by surprise by my tone, he actually smiled a little.Aye, well, I should expect that perhaps they dinna much want anyone telling who they are, given their business, he said dryly.We paced on together for a few moments, thinking.Then I said curiously, Well, but how do legitimate ships tell who each other is, if they havent got names painted on?He glanced at me, one eyebrow raised.I should know you from another woman, he pointed out, and ye havena got your name stitched upon your bosom.Not so much as a letter A, I said, flippantly, but seeing his blank look, added, You mean ships look different enoughand there are few enough of themthat you can tell one from another just by looking?Not me, he said honestly.I know a few; ships where I ken the captain, and have been aboard to do business, or a few like the packet boats, that go back and forth so often that Ive seen them in port dozens of times.But a sailing man would ken a great deal more.Then it might be possible to find out what the ship that took Ian is called?He nodded, looking at me curiously.Aye, I think so.I have been trying to call to mind everything about it as we walked, so as to tell Jared.Hell know a great many ships, and a great many more captainsand perhaps one of them will know a blue ship, wide in the beam, with three masts, twelve guns, and a scowling figurehead.My heart bounded upward.So you do have a plan!I wouldna call it so much a plan, he said.Its only I canna think of anything else to do.He shrugged, and wiped a hand over his face.Tiny droplets of moisture were condensing on us as we walked, glistening in the ruddy hairs of his eyebrows and coating his cheeks with a wetness like tears.He sighed.The passage is arranged from Inverness.The best I can see to do is to go; Jared will be expecting us in Le Havre.When we see him, perhaps he can help us to find out what the blue ship is called, and maybe where its bound.Aye, he said dryly, anticipating my question, ships have home ports, and if they dinna belong to the navy, they have runs they commonly make, and papers for the harbormaster, too, showing where theyre bound.I began to feel better than I had since Ian had descended Ellens tower.If theyre not pirates or privateers, that is, he added, with a warning look which put an immediate damper on my rising spirits.And if they are?Then God knows, but I dont, he said briefly, and would not say any more until we reached the horses.They were grazing on the headland near the tower where we had left Ians mount, behaving as though nothing had happened, pretending to find the tough sea grass delicious.Tcha!Jamie viewed them disapprovingly.Silly beasts.He grabbed the coil of rope and wrapped it twice round a projecting stone.Handing me the end, with a terse instruction to hold it, he dropped the free end down the chimney, shed his coat and shoes, and disappeared down the rope himself without further remark.Sometime later, he came back up, sweating profusely, with a small bundle tucked under his arm.Young Ians shirt, coat, shoes and stockings, with his knife and the small leather pouch in which the lad kept such valuables as he had.Do you mean to take them home to Jenny?I asked.I tried to imagine what Jenny might think, say, or do at the news, and succeeded all too well.I felt a little sick, knowing that the hollow, aching sense of loss I felt was as nothing to what hers would be.Jamies face was flushed from the climb, but at my words, the blood drained from his cheeks.His hands tightened on the bundle.Oh, aye, he said, very softly, with great bitterness.Aye, I shall go home and tell my sister that I have lost her youngest son?She didna want him to come wi me, but I insisted.Ill take care of him, I said.And now he is hurt and maybe deadbut here are his clothes, to remember him by?His jaw clenched, and he swallowed convulsively.Id rather be dead myself, he said.He knelt on the ground then, shaking out the articles of clothing, folding them carefully, and laying them together in a pile.He folded the coat carefully around the other things, stood up, and stuffed the bundle into his saddlebag.Ian will be needing them, I expect, when we find him, I said, trying to sound convinced.Jamie looked at me, but after a moment, he nodded.Aye, he said softly.I expect he will.It was too late in the day to begin the ride to Inverness.The sun was setting, announcing the fact with a dull reddish glow that barely penetrated the gathering mist.Without speaking, we began to make camp.There was cold food in the saddlebags, but neither of us had the heart to eat.Instead, we rolled ourselves up in cloaks and blankets and lay down to sleep, cradled in small hollows that Jamie had scooped in the earth.I couldnt sleep.The ground was hard and stony beneath my hips and shoulders, and the thunder of the surf below would have been sufficient to keep me awake, even had my mind not been filled with thoughts of Ian.Was he badly hurt?The limpness of his body had bespoken some damage, but I had seen no blood.Presumably, he had merely been hit on the head.If so, what would he feel when he woke, to find himself abducted, and being carried farther from home and family with each passing minute?And how were we ever to find him?When Jamie had first mentioned Jared, I had felt hopeful, but the more I thought of it, the slimmer seemed the prospects of actually finding a single ship, which might now be sailing in any direction at all, to anyplace in the world.And would his captors bother to keep Ian, or would they, on second thoughts, conclude that he was a dangerous nuisance, and pitch him overboard?I didnt think I slept, but I must have dozed, my dreams full of trouble.I woke shivering with cold, and edged out a hand, reaching for Jamie.He wasnt there.When I sat up, I found that he had spread his blanket over me while I dozed, but it was a poor substitute for the heat of his body.He was sitting some distance away, with his back to me.The offshore wind had risen with the setting of the sun, and blown some of the mist away; a half moon shed enough light through the clouds to show me his hunched figure clearly.I got up and walked over to him, folding my cloak tight about me against the chill.My steps made a light crunching sound on the crumbled granite, but the sound was drowned in the sighing rumble of the sea below.Still, he must have heard me; he didnt turn around, but gave no sign of surprise when I sank down beside him.He sat with his chin in his hands, his elbows on his knees, eyes wide and sightless as he gazed out into the dark water of the cove.If the seals were awake, they were quiet tonight.Are you all right?I said quietly.Its beastly cold.He was wearing nothing but his coat, and in the small, chilled hours of the night, in the wet, cold air above the sea, that was far from enough.I could feel the tiny, constant shiver that ran through him when I set my hand on his arm.Aye, Im fine, he said, with a marked lack of conviction.I merely snorted at this piece of prevarication, and sat down next to him on another chunk of granite.It wasnt your fault, I said, after we had sat in silence for some time, listening to the sea.Ye should go and sleep, Sassenach.His voice was even, but with an undertone of hopelessness that made me move closer to him, trying to embrace him.He was clearly reluctant to touch me, but I was shivering very obviously myself by this time.Im not going anywhere.He sighed deeply and pulled me closer, settling me upon his knee, so that his arms came inside my cloak, holding tight.Little by little, the shivering eased.What are you doing out here?I asked at last.Praying, he said softly.Or trying to.I shouldnt have interrupted you.I made as though to move away, but his hold on me tightened.No, stay, he said.We stayed clasped close; I could feel the warmth of his breathing in my ear.He drew in his breath as though about to speak, but then let it out without saying anything.I turned and touched his face.What is it, Jamie?Is it wrong for me to have ye?he whispered.His face was bone white, his eyes no more than dark pits in the dim light.I keep thinkingis it my fault?Have I sinned so greatly, wanting you so much, needing ye more than life itself?Do you?I took his face between my hands, feeling the wide bones cold under my palms.And if you dohow can that be wrong?Im your wife.In spite of everything, the simple word wife made my heart lighten.He turned his face slightly, so his lips lay against my palm, and his hand came up, groping for mine.His fingers were cold, too, and hard as driftwood soaked in seawater.I tell myself so.God has given ye to me; how can I not love you?And yetI keep thinking, and canna stop.He looked down at me then, brow furrowed with trouble.The treasureit was all right to use it when there was need, to feed the hungry, or to rescue folk from prison.But to try to buy my freedom from guiltto use it only so that I might live free at Lallybroch with you, and not trouble myself over LaoghaireI think maybe that was wrong to do.I drew his hand down around my waist, and pulled him close.He came, eager for comfort, and laid his head on my shoulder.Hush, I said to him, though he hadnt spoken again.Be still.Jamie, have you ever done something for yourself alonenot with any thought of anyone else?His hand rested gently on my back, tracing the seam of my bodice, and his breathing held the hint of a smile.Oh, many and many a time, he whispered.When I saw you.When I took ye, not caring did ye want me or no, did ye have somewhere else to be, someone else to love.Bloody man, I whispered in his ear, rocking him as best I could.Youre an awful fool, Jamie Fraser.And what about Brianna?That wasnt wrong, was it?No.He swallowed; I could hear the sound of it clearly, and feel the pulse beat in his neck where I held him.But now I have taken ye back from her, as well.I love youand I love Ian, like he was my own.And I am thinking maybe I cannot have ye both.Jamie Fraser, I said again, with as much conviction as I could put into my voice, youre a terrible fool.I smoothed the hair back from his forehead and twisted my fist in the thick tail at his nape, pulling his head back to make him look at me.I thought my face must look to him as his did to me; the bleached bones of a skull, with the lips and eyes dark as blood.You didnt force me to come to you, or snatch me away from Brianna.I came, because I wanted tobecause I wanted you, as much as you did meand my being here has nothing to do with whats happened.Were married, blast you, by any standard you care to namebefore God, man, Neptune, or what have you.Neptune?he said, sounding a little stunned.Be quiet, I said.Were married, I say, and it isnt wicked for you to want me, or to have me, and no God worth his salt would take your nephew away from you because you wanted to be happy.So there!Besides, I added, pulling back and looking up at him a moment later, Im not bloody going back, so what could you do about it, anyway?The small vibration in his chest this time was laughter, not cold.Take ye and be damned for it, I expect, he said.He kissed my forehead gently.Loving you has put me through hell more than once, Sassenach; Ill risk it again, if need be.Bah, I said.And you think loving yous been a bed of roses, do you?This time he laughed out loud.No, he said, but youll maybe keep doing it?Maybe I will, at that.Youre a verra stubborn woman, he said, the smile clear in his voice.It bloody takes one to know one, I said, and then we were both quiet for quite some time.It was very lateperhaps four oclock in the morning.The half moon was low in the sky, seen only now and then through the moving clouds.The clouds themselves were moving faster; the wind was shifting and the mist breaking up, in the turning hour between dark and dawn.Somewhere below, one of the seals barked loudly, once.Do ye think perhaps ye could stand to go now?Jamie said suddenly.Not wait for the daylight?Once off the headland, the goings none so bad that the horses canna manage in the dark.My whole body ached from weariness, and I was starving, but I stood up at once, and brushed the hair out of my face.Lets go, I said.PART EIGHT    On the Water   40  I SHALL GO DOWN TO THE SEA  It will have to be the Artemis.Jared flipped shut the cover of his portable writing desk and rubbed his brow, frowning.Jamies cousin had been in his fifties when I knew him before, and was now well past seventy, but the snub nosed hatchet face, the spare, narrow frame, and the tireless capacity for work were just the same.Only his hair marked his age, gone from lank darkness to a scanty, pure and gleaming white, jauntily tied with a red silk ribbon.Shes no more than a midsized sloop, with a crew of forty or so, he remarked.But its late in the season, and well not likely do betterall of the Indiamen will have gone a month since.Artemis would have gone with the convoy to Jamaica, was she not laid up for repair.Id sooner have a ship of yoursand one of your captains, Jamie assured him.The size doesna matter.Jared cocked a skeptical eyebrow at his cousin.Oh?Well, and ye may find it matter more than ye think, out at sea.Its like to be squally, this late in the season, and a sloop will be bobbin like a cork.Might I ask how ye weathered the Channel crossing in the packet boat, cousin?Jamies face, already drawn and grim, grew somewhat grimmer at this question.The completest of landlubbers, he was not just prone to seasickness, but prostrated by it.He had been violently ill all the way from Inverness to Le Havre, though sea and weather had been quite calm.Now, some six hours later, safe ashore in Jareds warehouse by the quay, there was still a pale tinge to his lips and dark circles beneath his eyes.Ill manage, he said shortly.Jared eyed him dubiously, well aware of his response to seagoing craft of any kind.Jamie could scarcely set foot on a ship at anchor without going green; the prospect of his crossing the Atlantic, sealed inescapably in a small and constantly tossing ship for two or three months, was enough to boggle the stoutest mind.It had been troubling mine for some time.Well, I suppose theres no help for it, Jared said with a sigh, echoing my thought.And at least youll have a physician to hand, he added, with a smile at me.That is, I suppose you intend accompanying him, my dear?Yes indeed, I assured him.How long will it be before the ship is ready?Id like to find a good apothecarys, to stock my medicine chest before the voyage.Jared pursed his lips in concentration.A week, God willing, he said.Artemis is in Bilbao at the moment; shes to carry a cargo of tanned Spanish hides, with a load of copper from Italyshell ship that here, once she arrives, which should be day after tomorrow, with a fair wind.Ive no captain signed on for the voyage yet, but a good man in mind; I may have to go to Paris to fetch him, though, and that will be two days there and two back.Add a day to complete stores, fill the water casks, add all the bits and pieces, and she should be ready to leave at dawn tomorrow week.How long to the West Indies?Jamie asked.The tension in him showed in the lines of his body, little affected either by our journey or by the brief rest.He was strung taut as a bow, and likely to remain so until we had found Young Ian.Two months, in the season, Jared replied, the small frown still lining his forehead.But youre a month past the season now; hit the winter gales and it could be three.Or more.Or never, but Jared, ex seaman that he was, was too superstitiousor too tactfulto voice this possibility.Still, I saw him touch the wood of his desk surreptitiously for luck.Neither would he voice the other thought that occupied my mind; we had no positive proof that the blue ship was headed for the West Indies.We had only the records Jared had obtained for us from the Le Havre harbormaster, showing two visits by the shipaptly named Brujawithin the last five years, each time giving her home port as Bridgetown, on the island of Barbados.Tell me about her againthe ship that took Young Ian, Jared said.How did she ride?High in the water, or sunk low, as if she were loaded heavy for a voyage?Jamie closed his eyes for a moment, concentrating, then opened them with a nod.Heavy laden, I could swear it.Her gunports were no more than six feet from the water.Jared nodded, satisfied.Then she was leaving port, not coming in.Ive messengers out to all the major ports in France, Portugal and Spain.With luck, theyll find the port she shipped from, and then well know her destination for sure from her papers.His thin lips quirked suddenly downward.Unless shes turned pirate, and sailing under false papers, that is.The old wine merchant carefully set aside the lap desk, its carved mahogany richly darkened by years of use, and rose to his feet, moving stiffly.Well, thats the most that can be done for the moment.Lets go to the house, now; Mathilde will have supper waiting.Tomorrow Ill take ye over the manifests and orders, and your wife can find her bits of herbs.It was nearly five oclock, and full dark at this time of year, but Jared had two linksmen waiting to escort us the short distance to his house, equipped with torches to light the way and armed with stout clubs.Le Havre was a thriving port city, and the quay district was no place to walk alone after dark, particularly if one was known as a prosperous wine merchant.Despite the exhaustion of the Channel crossing, the oppressive clamminess and pervasive fish smell of Le Havre, and a gnawing hunger, I felt my spirits rise as we followed the torches through the dark, narrow streets.Thanks to Jared, we had at least a chance of finding Young Ian.Jared had concurred with Jamies opinion that if the pirates of the Brujafor so I thought of themhad not killed Young Ian on the spot, they were likely to keep him unharmed.A healthy young male of any race could be sold as a slave or indentured servant in the West Indies for upward of two hundred pounds; a respectable sum by current standards.If they did intend so to dispose of Young Ian profitably, and if we knew the port to which they were sailing, it should be a reasonably easy matter to find and recover the boy.A gust of wind and a few chilly drops from the hovering clouds dampened my optimism slightly, reminding me that while it might be no great matter to find Ian once we had reached the West Indies, both the Bruja and the Artemis had to reach the islands first.And the winter storms were beginning.The rain increased through the night, drumming insistently on the slate roof above our heads.I would normally have found the sound soothing and soporific; under the circumstances, the low thrum seemed threatening, not peaceful.Despite Jareds substantial dinner and the excellent wines that accompanied it, I found myself unable to sleep, my mind summoning images of rain soaked canvas and the swell of heavy seas.At least my morbid imaginings were keeping only myself awake; Jamie had not come up with me but had stayed to talk with Jared about the arrangements for the upcoming voyage.Jared was willing to risk a ship and a captain to help in the search.In return, Jamie would sail as supercargo.As what?I had said, hearing this proposal.The supercargo, Jared had explained patiently.Thats the man whose duty it is to oversee the loading, the unloading, and the sale and disposition of the cargo.The captain and the crew merely sail the ship; someones got to look after the contents.In a case where the welfare of the cargo will be affected, the supercargos orders may override even the captains authority.And so it was arranged.While Jared was more than willing to go to some risk in order to help a kinsman, he saw no reason not to profit from the arrangement.He had therefore made quick provision for a miscellaneous cargo to be loaded from Bilbao and Le Havre; we would sail to Jamaica to upload the bulk of it, and would arrange for the reloading of the Artemis with rum produced by the sugarcane plantation of Fraser et Cie on Jamaica, for the return trip.The return trip, however, would not occur until good sailing weather returned, in late April or early May.For the time between arrival on Jamaica in February and return to Scotland in May, Jamie would have disposal of the Artemis and her crew, to travel to Barbadosor other placesin search of Young Ian.Three months.I hoped it would be enough.It was a generous arrangement.Still, Jared, who had been an expatriate wine seller for many years in France, was wealthy enough that the loss of a ship, while distressing, would not cripple him.The fact did not escape me that while Jared was risking a small portion of his fortune, we were risking our lives.The wind seemed to be dying; it no longer howled down the chimney with quite such force.Sleep proving still elusive, I got out of bed, and with a quilt wrapped round my shoulders for warmth, went to the window.The sky was a deep, mottled gray, the scudding rain clouds edged with brilliant light from the moon that hid behind them, and the glass was streaked with rain.Still, enough light seeped through the clouds for me to make out the masts of the ships moored at the quay, less than a quarter of a mile away.They swayed to and fro, their sails furled tight against the storm, rising and falling in uneasy rhythm as the waves rocked the boats at anchor.In a weeks time, I would be on one.I had not dared to think what life might be like once I had found Jamie, lest I not find him after all.Then I had found him, and in quick succession, had contemplated life as a printers wife among the political and literary worlds of Edinburgh, a dangerous and fugitive existence as a smugglers lady, and finally, the busy, settled life of a Highland farm, which I had known before and loved.Now, in equally quick succession, all these possibilities had been jerked away, and I faced an unknown future once more.Oddly enough, I was not so much distressed by this as excited by it.I had been settled for twenty years, rooted as a barnacle by my attachments to Brianna, to Frank, to my patients.Now fateand my own actionshad ripped me loose from all those things, and I felt as though I were tumbling free in the surf, at the mercy of forces a great deal stronger than myself.My breath had misted the glass.I traced a small heart in the cloudiness, as I had used to do for Brianna on cold mornings.Then, I would put her initials inside the heartB.E. R. , for Brianna Ellen Randall.Would she still call herself Randall?I wondered, or Fraser, now?I hesitated, then drew two letters inside the outline of the hearta J and a C.   I was still standing before the window when the door opened and Jamie came in.Are ye awake still?he asked, rather unnecessarily.The rain kept me from sleeping.I went and embraced him, glad of his warm solidness to dispel the cold gloom of the night.He hugged me, resting his cheek against my hair.He smelt faintly of seasickness, much more strongly of candlewax and ink.Have you been writing?I asked.He looked down at me in astonishment.I have, but how did ye know that?You smell of ink.He smiled slightly, stepping back and running his hand through his hair.Youve a nose as keen as a truffle pigs, Sassenach.Why, thank you, what a graceful compliment, I said.What were you writing?The smile disappeared from his face, leaving him looking strained and tired.A letter to Jenny, he said.He went to the table, where he shed his coat and began to unfasten his stock and jabot.I didna want to write her until wed seen Jared, and I could tell her what plans we had, and what the prospects were for bringing Ian home safe.He grimaced, and pulled the shirt over his head.God knows what shell do when she gets itand thank God, Ill be at sea when she does, he added wryly, emerging from the folds of linen.It couldnt have been an easy piece of composition, but I thought he seemed easier for the writing of it.He sat down to take off his shoes and stockings, and I came behind him to undo the clubbed queue of his hair.Im glad the writings over, at least, he said, echoing my thought.Id been dreading telling her, more than anything else.You told her the truth?He shrugged.I always have.Except about me.I didnt voice the thought, though, but began to rub his shoulders, kneading the knotted muscles.What did Jared do with Mr.Willoughby?I asked, massage bringing the Chinese to mind.He had accompanied us on the Channel crossing, sticking to Jamie like a small blue silk shadow.Jared, used to seeing everything on the docks, had taken Mr.Willoughby in stride, bowing gravely to him and addressing him with a few words of Mandarin, but his housekeeper had viewed this unusual guest with considerably more suspicion.I believe hes gone to sleep in the stable.Jamie yawned, and stretched himself luxuriously.Mathilde said she wasna accustomed to have heathens in the house and didna mean to start now.She was sprinkling the kitchen wi holy water after he ate supper there.Glancing up, he caught sight of the heart I had traced on the windowpane, black against the misted glass, and smiled.Whats that?Just silliness, I said.He reached up and took my right hand, the ball of his thumb caressing the small scar at the base of my own thumb, the letter J he had made with the point of his knife, just before I left him, before Culloden.I didna ask, he said, whether ye wished to come with me.I could leave ye here; Jared would have ye stay wi him and welcome, here or in Paris.Or ye could go back to Lallybroch, if ye wished.No, you didnt ask, I said.Because you knew bloody well what the answer would be.We looked at each other and smiled.The lines of heartsickness and weariness had lifted from his face.The candlelight glowed softly on the burnished crown of his head as he bent and gently kissed the palm of my hand.The wind still whistled in the chimney, and the rain ran down the glass like tears outside, but it no longer mattered.Now I could sleep.The sky had cleared by morning.A brisk, cold breeze rattled the windowpanes of Jareds study, but couldnt penetrate to the cozy room inside.The house at Le Havre was much smaller than his lavish Paris residence, but still boasted three stories of solid, half timbered comfort.I pushed my feet farther toward the crackling fire, and dipped my quill into the inkwell.I was making up a list of all the things I thought might be needed in the medical way for a two month voyage.Distilled alcohol was both the most important and the easiest to obtain; Jared had promised to get me a cask in Paris.Wed best label it something else, though, hed told me.Or the sailors will have drunk it before youve left port.Purified lard, I wrote slowly, St.Johns wort; garlic, ten pounds; yarrow.I wrote borage, then shook my head and crossed it out, replacing it with the older name by which it was more likely known now, bugloss.It was slow work.At one time, I had known the medicinal uses of all the common herbs, and not a few uncommon ones.I had had to; they were all that was available.At that, many of them were surprisingly effective.Despite the skepticismand outspoken horrorof my supervisors and colleagues at the hospital in Boston, I had used them occasionally on my modern patients to good effect.(Did you see what Dr.Randall did?a shocked interns cry echoed in memory, making me smile as I wrote.She fed the stomach in 134B boiled flowers!)The fact remained that one wouldnt use yarrow and comfrey on a wound if iodine were available, nor treat a systemic infection with bladderwort in preference to penicillin.I had forgotten a lot, but as I wrote the names of the herbs, the look and the smell of each one began to come back to methe dark, bituminous look and pleasant light smell of birch oil, the sharp tang of the mint family, the dusty sweet smell of chamomile and the astringency of bistort.Across the table, Jamie was struggling with his own lists.A poor penman, he wrote laboriously with his crippled right hand, pausing now and then to rub the healing wound above his left elbow and mutter curses under his breath.Have ye lime juice on your list, Sassenach?he inquired, looking up.No.Ought I to have?He brushed a strand of hair out of his face and frowned at the sheet of paper in front of him.It depends.Customarily, it would be the ships surgeon who provides the lime juice, but in a ship the size of the Artemis, there generally isnt a surgeon, and the provision of foodstuffs falls to the purser.But there isnt a purser, either; theres no time to find a dependable man, so I shall fill that office, too.Well, if youll be purser and supercargo, I expect Ill be the closest thing to a ships surgeon, I said, smiling slightly.Ill get the lime juice.All right.We returned to a companionable scratching, unbroken until the entrance of Josephine, the parlormaid, to announce the arrival of a person.Her long nose wrinkled in unconscious disapproval at the information.He waits upon the doorstep.The butler tried to send him away, but he insists that he has an appointment with you, Monsieur James?The questioning tone of this last implied that nothing could seem more unlikely, but duty compelled her to relay the improbable suggestion.Jamies eyebrows rose.A person?What sort of person?Josephines lips primmed together as though she really could not bring herself to say.I was becoming curious to see this person, and ventured over to the window.Sticking my head far out, I could see the top of a very dusty black slouch hat on the doorstep, and not much more.He looks like a peddler; hes got a bundle of some kind on his back, I reported, craning out still farther, hands on the sill.Jamie clutched me by the waist and drew me back, thrusting his own head out in turn.Och, its the coin dealer Jared mentioned!he exclaimed.Bring him up, then.With an eloquent expression on her narrow face, Josephine departed, returning in short order with a tall, gangling youth of perhaps twenty, dressed in a badly outmoded style of coat, wide unbuckled breeches that flapped limply about his skinny shanks, drooping stockings and the cheapest of wooden sabots.The filthy black hat, courteously removed indoors, revealed a thin face with an intelligent expression, adorned with a vigorous, if scanty, brown beard.Since virtually no one in Le Havre other than a few seamen wore a beard, it hardly needed the small shiny black skullcap on the newcomers head to tell me he was a Jew.The boy bowed awkwardly to me, then to Jamie, struggling with the straps of his peddlers pack.Madame, he said, with a bob that made his curly sidelocks dance, Monsieur.It is most good of you to receive me.He spoke French oddly, with a singsong intonation that made him hard to follow.While I entirely understood Josephines reservations about thisperson, still, he had wide, guileless blue eyes that made me smile at him despite his generally unprepossessing appearance.Its we who should be grateful to you, Jamie was saying.I had not expected you to come so promptly.My cousin tells me your name is Mayer?The coin dealer nodded, a shy smile breaking out amid the sprigs of his youthful beard.Yes, Mayer.It is no trouble; I was in the city already.Yet you come from Frankfort, no?A long way, Jamie said politely.He smiled as he looked over Mayers costume, which looked as though he had retrieved it from a rubbish tip.And a dusty one, too, I expect, he added.Will you take wine?Mayer looked flustered at this offer, but after opening and closing his mouth a few times, finally settled on a silent nod of acceptance.His shyness vanished, though, once the pack was opened.Though from the outside the shapeless bundle looked as though it might contain, at best, a change of ragged linen and Mayers midday meal, once opened it revealed several small wooden racks, cleverly fitted into a framework inside the pack, each rack packed carefully with tiny leather bags, cuddling together like eggs in a nest.Mayer removed a folded square of fabric from beneath the racks, whipped it open, and spread it with something of a flourish on Jamies desk.Then one by one, Mayer opened the bags and drew out the contents, placing each gleaming round reverently on the deep blue velvet of the cloth.An Aquilia Severa aureus, he said, touching one small coin that glowed with the deep mellowness of ancient gold from the velvet.And here, a Sestercius of the Calpurnia family.His voice was soft and his hands sure, stroking the edge of a silver coin only slightly worn, or cradling one in his palm to demonstrate the weight of it.He looked up from the coins, eyes bright with the reflections of the precious metal.Monsieur Fraser tells me that you desire to inspect as many of the Greek and Roman rarities as possible.I have not my whole stock with me, of course, but I have quite a fewand I could send to Frankfort for others, if you desire.Jamie smiled, shaking his head.Im afraid we havent time, Mr.Mayer.We  Just Mayer, Monsieur Fraser, the young man interrupted, perfectly polite, but with a slight edge in his voice.Indeed.Jamie bowed slightly.I hope my cousin shall not have misled you.I shall be most happy to pay the cost of your journey, and something for your time, but I am not wishful to purchase any of your stock myselfMayer.The young mans eyebrows rose in inquiry, along with one shoulder.What I wish, Jamie said slowly, leaning forward to look closely at the coins on display, is to compare your stock with my recollection of several ancient coins I have seen, and thenshould I see any that are similarto inquire whether youor your family, I should say, for I expect you are too young yourselfshould be familiar with anyone who might have purchased such coins twenty years ago.He glanced up at the young Jew, who was looking justifiably astonished, and smiled.That may be asking a bit much of you, I know.But my cousin tells me that your family is one of the few who deals in such matters, and is by far the most knowledgeable.If you can acquaint me likewise with any persons in the West Indies with interests in this area, I should be deeply obliged to you.Mayer sat looking at him for a moment, then inclined his head, the sunlight winking from the border of small jet beads that adorned his skullcap.It was plain that he was intensely curious, but he merely touched his pack and said, My father or my uncle would have sold such coins, not me; but I have here the catalogue and record of every coin that has passed through our hands in thirty years.I will tell you what I can.He drew the velvet cloth toward Jamie and sat back.Do you see anything here like the coins you remember?Jamie studied the rows of coins with close attention, then gently nudged a silver piece, about the size of an American quarter.Three leaping porpoises circled its edge, surrounding a charioteer in the center.This one, he said.There were several like itsmall differences, but several with these porpoises.He looked again, picked out a worn gold disc with an indistinct profile, then a silver one, somewhat larger and in better condition, with a mans head shown both full face and in profile.These, he said.Fourteen of the gold ones, and ten of the ones with two heads.Ten!Mayers bright eyes popped wide with astonishment.I should not have thought there were so many in Europe.Jamie nodded.Im quite certainI saw them closely; handled them, even.These are the twin heads of Alexander, Mayer said, touching the coin with reverence.Very rare indeed.It is a tetradrachm, struck to commemorate the battle fought at Amphipolos, and the founding of a city on the site of the battlefield.Jamie listened with attention, a slight smile on his lips.While he had no great interest in ancient money himself, he did have a great appreciation for a man with a passion.A quarter of an hour more, another consultation of the catalogue, and the business was complete.Four Greek drachmas of a type Jamie recognized had been added to the collection, several small gold and silver coins, and a thing called a quintinarius, a Roman coin in heavy gold.Mayer bent and reached into his pack once more, this time pulling out a sheaf of foolscap pages furled into a roll and tied with ribbon.Untied, they showed row upon row of what looked from a distance like bird tracks; on closer inspection, they proved to be Hebraic writing, inked small and precise.He thumbed slowly through the pages, stopping here and there with a murmured Um, then passing on.At last he laid the pages on his shabby knee and looked up at Jamie, head cocked to one side.Our transactions are naturally carried out in confidence, Monsieur, he said, and so while I could tell you, for example, that certainly we had sold such and such a coin, in such and such a year, I should not be able to tell you the name of the purchaser.He paused, evidently thinking, then went on.We did in fact sell coins of your descriptionthree drachmas, two each of the heads of Egalabalus and the double head of Alexander, and no fewer than six of the gold Calpurnian aurei in the year 1745.He hesitated.Normally, that is all I could tell you.Howeverin this case, Monsieur, I happen to know that the original buyer of these coins is deadhas been dead for some years, in fact.Really, I cannot see that under the circumstances He shrugged, making up his mind.The purchaser was an Englishman, Monsieur.His name was Clarence Marylebone, Duke of Sandringham.Sandringham!I exclaimed, startled into speech.Mayer looked curiously at me, then at Jamie, whose face betrayed nothing beyond polite interest.Yes, Madame, he said.I know that the Duke is dead, for he possessed an extensive collection of ancient coins, which my uncle bought from his heirs in 1746the transaction is listed here.He raised the catalogue slightly, and let it fall.I knew the Duke of Sandringham was dead, too, and by more immediate experience.Jamies godfather, Murtagh, had killed him, on a dark night in March 1746, soon before the battle of Culloden brought an end to the Jacobite rebellion.I swallowed briefly, recalling my last sight of the Dukes face, its blueberry eyes fixed in an expression of intense surprise.Mayers eyes went back and forth between us, then he added hesitantly, I can tell you also this; when my uncle purchased the Dukes collection after his death, there were no tetradrachms in it.No, Jamie murmured, to himself.There wouldnt have been.Then, recollecting himself, he stood and reached for the decanter that stood on the sideboard.I thank you, Mayer, he said formally.And now, let us drink to you and your wee book, there.A few minutes later, Mayer was kneeling on the floor, doing up the fastenings of his ragged pack.The small pouch filled with silver livres that Jamie had given him in payment was in his pocket.He rose and bowed in turn to Jamie and to me before straightening and putting on his disreputable hat.I bid you goodbye, Madame, he said.Goodbye to you, too, Mayer, I replied.Then I asked, somewhat hesitantly, Is Mayer really your only name?Something flickered in the wide blue eyes, but he answered politely, heaving the heavy sack onto his back, Yes, Madame.The Jews of Frankfort are not allowed to use family names.He looked up and smiled lopsidedly.For the sake of convenience, the neighbors call us after an old red shield that was painted on the front of our house, many years ago.But beyond thatno, Madame.We have no name.Josephine came then to conduct our visitor to the kitchen, taking care to walk several paces in front of him, her nostrils pinched white as though smelling something foul.Mayer stumbled after her, his clumsy sabots clattering on the polished floor.Jamie relaxed in his chair, eyes abstracted in deep thought.I heard the door close downstairs a few minutes later, with what was almost a slam, and the click of sabots on the stone steps below.Jamie heard it too, and turned toward the window.Well, Godspeed to ye, Mayer Red Shield, he said, smiling.Jamie, I said, suddenly thinking of something, do you speak German?Eh?Oh, aye, he said vaguely, his attention still fixed on the window and the noises outside.What is red shield in German?I asked.He looked blank for a moment, then his eyes cleared as his brain made the proper connection.Rothschild, Sassenach, he said.Why?Just a thought, I said.I looked toward the window, where the clatter of wooden shoes was long since lost in the noises of the street.I suppose everyone has to start somewhere.Fifteen men on a dead mans chest, I observed.Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum.Jamie gave me a look.Oh, aye?he said.The Duke being the dead man, I explained.Do you think the seals treasure was really his?I couldna say for sure, but it seems at least likely.Jamies two stiff fingers tapped briefly on the table in a meditative rhythm.When Jared mentioned Mayer the coin dealer to me, I thought it worth inquiringfor surely the most likely person to have sent the Bruja to retrieve the treasure was the person who put it there.Good reasoning, I said, but evidently it wasnt the same person, if it was the Duke who put it there.Do you think the whole treasure amounted to fifty thousand pounds?Jamie squinted at his reflection in the rounded side of the decanter, considering.Then he picked it up and refilled his glass, to assist thought.Not as metal, no.But did ye notice the prices that some of those coins in Mayers catalogue have sold for?I did.As much as a thousand poundsterling!for a moldy bit of metal!he said, marveling.I dont think metal molds, I said, but I take your point.Anyway, I said, dismissing the question with a wave of my hand, the point here is this; do you suppose the seals treasure could have been the fifty thousand pounds that the Duke had promised to the Stuarts?In the early days of 1744, when Charles Stuart had been in France, trying to persuade his royal cousin Louis to grant him some sort of support, he had received a ciphered offer from the Duke of Sandringham, of fifty thousand poundsenough to hire a small armyon condition that he enter England to retake the throne of his ancestors.Whether it had been this offer that finally convinced the vacillating Prince Charles to undertake his doomed excursion, we would never know.It might as easily have been a challenge from someone he was drinking with, or a slightreal or imaginedby his mistress, that had sent him to Scotland with nothing more than six companions, two thousand Dutch broadswords, and several casks of brandywine with which to charm the Highland chieftains.In any case, the fifty thousand pounds had never been received, because the Duke had died before Charles reached England.Another of the speculations that troubled me on sleepless nights was the question of whether that money would have made a difference.If Charles Stuart had received it, would he have taken his ragged Highland army all the way to London, retaken the throne and regained his fathers crown?If he hadwell, if he had, the Jacobite rebellion might have succeeded, Culloden might not have happened, I should never have gone back through the circle of stoneand I and Brianna would likely both have died in childbed and been dust these many years past.Surely twenty years should have been enough to teach me the futility of if.Jamie had been considering, meditatively rubbing the bridge of his nose.It might have been, he said at last.Given a proper market for the coins and gemsye ken such things take time to sell; if ye must dispose of them quickly, youll get but a fraction of the price.But given long enough to search out good buyersaye, it might reach fifty thousand.Duncan Kerr was a Jacobite, wasnt he?Jamie frowned, nodding.He was.Aye, it could bethough God knows its an awkward kind of fortune to be handing to the commander of an army to pay his troops!Yes, but its also small, portable, and easy to hide, I pointed out.And if you were the Duke, and busy committing treason by dealing with the Stuarts, that might be important to you.Sending fifty thousand pounds in sterling, with strongboxes and carriages and guards, would attract the hell of a lot more attention than sending one man secretly across the Channel with a small wooden box.Jamie nodded again.Likewise, if ye had a collection of such rarities already, it would attract no attention to be acquiring more, and no one would likely notice what coins ye had.It would be a simple matter to take out the most valuable, replace them with cheap ones, and no one the wiser.No banker who might talk, were ye to shift money or land.He shook his head admiringly.Its a clever scheme, aye, whoever made it.He looked up inquiringly at me.But then, why did Duncan Kerr come, nearly ten years after Culloden?And what happened to him?Did he come to leave the fortune on the silkies isle then, or to take it away?And who sent the Bruja now?I finished for him.I shook my head, too.Damned if I know.Perhaps the Duke had a confederate of some sort?But if he did, we dont know who it was.Jamie sighed, and impatient with sitting for so long, stood up and stretched.He glanced out the window, estimating the height of the sun, his usual method of telling time, whether a clock was handy or not.Aye, well, well have time for speculation once were at sea.Its near on noon, now, and the Paris coach leaves at three oclock.The apothecarys shop in the Rue de Varennes was gone.In its place were a thriving tavern, a pawnbrokers, and a small goldsmiths shop, crammed companionably cheek by jowl.Master Raymond?The pawnbroker knitted grizzled brows.I have heard of him, Madamehe darted a wary glance at me, suggesting that whatever he had heard had not been very admirablebut he has been gone for several years.If you are requiring a good apothecary, though, Krasner in the Place dAloes, or perhaps Madame Verrue, near the Tuileries He stared with interest at Mr.Willoughby, who accompanied me, then leaned over the counter to address me confidentially.Might you be interested in selling your Chinaman, Madame?I have a client with a marked taste for the Orient.I could get you a very good pricewith no more than the usual commission, I assure you.Mr.Willoughby, who did not speak French, was peering with marked contempt at a porcelain jar painted with pheasants, done in an Oriental style.Thank you, I said, but I think not.Ill try Krasner.Mr.Willoughby had attracted relatively little attention in Le Havre, a port city teeming with foreigners of every description.On the streets of Paris, wearing a padded jacket over his blue silk pajamas, and with his queue wrapped several times around his head for convenience, he caused considerable comment.He did, however, prove surprisingly knowledgeable about herbs and medicinal substances.Bai jei ai, he told me, picking up a pinch of mustard seed from an open box in Krasners emporium.Good for shen yenkidneys.Yes, it is, I said, surprised.How did you know?He allowed his head to roll slightly from side to side, as I had learned was his habit when pleased at being able to astonish someone.I know healers one time, was all he said, though, before turning to point at a basket containing what looked like balls of dried mud.Shan y, he said authoritatively.Goodvery goodcleanse blood, liver he work good, no dry skin, help see.You buy.I stepped closer to examine the objects in question and found them to be a particularly homely sort of dried eel, rolled into balls and liberally coated with mud.The price was quite reasonable, though, so to please him, I added two of the nasty things to the basket over my arm.The weather was mild for early December, and we walked back toward Jareds house in the Rue Tremoulins.The streets were bright with winter sunshine, and lively with vendors, beggars, prostitutes, shopgirls, and the other denizens of the poorer part of Paris, all taking advantage of the temporary thaw.At the corner of the Rue du Nord and the Alle des Canards, though, I saw something quite out of the ordinary; a tall, slope shouldered figure in black frock coat and a round black hat.Reverend Campbell!I exclaimed.He whirled about at being so addressed, then, recognizing me, bowed and removed his hat.Mistress Malcolm!he said.How most agreeable to see you again.His eye fell on Mr.Willoughby, and he blinked, features hardening in a stare of disapproval.Erthis is Mr.Willoughby, I introduced him.Hes anassociate of my husbands.Mr.Willoughby, the Reverend Archibald Campbell.Indeed.The Reverend Campbell normally looked quite austere, but contrived now to look as though he had breakfasted on barbed wire, and found it untasty.I thought that you were sailing from Edinburgh to the West Indies, I said, in hopes of taking his gelid eye off the Chinaman.It worked; his gaze shifted to me, and thawed slightly.I thank you for your kind inquiries, Madame, he said.I still harbor such intentions.However, I had urgent business to transact first in France.I shall be departing from Edinburgh on Thursday week.And how is your sister?I asked.He glanced at Mr.Willoughby with dislike, then taking a step to one side so as to be out of the Chinamans direct sight, lowered his voice.She is somewhat improved, I thank you.The draughts you prescribed have been most helpful.She is much calmer, and sleeps quite regularly now.I must thank you again for your kind attentions.Thats quite all right, I said.I hope the voyage will agree with her.We parted with the usual expressions of good will, and Mr.Willoughby and I walked down the Rue du Nord, back toward Jareds house.Reverend meaning most holy fella, not true?Mr.Willoughby said, after a short silence.He had the usual Oriental difficulty in pronouncing the letter r, which made the word Reverend more than slightly picturesque, but I gathered his meaning well enough.True, I said, glancing down at him curiously.He pursed his lips and pushed them in and out, then grunted in a distinctly amused manner.Not so holy, that Reverend fella, he said.What makes you say so?He gave me a bright eyed glance, full of shrewdness.I see him one time, Madame Jeannes.Not loud talking then.Very quiet then, Reverend fella.Oh, really?I turned to look back, but the Reverends tall figure had disappeared into the crowd.Stinking whores, Mr.Willoughby amplified, making an extremely rude gesture in the vicinity of his crotch in illustration.Yes, I gathered, I said.Well, I suppose the flesh is weak now and then, even for Scottish Free Church ministers.At dinner that night, I mentioned seeing the Reverend, though without adding Mr.Willoughbys remarks about the Reverends extracurricular activities.I ought to have asked him where in the West Indies he was going, I said.Not that hes a particularly scintillating companion, but it might be useful to know someone there.Jared, who was consuming veal patties in a businesslike way, paused to swallow, then said, Dinna trouble yourself about that, my dear.Ive made up a list for you of useful acquaintances.Ive written letters for ye to carry to several friends there, who will certainly lend ye assistance.He cut another sizable chunk of veal, wiped it through a puddle of wine sauce, and chewed it, while looking thoughtfully at Jamie.Having evidently come to a decision of some kind, he swallowed, took a sip of wine, and said in a conversational voice, We met on the level, Cousin.I stared at him in bewilderment, but Jamie, after a moments pause, replied, And we parted on the square.Jareds narrow face broke into a wide smile.Ah, thats a help!he said.I wasna just sure, aye?but I thought it worth the trial.Where were ye made?In prison, Jamie replied briefly.It will be the Inverness lodge, though.Jared nodded in satisfaction.Aye, well enough.There are lodges on Jamaica and BarbadosIll have letters for ye to the Masters there.But the largest lodge is on Trinidadbetter than two thousand members there.If ye should need great help in finding the lad, thats where ye must ask.Word of everything that happens in the islands comes through that lodge, sooner or later.Would you care to tell me what youre talking about?I interrupted.Jamie glanced at me and smiled.Freemasons, Sassenach.Youre a Mason?I blurted.You didnt tell me that!Hes not meant to, Jared said, a bit sharply.The rites of Freemasonry are secret, known only to the members.I wouldna have been able to give Jamie an introduction to the Trinidad lodge, had he not been one of us already.The conversation became general again, as Jamie and Jared fell to discussing the provisioning of the Artemis, but I was quiet, concentrating on my own veal.The incident, small as it was, had reminded me of all the things I didnt know about Jamie.At one time, I should have said I knew him as well as one person can know another.Now, there would be moments, talking intimately together, falling asleep in the curve of his shoulder, holding him close in the act of love, when I felt I knew him still, his mind and heart as clear to me as the lead crystal of the wineglasses on Jareds table.And others, like now, when I would stumble suddenly over some unsuspected bit of his past, or see him standing still, eyes shrouded with recollections I didnt share.I felt suddenly unsure and alone, hesitating on the brink of the gap between us.Jamies foot pressed against mine under the table, and he looked across at me with a smile hidden in his eyes.He raised his glass a little, in a silent toast, and I smiled back, feeling obscurely comforted.The gesture brought back a sudden memory of our wedding night, when we had sat beside each other sipping wine, strangers frightened of each other, with nothing between us but a marriage contractand the promise of honesty.There are things ye maybe canna tell me, he had said.I willna ask ye, or force ye.But when ye do tell me something, let it be the truth.There is nothing between us now but respect, and respect has room for secrets, I thinkbut not for lies.I drank deeply from my own glass, feeling the strong bouquet of the wine billow up inside my head, and a warm flush heat my cheeks.Jamies eyes were still fixed on me, ignoring Jareds soliloquy about ships biscuit and candles.His foot nudged mine in silent inquiry, and I pressed back in answer.Aye, Ill see to it in the morning, he said, in reply to a question from Jared.But for now, Cousin, I think I shall retire.Its been a long day.He pushed back his chair, stood up, and held out his arm to me.Will ye join me, Claire?I stood up, the wine rushing through my limbs, making me feel warm all over and slightly giddy.Our eyes met with a perfect understanding.There was more than respect between us now, and room for all our secrets to be known, in good time.In the morning, Jamie and Mr.Willoughby went with Jared, to complete their errands.I had another errand of my ownone that I preferred to do alone.Twenty years ago, there had been two people in Paris whom I cared for deeply.Master Raymond was gone; dead or disappeared.The chances that the other might still be living were slim, but still, I had to see, before I left Europe for what might be the last time.With my heart beating erratically, I stepped into Jareds coach, and told the coachman to drive to the Hpital des Anges.The grave was set in the small cemetery reserved for the convent, under the buttresses of the nearby cathedral.Even though the air from the Seine was damp and cold, and the day cloudy, the walled cemetery held a soft light, reflected from the blocks of pale limestone that sheltered the small plot from wind.In the winter, there were no shrubs or flowers growing, but leafless aspens and larches spread a delicate tracery against the sky, and a deep green moss cradled the stones, thriving despite the cold.It was a small stone, made of a soft white marble.A pair of cherubs wings spread out across the top, sheltering the single word that was the stones only other decoration.Faith, it read.I stood looking down at it until my vision blurred.I had brought a flower; a pink tulipnot the easiest thing to find in Paris in December, but Jared kept a conservatory.I knelt down and laid it on the stone, stroking the soft curve of the petal with a finger, as though it were a babys cheek.I thought I wouldnt cry, I said a little later.I felt the weight of Mother Hildegardes hand on my head.Le Bon Dieu orders things as He thinks best, she said softly.But He seldom tells us why.I took a deep breath and wiped my cheeks with a corner of my cloak.It was a long time ago, though.I rose slowly to my feet and turned to find Mother Hildegarde watching me with an expression of deep sympathy and interest.I have noticed, she said slowly, that time does not really exist for mothers, with regard to their children.It does not matter greatly how old the child isin the blink of an eye, the mother can see the child again as it was when it was born, when it learned to walk, as it was at any ageat any time, even when the child is fully grown and a parent itself.Especially when theyre asleep, I said, looking down again at the little white stone.You can always see the baby then.Ah.Mother nodded, satisfied.I thought you had had more children; you have the look, somehow.One more.I glanced at her.And how do you know so much about mothers and children?The small black eyes shone shrewdly under heavy brow ridges whose sparse hairs had gone quite white.The old require very little sleep, she said, with a deprecatory shrug.I walk the wards at night, sometimes.The patients talk to me.She had shrunk somewhat with advancing age, and the wide shoulders were slightly bowed, thin as a wire hanger beneath the black serge of her habit.Even so, she was still taller than I, and towered over most of the nuns, more scarecrow like, but imposing as ever.She carried a walking stick but strode erect, firm of tread and with the same piercing eye, using the stick more frequently to prod idlers or direct underlings than to lean on.I blew my nose and we turned back along the path to the convent.As we walked slowly back, I noticed other small stones set here and there among the larger ones.Are those all children?I asked, a little surprised.The children of the nuns, she said matter of factly.I gaped at her in astonishment, and she shrugged, elegant and wry as always.It happens, she said.She walked a few steps farther, then added, Not often, of course.She gestured with her stick around the confines of the cemetery.This place is reserved for the sisters, a few benefactors of the Hpitaland those they love.The sisters or the benefactors?The sisters.Here, you lump!Mother Hildegarde paused in her progress, spotting an orderly leaning idly against the church wall, smoking a pipe.As she berated him in the elegantly vicious Court French of her girlhood, I stood back, looking around the tiny cemetery.Against the far wall, but still in consecrated ground, was a row of small stone tablets, each with a single name, Bouton.Below each name was a Roman numeral, I through XV.Mother Hildegardes beloved dogs.I glanced at her current companion, the sixteenth holder of that name.This one was coal black, and curly as a Persian lamb.He sat bolt upright at her feet, round eyes fixed on the delinquent orderly, a silent echo of Mother Hildegardes outspoken disapproval.The sisters, and those they love.Mother Hildegarde came back, her fierce expression altering at once to the smile that transformed her strong gargoyle features into beauty.I am so pleased that you have come again, ma chre, she said.Come inside; I shall find things that may be useful to you on your journey.Tucking the stick in the crook of her arm, she instead took my forearm for support, grasping it with a warm bony hand whose skin had grown paperthin.I had the odd feeling that it was not I who supported her, but the other way around.As we turned into the small yew alley that led to the entrance to the Hpital, I glanced up at her.I hope you wont think me rude, Mother, I said hesitantly, but there is one question I wanted to ask you  Eighty three, she replied promptly.She grinned broadly, showing her long yellow horses teeth.Everyone wants to know, she said complacently.She looked back over her shoulder toward the tiny graveyard, and lifted one shoulder in a dismissive Gallic shrug.Not yet, she said confidently.Le Bon Dieu knows how much work there is still to do.41  WE SET SAIL  It was a cold, gray daythere is no other kind in Scotland in Decemberwhen the Artemis touched at Cape Wrath, on the northwest coast.I peered out of the tavern window into a solid gray murk that hid the cliffs along the shore.The place was depressingly reminiscent of the landscape near the silkies isle, with the smell of dead seaweed strong in the air, and the crashing of waves so loud as to inhibit conversation, even inside the small pothouse by the wharf.Young Ian had been taken nearly a month before.Now it was past Christmas, and here we were, still in Scotland, no more than a few miles from the seals island.Jamie was striding up and down the dock outside, in spite of the cold rain, too restless to stay indoors by the fire.The sea journey from France back to Scotland had been no better for him than the first Channel crossing, and I knew the prospect of two or three months aboard the Artemis filled him with dread.At the same time, his impatience to be in pursuit of the kidnappers was so acute that any delay filled him with frustration.More than once I had awakened in the middle of the night to find him gone, walking the streets of Le Havre alone.Ironically, this final delay was of his own making.We had touched at Cape Wrath to retrieve Fergus, and with him, the small group of smugglers whom Jamie had sent him to fetch, before leaving ourselves for Le Havre.Theres no telling what we shall find in the Indies, Sassenach, Jamie had explained to me.I dinna mean to go up against a shipload of pirates singlehanded, nor yet to fight wi men I dinna ken alongside me.The smugglers were all men of the shore, accustomed to boats and the ocean, if not to ships; they would be hired on as part of the Artemiss crew, shorthanded in consequence of the late season in which we sailed.Cape Wrath was a small port, with little traffic at this time of year.Besides the Artemis, only a few fishing boats and a ketch were tied up at the wooden wharf.There was a small pothouse, though, in which the crew of the Artemis cheerfully passed their time while waiting, the men who would not fit inside the house crouching under the eaves, swilling pots of ale passed through the windows by their comrades indoors.Jamie walked on the shore, coming in only for meals, when he would sit before the fire, the wisps of steam rising from his soggy garments symptomatic of his increasing aggravation of soul.Fergus was late.No one seemed to mind the wait but Jamie and Jareds captain.Captain Raines, a small, plump, elderly man, spent most of his time on the deck of his ship, keeping one weather eye on the overcast sky, and the other on his barometer.Thats verra strong smelling stuff, Sassenach, Jamie observed, during one of his brief visits to the taproom.What is it?Fresh ginger, I answered, holding up the remains of the root I was grating.Its the thing most of my herbals say is best for nausea.Oh, aye?He picked up the bowl, sniffed at the contents, and sneezed explosively, to the vast amusement of the onlookers.I snatched back the bowl before he could spill it.You dont take it like snuff, I said.You drink it in tea.And I hope to heaven it works, because if it doesnt, well be scooping you out of the bilges, if bilges are what I think they are.Oh, not to worry, missus, one of the older hands assured me, overhearing.Lots o green hands feel a bit queerlike the first day or two.But usually they comes round soon enough; by the third day, theyve got used to the pitch and roll, and theyre up in the rigging, happy as larks.I glanced at Jamie, who was markedly unlarklike at the moment.Still, this comment seemed to give him some hope, for he brightened a bit, and waved to the harassed servingmaid for a glass of ale.It may be so, he said.Jared said the same; that seasickness doesna generally last more than a few days, provided the seas arent too heavy.He took a small sip of his ale, and then, with growing confidence, a deeper swallow.I can stand three days of it, I suppose.Late in the afternoon of the second day, six men appeared, winding their way along the stony shore on shaggy Highland ponies.Theres Raeburn in the lead, Jamie said, shading his eyes and squinting to distinguish the identities of the six small dots.Kennedy after him, then Inneshes missing the left arm, see?and Meldrum, and thatll be MacLeod with him, they always ride together like that.Is the last man Gordon, then, or Fergus?It must be Gordon, I said, peering over his shoulder at the approaching men, because its much too fat to be Fergus.Where the devil is Fergus, then?Jamie asked Raeburn, once the smugglers had been greeted, introduced to their new shipmates, and sat down to a hot supper and a cheerful glass.Raeburn bobbed his head in response, hastily swallowing the remains of his pasty.Weel, he said to me as how hed some business to see to, and would I see to the hiring of the horses, and speak to Meldrum and MacLeod about coming, for they were out wi their own boat at the time, and not expected back for a day or twa more, and  What business?Jamie said sharply, but got no more than a shrug in reply.Jamie muttered something under his breath in Gaelic, but returned to his own supper without further comment.The crew being now completesave Ferguspreparations began in the morning for getting under way.The deck was a scene of organized confusion, with bodies darting to and fro, popping up through hatchways, and dropping suddenly out of the rigging like dead flies.Jamie stood near the wheel, keeping out of the way, but lending a hand whenever a matter requiring muscle rather than skill arose.For the most part, though, he simply stood, eyes fixed on the road along the shore.We shall have to sail by midafternoon, or miss the tide.Captain Raines spoke kindly, but firmly.Well have surly weather in twenty four hours; the glass is falling, and I feel it in my neck.The Captain tenderly massaged the part in question, and nodded at the sky, which had gone from pewter to lead gray since early morning.Ill not set sail in a storm if I can help it, and if we mean to make the Indies as soon as possible  Aye, I understand, Captain, Jamie interrupted him.Of course; ye must do as seems best.He stood back to let a bustling seaman go past, and the Captain disappeared, issuing orders as he went.As the day wore on, Jamie seemed composed as usual, but I noticed that the stiff fingers fluttered against his thigh more and more often, the only outward sign of worry.And worried he was.Fergus had been with him since the day twenty years before, when Jamie had found him in a Paris brothel, and hired him to steal Charles Stuarts letters.More than that; Fergus had lived at Lallybroch since before Young Ian was born.The boy had been a younger brother to Fergus, and Jamie the closest thing to a father that Fergus had ever known.I could not imagine any business so urgent that it would have kept him from Jamies side.Neither could Jamie, and his fingers beat a silent tattoo on the wood of the rail.Then it was time, and Jamie turned reluctantly away, tearing his eyes from the empty shore.The hatches were battened, the lines coiled, and several seamen leapt ashore to cast free the mooring hawsers; there were six of them, each a rope as thick around as my wrist.I put a hand on Jamies arm in silent sympathy.Youd better come down below, I said.Ive got a spirit lamp.Ill brew you some hot ginger tea, and then you  The sound of a galloping horse echoed along the shore, the scrunch of hoofbeats on gravel echoing from the cliffside well in advance of its appearance.There he is, the wee fool, Jamie said, his relief evident in voice and body.He turned to Captain Raines, one brow raised in question.Theres enough of the tide left?Aye, then, lets go.Cast off!the Captain bellowed, and the waiting hands sprang into action.The last of the lines tethering us to the piling was slipped free and neatly coiled, and all around us, lines tightened and sails snapped overhead, as the bosun ran up and down the deck, bawling orders in a voice like rusty iron.She moves!She stirs!She seems to feel / the thrill of life along her keel!I declaimed, delighted to feel the deck quiver beneath my feet as the ship came alive, the energy of all the crew poured into its inanimate hulk, transmuted by the power of the wind catching sails.Oh, God, said Jamie hollowly, feeling the same thing.He grasped the rail, closed his eyes and swallowed.Mr.Willoughby says he has a cure for seasickness, I said, watching him sympathetically.Ha, he said, opening his eyes.I ken what he means, and if he thinks Ill let himwhat the bloody hell!I whirled to look, and saw what had caused him to break off.Fergus was on deck, reaching up to help down a girl perched awkwardly above him on the railing, her long blond hair whipping in the wind.Laoghaires daughterMarsali MacKimmie.Before I could speak, Jamie was past me and striding toward the pair.What in the name of holy God dye mean by this, ye wee coofs?he was demanding, by the time I made my way into earshot through the obstacle course of lines and seamen.He loomed menacingly over the pair, a foot taller than either of them.We are married, Fergus said, bravely moving in front of Marsali.He looked both scared and excited, his face pale beneath the shock of black hair.Married!Jamies hands clenched at his sides, and Fergus took an involuntary step backward, nearly treading on Marsalis toes.What dye mean, married?I assumed this was a rhetorical question, but it wasnt; Jamies appreciation of the situation had, as usual, outstripped mine by yards and seized at once upon the salient point.Have ye bedded her?he demanded bluntly.Standing behind him, I couldnt see his face, but I knew what it must look like, if only because I could see the effect of his expression on Fergus.The Frenchman turned a couple of shades paler and licked his lips.Erno, milord, he said, just as Marsali, eyes blazing, thrust her chin up and said defiantly, Yes, he has!Jamie glanced briefly back and forth between the two of them, snorted loudly, and turned away.Mr.Warren!he called down the deck to the ships sailing master.Put back to the shore, if ye please!Mr.Warren stopped, openmouthed, in the middle of an order addressed to the rigging, and stared, first at Jamie, thenquite elaboratelyat the receding shoreline.In the few moments since the appearance of the putative newlyweds, the Artemis had moved more than a thousand yards from the shore, and the rocks of the cliffs were slipping by with increasing speed.I dont believe he can, I said.I think were already in the tide race.No sailor himself, Jamie had spent sufficient time in the company of seamen at least to understand the notion that time and tide wait for no one.He breathed through his teeth for a moment, then jerked his head toward the ladder that led belowdecks.Come down, then, the both of ye.Fergus and Marsali sat together in the tiny cabin, huddled on one berth, hands clutched tight.Jamie waved me to a seat on the other berth, then turned to the pair, hands on his hips.Now, then, he said.Whats this nonsense of bein married?It is true, milord, Fergus said.He was quite pale, but his dark eyes were bright with excitement.His one hand tightened on Marsalis, his hook resting across his thigh.Aye?Jamie said, with the maximum of skepticism.And who married ye?The two glanced at each other, and Fergus licked his lips briefly before replying.Wewe are handfast.Before witnesses, Marsali put in.In contrast to Ferguss paleness, a high color burned in her cheeks.She had her mothers roseleaf skin, but the stubborn set of her jaw had likely come from somewhere else.She put a hand to her bosom, where something crackled under the fabric.I ha the contract, and the signatures, here.Jamie made a low growling noise in his throat.By the laws of Scotland, two people could in fact be legally married by clasping hands before witnesseshandfastingand declaring themselves to be man and wife.Aye, well, he said.But yere no bedded, yet, and a contracts not enough, in the eyes o the Church.He glanced out of the stern casement, where the cliffs were just visible through the ragged mist, then nodded with decision.Well stop at Lewes for the last provisions.Marsali will go ashore there; Ill send two seamen to see her home to her mother.Yell do no such thing!Marsali cried.She sat up straight, glaring at her stepfather.Im going wi Fergus!Oh, no, youre not, my lassie!Jamie snapped.Dye have no feeling for your mother?To run off, wi no word, and leave her to be worrit  I left word.Marsalis square chin was high.I sent a letter from Inverness, saying Id married Fergus and was off to sail wi you.Sweet bleeding Jesus!Shell think I kent all about it!Jamie looked horror stricken.WeIdid ask the lady Laoghaire for the honor of her daughters hand, milord, Fergus put in.Last month, when I came to Lallybroch.Aye.Well, ye needna tell me what she said, Jamie said dryly, seeing the sudden flush on Ferguss cheeks.Since I gather the general answer was no.She said he was a bastard!Marsali burst out indignantly.And a criminal, andand  He is a bastard and a criminal, Jamie pointed out.And a cripple wi no property, either, as Im sure your mother noticed.I dinna care!Marsali gripped Ferguss hand and looked at him with fierce affection.I want him.Taken aback, Jamie rubbed a finger across his lips.Then he took a deep breath and returned to the attack.Be that as it may, he said, yere too young to be married.Im fifteen; thats plenty old enough!Aye, and hes thirty!Jamie snapped.He shook his head, Nay, lassie, Im sorry about it, but I canna let ye do it.If it were nothing else, the voyage is too dangerous  Youre taking her!Marsalis chin jerked contemptuously in my direction.Youll leave Claire out of this, Jamie said evenly.Shes none of your concern, and  Oh, shes not?You leave my mother for this English whore, and make her a laughingstock for the whole countryside, and its no my concern, is it?Marsali leapt up and stamped her foot on the deck.And you ha the hellish nerve to tell me what I shall do?I have, Jamie said, keeping hold of his temper with some difficulty.My private affairs are not your concern  And mine arent any of yours!Fergus, looking alarmed, was on his feet, trying to calm the girl.Marsali, ma chre, you must not speak to milord in such a way.He is only  Ill speak to him any way I want!No, you will not!Surprised at the sudden harshness in Ferguss tone, Marsali blinked.Only an inch or two taller than his new wife, the Frenchman had a certain wiry authority that made him seem much bigger than he was.No, he said more softly.Sit down, ma ptite.He pressed her back down on the berth, and stood before her.Milord has been to me more than a father, he said gently to the girl.I owe him my life a thousand times.He is also your stepfather.However your mother may regard him, he has without doubt supported and sheltered her and you and your sister.You owe him respect, at the least.Marsali bit her lip, her eyes bright.Finally she ducked her head awkwardly at Jamie.Im sorry, she murmured, and the air of tension in the cabin lessened slightly.Its all right, lassie, Jamie said gruffly.He looked at her and sighed.But still, Marsali, we must send ye back to your mother.I wont go.The girl was calmer now, but the set of her pointed chin was the same.She glanced at Fergus, then at Jamie.He says we havena bedded together, but we have.Or at any rate, I shall say we have.If ye send me home, Ill tell everyone that hes had me; so ye seeI shall either be married or ruined.Her tone was reasonable and determined.Jamie closed his eyes.May the Lord deliver me from women, he said between his teeth.He opened his eyes and glared at her.All right!he said.Youre married.But youll do it right, before a priest.Well find one in the Indies, when we land.And until yeve been blessed, Fergus doesna touch you.Aye?He turned a ferocious gaze on both of them.Yes, milord, said Fergus, his features suffused with joy.Merci beaucoup!Marsali narrowed her eyes at Jamie, but seeing that he wasnt to be moved, she bowed her head demurely, with a sidelong glance at me.Yes, Daddy, she said.The question of Ferguss elopement had at least distracted Jamies mind temporarily from the motion of the ship, but the palliative effect didnt last.He held on grimly nevertheless, turning greener by the moment, but refusing to leave the deck and go below, so long as the shore of Scotland was in sight.I may never see it again, he said gloomily, when I tried to persuade him to go below and lie down.He leaned heavily on the rail he had just been vomiting over, eyes resting longingly on the unprepossessingly bleak coast behind us.No, youll see it, I said, with an unthinking surety.Youre coming back.I dont know when, but I know youll come back.He turned his head to look up at me, puzzled.Then the ghost of a smile crossed his face.Youve seen my grave, he said softly.Havent ye?I hesitated, but he didnt seem upset, and I nodded.Its all right, he said.He closed his eyes, breathing heavily.Dontdont tell me when, though, if ye dinna mind.I cant, I said.There werent any dates on it.Just your nameand mine.Yours?His eyes popped open.I nodded again, feeling my throat tighten at the memory of that granite slab.It had been what they call a marriage stone, a quarter circle carved to fit with another in a complete arch.I had, of course, seen only the one half.It had all your names on it.Thats how I knew it was you.And underneath, it said, Beloved husband of Claire.At the time, I didnt see howbut now, of course, I do.He nodded slowly, absorbing it.Aye, I see.Aye well, I suppose if I shall be in Scotland, and still married to youthen maybe when doesna matter so much.He gave me a shadow of his usual grin, and added wryly, It also means well find Young Ian safe, for Ill tell ye, Sassenach, I willna set foot in Scotland again without him.Well find him, I said, with an assurance I didnt altogether feel.I put a hand on his shoulder and stood beside him, watching Scotland slowly recede in the distance.By the time evening set in, the rocks of Scotland had disappeared in the sea mists, and Jamie, chilled to the bone and pale as a sheet, suffered himself to be led below and put to bed.At this point, the unforeseen consequences of his ultimatum to Fergus became apparent.There were only two small private cabins, besides the Captains; if Fergus and Marsali were forbidden to share one until their union was formally blessed, then clearly Jamie and Fergus would have to take one, and Marsali and I the other.It seemed destined to be a rough voyage, in more ways than one.I had hoped that the sickness might ease, if Jamie couldnt see the slow heave and fall of the horizon, but no such luck.Again?said Fergus, sleepily rousing on one elbow in his berth, in the middle of the night.How can he?He has eaten nothing all day!Tell him that, I said, trying to breathe through my mouth as I sidled toward the door, a basin in my hands, making my way with difficulty through the tiny, cramped quarters.The deck rose and fell beneath my unaccustomed feet, making it hard to keep my balance.Here, milady, allow me.Fergus swung bare feet out of bed and stood up beside me, staggering and nearly bumping into me as he reached for the basin.You should go and sleep now, milady, he said, taking it from my hands.I will see to him, be assured.Well The thought of my berth was undeniably tempting.It had been a long day.Go, Sassenach, Jamie said.His face was a ghastly white, sheened with sweat in the dim light of the small oil light that burned on the wall.Ill be all right.This was patently untrue; at the same time, it was unlikely that my presence would help particularly.Fergus could do the little that could be done; there was no known cure for seasickness, after all.One could only hope that Jared was right, and that it would ease of itself as the Artemis made its way out into the longer swells of the Atlantic.All right, I said, giving in.Perhaps youll feel better in the morning.Jamie opened one eye for a moment, then groaned, and shivering, closed it again.Or perhaps Ill be dead, he suggested.On that cheery note, I made my way out into the dark companionway, only to stumble over the prostrate form of Mr.Willoughby, curled up against the door of the cabin.He grunted in surprise, then, seeing that it was only me, rolled slowly onto all fours and crawled into the cabin, swaying with the rolling of the ship.Ignoring Ferguss exclamation of distate, he curled himself about the pedestal of the table, and fell promptly back asleep, an expression of beatific content on his small round face.My own cabin was just across the companionway, but I paused for a moment, to breathe in the fresh air coming down from the deck above.There was an extraordinary variety of noises, from the creak and crack of timbers all around, to the snap of sails and the whine of rigging above, and the faint echo of a shout somewhere on deck.Despite the racket and the cold air pouring in down the companionway, Marsali was sound asleep, a humped black shape in one of the two berths.Just as well; at least I neednt try to make awkward conversation with her.Despite myself, I felt a pang of sympathy for her; this was likely not what she had expected of her wedding night.It was too cold to undress; fully clothed, I crawled into my small box berth and lay listening to the sounds of the ship around me.I could hear the hissing of the water passing the hull, only a foot or two beyond my head.It was an oddly comforting sound.To the accompaniment of the song of the wind and the faint sound of retching across the corridor, I fell peacefully asleep.The Artemis was a tidy ship, as ships go, but when you cram thirty two menand two womeninto a space eighty feet long and twenty five wide, together with six tons of rough cured hides, forty two barrels of sulfur, and enough sheets of copper and tin to sheathe the Queen Mary, basic hygiene is bound to suffer.By the second day, I had already flushed a rata small rat, as Fergus pointed out, but still a ratin the hold where I went to retrieve my large medicine box, packed away there by mistake during the loading.There was a soft shuffling noise in my cabin at night, which when the lantern was lit proved to be the footsteps of several dozen middling size cockroaches, all fleeing frantically for the shelter of the shadows.The heads, two small quarter galleries on either side of the ship toward the bow, were nothing more than a pair of boardswith a strategic slot between themsuspended over the bounding waves eight feet below, so that the user was likely to get an unexpected dash of cold seawater at some highly inopportune moment.I suspected that this, coupled with a diet of salt pork and hardtack, likely caused constipation to be epidemic among seamen.Mr.Warren, the ships master, proudly informed me that the decks were swabbed regularly every morning, the brass polished, and everything generally made shipshape, which seemed a desirable state of affairs, given that we were in fact aboard a ship.Still, all the holystoning in the world could not disguise the fact that thirty four human beings occupied this limited space, and only one of us bathed.Given such circumstances, I was more than startled when I opened the door of the galley on the second morning, in search of boiling water.I had expected the same dim and grubby conditions that obtained in the cabins and holds, and was dazzled by the glitter of sunlight through the overhead lattice on a rank of copper pans, so scrubbed that the metal of their bottoms shone pink.I blinked against the dazzle, my eyes adjusting, and saw that the walls of the galley were solid with built in racks and cupboards, so constructed as to be proof against the roughest seas.Blue and green glass bottles of spice, each tenderly jacketed in felt against injury, vibrated softly in their rack above the pots.Knives, cleavers, and skewers gleamed in deadly array, in a quantity sufficient to deal with a whale carcass, should one present itself.A rimmed double shelf hung from the bulkhead, thick with bulb glasses and shallow plates, on which a quantity of fresh cut turnip tops were set to sprout for greens.An enormous pot bubbled softly over the stove, emitting a fragrant steam.And in the midst of all this spotless splendor stood the cook, surveying me with baleful eye.Out, he said.Good morning, I said, as cordially as possible.My name is Claire Fraser.Out, he repeated, in the same graveled tones.I am Mrs.Fraser, the wife of the supercargo, and ships surgeon for this voyage, I said, giving him eyeball for eyeball.I require six gallons of boiling water, when convenient, for cleaning of the head.His small, bright blue eyes grew somewhat smaller and brighter, the black pupils of them training on me like gunbarrels.I am Aloysius OShaughnessy Murphy, he said.Ships cook.And I require ye to take yer feet off my fresh washed deck.I do not allow women in my galley.He glowered at me under the edge of the black cotton kerchief that swathed his head.He was several inches shorter than I, but made up for it by measuring about three feet more in circumference, with a wrestlers shoulders and a head like a cannonball, set upon them without apparent benefit of an intervening neck.A wooden leg completed the ensemble.I took one step back, with dignity, and spoke to him from the relative safety of the passageway.In that case, I said, you may send up the hot water by the messboy.I may, he agreed.And then again, I may not.He turned his broad back on me in dismissal, busying himself with a chopping block, a cleaver, and a joint of mutton.I stood in the passageway for a moment, thinking.The thud of the cleaver sounded regularly against the wood.Mr.Murphy reached up to his spice rack, grasped a bottle without looking, and sprinkled a good quantity of the contents over the diced meat.The dusty scent of sage filled the air, superseded at once by the pungency of an onion, whacked in two with a casual swipe of the cleaver and tossed into the mixture.Evidently the crew of the Artemis did not subsist entirely upon salt pork and hardtack, then.I began to understand the reasons for Captain Rainess rather pear shaped physique.I poked my head back through the door, taking care to stand outside.Cardamom, I said firmly.Nutmeg, whole.Dried this year.Fresh extract of anise.Ginger root, two large ones, with no blemishes.I paused.Mr.Murphy had stopped chopping, cleaver poised motionless above the block.And, I added, half a dozen whole vanilla beans.From Ceylon.He turned slowly, wiping his hands upon his leather apron.Unlike his surroundings, neither the apron nor his other apparel was spotless.He had a broad, florid face, edged with stiff sandy whiskers like a scrubbing brush, which quivered slightly as he looked at me, like the antennae of some large insect.His tongue darted out to lick pursed lips.Saffron?he asked hoarsely.Half an ounce, I said promptly, taking care to conceal any trace of triumph in my manner.He breathed in deeply, lust gleaming bright in his small blue eyes.Yell find a mat just outside, maam, should ye care to wipe yer boots and come in.One head sterilized within the limits of boiling water and Ferguss tolerance, I made my way back to my cabin to clean up for luncheon.Marsali was not there; she was undoubtedly attending to Fergus, whose labors at my insistence had been little short of heroic.I rinsed my own hands with alcohol, brushed my hair, and then went across the passage to see whetherby some wild chanceJamie wanted anything to eat or drink.One glance disabused me of this notion.Marsali and I had been given the largest cabin, which meant that each of us had approximately six square feet of space, not including the beds.These were box berths, a sort of enclosed bed built into the wall, about five and a half feet long.Marsali fitted neatly into hers, but I was forced to adopt a slightly curled position, like a caper on toast, which caused me to wake up with pins and needles in my feet.Jamie and Fergus had similar berths.Jamie was lying on his side, wedged into one of these like a snail into its shell; one of which beasts he strongly resembled at the moment, being a pale and viscid gray in color, with streaks of green and yellow that contrasted nastily with his red hair.He opened one eye when he heard me come in, regarded me dimly for a moment, and closed it again.Not so good, hm?I said sympathetically.The eye opened again, and he seemed to be preparing to say something.He opened his mouth, changed his mind, and closed it again.No, he said, and shut the eye once more.I tentatively smoothed his hair, but he seemed too sunk in misery to notice.Captain Raines says it will likely be calmer by tomorrow, I offered.The sea wasnt terribly rough as it was, but there was a noticeable rise and fall.It doesna matter, he said, not opening his eyes.I shall be dead by thenor at least I hope so.Afraid not, I said, shaking my head.Nobody dies of seasickness; though I must say it seems a wonder that they dont, looking at you.Not that.He opened his eyes, and struggled up on one elbow, an effort that left him clammy with sweat and white to the lips.Claire.Be careful.I should have told ye beforebut I didna want to worry ye, and I thought His face changed.Familiar as I was with expressions of bodily infirmity, I had the basin there just in time.Oh, God.He lay limp and exhausted, pale as the sheet.What should you have told me?I asked, wrinkling my nose as I put the basin on the floor near the door.Whatever it was, you should have told me before we sailed, but its too late to think of that.I didna think it would be so bad, he murmured.You never do, I said, rather tartly.What did you want to tell me, though?Ask Fergus, he said.Say I said he must tell ye.And tell him Innes is all right.What are you talking about?I was mildly alarmed; delirium wasnt a common effect of seasickness.His eyes opened, and fixed on mine with great effort.Beads of sweat stood out on his brow and upper lip.Innes, he said.He canna be the one.He doesna mean to kill me.A small shiver ran up my spine.Are you quite all right, Jamie?I asked.I bent and wiped his face, and he gave me the ghost of an exhausted smile.He had no fever, and his eyes were clear.Who?I said carefully, with a sudden feeling that there were eyes fixed on my back.Who does mean to kill you?I dont know.A passing spasm contorted his features, but he clamped his lips tight, and managed to subdue it.Ask Fergus, he whispered, when he could talk again.In private.Hell tell ye.I felt exceedingly helpless.I had no notion what he was talking about, but if there was any danger, I wasnt about to leave him alone.Ill wait until he comes down, I said.One hand was curled near his nose.It straightened slowly and slid under the pillow, coming out with his dirk, which he clasped to his chest.I shall be all right, he said.Go on, then, Sassenach.I shouldna think theyd try anything in daylight.If at all.I didnt find this reassuring in the slightest, but there seemed nothing else to do.He lay quite still, the dirk held to his chest like a stone tomb figure.Go, he murmured again, his lips barely moving.Just outside the cabin door, something stirred in the shadows at the end of the passage.Peering sharply, I made out the crouched silk shape of Mr.Willoughby, chin resting on his knees.He spread his knees apart, and bowed his head politely between them.Not worry, honorable First Wife, he assured me in a sibilant whisper.I watch.Good, I said, keep doing it.And went, in considerable distress of mind, to find Fergus.Fergus, found with Marsali on the after deck, peering into the ships wake at several large white birds, was somewhat more reassuring.We are not sure that anyone intends actually to kill milord, he explained.The casks in the warehouse might have been an accidentI have seen such things happen more than onceand likewise the fire in the shed, but  Wait one minute, young Fergus, I said, gripping him by the sleeve.What casks, and what fire?Oh, he said, looking surprised.Milord did not tell you?Milord is sick as a dog, and incapable of telling me anything more than that I should ask you.Fergus shook his head, clicking his tongue in a censorious French way.He never thinks he will be so ill, he said.He always is, and yet every time he must set foot on a ship, he insists that it is only a matter of will; his mind will be master, and he will not allow his stomach to be dictating his actions.Then within ten feet of the dock, he has turned green.He never told me that, I said, amused at this description.Stubborn little fool.Marsali had been hanging back behind Fergus with an air of haughty reserve, pretending that I wasnt there.At this unexpected description of Jamie, though, she was surprised into a brief snort of laughter.She caught my eye and turned hastily away, cheeks flaming, to stare out to sea.Fergus smiled and shrugged.You know what he is like, milady, he said, with tolerant affection.He could be dying, and one would never know.Youd know if you went down and looked at him now, I said tartly.At the same time, I was conscious of surprise, accompanied by a faint feeling of warmth in the pit of my stomach.Fergus had been with Jamie almost daily for twenty years, and still Jamie would not admit to him the weakness that he would readily let me see.Were he dying, I would know about it, all right.Men, I said, shaking my head.Milady?Never mind, I said.You were telling me about casks and fires.Oh, indeed, yes.Fergus brushed back his thick shock of black hair with his hook.It was the day before I met you again, milady, at Madame Jeannes.The day I had returned to Edinburgh, no more than a few hours before I had found Jamie at the printshop.He had been at the Burntisland docks with Fergus and a gang of six men during the night, taking advantage of the late dawn of winter to retrieve several casks of unbonded Madeira, smuggled in among a shipment of innocent flour.Madeira does not soak through the wood so quickly as some other wines do, Fergus explained.You cannot bring in brandy under the noses of the Customs like that, for the dogs will smell it at once, even if their masters do not.But not Madeira, provided it has been freshly casked.Dogs?Some of the Customs inspectors have dogs, milady, trained to smell out such contraband as tobacco and brandy.He waved away the interruption, squinting his eyes against the brisk sea wind.We had removed the Madeira safely, and brought it to the warehouseone of those belonging apparently to Lord Dundas, but in fact it belongs jointly to milord and Madame Jeanne.Indeed, I said, again with that minor dip of the stomach I had felt when Jamie opened the door of the brothel on Queen Street.Partners, are they?Well, of a sort.Fergus sounded regretful.Milord has only a five percent share, in return for his finding the place, and making the arrangements.Printing as an occupation is much less profitable than keeping a htel de joie.Marsali didnt look round, but I thought her shoulders stiffened further.I daresay, I said.Edinburgh and Madame Jeanne were a long way behind us, after all.Get on with the story.Someone may cut Jamies throat before I find out why.Of course, milady.Fergus bobbed his head apologetically.The contraband had been safely hidden, awaiting disguise and sale, and the smugglers had paused to refresh themselves with a drink in lieu of breakfast, before making their way home in the brightening dawn.Two of the men had asked for their shares at once, needing the money to pay gaming debts and buy food for their families.Jamie agreeing to this, he had gone across to the warehouse office, where some gold was kept.As the men relaxed over their whisky in a corner of the warehouse, their joking and laughter was interrupted by a sudden vibration that shook the floor beneath their feet.Come down!shouted MacLeod, an experienced warehouseman, and the men had dived for cover, even before they had seen the great rack of hogsheads near the office quiver and rumble, one two ton cask rolling down the stack with ponderous grace, to smash in an aromatic lake of ale, followed within seconds by a cascade of its monstrous fellows.Milord was crossing in front of the rank, Fergus said, shaking his head.It was only by the grace of the Blessed Virgin herself that he was not crushed.A bounding cask had missed him by inches, in fact, and he had escaped another only by diving headfirst out of its way and under an empty wine rack that had deflected its course.As I say, such things happen often, Fergus said, shrugging.A dozen men are killed each year in such accidents, in the warehouses near Edinburgh alone.But with the other things  The week before the incident of the casks, a small shed full of packing straw had burst into flames while Jamie was working in it.A lantern placed between him and the door had apparently fallen over, setting the straw alight and trapping Jamie in the windowless shed, behind a sudden wall of flame.The shed was fortunately of a most flimsy construction, and the boards half rotted.It went up like matchwood, but milord was able to kick a hole in the back wall and crawl out, with no injury.We thought at first that the lantern had merely fallen of its own accord, and were most grateful for his escape.It was only later that milord told me he thought that he had heard a noiseperhaps a shot, perhaps only the cracking noises an old warehouse makes as its boards settleand when he turned to see, found the flames shooting up before him.Fergus sighed.He looked rather tired, and I wondered whether perhaps he had stayed awake to stand watch over Jamie during the night.So, he said, shrugging once more.We do not know.Such incidents may have been no more than accidentthey may not.But taking such occurrences together with what happened at Arbroath  You may have a traitor among the smugglers, I said.Just so, milady.Fergus scratched his head.But what is more disturbing to milord is the man whom the Chinaman shot at Madame Jeannes.Because you think he was a Customs agent, whod tracked Jamie from the docks to the brothel?Jamie said he couldnt be, because he had no warrant.Not proof, Fergus noted.But worse, the booklet he had in his pocket.The New Testament?I saw no particular relevance to that, and said so.Oh, but there is, miladyor might be, I should say, Fergus corrected himself.You see, the booklet was one that milord himself had printed.I see, I said slowly, or at least Im beginning to.Fergus nodded gravely.To have the Customs trace brandy from the points of delivery to the brothel would be bad, of course, but not fatalanother hiding place could be found; in fact, milord has arrangements with the owners of two taverns thatbut that is of no matter.He waved it away.But to have the agents of the Crown connect the notorious smuggler Jamie Roy with the respectable Mr.Malcolm of Carfax Close He spread his hands wide.You see?I did.Were the Customs to get too close to his smuggling operations, Jamie could merely disperse his assistants, cease frequenting his smugglers haunts, and disappear for a time, retreating into his guise as a printer until it seemed safe to resume his illegal activities.But to have his two identities both detected and merged was not only to deprive him of both his sources of income, but to arouse such suspicion as might lead to discovery of his real name, his seditious activities, and thence to Lallybroch and his history as rebel and convicted traitor.They would have evidence to hang him a dozen timesand once was enough.I certainly do see.So Jamie wasnt only worried about Laoghaire and Hobart MacKenzie, when he told Ian he thought it would be as well for us to skip to France for a bit.Paradoxically, I felt somewhat relieved by Ferguss revelations.At least I hadnt been single handedly responsible for Jamies exile.My reappearance might have precipitated the crisis with Laoghaire, but I had had nothing to do with any of this.Exactly, milady.And still, we do not know for certain that one of the men has betrayed usor whether, even if there should be a traitor among them, he should wish to kill milord.Thats a point.It was, but not a large one.If one of the smugglers had undertaken to betray Jamie for money, that was one thing.If it was for some motive of personal vengeance, though, the man might well feel compelled to take matters into his own hands, now that we weretemporarily, at leastout of reach of the Kings Customs.If so, Fergus was continuing, it will be one of six menthe six milord sent me to collect, to sail with us.These six were present both when the casks fell, and when the shed caught fire; all have been to the brothel.He paused.And all of them were present on the road at Arbroath, when we were ambushed, and found the exciseman hanged.Do they all know about the printshop?Oh, no, milady!Milord has always been most careful to let none of the smuggling men know of thatbut it is always possible that one of them shall have seen him on the streets in Edinburgh, followed him to Carfax Close, and so learned of A.  Malcolm.He smiled wryly.Milord is not the most inconspicuous of men, milady.Very true, I said, matching his tone.But now all of them know Jamies real nameCaptain Raines calls him Fraser.Yes, he said, with a faint, grim smile.That is why we must discover whether we do indeed sail with a traitorand who it is.Looking at him, it occurred to me for the first time that Fergus was indeed a grown man nowand a dangerous one.I had known him as an eager, squirrel toothed boy of ten, and to me, something of that boy would always remain in his face.But some time had passed since he had been a Paris street urchin.Marsali had remained staring out to sea during most of this discussion, preferring to take no risk of having to converse with me.She had obviously been listening, though, and now I saw a shiver pass through her thin shoulderswhether of cold or apprehension, I couldnt tell.She likely hadnt planned on shipping with a potential murderer when she had agreed to elope with Fergus.Youd better take Marsali below, I said to Fergus.Shes going blue round the edges.Dont worry, I said to Marsali, in a cool voice, I shant be in the cabin for some time.Where are you going, milady?Fergus was squinting at me, slightly suspicious.Milord will not wish you to be  I dont mean to, I assured him.Im going to the galley.The galley?His fine black brows shot up.To see whether Aloysius OShaughnessy Murphy has anything to suggest for seasickness, I said.If we dont get Jamie back on his feet, he isnt going to care whether anyone cuts his throat or not.Murphy, sweetened by an ounce of dried orange peel and a bottle of Jareds best claret, was quite willing to oblige.In fact, he seemed to consider the problem of keeping food in Jamies stomach something of a professional challenge, and spent hours in mystic contemplation of his spice rack and pantriesall to no avail.We encountered no storms, but the winter winds drove a heavy swell before them, and the Artemis rose and fell ten feet at a time, laboring up and down the great glassy peaks of the waves.There were times, watching the hypnotic rise and lurch of the taffrail against the horizon, when I felt a few interior qualms of my own, and turned hastily away.Jamie showed no signs of being about to fulfill Jareds heartening prophecy and spring to his feet, suddenly accustomed to the motion.He remained in his berth, the color of rancid custard, moving only to stagger to the head, and guarded in turns day and night by Mr.Willoughby and Fergus.On the positive side of things, none of the six smugglers made any move that might be considered threatening.All expressed a sympathetic concern for Jamies welfare, andcarefully watchedall had visited him briefly in his cabin, with no suspicious circumstances attending.For my part, I spent the days in exploring the ship, attending to such small medical emergencies as arose from the daily business of sailinga smashed finger, a cracked rib, bleeding gums and an abscessed toothand pounding herbs and making medicines in a corner of the galley, allowed to work there by Murphys grace.Marsali was absent from our shared cabin when I rose, already asleep when I returned to it, and silently hostile when the cramped confines of shipboard forced us to meet on deck or over meals.I assumed that the hostility was in part the result of her natural feelings for her mother, and in part the result of frustration over passing her night hours in my company, rather than Ferguss.For that matter, if she remained untouchedand judging from her sullen demeanor, I was reasonably sure she didit was owing entirely to Ferguss respect for Jamies dictates.In terms of his role as guardian of his stepdaughters virtue, Jamie himself was a negligible force at the moment.Wot, not the broth, too?Murphy said.The cooks broad red face lowered menacingly.Which Ive had folk rise from their deathbeds after a sup of that broth!He took the pannikin of broth from Fergus, sniffed at it critically, and thrust it under my nose.Here, smell that, missus.Marrow bones, garlic, caraway seed, and a lump o pork fat to flavor, all strained careful through muslin, same as some folks bein poorly to their stomachs cant abide chunks, but chunks youll not find there, not a one!The broth was in fact a clear golden brown, with an appetizing smell that made my own mouth water, despite the excellent breakfast I had made less than an hour before.Captain Raines had a delicate stomach, and in consequence had taken some pains both in the procurement of a cook and the provisioning of the galley, to the benefit of the officers table.Murphy, with a wooden leg and the general dimensions of a rum cask, looked the picture of a thoroughgoing pirate, but in fact had a reputation as the best sea cook in Le Havreas he had told me himself, without the least boastfulness.He considered cases of seasickness a challenge to his skill, and Jamie, still prostrate after four days, was a particular affront to him.Im sure its wonderful broth, I assured him.Its just that he cant keep anything down.Murphy grunted dubiously, but turned and carefully poured the remains of the broth into one of the numerous kettles that steamed day and night over the galley fire.Scowling horribly and running one hand through the wisps of his scanty blond hair, he opened a cupboard and closed it, then bent to rummage through a chest of provisions, muttering under his breath.A bit o hardtack, maybe?he muttered.Dry, thats whats wanted.Maybe a whiff o vinegar, though; tart pickle, say  I watched in fascination as the cooks huge, sausage fingered hands flicked deftly through the stock of provisions, plucking dainties and assembling them swiftly on a tray.Ere, lets try this, then, he said, handing me the finished tray.Let im suck on the pickled gherkins, but dont let im bite em yet.Then follow on with a bite of the plain hardtackthere aint no weevils in it yet, I dont thinkbut see as he dont drink water with it.Then a bite of gherkin, well chewed, to make the spittle flow, a bite of hardtack, and so to go on with.That much stayin down, then, we can proceed to the custard; which its fresh made last evening for the Captains supper.Then if that sticks His voice followed me out of the galley, continuing the catalogue of available nourishment.milk toast, which its made with goats milk, and fresh milked, too  syllabub beat up well with whisky and a nice egg boomed down the passageway as I negotiated the narrow turn with the loaded tray, carefully stepping over Mr.Willoughby, who was as usual crouched in a corner of the passage by Jamies door like a small blue lapdog.One step inside the cabin, though, I could see that the exercise of Murphys culinary skill was going to be once again in vain.In the usual fashion of a man feeling unwell, Jamie had managed to arrange his surroundings to be as depressing and uncomfortable as possible.The tiny cabin was dank and squalid, the cramped berth covered with a cloth so as to exclude both light and air, and half piled with a tangle of clammy blankets and unwashed clothes.Rise and shine, I said cheerfully.I set down the tray and pulled off the makeshift curtain, which appeared to be one of Ferguss shirts.What light there was came from a large prism embedded in the deck overhead.It struck the berth, illuminating a countenance of ghastly pallor and baleful mien.He opened one eye an eighth of an inch.Go away, he said, and shut it again.Ive brought you some breakfast, I said firmly.The eye opened again, coldly blue and gelid.Dinna mention the word breakfast to me, he said.Call it luncheon then, I said.Its late enough.I pulled up a stool next to him, picked a gherkin from the tray, and held it invitingly under his nose.Youre supposed to suck on it, I told him.Slowly, the other eye opened.He said nothing, but the pair of blue orbs swiveled around, resting on me with an expression of such ferocious eloquence that I hastily withdrew the pickle.The eyelids drooped slowly shut once more.I surveyed the wreckage, frowning.He lay on his back, his knees drawn up.While the built in berth provided more stability for the sleeper than the crews swinging hammocks, it was designed to accommodate the usual run of passengers, whojudging from the size of the berthwere assumed to be no more than a modest five feet three or so.You cant be at all comfortable in there, I said.I am not.Would you like to try a hammock instead?At least you could stretch  I would not.The captain says he requires a list of the cargo from youat your convenience.He made a brief and unrepeatable suggestion as to what Captain Raines might do with his list, not bothering to open his eyes.I sighed, and picked up his unresisting hand.It was cold and damp, and his pulse was fast.Well, I said after a pause.Perhaps we could try something I used to do with surgical patients.It seemed to help sometimes.He gave a low groan, but didnt object.I pulled up a stool and sat down, still holding his hand.I had developed the habit of talking with the patients for a few minutes before they were taken to surgery.My presence seemed to reassure them, and I had found that if I could fix their attention on something beyond the impending ordeal, they seemed to do betterthere was less bleeding, the postanesthetic nausea was less, and they seemed to heal better.I had seen it happen often enough to believe that it was not imagination; Jamie hadnt been altogether wrong when assuring Fergus that the power of mind over flesh was possible.Lets think of something pleasant, I said, pitching my voice to be as low and soothing as possible.Think of Lallybroch, of the hillside above the house.Think of the pine trees therecan you smell the needles?Think of the smoke coming up from the kitchen chimney on a clear day, and an apple in your hand.Think about how it feels in your hand, all hard and smooth, and then  Sassenach?Both Jamies eyes were open, and fixed on me in intense concentration.Sweat gleamed in the hollow of his temples.Yes?Go away.What?Go away, he repeated, very gently, or I shall break your neck.Go away now.I rose with dignity and went out.Mr.Willoughby was leaning against an upright in the passage, peering thoughtfully into the cabin.Dont have those stone balls with you, do you?I asked.Yes, he answered, looking surprised.Wanting healthy balls for Tseimi?He began to fumble in his sleeve, but I stopped him with a gesture.What I want to do is bash him on the head with them, but I suppose Hippocrates would frown on that.Mr.Willoughby smiled uncertainly and bobbed his head several times in an effort to express appreciation of whatever I thought I meant.Never mind, I said.I glared back over my shoulder at the heap of reeking bedclothes.It stirred slightly, and a groping hand emerged, patting gingerly around the floor until it found the basin that stood there.Grasping this, the hand disappeared into the murky depths of the berth, from which presently emerged the sound of dry retching.Bloody man!I said, exasperation mingled with pityand a slight feeling of alarm.The ten hours of a Channel crossing were one thing; what would his state be like after two months of this?Head of pig, Mr.Willoughby agreed, with a lugubrious nod.He is rat, you think, or maybe dragon?He smells like a whole zoo, I said.Why dragon, though?One is born in Year of Dragon, Year of Rat, Year of Sheep, Year of Horse, Mr.Willoughby explained.Being different, each year, different people.You are knowing is Tsei mi rat, or dragon?You mean which year was he born in?I had vague memories of the menus in Chinese restaurants, decorated with the animals of the Chinese zodiac, with explanations of the supposed character traits of those born in each year.It was 1721, but I dont know offhand which animal that was the year of.I am thinking rat, said Mr.Willoughby, looking thoughtfully at the tangle of bedclothes, which were heaving in a mildly agitated manner.Rat very clever, very lucky.But dragon, too, could be.He is most lusty in bed, Tsei mi?Dragons most passionate people.Not so as you would notice lately, I said, watching the heap of bed clothes out of the corner of my eye.It heaved upward and fell back, as though the contents had turned over suddenly.I have Chinese medicine, Mr.Willoughby said, observing this phenomenon thoughtfully.Good for vomit, stomach, head, all making most peaceful and serene.I looked at him with interest.Really?Id like to see that.Have you tried it on Jamie yet?The little Chinese shook his head regretfully.Not want, he replied.Say damn all, throwing overboard if I am come near.Mr.Willoughby and I looked at each other with a perfect understanding.You know, I said, raising my voice a decibel or two, prolonged dry retching is very bad for a person.Oh, most bad, yes.Mr.Willoughby had shaved the forward part of his skull that morning; the bald curve shone as he nodded vigorously.It erodes the stomach tissues, and irritates the esophagus.This is so?Quite so.It raises the blood pressure and strains the abdominal muscles, too.Can even tear them, and cause a hernia.Ah.And, I continued, raising my voice just a trifle, it can cause the testicles to become tangled round each other inside the scrotum, and cuts off the circulation there.Ooh!Mr.Willoughbys eyes went round.If that happens, I said ominously, the only thing to do, usually, is to amputate before gangrene sets in.Mr.Willoughby made a hissing sound indicative of understanding and deep shock.The heap of bedclothes, which had been tossing to and fro in a restless manner during this conversation, was quite still.I looked at Mr.Willoughby.He shrugged.I folded my arms and waited.After a minute, a long foot, elegantly bare, was extruded from the bedclothes.A moment later, its fellow joined it, resting on the floor.Damn the pair of ye, said a deep Scottish voice, in tones of extreme malevolence.Come in, then.Fergus and Marsali were leaning over the aft rail, cozily shoulder to shoulder, Ferguss arm about the girls waist, her long fair hair fluttering in the wind.Hearing approaching footsteps, Fergus glanced back over his shoulder.Then he gasped, whirled round, and crossed himself, eyes bulging.Notoneword, if ye please, Jamie said between clenched teeth.Fergus opened his mouth, but nothing came out.Marsali, turning to look too, emitted a shrill scream.Da!Whats happened to ye?The obvious fright and concern in her face stopped Jamie from whatever acerbic remark he had been about to make.His face relaxed slightly, making the slender gold needles that protruded from behind his ears twitch like ants feelers.Its all right, he said gruffly.Its only some rubbish of the Chinees, to cure the puking.Wide eyed, Marsali came up to him, gingerly extending a finger to touch the needles embedded in the flesh of his wrist below the palm.Three more flashed from the inside of his leg, a few inches above the ankle.Doesdoes it work?she asked.How does it feel?Jamies mouth twitched, his normal sense of humor beginning to reassert itself.I feel like a bloody ill wish doll that someones been poking full o pins, he said.But then I havena vomited in the last quarter hour, so I suppose it must work.He shot a quick glare at me and Mr.Willoughby, standing side by side near the rail.Mind ye, he said, I dinna feel like sucking on gherkins just yet, but I could maybe go so far as to relish a glass of ale, if ye mind where some might be found, Fergus.Oh.Oh, yes, milord.If you will come with me?Unable to refrain from staring, Fergus reached out a tentative hand to take Jamies arm, but thinking better of it, turned in the direction of the after gangway.Shall I tell Murphy to start cooking your luncheon?I called after Jamie as he turned to follow Fergus.He gave me a long, level look over one shoulder.The golden needles sprouted through his hair in twin bunches, gleaming in the morning light like a pair of devils horns.Dinna try me too high, Sassenach, he said.Im no going to forget, ye ken.Tangled testiclespah!Mr.Willoughby had been ignoring this exchange, squatting on his heels in the shadow of the aft deck scuttlebutt, a large barrel filled with water for refreshment of the deck watch.He was counting on his fingers, evidently absorbed in some kind of calculation.As Jamie stalked away, he looked up.Not rat, he said, shaking his head.Not dragon, too.Tsei mi born in Year of Ox.Really?I said, looking after the broad shoulders and red head, lowered stubbornly against the wind.How appropriate.42  THE MAN IN THE MOON  As his title suggested, Jamies job as supercargo was not onerous.Beyond checking the contents of the hold against the bills of lading to insure that the Artemis was in fact carrying the requisite quantities of hides, tin, and sulfur, there was nothing for him to do while at sea.His duties would begin once we reached Jamaica, when the cargo must be unloaded, rechecked, and sold, with the requisite taxes paid, commissions deducted, and paperwork filed.In the meantime, there was little for himor meto do.While Mr.Picard, the bosun, eyed Jamies powerful frame covetously, it was obvious that he would never make a seaman.Quick and agile as any of the crew, his ignorance of ropes and sails made him useless for anything beyond the occasional situation where sheer strength was required.It was plain he was a soldier, not a sailor.He did assist with enthusiasm at the gunnery practice that was held every other day, helping to run the four huge guns on their carriages in and out with a tremendous racket, and spending hours in rapt discussion of esoteric cannon lore with Tom Sturgis, the gunner.During these thunderous exercises, Marsali, Mr.Willoughby, and I sat safely out of the way under the care of Fergus, who was excluded from the fireworks because of his missing hand.Somewhat to my surprise, I had been accepted as the ships surgeon with little question from the crew.It was Fergus who explained that in small merchant ships, even barber surgeons were uncommon.It was commonly the gunners wifeif he had onewho dealt with the small injuries and illnesses of the crew.I saw the normal run of crushed fingers, burnt hands, skin infections, abscessed teeth, and digestive ills, but in a crew of only thirty two men, there was seldom enough work to keep me busy beyond the hour of sick call each morning.In consequence, both Jamie and I had a great deal of free time.And, as the Artemis drew gradually south into the great gyre of the Atlantic, we began to spend most of this time with each other.For the first time since my return to Edinburgh, there was time to talk; to relearn all the half forgotten things we knew of each other, to find out the new facets that experience had polished, and simply to take pleasure in each others presence, without the distractions of danger and daily life.We strolled the deck constantly, up and down, marking off miles as we conversed of everything and nothing, pointing out to each other the phenomena of a sea voyage; the spectacular sunrises and sunsets, schools of strange green and silver fish, enormous islands of floating seaweed, harboring thousands of tiny crabs and jellyfish, the sleek dolphins that appeared for several days in a row, swimming parallel with the ship, leaping out of the water now and then, as though to get a look at the curious creatures above the water.The moon rose huge and fast and golden, a great glowing disc that slid upward, out of the water and into the sky like a phoenix rising.The water was dark now, and the dolphins invisible, but I thought somehow that they were still there, keeping pace with the ship on her flight through the dark.It was a scene breathtaking enough even for the sailors, who had seen it a thousand times, to stop and sigh with pleasure at the sight, as the huge orb rose to hang just over the edge of the world, seeming almost near enough to touch.Jamie and I stood close together by the rail, admiring it.It seemed so close that we could make out with ease the dark spots and shadows on its surface.It seems so close ye could speak to the Man in the Moon, he said, smiling, and waved a hand in greeting to the dreaming golden face above.The weeping Pleiads wester / and the moon is under seas, I quoted.And look, it is, down there, too.I pointed over the rail, to where the trail of moonlight deepened, glowing in the water as though a twin of the moon itself were sunken there.When I left, I said, men were getting ready to fly to the moon.I wonder whether theyll make it.Do the flying machines go so high, then?Jamie asked.He squinted at the moon.I should say its a great way, for all it looks so close just now.I read a book by an astronomerhe said it was perhaps three hundred leagues from the earth to the moon.Is he wrong, then, or is it only that theairplanes, was it?will fly so far?It takes a special kind, called a rocket, I said.Actually, its a lot farther than that to the moon, and once you get far away from the earth, theres no air to breathe in space.Theyll have to carry air with them on the voyage, like food and water.They put it in sort of canisters.Really?He gazed up, face full of light and wonder.What will it look like there, I wonder?I know that, I said.Ive seen pictures.Its rocky, and barren, with no life at allbut very beautiful, with cliffs and mountains and cratersyou can see the craters from here; the dark spots.I nodded toward the smiling moon, then smiled at Jamie myself.Its not unlike Scotlandexcept that it isnt green.He laughed, then evidently reminded by the word pictures, reached into his coat and drew out the little packet of photographs.He was cautious about them, never taking them out where they might be seen by anyone, even Fergus, but we were alone back here, with little chance of interruption.The moon was bright enough to see Briannas face, glowing and mutable, as he thumbed slowly through the pictures.The edges were becoming frayed, I saw.Will she walk about on the moon, dye think?he asked softly, pausing at a shot of Bree looking out a window, secretly dreaming, unaware of being photographed.He glanced up again at the orb above us, and I realized that for him, a voyage to the moon seemed very little more difficult or farfetched than the one in which we were engaged.The moon, after all, was only another distant, unknown place.I dont know, I said, smiling a bit.He thumbed through the pictures slowly, absorbed as he always was by the sight of his daughters face, so like his own.I watched him quietly, sharing his silent joy at this promise of our immortality.I thought briefly of that stone in Scotland, engraved with his name, and took comfort from its distance.Whenever our parting might come, chances were it would not be soon.And even when and where it didBrianna would still be left of us.More of Housmans lines drifted through my headHalt by the headstone naming / The heart no longer stirred, / And say the lad that loved you / Was one that kept his word.I drew close to him, feeling the heat of his body through coat and shirt, and rested my head against his arm as he turned slowly through the small stack of photographs.She is beautiful, he murmured, as he did every time he saw the pictures.And clever, too, did ye not say?Just like her father, I told him, and felt him chuckle softly.I felt him stiffen slightly as he turned one picture over, and lifted my head to see which one he was looking at.It was one taken at the beach, when Brianna was about sixteen.It showed her standing thigh deep in the surf, hair in a sandy tangle, kicking water at her friend, a boy named Rodney, who was backing away, laughing too, hands held up against the spray of water.Jamie frowned slightly, lips pursed.That he began.Do they He paused and cleared his throat.I wouldna venture to criticize, Claire, he said, very carefully, but do ye not think this is a wee bitindecent?I suppressed an urge to laugh.No, I said, composedly.Thats really quite a modest bathing suitfor the time.While the suit in question was a bikini, it was by no means skimpy, rising to at least an inch below Brees navel.I chose this picture because I thought youd want to ersee as much of her as possible.He looked mildly scandalized at this thought, but his eyes returned to the picture, drawn irresistibly.His face softened as he looked at her.Aye, well, he said.Aye, shes verra lovely, and Im glad to know it.He lifted the picture, studying it carefully.No, its no the thing shes wearing I meant; most women who bathe outside do it naked, and their skins are no shame to them.Its onlythis lad.Surely she shouldna be standing almost naked before a man?He scowled at the hapless Rodney, and I bit my lip at the thought of the scrawny little boy, whom I knew very well, as a masculine threat to maidenly purity.Well, I said, drawing a deep breath.We were on slightly delicate ground here.No.I mean, boys and girls do play togetherlike that.You know people dress differently then; Ive told you.No ones really covered up a great deal except when the weathers cold.Mmphm, he said.Aye, yeve told me.He managed to convey the distinct impression that on the basis of what Id told him, he was not impressed with the moral conditions under which his daughter was living.He scowled at the picture again, and I thought it was fortunate that neither Bree nor Rodney was present.I had seen Jamie as lover, husband, brother, uncle, laird, and warrior, but never before in his guise as a ferocious Scottish father.He was quite formidable.For the first time, I thought that perhaps it was not altogether a bad thing that he wasnt able to oversee Brees life personally; he would have frightened the living daylights out of any lad bold enough to try to court her.Jamie blinked at the picture once or twice, then took a deep breath, and I could feel him brace himself to ask.Dye think she isa virgin?The halt in his voice was barely perceptible, but I caught it.Of course she is, I said firmly.I thought it very likely, in fact, but this wasnt a situation in which to admit the possibility of doubt.There were things I could explain to Jamie about my own time, but the idea of sexual freedom wasnt one of them.Oh.The relief in his voice was inexpressible, and I bit my lip to keep from laughing.Aye, well, I was sure of it, only Ithat is He stopped and swallowed.Brees a very good girl, I said.I squeezed his arm lightly.Frank and I may not have got on so well together, but we were both good parents to her, if I do say so.Aye, I know ye were.I didna mean to say otherwise.He had the grace to look abashed, and tucked the beach picture carefully back into the packet.He put the pictures back into his pocket, patting them to be sure they were safe.He stood looking up at the moon, then, his brows drew together in a slight frown.The sea wind lifted strands of his hair, tugging them loose from the ribbon that bound it, and he brushed them back absentmindedly.Clearly there was still something on his mind.Do ye think, he began slowly, not looking at me.Do ye think that it was quite wise to come to me now, Claire?Not that I dinna want ye, he added hastily, feeling me stiffen beside him.He caught my hand, preventing my turning away.No, I didna mean that at all!Christ, I do want ye!He drew me closer, pressing my hand in his against his heart.I want ye so badly that sometimes I think my heart will burst wi the joy of having ye, he added more softly.Its onlyBriannas alone now.Frank is gone, and you.She has no husband to protect her, no men of her family to see her safely wed.Will she not have need of ye awhile yet?Should ye no have waited a bit, I mean?I paused before answering, trying to get my own feelings under control.I dont know, I said at last; my voice quivered, in spite of my struggle to control it.Lookthings arent the same then.I know that!You dont!I pulled my hand loose, and glared at him.You dont know, Jamie, and there isnt any way for me to tell you, because you wont believe me.But Brees a grown woman; shell marry when and as she likes, not when someone arranges it for her.She doesnt need to marry, for that matter.Shes having a good education; she can earn her own livingwomen do that.She wont have to have a man to protect her  And if theres no need for a man to protect a woman, and care for her, then I think it will be a verra poor time!He glared back at me.I drew a deep breath, trying to be calm.I didnt say theres no need for it.I placed a hand on his shoulder, and spoke in a softer tone.I said, she can choose.She neednt take a man out of necessity; she can take one for love.His face began to relax, just slightly.You took me from need, he said.When we wed.And I came back for love, I said.Do you think I needed you any less, only because I could feed myself?The lines of his face eased, and the shoulder under my hand relaxed a bit as he searched my face.No, he said softly.I dinna think that.He put his arm around me and drew me close.I put my arms around his waist and held him, feeling the small flat patch of Briannas pictures in his pocket under my cheek.I did worry about leaving her, I whispered, a little later.She made me go; we were afraid that if I waited longer, I might not be able to find you.But I did worry.I know.I shouldna ha said anything.He brushed my curls away from his chin, smoothing them down.I left her a letter, I said.It was all I could think to doknowing I mightmight not see her again.I pressed my lips tight together and swallowed hard.His fingertips stroked my back, very softly.Aye?That was good, Sassenach.What did ye say to her?I laughed, a little shakily.Everything I could think of.Motherly advice and wisdomwhat I had of it.All the practical thingswhere the deed to the house and the family papers were.And everything I knew or could think of, about how to live.I expect shell ignore it all, and have a wonderful lifebut at least shell know I thought about her.It had taken me nearly a week, going through the cupboards and desk drawers of the house in Boston, finding all of the business papers, the bankbooks and mortgage papers and the family things.There were a good many bits and pieces of Franks family lying about; huge scrapbooks and dozens of genealogy charts, albums of photographs, cartons of saved letters.My side of the family was a good deal simpler to sum up.I lifted down the box I kept on the shelf of my closet.It was a small box.Uncle Lambert was a saver, as all scholars are, but there had been little to save.The essential documents of a small familybirth certificates, mine and my parents, their marriage lines, the registration for the car that had killed themwhat ironic whim had prompted Uncle Lamb to save that?More likely he had never opened the box, but only kept it, in a scholars blind faith that information must never be destroyed, for who knew what use it might be, and to whom?I had seen its contents before, of course.There had been a period in my teens when I opened it nightly to look at the few photos it contained.I remembered the bone deep longing for the mother I didnt remember, and the vain effort to imagine her, to bring her back to life from the small dim images in the box.The best of them was a close up photograph of her, face turned toward the camera, warm eyes and a delicate mouth, smiling under the brim of a felt cloche hat.The photograph had been hand tinted; the cheeks and lips were an unnatural rose pink, the eyes soft brown.Uncle Lamb said that that was wrong; her eyes had been gold, he said, like mine.I thought perhaps that time of deep need had passed for Brianna, but was not sure.I had had a studio portrait made of myself the week before; I placed it carefully in the box and closed it, and put the box in the center of my desk, where she would find it.Then I sat down to write.My dear Bree I wrote, and stopped.I couldnt.Couldnt possibly be contemplating abandoning my child.To see those three black words stark on the page brought the whole mad idea into a cold clarity that struck me to the bone.My hand shook, and the tip of the pen made small wavering circles in the air above the paper.I put it down, and clasped my hands between my thighs, eyes closed.Get a grip on yourself, Beauchamp, I muttered.Write the bloody thing and have done.If she doesnt need it, it will do no harm, and if she does, it will be there.I picked up the pen and began again.I dont know if you will ever read this, but perhaps its as well to set it down.This is what I know of your grandparents (your real ones), your great grandparents, and your medical history  I wrote for some time, covering page after page.My mind grew calmer with the effort of recall, and the necessity of setting down the information clearly, and then I stopped, thinking.What could I tell her, beyond those few bare bloodless facts?How to impart what sparse wisdom I had gained in forty eight years of a fairly eventful life?My mouth twisted wryly in consideration of that.Did any daughter listen?Would I, had my mother been there to tell me?It made no difference, though; I would just have to set it down, to be of use if it could.But what was true, that would last forever, in spite of changing times and ways, what would stand her in good stead?Most of all, how could I tell her just how much I loved her?The enormity of what I was about to do gaped before me, and my fingers clenched tight on the pen.I couldnt thinknot and do this.I could only set the pen to the paper and hope.BabyI wrote, and stopped.Then swallowed hard, and started again.You are my baby, and always will be.You wont know what that means until you have a child of your own, but I tell you now, anywayyoull always be as much a part of me as when you shared my body and I felt you move inside.Always.I can look at you, asleep, and think of all the nights I tucked you in, coming in the dark to listen to your breathing, lay my hand on you and feel your chest rise and fall, knowing that no matter what happens, everything is right with the world because you are alive.All the names Ive called you through the yearsmy chick, my pumpkin, precious dove, darling, sweetheart, dinky, smudgeI know why the Jews and Muslims have nine hundred names for God; one small word is not enough for love.I blinked hard to clear my vision, and went on writing, fast; I didnt dare take time to choose my words, or I would never write them.I remember everything about you, from the tiny line of golden down that zigged across your forehead when you were hours old to the bumpy toenail on the big toe you broke last year, when you had that fight with Jeremy and kicked the door of his pickup truck.God, it breaks my heart to think it will stop nowthat watching you, seeing all the tiny changesI wont know when you stop biting your nails, if you ever doseeing you grow suddenly taller than I, and your face take its shape.I always will remember, Bree, I always will.Theres probably no one else on earth, Bree, who knows what the back of your ears looked like when you were three years old.I used to sit beside you, reading One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish, or The Three Billy Goats Gruff, and see those ears turn pink with happiness.Your skin was so clear and fragile, I thought a touch would leave fingerprints on you.You look like Jamie, I told you.You have something from me, too, thoughlook at the picture of my mother, in the box, and the little black and white one of her mother and grandmother.You have that broad clear brow they have; so do I.  Ive seen a good many of the Frasers, tooI think youll age well, if you take care of your skin.Take care of everything, Breeoh, I wishwell, I have wished I could take care of you and protect you from everything all your life, but I cant, whether I stay or go.Take care of yourself, thoughfor me.The tears were puckering the paper now; I had to stop to blot them, lest they smear the ink beyond reading.I wiped my face, and resumed, slower now.You should know, BreeI dont regret it.In spite of everything, I dont regret it.Youll know something now, of how lonely I was for so long, without Jamie.It doesnt matter.If the price of that separation was your life, neither Jamie nor I can regret itI know he wouldnt mind my speaking for him.Breeyou are my joy.Youre perfect, and wonderfuland I hear you saying now, in that tone of exasperation, But of course you think thatyoure my mother!Yes, thats how I know.Bree, you are worth everythingand more.Ive done a great many things in my life so far, but the most important of them all was to love your father and you.I blew my nose and reached for another fresh sheet of paper.That was the most important thing; I could never say all I felt, but this was the best I could do.What might I add, to be of aid in living well, in growing up and growing old?What had I learned, that I might pass on to her?Choose a man like your father, I wrote.Either of them.I shook my head over thatcould there be two men more different?but left it, thinking of Roger Wakefield.Once youve chosen a man, dont try to change him, I wrote, with more confidence.It cant be done.More importantdont let him try to change you.He cant do it either, but men always try.I bit the end of the pen, tasting the bitter tang of India ink.And finally I put down the last and the best advice I knew, on growing older.Stand up straight and try not to get fat.With All My Love Always,  Mama  Jamies shoulders shook as he leaned against the rail, whether with laughter or some other emotion, I couldnt tell.His linen glowed white with moonlight, and his head was dark against the moon.At last he turned and pulled me to him.I think she will do verra well, he whispered.For no matter what poor gowk has fathered her, no lass has ever had a better mother.Kiss me, Sassenach, for believe meI wouldna change ye for the world.43  PHANTOM LIMBS  Fergus, Mr.Willoughby, Jamie, and I had all kept careful watch upon the six Scottish smugglers since our departure from Scotland, but there was not the slightest hint of suspicious behavior from any of them, and after a time, I found myself relaxing my wariness around them.Still, I felt some reserve toward most of them, save Innes.I had finally realized why neither Fergus nor Jamie thought him a possible traitor; with but one arm, Innes was the only smuggler who could not have strung up the exciseman on the Arbroath road.Innes was a quiet man.None of the Scots was what one might call garrulous, but even by their high standards of taciturnity, he was reserved.I was therefore not surprised to see him grimacing silently one morning, bent over behind a hatch cover, evidently engaged in some silent internal battle.Have you a pain, Innes?I asked, stopping.Och!He straightened, startled, but then fell back into his half crouched position, his one arm locked across his belly.Mmphm, he muttered, his thin face flushing at being so discovered.Come along with me, I said, taking him by the elbow.He looked frantically about for salvation, but I towed him, resisting but not audibly protesting, back to my cabin, where I forced him to sit upon the table and removed his shirt so that I could examine him.I palpated his lean and hairy abdomen, feeling the firm, smooth mass of the liver on one side, and the mildly distended curve of the stomach on the other.The intermittent way in which the pains came on, causing him to writhe like a worm on a hook, then passing off, gave me a good idea that what troubled him was simple flatulence, but best to be thorough.I probed for the gallbladder, just in case, wondering as I did so just what I would do, should it prove to be an acute attack of cholecystitis or an inflamed appendix.I could envision the cavity of the belly in my mind, as though it lay open in fact before me, my fingers translating the soft, lumpy shapes beneath the skin into visionthe intricate folds of the intestines, softly shielded by their yellow quilting of fat padded membrane, the slick, smooth lobes of the liver, deep purple red, so much darker than the vivid scarlet of the hearts pericardium above.Opening that cavity was a risky thing to do, even equipped with modern anesthetics and antibiotics.Sooner or later, I knew, I would be faced with the necessity of doing it, but I sincerely hoped it would be later.Breathe in, I said, hands on his chest, and saw in my mind the pink flushed grainy surface of a healthy lung.Breathe out, now, and felt the color fade to soft blue.No rales, no halting, a nice clear flow.I reached for one of the thick sheets of vellum paper I used for stethoscopes.When did you last move your bowels?I inquired, rolling the paper into a tube.The Scots thin face turned the color of fresh liver.Fixed with my gimlet eye, he mumbled something incoherent, in which the word four was just distinguishable.Four days?I said, forestalling his attempts to escape by putting a hand on his chest and pinning him flat to the table.Hold still, Ill just have a listen here, to be sure.The heart sounds were reassuringly normal; I could hear the valves open and close with their soft, meaty clicks, all in the right places.I was quite sure of the diagnosishad been virtually from the moment I had looked at himbut by now there was an audience of heads peering curiously round the doorway; Inness mates, watching.For effect, I moved the end of my tubular stethoscope down farther, listening for belly sounds.Just as I thought, the rumble of trapped gas was clearly audible in the upper curve of the large intestine.The lower sigmoid colon was blocked, though; no sound at all down there.You have belly gas, I said, and constipation.Aye, I ken that fine, Innes muttered, looking frantically for his shirt.I put my hand on the garment in question, preventing him from leaving while I catechized him about his diet of late.Not surprisingly, this consisted almost entirely of salt pork and hardtack.What about the dried peas and the oatmeal?I asked, surprised.Having inquired as to the normal fare aboard ship, I had taken the precaution of stowingalong with my surgeons cask of lime juice and the collection of medicinal herbsthree hundred pounds of dried peas and a similar quantity of oatmeal, intending that this should be used to supplement the seamens normal diet.Innes remained tongue tied, but this inquiry unleashed a flood of revelation and grievance from the onlookers in the doorway.Jamie, Fergus, Marsali, and I all dined daily with Captain Raines, feasting on Murphys ambrosia, so I was unaware of the deficiencies of the crews mess.Evidently the difficulty was Murphy himself, who, while holding the highest culinary standards for the captains table, considered the crews dinner to be a chore rather than a challenge.He had mastered the routine of producing the crews meals quickly and competently, and was highly resistant to any suggestions for an improved menu that might require further time or trouble.He declined absolutely to trouble with such nuisances as soaking peas or boiling oatmeal.Compounding the difficulty was Murphys ingrained prejudice against oatmeal, a crude Scottish mess that offended his aesthetic sense.I knew what he thought about that, having heard him muttering things about dogs vomit over the trays of breakfast that included the bowls of parritch to which Jamie, Marsali, and Fergus were addicted.Mr.Murphy says as how salt pork and hardtack is good enough for every crew hes had to feed for thirty yeargiven figgy dowdy or plum duff for pudding, and beef on Sundays, toothough if thats beef, Im a Chinamanand its good enough for us, Gordon burst in.Accustomed to polyglot crews of French, Italian, Spanish, and Norwegian sailors, Murphy was also accustomed to having his meals accepted and consumed with a voracious indifference that transcended nationalities.The Scots stubborn insistence on oatmeal roused all his own Irish intransigence, and the matter, at first a small, simmering disagreement, was now beginning to rise to a boil.We knew as there was meant to be parritch, MacLeod explained, for Fergus did say so, when he asked us to come.But its been nothing but the meat and biscuit since we left Scotland, which is a wee bit griping to the belly if yere not used to it.We didna like to trouble Jamie Roy ower such a thing, Raeburn put in.Geordies got his girdle, and weve been makin our own oatcake ower the lamps in the crew quarters.But weve run through what corn we brought in our bags, and Mr.Murphys got the keys to the pantry store.He glanced shyly at me under his sandy blond lashes.We didna like to ask, knowin what he thought of us.Ye wouldna ken whats meant by the term spalpeens, would ye, Mistress Fraser?MacRae asked, raising one bushy brow.While listening to this outpouring of woe, I had been selecting assorted herbs from my boxanise and angelica, two large pinches of horehound, and a few sprigs of peppermint.Tying these into a square of gauze, I closed the box and handed Innes his shirt, into which he burrowed at once, in search of refuge.Ill speak to Mr.Murphy, I promised the Scots.Meanwhile, I said to Innes, handing him the gauze bundle, brew you a good pot of tea from that, and drink a cupful at every watch change.If weve had no results by tomorrow, well try stronger measures.As if in answer to this, a high, squeaking fart emerged from under Innes, to an ironic cheer from his colleagues.Aye, thats right, Mistress Fraser; maybe ye can scare the shit out o him, MacLeod said, a broad grin splitting his face.Innes, scarlet as a ruptured artery, took the bundle, bobbed his head in inarticulate thanks, and fled precipitously, followed in more leisurely fashion by the other smugglers.A rather acrimonious debate with Murphy followed, terminating without bloodshed, but with the compromise that I would be responsible for the preparation of the Scots morning parritch, permitted to do so under provision that I confined myself to a single pot and spoon, did not sing while cooking, and was careful not to make a mess in the precincts of the sacred galley.It was only that night, tossing restlessly in the cramped and chilly confines of my berth, that it occurred to me how odd the mornings incident had been.Were this Lallybroch, and the Scots Jamies tenants, not only would they have had no hesitation in approaching him about the matter, they would have had no need to.He would have known already what was wrong, and taken steps to remedy the situation.Accustomed as I had always been to the intimacy and unquestioning loyalty of Jamies own men, I found this distance troubling.Jamie was not at the captains table next morning, having gone out in the small boat with two of the sailors to catch whitebait, but I met him on his return at noon, sunburned, cheerful, and covered with scales and fish blood.What have ye done to Innes, Sassenach?he said, grinning.
