Bran nodded at Sawyer.So, as I sent for the painting, Ill send it back.And it will be beyond her as well.Maybe what we should do next is get ready to get out of here, Riley began.In the opposite direction.I dont think well get anywhere without a fight, Doyle put in.Even if Sawyer was up to another group trip this quickly.Its more than that.Bran looked at Sasha.Isnt it?Its notor were notdone here yet.I dont know why.And I dont know where we look next, or which star were supposed to look for.I cant see or feel.I ...Maybe the six of us were only meant to find and protect the first.Dont buy that.Sawyer shook his head.Not for a minute.You trust, but doubt yourself too easily.Obviously irritated, Bran held his hands over the painting, vanished it.I cant call it up the way you do.I say we take a break.Take an hour.Riley set a hand on Sashas shoulder.One thing, we have to get that boat out of the yard.I think we wait for dark there.I can ease it back to the marina, but I dont want to give people a heart attack.An hours good.Sawyer got to his feet.Since weve got time, lets recharge a little.I need to let my family know the status.Maybe somebodys got an idea how and where we go from here.And when she comes?Doyle demanded.Ill bring the wrath of a thousand lights down on her, Bran said.From the high point.I can give her fear, and perhaps some pain.And give us time to go where were meant to go.Ill spend some time with the maps, Sawyer said.Ill make some calls.Riley followed him out of the room.As Sasha rose to clear, Annika nudged her aside.No, I can do this.You could rest.I could, thanks.It might help.You should go with her, Annika suggested to Bran when Sasha left.Shes still upset.She stood for you.You should stand for her.On a sigh, Bran leaned down to kiss her cheek.I think you may be the best of us.Go ahead.Once again, Doyle turned to the door.Ill stand watch.* * *  			When he got upstairs, she stood at the open terrace doors, her back to the room.I dont know why youre angry with me.I cant just snap my fingers and know the way you can snap yours.Im not angry.Youre mistaken.I know what I feel.Maybe its your own anger.She whirled around.I can feel yours, and yes, it makes me mad.Im doing the best I can, the best I can even after watching people I care about being slashed and bitten while you shield me so I barely get a scratch.I wont be the weak link.Youre the only one who thinks you are, and youre wrong.Then stop being pissed because I cant pop out a vision at will.God.She pressed her fingers to her eyes.Im tired of fighting.Good, as fightings not at all what I had in mind.With a wave of his hand, he slammed the terrace doors, shuttered the glass.The sound was explosive enough to have her taking an instinctive step back as he strode to her.He dragged her to him, pulling her head back by fisting a hand in her hair.Crushing his mouth to hers with such heat, such force it stole her breath.Does that feel angry?She pressed a hand on his shoulder as much to push him away as for balance.Yes.Whatever sparked in his eyes seemed beyond fury to her.You dont know the depths of it.I nearly let you drown.Let me You didnt  			Didnt I hold you in the dream, wake you from it?Then I set it aside as no more than just that.Then you were gone.Gone.And I couldnt find you.She started to say his name, but he took her mouth again, plundered it.Anger, yes, there was anger in him, and guilt, and over it all a hot and reckless desire that left her reeling.Do you think its all duty then?All convenience?He swept her toward the bed.Know what I feel, what I want, and what, by the gods, I can make you want.Could she have stopped him?Was there enough of the man whod touched her so tenderly in him still to stop the one who tore away her shirt, and ravaged?She didnt know.She didnt care.She didnt want to stop him.His hands bruised her, and thrilled her, as he ripped her into the dark where desire was edged with panicky stabs of desperation.Here was a storm unleashed, and she had no choice but to ride it.He took, too unhinged to care how roughly.She cried out for him, and hearing the shocked pleasure in the sound only fed the rising hunger.Hed have all of her, and be damned the cost.The room went to shadows, darkened by his needs.In them, under him, she trembled, she arched, she writhed.When he plunged into her, he muffled her scream with his mouth.Drove and drove and drove, blind with greed, as helpless against the violence of it as she.He felt the climax rip through her, felt it tear another cry from her throat, and felt like a savage at the feast.He pushed for more, and more, until her breath was sobs, until her hands slid limp off his back, until at last that fire gathered like a fist and struck hard and full.He collapsed on her, stripped raw, his heart pounding, his mind still whirling in the dark.Then her arms came around him.His mind began to clear as did the shadows that haunted the room.He cursed himself, viciously, but struggled to keep his voice easy as he lifted his head.I hurt you.I Ah, God.Her eyes swam with tears as they stared into his.I had no right.He started to push away, but her arms tightened around him.You didnt hurt me.Im not cryingor not like that.I didnt know ...I never knew anyone could want me like that.That it was possible to want like that.I didnt think it was duty, Bran, but maybe I did think, at least a little, that part of itof thiswas convenience.I dont think that now.He laid his forehead on hers.You werent breathing.Things had to be donethats dutybut all the while, from that moment when I put my hand on your heart and you had no breath to this moment all I could think was Id lost you.For duty.For a promise made before either of us existed.And everything stopped until you breathed again.And the time between your breaths, fidh, was an eon.He touched his lips to her brow, shifted away.Since this ...duty came to be mine, Ive known little fear.Its been a challenge, a mission, a purpose.And now theres fear, that you could be hurt beyond my power to heal.Its my purpose, too.She sat up with him.And Im afraid something will happen to you.Doyle said I was the glue.Maybe thats true, though I dont think the glues as strong as it needs to be.But youre the powerthe source of it.We cant do this without you.And I ...You said you were in love with me.What?Downstairs, when you were giving the others a good piece of your mind, you said you were in love with me.I was raving.To stall for time, for composure, she looked around for her clothes, found the ripped ruin of her shirt.He took it from her, tossed it aside, then caught her hands in his.Are you?You know feelings, Sasha.Is what you feel a spark, an attraction, a bit of heat and excitement?Or is it love, that holds and waits and opens?I want it to be the first.So much easier for both of us.But is it?She shut her eyes.Im so in love with you.I fell in love with you before I met you.In dreams, in drawings.Then there you were, and part of me just wanted to fall at your feet and beg.You beg from no one.He caught her face in his hands.You beg for nothing.I dreamed of you, and Im here with you.And thats so much more than I ever expected to have.Woman, you can infuriate me.Would you settle for so little?To take more than youd ever expected isnt settling.Bollocks to that.He grabbed her hand, pressed it to his heart.Damned if its just words for you.Feel it.Feel what I feel.Know it.Dont argue with me, he said before she could.Ive opened to you.Now feel what I feel.She might have resisted, tried to block, but he pushedand her own heart wanted so much to know.It flowed from him, into her.The love.Soft and generous, fierce and determined, powerful and weak.A vow as yet unspoken.All she felt for him echoed backhim to her.You love me.She let out a half laugh, lifted his hand to her heart.You love me.You love me.A phrase spoken three times is powerful magick.I suppose now Ill have to.I love youand now you have the words as well.What I feel, what you know is only yours.No one before, and for always.Yours.The moment I saw you, I wanted.Thats the spark.And when I had you, I wanted only more.Thats the binding.But the love, and all it means, came in a dozen ways.I need to ...She wrapped her arms around him, pressed her face to his shoulder as everything she felt, he felt, twined together inside her like braided rope.Hold on.To you, to this, to this exact moment.Whenever Im sad or afraid, I can bring it back, and be here.Whenever youre sad or afraid, Ill be there.This moment, and all the ones after.He drew her back to look in her eyes.Love is a serious business for me, fidh.A serious and lasting business.I give you my oath, heart and body, love, loyalty, and fidelity.Theyre yours, first and last.It stopped her heart, stopped it so it could beat stronger again.Not only love, she realized, but a pledge.He pledged himself to her.Will you give me yours?She thought shed known joy, but here was joy with a promise.Yes, I give you my oath, heart and body, love, loyalty, and fidelity.Theyre yours, first and last.When he kissed her, the promise shone through it, bright as the stars.* * *  			He left her before the hour was up.Even amid joy came duty.She dressed for her vision, for the storm she knew would come.If not tonight, then soon.When it came, when Bran brought it, she would be with him, on the promontory, with the wind, the fierce lightning and pelting rain.It would be enough; whatever they did would be enough.She believed it.And accepted, if she was wrong, and their best wasnt enough, shed known the true depth of love.As she put on her hiking boots she considered her own preparations.Shed keep the crossbow close, within reach, and with a quiver full of bolts.The knife Bran had given her would be, from now on, sheathed on her belt.If there was time, shed practicehand to hand, the damn push ups, pull ups, the tumbling.Shed practice until she was strong and quick.And she would open herself to visionsand that uneasy connection with Nerezza.With some regret, she picked up her sketch pad.The time shed given to her art had to wait now as she filled it with other things, immediate things.But when she started to tuck it away, she found herself reaching for a pencil.Open, she thought again, because something was pushing at her mind, something pushed to get in.No, she realized.Something pushed for freedom.She gave herself to it, stepped outside, in the light, propped the book on her easel.She heard voices below, battle plans and strategies, maneuvers and deceptions.For now, she closed them off, let the door open inside her.Quickly, confidently now, she began to sketch what formed in her mind.When it faded, her arm trembled with fatigue and the light had softened toward evening.She stepped back to stare not at a sketch but a painting.Her sketches littered the terrace floor, but on the easel stood a finished painting of an island of rough hills and bold flowers, of steep streets where buildings climbed and trees spread.And three crags rose out of the sea near it like guards on watch.Here.Bran stepped toward her, held out a glass.Drink this.She didnt ask what it was, simply took it, drank it.Her throat was dry as dust, and the cool liquid slid through her, settled her.I dont remember painting this.I felt something pushing to get out, and started to sketch.This.She bent to pick up one of the sketches.I saw it, so clearly.Not just in my head, but when I looked out, at the sea.It was there.Boats in the water, and those three rocks spearing up.I dont know where it is, or what it is.Or if its real.Its real.Sit a moment.Youve been at it for nearly three hours.Im fine.She let out a half laugh.In fact, I feel more than fine.What did I drink?A restorative.He touched her cheek.Mixed in a little wine.Well, I feel restored, so it worked.You know this island?Riley recognized it from one of the sketches I took down.And more, Sawyers compass verified it as where were meant to go next.Its Capri.Capri?Italy?It seems islands are the heart of the search.You and Sawyer have given us the direction.She wanted to go immediately, to pack up and go, and avoid what theyd face here.But she picked up another sketch, this one of the god who wanted their blood.Shell be thereshed come there.What we do here wont stop her.Even with pencil and paper, the ferocity all but leaped off the page.She looks different hereIve drawn her differently.That streak of gray in her hair, and ...she looks older.Doesnt she?She does, and that tells me while we may not stop her, well do some damage.I didnt sketch us.None of these are of us.He picked up another.But theres this.This housenothing as grand as this villa, but solid and real.Riley is, as one expects, making calls about accommodations on Capri.And if the time and distance prove too much for Sawyer, it happens Doyle can pilot a plane, and has a few contacts of his own.Well go as soon as we can.But not tonight, she said quietly.Shell come tonight, I know that now.And youll bring the storm.She looked out to the promontory.We should get ready.NINETEEN     			They spread weapons out under the pergola where theyd shared meals.Bows, guns, knives, and magickal vials and bottles.The plan was simple, straightforwardand brutal.Doyle had drawn it out with some of her paper.It reminded her of the football plays coaches outlined, which she didnt understand at all.Positioned here, between the seawall and the house, we draw them in.We stay in the open as long as we can, Doyle added.Pulling in what she sends at us, taking them down.If and when we need to fall back, we use the grove for cover.He glanced at Bran.Ill have the vials placed, as you see.Here, here, here, along here.Well drive them toward those positions.Ill set them off.And the bottles, in these locationsyoull remember to stay well clear of them.Riley and Sawyer can set them off with gunfirebut not, Bran emphasized as he had before, unless all are clear, at least ten feet.Twenty is better.The flash and power from those will obliterate any dark force, but if youre nearer than ten feet, itll be blinding.Nearer than that?You could be burned, and seriously.We get it, Irish, big boom, big power.Riley continued to check ammo.Well keep our distance.Be sure of it.Under the cover of the flashes, Ill change position, and go to the high cliff above the canal.We, Sasha corrected.Ive explained what Ill call there, what Ill loose.It comes from me.I can withstand it.As with whats in the bottles, youll need to be well clear.Sasha merely took the sketch out of her book, laid it out.Im there.Im meant to be.If we question that, we question everything.Shes right, man.Sawyer belted on his holster.I know its tough, but shes right.Youve got to take her up with you.Well cover you.Count on it.But shes got to go with you.Its her purpose.Gently, Annika stroked Brans arm.Because you love, together youll be stronger.I dont know about love, but Im not going to question our resident seer.Sorry, Bran, Riley added.You dont screw with destiny.Your word.Your promise, Sasha insisted.Because you wont break it to me.Ill take you.The choice was no longer his.My word.Now that thats settled, Riley put in, lets make sure we kick her ass, and her ugly minionsgood wordtoo.All over it.Sawyer slid a second knife in his boot.After we kick her ass, Annika began, and made Sawyer grin at how carefully she enunciated the phrase, we go here.She looked at Sashas painting.I know this place, and can swim there.I can get there quickly, and then Sawyer wouldnt have to take so many.Nobodys alone.Sawyer shook his head.Its not safe.We go together.I can get a plane, but its going to take a couple more days.Like Sawyer, Doyle slipped a knife into his boot.And Im thinking getting gone sooner rather than later is the smart move.Ive got a place nearly lined up.Friend of a cousin of a cousins getting it set up.I might be able to get us a plane, Riley considered.I can see if Ive got some lines to tug.Let me try it.Sawyer shrugged.If I cant do us all at once, I can take half of us, come back, take the other half.If it doesnt work, we can try for the plane.And the boat?Riley asked, mostly because she got a kick out of seeing it sitting in the yard.No big deal therebut Ill wait until after midnight, after the area around its mostly going to be clear of people.Im not sure it matters.Sasha sighted the bow.Weve had three ugly battles, and no one outside of us seems to have noticed a thing.I think what were doing isnt making a ripple on reality.Maybe, but when I was sixteen and training, I dropped down into a strip club in Amsterdam.It caused a ripple.My coordinates were a little off, and well, being sixteen, naked women were always on my mind.I like clothes.Theyre pretty.But for swimming, naked is best.Sawyer glanced at Annika, then carefully away.Okay, now thats on my mind.Set it aside, pal.I for one dont want to drop into a strip joint.Suns setting, Riley added.And a storms coming, Sasha thought.With the weapons handed out, they brought the rest of their belongings down.If they had to retreat, theyd count on Sawyer, and leave behind anything he couldnt transport.They ate, for fuel rather than hunger, as the edginess of waiting overwhelmed everything else.As the clock ticked toward midnight, Sasha stood.What is it?Bran demanded.What do you see?Hear.I hear her calling to them.Singing to them.Shes gathering.Lets saddle up.When Riley rose, Annika laid a hand on the dogs head.Apollo.We should shut him inside, safe.Hell just bust out.Ill keep an eye on him.Strange, Sasha thought as they moved into positionstwo by two on the verdant green lawnthat she could feel so much dread and so much relief at the same time.The combination left little room for fear.The Fire Star was safe, beyond Nerezzas reach, she thought.If they survived the night, they would begin the search for the next.If they didnt, someone else would pick up the quest.She reached out, took Brans hand.Whatever happens, Ive had more in these last two weeks than I ever had or thought to have.A ghr.He brought her hand to his lips with a kind of steely defiance.Theres more yet.Theyre coming.She released his hand to swing her bow into position.Theyd come before in swarms, in clouds, but they came now in a tidal wave that blacked out the stars and the light of the waning moon.And the sound of them filled the world.Bran blasted light up, illuminating themthe sick yellow eyes and fanged teeth, the spread of razor sharp wings.She thought it was like watching hell roll over the world.Then she shot the first bolt, and stopped thinking.They fell like black, oily rain, screamed as they raked the air with claws that gleamed deadly in Brans conjured light.Her world contracted into load, aim, shoot with the blasts of gunfire echoing, the horrid sound of steel hacking gnarled flesh, the zing of light snapping from Annikas bracelets.Bran set off the first vial, and in its bloom of light that greasy blood splattered.And still more came.She held her ground, even as a thin fog flowed over the ground and hissed like snakes, she fought back to back with Bran.But the fog bit at her boots, icy teeth, pushing her back.Stay close, Bran shouted, and swept fire over the fog.It screamed, and it burned.When her quiver emptied, she used her knife, her fists, her feet to clear a path so she could grab up bloodied bolts and reload.Another vial exploded, and again, and still more gushed from the black sky.Its now.Bran grabbed her hand, then shouted for Riley to set off the first bottle.Hold on, he told Sasha, and wrapped his arm firmly around her waist.It wasnt like flyingsomehow shed thought it would be.It was like riding a rocket, so hot, so fast, all blurred in speed.Then she was on the promontory with him, as shed been in dreams.Stay behind me, or I swear Ill send you back.He pulled her against him.Whatever happens, stay behind me.His mouth crushed down on hers in a kiss as full of heat as the flight.I love you, he said, then turned to call the storm.She thought she knew.Shed dreamed it, hadnt she?Again and again.But she hadnt known what he could call, what he could rule, what he could risk.Power shook the air, the ground, and the sea below as he lifted his arms.In this place, in this hour, I call upon all worlds of power.What you are, bring to me across the land, across the sea, to rise and rage with furious might and rid the world of this blight.Roar the thunder!It boomed like cannon fire.And with your voice rip them asunder.Hot blue flames of lightning spears.It tore out of the sky, electric blue and blinding.To burn all darkness that appears.Whirl wind across their flight and send them spinning into the night.Pour the rain in white hot flood and drown them in their own black blood.Shed fallen to her knees, rocked by what he unleashed.The wind shrieked around her, tore at her clothes even as the wild rain plastered them to her skin.Through the gale she could see flashes belowthe bottles with their blinding light exploding, the slashing lights, then sudden strikes of lightning.And hundreds, perhaps thousands of those winged bodies spinning, tumbling, falling with screams that rang in her ears.And yes, he was the storm.He burned as blue and hot as the lightning he called, arms raised high, that wild light flaming from his fingertips.Even through the deluge, she tasted triumph.They were beating back the dark.And Nerezza rode through the storm.Her hair flew black as the night in the wind.Her eyes glowed through the dark, full of hate and fury and terrible power.She rode a three headed beast with snapping jaws, long, flicking tongues.On a peal of laughter, she batted a spear of lightning aside, grabbed another and hoisted it like a lance.Do you think your puny powers can stop me?Her voice boomed, like the thunder.The taste of triumph iced into fear.I am a god.I rule the dark, and your light is nothing but a dying flame against my power.I will drink your blood, sorcerer, and suck the seers mind empty.She glanced down when the light exploded below.And when Im done, Ill cut the others to pieces for my hounds to feast on.Give me the star, and live.His answer was to fling another blue bolt, one that singed the scales of the beast she rode.It shrieked and reared up in pain.Then die, and when I feed on you, Ill simply take whats mine.The lightning turned black in her hand.When she shot it toward Bran, Sasha cried out, the sound smothered by the storm.He pushed a wall of light against it, and the clash had even the rocks trembling.It hurt him.She felt his pain, felt some of the power he wielded drain.One of those tongues slashed out, barely missed his heart.The effort to block it had him staggering.I cant hold her, Sasha.I need to send you down.Tell Sawyer  			No!On a sudden burst, she shoved to her feet.Though he burned against the dark, she flung her arms around him.Take what I have, what I am.Take it, feel it.Use it.I love you.Feel it.Sasha threw herself open, poured everything she was out for him.She knew his power, the breadth and depth of it, and his courage, his fearbut only for her.Just as she knew Nerezzas contempt, knew what the god would say before the words followed her roar of laughter.Love?Only mortals bow to love.It has no power here.Youre wrong, Sasha thought, and shut her eyes.It has all the power.She felt it flood and flash through Bran, clung to him even as she quaked from it.What he hurled out now exploded like the sun.The beast pawed the air as it tried to escape from it.With eyes gone mad, Nerezza tried to drive it forward, but the next blast had it crying out in shocked pain as it tumbled toward the sea.Dazed, Sasha saw Nerezzas hair go gray as the stones, her face as withered as dried leaves before she swirled the dark around herself and vanished.Now Sashas legs went to water, and she slid bonelessly to the ground.Overhead, the stars blazed back to life, and the moon sailed clear and white.When Bran dropped down beside her, power still shimmered around him.Im all right.She groped for his hand, and what theyd made together sang along her skin.Just need to ...Get my breath back.You hurt her.Shes gone.You hurt her.We.He pulled her up, cradled her, pressed his lips to her cheeks, her temples, her mouth.We.You were right, all along, fidh.I needed you here.I would have failed without you with me.The others.We need to see if anyones hurt.Just hold on to me.She linked her arms around his neck.I will.You can count on it.* * *  			Blood spread like black shadows on the ground, splashed like dirty rain on blooms and blossoms.The scent of it, of sweat, of scorched grass hung in the air.But everyone Sasha cared about stoodbattered, but alive.Riley, her hand resting on Apollos head, holstered her gun.Was she riding a freaking Cerberus?Three headed hellhound?she elaborated.She wasor her own bastardized version of one.Bran stepped to her, laid a hand on her cheek, on the angry red burns that scored down it and over her throat.You didnt keep back far enough.Tell me about it.Your nuclear holocaust shot me back a good twenty feet.Im not overly vainokay, maybe I am.Either way, Im hoping you can fix it.Hurts like a bitch, she began, then let out a long breath.Or did.Thanks.Hed used what he could to ease the pain, and would do more once theyd regrouped.I have potions that will make your face as pretty as ever.While youre at it, you could give me a little boost there.Anyway.She looked around the battlefield.Im hoping you can fix this, too.Im not going to score us another place if we leave things like this.Ill see to it.Other injuries?Bran asked, though Sasha was already examining a nasty bite on Annikas shoulder.Minor.Doyle spoke up.Once we lit those charges, they went down by the hundreds.And after she focused on you, what came at us was more a suicide squad to keep us busy.You kicked her ass.Sawyer pulled a bandanna out of his pocket, wrapped it around his bleeding forearm.It was one hell of a show.Dont get cocky.Riley gave him a hip bump.Wed better square everything away here, and get gone.Any sense shes coming back at us tonight, Sash?She was shocked, and in pain.Enraged, but stunned Bran could not only hold her back, but hurt her.No, I cant believe shell come back tonight.I cant feel her at all now.Shes closed in, closed off.Licking her wounds.Riley gave Apollos head a rub.Lets do that, too.Im going to give Apollo some water, and a great big treat.Im getting a beer.Doyle headed off behind her.Still some of your bolts scattered around.Ill police as much brass as I can in the dark, find the bolts.Ill give you some light for that, Bran told Sawyer.Well get this cleaned up after Ive seen to Rileys burns.They seem to be the worst of it.They turned as one at Doyles shout.It bulleted out of the sky, wings spread, talons curled, straight at Riley.She reached for her gun, pivoting to shield the dog.Before she could clear the holster, Doyle shoved her aside.Though he drew his sword, the creature buried fang and claw into his chest before he could strike.It screamed in triumph as he fell, as the hilt slipped from his lifeless hand.As the others charged forward, Riley yanked the thing away from Doyle with her bare hands, heaved it away.And drawing her gun with a hand sliced and gashed from its wings, emptied her clip into its body.She dropped down beside Doyle, uselessly pressed her hands on the tearing wounds on his chest.No, no, no, no!Get me some towels.We need to put pressure on this, stop the bleeding.Bran, you have to do something.Ah, God.Like her, Bran knelt by the body.Ah, God, he said again.Its too late.Hes gone.Then bring him back!Thats beyond my power.Gently Bran touched her arm, but she yanked away.I cant turn death, darling.Weeping, Annika sat, cradled Doyles head in her lap, stroked his hair.Can we do nothing?Sawyer, take us back, even a few minutes, before ...Yes!Eyes full of tears and rage, Riley jerked up her head.Do it.Do it now.I cant.He crouched, and though she shoved against him, wrapped his arms around Riley.Death cant be changed.If I took us back, it would happen again, no matter what we did.I cant.Thats bullshit.This is bullshit.Hes not supposed to be dead.She looked at Sasha now, who stood, tears gleaming on her cheeks.Its not right.I dont know.I cant see.I ...only know we all risk our lives for this.But  			She broke off, shaking her head.She felt something, but didnt understand it.Struggling to, she knelt beside Bran, took Doyles limp hand in hers.No one dies for me.We try something, anything, goddamn it, before its too late.Riley shoved Sawyer aside, once again pressed her hands on Doyles chest.She doesnt get to take one of us.She doesnt get to win.There was a movementa rippleunder her hands.Doyle drew in a deep, harsh breath.Hes alive!On a stunned sob, Riley grabbed Brans hand, pressed it to the wound.Do something.He doesnt need to, Sasha murmured as lifeand painflickered back into Doyles eyes.Christ, he said in a voice as raw as the breath.Stop shouting, and get all the bloody weight off my chest.Its bad enough.You were dead, man.Sawyer hunkered back on his heels while Annika pressed a weeping kiss to Doyles head.As in doornail.Thats no shit.Is this a zombie thing?Because I sure as hell dont want to shoot you in the head.Dont be an idiot.On another painful breath, Doyle pushed up to his elbows.The deep and vicious wound on his chest beganor continuedto heal.Glad youre back, thats pure truth.Not a vampire, Sawyer speculated.You spend plenty of time in the sun.Youre an entertaining man, Sawyer.Doyle shuddered, set his teeth.Theres pain.I can help there.Doyle shook his head at Bran.Its part of it.Has to be.Itll pass.Wheres my sword?Ive got it.When he sat up, Riley put it in his hand.I appreciate the save, but why arent you dead?When he looked at her, Riley hastily swiped tears from her face.I wouldnt have been, briefly, if youd reacted quicker.You blocked me, pal, shoved me before I could draw and fire.If  			You cant die.Sasha spoke quietly.Im sorry, but I was trying to find a way, some way to help, and when you were ...between?she suggested.You were so open, and it just flowed out and into me.You cant be killed.Im so glad!Annika beamed at him.Ill get you a beer.Youre a sweetheart, but maybe we can take this inside.In case there are any other stragglers.Not dying hurts like a motherfucker, and Id like to avoid a second round tonight.Bran rose, offered a hand to help Doyle to his feet.An Immortal Spell.Its forbidden, Bran began.Dont blame me.Im no witch.You want the story, Ill give it to you.But I want that beer.You need a fresh shirt, Sasha pointed out.Doyle looked down at the blood and gore staining his.Yeah.Ill get one.I need my kit, and something for those burns, he said to Riley.And now your hands.Well have the story, and then its best if we clean the grounds.And go.Fresh shirt, medical supplies, beer, cleanup.Check.Im going to touch base with my contact, nail down just where were going.Within minutes, they gathered in the kitchen, with Bran tending Rileys wounds.Howd you cut up the hands?Doyle asked her.She pulled that thing off you with them, Sawyer told him.Just yanked it out, then shot the crap out of it.Over a long sip of beer, Doyle studied her.Looks like were even then.Since you cant die, yeah.Id say were even.So lets hear why.A witch.Being magickal doesnt stop insanity.She was mad.She would lure young men, use them, then kill them for sport.A black widow witch, Riley said.One of the young men was my brother.Barely seventeen when she took him.Instinctively Annika wrapped her arms around him.Im so sorry.I hunted her.That was my purpose, my only purpose.To save him, destroy her.I bargained with an alchemist, gave him all I had.He created the sword, to end her.When I found her, my brother was near death, beyond the saving.Seventeen, and dying in my arms, he who had never harmed a soul.My grief was beyond even my rage.He begged me to kill him, and I couldnt.I couldnt do what he asked of me.That is a regret I can never undo.So he died in agony while I grieved.She smelled it, that grief.Savored it.I fought her, blind with it, beyond feeling that rage, certainly beyond fear.When she knew I would end her, she used it, and cursed me with the spell.I would watch everyone I loved die.I would see them bleed and fall in battle, suffer from disease, wither and fall of old age.I would never know the release of death, but only the death of all I touched.He polished off the beer, pushed the bottle aside.I took her head with the sword, and bore my brothers body home, to his mothers weeping.He was the youngest of us, and I the oldest.But I hadnt saved him, I hadnt given him what he asked of me at his end.And the curse rooted in me.When was this?Bran asked him.In the year 1683.Man, youre old.Even as he said it lightly, Sawyer put a hand on Doyles shoulder, squeezed.Sorry about your brother.You would regret it if youd given him what he asked, Annika said.You would carry that as you carry the regret of not doing so.It wasnt a battle you could win.Its done, and long ago.He looked over at Sasha.You think I shouldve told you this before.Youre the first Ive been with, fought with, on this quest.The habit of secrecy is hard to break.I can tell you that after tonight, after the battle, Id decided to break that habit and tell you, as Ive told you now.I dont blame you for not believing that.I do believe it.She let out a sigh.And now, we know, each of us, who we are, and what we have.The real unity will come from that.I believe that, too.Can we take a minute?Sawyer asked.To just lay this out.Weve got a witch, a seer, a werewolfI like the word, okay?he said with a laugh before Riley could growl at him.A mermaid, an immortal, and a time and space traveler.Think about it.Were like the freaking Avengers.That bitch goddess is going to lose, big time.On that really excellent note Riley handed him a piece of paper.The coordinates for our digs in Capri.Why dont we do what we have to doget that boat out of here, get the jeep back, clean up our messand head out for round two?All about it, and you know what?Its damn well going to work.Weve got it going, Sawyer decided.Well close up shop.Next stop, Capri.They saw to the practicalities, the duties.In the deep night with its swimming moon, Sasha looked out one last time, over the sea.Bran took her hand, lifted it to his lips in a way she knew would always make her smile.Well come back one day, as you said.Id like that.Id like to stand on the promontory with you again, under the stars, on a warm summer night when everythings quiet, and as far as we can see, theres peace.Youre my light, Sasha.My star and my peace.He touched his lips to hers.Are you ready?I am.For everything.Together they went down to the terrace to join the others.Apollos snoring inside.The neighbors coming to take care of him first thing in the morning, feed the cluckers.Riley glanced at her watch.Just a couple hours now.Im going to miss that dog.Dawns close.If were going to do this, Doyle said, we should do it now.Bring it in, everybody.Sawyer gestured for them to move closer.Grab hands and hold on to your hats.This is going to be a hell of a ride.Sasha looked up into Brans face, laughed.And it was a hell of a ride.* * *  			In her cave, Nerezza seethed.Shed eased her pain, but no matter how much blood, how much potion, how much will, the streak of gray remained snaking through her dark hair.Lines fanned out from her eyes and mouth.She broke another mirror, and cursed.And her tears ran like blood down her face.They would pay for marring her beauty.They would pay for defying her.No matter what world they ran to, no matter what magicks they devised, she would follow, she would destroy.She would not rest until the stars shone for only her.Picking up her globe, she ran a hand over it.There were ways, many ways.She had only to choose another.As she looked, as she watched, she smiled.And began to see, began to plot.Began to laugh.Keep reading for an excerpt from  			The Obsession  			by Nora Roberts  			Available April 2016 from Berkley Books      			Having a houseful of men had some advantages.Xander and Kevin carted out Naomis shipping boxes and the smaller box of prints shed framed for potential sale locally.It left her free to carry her camera bag.Thanks.Ill get these shipped off this morning.Xan tapped Naomis camera bag.Going to work, too?I am.Ill take an hour or two before I head to town.Where?When her eyebrows raised, he kept it casual.Just wondering.Down below the bluff.Well see if the rain washed in anything interesting.Its a pretty spring morning.Boats should be out.Good luck with that.He yanked her in for a kiss, gave the dog a quick rub.See you later.Shed be within sight of the house, he thought as he swung onto his bike.And hed already had a short, private conversation with Kevin about keeping an eye out.Best he could do, but he wouldnt be altogether easy until they found out what happened to Marla.* * *  			Naomi considered taking the car.She could drive nearly a half a mile closer, then take a track down through the woodssince she wanted shots there firstand make her way down to the shoreline.But quiet area or not, she didnt like the idea of leaving her car on the side of the road with her prints locked inside.She got the leash, which immediately had Tag racing in the opposite direction.Since she had his number, she only shrugged and started down the curve of road.He slunk after her.She stopped, took a dog cookie out of her pocket.You want this, you wear this until were off the road.She held out the leash.Dislike for the leash lost to greed.He strained against the leash, tugged it, did his best to tangle himself in it.Naomi clipped it to her belt with a carabiner, stopped to frame in some white wildflowers the rain had teased open like stars on the side of the road.He behaved better in the forest, occupying himself by sniffing the air, nosing the ground.Naomi took carefully angled shots of a nurse log surrounded by ferns and blanketed with lichen and mossyellows, rusty reds, greens on wood studded with mushrooms that spread like alien creatures.A pair of trees, easily ten feet high, rose from it, the roots wrapped around the decaying log as if in an embrace.New life, she thought, from the dead and dying.The long rain had soaked the green so it tinted the light.It seduced wildflowers to dance in sunbeam and shadow.It scented the air with earth and pine and secrets.After an hour she nearly headed back, left the shoreline for another day.But she wanted the sparkle of sun on the water after the misty damp of the forest.She wanted the deeper, rougher green of those knuckles of land, the strong gray of rock against the blues.Another hour, she decided, then shed pack it up, run her errands.Thrilled to be off the leash, Tag raced ahead.She turned onto the bluff trail, one he knew well now.He barked, danced in place whenever she stopped to take other pictures.Dont rush me.But she could smell the water now, too, and quickened her pace.The trail angled down, and proved muddy enough from the rains that she had to slow again.Considering the mud, she realized shed now have to wash the damn dog before running into town.Didnt think of that, did you?she muttered, and used handy branches to support herself on the slick dirt.All worth it.Worth it all in that one moment when the water and pockets of land opened up through the trees.She balanced herself, risked a spill to get shots of the view through low hanging branches with their fernlike needles.Down below it would be bright, sparkling, but here, with the angle, the fan of branches, the inlet looked mysterious.Like a secret revealed through a magic door.Satisfied, she picked her way down to where the dog barked like a maniac.Leave the birds alone!I want the birds.She scraped her muddy boots on rippling rock, climbed over them.Caught the diamond glint shed hoped for, and happily, just beyond the channel, a boat with red sails.She blocked out the barking dog until she got what she wanted, until the red sails eased into frame.When he raced back to her, she ignored him, took a long shot of the inlet at the twin forks of water drifting by the floating hump of green.Look, if youre going to tag along, you just have to wait until Im done before What have you got?Where did you get that?He stood, tail ticking, and a shoe in his mouth.A womans shoe, she noted.Open toes, long skinny heel in cotton candy pink.Youre not taking that home.You can just forget about that.When he dropped it at her feet, she stepped around it.And Im not touching it.As she picked her way down, he grabbed up the shoe, raced ahead again.She stepped down onto the coarse sand, the bumpy cobbles of the narrow strip.Tag sent up a fierce spat of barking, a series of high pitched whines that had her spinning around to snap at him.Cut it out!Whats wrong with you this morning?She lowered her camera with hands gone to ice.The dog stood at the base of the bluff, barking at something sprawled on the skinny swatch of sand.She made herself walk closer until her legs began to tremble, until the weight fell on her chest.She went down to her knees, fighting for breath, staring at the body.Marla Roth lay, wrists bound, her hands outstretched as though reaching for something shed never hold.The bright, sparkling light went gray; the air filled with a roar, a wild, high wave.Then the dog licked her face, whined, tried to nose his head under her limp hand.The weight eased, left a terrible ache in its place.Okay.Okay.Stay here.Her hands shook as she unlooped his leash, clipped it on him.Stay with me.God, oh God.Just hold on.Cant be sick.Wont be sick.Setting her teeth, she pulled out her phone.* * *  			She didnt want to stay; she couldnt leave.It didnt matter that the police had told her to stay where she was, to touch nothing.She could have ignored that.But she couldnt leave Marla alone.But she went back to the rocks, climbed up enough to sit so the air could wash over her clammy face.The dog paced, tugged on the leash, barked until she hooked an arm around him, pulled him down to sit beside her.It calmed them both, at least a little.Calmed her enough that she realized she could do the one other thing she wanted.She took out her phone again, called Xander.Hey.His voice pitched over loud music, noisy machines.Xander.It only took one word, the sound in her voice on a single word, to have his stomach knotting.What happened?Are you hurt?Where are you?Im not hurt.Im down below the bluff.I ...Its Marla.Shes ...I called the police.I found her.I called the police, and theyre coming.Im on my way.Call Kevin.He can get down there faster, but Im coming now.Its all right.Im all right.I can wait.I can hear the sirens.I can already hear them.Ten minutes.Though he hated to, he ended the call, jammed the phone in his pocket, swung a leg over his bike.On the rock, Naomi stared at the phone before remembering to put it away.Not in shock, she thoughtshe remembered how it felt to go into shock.Just a little dazed, a little out of herself.We have to wait, she told the dog.They have to get down the trail, so we have to wait.Someone hurt her.They hurt her, and they must have raped her.They took her clothes off.Her shoes.She swallowed hard, pressed her face against Tags fur.And they hurt her.You can see her throat.The bruises around her throat.I know what that means, I know what that means.The panic wanted to rear back, but she bore down, forced herself to take careful breaths.Not going to break.The dog smelled of the rain that had dripped from wet trees, of wet ground, of good, wet dog.She used it to keep centered.As long as she had the dog, right here, she could get through it.When she heard them coming, she drew more breaths, then got to her feet.Im here, she called out.The chief broke through the trees first, followed by a uniformed deputy carrying a case.Then another with a camera strapped around his neck.She couldnt see their eyes behind their sunglasses.Shes over there.His head turned.She heard him let out a breath of his own before he looked back at her.I need you to wait here.Yes, I can wait here.She sat againher legs still werent altogether steadyand looked out to the water, to its sparkling beauty.After a time, Tag relaxed enough to sit down, lean against her.She heard someone coming, too fast for safety on the steep, muddy track.Tag sprang up again, wagged everywhere in happy hello.They want me to wait here, she told Xander.He knelt down beside her, pulled her in.She could have broken thenoh, it would have been so easy to break.And so weak.He eased back, skimmed a hand over her face.Im going to take you up to the house.Im supposed to wait.Fuck that.They can talk to you up at the house.Id rather do it here.Id rather not bring this into the house until I have to.I shouldnt have called you.Bullshit.I called before I ...She trailed off as the chief walked back to them.Xander.I called him after I called you.I was pretty shaky.Understandable.I ...Im sorry, the dog ...I didnt see her at first.I was taking pictures, and I didnt see her.He had a shoeher shoe, I think.I just thought ...Im sorry, I know we werent supposed to touch anything, but I didnt see her at first.Dont you worry about that.You came down to take pictures?Yes.I often do.IweI mean the dog and I walked from the house, through the forest.I spent some time in there getting photos, but I wanted to take some here.After the rain.There was a boat with a red sail, and Tag had the shoe.A womans pink heel.I dont know what he did with it.Sam took the water bottle out of her jacket pocket, handed it to her.You have a little water now, honey.All right.You didnt see anybody else?No.He kept barking and whining, but I didnt pay any attention because I wanted the shot.Then I yelled at him, and turned.And I saw her.I went a little closer, to be sure.And I could see ...So I called the police.I called you, and I called Xander.I want to take her up to the house.I want to take her away from here.You do that.Sam gave Naomis shoulder a light rub.You go on home now.Im going to check in with you before I go.Xander took her hand, kept it firm in his as they started up the track.She didnt speak until they were in the trees.I hurt her.Naomi.I hurt her on Friday night, at the bar.I meant to.And she walked out of there with her wrist aching, her pride ripped up, and her temper leading her.Otherwise, shed have left with her friend.I looked at you instead of her.You want me to feel guilty about that, to try to work some blame up because it was you, not her?This isnt about you and me, Naomi.Its about the son of a bitch who did this to her.It was the tone as much as the words that snapped her back.The raw impatience with anger bubbling beneath.Youre right.Maybe thats why I needed to call you.I wouldnt get endless there theres and poor Naomis from you.That sort of thing just makes it all worse.And its not about me.Finding hers about you.Having to see thats about you.You dont want any poor Naomis, Ill keep them to myself, but goddamn, I wish youd gone anywhere else to take pictures this morning.So do I.
