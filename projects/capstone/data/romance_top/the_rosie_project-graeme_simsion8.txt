I was interested in one of the statements Rosie had made at Columbia.I thought you admired your mother.Why wouldnt you want to be a doctor?It wasnt my mother.My fathers a doctor too.Remember?Thats what were here for.She poured the rest of the red wine into her glass.I thought about it.I did the GAMSAT, like I told Peter Enticott.And I did get seventy four.Suck on that.Despite the aggressive words, her expression remained friendly.I thought that doing medicine would be a sign of some sort of obsession with my real father.Like I was following him rather than Phil.Even I could see that was a bit fucked up.Gene frequently states that psychologists are incompetent at understanding themselves.Rosie seemed to have provided good evidence for that proposition.Why avoid something that she would enjoy and be good at?And surely three years of undergraduate education in psychology plus several years of postgraduate research should have provided a more precise classification of her behavioral, personality, and emotional problems than fucked up.Naturally I did not share these thoughts.We were first in line when the museum opened at 10:30 a. m.  I had planned the visit according to the history of the universe, the planet, and life.Thirteen billion years of history in six hours.At noon, Rosie suggested we delete lunch from the schedule to allow more time with the exhibits.Later, she stopped at the reconstruction of the famous Laetoli footprints made by hominids approximately 3.6 million years ago.I read an article about this.It was a mother and child, holding hands, right?It was a romantic interpretation but not impossible.Have you ever thought of having children, Don?Yes, I said, forgetting to deflect this personal question.But it seems both unlikely and inadvisable.Why?Unlikely, because I have lost confidence in the Wife Project.And inadvisable because I would be an unsuitable father.Why?Because Id be an embarrassment to my children.Rosie laughed.I thought this was very insensitive, but she explained, All parents are an embarrassment to their kids.Including Phil?She laughed again.Especially Phil.At 4:28 p. m.  we had finished the primates.Oh no, were done?said Rosie.Is there something else we can see?We have two more things to see, I said.You may find them dull.I took her to the room of ballsspheres of different sizes showing the scale of the universe.The display is not dramatic, but the information is.Nonscientists, nonphysical scientists, frequently have no idea of scalehow small we are compared to the size of the universe, how big compared to the size of a neutrino.I did my best to make it interesting.Then we went up in the elevator and joined the Heilbrunn Cosmic Pathway, a 110 meter spiral ramp representing a time line from the big bang to the present.It is just pictures and photos and occasional rocks and fossils on the wall, and I didnt even need to look at them, because I know the story, which I related as accurately and dramatically as I could, putting all that we had seen during the day into context, as we walked down and around until we reached the ground level and the tiny vertical hairline representing all of recorded human history.It was almost closing time now, and we were the only people standing there.On other occasions, I have listened to peoples reactions as they reach the end.Makes you feel a bit unimportant, doesnt it?they say.I suppose that is one way of looking at ithow the age of the universe somehow diminishes our lives or the events of history or Joe DiMaggios streak.But Rosies response was a verbal version of mine.Wow, she said, very quietly, looking back at the vastness of it all.Then, in this vanishingly small moment in the history of the universe, she took my hand, and held it all the way to the subway.twenty seven   We had one critical task to perform before leaving New York the following morning.Max Freyberg, the cosmetic surgeon and potential biological father of Rosie, who was booked solid, had agreed to see us for fifteen minutes at 6:45 p. m.  Rosie had told his secretary she was writing a series of articles for a publication about successful alumni of the university.I was carrying Rosies camera and would be identified as a photographer.Getting the appointment had been difficult enough, but it had become apparent that collecting the DNA would be far more challenging in a working environment than in a social or domestic location.I had set my brain the task of solving the problem before we departed for New York and had expected it to have found a solution through background processing, but it had apparently been too occupied with other matters.The best I could think of was a spiked ring that would draw blood when we shook hands, but Rosie considered this socially infeasible.She suggested clipping a hair, either surreptitiously or after identifying it as a stray that would mar the photo.Surely a cosmetic surgeon would care about his appearance.Unfortunately a clipped hair was unlikely to yield an adequate sample: it needed to be plucked to obtain a follicle.Rosie packed a pair of tweezers.For once I hoped I might have to spend fifteen minutes in a smoke filled room.A cigarette butt would solve our problem.We would have to be alert to opportunities.Dr.Freybergs office was in an older style building on the Upper West Side.Rosie pushed the buzzer and a security guard appeared and took us up to a waiting area where the walls were totally covered with framed certificates and letters from patients praising Dr.Freybergs work.Dr.Freybergs secretary, a very thin woman (BMI estimate sixteen) of about fifty five with disproportionately thick lips, led us into his office.More certificates!Freyberg himself had a major fault: he was completely bald.The hair plucking approach would not be viable.Nor was there any evidence that he was a smoker.Rosie conducted the interview very impressively.Freyberg described some procedures that seemed to have minimal clinical justification, and talked about their importance to self esteem.It was fortunate that I had been allocated the silent role, as I would have been strongly tempted to argue.I was also struggling to focus.My mind was still processing the hand holding incident.Im sorry, said Rosie, but could I bother you for something to drink?Of course!The coffee swab solution.Sure, said Freyberg.Tea, coffee?Coffee would be great, said Rosie.Just black.Will you have one yourself?Im good.Lets keep going.He pushed a button on his intercom.Rachel.One black coffee.You should have a coffee, I said to him.Never touch it, said Freyberg.Unless you have a genetic intolerance of caffeine, there are no proven harmful effects.On the contrary  What magazine is this for again?The question was straightforward and totally predictable.We had agreed on the name of the fictitious university publication in advance, and Rosie had already used it in her introduction.But my brain malfunctioned.Rosie and I spoke simultaneously.Rosie said, Faces of Change.I said, Hands of Change.It was a minor inconsistency that any rational person would have interpreted as a simple, innocent error, which in fact it was.But Freybergs expression indicated disbelief and he immediately scribbled on a notepad.When Rachel brought the coffee, he gave her the note.I diagnosed paranoia and started to think about escape plans.I need to use the bathroom, I said.I planned to phone Freyberg from the bathroom, so Rosie could escape while he took the call.I walked toward the exit, but Freyberg blocked my path.Use my private one, he said.I insist.He led me through the back of his office, past Rachel to a door marked Private and left me there.There was no way to exit without returning the way we had come.I took out my phone, called 411directory assistanceand they connected me to Rachel.I could hear the phone ring and Rachel answer.I kept my voice low.I need to speak to Dr.Freyberg, I said.Its an emergency.I explained that my wife was a patient of Dr.Freyberg and that her lips had exploded.I hung up and texted Rosie: Exit now.The bathroom was in need of Evas services.I managed to open the window, which had obviously not been used for a long time.We were four floors up, but there seemed to be plenty of handholds on the wall.I eased myself through the window and started climbing down, slowly, focusing on the task, hoping Rosie had escaped successfully.It had been a long time since I had practiced rock climbing, and the descent was not as simple as it first seemed.The wall was slippery from rain earlier in the day and my running shoes were not ideal for the task.At one point I slipped and only just managed to grasp a rough brick.I heard shouts from below.When I finally reached the ground, I discovered that a small crowd had formed.Rosie was among them.She flung her arms around me.Oh my God, Don, you could have killed yourself.It didnt matter that much.The risk was minor.It was just important to ignore the height issue.We headed for the subway.Rosie was quite agitated.Freyberg had thought that she was some sort of private investigator, working on behalf of a dissatisfied patient.He was trying to have the security personnel detain her.Whether his position was legally defensible or not, we would have been in a difficult position.Im going to get changed, said Rosie.Our last night in New York City.What do you want to do?My original schedule specified a steakhouse, but now that we were in the pattern of eating together, I would need to select a restaurant suitable for a sustainable seafood eating vegetarian.Well work it out, she said.Lots of options.It took me three minutes to change my shirt.I waited downstairs for Rosie for another six.Finally I went up to her room and knocked.There was a long wait.Then I heard her voice.How long do you think it takes to have a shower?Three minutes, twenty seconds, I said, unless I wash my hair, in which case it takes an extra minute and twelve seconds.The additional time was due primarily to the requirement that the conditioner remain in place for sixty seconds.Hold on.Rosie opened the door wearing only a towel.Her hair was wet, and she looked extremely attractive.I forgot to keep my eyes directed toward her face.Hey, she said.No pendant.She was right.I couldnt use the pendant excuse.But she didnt give me a lecture on inappropriate behavior.Instead, she smiled and stepped toward me.I wasnt sure if she was going to take another step, or if I should.In the end, neither of us did.It was an awkward moment, but I suspected we had both contributed to the problem.You should have brought the ring, said Rosie.For a moment, my brain interpreted ring as wedding ring and began constructing a completely incorrect scenario.Then I realized that she was referring to the spiked ring I had proposed as a means of obtaining Freybergs blood.To come all this way and not get a sample, she said.Fortunately, we have one.You got a sample?How?His bathroom.What a slob.He should get his prostate checked.The floor  Stop, said Rosie.Too much information.But nice work.Very poor hygiene, I told her.For a surgeon.A pseudosurgeon.Incredible waste of surgical skillinserting synthetic materials purely to alter appearance.Wait till youre fifty five and your partners forty five, and see if you say the same thing.Youre supposed to be a feminist, I said, though I was beginning to doubt it.It doesnt mean I want to be unattractive.Your appearance should be irrelevant to your partners assessment of you.Life is full of should bes, said Rosie.Youre the geneticist.Everyone notices how people look.Even you.True.But I dont allow it to affect my evaluation of them.I was on dangerous territory: the issue of Rosies attractiveness had gotten me into serious trouble on the night of the faculty ball.The statement was consistent with my beliefs about judging people and with how I would wish to be judged myself.But I had never had to apply these beliefs to someone standing opposite me in a hotel bedroom wearing only a towel.It dawned on me that I had not told the full truth.Ignoring the testosterone factor, I added.Is there a compliment buried in there somewhere?The conversation was getting complicated.I tried to clarify my position.It would be unreasonable to give you credit for being incredibly beautiful.What I did next was undoubtedly a result of my thoughts being scrambled by a sequence of extraordinary and traumatic incidents in the preceding few hours: the hand holding, the escape from Freybergs office, and the extreme impact of the worlds most beautiful woman standing naked under a towel in front of me.Gene should also take some blame for suggesting that earlobe size was a predictor of sexual attraction.Since I had never been so sexually attracted to a woman before, I was suddenly compelled to examine her ears.In a moment that was, in retrospect, similar to the critical incident in Georges Duhamels Confession de minuit, I reached out and brushed her hair aside.But in this case, amazingly, the response was different from that documented in the novel we had studied in French class.Rosie put her arms around me and kissed me.I think it is likely that my brain is wired in a nonstandard configuration, but my ancestors would not have succeeded in breeding without understanding and responding to basic sexual signals.That aptitude was hardwired in.I kissed Rosie back.She responded.We pulled apart for a moment.It was obvious that dinner would be delayed.Rosie studied me and said, You know, if you changed your glasses and your haircut, you could be Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird.Is that good?I assumed, given the circumstances, that it was, but wanted to hear her confirm it.He was only the sexiest man that ever lived.We looked at each other some more, and I moved to kiss her again.She stopped me.Don, this is New York.Its like a vacation.I dont want you to assume it means anything more.What happens in New York stays in New York, right?It was a line Gene had taught me for conference use.I had never needed to employ it before.It felt a little odd, but appropriate for the circumstances.It was obviously important that we both agreed there was no emotional continuation.Although I did not have a wife at home like Gene, I had a concept of a wife that was very different from Rosie, who would presumably step out on the balcony for a cigarette after sex.Oddly, the prospect didnt repel me as much as it should have.I have to get something from my room, I said.Good thinking.Dont take too long.My room was only eleven floors above Rosies, so I walked up the stairs.Back in my room, I showered, then thumbed through the book Gene had given me.He had been right after all.Incredible.I descended the stairs to Rosies room.Forty three minutes had passed.I knocked on the door, and Rosie answered, now wearing a sleeping costume that was, in fact, more revealing than the towel.She was holding two glasses of champagne.Sorry, its gone a bit flat.I looked around the room.The bed cover was turned down, the curtains were closed, and there was just one bedside lamp on.I gave her Genes book.Since this is our firstand probably onlytime, and you are doubtless more experienced, I recommend that you select the position.Rosie thumbed through the book, then started again.She stopped at the first page, where Gene had written his symbol.Gene gave you this?It was a present for the trip.I tried to read Rosies expression and guessed anger, but that disappeared and she said, in a nonangry tone, Don, Im sorry, I cant do this.Im really sorry.Did I say something wrong?No, its me.Im really sorry.You changed your mind while I was gone?Yeah, said Rosie.Thats what happened.Im sorry.Are you sure I didnt do something wrong?Rosie was my friend, and the risk to our friendship was now at the forefront of my mind.The sex issue had evaporated.No, no, its me, she said.You were incredibly considerate.It was a compliment I was unaccustomed to receiving.A very satisfying compliment.The night had not been a total disaster.I could not sleep.I had not eaten and it was only 8:55 p. m.  Claudia and Gene would be at work now, back in Melbourne, and I did not feel like talking to either of them.I considered it inadvisable to contact Rosie again, so I rang my remaining friend.Dave had eaten already, but we walked to a pizza restaurant and he ate a second dinner.Then we went to a bar and watched baseball and talked about women.I do not recall much of what either of us said, but I suspect that little of it would have been useful in making rational plans for the future.twenty eight   My mind had gone blank.That is a standard phrase, and an exaggeration of the situation.My brain stem continued to function, my heart still beat, I did not forget to breathe.I was able to pack my bag, consume breakfast in my room, navigate to JFK, negotiate check in, and board the plane to Los Angeles.I managed to communicate with Rosie to the extent that it was necessary to coordinate these activities.But reflective functioning was suspended.The reason was obviousemotional overload!My normally well managed emotions had been allowed out in New Yorkon the advice of Claudia, a qualified clinical psychologistand had been dangerously overstimulated.Now they were running amok in my brain, crippling my ability to think.And I needed all my thinking ability to analyze the problem.Rosie had the window seat and I was by the aisle.I followed the pre takeoff safety procedures, for once not dwelling on their unjustified assumptions and irrational priorities.In the event of impending disaster, we would all have something to do.I was in the opposite position.Incapacitated.Rosie put her hand on my arm.How are you feeling, Don?I tried to focus on analyzing one aspect of the experience and the corresponding emotional reaction.I knew where to start.Logically, I did not need to go back to my room to get Genes book.Showing a book to Rosie was not part of the original scenario I had planned back in Melbourne when I prepared for a sexual encounter.I may be socially inept, but with the kiss under way, and Rosie wearing only a towel, there should have been no difficulties in proceeding.My knowledge of positions was a bonus but probably irrelevant the first time.So why did my instincts drive me to a course of action that ultimately sabotaged the opportunity?The first level answer was obvious.They were telling me not to proceed.But why?I identified three possibilities.1.I was afraid that I would fail to perform sexually.It did not take long to dismiss this possibility.I might well have been less competent than a more experienced person and could even have been rendered impotent by fear, though I considered this unlikely.But I was accustomed to being embarrassed, even in front of Rosie.The sexual drive was much stronger than any requirement to protect my image.2.No condom.I realized, on reflection, that Rosie had probably assumed that I had left her room to collect or purchase a condom.Obviously I should have obtained one, in line with all recommendations on safe sex, and presumably the concierge would have some for emergencies, along with spare toothbrushes and razors.The fact that I did not do so was further evidence that subconsciously I did not expect to proceed.Gene had once told me a story about racing around Cairo in a taxi trying to find a condom vendor.My motivation had clearly not been as strong.3.I could not deal with the emotional consequences.The third possibility only entered my mind after I eliminated the first and second.I immediately knewinstinctively!that it was the correct one.My brain was already emotionally overloaded.It was not the death defying climb from the surgeons window or the memory of being interrogated in a dark cellar by a bearded psychiatrist who would stop at nothing to protect his secret.It was not even the experience of holding Rosies hand from the museum to the subway, although that was a contributor.It was the total experience of hanging out with Rosie in New York.My instincts were telling me that if I added any more to this experienceif I added the literally mind blowing experience of having sex with hermy emotions would take over my brain.And they would drive me toward a relationship with Rosie.That would be a disaster for two reasons.The first was that she was totally unsuitable in the longer term.The second was that she had made it clear that such a relationship would not extend beyond our time in New York.These reasons were completely contradictory, mutually exclusive, and based on entirely different premises.I had no idea which one was correct.We were in the final stages of our descent into LAX.I turned to Rosie.It had been several hours since she asked her question, and I had now given it considerable thought.How was I feeling?Confused, I said to her.I expected her to have forgotten the question, but perhaps the answer made sense in any case.Welcome to the real world.I managed to stay awake for the first six hours of the fifteen hour flight home from LA in order to reset my internal clock, but it was difficult.Rosie had slept for a few hours, then watched a movie.I looked over and saw that she was crying.She removed her headphones and wiped her eyes.Youre crying, I said.Is there a problem?Busted, said Rosie.Its just a sad story.Bridges of Madison County.I presume you dont cry at movies.Correct.I realized that this might be viewed as a negative, so added, in defense, It seems to be a predominantly female behavior.Thanks for that.Rosie went quiet again but seemed to have recovered from the sadness that the movie had stimulated.Tell me, she said, do you feel anything when you watch a movie?Youve seen Casablanca?I was familiar with this question.Gene and Claudia had asked it after we watched a DVD together.So my answer was the result of reflection.Ive seen several romantic movies.The answer is no.Unlike Gene and Claudia, and apparently the majority of the human race, I am not emotionally affected by love stories.I dont appear to be wired for that response.I visited Claudia and Gene for dinner on Sunday night.I was feeling unusually jet lagged, and as a result had some difficulty in providing a coherent account of the trip.I tried to talk about my meeting with David Borenstein at Columbia, what I saw at the museums, and the meal at Momofuku Ko, but they were obsessed with grilling me about my interactions with Rosie.I could not reasonably be expected to remember every detail.And obviously I could not talk about the Father Project activities.Claudia was very pleased with the scarf, but it provided another opportunity for interrogation.Did Rosie help you choose this?Rosie, Rosie, Rosie.The sales assistant recommended it.It was very straightforward.As I left, Claudia said, So, Don, are you planning to see Rosie again?Next Saturday, I said, truthfully, not bothering to tell her that it was not a social occasion: we had scheduled the afternoon to analyze the DNA.She seemed satisfied.I was eating lunch alone in the University Club, reviewing the Father Project file, when Gene arrived with his meal and a glass of wine and sat opposite me.I tried to put the file away but succeeded only in giving him the correct impression that I was trying to hide something.Gene suddenly looked over at the service counter, behind me.Oh God!he said.I turned to look and Gene snatched the folder, laughing.Thats private, I said, but Gene had opened it.The photo of the graduating class was on top.Gene seemed genuinely surprised.My God.Where did you get this?He was studying the photo intently.It must be thirty years old.Whats all the scribble?Organizing a reunion, I said.Helping a friend.Weeks ago.It was a good answer, considering the short time I had to formulate it, but it did have a major defect.Gene detected it.A friend?Right.One of your many friends.You should have invited me.Why?Who do you think took the photo?Of course.Someone had been required to take the photo.I was too stunned to speak.I was the only outsider, said Gene.The genetics tutor.Big nighteveryone pumped, no partners.Hottest ticket in town.Gene pointed to a face in the photo.I had always focused on the males and never looked for Rosies mother.But now that Gene was pointing to her, she was easy to identify.The resemblance was obvious, including the red hair, although the color was less dramatic than Rosies.She was standing between Isaac Esler and Geoffrey Case.As in Isaac Eslers wedding photo, Case was smiling broadly.Bernadette OConnor.Gene sipped his wine.Irish.I was familiar with the tone of Genes statement.There was a reason for his remembering this particular woman, and it was not that she was Rosies mother.In fact, it seemed that he didnt know the connection, and I made a quick decision not to inform him.His finger moved one space to the left.Geoffrey Case.Not a great return on his tuition fees.He died, correct?Killed himself.This was new information.Are you sure?Of course Im sure, said Gene.Come on, whats this about?I ignored the question.Why did he do it?Probably forgot to take his lithium, said Gene.He had bipolar disorder.Life of the party on a good day.He looked at me.I assumed he was about to interrogate me as to the reason for my interest in Geoffrey Case and the reunion, and I was thinking frantically to invent a plausible explanation.I was saved by an empty pepper grinder.Gene gave it a twist, then walked away to exchange it.I used a table napkin to swab his wineglass and left before he returned.twenty nine   I cycled to the university on Saturday morning with an unidentifiable, and therefore disconcerting, emotion.Things were settling back into their normal pattern.The days testing would mark the end of the Father Project.At worst, Rosie might find a person that we had overlookedanother tutor or caterer or perhaps someone who had left the party earlybut a single additional test would not take long.And I would have no reason to see Rosie again.We met at the lab.There were three samples to test: the swab from Isaac Eslers fork, a urine sample on toilet paper from Freybergs floor, and Genes table napkin.I had still not told Rosie about the handkerchief from Margaret Case but was anxious to get a result on Genes sample.There was a strong possibility that Gene was Rosies father.I tried not to think about it, but it was consistent with Genes reaction to the photo, his identification of Rosies mother, and his history of casual sex.Whats the napkin?asked Rosie.I was expecting this question.Retest.One of the earlier samples was contaminated.My improving ability at deception was not enough to fool Rosie.Bullshit.Who is it?Its Case, isnt it?You got a sample for Geoffrey Case.It would have been easy to say yes, but identifying the sample as Cases would create great confusion if it tested positive.A web of lies.Ill tell you if its the one, I said.Tell me now, said Rosie.It is the one.How can you know?I just know.You have zero evidence.Isaac Eslers story makes him an excellent candidate.He was committed to getting married to someone else right after the party.He admits to being drunk.He was evasive at dinner.Hes standing next to your mother in the photo.This was something we had not discussed before.It was such an obvious thing to have checked.Gene had once given me an exercise to do at conferences: If you want to know whos sleeping with who, just look at who they sit with at breakfast.Whoever Rosies mother had been with that night would likely be standing next to her.Unless of course he was required to take the photo.My intuition versus your logic.Wanna bet?It would have been unfair to take the bet.I had the advantage of the knowledge from the basement encounter.Realistically, I considered Isaac Esler, Gene, and Geoffrey Case to be equally likely.I had mulled over Eslers reference to people involved and concluded that it was ambiguous.He might have been protecting his friend, but he could equally have been hiding behind him.Though if Esler was not himself the father, he could simply have told me to test his sample.Perhaps his plan was to confuse me, in which case it had succeeded, but only temporarily.Eslers deceptive behavior had caused me to review an earlier decision.If we reached a point where we had eliminated all other candidates, including Esler, I would test the sample I had collected from Margaret Case.Anyway its definitely not Freyberg, said Rosie, interrupting my thinking.Why not?Freyberg was the least likely but certainly not impossible.Green eyes.I should have thought of it at the time.She interpreted my expression correctly: disbelief.Come on, youre the geneticist.Hes got green eyes, so he cant be my father.I checked it on the Internet.Amazing.She retains a professor of genetics, an alien of extraordinary abilities, to help find her father, she travels for a week, spending almost every minute of the waking day with him, yet when she wants the answer to a question on genetics, she goes to the Internet.Those models are simplifications.Don, my mother had blue eyes.I have brown eyes.My real father had to have brown eyes, right?Wrong, I said.Highly likely but not certain.The genetics of eye color are extremely complex.Green is possible.Also blue.A medical studenta doctorwould know that, wouldnt she?Rosie was obviously referring to her mother.I thought it was probably not the right time to give Rosie a detailed account of the deficiencies in medical education.I just said, Highly unlikely.Gene used to teach genetics to medical students.Thats a typical Gene simplification.Fuck Gene, said Rosie.I am so over Gene.Just test the napkin.Its the one.But she sounded less sure.What are you going to do when you find out?This question should have been asked earlier.Failure to raise it was another result of lack of planning, but now that I could picture Gene as the father, Rosies future actions became more relevant to me.Funny you should ask, said Rosie.I said it was about closure.But I think, subconsciously, I had this fantasy that my real father would come riding in and ...deal with Phil.For failing to keep the Disneyland promise?It would surely be difficult to devise a suitable punishment after so much time.I said it was a fantasy, she said.I saw him as some sort of hero.But now I know its one of three people, and Ive met two of them.Isaac Esler: We must not revisit the past lightly.Max Freyberg: I consider myself a restorer of self esteem.Assholes, both of them.Just weak guys who ran away.The lack of logic here was astounding.At most, one of them had deserted her.Geoffrey Case ...I began, thinking Rosies characterization would not apply to him, but if Rosie knew about the manner of his death, she might interpret it as a means of escaping his responsibilities.I know, I know.But if it turns out to be someone else, some middle aged guy whos pretending to be something he isnt, then times up, douche bag.Youre planning to expose him?I asked, horrified.Suddenly it struck me that I could be involved in causing great pain to someone, very possibly my best friend.To his whole family!Rosies mother had not wanted Rosie to know.Perhaps this was why.By default, Rosies mother knew more about human behavior than I did.Correct.But youll be inflicting pain.For no compensatory gain.Ill feel better.Incorrect, I said.Research shows that revenge adds to the distress of the victim  Thats my choice.There was the possibility that Rosies father was Geoffrey Case, in which case all three samples would test negative, and it would be too late for Rosie to wreak her revenge.I did not want to rely on that possibility.I turned off the machine.Stop, said Rosie.I have a right to know.Not if it causes suffering.What about me?she said.Dont you care about me?She was becoming emotional.I felt very calm.Reason was in control again.My thoughts were straight.I care about you enormously.So I cant contribute to your doing something immoral.Don, if you dont do the test, Im never going to speak to you again.Ever.This information was painful to process but rationally entirely predictable.Id assumed that was inevitable, I said.The project will be complete, and youve indicated no further interest in the sexual aspect.So its my fault?said Rosie.Of course its my fault.Im not a fucking nonsmoking teetotal chef with a PhD.Im not organized.Ive deleted the nondrinking requirement.I realized that she was referring to the Wife Project.But what was she saying?That she was evaluating herself according to the criteria of the Wife Project?Which meant  You considered me as a partner?Sure, she said.Except for the fact that you have no idea of social behavior, your lifes ruled by a whiteboard, and youre incapable of feeling loveyoure perfect.She walked out, slamming the door behind her.I turned the machine on.Without Rosie in the room, I could safely test the samples and then decide what to do with them.Then I heard the door open again.I turned around, expecting to see Rosie.Instead it was the Dean.Working on your secret project, Professor Tillman?I was in serious trouble.In all previous encounters with the Dean, I had been following the rules, or the infraction had been too minor to punish.Using the DNA machine for private purposes was a substantial breach of the Genetics Department regulations.How much did she know?She did not normally work on weekends.Her presence was not an accident.Fascinating stuff, according to Simon Lefebvre, said the Dean.He comes into my office and asks me about a project in my own faculty.One that apparently requires that we collect his DNA.As you do.I gather there was some sort of joke involved.Pardon my lack of humor, but I was at a slight disadvantagehaving never heard of the project.Surely, I thought, I would have seen the proposal when it went to the ethics committee.Up to this point, the Dean had seemed cool and rational.Now she raised her voice.Ive been trying for two years to get the Medical Faculty to fund a joint research projectand you decide not only to behave grossly unethically but to do it to the man who holds the purse strings.I want a written report.If it doesnt include an ethics approval that I somehow havent seen yet, well be advertising an associate professor position.The Dean stopped at the door.Im still holding your complaint about Kevin Yu.You might want to think about that.And Ill have your lab key, thank you.The Father Project was over.Officially.Gene came into my office the following day as I was completing an EPDS questionnaire.Are you okay?he said.This was a timely question.I suspect not.Ill tell you in approximately fifteen seconds.I completed the questionnaire, calculated the result, and passed it to Gene.Sixteen, I told him.Second highest score ever.Gene looked at it.Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.Do I have to point out that you havent had a baby recently?I dont answer the baby related questions.It was the only depression instrument Claudia had at home when my sister died.Ive continued using it for consistency.This is what we call getting in touch with our feelings, is it?said Gene.I sensed that the question was rhetorical and did not reply.Listen, he said, I think I can fix this thing for you.You have news from Rosie?For Chrissakes, Don, said Gene.I have news from the Dean.I dont know what youve been doing, but DNA testing without ethics approvalthats career over.I knew this.I had decided to phone Amghad, the golf club boss, and ask him about the cocktail bar partnership.It seemed like time to do something different.It had been a weekend of rude awakenings.I had arrived home after the interaction with the Dean to find that Eva, my housekeeper, had filled in a copy of the Wife Project questionnaire.On the front, she had written, Don.Nobody is perfect.Eva.In my state of heightened vulnerability, I had been extremely affected by this.Eva was a good person whose short skirts were perhaps intended to attract a partner and who would have been embarrassed by her relatively low socioeconomic status as she answered questions about postgraduate qualifications and appreciation of expensive food.I reflected on all the women who had completed my questionnaire, hoping they might find a partner.Hoping that partner might be me, even though they did not know much about me and would probably be disappointed if they did.I had poured myself a glass of pinot noir and gone out to the balcony.The city lights reminded me of the lobster dinner with Rosie that, contrary to the predictions of the questionnaire, had been one of the most enjoyable meals of my life.Claudia had told me I was being too picky, but Rosie had demonstrated in New York that my assessment of what would make me happy was totally incorrect.I sipped the wine slowly and watched the view change.A window went dark, a traffic light changed from red to green, an ambulances flashing lights bounced off the buildings.And it dawned on me that I had not designed the questionnaire to find a woman I could accept but to find someone who might accept me.Regardless of what decisions I might make as a result of my experiences with Rosie, I would not use the questionnaire again.The Wife Project was over.Gene had more to say.No job, no structure, no schedule.Youll fall apart.He looked at the depression questionnaire again.Youre falling apart already.Listen.Im going to say that it was a Psych Department project.Well make up an ethics application, and you can say you thought it had been approved.Gene was obviously doing his best to be helpful.I smiled for his benefit.Does that take a few points off the score?he said, waving the EPDS questionnaire.I suspect not.There was a silence.Neither of us apparently had anything to say.I expected Gene to leave.But he tried again.Help me here, Don.Its Rosie, isnt it?It makes no sense.Let me put this simply, said Gene.Youre unhappyso unhappy that youve lost perspective on your career, your reputation, your holy schedule.This was true.Shit, Don, you broke the rules.Since when do you break rules?It was a good question.I respect rules.But in the last ninety nine days, I had broken many rules, legal, ethical, and personal.I knew exactly when it had started.The day Rosie walked into my office and I hacked into Le Gavroches reservation system so I could go on a date with her.All this because of a woman?said Gene.Apparently.Its totally irrational.I felt embarrassed.It was one thing to make a social error, another to admit that rationality had deserted me.Its only irrational if you believe in your questionnaire.The EPDS is highly  Im talking about your Do you eat kidneys?questionnaire.Id say genetics one, questionnaire nil.You consider the situation with Rosie to be the result of genetic compatibility?You have such a way with words, Gene said.If you want to be a bit more romantic about it, Id say you were in love.This was an extraordinary statement.It also made absolute sense.I had assumed that romantic love would always be outside my realm of experience.But it perfectly accounted for my current situation.I wanted to be sure.This is your professional opinion?As an expert on human attraction?Gene nodded.Excellent.Genes insight had transformed my mental state.Not sure how that helps, said Gene.Rosie identified three faults.Fault number one was the inability to feel love.There are only two left to rectify.And they would be?Social protocols and adherence to schedules.Trivial.
