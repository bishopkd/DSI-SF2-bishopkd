She pulls my hand towards her."You're wonderful" she says softly, and at that moment she falls in love with me, too; this I know, for I have seen the signs a thousand times.She says nothing else right away, she doesn't have to, and she gives me a look from another lifetime that makes me whole again.I smile back, with as much passion as I can muster, and we stare at each other with the feelings inside us rolling like ocean waves.I look about the room, then back at Allie, and the way she's looking at me makes me warm.And suddenly I feel young again.I'm no longer cold or aching, or hunched over or almost blind with cataracts.I'm strong and proud and the luckiest man alive, and I keep on feeling that way for a long time.By the time the candles have burned down a third, I am ready to break the silence.I say, "I love you deeply and I hope you know that. ""Of course I do," she says."I've always loved you, Noah. "Noah, I hear again.The word echoes in my head.Noah Noah.She knows, I think to myself, she knows who I am  She knows Such a tiny thing, this knowledge, but for me it is a gift from God, and I feel our lifetime together, holding her, loving her, and being with her through the best years of my life.She murmurs, "Noah my sweet Noah  And I, who could not accept the doctors' words, have triumphed again, at least for a moment.I give up the pretence of mystery, and I kiss her hand and bring it to my cheek and whisper in her ear: "You are the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. ""Oh Noah," she says with tears in her eyes, "I love you, too. "IF ONLY IT would end like this, I would be a happy man.But it won't.Of this I'm sure, for as time slips by I begin to see the signs of concern in her face."What's wrong?"I ask, and her answer comes softly."I'm so afraid.I'm afraid of forgetting you again.It isn't fair I just can't bear to give this up. "Her voice breaks as she finishes, but I don't know what to say.I know the evening is coming to an end and there is nothing I can do to stop the inevitable.In this I am a failure.I finally tell her: "I'll never leave you.What we have is for ever. "She knows this is all I can do, for neither of us wants empty promises.The crickets serenade us, and we begin to pick at our dinner.Neither one of us is hungry, but I lead by example and she follows me.She takes small bites and chews a long time, but I am glad to see her eat.She has lost too much weight in the past three months.After dinner, I become afraid for I know the bell has tolled this evening.The sun has long since set and the thief is about to come, and there is nothing I can do to stop it.So I stare at her and wait and live a lifetime in these last remaining moments.The clock ticks.Nothing.I take her in my arms and we hold each other.Nothing.I feel her tremble and I whisper in her ear.Nothing.I tell her for the last time this evening that I love her.And the thief comes.It always amazes me how quickly it happens.Even now, after all this time.For as she holds me, she begins to blink rapidly and shake her head.Then, turning towards the corner of the room, she stares for a long time, concern etched on her face.No!my mind screams.Not yet!Not now not when we're so close!Not tonight!Any night but tonight Please!I can't take it again!It isn't fair..It isn't fair  But once again, it is to no avail."Those people," she finally says, pointing, "are staring at me.Please make them stop. "The gnomes.A pit rises in my stomach, hard and full.My mouth goes dry and I feel my heart pounding.It is over, I know.This, the evening confusion that affects my wife, is the hardest part of all.For when it comes, she is gone, and sometimes I wonder whether she and I will ever love again."There's no one there, Allie," I say, trying to fend off the inevitable.She doesn't believe me."They're staring at me.You can't see them?""No," I say, and she thinks for a moment."Well, they're right there," she says, "and they're staring at me. "With that, she begins to talk to herself, and moments later, when I try to comfort her, she flinches with wide eyes."Who are you?"she cries in panic, her face becoming whiter."What are you doing here?"She backs away from me, her hands in a defensive position, and then she says the most heartbreaking words of all."Go away!Stay away from me!"She is pushing the gnomes away from her, terrified, oblivious of my presence.I stand and cross the room to her bed.I am weak now, my legs ache, and there is a strange pain in my side.It is a struggle to press the button to call the nurses, for my fingers are throbbing and seem frozen together, but I finally succeed.They will be here soon now, I know, and I wait for them.I sit by the bed with an aching back and start to cry as I pick up the notebook.I am tired now, so I sit, alone and apart from my wife.And when the nurses come in they see two people they must comfort.A woman shaking in fear and the old man who loves her more deeply than life itself crying softly in the corner, his face in his hands.BY THE following week, my life had pretty much returned to normal.Or at least as normal as my life could be.Reading to Allie, who was unable to recognize me at any time, reading to others, wandering the halls.Lying awake at night and sitting by my heater in the morning.I found a strange comfort in the predictability of my life.On a cool, foggy morning eight days after she and I had spent our day together, I woke early, as is my custom, and pottered around my desk, alternately looking at photographs and reading letters written many years before.At least I tried to.I couldn't concentrate too well because I had a headache, so I put them aside and went to sit in my chair by the window to watch the sun come up.Allie would be awake in a couple of hours, I knew, and I wanted to be refreshed, for reading all day would only make my head hurt more.I closed my eyes for a few minutes then, opening them, I watched my old friend, the creek, roll by my window.Unlike Allie I had been given a room where I could see it, and it has never failed to inspire me.It is a contradiction this creek a hundred thousand years old but renewed with each rainfall.It is life, I think, to watch the water.A man can learn so many things.It happened as I sat in the chair, just as the sun peeped over the horizon.My hand, I noticed, started to tingle, something it had never done before.I started to lift it, but I was forced to stop when my head pounded again, this time hard, almost as if I had been hit in the head with a hammer.I closed my eyes tightly.My hand stopped tingling and began to go numb, as if my nerves had been severed somewhere on my lower arm.A shooting pain rocked my head and seemed to flow down my neck and into every cell of my body, like a tidal wave, crushing and wasting everything in its path.I lost my sight and I heard what sounded like a train roaring inches from my head, and I knew that I was having a stroke.The pain coursed through my body like a lightning bolt, and in my last remaining moments of consciousness I pictured Allie, lying in her bed, waiting for the story I would never read, lost and confused, completely and totally unable to help herself.I WAS UNCONSCIOUS on and off for days, and in those moments when I was awake I found myself hooked to machines, two bags of fluid hanging near the bed.I could hear the faint hum of machines, sometimes making sounds I could not recognize, and found myself lulled to never never land time and time again.I could see the concern in the doctors' faces as they scanned the charts and adjusted the machines.Grim faces would prelude their predictions "loss of speech, loss of movement, paralysis. "Another chart notation, another beep of a strange machine, and they'd leave, never knowing I heard every word.I tried not to think of these things afterwards, but instead concentrated on Allie, bringing a picture of her to my mind whenever I could.I tried to feel her touch, hear her voice, and when I did tears would fill my eyes because I didn't know if I would be able to hold her again.This was not how I'd imagined it would end.I'd always assumed I would go last.I drifted in and out of consciousness for days until another foggy morning when my promise to Allie spurred my body once again.I opened my eyes and saw a room full of flowers, and their scent motivated me further.I looked for the buzzer, struggled to press it, and a nurse arrived thirty seconds later, followed closely by Dr.Barnwell."I'm thirsty," I said with a raspy voice, and Dr.Barnwell smiled broadly."Welcome back," he said, "I knew you'd make it. "TWO WEEKS LATER I am able to leave the hospital, though I am only half a man now.The right side of my body is weaker than the left.This, they tell me, is good news, for the paralysis could have been total.Sometimes, it seems, I am surrounded by optimists.The bad news is that my hands prevent me from using either my cane or wheelchair, so I must march now to my own unique cadence to keep upright.Not left right left as in my youth, or even the shuffle shuffle of late, but rather slow shuffle, slide the right, slow shuffle.I am on an epic adventure now when I travel the halls.When I return to my room, I know I will not sleep.I breathe deeply and smell the springtime fragrances that filter through the open window.There is a slight chill in the air and I find that I am invigorated by the change in temperature.Evelyn, one of the many nurses here, helps me to the chair by the window.She puts her hand on my shoulder and pats it gently.She says nothing, and by her silence I know that she is staring out of the window.Then she leans forward and tenderly kisses me on the cheek."It's good to have you back.Allie's missed you and so have the rest of us.We were all praying for you because it's just not the same around here when you're gone. "She smiles at me and touches my face before she leaves.I say nothing.The stars are out tonight and the crickets are singing.As I sit, I wonder if anyone outside can see me, this prisoner of flesh.I search the courtyard, looking for signs of life, but there is nothing.Even the creek is still.In the darkness it looks like empty space and I find that I'm drawn to its mystery.I watch for hours, and as I do I see the reflection of clouds on the water.A storm is coming and in time the sky will turn silver, like dusk again.Lightning cuts the wild sky and I feel my mind drift back.Who are we, Allie and I?Are we ancient ivy on a cypress tree, tendrils and branches intertwined so closely that we would both die if we were forced apart?Another bolt and the table beside me is lit enough to enable me to see a picture of Allie, the best one I have.I had it framed years ago in the hope that the glass would make it last for ever.I reach for it and hold it inches from my face.She was forty one when it was taken, and she had never been more beautiful.There are so many things I want to ask her, but I know the picture won't answer, so I put it aside.I finally stand and walk to my desk and turn on the lamp.This takes more effort than I think it will, and I am strained, so I do not return to the window seat.I sit down and spend a few minutes looking at the pictures on my desk.Family pictures, pictures of children and vacations.Pictures of Allie and me.Since this seems to be a night of memories, I look for and find my wedding ring.It is in the top drawer, wrapped in tissue.I cannot wear it any more because my knuckles are swollen and my fingers lack for blood.I unwrap the tissue and find it unchanged.It is powerful a symbol, a circle and I know, I know, there could never have been another.I whisper aloud, "I am still yours, Allie, my queen, my timeless beauty.You are, and always have been, the best thing in my life. "It is eleven thirty and I look for the letter she wrote to me, the one I read when the mood strikes me.I find it where I last left it.I open it and my hands begin to tremble:   Dear Noah,  I write this letter by candlelight as you lie sleeping in the bedroom we have shared since the day we were married.I see the flame beside me and it reminds me of another fire from decades ago, with me in your soft clothes, and I knew then we would always be together, even though I wavered the following day.My heart had been captured by a southern poet, and I knew inside that it had always been yours.Who was I to question a love that rode on shooting stars and roared like crashing waves?For that is what it was between us then and that is what it is today.I remember coming back to you the day after my mother left.I was so scared because I was sure you would never forgive me for leaving you.I was shaking as I got out of the car, but you took it all away with your smile."How about some coffee?"was all you said.And you never brought it up again in all our years together.Nor did you question me when I would leave and walk alone during the next few days.When I came in with tears in my eyes, you always knew whether I needed you to hold me or to just let me be.I don't know how but you did, and you made it easier for me.Later, when we went to the small chapel and exchanged our rings and made our vows, I looked into your eyes and knew I had made the right decision.More than that, I knew I was foolish for ever considering someone else.I have never wavered since.We had a wonderful life together, and I think about it a lot now.I close my eyes sometimes and see you with speckles of grey in your hair, sitting on the porch and playing your guitar while little ones play and clap to the music you create."You're a better father than you know," I tell you later, after the children are sleeping.I love you for many things, especially your passions: love and poetry and fatherhood and friendship and beauty and nature.And I am glad you have taught the children these things, for I know their lives are better for it.They tell me how special you are to them, and it makes me feel like the luckiest woman alive.You have taught me as well, and inspired me and supported me in my painting, and you will never know how much it has meant to me that you were always there, encouraging me.You understood my need for my own studio, my own space, and saw beyond the paint on my clothes and in my hair.I know it was not easy.It takes a man to do that, Noah, to live with something like that.And you have.For forty five years now.Wonderful years.You are my best friend as well as my lover, and I do not know which side of you I enjoy the most.I treasure each side, just as I have treasured our life together.You have something inside you, Noah, something beautiful and strong.Kindness, that's what I see when I look at you now, that's what everyone sees.Kindness.I know you think me crazy for making us write our story before we finally leave our home, but I have my reasons and I thank you for your patience.I never told you why, but now I think it is time you knew.We have lived a lifetime most couples never know, and when I look at you I am frightened by the knowledge that all this will be ending soon.For we both know my prognosis.I worry more about you than I do about me, because I fear the pain I know you will go through.There are no words to express my sorrow for this.I love you so deeply, so incredibly much, that I will find a way to come back to you despite my disease, I promise you that.And this is where the story comes in.When I am lost and lonely, read this story just as you told it to the children and know that in some way I will realize it's about us.And perhaps, just perhaps, we will find a way to be together again.Please don't be angry with me on days I do not remember you  we both know they will come.Know that I will always love you, and no matter what happens, know that I have led the greatest life possible.My life with you.Noah, wherever you are and whenever you read this, I love you.I love you deeply, my husband.You are, and always have been, my dream.Allie   I put the letter aside, rise from my desk and find my slippers.I must sit to put them on.Then, standing, I cross the room and open my door.I peep down the hall and see Janice seated at the main desk which I must pass to get to Allie's room.At this hour I am not supposed to leave my room, and Janice is never one to bend the rules.I wait to see if she will leave, but she does not and I grow impatient.I finally exit my room anyway, slow shuffle, slide the right, slow shuffle.It takes aeons to close the distance, but for some reason she does not see me approaching.I am a silent panther creeping through the jungle.In the end I am discovered, but I am not surprised.I stand before her."Noah," she says, "what are you doing?""I'm taking a walk," I say."I can't sleep. ""You know you're not supposed to do this. ""I know. "I don't move, though.I am determined."You're not really going for a walk, are you?You're going to see Allie. ""Yes," I answer."Noah, you know what happened the last time you saw her at night.You shouldn't be doing this. ""I miss her. ""I know you do, but I can't let you see her. ""It's our anniversary," I say.This is true.It is one year before gold.Forty nine years today."I see. "She looks away for a moment, and her voice becomes softer.I am surprised.She has never struck me as the sentimental type."Noah, I've seen hundreds of couples struggle with grief, but I've never seen anyone handle it like you do.No one around here has ever seen anything like it. "She pauses for just a moment and her eyes begin to fill with tears."I try to think what it's like for you, how you keep going day after day, but I can't imagine it.I don't know how you do it.You even beat her disease sometimes.Even though the doctors don't understand it, we nurses do.It's love it's as simple as that.It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen. "A lump has risen in my throat, and I am speechless."But, Noah, you're not supposed to do this, and I can't let you.So go back to your room. "Then, smiling, sniffling and shuffling some papers, she says: "Me, I'm going downstairs for some coffee.I won't be back to check on you for a while, so don't do anything foolish. "She rises quickly, touches my arm and walks towards the stairs.She doesn't look back and suddenly I am alone.I look at where she had been sitting and see her coffee, a full cup, still steaming, and once again I learn that there are good people in the world.As I begin my trek to Allie's room, I take tiny steps, and even at that pace my legs grow tired.I find I must touch the wall to keep from falling down.Lights buzz overhead, their fluorescent glow making my eyes ache, and I squint a little.I press on, and the movement forces blood through banished arteries.I feel myself becoming stronger with every step.A phone rings in the nurses' station, and I push forward so that I will not be caught.I am young and strong, with passion in my heart, and I will break down the door and lift her in my arms and carry her to paradise.Who am I kidding?I lead a simple life now.I am foolish, an old man in love, a dreamer who dreams of nothing but reading to Allie and holding her whenever I can.I am a sinner with many faults and a man who believes in magic, but I am too old to change and too old to care.When I finally reach her room my body is weak.My legs wobble, my eyes are blurred.I struggle with the knob and in the end it takes two hands and three truckloads of effort.The door opens and light from the hallway spills in, illuminating the bed where she sleeps.She is lying with the covers halfway up.After a moment I see her roll to one side, and her noises bring back memories of happier times.She looks small in her bed.I do not move, on this our anniversary, for almost a minute, and I long to tell her how I feel, but I stay quiet so I won't wake her.Besides, it is written on the slip of paper that I will slide under her pillow.It says:  		Love, in these last and tender hours, 		is sensitive and very pure 		Come morning light with soft lit powers 		to awaken love that's ever sure.I think I hear someone coming, so I enter her room and close the door behind me.Blackness descends and I cross her floor from memory and reach the window.I open the curtains, and the moon stares back, large and full, the guardian of the evening.Though I know I should not, I sit on her bed while I slip the note beneath her pillow.Then I reach across and gently touch her face.I stroke her hair, and I feel wonder, like a composer first discovering the works of Mozart.She stirs and opens her eyes and I suddenly regret my foolishness, for I know she will begin to cry and scream, for this is what she always does.But I feel an urge to attempt the impossible and lean towards her, our faces drawing closer.When her lips meet mine, I feel a tingling I have never felt before, in all our years together, but I do not pull back.And suddenly a miracle, for I feel her mouth open and I discover a forgotten paradise, unchanged all this time, ageless like the stars.I feel the warmth of her body and allow myself to slip away, as I did so many years ago.I close my eyes and become a mighty ship in churning waters, strong and fearless, and she is my sails.I gently trace the outline of her cheek, then take her hand in mine.I kiss her lips, her cheeks, and listen as she takes a breath.She murmurs softly, "Oh, Noah I've missed you. "Another miracle the greatest of all!and there's no way I can stop the tears as we begin to slip towards heaven itself.For at that moment, the world is full of wonder as I feel her fingers reach for the buttons on my shirt and slowly, ever so slowly, she begins to undo them one by one.
