Oh should I be surprised by this?I know so little about the scene I dont know.Were you collared?I whisper.Yes.By Mrs.Robinson?Mrs.Robinson!he laughs loudly, freely, and he looks so young and carefree, his head thrown back, his laughter infectious.I grin back at him.Ill tell her you said that, shell love it.You still talk to her regularly?I cant keep the shock out of my voice.Yes.Hes serious now.Oh and part of me is suddenly insanely jealous  Im disturbed by the depth of my feeling.I see.My voice is tight.So you have someone you can discuss your alternative lifestyle with, but Im not allowed.He frowns.I dont think Ive ever thought about it like that.Mrs.Robinson was part of that lifestyle.I told you, shes a good friend now.If youd like, I can introduce you to one of my former subs, you could talk to her.What?Is he deliberately trying to upset me?Is this your idea of a joke?No, Anastasia.Hes bemused as he shakes his head earnestly.No  Ill do this on my own, thank you very much, I snap at him, pulling the duvet up to my chin.He stares at me, at sea, surprised.Anastasia, I  Hes lost for words.A first, I think.I didnt mean to offend you.Im not offended.Im appalled.Appalled?I dont want to talk to one of your ex girlfriends slave sub whatever you call them.Anastasia Steele  are you jealous?I flush, crimson.Are you staying?I have a breakfast meeting tomorrow at the Heathman.Besides, I told you, I dont sleep with girlfriends, slaves, subs, or anyone.Friday and Saturday night were exceptions.It wont happen again.I can hear the resolve behind his soft, husky voice.I purse my lips at him.Well Im tired now.Are you kicking me out?He raises his eyebrows at me, amused and a little dismayed.Yes.Well thats another first.He eyes me speculatively.So nothing you want to discuss now?About the contract.No.I reply petulantly.God, Id like to give you a good hiding.Youd feel a lot better, and so would I.   You cant say things like that I havent signed anything yet.A man can dream, Anastasia.He leans over me and grasps my chin.Wednesday?he murmurs, and he kisses me lightly on my lips.Wednesday, I agree.Ill see you out.If you give me a minute.I sit up and grab my t shirt, pushing him out of the way.Amused and reluctant, he gets up off the bed.Please pass me my sweat pants.He collects them from the floor and hands them to me.Yes, maam.Hes trying unsuccessfully to hide his smile.I narrow my eyes at him as I slip the pants on.My hair is a state, and I know Ill have to face the Katherine Kavanagh Inquisition after hes gone.Grabbing a hair tie, I walk to my bedroom door, opening it slightly checking for Kate.She is not in the living area.I think I can hear her on the phone in her room.Christian follows me out.During the short walk from bedroom to front door, my thoughts and feelings ebb and flow, transforming.Im no longer angry with him, I feel suddenly unbearably shy.I dont want him to go.For the first time, Im wishing he was  normal  wanting a normal relationship that doesnt need a ten page agreement, a flogger, and karabiners in his playroom ceiling.I open the door for him and stare down at my hands.This is the first time I have ever had sex in my home, and as sex goes, I think it was pretty damn fine.But now I feel like a receptacle  an empty vessel to be filled at his whim.My subconscious shakes her head.You wanted to run to the Heathman for sex  you had it express delivered.She crosses her arms and taps her foot with a what are you complaining about look on her face.Christian stops in the doorway and clasps my chin, forcing my eyes to meet his.His brow creases slightly.You okay?he asks tenderly as his thumb lightly caresses my bottom lip.Yes.I reply, though in all honesty Im just not sure.I feel a paradigm shift.I know that if I do this thing with him, I will get hurt.Hes not capable, interested, or willing to offer me any more and I want more.Much more.The surge of jealousy I felt only moments ago tells me that I have deeper feelings for him than I have admitted to myself.Wednesday, he confirms, and he leans forward and kisses me softly.Something changes while hes kissing me, his lips grow more urgent against mine, his hand moves up from my chin and hes holding the side of my head, his other hand on the other side.His breathing accelerates.He deepens the kiss, leaning into me.I put my hands on his arms.I want to run them through his hair, but I resist, knowing that he wont like it.He leans his forehead against mine, his eyes closed, his voice strained.Anastasia, he whispers.What are you doing to me?I could say the same to you, I whisper back.Taking a deep breath, he kisses my forehead and leaves.He strolls purposefully down the path towards his car as he runs his hand through his hair.Glancing up as he opens his car door, he smiles his breathtaking smile.My answering smile is weak, completely dazzled by him, and Im reminded once more of Icarus soaring too close to the Sun.I close the front door as he climbs into his sporty car.I have an overwhelming urge to cry, a sad and lonely melancholy grips and tightens round my heart.Dashing back to my bedroom, I close the door and lean against it trying to rationalize my feelings.I cant.Sliding to the floor, I put my head in my hands as my tears begin to flow.Kate knocks gently.Ana?she whispers.I open the door.She takes one look at me and throws her arms around me.Whats wrong?What did that creepy good looking bastard do?Oh Kate, nothing I didnt want him to.She pulls me to my bed and we sit.You have dreadful sex hair.In spite of my poignant sadness, I laugh.It was good sex, not dreadful at all.Kate smiles.Thats better.Why are you crying?You never cry.She retrieves my brush from the side table, and sitting behind me, very slowly starts brushing out the knots.I just dont think our relationship is going to go anywhere.I stare down at my fingers.I thought you said you were going to see him on Wednesday?I am, that was our original plan.So, why did he turn up here today?I sent him an email.Asking him to drop by?No, saying I didnt want to see him anymore.And he turns up?Ana, thats genius.Actually it was a joke.Oh.Now Im really confused.Patiently, I explain the essence of my email without giving anything away.So you thought hed reply by email.Yes.But instead he turns up here.Yes.Id say hes completely smitten with you.I frown.Christian, smitten with me?Hardly.Hes just looking for a new toy  a convenient new toy that he can bed and do unspeakable things to.My heart tightens painfully.This is the reality.He came here to fuck me, thats all.Who said romance was dead?she whispers horrified.Ive shocked Kate.I didnt think that was possible.I shrug apologetically.He uses sex as a weapon.Fuck you into submission?She shakes her head disapprovingly.I blink rapidly at her, and I can feel the blush as it spreads across my face.Oh spot on, Katherine Kavanagh, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist.Ana, I dont understand, you just let him make love to you?No, Kate, we dont make love  we fuck  Christians terminology.He doesnt do the love thing.I knew there was something weird about him.He has commitment issues.I nod, as if in agreement.Inwardly, I pine.Oh Kate...I wish I could tell you everything, everything about this strange, sad, kinky guy, and you could tell me to forget about him.Stop me from being a fool.I guess its all a little overwhelming, I murmur.Thats the understatement of the year.Because I dont want to talk about Christian any more, I ask her about Elliot.Katherines whole demeanor changes at the mere mention of his name, she lights up from within, beaming at me.Hes coming over early Saturday to help load up.She hugs the hairbrush, boy has she got it bad, and I feel a familiar faint stab of envy.Kate has found herself a normal man, and she looks so happy.I turn and hug her.Oh, I meant to say.Your dad called while you were err, occupied.Apparently Bob has sustained some injury, so your mom and he cant make graduation.But your dad will be here Thursday.He wants you to call.Oh...my mom never called me.Is Bob okay?Yes.Call her in the morning.Its late now.Thanks, Kate.Im okay now.Ill call Ray in the morning too.I think Ill just turn in.She smiles, but her eyes crinkle at the corners with concern.After shes gone, I sit and read the contract again, making more notes as I go.When Ive finished, I fire up the laptop, ready to respond.Theres an email from Christian in my inbox.From: Christian Grey  Subject: This evening  Date: May 23 2011 23:16  To: Anastasia Steele  Miss Steele  I look forward to receiving your notes on the contract.Until then, sleep well baby.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Issues  Date: May 24 2011 00:02  To: Christian Grey      Dear Mr.Grey  Here is my list of issues.I look forward to discussing them more fully at dinner on Wednesday.The numbers refer to clauses:  2: Not sure why this is solely for MY benefit  ie to explore MY sensuality and limits.Im sure I wouldnt need a ten page contract to do that!Surely this is for YOUR benefit.4: As you are aware you are my only sexual partner.I dont take drugs, and Ive not had any blood transfusions.Im probably safe.What about you?8: I can terminate at any time if I dont think youre sticking to the agreed limits.Okay  I like this.9: Obey you in all things?Accept without hesitation your discipline?We need to talk about this.11: One month trial period.Not three.12: I cannot commit every weekend.I do have a life, or will have.Perhaps three out of four?15.2: Using my body as you see fit sexually or otherwise  please define or otherwise.15.5: This whole discipline clause.Im not sure I want to be whipped, flogged, or corporally punished.I am sure this would be in breach of clauses 2 5.And also for any other reason.Thats just mean  and you told me you werent a sadist.15.10: Like loaning me out to someone else would ever be an option.But Im glad its here in black and white.15.14: The Rules.More on those later.15.19: Touching myself without your permission.Whats the problem with this?You know I dont do it anyway.15.21: Discipline  Please see clause 15.5 above.15.22: I cant look into your eyes?Why?15.24: Why cant I touch you?Rules:  Sleep  Ill agree to 6 hours.Food  I am not eating food from a prescribed list.The food list goes or I do  Deal breaker.Clothes  as long as I only have to wear your clothes when Im with you...okay.Exercise  We agreed 3 hours, this still says 4.Soft Limits:  Can we go through all of these?No Fisting of any kind.What is suspension?Genital Clamps  you have got to be kidding me.Can you please let me know the arrangements for Wednesday?I am working until 5pm that day.Good night.Ana  From: Christian Grey  Subject: This evening  Date: May 24 2011 00:07  To: Anastasia Steele  Miss Steele  Thats a long list.Why are you still up?Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Burning the midnight oil  Date: May 24 2011 00:10  To: Christian Grey  Sir  If you recall I was going through this list, when I was distracted and bedded by a passing control freak.Goodnight.Ana  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Stop Burning the midnight oil  Date: May 24 2011 00:12  To: Anastasia Steele  GO TO BED ANASTASIA.Christian Grey  CEO & Control Freak, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.Oh shouty capitals!I switch off.How can he intimidate me when hes six miles away?I shake my head.My heart still heavy, I climb into bed and fall instantly into a deep but troubled sleep.The following day, I call my mom when Im home from work.Its been a relatively peaceful day at the Claytons, allowing me far too much time to think.Im restless, nervous about my showdown with Mr.Control Freak tomorrow, and at the back of my mind, Im worried that perhaps Ive been too negative in my response to the contract.Perhaps hell call the whole thing off.My mom is oozing contrition, desperately sorry not to make my graduation.Bob has twisted some ligament which means hes hobbling all over the place.Honestly, hes as accident prone as I am.Hes expected to make a full recovery, but it means hes resting up, and my mother has to wait on him hand and sore foot.Ana honey, Im so sorry, my mom whines down the phone.Mom, its fine.Ray will be there.Ana, you sound distracted  are you okay, baby?Yes, Mom, Oh if only you knew.Theres an obscenely rich guy Ive met and he wants some kind of strange kinky sexual relationship, in which I dont get a say in things.Have you met someone?No, Mom.I am so not going there right now.Well, darling, Ill be thinking of you on Thursday.I love you you know that honey?I close my eyes, her precious words give me a warm glow inside.Love you too, Mom.Say hi to Bob, and I hope he gets better fast.Will do, honey.Bye.Bye.I have strayed into my bedroom with the phone.Idly, I switch the mean machine on and fire up the email program.Theres an email from Christian from late last night or very early this morning, depending on your point of view.My heart rate spikes instantly, and I hear the blood pumping in my ears.Holy crap perhaps hes said no  thats it  maybe hes canceling dinner.The thought is so painful.I dismiss it quickly and open the email.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Your Issues  Date: May 24 2011 01:27  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele  Following my more thorough examination of your issues, may I bring to your attention

Men  Date: May 24 2011 18:55  To: Christian Grey  Thank you.Ana x  From: Christian Grey  Subject: Exasperating Women  Date: May 24 2011 18:59  To: Anastasia Steele  Youre welcome.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.I call Ray, who is just about to watch the Sounders play some soccer team from Salt Lake City, so our conversation is mercifully brief.Hes driving down on Thursday for graduation.He wants to take me out afterward for a meal.My heart swells talking to Ray, and a huge lump knots in my throat.He has been my constant through all moms romantic ups and downs.We have a special bond that I treasure.Even though hes my stepdad, hes always treated me as his own, and I cant wait to see him.Its been too long.His quiet fortitude is what I need now, what I miss.Maybe I can channel my inner Ray for my meeting tomorrow.Kate and I concentrate on packing, sharing a bottle of cheap red wine as we do.When I finally go to bed, having almost finished packing my room, I feel calmer.The physical activity of boxing everything up has been a welcome distraction, and Im tired.I want a good nights sleep.I snuggle into my bed and am soon asleep.Paul is back from Princeton before he sets off for New York to start an internship with a financing company.He follows me round the store all day asking me for a date.Its annoying.Paul, for the hundredth time, I have a date this evening.No, you dont, youre just saying that to avoid me.Youre always avoiding me.Yes youd think youd take the hint.Paul, I never thought it was a good idea to date the bosss brother.Youre finishing here on Friday.Youre not working tomorrow.And Ill be in Seattle as of Saturday and youll be in New York soon.We couldnt get much further apart if we tried.Besides, I do have a date this evening.With Jos?No.Who then?Paul oh.My sigh is exasperated.Hes not going to let this go.Christian Grey.I cannot help the annoyance in my voice.But it does the trick.Pauls mouth falls open, and he gapes at me, struck dumb.Humph  even his name renders people speechless.You have a date with Christian Grey, he says finally, once hes over the shock.Disbelief is evident in his voice.Yes.I see.Paul looks positively crestfallen, stunned even, and a very small part resents that he should find this a surprise.My inner goddess does too.She makes a very vulgar and unattractive gesture at him with her fingers.After that, he ignores me, and at five I am out of the door, pronto.Kate has lent me two dresses and two pairs of shoes for tonight and for graduation tomorrow.I wish I could feel more enthused about clothes and make an extra effort, but clothes are just not my thing.What is your thing, Anastasia?Christians softly spoken question haunts me.Shaking my head and endeavoring to quell my nerves, I decide on the plum colored sheath dress for this evening.Its demure and vaguely business like  after all, I am negotiating a contract.I shower, shave my legs and underarms, wash my hair, and then spend a good half hour drying it so that it falls in soft waves to my breasts and down my back.I slip a comb in to keep one side off my face and apply mascara and some lip gloss.I rarely wear make up  it intimidates me.None of my literary heroines had to deal with make up  maybe Id know more about it if they had.I slip on the plum colored stilettos that match the dress, and Im ready by six thirty.Well?I ask Kate.She grins.Boy, you scrub up well, Ana.She nods with approval.You look hot.Hot!Im aiming for demure and business like.That too, but most of all, hot.The dress really suits you and your coloring.The way it clings.She smirks.Kate!I scold.Just keeping it real, Ana.The whole package  looks good.Keep the dress.Youll have him eating out of your hand.My mouth presses in a hard line.Oh, you so have that the wrong way round.Wish me luck.You need luck for a date?Her brow furrows, puzzled.Yes, Kate.Well then  good luck.She hugs me, and I am out the front door.I have to drive in my bare feet  Wanda, my sea blue Beetle, wasnt built to be driven by stiletto wearers.I pull up outside the Heathman at six fifty eight precisely and hand my car keys to the valet for parking.He looks askance at my Beetle, but I ignore him.Taking a deep breath and mentally girding my loins, I head into the hotel.Christian is leaning casually against the bar, drinking a glass of white wine.Hes dressed in his customary white linen shirt, black jeans, black tie, and black jacket.His hair is as tousled as ever.I sigh.Of course he looks gorgeous.I stand for a few seconds in the entrance of the bar, gazing at him, admiring the view.He is beyond beautiful.He glances, nervously I think, toward the entrance and stills when he sees me.Blinking a couple of times, he then smiles a slow, lazy, sexy smile that renders me speechless and all molten inside.Making a supreme effort not to bite my lip, I move forward aware that I, Anastasia Steele of Clumsyville, am in high stilettos.He walks gracefully over to meet me.You look stunning, he murmurs as he leans down to briefly kiss my cheek.A dress, Miss Steele.I approve.Taking my arm, he leads me to a secluded booth and signals for the waiter.What would you like to drink?My lips quirk up in a quick, sly smile as I sit and slide into the booth  well, at least hes asking me.Ill have what youre having, please.See!I can play nice and behave myself.Amused, he orders another glass of Sancerre and slides in opposite me.They have an excellent wine cellar here, he says, cocking his head to one side.Putting his elbows on the table, he steeples his fingers in front of his beautiful mouth, his gray eyes alive with some unreadable emotion.And there it is that familiar pull and charge from him, it connects somewhere deep inside me.I shift uncomfortably under his scrutiny, my heart palpitating.I must keep my cool.Are you nervous?he asks softly.Yes.He leans forward.Me too, he whispers conspiratorially.My eyes shoot up to meet his.Him.Nervous.Never.I blink at him, and he smiles his adorable lopsided smile at me.The waiter arrives with my wine, a small dish of mixed nuts, and another of olives.So, how are we going to do this?I ask.Run through my points one by one?Impatient as ever, Miss Steele.Well, I could ask you what you thought of the weather today?He smiles, and his long fingers reach down to collect an olive.He pops it in his mouth, and my eyes linger on his mouth, that mouth, thats been on me all parts of me.I flush.I thought the weather was particularly unexceptional today, he smirks.Are you smirking at me, Mr.Grey?I am, Miss Steele.You know this contract is legally unenforceable.I am fully aware of that, Miss Steele.Were you going to tell me that at any point?He frowns at me.Youd think Id coerce you into something you dont want to do, and then pretend that I have a legal hold over you?Well yes.You dont think very highly of me at all, do you?You havent answered my question.Anastasia, it doesnt matter if its legal or not.It represents an arrangement that I would like to make with you  what I would like from you and what you can expect from me.If you dont like it, then dont sign.If you do sign, and then decide you dont like it, there are enough get out clauses so you can walk away.Even if it were legally binding, do you think Id drag you through the courts if you did decide to run?I take a long draft of my wine.My subconscious taps me hard on the shoulder.You must keep your wits about you.Dont drink too much.Relationships like this are built on honesty and trust, he continues.If you dont trust me  trust me to know how Im affecting you, how far I can go with you, how far I can take you  if you cant be honest with me, then we really cant do this.Oh my, weve cut to the chase quickly.How far he can take me.Holy shit.What does that mean?So its quite simple, Anastasia.Do you trust me or not?His eyes are burning, fervent.Did you have similar discussions with um the fifteen?No.Why not?Because they were all established submissives.They knew what they wanted out of a relationship with me and generally what I expected.With them, it was just a question of fine tuning the soft limits, details like that.Is there a store you go to?Submissives R Us?He laughs.Not exactly.Then how?Is that what you want to discuss?Or shall we get down to the nitty gritty?Your issues, as you say.I swallow.Do I trust him?Is that what this all comes down to  trust?Surely that should be a two way thing.I remember his snit when I phoned Jos.Are you hungry?he asks, distracting me from my thoughts.Oh no food.No.Have you eaten today?I stare at him.Honesty Holy crap, hes not going to like my answer.No.My voice is small.He narrows his eyes.You have to eat, Anastasia.We can eat down here or in my suite.What would you prefer?I think we should stay in public, on neutral ground.He smiles sardonically.Do you think that would stop me?he says softly, a sensual warning.My eyes widen, and I swallow again.I hope so.Come, I have a private dining room booked.No public.He smiles at me enigmati cally and climbs out of the booth, holding his hand out to me.Bring your wine, he murmurs.Placing my hand in his, I slide out and stand up beside him.He releases me, and his hand reaches for my elbow.He leads me back through the bar and up the grand stairs to a mezzanine floor.A young man in full Heathman livery approaches us.Mr.Grey, this way sir.We follow him through a plush seating area to an intimate dining room.Just one secluded table.The room is small but sumptuous.Beneath a shimmering chandelier, the table is all starched linen, crystal glasses, silver cutlery, and white rose bouquet.An old world, sophisticated charm pervades the wood paneled room.The waiter pulls out my chair, and I sit.He places my napkin in my lap.Christian sits opposite me.I peek up at him.Dont bite your lip, he whispers.I frown.Damn it.I dont even know that Im doing it.Ive ordered already.I hope you dont mind.Frankly, Im relieved, Im not sure I can make any further decisions.No, thats fine, I acquiesce.Its good to know that you can be amenable.Now, where were we?The nitty gritty.I take another large sip of wine.It really is delicious.Christian Grey does wine well.I remember the last sip of wine he gave me, in my bed.I blush at the intrusive thought.Yes, your issues.He fishes into his inside jacket pocket and pulls out a piece of paper.My email.Clause 2.Agreed.This is for the benefit of us both.I shall redraft.I blink at him.Holy shit we are going to go through each of these points one at a time.I just dont feel so brave face to face.He looks so earnest.I steel myself with another sip of my wine.Christian continues.My sexual health.Well, all of my previous partners have had blood tests, and I have regular tests every six months for all the health risks you mention.All my recent tests are clear.I have never taken drugs.In fact, Im vehemently anti drugs.I have a strict no tolerance policy with regards to drugs for all my employees, and I insist on random drug testing.Wow control freakery gone mad.I blink at him shocked.I have never had any blood transfusions.Does that answer your question?I nod, impassive.Your next point I mentioned earlier.You can walk away any time, Anastasia.I wont stop you.If you go, however  thats it.Just so you know.Okay, I answer softly.If I go, thats it.The thought is surprisingly painful.The waiter arrives with our first course.How can I possibly eat?Holy Moses  hes ordered oysters on a bed of ice.I hope you like oysters, Christians voice is soft.Ive never had one.Ever.Really?Well.He reaches for one.All you do is tip and swallow.I think you can manage that.He gazes at me, and I know what hes referring to.I blush scarlet.He grins at me, squirts some lemon juice onto his oyster, and then tips it into his mouth.Hmm, delicious.Tastes of the sea, he grins at me.Go on, he encourages.So, I dont chew it?No, Anastasia, you dont.His eyes are alight with humor.He looks so young like this.I bite my lip, and his expression changes instantly.He looks sternly at me.I reach across and pick up my first ever oyster.Okay here goes nothing.I squirt some lemon juice on it and tip it up.It slips down my throat, all seawater, salt, the sharp tang of citrus, and fleshiness ooh.I lick my lips, and hes watching me intently, his eyes hooded.Well?Ill have another, I say dryly.Good girl, he says proudly.Did you choose these deliberately?Arent they known for their aphrodisiac qualities?No, they are the first item on the menu.I dont need an aphrodisiac near you.I think you know that, and I think you react the same way near me, he says simply.So where were we?He glances at my email as I reach for another oyster.He reacts the same way.I affect him wow.Obey me in all things.Yes, I want you to do that.I need you to do that.Think of it as role play Anastasia.But Im worried youll hurt me.Hurt you how?Physically.And emotionally.Do you really think I would do that?Go beyond any limit you cant take?Youve said youve hurt someone before.Yes, I have.It was a long time ago.How did you hurt them?I suspended them from my playroom ceiling.In fact, thats one of your questions.Suspension  thats what the karabiners are for in the playroom.Rope play.One of the ropes was tied too tightly.I hold my hand up begging him to stop.I dont need to know any more.So you wont suspend me then?Not if you really dont want to.You can make that a hard limit.Okay.So obeying, do you think you can manage that?He stares at me, his gray eyes intense.The seconds tick by.I could try, I whisper.Good.He smiles.Now term.One month instead of three is no time at all, especially if you want a weekend away from me each month.I dont think Ill be able to stay away from you for that length of time.I can barely manage it now, he pauses.He cant stay away from me?What?How about, one day over one weekend per month you get to yourself  but I get a midweek night that week?Okay.And please, lets try it for three months.If its not for you then, you can walk away anytime.Three months?Im feeling railroaded.I take another large sip of wine and treat myself to another oyster.I could learn to like these.The ownership thing, thats just terminology and goes back to the principle of obeying.Its to get you into the right frame of mind, to understand where Im coming from.And I want you to know that as soon as you cross my threshold as my submissive, I will do what I like to you.You have to accept that and willingly.Thats why you have to trust me.I will fuck you, any time, any way, I want  anywhere I want.I will discipline you, because you will screw up.I will train you to please me.But I know youve not done this before.Initially, well take it slowly, and I will help you.Well build up to various scenarios.I want you to trust me, but I know I have to earn your trust, and I will.The or otherwise   again its to help you get into the mindset, it means anything goes.Hes so passionate, mesmerizing.This is obviously his obsession, the way he is I cant take my eyes off him.He really, really wants this.He stops talking and gazes at me.Still with me?he whispers, his voice rich, warm and seductive.He takes a sip of his wine, his penetrating stare holding mine.The waiter comes to the door, and Christian subtly nods permitting the waiter to clear our table.Would you like some more wine?I have to drive.Some water then?I nod.Still or sparkling?Sparkling, please.The waiter leaves.Youre very quiet, Christian whispers.Youre very verbose.He smiles.Discipline.Theres a very fine line between pleasure and pain Anastasia.They are two sides of the same coin, one not existing without the other.I can show you how pleasurable pain can be.You dont believe me now, but this is what I mean about trust.There will be pain, but nothing that you cant handle.Again, it comes down to trust.Do you trust me, Ana?Ana!Yes, I do.I respond spontaneously, not thinking because its true  I do trust him.Well then, he looks relieved.The rest of this stuff is just details.Important details.Okay, lets talk through those.My head is swimming with all his words.I should have brought Kates mini disc player so I can listen back to this.There is so much information, so much to process.The waiter re emerges with our entrees: black cod, asparagus, and crushed potatoes with a hol landaise sauce.I have never felt less like food.I hope you like fish, Christian says mildly.I make a stab at my food and take a long drink of my sparkling water.I vehemently wish it was wine.The rules.Lets talk about them.The food is a deal breaker?Yes.Can I modify to say that you will eat at least three meals a day?No.I am so not backing down on this.No one is going to dictate to me what I eat.How I fuck, yes, but eat no, no way.He purses his lips.I need to know that youre not hungry.I frown.Why?Youll have to trust me.He gazes at me for a moment, and he relaxes.Touch, Miss Steele, he says quietly.I concede the food and the sleep.Why cant I look at you?Thats a Dom/sub thing.Youll get used to it.Will I?Why cant I touch you?Because you cant.His mouth sets in a mulish line.Is it because of Mrs.Robinson?He looks quizzically at me.Why would you think that?And immediately he understands.You think she trau matized me?I nod.No Anastasia.Shes not the reason.Besides, Mrs.Robinson wouldnt take any of that shit from me.Oh but I have to.I pout.So nothing to do with her.No.And I dont want you touching yourself, either.What?Ah yes, the no masturbation clause.Out of curiosity why?Because I want all your pleasure, his voice is husky, but determined.Oh I have no answer for that.On one level its up there with, I want to bite that lip, on another, its so selfish.I frown and take a bite of cod, trying to assess mentally what concessions Ive gained.The food, the sleep, I can look him in the eye.Hes going to take it slow, and we havent discussed soft limits.But Im not sure I can face that over food.Ive given you a great deal to think about havent I?Yes.Do you want to go through the soft limits now too?Not over dinner.He smiles.Squeamish?Something like that.Youve not eaten very much.Ive had enough.Three oysters, four bites of cod, and one asparagus stalk, no potatoes, no nuts, no olives, and youve not eaten all day.You said I could trust you.Jeez.Hes kept an inventory.Christian, please, its not every day I sit through conversations like this.I need you fit and healthy Anastasia.I know.And right now, I want to peel you out of that dress.I swallow.Peel me out of Kates dress.I feel the pull deep in my belly.Muscles that Im now more acquainted with clench at his words.But I cant have this.His most potent weapon, used against me again.Hes so good at sex  even Ive figured this out.I dont think thats a good idea, I murmur quietly.We havent had dessert.You want dessert?he snorts.Yes.You could be dessert, he murmurs suggestively.Im not sure Im sweet enough.Anastasia, youre deliciously sweet.I know.Christian.You use sex as a weapon.It really isnt fair, I whisper, staring down at my hands, and then looking directly at him.He raises his eyebrows, surprised, and I see hes considering my words.He strokes his chin thoughtfully.Youre right.I do.In life you use what you know, Anastasia.Doesnt change how much I want you.Here.Now.How can he seduce me solely with his voice?Im panting already  my heated blood rushing through my veins, my nerves tingling.Id like to try something, he breathes.I frown.Hes just given me a shit load of ideas to process and now this.If you were my sub, you wouldnt have to think about this.It would be easy.His voice is soft, seductive.All those decisions  all the wearying thought processes behind them.The  is this the right thing to do?Should this happen here?Can it happen now?You wouldnt have to worry about any of that detail.Thats what Id do as your Dom.And right now, I know you want me, Anastasia.My frown deepens.How can he tell?I can tell because   Holy shit hes answering my unspoken question.Is he psychic as well?Your body gives you away.Youre pressing your thighs together, youre flushed, and your breathing has changed.O, this is too much.How do you know about my thighs?My voice is low, disbelieving.Theyre under the table for heavens sake.I felt the tablecloth move, and its a calculated guess based on years of experience.Im right arent I?I flush and stare down at my hands.Thats what Im hindered by in this game of seduction.Hes the only one who knows and understands the rules.Im just too nave and inexperienced.My only sphere of reference is Kate, and she doesnt take any shit from men.My other references are all fictional: Elizabeth Bennett would be outraged, Jane Eyre too frightened, and Tess would succumb, just as I have.I havent finished my cod.Youd prefer cold cod to me?My head jerks up to glare at him, and his gray eyes burn molten silver, with compelling need.I thought you liked me clearing my plate.Right now, Miss Steele, I couldnt give a fuck about your food.Christian.You just dont fight fair.I know.I never have.My inner goddess frowns at me.You can do this, she coaxes  play this sex god at his own game.Can I?Okay.What to do?My inexperience is an albatross around my neck.Picking up a spear of asparagus, I gaze at him and bite my lip.Then very slowly put the tip of my cold asparagus in my mouth and suck it.Christians eyes widen infinitesimally, but I notice.Anastasia.What are you doing?I bite off the tip.Eating my asparagus.Christian shifts in his seat.I think youre toying with me, Miss Steele.I feign innocence.Im just finishing my food, Mr.Grey.The waiter chooses this moment to knock and, unbidden, enter.He glances briefly at Christian, who frowns at him but then nods, so the waiter clears our plates.The waiters arrival has broken the spell.And I grasp this precious moment of clarity.I have to go.Our meeting will only end one way if I stay, and I need some boundaries after such an intense conversation.As much as my body craves his touch, my mind is rebelling.I need some distance to think about all hes said.I still havent made a decision, and his sexual allure and prowess doesnt make it any easier.Would you like some dessert?Christian asks, ever the gentleman, but his eyes still blaze.No, thank you.I think I should go.I stare down at my hands.Go?He cant hide his surprise.The waiter leaves hastily.Yes.Its the right decision.If I stay here, in this room with him, he will fuck me.I stand, purposefully.We both have the graduation ceremony tomorrow.Christian stands automatically, revealing years of ingrained civility.I dont want you to go.Please I have to.Why?Because youve given me so much to consider and I need some distance.I could make you stay, he threatens.Yes, you could easily, but I dont want you to.He runs his hand through his hair, regarding me carefully.You know, when you fell into my office to interview me, you were all yes sir, no sir.I thought you were a natural born submissive.But quite frankly, Anastasia, Im not sure you have a submissive bone in your delectable body.He moves slowly toward me as his speaks, his voice tense.You may be right, I breathe.I want the chance to explore the possibility that you do, he murmurs, staring down at me.He reaches up and caresses my face, his thumb tracing my lower lip.I dont know any other way, Anastasia.This is who I am.I know.He leans down to kiss me, but pauses before his lips touch mine, his eyes searching mine, wanting, asking permission.I raise my lips to his, and he kisses me and because I dont know if Ill ever kiss him again, I let go  my hands moving of their own accord and twisting into his hair, pulling him to me, my mouth opening, my tongue stroking his.His hand grasps the nape of my neck as he deepens the kiss, responding to my ardor.His other hand slides down my back and flattens at the base of my spine as he pushes me against his body.I cant persuade you to stay?he breathes between kisses.No.Spend the night with me.And not touch you?No.He groans.You impossible girl.He pulls back, gazing down at me.Why do I think youre telling me goodbye?Because Im leaving now.Thats not what I mean, and you know it.Christian, I have to think about this.I dont know if I can have the kind of relationship you want.He closes his eyes and presses his forehead against mine, giving us both the opportunity to slow our breathing.After a moment, he kisses my forehead, inhales deeply, his nose in my hair, and then he releases me, stepping back.As you wish, Miss Steele, he says, his face impassive.Ill escort you to the lobby.He holds out his hand.Leaning down, I grab my purse and place my hand in his.Holy crap, this could be it.I follow him meekly down the grand stairs and into the lobby, my scalp prickling, my blood pumping.This could be the last goodbye if I decide to say no.My heart contracts painfully in my chest.What a turnaround.What a difference a moment of clarity can make to a girl.Do you have your valet ticket?I fish into my clutch purse and hand him the ticket, which he gives to the doorman.I peek up at him as we stand waiting.Thank you for dinner, I murmur.Its a pleasure as always, Miss Steele, he says politely, though he looks deep in thought, completely distracted.As I peer up at him, I commit his beautiful profile to memory.The idea that I might not see him again haunts me, unwelcome and too painful to contemplate.He turns suddenly, staring down at me, his expression intense.Youre moving this weekend to Seattle.If you make the right decision, can I see you on Sunday?He sounds hesitant.Well see.Maybe, I breathe.Momentarily, he looks relieved, and then he frowns.Its cooler now, dont you have a jacket?No.He shakes his head in irritation and takes off his jacket.Here.I dont want you catching cold.I blink up at him as he holds it open, and as I hold my arms out behind me, Im reminded of the time in his office when he slipped my coat onto my shoulders  the first time I met him  and the effect he had on me then.Nothings changed, in fact, its more intense.His jacket is warm, far too big, and it smells of him.Oh my delicious.My car pulls up outside.Christians mouth drops open.Thats what you drive?Hes appalled.Taking my hand, he leads me outside.The valet jumps out and hands me my keys, and Christian coolly palms him some money.Is this roadworthy?Hes glaring at me now.Yes.Will it make it to Seattle?Yes.She will.Safely?Yes, I snap, exasperated.Okay shes old.But shes mine, and shes roadworthy.My stepdad bought it for me.Oh, Anastasia, I think we can do better than this.What do you mean?Realization dawns.You are not buying me a car.He glowers at me, his jaw tense.Well see, he says tightly.He grimaces as he opens the drivers door and helps me in.I take my shoes off and roll down the window.Hes gazing at me, his expression unfathomable, eyes dark.Drive safely, he says quietly.Goodbye, Christian.My voice is hoarse from unbidden, unshed tears  jeez Im not going to cry.I give him a small smile.As I drive away, my chest constricts, my tears start to fall, and I choke back a sob.Soon tears are streaming down my face, and I really dont understand why Im crying.I was holding my own.He explained everything.He was clear.He wants me, but the truth is, I need more.I need him to want me like I want and need him, and deep down I know thats not possible.I am just overwhelmed.I dont even know how to categorize him.If I do this thing will he be my boyfriend?Will I be able to introduce him to my friends?Go out to bars, the cinema, bowling even, with him?The truth is, I dont think I will.He wont let me touch him and he wont let me sleep with him.I know Ive not had these things in my past, but I want them in my future.And thats not the future he envisages.What if I do say yes, and in three months time he says no, hes had enough of trying to mold me into something Im not.How will I feel?Ill have emotionally invested three months, doing things that Im not sure I want to do.And if he then says no, agreement over, how could I cope with that level of rejection?Perhaps its best to back away now with what self esteem I have reasonably intact.But the thought of not seeing him again is agonizing.How has he gotten under my skin so quickly?It cant just be the sex can it?I dash the tears from my eyes.I dont want to examine my feelings for him.Im frightened what Ill uncover if I do.What am I going to do?I park up outside our duplex.No lights on.Kate must be out.Im relieved.I dont want her to catch me crying again.As I undress, I wake up the mean machine and sitting in my inbox is a message from Christian.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Tonight  Date: May 25 2011 22:01  To: Anastasia Steele  I dont understand why you ran this evening.I sincerely hope I answered all your questions to your satisfaction.I know I have given you a great deal to contemplate, and I fervently hope that you will give my proposal your serious consideration.I really want to make this work.We will take it slow.Trust me.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.His email makes me weep more.I am not a merger.I am not an acquisition.Reading this, I might as well be.I dont reply.I just dont know what to say to him.I fumble into my PJs, and wrapping his jacket around me.I climb into bed.As I lie staring into the darkness, I think of all the times he warned me to stay away.Anastasia, you should steer clear of me.Im not the man for you.I dont do the girlfriend thing.Im not a hearts and flowers kind of guy.I dont make love.This is all I know.And as I weep into my pillow silently, its this last idea I cling to.This is all I know, too.Perhaps together we can chart a new course.Christian is standing over me grasping a plaited, leather riding crop.Hes wearing old, faded, ripped Levis and thats all.He flicks the crop slowly into his palm as he gazes down at me.Hes smiling, triumphant.I cannot move.I am naked and shackled, spread eagled on a large four poster bed.Reaching forward, he trails the tip of the crop from my forehead down the length of my nose, so I can smell the leather, and over my parted, panting lips.He pushes the tip into my mouth so I can taste the smooth, rich leather.Suck, he commands his voice soft.My mouth closes over the tip as I obey.Enough, he snaps.Im panting once more as he tugs the crop out of my mouth, trails it down and under my chin, on down my neck to the hollow at the base of my throat.He swirls it slowly there and then continues to drag the tip down my body, along my sternum, between my breasts, over my torso down to my navel.Im panting, squirming, pulling against my restraints that are biting into my wrists and my ankles.He swirls the tip around my navel then continues to trail the leather tip south, through my pubic hair to my clitoris.He flicks the crop and it hits my sweet spot with a sharp slap, and I come, gloriously, shouting my release.Abruptly, I wake, gasping for breath, covered in sweat and feeling the aftershocks of my orgasm.Holy hell.Im completely disorientated.What the hell just happened?Im in my bedroom alone.How?Why?I sit bolt upright, shocked wow.Its morning.I glance at my alarm clock  eight oclock.I put my head in my hands.I didnt know I could dream sex.Was it something I ate?Perhaps the oysters and my Internet research manifesting itself in my first wet dream.Its bewildering.I had no idea that I could orgasm in my sleep.Kate is skipping around the kitchen when I stagger in.Ana, are you okay?You look odd.Is that Christians jacket youre wearing?Im fine.Damn, should have checked in the mirror.I avoid her piercing green eyes.Im still reeling from my mornings event.Yes, this is Christians jacket.She frowns.Did you sleep?Not very well.I head for the kettle.I need tea.How was dinner?So it begins.We had oysters.Followed by cod, so Id say it was fishy.Ugh I hate oysters, and I dont want to know about the food.How was Christian?What did you talk about?He was attentive, I pause.What can I say?His HIV status is clear, hes heavily into role play, wants me to obey his every command, he hurt someone he tied to his bedroom ceiling, and he wanted to fuck me in the private dining room.Would that be a good summary?I try desperately to remember something from my encounter with Christian that I can discuss with Kate.He doesnt approve of Wanda.Who does, Ana?Thats old news.Why are you being so coy?Give it up, girlfriend.Oh, Kate, we talked about lots things.You know  how fussy he is about food.Incidentally, he liked your dress.The kettle has boiled, so I make myself some tea.Do you want tea?Would you like me to hear your speech for today?Yes, please.I worked on it last night over at Lilahs.Ill go fetch it.And yes, Id love some tea.Kate races out of the kitchen.Phew, Katherine Kavanagh sidetracked.I slice a bagel and pop it into the toaster.I flush remembering my very vivid dream.What on earth was that about?Last night I found it hard to sleep.My head was buzzing with various options.I am so confused.Christians idea of a relationship is more like a job offer.It has set hours, a job description, and a rather harsh grievance procedure.Its not how I envisaged my first romance  but, of course, Christian doesnt do romance.If I tell him I want more, he may say no and I could jeopardize what he has offered.And this is what concerns me most, because I dont want to lose him.But Im not sure I have the stomach to be his submissive   deep down, its the canes and whips that put me off.Im a physical coward, and I will go a long way to avoid pain.I think of my dream is that what it would be like?My inner goddess jumps up and down with cheerleading pom poms shouting yes at me.Kate comes back into the kitchen with her laptop.I concentrate on my bagel and listen patiently as she runs through her Valedictorian speech.I am dressed and ready when Ray arrives.I open the front door, and hes standing on the porch in his ill fitting suit.A warm surge of gratitude and love for this uncomplicated man streaks through me, and I throw my arms around him in an uncharacteristic display of affection.Hes taken aback, bemused.Hey, Annie, Im pleased to see you too, he mutters as he hugs me.Setting me back, his hands on my shoulders, he looks me up and down, his brow furrowed.You okay, kid?Of course, Dad, cant a girl be pleased to see her old man?He smiles, his dark eyes crinkling at the corners, and follows me into the living area.You look good, he says.This is Kates dress.I glance down at the grey chiffon halter neck dress.He frowns.Where is Kate?Shes gone to campus.Shes giving a speech, so she has to be early.Should we head on over?Dad, we have half an hour.Would you like some tea?And you can tell me how everyone in Montesano is getting along.How was the drive down?Ray pulls his car into the campus parking lot, and we follow the stream of humanity dotted with ubiquitous black and red gowns, heading toward the sports auditorium.Good luck, Annie.You seem awfully nervous, do you have to do anything?Holy crap why has Ray picked today to be so observant?No, Dad.Its a big day.And Im going to see him.Yeah, my baby girl has gotten a degree.Im proud of you, Annie.Aw thanks Ray.Oh I love this man.The sports auditorium is crowded.Ray has gone to sit with the other parents and well wishers in the raked seating, while I make my way to my seat.Im wearing my black gown and my cap, and I feel protected by them, anonymous.There is no one on the stage yet, but I cant seem to steady my nerves.My heart is pounding, and my breathing is shallow.Hes here, somewhere.I wonder if Kate is talking to him, interrogating him maybe.I make my way to my seat amongst fellow students whose surnames also begin with S.  I am in the second row, affording me yet more anonymity.I glance behind me and spot Ray sat up high in the bleachers.I give him a wave.He self consciously gives me a half wave, half salute back.I sit and wait.The auditorium fills quickly, and the buzz of excited voices gets louder and louder.The row of seats in front fills.On either side of me, I am joined by two girls whom I dont know from a different faculty.Theyre obviously close friends and talk across me excitedly.At eleven precisely, the Chancellor appears from behind the stage, followed by the three Vice Chancellors, and then the senior professors, all decked out in their black and red regalia.We stand and applaud our teaching staff.Some Professors nod and wave, others look bored.Professor Collins, my tutor and my favorite teacher, looks like hes just fallen out of bed, as usual.Last on to the stage are Kate and Christian.Christian stands out in his bespoke gray suit, copper highlights glinting in his hair under the auditorium lights.He looks so serious and self contained.As he sits, he undoes his single breasted jacket, and I glimpse his tie.Holy shit that tie!I rub my wrists reflexively.I cannot take my eyes off him  his beauty as distracting as ever  and hes wearing that tie, on purpose no doubt.I can feel my mouth press into a hard line.The audience sits down and the applause ceases.Look at him!One of the girls beside me breathes enthusiastically to her friend.Hes hot.I stiffen.Im sure theyre not talking about Professor Collins.Must be Christian Grey.Is he single?I bristle.I dont think so, I murmur.Oh.Both girls look at me in surprise.I think hes gay, I mutter.What a shame, one of the girls groans.As the Chancellor gets to his feet and kicks off the proceedings with his speech, I watch Christian subtly scanning the hall.I sink into my seat, hunching my shoulders, trying to make myself as inconspicuous as possible.I fail miserably as a second later his gray eyes find mine.He stares at me, his face impassive, completely inscrutable.I squirm uncomfortably, hypnotized by his glare as I feel a slow flush spread across my face.Unbidden, I recall my dream from this morning, and the muscles in my belly do the delectable clench thing.I inhale sharply.I can see the shadow of a smile cross his lips, but its fleeting.He briefly closes his eyes, and on opening them, resumes his indifferent expression.Following a swift glance up at the Chancellor, he stares ahead, focusing on the WSUV em blem hung above the entrance.He doesnt turn his eyes toward me again.The Chancellor drones on, and Christian still doesnt look at me, he just stares fixedly ahead.Why wont he look at me?Perhaps hes changed his mind?A wave of unease washes over me.Perhaps walking out on him last night was the end for him too.Hes bored of waiting for me to make up my mind.Oh no, I could have completely blown it.I remember his email last night.Maybe hes mad that I havent replied.Suddenly, the room erupts into applause as Miss Katherine Kavanagh has taken the stage.The Chancellor sits, and Kate tosses her lovely long hair behind her as she places her papers on the lectern.She takes her time, not intimidated by a thousand people gawp ing at her.She smiles when shes ready, looks up at the captivated throng, and launches eloquently into her speech.Shes so composed and funny, the girls beside me erupt on cue at her first joke .Oh, Katherine Kavanagh, you can deliver a good line.I feel so proud of her at that moment, my errant thoughts of Christian are pushed to one side.Even though I have heard her speech before, I listen carefully.She commands the room and takes her audience with her.Her theme is What Next After College?Oh, what next indeed.Christian is watching Kate, his eyebrows slightly raised  in surprise, I think.Yes, it could have been Kate that went to interview him.And it could have been Kate that he was now making indecent proposals to.Beautiful Kate and beautiful Christian, together.I could be like the two girls beside me, admiring him from afar.I know Kate wouldnt have given him the time of day.What did she call him the other day?Creepy.The thought of a confrontation between Kate and Christian makes me uncomfortable.I have to say I dont know which of them I would put my money on.Kate concludes her speech with a flourish, and spontaneously everyone stands, applauding and cheering, her first standing ovation.I beam at her and cheer, and she grins back at me.Good job, Kate.She sits, as does the audience, and the Chancellor rises and introduces Christian holy shit, Christians going to give a speech.The Chancellor touches briefly on Christians achievements: CEO of his own extraordinarily successful company, a real self made man.And also a major benefactor to our University, please welcome, Mr.Christian Grey.The Chancellor pumps Christians hand, and there is a swell of polite applause.My hearts in my throat.He approaches the lectern and surveys the hall.He looks so confident standing in front of us all, as Kate did before him.The two girls beside me lean in, enraptured.In fact, I think most of the female members of the audience inch closer and a few of the men.He begins, his voice soft, measured, and mesmerizing.Im profoundly grateful and touched by the great compliment accorded to me by the authorities of WSU today.It offers me a rare opportunity to talk about the impressive work of the environmental science department here at the University.Our aim is to develop via ble and ecologically sustainable methods of farming for third world countries; our ultimate goal is to help eradicate hunger and poverty across the globe.Over a billion people, mainly in Sub Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, live in abject poverty.Agricultural dysfunction is rife within these parts of the world and the result is ecological and social destruction.I have known what its like to be profoundly hungry.This is a very personal journey for me   My jaw falls to the floor.What?Christian was hungry once.Holy crap.Well, that explains a great deal.And I recall the interview; he really does want to feed the world.I desperately rack my brains to remember what Kate had written in her article.Adopted at age four, I think.I cant imagine that Grace starved him, so it must have been before then, as a little boy.I swallow, my heart constricting at the thought of a hungry, gray eyed toddler.Oh no.What kind of life did he have before the Greys got hold of him and rescued him?Im seized by a sense of raw outrage, poor, fucked up, kinky, philanthropic Christian   though Im sure he wouldnt see himself this way and would repel any thoughts of sympathy or pity.Abruptly, everyone bursts into applause and stands.I follow, though I havent heard half his speech.Hes doing all of these good works, running a huge company, and chasing me at the same time.Its overwhelming.I remember the brief snippets of conversations hes had about Darfur it all falls into place.Food.He smiles briefly at the warm applause  even Kate is clapping, then he resumes his seat.He doesnt look my way, and Im off kilter trying to assimilate this new information about him.One of the Vice Chancellors rises, and we begin the long, tedious process of collecting our degrees.There are over four hundred to be given out, and it takes just over an hour before I hear my name.I make my way up to the stage between the two giggling girls.Christian gazes down at me, his gaze warm but guarded.Congratulations, Miss Steele, he says as he shakes my hand, squeezing it gently.I feel the charge of his flesh on mine.Do you have a problem with your laptop?I frown as he hands me my degree.No.Then you are ignoring my emails?I only saw the mergers and acquisitions one.He looks quizzically at me.Later, he says, and I have to move on because Im holding up the line.I go back to my seat.Emails?He must have sent another.What did it say?The ceremony takes another hour to conclude.Its interminable.Finally, the Chancellor leads the faculty members off the stage to yet more rousing applause, preceded by Christian and Kate.Christian does not glance at me, even though Im willing him to do it.My inner goddess is not pleased.As I stand and wait for our row to disperse, Kate calls to me.Shes heading my way from behind the stage.Christian wants to talk to you, she shouts.The two girls who are now standing beside me turn and gape at me.Hes sent me out here, she continues.Oh  Your speech was great, Kate.It was, wasnt it?she beams.Are you coming?He can be very insistent.She rolls her eyes, and I grin.You have no idea.I cant leave Ray for long.I glance up at Ray and hold my fingers up indicating five minutes.He nods, giving me an okay sign, and I follow Kate into the corridor behind the stage.Christian is talking to the Chancellor and two of the teaching staff.He looks up when he sees me.Excuse me, gentlemen, I hear him murmur.He comes toward me and smiles briefly at Kate.Thank you, he says, and before she can reply, he takes my elbow and steers me into what looks like a mens locker room.He checks to see if its empty, and then he locks the door.Holy shit, what does he have in mind?I blink up at him as he turns on me.Why havent you emailed me?Or texted me back?He glares.Im nonplussed.I havent looked at my computer today, or my phone.Crap, has he been trying to call?I try my distraction technique thats so effective on Kate.That was a great speech.Thank you.Explains your food issues to me.He runs a hand through his hair, exasperated.Anastasia, I dont want to go there at the moment.He closes his eyes, looking pained.Ive been worried about you.Worried, why?Because you went home in that deathtrap you call a car.What?Its not a deathtrap.Its fine.Jos regularly services it for me.Jos, the photographer?Christians eyes narrow, his face frosting.Oh Crap.Yes, the Beetle used to belong to his mother.Yes, and probably her mother and her mother before her.Its not safe.Ive been driving it for over three years.Im sorry you were worried.Why didnt you call?Jeez, hes completely over reacting.He takes a deep breath.Anastasia, I need an answer from you.This waiting around is driving me crazy.Christian, I look, Ive left my stepdad on his own.Tomorrow.I want an answer by tomorrow.Okay.Tomorrow, Ill tell you then.I blink at him.He steps back, regarding me coolly, and his shoulders relax.Are you staying for drinks?he asks.I dont know what Ray wants to do.Your stepfather?Id like to meet him.Oh no why?Im not sure thats a good idea.Christian unlocks the door, his mouth in a grim line.Are you ashamed of me?No!Its my turn to sound exasperated.Introduce you to my dad as what?This is the man who deflowered me and wants us to start a BDSM relationship.Youre not wearing running shoes.Christian glares down at me, and then his lips twitch up in a smile.And in spite of the fact Im mad at him, my face is unwillingly pulled into an answering grin.Just so you know, I can run quite fast.Just tell him Im your friend, Anastasia.He opens the door, and I head out.My mind is whirling.The Chancellor, the three Vice Chancellors, four professors, and Kate stare at me as I walk hastily past them.Holy crap.Leaving Christian with the faculty I go in search of Ray.Tell him Im your friend.Friend with benefits, my subconscious scowls.I know, I know.I shake the unpleasant thought away.How will I introduce him to Ray?The hall is still at least half full, and Ray has not moved from his spot.He sees me, waves, and makes his way down.Hey, Annie.Congratulations.He puts his arm around me.Would you like to come and have a drink in the marquee?Sure.Its your day.Lead the way.We dont have to if you dont want to.Please say no  Annie, Ive just sat for two and half hours listening to all kinds of jabbering.I need a drink.I put my arm through his, and we stroll out with the throng into the warmth of the early afternoon.We pass the line for the official photographer.Oh, that reminds me.Ray drags a digital camera out of his pocket.One for the album, Annie.I roll my eyes at him as he snaps a picture of me.Can I take the cap and gown off now?I feel kind of dorky.You look kinda dorky my subconscious is at her snarky best.So are you going to introduce Ray to the man youre fucking?She is glaring at me over her wing shaped spec tacles.Hed be so proud.God, I hate her sometimes.The marquee is immense, and crowded  students, parents, teachers, and friends, all chattering happily.Ray hands me a glass of champagne or cheap fizzy wine, I suspect.Its not chilled, and it tastes sweet.My thoughts turn to Christian he wont like this.Ana!I turn, and Ethan Kavanagh scoops me into his arms.He twirls me around, without spilling my wine, some feat.Congratulations!He beams down at me, green eyes twinkling.What a surprise.His dirty blonde hair tousled and sexy looking.Hes as beautiful as Kate.The family resemblance is striking.Wow  Ethan!How lovely to see you.Dad, this is Ethan, Kates brother.Ethan, this is my dad, Ray Steele.They shake hands, my dad coolly assessing Mr.Kavanagh.When did you get back from Europe?I ask.Ive been back for a week, but I wanted to surprise my little sister, he says conspiratorially.Thats so sweet.I grin up at him.She is Valedictorian, couldnt miss that.He looks immensely proud of his sister.She gave a great speech.That she did, Ray agrees.Ethan has his arm around my waist when I look up into the frosty gray eyes of Christian Grey.Kate is beside him.Hello, Ray, Kate kisses Ray on both cheeks, making him blush.Have you met Anas boyfriend?Christian Grey.Holy shit Kate!Fuck!All the blood drains from my face.Mr.Steele, its a pleasure to meet you.Christian says smoothly, warmly, completely unflustered by Kates introduction.He holds out his hand, which, all credit to Ray, Ray takes, not showing a hint of the drop dead surprise hes just had thrust upon him.Thank you very much, Katherine Kavanagh, I fume.I think my subconscious has fainted.Mr.Grey, Ray murmurs, his expression indecipherable except perhaps for the slight widening of his big brown eyes.They slide over my face with a when were you going togive me this news look.I bite my lip.And this is my brother, Ethan Kavanagh.says Kate to Christian.Christian turns his arctic glare on Ethan, who still has one arm around me.Mr.Kavanagh.They shake hands.Christian holds his hand out to me.Ana, baby, he murmurs, and I nearly expire at the endearment.I walk out of Ethans grasp, while Christian smiles icily at him, and I take my place at his side.Kate grins at me.She knows exactly what shes doing, the vixen!Ethan, Mom and Dad wanted a word.Kate drags Ethan away.So how long have you kids known each other?Ray looks impassively from Christian to me.The power of speech has deserted me.I want the ground to swallow me up.Christian puts his arm around me, his thumb skimming my naked back in a caress, before his hand clasps my shoulder.Couple of weeks or so now, he says smoothly.We met when Anastasia came to interview me for the student magazine.Didnt know you worked on the student magazine, Ana.Rays voice is a quiet admonishment, revealing his irritation.Shit.Kate was ill, I murmur.Its all I can manage.Fine speech you gave, Mr.Grey.Thank you, sir.I understand that youre a keen fisherman.Ray raises his eyebrows and smiles  a rare, genuine, bona fide Ray Steele smile  and off they go, talking fish.In fact, I soon feel surplus to requirements.Hes charming the pants off my dad like he did you, my subconscious snaps at me.His power knows no bounds.I excuse myself to go and find Kate.Shes talking to her parents, who are delightful as ever and greet me warmly.We exchange brief pleasantries, mostly about their up and coming holiday to Barbados and about our move.Kate, how could you out me to Ray?I hiss at the first opportunity we wont be over heard.Because I knew you never would, and I want to help with Christians commitment issues.Kate smiles at me sweetly.I scowl.Its me that wont commit to him, silly!He seems trs cool about it, Ana.Dont sweat it.Look at him now  Christian cannot take his eyes off you.I glance up, and both Ray and Christian are looking at me.Hes been watching you like a hawk.Id better go rescue Ray or Christian.I dont know which.You havent heard the last of this, Katherine Kavanagh!I glare at her.Ana, I did you a favor, she calls after me.Hi.I smile at both of them on my return.They seem okay.Christian is enjoying some private joke, and my dad looks unbelievably relaxed given hes in a social situation.What have they been discussing apart from fish?Ana, where are the restrooms?Back out front of the marquee and to the left.See you in a moment.You kids enjoy yourselves.Ray heads out.I glance nervously up at Christian.We pause briefly as a photographer takes a picture of both of us.Thank you, Mr.Grey.The photographer scurries off.I blink from the flash.So youve charmed my father as well?As well?Christians gray eyes burn, and he raises a questioning eyebrow.I flush.He lifts his hand and traces my cheek with his fingers.Oh, I wish I knew what you were thinking, Anastasia, he whispers darkly, cupping my chin and raising my head so that we gaze intently into each others eyes.My breath hitches.How can he have this effect on me, even in this crowded tent?Right now, Im thinking, nice tie, I breathe.He chuckles.Its recently become my favorite.I blush scarlet.You look lovely, Anastasia, this halter neck dress suits you, and I get to stroke your back, feel your beautiful skin.Suddenly, its like were on our own in the room.Just the two of us, my whole body has come alive, every nerve ending singing softly, that electricity pulling me to him, charging between us.You know its going to be good, dont you, baby?he whispers.I close my eyes as my insides uncoil and melt.But I want more, I whisper.More?he looks down at me puzzled, his eyes darkening.I nod and swallow.Now he knows.More, he says again softly.Testing the word  a small, simple word, but so full of promise.His thumb traces my lower lip.You want hearts and flowers.I nod again.He blinks down at me, and I watch his internal struggle played out in his eyes.Anastasia.His voice is soft.Its not something I know.Me neither.He smiles slightly.You dont know much, he murmurs.You know all the wrong things.Wrong?Not to me.He shakes his head.He looks so sincere.Try it, he whispers.A challenge, daring me, and he cocks his head to one side and smiles his crooked, dazzling smile.I gasp, and Im Eve in the Garden of Eden, and hes the serpent, and I cannot resist.Okay, I whisper.What?I have his full, undivided attention.I swallow.Okay.Ill try.Youre agreeing?His disbelief is evident.Subject to the soft limits, yes.Ill try.My voice is so small.Christian closes his eyes and pulls me into an embrace.Jesus, Ana, youre so unexpected.You take my breath away.He steps back, and suddenly Rays returned, and the volume in the marquee gradually rises and fills my ears.We are not alone.Holy shit, Ive just agreed to be his sub.Christian smiles at Ray, and his eyes are dancing with joy.Annie, should we get some lunch?Okay.I blink up at Ray, trying to find my equilibrium.What have you done?My subconscious screams at me.My inner goddess is doing back flips in a routine worthy of a Russian Olympic gymnast.Would you like to join us, Christian?Ray asks.Christian!I stare up at him, imploring him to refuse.I need space to think what the fuck have I done?Thank you, Mr.Steele, but I have plans.Its been great to meet you, sir.Likewise, Ray responds.Look after my baby girl.Oh, I fully intend to, Mr.Steele.They shake hands.I feel sick.Ray has no idea how Christian intends to look after me.Christian takes my hand and raises it to his lips and kisses my knuckles tenderly, his scorching eyes intent on mine.Later, Miss Steele, he breathes, his voice full of promise.My belly curls at the thought oh my.Hang on later?Ray takes my elbow and leads me toward the entrance to the tent.Seems a solid young man.Well off too.You could do a lot worse, Annie.Though why I had to hear about him from Katherine, he scolds.I shrug apologetically.Well, any man who likes and knows his fly fishing is okay with me.Holy cow  Ray approves.If only he knew.Ray drops me back at the house at dusk.Call your mom, he says.I will.Thanks for coming, Dad.Wouldnt have missed it for the world, Annie.You make me so proud.Oh no.Im not going to get emotional.A huge lump forms in my throat, and I hug him, hard.He puts his arms around me, bemused, and I cant help it  tears pool in my eyes.Hey, Annie, sweetheart, Ray croons.Big old day eh?Want me to come in and make you some tea?I laugh, in spite of my tears.Tea is always the answer according to Ray.I remember my mother complaining about him, saying that when it came to tea and sympathy, he was always good at the tea, not so hot on the sympathy.
