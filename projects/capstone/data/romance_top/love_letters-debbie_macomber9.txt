When we exchanged our vows I promised to love you, and by all that I hold sacred, I do love you, Jo Marie, with all my strength and all my will.I promised to look after you and support you and care for you to the very best of my ability.Ive watched men die.I comforted a friend in his last moments of life, and while Ive had experience with death on the battlefield, I know nothing of what is beyond.But I will tell you this  if at all possible, I will be with you.In every way I can I will support and love you as you live out the rest of your life.And if God allows I will reach out to you.I may be gone from you, but my love never will be.Look for me, Jo Marie.I will come to you, protect you.If at all possible, I will find a way to you from beyond the grave.Knowing you, loving you, I want to ask you to do something important for me.Please listen.Please understand.Dont spend the rest of your life grieving for what might have been for us.I ask only one thing of youkeep your heart open.Live for us both.Make a difference.Fall in love with life  fall in love.You have so much to offer, so much to give others.It would be a waste to dwell in the past when the future is holding its arms open with endless possibilities.Its difficult to know how to end this letter, to say what is in my heart.Im not good with words.Nor do I know how to say this other than by reminding you once more of how grateful I am to have been loved by you and to have loved you, even if for only this little while.Remember what I said.Paul    I wiped the tears from my eyes and held my breath until I could control my emotions.Rover came to me and rested his chin on my thigh as though to soothe me.From the first, I believed Paul had sent me Rover.My rescue dog, but who had rescued whom?Rover was my constant companion, and as Grace had so recently suggested, he was my comfort dog.Im glad I read Pauls letter again, I whispered, and reached for a tissue to wipe my nose.In essence, Paul was telling me to get on with my life and that he would always be with me.He was adamant that he didnt want me to spend the rest of my days grieving for him, but I would.His loss had completely impacted my life.I couldnt help but mourn for what might have been.He asked me to make a difference, and I hoped I was doing it through the inn.The inn   Id always hoped this inn would be a place of healing.Id seen it with a few of my guests.I saw it in those who had checked in with heavy hearts, burdened by the problems of life.Yet by the time they left, their spirits had lifted and theyd found solace in much the same way I had.I believed the inn was making a difference and had become the healing place Id always hoped it would be  until this weekend.As far as I could tell, everything had fallen apart for Maggie and Roy.Unexpectedly, Rover jerked around and stood in front of my door.I got up and opened it for him.He immediately shot out, pausing to stop and look over his shoulder as if to say I should follow him.As ridiculous as it is to admit, Id become accustomed to following his orders.It didnt take me long to discover what the problem was.Ellie had returned and sat in the living room with her mother.Their heads were close together, and Virginia had her hand on Ellies shoulder in a comforting gesture.I didnt want to intrude or listen in on a private conversation and was about to turn away when Virginia glanced up.She seemed grateful to see me.Would it be possible to get a pot of tea?she asked.Of course.Rover left my side and settled down by Ellies feet as if to console and reassure her.His chin rested atop her feet as if to hold her in place.If she noticed, Ellie gave no indication.Her voice was low and troubled, and while I wasnt intentionally eavesdropping, I couldnt help but overhear.Scott made excuses for him, but I refused to listen or believe anything he has to say any longer.Ive learned my lesson.What did Tom tell you?What could he say?Ellie asked, sounding terribly sad.He never intended to hurt me.He thought he was doing something good for his stepfather, but not once did he take into consideration what he was doing to me.Virginia leaned her head closer to her daughter and hugged her briefly.Oh Ellie, Im so sorry.Are you, Mom?Ellie asked.Are you really?Isnt this what youve been telling me all along?My problem is I was convinced you were wrong and that Id show you what it was to find a good man who would love me.She hiccupped a sob as if to say she was the one whod been the fool.I am sorry  sorry for tainting your view of men, and giving you a reason to want to prove me wrong.Ellies hiccupping sob turned into a sad sort of laugh.I want to go home  this whole trip was a disaster from beginning to end.Oh Ellie.Theres no reason to stay   What about your dinner with your father?Virginia asked.They were interrupted by the front door being flung open.Normally, Rover would have been on his feet and barking, but he refused to leave Ellies side.Roy came into the house as if he intended to tear off the door by its hinges.He looked around and saw Ellie and her mother in the living room and me in the kitchen, paused momentarily, and then raced up the stairs.Virginia looked at me, her eyes wide.Whats his problem?I shrugged, not knowing what to say.Not two minutes after Roy stormed up the stairs, he returned and confronted me in the kitchen.Wheres Maggie?he demanded gruffly.I dont know.Her suitcase is gone.Yes, I know.She left shortly after you dropped her off.Roy frowned.She didnt tell you where she was going?Id tried to find out but had gotten nothing out of her.I dont think she knew herself.Of all the stupid  the woman is irrational and   Pregnant, I finished for him.His eyes narrowed with accusation.She told you?Just that.I could only assume there was more, and apparently lots more.Roy clenched and unclenched his fists as if using restraint not to slam one against the wall.She cant have gotten far.No, I dont imagine that she has.Ill find her.His face hardened with determination.And when I do, well be checking out.In his current frame of mind, I wouldnt consider that a loss, but I felt obliged to tell him my policy regarding early departures.Youre paid through Sunday, and I cant give you a refund.I dont care, he snapped.Keep the money.I didnt notice any love or real concern in him over his wifes disappearance, only anger and something else I didnt immediately recognize, but then it came to me.Roy was dealing with grief and loss.Do you know which way she went?he asked, as he pulled his car keys from his pocket.I shook my head.I didnt see her once she left the driveway.He nodded and headed out of the inn.It seemed Virginia, Ellie, and I all breathed a collective sigh of relief as Roy left the house.The teakettle whistled, and I returned my attention to putting together a tray for the mother and daughter.The doorbell chimed, and Rover was instantly alert and rushed to the door.I opened it to find an attractive middle aged man with a full head of salt and pepper hair.He looked up at me, and for a moment it seemed he didnt know what to say.Im here to see Ellie Reynolds, he said.Im her father.27     The instant Scott Reynolds entered the living room, Ellies mother leaped to her feet.She moved behind the sofa as though to put a barrier between her and the man shed once loved.Ellie turned to look at her mother and then her father.She waited for him to speak.With everything that had happened since shed last seen him, including her talk with Tom and her mothers arrival, Ellie had nearly forgotten that shed agreed to meet Scott for dinner.To Ellies surprise, it was her mother who spoke first.Scott.He seemed equally dumbfounded.Ginny.Ginny?Ellie had never heard her mother referred to as anything but Virginia.Her grandmother had insisted on it.The two stared at each other like schoolyard children waiting for the other to make the first move in a game of tag.Her fathers face softened perceptively.The years have been kind to you, he said, after clearing his throat.You look  well, Ellies mother said, almost as if she were in a trance.Scott ran his hand along the side of his head.The hairs a lot thinner  You look exactly as I remember you.It seemed both had forgotten Ellie was in the room.She had to resist waving her arms above her head in order to remind them that they werent alone.After an awkward pause, Virginia spoke.I understand you met with our daughter this afternoon.Her fathers gaze shifted toward Ellie.As a young girl and even later as a preteen, shed built up this fantasy of what her father would be like.She had him pictured in her mind, not so much what he looked like, but how he would be and how much he would love her.He would sit and listen to her play the piano and praise her efforts.He would take her to father daughter dances and their steps would match perfectly as they whirled around the polished dance floor.When a date came to pick her up, he would drill the young man and be protective.Unfortunately, none of her fantasies had come to pass.Her father had remained nothing more than an absent figure in her life.Until now.Ellies a terrific girl.We met earlier this afternoon, and shes matured into a lovely, capable woman, he said.She had?Ellie basked in those few words, praise shed longed to hear from her father, words, however few, that validated her in his eyes.Tom thinks the world of her.Shes all he talks about  It reminds me of when we first met and how crazy we once were about each other.Ellie was about to tell her father exactly what she thought of Tom, but she wasnt given the chance.Tom is your stepson?her mother asked, although Ellie had explained that fact quite clearly.Scott nodded.His intentions were good, although he went about our meeting all wrong.Still, hes a fine young man.He isnt all that wonderful in my eyes.Ellie could keep silent no longer.Both her mother and father looked at her as if theyd forgotten she was in the room, which apparently they had.Tom misled me.He lied and he used my attraction to him for his own selfish reasons.He did it for me, Scott explained, and to his credit, he sounded apologetic.Tom knew how deeply I regretted not knowing my daughter or being the father she deserved.He had no right to lie  to mislead me.Ellie wanted to make that one point crystal clear.None whatsoever.Her father nodded and took one step closer.Like I said, his intentions were good, but his methods left a lot to be desired.No kidding.Ellie didnt understand what was happening.All her parents seemed capable of doing was staring at each other.This made no sense to her.This was the golden opportunity to let her mother tell Scott exactly what she thought of him.Virginia had certainly shared those feelings with Ellie often enough.Wasnt this the chance Virginia had impatiently waited for all these years?At last her mother could tell this man who had broken her heart exactly how his abandonment had tainted her life.Perhaps she needed a bit of prompting.Scott, Ellie said, hoping to break the spell.You have some explaining to do.Youre right, I do, he agreed, and advanced another step toward them.When theyd met earlier that afternoon Ellie hadnt had the chance to ask him more than a couple questions, but that wasnt his fault.She had been overwhelmed by the fact she was talking to her father.His gaze centered on Ellie.Seeing you brought back a flash flood of memories of your mother and me.I have questions that need to be answered, Ellie said, and as far as she was concerned, there was no time like the present to get the answer to the most pressing one.I need to know why you walked out on Mom and me.Why did you leave us the way you did?His face tightened, and he cast an accusing glare toward Ellies mother.I didnt walk out on either one of you.Yes, you did.Mom said  Ellie paused and looked at her mother, but her mother refused to meet her gaze.Virginia seemed to find something interesting at her feet that demanded her attention.Mom?I was given an ultimatum, her father explained.Your mother wanted me to take money from her family, which I refused to do.When I wouldnt play ball with your grandfather, he had me fired and made sure my life was miserable.Dad only wanted to help, Virginia insisted, defending her father.No, he didnt, Scott argued just as heatedly.He wanted to control us, mostly me.Hed had you wrapped around his finger, and when he found he couldnt control me he retaliated.When I couldnt take it any longer, I decided we had to move.I hoped you loved me enough to break away from your family.And starve?Ginny, for the love of heaven, we wouldnt have starved.We had little more than each other, and for me that was enough, but apparently it wasnt enough for you.You cant live on love, Virginia said.That sounded like something her grandparents would say, Ellie mused.We lived on love the first two years, and, yes, there were hard times.We rarely had more than a couple dimes in our pockets, but we survived and were better for it.We did make it, her mother agreed, but it was hard, Scott.You worked two jobs and I rarely saw you.Ellie has no memories of you.All Dad wanted you to do was accept a loan.A loan with so many strings attached that they felt like a noose around my neck.Ellies mother shook her head as if to dismiss the accusation.It was your pride.Scott looked at her as if weary of the argument that was more than twenty years old.What does it matter now?Its all water under the bridge.Yes, Virginia agreed.Water thats long since washed out to sea.Ellie waited for her mother to bring up the letter shed written shortly after her husband had moved out.Virginia didnt, and in that instant Ellie knew why.It hurt her mothers pride to disclose the fact that shed reached out to her husband only to be rejected.The silence grew thick, like fog rolling in off Puget Sound, circling the room.I have another question, Ellie inserted, and it seemed both her parents were relieved to move forward.Yes?her father said, looking to her expectantly.In fact, I had an entire list of questions I wanted to ask.Ellie felt there was no time like now with both her parents in the room.Scott grinned.He actually grinned.You sounded so like your mother just now.Ask your questions, Ellie, Virginia insisted.Perhaps we should all sit down.I asked Jo Marie to brew a pot of tea, which she did.Ill pour.Scott took the big overstuffed chair while Ellie and her mother settled on the sofa.The tray with the teacups was on the coffee table.Her mother went into the kitchen and returned with a third cup, a mug this time.She poured the tea and handed the first cup to Ellie, the mug to Scott, and left the last cup for herself.They settled back and waited.Ellie clenched her hand around the teacup.First and foremost, I want to know why you never answered my mothers letter.Ellie, her mother warned beneath her breath.Leaning forward, she set the teacup back on the saucer and then straightened and crossed her arms over her middle.Scott frowned.What letter?The question was met with silence.Apparently, her mother wasnt willing to discuss the matter.Ellie felt no such restraint.The one Mom mailed you shortly after you abandoned us.You mean after I moved out?However you want to phrase it!Virginia placed her hand on Ellies knee as if to say Enough.Scotts brow condensed into thick lines.You wrote me a letter, Ginny?When?Her mothers arms were wrapped so tightly around her middle Ellie wondered how she was able to breathe normally.About a month after you left.Ellie had to strain to hear her mother.A month, Mom?Virginia nodded.What did you say?Scott asked gently.What does it matter?Its just more water under the bridge, isnt it?No, he argued, it isnt.This matters.Virginia pinched her lips together as if to let them both know she had no intention of revealing a single word of that letter.Mom only told me about it earlier today, Ellie explained.She wrote to tell you that she regretted everything and wanted you to come and get us.Traitor, Virginia whispered, for Ellies ears alone.Ginny, you wrote me?He looked stunned.No one was that good an actor.Shock was written on every facial feature, but especially his eyes, which grew wide and intense.It wasnt like I had your phone number.You didnt want the divorce?No.I was distraught, and afterward I told my parents what I did.They assured me the divorce was for the best and that if youd had a change of heart you would have responded.It was then that they convinced me to file.Ellies father set his mug down on the tray, and when he spoke every word was strong and distinct.I never got a letter, Ginny.Once I was out of the rental house I never heard from you again.But I  mailed it myself.I took it down to the neighbors house and put it in their mailbox instead of our own.Mrs.Mullin?Yes.How did you know?My goodness, Ginny, your mother and Mrs.Mullin were thick as thieves.My guess is, she took her own mail out, found your letter, and then gave it to your mother, because, God as my witness, I never got it.Would it have made a difference?Virginia asked, her voice strong and defiant.Scott didnt hesitate.It would have made all the difference in the world.I was miserable without you and Ellie.When you returned my letter   Her mother half rose from the sofa cushion.What letter?The letter you wrote Return to Sender across and never opened.But I didnt do any such thing, she protested.I never saw a letter.It sounded as if her mother was close to tears.Every day I prayed Id hear from you.The minute I got home from work the first thing I did was check the mail, hoping with all my heart that you would agree to give us another chance.No one needed to explain to Ellie what had happened.Her grandparents had interceded and neither her mother nor her father had gotten the opportunity to communicate with the other.Both her parents looked at each other as if there was far more they needed to say, but Ellie had other questions she wanted to ask.Not once in the entire time I was growing up did you ask to see me, she blurted out.I want to know why.I dont have a good excuse, Scott said, his eyes revealing his pain, and Ill regret that for the rest of my life.When the divorce was final I heard from your mothers attorney.He said if I made any effort to be part of your life your grandfather would drag me through every court in the land.I didnt have the money to fight them, and so I didnt try.Why not later, when I was an adult?she asked again, needing more than what hed told her earlier.Do you have an excuse for that?No.His answer was straight and to the point.No excuse whatsoever.Youd lived nearly your entire life without me.I figured by this time you wouldnt want to hear from me and that you probably hated me.Frankly, I couldnt blame you.In a nutshell, I guess I was afraid.She pressed her hand to her chest.If only he knew how shed hungered for a father.Scott looked away and refused to meet her gaze, and yet every facial feature revealed his regret.I didnt want to disrupt your life.I could only imagine what your mother and grandparents had said to taint me in your eyes.Ellie, I thought after their indoctrination you wouldnt want anything to do with me.I didnt hate you, she whispered.She wanted to hate her father but found she couldnt make herself do it.I came to take you to dinner, her father continued.But Im here for another reason, too.I came because of Tom.Hes afraid hes lost you and its devastated him.He realizes he should have told you who he was right away, but he kept putting it off and then it was too late and the chance to warn you was gone.He destroyed my trust.Ellie folded her arms in much the same way her mother had earlier.I cant see a relationship working for me and Tom.I wish I could, because I have genuine feelings for him, but I doubt I can get past what he did.I want you to reconsider, Ellie, her father urged.I dont know that I can.She didnt want to discuss Tom.What was important was going home to Bend, to all that was familiar and comfortable.Then and only then could she analyze the events of this weekend and decide how best to deal with Toms deception.It was almost as if Scott hadnt heard her.His gaze remained focused on Virginia, and he couldnt seem to stop looking at her.I didnt know Ginny was here.I only just arrived, Ellies mother explained.Im grateful you came  so grateful.How so?Virginia asked, blushing as she spoke.For the first time in over twenty years I have the chance to tell you how sorry I am that our marriage didnt work out.Her mothers returning smile was tentative and awkward, as if she wasnt sure how to respond.Ellie read the same regret in her mother and realized that through all these years Virginia had remained in love with Scott Reynolds.You did a wonderful job raising our daughter, Scott said, his voice low and intense.Thank you for that.For several moments her mother struggled to speak.Thats very kind of you, Scott.Her father turned his attention back to Ellie.I wish you wouldnt be so quick to judge.I know my stepson, and hes a good man.He did this for me.He wanted to give me the chance to know you and so he arranged it as a surprise for us both, thinking that was the only way to bring us together.He would never have intentionally hurt you.If anything, I believe he fell deeply in love with you.Hes beating himself up over whats happened, and I feel Im the one to blame.Go to him, Ellie, her mother urged.Ellie couldnt believe what she was hearing.Mom?After all the warnings her mother had issued about trusting men, this was completely out of character.Dont make the same mistake I did and let pride get in the way.Or the mistake I made in leaving you behind when I should have been fighting with every ounce of strength I possessed to be part of your life, her father added.Go, Ellie, go to Tom.Her heart was shouting one thing and her stubbornness was saying something else entirely.Dont live with regret the way I have, her father urged.And I have, her mother added.Undecided still, Ellie stood and after a moment asked, Where is he?Scott told her and then handed her his car keys.Youll need these.Shes more accustomed to driving my car, Virginia insisted, and hurried from the room, returning in a matter of seconds with her purse.She dug out her keys and handed them to Ellie.Will you two be all right while Im away?Ellie asked her parents, half joking.Well be fine, her mother insisted.Yes, we will, Scott agreed.It seems we have a lot to discuss.28     By the time Maggie had walked down the hill dragging her suitcase into Cedar Cove shed managed to get her emotions under control and dry her eyes.She had purpose now.First things first.Shed need to find a way back to Yakima, to home, without her husband.She paused and slowly exhaled.From now on she had to stop thinking of Roy as her husband.He wanted a divorce and she would give him one without putting up a fight.Pain gripped her, and she nearly stumbled forward.Her marriage was over.Itd been over when Roy had started the emotional affair with Katherine, only shed been too stubborn and too much in love to realize it.It was easy to lay blame at his feet, but they were both at fault.They had failed each other.Her life revolved around their children and shed ignored her husbands needs.Shed been blind and foolish, but then Roy had, too.Her one hope was that they could get through the next year without coming to hate each other.Divorces could be messy; she would do her best to make sure bitterness wasnt part of the dissolution of their marriage.Once she was on Harbor Street, the main road through town, Maggie found a coffee shop called the Java Joint.Stepping up to the counter, she checked her purse, unsure of how much cash she had on her.Can I help you?asked a young man with a name badge that identified him as Connor.Id love a cup of herbal tea, Maggie said, realizing she would need to alter her diet and avoid caffeine now that she was aware of this pregnancy.Weve got several herbal teas to choose from, Connor informed her cheerfully.Go ahead and look over the list and make a selection.He pointed to an upright menu that listed the names of several teas.Maggie chose chamomile, hoping the tea would help calm her nerves.You just get to town?Connor asked, eyeing her suitcase.The shuttle bus stops close by, and people often come in for a cup of joe.Maggie wasnt sure how to answer without inviting other questions.Sort of.She wasnt interested in starting up a conversation with the teenager.Cedar Cove is a great town.He rang up her order and then announced, Thatll be a dollar fifty.Maggie slid a couple dollars across the counter.Connor handed her back the change, and she noticed the tip jar was front and center and dropped a quarter inside.Thanks, he said.Im saving up for college but decided all the tips I collect on weekends will go toward a ticket to a Seahawk football game.A guys got to have some fun, right?As he spoke, he reached for a large insulated cup and filled it with steaming hot water and handed it to her, along with the tea bag.The Java Joint had two other customers, and Maggie settled down in the back, away from the window.The other couple left, leaving her the sole occupant.She opened the tea bag and dipped it into the nearly boiling hot water, letting it steep.She liked her tea weak.Her thoughts wandered back to Roy and she was nearly overwhelmed with sadness.She was lost in her musings when Connor approached.You can put your used tea bag in this, he said, and handed her a plastic spoon and a couple napkins.Oh, sure, thanks, she mumbled.Taking out the tea bag, she wrapped the string around the spoon and squeezed out as much of the liquid as she could.She tasted the tea and nearly burned her lips.Do you want ice chips?Connor called from behind the counter.That water can get really hot.The youth was apparently looking for something to keep himself occupied.No, thanks.I make a mean latte if youre looking for something to tide you over until dinnertime.The special of the day is salted caramel mocha.Its one of our best sellers.Thanks, but no thanks.Maggie wished shed sat with her back to him, but to change places now would seem rude.Because she sat facing him and it was just the two of them, it seemed to encourage conversation.Maggie didnt feel up to chatting.After a few minutes, she tried her tea again.Ive got to go to the back room for a few minutes, Connor announced.If anyone comes in, tell them to ring the bell on the counter.Will do.Peace at last, but then Maggie realized there was no peace for her.Not now, and probably not for a very long time.She checked her cell phone and saw, thankfully, that it was fully charged.Logging on to the Internet, she scanned rental car agencies.Getting a car was sure to be cheaper than flying back to Yakima.Once home, shed need to look into a number of matters.Her cousin Larry Morris was an attorney, and hed help her through the divorce proceedings.It would be necessary for her to find employment outside the home, although finding a position now would be difficult, seeing that shed need time off when she delivered this baby.The baby.Aborting the pregnancy sounded like a quick, easy solution, and for some it might be, but not for her.In reality, it would solve nearly everything.It might even help save her marriage for the time being, but it wouldnt help for long.An abortion would be only a Band Aid to what was really wrong with her and Roys marriage.For a moment, just a moment, she reconsidered.Maybe she could do it  maybe it would help.The thought didnt last long, though.She knew it would be pointless, and shed be riddled with guilt afterward.Maggie knew herself well enough to realize doing away with the pregnancy wasnt the answer for her.Thankfully, Roy recognized the truth of that as much as she did.What distressed her with a divorce was the thought of her two sons growing up with a part time father.The fact was, Maggie didnt want this divorce.If she could turn back the clock a month she would never have left the house the night of their fight, but then hindsight didnt do her a bit of good now.A baby.Maggie wished with everything in her that she wasnt pregnant.Roy didnt want this child.And the truth was, she wasnt the least bit excited to be pregnant.Her upper body rocked with indecision, swaying with doubt, with fear.Yes, delivering this baby would be problematic.Frankly, she didnt know how shed manage raising three children on her own, working forty hours a week, and keeping up with the house, and still have any semblance of a life.Maggie stiffened with determination.Other single mothers had managed all that and more and, with grit and determination, she would, too.She had the advantage of a college degree.She was employable.Still, her heart ached and she was forced to swallow down a bubble of near hysteria as worries and reservations pounded against her like rocks bouncing against an embankment in a landslide.Needing a distraction, she returned her focus to the Internet and read through the rental car specials.She booked the cheapest one she could find, which unfortunately meant she had to travel into Seattle, near Sea Tac Airport.Earlier, Connor had mentioned a shuttle bus that went to the airport, where she could collect the vehicle.If she could get the information for that, it would be perfect.No doubt Connor would be able to direct her.The cell phone was still in her hand when a text message came through from Roy.Where are you?I dont appreciate you disappearing like this.I want to leave as soon as possible.Maggie texted back a rely: Then go.As far as she was concerned, everything had already been said.This wasnt a game, nor was it a trick, and after all these years together, Roy should know that.When shed broken up with him while they were in college it wasnt a trick or a scheme to get him to change his ways.Shed never been one to throw out idle threats; she meant what she said.With the phone in her hand, Maggie hungered for solace, for a connection with her familyshe needed to talk to her sister  not about her current situation.She couldnt, wouldnt mention anything about that  not yet.First and foremost, she needed to get home, back to her children.Then and only then could she orient herself enough to explain to her family and friends that while it was unfortunate, her marriage was over.Without putting much thought into the decision, she phoned her sister, Julia.Maggie, Julia answered, sounding upbeat and happy.Hows your getaway weekend going with Roy?Great, she said, forcing enthusiasm into her voice.We spent the day in Seattle and went to Pike Place Market, and took a tour of Underground Seattle.Seattle has an underground?I didnt know that.It was fascinating.A great history lesson.I recommend you take the tour the next time you and Sam get to Seattle.Julia laughed skeptically.The only thing Sam wants to see in Seattle is football.Its a four  or five hour drive from Spokane but youd think it was across the street the way he acts, and in the middle of winter, no less.Everything good with you?Maggie asked.Its great.Her sister hesitated.You okay?You dont sound quite right.You havent for the last month.Somethings on your mind, isnt it?You think I cant tell?Come on, Maggie, Im your sister.Whats up?Im fine.What could be wrong?she said, downplaying the mess shed made of her life.You have to remember, Im on a romantic getaway with my husband.We have three glorious days without kids.B u t ?Her sister dragged out the word so that it became a question.It was irrational to think Maggie might be able to fool her sister into thinking everything was all well and good.Guess what?she teased.Im not guessing, Julia said, her voice somber and serious now.Im pregnant.She tried to sound happy but failed.Maggie, thats wonderful  isnt it?Yes.Julia hesitated.Im not hearing the joy.I know you and Roy had considered a third child.The last time we talked about it, you said Roy was hoping for a girl next time.Hed like that.I take it the pregnancy wasnt planned.You could say that.If only her sister knew the truth.Eventually, Maggie would tell her, but not now.I agree three is a handful, Julia said, and I should know, but youll adjust.It was the biggest transition for me after having Trevor and Travis.Then Ted arrived and it was pandemonium for the first six months.When I found out I was pregnant with Tracy, I didnt know how we would manage, but it was fine.Going from three to four is not nearly as difficult.Maggie needed to hear her sisters chatter.It helped calm her nerves, helped her deal with the present and not think ahead to how she would handle the future.Wheres Roy?Julia asked, out of the blue.Resting.Which, unfortunately, was a necessary white lie.Were staying at a bed and breakfast here in Cedar Cove.Its the perfect location.Roys mom has a romantic heart, and shes the one who paid for this anniversary gift.If you and Sam need to get away, I cant think of any place better.You went away for the weekend and discovered you were pregnant.We have our family; Im not taking the risk, her sister teased.Is Roy happy?The question caught Maggie off guard.Happy?About the pregnancy.Maggie wasnt sure she could get away with another lie.Truth is, its a bit of a shock to us both.It takes a while to set our minds to the idea sometimes.A new baby is a major adjustment in a family.Have you told Mom and Dad?Not yet  youre the only one Ive told.If you need anything, youll let me know, right?Maggies mind wandered to the garage, where theyd stored the boys baby furniture, and immediately bounced to another concern.She might not be able to keep the house.No worries there.I saved the crib and everything from the boys.I wasnt talking about baby furniture, Maggie.I mean emotional support and encouragement.Ive been there.Im your big sister and Im here to lend a hand if you need me.Thanks, Julia.Her sister had no idea of how badly Maggie was going to need her in the upcoming months.They chatted about the kids, a safe subject, for a few minutes before Maggie was ready to end the call.I better go, Maggie said, when she noticed Connor had returned to the counter.A man came into the Java Joint.Youre sure everything is all right with you?Julia asked again.Of course.All is well, she answered.Like I said, you dont sound like yourself, Julia murmured.Something is up.Youre probably not ready to share it, but know that Im here when you are, okay?Maggie could hear the frown in her sisters voice.Im fine, really, she insisted.Ill call you next week and we can talk more then.Its a date.Once she ended the call, Maggie returned her phone to her purse.The man at the counter had collected his drink and left.Connor was busy filling the sugar and artificial sweetener containers.He glanced up when Maggie approached the counter.You need a refill?Theyre complimentary.No, thanks.Im full up.She placed her hand on her stomach as if shed recently finished a three course meal.I was wondering if you could tell me about the shuttle bus that leaves from Cedar Cove to the airport, the one you mentioned earlier.Oh sure.Its the Sea Tac Transporter.I have a schedule.A lot of folks stop off here and collect coffee before heading out, especially the morning and mid morning buses.He opened a drawer and took out a plastic coated sheet and handed it to her.Do I need to make a reservation?she asked, noticing that they were recommended.It wouldnt hurt, but it shouldnt be a problem getting a seat.Maggie wrote down the phone number, stepped away from the counter, and made the call.Just as Connor had predicted, she was able to book a seat.The woman on the other end of the line told her the pickup point, which didnt seem to be far from where she was.The bus should arrive within the next fifteen minutes, the woman told her.Ill make my way there right now, Maggie assured the reservation clerk.Im a short distance away.The driver doesnt wait.Ill be there, Maggie promised.She returned to the table for her suitcase and thanked Connor on her way out the door.Just as she was leaving, another customer entered the store.The other woman held open the door for Maggie to go out first, and she would have except for one thing.Roy.Her husband drove past the Java Joint at just that moment.Maggie shrank back into the coffee place, nearly tripping backward in her rush not to be seen.You come inside first, Maggie insisted, as she all but plastered herself against the wall.The woman gave her an odd look but then complied.It took a few moments for Maggies breathing to return to normal before she ventured outside a second time.Her one objective was to get to the bus stop and board without Roy seeing her.He could look all he wanted, but Maggie was determined not to be found.29     I heard voices in the other room and poked my head around the corner of the kitchen to find the man whod told me he was Ellies father talking with Virginia Reynolds.They were alone, and the two appeared deep in conversation.They didnt notice me, which was just as well.I wondered what had happened to Ellie, who was nowhere in sight.The front door was left partially open, which told me that perhaps Ellie had left.When I checked outside I saw that Virginias vehicle was missing, which was a good indication that Ellie had taken the car.The Porters car was gone as well.The last time I saw Roy hed been in a bear of a mood.I hoped that improved once he found Maggie.I remained worried about the couple, who were clearly having marriage problems.I thought matters had improved, but Id guessed wrong.Just that morning before theyd left for Seattle I had had a strong feeling that whatever had troubled them had been resolved.Clearly, something had happened since that time that had deeply upset them both.I suspected it must be the discovery that Maggie was pregnant.Really none of this was my business, but I couldnt help being concerned.Id never considered myself nosy and briefly wondered if I was seeking yet another distraction.Looping the handle of a white wicker basket over my forearm, I collected my garden scissors and headed toward the side yard, where I had two large hydrangea plants.Mark was busy sorting through the lumber hed unpacked earlier.He had the plans for the gazebo spread out on the tailgate of his pickup.I watched him refer to those drawings a number of times.One thing I admired about Mark: When it came to his work he was a perfectionist.It might take him longer to complete a project than I wanted, but by the time he was finished, whatever he was working on was beautifully done.I was about to ask him a question regarding the gazebo when Roy Porter unexpectedly returned, spitting up gravel as the cars tires spun.He came to an abrupt stop and turned off the engine.He didnt seem to be in a hurry to get out and sat for several moments before exiting the vehicle.Whatever was eating at him didnt appear to be resolved, because he slammed the door closed with enough force to rattle the cars windows.Mark straightened and set down on the grass the two by four he carried.You got a problem?he called out to Roy.The other man paused and sent Mark a hard look.If Mark thought he was helping, he was wrong.The anger in Roys eyes was hot enough to fry bacon.Everyones got problems, Roy replied.Mark chuckled.And most of them involve women.I didnt take kindly to that comment, but went about my business and pretended not to hear.Youre telling me!Roy said.He walked over to where Mark stood and jabbed his hands into his pockets.What are you building?Jo Marie wants a gazebo for weddings and the like.Mark walked over to his truck and picked up the plans to show Roy.I understand youre in construction.Roy reached for the plans and appeared to be studying them before returning them to Mark.Youre right about women being the root of most problems.Dont I know it, Mark muttered.They can make a mans life a living hell.Like he would know!Mark lived alone, and if he was ever married there was no evidence of it.I couldnt help but wonder if he was speaking from experience, although it seemed unlikely.Are you using treated lumber for this?Roy asked, abruptly changing the subject.Yes, it was more money than what Id budgeted, but I figure it will save Jo Marie problems in the long run.Roy walked over to Marks truck.Apparently, I was far enough on the side of the house that neither man could see me, which was just as well.They wouldnt be comfortable knowing I was listening in on their conversation.Ive decided to divorce Maggie, Roy announced.Oh dear, no wonder shed been upset.Sorry to hear that, Mark returned casually, leaning against the tailgate.Both men stood there with their arms crossed.Neither seemed eager to talk, and I wondered if Roy would return to the house.I was somewhat surprised when he didnt.Its for the best, Roy told him.So thats why Maggie left?Roy shrugged.You know how women get.She went all emotional and irrational on me and walked away.She took her suitcase with her and didnt say a word about where she was headed.Seems she wants to find her own way back to Yakima, which is fine by me.I looked for her and couldnt find her.I did what I could, right?Right, Mark concurred.Actually, its probably better this way so I dont have to deal with her hysterics.Yeah, its probably for the best.Mark was more than agreeable.I was about to intercede and tell them both they were dead wrong but stopped myself.Mark quickly changed the subject and asked Roy a couple construction questions.The conversation went on for about five minutes.Id long since finished cutting the flowers I needed for the bouquet and was ready to head back into the house when Mark spoke again.Im sorry to hear that Maggie is a bad mother.You have two boys, thats what you said, right?Right.Jaxon and Collin.Theyll be better off without her, Mark finished.Roy straightened away from the truck.Maggies a great mother.Its the other stuff I cant deal with.Oh sorry, I must have misunderstood.I assumed youd want custody of your sons.No, Roy said reluctantly, as if taking this into consideration for the first time.It would be better if the boys stayed with their mother for the time being.Theyre still young enough to need her.If I had them, it would mean theyd be stuck in day care all day, and we agreed before we had kids that Maggie would be a stay at home mother.So Maggie doesnt work outside the home?No, were fortunate that way.She has her teaching certificate but put her career on hiatus in order to be with the boys.Mark nodded as though weighing this information against other concerns.From what Ive heard some women can be good mothers and lousy wives.A man has needs, you know, and their wives get so caught up in the mommy scene that they forget theyre married.I rolled my eyes.It was all I could do not to march out and demand to know how he was such a know it all when it came to marital problems.My handyman sounded like a professional counselor.From the way he was talking, he could hold seminars on the subject.Maggies been a good wife, Roy said, with some reluctance.Well, no worries, there are plenty of fish in the sea.Youll find another woman in no time, and next time youll know what to look for.Next time?You arent going to let this experience sour you, are you?Mark asked.That would be a shame.Besides, your sons will be just as happy with a stepmother.Roy shook his head.Im not ready to think about remarrying.Of course not, Mark agreed, its early days yet, but it gets lonely, and after a while youll be looking for companionship.Its not right that you be alone, especially if you want the boys to stay with your ex wife.Maggies not my ex wife.Not yet she isnt, Mark agreed.But she will be soon enough, right?Right, Roy said, conviction marking his words.This isnt what I wanted, but I dont have any choice.This isnt what you wanted?Mark repeated.I thought you told me youre the ones decided to file.For just an instant Roy looked confused.Yeah, I guess I did.Mark removed his hat and scratched the side of his head as if what Roy said made no sense.Maggies not the woman I thought I knew, Roy explained.She stepped way over the line, and now  now there are consequences.A man can overlook certain things, but not others, if you know what I mean.Sure I do.Mark was certainly agreeable.A guy works his fingers to the bone in order to support his family only to have his gut twisted by a no good, cheating wife.Were oblivious, gullible, and easily fooled because our focus is on taking care of those we love.Its all work for us.Work, work, work.Roy walked away from the truck.It wasnt like that with Maggie.Oh sorry, I assumed, you know, that she was running around on you behind your back.Not really, Roy murmured, and then seemed to gather his resolve, but some things can be forgiven and others cant.To be fair to Maggie, it wasnt all one sided   Youre right again, Mark said.There are certain aspects to marriage vows that a man cant easily overlook or forgive, even if hes looked at another woman a time or two himself.Dont misunderstand me, Roy said, his hands deep inside his pockets.Ive made my share of mistakes.Of course you have, we all have, but nothing as bad as what Maggie did.Right, Roy returned, but without the same conviction hed had earlier.The thing Ive noticed with women, Mark continued, speaking again as if he were an expert on the subject, is that it isnt in females to forgive.They might claim they have, but with every disagreement, every slight weve ever committed gets thrown back in our faces.A woman can drag up sins that are twenty years old.Forgiveness isnt part of their emotional makeup.Roy looked away and then commented, Maggies never been like that.Youre joking?No, Roy murmured.He started to pace, although I realized he probably wasnt aware of what he was doing.No problem, man, Mark said.Your mind is made up.You know what to do, so good for you.From what I read, statistics say its women who most often file for divorce, not the husbands.Youre making a stand and you arent going to allow Maggie to push you around.Thats not her way, Roy murmured.Oh, shes one of those subtle types, is she?You know, the passive aggressive kind.She cooks you dinner, but its cold; does your wash and puts your underwear in with the colored clothes so they come out red.Roy looked up at Mark as though hed spoken a foreign language.Let another man deal with her and all her baggage, Mark suggested.Another man?Roy repeated, as if this was something else he hadnt considered.Well, sure.Like I said, there are a lot of fish in the sea.Youll eventually remarry, and in every likelihood, so will Maggie.I watched as Roy abruptly stopped pacing as if the truth of what Mark said jolted him.
