At leastno.Well, maybe a bit foolish.After a bit more encouragement, the story came out, reluctantly at first, then in a tumbling flood of confession.He had been out on his pony, riding with some of the other boys the day before.Several of the older lads had started competing, to see who could jump his horse over a higher obstacle.Jealously admiring them, Hamishs better judgment was finally overcome by bravado, and he had tried to force his fat little pony over a stone fence.Lacking both ability and interest, the pony had come to a dead stop at the fence, tossing young Hamish over his head, over the fence, and ignominiously into a nettle patch on the other side.Stung both by nettles and by the hoots of his comrades, Hamish was determined to come out today on a proper horse, as he put it.They wouldna laugh if I came out on Donas, he said, envisioning the scene with grim relish.No, they wouldna laugh, Jamie agreed.Theyd be too busy picking up the pieces.He eyed his cousin, shaking his head slowly.Ill tell ye, lad.It takes courage and sense to make a good rider.Youve the courage, but the sense is a wee bit lacking, yet.He put a consoling arm round Hamishs shoulders, drawing him down toward the end of the stable.Come along, man.Help me fork the hay, and well get ye acquainted wi Cobhar.Youre right; ye should have a better horse if youre ready, but it isna necessary to kill yourself to prove it.Glancing up into the loft as he passed, he raised his eyebrows and shrugged helplessly.I smiled and waved down at him, telling him to go ahead, it was all right.I watched them as Jamie took an apple from the basket of windfalls kept near the door.Fetching a pitchfork from the corner, he led Hamish back to one of the center stalls.Here, coz, he said, pausing.He whistled softly through his teeth and a wide browed bay horse put its head out, blowing through its nostrils.The dark eyes were large and kind, and the ears had a slight forward cock that gave the horse an expression of friendly alertness.Now then, Cobhar, ciamar a tha thu?Jamie patted the sleek neck firmly, and scratched the cocked ears.Come on up, he said, motioning to his small cousin.Thats it, next to me.Near enough he can smell ye.Horses like to smell ye.I know.Hamishs high voice was scornful.He barely reached the horses nose, but reached up and patted.He stood his ground as the big head came down and sniffed interestedly around his ear, whuffling in his hair.Give me an apple, he said to Jamie, who obliged.The soft velvet lips plucked the fruit delicately out of Hamishs palm, and flicked it back between the huge molars, where it vanished with a juicy crunch.Jamie watched approvingly.Aye.Youll get on fine.Go on and make friends, then, while I finish feeding the others, then ye can take him out to ride.By myself?Hamish asked eagerly.Cobhar, whose name meant Foam, was good tempered, but a sound, spirited 14 hand gelding, nonetheless, and a far cry from the brown pony.Twice round the paddock wi me watchin ye, and if ye dinna fall off or jerk his mouth, ye can take him by yourself.No jumping him til I say, though.The long back bent, gleaming in the warm dusk of the stable, as Jamie caught up a forkful of hay from the pile in one corner and carried it to one of the stalls.He straightened and smiled at his cousin.Gi me one of those, will ye?He leaned the fork against a stall and bit into the proffered fruit.The two stood companionably eating, leaning side by side against the stable wall.When he finished, Jamie handed the core to a nuzzling sorrel and fetched his fork again.Hamish followed him down the aisle, chewing slowly.Ive heard my father was a good rider, Hamish offered tentatively, after a moments silence.Beforebefore he couldnt anymore.Jamie shot a swift glance at his cousin, but finished pitching hay into the sorrels stall before speaking.When he did, he answered the thought, rather than the words.I never saw him ride, but Ill tell ye, lad, I hope never to need as much courage as Colum has.I saw Hamishs gaze rest curiously on Jamies scarred back, but he said nothing.After a second apple, his thoughts appeared to have shifted to another topic.Rupert said ye had to get married, he remarked, through a mouthful of apple.I wanted to get married, Jamie said firmly, replacing the pitchfork against the wall.Oh.Wellgood, Hamish said uncertainly, as though disconcerted by this novel idea.I only wondereddo ye mind?Mind what?Seeing that this conversation might take a while, Jamie sat down on a bale of hay.Hamishs feet did not quite reach the floor, or he might have shuffled them.Instead, he drummed his heels lightly against the firm packed hay.Do ye mind being married, he said, staring at his cousin.Getting into bed every night with a lady, I mean.No, said Jamie.No, in fact, its verra pleasant.Hamish looked doubtful.I dinna think I should like it much.But then all the girls I know are skinny as sticks, and they smell o barely water.The lady Claireyour lady, I mean, he added hastily, as though wishing to avoid confusion, shes, er, she looks as though shed be nicer to sleep with.Soft, I mean.Jamie nodded.Aye, thats true.Smells all right, too, he offered.Even in the dim light, I could see a small muscle twitching near the corner of his mouth, and knew he didnt dare look up in the direction of the loft.There was a long pause.How dye know?Hamish said.Know what?Which is the right lady to get married to, the boy said impatiently.Oh.Jamie rocked back and settled himself against the stone wall, hands behind his head.I asked my own Da that, once, he said.He said ye just ken.And if ye dinna ken, then shes no the right lassie.Mmmphm.This seemed a less than satisfactory explanation, to judge from the expression on the small freckle spattered face.Hamish sat back, consciously aping Jamies posture.His stockinged feet stuck out over the edge of the hay bale.Small as he was, his sturdy frame gave promise of someday matching his cousins.The set of the square shoulders, and the tilt of the solid, graceful skull were nearly identical.Wheres your shoon, then?Jamie asked accusingly.Youll no ha left them in the pasture again?Your mother will box your ears for ye if yeve lost them.Hamish shrugged this off as a threat of no consequence.Clearly there was something of more importance on his mind.John he started, wrinkling his sandy brows in thought, John says  John the stable lad, John the cook boy, or John Cameron?Jamie asked.The stable lad.Hamish waved a hand, pushing away the distraction.He said, er, about getting married  Mmm?Jamie made an encouraging noise, keeping his face tactfully turned away.Rolling his eyes upward, his glance met mine, as I peered over the edge.I grinned down at him, causing him to bite his lip to keep from grinning back.Hamish drew a deep breath, and let it out in a rush, propelling his words like a burst of birdshot.He said ye must serve a lass like a stallion does a mare and I didna believe him but is it true?I bit my finger hard to keep from laughing out loud.Not so fortunately placed, Jamie dug his fingers into the fleshy part of his leg, turning as red in the face as Hamish.They looked like two tomatoes, set side by side on a hay bale for judging at a county vegetable show.Er, ayeweel, in a way he said, sounding strangled.Then he got a grip on himself.Yes, he said firmly, yes, ye do.Hamish cast a half horrified glance into the nearby stall, where the bay gelding was relaxing, a foot or so of reproductive equipment protruding from its sheath.He glanced doubtfully down into his lap then, and I stuffed a handful of fabric into my mouth as far as it would go.Theres some difference, ye ken, Jamie went on.The rich color was beginning to fade from his face, though there was still an ominous quiver around his mouth.For one thing, itsmore gentle.Ye dinna bite them on the neck, then?Hamish had the serious, intent expression of one taking careful notes.To make them keep still?Erno.Not customarily, anyway.Exercising his not inconsiderable willpower, Jamie faced up manfully to the responsibilities of enlightenment.Theres another difference, as well, he said, carefully not looking upward.Ye may do it face to face, instead of from the back.As the lady prefers.The lady?Hamish seemed dubious about this.I think Id rather do it from the back.I dinna think Id like to have anyone lookin at me while I did something like that.Is it hard, he inquired, is it hard to keep from laughing?* * *    I was still thinking about Jamie and Hamish when I came to bed that night.I turned down the thick quilts, smiling to myself.There was a cool draft from the window, and I looked forward to crawling under the quilts and nestling against Jamies warmth.Impervious to cold, he seemed to carry a small furnace within himself, and his skin was always warm; sometimes almost hot, as though he burned more fiercely in answer to my own cool touch.I was still a stranger and an outlander, but no longer a guest at the Castle.While the married women seemed somewhat friendlier, now that I was one of them, the younger girls seemed strongly to resent the fact that I had removed an eligible young bachelor from circulation.In fact, noting the number of cold glances and behind the hand remarks, I rather wondered just how many of the Castle maidens had found their way into a secluded alcove with Jamie MacTavish during his short residency.MacTavish no longer, of course.Most of the Castle inhabitants had always known who he was, and whether I was an English spy or not, I now knew of necessity as well.So he became Fraser publicly, and so did I.  It was as Mistress Fraser that I was welcomed into the room above the kitchens where the married women did their sewing and rocked their babies, exchanging bits of mother lore and eyeing my own waistline with frank appraisal.Because of my earlier difficulties in conceiving, I had not considered the possibility of pregnancy when I agreed to marry Jamie, and I waited in some apprehension until my monthly occurred on time.My feelings this time were entirely of relief, with none of the sadness that usually accompanied it.My life was more than complicated enough at the moment, without introducing a baby into it.I thought that Jamie perhaps felt a small twinge of regret, though he also professed himself relieved.Fatherhood was a luxury that a man in his position could ill afford.The door opened and he came in, still rubbing his head with a linen towel, water droplets from his wet hair darkening his shirt.Where have you been?I asked in astonishment.Luxurious as Leoch might be in contrast to the residences of village and croft, it didnt boast any bathing facilities beyond a copper tub that Colum used to soak his aching legs, and a slightly larger one used by such ladies as thought the labor involved in filling it worth the privacy.All other washing was done either in bits, using basin and ewer, or outside, either in the loch or in a small, stone floored chamber off the garden, where the young women were accustomed to stand naked and let their friends throw buckets of water over them.In the loch, he answered, hanging the damp towel neatly over the windowsill.Someone, he said grimly, left the stall door ajar, and the stable door as well, and Cobhar had a wee swim in the twilight.Oh, so thats why you werent at supper.But horses dont like to swim, do they?I asked.He shook his head, running his fingers through his hair to dry it.No, they dont.But theyre just like folk, ye ken; all different.And Cobhar is fond of the young water plants.He was down nibbling by the waters edge when a pack of dogs from the village came along and chased him into the loch.I had to run them off and then go in after him.Wait til I get my hands on wee Hamish, he said, with grim intent.Ill teach him to leave gates ajar.Are you going to tell Colum about it?I asked, feeling a qualm of sympathy for the culprit.Jamie shook his head, groping in his sporran.He drew out a roll and a chunk of cheese, apparently filched from the kitchens on his way up to the chamber.No, he said.Colums fair strict wi the lad.If he heard hed been so careless, hed not let him ride for a monthnot that he could, after the thrashing hed get.Lord, Im starving.He bit ferociously into the roll, scattering crumbs.Dont get into bed with that, I said, sliding under the quilts myself.What are you planning to do to Hamish, then?He swallowed the remainder of the roll and smiled at me.Dinna worry.Im going to row him out on the loch just before supper tomorrow and toss him in.By the time he makes it to shore and dries off, supper will be over.He finished the cheese in three bites and unashamedly licked his fingers.Let him go to bed wet and hungry and see how he likes it, he concluded darkly.He peered hopefully in the drawer of the desk where I sometimes kept apples or other small bits of food.There was nothing there tonight, though, and he shut the drawer with a sigh.I suppose Ill live til breakfast, he said philosophically.He stripped rapidly and crawled in next to me, shivering.Though his extremities were chilled from his swim in the icy loch, his body was still blissfully warm.Mm, youre nice to croodle wi, he murmured, doing what I assumed was croodling.You smell different; been digging plants today?No, I said, surprised.I thought it was youthe smell, I mean.It was a tangy, herbal smell, not unpleasant, but unfamiliar.I smell like fish, he observed, sniffing the back of his hand.And wet horse.No, he leaned closer, inhaling.No, it isna you, either.But its close by.He slid out of bed and turned back the quilts, searching.We found it under my pillow.What on earth?I picked it up, and promptly dropped it.Ouch!It has thorns!It was a small bundle of plants, plucked up roughly by the roots, and bound together with a bit of black thread.The plants were wilted, but a pungent smell still rose from the drooping leaves.There was one flower in the bouquet, a crushed primrose, whose thorny stem had pricked my thumb.I sucked the offended digit, turning the bundle over more cautiously with my other hand.Jamie stood still, staring down at it for a moment.Then he suddenly picked it up, and crossing to the open window, flung it out into the light.Returning to the bed, he energetically brushed the crumbs of earth from the plants roots into the palm of his hand and threw them out after the bundle.He closed the window with a slam and came back, dusting his palms.Its gone, he said, unnecessarily.He climbed back into bed.Come back to bed, Sassenach.What was it?I asked, climbing in beside him.A joke, reckon, he said.A nasty one, but only a joke.He raised himself on one elbow and blew out the candle.Come here, mo duinne, he said.Im cold.* * *    Despite the unsettling ill wish, I slept well, secure in the dual protection of a bolted door and Jamies arms.Toward dawn, I dreamed of grassy meadows filled with butterflies.Yellow, brown, white, and orange, they swirled around me like autumn leaves, lighting on my head and shoulders, sliding down my body like rain, the tiny feet tickling on my skin and the velvet wings beating like faint echoes of my own heart.I floated gently to the surface of reality, and found that the butterfly feet against my stomach were the flaming tendrils of Jamies soft red thatch, and the butterfly trapped between my thighs was his tongue.Mmm, I said, sometime later.Well, thats all very well for me, but what about you?About three quarters of a minute, if you keep on in that fashion, he said, putting my hand away with a grin.But Id rather take my time over itIm a slow and canny man by nature, dye see.Might I ask the favor of your company for this evening, Mistress?You might, I said.I put my arms behind my head, and fixed him with a half lidded look of challenge.If you mean to tell me that youre so decrepit you cant manage more than once in a day anymore.He regarded me narrowly from his seat on the edge of the bed.There was a sudden flash of white as he lunged, and I found myself pressed deep into the featherbed.Aye, well, he said into the tangles of my hair, youll no say I didna warn ye.Two and a half minutes later, he groaned and opened his eyes.He scrubbed his face and head vigorously with both hands, making the shorter ends stick up like quills.Then, with a muffled Gaelic oath, he slid reluctantly out from under the blankets and began to dress, shivering in the chilly morning air.I dont suppose, I asked hopefully, that you could tell Alec youre sick, and come back to bed?He laughed and bent to kiss me before groping under the bed for his stockings.Would that I could, Sassenach.I doubt much short of pox, plague, or grievous bodily harm would answer as an excuse, though.If I werent bleeding, old Alec would be up here in a trice, dragging me off my deathbed to help wi the worming.I eyed his graceful long calves as he pulled a stocking up neatly and folded the top.Grievous bodily harm, eh?I might manage something along those lines, I said darkly.He grunted as he reached across for the other stocking.Well, watch where ye toss your elf darts, Sassenach.He tried a lewd wink, but wound up squinting at me instead.Aim too high, and Ill be no good to you, either.I arched one eyebrow and snuggled back under the quilts.Not to worry.Nothing above the knee, I promise.He patted one of my rounder bulges and left for the stables, singing rather loudly the air from Up Among the Heather.The refrain floated back from the stairwell:  Sittin wi a wee girl, holdin on my knee  When a bumblebee stung me, weel above the kneeeee  Up among the heather, at the head o Bendikee!He was right, I decided; he didnt have any ear for music.I relapsed temporarily into a state of satisfied somnolence, but roused myself shortly to go down for breakfast.Most of the castle inhabitants had eaten and gone to their work already; those still in the hall greeted me pleasantly enough.There were no sidelong looks, no expressions of veiled hostility, of someone wondering how well their nasty little trick had worked.But I watched the faces, nonetheless.The morning was spent alone in the garden and fields with my basket and digging stick.I was running short of some of the most popular herbs.Generally the village people went to Geillis Duncan for help, but there had been several patients from the village turning up of late in my dispensary, and the traffic in nostrums had been heavy.Maybe her husbands illness was keeping her too busy to care for her regular customers.I spent the latter part of the afternoon in my dispensary.There were few patients to be seen; only a case of persistent eczema, a dislocated thumb, and a kitchen boy who had spilled a pot of hot soup down one leg.Having dispensed ointment of yawroot and blue flag and reset and bound the thumb, I settled down to the task of pounding some very aptly named stoneroot in one of the late Beatons smaller mortars.It was tedious work, but well suited to this sort of lazy afternoon.The weather was fair, and I could see blue shadows lengthening under the elms to the west when I stood on my table to peer out.Inside, the glass bottles gleamed in orderly ranks, neat stacks of bandages and compresses in the cupboards next to them.The apothecarys cabinet had been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, and now held stores of dried leaves, roots, and fungi, neatly packed in cotton gauze bags.I took a deep breath of the sharp, spicy odors of my sanctum and let it out in a sigh of contentment.Then I stopped pounding and set the pestle down.I was contented, I realized with a shock.Despite the myriad uncertainties of life here, despite the unpleasantness of the ill wish, despite the small, constant ache of missing Frank, I was in fact not unhappy.Quite the contrary.I felt immediately ashamed and disloyal.How could I bring myself to be happy, when Frank must be demented with worry?Assuming that time was in fact continuing without meand I couldnt see why it wouldntI must have gone missing for upwards of four months.I imagined him searching the Scottish countryside, calling the police, waiting for some sign, some word of me.By now, he must nearly have given up hope and be waiting, instead, for word that my body had been found.I set down the mortar and paced up and down the length of my narrow room, rubbing my hands on my apron in a spasm of guilty sorrow and regret.I should have got away sooner.I should have tried harder to return.But I had, I reminded myself.I had tried repeatedly.And look what had happened.Yes, look.I was married to a Scottish outlaw, the both of us hunted by a sadistic captain of dragoons, and living with a lot of barbarians, who would as soon kill Jamie as look at him, if they thought him a threat to their precious clan succession.And the worst of it all was that I was happy.I sat down, staring helplessly at the array of jars and bottles.I had been living day to day since our return to Leoch, deliberately suppressing the memories of my earlier life.Deep down, I knew that I must soon make some kind of decision, but I had delayed, putting off the necessity from day to day and hour to hour, burying my uncertainties in the pleasures of Jamies companyand his arms.There was a sudden bumping and cursing out in the corridor, and I rose hastily and went to the door, just in time to see Jamie himself stumble in, supported by the bowed form of Old Alec McMahon on one side, and the earnest but spindly efforts of one of the stable lads on the other.He sank onto my stool, left foot outstretched, and grimaced unpleasantly at it.The grimace seemed to be more of annoyance than pain, so I knelt to examine the offending appendage with relatively little concern.Mild strain, I said, after a cursory inspection.What did you do?Fell off, Jamie said succinctly.Off the fence?I asked, teasing.He glowered.No.Off Donas.You were riding that thing?I asked incredulously.In that case, youre lucky to get off with a strained ankle.I fetched a length of bandage and began to wrap the joint.Weel, it wasna sae bad as a that, said Old Alec judiciously.In fact, lad, ye were doin quiet weel wi him for a bit.I know I was, snapped Jamie, gritting his teeth as I pulled the bandage tight.A bee stung him.The bushy brows lifted.Oh, that was it?Beast acted like hed been struck wi an elf dart, he confided to me.Went straight up in the air on all fours, and came down again, then went stark, staring madall over the pen like a bumble bee in a jar.Yon wee laddie stuck on too, he said, nodding at Jamie, who invented a new unpleasant expression in response, until the big yellow fiend went ower the fence.Over the fence?Where is he now?I asked, standing up and dusting my hands.Halfway back to hell, I expect, said Jamie, putting his foot down and trying his weight gingerly on it.And welcome to stay there.Wincing, he sat back.I doubt the deils got much use for a half broke stallion, observed Alec.Bein able to turn himself into a horse when needed.Perhaps thats who Donas really is, I suggested, amused.I wouldna doubt it, said Jamie, still smarting, but beginning to recover his usual good humor.The deils customarily a black stallion, though, is he no?Oh, aye, said Alec.A great black stallion, that travels as fast as the thought between a man and a maid.He grinned genially at Jamie and rose to go.And speakin of that, he said, with a wink at me, Ill no expect ye in the stables tomorrow.Keep to your bed, laddie, and, errest.Why is it, I demanded, looking after the crusty old horsemaster, that everyone seems to assume weve no more on our minds than to get into bed with each other?Jamie tried his weight on the foot again, bracing himself on the counter.For one thing, weve been married less than a month, he observed.For another He looked up and grinned, shaking his head.Ive told ye before, Sassenach.Everything ye think shows on your face.Bloody hell, I said.* * *    Aside from a quick trip to the dispensary to check for emergencies, I spent the next morning ministering to the rather demanding needs of my solitary patient.You are supposed to be resting, I said reprovingly, at one point.I am.Well, my ankle is resting, at least.See?A long, unstockinged shin thrust up into the air, and a bony, slender foot waggled back and forth.It stopped abruptly in mid waggle with a muffled ouch from its owner.He lowered it and tenderly massaged the still puffy ankle.Thatll teach you, I said, swinging my own legs out from under the blankets.Come along now.Youve been frowsting in bed quite long enough.You need fresh air.He sat up, hair falling over his face.I thought ye said it was rest I needed.You can rest in the fresh air.Get up.Im making up the bed.Amid complaints about my general unfeelingness and lack of consideration for a gravely injured man, he got dressed and sat long enough for me to bind up the weak ankle before his natural exuberance asserted itself.Its a bit saft out, he said, with a glance through the casement, where the mild drizzle had just decided to buckle down to it and become a major downpour.Lets go up to the roof.The roof?Oh, to be sure.I couldnt think of a better prescription for a strained ankle than climbing six flights of stairs.Five.Besides, Ive a stick.He produced the stick in question, an aged hawthorn club, from behind the door with a triumphant flourish.Wherever did you get that?I inquired, examining it.At closer range, it was even more battered, a three foot length of chipped hardwood, age hardened as a diamond.Alec lent it me.He uses it on the mules; raps them twixt the eyes wi it to make them pay attention.Sounds very effective, I said, eyeing the scuffed wood.I must try it sometime.On you.We emerged at last in a small sheltered spot, just under the overhang of the slate roof.A low parapet guarded the edge of this small lookout.Oh, its beautiful!Despite the gusty rain, the view from the roof was magnificent; we could see the broad silver sweep of the loch and the towering crags beyond, thrusting into the solid grey of the sky like ridged black fists.Jamie leaned on the parapet, taking the weight from his injured foot.Aye, it is.I used to come up here sometimes, when I was at the Castle before.He pointed across the loch, dimpling under the beat of the rain.Dye see the notch there, between those two craigs?In the mountains?Yes.Thats the way to Lallybroch.When Id feel lonely for my home, sometimes Id come up here and look that way.Id imagine flying like a corbie across that pass, and the look of the hills and the fields, falling down the other side of the mountain, and the manor house at the end of the valley.I touched him gently on the arm.Do you want to go back, Jamie?He turned his head and smiled down at me.Well, Ive been thinking of it.I dont know if I want to, precisely, but I think we must.I canna say what well find there, Sassenach.Butaye.Im wed now.Youre lady of Broch Tuarach.Outlaw or no, I need to go back, even if just long enough to set things straight.I felt a thrill, compounded of relief and apprehension, at the thought of leaving Leoch and its assorted intrigues.When will we go?He frowned, drumming his fingers on the parapet.The stone was dark and slick with rain.Well, I think we must wait for the Duke to come.Its possible that he might see his way to doing Colum a favor by taking up my case.If he cannot get me cleared, he might be able to arrange a pardon.Thered be a good deal less danger in going back to Lallybroch, then, ye see.Well, yes, but He glanced sharply at me as I hesitated.What is it, Sassenach?I took a deep breath.Jamieif I tell you something will you promise not to ask me how I know?He took me by both arms, looking down into my face.The rain misted his hair and small droplets ran down the sides of his face.He smiled at me.I told you that I wouldna ask for anything that ye dinna wish to tell me.Yes, I promise.Lets sit down.You shouldnt be standing on that foot so long.We made our way to the wall where the overhanging slates of the roof sheltered a small dry patch of pavement, and settled ourselves comfortably, backs against the wall.All right, Sassenach.What is it?Jamie asked.The Duke of Sandringham, I said.I bit my lip.Jamie, dont trust him.I dont know everything about him myself, but I do knowtheres something about him.Something wrong.You know about that?He looked surprised.Now it was my turn to stare.You mean you know about him already?Have you met him?I was relieved.Perhaps the mysterious links between Sandringham and the Jacobite cause were much better known than Frank and the vicar had thought.Oh, aye.He was here, visiting, when I was sixteen.When Ileft.Why did you leave?I was curious, remembering suddenly what Geillis Duncan had said when first Id met her in the wood.The odd rumor that Jamie was the real father of Colums son Hamish.I knew myself that he wasnt, couldnt have beenbut I was quite possibly the only person in the Castle who did know.A suspicion of that sort could easily have led to Dougals earlier attempt on Jamies lifeif in fact thats what the attack at Carryarick had been.It wasnt because ofthe lady Letitia, was it?I asked with some hesitation.Letitia?His startled astonishment was plain, and something inside me that I hadnt known was clenched suddenly relaxed.I hadnt really thought there was anything to Geilies supposition, but still.What on earth makes ye mention Letitia?Jamie asked curiously.I lived at the Castle for a year, and had speech of her maybe once that I remember, when she called me to her chamber and gave me the raw side of her tongue for leading a game of shinty through her rose garden.I told him what Geilie had said, and he laughed, breath misting in the cool, rainy air.God, he said, as though Id have the nerve!You dont think Colum suspected any such thing, do you?I asked.He shook his head decidedly.No, I dont, Sassenach.If he had any inkling of such a thing, I wouldna have lived to be seventeen, let alone achieve the ripe old age of three and twenty.This more or less confirmed my own impression of Colum, but I was relieved, nonetheless.Jamies expression had grown thoughtful, blue eyes suddenly remote.Come to think on it, though, I dont know that Colum does know why I left the Castle so sudden, then.And if Geillis Duncan is goin about the place spreading such rumorsthat womans a troublemaker, Sassenach; a gossip and a scold, if not the witch folk say she iswell, Id best see that he finds out, then.He glanced up at the sheet of water pouring from the eaves.Perhaps wed best go down, Sassenach.Its getting a wee bit damp out.We took a different way down, crossing the roof to an outer stairway that led down to the kitchen gardens, where I wanted to pull a bit of borage, if the downpour would let me.We sheltered under the wall of the Castle, one of the jutting window ledges diverting the rain above.What do ye do wi borage, Sassenach?Jamie asked with interest, looking out at the straggly vines and plants, beaten to the earth by the rain.When its green, nothing.First you dry it, and then  I was interrupted by a terrific noise of barking and shouting, coming from outside the garden wall.I raced through the downpour toward the wall, followed more slowly by Jamie, limping.Father Bain, the village priest, was running up the path, puddles exploding under his feet, pursued by a yelping pack of dogs.Hampered by his voluminous soutane, the priest tripped and fell, water and mud flying in spatters all around him.In a moment, the dogs were upon him, growling and snapping.A blur of plaid vaulted over the wall next to me, and Jamie was among them, laying about with his stick and shouting in Gaelic, adding his voice to the general racket.If the shouts and curses had little effect, the stick had more.There were sharp yelps as the club struck hairy flesh, and gradually the pack retreated, finally turning and galloping off in the direction of the village.Jamie wiped the hair out of his eyes, panting.Bad as wolves, he said.Id told Colum about that pack already; theyre the ones that chased Cobhar into the loch two days ago.Best he has them shot before they kill someone.He looked down at me as I knelt next to the fallen priest, inspecting.The rain dripped from the ends of my hair, and I could feel my shawl growing sodden.They havent yet, I said.Bar a few toothmarks, hes basically all right.Father Bains soutane was ripped down one side, showing an expanse of hairless white thigh with an ugly gash and several puncture marks beginning to ooze blood.The priest, pasty white with shock, was struggling to his feet; plainly he wasnt too badly injured.If youll come to the surgery with me, Father, Ill cleanse those cuts for you, I offered, suppressing a smile at the spectacle the fat little priest presented, soutane flapping and argyle socks revealed.At the best of times, Father Bains face resembled a clenched fist.This similarity was made more pronounced at the moment by the red mottling that streaked his jowls and emphasized the vertical creases between cheeks and mouth.He glared at me as though I had suggested that he commit some public indecency.Apparently I had, for his next words were What, a man o God to expose his pairsonal parts to the handling of a wumman?Weel, Ill tell ye, madam, Ive no notion what sorts of immorality are practiced in the circles youre accustomed to move in, but Ill have ye to ken that suchll no be tolerated herenot sae long as Ive the cure of the souls in this parish!With that, he turned and stumped off, limping rather badly and trying unsuccessfully to hold up the torn side of his robe.Suit yourself, I called after him.If you dont let me cleanse it, it will fester!The priest did not respond, but hunched his round shoulders and hitched his way up the garden stair a step at a time, like a penguin hopping up an ice floe.That man doesnt care overmuch for women, does he?I remarked to Jamie.Considering his occupation, I imagine thats as well, he replied.Lets go and eat.* * *    After lunch, I sent my patient back to bed to restalone, this time, in spite of his protestationsand went down to the surgery.The heavy rain seemed to have made business slack; people tended to stay safely inside, rather than running over their feet with ploughshares or falling off roofs.I passed the time pleasantly enough, bringing the records in Davie Beatons book up to date.Just as I finished, though, a visitor darkened my door.He literally darkened it, his bulk filling it from side to side.Squinting in the semidarkness, I made out the form of Alec MacMahon, swathed in an extraordinary get up of coats, shawls, and odd bits of horse blanket.He advanced with a slowness that reminded me of Colums first visit to the surgery with me, and gave me a clue to his problem.Rheumatism, is it?I asked with sympathy, as he subsided stiffly into my single chair with a stifled groan.Aye.The damp settles in my bones, he said.Aught to be done about it?He laid his huge, gnarled hands on the table, letting the fingers relax.The hands opened slowly, like a night blooming flower, to show the callused palms within.I picked up one of the knotted appendages and turned it gently to and fro, stretching the fingers and massaging the horny palm.The seamed old face above the hand contorted for a moment as I did it, but then relaxed as the first twinges passed.Like wood, I said.A good slug of whisky and a deep massage is the best I can recommend.Tansy tea will do only so much.He laughed, shawls slipping off his shoulder.Whisky, eh?I had my doubts, lassie, but I see yeve the makings of a fine physician.I reached into the back of my medicine cupboard and pulled out the anonymous brown bottle that held my supply from the Leoch distillery.I plunked it on the table before him, with a horn cup.Drink up, I said, then get stripped off as far as you think decent and lie on the table.Ill make up the fire so it will be warm enough.The blue eye surveyed the bottle with appreciation, and a crooked hand reached slowly for the neck.Best have a nip yourself, lassie, he advised.Itll be a big job.He groaned, with a cross between pain and contentment, as I leaned hard on his left shoulder to loosen it, then lifted from underneath and rotated the whole quarter of his body.My wife used to iron my back for me, he remarked, for the lumbago.But this is even better.Yeve a good strong pair of hands, lassie.Make a good stable lad, ye would.Ill assume thats a compliment, I said dryly, pouring more of the heated oil and tallow mixture into my palm and spreading it over the broad white expanse of his back.There was a sharp line of demarcation between the weathered, mottled brown skin of his arms, where the rolled up sleeves of his shirt stopped, and the milk white skin of his shoulders and back.Well, you were a fine, fair laddie at one time, I remarked.The skin of your backs as white as mine.A deep chuckle shook the flesh under my hands.Never know now, would ye?Aye, Ellen MacKenzie once saw me wi my sark off, birthin a foal, and told me it looked like the good Lord had put the wrong head to my bodyshould have had a bag of milk pudding on my shoulders, instead of a face from the altar piece.I gathered he was referring to the rood screen in the chapel, which featured a number of extremely unattractive demons, engaged in torturing sinners.Ellen MacKenzie sounds as though she were rather free with her opinions, I observed.I was more than slightly curious about Jamies mother.From the small things he said now and then, I had some picture of his father Brian, but he had never mentioned his mother, and I knew nothing about her, other than that she had died young, in childbed.Oh, she had a tongue on her, did Ellen, and a mind of her own to go wi it.Untying the garters of his trews, I tucked them up out of the way and began operations on the muscular calves of his legs.But enough sweetness with it that no one minded much, other than her brothers.And she wasna one to pay much heed to Colum or Dougal.Mm.So I heard.Eloped, didnt she?I dug my thumbs into the tendons behind his knee, and he let out a sound that would have been a squeak in anyone less dignified.Oh, aye.Ellen was the eldest o the six MacKenzie bairnsa year or two older than Colum, and the apple of auld Jacobs eye.Thats why shed gone so long unwed; wouldna ha aught to do wi John Cameron or Malcolm Grant, or any of the others she might have gone to, and her father wouldna force her against her will.When old Jacob died, though, Colum had less patience with his sisters foibles.Struggling desperately to consolidate his shaky hold on the clan, he had sought an alliance with Munro to the north, or Grant to the south.Both clans had young chieftains, who would make useful brothers in law.Young Jocasta, only fifteen, had obligingly accepted the suit of John Cameron, and gone north.Ellen, on the verge of spinsterhood at twenty two, had been a good deal less cooperative.I take it Malcolm Grants suit was rather firmly rejected, judging from his behavior two weeks ago, I observed.Old Alec laughed, the laugh turning to a satisfied groan as I pressed deeper.Aye.I never heard exactly what she said to him, but I expect it stung.It was at the big Gathering, ye ken, that they met.Out in the rose garden they went, in the evening, and everyone waiting to see would she tak him or no.And it grew dark, and they still waiting.And darker still, and the lanterns all lit, and the singing begun, and no sign yet of Ellen or Malcolm Grant.Goodness.It must have been quite a conversation.I poured another dollop of the liniment between his shoulder blades, and he grunted with the warm pleasure of it.So it seemed.But time went on, and they didna come back, and Colum began to fear as Grant had eloped wi her; taken her by force, ye see.And it seemed as that must be the way of it, for they found the rose garden empty.And when he sent down to the stables for me, sure enoughI told him Grants men had come for the horses, and the whole boiling of em gone awa without a word of farewell.Furious, eighteen year old Dougal had mounted his horse at once and set out on the track of Malcolm Grant, not waiting either for company nor for conference with Colum.When Colum heard as Dougal had gone after Grant, he sent me and some others helter skelter after him, Colum being well acquent wi Dougals temper and not wishing to have his new brother in law slain in the road before the banns were called.For he reckoned as how Malcolm Grant, not being able to talk Ellen into wedding him, must ha taken her away in order to have his way wi her and force her into marriage that way.Alec paused meditatively.All Dougal could see was the insult, of course.But I dinna think Colum was that upset about it, to tell the truth, insult or no.It would ha solved his problemand Grant would likely have had to take Ellen wiout her dower and pay reparation to Colum as well.Alec snorted cynically.Colum is no the man to let an opportunity pass by him.Hes quick, and hes ruthless, is Colum.The single ice blue eye swiveled back to regard me over one humped shoulder.Yed be wise to bear that in mind, lassie.Im not likely to forget it, I assured him, with some grimness.I remembered Jamies story of his punishment at Colums order, and wondered how much of that had been in revenge for his mothers rebellion.Still, Colum had had no chance to seize the opportunity of marrying his sister to the laird of clan Grant.Toward dawn, Dougal had found Malcolm Grant camped along the main road with his followers, asleep under a gorse bush, wrapped in his plaid.And when Alec and the others had come pelting along the road sometime later, they had been stopped in their tracks by the sight of Dougal MacKenzie and Malcolm Grant, both stripped to the waist and scarred with the marks of battle, swaying and staggering up and down the roadway, still exchanging random blows whenever they got within reach of each other.Grants retainers were perched along the roadway like a row of owls, heads turning one way and then the other, as the waning fight meandered up and down in the dripping dawn.They were both of them puffing like blown horses, and the steam rising off their bodies in the chill.Grants nose was swelled to twice its size, and Dougal could scarce see out o either eye, and both wi their blood dripping down and dried ower their breasts.Upon the appearance of Colums men, Grants tacksmen had all sprung to their feet, hands upon their swords, and the meeting would likely have resulted in serious bloodshed, had some sharp eyed lad among the MacKenzies not noted the rather important fact that Ellen MacKenzie was nowhere to be seen among the Grants.Weel, after theyd poured water on Malcolm Grant and brought him to his senses, he managed to tell them what Dougal wouldna pause to hearthat Ellen had spent but a quarter hour wi him in the rose garden.He wouldna say what had passed between them, but whatever it was, hed been so offended as to wish to take his leave at once, without showing his face in the Hall.And hed left her there, and seen her no more, nor did he wish ever to hear the name of Ellen MacKenzie spoken in his presence again.And wi that, he mounted his horsea bit unsteady, stilland rode awa.And been no friend since, to anyone of the clan MacKenzie.I listened, fascinated.And where was Ellen all this time?Old Alec laughed, with the sound of a stable door hinge creaking.Ower the hills and far away.But they didna find it out for some time yet.We turned about and pelted home again, to find Ellen still missing and Colum standing white faced in the courtyard, leanin on Angus Mhor.There followed more confusion still, for with all the guests, the rooms of the Castle were full, as were all the lofts and cubbyholes, the kitchens and closets.It seemed hopeless to tell which of all the folk in the Castle might also be missing, but Colum called all of the servants, and went doggedly down the lists of the invited, asking who had been seen the evening before, and where, and when.And finally he found a kitchen maid who recalled seeing a man in a back passage, just before the supper was served.She had noticed him only because he was so handsome; tall and sturdy, she said, with hair like a black silkies and eyes like a cat.She had watched him down the passage, admiring him, and seen him meet someone at the outer doora woman dressed in black from head to toe, and shrouded in a hooded cloak.Whats a silkie?I asked.Alecs eye slanted toward me, crinkling at the corners.Ye call them seals in English.For quite a bit after that, even after they knew the truth of it, folk in the village would tell the tale to each other that Ellen MacKenzie was taken to the sea, to live among the seals.Did ye know that the silkies put aside their skins when they come ashore, and walk like men?And if ye find a silkies skin and hide it, heor she he added, fairly, canna go into the sea again, but must stay with ye on the land.Its thought good to take a seal wife that way, for theyre very good cooks, and most devoted mothers.Still, he said judiciously, Colum wasna inclined to believe his sisterd gone off wi a seal, and said so.So he called the guests down, one by one, and asked them all who knew a man of that description.And at long last, they worked it out that his name was Brian, but no one knew his clan or his surname; hed been at the Games, but there they only called him Brian Dhu.So there the matter seemed to rest for a time, for the searchers had no idea in which direction to look.Still, even the best of hunters must stop at a cottage now and then, to ask for a handful of salt or a pannikin of milk.And eventually word of the pair reached Leoch, for Ellen MacKenzie was a maid of no ordinary appearance.Hair like fire, Alec said dreamily, enjoying the warmth of the oil on his back.And eyes like Columsgrey, and fringed wi black lashesverra pretty, but the kind would go through ye like a bolt.A tall woman; even taller than you.And sae fair it would hurt the eyes to see her.I heard tell later as theyd met at the Gathering, taken one look and decided on the spot as there could be none other for either one o them.So they laid their plans and they stole awa, under the noses of Colum MacKenzie and three hundred guests.He laughed suddenly, remembering.Dougal finally found them, living in a crofters cottage on the edge of the Fraser lands.Theyd decided the only way to manage was to hide until Ellen was wi child, and big enough that thered be no question whose it was.Then Colum would have to give his blessing to the marriage, like it or noand he didnt.Alec grinned.Whiles ye were on the road, did ye chance to see a scar Dougal carries, running down his breast?I had; a thin white line that crossed his heart and ran from shoulder to ribs.Did Brian do that?I asked.No, Ellen, he replied, grinning at my expression.To stop him cutting Brians throat, which he was about to do.I wouldna mention it to Dougal, if I were you.No, I dont suppose I will.Luckily, the plan had worked, and Ellen was five months gone with child by the time that Dougal found them.There was the great to do about it all, and a lot of verra nasty letters exchanged between Leoch and Beauly, but they settled it in the end, and Ellen and Brian took up house at Lallybroch the week before the child was born.They were married in the dooryard, he added, as an afterthought, so he could carry her over the threshold for the first time as a wife.He said after as he nearly ruptured himself, lifting her.You talk as though you knew them well, I said.Finishing my ministrations, I wiped the slippery ointment off my hands with a towel.Oh, a bit, Alec said, drowsy with warmth.The lid drooped over his single eye, and the lines of his old face had relaxed from the expression of mild discomfort that normally made him look so fierce.I kent Ellen weel, of course.Then Brian I met years later, when he brought the lad to staywe got on.A good man wi a horse.His voice trailed off, and the lid fell shut.I drew a blanket up over the old mans prostrate form, and tiptoed away, leaving him dreaming by the fire.* * *    Leaving Alec asleep, I had gone up to our chamber, only to find Jamie in the same condition.There are a limited number of activities suitable for indoor amusement on a dark, rainy day, and assuming that I didnt wish either to rouse Jamie or to join him in oblivion, that seemed to leave reading or needlework.Given the worse than mediocre state of my abilities in the latter direction, I had decided to borrow a book from Colums library.In accordance with the peculiar architectural principles governing the construction of Leochbased on a general abhorrence of straight linesthe stair leading to Colums suite had two right angle bends in it, each marked by a small landing.An attendant usually stood on the second landing, ready to run errands or lend assistance to the laird, but he wasnt at his station today.I could hear the rumble of voices from above; perhaps the attendant was with Colum.I paused outside the door, uncertain whether to interrupt.Ive always known ye to be a fool, Dougal, but I didna think ye quite such an idiot.Accustomed to the company of tutors since youth, and unused to venturing out as his brother did among fighting men and common people, Colums voice normally lacked the broad Scots that marked Dougals speech.The cultured accent had slipped a bit now, though, and the two voices were nearly indistinguishable, both thickened by anger.I might have expected such behavior from ye when ye were in your twenties, but for Gods sake, man, youre five and forty!Well, it isna a matter youd know owermuch about, now, is it?Dougals voice held an ugly sneer.No.Colums response came in a cutting tone.And while Ive seldom found cause to thank the Lord, perhaps hes done better by me than Ive thought.Ive heard it said often enough that a mans brain stops workin when his cocks standin, and now I think maybe I believe it.There was a loud scrape as chairlegs were pushed back across the stone flooring.If the brothers MacKenzie have but one cock and one brain between the two of them, then Im glad of my half of the bargain!I decided that a third participant in this particular conversation would be decidedly unwelcome, and stepped softly back from the door, turning to go down the stair.The sound of rustling skirts from the first landing made me stop in my tracks.I didnt wish to be discovered eavesdropping outside the lairds study, and turned back toward the door.The landing here was wide, and a tapestry covered one wall almost from floor to ceiling.My feet would show, but it couldnt be helped.Lurking like a rat behind the arras, I heard the steps from below slow as they approached the door, and stop at the far side of the landing, as the unseen visitor realized, as I had, the private nature of the brothers conversation.No, Colum was saying, calmer now.No, of course not.The womans a witch, or next thing to it.Aye, but Dougals response was cut short by his brothers impatient tones.Ive said Ill attend to it, man.Dont worry yourself over it, little brother; Ill see shes done rightly by.A note of grudging affection had crept into Colums voice.Ill tell ye, man.Ive written the Duke as he may have leave to hunt the lands above Erlickhes keen to have a shot at the stags there.I mean to send Jamie along wi him; may be as he still has some feeling for the lad  Dougal interrupted with something in Gaelic, evidently a coarse, remark, for Colum laughed and said, Nay, I reckon Jamies big enough to have a care for himself.But if the Dukes a mind to intercede for him with His Royal Majesty, its the lads best chance for a pardon.If ye will, Ill tell His Grace youll go as well.You can aid Jamie as ye may, and youll be out of the way while I settle matters here.There was a muffled thump from the far side of the landing, and I risked peeping out.It was the girl Laoghaire, pale as the plastered wall behind her.She was holding a tray with a decanter; a pewter cup had fallen from the tray to the carpeted floor, making the sound I had heard.Whats that?Colums voice, suddenly sharp, spoke from inside the study.Laoghaire dropped the tray on the table next to the door, almost upsetting the decanter in her haste, and turning, fled precipitately.I could hear Dougals footsteps approaching the door, and knew I would never make it down the stairs without discovery.I barely had time to wriggle out of my hiding place and pick up the fallen cup, before the door opened.Oh, its you.Dougal sounded mildly surprised.Is that the stuff Mrs.Fitz sent for Colums raw throat?Yes, I said glibly.She says she hopes hell be better presently.Ill do.Moving more slowly, Colum came into view in the open door.He smiled at me.Thank Mrs.Fitz for me.And my thanks to you, my dear, for bringing it.Will ye sit a moment while I drink it?The conversation I had overheard had effectually made me forget my original purpose, but I now remembered my intention of borrowing a book.Dougal excused himself, and I followed Colum slowly into his library, where he offered me the run of his shelves.Colums color was still high, the quarrel with his brother still fresh in his mind, but he answered my questions about the books with a good approximation of his usual poise.Only the brightness of his eyes and a certain tenseness of posture betrayed his thoughts.I found one or two herbals that looked interesting and put them aside while I browsed a novel.Colum crossed to the birds cage, no doubt intending to soothe himself as per his usual custom by watching the beautiful little self absorbed creatures hop about amongst the branches, each a world unto itself.The sound of shouts from outside attracted my attention.From this high point, the fields behind the castle were visible, all the way to the loch.A small group of horsemen was sweeping around the end of the loch, shouting with exhilaration, as the rain pelted them on.As they drew nearer, I could see that they werent men after all, but boys, mostly teenagers, but with a younger lad here and there on a pony, pressing hard to stay up with the older youths.I wondered if Hamish was with them, and quickly found the telltale spot of bright hair, gleaming wildly from Cobhars back in the middle of the pack.The gang came charging toward the castle, headed for one of the innumerable stone walls that separated one field from another.One, two, three, four, the older boys on their mounts popped over the wall with the careless ease born of experience.It was doubtless my imagination that made the bay seem to hang back a moment, for Cobhar followed the other horses with apparent eagerness.He charged the fence, set himself, braced and leaped.He seemed to do it just as the others had, and yet something happened.Perhaps a hesitation by his rider, a too hard pulling on the reins, or a not quite firm seat.For the front hooves struck the wall just a few inches too low, and horse, rider and all, somersaulted over the wall in the most spectacular parabola of doom I had ever seen.Oh!Drawn by my exclamation, Colum turned his head to the window in time to see Cobhar land heavily on his side, the small figure of Hamish pinned beneath.Crippled as he was, Colum moved with speed.He was by my side, leaning out of the window, before the horse had even begun to struggle to his feet.The wind and rain beat in, soaking the velvet of Colums coat.Peering anxiously over his shoulder, I saw a cluster of lads, pushing and shoving each other in their eagerness to help.It seemed a long time before the crowd parted, and we saw the small, sturdy figure stumble out of the press, clutching his stomach.He shook his head to the many offers of help, and staggered purposefully to the wall, where he leaned over and vomited profusely.Then he slid down the wall and sat in the wet grass, legs sprawled, face upturned to the rain.When I saw him stick out his tongue to catch the falling drops, I laid a hand on Colums shoulder.Hes all right, I said.Only had the wind knocked out of him.Colum closed his eyes and let his breath out, body sagging suddenly with the release of tension.I watched him with sympathy.You care for him as though he were your own, dont you?I asked.The grey eyes blazed suddenly into mine with the most extraordinary expression of alarm.For an instant, there was no sound in the study but the ticking of the glass clock on the shelf.Then a drop of water rolled down Colums nose, to hang glimmering from the tip.I reached involuntarily to blot it with my handkerchief, and the tension in his face broke.Yes, he said simply.* * *    In the end I told Jamie only about Colums plan to send him hunting with the Duke.I was convinced by now that his feelings for Laoghaire were only those of a chivalrous friendship, but I didnt know what he might do if he knew that his uncle had seduced the girl and got her with child.Apparently Colum didnt mean to procure the services of Geilie Duncan in the emergency; I wondered if the girl would be wed to Dougal, or if Colum would find her another husband before the child began to show.In any case, if Jamie and Dougal were going to be shut up together in a hunting lodge for days on end, I thought it might be as well if the shade of Laoghaire were not one of the party.Hm, he said thoughtfully.Worth a try.Ye get verra friendly wi each other, hunting all day and coming back to drink whisky by the fire.He finished fastening my gown up the back and bent to kiss my shoulder briefly.Id be sorry to leave ye, Sassenach, but it might be best.Dont mind for me, I said.I hadnt realized before that his departure would necessarily leave me alone at the Castle, and the thought made me more than slightly nervous.Still, I was resolved to manage, if it might help him.Are you ready for supper?I asked.His hand lingered on my waist, and I turned toward him.Mmm, he said a moment later.Id be willing to go hungry.Well, I wouldnt, I said.Youll just have to wait.* * *    I glanced down the dinnertable and across the room.By now I knew most of the faces, some intimately.And a motley crew they were, I reflected.Frank would have been fascinated by the gatheringso many different facial types.Thinking about Frank was rather like touching a sore tooth; my inclination was to shy away.But the time was coming when I would be able to delay no longer, and I forced my mind back, carefully drawing him in my mind, tracing the long, smooth arcs of his brows with my thoughts as I had once traced them with my fingers.No matter that my fingers tingled suddenly with the memory of rougher, thicker brows, and the deep blue of the eyes beneath them.I hastily turned toward the nearest face, as an antidote to such disturbing thoughts.It happened to be Murtaghs.Well, at least he looked like neither of the men who haunted my thoughts.Short, slightly built but sinewy as a gibbon, with long arms that reinforced the simian resemblance, he had a low brow and narrow jaw that for some reason made me think of cave dwellers and pictures of Early Man shown in some of Franks texts.Not a Neanderthal, though.A Pict.That was it.There was something very durable about the small clansman that reminded me of the weathered, patterned stones, ancient even now, that stood their implacable guard over crossroads and burial grounds.Amused at the idea, I looked over the other diners with an eye to spotting ethnic types.That man near the hearth, for example, John Cameron, his name was, was a Norman if Id ever seen onenot that I hadhigh cheekbones and a high, narrow brow, long upper lip, and the dark skin of a Gaul.The odd fair Saxon here and thereah, Laoghaire, the perfect exemplar.Pale skinned, blue eyed, and just the tiniest bit plumpI repressed the uncharitable observation.She carefully avoided looking at either me or Jamie, chattering animatedly with her friends at one of the lower tables.I looked in the opposite direction, toward the next table, where Dougal MacKenzie sat, apart from Colum for once.A bloody Viking, that one.With his impressive height and those broad, flat cheekbones, I could easily imagine him in command of a dragon ship, deepsunk eyes gleaming with avarice and lust as he peered through the fog at some rocky coastal village.A large hand, wrist lightly haired with copper, reached past me to take a small loaf of oat bread from the tray.Another Norseman, Jamie.He reminded me of Mrs.Bairds legends of the race of giants who once walked Scotland and laid their long bones in the earth of the north.The conversation was general, as it usually was, small groups buzzing between mouthfuls.But my ears suddenly caught a familiar name, spoken at a nearby table.Sandringham.I thought the voice was Murtaghs, and turned around to see.He was seated next to Ned Gowan, munching industriously.Sandringham?Ah, old Willie the arse bandit, said Ned, meditatively.What?!said one of the younger men at arms, choking on his ale.Our revered duke has something of a taste for boys, or so I understand, Ned explained.Mmm, agreed Rupert, his mouth full.Swallowing, he added, Had a wee bit of a taste for young Jamie here, last time he visited these parts, if I remember rightly.That were when, Dougal?Thirty eight?Thirty nine?Thirty seven, Dougal answered from the next table.He narrowed his eyes at his nephew.Ye were rather a pretty lad at sixteen, Jamie.Jamie nodded, chewing.Aye.Fast, too.When the laughter had died down, Dougal began to tease Jamie.I didna ken ye were a favorite, Jamie, lad.Theres several about the Duke as ha traded a sore arse for lands and offices.Yell notice I havena got either one, responded Jamie with a grin, to further roars of laughter.What?Never even got close?said Rupert, chewing noisily.A good bit closer than I would have liked, truth be known.Ah, but how close would ye ha liked it, hey, lad?The shout came from further down the table, from a tall, brown bearded man I didnt recognize, and was greeted with more laughter and ribald remarks.Jamie smiled tranquilly and reached for another loaf, undisturbed by the teasing.Is that why ye left the Castle so sudden and went back to your father?asked Rupert.Aye.Why, ye should ha told me ye were having trouble that way, Jamie, lad, said Dougal, with mock concern.Jamie made a low Scottish noise in his throat.And if Id told ye about it, you old rogue, ye would have slipped a bit of poppy juice in my ale some evening, and left me in His Graces bed as a wee gift.The table roared, and Jamie dodged as Dougal hurled an onion at him.Rupert squinted across at Jamie.Seems to me, lad, I saw ye, soon before ye left, goin into the Dukes chambers near nightfall.Yere sure yere not holdin back on us?Jamie grabbed another onion and threw it at him.It missed and rolled away into the rushes.Nay, Jamie said, laughing, Im a maiden stillthat way, at least.But if ye must know all about it before you can sleep, Rupert, Ill tell ye, and welcome.Amid shouts of Tell!Tell!he deliberately poured a mug of ale and sat back in the classic storytellers posture.I could see Colum at the head table, head cocked forward to hear, as attentive as the ostlers and fighting men at our table.Well, he began, its true enough what Ned says; His Grace had something of an eye for me, though being the innocent I was at sixteen Here he was interrupted by a number of cynical remarks, and raised his voice to go on.Bein, as I say, innocent of such carryings on, Id no idea what he meant, though it seemed a bit strange to me, the way His Grace was always wanting to pat me like a wee dog and was so interested in what I might ha in my sporran.(Or under it!shouted a drunken voice. )I thought it stranger still, he went on, when he found me washing myself at the river and wanted to wash my back for me.When he finished my back and went on wi the rest, I began to get a wee bit nervous, and when he put his hand under my kilts, I began to get the general idea.I may have been an innocent, but no a complete fool, ye ken.I got out of that particular situation by diving into the water, kilts and all, and swimming across to the other side; His Grace being not of a mind to risk his costly clothes in the mud and water.Anyway, after that I was verra wary of being alone with him.He caught me once or twice in the garden or the courtyard, but there was room to get away, wi no more harm than him kissing my ear.The only other bad time was when he came on me alone in the stables.In my stables?Old Alec looked aghast.He half rose to his feet and called across the room to the head table.Colum, yell see that man stays oot o my sheds!Ill not have him frightening my horses, duke or no!Or troubling the boys, neither!he added, as an obvious afterthought.Jamie went on with his story, unperturbed by the interruption.Dougals two teenaged daughters were listening raptly, mouths slightly agape.I was in a horsebox, ye ken, and there wasna room to maneuver much.I was bendin over [more ribald remarks]bendin over the manger, I say, muckin up husks from the bottom, when I hear a sound behind me, and before I can straighten up, my kilts are tossed up round my waist, and theres something hard pressed against my arse.He waved a hand to still the tumult before going on.Weel, I didna care much for the thought of being buggered in a horsebox, but I didna see much way out at that point, either.I was just gritting my teeth and hoping it wouldnt hurt too much, when the horseit was that big black gelding, Ned, the one ye got at Brockleburyyou know, the one Colum sold to Breadalbinanyway, the horse took an objection to the noise His Grace was making.Now, most horses like ye to talk to them, and so did that one, but he had a peculiar aversion to verra high voices; I couldna take him in the yard when there were small bairns about, because hed get nervous at their squeaks, and start pawing and stamping.His Grace, ye might recall, has a rather high pitched voice, and it was a bit higher than usual on this occasion, him bein a trifle excited.Weel, as I say, the horse didna care for itnor did I, I must sayand he starts stamping, and snorting, and swings his body round and squashes His Grace flat against the side of the box.As soon as the Duke let go of me, I jumped into the manger and eased away round the other side of the horse, leavin His Grace to get out as best he might.Jamie paused for breath and a sip of ale.He had the attention of the whole room by this time, faces turned toward him, gleaming in the light of the torchres.Here and there might have been discerned a frown at these revelations concerning a most puissant noble of the English Crown, but the overriding reaction was an untrammeled delight in the scandal.I gathered that the Duke was not a particularly popular personage at Castle Leoch.Havin been so close, as ye might say, His Grace made up his mind as hed have me, come what might.So next day he tells The MacKenzie that his body servants fallen ill, and can he borrow me to help him wash and dress.Colum covered his face in mock dismay, to the amusement of the crowd.Jamie nodded to Rupert.Thats why ye saw me go to His Graces room in the evening.Under orders, ye might say.You could have told me, Jamie.Id not have made you go, Colum called, with a look of reproach.Jamie shrugged and grinned.I was prevented by my natural modesty, Uncle.Besides, I knew ye were trying to deal with the man; I thought it might impair your negotiations a bit if you were forced to tell His Grace to keep his hands off your nephews bum.Very thoughtful of you, Jamie, said Colum dryly.So you sacrificed yourself for my interests, did you?Jamie raised his mug in a mock toast.Your interests are always foremost in my mind, Uncle, he said, and I thought that in spite of the teasing tone, there was a sharp undercurrent of truth to this, one that Colum perceived as well as I.   He drained the mug and set it down.But, no, he said, wiping his mouth, in this case, I didna feel that family duty required quite that much of me.I went to the Dukes rooms, because you told me to, but that was all.And ye came out again wi yer arse hole unstretched?Rupert sounded skeptical.Jamie grinned.Aye, I did.Ye see, directly I heard about it, I went to Mrs.Fitz, and told her I was in desperate need of a dose of syrup of figs.When she gave it to me, I saw where she put the bottle, and I came back quiet a bit later, and drank the whole lot.The room rocked with laughter, including Mrs.Fitz, who turned so red in the face I thought she might have a seizure.She rose ceremoniously from her place, waddled round the table and cuffed Jamie good naturedly on the ear.So thats what became of my good physick, ye young wretch!Hands on her hips, she wagged her head, making the green ear bobbles wink like dragonflies.The best lot I ever made too!Oh, it was most effective, he assured her, laughing up at the massive dame.I should think so!When I think what that much physick must have done to your innards, lad, I hope it was worth it to ye.Ye canna have been much good to yourself for days after.He shook his head, still laughing.I wasnt, but then, I wasna much good for what His Grace had in mind, either.He did not seem to mind at all when I begged leave to remove myself from his presence.But I knew I couldna do it twice, so as soon as the cramps eased up, I got a horse from the stables and lit out.It took a long time to get home, since I had to stop every ten minutes or so, but I made it by supper next day.Dougal beckoned for a new jug of ale, which he passed down the board hand to hand to Jamie.Aye, your father sent word he thought perhaps youd learned enough of castle life for the present, he said, smiling ruefully.I thought there was a tone to his letter I did not quite understand at the time.Weel, I hope yeve laid up a new batch of fig syrup, Mrs.Fitz, Rupert interrupted, poking her familiarly in the ribs.His Grace is like to be here in a day or two.Or are ye counting on your new wife to guard ye this time, Jamie?He leered at me.From all accounts, ye may need to guard her.I hear the Dukes servant does not share His Graces preferences, though hes every bit as active.Jamie pushed back the bench and rose from the table, handing me out.He put an arm around my shoulders and smiled back at Rupert.Well, then, I suppose the two of us will just have to fight it out back to back.Ruperts eyes flew open in horrified dismay.Back to back!?he exclaimed.I knew wed forgot to tell ye something before your wedding, lad!No wonder youve not got her with child yet!Jamies hand tightened on my shoulder, turning me toward the archway, and we made our escape, pelted by a hail of laughter and bawdy advice.In the dark hall outside, Jamie leaned against the stones, doubled over.Unable to stand, I sank to the ground at his feet and giggled helplessly.You didnt tell him, did you?Jamie gasped at last.I shook my head.No, of course not.Still wheezing, I groped for his hand, and he hauled me upright.I collapsed against his chest.Let me see if Ive got it right, now.He cupped my face between his hands and pressed his forehead to mine, face so close that his eyes blurred into one large blue orb and his breath was warm on my chin.Face to face.Is that it?The fizz of laughter was dying down in my blood, replaced by something else just as potent.I touched my tongue against his lips, while my hands busied themselves lower down.Faces are not the essential parts.But youre learning.* * *    Next day, I was in my surgery, listening patiently to an elderly lady from the village, some relation to the soup cook, who was rather garrulously detailing her daughter in laws bout with the morbid sore throat which theoretically had something to do with her current complaint of quinsy, though I couldnt at the moment see the connection.A shadow fell across the doorway, interrupting the old ladys catalog of symptoms.I looked up, startled, to see Jamie rush in, followed by Old Alec, both men looking worried and excited.Jamie unceremoniously removed the makeshift tongue depressor I was holding and pulled me to my feet, clasping both hands between his own.What I began, but was interrupted by Alec, peering over Jamies shoulder at my hands, which Jamie was displaying to him.Aye, thats verra weel, but the arms, man?Has she the arm for it?Look.Jamie grasped one of my hands and stretched my arm out straight, measuring it along one of his.Weel, said Alec, examining it doubtfully, could do.Aye, it could.Would you care to tell me what you think youre doing?I inquired, but before I could finish, I was being hustled down the stairs between the two men, leaving my aged patient to gape after us in perplexity.A few moment later, I was dubiously eyeing the large, shiny, brown hindquarters of a horse, located some six inches from my face.The problem had been made clear on the way to the stables, Jamie explaining and Old Alec chiming in with remarks, imprecations, and interjections.Losgann, customarily a good foaler, and a prize member of Colums stable, was having trouble.This much I could see for myself; the mare lay on her side and periodically the shining flanks heaved and the enormous body seemed to shiver.Down on hands and knees at the rear of the horse, I could see the lips of the vagina gape slightly with each contraction, but nothing further happened; no sight of tiny hoof or delicate wet nose appeared at the opening.The foal, a late one, was evidently presenting side on or backward.Alec thought side on, Jamie thought backward, and they paused to argue about it for a moment, until I impatiently called the meeting to order to ask what they expected me to do about it, in either case.Jamie looked at me as though I were a bit simple.Turn the foal, of course, he said patiently.Bring the forelegs round so it can get out.Oh, is that all?I looked at the horse.Losgann, whose elegant name actually meant Frog, was delicately boned for a horse, but bloody big for all that.Er, reach inside, you mean?I glanced covertly at my hand.It probably would fitthe opening was big enoughbut what then?Both mens hands were clearly too big for the job.And Roderick, the stable lad who was usually pressed into service in such delicate situations, was, of course, immobilized with a splint and sling of my devising on his right armhe had broken his arm two days before.Willie, the other stable lad, had gone to fetch Roderick, nonetheless, to give advice and moral encouragement.At this juncture, he arrived, clad in nothing but a pair of ragged breeches, thin chest glimmering whitely in the dim stable.Its hard work, he said dubiously, apprised of the situation and the suggestion that I substitute for him.Tricky, ye ken.Theres a knack to it, but it takes a bit of strength as well.Nay worry, said Jamie confidently.Claires stronger by far than you, ye poor weed.If youll but tell her what to feel for and what to do, shell have it round in no time.I appreciated the vote of confidence, but was in no way so sanguine myself.Telling myself firmly that this was no worse than assisting at abdominal surgery, I retired to a stall to change my gown for breeches and a rough smock of sacking, and lathered my hand and arm up to the shoulder with greasy tallow soap.Well, over the top, I muttered under my breath, and slid my hand inside.There was very little room to maneuver, and at first I couldnt tell what I was feeling.I closed my eyes to concentrate better, though, and groped cautiously.There were smooth expanses, and bumpy bits.The smooth parts would be body and the bumps legs or head.It was legs I wantedforelegs, to be specific.Gradually I became accustomed to the feel of things, and the necessity for keeping quite still when a contraction came on; the amazingly powerful muscles of the uterus clamped down on my hand and arm like a vise, grinding my own bones very painfully until the constriction eased, and I could resume my groping.At last, my fumbling fingers encountered something I was sure of.Ive got my fingers in its nose!I cried triumphantly.Ive found the head!Good lass, good!Dinna let go!Alec crouched anxiously alongside, patting the mare reassuringly as another contraction set in.I gritted my teeth and leaned my forehead against the shining rump as my wrist was crushed by the force.It eased, though, and I kept my grip.Feeling cautiously upward, I found the curve of eyesocket and brow, and the small ridge of the folded ear.Waiting through one more contraction, I followed the curve of the neck down to the shoulder.Its got its head turned back on its shoulder, I reported.The heads pointing the right way, at least.Good.Jamie, at the horses head, ran his hand soothingly down the sweating chestnut neck.Likely the legs will be folded under the chest.See can you get a hand on one knee.So it went on, feeling, fumbling, up to my shoulder in the warm darkness of the horse, feeling the awful force of the birth pangs and their grateful easing, struggling blindly to reach my goal.I felt rather as though I were giving birth myself, and bloody hard work it was, too.At last I had my hand on a hoof; I could feel the rounded surface, and the sharp edge of the yet unused curve.Following the anxious, often contradictory instructions of my guides as best I could, I alternately pulled and pushed, easing the unwieldy mass of the foal around, bringing one foot forward, pushing another back, sweating and groaning along with the mare.And then suddenly everything worked.A contraction eased, and all at once, everything slid smoothly into place.I waited, not moving, for the next contraction.It came, and a small wet nose popped suddenly out, pushing my hand out with it.The tiny nostrils flared briefly, as though interested in this new sensation, then the nose vanished.Next one will do it!Alec was almost dancing in ecstasy, his arthritic form capering up and down in the hay.Come on, Losgann.Come on, my sweet wee froggie!As though in answer, there was a convulsive grunt from the mare.Her hindquarters flexed sharply and the foal slid smoothly onto the clean hay in a slither of knobbly legs and big ears.I sat back on the hay, grinning idiotically.I was covered with soap and slime and blood, exhausted and aching, and smelt strongly of the less pleasant aspects of horse.I was euphoric.I sat watching as Willy and the one handed Roderick tended the new arrival, wiping him down with wisps of straw.And cheered with the rest when Losgann turned and licked him, butting him gently and nosing him to stand at last on his huge, wobbly feet.A damn good job, lassie!Damn good!Alec was exuberant, pumping my unslimed hand in congratulation.Suddenly realizing that I was swaying on my perch, and much less than presentable, he turned and barked at one of the lads to bring some water.Then he circled behind me and set his horny old hands on my shoulders.With an amazingly deft and gentle touch, he pressed and stroked, easing the strain in my shoulders, relaxing the knots in my neck.There, lassie, he said at last.Hard work, no?He smiled down at me, then beamed adoringly at the new colt.Bonny laddie, he crooned.Whos a sweet lad, then?Jamie helped me to clean up and change.My fingers were too stiff to manage the buttons of my bodice, and I knew my entire arm would be blue with bruising by morning, but I felt thoroughly peaceful and contented.* * *    The rain seemed to have lasted forever, so that when a day finally dawned bright and fair, I squinted in the daylight like a newly emerged mole.Your skin is so fine I can see the blood moving beneath it, Jamie said, tracing the path of a sunbeam across my bare stomach.I could follow the veins from your hand to your heart.He drew his finger gently up my wrist to the bend of the elbow, up the inner side of my upper arm, and across the slope below my collarbone.Thats the subclavian vein, I remarked, looking down my nose at the path of his tracking finger.Is it?Oh, aye, because its below your clavicle.Tell me some more.The finger moved slowly downward.I like to hear the Latin names for things; I never dreamed it would be so pleasant to make love to a physician.That, I said primly, is an areola, and you know it, because I told you last week.So ye did, he murmured.And theres another one, fancy that.The bright head dipped to let his tongue replace the finger, then traveled lower.Umbilicus, I said with a short gasp.Um, he said, muffled lips stretching in a smile against my transparent skin.And whats this, then?You tell me, I said, clutching his head.But he was incapable of speech.Later I lounged in my surgery chair, basking dreamily in memories of awaking in a bed of sunbeams, sheets tumbled in blinding shoals of white like the sands of a beach.One hand rested on my breast, and I toyed idly with the nipple, enjoying the feel of it rising against my palm beneath the thin calico of my bodice.Enjoying yourself?The sarcastic voice from the door brought me upright so quickly that I bumped my head on a shelf.Oh, I said, rather grumpily.Geilie.Who else?What are you doing here?She glided into the surgery, moving as though on wheels.I knew she had feet; Id seen them.What I couldnt figure out was where she put them when she walked.I came to bring Mrs.Fitz some saffron from Spain; she was wanting it against the Dukes coming.More spices?I said, beginning to recover my good humor.If the man eats half the things shes fixing for him, theyll need to roll him home.They could do that now.Hes a wee round ball of a fellow, Ive heard.Dismissing the Duke and his physique, she asked whether Id like to join her for an expedition to the nearby foothills.Im needing a bit of moss, she explained.She waved her long, boneless hands gracefully to and fro.Makes a wonderful lotion for the hands, boiled in milk with a bit of sheeps wool.I cast a look up at my slit window, where the dust motes were going mad in the golden light.A faint scent of ripe fruit and fresh cut hay floated on the breeze.Why not?Waiting as I gathered my baskets and bottles together, Geilie strolled about my surgery, picking things up and putting them down at random.She stopped at a small table and picked up the object that lay there, frowning.Whats this?I stopped what I was doing, and came to stand beside her.She was holding a small bundle of dried plants, tied with three twisted threads; black, white, and red.Jamie says its an ill wish.Hes right.Where did ye come to get it?I told her about the finding of the small bundle in my bed.I went and found it under the window next day, where Jamie threw it.I meant to bring it round to your house and ask if you knew anything about it, but I forgot.She stood tapping a fingernail thoughtfully against her front teeth, shaking her head.No, I canna say that I do.But there might be a way of finding out who left it for ye.Really?Aye.Come to my house in the morning tomorrow, and Ill tell ye then.Refusing to say more, she whirled about in a swirl of green cloak, leaving me to follow as I would.She led me well up into the foothills, galloping when there was road enough to do so, walking when there wasnt.An hours ride from the village, she stopped near a small brook, overhung by willows.We forded the brook and wandered up into the foothills, gathering such late summer plants as still lingered, together with the ripening berries of early autumn and the thick yellow shelf fungus that sprouted from the trunks of trees in the small shady glens.Geilies figure disappeared into the bracken above me, as I paused to scrape a bit of aspen bark into my basket.The globules of dried sap on the papery bark looked like frozen drops of blood, the deep crimson refulgent with trapped sunlight.A sound startled me out of my reverie, and I looked up the hill, in the direction it seemed to come from.I heard the sound again; a high pitched, mewling cry.It seemed to come from above, from a rocky notch near the crest of the hill.I set my basket down and began to climb.Geilie!I shouted.Come up here!Someones left a baby!The sound of scrabbling and muttered imprecations preceded her up the hill, as she fought her way through the entangling bushes on the slope.Her fair face was flushed and cross and she had twigs in her hair.What in Gods name she began, and then darted forward.Christs blood!Put it down!She hastily snatched the baby from my arms, then laid it back where I had found it, in a small depression in the rock.The smooth, bowlshaped hollow was less than a yard across.At one side of the hollow was a shallow wooden bowl, half full of fresh milk, and at the babys feet was a small bouquet of wildflowers, tied with a bit of red twine.But its sick!I protested, stooping toward the child again.Who would leave a sick child up here by itself?The baby was plainly very ill; the small pinched face was greenish, with dark hollows under the eyes, and the little fists waved weakly under the blanket.The child had hung slack in my arms when I picked it up; I wondered that it had had the strength to cry.Its parents, Geilie said briefly, restraining me with a hand on my arm.Leave it.Lets get out of here.Its parents?I said indignantly.But  Its a changeling, she said impatiently.Leave it and come.Now!Dragging me with her, she dodged back into the undergrowth.Protesting, I followed her down the slope until we arrived, breathless and red faced, at the bottom, where I forced her to stop.What is this?I demanded.We cant just abandon a sick child, out in the open like that.And what do you mean, its a changeling?A changeling, she said impatiently.Surely you know what a changeling is?When the fairies steal a human child away, they leave one of their own in its place.You know its a changeling because it cries and fusses all the time and doesnt thrive or grow.Of course I know what it is, I said.But you dont believe that nonsense, do you?She shot me a sudden strange look, full of wary suspicion.Then the lines of her face relaxed into their normal expression of half amused cynicism.No, I dont, she admitted.But the folk here do.She glanced nervously up the slope, but no further sound came from the rocky notch.The family will be somewhere near about.Lets go.Reluctantly, I allowed her to tow me away in the direction of the village.Why did they put it up there?I asked, sitting on a rock to remove my stockings before wading across a small stream.Do they hope the Wee Folk will come and cure it?I was still bothered about the child; it seemed desperately ill.I didnt know what was wrong with it, but perhaps I could help.Maybe I could leave Geilie in the village, then come back for the child.It would have to be soon, though; I glanced up at the eastern sky, where soft grey rain clouds were swiftly darkening into purple dusk.A pink glow still showed to the west, but there could be no more than half an hours light left.Geilie looped the twisted withy handle of her basket over her neck, picked up her skirt and stepped into the stream, shivering at the cold water.No, she said.Or rather, yes.Thats one of the fairies hills, and its dangerous to sleep there.If ye leave a changeling out overnight in such a place, the Folk will come and take it back, and leave the human child theyve stolen in its place.But they wont, because it isnt a changeling, I said, sucking in my breath at the touch of the melted snow water.Its only a sick child.It might very well not survive a night in the open!It wont, she said briefly.It will be dead by morning.And I hope to God no one saw us near it.I stopped abruptly in the midst of putting on my shoes.Dead!Geilie, Im going back for it.I cant leave it there.I turned and started back across the stream.She caught me from behind and pushed me flat on my face into the shallow water.Floundering and gasping, I managed to rise to my knees, sloshing water in all directions.Geilie stood calf deep in the stream, skirts soaked, glaring down at me.You bloody pig headed English ass!she shouted at me.Theres nothing ye can do!Do ye hear me?Nothing!That childs as good as dead!Ill not stand here and let ye risk your own life and mine for some crack brained notion of yours!Snorting and grumbling under her breath, she reached down and got me under the arms with both hands, lugging me to my feet.Claire, she said urgently, shaking me by the arms.Listen to me.If ye go near that child and it diesand it will, believe me, Ive seen them like thatthen the family will blame you for it.Do ye no see the danger of it?Dont ye know what they say about you in the village?I stood shivering in the cold breeze of sunset, torn between her obvious panic for my safety, and the thought of a helpless child, slowly dying alone in the dark, with wildflowers at its feet.No, I said, shaking the wet hair out of my face.Geilie, no, I cant.Ill be careful, I promise, but I have to go.I pulled myself out of her grasp and turned toward the far bank, stumbling and splashing in the uncertain shadows of the streambed.There was a muffled cry of exasperation from behind me, then a frenzied sploshing in the opposite direction.Well, at least she wouldnt hamper me further.It was growing dark fast, and I pushed through the bushes and weeds as quickly as I could.I wasnt sure that I could find the right hill if it grew dark before I reached it; there were several nearby, all about the same height.And fairies or not, the thought of wandering about alone out here in the dark was not one I cared for.The question of how I was going to make it back to the Castle with a sick baby was something I would deal with when the time came.I found the hill, finally, by spotting the stand of young larches I remembered at the base.It was nearly full dark by this time, a moonless night, and I stumbled and fell frequently.The larches stood huddled together, talking quietly in the evening breeze with clicks and creaks and rustling sighs.Bloody place is haunted, I thought, listening to the leafy conversation overhead as I threaded my way through the slender trunks.I wouldnt be surprised to meet a ghost behind the next tree.I was surprised, though.Actually, I was scared out of my wits when the shadowy figure slid out and grabbed me.I let out a piercing shriek and struck at it.Jesus Christ, I said, what are you doing here?I crumpled for a moment against Jamies chest, relieved to see him, in spite of the fright he had given me.He took me by the arm and turned to lead me out of the wood.Came for you, he said, low voiced.I was coming to meet you because night was comin on; I met Geillis Duncan near St.Johns brook and she told me where you were.But the baby I began, turning back toward the hill.The childs dead, he said briefly, tugging me back.I went up there first, to see.I followed him then without demur, distressed over the childs death, but relieved that I would not, after all, have to face the climb to the fairies crest or the long journey back alone.Oppressed by the dark and the whispering trees, I didnt speak until we had crossed the brook again.Still damp from the previous immersion, I didnt bother removing my stockings, but sloshed across regardless.Jamie, still dry, stayed that way by leaping from the bank to a central boulder that stood above the current, then vaulted to my bank like a broad jumper.Have ye any idea how dangerous it is to be out alone at night like that, Sassenach?he inquired.He didnt seem angry, just curious.NoI mean yes.Im sorry if I worried you.But I couldnt leave a child out there, I just couldnt.Aye, I know.He hugged me briefly.Youve a kind heart, Sassenach.But youve no idea what youre dealing with, here.Fairies, hm?I was tired, and disturbed over the incident, but covered it with flippancy.Im not afraid of superstitions.A thought struck me.Do you believe in fairies, and changelings, and all that?He hesitated for a moment before answering.No.No, I dinna believe in such things, though damned if Id care to sleep all night on a fairies hill, for a that.But Im an educated man, Sassenach.I had a German tutor at Dougals house, a good one, who taught me Latin and Greek and such, and later when I went to France at eighteenwell, I studied history and philosophy and I saw that there was a good deal more to the world than the glens and the moors, and the waterhorses in the lochs.But these people He waved an arm, taking in the darkness behind us.Theyve neer been more than a days walk from the place they were born, except for a great thing like a clan Gathering, and that might happen twice in a lifetime.They live among the glens and the lochs, and they hear no more of the world than what Father Bain tells them in kirk of a Sunday.That and the old stories.He held aside an alder branch and I stooped under it.We were on the deer trail Geilie and I had followed earlier, and I was heartened by this fresh evidence that he could find his way, even in the dark.Away from the fairies hill, he spoke in his normal voice, only pausing occasionally to brush away some tangling growth from his path.Those tales are naught but entertainment in Gwyllyns hands, when ye sit in the Hall drinking Rhenish wine.He preceded me down the path, and his voice floated back to me, soft and emphatic in the cool night air.Out here, though, and even in the villagenay, thats something else.Folk live by them.I suppose theres some truth behind some of them.I thought of the amber eyes of the waterhorse, and wondered which others were true.And otherswell, his voice grew softer, and I had to strain to hear him.For the parents of that child, maybe it will ease them a bit to believe it is the changeling who died, and think of their own child, healthy and well, living forever with the fairies.We reached the horses then, and within half an hour the lights of Castle Leoch shone through the darkness to welcome us.I had never thought I would consider that bleak edifice an outpost of advanced civilization, but just now the lights seemed those of a beacon of enlightenment.It was not until we drew closer that I realized the impression of light was due to the string of lanterns blazing along the parapet of the bridge.Somethings happened, I said, turning to Jamie.And seeing him for the first time in the light, I realized that he was not wearing his usual worn shirt and grubby kilt.His snowy linen shone in the lantern light, and his besthis onlyvelvet coat lay across his saddle.Aye, he nodded.Thats why I came to get you.The Dukes come at last.* * *    The Duke was something of a surprise.I dont know quite what I had been expecting, but it wasnt the bluff, hearty, red faced sportsman I met in Leochs hall.He had a pleasantly blunt, weatherbeaten face, with light blue eyes that always squinted slightly, as though looking into the sun after the flight of a pheasant.I wondered for a moment whether that earlier bit of theatrics regarding the Duke might have been overstated.Looking around the hall, though, I noticed that every boy under eighteen wore a slightly wary expression, keeping his eyes fixed on the Duke as he laughed and talked animatedly with Colum and Dougal.Not merely theatrics, then; they had been warned.When I was presented to the Duke, I had some difficulty in keeping a straight face.He was a big man, fit and solid, the sort you so often see booming out their opinions in pubs, bearing down the opposition by dint of loudness and repetition.I had been warned, of course, by Jamies story, but the physical impression was so overwhelming that when the Duke bowed low over my hand and said, But how charming to find a countrywoman in this remote spot, Mistress, in a voice like an overwrought mouse, I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from disgracing myself in public.Worn out from travel, the Duke and his party retired early to bed.The next night, though, there was music and conversation after dinner, and Jamie and I joined Colum, Dougal, and the Duke.Sandringham grew expansive over Colums Rhenish wine, and talked volubly, expounding equally upon the horrors of travel in the Highlands and the beauties of the countryside.We listened politely, and I tried not to catch Jamies eye as the Duke squeaked out the story of his travails.Broke an axle tree outside of Stirling, and we were becalmed three daysin the pouring rain, mind youbefore my footman could find a blacksmith to come and repair the blasted thing.And not half a day later, we bounced into the most tremendous pothole Ive ever seen and broke the damn thing again!And then one horse threw a shoe, and we had to unload the coach and walk beside itin the mudleading the lame nag.And then As the tale went on, from misfortune to misfortune, I felt an increasing urge to giggle, and attempted to drown it with more winepossibly an error in judgment.But the game, MacKenzie, the game!the Duke exclaimed at one point, rolling his eyes in ecstasy.I could scarce believe it.No wonder you set such a table.He gently patted his large, solid stomach.I swear Id give my eyeteeth for a try at a stag like the one we saw two days ago; splendid beast, simply splendid.Leapt out of the brush right in front of the coach, mdear, he confided to me.Startled the horses so we near as a toucher went off the road again!Colum raised the bell shaped decanter, with an inquiring cock of one dark brow.As he poured to the proffered glasses, he said, Well, perhaps we might arrange a hunt for ye, your Grace.My nephews a bonny huntsman.He glanced sharply from under his brows at Jamie; there was a scarcely perceptible nod in response.Colum sat back, replacing the decanter, and said casually, Aye, thatll do well, then.Perhaps early next week.Its too early for pheasant, but the stag hunting will be fine.He turned to Dougal, lounging in a padded chair to one side.My brother might go along; if you have it in mind to travel northwards, he can show ye the lands we were discussing earlier.Capital, capital!The Duke was delighted.He patted Jamie on the leg; I saw the muscles tighten, but Jamie didnt move.He smiled tranquilly, and the Duke let his hand linger just a moment too long.Then His Grace caught my eye on him, and smiled jovially at me, his expression saying Worth a try, eh?Despite myself, I smiled back.Much to my surprise, I quite liked the man.* * *    In the excitement of the Dukes arrival, I had forgotten Geilies offer to help me discover the sender of the ill wish.And after the unpleasant scene with the changeling child on the fairies hill, I wasnt sure that I wanted to try anything she might suggest.Still, curiosity overcame suspicion, and when Colum asked Jamie to ride down and escort the Duncans to the castle for the Dukes banquet two days later, I went with him.Thus it was that Thursday found me and Jamie in the Duncans parlor, being entertained with a sort of awkward friendliness by the fiscal, while his wife finished her dressing upstairs.Largely recovered from the effects of his last gastric attack, Arthur still did not look terribly healthy.Like many fat men who lose too much weight abruptly, the weight had gone from his face, rather than his stomach.His paunch still swelled the green silk of his waistcoat, while the skin of his face drooped in flabby folds.Perhaps I could slip upstairs and help Geilie with her hair or something, I suggested.Ive brought her a new ribbon.Foreseeing the possible need of an excuse for talking to Geilie alone, I had brought a small package with me.Producing it as an excuse, I was through the door and up the stairs before Arthur could protest.She was ready for me.Come on, she said, well go up to my private room for this.Well have to hurry, but it wont take too long.I followed Geilie up the narrow, twisting stair.The steps were irregular heights; some of the risers were so high I had to lift my skirts to avoid tripping on the way up.I concluded that seventeenth century carpenters either had faulty methods of measuring or rich senses of humor.Geilies private sanctum was at the top of the house, in one of the remote attics above the servants quarters.It was guarded by a locked door, opened by a truly formidable key which Geilie produced from her apron pocket; it must have been at least six inches long, with a broad fretwork head ornamented with a vine and flower pattern.The key must have weighed nearly a pound; held by the barrel, it would have made a good weapon.Both lock and hinges were well oiled, and the thick door swung inward silently.The attic room was small, cramped by the gabled dormers that cut across the front of the house.Shelves lined every inch of wall space, holding jars, bottles, flasks, vials, and beakers.Bunches of drying herbs, carefully tied with threads of different colors, hung neatly in rows from the rafters overhead, brushing my hair with a fragrant dust as we passed beneath.This was nothing like the clean, businesslike order of the herb room downstairs, though.It was crowded, almost cluttered, and dark in spite of the dormer windows.One shelf held books, mostly old and crumbling, the spines unmarked.I ran a curious finger over the row of leather bindings.Most were calf, but there were two or three bound in something different; something soft, but unpleasantly oily to the touch.And one that to all appearances was bound in fish skin.I pulled a volume out and opened it gingerly.It was handwritten in a mixture of archaic French, and even more obsolete Latin, but I could make out the title.LGrimoire dle Comte St.Germain.I closed the book and set it back on the shelf, feeling a slight shock.A grimoire.A handbook of magic.I could feel Geilies gaze boring into my back, and turned to meet a mixture of mischief and wary speculation.What would I do, now that I knew?So it isnt a rumor, then, is it?I said, smiling.You really are a witch.I wondered just how far it went, and whether she believed it herself, or whether these were merely the trappings of an elaborate make believe that she used to alleviate the boredom of marriage to Arthur.I also wondered just what sort of magic she practicedor thought she practiced.Oh, white, she said, grinning.Definitely white magic.I thought ruefully that Jamie must be right about my faceeveryone seemed to be able to tell what I was thinking.Well, thats good, I said.Im really not much of a one for dancing round bonfires at midnight and riding brooms, let alone kissing the Devils arse.Geilie tossed back her hair and laughed delightedly.Ye dont kiss anyones much, that I can see, she said.Nor do I.  Though if I had a sweet fiery devil like yours in my bed, Ill not say I might not come to it in time.That reminds me I began, but she had already turned away, and was about her preparations, murmuring to herself.Checking first to see that the door was securely locked behind us, Geilie crossed to the gabled window and rummaged in a chest built into the window seat.She pulled out a large, shallow pan and a tall white candle stuck in a pottery holder.A further foray produced a worn quilt, which she spread on the floor as protection against dust and splinters.What exactly is it youre planning to do, Geilie?I asked, examining the preparations suspiciously.Off hand, I couldnt see much sinister intent in a pan, a candle, and a quilt, but then I was a novice magician, to say the least.Summoning, she said, tugging the corners of the quilt around so that the sides lay straight with the boards of the floor.Summoning whom?I asked.Or what.She stood and brushed her hair back.Baby fine and slippery, it was coming down from its fastenings.Muttering, she yanked the pins from her hair and let it fall down in a straight, shiny curtain, the color of heavy cream.Oh, ghosts, spirits, visions.Anything ye might have need of, she said.It starts the same in any case, but the herbs and the words are different for each thing.What we want now is a visionto see who it is whos ill wished ye.Then we can turn the ill wish back upon them.Er, well I really had no wish to be vindictive, but I was curiousboth to see what summoning was like, and to know who had left me the ill wish.Setting the pan in the middle of the quilt, she poured water into it from a jug, explaining, You can use any vessel big enough to make a good reflection, though the grimoire says to use a silver bassin.Even a pond or a puddle of water outside will do for some kinds of summoning, though it must be secluded.Ye need peace and quiet to do this.She passed rapidly from window to window, drawing the heavy black curtains until virtually all the light in the room was extinguished.I could barely see Geilies slender form flitting through the gloom, until she lit the candle.The wavering flame lit her face as she carried it back to the quilt, throwing wedge shaped shadows under the bold nose and chiseled jaw.She set the candle next to the pan of water, on the side away from me.She filled the pan very carefully, so full that the water bulged slightly above the rim, kept from spilling by its surface tension.Leaning over, I could see that the surface of the water provided an excellent reflection, far better than that obtainable in any of the Castles looking glasses.As though mind reading again, Geilie explained that in addition to its use in summoning spirits, the reflecting pan was an excellent accessory for dressing the hair.Dont bump into it, or youll get soaked, she advised, frowning in concentration as she lit the candle.Something about the practical tone of the remark, so prosaic in the midst of these supernatural preparations, reminded me of someone.Looking up at the slender, pallid figure, stooping elegantly over the tinderbox, I couldnt think at first of whom she reminded me.But of course.While no one could be less like that dowdy figure athwart the teapot in Reverend Wakefields study, the tone of voice had been that of Mrs.Graham, exactly.Perhaps it was an attitude they shared, a pragmatism that regarded the occult as merely a collection of phenomena like the weather.Something to be approached with cautious respect, of coursemuch as one would take care in using a sharp kitchen knifebut certainly nothing to avoid or fear.Or it might have been the smell of lavender water.Geilies loose, flowing gowns smelled always of the essences she distilled: marigold, chamomile, bay leaf, spikenard, mint, marjoram.Today, though, it was lavender that drifted from the folds of the white dress.The same scent that permeated Mrs.Grahams practical blue cotton and wafted from the corrugations of her bony chest.If Geilies chest was likewise underlaid by such skeletal supports, there was no hint of it visible, in spite of her robes low neckline.It was the first time I had seen Geilie Duncan en dshabille; customarily she wore the severe and voluminous gowns, buttoned high at the neck, that were suitable to the wife of a fiscal.The swelling opulence now revealed was a surprise, a creamy abundance almost the same shade as the dress she wore, and gave me some idea why a man like Arthur Duncan might have married a penniless girl of no family.My eye went involuntarily to the line of neatly labeled jars along the wall, looking for saltpeter.Geilie selected three of the jars from the shelf, pouring a small quantity from each into the bowl of a tiny metal brazier.She lit the layer of charcoal underneath from the candle flame, and blew on the dawning flame to encourage it.A fragrant smoke began to rise as the spark took hold.The air in the attic was so still that the greyish smoke rose straight up without diffusing, forming a column that echoed the shape of the tall white candle.Geilie sat between the two columns like a priestess in her temple, legs folded gracefully under her.Well then, that will do nicely, I think.Briskly dusting crumbs of rosemary from her fingers, Geilie surveyed the scene with satisfaction.The black drapes, with their mystic symbols, shut out all intrusive beams of sunlight, and left the candle as the only source of direct illumination.The flame was reflected and diffused through the pan of still water, which seemed to glow as though it, too, were a source rather than a reflection of light.What now?I inquired.The large grey eyes glowed like the water, alight with anticipation.She waved her hands across the surface of the water, then folded them between her legs.Just sit quiet for a moment, she said.Listen to your heartbeat.Do you hear it?Breathe easy, slow and deep.In spite of the liveliness of her expression, her voice was calm and slow, a distinct contrast to her usual sprightly conversation.I obediently did as she instructed, feeling my heart slow as my breathing steadied to an even rhythm.I recognized the scent of rosemary in the smoke, but I wasnt sure of the other two herbs; foxglove, perhaps, or cinquefoil?I had thought the purple flowers were those of nightshade, but surely that couldnt be.Whatever they were, the slowness of my breathing did not seem to be attributable only to the power of Geilies suggestion.I felt as though a weight were pressing against my breastbone, slowing my breathing without my having to will it.Geilie herself sat perfectly still, watching me with unblinking eyes.She nodded, once, and I looked down obediently into the still surface of the water.She began to talk, in an even, conversational way that reminded me again of Mrs.Graham, calling down the sun in the circle of stones.The words were not English, and yet not quite not English, either.It was a strange tongue, but one I felt that I should know, as though the words were spoken just below the level of my hearing.I felt my hands begin to go numb, and wanted to move them from their folded position in my lap, but they wouldnt move.Her even voice went on, soft and persuading.Now I knew that I understood what was being said, but still could not summon the words to the surface of my mind.I realized dimly that I was either being hypnotized, or under the influence of some drug, and my mind took some last foothold on the edge of conscious thought, resisting the pull of the sweet scented smoke.I could see my reflection in the water, pupils shrunk to pinpoints, eyes wide as a sun blind owls.The word opium drifted through my fading thoughts.Who are you?I couldnt tell which of us had asked the question, but I felt my own throat move as I answered, Claire.Who sent you here?I came.Why did you come?I cant tell.Why cant you tell?Because no one will believe me.The voice in my head grew still more soothing, friendly, beguiling.I will believe you.Believe me.Who are you?Claire.A sudden loud noise broke the spell.Geilie started and her knee bumped the bassin, startling the reflection back into the water.Geillis?My dear?A voice called through the door, tentative yet commanding.We must be going, my dear.The horses are ready, and youre not yet gowned.Muttering something rude under her breath, Geilie rose and flung open the window, so that the fresh air rushed into my face, making me blink and dispelling some of the fog in my head.She stood looking down at me speculatively, then stooped to help me up.Come along, then, she said.Come over a bit queer, have you?Sometimes it takes folk that way.Youd best lie down on my bed while I dress.I lay flat on the coverlet in her bedroom below, eyes closed, listening to the small rustling noises Geilie made in her privy closet, wondering what the hell that had been all about.Nothing to do with the ill wish or its sender, clearly.Only with my identity.With sharpness returning gradually to my wits, it occurred to me to wonder whether Geilie perhaps was a spy for Colum.Placed as she was, she heard the business and the secrets of the whole district.And who, other than Colum, would be so interested in my origins?What would have happened, I wondered, had Arthur not interrupted the summoning?Would I have heard, somewhere in the scented fog, the standard hypnotists injunction, When you wake, you will remember nothing?But I did remember, and I wondered.In the event, however, there was no chance to ask Geilie about it.The bedroom door flew open, and Arthur Duncan came in.Crossing to the door of the privy closet, he knocked once, hastily, and went in.There was a small startled scream from within, and then dead silence.Arthur Duncan reappeared in the door, eyes wide and staring blind, face so white that I thought perhaps he was suffering an attack of some sort.I leaped to my feet and hurried toward him as he leaned heavily against the door jamb.Before I reached him, though, he pushed himself away from the door and went out of the room, staggering slightly, pushing past me as though he didnt see me.I knocked on the door myself.Geilie!Are you all right?There was a moments silence, then a perfectly composed voice said, Aye, of course.Ill be out in a moment.When we at length descended the stairs, we found Arthur, apparently somewhat recovered, sipping brandy with Jamie.He seemed a bit abstracted, as though he were thinking of something, but greeted his wife with a mild compliment on her appearance, before sending the groom for the horses.The banquet was just beginning as we arrived, and the fiscal and his wife were shown to their places of honor at the head table.Jamie and I, somewhat lower in status, took our places at a table with Rupert and Ned Gowan.Mrs.Fitz had excelled herself, and beamed in gratification at the compliments heaped upon the food, the drink, and other preparations.It was in fact delicious.I had never tasted roast pheasant stuffed with honeyed chestnuts, and was helping myself to a third slice, when Ned Gowan, watching in some amusement at my appetite, asked whether I had yet tried the suckling pig.My reply was interrupted by a stir at the far end of the Hall.Colum had risen from his table, and was headed toward me, accompanied by Old Alec MacMahon.I see there is no end to your talents, Mistress Fraser, Colum remarked, bowing slightly.A broad smile marked the arresting features.From dressing wounds and healing the sick to delivering foals.We shall be calling upon you to raise the dead before long, I suppose.There was a general chuckle at this, though I noticed one or two men glancing nervously in the direction of Father Bain, in attendance this evening, who was methodically stuffing himself with roast mutton in the corner.In any case, Colum continued, reaching into his coat pocket, you must allow me to present you with a small token of my gratitude.He handed me a small wooden box, lid carved with the MacKenzie badge.I hadnt realized just how valuable a horse Losgann was, and mentally thanked whatever benign spirits presided over such events that nothing had gone wrong.Nonsense, I said, trying to give it back.I didnt do anything out of the way.It was only luck that I have small hands.Nevertheless.Colum was firm.If you prefer, consider it a small wedding gift, but I wish you to have it.At a nod from Jamie, I reluctantly accepted the box and opened it.It contained a beautiful rosary of jet, each bead intricately carved, and the crucifix inlaid with silver.Its lovely, I said sincerely.And it was, though I had no notion what I might do with it.Though nominally a Catholic, I had been raised by Uncle Lamb, the completest of agnostics, and had only the vaguest idea of the significance of a rosary.Nonetheless, I thanked Colum warmly, and gave the rosary to Jamie to keep for me in his sporran.I curtsied to Colum, gratified to find that I was mastering the art of doing so without falling on my face.He opened his mouth to take a gracious leave, but was interrupted by a sudden crash that came from behind me.Turning, I could see nothing but backs and heads, as people leapt from their benches to gather round whatever had caused the uproar.Colum made his way with some difficulty around the table, clearing aside the crowd with an impatient wave of the hand.As people stepped respectfully out of his way, I could see the rotund form of Arthur Duncan on the floor, limbs flailing convulsively, batting away the helpful hands of would be assistants.His wife pushed her way through the muttering throng, dropped to the floor beside him, and made a vain attempt to cradle his head in her lap.The stricken man dug his heels into the floor and arched his back, making gargling, choking noises.Glancing up, Geilies green eyes anxiously scanned the crowd as though looking for someone.Assuming that I was the one she was looking for, I took the path of least resistance, dodging under the table and crawling across on hands and knees.Reaching Geilies side, I grabbed her husbands face between my hands and tried to pry his jaws open.I thought, from the sounds he was making, that he had perhaps choked on a piece of meat, which might still be lodged in his windpipe.His jaws were clamped and rigid, though, lips blue and flecked with a foamy spittle that didnt seem consistent with choking.Choking he surely was, though; the plump chest heaved vainly, fighting for breath.Quickly, turn him on his side, I said.Several hands reached out at once to help, and the heavy body was deftly turned, broad black serge back toward me.I drove the heel of my hand hard between the shoulder blades, smacking him repeatedly with a dull thumping noise.The massive back quivered slightly with the blows, but there was no answering jerk as of an obstruction suddenly released.I gripped a meaty shoulder and pulled him onto his back once more.Geilie bent close over the staring face, calling his name, massaging his mottled throat.The eyes were rolled back now, and the drumming heels began to slacken their beat.The hands, clawed in agony, suddenly flung wide, smacking an anxiously crouching onlooker in the face.The sputtering noises abruptly ceased, and the stout body went limp, lying inert as a sack of barley on the stone flags.I felt frantically for a pulse in one slack wrist, noticing with half an eye that Geilie was doing the same, pulling up the round, shaven chin and pressing her fingertips hard into the flesh under the angle of the jaw in search of the carotid artery.Both searches were futile.Arthur Duncans heart, already taxed by the necessity of pumping blood through that massive frame for so many years, had given up the struggle.I tried all the resuscitative techniques at my disposal, useless though I knew them now to be: arm flapping, chest massage, even mouth to mouth breathing, distasteful as that was, but with the expected result.Arthur Duncan was dead as a doornail.I straightened wearily and stood back, as Father Bain, with a nasty glare at me, dropped to his knees by the fiscals side and began hastily to administer the final rites.My back and arms ached, and my face felt oddly numb.The hubbub around me seemed strangely remote, as though a curtain separated me from the crowded hall.I closed my eyes and rubbed a hand across my tingling lips, trying to erase the taste of death.* * *    Despite the death of the fiscal, and the subsequent formalities of obsequies and burial, the Dukes stag hunt was delayed by no more than a week.The realization of Jamies imminent departure was deeply depressing; I suddenly realized just how much I looked forward to seeing him at dinner after the days work, how my heart would leap when I saw him unexpectedly at odd moments during the day, and how much I depended on his company and his solid, reassuring presence amid the complexities of life in the castle.And, to be perfectly honest, how much I liked the smooth, warm strength of him in my bed each night, and waking to his tousled, smiling kisses in the mornings.The prospect of his absence was bleak.He held me closely, my head snuggled under his chin.Ill miss you, Jamie, I said softly.He hugged me tighter, and gave a rueful chuckle.So will I, Sassenach.I hadna expected it, to tell the truthbut it will hurt me to leave ye.He stroked my back gently, fingers tracing the bumps of the vertebrae.Jamieyoull be careful?I could feel the deep rumble of amusement in his chest as he answered.Of the Duke or the horse?He was, much to my apprehension, intending to ride Donas on the stag hunt.I had visions of the huge sorrel beast plunging over a cliff out of sheer wrong headedness, or trampling Jamie under those lethal hooves.Both, I said dryly.If the horse throws you and you break a leg, youll be at the Dukes mercy.True.Dougal will be there, though.I snorted.Hell break the other leg.He laughed and bent his head to kiss me.Ill be careful, mo duinne.Will ye give me the same promise?Yes, I said, meaning it.Do you mean whoever left the ill wish?The momentary amusement was gone now.Perhaps.I dinna think youre in any danger, or I wouldna leave ye.But stilloh, and stay away from Geillis Duncan.What?Why?I drew back a little to look up at him.It was a dark night and his face was invisible, but his tone was altogether serious.The womans known as a witch, and the stories about herwell, theyve got a deal worse since her husband died.I dinna want ye anywhere near her, Sassenach.Do you honestly think shes a witch?I demanded.His strong hands cupped my bottom and scooped me in close to him.I put my arms around him, enjoying the feel of his smooth, solid torso.No, he said finally.But it isna what I think that could be a danger to ye.Will ye promise?All right.In truth, I had little reluctance to give the promise; since the incidents of the changeling and the summoning, I had not felt much desire to visit Geilie.I put my mouth on Jamies nipple, flicking it lightly with my tongue.He made a small sound deep in his throat and pulled me nearer.Open your legs, he whispered.I mean to be sure youll remember me while Im gone.Sometime later, I woke feeling cold.Groping sleepily for the quilt, I couldnt find it.Suddenly it came up over me of its own accord.Surprised, I raised up on one elbow to look.Im sorry, Jamie said.I didna mean to wake ye, lass.What are you doing?Why are you awake?I squinted over my shoulder at him.It was still dark, but my eyes were so accustomed that I could see the faintly sheepish expression on his face.He was wide awake, sitting on a stool by the side of the bed, his plaid flung around him for warmth.Its onlywell, I dreamed you were lost, and I couldna find ye.It woke me, andI wanted to look at ye, is all.To fix ye in my mind, to remember while Im gone.I turned back the quilt; Im sorry you were chilled.Its all right.The night was cold, and very quiet, as though we were the only two souls in the world.Come into bed.You must be chilled too.He slid in next to me and curled himself against my back.His hands stroked me from neck to shoulder, waist to hip, tracing the lines of my back, the curves of my body.Mo duinne, he said softly.But now I should say mo airgeadach.My silver one.Your hair is silver gilt and your skin is white velvet.Calman geal.White dove.I pressed my hips back against him, inviting, and settled against him with a sigh as his solid hardness filled me.He held me against his chest and moved with me, slowly, deeply.I gasped a little and he slackened his hold.Im sorry, he murmured.I didna mean to hurt ye.But I do want to be in you, to stay in you, so deep.I want to leave the feel of me deep inside ye with my seed.I want to hold ye so and stay wi you til dawn, and leave you sleeping and go, with the shapes of you warm in my hands.I pressed firmly back against him.You wont hurt me.* * *    After Jamies departure, I moped about the castle.I saw patients in the surgery, I occupied myself as much as I could in the gardens, and I tried to distract myself by browsing in Colums library, but still time hung heavy on my hands.I had been alone nearly two weeks, when I met the girl Laoghaire in the corridor outside the kitchens.I had watched her covertly now and then, since the day when I had seen her on the landing outside Colums study.She seemed blooming enough, but there was an air of tenseness about her that was easily discernible.She seemed distracted and moodyand little wonder, poor girl, I thought kindly.Today, though, she looked somewhat excited.Mrs.Fraser!she said.Ive a message for you.The widow Duncan, she said, had sent word that she was ill, and requested me to come and tend her.I hesitated, remembering Jamies injunctions, but the twin forces of compassion and boredom were sufficient to set me on the road to the village within the hour, my medicine box strapped behind me on the horses saddle.The Duncans house when I arrived had an air of neglected abandon, a sense of disorder that extended through the house itself.There was no answer to my knock, and when I pushed the door open, I found the entry hall and parlor scattered with books and dirty glasses, mats askew and dust thick on the furniture.My calls produced no maidservant, and the kitchen proved to be as empty and disordered as the rest of the house.Increasingly anxious, I went upstairs.The bedroom in front also was vacant, but I heard a faint shuffling noise from the stillroom across the landing.Pushing open the door, I saw Geilie, sitting in a comfortable chair, feet propped on the counter.She had been drinking; there was a glass and decanter on the counter, and the room smelled strongly of brandy.She was startled to see me, but struggled to her feet, smiling.Her eyes were slightly out of focus, I thought, but she certainly seemed well enough.Whats the matter?I asked.Arent you ill?She goggled at me in amazement.Ill?Me?No.The servants have all left, and theres no food in the house, but theres plenty of brandy.Will ye have a drop?She turned back toward the decanter.I grabbed her sleeve.You didnt send for me?No.She stared at me, wide eyed.Then why My question was interrupted by a noise from outside.A far off, rumbling, muttering sort of noise.I had heard it before, from this room, and my palms had grown sweaty then at the thought of confronting the mob that made it.I wiped my hands on the skirts of my dress.The rumbling was nearer, and there was neither need nor time for questions.25    THOU SHALT NOT SUFFER A WITCH TO LIVE    The drab clad shoulders ahead of me parted on darkness.My elbow struck wood with a bone numbing thump as I was shoved roughly over a threshold of some sort, and I fell headlong into a black stench, alive and wriggling with unseen forms.I shrieked and thrashed, trying to free myself from entanglement with innumerable scrabbling tiny feet and an attack by something larger, that squealed and struck me a hard blow on the thigh.I succeeded in rolling away, though only a foot or two before I hit an earthen wall that sent a shower of dirt cascading down on my head.I huddled as close to it as I could get, trying to suppress my own gasping breath so that I could hear whatever was trapped in this reeking pit with me.Whatever it was, was large, and breathing hoarsely, but not growling.A pig, perhaps?Whos there?came a voice from the Stygian black, sounding scared but defiantly loud.Claire, is it you?Geilie!I gasped and groped toward her, meeting her hands likewise searching.We clasped each other tightly, rocking slightly back and forth in the gloom.Is there anything else in here besides us?I asked, glancing cautiously around.Even with my eyes now accustomed to the dark, there was precious little to be seen.There were faint streaks of light coming from somewhere above, but the tenebrous shadows were shoulder high here below; I could barely make out Geilies face, level with my own and only a few inches away.She laughed, a little shakily.Several mice, I think, and other vermin.And a smell that would knock a ferret over.I noticed the smell.Where in Gods name are we?The thieves hole.Stand back!There was a grating sound from overhead and a sudden shaft of light.I pressed myself against the wall, barely in time to avoid a shower of mud and filth that cascaded through a small opening in the roof of our prison.A single soft plop followed the deluge.Geilie bent and picked up something from the floor.The opening above remained, and I could see that what she held was a small loaf, stale and smeared with assorted muck.She dusted it gingerly with a fold of her skirt.Dinner, she said.Hungry, are you?* * *    The hole above remained open, and empty, save for the occasional missile flung by a passerby.The drizzle came in, and a searching wind.It was cold, damp, and thoroughly miserable.Suitable, I supposed, for the malefactors it was meant to house.Thieves, vagrants, blasphemers, adulterersand suspected witches.Geilie and I huddled together for warmth against one wall, not speaking much.There was little to say, and precious little either of us could do for ourselves, beyond possess our souls in patience.The hole above grew gradually darker as the night came on, until it faded into the black all around.* * *    How long do you think they mean to keep us here?Geilie shifted, stretching her legs so that the small oblong of morning light from above shone on the striped linen of her skirt.Originally a fresh pink and white, it was now considerably the worse for wear.Not too long, she said.Theyll be waiting for the ecclesiastical examiners.Arthur had letters last month, arranging for it.The second week of October, it was.They should be here any time.She rubbed her hands together to warm them, then put them on her knees, in the little square of sunlight.Tell me about the examiners, I said.What will happen, exactly?I canna say, exactly.Ive neer seen a witch trial, though Ive heard of them, of course.She paused a moment, considering.Theyll not be expecting a witch trial, since they were coming to try some land disputes.So theyll not have a witch pricker, at least.A what?Witches canna feel pain, Geilie explained.Nor do they bleed when theyre pricked.The witch pricker, equipped with a variety of pins, lancets, and other pointed implements, was charged with testing for this condition.I vaguely recalled something of this from Franks books, but had thought it a practice common to the seventeenth century, not this one.On the other hand, I thought wryly, Cranesmuir was not exactly a hotbed of civilization.In that case, its too bad there wont be one, I said, though recoiling slightly at the thought of being stabbed repeatedly.We could pass that test with no difficulty.Or I could, I added caustically.I imagine theyd get ice water, not blood, when they tried it on you.Id not be too sure, she said reflectively, overlooking the insult.Ive heard of witch prickers with special pinsmade to collapse when theyre pressed against the skin, so it looks as though they dont go in.But why?Why try to prove someone a witch on purpose?The sun was on the decline now, but the afternoon light was enough to suffuse our hutch with a dim glow.The elegant oval of Geilies face showed only pity for my innocence.Ye still dinna understand, do ye?she said.They mean to kill us.And it doesna matter much what the charge is, or what the evidence shows.Well burn, all the same.The night before, I had been too shocked from the mobs attack and the misery of our surroundings to do more than huddle with Geilie and wait for the dawn.With the light, though, what remained of my spirit was beginning to awake.Why, Geilie?I asked, feeling rather breathless.Do you know?The atmosphere in the hole was thick with the stench of rot, filth, and damp soil, and I felt as though the impenetrable earthen walls were about to cave in upon me like the sides of an ill dug grave.I felt rather than saw her shrug; the shaft of light from above had moved with the sun, and now struck the wall of our prison, leaving us in cold dark below.If its much comfort to ye, she said dryly, I misdoubt ye were meant to be taken.Its a matter between me and Columyou had the ill luck to be with me when the townsfolk came.Had ye been wi Colum, youd likely have been safe enough, Sassenach or no.The term Sassenach, spoken in its usual derogatory sense, suddenly struck me with a sense of desperate longing for the man who called me so in affection.I wrapped my arms around my body, hugging myself to contain the lonely panic that threatened to envelop me.Why did you come to my house?Geilie asked curiously.I thought you had sent for me.One of the girls at the castle brought me a messagefrom you, she said.Ah, she said thoughtfully.Laoghaire, was it?I sat down and rested my back against the earth wall, despite my revulsion for the muddy, stinking surface.Feeling my movement, Geilie shifted closer.Friends or enemies, we were each others only source of warmth in the hole; we huddled together perforce.How did you know it was Laoghaire?I asked, shivering.Twas her that left the ill wish in your bed, Geilie replied.I told ye at the first there were those minded your taking the red haired laddie.I suppose she thought if ye were gone, shed have a chance at him again.I was struck dumb at this, and it took a moment to find my voice.But she couldnt!Geilies laugh was hoarsened by cold and thirst, but still held that edge of silver.Anyone seein the way the lad looks at ye would know that.But I dinna suppose shes seen enough o the world to ken such things.Let her lie wi a man once or twice, and shell know, but not now.Thats not what I meant!I burst out.It isnt Jamie she wants; the girls with child by Dougal MacKenzie.What?!She was genuinely shocked for a moment, and her fingers bit into the flesh of my arm.How dye come to think that?I told her of seeing Laoghaire on the stair below Colums study, and the conclusions I had come to.Geilie snorted.Pah!She heard Colum and Dougal talking about me; thats what made her blenchshed think Colum had heard shed been to me for the ill wish.Hed have her whipped to bleeding for that; he doesna allow any truck wi such arts.You gave her the ill wish?I was staggered.Geilie drew herself sharply away at this.I didnt give it to her, no.I sold it to her.I stared, trying to meet her eyes through the gathering darkness.Theres a difference?Of course there is.She spoke impatiently.It was a matter of business, was all.And I dont give away my customers secrets.Besides, she didna tell me who it was meant for.And youll remember that I did try to warn ye.Thanks, I said with some sarcasm.But my brain was churning, trying to rearrange my ideas in light of this new information.But if she put the ill wish in my bed, then it was Jamie she wanted.That would explain her sending me to your house.But what about Dougal?Geilie hesitated for a moment, then seemed to come to some decision.The girls no more wi child by Dougal MacKenzie than you are.How can you be so sure?She groped for my hand in the darkness.Finding it, she drew it close and placed it squarely on the swelling bulge beneath her gown.Because I am, she said simply.* * *    Not Laoghaire then, I said.You.Me.She spoke quite simply, without any of her usual affectation.What was it Colum saidIll see that shes done rightly by?Well, I suppose this is his idea of a suitable disposal of the problem.I was silent for a long time, mulling things over.Geilie, I said at last, that stomach trouble of your husbands  She sighed.White arsenic, she said.I thought it would finish him before the child began to show too much, but he hung on longer than I thought possible.I remembered the look of mingled horror and realization on Arthur Duncans face as he burst out of his wifes closet on the last day of his life.I see, I said.He didnt know you were with child until he saw you half dressed, the day of the Dukes banquet.And when he found outI suppose he had good reason to know it wasnt his?There was a faint laugh from the far corner.The saltpeter came dear, but it was worth every farthing.I shuddered slightly, hunched against the wall.But thats why you had to risk killing him in public, at the banquet.He would have denounced you as an adulteressand a poisoner.Or do you think he realized about the arsenic?Oh, Arthur knew, she said.He wouldna admit it, to be surenot even to himself.But he knew.Wed sit across the board from each other at supper, and Id ask, Will ye have a bit more o the cullen skink, my dear?or A sup of ale, my own?And him watching me, with those eyes like boiled eggs, and hed say no, he didna feel himself with an appetite just then.And hed push his plate back, and later Id hear him in the kitchen, secret like, gobbling his food standing by the hutch, thinking himself safe, because he ate no food that came from my hand.Her voice was light and amused as though she had been recounting some bit of juicy gossip.I shuddered again, drawing away from the thing that shared the darkness with me.He didna guess it was in the tonic he took.Hed take no medicine I made; ordered a patent tonic from Londoncost the earth too.Her voice was resentful at the extravagance.The stuff had arsenic in it to start; he didna notice any difference in the taste when I added a bit more.I had always heard that vanity was the besetting weakness of murderers; it seemed this was true, for she went on, ignoring our situation in the pride of recounting her accomplishments.It was a bit risky, to kill him before the whole company like that, but I had to manage something quickly.Not arsenic, either, to kill like that.I remembered the fiscals hard blue lips and the numbness of my own where they had touched him.A quick and deadly poison.And here I had thought that Dougal was confessing to an affair with Laoghaire.But in that case, while Colum might be disapproving, there would have been nothing to prevent Dougal marrying the girl.He was a widower, and free.But an adulterous affair, with the wife of the fiscal?That was a different kettle of fish for all concerned.I seemed to recall that the penalties for adultery were severe.Colum could hardly smooth over an affair of that magnitude, but I couldnt see him condemning his brother to public whipping or banishment.And Geilie might well consider murder a reasonable alternative to being burnt on the face with a hot iron and shut up for several years in a prison, pounding hemp for twelve hours a day.So she had taken her preventive measures, and Colum had taken his.And here was I, caught up in the middle.The child, though?I asked.Surely  There was a grim chuckle in the blackness.Accidents happen, my friend.To the best of us.And once it happened I felt rather than saw her shrug.I meant to get rid of it, but then I thought it might be a way to make him marry me, once Arthur was dead.A horrible suspicion struck me.But Dougals wife was still alive, then.Geillis, did you?Her dress rustled as she shook her head, and I caught a faint gleam from her hair.I meant to, she said.But God saved me the trouble.I rather thought that was a sign, you know.And it might all have worked nicely, too, if not for Colum MacKenzie.I hugged my elbows against the cold.I was talking now only for distraction.Was it Dougal you wanted, or only his position and money?Oh, I had plenty of money, she said, with a note of satisfaction.I knew where Arthur kept the key to all his papers and notes, ye ken.And the man wrote a fair hand, Ill say that for himtwas simple enough to forge his signature.Id managed to divert near on to ten thousand pound over the last two years.But what for?I asked, completely startled.For Scotland.What?For a moment, I thought I had misheard.Then I decided that one of us was possibly a trifle unbalanced.And going on the evidence to hand, it wasnt me.What do you mean, Scotland?I asked cautiously, drawing away a bit.I wasnt sure just how unstable she was; perhaps pregnancy had unhinged her mind.Ye needna fear; Im not mad.The cynical amusement in her voice made me flush, grateful for the darkness.Oh, no?I said, stung.By your own admission, youve committed fraud, theft, and murder.It might be charitable to consider that youre mad, because if youre not  Neither mad nor depraved, she said, decisively.Im a patriot.The light dawned.I let out the breath I had been holding in expectation of a deranged attack.A Jacobite, I said.Holy Christ, youre a bloody Jacobite!She was.And that explained quite a bit.Why Dougal, generally the mirror of his brothers opinions, should have shown such initiative in raising money for the House of Stuart.And why Geillis Duncan, so well equipped to lead any man she wanted to the altar, had chosen two such dissimilar specimens as Arthur Duncan and Dougal MacKenzie.The one for his money and position, the other for his power to influence public opinion.Colum would have been better, she continued.A pity.His misfortune is my own, as well.Its him would have been the one I should have had; the only man Ive seen could be my proper match.Together, we couldwell, no help for it.The one man Id want, and the one man in the world I couldnt touch with the weapon I had.So you took Dougal, instead.Oh, aye, she said, deep in her own thoughts.A strong man, and with some power.A bit of property.The ear of the people.But really, hes no more than the legs, and the cockshe laughed brieflyof Colum MacKenzie.Its Colum has the strength.Almost as much as I have.Her boastful tone annoyed me.Colum has a few small things that you havent, so far as I can see.Such as a sense of compassion.Ah, yes.Bowels of mercy and compassion, is it?She spoke ironically.Much good it may do him.Death sits on his shoulder; ye can see it with half an eye.The man may live two years past Hogmanay; not much longer than that.And how much longer will you live?I asked.The irony turned inward, but the silver voice stayed steady.A bit less than that, I expect.No great matter.Ive managed a good deal in the time I had; ten thousand pounds diverted to France, and the district roused for Prince Charles.Come the Rising, I shall know I helped.If I live so long.She stood nearly under the hole in the roof.My eyes were sufficiently accustomed to the darkness that she showed as a pale shape in the murk, a premature and unlaid ghost.She turned abruptly toward me.Whatever happens with the examiners, I have no regrets, Claire.I regret only that I have but one life to give for my country?I asked ironically.Thats nicely put, she said.Isnt it, just?We fell silent as it grew darker.The black of the hole seemed a tangible force, pressing cold and heavy on my chest, clogging my lungs with the scent of death.At last I huddled into as close a ball as I could, put my head on my knees, and gave up the fight, lapsing into an uneasy doze on the edge between cold and panic.Do ye love the man, then?Geilie asked suddenly.I raised my head from my knees, startled.I had no idea what time it was; one faint star shone overhead, but shed no light into the hole.Who, Jamie?Who else?she said dryly.Its his name ye call out in your sleep.I didnt know I did that.Well, do ye?The cold encouraged a sort of deadly drowsiness, but Geilies prodding voice dragged me a bit further out of my stupor.I hugged my knees, rocking slightly back and forth.The light from the hole above had faded away to the soft dark of early night.The examiners would arrive within the next day or so.It was getting a bit late for prevarications, either to myself or anyone else.While I still found it difficult to admit that I might be in serious danger of death, I was beginning to understand the instinct that made condemned prisoners seek shriving on the eve of execution.Really love him, I mean, Geilie persisted.Not just want to bed him; I know you want that, and he does too.They all do.But do you love him?Did I love him?Beyond the urges of the flesh?The hole had the dark anonymity of the confessional, and a soul on the verge of death had no time for lies.Yes, I said, and laid my head back on my knees.It was silent in the hole for some time, and I hovered once more on the verge of sleep, when I heard her speak once more, as though to herself.So its possible, she said thoughtfully.* * *    The examiners arrived a day later.From the dankness of the thieves hole, we could hear the stir of their arrival; the shouts of the villagers, and the clopping of horses on the stone of the High Street.The bustle grew fainter as the procession passed down the street toward the distant square.Theyve come, said Geilie, listening to the excitement above.We clasped hands reflexively, enmities buried in fear.Well, I said, with attempted bravado, I suppose being burned is better than freezing to death.In the event, we continued to freeze.It was not until noon of the next day that the door of our prison slid abruptly back, and we were pulled out of the pit to be taken to trial.No doubt to accommodate the crowd of spectators, the session was held in the square, before the Duncans house.I saw Geilie glance up briefly at the diamond paned windows of her parlor, then turn away, expressionless.There were two ecclesiastical examiners, seated on padded stools behind a table that had been erected in the square.One judge was abnormally tall and thin, the other short and stout.They reminded me irresistibly of an American comic paper I had once seen; not knowing their names, I mentally christened the tall one Mutt and the other Jeff.Most of the village was there.Looking about, I could see a good many of my former patients.But the inhabitants of the Castle were notably absent.It was John MacRae, locksman of the village of Cranesmuir, who read out the dittay, or indictment, against the persons of one Geillis Duncan and one Claire Fraser, both accused before the Churchs court of the crime of witchcraft.Stating in evidence whereof the accused did cause the death of Arthur Duncan, by means of witchcraft, MacRae read, in a firm, steady voice.And whereas they did procure the death of the unborn child of Janet Robinson, did cause the boat of Thomas MacKenzie to sink, did bring upon the village of Cranesmuir a wasting sickness of the bowels  It went on for some time.Colum had been thorough in his preparations.After the reading of the dittay, the witnesses were called.Most of them were villagers I didnt recognize; none of my own patients were among them, a fact for which I was grateful.While the testimony of many of the witnesses was simply absurd, and other witnesses had plainly been paid for their services, some had a clear ring of truth to their words.Janet Robinson, for example, who was haled before the court by her father, pale and trembling, with a purple bruise on her cheek, to confess that she had conceived a child by a married man, and sought to rid herself of it, through the offices of Geillis Duncan.She gave me a draft to drink, and a charm to say three times, at the rising o the moon, the girl mumbled, glancing fearfully from Geillis to her father, unsure which one posed the greatest threat.She said twould bring my courses on.And did it?Jeff asked with interest.Not at the first, your honor, the girl answered, bobbing her head nervously.But I took the draft again, at the waning o the moon, and then it started.Started?!The lassie near bled to death!An elderly lady, plainly the girls mother, broke in.Twas only because she felt herself to be dyin as she told me the truth o the matter.More than willing to add to the gory details, Mrs.Robinson was shut up with some difficulty, in order to make way for the succeeding witnesses.There seemed to be no one with anything in particular to say about me, aside from the vague accusation that since I had been present at Arthur Duncans death, and had laid hands on him before he died, clearly I must have had something to do with it.I began to think that Geilie was right; I had not been Colums target.That being so, I thought it possible that I would escape.Or at least I thought so until the hill woman appeared.When she came forward, a thin, bowed woman with a yellow shawl, I sensed that we were in serious trouble.She was not one of the villagers; no one I had ever seen before.Her feet were bare, stained with the dust of the road she had walked to come here.Have ye a charge to make against either o the women here?asked the tall, thin judge.The woman was afraid; she wouldnt raise her eyes to look at the judges.She bobbed her head briefly, though, and the crowd quieted its murmur to hear her.Her voice was low, and Mutt had to ask her to repeat herself.She and her husband had an ailing child, born healthy but then turned puny and unthrifty.Finally deciding that the child was a fairy changeling, they had placed it in the Fairys Seat on the hill of Croich Gorm.Keeping watch so as to recover their own child when the fairies should return it, they had seen the two ladies standing here go to the Fairys Seat, pick up the child and speak strange spells over it.The woman twisted her thin hands together, working them under her apron.We watched through the nicht, sirs.And when the dark came, soon after there cam a great demon, a huge black shape comin through the shadows wi no sound, to lean ower the spot where wed laid the babe.There was an awed murmur from the crowd, and I felt the hair on the back of my neck stir slightly, even knowing as I did that the great demon had been Jamie, gone to see whether the child still lived.I braced myself, knowing what was coming next.And when the sun rose, my man and I went to see.And there we found the changeling babe, dead on the hill, and no sign of our own wee bairn.At this, she broke, and threw her apron over her face to hide her weeping.As though the mother of the changeling had been a signal of some sort, the crowd parted and the figure of Peter the drover came out.I groaned inwardly when I saw him.I had felt the emotions of the crowd turn against me as the woman spoke; all I needed now was for this man to tell the court about the waterhorse.Enjoying his moment of celebrity, the drover drew himself up and pointed dramatically at me.Tis right ye are to call her witch, my lords!Wi my own eyes I saw this woman call up a waterhorse from the waters of the Evil Loch, to do her bidding!A great fearsome creature, sirs, tall as a pine tree, wi a neck like a great blue snake, an eyes big as apples, wi a look in them as would steal the soul from a man.The judges appeared impressed with his testimony, and whispered between themselves for several minutes, while Peter glared defiantly at me, with a thatll show you!sort of look.At length, the fat judge broke from the conference and beckoned imperiously to John MacRae, who stood to one side, alert for trouble.Locksman!he said.He turned and pointed at the drover.Tak that man away and shut him up in the pillory for public drunkenness.This is a solemn coort o law; well no ha the time of the examiners wasted by frivolous accusations from a sot who sees waterhorses when hes taken too much whisky!Peter the drover was so astonished that he did not even resist as the locksman strode firmly forward and took him by the arm.Mouth hanging open, he glared back wildly in my direction as he was led away.I couldnt resist fluttering my fingers in a tiny salute after him.After this slight break in the tension of the proceedings, though, things got rapidly worse.There was a procession of girls and women to swear that they had bought charms and philtres from Geillis Duncan, for purposes such as causing illness, ridding oneself of an unwanted babe, or casting spells of love upon some man.All, without exception, swore that the charms had workedan enviable record for a general practitioner, I thought cynically.While no one claimed such results for me, there were several to saytruthfullythat they had seen me often in Mrs.Duncans herb room, mixing medicines and grinding herbs.Still, that might not have been fatal; there were an equal number of people to claim that I had healed them, using nothing more than ordinary medicines, with nothing in the way of spells, charms, or general hocus pocus.Given the force of public opinion, it took some nerve for these people to step forward to testify in my behalf, and I was grateful.My feet were aching from standing so long; while the judges sat in relative comfort, no stools were provided for the prisoners.But when the next witness appeared, I entirely forgot my feet.With an instinct for drama that rivaled Colums, Father Bain flung wide the door of the kirk and emerged into the square, limping heavily on an oaken crutch.He advanced slowly to the center of the square, inclined his head to the judges, then turned and surveyed the crowd, until his steely glare had reduced the noise to a low, uneasy muttering.When he spoke, his voice lashed out like the crack of a whip.Its a judgment on ye, ye folk o Cranesmuir!Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth with his feet.Aye, yeve allowed yerselves to be seduced from the paths o righteousness!Yeve sown the wind, and the whirlwinds amongst ye now!I stared, somewhat taken aback by this unsuspected gift for rhetoric.Or perhaps he was capable of such flights of oratory only under the stimulus of crisis.The florid voice thundered on.The pestilence will come upon ye, and ye shall die o your sins, unless ye be cleansed!Yeve welcomed the whore of Babylon into yer midstThat was me, I assumed, from the glare he shot at meYeve sold your soul to your enemies, yeve taken the English viper to your bosom, and now the vengeance o the Lord God Almighty is on ye.Deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger that flattereth with her words.For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.Repent, people, before its too late!Fall to your knees, I say, and pray for forgiveness!Cast out the English whore, and renounce your bargain wi the spawn o Satan!He snatched the rosary from his belt and brandished the large wooden crucifix in my direction.Entertaining as this all was, I could see Mutt becoming rather restive.Professional jealousy, perhaps.Er, your Reverence, the judge said, with a slight bow in Father Bains direction, have ye evidence to bring as to the charge regarding these women?That I have.The first explosion of oratory spent, the little priest was calm now.He leveled a menacing forefinger in my direction and I had to brace myself to keep from taking a step backward.At noonday on a Tuesday, two weeks past, I met this woman in the gardens of Castle Leoch.Using unnatural powers, she called down a pack of hounds upon me, such that I fell before them, and was in mortal peril.Bein wounded grievously in the leg, I made to leave her presence.The woman tried to lure me wi her sinfulness, to go awa in private with her, and when I resisted her wiles, she cast a curse upon me.What bloody nonsense!I said indignantly.Thats the most ridiculous exaggeration Ive ever heard!Father Bains eye, dark and glittering as with fever, swiveled from the examiners and fixed on me.Do ye deny, woman, that ye said these words to me?Come with me now, priest, or your wound shall fester and go putrid?Well, tone it down a bit, but something to that effect, perhaps, I admitted.Jaw clenched in triumph, the priest whipped aside the skirts of his soutane.A bandage stained with dried blood and wet with yellow pus encircled his thigh.The pale flesh of the leg puffed above and below the bandage, with ominous red streaks extending up from the hidden wound.Jesus Christ, man!I said, shocked at the sight.Youve got blood poisoning.You need it tended, and right now, or youll die!There was a deep murmur of shock from the crowd.Even Mutt and Jeff seemed a bit stunned.Father Bain shook his head slowly.You hear?he demanded.The temerity of the woman kens nae bounds.She curses me wi death, a man of God, before the judgment seat of the kirk itself!The excited murmuring of the crowd grew louder.Father Bain spoke again, raising his voice slightly in order to be heard over the noise.I leave ye, gentlemen, wi the judgment o your own senses, and the injunction o the LordYe shallna suffer a witch to live!* * *    Father Bains dramatic evidence put a stop to the testimony.Presumably no one was prepared to top that performance.The judges called a short recess and were brought refreshments from the inn.No such amenities were forthcoming for the accused.I braced myself and pulled experimentally against my bonds.The leather of the straps creaked a bit, but didnt give an inch.This, I thought cynically, trying to still my panic, was surely where the dashing young hero was meant to ride through the crowd, beating back the cringing townspeople and scooping the fainting heroine up onto his saddle.But my own dashing young hero was out in the forest somewhere, swilling ale with an aging poofter of noble blood and slaughtering innocent deer.It was rather unlikely, I thought, gritting my teeth, that Jamie would return in time even to gather up my ashes for ceremonial disposal, before I was scattered to the four winds.Preoccupied with my growing fear, I didnt at first hear the hoofbeats.It was only as the faint murmurs and head turnings of the crowd attracted my attention that I noticed the rhythmic clopping, ringing from the stones of the High Street.The murmurs of surprise grew louder, and the fringes of the crowd began to draw apart to admit the rider, still beyond the range of my sight.Despite my earlier despair, I began to feel a faint flicker of illogical hope.What if Jamie had come back early?Perhaps the Dukes advances had been too pressing, or the deer too few and far between.Whatever it might be, I strained on tiptoe to see the face of the approaching rider.The ranks of the crowd parted reluctantly as the horse, a strong bay, poked its long nose between two sets of shoulders.Before the astonished eyes of everyoneincluding methe sticklike figure of Ned Gowan spryly dismounted.Jeff surveyed the spare, neat form before him with some astonishment.And you are, sir?No doubt his tone of reluctant courtesy was a result of the visitors silver shoe buckles and velvet coatemployment with the laird of clan MacKenzie was not without its compensations.My name is Edward Gowan, your lordship, he said precisely.Solicitor.Mutt hunched his shoulders and wriggled a bit; the stool he had been provided had no back, and his lengthy torso was no doubt feeling the strain.I stared hard at him, wishing him a herniated lumbar disk.If I were about to be burnt for having an evil eye, I thought, let it count for something.Solicitor?he rumbled.What brings you here, then?Ned Gowans grey peruke inclined itself in the most precise of formal bows.I have come to offer my humble services in the support of Mistress Fraser, your lordships, he said, a most gracious lady, whom I know of my own witness to be as kind and beneficial in the administration of the healing arts as she is knowledgeable in their application.Very nice, I thought approvingly.Get a blow in for our side first thing.Looking across the square, I could see Geilies mouth quirk up in a half admiring, half derisive smile.While Ned Gowan wouldnt be everyones choice as Prince Charming, I was not inclined to be picky at a time like this.I would take my champions as they came.With a bow to the judges and another, no less formal, to myself, Mr.Gowan drew himself still straighter than his normal upright posture, braced both thumbs in the waist of his breeks, and prepared with all the romanticism of his aged, gallant heart to do battle, fighting with the laws chosen weapon of excruciating boredom.Boring he most certainly was.With the deadly precision of an automated mincing machine, he arranged each charge of the dittay on the slab of his scrutiny and diced it ruthlessly into shreds with the blade of statute and the cleaver of precedent.It was a noble performance.He talked.And he talked.And he talked some more, seeming occasionally to pause respectfully for instruction from the bench, but in fact only drawing breath for another onslaught of verbiage.With my life hanging in the balance, and my future entirely dependent on the eloquence of this skinny little man, I should have hung rapt on his every word.Instead, I found myself yawning appallingly, unable to cover my gaping mouth, and shifting from foot to aching foot, wishing fervently that they would burn me at once and end this torture.The crowd appeared to feel much the same, and as the high excitement of the morning faded into ennui, Mr.Gowans small, tidy voice went on and on and on.People began to drift away, suddenly mindful of beasts that needed milking and floors that wanted sweeping, secure in the surety that nothing of any interest could possibly happen while that deadly voice droned on.When Ned Gowan finally finished his initial defense, evening had set in; and the squatty judge I had named Jeff announced that the court would reconvene in the morning.After a short, muttering conference amongst Ned Gowan, Jeff, and John MacRae the locksman, I was led off toward the inn between two burly townsmen.Casting a glance over my shoulder, I saw Geilie being moved away in the opposite direction, back straight, refusing to be hurried, or for that matter, to acknowledge her surroundings in any way.In the dark back room of the inn, my bonds were at last removed, and a candle brought.Then Ned Gowan arrived, bearing a bottle of ale and a plate of meat and bread.Ive but the few minutes with ye, my dear, and that hard won, so listen closely.The little man leaned nearer, conspiratorial in the flickering candlelight.His eyes were bright, and save a slight disarrangement of his peruke, he gave no hint of exertion or fatigue.Mr.Gowan, I am so glad to see you, I said sincerely.Yes, yes, my dear, he said, but theres no time for that now.He patted my hand in a kindly but perfunctory fashion.Ive succeeded in getting them to consider your case as separate from that of Mrs.Duncan, and that may be of help.It would appear that there was no original intent to arrest you, but that you were taken because of your association with the wwith Mrs.Duncan.Still, he continued briskly, there is some danger to ye, and Ill not hide it from you.The climate of opinion in the village is none too favorable to ye at present.What possessed ye, he demanded, with uncharacteristic heatedness, to touch that child?I opened my mouth to reply, but he waved the question aside impatiently.Ah, well, its of no matter now.What we must do is to play upon the fact of your Englishnessand hence your ignorance, ye ken, not your strangenessand draw matters out so long as we may.Time is on our side, ye see, for the worst of these trials take place in a climate of hysteria, when the soundness of evidence may be disregarded for the sake of satisfyin blood hunger.Blood hunger.That captured completely the feeling of the emotion I had felt emanating from the faces of the mob.Here and there I saw some traces of doubt or sympathy, but it was a rare soul who would stand against a crowd, and Cranesmuir was rather lacking in characters of that stamp.Or no, I corrected myself.There was onethis dry little Edinburgh lawyer, tough as the old boot he so strongly resembled.The longer we go on, Mr.Gowan continued matter of factly, the less inclined anyone will be to take hasty action.So, he said, hands on his knees, your part on the morrow is only to keep silent.I shall do all the talkin, and pray God it will be to some effect.That seems sound enough, I said, with a weary attempt at a smile.I glanced at the door to the front of the inn, where voices were being raised.Catching my look, Mr.Gowan nodded.Aye, Ill have to leave ye momentarily.Ive arranged that youll spend the night here.He glanced around dubiously.A small shed tacked on to the inn, and used mostly for the storage of oddments and spare supplies, it was cold and dark, but an improvement of several fold over the thieves hole.The door to the shed opened, silhouetting the form of the inn keeper, peering into the dark behind the pale waver of a candle flame.Mr.Gowan rose to go, but I gripped him by the sleeve.There was one thing I needed to know.Mr.Gowandid Colum send you to help me?He hesitated in his reply, but within the limits of his profession, he was a man of irreproachable honesty.No, he said bluntly.A look almost of embarrassment flitted over his withered features, and he added, I came forfor myself.He clapped his hat upon his head and turned to the door, wishing me a brief Good een, before disappearing into the light and bustle of the inn.There had been little preparation for my accommodation, but a small jug of wine and a loaf of breadclean, this timesat on one of the hogsheads, and there was an old blanket folded on the ground at its foot.I wrapped myself in the blanket and sat down on one of the smaller casks to dine, musing as I munched the sparse fare.So Colum had not sent the lawyer.Had he known, even, that Mr.Gowan intended to come?Chances were that Colum had forbidden anyone to come down to the village, for fear of being caught up in the witch hunt.The waves of fear and hysteria that swept over the village were palpable; I could feel them beating against the walls of my flimsy shelter.A noisy outburst from the nearby taproom distracted me from my thoughts.Perhaps it was only deathwatch plus one.But on the edge of destruction, even an extra hour was cause for thanks.I rolled myself up in the blanket, pulled it over my head to shut out the noises from the inn, and tried very hard to feel nothing but gratitude.* * *    After an exceedingly restless night, I was roused soon after dawn and marched back out to the square, though the judges didnt arrive for another hour.Fine, fat, and full of breakfast, they buckled straight down to work.Jeff turned to John MacRae, who had returned to his station behind the accused.We find ourselves unable to determine guilt solely on the basis of the evidence presented.There was a burst of outrage from the regathered crowd, which had made its own determination, but this was quelled by Mutt, who turned a pair of eyes like gimlets on the young workmen in the front row, quieting their yapping like dogs doused with cold water.Order restored, he turned his angular face back to the locksman.Conduct the prisoners to the loch side, if ye please.There was a pleased sound of expectation at this that roused all my worst suspicions.John MacRae took me by one arm and Geilie by the other, to steer us along, but he had plenty of help.Vicious hands tore at my gown, pinching and pushing as I was yanked along.Some idiot had a drum, and was beating out a ragged tattoo.The crowd was chanting in a rough rhythm to the tuck of the drum, something that I didnt catch among the random shouts and cries.I didnt think I wanted to know what they were saying.The procession flowed down the meadow to the edge of the loch, where a small wooden quay projected into the water.We were pulled out to the end of this, where the two judges had taken up their posts, one at either side of the quay.Jeff turned to the crowd waiting onshore.Bring out the cords!There was a general mutter and expectant looking around from one to another, until someone ran up hastily with a length of thin rope.MacRae took it and approached me rather hesitantly.He stole a glance at the examiners, though, which seemed to harden his resolve.Please be so kind as to remove your shoon, Maam, he ordered.What the he, what for?
