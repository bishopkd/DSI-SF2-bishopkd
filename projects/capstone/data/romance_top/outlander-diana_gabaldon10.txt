He hurt mehurt me badlywhile he did it, but it was an act of love to him.And he made me answer himdamn his soul!He made me rouse to him!The hand bunched into a fist and struck the bedframe with an impotent rage that made the whole bed tremble.Thefirst time, he was verra careful with me.He used oil, and took a long time, rubbing it all over metouchin me gentle in all my parts.I could no more stop myself rising to his touch than I could stop myself bleeding when he cut me.Jamies voice was weary and wretched with despair.He paused, and looked directly at me for the first time since I had come in.Claire, I did not want to think of you.I couldna bear to be there, naked, andlike thatand to remember loving you.It was blasphemy.I meant to wipe you from my mind, and only toexist, so long as I must.But he would not allow it.Wetness shone on his cheeks, but he was not crying now.He talked.All during it, he talked to me.Partly it was threats, and partly it was love talk, but often it was you.Me?My voice, unused for so long, came out of my strained throat as little more than a croak.He nodded, looking down at the pillow again.Aye.He was most terribly jealous of you, you know.No.No, I didnt know.He nodded again.Oh, yes.He would ask mewhile he touched mehe would ask, Does she do this for you?Can your woman r rouse you like this?His voice trembled.I wouldna answer himI couldnt.And then, hed ask how I thought you would feel to see meto see me He bit his lip hard, unable to go on for a moment.Hed hurt me a bit, then stop and love me til I began to rouseand then hed hurt me fierce and take me in the midst of the hurting.And all the time, he would talk of you, and keep you before my eyes.I fought, in my mindI tried to keep myself from him, to keep my mind apart from my body, but the pain broke through, again and again, past every barrier I could put up.I tried, ClaireGod, I tried so hard, but  He sank his head in his hands, fingers digging hard into his temples.He spoke abruptly.I know why young Alex MacGregor hanged himself.Id do the same, did I not know it to be mortal sin.If hes damned me in life, hell not do so in heaven.There was a moments silence while he struggled to control himself.I noticed automatically that the pillow on his knees was blotched with dampness, and wanted to get up and change it for him.He shook his head slowly, still gazing down at his feet.Theits all linked for me now.I canna think of you, Claire, even of kissing you or touching your hand, without feeling the fear and the pain and the sickness come back.I lie here feeling that I will die without your touch, but when you touch me, I feel as though I will vomit with shame and loathing of myself.I canna even see you now without His forehead rested on knotted fists, knuckles dug hard into his eye sockets.The tendons of his neck were sharply etched with strain, and his voice came half muffled.Claire, I want you to leave me.Go back to Scotland, to Craigh na Dun.Go back to your place, to yourhusband.Murtagh will take you safe, Ive told him.He was silent for a moment, and I did not move.He looked up again with desperate bravery, and spoke very simply.I will love you as long as I live, but I cannot be your husband any longer.And I will not be less to you.His face began to break apart.Claire, I want you so badly that my bones shake in my body, but God help me, I am afraid to touch you!I started up to go to him, but he stopped me with a sudden motion of his hand.He was half doubled up, face contorted with internal struggle, and his voice was strangled and breathless.Claireplease.Please go.Im going to be verra sick, and I dont want you to see it.Please.I heard the pleading in his voice and knew I must spare him this one indignity, at least.I rose, and for the first time in my professional life, left a sick man to his own devices, helpless and alone.* * *    I left his chamber, numbed, and leaned against the white stone wall outside, cooling my flushed cheek against the unyielding blocks, ignoring the stares of Murtagh and Brother William.God help me, he had said.God help me, I am afraid to touch you.I straightened and stood alone.Well, why not?Surely there was no one else.* * *    At the hour when time began to slow, I genuflected in the aisle of the chapel of St.Giles.Anselm was there, elegant shoulders straight beneath his habit, but no other.He neither moved nor looked around, but the living silence of the chapel embraced me.I remained on my knees for a moment, reaching out to the quiet darkness, staying my mind from its hurry.Only when I felt my heart slow to the rhythms of the night did I slide into a seat near the back.I sat rigid, lacking the form and ritual, the liturgical courtesies that eased the brothers into the depths of their sacred conversation.I did not know how to begin.Finally, I said, silently, bluntly, I need help.Please.And then I let the silence fall back in waves around me, lapping me like the folds of a cloak, comforting against the cold.And I waited, as Anselm had told me, and the minutes passed by uncounted.There was a small table at the back of the chapel, covered with a linen cloth, bearing the stoup of holy water, and beside it, a Bible and two or three other inspirational works.For use by adorers for whom the silence was too much, I supposed.It was becoming too much for me, and I rose and got the Bible, bringing it back to the prie dieu with me.I was hardly the first person to have recourse to the sortes Virgilianae in time of confusion or trouble.There was sufficient light from the candles for me to read, turning the flimsy pages carefully and squinting over the lines of fine black type.and he smote them with emerods, and they were very sore.No doubt they were, I thought.What in hell were emerods?Try Psalms, instead.But I am a worm, and no manI am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.Well, yes, a competent diagnosis, I thought, with some impatience.But was there some treatment?But be not thou far from me, O Lord: O my strength, haste thee to help me.Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.Hmm.I turned to the Book of Job, Jamies favorite.Surely if anyone was in a position to offer helpful advice.But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.Mmm, yes, I thought, and turned the page.He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain.His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.Spot on, I thought.What next?Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.Not so good, but the next bit was more heartening.If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.His flesh shall be fresher than a childs: he shall return to the days of his youth.And what was the ransom, then, that would buy a mans soul, and deliver my darling from the power of the dog?I closed the book and my eyes.The words muddled together, blurring with my urgent need.An overriding misery struck me when I spoke Jamies name.And yet there was some small peace there, a lessening of tension when I said, as I did over and over again, O Lord, into thy hands I commend the soul of your servant James.The thought came to me that perhaps Jamie would be better off dead; he had said he wanted to die.I was morally sure that if I left him as he wished, he would be dead soon, whether from the aftereffects of torture and illness, from hanging, or in some battle.And I was in no doubt that he knew it as well.Ought I to do as he said?Damned if I will, I said to myself.Damned if I will, I said fiercely to the sunburst on the altar and opened the book again.It was some time before I became aware that my thread of petition was no longer a monologue.In fact, I knew it only when I realized that I had just answered a question I had no memory of asking.In my trance of sleepless misery, something had been asked of me, I wasnt sure just what, and I had answered without thinking, Yes, I will.I stopped all thought abruptly, listening to the ringing silence.And then, more cautiously, repeated, voiceless, Yes.Yes, I will, and thought fleetingly, The conditions of sin are these: first, you must give your full consent to it.And the conditions of grace as well, came an echo of Anselms quiet voice.There was a feeling, not sudden, but complete, as though I had been given a small object to hold unseen in my hands.Precious as opal, smooth as jade, weighty as a river stone, more fragile than a birds egg.Infinitely still, live as the root of Creation.Not a gift, but a trust.Fiercely to cherish, softly to guard.The words spoke themselves and disappeared into the groined shadows of the roof.I genuflected to the Presence then, and left the chapel, never doubting, in the eternity of the moment when time stops, that I had an answer, but having no idea what that answer was.I knew only that what I held was a human soul; my own or anothers, I could not tell.* * *    It did not appear to be an answer to prayer, when I woke to the resumption of ordinary time in the morning to find a lay brother standing over me, telling me that Jamie was burning with fever.How long has he been like this?I asked, laying a practiced hand on brow and back, armpit and groin.No trace of relieving sweat; only the dry stretched skin of persistent parching, fiery with heat.He was awake, but heavy eyed and groggy.The source of the fever was plain.The shattered right hand was puffy, with a foul smelling ooze soaking the bandages.Ominous red streaks ran up the wrist.A bloody infection, I thought to myself.A filthy, suppurating, blood poisoning, life threatening infection.I found him so when I came to look in on him after Matins, replied the serving brother who had come to fetch me.I gave him water, but he began to vomit just after dawn.You should have fetched me at once, I said.Still, never mind.Bring me hot water, raspberry leaves, and Brother Polydore, as quickly as possible.He left with the assurance that he would see some breakfast was brought for me as well, but I waved such amenities aside, reaching for the pewter jug of water.By the time Brother Polydore appeared, I had tried the internal application of water, only to have it violently rejected, and was applying it externally instead, soaking the sheets and wrapping them loosely over the hot skin.Simultaneously, I set the infected hand to soak in fresh boiled water, as hot as could be stood without burning the skin.Lacking sulfa drugs or modern antibiotics, heat was the only defense against a bacterial infection.The patients body was doing its best to supply that heat by means of high fever, but the fever itself posed a serious danger, wasting muscle and damaging brain cells.The trick was to apply sufficient local heat to destroy the infection, while keeping the rest of the body cool enough to prevent damage, and sufficiently hydrated to maintain its normal functions.A bloody three tier balancing act, I thought bleakly.Neither Jamies state of mind nor his physical discomfort were relevant any longer.It was a straightforward struggle to keep him alive until the infection and the fever ran their course; nothing else mattered.In the afternoon of the second day, he began to hallucinate.We tied him to the bed with soft rags to prevent his hurling himself to the floor.Finally, as a desperate measure to break the fever, I sent one of the lay brothers out to bring in a bushel basket of snow, which we packed around him.This resulted in a violent shivering fit that left him drained and exhausted, but did briefly bring his temperature down.Unfortunately, the treatment had to be repeated at hourly intervals.By sunset, the room looked like a swamp, with puddles of melted snow standing on the floor, tussocks of sodden sheeting mounded among them, and steam like marsh gas rising from the brazier in the corner.Brother Polydore and myself were sodden, too, soaked with sweat, chilled with snow water, and near to exhaustion, in spite of the helpful assistance of Anselm and the lay brothers.Febrifuges such as coneflower, goldenseal, catnip, and hyssop had been tried, without effect.Willowbark tea, which might have helped with its content of salicylic acid, could not be consumed in amounts large enough to matter.In one of his increasingly rare lucid intervals, Jamie asked me to let him die.I answered curtly, as I had the night before, Damned if I will, and went on with what I was doing.As the sun went down, there was a stir of approaching men in the corridor.The door opened and the abbot, Jamies uncle Alex, came in, accompanied by Brother Anselm and three other monks, one carrying a small cedarwood box.The abbot came over to me and blessed me briefly, then took one of my hands in his.We are going to anoint the lad, he said, his deep voice kind.Do not be frightened.He turned toward the bed and I looked wildly to Anselm for explanation.The sacrament of Extreme Unction, he explained, moving close so that his low tones would not disturb the monks gathered around the bed.The Last Anointing.Last Anointing!Thats for people who are dying!Ssh.He drew me farther away from the bed.It might more properly be called anointing of the sick, though in fact it is usually reserved for those in danger of death.The monks had turned Jamie gently onto his back, arranging him tenderly so that he might lie with the least hurt to his raw shoulders.The purpose of the sacrament is twofold, Anselm went on, murmuring in my ear as the preparations went on.First, it is intended as a sacrament of healing; we pray that the sufferer may be restored to health, if that be Gods will for him.The chrism, the consecrated oil, is used as a symbol of life and healing.And the second purpose?I asked, already knowing.Anselm nodded.If it is not Gods will that he should recover, then he is given absolution of sins, and we commend him to God, that his soul may depart in peace.He saw me tighten in protest, and laid a warning hand on my arm.These are the last rites of the Church.He is entitled to them, and to whatever peace they may bring him.The preparations were complete.Jamie lay on his back, a cloth modestly draped across his loins, with lighted candles at the head and the foot of the bed that reminded me most unpleasantly of grave lights.Abbot Alexander sat at the bedside, accompanied by a monk who held a tray with a covered ciborium, two small silver bottles containing holy water and chrism, and a white cloth draped across both forearms.Like a bloody wine steward, I thought crossly.The whole procedure unnerved me.The rites were conducted in Latin, the soft antiphonal murmuring soothing to the ear, though I did not understand the meaning.Anselm whispered softly to me the meaning of some parts of the service; others were self explanatory.At one point, the Abbot motioned to Polydore, who stepped forward and held a small vial under Jamies nose.It must have contained spirits of ammonia or some other stimulant, because he jerked and turned his head away sharply, eyes still closed.Why are they trying to wake him?I whispered.If possible, the person should be conscious in order to give assent to the statement that he is sorry for any sins committed during his life.Also, if he is capable of receiving it, the Abbot will give him the Blessed Sacrament.The Abbot stroked Jamies cheek softly, turning his head back to the vial, speaking quietly to him.He had dropped from Latin into the broad Scots of their family, and his voice was gentle.Jamie!Jamie, lad!Its Alex, lad.Im here wi ye.Ye must wake a bit now, only for a bit.I shall be givin ye the absolution now, and then the Blessed Sacrament of Our Lord.Take a wee sup, now, so ye can answer me when ye must.The monk called Polydore held the cup against Jamies lips, carefully pouring the water a drop at a time, until the parched tongue and throat could take more.His eyes were open, still heavy with fever, but alert enough.The Abbot went on then, the questions in English, but pitched so low that I could scarcely catch them.Do ye renounce Satan and all his works?Do ye believe in the Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ?and so on.To each one, Jamie answered Aye, in a scratchy whisper.Once the sacrament had been given, Jamie lay back with a sigh, closing his eyes once more.I could see his ribs as the deep sprung chest moved with his breathing.He had wasted dreadfully, between the sickness and the fever.The Abbot, taking the vials of holy water and chrism in turn, made the sign of the Cross on his body, anointing forehead, lips, nose, ears, and eyelids.Then, in turn, he made the sign of the Cross with the holy oil in the hollow of the chest over the heart, on the palm of each hand, and the arch of each foot.He lifted the injured hand with infinite care, brushing the oil across the wound lightly and laying the hand back on Jamies chest, where it lay below the livid slash of the knife scar.The anointing was quick and immeasurably gentle, a feather touch by the Abbots rapidly moving thumb.Superstitious magic, said the rational side of my brain, but I was deeply moved by the love on the faces of the monks as they prayed.Jamies eyes were open once more, but very calm, and his face was peaceful for the first time since we had left Lallybroch.The ceremony concluded with a brief prayer in Latin.Laying his hand on Jamies head, the Abbot said in English, Lord, into thy hands we commend the soul of your servant, James.Heal him, we pray, if that be Thy will, and strengthen his soul, that he may be filled with grace, and know Thy peace throughout eternity.Amen, replied the other monks.And so did I.* * *    By dark, the patient had lapsed into semiconsciousness again.As Jamies strength waned, it was all we could do to rouse him for the sips of water that were keeping him alive.His lips were cracked and peeling, and he could no longer talk, though he would still open glazed eyes when shaken roughly.He no longer recognized us; his eyes stared fixedly, then gradually closed as he turned his head away, moaning.I stood by the bed looking down at him, so exhausted from the rigors of the day that I felt no more than a sort of dull despair.Brother Polydore touched me gently, bringing me out of my daze.You cannot do any more for him now, he said, leading me firmly away.You must go and rest.But I began, then stopped.He was right, I realized.We had done everything possible.Either the fever would break soon of itself, or Jamie would die.Even the strongest body could not endure the consuming ravages of high fever for more than a day or two, and Jamie had little strength left to see him through such a siege.I will stay with him, Polydore said.Go to your bed.Ill summon you if He didnt finish the sentence, but waved me gently in the direction of my own chamber.I lay sleepless on my cot, staring at the beamed ceiling.My eyes were dry and hot, and my throat ached, as though I were coming down with a fever as well.Was this the answer to my prayer, that we would die here together?At last I rose, and took up the jug and basin from the table by the door.I set the heavy pottery dish in the center of the floor and filled it carefully, letting the water swell up over the thickened rim into a trembling bubble.I had made a short detour to Brother Ambroses stillroom on the way to my chamber.I undid the small packets of herbs and scattered the contents into my brazier, where the myrrh leaves gave off a fragrant smoke, and the crumbs of camphor flamed with tiny blue tongues between the red glow of the charcoal sticks.I set the candlestick behind my reflecting pool, took my place before it, and sat down to summon a ghost.* * *    The stone corridor was cold and dark, lit at intervals by dimly flickering oil lamps hung from the ceiling.My shadow stretched forward under my feet as I passed beneath each one, lengthening until it seemed to dive headfirst and disappear into the dark ahead.In spite of the cold, I was barefoot and wearing only a coarse white cotton nightrobe.A small envelope of warmth moved with me under the robe, but the chill from the stones crept up my feet and legs.I knocked once, softly, and pushed open the heavy door without waiting for an answer.Brother Roger was with him, sitting by the bed, telling beads with bowed head.The wooden rosary rattled as he looked up, but his lips continued to move silently for a few seconds, finishing the Ave Maria before acknowledging my presence.He met me near the door, speaking quietly, though it was clear that he could have shouted without disturbing the motionless figure on the bed.No change.Ive just put fresh water in the hand bath.A few drops gleamed on the sides of the small pewter kettle on the brazier, freshly filled.I nodded and put a hand on his arm in thanks.It was startlingly solid and warm after the imaginations of the last hour, and somehow comforting.Id like to stay with him alone, if you dont mind.Of course.Ill go to the chapelor should I stay near in case His voice trailed off, hesitant.No.I tried to smile reassuringly.Go to the chapel.Or better yet, go to bed.I cant sleep; Ill stay here til morning.If I need help, Ill send for you.Still dubious, he glanced back at the bed.But it was very late, and he was tired; there were shadows under the kind brown eyes.The heavy door squeaked on its hinges, and I was alone with Jamie.Alone and afraid, and very, very doubtful about what I proposed to do.I stood at the foot of the bed, watching him for a moment.The room was dimly lit by the glow of the brazier and by two enormous candlesticks, each nearly three feet tall, that stood on the table at the side of the room.He was naked, and the faint light seemed to accentuate the hollows left by the wasting fever.The multicolored bruise over the ribs stained the skin like a spreading fungus.A dying man takes on a faint greenish tinge.At first just a touch at the edge of the jaw, this pallor spreads gradually, over the face and down the chest as the force of life begins to ebb.I had seen it many times.A few times, I had seen that deadly progress arrested and reversed, the skin flush with blood once more, and the man live.More oftenI shook myself vigorously and turned away.I brought my hand out of the folds of my robe and laid on the table the objects I had collected in a surreptitious visit to Brother Ambroses darkened workshop.A vial of spirits of ammonia.A packet of dried lavender.Another of valerian.A small metal incense burner, shaped like an open blossom.Two pellets of opium, sweet scented and sticky with resin.And a knife.The room was close and stuffy with smoke from the brazier.The only window was covered with a heavy tapestry, one showing the execution of Saint Sebastian.I eyed the saints upturned face and arrow punctured torso, wondering afresh at the mentality of the person who had chosen this particular decoration for a sickroom.Indifferently rendered as it was, the tapestry was of heavy silk and wool, and excluded all but the strongest drafts.I lifted the lower edge and flapped it, urging the charcoal smoke out through the stone arch.The cold, damp air that streamed in was refreshing, and did something to calm the throbbing that had started in my temples as I stared into the reflecting water, remembering.There was a faint moan behind me, and Jamie stirred in the draft.Good.He was not deeply unconscious, then.Letting the tapestry fall back over the window, I next took up the incense burner.I fixed one of the opium pellets on the spike and lighted it with one of the wax tapers for the candlesticks.I placed it on the small table near Jamies head, careful not to inhale the sickly fumes myself.There was not much time.I must finish my preparations quickly, before the opium smoke drove him too far under to be roused.I unlaced the front of my robe and rubbed my body quickly with handfuls of the lavender and valerian.It was a pleasant, spicy smell, distinctive and richly evocative.A smell that, to me, conjured the shade of the man who wore its perfume, and the shade of the man behind him; shades that evoked confusing images of present terror and lost love.A smell that, to Jamie, must recall the hours of pain and rage spent wrapped in its waves.I rubbed the last of it vigorously between my palms and dropped the fragrant shreds on the floor.With a deep breath for courage, I picked up the vial of ammoniacal spirits.I stood by the bed a moment holding it, looking down at the gaunt, stubbled face.At most he might last a day; at the least, only a few more hours.All right, you bloody Scottish bastard, I said softly.Lets see how stubborn you really are.I lifted the injured hand, dripping, from the water and set the soaking dish aside.I opened the vial and waved it closely under his nose.He snorted and tried to turn his head away, but didnt open his eyes.I dug my fingers into the hair on the back of his head to prevent his turning away, and brought the vial back to his face.He shook his head slowly, swinging it from side to side like an ox roused from slumber, and his eyes came open just a crack.Not done yet, Fraser, I whispered in his ear, trying as best I could to catch the rhythm of Randalls clipped consonants.Jamie moaned and hunched his shoulders.I grasped him by both shoulders and shook him roughly.His skin was so hot I nearly let go.Wake up, you Scottish bastard!Im not done with you yet!He began to struggle up onto his elbows with a pitiful effort at obedience that nearly broke my heart.His head was still shaking back and forth, and the cracked lips were muttering something that sounded like please not yet over and over again.Strength failing, he rolled to one side and collapsed facedown on the pillow again.The room was beginning to fill with opium smoke and I felt mildly dizzy.I gritted my teeth and plunged my hand between his buttocks, gripping one curving round.He screamed, a high breathy sound, and rolled painfully sideways, curling into a ball with his hands clasped between his legs.I had spent the hour in my chamber, hovering over my pool of reflection, conjuring memories.Of Black Jack Randall and of Frank, his six times great grandson.Such very different men, but with such startling physical similarities.It tore me to think of Frank, to recall his face and voice, his mannerisms, his style of lovemaking.I had tried to obliterate him from my mind, once my choice was made in the circle of stone, but he was always there, a shadowy figure in the recesses of my mind.I felt sick with betrayal of him, but in the extremity I had forced my mind to clear as Geilie had shown me, concentrating on the flame of the candle, breathing the astringency of the herbs, calming myself until I could bring him from the shadows, see the lines of his face, feel once more the touch of his hand without weeping.There was another man in the shadows, with the same hands, the same face.Eyes filled with the candle flame, I had brought him forward, too, listening, watching, seeing the likenesses and the differences, building aa what?A simulacrum, a persona, an impression, a masquerade.A shaded face, a whispered voice, and a loving touch that I might bring to deceive a mind adrift in delirium.And I left my chamber at last, with a prayer for the soul of the witch Geillis Duncan.Jamie was on his back now, writhing slightly against the pain of his wounds.His eyes were fixed and staring, with no sign of recognition.I caressed him in the way I knew so well, tracing the line of his ribs from breastbone to back, lightly as Frank would have done, pressing hard on the aching bruise, as I was sure the other would have.I leaned forward and ran my tongue slowly around his ear, tasting and probing, and whispered, Fight me!Fight back, you filthy scut!His muscles tightened and his jaw clenched, but he continued to stare upward.No choice, then.I would have to use the knife after all.I knew the risk I was taking in this, but better to kill him myself, I thought, than to sit quietly by and let him die.I took the knife from the table and drew it firmly across his chest, along the path of the freshly healed scar.He gasped with the shock of it, and arched his back.Seizing a towel, I scrubbed it briskly over the wound.Before I could falter, I forced myself to run my fingers over his chest, scooping up a gout of blood which I rubbed savagely over his lips.There was one phrase that I didnt have to invent, having heard it myself.Bending low over him, I whispered, Now kiss me.I was not at all prepared for it.He hurled me half across the room as he came up off the bed.I staggered and fell against the table, making the giant candlesticks sway.The shadows darted and swung as the wicks flared and went out.The edge of the table had struck me hard across the back, but I recovered in time to dodge away as he lunged for me.With an inarticulate growl, he came after me, hands outstretched.He was both faster and stronger than I expected, though he staggered awkwardly, bumping into things.He cornered me for a moment between the brazier and the table, and I could hear his breath rasping harshly in his throat as he grabbed for me.He smashed his left hand toward my face; had his strength and reflexes been anything like normal, the blow would have killed me.Instead, I jerked to one side, and his fist glanced off my forehead, knocking me to the floor, mildly stunned.I crawled under the table.Reaching for me, he lost his balance and fell against the brazier.Glowing coals scattered across the stone floor of the chamber.He howled as his knee crunched heavily into a patch of hot coal.I seized a pillow from the bed and beat out a smoldering nest of sparks in the trailing bedcover.Preoccupied with this, I didnt notice his approach, until a solid clout across the head knocked me sprawling.The cot overturned as I tried to pull myself up with a hand on the frame.I lay sheltering behind it for a moment, trying to get my senses back.I could hear Jamie hunting me in the semidarkness, breath rasping between incoherent phrases of Gaelic cursing.Suddenly he caught sight of me and flung himself over the bed, eyes mad in the dim light.It is difficult to describe in detail what happened next, if only because everything happened a number of times, and the times all overlap in my memory.It seems as though Jamies burning hands closed on my neck only once, but that once went on forever.In fact, it happened dozens of times.Each time I managed to break his grip and throw him off, to retreat once more, dodging and ducking around the wrecked furniture.And once again he would follow, a man pulled by rage from the edge of death, swearing and sobbing, staggering and flailing wildly.Deprived of the sheltering brazier, the coals died quickly, leaving the room black as pitch and peopled with demons.In the last flickers of light, I saw him crouched against the wall, maned in fire and mantled in blood, penis stiff against the matted hair of his belly, eyes blue murder in a skull white face.A Viking berserker.Like the Northern devils who burst from their dragon ships into the mists of the ancient Scottish coast, to kill and plunder and burn.Men who would kill with the last ounce of their strength.Who would use that last strength to rape and sow their violent seed in the bellies of the conquered.The tiny incense burner gave no light, but the sickly smell of opium clogged my lungs.Though the coals were out, I saw lights in the darkness, colored lights that floated at the edge of my vision.Movement was becoming harder; I felt as though I were wading through water thigh deep, pursued by monstrous fish.I lifted my knees high, running in slow motion, feeling the water splash against my face.I shook off the dream, to realize that there was in fact wetness on my face and hands.Not tears, but blood, and the sweat of the nightmare creature I grappled with in the dark.Sweat.There was something I should remember about sweat, but I couldnt recall it.A hand tightened on my upper arm and I pulled away, a slick film left on my skin.Around and around the mulberry bush, the monkey chased the weasel.But something was wrong, it was the weasel chasing me, a weasel with sharp white teeth that pierced my forearm.I hit out at it and the teeth let go, but the clawsaround and around the mulberry bush  The demon had me up against the wall; I could feel stone behind my head and stone beneath my grasping fingers, and a stone hard body pressing hard against me, bony knee between my own, stone and bone, between my ownlegs, more stony hardnessah.A softness amidst the hardness of life, pleasant coolness in the heat, comfort in the midst of woe  We fell locked together to the floor, rolling over and over, tangled in the folds of the fallen tapestry, washed in the drafts of cold air from the window.The mists of madness began to recede.We bashed into some piece of furniture and both lay still.Jamies hands were locked on my breasts, fingers digging bruisingly into the flesh.I felt the plop of dampness on my face, sweat or tears, I couldnt tell, but opened my eyes to see.Jamie was looking down at me, face blank in the moony light, eyes wide, unfocused.His hands relaxed.One finger gently traced the outline of my breast, from slope to tip, over and over.His hand moved to cup the breast, fingers spread like a starfish, soft as the grip of a nursing child.M mother?he said.The hair stood up on the back of my neck.It was the high, pure voice of a young boy.Mother?The cold air laved us, whirling the unhealthy smoke away in a drift of snowflakes.I reached up and laid the palm of my hand along his cold cheek.Jamie, love, I said, whispering through a bruised throat, Come then, come lay your head, man.The mask trembled then and broke, and I held the big body hard against me, the two of us shaking with the force of his sobbing.* * *    It was, by considerable good luck, the unflappable Brother William who found us in the morning.I woke groggily to the sound of the door opening, and snapped to full consciousness when I heard him clear his throat emphatically before saying Good morning to ye, in his soft Yorkshire drawl.The heavy weight on my chest was Jamie.His hair had dried in bronze streaks and whorled over my breasts like the petals of a Chinese chrysanthemum.The cheek pressed against my sternum was warm and slightly sticky with sweat, but the back and arms I could touch were as cold as my thighs, chilled by the winter air gusting in on us.Daylight streaming through the uncurtained window revealed the full extent of the wreckage I had only dimly realized the night before; smashed furniture and crockery littered the room, and the massive paired candlesticks lay like fallen logs in the midst of a tangle of torn hangings and scattered bedclothes.From the pattern of indentations impressing itself painfully into my back, I thought I must be lying on the indifferently executed tapestry of St.Sebastian the Human Pincushion; no great loss to the monastery, if so.Brother William stood motionless in the doorway, jug and basin in hand.With great precision, he fixed his eyes on Jamies left eyebrow and inquired, And how do you feel this morning?There was a rather long pause, during which Jamie considerately remained in place, blanketing most of me from view.At last, in the hoarse tones of one to whom a revelation has been vouchsafed, he replied, Hungry.Oh, good, said Brother William, still staring hard at the eyebrow, Ill go and tell Brother Josef.The door closed soundlessly behind him.Nice of you not to move, I remarked.I shouldnt like us to be responsible for giving Brother William impure thoughts.Dense blue eyes stared down at me.Aye, well, he said judiciously, a view of my arse is no going to corrupt anyones Holy Orders; not in its present condition.Yours, though He paused to clear his throat.What about mine?I demanded.The bright head lowered slowly to plant a kiss on my shoulder.Yours, he said, would compromise a bishop.Mmmphm.I was, I felt, getting rather good at Scottish noises myself.Be that as it may, perhaps you should move now.I dont suppose even Brother Williams tact is infinite.Jamie lowered his head next to mine with some care, laying it on a fold of tapestry, from which he peered sideways at me.I dinna know how much of last night I dreamed and how much was real.His hand unconsciously strayed to the scratch across his chest.But if half what I thought happened really happened, I should be dead now.Youre not.I looked.With some hesitation, I asked, Do you want to be?He smiled slowly, eyes half closing.No, Sassenach, I dont.His face was gaunt and shadowed with illness and fatigue, but peaceful, the lines around his mouth smoothed out and the blue eyes clear.But Im damned close to it, want to or not.The only reason I think Im not dying now is that Im hungry.I wouldna be hungry if I were about to die, do ye think?Seems a waste.One eye closed altogether, but the other stayed half open, fixed on my face with a quizzical expression.You cant stand up?He considered carefully.If my life depended on it, I might possibly lift my head again.But stand up?No.With a sigh, I wriggled out from under him and righted the bed before trying to lever him into a vertical position.He managed to stand for only a few seconds before his eyes rolled back and he fell across the bed.I groped frantically for the pulse in his neck, and found it, slow and strong, just below the three cornered scar at the base of his throat.Simple exhaustion.After a month of imprisonment and a week of intense physical and mental stress, starvation, injury, sickness and high fever, even that vigorous frame had finally come to the end of its resources.The heart of a lion, I said, shaking my head, and the head of an ox.Too bad you havent also got the hide of a rhinoceros.I touched a freshly bloodied weal on his shoulder.He opened one eye.Whats a rhinoceros?I thought you were unconscious!I was.I am.My heads spinning like a top.I drew a blanket up over him.What you need now are food and rest.What you need now, he said, are clothes.And shutting the eye again, he fell promptly asleep.40    ABSOLUTION    I had no memory of finding my way to bed, but I must have done so, because I woke up there.Anselm was sitting by the window, reading.I sat bolt upright in bed.Jamie?I croaked.Asleep, he said, putting the book aside.He glanced at the hour candle on the table.Like you.You have been with the angels for the last thirty six hours, ma belle.He filled a cup from the earthenware jug and held it to my lips.At one time I would have considered drinking wine in bed before brushing ones teeth to be the last word in decadence.Performed in a monastery, in company with a robed Franciscan, the act seemed somewhat less degenerate.And the wine did cut through the mossy feeling in my mouth.I swung my feet over the side of the bed, and sat swaying.Anselm caught me by the arm and eased me back onto the pillow.He seemed suddenly to have four eyes, and altogether more noses and mouths than strictly necessary.Im a bit dizzy, I said, closing my eyes.I opened one.Somewhat better.At least there was only one of him, if a trifle blurry around the edges.Anselm bent over me, concerned.Shall I fetch Brother Ambrose or Brother Polydore, Madame?I have little skill in medicine, unfortunately.No, I dont need anything.I just sat up too suddenly.I tried again, more slowly.This time the room and its contents stayed relatively still.I became aware of numerous bruises and sore spots earlier submerged in the dizziness.I tried to clear my throat and discovered that it hurt.I grimaced.Really, ma chre, I think perhaps Anselm was poised by the door, ready to fetch assistance.He looked quite alarmed.I reached for the looking glass on the table and then changed my mind.I really wasnt ready for that.I grasped the wine jug instead.Anselm came slowly back into the room and stood watching me.Once convinced that I wasnt going to collapse after all, he sat down again.I sipped the wine slowly as my head cleared, trying to shake off the aftereffects of opium induced dreams.So we were alive, after all.Both of us.My dreams had been chaotic, filled with violence and blood.I had dreamed over and over that Jamie was dead or dying.And somewhere in the fog had been the image of the boy in the snow, his surprised round face overlying the image of Jamies bruised and battered one.Sometimes the pathetic, fuzzy mustache seemed to appear on Franks face.I distinctly remembered killing all three of them.I felt as though I had spent the night in stabbing and butchery, and I ached in every muscle with a sort of dull depression.Anselm was still there, patiently watching me, hands on his knees.There is something you could do for me, Father, I said.He rose at once, eager to help, reaching for the jug.Of course?More wine?I smiled wanly.Yes, but later.Right now, I want you to hear my confession.He was startled, but quickly gathered his professional self possession around him like his robes.But of course, chre madame, if you wish it.But really, would it not be better to fetch Father Gerard?He is well known as a confessor, while Ihe gave a Gallic shrugI am allowed to hear confessions, of course, but in truth I seldom do so, being only a poor scholar.I want you, I said firmly.And I want to do it now.He sighed in resignation and went to fetch his stola.Arranging it about his neck so that the purple silk lay straight and shimmering down the black front of his habit, he took a seat on the stool, blessed me briefly and sat back, waiting.And I told him.Everything.Who I was and how I came there.About Frank, and about Jamie.And about the young English dragoon with the pale, spotty face, dying against the snow.He showed no change of expression while I spoke, except that the round brown eyes grew rounder still.When I finished, he blinked once or twice, opened his mouth as though to speak, closed it again, and shook his head as though to clear it.No, I said patiently.I cleared my throat again; I croaked like a bullfrog.You havent been hearing things.And youre not imagining it, either.Now you see why I wanted you to hear it under the seal of confession?He nodded, a bit abstractedly.Yes.Yes, to be sure.Ifbut yes.Of course, you wished me to tell no one.And also, since you tell it to me under the seal of the sacrament, then you expect that I must believe it.But He scratched his head, then looked up at me.A wide smile spread slowly across his countenance.But how marvelous!he exclaimed softly.How extraordinary, and how wonderful!Wonderful isnt precisely the word I would have chosen, I said dryly, but extraordinary is all right.I coughed and reached for more wine.But it isa miracle, he said, as though to himself.If you insist, I said, sighing.But what I want to knowwhat ought I to do?Am I guilty of murder?Or adultery, for that matter?Not that theres much to be done about it in either case, but Id like to know.And since I am here, how ought I to act?Can Ishould I, I meanuse what I know tochange things?I dont even know if such a thing is possible.But if it is, have I the right?He rocked back on his stool, considering.Slowly he raised both index fingers, placed them tip to tip and stared at them for a long time.Finally, he shook his head and smiled at me.I dont know, ma bonne amie.It is not, you will appreciate, a situation one is prepared to encounter in the confessional.I will have to think, and to pray.Yes, assuredly to pray.Tonight I will contemplate your situation when I hold my watch before the Blessed Sacrament.And tomorrow perhaps I can advise you.He motioned me gently to kneel.But for now, my child, I will absolve you.Whatever your sins might be, have faith that they will be forgiven.He lifted one hand in blessing, placing the other on my head.Te absolvo, in nomine Patri, et Filii,  Rising, he lifted me to my feet.Thank you, Father, I said.Unbeliever that I was, I had used confession only to force him to take me seriously, and was somewhat surprised to feel a lightening of the burden on my spirits.Perhaps it was only the relief of telling someone the truth.He waved a hand in dismissal.I will see you tomorrow, chre madame.For now, you should rest more, if you can.He headed for the door, winding his stola up neatly into a square.At the doorway, he paused for a moment, turning to smile at me.A childlike excitement lighted his eyes.And perhaps tomorrow he said, perhaps you couldtell me what it is like?I smiled back.Yes, Father.Ill tell you.After he left, I staggered down the hall to see Jamie.I had seen any number of corpses in much better condition, but his chest rose and fell regularly, and the sinister green tinge had faded from his skin.Ive been waking him every few hours, just long enough to swallow a few spoonfuls of broth.Brother Roger was at my elbow, speaking softly.He moved his gaze from the patient to me, and recoiled noticeably at my appearance.I should probably have combed my hair.Er, perhaps you wouldlike some?No, thank you.I thinkI think perhaps I will sleep a bit more, after all.I no longer felt weighed down by guilt and depression, but a drowsy, contented heaviness was spreading through my limbs.Whether it was due to the effects of confession or of wine, I found to my surprise that I was looking forward to bed and to oblivion.I leaned forward to touch Jamie.He was warm, but with no trace of fever.I gently stroked his head, smoothing the tumbled red hair.The corner of his mouth stirred briefly and fell back into place.But it had turned up.I was sure of it.* * *    The sky was cold and damp, filling the horizon with a grey blankness that blended into the grey mist of the hills and the grimy cover of last weeks snow, so that the abbey seemed wrapped inside a ball of dirty cotton.Even inside the cloister, the winters silence weighed on the inhabitants.The chanting from the Hours of Praise in the chapel was muted, and the thick stone walls seemed to absorb all sound, swaddling the bustle of daily activity.Jamie slept for nearly two days, waking only to take a little broth or wine.Once awake, he began to heal in the usual fashion of a normally healthy young man, suddenly deprived of the strength and independence usually taken for granted.In other words, he enjoyed the cosseting for approximately twenty four hours and then became in turn restive, restless, testy, irritable, cranky, fractious, and extremely bad tempered.The cuts on his shoulders ached.The scars on his legs itched.He was sick of lying on his belly.The room was too hot.His hand hurt.The smoke from the brazier made his eyes burn so that he could not read.He was sick of broth, posset, and milk.He wanted meat.I recognized the symptoms of returning health, and was glad of them, but was prepared to put up with only so much of this.I opened the window, changed his sheets, applied marigold salve to his back and rubbed his legs with aloe juice.Then I summoned a serving brother and ordered more broth.I dont want any more of this slop!I need food!He pushed the tray irritably away, making the broth splash onto the napkin cradling the bowl.I folded my arms and stared down at him.Imperious blue eyes stared right back.He was thin as a rail, the lines of jaw and cheekbone bold against the skin.Though he was mending well, the raw nerves of his stomach would take a little longer to heal.He still could not always keep down the broth and milk.Youll get food when I say you can have it, I informed him, and not before.Ill have it now!Dye think you can tell me what Im to eat?Yes, I bloody well do!Im the doctor here, if youve forgotten.He swung his feet over the edge of the bed, clearly intending to take steps.I put a hand on his chest and shoved him back.Your job is to stay in that bed and do as youre told, for once in your life, I snapped.Youre not fit to be up, and youre not fit for solid foot yet.Brother Roger said you vomited again this morning.Brother Roger can mind his own business, and so can you, he said through his teeth, struggling back up.He reached out and got a hold on the table edge.With considerable effort, he made it to his feet, and stood there, swaying.Get back in bed!Youre going to fall down!He was alarmingly pale, and even the small effort of standing had made him break out in a cold sweat.Ill not, he said.And if I do, its my own concern.I was really angry by this time.Oh, is it!And who do you think saved your miserable life for you, anyway?Did it all by yourself, did you?I grabbed his arm to steer him back to bed, but he jerked it away.I didna ask ye to, did I?I told ye to leave me, no?And I canna see why ye bothered to save my life, anyway, if its only to starve me to deathunless ye enjoy watching it!This was altogether too much.Bloody ingrate!Shrew!I drew myself to my full height, and pointed menacingly at the cot.With all the authority learned in years of nursing, I said, Get back in that bed this instant, you stubborn, mulish, idiotic  Scot, he finished for me, succinctly.He took a step toward the door, and would have fallen, had he not caught hold of a stool.He plumped heavily down on it and sat swaying, his eyes a little unfocused with dizziness.I clenched my fists and glared at him.Fine, I said.Bloody fine!Ill order bread and meat for you, and after you vomit on the floor, you can just get down on your hands and knees and clean it up yourself!I wont do it, and if Brother Roger does, Ill skin him alive!I stormed into the hall and slammed the door behind me, just before the porcelain washbasin crashed into it from the other side.I turned to find an interested audience, no doubt attracted by the racket, standing in the hall.Brother Roger and Murtagh stood side by side, staring at my flushed face and heaving bosom.Roger looked disconcerted, but a slow smile spread over Murtaghs craggy countenance as he listened to the string of Gaelic obscenities going on behind the door.Hes feeling better, then, he said contentedly.I leaned against the corridor wall, and felt an answering smile spread slowly across my own face.Well, yes, I said, he is.* * *    On my way back to the main building from a morning spent in the herbary, I met Anselm coming from the cloister near the library.His face lighted when he saw me, and he hurried to join me in the courtyard.We walked together through the abbey grounds, talking.Yours is an interesting problem, to be sure, he said, breaking a stick from a bush near the wall.He examined the winter tight buds critically, then tossed it aside, and glanced up at the sky, where a feeble sun poked its way through the light cloud layer.Warmer, but a good way to go until the spring, he observed.Still, the carp should be lively todaylet us go down to the fish pools.Far from being the delicate ornamental structures I had imagined them to be, the fish pools were little more than utilitarian rock lined troughs, placed conveniently near to the kitchens.Stocked with carp, they provided the necessary food for Fridays and fast days, when the weather was too rough to permit ocean fishing for the more customary haddock, herring, and flounder.True to Anselms word, the fish were lively, the fat fusiform bodies gliding past each other, white scales reflecting the clouds overhead, the vigor of their movements occasionally stirring up small waves that sloshed against the sides of their rocky prison.As our shadows fell on the water, the carp turned toward us like compass needles surging toward the north.They expect to be fed, when they see people, Anselm explained.It would be a shame to disappoint them.One moment, chre madame.He darted into the kitchens, returning shortly with two loaves of stale bread.We stood on the lip of the pool, tearing crumbs from the loaves and tossing them to the endlessly hungry mouths below.You know, there are two aspects to this curious situation of yours, Anselm said, absorbed in tearing bread.He glanced aside at me, a sudden smile lighting his face.He shook his head in wonderment.I can scarcely believe it still, you know.Such a marvel!Truly, God has been good, to show me such things.Well, thats nice, I said, a bit dryly, I dont know whether Hes been quite so obliging to me.Really?I think so.Anselm sank down on his haunches, crumbling bread between his fingers.True, he said, the situation has caused you no little personal inconvenience  Thats one way of putting it, I muttered.But it may also be regarded as a signal mark of Gods favor, he went on, disregarding my interruption.The bright brown eyes regarded me speculatively.I prayed for guidance, kneeling before the Blessed Sacrament, he went on, and as I sat in the silence of the chapel, I seemed to see you as a shipwrecked traveler.And it seems to me that that is a good parallel to your present situation, is it not?Imagine such a soul, Madame, suddenly cast away in a strange land, bereft of friends and familiarity, without resources save what the new land can provide.Such a happening is disaster, truly, and yet may be the opening for great opportunity and blessings.What if the new land shall be rich?New friends may be made, and a new life begun.Yes, but I began.Sohe said authoritatively, holding up a finger to hush meif you have been deprived of your earlier life, perhaps it is only that God has seen fit to bless you with another, that may be richer and fuller.Oh, its full, all right, I agreed.But  Now, from the standpoint of canon law, he said frowning, there is no difficulty regarding your marriages.Both were valid marriages, consecrated by the church.And strictly speaking, your marriage to the young chevalier in there antedates your marriage to Monsieur Randall.Yes, strictly speaking,  I agreed, getting to finish a sentence for once.But not in my time.I dont believe canon law was constructed with such contingencies in mind.Anselm laughed, the pointed end of his beard quivering in the slight breeze.More than true, ma chre, more than true.All that I meant was that, considered from a strictly legal standpoint, you have committed neither sin nor crime in what you have done regarding these two men.Those were the two aspects of your situation, of which I spoke earlier: what you have done, and what you will do.He reached up a hand and took mine, tugging me down to sit beside him, so our eyes were on a level.That is what you asked me when I heard your confession, is it not?What have I done?And what shall I do?Yes, thats it.And youre telling me that I havent done anything wrong?But Ive  He was, I thought, nearly as bad as Dougal MacKenzie for interrupting.No, you have not, he said firmly.It is possible to act in strict accordance with Gods law and with ones conscience, you comprehend, and still to encounter difficulties and tragedy.It is the painful truth that we still do not know why le bon Dieu allows evil to exist, but we have His word for it that this is true.I created good, He says in the Bible, and I created evil.Consequently, even good people sometimes, I think, especially good people, he added meditatively, may encounter great confusion and difficulties in their lives.For example, take the young boy you were obliged to kill.No, he said, raising a hand against my interruption, make no mistake.You were obliged to kill him, given the exigencies of your situation.Even Holy Mother Church, which teaches the sanctity of life, recognizes the need for defense of oneself and of ones family.And having seen the earlier condition of your husbandhe cast a look back at the guests wingI have no doubt that you were obliged to take the path of violence.That being so, you have nothing with which to reproach yourself.You do, of course, feel pity and regret for the action, for you are, Madame, a person of great sympathy and feeling.He gently patted the hand that rested on my drawn up knees.Sometimes our best actions result in things that are most regrettable.And yet you could not have acted otherwise.We do not know what Gods plan for the young man wasperhaps it was His will that the boy should join him in heaven at that time.But you are not God, and there are limits to what you can expect of yourself.I shivered briefly as a cold wind came round the corner, and drew my shawl closer.Anselm saw it, and motioned toward the pool.The water is warm, Madame.Perhaps you would care to soak your feet?Warm?I gaped incredulously at the water.I hadnt noticed before, but there were no broken sheets of ice in the corners of the trough, as there were on the holy water fonts outside the church, and small green plants floated in the water, sprouting from the cracks between the rocks that lined the pool.In illustration, Anselm slipped off his own leather sandals.Cultured as his face and voice were, he had the square, sturdy hands and feet of a Normandy peasant.Hiking the skirt of his habit to his knees, he dipped his feet into the pool.The carp dashed away, turning almost at once to nose curiously at this new intrusion.They dont bite, do they?I asked, viewing the myriad voracious mouths suspiciously.Not flesh, no, he assured me.They have no teeth to speak of.I shed my own sandals and gingerly inserted my feet into the water.To my surprise, it was pleasantly warm.Not hot, but a delightful contrast to the damp, chilly air.Oh, thats nice!I wiggled my toes with pleasure, causing considerable consternation among the carp.There are several mineral springs near the abbey, Anselm explained.They bubble hot from the earth, and the waters hold great healing powers.He pointed to the far end of the trough, were I could see a small opening in the rocks, half obscured by the drifting water plants.A small amount of the hot mineral water is piped here from the nearest spring.That is what enables the cook to maintain live fish for the table at all seasons; normally the winter weather would be too bitter for them.We paddled our feet in congenial silence for a time, the heavy bodies of the fish flicking past, occasionally bumping into our legs with a surprisingly weighty impact.The sun came out again, bathing us in a weak but perceptible warmth.Anselm closed his eyes, letting the light wash over his face.He spoke again without opening them.Your first husbandFrank was his name?he, too, I think, must be commended to God as one of the regrettable things that you can do nothing about.But I could have done something, I argued.I could have gone backperhaps.He opened one eye and regarded me skeptically.Yes, perhaps,  he agreed.And perhaps not.You need not reproach yourself for hesitating to risk your life.It wasnt the risk, I said, flicking my toes at a big black and white splotched carp.Or not entirely.It waswell, it was partly fear, but mostly it was that II couldnt leave Jamie.I shrugged helplessly.Isimply couldnt.Anselm smiled, opening both eyes.A good marriage is one of the most precious gifts from God, he observed.If you had the good sense to recognize and accept the gift, it is no reproach to you.And consider He tilted his head to one side, like a brown sparrow.You have been gone from your place for nearly a year.Your first husband will have begun to reconcile himself to your loss.Much as he may have loved you, loss is common to all men, and we are given means of overcoming it for our good.He will have started, perhaps, to build a new life.Would it do good for you to desert the man who needs you so deeply, and whom you love, to whom you are united in the bonds of holy matrimony, to return and disrupt this new life?And in particular, if you were to go back from a sense of duty, but feeling that your heart is given elsewhereno.He shook his head decisively.No man can serve two masters, and no more can a woman.Now, if that were your only valid marriage, and thishe nodded again toward the guest wingmerely an irregular attachment, then your duty might lie elsewhere.But you were bound by God, and I think you may honor your duty to the chevalier.Now, as to the other aspectwhat you shall do.That may require some discussion.He pulled his feet from the water, and dried them on the skirt of his habit.Let us adjourn this meeting to the abbey kitchens, where perhaps Brother Eulogius may be persuaded to provide us with a warming drink.Finding a stray bit of bread on the ground, I tossed it to the carp and stooped to put my sandals on.I cant tell you what a relief it is to talk to someone about it, I said.And I still cant get over the fact that you really do believe me.He shrugged, gallantly offering me an arm to hold while I slipped the rough straps of the sandal over my instep.Ma chre, I serve a man who multiplied the loaves and fisheshe smiled, nodding at the pool, where the swirls of the carps feeding were still subsidingwho healed the sick and raised the dead.Shall I be astonished that the master of eternity has brought a young woman through the stones of the earth to do His will?Well, I reflected, it was better than being denounced as the whore of Babylon.The kitchens of the abbey were warm and cavelike, the arching roof blackened with centuries of grease filled smoke.Brother Eulogius, up to his elbows in a vat of dough, nodded a greeting to Anselm and called in French to one of the lay brothers to come and serve us.We found a seat out of the bustle, and sat down with two cups of ale and a plate containing a hot pastry of some kind.I pushed the plate toward Anselm, too preoccupied to be interested in food.Let me put it this way, I said, choosing my words carefully.If I knew that some harm was going to occur to a group of people, should I feel obliged to try to avert it?Anselm rubbed his nose reflectively on his sleeve; the heat of the kitchen was beginning to make it run.In principle, yes, he agreed.But it would depend also upon a number of other thingswhat is the risk to yourself, and what are your other obligations?Also what is the chance of your success?I havent the faintest idea.Of any of those things.Except obligation, of courseI mean, theres Jamie.But hes one of the group who might be hurt.He broke off a piece of pastry and passed it to me, steaming.I ignored it, studying the surface of my ale.The two men I killed, I said, either of them might have had children, if I hadnt killed them.They might have done I made a helpless gesture with the cup, who knows what they might have done?I may have affected the futureno, I have affected the future.And I dont know how, and thats what frightens me so much.Um.Anselm grunted thoughtfully, and motioned to a passing lay brother, who hastened over with a fresh pasty and more ale.He refilled both cups before speaking.If you have taken life, you have also preserved it.How many of the sick you have treated would have died without your intervention?They also will affect the future.What if a person you have saved should commit an act of great evil?Is that your fault?Should you on that account have let that person die?Of course not.He rapped his pewter mug on the table for emphasis.You say that you are afraid to take any actions here for fear of affecting the future.This is illogical, Madame.Everyones actions affect the future.Had you remained in your own place, your actions would still have affected what was to happen, no less than they will now.You have still the same responsibilities that you would have had thenthat any man has at any time.The only difference is that you may be in a position to see more exactly what effects your actions haveand then again, you may not.He shook his head, looking steadily across the table.The ways of the Lord are hidden to us, and no doubt for good reason.You are right, ma chre; the laws of the Church were not formulated with situations such as yours in mind, and therefore you have little guidance other than your own conscience and the hand of God.I cannot tell you what you should do, or not do.You have free choice; so have all the others in this world.And history, I believe, is the cumulation of all those actions.Some individuals are chosen by God to affect the destinies of many.Perhaps you are one of those.Perhaps not.I do not know why you are here.You do not know.It is likely that neither of us will ever know.He rolled his eyes, comically.Sometimes I dont even know why I am here!I laughed and he smiled in return.He leaned toward me across the rough planks of the table, intense.Your knowledge of the future is a tool, given to you as a shipwrecked castaway might find himself in possession of a knife or a fishing line.It is not immoral to use it, so long as you do so in accordance with the dictates of Gods law, to the best of your ability.He paused, drew a deep breath, and blew it out in an explosive sigh that ruffled his silky mustache.He smiled.And that, ma chre madame, is all I can tell youno more than I can tell any troubled soul who comes to me for advice: put your trust in God, and pray for guidance.He shoved the fresh pastry toward me.But whatever you are to do, you will require strength for it.So take one last bit of advice: when in doubt, eat.* * *    When I came into Jamies room in the evening, he was asleep, head pillowed on his forearms.The empty broth bowl sat virtuously on the tray, the untouched platter of bread and meat beside it.I looked from the innocent, dreaming face to the platter and back.I touched the bread.My finger left a slight depression in the moist surface.Fresh.I left him asleep and went in search of Brother Roger, who I found in the buttery.Did he eat the bread and meat?I demanded, without preliminaries.Brother Roger smiled in his fluffy beard.Yes.Did he keep it down?No.I eyed him narrowly.You didnt clean up after him, I hope.He was amused, the round cheeks pink above his beard.Would I dare?No, he took the precaution of having a basin ready, in case.Damn wily Scot, I said, laughing despite myself.I returned to his chamber and kissed him lightly on the forehead.He stirred, but didnt wake.Heeding Father Anselms advice, I took the platter of fresh bread and meat back to my chamber for my own supper.* * *    Thinking I would give Jamie time to recover, both from pique and indigestion, I stayed in my own room most of the next day, reading an herbal Brother Ambrose had provided me.After lunch I went to check on my recalcitrant patient.Instead of Jamie, though, I found Murtagh, sitting on a stool tilted back against the wall, wearing a bemused expression.Where is he?I said, looking blankly around the room.Murtagh jerked a thumb toward the window.It was a cold, dark day, and the lamps were lit.The window was uncovered and the chilly draft set the little flame fluttering in its dish.He went out?I asked incredulously.Where?Why?And what on earth is he wearing?Jamie had remained largely naked over the last several days, since the room was warm and any pressure on his healing wounds was painful.He had worn a monks outer robe when leaving his room on necessary short excursions, with the support of Brother Roger, but the robe was still present, neatly folded at the foot of the bed.Murtagh rocked his stool forward and regarded me owlishly.How many questions is that?Four?He held up one hand, index finger pointing up.One: aye, he went out.The middle finger rose.Two: Where?Damned if I know.The fourth finger joined its companions.Three: Why?He said he was tired of bein cooped up indoors.The little finger waggled briefly.Four: Also damned if I know.He wasna wearin anything at all last time I saw him.Murtagh folded all four fingers and stuck out his thumb.Ye didna ask me, but hes been gone an hour or so.I fumed, at a loss as to what to do.Since the offender wasnt available, I snapped at Murtagh instead.Dont you know its near freezing out there, and snow coming on?Why didnt you stop him?And what do you mean he isnt wearing anything?The diminutive clansman was tranquil.Aye, I know it.Reckon he does, too, not bein blind.As for stoppin him, I tried.He nodded at the robe on the bed.When he said he was goin out, I said he wasna fit for it, and youd have my head, did I let him go.I snatched up his gown and set my back against the door, and told him he wasna leavin, unless he was prepared to go through me.Murtagh paused, then said irrelevantly, Ellen MacKenzie had the sweetest smile I ever saw; would warm a man to the backbone just to see it.So you let her fat headed son go out and freeze to death, I said impatiently.Whats his mothers smile to do with it?Murtagh rubbed his nose meditatively.Weel, when I said I wouldna let him pass, young Jamie just looked at me for a moment.Then he gave me a smile looked just like his mas, and stepped out of the window in naught but his skin.By the time I got to the window, he was gone.I rolled my eyes heavenward.Reckoned I should let ye know where hed gone, Murtagh continued, so yed no be worrit for him.So Id no be worrit for him!I muttered under my breath as I strode toward the stables.Hed better be worrit, when I catch up to him!There was only the one main road heading inland.I rode along it at a good pace, keeping an eye on the fields as I passed.This part of France was a rich farming area, and luckily most of the forest had been cleared; wolves and bears would not be as much a danger as they might be further inland.As it happened, I found him barely a mile beyond the gates of the monastery, sitting on one of the ancient Roman mile markers that dotted the roads.He was barefoot, but otherwise clad in a short jerkin and thin breeches, the property of one of the stable lads, to judge from the stains on them.I reined up and stared at him for a moment, leaning on the pommel.Your nose is blue, I remarked conversationally.I glanced downward.And so are your feet.He grinned and wiped his nose on the back of his hand.So are my balls.Want to warm them for me?Cold or not, he was plainly in good spirits.I slid off the horse and stood in front of him, shaking my head.Its no use at all, is it?I asked.What isnt?He rubbed his hand on the ragged breeches.Being angry with you.You dont care a bit whether you give yourself pneumonia, or get eaten by bears, or worry me half to death, do you?Well, Im no much worrit about the bears.They sleep in the winter, ye know.I lost my temper and swung my hand at him, intending to slap his ear through the side of his head.He caught my wrist and held it without difficulty, laughing at me.After a moments fruitless struggle, I gave up and laughed too.Are you coming back, now?I asked.Or have you got anything else to prove?He gestured back along the road with his chin.Take the horse back to that big oak tree and wait for me there.Ill walk that far.Alone.I bit my tongue to repress the several remarks I felt bubbling to the surface, and mounted.At the oak tree, I got off and looked down the road.After a moment, though, I found I couldnt bear to watch his labored progress.When he fell the first time, I clutched the reins tight in my gloved hands, then resolutely turned my back, and waited.We barely made it back to the guests wing, but managed, staggering through the corridor, his arm looped over my shoulder for support.I spotted Brother Roger, anxiously lurking in the hall, and sent him.scampering for a warming pan, while I steered my awkward burden into the chamber and dumped him onto the bed.He grunted at the impact, but lay still, eyes closed, as I proceeded to strip the filthy rags off him.All right; in you get.He rolled obediently under the covers I held back for him.I thrust the warming pan hastily between the sheets at the foot of the bed and shoved it back and forth.When I removed it, he stretched his long legs down and relaxed with a blissful sigh as his feet reached the pocket of warmth.I went quietly about the room, picking up the discarded clothes, straightening the trifling disorder on the table, putting fresh charcoal in the brazier, adding a pinch of elecampane to sweeten the smoke.I thought he was asleep, and was startled when he spoke behind me.Claire.Yes?I love you.Oh.I was mildly surprised, but undeniably pleased.I love you too.He sighed, and opened his eyes halfway.Randall, he said.Toward the end.Thats what he wanted.I was even more startled by this, and replied cautiously.Oh?Aye.His eyes were fixed on the open window, where the snow clouds filled the space with a deep, even grey.I was lying on the floor, and he was lying next to me.He was naked by then, too, and both of us were smeared with bloodand other things.I remember trying to lift my head, and feeling my cheek stuck to the stone of the floor with dried blood.He frowned, a distant look in his eyes as he conjured the memory.I was far gone by then; so far that I didna even feel much painI was just terribly tired, and everything seemed far away and not very real.Just as well, I said, with some asperity, and he smiled briefly.Aye, just as well.I was drifting a bit, half fainted, I expect, so I dont know how long we both lay there, but I came awake to find him holding me and pressing himself against me.He hesitated, as though the next part were difficult to say.Id not fought him til then.But I was so tired, and I thought I couldna bear it again.anyway, I started to squirm away from him, not really fighting, just pulling back.He had his arms round my neck, and he pulled on me, and buried his face in my shoulder, and I could feel he was crying.I couldna tell what he was saying for a bit, and then I could; he was saying I love you, I love you, over and over, with his tears and his spittle running down my chest.Jamie shuddered briefly, from cold or memory.He blew out a long breath, disturbing the cloud of fragrant smoke that swirled near the ceiling.I canna think why I did it.But I put my arms about him, and we just lay still for a bit.He stopped crying, finally, and kissed me and stroked me.Then he whispered to me, Tell me that you love me.He paused in the recital, smiling faintly.I would not do it.I dinna know why.By then I would ha licked his boots and called him the King of Scotland, if hed wanted it.But I wouldna tell him that.I dont even remember thinking about it; I justwouldnt.He sighed and his good hand twitched, gripping the coverlet.He used me againhard.And he kept on saying it: Tell me that you love me, Alex.Say that you love me.He called you Alex?I interrupted, not able to hold back.Aye.I remember I wondered how he knew my second name.Did not occur to me to wonder why hed use it, even if he knew.He shrugged.Anyway, I didna move or say a word, and when hed finished, he jumped up as though hed gone mad, and started to beat me with somethingI could not see whatcursing and shouting at me, saying You know you love me!Tell me so!I know its true!I got my arms up over my head to protect it, and after a bit I must have fainted again, because the pain in my shoulders was the last I remember, except for sort of a dream about bellowing kine.Then I woke, jouncing along belly down on a horse for a few moments, and then nothing again til I came round on the hearthside at Eldridge, with you looking down on me.He closed his eyes again.His tone was dreamy, almost unconcerned.I thinkif I had told him thathe would have killed me.Some people have nightmares peopled by monsters.I dreamed of genealogical charts, thin black branches, bearing clusters of dates on every stem.The lines like snakes, with death between the brackets of their jaws.Once again I heard Franks voice, saying He became a soldier, a good choice for a second son.There was a third brother who became a curate, but I dont know much about himI didnt know much about him, either.Only his name.There were the three sons listed on that chart; the sons of Joseph and Mary Randall.I had seen it many times: the oldest, William; and the second, Jonathan; and the third, Alexander.Jamie spoke again, summoning me from my thoughts.Sassenach?Yes?Ye know the fortress I told ye of, the one inside me?I remember.He smiled without opening his eyes, and reached out a hand for me.Well, Ive a lean to built, at least.And a roof to keep out the rain.* * *    I went to bed tired but peaceful, and wondering.Jamie would recover.When that had been in doubt, I had looked no further than the next hour, the next meal, the next administration of medicine.But now I needed to look further.The abbey was a sanctuary, but only a temporary one.We could not stay here indefinitely, no matter how hospitable the monks.Scotland and England were too dangerous by far; unless Lord Lovat could helpa remote contingency, under the circumstances.Our future must lie on this side of the channel.Knowing what I now knew about Jamies seasickness, I understood his reluctance to consider emigration to Americathree months of nausea was a daunting prospect to anyone.So what was left?France was the most likely.We both spoke French fluently.While Jamie could do as well in Spanish, German, or Italian, I was not so linguistically blessed.Also, the Fraser family was rich in connections here; perhaps we could find a place on an estate owned by a relative or friend, and live peacefully in the country.The idea held considerable attractions.But there remained, as always, the question of time.It was the beginning of 1744the New Year was but two weeks past.And in 1745, Bonnie Prince Charlie would take ship from France to Scotland, the Young Pretender come to claim his fathers throne.With him would come disaster; war and slaughter, the crushing of the Highland clans, and with them, the butchery of all that Jamieand Iheld dear.And between now and then, there lay one year.One year, when things might happen.When steps might be taken to prevent disaster.How, and by what means?I had no idea, but neither had I any doubts about the consequences of inaction.Could events be changed?Perhaps.My fingers stole to my left hand and idly caressed the gold ring on my fourth finger.I thought of what I had said to Jonathan Randall, burning with rage and horror in the dungeons under Wentworth Prison.I curse you, I had said, with the hour of your death.And I had told him when he would die.Had told him the date written on the genealogical chart, in Franks fine black calligraphic scriptApril 16, 1745.Jonathan Randall was to die at the battle of Culloden, caught up in the slaughter that the English would create.But he didnt.He had died instead a few hours later, trampled beneath the hooves of my revenge.And he had died a childless bachelor.Or at least I thought so.The chartthat cursed chart!had given the date of his marriage, sometime in 1744.And the birth of his son, Franks five times great grandfather, soon after.If Jack Randall was dead and childless, how would Frank be born?And yet his ring was still upon my hand.He had existed, would exist.I comforted myself with the thought, rubbing the ring in the darkness, as though it contained a jinni that could advise me.I woke out of a sound sleep sometime later with a half scream.Ssh.Tis only me.The large hand lifted from my mouth.With the candle out, the room was pitch black.I groped blindly until my hand struck something solid.You shouldnt be out of bed!I exclaimed, still groggy with sleep.My fingers slid over smooth cold flesh.Youre freezing!Well, of course I am, he said, somewhat crossly.I havena got any clothes on, and its perishing in the corridor.Will ye let me in bed?I wriggled as far over as I could in the narrow cot, and he slid in naked beside me, clutching me for warmth.His breathing was uneven, and I thought his trembling was from weakness as much as from cold.God, youre warm.He snuggled closer, sighing.It feels good to hold ye, Sassenach.I didnt bother asking what he was doing there; that was becoming quite plain.Nor did I ask whether he was sure.I had my own doubts, but would not voice them for fear of making self fulfilling prophecies.I rolled to face him, mindful of the injured hand.There was that sudden startling moment of joining, that quick gliding strangeness that at once becomes familiar.Jamie sighed deeply, with satisfaction and, perhaps, relief.We lay still for a moment, as though afraid to disturb our fragile link by moving.Jamies good hand caressed me slowly, feeling its way in the dark, fingers spread like a cats whiskers, sensitive to vibration.He moved against me, once, as though asking a question, and I answered him in the same language.We began a delicate game of slow movements, a balancing act between his desire and his weakness, between pain and the growing pleasure of the body.Somewhere in the dark, I thought to myself that I must tell Anselm that there was another way to make time stop, but then thought perhaps not, as it was not a way open to a priest.I held Jamie steady, with a light hand on his scarred back.He set our rhythm, but let me carry the force of our movement.We were both silent save our breathing, until the end.Feeling him tiring, I grasped him firmly and pulled him to me, rocking my hips to take him deeper, forcing him toward the climax.Now, I said softly, come to me.Now!He put his forehead hard against mine and yielded himself to me with a quivering sigh.The Victorians called it the little death, and with good reason.He lay so limp and heavy that I would have thought him dead, if not for the slow thump of his heart against my ribs.It seemed a long time before he stirred and mumbled something against my shoulder.What did you say?He turned his head so his mouth was just below my ear.I felt warm breath on my neck.I said, he answered softly, my hand doesna hurt at all just now.The good hand gently explored my face, smoothing away the wetness on my cheeks.Were ye afraid for me?he asked.Yes, I said.I thought it was too soon.He laughed softly in the dark.It was; I almost killed myself.Aye, I was afraid too.But I woke with my hand painin me and couldna go back to sleep.I was tossing about, feeling lonely for ye.The more I thought about ye, the more I wanted ye, and I was halfway down the corridor before I thought to worry about what I was going to do when I got here.And once I thought He paused, stroking my cheek.Well, Im no verra good, Sassenach, but Im maybe not a coward, after all.I turned my head to meet his kiss.His stomach rumbled loudly.Dont laugh, you, he grumbled.Its your fault, starving me.Its a wonder I could manage at all, on nothing but beef broth and ale.All right, I said, still laughing.You win.You can have an egg for your breakfast tomorrow.Ha, he said, in tones of deep satisfaction.I knew yed feed me, if I offered ye a suitable inducement.We fell asleep face to face, locked in each others arms.41    FROM THE WOMB OF THE EARTH    Over the next two weeks, Jamie continued to heal, and I continued to wonder.Some days I would feel that we must go to Rome, where the Pretenders court held sway, and dowhat?Other times, I wanted with all my heart only to find a safe and isolated spot, to live our lives in peace.It was a warm, bright day, and the icicles hanging from the gargoyles noses dripped incessantly, leaving deep ragged pits in the snow beneath the eaves.The door of Jamies room had been left ajar and the window uncovered, to clear out some of the lingering vapors of smoke and illness.I poked my head cautiously around the jamb, not wishing to wake him if he was asleep, but the narrow cot was empty.He was seated by the open window, turned half away from the door so that his face was mostly hidden.He was desperately thin still, but the shoulders were broad and straight beneath the rough fabric of the novices habit, and the grace of his strength was returning; he sat solidly without a tremor, back straight and legs curled back beneath the stool, the lines of his body firm and harmonious.He was holding his right wrist with his sound left hand, slowly turning the right hand in the sunlight.There was a small pile of cloth strips on the table.He had removed the bandages from the injured hand and was examining it closely.I stood in the doorway, not moving.From here, I could see the hand clearly as he turned it back and forth, probing gingerly.The stigma of the nail wound in the palm of the hand was quite small, and well healed, I was glad to see; no more than a small pink knot of scar tissue that would gradually fade.On the back of the hand, the situation was not so favorable.Eroded by infection, the wound there covered an area the size of sixpence, still patched with scabs and the rawness of a new scar.The middle finger, too, showed a jagged ridge of pink scar tissue, running from just below the first joint almost to the knuckle.Released from their splints, the thumb and index finger were straight, but the little finger was badly twisted; that one had had three separate fractures, I remembered, and apparently I had not been able to set them all properly.The ring finger was set oddly, so that it protruded slightly upward when he laid the hand flat on the table, as he did now.Turning the hand palm upward, he began to manipulate the fingers gently.None would bend more than an inch or two; the ring finger not at all.As I had feared, the second joint was likely permanently frozen.He turned the hand to and fro, holding it before his face, watching the stiff, twisted fingers and the ugly scars, mercilessly vivid in the sunlight.Then he suddenly bent his head, clutching the injured hand to his chest, covering it protectively with the sound one.He made no sound, but the wide shoulders trembled briefly.Jamie.I crossed the room swiftly and knelt beside him, putting my hand softly on his knee.Jamie, Im sorry, I said.I did the best I could.He looked down at me in astonishment.The thick auburn lashes sparkled with tears in the sunlight, and he dashed them hastily away with the back of his hand.What?he said, gulping, clearly taken aback by my sudden appearance.Sorry?For what, Sassenach?Your hand.I reached out and took it, lightly tracing the crooked lines of the fingers, touching the sunken scar on the back.It will get better, I assured him anxiously.Really it will.I know it seems stiff and useless right now, but thats only because its been splinted so long, and the bones havent fully knitted yet.I can show you how to exercise, and massage.Youll get back a good deal of the use of it, honestly  He stopped me by laying his good hand along my cheek.Did you mean?He started, then stopped, shaking his head in disbelief.You thought?He stopped once more and started over.Sassenach, he said, ye didna think that I was grieving for a stiff finger and a few more scars?He smiled, a little crookedly.Im a vain man, maybe, but it doesna go that deep, I hope.But you I began.He took both my hands in both of his and stood up, drawing me to my feet.I reached up and smoothed away the single tear that had rolled down his cheek.The tiny smear of moisture was warm on my thumb.I was crying for joy, my Sassenach, he said softly.He reached out slowly and took my face between his hands.And thanking God that I have two hands.That I have two hands to hold you with.To serve you with, to love you with.Thanking God that I am a whole man still, because of you.I put my own hands up, cupping his.But why wouldnt you be?I asked.And then I remembered the butcherous assortment of saws and knives I seen among Beatons implements at Leoch, and I knew.Knew what I had forgotten when I had been faced with the emergency.That in the days before antibiotics, the usualthe onlycure for an infected extremity was amputation of the limb.Oh, Jamie, I said.I was weak kneed at the thought, and sat down on the stool rather abruptly.I never thought of it, I said, still stunned.I honestly never thought of it.I looked up at him.Jamie.If Id thought of it, I probably would have done it.To save your life.Its not howthey dont do it that way, then, inyour time?I shook my head.No.There are drugs to stop infections.So I didnt even think of it, I marveled.I looked up suddenly.Did you?He nodded.I was expecting it.Its why I asked you to let me die, that once.I was thinking of it, in between the bouts of muzzy headedness, andjust for that one momentI didna think I could bear to live like that.Its what happened to Ian, ye know.No, really?I was shocked.He told me hed lost it by grape shot, but I didnt think to ask about the details.Aye, a grape shot wound in the leg went bad.The surgeons took it off to keep it from poisoning his blood.He paused.Ian does verra well, all things considered.Buthe hesitated, pulling on the stiff ring fingerI knew him before.Hes as good as he is only because of Jenny.Shekeeps him whole.He smiled sheepishly at me.As ye did for me.I canna think why women bother.Well, I said softly, women like to do that.He laughed quietly and drew me close.Aye.God knows why.We stood entwined for a bit, not moving.My forehead rested on his chest, my arms around his back, and I could feel his heart beating, slow and strong.Finally he stirred and released me.Ive something to show ye, he said.He turned and opened the small drawer of the table, removing a folded letter which he handed to me.It was a letter of introduction, from Abbot Alexander, commending his nephew, James Fraser, to the attention of the Chevalier St.Georgeotherwise known as His Majesty King James of Scotlandas a most proficient linguist and translator.Its a place, Jamie said, watching as I folded the letter.And well need a place to go, soon.But what ye told me on the hill at Craigh na Dunthat was true, no?I took a deep breath and nodded.Its true.He took the letter from me and tapped it thoughtfully on his knee.Then thishe waved the letteris not without a bit of danger.It could be.He tossed the parchment into the drawer and sat staring after it for a moment.Then he looked up and the dark blue eyes held mine.He laid a hand along my cheek.I meant it, Claire, he said quietly.My life is yours.And its yours to decide what we shall do, where we go next.To France, to Italy, even back to Scotland.My heart has been yours since first I saw ye, and youve held my soul and body between your two hands here, and kept them safe.We shall go as ye say.There was a light knock at the door, and we sprang apart like guilty lovers.I dabbed hastily at my hair, thinking that a monastery, while an excellent convalescent home, lacked something as a romantic retreat.A lay brother came in at Jamies bidding, and dumped a large leather saddlebag on the table.From MacRannoch of Eldridge Manor, he said with a grin.For my lady Broch Tuarach.He bowed then and left, leaving a faint breath of seawater and cold air behind.I unbuckled the leather straps, curious to see what MacRannoch might have sent.Inside were three things: a note, unaddressed and unsigned, a small package addressed to Jamie, and the cured skin of a wolf, smelling strongly of the tanners arts.The note read: For a virtuous woman is a pearl of great price, and her value is greater than rubies.Jamie had opened the other parcel.He held something small and glimmering in one hand and was quizzically regarding the wolf pelt.A bit odd, that.Sir Marcus has sent ye a wolf pelt, Sassenach, and me a pearl bracelet.Perhaps hes got his labels mixed?The bracelet was a lovely thing, a single row of large baroque pearls, set between twisted gold chains.No, I said, admiring it.Hes got it right.The bracelet goes with the necklace you gave me when we wed.He gave that to your mother; did you know?No, I didnt, he answered softly, touching the pearls.Father gave them to me for my wife, whoever she was to beand a quick smile tugged at his mouthbut he didna tell me where they came from.I remembered Sir Marcuss help on the night we had burst so unceremoniously into his house, and the look on his face when we had left him next day.I could see from Jamies face that he also was remembering the baronet who might have been his father.He reached out and took my hand, fastening the bracelet about my wrist.But its not for me!I protested.Aye, it is, he said firmly.It isna suitable for a man to send jewelry to a respectable married woman, so he gave it to me.But clearly its for you.He looked at me and grinned.For one thing, it wont go round my wrist, even scrawny as I am.He turned to the bundled wolfskin and shook it out.Whyever did MacRannoch send ye this, though?He draped the shaggy wolfhide about his shoulders and I recoiled with a sharp cry.The head had been carefully skinned and cured as well, and equipped with a pair of yellow glass eyes, it was glaring nastily at me from Jamies left shoulder.Ugh!I said.It looks just like it did when it was alive!Jamie, following the direction of my glance, turned his head and found himself suddenly face to face with the snarling countenance.With a startled exclamation, he jerked the skin off and flung it across the room.Jesus God, he said, and crossed himself.The skin lay on the floor, glowering balefully in the candlelight.What dye mean, when it was alive, Sassenach?A personal friend, was it?Jamie asked, eyeing it narrowly.I told him then the things I had had no chance to tell him; about the wolf, and the other wolves, and Hector, and the snow, and the cottage with the bear, and the argument with Sir Marcus, and the appearance of Murtagh, and the cattle, and the long wait on the hillside in the pink mist of the snow swept night, waiting to see whether he was dead or alive.Thin or not, his chest was broad and his arms warm and strong.He pressed my face into his shoulder and rocked me while I sobbed.I tried for a bit to control myself, but he only hugged me harder, and said small and gentle things into the cloud of my hair, and I finally gave up and cried with the complete abandon of a child, until I was worn to utter limpness and hiccupping exhaustion.Come to think of it, Ive a wee giftie for ye, myself, Sassenach, he said, smoothing my hair.I sniffed and wiped my nose on my skirt, having nothing else handy.Im sorry I havent got anything to give you, I said, watching as he stood up and began to dig through the tumbled bedclothes.Probably looking for a handkerchief, I thought, sniffing some more.Aside from such minor gifts as my life, my manhood, and my right hand?he asked dryly.Theyll do nicely, mo duinne.He straightened up with a novices robe in one hand.Undress.My mouth fell open.What?Undress, Sassenach, and put this on.He handed me the robe, grinning.Or do ye want me to turn my back first?* * *    Clutching the rough homespun around me, I followed Jamie down yet another flight of dark stairs.This was the third, and the narrowest yet; the lantern he held lit the stone blocks of walls no more than eighteen inches apart.It felt rather like being swallowed up into the earth, as we went further and further down the narrow black shaft.Are you sure you know where youre going?I asked.My voice echoed in the stairwell, but with a curiously muffled sound, as though I were speaking underwater.Well, theres no much chance of taking the wrong turning, now is there?We had reached another landing, but true enough, the way ahead lay in only one directiondown.At the bottom of this flight of steps, though, we came to a door.There was a small landing, carved out of the solid side of a mountain, from the looks of it, and a wide, low door made of oak planks and brass hinging.The planks were grey with age, but still solid, and the landing swept clean.Plainly this part of the monastery was still in use, then.The wine cellar perhaps?There was a sconce near the door that held a torch, half burnt from previous use.Jamie paused to light it with a paper spill from the pile that lay ready nearby, then pushed open the unlocked door and ducked beneath the lintel, leaving me to follow.At first, I could see nothing at all inside but the glow of Jamies lantern.Everything was black.The lantern bobbed along, moving away from me.I stood still, following the blob of light with my eyes.Every few feet he would stop, then continue, and a slow flame would rise up in his wake to burn in a small red glow.As my eyes slowly accustomed themselves, the flames became a row of lanterns, situated on rock pillars, shining into the black like beacons.It was a cave.At first I thought it was a cave of crystals, because of the odd black shimmer beyond the lanterns.But I stepped forward to the first pillar and looked beyond, and then I saw it.A clear black lake.Transparent water, shimmering like glass over fine black volcanic sand, giving off red reflections in the lantern light.The air was damp and warm, humid with the steam that condensed on the cool cavern walls, running down the ribbed columns of rock.A hot spring.The faint scent of sulfur bit at my nostrils.A hot mineral spring, then.I remembered Anselms mentioning the springs that bubbled up from the ground near the abbey, renowned for their healing powers.Jamie stood behind me, looking out over the gently steaming expanse of jet and rubies.A hot bath, he said proudly.Do ye like it?Jesus H.  Roosevelt Christ, I said.Oh, ye do, he said, grinning at the success of his surprise.Come in, then.He dropped his own robe and stood glowing dimly in the darkness, patched with red in the glimmering reflections off the water.The arched ceiling of the cave seemed to swallow the light of the lanterns, so that the glow reached only a few feet before being engulfed.A little hesitantly, I let the novices robe drop from my arms.How hot is it?I asked.Hot enough, he answered.Dinna worry, it wont burn ye.But stay over an hour or so, and it might cook the flesh off your bones like soupmeat.What an appealing idea, I said, discarding the robe.Following his straight, slender figure, I stepped cautiously into the water.There were steps cut in the stone, leading down underwater, with a knotted rope fastened along the wall to provide handholds.The water flowed up over my hips, and the flesh of my belly shivered in delight as the heat swirled through me.At the bottom of the steps, I stood on clean black sand, the water just below the level of my shoulders, my breasts floating like glass fisher floats.My skin was flushed with the heat, and small prickles of perspiration were starting on the back of my neck, under the heavy hair.It was pure bliss.The surface of the spring was smooth and waveless, but the water wasnt still; I could feel small stirrings, currents running through the body of the pool like nerve impulses.It was that, I suppose, added to the incredible soothing heat, that gave me the momentary illusion that the spring was alivea warm, welcoming entity that reached out to soothe and embrace.Anselm had said that the springs had healing powers, and I wasnt disposed to doubt it.Jamie came up behind me, tiny wavelets marking his passage through the water.He reached around me to cup my breasts, softly smoothing the hot water over the upper slopes.Do ye like it, mo duinne?He bent forward and planted a kiss on my shoulder.I let my feet float out from under me, resting against him.Its wonderful!Its the first time Ive been warm all the way through since August.He began to tow me, backing slowly through the water; my legs streamed out in the wake of our passage, the amazing warmth passing down my limbs like caressing hands.He stopped, swung me around, and lowered me gently onto hard wood.Half visible in the shadowy underwater light, I could see planks set into a rocky niche.He sat down on the bench beside me, stretching his arms out on the rocky ledge behind us.Brother Ambrose brought me down here the other day to soak, he said.To soften the scars a bit.It does feel good, doesnt it?More than good.The water was so buoyant that I felt I might float away if I loosed my hold on the bench.I looked upward into the black shadows of the roof.Does anything live in this cave?Bats, I mean?Or fish?He shook his head.Nothing but the spirit of the spring, Sassenach.The water bubbles up from the earth through a narrow crack back therehe nodded toward the Stygian blackness at the back of the caveand trickles out through a dozen tiny openings in the rock.But theres no real opening to the outside, save the door into the monastery.Spirit of the spring?I said, amused.Sounds rather pagan, to be hiding under a monastery.He stretched luxuriously, long legs wavering under the glassy surface like the stems of water plants.Well, whatever ye wish to call it, its been here a good deal longer than the monastery.Yes, I can see that.The walls of the cave were of smooth, dark volcanic rock, almost like black glass, slick with the moisture of the spring.The whole chamber looked like a gigantic bubble, half filled with that curiously alive but sterile water.I felt as though we were cradled in the womblike center of the earth, and that if I pressed my ear to the rock, I would hear the infinitely slow beat of a great heart nearby.We were very quiet for a long time then, half floating, half dreaming, brushing now and then against each other as we drifted in the unseen currents of the cave.When I spoke at last, my voice seemed slow and drugged.Ive decided.Ah.Will it be Rome, then?Jamies voice seemed to come from a long way away.Yes.I dont know, once there  It doesna matter.We shall do what we can.His hand reached for me, moving so slowly I thought it would never touch me.He drew me close, until the sensitive tips of my breasts rubbed across his chest.The water was not only warm but heavy, almost oily to the touch, and his hands floated down my back to cup my buttocks and lift me.The intrusion was startling.Hot and slippery as our skins were, we drifted over each other with barely a sensation of touching or pressure, but his presence within me was solid and intimate, a fixed point in a watery world, like an umbilical cord in the random driftings of the womb.I made a brief sound of surprise at the small inrush of hot water that accompanied his entrance, then settled firmly onto my fixed point of reference with a little sigh of pleasure.Oh, I like that one, he said appreciatively.Like what?I asked.That sound that ye made.The little squeak.It wasnt possible to blush; my skin was already as flushed as it could get.I let my hair swing forward to cover my face, the curls relaxing as they dragged the surface of the water.Im sorry; I didnt mean to be noisy.He laughed, the deep sound echoing softly in the columns of the roof.I said I like it.And I do.Its one of the things I like the best about bedding ye, Sassenach, the small noises that ye make.He pulled me closer, so my forehead rested against his neck.Moisture sprang up at once between us, slick as the sulfur laden water.He made a slight movement with his hips, and I drew in my breath in a half stifled gasp.Yes, like that, he said softly.Orlike that?Urk, I said.He laughed again, but kept doing it.Thats what I thought most about, he said, drawing his hands slowly up and down my back, cupping, curving, tracing the swell of my hips.In prison at night, chained in a room with a dozen other men, listening to the snoring and farting and groaning.I thought of those small tender sounds that ye make when I love you, and I could feel ye there next to me in the dark, breathing soft and then faster, and the little grunt that ye give when I first take you, as though ye were settling yourself to your job.My breathing was definitely coming faster.Supported by the dense, mineral saturated water, I was buoyant as an oiled feather, kept from floating away only by my grip on the curved muscles of his shoulders, and the snug, firm clasp I kept of him lower down.Even better, his voice was a hot murmur in my ear, when I come to ye fierce and wanting, and ye whimper under me, and struggle as though you wanted to get away, and I know its only that youre struggling to come closer, and Im fighting the same fight.His hands were exploring, gently, slowly as tickling a trout, sliding deep into the rift of my buttocks, gliding lower, groping, caressing the stretched and yearning point of our joining.I quivered and the breath went from me in an unwilled gasp.Or when I come to you needing, and ye take me into you with a sigh and that quiet hum like a hive of bees in the sun, and ye carry me wi you into peace with a little moaning sound.Jamie, I said hoarsely, my voice echoing off the water.Jamie, please.Not yet, mo duinne.His hands came hard around my waist, settling and slowing me, pressing me down until I did groan.Not yet.Weve time.And I mean to hear ye groan like that again.And to moan and sob, even though you dinna wish to, for ye canna help it.I mean to make you sigh as though your heart would break, and scream with the wanting, and at last to cry out in my arms, and I shall know that Ive served ye well.The rush began between my thighs, shooting like a dart into the depths of my belly, loosening my joints so that my hands slipped limp and helpless off his shoulders.My back arched and the slippery firm roundness of my breasts pressed flat against his chest.I shuddered in hot darkness, Jamies steadying hands all that kept me from drowning.Resting against him, I felt boneless as a jellyfish.I didnt knowor carewhat sort of sounds I had been making, but I felt incapable of coherent speech.Until he began to move again, strong as a shark under the dark water.No, I said.Jamie, no.I cant bear it like that again.The blood was still pounding in my fingertips and his movement within me was an exquisite torture.You can, for I love ye.His voice was half muffled in my soaking hair.And you will, for I want ye.But this time, I go wi you.He held my hips firm against him, carrying me beyond myself with the force of an undertow.I crashed formless against him, like breakers on a rock, and he met me with the brutal force of granite, my anchor in the pounding chaos.Boneless and liquid as the water around us, contained only by the frame of his hands, I cried out, the soft, bubbling half choked cry of a sailor sucked beneath the waves.And heard his own cry, helpless in return, and knew I had served him well.* * *    We struggled upward, out of the womb of the world, damp and steaming, rubber limbed with wine and heat.I fell to my knees at the first landing, and Jamie, trying to help me, fell down next to me in an untidy heap of robes and bare legs.Giggling helplessly, drunk more with love than with wine, we made our way side by side, on hands and knees up the second flight of steps, hindering each other more than helping, jostling and caroming softly off each other in the narrow space, until we collapsed at last in each others arms on the second landing.Here an ancient oriel window opened glassless to the sky, and the light of the hunters moon washed us in silver.We lay clasped together, damp skins cooling in the winter air, waiting for our racing hearts to slow and breath to return to our heaving bodies.The moon above was a Christmas moon, so large as almost to fill the empty window.It seemed no wonder that the tides of sea and woman should be subject to the pull of that stately orb, so close and so commanding.But my own tides moved no longer to that chaste and sterile summons, and the knowledge of my freedom raced like danger through my blood.I have a gift for you too, I said suddenly to Jamie.He turned toward me and his hand slid, large and sure, over the plane of my still flat stomach.Have you, now?he said.And the world was all around us, new with possibility.Read on for a special preview of    The second novel in the Outlander series  Available wherever books are sold  DELACORTE PRESS      THE PRETENDERS LE HAVRE, FRANCE, 1744    Bread, I muttered feebly, keeping my eyes tightly closed.There was no response from the large, warm object next to me, other than the faint sigh of his breathing.Bread!I said, a little louder.There was a sudden startled heave of the bedclothes, and I grasped the edge of the mattress and tightened all my muscles, hoping to stabilize the pitch and yaw of my internal organs.Fumbling noises came from the far side of the bed, followed by the sliding of a drawer, a muffled exclamation in Gaelic, the soft thud of a bare foot stamping planks, and then the sinking of the mattress under the weight of a heavy body.Here, Sassenach, said an anxious voice, and I felt the touch of a dry bread crust against my lower lip.Groping blindly without opening my eyes, I grasped it and began to chew gingerly, forcing each choking bite down a parched throat.I knew better than to ask for water.The dessicated wads of bread crumbs gradually made their way down my throat and took up residence in my stomach, where they lay like small heaps of ballast.The nauseating roll of my inner waves slowly calmed, and at last my innards lay at anchor.I opened my eyes, to see the anxious face of Jamie Fraser hovering a few inches above me.Ak!I said, startled.All right, then?he asked.When I nodded and feebly began to sit up, he put an arm around my back to help me.Sitting down beside me on the rough inn bed, he pulled me gently against him and stroked my sleep tousled hair.Poor love, he said.Would a bit of wine help?Theres a flask of hock in my saddlebag.No.No, thank you.I shuddered briefly at the thought of drinking hockI seemed to smell the dark, fruity fumes, just at the mention of itand pushed myself upright.Ill be fine in a moment, I said, with forced cheerfulness.Dont worry, its quite normal for pregnant women to feel sick in the morning.With a dubious look at me, Jamie rose and went to retrieve his clothes from the stool near the window.France in February is cold as hell frozen over, and the bubbled glass panes of the window were coated thick with frost.He was naked, and a ripple of gooseflesh brushed his shoulders and raised the red gold hairs on his arms and legs.Accustomed to cold, though, he neither shivered nor hurried as he pulled on stockings and shirt.Pausing in his dressing, he came back to the bed and hugged me briefly.Go back to bed, he suggested.Ill send up the chambermaid to light the fire.Perhaps ye can rest a bit, now youve eaten.You wont be sick now?I wasnt entirely sure, but nodded reassuringly.I dont think so.I cast an eye back at the bed; the quilts, like most coverings supplied by public inns, were none too clean.Still, the silver in Jamies purse had procured us the best room in the inn, and the narrow bed was stuffed with goose feathers rather than with chaff or wool.Um, perhaps I will just lie down a moment, I murmured, pulling my feet off the freezing floor and thrusting them under the quilts, in search of the last remnants of warmth.My stomach seemed to have settled sufficiently to risk a sip of water, and I poured a cupful from the cracked bedroom ewer.What were you stamping on?I asked, sipping carefully.There arent spiders up here, are there?Fastening his kilt about his waist, Jamie shook his head.Och, no, he said.Hands busy, he tilted his head toward the table.Just a rat.After the bread, I expect.Glancing down, I saw the limp gray form on the floor, a small pearl of blood glistening on the snout.I made it out of bed just in time.Its all right, I said faintly, a bit later.There isnt anything left to throw up.Rinse your mouth, Sassenach, but dont swallow, for Gods sake.Jamie held the cup for me, wiped my mouth with a cloth as though I were a small and messy child, then lifted me and laid me carefully back in the bed.He frowned worriedly down at me.Perhaps Id better stay here, he said.I could send word.No, no, Im all right, I said.And I was.Fight as I would to keep from vomiting in the mornings, I could hold nothing down for long.Yet once the bout was over, I felt entirely restored.Aside from a sour taste in my mouth, and a slight soreness in the abdominal muscles, I felt quite my normal self.I threw back the covers and stood up, to demonstrate.See?Ill be fine.And you have to go; it wouldnt do to keep your cousin waiting, after all.I was beginning to feel cheerful again, despite the chilly air rushing under the door and beneath the folds of my nightgown.Jamie was still hesitating, reluctant to leave me, and I went to him and hugged him tightly, both in reassurance and because he was delightfully warm.Brrr, I said.How on earth can you be warm as toast, dressed in nothing but a kilt?Ive a shirt on as well, he protested, smiling down at me.We clung together for a bit, enjoying each others warmth in the quiet cold of the early French morning.In the corridor, the clash and shuffle of the chambermaid with her scuttle of kindling grew nearer.Jamie shifted a bit, pressing against me.Because of the difficulties of traveling in the winter, we had been nearly a week on the road from Ste.Anne to Le Havre.And between the late arrivals at dismal inns, wet, filthy, and shivering with fatigue and cold, and the increasingly unsettled wakenings as my morning sickness got worse, we had scarcely touched each other since our last night at the Abbey.Come to bed with me?I invited, softly.He hesitated.The strength of his desire was obvious through the fabric of his kilt, and his hands were warm on the cool flesh of my own, but he didnt move to take me in his arms.Well  he said doubtfully.You want to, dont you?I said, sliding a chilly hand under his kilt to make sure.Oh!er  aye.Aye, I do.The evidence at hand bore out this statement.He groaned faintly as I cupped my hand between his legs.Oh, Lord.Dont do that, Sassenach; I canna keep my hands from ye.He did hug me then, wrapping long arms about me and pulling my face into the snowy tucks of his shirt, smelling faintly of the laundry starch Brother Alfonse used at the Abbey.Why should you?I said, muffled in his linen.Youve a bit of time to spare, surely?Its only a short ride to the docks.It isna that, he said, smoothing my riotous hair.Oh, Im too fat?In fact, my stomach was still nearly flat, and I was thinner than usual because of the sickness.Or is it ?No, he said, smiling.Ye talk too much.He bent and kissed me, then scooped me up and sat down on the bed, holding me on his lap.I lay down and pulled him determinedly down on top of me.Claire, no!he protested as I started unbuckling his kilt.I stared at him.Whyever not?Well, he said awkwardly, blushing a bit.The child  I mean, I dinna want to hurt it.I laughed.Jamie, you cant hurt it.Its no bigger than the tip of my finger yet.I held up a finger in illustration, then used it to trace the full, curving line of his lower lip.He seized my hand and bent to kiss me abruptly, as though to erase the tickle of my touch.Youre sure?he asked.I mean I keep thinking he wouldna like being jounced about   Hell never notice, I assured him, hands once more busy with the buckle of his kilt.Well  if youre sure of it.There was a peremptory rap at the door, and with impeccable Gallic timing, the chambermaid pushed her way in backward, carelessly gouging the door with a billet of wood as she turned.From the scarred surfaces of door and jamb, it appeared that this was her usual method of operations.Bonjour, Monsieur, Madame, she muttered, with a curt nod toward the bed as she shuffled toward the hearth.All right for some people, said her attitude, louder than words.Used by this time to the matter of factness with which servants treated the sight of inn patrons in any form of dishabille, I merely murmured Bonjour, Mademoiselle, in return and let it go at that.I also let go of Jamies kilt, and slid under the covers, pulling the quilt up to hide my scarlet cheeks.Possessed of somewhat greater sang froid, Jamie placed one of the bolsters strategically across his lap, parked his elbows on it, rested his chin on upturned palms, and made pleasant conversation with the maid, praising the cuisine of the house.And from where do you procure the wine, Mademoiselle?he asked politely.From here, from there.She shrugged, stuffing kindling rapidly under the sticks with a practiced hand.Wherever its cheapest.The womans plump face creased slightly as she gave Jamie a sidelong look from the hearth.I gathered as much, he said, grinning at her, and she gave a brief snort of amusement.Ill wager I can match the price youre getting, and double the quality, he offered.Tell your mistress.One eyebrow rose skeptically.And whats your own price, Monsieur?He made an altogether Gallic gesture of selfabnegation.Nothing, Mademoiselle.I go to call upon a kinsman who sells wine.Perhaps I can bring him some new business to ensure my welcome, no?She nodded, seeing the wisdom of this, and grunted as she rose from her knees.Well enough, Monsieur.Ill speak to the patronne.The door thumped to behind the maid, aided by a skillful swing of her hip in passing.Putting the bolster aside, Jamie stood up and began to rebuckle his kilt.Where do you think youre going?I protested.He glanced down at me, and a reluctant smile curved the wide mouth.Oh.Well  youre sure youre up to it, Sassenach?I am if you are, I said, unable to resist.He eyed me austerely.Just for that, I should go at once, he said.Still, Ive heard that ye ought to humor expectant mothers.He let the kilt fall to the floor and sat down beside me in his shirt, the bed creaking beneath his weight.His breath rose in a faint cloud as he turned back the quilt and spread the front of the nightdress to expose my breasts.Bending his head, he kissed each one, touching the nipple delicately with his tongue, so it rose as though by magic, a swelling dark pink against the white skin of my breast.God, theyre so lovely, he murmured, repeating the process on the other side.He cupped both breasts, admiring them.Theyre heavier, he said, just a bit.And the nipples are darker, too.One forefinger traced the springing curve of a single fine hair that rose near the dark areola, silver in the frosted light of the morning.Lifting the quilt, he rolled next to me and I turned into his arms, clasping the solid curves of his back, letting my hands cup the firm rounds of his buttocks.His bare flesh was chilled by the morning air, but the goose bumps smoothed away under the warmth of my touch.I tried to bring him to me at once, but he resisted me gently, forcing me down onto the pillow as he nibbled the edges of neck and ear.One hand slid up my thigh, the thin material of the nightgown gliding in waves before it.His head dipped lower, and his hands gently spread my thighs apart.I shivered momentarily as the cold air hit the bare skin of my legs, then relaxed completely into the warm demand of his mouth.His hair was loose, not yet laced back for the day, and the soft red tickle of it brushed my thighs.The solid weight of his body rested comfortably between my legs, broad hands cupped on the roundness of my hips.Mmmm?came an interrogative sound from below.I arched my hips slightly in response, and a brief chuckle grazed my skin with warmth.The hands slid beneath my hips and raised me, and I relaxed into deliquescence as the tiny shudder grew and spread, rising in seconds to a fulfillment that left me limp and gasping, Jamies head resting on my thigh.He waited a moment for me to recover, caressing the slope of my leg, before returning to his self appointed task.I smoothed the tumbled hair back, caressing those ears, so incongruously small and neat for such a large, blunt man.The upper curve glowed with a faint, translucent pink, and I ran my thumb along the edge of the curve.Theyre pointed at the tips, I said.Just a bit.Like a fauns.Oh, aye?he said, interrupting his labors for a moment.Like a small deer, ye mean, or the things ye see in classical paintings wi goats legs, chasing naked women?I lifted my head and peered down across the roil of bedclothes, nightgown, and naked flesh, to the deep blue cat eyes, gleaming above damp curls of brown hair.If the shoe fits, I said, wear it.And let my head fall back on the pillow as the resultant muffled laugh vibrated against my all too sensitive flesh.Oh, I said, straining upward.Oh, my.Jamie, come here.Not yet, he said, doing something with the tip of his tongue that made me squirm uncontrollably.Now, I said.He didnt bother to reply, and I had no more breath to speak with.Oh, I said, a bit later.Thats   Mmmm?Good, I murmured.Come here.No, Ill do, he said, face invisible behind the tangle of roan and cinnamon.Would ye like it if I   Jamie, I said.I want you.Come here.Sighing in resignation, he rose to his knees and let me pull him upward, settling at last with his weight balanced on his elbows, but comfortingly solid on top of me, belly to belly and lips to lips.He opened his mouth to protest further, but I promptly kissed him, and he slid between my thighs before he could stop himself.He moaned slightly in involuntary pleasure as he entered me, muscles tensing as he gripped my shoulders.He was gentle and slow, pausing now and then to kiss me deeply, moving again only at my silent urging.I ran my hands softly down the slope of his back, careful not to press on the healing ridges of the fresh scars.The long muscles of his thigh trembled briefly against my own, but he held back, unwilling to move as quickly as he needed to.I moved my hips against him, to bring him deeper.He closed his eyes, and his brow furrowed slightly in concentration.His mouth was open, and his breath came hard.I cant  he said.Oh, God, I canna help it.His buttocks clenched suddenly, taut beneath my hands.I sighed with deep satisfaction, and pulled him hard against me.Youre all right?he asked, a few moments later.I wont break, you know, I said, smiling into his eyes.He laughed huskily.Maybe not, Sassenach, but I may.He gathered me close against him, his cheek pressed against my hair.I flipped the quilt up and tucked it around his shoulders, sealing us in a pocket of warmth.The heat of the fire had not yet reached the bed, but the ice on the window was thawing, the crusted edge of the rime melted into glowing diamonds.We lay quiet for a time, listening to the occasional crack of the burning applewood in the hearth and the faint sounds of the inn as the guests stirred to life.There were callings to and fro from the balconies across the courtyard, the swish and clop of hooves on the slushy stones outside, and the odd squeal now and then from below, from the piglets the landlady was raising in the kitchen behind the stove.Trs franais, nest ce pas?I said, smiling at the sounds of an altercation drifting up through the floorboards, an amiable settling of accounts between the innkeepers wife and the local vintner.Diseased son of a pox ridden whore, the female voice remarked.The brandy from last week tasted like horse piss.I didnt need to see the reply to imagine the one shouldered shrug that went with it.How would you know, Madame?After the sixth glass, it all tastes the same, is it not so?The bed shook slightly as Jamie laughed with me.He lifted his head from the pillow and sniffed appreciatively at the scent of frying ham that filtered through the drafty chinks of the floorboards.Aye, its France, he agreed.Food, and drinkand love.He patted my bare hip before tugging the wrinkled gown down over it.Jamie, I said softly, are you happy about it?About the baby?Outlawed in Scotland, barred from his own home, and with only vague prospects in France, he could pardonably have been less than enthused about acquiring an additional obligation.He was silent for a moment, only hugging me harder, then sighed briefly before answering.Aye, Sassenach.His hand strayed downward, gently rubbing my belly.Im happy.And proud as a stallion.But I am most awfully afraid, too.About the birth?Ill be all right.I could hardly blame him for apprehension; his own mother had died in childbirth, and birth and its complications were the leading cause of death for women in these times.Still, I knew a thing or two myself, and I had no intention whatever of exposing myself to what passed for medical care here.Aye, thatand everything, he said softly.I want to protect ye, Sassenachspread myself over ye like a cloak and shield you and the child wi my body.His voice was soft and husky, with a slight catch in it.I would do anything for ye  and yet  theres nothing I can do.It doesna matter how strong I am, or how willing; I canna go with you where ye must go  nor even help ye at all.And to think of the things that might happen, and me helpless to stop them  aye, Im afraid, Sassenach.And yethe turned me toward him, hand closing gently over one breastyet when I think of you wi my child at your breast  then I feel as though Ive gone hollow as a soap bubble, and perhaps I shall burst with joy.He pressed me tight against his chest, and I hugged him with all my might.Oh, Claire, ye do break my heart wi loving you.***   I slept for some time, and woke slowly, hearing the clang of a church bell ringing in the nearby square.Fresh from the Abbey of Ste.Anne, where all the days activities took place to the rhythm of bells, I automatically glanced at the window, to gauge the intensity of the light and guess the time of day.Bright, clear light, and a window free of ice.The bells rang for the Angelus then, and it was noon.I stretched, enjoying the blissful knowledge that I neednt get up at once.Early pregnancy made me tired, and the strain of travel had added to my fatigue, making the long rest doubly welcome.It had rained and snowed unceasingly on the journey as the winter storms battered the French coast.Still, it could have been worse.We had originally intended to go to Rome, not Le Havre.That would have been three or four weeks travel, in this weather.Faced with the prospect of earning a living abroad, Jamie had obtained a recommendation as a translator to James Francis Edward Stuart, exiled King of Scotlandor merely the Chevalier St.George, Pretender to the Throne, depending on your loyaltiesand we had determined to join the Pretenders court near Rome.It had been a near thing, at that; we had been on the point of leaving for Italy, when Jamies uncle Alexander, Abbot of Ste.Annes, had summoned us to his study.I have heard from His Majesty, he announced without preamble.Which one?Jamie asked.The slight family resemblance between the two men was exaggerated by their postureboth sat bolt upright in their chairs, shoulders squared.On the abbots part, the posture was due to natural asceticism; on Jamies, to reluctance to let the newly healed scars on his back contact the wood of the chair.His Majesty King James, his uncle replied, frowning slightly at me.I was careful to keep my face blank; my presence in Abbot Alexanders study was a mark of trust, and I didnt want to do anything to jeopardize it.He had known me a bare six weeks, since the day after Christmas, when I had appeared at his gate with Jamie, who was near death from torture and imprisonment.Subsequent acquaintance had presumably given the abbot some confidence in me.On the other hand, I was still English.And the English Kings name was George, not James.Aye?Is he not in need of a translator, then?Jamie was still thin, but he had been working outdoors with the Brothers who minded the stables and fields of the Abbey, and his face was regaining tinges of its normal healthy color.He is in need of a loyal servantand a friend.Abbot Alexander tapped his fingers on a folded letter that lay on his desk, the crested seal broken.He pursed his lips, glancing from me to his nephew and back.What I tell you now must not be repeated, he said sternly.It will be common knowledge soon, but for now I had tried to look trustworthy and close mouthed; Jamie merely nodded, with a touch of impatience.His Highness, Prince Charles Edward, has left Rome, and will arrive in France within the week, the Abbot said, leaning slightly forward as though to emphasize the importance of what he was saying.And it was important.James Stuart had mounted an abortive attempt to regain his throne in 1715an ill considered military operation that had failed almost immediately for lack of support.Since thenaccording to Alexanderthe exiled James of Scotland had worked tirelessly, writing ceaselessly to his fellow monarchs, and particularly to his cousin, Louis of France, reiterating the legitimacy of his claim to the throne of Scotland and England, and the position of his son, Prince Charles, as heir to that throne.His royal cousin Louis has been distressingly deaf to these entirely proper claims, the Abbot had said, frowning at the letter as though it were Louis.If hes now come to a realization of his responsibilities in the matter, its cause for great rejoicing among those who hold dear the sacred right of kingship.Among the Jacobites, that was, Jamess supporters.Of whom Abbot Alexander of the Abbey of Ste.Anneborn Alexander Fraser of Scotlandwas one.Jamie had told me that Alexander was one of the exiled Kings most frequent correspondents, in touch with all that touched the Stuart cause.Hes well placed for it, Jamie had explained to me, discussing the endeavor on which we were about to embark.The papal messenger system crosses Italy, France, and Spain faster than almost any other.And the papal messengers canna be interfered with by government customs officers, so the letters they carry are less likely to be intercepted.James of Scotland, exiled in Rome, was supported in large part by the Pope, in whose interest it very much was to have a Catholic monarchy restored to England and Scotland.Therefore, the largest part of Jamess private mail was carried by papal messengerand passed through the hands of loyal supporters within the Church hierarchy, like Abbot Alexander of Ste.Anne de Beaupr, who could be depended on to communicate with the Kings supporters in Scotland, with less risk than sending letters openly from Rome to Edinburgh and the Highlands.I watched Alexander with interest, as he expounded the importance of Prince Charless visit to France.A stocky man of about my own height, he was dark, and considerably shorter than his nephew, but shared with him the faintly slanted eyes, the sharp intelligence, and the talent for discerning hidden motive that seemed to characterize the Frasers I had met.So, he finished, stroking his full, dark brown beard, I cannot say whether His Highness is in France at Louiss invitation, or has come uninvited, on behalf of his father.It makes a wee bit of difference, Jamie remarked, raising one eyebrow skeptically.His uncle nodded, and a wry smile showed briefly in the thicket of his beard.True, lad, he said, letting a faint hint of his native Scots emerge from his usual formal English.Very true.And thats where you and your wife may be of service, if ye will.The proposal was simple; His Majesty King James would provide travel expenses and a small stipend, if the nephew of his most loyal and most esteemed friend Alexander would agree to travel to Paris, there to assist his son, His Highness Prince Charles Edward, in whatever ways the latter might require.I was stunned.We had meant originally to go to Rome because that seemed the best place to embark on our quest: the prevention of the second Jacobite Risingthe 45.From my own knowledge of history, I knew that the Rising, financed from France and carried out by Charles Edward Stuart, would go much farther than had his fathers attempt in 1715but not nearly far enough.If matters progressed as I thought they would, then the troops under Bonnie Prince Charlie would meet with disastrous defeat at Culloden in 1746, and the people of the Highlands would suffer the repercussions of defeat for two centuries thereafter.Now, in 1744, apparently Charles himself was just beginning his search for support in France.Where better to try to stop a rebellion, than at the side of its leader?I glanced at Jamie, who was looking over his uncles shoulder at a small shrine set into the wall.His eyes rested on the gilded figure of Ste.Anne herself and the small sheaf of hothouse flowers laid at her feet, while his thoughts worked behind an expressionless face.At last he blinked once, and smiled at his uncle.Whatever assistance His Highness might require?Aye, he said quietly, I think I can do that.Well go.And we had.Instead of proceeding directly to Paris, though, we had come down the coast from Ste.Anne to Le Havre, to meet first with Jamies cousin, Jared Fraser.A prosperous Scottish migr, Jared was an importer of wines and spirits, with a small warehouse and large town house in Paris, and a very large warehouse indeed here in Le Havre, where he had asked Jamie to meet him, when Jamie had written to say we were en route to Paris.Sufficiently rested by now, I was beginning to feel hungry.There was food on the table; Jamie must have told the chambermaid to bring it while I slept.I had no dressing gown, but my heavy velvet traveling cloak was handy; I sat up and pulled the warm weight of it over my shoulders before rising to relieve myself, add another stick of wood to the fire, and sit down to my late breakfast.I chewed hard rolls and baked ham contentedly, washing them down with the jug of milk provided.I hoped Jamie was being adequately fed as well; he insisted that Jared was a good friend, but I had my doubts about the hospitality of some of Jamies relatives, having met a few of them by now.True, Abbot Alexander had welcomed usinsofar as a man in the abbots position could be said to welcome having an outlaw nephew with a suspect wife descend upon him unexpectedly.But our sojourn with Jamies mothers people, the MacKenzies of Leoch, had come within inches of killing me the autumn before, when I had been arrested and tried as a witch.Granted, Id said, this Jareds a Fraser, and they seem a trifle safer than your MacKenzie relatives.But have you actually met him before?I lived with him for a time when I was eighteen, he told me, dribbling candle wax onto his reply and pressing his fathers wedding ring on the resultant greenish gray puddle.A small cabochon ruby, its mount was engraved with the Fraser clan motto, je suis prest: I am ready.He had me to stay with him when I came to Paris to finish my schooling, and learn a bit of the world.He was verra kind to me; a good friend of my fathers.And theres no one knows more about Parisian society than the man who sells it drink, he added, cracking the ring loose from the hardened wax.I want to talk to Jared before I walk into Louiss court by the side of Charles Stuart; I should like to feel that I have some chance of getting out again, he finished wryly.Why?Do you think therell be trouble?I asked.Whatever assistance His Highness might require seemed to offer quite a bit of latitude.He smiled at my worried look.No, I dinna expect any difficulty.But what is it the Bible says, Sassenach?Put not your trust in princes?He rose and kissed me quickly on the brow, tucking the ring back in his sporran.Who am I to ignore the word of God, eh?***   I spent the afternoon in reading one of the herbals that my friend Brother Ambrose had pressed upon me as a parting gift, then in necessary repairs with needle and thread.Neither of us owned many clothes, and while there were advantages in traveling light, it meant that holey socks and undone hems demanded immediate attention.My needlecase was nearly as precious to me as the small chest in which I carried herbs and medicines.The needle dipped in and out of the fabric, winking in the light from the window.I wondered how Jamies visit with Jared was going.I wondered still more what Prince Charles would be like.He would be the first historically famous person I had met, and while I knew better than to believe all the legends that had (not had, would, I reminded myself) sprung up around him, the reality of the man was a mystery.The Rising of the 45 would depend almost entirely on the personality of this one young manits failure or success.Whether it took place at all might depend upon the efforts of another young manJamie Fraser.And me.I was still absorbed in my mending and my thoughts, when heavy footsteps in the corridor aroused me to the realization that it was late in the day; the drip of water from the eaves had slowed as the temperature dropped, and the flames of the sinking sun glowed in the ice spears hanging from the roof.The door opened, and Jamie came in.He smiled vaguely in my direction, then stopped dead by the table, face absorbed as though he were trying to remember something.He took his cloak off, folded it, and hung it neatly over the foot of the bed, straightened, marched over to the other stool, sat down on it with great precision, and closed his eyes.I sat still, my mending forgotten in my lap, watching this performance with considerable interest.After a moment, he opened his eyes and smiled at me, but didnt say anything.He leaned forward, studying my face with great attention, as though he hadnt seen me in weeks.At last, an expression of profound revelation passed over his face, and he relaxed, shoulders slumping as he rested his elbows on his knees.Whisky, he said, with immense satisfaction.I see, I said cautiously.A lot of it?He shook his head slowly from side to side, as though it were very heavy.I could almost hear the contents sloshing.Not me, he said, very distinctly.You.Me?I said indignantly.Your eyes, he said.He smiled beatifically.His own eyes were soft and dreamy, cloudy as a trout pool in the rain.My eyes?What have my eyes got to do with   Theyre the color of verra fine whisky, wi the sun shining through them from behind.I thought this morning they looked like sherry, but I was wrong.Not sherry.Not brandy.Its whisky.Thats what it is.He looked so gratified as he said this that I couldnt help laughing.Jamie, youre terribly drunk.What have you been doing?His expression altered to a slight frown.Im not drunk.Oh, no?I laid the mending aside and came over to lay a hand on his forehead.It was cool and damp, though his face was flushed.He at once put his arms about my waist and pulled me close, nuzzling affectionately at my bosom.The smell of mingled spirits rose from him like a fog, so thick as almost to be visible.Come here to me, Sassenach, he murmured.My whisky eyed lass, my love.Let me take ye to bed.I thought it a debatable point as to who was likely to be taking whom to bed, but didnt argue.It didnt matter why he thought he was going to bed, after all, provided he got there.I bent and got a shoulder under his armpit to help him up, but he leaned away, rising slowly and majestically under his own power.I dinna need help, he said, reaching for the cord at the neck of his shirt.I told ye, Im not drunk.Youre right, I said.Drunk isnt anywhere near sufficient to describe your current state.Jamie, youre completely pissed.His eyes traveled down the front of his kilt, across the floor, and up the front of my gown.No, Im not, he said, with great dignity.I did that outside.He took a step toward me, glowing with ardor.Come here to me, Sassenach; Im ready.I thought ready was a bit of an overstatement in one regard; hed gotten his buttons half undone, and his shirt hung askew on his shoulders, but that was as far as he was likely to make it unaided.In other respects, though  the broad expanse of his chest was exposed, showing the small hollow in the center where I was accustomed to rest my chin, and the small curly hairs sprang up joyous around his nipples.He saw me looking at him, and reached for one of my hands, clasping it to his breast.He was startlingly warm, and I moved instinctively toward him.The other arm swept round me and he bent to kiss me.He made such a thorough job of it that I felt mildly intoxicated, merely from sharing his breath.All right, I said, laughing.If youre ready, so am I.  Let me undress you first, thoughIve had enough mending today.He stood still as I stripped him, scarcely moving.He didnt move, either, as I attended to my own clothes and turned down the bed.I climbed in and turned to look at him, ruddy and magnificent in the sunset glow.He was finely made as a Greek statue, long nosed and high cheeked as a profile on a Roman coin.The wide, soft mouth was set in a dreamy smile, and the slanted eyes looked far away.He was perfectly immobile.I viewed him with some concern.Jamie, I said, how, exactly, do you decide whether youre drunk?Aroused by my voice, he swayed alarmingly to one side, but caught himself on the edge of the mantelpiece.His eyes drifted around the room, then fixed on my face.For an instant, they blazed clear and pellucid with intelligence.Och, easy, Sassenach.If ye can stand up, youre not drunk.He let go of the mantelpiece, took a step toward me, and crumpled slowly onto the hearth, eyes blank, and a wide, sweet smile on his dreaming face.Oh, I said.***   The yodeling of roosters outside and the clashing of pots below woke me just after dawn the next morning.The figure next to me jerked, waking abruptly, then froze as the sudden movement jarred his head.I raised up on one elbow to examine the remains.Not too bad, I thought critically.His eyes were screwed tightly shut against stray beams of sunlight, and his hair stuck out in all directions like a hedgehogs spines, but his skin was pale and clear, and the hands clutching the coverlet were steady.I pried up one eyelid, peered within, and said playfully, Anybody home?The twin to the eye I was looking at opened slowly, to add its baleful glare to the first.I dropped my hand and smiled charmingly at him.Good morning.That, Sassenach, is entirely a matter of opinion, he said, and closed both eyes again.Have you got any idea how much you weigh?I asked conversationally.No.The abruptness of the reply suggested that he not only didnt know, he didnt care, but I persisted in my efforts.Something around fifteen stone, I make it.About as much as a good sized boar.Unfortunately, I didnt have any beaters to hang you upside down from a spear and carry you home to the smoking shed.One eye opened again, and looked consideringly at me, then at the hearthstone on the far side of the room.One corner of his mouth lifted in a reluctant smile.How did you get me in bed?I didnt.I couldnt budge you, so I just laid a quilt over you and left you on the hearth.You came to life and crawled in under your own power, somewhere in the middle of the night.He seemed surprised, and opened the other eye again.I did?I nodded and tried to smooth down the hair that spiked out over his left ear.Oh, yes.Very single minded, you were.Single minded?He frowned, thinking, and stretched, thrusting his arms up over his head.Then he looked startled.No.I couldnt have.Yes, you could.Twice.He squinted down his chest, as though looking for confirmation of this improbable statement, then looked back at me.Really?Well, thats hardly fair; I dinna remember a thing about it.He hesitated for a moment, looking shy.Was it all right, then?I didna do anything foolish?I flopped down next to him and snuggled my head into the curve of his shoulder.No, I wouldnt call it foolish.You werent very conversational, though.Thank the Lord for small blessings, he said, and a small chuckle rumbled through his chest.Mm.Youd forgotten how to say anything except I love you, but you said that a lot.The chuckle came back, louder this time.Oh, aye?Well, could have been worse, I suppose.He drew in his breath, then paused.He turned his head and sniffed suspiciously at the soft tuft of cinnamon under his raised arm.Christ!he said.He tried to push me away.Ye dinna want to put your head near my oxter, Sassenach.I smell like a boar thats been dead a week.And pickled in brandy after, I agreed, snuggling closer.How on earth did you get soahemstinking drunk, anyway?Jareds hospitality.He settled himself in the pillows with a deep sigh, arm round my shoulder.He took me down to show me his warehouse at the docks.And the storeroom there where he keeps the rare vintages and the Portuguese brandy and the Jamaican rum.He grimaced slightly, recalling.The wine wasna so bad, for that you just taste, and spit it on the floor when youve done wi a mouthful.But neither of us could see wasting the brandy that way.Besides, Jared said ye need to let it trickle down the back of your throat, to appreciate it fully.How much of it did you appreciate?I asked curiously.I lost count in the middle of the second bottle.Just then, a church bel started to ring nearby; the summons to early Mass.Jamie sat bolt upright, staring at the windowpane, bright with sun.Christ, Sassenach!What time is it?About six, I suppose, I said, puzzled.Why?He relaxed slightly, though he stayed sitting up.Oh, thats all right, then.I was afraid it was the Angelus bell.Id lost all track of time.Id say so.Does it matter?In a burst of energy, he threw back the quilts and stood up.He staggered a moment, but kept his balance, though both hands went to his head, to make sure it was still attached.Aye, he said, gasping a bit.Weve an appointment this morning down at the docks, at Jareds warehouse.The two of us.Really?I clambered out of bed myself, and groped for the chamber pot under the bed.If hes planning to finish the job, I shouldnt think hed want witnesses.Jamies head popped through the neck of his shirt, eyebrows raised.Finish the job?Well, most of your other relatives seem to want to kill you or me; why not Jared?Hes made a good start at poisoning you, seems to me.Verra funny, Sassenach, he said dryly.Have ye something decent to wear?I had been wearing a serviceable gray serge gown on our travels, acquired through the good offices of the almoner at the Abbey of Ste.Anne, but I did also have the gown in which I had escaped from Scotland, a gift from Lady Annabelle MacRannoch.A pretty leaf green velvet, it made me look rather pale, but was stylish enough.I think so, if there arent too many saltwater stains on it.I knelt by the small traveling chest, unfolding the green velvet.Kneeling next to me, Jamie flipped back the lid of my medicine box, studying the layers of bottles and boxes and bits of gauze wrapped herbs.Have ye got anything in here for a verra vicious headache, Sassenach?I peered over his shoulder, then reached in and touched one bottle.Horehound might help, though its not the best.And willow bark tea with sow fennel works fairly well, but it takes some time to brew.Tell you whatwhy dont I make you up a recipe for hobnailed liver?Wonderful hangover cure.He bent a suspicious blue eye on me.That sounds nasty.It is, I said cheerfully.But youll feel lots better after you throw up.Mphm.He stood up and nudged the chamber pot toward me with one toe.Vomiting in the morning is your job, Sassenach, he said.Get it over with and get dressed.Ill stand the headache.***   Jared Munro Fraser was a small, spare, black eyed man, who bore more than a passing resemblance to his distant cousin Murtagh, the Fraser clansman who had accompanied us to Le Havre.When I first saw Jared, standing majestically in the gaping doors of his warehouse, so that streams of longshoremen carrying casks were forced to go around him, the resemblance was strong enough that I blinked and rubbed my eyes.Murtagh, so far as I knew, was still at the inn, attending a lame horse.Jared had the same lank, dark hair and piercing eyes; the same sinewy, monkey like frame.But there all resemblance stopped, and as we drew closer, Jamie gallantly clearing a path for me through the mob with elbows and shoulders, I could see the differences as well.Jareds face was oblong, rather than hatchet shaped, with a cheerful snub nose that effectively ruined the dignified air conferred at a distance by his excellent tailoring and upright carriage.A successful merchant rather than a cattleraider, he also knew how to smileunlike Murtagh, whose natural expression was one of unrelieved dournessand a broad grin of welcome broke out on his face as we were jostled and shoved up the ramp into his presence.My dear!he exclaimed, clutching me by the arm and yanking me deftly out of the way of two burly stevedores rolling a gigantic cask through the huge door.So pleased to see you at last!The cask bumped noisily on the boards of the ramp, and I could hear the rolling slosh of its contents as it passed me.You can treat rum like that, Jared observed, watching the ungainly progress of the enormous barrel through the obstructions of the warehouse, but not port.I always fetch that up myself, along with the bottled wines.In fact, I was just setting off to see to a new shipment of Belle Rouge port.Would you perhaps be interested in accompanying me?I glanced at Jamie, who nodded, and we set off at once in Jareds wake, sidestepping the rumbling traffic of casks and hogsheads, carts and barrows, and men and boys of all descriptions carrying bolts of fabric, boxes of grain and foodstuffs, rolls of hammered copper, sacks of flour, and anything else that could be transported by ship.Le Havre was an important center of shipping traffic, and the docks were the heart of the city.A long, solid wharf ran nearly a quarter mile round the edge of the harbor, with smaller docks protruding from it, along which were anchored three masted barks and brigantines, dories and small galleys; a full range of the ships that provisioned France.Jamie kept a firm hold on my elbow, the better to yank me out of the way of oncoming handcarts, rolling casks, and careless merchants and seamen, who were inclined not to look where they were going but rather to depend on sheer momentum to see them through the scrum of the docks.As we made our way down the quay, Jared shouted genteelly into my ear on the other side, pointing out objects of interest as we passed, and explaining the history and ownership of the various ships in a staccato, disjointed manner.The Arianna, which we were on our way to see, was in fact one of Jareds own ships.Ships, I gathered, might belong to a single owner, more often to a company of merchants who owned them collectively, or, occasionally, to a captain who contracted his vessel, crew, and services for a voyage.Seeing the number of company owned vessels, compared to the relatively few owned by individuals, I began to form a very respectful idea of Jareds worth.The Arianna was in the middle of the anchored row, near a large warehouse with the name fraser painted on it in sloping, whitewashed letters.Seeing the name gave me an odd little thrill, a sudden feeling of alliance and belonging, with the realization that I shared that name, and with it, an acknowledged kinship with those who bore it.The Arianna was a three masted ship, perhaps sixty feet long, with a wide bow.There were two cannon on the side of the ship that faced the dock; in case of robbery on the high seas, I supposed.Men were swarming all over the deck with what I assumed was some purpose, though it looked like nothing so much as an ants nest under attack.All sails were reefed and tied, but the rising tide shifted the vessel slightly, swinging the bowsprit toward us.It was decorated with a rather grim visaged figurehead; with her formidable bare bosom and tangled curls all spangled with salt, the lady looked as though she didnt enjoy sea air all that much.Sweet little beauty, is she not?Jared asked, waving a hand expansively.I assumed he meant the ship, not the figurehead.Verra nice, said Jamie politely.I caught his uneasy glance at the boats waterline, where the small waves lapped dark gray against the hull.I could see that he was hoping we would not be obliged to go on board.A gallant warrior, brilliant, bold, and courageous in battle, Jamie Fraser was also a landlubber.Definitely not one of the hardy, seafaring Scots who hunted whales from Tarwathie or voyaged the world in search of wealth, he suffered from a seasickness so acute that our journey across the Channel in December had nearly killed him, weakened as he then was by the effects of torture and imprisonment.And while yesterdays drinking orgy with Jared wasnt in the same league, it wasnt likely to have made him any more seaworthy.I could see dark memories crossing his face as he listened to his cousin extolling the sturdiness and speed of the Arianna, and drew near enough to whisper to him.Surely not while its at anchor?I dont know, Sassenach, he replied, with a look at the ship in which loathing and resignation were nicely mingled.But I suppose well find out.Jared was already halfway up the gangplank, greeting the captain with loud cries of welcome.If I turn green, can ye pretend to faint or something?It will make a poor impression if I vomit on Jareds shoes.I patted his arm reassuringly.Dont worry.I have faith in you.It isna me, he said, with a last, lingering glance at terra firma, its my stomach.The ship stayed comfortingly level under our shoes, however, and both Jamie and his stomach acquitted themselves noblyassisted, perhaps, by the brandy poured out for us by the captain.A nice make, Jamie said, passing the glass briefly under his nose and closing his eyes in approval of the rich, aromatic fumes.Portuguese, isnt it?Jared laughed delightedly and nudged the captain.You see, Portis?I told you he had a natural palate!Hes only tasted it once before!I bit the inside of my cheek and avoided Jamies eye.The captain, a large, scruffy looking specimen, looked bored, but grimaced politely in Jamies direction, exhibiting three gold teeth.A man who liked to keep his wealth portable.Ung, he said.This the lads going to keep your bilges dry, is it?Jared looked suddenly embarrassed, a slight flush rising under the leathery skin of his face.I noticed with fascination that one ear was pierced for an earring, and wondered just what sort of background had led to his present success.Aye, well, he said, betraying for the first time a hint of Scots accent, thats to be seen yet.But I think He glanced through the port at the activity taking place on the dock, then back at the captains glass, drained in three gulps while the rest of us were sipping.Um, I say, Portis, would you allow me to use your cabin for a moment?I should like to confer with my nephew and his wifeand I see that the aft hold seems to be having a bit of trouble with the cargo nets, from the sound of it.This craftily added observation was enough to send Captain Portis out of the cabin like a charging boar, hoarse voice uplifted in a Spanish French patois that I luckily didnt understand.Jared stepped delicately to the door and closed it firmly after the captains bulky form, cutting down the noise level substantially.He returned to the tiny captains table and ceremoniously refilled all our glasses before speaking.Then he looked from Jamie to me and smiled once more, in charming deprecation.Its a bit more precipitous than Id meant to make such a request, he said.But I see the good captain has rather given away my hand.The truth of the matter ishe raised his glass so the watery reflections from the port shivered through the brandy, striking patches of wavering light from the brass fittings of the cabinI need a man.He tipped the cup in Jamies direction, then brought it to his lips and drank.A good man, he amplified, lowering the glass.You see, my dear, bowing to me, I have the opportunity of making an exceptional investment in a new winery in the Moselle region.But the evaluation of it is not one I should feel comfortable in entrusting to a subordinate; I should need to see the facilities myself, and advise in their development.The undertaking would require several months.He gazed thoughtfully into his glass, gently swirling the fragrant brown liquid so its perfume filled the tiny cabin.I had drunk no more than a few sips from my own glass, but began to feel slightly giddy, more from a rising excitement than from drink.Its too good a chance to be missed, Jared said.And theres the chance of making several good contracts with the wineries along the Rhne; the products there are excellent, but relatively rare in Paris.God, theyd sell among the nobility like snow in summer!His shrewd black eyes gleamed momentarily with visions of avarice, then sparkled with humor as he looked at me.But he said.But, I finished for him, you cant leave your business here without a guiding hand.Intelligence as well as beauty and charm.I congratulate you, Cousin.He tilted a well groomed head toward Jamie, one eyebrow cocked in humorous approval.I confess that I was at something of a loss to see how I was to proceed, he said, setting the glass down on the small table with the air of a man putting aside social frivolity for the sake of serious business.But when you wrote from Ste.Anne, saying you intended to visit Paris  He hesitated a moment, then smiled at Jamie, with an odd little flutter of the hands.Knowing that you, my ladhe nodded to Jamiehave a head for figures, I was strongly inclined to consider your arrival an answer to prayer.Still, I thought that perhaps we should meet and become reacquainted before I took the step of making you a definite proposal.You mean you thought youd better see how presentable I was, I thought cynically, but smiled at him nonetheless.I caught Jamies eye, and one of his brows twitched upward.This was our week for proposals, evidently.For a dispossessed outlaw and a suspected English spy, our services seemed to be rather in demand.Jareds proposal was more than generous; in return for Jamies running the French end of the business during the next six months, Jared would not only pay him a salary but would leave his Paris town house, complete with staff, at our disposal.Not at all, not at all, he said, when Jamie tried to protest this provision.He pressed a finger on the end of his nose, grinning charmingly at me.A pretty woman to host dinner parties is a great asset in the wine business, Cousin.You have no idea how much wine you can sell, if you let the customers taste it first.He shook his head decidedly.No, it will be a great service to me, if your wife would allow herself to be troubled by entertaining.The thought of hosting supper parties for Parisian society was in fact a trifle daunting.Jamie looked at me, eyebrows raised in question, but I swallowed hard and smiled, nodding.It was a good offer; if he felt competent to take over the running of an importing business, the least I could do was order dinner and brush up my sprightly conversational French.Not at all, I murmured, but Jared had taken my agreement for granted, and was going on, intent black eyes fixed on Jamie.And then, I thought perhaps youd be needing an establishment of sortsfor the benefit of the other interests which bring you to Paris.Jamie smiled noncommittally, at which Jared uttered a short laugh and picked up his brandy glass.We had each been provided a glass of water as well, for cleansing the palate between sips, and he pulled one of these close with the other hand.Well, a toast!he exclaimed.To our association, Cousinand to His Majesty!He lifted the brandy glass in salute, then passed it ostentatiously over the glass of water and brought it to his lips.I watched this odd behavior in surprise, but it apparently meant something to Jamie, for he smiled at Jared, picked up his own glass and passed it over the water.To His Majesty, he repeated.Then, seeing me staring at him in bewilderment, he smiled and explained, To His Majestyover the water, Sassenach.Oh?I said, then, realization dawning, oh!The king over the waterKing James.Which did a bit to explain this sudden urge on the part of everyone to see Jamie and myself established in Paris, which would otherwise have seemed an improbable coincidence.If Jared were also a Jacobite, then his correspondence with Abbot Alexander was very likely more than coincidental; chances were that Jamies letter announcing our arrival had come together with one from Alexander, explaining the commission from King James.And if our presence in Paris fitted in with Jareds own plansthen so much the better.With a sudden appreciation for the complexities of the Jacobite network, I raised my own glass, and drank to His Majesty across the waterand our new partnership with Jared.Jared and Jamie then settled down to a discussion of the business, and were soon head to head, bent over inky sheets of paper, evidently manifests and bills of lading.The tiny cabin reeked of tobacco, brandy fumes, and unwashed sailor, and I began to feel a trifle queasy again.Seeing that I wouldnt be needed for a while, I stood up quietly and found my way out on deck.I was careful to avoid the altercation still going on around the rear cargo hatch, and picked my way through coils of rope, objects which I assumed to be belaying pins, and tumbled piles of sail fabric, to a quiet spot in the bow.From here, I had an unobstructed view over the harbor.I sat on a chest against the taffrail, enjoying the salty breeze and the tarry, fishy smells of ships and harbor.It was still cold, but with my cloak pulled tight around me, I was warm enough.The ship rocked slowly, rising on the incoming tide; I could see the beards of algae on nearby dock pilings lifting and swirling, obscuring the shiny black patches of mussels between them.The thought of mussels reminded me of the steamed mussels with butter I had had for dinner the night before, and I was suddenly starving.The absurd contrasts of pregnancy seemed to keep me always conscious of my digestion; if I wasnt vomiting, I was ravenously hungry.The thought of food led me to the thought of menus, which led back to a contemplation of the entertaining Jared had mentioned.Dinner parties, hm?It seemed an odd way to begin the job of saving Scotland, but then, I couldnt really think of anything better.At least if I had Charles Stuart across a dinner table from me, I could keep an eye on him, I thought, smiling to myself at the joke.If he showed signs of hopping a ship for Scotland, maybe I could slip something into his soup.Perhaps that wasnt so funny, after all.The thought reminded me of Geillis Duncan, and my smile faded.Wife of the procurator fiscal in Cranesmuir, she had murdered her husband by dropping powdered cyanide into his food at a banquet.Accused as a witch soon afterward, she had been arrested while I was with her, and I had been taken to trial myself; a trial from which Jamie had rescued me.The memories of several days spent in the cold dark of the thieves hole at Cranesmuir were all too fresh, and the wind seemed suddenly very cold.I shivered, but not altogether from chill.I could not think of Geillis Duncan without that cold finger down my spine.Not so much because of what she had done, but because of who she had been.A Jacobite, too; one whose support of the Stuart cause had been more than slightly tinged with madness.Worse than that, she was what I wasa traveler through the standing stones.I didnt know whether she had come to the past as I had, by accident, or whether her journey had been deliberate.Neither did I know precisely where she had come from.But my last vision of her, screaming defiance at the judges who would condemn her to burn, was of a tall, fair woman, arms stretched high, showing on one arm the telltale round of a vaccination scar.I felt automatically for the small patch of roughened skin on my own upper arm, beneath the comforting folds of my cloak, and shuddered when I found it.
