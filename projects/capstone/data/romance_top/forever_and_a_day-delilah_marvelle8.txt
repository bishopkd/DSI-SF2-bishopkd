She wouldnt look at him and 						only half nodded as if in a daze, just now realizing the futility of what 						shed done.Tis obvious what must be done.I do not wish you disowned or 						shamed, nor do I wish the same for my mother.I must thereforemarry your 						brother.Marry him?he seethed out, shaking her in savage restraint.But you are mine now, Margaret.Mine, damn you.Not his.She still wouldnt look at him.Her hand trembled as she swiped away loose strands of blond hair from her 						cheek.What choice have I in this?My mother wills it and your brother and 						all of London and the church expect it.And so the inner rot within him 						truly began.Oh, how he hated her.How he 						hated her for not only sacrificing herself in the name of everyone and 						everything around her, making her own heart and dignity bleed, but he hated 						her for seizing the last of his own heart and his virginity, which he had 						sought to gift to his own wife on his wedding night.Now it would appear he 						had nothing to gift.It had all been taken away.What a fool hed been to think 						he could actually love a woman within his circle without turning it into 						superficial duty and lies.Every last woman of the aristocracy was bred to 						obey the rules of their elders and their circle by putting duty before their 						hearts, even when that duty was rotten to its core and undeserving of being 						honored.UNWILLING TO FACE HIS BROTHER after 						what he had done, let alone attend the wedding that should have been his, 						Roderick wordlessly left London a week before Yardley made it to the altar.He went to Paris with a university friend instead.Napoleon Bonaparte had wronged 						his beautiful France by making the world think the worst of it, because 						Paris, sweet Paris, was the breath of glorious air hed been gasping for.He 						extended his stay beyond the mere month he had originally arranged and 						decided to stay for another five.Everything about Paris was not 						only riveting but ravishing.Aside from the people, the food, the music, the 						gardens and the streets, delightful discoveries of incredible books like 						La citoyenne Roland, sitting crookedly upon dusty old shelves of quiet 						bookshops, made him all the more thankful to be part of everything known as 						France.He was pleased to discover that 						the women in Paris, unlike those in London, could be paged through and 						opened like books without snapping any of their bindings.French women were 						by far more intelligent and valued the real worth of a man, be he a first 						son or a second or a third.He loved them all for it, and they, in turn, 						loved him because he always paid the bill.Although he generously showered 						countless women with gifts, no matter the expense or her status or lack 						thereof, he didnt do it for a fuck like the rest of the men around him.He 						did it because he enjoyed sharing his money with those that had none.In 						truth, when it came to fucking, he had become so morbidly selective after what 						Margaret had done to him that he refused to physically get involved with a 						woman at all.He eventually decided, however, 						that he needed to move on.So he created a list in the hopes of yanking 						himself out of the abyss by unearthing a woman worthy of him.One he could 						share a corner of his life with without the expectations of his circle or 						matrimony.After staring at a blank 						parchment for half the night, only one requirement came to mind: she had 						to be able to make him laugh before hed so much as loosen his cravat.Though his requirement seemed stupid and easily attainable, there wasnt a 						woman in Paris who could make him laugh.His soul had become far too warped 						and dark to find anything amusing and he hated Margaret and his brother all the 						more because of it.But thankfullythat 						changed.Whilst attending a social event 						for local artists looking for patrons, he met a certain Mademoiselle Sophie, 						a flamboyant actress with brick red hair and a saucy smile who wasnt at all 						pretty but was incredibly witty and had enough fire to burn down all of 						Paris.She had a remarkable gift, for she could not only make him laugh 						about the most foolish things, twisting her words and facial expressions at 						the most perfect of times, but she could actually make him laugh 						so hard, 						hed be close to crying.And God, did he ever need it.When he eventually decided to 						invite Sophie up for an evening alone in his flat after weeks and weeks of 						flirtations spent over champagne, conversation and theater, it was the best 						decision hed made.He learned to love sex in a way he never thought 						possible.One rainy morning, whilst Sophie 						lounged naked on his bed, reading aloud the latest in French gossip, which 						she always lived for, Roderick sipped on his coffee and wandered over to the 						window of his flat on rue des 						Francs Bourgeois.As the grid of the 						streets below laid itself out like a birds view of a map, he came to 						remember his mothers map for the first time in years.The one hed buried 						long ago against the eaves in the garret of his fathers home.Roderick was appalled, realizing 						hed been obsessing over all the wrong things in his life.He knew he had to 						retrieve that map and do right by it, but he also knew it meant going back 						to London and facing his brother, whose wedding hed never attended and 						whose wife hed bedded.Days passed and thoughts of his 						mother ate away at his ability to breathe and think.After avoiding the 						reality of the mess he knew he had to return to, Roderick sucked in his 						pride and returned to London.He toted back not only Sophie, whose 						friendship hed grown dependant on, but several trunks filled to the lid 						with books hed acquired from Paris.After he settled Sophie and his trunks, 						he decided to visit his father and announce to the man that he was back from 						Paris.As his coach arrived through the 						vast iron gates leading to the Wentworth home, Tremayne was astounded to 						glimpse through the narrow glass window a funeral wreath hanging upon his 						fathers door.The door had even been painted black as had been done on the 						death of his mother those many, many years ago.Twas dead of the night, when I 						sat in my dwelling; One glimmering lamp was expiring 						and low; Around, the dark tide of the 						tempest was swelling.Along the wild mountains 						night ravens were yelling...By a Gentleman of the University 						of Oxford, St.Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian, A 						Romance (1811) A PULSING KNOT OVERTOOK Rodericks breath.Flinging open the carriage door 						before it could even roll to a halt, he jumped down, skidding against the 						gravel beneath his boots, and dashed up the paved stairs leading to the main 						entrance of his fathers home.He pounded and pounded on the door with a 						gloved fist, his chest and throat tight as he tried to ignore the funeral 						wreath.When the butler unlatched and 						edged open the door, he shoved past the man and stumbled inside.Father?he shouted, his voice eerily echoing around him as he sprinted toward the 						direction of the study where he knew the man would be if he were still 						alive.Father!The duke staggered out from the 						study like an apparition floating out from the shadows into candlelight, 						making Roderick skid to a halt.The mans gray hair was unusually shaggy, 						heavily mussed and oily as if he hadnt tended to himself in weeks.His 						evening attire was as disheveled as the rest of him, lacking not only 						cleanliness but a coat and cravat.A near empty decanter of brandy was in 						his hand.Father?Roderick whispered in 						disbelief.Tired and darkly solemn eyes 						that were under the influence of brandy met his across the length of the 						corridor.Typhus took Yardley.It took him.No doctor couldsave him.I 						sent word to you in Paris, but obviously neither he norI meant anything to 						you or you would have come sooner.Dont bother me tonight.We willtalk on 						the morrow.He lowered his gaze and staggered back into the 					study.The corridor swayed and he along 						with it.Roderick fell against a wall and 						slid down its length, unable to withstand the weight of his own limbs.Hed 						never received anything.Not a letter.Not a word.Not even a whisper of a 						word.Oh, God.He stayed on the marble floor, a 						gloved fist pressed against his temple, too overwhelmed to do much of 						anything.When the servants had commenced lighting more lamps and candles to 						keep him from sitting in darkness, Roderick willed himself to stand on 						booted feet.A part of him still refused to believe that Yardley was 						gone.Removing a lit candle from the 						nearest sconce, he drifted up the stairs hed climbed so many times in his 						youth and turned down the corridor, pausing before Yardleys old bedchamber.The door was ajar and the room softly lit by a lone lamp.Roderick quietly wandered 						inside, the lingering smell of leather and shoe polish reminding him of 						Yardley.Upon glimpsing the four poster bed, Roderick paused, the candle 						almost slipping from his trembling gloved fingers.A faded red ceremonial 						sash and a blunted sword had both been set upon the bed linens as if Yardley 						would trot into the room at any moment in the form of a child, snatch them 						up and don them, challenging Roderick to yet another game of Napoleon 						against British soldier.Tears stung his eyes.He should 						have been a better brother.He should have been a better man.Instead, he 						had proven to be an even bigger prick than Yardley could have ever been.Roderick swung away and blew out the candle with a puff, flinging it to the 						floor where it rolled out of sight.Stripping his gloves from his hands, he 						tossed them.Roderick wandered about the 						corridors aimlessly until he paused before the small wood door inlaid behind 						the top stairwell leading into the garret above.He stared at the latch.It 						had been many years since hed last opened that door.How was it hed so 						heartlessly lost sight of everything that had once meant the world to 						him?Creaking open the door, he 						slowly made his way up into the narrowing garret, a headache pinching his 						skull.Though he tried to steady his breathing, the horrid ache he felt 						within his chest wouldnt go away.Kneeling before the trunk hed 						tucked against the eaves so many years ago, he unbuckled the leather straps 						and pushed it wide open.Shadows covered its empty bottom.He staggered in 						disbelief and clung to the edges of the trunk in an effort to balance 						himself.Every book his mother had given him, including his cherished 1775 						edition of Defoes The Life and Most Surprising 						Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, which 						held his mothers map of New York City within its pages, was 					gone.It was as if his life had been 						erased.After staring at that empty 						bottom for much too long, he shut its lid and prayed his father had simply 						placed all of the books into the library.Hefting the leather trunk up into 						his arms, he made his way down and out of the garret, past Yardleys old 						bedchamber, and veered down that vast stairwell leading down to the main 						floor.Walking in through the open 						doors, his heavy steps dissonantly echoed against the expanse of the study.Depositing the trunk before his fathers desk with a thud, he lingered, 						unable to voice all of the agonizing emotion buried within him.His father glanced up, the rim 						of yet another half empty brandy decanter hovering before his lips.What is 						it?After a moment of awkward 						silence, Roderick choked out, Do you think so little of me as to believe 						that neither you nor Yardley meant anything to me?You are the only person 						left in this world that I can love and that I can trust.As for Yardleyhe 						may not have understood me or respected me in the manner that I deserved, 						and I may not have understood him or respected him in the manner that 						he 						deserved, but we were brothers.I never received word of his passing whilst 						I was in Paris.If I had, I would have come.I simply didnt 					know.His fathers large hand 						trembled.He swallowed a gulp of brandy and set aside the decanter with a 						clink.Lowering his gaze to his hand, which limply rested on the desk beside the 						brandy, the duke finally murmured, The damn post is never reliable.Dont 						blame yourself.The duke scrubbed his hair and 						fell back against his leather chair, eyeing him.Both Lady Morrow and the 						Marchioness of Yardley have been inquiring as to your whereabouts.I suggest 						you call on them.Offer whatever comfort they require in the name of your 						brother.Rodericks throat tightened.He 						knew full well why they were inquiring.Hed heard the rumors well across 						into Paris that Margarets marriage to Yardley had yielded nothing but 						misery over its five short months, and with his brother now gone, only one 						man remained heir to the entire Wentworth estate.Him.I refuse to see 						either of them.His fathers gray brows rose up 						to his hairline.You dont intend to offer your condolences to your own 						brothers wife?No.I dont.Color bloomed in his fathers 						features.He leaned forward in his chair.If you dont call on them at 						least once, London will be left to wonder why and Ill not have whispers 						floating about my name.His fist slammed against the desk, causing the 						brandy within the glass to slosh.Tis indecent enough you werent here 						when Yardley was lowered into the ground.I expect you to be devoted not 						only to the memory of your brother but to the duty you were born to.And now 						that you have inherited your brothers title, you will heed the 						responsibility that accompanies it.You are no longer merely Tremayne.You 						are now a Yardley.Roderick shifted from boot to 						boot, already feeling himself being fitted into the role his brother had 						left behind.I wasnt born into the role of heir and therefore you cannot 						expect me to play the part of one.I will devote myself to the memory of my 						brother by wearing a mourning band for the rest of my days, but I have 						absolutely no desire to see the marchioness or her mother and console them over a 						death I have no doubt they care little about.They used me to get to Yardley 						and they will use Yardleys death to get to me.His father glanced toward the 						entrance of the study and lowered his voice, meeting his gaze.Yardley 						seethed on and on about you and the marchioness prior to his death.He 						claimed you bedded her prior to him taking her to the altar.Is that true?Or was he just being a cad as always?Roderick set trembling hands 						behind his back, the sting of those words biting into the last of what he 						was.Tis true.I had hoped to convince her to run off with me to Paris.Obviously, I did not succeed.Dearest God.The duke threw his head back with an exasperated 						groan.I would have expected this from yourbrother, God rest his soul.He 						was a mans man and rough around every edge no matter how many times I took 						a crop to him.But I would have never expected this from you.What became of 						that boy I loved so much?Roderick swallowed against the 						tears that overwhelmed him.It was the first time his father had openly 						admitted to not only having had pride in him but to having loved him.Though 						little good that did him now.He had destroyed that love and that pride, 						and, in turn, had destroyed himself.The duke leaned far forward and 						into the desk and hissed out a breath.He eyed the empty trunk Roderick had 						toted into the study and gestured sloppily toward it.What is 					that?Rodericks voice faded, 						remembering why hed come to him to begin with.I found it empty up in the 						garret and wish to inquire as to what has been done with its contents.They 						held some of my old books.Books?The duke blinked 						rapidly.Ah.Yes.Books.He nodded and shifted in his seat.A book 						collector whod been visiting with your cousin kept pestering me.So I had 						the servants wade through everything in the house and let himtake 						everything away.Roderick stared at him in 						agonizing disbelief.The man had no idea what those books meant to him.Those books were given to me by Mother.His fathers gruff tone softened 						and he seemed to momentarily appear sober.What?She gifted them to me shortly 						before she died.I placed them all in a trunk in the garret to prevent 						anyone from touching them.His father closed his eyes, 						rubbing the palm of his hand against his temple.What the hell were they 						doing up in the garret?Why didnt youtell me?I always hid things in the 						garret with Yardley being prone to burning my books.Something you may or 						may not remember.Either way, I want those books back.Tis all I have of 						her.Reopening his eyes, the duke 						dropped his hand onto his lap.The man already left England.Whatever do you mean he left 						England?Roderick echoed.You handed them off to a foreigner?An American.From New 						York.He choked.An American from New York?Dear God.What if he finds the map?What if he 						thinks its of worth and never gives it back?His father squinted up at him.Whatever the devilwhat map?The map!Roderick roared, unable to contain his own agony.The one Mother gave me.The one of New York City!The one you threatened to 						burn every time I pulled it out.I placed it in one of those books for 						safekeeping and you gave it away!His fathers lips parted.I 						didnt know.Roderick squeezed his eyes shut 						and forced himself to lull his tone and his stance.Why did she give it to 						me?What was it?What did it mean?And why was it so oddly separated into 						pieces?The duke lowered his gaze.Twas nothing, he mumbled.Twas nothing but a 					damnfabrication.Reopening his eyes, Roderick 						intently held his fathers gaze.For something that you wished to burn 						every time you saw it, tis clearly more than a mere fabrication.What was 						it?His throat burned in a desperate effort to keep his words and himself 						calm.The duke half nodded and 						eventually murmured, It pertained to her brother.Rodericks brows rose.I never 						knew she had siblings.One.Twas a sad story, that.His father shifted in his seat, adjusting his coat.His name was Atwood.He 						and your mother were incredibly close.He was heir to theSumner estate and 						all but ten years old when he disappeared.Roderick held his fathers gaze.What happened to him?The duke rubbed at his temple.Your grandfather had whisked them all out of London and into New York back 						inoh, I dont know, 1800 or so, as he was negotiating investments.Shortly 						before they were set to return to Londonhe disappeared.That was the last 						they had ever seen of him.Roderick set a hand against his 						mouth in disbelief and asked through his hand, Did they not find 						anything?No.Not even a body.When they 						eventually returned to London without him, Atwoods portraits and all of his 						belongings were stripped from the home.Your mother managed to confiscate a 						miniature of him from a servant and carried it with her at all times.The 						whole thinghaunted me.It still does.His father shifted his jaw and 						leaned back against his chair.Many, many years later, she appeared to me 						clinging Atwoods portrait whilst I was at breakfast.Sheshe told me she 						had a dream about a parchment that had been torn into ten different pieces 						and thatwhen she had pieced them all together, it revealed a map of New 						York City bearing a circled area that showed his location.She claimed that 						in her dream, she knew without any doubt he was still, in fact, alive.As 						such, she demanded we purchase every map of New York City we could find that 						would best match it.The duke shook his head.It 						wasillogical.She spent weeks replicating it.Right down 						totearing it into pieces.I kept telling her she was falling into the realm 						of superstitious hysteria.But it only got worse.She wouldnt sleep, she 						wouldnteat.And all she kept telling me was that she wouldnt know peace 						until the matter was resolved.She was pregnant at the time with our third 						and I was worried.So I told her if she promised to eat and to sleep, that 						once shed given birth, we would all go to New York and lay it to rest.His 						fathers voice faded.He pressed his fingers against his stubbled chin and 						lowered his gaze.Only she never survived the birth, damn her.She never 						survived.Sheleft me.She left us.Silence pulsed between 						them.All of his poor mothers pent up 						hopes of finding her brother, whom she had yearned to love to the very end, 						had sat up in that damn garret untouched, unsolved and unloved.It was 						monstrous.You knew what it meant to her, he rasped, and yet you never 						sought to look into the matter yourself?Even after she died?The duke glanced away, 						struggling to sit up in his chair.Twas nonsense I didnt care to break my 						heart over.I had two boys left to raise on my own.Twas nonsense?he echoed, 						stepping toward the desk.How could anything that meant so much to her be 						considered nonsense?Roderick leaned toward him, 						slamming both hands on the smooth mahogany between them.We are getting 						that damn map back, even if we have to buy out this bastards entire shop 						and all of New York.When did you dispose of those books?His father eyed him.A few 						weeks ago.Which means they can still be 						recovered.If the man hasnt already sold 						them all.Well ensure he buys them all 						back.Well make it worth his while.Roderick swiped a hand across his 						face.Do you have a name?An address?Anything?The duke blew out a pained 						breath.He glanced up, his features tightening in an effort to remember.Hatchet.He was thisthisstocky, boisterous fellow who owned a shop 						somewhere inNew York.Though I dont remember much else.Your cousin Edwin 						would know more.Roderick pushed himself away 						from the desk and straightened.With his brother now gone, their family was 						tragically dwindling into nothingness.It was heart wrenching.What if the 						map his mother had created did, in fact, lead to something?What if it led 						to Atwood?A part of their family would be restored and honored.Ill call 						on Edwin in the morning.The moment I have an address, I intend to leave on 						the next ship out and retrieve that map in person.I also intend to 						investigate whether or not the map is true.There must be clues 						investigators missed.For all we know that map might reopen the 						investigation into Atwoods disappearance.His father jumped to his feet, 						sending the chair backward with a clatter.He swayed in an effort to stare 						him down.Are you mad?Do you actually intend to run off to the other side 						of the world looking for clues based off of adream?Despite the flaring of his own 						nostrils, Roderick still managed to remain calm.What if youre wrong?What 						if that map leads us to something?Anything?Even a whisper of anything is 						more than nothing.We wont know unless we put this to 					rest.No.I am not about 					to  If you go against me in this, 						Father, I will never forgive you for not loving your wife enough to oversee 						her last wish.The duke glanced away, his 						ragged features twisting.Sniffing hard, he glanced down at the empty 						decanter.A tear traced its way down his weathered cheek.Setting his shoulders, his 						father cleared his throat.You and Yardley were the only reason I survived 						her death.The duke leaned heavily into the desk and pointed at him through 						tears and choked out, You are all that remains of her.You are the 						only 						assurance I have that she was even real.You cant be putting yourself in 						harms way.Because if anything happens to youI wont survive it.I will 						slit my bloody throat and die.Do you understand me?Reaching out over the desk, 						Roderick forcefully grabbed ahold of his fathers large hand and squeezed it 						hard, crushing it against his palm.I understand you more than you think 						and I am touched to know I mean so much to you.You mean just as much to 						me.Intently holding his fathers gaze, he offered in a choked tone, But 						she entrusted that map to me, Father.I intend to uphold her honor as is my 						right as her son, and I wish to restore what little remains of our family.Roderick leaned in closer and whispered, I ask that we do this together.She would have wanted us to.Dont you think?His father released his hand and 						turned away, stumbling away from the desk.He swiped a shaky hand across the 						back of his neck and lingered as if battling between a drunken mind and 						drunken heart.Do not disappoint me, and above all, do 						not disappoint her, Roderick inwardly 						chanted.Love her.Love her this one last 						time.The duke eventually swung back, 						his features tightening.To hell with London and thetime and theexpense.We go.We go and put your mothers soul to rest.It would seem Roderick had been 						blinded into never seeing the greatness of the man standing before him.Drunk though he was.Do you still have that miniature?We will need a 						detailed description of what he looked like when he disappeared.We will 						need his likeness.At least his coloring, provided he will have 						aged.The duke lowered his gaze and 						shook his head.I tucked it into your mothers hand before she was buried.But IIve seen it enough times.Black hair.Black brows.And blue eyes.Very striking eyes that were so unusually bright in color, they almost 						looked likeblue glass.We need more than that, 						Roderick insisted.We will have to go to Grandpapa and Grandmama with this.They would be able to provide us a better description as well as any other 						details pertaining to his disappearance.The duke paused and leveled him 						with a warning gaze, slowly shaking his head from side to side.No.No.No.I dont 						want your grandfather involved in this.He must never know.Never.Roderick blinked and leaned 						toward him.I would think he has the right to know.It involves his own 						son.He could help us.The duke continued to stare him 						down.No.He lowered his voice.That man was responsible for Atwoods 						disappearance.Roderick stared at him, his 						breath hitching.What?How so?His father glanced away and 						shrugged.It wasnt anything your mother or I could ever prove, even though 						we repeatedly tried to involve the crowns investigators throughout the 						years.They onlybrushed it off and were convinced it had been American 						patriots who had committed the crime.Only it didnt make sense.In my 						opiniongiven what we are about to dowe tell no one.This way, nothing will 						impede the reopening of our investigation.Sagging both palms against his 						fathers desk, Roderick hissed out a breath.God help us if any of this is 						true.I know, his father muttered.Believe me, I know.It would seem a map based off of 						a dream and a rather sorry description of a ten year old boy who would no 						longer be tenif he were alivewas all they had.It already appeared improbable 						that they were going to find anything.But then againthe boy had been old 						enough to have known who he had once been.Perhaps that boy was now a man 						who still remembered what had happened.Regardless, he and his father had 						money and time on their side.Not even a day later, Roderick 						was fitted for a set of mourning bands.He donned one on his arm that day in 						honor of his brother, swearing it would never leave his arm again, except 						when he retired at night.With a heavy heart, for he knew it was best, he 						dismissed his Sophie, who he had dragged all the way over from Paris, and 						tucked a hundred pounds into her hand, thanking her for being a friend.She 						assured him he could always find her in Paris should he grow bored.No 						sooner had he kissed her hand goodbye than he called upon his cousin and had 						Mr.Hatchets shop address in hand.He and his father arranged to have 						everything packed and ready to leave on the next ship out of 						Liverpool.The morning before he was to 						board the ship that would take them to New York, Roderick visited his 						brothers crypt and ardently prayed before it for hours.Tears blinded not 						only his eyes but his soul.Nothing would change what had come to 						pass.When he eventually returned home 						that afternoon, after having spent five torturous hours lingering before his 						brothers crypt, he decided to get drunk along with his father, both of them 						swearing to each other they would never get drunk again as it solved 						nothing.But they had a good time doing it.By evening, when Roderick could 						barely stand, and his father had fallen asleep on a sofa, he called for his 						carriage and demanded it take him over to Margarets town house.Despite it being long past 						respectable calling hours, he was admitted the moment hed given his name 						and was even asked to wait in the study, as opposed to the drawing room.Whilst waiting for Margaret to appear, he staggered toward his brothers 						desk.Gripping the outside edge, he leaned against it and willed himself to 						stay focused on why he was there.Tremayne?He stiffened and swiveled toward 						the direction of Margarets choked tone.A slim figure draped in a bombazine 						gown stood in the shadows, the hallway beyond much too dark to reveal a 						face.She drifted into the room with determined grace and poise, the golden 						glow of the candlelight revealing the soft, delicate face of a woman he 						remembered all too achingly well.Her thick golden hair had been 						swept up into a mature top knot as opposed to those debutante curls she used 						to wear.She turned and slid both paneled doors shut.She turned back toward him, 						silently crossing the room, and paused to linger before him.The delicate 						scent of lilacs bloomed around him, heightening his awareness of her.She 						reached out a bare hand and touched his arm.You came.He pushed away her hand.Not 						for the reasons you think.She flushed, her features 						growing tight.Taking back the distance hed put between them, she leaned 						toward him and awkwardly forced her warm fingers into his hand.Roderick stiffened as the heat 						of her soft hand warmed his own.Jerking his hand out of hers, he asked 						tonelessly, Did you at least come to love him?Give me peace and assure me 						you did.I wish I could give you peace 						in that.She leaned toward him and whispered with a vivid angst that 						penetrated her blue eyes, Yardley knew about us.I told him days into our 						marriage.I was so disgusted with myself, and with everything, I was hoping 						that his anger would cast me out so that I could join you in Paris.Unnervingly, it had the opposite effect.Yardley became so morbidly driven 						to replace you and refused to let me out of his sight, even for a moment.He 						commenced dictating when and how my heart should beat, much like my mother 						did, which only made me hate him all the more.But it was God Himself, in 						the end, who dictated when and how his heart should beat by making it 						stop altogether.She set herself against the 						desk, tears streaming down her face.I am done submitting myself to others 						at the cost of my sanity.Please tell me that something remains of your love 						for me so that I may crawl across whatever broken glass you lay before me in 						the hopes of reclaiming what had once been.Roderick glanced toward her, his 						pulse thundering against his skull.He couldnt breathe knowing that she had 						chosen everything over their love.Everything.The scent of lilacs and the 						brandy still warming his veins twisted his common sense as the sparse 						candlelight within the room blurred.He veered toward her and savagely 						yanked her up off the desk.You knowingly destroyed me and for that I will 						never be able to forgive you.You had your chance to prove yourself to me 						when it counted most and you failed.She let out a sob.Tremayne.My 						heart never ceased beating for you.Not once.Please.Show me that you 						still Her hands jumped to his face and tried to pull him down toward her 						lips as she had that night when she had first seduced his naive 					soul.Roderick grabbed her hands and 						violently shoved them away, stumbling back in disbelief.I ask that if 						there is any compassion or remorse left within you, that you cease this.Cease loving me, because I have long ceased loving you.Her anguished sob rippled 						through the air.Tremayne  Tis Lord Yardley now, my lady.Sadly.I have inherited my brothers name and, with it, it would seem, his 						heart.I am done with you and this.Do you understand me?I am done and ask 						that you never call upon me or whisper my name again.Swinging away, 						Roderick staggered out, feeling as if he had finally set a part of his condemned 						soul free.The following morning, whilst 						vomiting his excesses and wincing against every noise, he left London with 						his father to begin his journey to New York.While his father discussed 						matters of the estate and all that would now be his, Roderick couldnt help 						but loathe himself to no end knowing at what cost the spare had become the 						heir.To save a mans life against his 						will is the same as killing 					him.Horace, Ars Poetica (18 						BC) Adelphi Hotel The present 						hour of 12:45 p. m.  CLASPING THE BLACK MOURNING band against the upper biceps of his gray morning 						coat in reminder of all that had once been, Roderick lingered before his 						fathers door marked 21.Drawing in a ragged breath, he shifted toward the 						closed door and, after hesitating, knocked.Yes?the duke called out from 						within.Roderick willed strength into 						his voice.Tis I.   There was a pause.The door is 						unlocked.Pushing down on the latch, 						Roderick opened the door leading into his fathers suite and eased into the 						lavish room, quietly closing it behind him.The duke glanced up from the 						unfolded newspaper hed been reading in a chair set in the far corner of the 						room.Refolding his newspaper, he slapped it onto the mahogany side table 						next to him and rose, coming toward him.Letting out a low whistle, the 						duke chided gently, You clean up rather well.Roderick stripped his top hat 						from his still damp hair the valet had trimmed, and quickly strode over to 						the man, grabbing hold of his father with one hefting arm.Fiercely holding 						his father against his chest, as if he were not a man but a boy, he 						whispered, Forgive me for not having loved you in the way you 						deserved.The duke stiffened, wrapping 						awkward arms around him.He patted his back.What honor is 					this?Pulling away, Roderick 						confessed, I missed knowing who you were and what you meant to me and ask 						that you forgive me for treating you with disdain when I last saw you.Roderick placed his top hat back onto his head, angling it in preparation 						for the long walk he had yet to take, and grabbed those broad shoulders, 						squaring the duke toward himself so he might better look at his aged face 						and dark brown eyes.I remember what had once been.Astonished gray brows rose.Blinking several times, his father intently searched his face.You remember 						me?That I do.How?What happened?I dont 						understand.Roderick shrugged.It was like 						God Himself had touched a finger to my head.The duke stepped away and 						pointed at him, issuing the challenge of, Tell me something that only you 						would know about me.I want to know this is real.I want to know that your 						mind is what it should be.Roderick couldnt help but 						smirk.Faith was never enough for you, was it?All right.What do I know of 						you, O Father?I remember how you always roared across the house before 						cropping Yardley.It felt like all you ever did on the hour was roar and 						crop Yardley on my behalf.Which I did appreciate.A boisterous laugh rippled 						through the air.Now, why is it you would go and remember something like 						that about 						me?Though I will admit that boy had the devil in him.All of hell, 						actually.That he did, Roderick drawled.Good old Yardley.The duke fell quiet, lowering 						his gaze.Mischief laced though he was, he was still my boy.It wasnt 						right he died so young.Roderick swallowed, reached out 						and squeezed his fathers shoulder.No.It wasnt.And my biggest regret is 						that I didnt make an effort to guide him more.I only judged 					him.Nothing would have ever changed 						him.He was what he was.Drawing in a huge breath and letting it out, the 						duke shook his head and eyed him.Please tell me we are set to leave in ten 						days, as planned, because I am well and done with this piss of a city.Weve 						done everything we set out to do.My Augustine at long last knows peace.My 						only regret is that she never had the chance to see him before she His 						voice trailed off.Roderick let his hand drop away 						from his fathers shoulder, tensing from the reality that he might never 						remember what had happened since leaving England.Though I remember quite a 						bit, I cannot remember getting on that boat or what happened thereafter.What happened?However did we find Atwood?Was it the map?And why isnt he 						coming home with us?Doesnt he wish to reclaim all that is rightfully his, 						given he is the sole heir to the Sumner estate?The duke swiped his face and 						swung away.If he goes back to England, it would mean facing his parents 						and the past before all of London.You have no idea what that poor boy has 						been through, Yardley.It would be a damn rag gossiping frenzy of the worst 						sort that would drag itself through every last court and torment Londons 						base understanding of humanity.Rodericks eyes widened.You 						mean?The duke nodded grimly.According to Atwood, your grandfather had wronged an impassioned man he 						shouldnt have.A man who then sought to avenge himself by taking the one 						thing that mattered most to himhis son.Sucking in a breath, he edged 						back.Whatever the hell did he do to the man to make him do such a 						thing?The duke swung back toward him.Tis a story deserving of its own book.One we will discuss throughout our 						journey to London, and one that must never leave your lips until Atwood is 						ready to emerge on his own.His father paused and shook his head.And now 						you wish to make an even bigger mess of our lives by dragging yet 						another 						poor soul into it.Roderick slowly turned away so 						he didnt have to reveal his own agony.You neednt worry about Georgia.She will not be accompanying us to London.Closing his eyes, he swallowed 						and went on, I intend to end our relationship tonight.What?His father seemed not to 						understand.I love her far more than I 						could ever love myself.And so I shall let her go.Opening his eyes but 						still keeping his back to his father, Roderick cleared his throat to push a 						sense of staid calmness into his quaking voice.I intend to gift her a 						lifelong yearly annuity in parting and ask that it be arranged through your 						estate before we leave New York.I need Georgia to not only live incredibly 						well, but have servants, as her poor hands are so damn roughened by work 						they will require years of rest.She wasnt deserving of being dragged into 						my life.She deserves more than this.She deserves more than me.When only 						mere silence hummed, Roderick turned to his father.The dukes features were still 						morbidly stoic as if he were not involved in their conversation at 						all.Roderick stared.You will go to 						the bank before we leave New York and arrange an annuity of five thousand a 						year.Do you understand?His father glanced away and half 						nodded.I will call on the bank this afternoon if that is what you 						want.Roderick threw back his head, 						almost causing his top hat to fall away, and rapidly blinked back tears he 						swore he wouldnt cry.In a choked tone, he confided, It will allow me a 						measure of peace.The entire estate is set to go 						to your pocket, anyway, the duke muttered.What do I care how much of it 						goes where?Roderick swallowed, leveling his 						head again and adjusting his morning coat about his frame.He cleared his 						throat.I am set to go for a long walk about the city on my own, and will 						be gone for most of the day and most likely well into the evening, depending 						on where my mood takes me.I have to gather my thoughts about how the hell I 						am going to announce all of this to Georgia without breaking 					her.He winced and glanced away.She 						expects me at her door at nine tonight, so I have no choice but to be back 						by then.That saidI wanted you to know that despite all that has come to 						pass, I never sought to willfully dishonor you or her and will never shame our name 						again by involving myself with another woman, be that woman of our circle or 						not.I made that decision after Margaret and dont even know what the hell I 						was thinking when I still had full possession of my wits.Sadly, my circle 						has too many expectations and I cannot willfully mold Georgia into becoming 						something she is not and expect the woman I love to survive.She wont.She 						just wont.EARLY THAT EVENING, AND ALONE at last from the flurry of the 						female servants who had bathed her, oiled her, dried her, massaged her, 						clothed her and tugged and pushed and pulled her freshly washed hair in 						every direction to assemble it into ringlets and a coif, Georgia spent most 						of her afternoon wandering about her lavish room.She had purposefully 						locked herself away to avoid Robinson.She had even supped alone in the room 						with a tray laden with poached salmon and creamed carrots that almost made 						her faint in well pleasured anguish when they touched her lips.The entire world appeared to be 						hers, and yet with Robinson putting her at a distance, it was meaningless.Adjusting the belt on the embroidered rose colored robe shed been wrapped 						in after a divine bath scented with orange blossoms, she padded over to the 						sideboard that had been arranged with female toiletries the chambermaid had 						methodically set out for her.Though she tried to recall what 						was whatthe woman had rattled off all of the cosmetics so fastshe really 						couldnt remember.Leaning toward the silver tray laden with small glass 						bottles and tins, she poked at the open tin of rose rouge that for some 						reason the chambermaid had said was green rouge.The woman must have been 						color blind.Either way, good rouge went for 						a quarter a piece in stores and it was obvious this here was good rouge.Georgia had always wanted to buy a tin and see if it could make her 						prettier, but thought it vain and a waste of money.But nowit kneeled 						before her as if she were a queen and whimpered to be of service.Georgia smiled and excitedly 						plucked it up along with the small bristled brush set next to it.Perhaps 						she could make herself pretty enough to make Robinson think twice about 						saying no to her.Leaning toward the oval gilded 						mirror hanging above the sideboard, she held up the tin with the tips of her 						fingers and dabbed the brush into the powdered substance like shed seen 						women do in the shops.Dashing it across each side of her cheekbones, she 						tilted her head from side to side to observe how it sat.She leaned closer to the mirror 						and squinted.It didnt do a thing.Perhaps she hadnt put on enough.Dabbing a more generous amount onto the brush, she swiped it across both 						cheeks and paused.Reddish rouge skid marks streaked her pale 					skin.Her eyes widened.Oh, 						dear.She couldnt have Robinson 						seeing her like this.Setting aside the brush and the tin back onto the 						silver tray with a clatter, she frantically swiped at her cheeks.Pinching 						her lips together, she leaned in closer to the mirror and rubbed both cheeks 						hard, her calloused fingers burning her skin.She paused and gawked at her 						reflection and her poor skin, which was a glaring red.Georgia groaned and dropped her 						hand away from her face.She looked like a whore whod been slapped by too 						many men in one night.She needed to wash it away.Glancing down at the array of 						glass bottles, she grabbed up what she read was angel water.Twas an 						infusion of myrtle flowers and water that the chambermaid claimed would 						freshen her skin.If it could freshen skin, it could damn well clean 						it.She carefully uncorked it and 						tilted the bottle slightly onto its side to allow a small amount of the 						pungent, sweet smelling liquid to trickle out.It splashed out of the 						bottle, slathering and cooling her entire hand, dripping to the wood floor 						at her feet.She rolled her eyes in 						exasperation and huffed out a breath.Was nothing in life easy?Setting 						aside the bottle, she rubbed her wet and now very heavily scented hand 						against her cheeks.Fortunately, it came off against her fingers, although 						her cheeks were still angry from all the rubbing and swiping shed 						done.She brushed her wet hand against 						her robe and paused, lifting the tips of her fingers to her nose.She 						sniffed.Lovely.Now she smelled like a walking Garden of Eden.Swiping her hands against each 						other one last time, she stepped back.If you cant handle the makeup, 						Georgia, she muttered, how will you handle the man?This was just the beginning of 						transitioning into Robinsons life.She wasnt afraid of any of it, really.She was secure enough to know that with or without makeup or fancy gowns and 						servants, shed still be the same girl.What she wasnt quite so sure of was 						whether or not Robinson would be the same man she had fallen in love 						with.Turning away from the sideboard, 						she edged herself over to the next sideboard set against the wall and 						paused, noticing a crystal decanter filled with some sort of amber colored 						liquid set next to a pair of crystal glasses.Plucking out the stopper, she 						leaned over it and sniffed the strong vapory like scent.Alcohol?Hmm.She 						sure as hell needed it.Though it didnt look like any alcohol shed seen.In her parts it was either white or piss yellow.Lifting the heavy decanter, she 						slid the empty glass beneath it and poured the amber liquid up to the rim of 						the large glass, setting the decanter back onto the sideboard.Daintily 						placing the stopper back into its place with the tips of her fingers and 						feeling, oh, so accomplished, she carefully picked up the brimming glass, 						trying not to spill it.She took a large sip and paused 						as a cedarlike, burning smoothness coated her throat as she swallowed.She 						smacked her lips, trying to decide if she liked it.Then, she took a much 						larger gulp and let it sit in the well of her mouth before swallowing.Not 						bad.Its not whiskey, but its not bad.Sipping on the alcohol, she 						turned and made her way around the room to see what else there was to 						explore.The large mahogany paneled dresser, which now housed all of the ten 						gowns shed brought with her, looked more impressive than the frayed, limp 						dresses within it.It was all too symbolic of how 						she felt.Here she was a frayed gown desperately wanting to be made new.She 						only hoped Robinson didnt give up on her when he realized she was going to 						make a hundred thousand mistakes before she got any of this 					right.A knock on the door made her 						turn.Her heart fluttered.Robinson 						was almost two hours early from the time she had set.Was that a good thing 						or a bad thing?She headed toward the closed door and slowly pulled it open, 						taking another large gulp of her drink to see her through this one.She 						froze with her glass close to her chin, her mouth still full of 						alcohol.It wasnt Robinson at 						all.The duke blinked, his gaze 						falling to her robed appearance and then the drink in her hand.He gestured 						toward it.Ah.Good to know you have some.Good to know.My brandy tray 						isempty.Snapping his gaze back up to her makeup marred face, his gray 						brows came together.He paused.What happened to your face, Mrs.Milton?he slurred.By gad, the man was 						soused!Georgia choked on the liquid 						pooled in her mouth.Unable to swallow, she spit everything back out into 						the glass with a gush.She coughed several times in an effort to free her 						burning throat of constriction and choked out, Rouge.I applied too 						muchrouge.He staggered past her and into 						the room.He fumbled with his cravat and then stripped it, whipping it 						aside.Pour me another brandy.I need it.She awkwardly closed the door 						and glanced back at him, wondering if she could trust him in his inebriated 						state.For safetys sake, she decided not to latch the lock.Just in case 						she needed to run.Hurrying to the other side of 						the room, she set aside her own glass and with a trembling hand poured him a 						brandy into one of the other crystal glasses.Are you certain you should be 						drinkin anymore?You look like youve had more than enough.Youre barely 						standin.He trailed his way toward her 						and lingered.When I lose consciousnessonly then will it be enough.Now 						hand it up.Youll regret it, Your 						Grace.What dont I regret?He 						drunkenly wagged his fingers toward her.She sighed and topped off the 						glass, setting aside the decanter.Slowly swiveling toward him, she passed 						him the glass and snatched up her own, trying to pretend like they were old 						friends.It was awkward.She didnt know him any more than he knew 						her.The duke took a long swallow of 						his brandy before lowering his glass.He eyed her.Do you love him?He 						paused and pointed at her with his glass, causing the liquid to sway.Because I do.I love that boy.I love him more than any father 						should.She fingered her glass, 						astounded that this drink that he called brandy could reduce him to this.It 						was obviously stronger than whiskey.Yes, I love him.I wouldnt be 						standin here subjectin myself to your kind if I didnt.You think a fish 						likes bein pulled out of water?He momentarily closed his eyes 						and nodded before reopening them.Taking another swig of brandy, he shook 						his head.What a mess this is.Here I amwell respectedhave vast 						estatestitles to match and all the money in the goddamn world, but I cant make my 						own son happy.I just cant, no matter how hard I try.All of this is so 						damnwrong.Her throat tightened.Why isnt 						he happy?I know he yearns to be and has the means to be, given his kind, 						open heart.So what prevents him from havin it and knowin it?I dont 						understand.He leveled her with a stare.Tis called impending dukedom and having everything but having nothing all 						the same.It weighs heavily upon a man in London society in a way you 						Americans could never fullycomprehend.Love is but an afterthought.Tis 						duty that is ones life.He drew in a ragged breath before letting it out.He has always lived his life inside his own head and inside his own heart.By God, you should have seen that boy in his younger years.He used to be so 						much more.So much more.Society and duty and being betrayed by his own 						brother is what reduced him to what you now see.Hehe clearly loves you.Tis obvious he does or he would have settled on merely dragging you into 						London as his mistress.Hecame to me, you know, and told me of his 						intentions.He still hasnt returned from his walk, and Im trying not to 						worry, buthe intends to end things between you and him.I wanted you to 						know that.That is why I am here.I wanted you to be ready for 					it.Georgia almost dropped her 						glass, her chest tightening.What?Why?Because Itold him to.I put it 						in his head.I meant well, I just If you think life in a slum is difficult, 						child, you have yet to meet the ton.They will ensure your chamber pot sits in the 						right corner lest they piss in it and make you drink every last drop.Even 						their own arent good enough for them.So can you imagine what they would do 						to you?A damn witch hunt is what it would be and I didnt want that for you 						or him.Despite my well meaning intentions, II cannot help but feel I have 						wronged my own son by making him turn against the last of who he is.Yardleymy first boyhe would have tossed you in the name of duty.That boy 						was a master at shuffling women and their hearts as if they were cards in a 						deck.But my Tremayneno.No.My Tremayne wouldnt have submitted to this.His heart always came first.Always.The duke winced and took another swig 						of his brandy.Im sorry.Im sorry I made a mess of things.She met his gaze in anguish.All I want is to love him.Is that so wrong?The dukes brown eyes softened.And do you know what I want for him?Above all else?His happiness.Plain 						and simple.And it appears he has found it in you.He lowered his gaze to 						his glass and heaved out a breath.Ive beenthinking.I really think you 						and Yardley shouldstay here in New York.London is nothing but a circus and 						a half, anyway.I would be losing my only son to the union, obviously, 						butat least I wouldnt be murdering the last of who he is.I wish there 						were a way to allow you both to live freely with me in London.I really do.He sniffed.I want grandchildren.I want to feel like there is still 						somesomemeaning left, even though my dearest Augustine and my first 						Yardley are gone and my own life is veering to an end.He angled toward 						her, reached out and sloppily patted her head.If I had the means to buy 						your respectability, child, I would.I really, really, really would.Why?Because knowing how much my son adores you makes me adore you.If he deems 						you worthy, you are.Georgia blinked rapidly, 						endlessly touched by his words.She paused and shifted toward him, taking a 						quick swallow of her own brandy.Wait.Now, there was an idea.It was a 						crazy Five Points idea laced with Raymonds and Matthews views of society, 						propaganda and government politics, but one that would allow her to live 						freely and openly with Robinson in London society.Why settle for a measly 						half acre in the west with him when she could seize all four corners of the 						world and make everyone happy?If I gave you the means to buy my respectability, 						Your Grace, would you?Could you?He blinked.I dont quite 						follow.Im a bitmuddled.She gestured toward him with her 						glass.With your prestige and wealth and my will and my way, we could, in 						fact, whisk me into your circle.The question is, would you be up for 						it?He chortled.And I thought 						I had one 						too many brandies.Im not drunk, Your Grace.I 						barely had a few sips.What Im sayin is that you could buy my respectability in 						the same way a politician buys public opinion and then its vote.He cleared his throat and 						lowered his voice, eyeing the closed door.One cannot buy respectability.It 						doesnt work that way.Georgia tossed back the rest of 						her brandy, letting it warm her throat, and quickly set it back onto the 						side table.I disagree.Kings knight peasants and elevate them well above 						their status within a day if it so pleases them.Why couldnt we do the same 						for me?The duke let out a laugh, 						reached out and patted her head sloppily again.Whilst my fortune is vast, 						it isnt quite that vast.And sadly, women cant be 					knighted.She smiled.You dont have to 						knight me.
