Ive been so luckyeverywhere I go with Charlie people like him.Admire him.He had a lot of illnesses and look at himsmart as a whip, polite, handsome.You said that a couple of times, Grace said.What kind of illnesses?Luckily nothing we couldnt survive.But it was terrifying at the time.Asthma, a lot of allergies, a weak immune system, winter colds that turned into bronchitis and pneumonia.When he was three he spent two weeks in the hospital, most of that on oxygen.I dont think a camel could carry the weight of antibiotics hes had in his lifetime.And thats its own worrytoo many antibiotics.Grace glanced at the boy running along the beach below the deck.He seems awfully healthy now.Hes much better, but he has to carry an inhaler and an EpiPen.Hes a little undersizeI know that frustrates him.He hates his glasses but hes nearly blind without them.When hes older, when contacts work or maybe even surgery...Well, Im a nurse.Ive seen young parents through far worse situationscerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, cancer...How is the asthma?Winnie asked.Well, it depends who you ask.If you ask Charlie its much better and he hardly ever uses his inhaler, but he still takes daily medication for it.Charlie is determined its going to go away and Im determined he learns to manage it without telling himself fairy stories that it will disappear.If he eats peanuts or shrimp or gets stung by a beewe could be rushing to the emergency room.Thats why he carries an EpiPen and so do I.  Youre a superwoman, Grace said after a moment of silence.I cant imagine the stress of that.Youre having a baby, Lin Su said.Youll soon realize you have many difficult and stressful moments to deal with and deal with them you will.If theres anything that can make a woman strong, its taking care of her child.Amen, Winnie said.Are you getting by all right now?she asked Lin Su.We dont have a surplus but where is the shame in that?We do fine.Better than ever since weve been taking so many meals with you!She laughed a little, then grew more serious.Were doing very well, thank you for asking, she said.* * * Ginger felt there was an almost magical quality to her life.She put Matt in his truck and sent him on his way home before calling her mother.Sue Dysart cried, she was that happy at the news.Or maybe she was relieved that her only daughter wasnt going to rot on the vine, after all.Or choose another deadbeat like Mick.It was true, Ginger had a new hopea second chance.I hope you never know the agony of watching your daughter suffer through such terrible heartache, Sue said.I dont think theres any pain worse than the pain of watching your own flesh and blood struggle.I was so afraid youd be alone forever.Not because youd never find the right man to build a life with but because you wouldnt let yourself find him.Youre going to love Matt, Ginger said.Hes the sweetest, most loving man Ive ever known and hes so unselfish.I honestly dont know how I found him.Tell me every detail, Sue begged.I can only tell you the details of our courtship, which has been so romantic even if it hasnt been very longjust three months.But three of the most lovely months Ive ever had.From the time the lambs were born and the sheep sheared until now, the onset of the harvest, weve had almost every weekend together.Long weekends.And soon the chaos of the harvest begins with the gathering of extended families every moment they have to spare, helping each other bring in the crops.My goodness, you sound like a farm wife already!Sue laughed.Im already starting to feel like one.She gave her mother all the details she knew of a big farming empire.It would be such a busy few weeks she and Matt werent sure there would be enough time to shop for and buy a proper ring, but he promised her she would have a beautiful one before they were wed.Sue wanted to know what kind of wedding Ginger hoped for.Are you a little afraid Im going to ask you to get me married a half dozen times?Ginger asked.I expect youre looking for entirely different things in a man this time around, Sue said.I know I already apologized to you and Dad for the debacle of Mick, she said.I dont know what to blame that failure of good sense on.I was young, but not that young.Not young enough to be that blind and foolish.I guess love isnt always brilliant even though it seems so at the time.You have no idea how I wish Id been smarter, Ginger said.I guess once you cast your lot with a partner you hang in there until its entirely hopeless.And as she said that she couldnt help but think about Matt and his brief marriage.It wasnt dissimilar, only shorter.Since weve both been married and divorced, we dont really feel like a huge celebration.Just something meaningful and modest, something to match how we feel about moving forward, thats all.It feels very safe and solid.Just safe?her mother asked.Oh, Mom, Im not settling for Matt, please never think that.Matt is like a dream come true, a man and husband I was never wise enough to long for.Just tell me youre completely over Mick, Sue begged in a tense whisper.Poor Mom, Ginger thought.The whole family thought shed lost her mind when she brought home this musician, this wannabe star.I dont blame you for having doubts about my ability to make a sane decision after what I put all of you through.Id love to explain itit was all the glitter that he promised me day after bloody day.The irony isI dont even like a lot of glitter!I wanted it for him.If he fulfilled all those dreams, it would mean Id been right to believe in him.But I wasnt, she said.He lived in such a crazy dream world.It took me too long to realize it was nothing but pipe dreams, nothing but smoke and mirrors.Am I over him?Mom, the shock of reality is not only permanent, its a little hard to live with.I wish Id been wide awake much sooner.She was not only over Mick, she was certain he was completely over her.By now he had certainly found someone to share his fantasies.Youll see, Matt is nothing like that.He comes from a large, hardworking family that values commitment and loyalty, fidelity and sound judgment.Theyre steadfast.Genuine and completely sincere.She laughed.Also loud, a little crazy and noble.Ginger went down the list of Matts siblings, each one she had met and those she only knew about, all so different, from medical practitioner to public relations specialist to vintner to PhD candidate.I think only his youngest sister married in the culture.Her husband is a Basque chef in San Francisco.Theyre not the easiest people to negotiate with, Sue said.But theyre good to their word.Maybe youll end up with some good Basque recipes.Maybe so.But I bet not a day before were married, Ginger said.Her brother Richard had the largest home in the family and wanted to host the barbecue to officially introduce Matt to everyone.It almost rivaled a Lacoumette family gathering, it was that busy and loud.Gingers sisters in law, Beth and Melissa, provided almost all the food with Dick buying excellent meat for the grill and Sue providing dessert that she bought because she was not into cooking or baking at all.The men all knew Matt and had dealt with Matt, George and Paco when negotiating trucking contracts for their crops but they were meeting a social Lacoumette this time, not a shrewd businessman.The conversation was reduced to jests about business associates socializing together as in laws.I suppose the elder Lacoumette will begin to take into consideration that were now family when we write our next contract, Dick Dysart said.Or maybe hell hire an agent to do his negotiating.I think youll be lucky if Paco doesnt insist on driving the trucks, Matt said.Hes a very hands on businessman.My advice?Look at his own truck before you even consider the idea.Its a hundred years old.We know he has plenty of money, Matt, Richard said.Hes getting it from us and our low prices!Is that a fact?Paco said you robbed him blind!Ginger, who had never been a part of the trucking business, learned something.These men were happy to have come to terms that satisfied them and allowed them to call each other thieves.It was an old and time honored system.There were four kids, still enjoying the backyard pool, ranging in age from five to twelve.Her brothers each had a boy and a girl.The food was wonderful, the day passed with everyone in great spirits and the proposed union of Dysart and Lacoumette was heartily and genuinely approved.It was late in the day when everyone was cleaning up and packing up to say their goodbyes that Sue took Ginger aside.She pulled her around the corner of the family room of Richards large house.They stood in a dimly lit hallway and Sue said, I dont want to do this but I wont keep secrets from you.Mick got in touch with me.He doesnt know where you are, which I believe is what you want.He says hes in a crisis and needs to talk to you.Its urgent, he says, and youre the only person who will understand, who can help him, and he asked me to have you call him.What kind of crisis?she asked.Sue shook her head.I dont know, he wouldnt tell me another thing.Is he sick?He wouldnt say.Your father is angryhe told me not to tell you anything about it.But I wont lie.What if he just wants money?Mom, Im not going to give Mick money.Im a slow learner but Im not that slow.Thank God, Sue said.Then you wont call him?Of course Ill call him.Nothing is ever urgent with himunless he wants to tell someone that he just got a personal call from Bruce Springsteen.But you know Mick wouldve told you that.Ill find out what he wants.Im sure itll be a simple matter to tell him to go away, that I dont care about his plans or his concerts, that Im not giving him anything, that Im no longer in any way attached to him.Dont call him, Ginger!Sue said.Dont even tempt fate.Mom, Im not the simple idiot I was when I was with Mick.He cant threaten me or manipulate me anymore.Maybe he wants to make amends.That would be positive.Closure would be good.But Ill make sure hes not dying.What if he is dying?Sue asked.Still, Ginger said.I would be sorry to hear that but were not together and we havent been for a long time.Dont, Ginger.Dont talk to him.Im not afraid of him, Mom.Ill call him.Ill give him as much as ten minutes.Suddenly there was Matt, standing in the hallway.Looming in the hallway, bigger somehow.Broader.His face scowling.It was Mad Matt.No, he said.No.A New Hope        Sixteen Ginger wouldnt let Matt say any more while in her brothers house.Once they were in his truck she turned in her seat to stare at him.He was still frowning.What was that about?she asked.What?he asked, but his expression was angry.He knew.Damn it, he knew!You tell me no?No, I cant return a call if I choose to?Seriously?To your ex husband?The man who ripped your heart out without a second thought?he asked.Yes, Im serious!She thought maybe he was driving a little faster, his hands gripping the wheel.Well talk about this when we get back to your apartment, she said.It was a quick trip back to Matts home.It was a perfectly adequate one bedroom apartment but there were obvious reasons why he wasnt comfortable there.For one thing, once his wife had taken what she wanted, he hadnt bothered to replace much.The bedroom set, a very masculine and heavy bed and dressers, he had purchased for himself after the apartment was nearly emptied of furniture.He had a TV and sectional but all the things that made a house a home were missing.There was one picture on one wall, the other walls blank but sporting the nails pictures had hung on.There was one bedroom lamp, one living room lamp, there were no accents or throws or plants or baskets of papers or magazines.There was a bookshelf filled with only the books he might care aboutagriculture and science related textbooks.They hadnt spent much time there, hadnt prepared any real meals there, but shed been there long enough to notice dishes and glassware were not in great supply.It was a home that had been abandoned and he had done nothing to make it his.He hadnt really tried to wipe out the past and start from scratch.She tossed her purse on the sofa and sat down.Tell me why youre so angry, she said.Do you really have to ask me?he said.Youre going to get in touch with the slimeball who put you through so much!Youre pacing, she said.Please stop.Please sit down and talk to me.He sat, but he wasnt happy about it.Ginger, hes not worth your time.I completely agree, she said.Theres absolutely no threat in asking him whats so urgent.I dont love him, Matt.I dont even like him very much anymore.Do you trust me?Do you believe I wont lie to you?Because I wont lie to you.I love you.He reached for her hand.I want you to hate him, he said.Simple and straightforward.Theres a part of me that does hate him.At least I resent what he did.He used you!I think youre right.And I let him.In fact, I nearly invited him to use me.Im never going to let that happen to me again.What are you afraid of?That Ill give him a kidney?I wouldnt be surprised...Oh, Matt, she said, a slight chuckle coming out of her in spite of it all.If you like, Id be happy for you to listen to the conversation.Ill call him from your phone and you can listen in.Why?Just tell me why?You dont owe him anything!Not for him, she said.For me!Matt, I want to be finished with Mick but not bitter.We were wrong for each other and that mightve been more my fault than his.You excuse him!Over and over!No!she said.No, I dont excuse his behavior!I dont know how he lives with himself.But Im not going to carry hate into our future.I made quite a few misjudgments with Mick.I shouldnt have married him in the first place and I never should have tricked myself into thinking an innocent baby would change our relationship.How do you accept all that so calmly?he nearly raged.Oh, I made a little mistake, lets all just let it go and forget about it!Matt, stop that.I dont know who youre really angry with.Is it your ex wife that makes you so furious?Is it me?Is it Mick, who youve never met?I hate my ex wife, he said, looking away.I cant help you with that, she said.But I can tell you it wont help anything.And it probably wont be good for us.Why?he said.Theyre not going to be a part of us!Youre turning that anger on me, she said.Youre having trouble trusting me because you couldnt trust Natalie.Im not talking about a little anger that burns out quickly.Its like a cancer, eating away at you.Its not good.How would you feel if I wanted to get together with Natalie?he shouted.Maybe you should because youre not at peace with your decision to get a divorce.Are you going to build your life around hating her?And being bitter about her?She could see this was going nowhere.Matt didnt realize most of his anger was with himself.He, like Ginger, was starting to realize he was a participant in whatever had gone wrong.He wasnt at fault, but he was a part of it even if the only thing he was guilty of was marrying her in the first place.Before we can make a new start you have to come to terms with your divorce.You did the right thingit wasnt going to work.You dont have to see her if you dont want to.You dont have to be mad at her anymoreits over.And you dont have to distrust me.If you dont want me to talk to Mick, I wont, she said quietly.But it wont be about me talking to Mick.Itll be about you.You and your pain and anger.Do whatever you want, he said.Im going to bed.Ginger stayed on the couch.She looked at his sparsely furnished apartment with the naked walls.This wasnt just because he was a guy and couldnt be bothered.Hed been talking about the house he wanted to build in great detail and he wanted it to be beautiful and welcoming.He described a nurturing place, a family place filled with love and comfort.This apartment was to Matt what a tombstone was to a cemetery.She tried to imagine him bringing women here.It didnt seem particularly satisfying.He must have felt he was trying to fill an empty spot.She gave him plenty of time before she went to the bedroom.She slipped off her summer dress, brushed her teeth and slid in beside him.He took her instantly into his big, strong arms.Im sorry, sweetheart.I was angry.I hate that bastard.I know.And not just a little angry.I dont like it.I wont talk to you that way again.She snuggled closer.I hope not, Matt.It hurts.I havent done anything to warrant that kind of anger.But maybe I will someday.Then what?You wont, he said.I know you wont.We love each other.Oh, I wont do what Natalie did, she said.I wont do what Mick did.But I might defy you in some way and youll turn into Mad Matt.I dont want to be with Mad Matt.Never again, I promise.She turned in his arms, kissed his bristly chin and said, Can you listen to me without getting angry?Because theres something I want to say to you.And I dont want to ever be afraid youre going to flip out.Say it.You can say anything.Im glad we have the harvest, my love, she said.We need the time, you and I.  Ill do anything I can to help but I think its important to get beyond these people from our pasts that hurt us.I am beyond it, he said.I havent said I want to see Natalie.I want you to see her, she said.He actually jumped a little in surprise.You cant want that!I do.I think it would be good if you talked with her for a while.See if you can understand rather than blame her.But Ginger, its her fault!he said.I was good to her.I tried, for Gods sake.And now you have to try to forgive her, she said.I dont want to bring that hate and anger into our future.I promise I wont let that happen to us, he said.Itll happen.Im not going to be a perfect wife, sweetheart.Im already failing you as a fiancejust the threat of talking to Mick made you wild with anger.Im sure there will be things I do or say that you hate, that make you so angry.Everyone gets a little pissed sometimes...She shook her head.Im not talking about a little grumpy or upset.I know what it is to be madI hung up on Mick the last time I talked to him.Im talking about that rage you feel when you think youre not in control anymore.I dont want to take that forward.I want to go forward with joy.I want the past to be really in the past.I cant tell you how to feel but I think the person you really need to forgive is yourself.Were not perfect human beings.We all make terrible mistakes.Forgive her, Matt.If you ever figure out your part in it, forgive yourself.Then we can move on.He was silent for a moment.Then he growled and turned away from her.She stroked his back.I dont want you to hurt over it anymore, thats all.Because, she thought, we cant make a good marriage on the foundation of all that rage and pain.Maybe I dont know anything, but it seems if you were over it then being with me now would bring you more contentment.Peace of mind.And this doesnt feel like contentment and peace of mind.Even though he had presented his back to her, she curled up to him and eventually went to sleep.Deep in the night she felt his hands on her, his lips on her neck and breast.His touch was so precious to her; she responded to him so naturally.She opened up to him immediately, returned his kisses, held him close, moved with him, took him into her and experienced all the rapture their intimacy always provided.He was slow and gentle until she encouraged him to be a little more urgent and he did what he did best, brought her the ultimate pleasure.Then he held her close and gently stroked her naked body.She was almost back to sleep when his gravelly voice came in the night.I think you have to stop reading psychology or self help books.Were fine.* * * In the morning Ginger was getting ready to leave while Matt scrambled them some eggs.They sat side by side on the sofa, holding their breakfast on trays on their knees.There was tension most obvious by their pleasantness to each other.After helping to wash up the dishes she said, I know youre itching to get out to the farm and I have a long drive.He nodded and pulled her close.Lets not fight, he whispered into her hair.Please.Lets not, she said.Matt, think about getting out of here.This apartment.You hate it and its not a home to you.Its a couple of rooms.And it eats at you.Where do you suggest I go?he said, and she could see that dark look coming into his eyes again.I dont know.Go home.I think you stay there half the time anyway.Where will we go when you come to the farm?he asked.You know for the next several weeks I cant get to Thunder Point.You said youd come up here.I need you beside me.It doesnt matter about me, she said.We could get a room somewhere.We could camp in the hayloft or even stay with my parents.Its just that...Listen, you eat at your mothers table because theres comfort there.You stay at the farm because its warm with allies, with family.This apartment is functional but I think its like nettles in your underwear.Could be time for a fresh start.Ill have a fresh start when my house is ready.Thats a long time for you to be itchy and cranky.If we dont talk about all the difficult stuff, starting with our exes...It wouldnt have worked for me, she said, shaking her head.I couldnt have stayed in my little rented house and just kicked Mick out.I had my marriage in that house and even though I wanted to end it and ending it was the right thing to do, if Id stayed there I think it wouldve been harder for me to move on.Youre not happy here.This isnt your home anymore.And Im not ever going to live here with you.Theres a barrier.He glanced away from her.She could see his jaw tense.Just think about it, Matt, she said.Ill still come to the farm to help during the harvest.Im excited about it.You have family sleeping in every nook when they come to helpI can, too.Ill bed down with you in the back of your truck!Well find a way to be together.Then well get married, he said.You wont have time to think about anything but grapes and pears and potatoes for a while.Lets resolve a few things after the harvest.I love you very much.* * * When Ginger was back in Thunder Point people were very anxious to know how her weekend with Matt and the family went.She put on a smiling face and said it was great.But then she looked for a time Peyton might be able to sneak away for a talk.How about an ice cream sundae at the diner?she asked.Sure.Things are quiet at about two and Scotts in the clinic.Want to meet then?Once they had a booth and their sundaes in front of them, they could talk.So, did Matt win the Dysart seal of approval?Oh, absolutely.But remember, he knew my dad and at least one of my brothers.Apparently theyve done business together over the years.We had a nice time.Peyton tilted her head and peered at Ginger.Why do I sense somethings wrong?Well, something might be wrong.Maybe well just get beyond it easily.Matt lost his temper while we were there.Over something stupid.Uh oh.Mad Matt?One and the same, Ginger said.Mind if I ask what stupid thing?My mother passed on a message that my ex husband, who doesnt have my number anymore, wanted to talk to me.He said it was urgent and I said Id give him a call.Matt went ballistic.Peyton shook her head sympathetically.Would you believe Ive been there?Really?But you and Scott have been together forever!Ginger said.Not exactly, Peyton said.I had just broken up with someone when I took the job in his clinic.I fell for Scott pretty quick.But then the ex called to say he needed my help and sweet, gentle Scott threw a hissy.She whistled.It was impressive.Hard to imagine Scott in a temper...I know.But trust mehe went over the top.And what did you do?Well, as it turned out, it wasnt my ex but his daughter who needed help.Scott was in no frame of mind to listen or understand so I cut him out of the loop.Ginger shook her head.I dont understand.Oh, Scott was throwing around ultimatums and acting like an ass so I just did what I had to do.I did try to patiently explain to Scott that he was going to feel like an ass when he finally understood my situation.I drove to Portland, helped the girl the best I could, told the ex to get his shit together before he lost his whole family, came back to Thunder Point and duked it out with Scott.And I was righthe felt like a fool.He hasnt acted like that big an idiot since.Let me ask you something, Ginger said.Is Matt known for that?A temper?Peyton shook her head.Hes always been the sweetest natured guy in the family.George is very silent and steady.Sal is a little like Pacomelodramatic and interfering.Im like Mamaserious and sometimes quietly controlling, Mikie is a comedian who seems like he doesnt take anything seriously and yet hes close to a PhD in biochem, but Matt has always been a happy guy.Pretty laid back and easygoing.Until his divorce.That seemed to take a lot out of him.Hes not real happy right now.And hes going to be less happy.He basically told me to get over it but hes in for a surprise.Im not going to set a date until were beyond the harvest and I can see whether hes going to be sweet Matt or Mad Matt.Im sure its still about his divorce.I understand, I really do.And Im sympatheticI have some of that baggage myself.I was married to an idiot myself and its not easy letting go of it.But he has to deal with his ex, bring it to a close.I refuse to bring her into our relationship, even if its just in the form of Matts emotional baggage.I thought he was past that!You did?Werent you at your own wedding when Matt was drunk as a skunk?When I shoved him and nearly knocked him out?Ginger asked with a lift of one brow.So, Peyton said, dipping her spoon into her sundae.Whats wrong with him now?I suspect a long list, all having to do with our ex spouses.He blew a gasket when I suggested he talk to Natalie and see if he can lay some ghosts to rest before we try to start a new life together.You suggested that?Peyton asked.She nodded.I understand being crazy mad at your ex, Ginger said.Mick has the ability to make me want to choke him!I called him an asshole and hung up on him the last time we talked, and that wasnt very long ago!I cant recall that anger lasting and I never turned it on Matt.I think he has stuff to deal with.I wish hed do so.She sighed and said, Instead, he told me to stop reading self help books because were fine.Peyton, I love him very much, but were not fine.Im not going to marry a man who lays down laws for me.Whereas my ex didnt care what I did as long as he had no responsibility, Matt has decided what I can and cant do.Thats not going to work.He has to make peace with that failed marriage before he has another one.This could be a challenge, Peyton said.She took another spoonful of ice cream.He is a man.Not exactly the best at introspection, men.Peyton, I know you and Matt have a very loyal and loving relationship, but please let me deal with this without confronting him, Ginger said.Yet, I have to ask, if you have any advice for me based on the fact that you know him better than almost anyone, Ill take it.Happily.I want it to work.But Im not going to make another mistake by refusing to see the real man.I have some advice, she said immediately.Stand your ground.She took another spoonful of ice cream.Dont let him bully you.Dont take any shit.I wont.What are you going to do about your ex?Peyton asked.Oh, Im going to call him.Im going to find out what he wants.I might hang up on him again.I might even call him a very bad name first.But the best way for me to be free of him, of the mistakes we made, is to be honest with him and with myself.If he doesnt hear me, not my problem.How long are you going to let this go on?Peyton asked.Because I let my ex suck me back in over and over.The new guy didnt stand a chance because I was still trying to figure out how to make an old relationship right.Nah, Ginger said.When I call him it will only be the second time weve talked since the divorce almost two years ago.Itll probably be the lastI dont expect Mick to have changed in any way.Howd you let go so easily?Peyton asked.Easily?Ginger repeated.Peyton, I stayed with a man who completely neglected me for three years longer than I should have.I left pregnant and alone, dependent on my parents at the age of twenty eight.My baby died and had no father to grieve for him.There was hardly one more thing life could throw at me to convince me.It definitely wasnt quick.It wasnt for me, either, Peyton said.I had to acknowledge that I let Mick take advantage of me.That mightve been the hardest part.Again, me, too, Peyton said.Im not doing that again, she said.Ill wait for Matt because I do love him.I dont love some ridiculous fantasy man like Mick.I love Matt, the real man.But Im not going to always play by his rules.If he wants a new life with a new wife, hes going to have to assure me hes completely done with the old one.Peyton took a last spoonful of her ice cream.Have I mentioned Matt is incredibly stubborn?And have I mentioned, so am I?* * * Lin Su served lunch on the deck to Winnie and Charlie.Winnie had some small, bite size sandwicheseasy for her to manage if she had coordination or trembling issues.For Charlie, a nice big one with chips.For both of themfruit.On cool days Winnie liked soup, but that could be chaotic and if she spilled, it turned her mood foul.Of course shed have no part of a bib or even a linen napkin tucked into her collar.One of the most interesting developments was Winnies fascination with Charlie.They had formed an unusual friendship.They had lunch together almost every day and sometimes Charlie showed her TED Talks on his laptop, after which they would have a discussion.Not surprisingly, Winnie had become interested in some of the more spiritual and inspirational videos.She had watched the video of Jimmy Valvanos last speech at the ESPY Awards several times until Charlie said, You might have to start watching this in private from now on.Its too sad.You seem to be doing fine, she said.Its inspiring.Maybe if youre dying.Charlie!Lin Su admonished.What?Winnie said.Hes right.Its more meaningful to me for obvious reasons.She looked at Charlie.I havent noticed you crying or anything...Of course Im not crying, he said.It makes my throat hurt though.How about this TED Talk on the power of vulnerability?Sounds like the kind of thing youd like.But what would you like?Theres one on the most important key to successgrit.And theres one I like about a woman who survived a brain hemorrhage and had to rebuild her life, learning to talk and walk all over again.When did you get so smart?she asked him.When I couldnt go outside.Or to school.And when was that?Before allergy shots, mostly.I was allergic to everythinggrass, pollen, dust, animals, everything.Someone gave me a little computer and showed me how to look things up.No Facebook, Lin Su said.The computer is for reading, learning, exploring, not for making jokes or picking on people.I dont think making jokes should be excluded, Winnie said.I dont know this Facebook thing everyone talks about.You might be too old, Charlie said.Charlie!his mother scolded.She shook her head.Im not going to be able to let you two hang out together if youre just going to make trouble for me!A computer was a good idea, Winnie said.Charlie was looking down the beach.A cyclist was riding down the beach road.He was bent low over his handlebars and was moving fast.He was sleek and muscular.Id rather have a bike, he said, watching the rider.The rider stopped right in front of the house next door, the house that was only recently finished except for the interior.He balanced on the bike without putting a foot down; he looked up.Cooper appeared on the deck next door and waved at the cyclist.The man dismounted, picked up his bike and jogged up two flights to the deck.What the hell?Winnie said.Why didnt he just lock it to the stair rail or something?Lin Su said.Mom, I think hes a pro.Hes wearing logos and Nike stuff.That bike probably cost a lot.Bet he sleeps with it.He ran with it, Winnie said.Hes an athlete, Charlie said.And a show off, Lin Su said.The man did leave the bike on the deck, however.He shook hands with Cooper, then they talked.Cooper was pointing, gesturing with his hand, explaining things.Then they went inside together.Hmm, interesting, Winnie said.New neighbor maybe?That would be cool, Charlie said.Lets look up that bike.I bet its worth a billion dollars.A New Hope        Seventeen Ginger talked to Matt at least once every day, despite the tension theyd had while she was in Portland.He was with his father and a couple of brothers and as many cousins as could be rounded up at Sals vineyard to deal with harvesting early grapes.He could have ridden with Paco and George but he drove himself so he could spend one night with her before going home.He was so tired, she could hear it in his voice.This was the hardest yet most fulfilling time of year.She tried to imagine being his wife through weeks like this.Not surprisingly, she could, and she saw it as a very satisfying job.What a monumental achievement it must be to bring in a years worth of healthy crops, do it with your own hands, with your familys support.She not only envied him, she longed to be a part of it.Every night after talking to him she prayed he would resolve his issues soon so they could work together, so they could be together.And then there was Mick.She called him from Graces cell phonea blocked number.My mother delivered a message that you need to speak to me.Ginger.I do.Where are you?Im not in Portland, Mick, and were divorced so theres no need for you to have a phone number or an address.Whats the emergency?His voice was kind of weak.It even cracked.I really have to talk to you face to face.Ill go wherever you are.Mick, just tell me what you need.I probably cant help you anyway...Ginger, I had the worst news Ive ever had and youre the only person who could ever make sense of things for me.That certainly wasnt part of her memory.Are you sick?Oh, Im worse than that, Im not kidding.Ill fly to Houston if youll just talk to me for Thats right, she thought.Shed told him she was in Houston.It had been sarcasm, but of course he wouldnt have realized that.Listen, Mick, I cant be helping my ex husband.I have someone in my life now, someone I love.Yeah, no surprise.Its not about romance, Ginger.Its bigger and more important than that.And you cant tell me on the phone?she pushed.No.No, I cant.One time, thats all.I need your advice.Its life or death.She sighed heavily.How much time is this going to take?I dont know.An hour or two, give or take, he said.Ill come to you, its that important.It must be, she said.He was coming to her for advice.She suspected a brain tumor or something equally terrifying.Perhaps he wanted her advice about treatment options.Theres a casino in North Bend.They have a coffee shop inside.Ill meet you there at three tomorrow afternoon and you can have a half an hour.Jesus, Ginger, whats happened to you?She nearly laughed but stopped herself...in case it was a brain tumor.You have to ask?she said.Three oclock.Thats the best I can do.I have a job, I have an important man in my life.Take it or leave it.She talked it over with Grace and while Grace couldnt even begin to understand why Ginger would accommodate him at all, she agreed to cover for her.Mick was already in the coffee shop, staring into a cup of coffee when she arrived.When she got to his table, he stood.He was peaked, his features drawn, and he appeared thinner.She thought, Oh, God, it is cancer!I have to make my peace with him so Ill have no regrets when he dies!Ginger, he said, reaching toward her.She withdrew slightly.Come on, Mick.This isnt a happy reunion.Just tell me whats wrong.Lets get you some coffee.Okay?Sure, she said, sitting down.Is it your health?Whats this about?If you dont mind me saying so, you dont look so good.He lifted a hand to the waitress and when she came, he ordered another coffee.I dont feel so good, either.My life is falling apart.Im at the bottom.This is the end.Im forty two.Im bottomed out.Explain, she said.Her coffee arrived immediately.Remember Buster Kleinman?he asked.She frowned.Why does the name sound familiar?Why?I talked about him all the time!Hes one of the biggest agent/managers in the music business.Hes tight with every recording studio in the country.Hes represented some of the biggest names in the industry.So?she said.You already have an agent.Not a big agent.I need some power behind me.Morts small time.But I got an in to see Buster, to take a meeting and play for him.I sent him CDs all the time but finally Rory Denison, six Grammys, number one on the charts, he forwarded one of my CDs to Buster and I got an appointment.We really hit it off, me and Buster.We had some drinks, some dinner, talked for hours and the next day I went to his private studio and played for him.No, she thought.This is why I drove to North Bend?She told herself not to throw hot coffee on him.It would be poor form, especially after her stand off with Matt about anger.Congratulations, she said.And this concerns me how?You know me better than anyone, Ginger.We were together for years.You know as much about my music as I do.We talked about my playlist after every performance.You told me which songs were my best.You listened to my backup musicians and singers.Your ear is almost as good as mine.This is about your music?she asked, astonished.He said I just wouldnt work for him, that I have a good voice but no magic.He said I dont have what hes looking for, that he needs to see more passion, more emotional instinct.I lack passion?Have you ever known anyone in the business with more passion?Do you know anyone who wants it more, anyone who would do more to get to the top?He said my desire isnt translating, isnt tracking.He said I was a perfectly good entertainer but good isnt enough.How am I supposed to deal with that?Whats he talking about?Ive been taking every gig I can get for twenty years, jamming whenever I can, traveling, pouring every minute and every dime into it, reaching out to every famous musician in the business, sending every person with any clout sample CDs.No one has more passion than I do!And he wouldnt even talk about it.Ginger felt a little numb around the ears and neck.She was completely flabbergasted.What in the name of God do you want from me?she asked, keeping her voice level.Tell me what I did wrong because I know my sound is good.I know my performance is at the top of my gamepeople follow me, just to hear me play.They stand in line!I know a hundred singer/songwriters in the business who arent as good as I am who are getting more breaks!This isnt happening to me, she said, her fingers on her temples, slowly massaging.Youve always leveled with me, Ginger.What the hell could he mean?I think if I figure it out, Ill get one more shot with him because he liked me.If I give the right impression, hell listen to me once more.I wont rush backIll make sure he thinks I really put some time and thought into it, but I know hes wrong.I have presence.Ive been told I could be number one.Probably I didnt take the right music, didnt choose the right songs.I should probably include some more Lynyrd Skynyrd.And believe it or not, Neil Diamond works pretty well in auditions.Maybe I should beef up my own music, some of the stuff I sold, but that stuff didnt really score on the charts.Still, I think it was the way it was performed, not the music...Oh.My.God, she said.She stood up and turned to walk away.She was about three feet from the table when he cried out for her.Ginger!Please!I know you can tell me what to do!This could be the chance of a lifetime.She stopped walking and just stood there for a second.I really am too nice, she said softly.Maybe Matt is too angry and Im too nice.Ginger, come on, baby...She whirled on him.How dare he call her baby!Her eyes must have flashed in rage.Whoa, Ginger, he said.Just want your thoughts.I mean, who else would I ask?I want to give him what he wants.He says I dont bring enough emotion to the music.Shed driven an hour.She had her pregnant boss covering for her.There was very little hope that she could get anywhere with Mick, but...She went back to the table and sat down.She looked into her cup for a moment and when she looked up, he was staring at her expectantly, his eyes huge, waiting for some magic formula that would change everything.Its not your sound.Its not your choice of music.Its you.Huh?he asked, thrown back in his seat.Its just you.He was silent for a long moment.Youre still really pissed, I guess, he finally said.Thanks for nothing.No, Im not pissed, she said.Its the truth.Its you.You have nothing to give.You have a lovely voice and youre very entertaining.I bet youll play for people your whole life.In fact, youll always work, always.But you dont have that incredible, indescribable ecstasy when you play, just pulling the wonder out of the music, because the music is less important to you than being a star.You dont create relationships with the people you play for, you play at them.You get ecstasy from schmoozing with stars, from your big dreams.You dont work at getting better I practice all the time, he argued, cutting her off.She held up a hand, her eyes closing gently.You perform all the time.You run in a crowd of fans who live to hear you play, hear your stories, praise you, worship you.You name drop.Youve sent out so many CDs to superstars begging for help to make you a superstar, the number is probably too high to count.Every time you hear of a new producer, you shoot off your CD before you even find out if its a good match.You carry them with you everywhere you go.You dont ask people how they are, you tell them all about how great you are.I mean, here you called me all the way to North Bend and you dont even care how I am!Course I do...I just...You dont feel the music in your bones.I bet The Boss has a closet full of your CDs and has never listened to one.You never ask how you can make your music better.And let me guesswhen you were at dinner with this Buster characterI bet you mentioned every famous musician youve ever known even if you just ran into them once in the mens room.Hell, a lot of that is rsum material, you know...Ive played with some of those famous musicians, you know!Not with, Mick!You opened for a few!You dont get happiness from your art, you want money and fame.The agent is probably looking for someone whos pouring love out, not sucking it in.A singer who gets so much satisfaction from his music he doesnt care if he ever gets paid.All you want is to be a star.Instead of telling this Buster guy how grateful you were for an opportunity to play for him, you tried to show off.He was speechless for a moment.Its important, you know, who in the business youve met, who youve jammed with.And if Im a star wont that mean Im memorable and satisfying?You have your cart before your horse.Your priorities are all wrong.You cant infuse your music with love until youve loved, deeply and unselfishly.You cant bring joy to the music until youve poured it into life.Same with grief, agony, ecstasy, fierce desire, loss...Its like method actingdrawing on your own life experience to relate as closely as possible to the music, to the lyrics.You have to have those feelings in your life before you can have them in your music.Instead of sacrificing for the sake of a good life, life you can bring to your art, youve been sacrificing for the sake of fame.As you get older you get more desperate, more arrogant.Youre looking for your break, not your insight.Theres no question in my mind you would do anything to be number one.Youd sell your soul for it.I think you have!And from all I hear, fame isnt that much fun.Yeah, he said with a hollow laugh.Right.Well, I promise you money and fame wont hug you on cold, lonely winter nights...Buster saw it.Your passion is for notoriety, not for art.Its empty, Mick.Its not real.But great music and feeling joy from creating it, conveying authentic feelings, thats real.You should learn to pull up the emotions of an experience, like meeting or losing the love of your life, and it should be so real you cry!The best sound, the most unique voice, the beauty of your instrument.Emotions youve experienced.Thats real.She shook her head.If you start with your life and your art you wont have to talk about all the great singers you met in the mens room or how many stars have your CDs because it wont matter.Hard, hard work, focus on real living and real emotion, not on the stature you want.Its not just marketing, its talent.Youre not authentic, Mick, thats the problem.You have a good voice and a lot of arrogance.And youre selfish.That doesnt translate well.He was silent, mouth open slightly.He mulled this over.You have a great strategy there, Ginger.If he thinks I dont care about success but just want to share my great music...She rolled her eyes.I think youre really onto something there, Ginger.I think Buster will go for it.Good luck, she said, making to rise again.Ginger, he said.Youve always been there for me.I know.I did my best.But thats in the past, Mick.I have a man in my life and I dont want you to ask for my help again.Who is this man?he asked.His name is Matt, she said with a smile.Hes a farmer.Seriously?A farmer?Wow, I wouldve never seen that coming!The smartest, sexiest man Ive ever known.Ever?he asked.She leaned toward him.Ever.But hey.We were happy once, werent we?I mean, I was happy and I thought you were happy.You loved me.You loved my music.Uh huh.And you loved you.It was very compact.I was almost superfluous.You always had very big dreams.They didnt leave much room for anything or anybody else.He frowned.What are you saying?That you loved who you thought Id become?Not really.But I think I mightve loved who you thought you would become.And I was pretty youngit mightve been the way you moved your hips when you sauntered on stage with all that confidence.In the end, it was very lonely.I wish you the best but Im glad not to be in that relationship anymore.It really wasnt good for either one of us.Im going now.Dont call my mother againit gets everyone all riled up.My brothers want to beat you up and gee, if one of them broke your jaw, think how inconvenient...Very funny, he said.You came, Ginger.Thanks for that.I think your ideas really helped.Right, she said.Strategy.Not hard work or sincerity or honesty, but strategy to get ahead faster, to make money more quickly, to be the top dog.
