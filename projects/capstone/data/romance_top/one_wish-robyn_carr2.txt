She never imagined shed have this with anyone and certainly not the very guy she lusted after.They had kissed for an hour.He didnt rush her, didnt push her, didnt treat her like someone he was using to pass the time and it was delicious!She decided to close her eyes and dream about him, dream about them taking it to the next level.She was twenty eight; she so wanted to know what that was like.Instead she dreamed of Mikhail, the little Russian in his sixties with a cane he pounded for emphasis, shouting in half Russian and half English.It was so unfair, she thought, slowly rousing to the sound of knocking that was not Mikhails cane.She was suddenly afraid and her heart started racing.Who could be pounding after one in the morning?Then she saw that it was starting to grow light and at just that moment she heard Troys voice.Gracie?Gracie?Its me, he called softly.She opened the door for him.He was holding a bag.What in the world are you doing here at the crack of dawn?He looked at his watch.Its nine, Grace.Nine?It looks like the sun isnt even awake!Its a gloomy day.I brought breakfast and then Im going to take you storm watching.Why?she said, frowning.Because the swells are huge and I think you need me to show you how to have fun.I beg your pardon, I know how to have fun.Working all the time, then working out for diversion.Nah, you definitely need a coach.Well start smalljust a little sightseeing.There are big swells, the waves will be awesome.But its cold.He put his bag on the little table.And its kind of wet.You should dress warm, but first, breakfast.He pulled some fast food breakfast burritos and potato pancakes out of the bag.Lots of them.On the bottom were two large coffees.Hungry, Troy?Starving.He sat down and peeled the wrapper off one of the breakfast burritos.Come on, Grace.Lets do it.This is going to get you all excited.Promise.I was going to catch up on some paperwork since the shop is closed today.Accounting and stuff.He shook his head.See what I mean?This is exactly why I came over.I dont know you that well but I already know youre working too much.I have two jobs and still manage to take some days off.He took a big bite.Its New Years Day.Its a holiday.She sat opposite him and reached for one of the burritos.He was right.Not only was he right, shed told him last night she needed to find more balance.Do you have an aversion to making plans?No, he said.Im usually much more politecall ahead, make plans, all that stuff that girls like.Ill work on that.For now, I think we should have some fun.Especially today.There are lots of football games on TV.Im recording them, he said.I might not watch them all and Im not going to sit around inside all day when there are things to do.Youll be glad you let me drag you out, he said.Well see, she said, but she already was.Three  				The outstanding question is why have you appointed yourself my fun coach?Grace asked once they were in Troys Jeep and driving.Its not complicated at all, he said.I need someone to play with.I work a lot.I give a lot to the students.I have a second job at least ten days a month.Between school vacations and weekends, I manage some time off and Cooper is great about letting me put together days off from his place so I have time to pursue my interests.When Im not working I look for fun things to do.Mostly skiing, diving or river trips, but since theres decent skiing and diving right here, I only take about one big trip every year.There are lots of places I need to seeCosta Rica, Barcelona, Paris, Montreal, China, to name just a few.My real passion is kayaking or rafting and, honey, there are some rivers in the tristate area that can keep me busy through spring and summer.Who knows?Maybe youll try it sometime, maybe not.But this is a great place, Gracetheres a ton of stuff to do and see and experience.You need someone to play with, she repeated as if that was the only thing she got out of all that.But it wasnt what she was thinking.Ive been all over the world.I could almost work as a guide.Except, Grace had never toured the countries shed visited, never really taken in the sights.Shed been all over the world to compete.Usually with an entourage.And now, Troy needed someone to play with?Her heart beat a little faster.Well, thats not the whole story, Troy continued.Im not shy about doing things on my own.I meet people all the time, great people who have like interests.But, Grace, youre kind of fun.Lets see if theres anything you like better than working all the damn time.You have a point, she agreed.The problem is I have my own business.And every day off  				I know, every day off is a day without pay.You pay attention, she said.Its admirable, having your own business.But I think your business is a ball and chain.Its all about working out a schedule you can live with, Grace.People dont need flowers twenty four/seven.And I bet youll be a happier business owner if you get out a little more.Of course he had no idea how much getting out she indulged in because she didnt talk about it muchher yoga, working out, secret skating.So thats why you think you can kidnap me like this?Really, Grace?Kidnap?Hijack.Look at that coast, he said as he drove north.Damn, not a day to go fishing, I dont think.Have you seen the coast up this far?Of course, she lied.In fact, shed driven down the coast from Portland one summer, barely took in the landscape, made a bid to buy the shop and went right back to Mamie and Ross, where she spent a week lost in a panic attack, terrified of being completely on her own.She was so nervous she nearly called her mother!In the end, she toughed it out and when her offer was accepted by Iris, she drove straight to Thunder Point, never really taking in the coastal beauty.They passed through the outskirts of North Bend and then Coos Bay.It appeared very little was open for business, it being a holiday.There were a few bars and a Chinese restaurant that seemed to have customers.A souvenir shop on the highway had an Open light shining in the door.Gas stations were operational and a firehouse had the big rig doors spread wide.But the traffic was sparse.Everyone was probably home taking in the football games and recovering from New Years Eve.Have you ever seen it on a day like today?he asked as they drove toward the ocean.He pulled into a small lookout that faced the water.The clouds were dark and the wind was blowing wicked and wet.There were patches of rain over the ocean and the waves were huge.The air was frigid and the fun coach was grinning.Yeah, this is gonna be great, he said.What in Gods name have I let you get me into?she asked.He laughed as if he found that extremely amusing.He put a knit stocking cap on his head and jumped out of the Jeep.When she joined him, he grabbed her hand and pulled her along a path that she knew led to the edge of the lookout because she could hear the deafening sound of crashing waves.When the path crested she stepped back with sudden anxiety.The waves looked like mountains as they crashed against the rocks.God, she said, but only God could have heard her above that noise.Come on, he said.Theyre about a hundred feet in some places, some of the biggest waves in the world.We can get closer.Its safe.She shook her head.I can see just fine!What?She put her hands around her mouth and shouted in his ear.I can see fine!He laughed.He put his mouth close to her ear.Its safe.Look, theres a stone wall.Not like well slide off.I can see from here that its dry.I want to get a couple of pictures with my phone.It was a very low stone wall, about knee high.She shook her head.A lot.Is it scary, Grace?he asked, shouting.She nodded.Ill go check, he yelled.He let go of her hand and walked along the path closer to the edge.Waves rose above the level of the ground she stood on, but they crashed to the surf below.The path began to wind downward, which gave her no peace of mind and she hung back.She wasnt sure of herself on high cliffs over rocky shores facing off with hundred foot waves.Troy continued on, of course.The waves were magnificent, she had to admit.The power was stunning, no other word.Troy leaned against the wall, his back to the ocean, and waved at her.She waved back.He jumped over the wall and walked a bit farther toward the edge and she felt her stomach clench.There was a sign, for Gods sake!Dont Go Past This Point!But over the wall he went.He turned toward her and shouted something that she didnt have a prayer of hearing so she just shook her head.He spread his arms wide and high, as if in victory.Probably the award winning wave of the day came up behind him and her eyes grew as round as plates.Her mouth hung open and she watched in awe as the crest of the enormous wave came down on Troy.She screamed in terror, afraid hed been washed out to sea.As it receded, there he stood, looking for all the world like a drowned rat.With gunk hanging from one shoulder.Grace grabbed her heart in relief.He just stood there.Dripping.He plucked the gunk off his shoulder and began to climb back over the wall.After a couple of relieved breaths, once she was sure the fun coach was all right, Grace hugged herself and sank to her knees in hysterical laughter.She could barely see him trudging toward her because her eyes were watering with tears.His jacket and pants were heavy from water, making his movements slow.She wanted to spring into action and tell him she was taking charge, except she couldnt talk.Instead, she rose slowly to her feet and by the time he reached her, she was upright again.She took his hand and pulled him back up the path toward the Jeep.Oh, my God, she rasped weakly, still hysterical with laughter.Oh, Troy!Its thirty eight degrees, he said, shivering.Get a grip!Stop laughing!Im sorry, she said, but she couldnt stop.I had no idea you could be such a funny fun coach!Get inIm driving.Its m m my new Jeep!Youre shaking.Ill drive, crank up the heater and you can start peeling off wet clothes.I dont suppose you have a blanket in the car?N n no.That was a f f freak wave!There was a sign!she said.Did you want to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel, too?Funny.Youre so f funny.Oh, God, I wish Id gotten a picture.Here, she said, opening the passenger door.In you g g go!she said, mocking him.Then she doubled over in laughter again.By the time she got into the drivers seat, he had already started the engine.Take off that jacket and throw it in the back.And that stocking cap, she said, yanking it off his head and pitching it over her shoulder.It took him a minute to peel off the jacket and once he had, she started touching his shirt.Not that bad, really, but still wet.That was probably forty gallons of water.Then she touched his pants, patting his thighs and knees.Oh oh.These are soaked.Hang in there, the heater will get going pretty quick.She put on her seat belt and made a big U turn, taking off down the road.Hunching up against the steering wheel, she was still laughing.That was seriously the funniest thing Ive ever seen in my life, she said.Shut up, Grace.That only made her laugh harder.Relax, Im going to fix this for you.I hope.How?Youll see.Dont be so crabbyIm going to get you dry.Troy aimed all the vents at himself and turned up the fan.Lucky I didnt get washed off the edge, he muttered, rubbing his hands together.I admit, that wouldnt have been as funny, she said.You have a very big laugh for a little girl.I know.A few minutes later, she parked in front of the souvenir shop.What are you doing?he asked.Youll see.She grabbed her purse and jumped out, leaving the car running for him.She jogged inside and less than five minutes later came running back to the car with a roll of paper towels in one hand and a shopping bag in the other.These were donated by the cashier, she said, handing him the paper towels.And these are for you!Grinning widely, she pulled a sweatshirt out of the bagit read My Heart Is in Coos Bay.I got the largest one.And here are some shorts.She pulled out a pair of womens shorts with eyelet lace sewn around the legs.Theyre actually from a pajama set, but theyre XL.They didnt have any mens pants, just tops.This was all they had, but theyre dry.Youre kidding, right?Its okay, you have nice narrow hips.If this place hadnt had clothes, I was going to take you to that fire station, but this is better.And you dont ever have to wear them again, just till we get you home.She craned her neck, looking around.They were alone in the parking lot.Take off your shirt and dry your head and body...In the car?Youre a guy!Guys strip on the street if they have to!Guys pee off boats!He ripped off his shirt and used paper towels to dry his hair, neck and his damp chest.He put on the sweatshirt.Good.Thats good.Pants.Come on.Theyre not that wet...Youre soaked.I wont look, she said, turning away.Im okay, but thanks for the thought.Your pants are wet and its cold.You already made the seat wetget your pants off and sit on a bunch of paper towels.Even if we get it warm in here, you cant be sitting in cold, wet pants.Its New Years Day and nothing is open.Howd you know about this place?We passed it on the way up.I asked myself what would be open on a holidaythe souvenir shop was all I could think of.She smiled.I almost grabbed you a couple of refrigerator magnets while I was in there.She touched his shoulder.Put on the nice, dry shorts, Troy.Ill close my eyes.Besides, cold and wet as you are, there probably isnt that much to see.He lifted one eyebrow.Did it ever occur to you thats why Im not undressing in front of you?Fine, she said.Ill go back inside the store.Theres no one in the parking lot.Get it done.And with that, she was out of the car.She chatted it up with the cashier for a minute, explaining Troys shyness.She glanced at her watch, supposing enough time had passed.When she walked back outside, what she saw caused her to stop dead in her tracks.A police car was parked next to the Jeep and an officer had Troy out of the car, standing in his wet stocking feet wearing his ladies shorts, talking and shivering.Oh, no!she thought.He must have been changing when the officer pulled up.Of course he had to take off his shoes to get out of his pants.She could imagine what the officer thought!She took two steps toward them to help, to be a witness to Troys explanation.But she started to laugh again and was absolutely no help at all.* * *  				Troy insisted on taking over the driving.He was no longer chattering and shaking.He was, however, a little out of sorts.And he cast glances at Grace, who was looking out the window attempting not to laugh, the attempt causing her to snort now and then.She turned toward him, her hand suspiciously covering her mouth.So, how did the police become involved?He snuck up on me as I was changing pants.I was at a disadvantage.My wet jeans were tossed over the seat and these pretty little shorts you so kindly bought me were around my ankles and I was drying off when I looked up and he was staring in the window.He told me to get out of the car.I had barely stopped explaining the situation when you came out of the store and laughed until you almost peed yourself.Im writing a letter to the city council.I think its unprofessional for a police officer to laugh until he farts.Grace quickly looked out the window.She snorted again.She got the hiccups.Glad I could be so entertaining, he grumbled.Are you going to drop me off at the flower shop?she asked.Oh ho, no way, Gracie.I mightve screwed up my first attempt at showing you how to have fun but Im not giving up.And Im not letting you do accounting on a holiday!Ill just clean up and well go at it again.Really, Troy, I think your work here is done.I dont think Ive ever had more fun in my life.She snickered a little and bit her lip.Besides, I think you might be mad at me for laughing.And that doesnt sound like fun.Im not mad, he snapped.Im wet!He took a breath and said, Ill be more fun when Im dry and not wearing girl pants.I think youre fun right now, she said.Then she grinned at him.He parked behind his apartment complex and led her up to the second floor, leaving all his wet clothing outside the door.He unlocked his dead bolt.Once inside, she looked around.Wow.Nice.He smiled to himself.It was a crappy old complex on the outside, but Troy had done a little work on the inside.Hed painted, for one thing, and bought a nice, deep and fluffy area rug to put over the old and worn carpeting in the living room.He had some nice shelving and a fifty seven inch flat screen.Hed made repairs and improvements here and there, like taking down the shower curtain and installing a glass shower door, sanding and refinishing the bathroom cabinets, scrubbing the place like he owned it.His parents old leather sectional fit right in.The only things he had that were new were the butcher block table and high chairs.His bedroom furniture was only a few years old and he had been collecting a few framed LeRoy Neiman prints for the walls.The frames were more valuable than the prints, but he liked Neimans sports art.Make yourself at home.Help yourself to anythingeat, drink, whatever.Theres the remote.I have to get a shower.Ill be quick.He left her standing in the small living room.Once he was under the hot water, sudsing the smell of salt and seaweed from his hair and body, he smiled to himself.Grace was a free spirit.A little wild and uncontrolled with a deep down joy and playfulness that turned him on.He mightve acted a little insulted at her lusty humor directed at him but, to be honest, he wouldnt have it any other way.That was no prissy little laugh the girl had: she laughed down to her toes.There was passion in her.He revisited his checklist in his mind and moved She must be a happy person to number one in his requirements.If that meant laughing at his foibles, he could live with that.Grace didnt come across as whiny, self pitying, cloying or desperate.If he demanded a woman be a good sport, then he had to be, too.And who forced him to jump that wall?Hed been showing off.He loved showing off.She might just prove to be a good little playmate.When he got back to the living room to Grace, she was curled up in the corner of the sectional, holding a cup of something hot with both hands.Her boots were sitting at attention beside the couch and she was wearing bright pink socks.One of the many New Years Day bowl games was on television.He stood looking down at her, smiling, with his hands on his hips.Do you feel better?she asked a little sheepishly.Im tempted to hold you down and give you something to really laugh about.You ticklish, Gracie?She pulled back a little.Dont even think about it, she said, holding up the cup.Im armed.What is that?Hot chocolate.You had some envelopes of mix in the drawer by the refrigerator.He wrinkled his brow.That could be very old.I dont think dry powders spoil.Want to taste it?Thanks, he said, reaching for the cup.She handed it to him and he put it behind him on the coffee table.Then he tackled her on the couch.While she shrieked and begged and laughed, he pinned her with his body and attempted to tickle her.Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry, she squealed.What are you sorry for, Grace?he asked, a devilish gleam in his eyes, pinning her to the sofa.Im sorry I laughed and bruised your delicate little male ego, she said, smiling.Ooh, he growled, giving her a good rib tickle.Ack!Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry!Stop it, stop it!What are you sorry for?Okay, I lost it, I was out of control, I laughed at you when you were vulnerable and Im sorry.No tickling!A cop was threatening to arrest me for indecent exposure!Troy said.He thought I was a parking lot predator!A smile beamed across her face.That was the best, she said.Im sorry, but that was the best part.Although, that wave...I will never see anything like that again in my lifetime!You are an excellent fun coach.It wasnt my intention that you have fun at my expense, he said.But he was smiling when he said it.I was going to show you how to have a good time.And so you did, she said, smiling into his eyes.Think of how successful that mightve been if you could read.I mean, there was a sign.Can I make you some stale hot chocolate?I dont think so.I think my mother sent me that in one of her many boring care packages.What should we do today?Want to go out?Any ideas?She shook her head.Lets stay in, he said.Lets make some game food.I have stuff in the freezer.I have tri tip and buns for tri tip sliders.Or we can go with wings or pizza.I have beer but no wine.I have wine in the flower cooler, she said.I just feel like such a slouch, eating so much trash and bar food.Ill slice some onion and pickles for your sliders.I have some deli potato salad but I dont know...Dangerous?she asked.By this date, very likely.I dont expect you to be that much of a good sport.Oh, so thats your game?You want a good sport?He gave her a quick kiss.I want to enjoy myself with someone whos enjoying herself.I have a feeling, a dark feeling, you dont need my help with that.Okay.Ill do one more day of carbs and fats.But the next time we eat together there will be green things.I love green things, he lied.He told her to take the Jeep to her place to retrieve her wine and she brought back a Scrabble game.She also threw in a DVD of one of her favorite non chick flicks, Red.He looked at it and said, I love Red!Just in case your brain goes numb from football, she said.But I can do football as long as you can.They had a rousing game of Scrabble, which Troy won by a stretch.They curled up on the couch together to watch Red.Every once in a while Troy invaded her space for a make out session.In midafternoon they worked together in the kitchen to build some sliders, which they ate on big plates in front of the TV.Troy quizzed her about football teams and stats.Youre a big football fan, he said.Im a small football fan, she corrected.Or maybe medium.I enjoy the game but I dont live for it like some people do.And I have a good memory for football facts.And your favorite sport?he asked.Thats a tough question.I think I like watching everything competitive.I think Ill invite you to my Super Bowl party, he said while they rinsed the dishes.Youre having a Super Bowl party?Uh huh, he said, directing her back to the couch, pulling her down and getting her back in his arms.He loved that there was no hesitation from her.His arms went around her waist, hers went around his neck, lips on lips and bodies pressed together.It being the height of winter, the sun was lowering and the only light was that from the kitchen and the TV.Whos coming to your party?she asked, lips pressed against his neck.Im thinking of a very small party.It could be a private party.He caressed her back, her sides, ran a hand over her butt and down her thigh.Maybe just us.Im not sleeping with you, she said.He backed off a little.Ever?Im not ready, she told him.I want to know you better.Thats very reasonable, he said, kissing her again.But really, Gracie, you taste so good...Thats sweet.Im still not ready.Are you going to be unready for a real long time?Because, honey, you are a turn on.And I risked my life for you on the cliffs of Coos Bay today.Just to make you happy.She chuckled against his lips.You are such a giving man.Ill be sure to let you know when Im ready.Just out of curiosity, Grace, are you waiting for a sign?She nodded.I am.Plus, Id like to be sure youre all done pining over Iris.That just feels weird.Troy immediately put a little space between them.He grew serious.Iris is married, Grace.I know this.I was there.Listen, heres how it is.Im crazy about Iris.Shes an awesome person and great counselor for the kids.I consider her a good friend.Its true, for a long time I thought if she gave it a chance we might be more than friends, but we werent on the same page.All right?We were never on the same page and even though she told me over and over, I thought she might reconsider.She didnt.I know all that, but you have to rememberIris is my good friend, too.I dont want the situation to be awkward.I hope were all good friends for a long, long time, he said.When I kiss you, Im not thinking about Iris.Im not thinking about anyone but you.She frowned slightly.Im pretty sure you didnt answer the question, she said.Iris married the love of her life, her one true and forever love.Even if I did still carry a torch for her, Id never admit it.Especially to you.But I dont.Shes moved on and so have I.  Do you believe me?She smiled a little bit.Her expression said she didnt believe him at all, but how could she argue without calling him a liar.Okay, I believe you, she said.But there are also things about me...I want you to get to know me a little better.Im ready whenever you are.But so far, youre the mystery.You have some pretty vague answers to questions about your life, your family, your friends...I know, Troy.Since I was raised an only child, isolated in some ways, I tend to be on the private side.If youre just patient...He leaned toward her.He kissed her again and she melted into him.How do you like me so far?he asked against her lips.She smiled without breaking her hold on him.Youre growing on me.You can trust me.When youre ready to tell me more, you can trust me.And you can ask me anything.Okay.One important question before we go any further.Are you sure Im not just a booty call?Four  				On January second, Grace did an inventory of her stock, updated her calendar, cleaned out the flower bin and made herself a to do list.She had two couples coming in at the end of the month to get estimates for spring weddings.Valentines Day would be her next major event and she wanted to begin decorating the shop right away.Soon it would be spring, when her stock would be more beautiful and plentiful than ever.The most important thing on her list was to find help for the shop!She really wanted to spend more time with the fun coach.Being with Troy was intoxicating.They made out like teenagers, but she knew she was going to have to get ready for the next stage.Oh, so inviting!She was amazed he agreed not to rush her.She heard the bell on the shop door tinkle and looked out of her workroom to see a familiar face as Al Michel stepped into the shop.He had the most handsome smile, a man who seemed perpetually happy.He was a big man, in his fifties with a powerful physique, who looked impervious to aging.He wore his blue work shirt, his name embroidered above the pocket.Hey there, she said, coming into the shop.How was Christmas?Excellent, he said.And what made it so special?she asked.Well, my lady, for one thing, Ray Anne really went overboard to make sure it was nice for the boys.We had Christmas Eve at her house and she cooked most of the food, but I helped a little.She decorated and wrapped presents for everyone.Christmas Day was at our house, but she took care of most of the food.We brought the boys mom from the nursing home for a few hours and it was great.Her MS is under control for the moment, and I could tell the boys were proud to have her home, if only for a little while.I think it was the nicest holiday any of us has had in years, especially the boys.Grace leaned on her counter and tilted her head.I dont have any idea how you got hooked up with those boys, she said.Simple, he said.Justin, the oldest, worked with me at the service station.Hes nineteen and real private.I found out he was taking care of his mother and two younger brothers, killing himself to hold it all together while his mom was just getting more and more infirm.So we teamed upme and the boys.Im their foster father.Their mom needed the nursing home and it made sense for me to move into their house.The two younger boys are in school.Theyre good kids, but they still need supervision.Not constant, but regular.Know what I mean?But just to be sure things couldnt be simple or real easy, I found my lady, Ray Anne, right about the same time I found my family of boys.He shook his head and chuckled.Now, Ray Anne is a good woman and I think she loves those boys like theyre her own, but shes...He cleared his throat.I dont know if Ray Anne even knows how old she is, but shes not as young as she looks.Shes probably too set in her ways to live with a man like me and three teenage boys.Shes particular and fussy.The way we got it worked out is good.I live with the boys, she lives in her own house.She visits, invites us over sometimes, and then theres the times those boys grant me leave and I visit my lady without them chaperoning.It verges on a perfect life.Wow.All that happened at once?Pretty much, he said.I didnt think Id ever be this settled.In two houses, Grace said with a laugh.Aw, it wont be two houses forever.Justin passed his GED and were looking into college courses.Scares him to death but the boy is smarter than he thinks.Dannys in high school, Kevins almost done with middle school.Before I know it, I wont be that necessary to them.Oh, I bet youll be the dad for a long time to come.Maybe even a grandpa.Hush now, he said, grinning.Were in the grandparent prevention program at my house.Those boys dont need any more complications.Now, Grace, I should take my lady some pretty flowers.She worked so hard over Christmas to make sure me and the crew had a great holiday.That woman is a dream come true.Whatve you got thats perfect for her?I just cleaned out the bin, she said.Would you like a bouquet or an arrangement?I dont know, he said with a shrug.Whats the difference?The last flowers I sold you in the square vasethat was a bouquet.A table arrangement is like a centerpiece for her table or bedroom dresser.I have some lavender and white roses, hydrangea, liliesthe pretty green and white ones.Next week Ill have a new crop of calla lilies.He contemplated for a second and she was thinking what a good catch he must bea man with tender feelings, strong enough to take on a brood of teenage boys and sensitive enough to think of his lady with flowers.Just make something pretty, Grace.Fifty bucks or so?Wow, you do love that lady.Every time I think of her I want to fill her house with flowers.Ray likes pretty things.I waited a long time to find someone like her.Whats it like, asking three teenage boys if you can go out on a date?He laughed.A lot of monkey business, kissing noises, that kind of thing.Especially the younger twoI cant wait till they have girlfriends.Im planning to be relentless and obnoxious, theyve earned it.So, how much time do you need on the flowers?Thirty minutes, tops.Want to wait?I think Ill go get lunch at the diner while you work, then come back.Can I bring you anything?Thats so sweet, she said, shaking her head.A couple of weeks ago she mightve said, Yeah, your younger brother!But now there was Troy.Im good.Ill get right on this.And dont forget to put in your order for Valentines Day roses early!Twenty minutes later the bouquet was finishedwhite, lavender, dark green and a little blue delphinium.She mightve put extra love in the bouquet just thinking about Al and Ray Anne, finding each other a bit later in life.Here shed been thinking that at twenty eight she was long overdue.When Al picked up the flowers they had a brief discussion about her need for help in the shop and he said Justin might be able to run some deliveries for her if he didnt have to pay for gas.Al promised to ask him.When she was alone, her personal cell rang and she answered.Hey there, flower girl.What are you doing?Troy asked.Ah, you do know how to use a phone.Im doing flowers.Beautiful flowers.How about you?Wanna go see the waves?Youre adorable, you know that?Im going to work for Cooper today and tomorrow, but Sunday is my day.And I go back to school on Monday.The flower shop is closed on Sundays.Sowhat should we do?This implies you want to have an adventure?Is that it?Lets take 101 south, check out the redwoods, drive into the Humboldt County mountains and maybe break bread with some illegal pot growers.We can have a picnic in the redwoods.We might have to have it in the carits going to be kind of cold but sunny.Except back in the trees, its dark and cold.How do you know its going to be chilly and sunny?My phone says its going to be sunny with a high of forty five degrees.What did we do before smartphones?Listened to the farm report.So, what do you say, flower girl?Date?In all the places shed been, from China to Charlotte, North Carolina, shed never been to the redwoods.I think that could be fun.We should pack extra clothes this time in case you have to show off again.Yeah, Ill take that under advisement.So, thats Sunday.Ill be at Coopers tonight.Its Friday night.A clear and cold Friday night so there will be people.There might be teenagers on the beach with their fires and shenanigans.If youre not tied up with the knight or the vampire or some loser Navy SEAL you could always come out.I could, but I should think about it.Ever since Ive had a fun coach some of my boyfriends have felt neglected.Ill be here till nine or ten, depending on people.Ill follow you home to make sure you get in safely.Because Im such a gentleman.Im sure you would.Let me see what I have to do.You do that, Gracie.No one had ever called her Gracie or flower girl.She loved it.She went to Coopers at almost eight, climbed up on a stool, her cheeks rosy and her fingers like icicles.It was a perfect night on the beach and there were three different fires surrounded by people, mostly young people.Hi, Troy said, smiling.He grabbed her hand.Whew.Cold.I walked over, she said.I might need a ride home.He smiled wider.Gotcha covered, he said, a twinkle in his eye.* * *  				Troy found lots of things he could do with Grace.She had never dated like this before.They drove down the coast to the redwoods, another day they went up the coast to Ecola Beach.They drove over to Eugene, and they drove up into the snowy Oregon mountains on a clear day.They went out to dinner twice and saw two movies.She went with him to a couple of high school basketball games and she closed the shop early one Saturday so they could drive to the university for a Ducks hockey game and they watched the Super Bowl togetherjust the two of them.They always ended the dates with more of that wonderful kissing.And with Troy always dangling the suggestion of an overnight.Grace kept pushing that idea back for now.But they made out every night.Every.Night.She really couldnt get enough.She found herself watching one of her favorite comfort chick flicks a lotThe Holiday.It was sweet, warm and fuzzy and she thought Troy looked very like Jude Law, except for the dimple.Grace was falling in love.Because Grace and Troy had been seen around with Iris so often, not much was made of the fact that Iris was now missingshe was a newlywed, after all.In fact, Troy and Grace ran into Iris and Seth at a high school basketball game and they seemed completely unsurprised to see Troy and Grace together.Then Iris popped into the shop one day after school.Shed been doing that quite regularly since Grace bought the shop.Iris liked to make her own flower arrangements and Grace gave them to her cheap.But, since shed been married, the visits had become rare.Grace already had the workroom cleaned up.I havent seen you in a while, Iris said.Are you anxious to close?Im in no great hurry, but no one will be by now.People who want flowers after five call aheadthey know Ill stay open for them to pick up if I can.This married businessI dont see that much of you anymore!Because now I go home and cook!If I dont, Seths mom will try to feed us every night and we cant have that.And I run errands and do laundry and get caught up on my homework before Seth comes home.You cook?Oh, God, has he filed for an annulment yet?Very funny.Im getting better, but sometimes he cooks.Have any flowers you can spare?I could use something cheery in the housethis weather can be a downer.Oh, I know exactly how to perk you up, she said, going into the cooler.She brought out a bottle of nice sauvignon blanc and two icy glasses she kept in there for just such an occasion.Ta da!You can pick your flowers while I get the corkscrew out of my desk.You are a good person, Grace, Iris said, approving of the wine and going into the cooler.Grace had the wine poured by the time Iris returned with a selection of flowers.Iris knew exactly where to get clippers, tape and a vase.She chose a very attractive oval vase to hold the bouquet.Ill return it, of course, Iris said.Grace passed her a glass of wine and lifted her own.To your new status, Mrs.Sileski.Thank you, Grace, she said.And should we toast a new relationship for you?You seem to be spending a lot of time with Troy.You left him lonely, Grace said with laughter in her voice.Oh, please dont tell me hes complaining that Im off the market!I thought we had that all taken care of!Hes not complaining, Iris, Grace said, taking a sip of her wine.But were just friends.Are you sure about that?Oh, yes.I asked, as a matter of fact.He said he needs someone to play with.And so do I, since you decided to get married!Theres no question about itTroy is fun.The fun coach, Grace said with a laugh, then she told Iris about the giant wave until both of them were laughing hysterically.Grace told Iris about some of their fun dates, but she didnt mention the more personal things, like all that wonderful kissing.After a glass of wine and a very beautiful bouquet were both done, Iris said it was time to get home.I bet Troys not just looking for fun, Iris said.Oh, I bet he is, Grace replied.But so am I.   				Grace locked the front door behind Iris, lost in thought.Why cant I let myself lean on Iris, give her the whole story?She might know how I should guard my heart because Im starting to fall in love and Troy isnt looking for love.Especially from me.She went back to the workroom, put the cork in the bottle and heard a light tapping at the back door.She looked up and smiled.Ah, I see youve been working hard, Troy said, pointing to the wine bottle.I was about to put this back in the cooler.Iris came by to make herself a bouquet, she said.You just missed her, she added, watching his expression.I saw her earlier, he said, picking up the glasses.Ill carry these up for you.You saw Iris?she asked.I see her at school every day, Grace.Want to go out for Chinese?I need a shower, she said.He reached for her.With the wineglasses in one hand he lifted her chin with the other and put a sweet kiss on her lips.Want to have a shower and Ill go get takeout?Or, if you need help with that shower...Ill manage, she said.So, youre hungry for Chinese?I am.And I want to ask you something.Want takeout or should I wait for you to have a shower?What do you want to ask me?Hold on.Im going to soften you up first.Is there a beer upstairs?There are two, she said.You go get dinner while I wash off the flowers.How long will it take you?Forty minutes, tops, he said.You okay to lock up?I do it every day, Troy.Just get going.This was what it was like to go steady, she thought.Just a couple of small things missing.Like, there was no future and he wasnt falling for her.Well, if nothing else, it was good dating practice.Troy was a great date, after all.Troys question was a simple but difficult one.The high school was having a Valentines Day dance and he wanted her to be his date.He was going to chaperone.Oh, God, thats almost the busiest day of the year for me!she exclaimed.How late do you stay open?Just till six, but I will be toast!I might be the worst date of your life.I can help you after work, help you clean up the shop and lock up.How about deliveries?I have a little part time help with that.Justin Russell, Als boy, is running some flowers for me before he goes to work at the station and hes going to be sure to help that dayI already told him its madness, but there could be good tips.Oh, Troy, what if Im no fun?And its a dance!I love to dance, but I might be knee walking tired.The next day is Sunday.You can sleep all day, he begged.Come on.I want to take the prettiest girl in Thunder Point to protect me from all the teenage girls.Really?You are the prettiest girl in  				No, she said.To protect you?Okay, I can handle them, he said with a laugh.Come with me, Gracie.Well dance.Put a sign on the shop door.Closing promptly at six on Valentines Day so make arrangements to get your flowers early or ask for delivery.The flower girl has a date.* * *  				Grace couldnt resist him.And while everything else felt casual, even the kissing part, this felt like the real deal.She asked if the right dress was going to be an issue.Not for you, he said.All the high school girls are competing with each other and trying to impress their dates.But you already have me.You can wear a barrel if you want to.And that was exactly the right thing to say, but she warned herself not to get too excited.At least not until he said something that sounded like were more than friends.Valentines Day met all of her expectations for craziness.Grace started early and made up as many bouquets as she could ahead of customers.The preordered roses had been ready the day before and by the end of the day every rose in the shop was gone, along with many other arrangements.Justin started deliveries early and continued right up till five oclock.Without him, shed have been lost.She tried to stay ahead of the mess but in the end she left a lot of itshe could give the shop a good cleaning on Sunday.She would have liked a little extra time to get dressed, but even rushed as she was she went to more trouble than usual with her hair and makeup.Grace wore her maid of honor dress, a sleek little black number and the only fancy dress in her arsenal.She usually pulled her hair back to keep it out of the way of the stalks and stems, but for this date she wore it down.It had grown long, past her shoulders.She even used the curling iron!Wow.You clean up good!Troy said when he picked her up.Grace expected to stand around a punch bowl with a bunch of teachers while the high school kids danced, but it was so much more than that.She was immediately enchanted.The high school gym was beautifully transformed with painted murals, twisted crepe paper streamers, snowy scenes, balloons, glitter balls, white and colored twinkle lights.The bleachers were pushed all the way back and the gym floor was circled with small round tables covered with long white tablecloths.Candles and little centerpieces decorated each table and there was a disc jockey at one end of the dance floor.To enter the gym the couples walked through a heart shaped arch decorated with hearts, clouds and snowflakes and their pictures were taken as they appeared.The chaperones hung back and chatted among themselves; only a couple had brought dates or spouses.As the music played, almost everyone danced, and refreshments were being served by volunteers.It was magical.Grace had never been to a high school dance.Shed never been to a high school!Iris was at the dance, of course.No date tonight?Grace asked.My date is patrolling the parking lot and looking for trouble.Im sure hell cruise through the dance once in a while.Are police necessary?Grace asked.Seth is a little overprotective.He likes to feel the kids are as safe as possible.And since I have to be here anyway...Iris was pulled away by another chaperone with a question.A young man approached Grace and Troy.Is this your girlfriend, Mr.Headly?Yes, this is Grace Dillon, Ms.Dillon to you.He gave a short bow.Would you like to dance, Ms.Dillon?he asked politely.Ah, I. ..ah...Its entirely up to you, Grace, Troy said.Jerome here wont put any moves on you because he knows Id have to kill him.Is it all right?she whispered to him.No slow dancing.Those are mine, Troy whispered back.Grace began what became a series of dances with a variety of young partners who were funny and charming and devilish.It was obvious they thought it was a real hoot to get Mr.Headlys girl on the dance floor.Whenever the music slowed Troy was instantly at her side, cutting in, holding her as closely as he dared at a high school function.It seemed as if all the slow dances were crooned by Michael Bubl, but she was surprised by the wide variety of music, from oldies to current rock.There was even a line dance performed to the strains of Aretha Franklin singing Chain of Fools.It took Grace about two seconds to learn it and Troy joined in.Am I dancing with students too much?she asked.I love watching you, he said.Theres one small problemI cant wait to get you alone.Are you dancing much?she asked.Very judiciously and as little as possible.Giggly high school girls are just not my thing.Besides, Im supposed to be keeping an eye on things, make sure the kids arent getting into trouble.What kind of trouble?Oh, you know, sneaking out to the parking lot to be too alone or to get a bottle or smoke a joint or get in a fight over something, like a girl.You know.That was the point, she didnt know.Really?Been a while since youve been rockin the high school dance?You could say that, she said.I thought this would be boring.I cant remember when Ive had so much fun.Just remember, dont fall in love with anyone because you leave the dance with me.He grinned at her.She noticed that Troy danced with Iris.Not a slow dance, but not so fast, either.He twirled her around and they laughed.She had no worries that Iris would invade her territory, none at all.But did Troy still wish that romance had worked?She forced herself to look away.When she looked back, Iris was talking to her husband.Troy was nowhere in sight.He was right behind her, claiming a dance.It was an old tune with a good beatKnock On Woodand Troy improvised, moving her two beats left, two beats right, a little twirl.Shed been very impressed by his dancing tonight.And it was sexy!Then the tune segued into a bebop beat and she noticed a few kids getting together for another line dance, but Troy pulled her back from the crowd, gave her hands a little shove and made a jitterbug move.Huh?he asked, lifting his eyebrows.She laughed at him.As long as you dont slide me between your legs or toss me onto your hips and over your shoulder.Aw, he said, then led her into a really good jitterbug, so good that kids stopped what they were doing to watch.This guy knows what hes doing, she thought.When the song ended, there were a few claps from the crowd.Grace heard a teenage girl say, Oh, God, why cant he just marry me!Five  				Four hours flew by and at almost midnight they were on their way to Graces place in Troys car.She was completely amazed by the variety of music, from oldies to current rock to hip hop and even country.And now that she thought about it, Troy was up to speed on all of those dances, even picking up the line dance steps quickly.Care to explain that dancing, Fred Astaire?she asked.He laughed.Short story.I dated a dance instructor.Not like Arthur Murrayshe taught little kids.Her sister was getting married and she wanted someone who could dance to go to the wedding with her, so she taught me a bunch of moves, including the tango.It was fun, to tell the truth.She broke up with me the day after the wedding.Aw, was your heart broken?A little bit, he said.I didnt think Id ever have fun dancing again.Well, you wowed em tonight.I even heard a marriage proposal.He laughed.Does that ever become...you know...difficult?
