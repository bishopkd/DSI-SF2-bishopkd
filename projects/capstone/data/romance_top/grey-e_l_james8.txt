This girl.Spill the beans.Ill have a glass of the Mendocino sauvignon blanc, I tell the hovering waiter.He nods and hurries off.So, not a cause for celebration?Elena takes a sip of her champagne, eyebrows raised.I dont know why youre making such a big deal of this.Im not making a big deal.Im curious.How old is she?What does she do?Shes just graduated.Oh.A little young for you?I arch a brow.Really?Youre going to go there?Elena laughs.How is Isaac?I ask with a smirk.She laughs again.Behaving.Her eyes sparkle with mischief.How boring for you.My voice is dry.She smiles, resigned.Hes a good pet.Shall we order?HALFWAY THROUGH THE CRAB chowder I put Elena out of her misery.Her name is Anastasia, she studied literature at WSU, and I met her when she came to interview me for the student newspaper.I gave the commencement address this year.Is she in the lifestyle?Not yet.But Im hopeful.Wow.Yeah.Shes escaped to Georgia to think it through.Thats a long way to go.I know.I look down at my chowder, wondering how Ana is and what shes doing; sleeping, I hopealone.When I raise my head Elena is studying me.Intently.I havent seen you like this, she says.What do you mean?Youre distracted.Thats not like you.Is it that obvious?She nods, her eyes softening.Obvious to me.I think shes turned your world upside down.I inhale sharply but hide the fact by raising my glass to my lips.Perceptive, Mrs.Lincoln.You think?I murmur after my sip.I think, she says, her eyes searching mine.Shes very disarming.Im sure thats novel.And I bet youre worrying about what shes doing in Georgia, what shes thinking.I know how you are.Yes.I want her to make the right decision.You should go and see her.What?Get on a plane.Really?If shes undecided.Go use your considerable charm.My snort is derisive.Christian, she scolds, when you want something badly enough, you go after it and you always win.You know that.Youre so negative about yourself.Drives me crazy.I sigh.Im not sure.The poor girl is probably bored to tears down there.Go.Youll get your answer.If its no, you can move on, if its yes, you can enjoy being yourself with her.Shes back Friday.Seize the day, my dear.She did say she missed me.There you go.Her eyes flash with certainty.Ill think about it.More champagne?Please, she says, and gives me a girlish grin.DRIVING BACK TO ESCALA, I contemplate Elenas advice.I could go to see Ana.She said shes missed methe jets available.Back home I read her latest e mail.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Suitable Dinner Companions  Date: May 31 2011 23:58 EST  To: Christian Grey  I hope you and your friend had a very pleasant dinner.Ana  P. S.  Was it Mrs.Robinson?Shit.This is the perfect excuse.This is going to need an answer in person.I buzz Taylor and tell him Im going to need Stephan and the Gulfstream in the morning.Very good, Mr.Grey.Where are you going?Were going to Savannah.Yes, sir.And theres a hint of amusement in his voice.WEDNESDAY, JUNE 1, 2011    * * *      Its been an interesting morning.We left Boeing Field at 11:30 PST; Stephan is flying with his first officer, Jill Beighley, and were due to arrive in Georgia at 19:30 EST.Bill has managed to arrange a meeting with the Savannah Brownfield Redevelopment Authority tomorrow, and I might be meeting them for a drink this evening.So if Anastasia is otherwise occupied, or doesnt want to see me, the journey wont be a complete waste of time.Yeah, yeah.Tell yourself that, Grey.Taylor has joined me for a light lunch and is now sorting through some paperwork, and I have a whole lot of reading to do.The only part of the equation Ive yet to solve is arranging to see Ana.Ill see how that goes once I arrive in Savannah; Im hoping some inspiration will come to me on the flight.I run my hand through my hair, and for the first time in a long while I lie back and doze as the G550 cruises at thirty thousand feet, bound for Savannah/Hilton Head International.The drone of the engines is soothing, and Im tired.So tired.That would be the nightmares, Grey.I dont know why they are worse at the moment.I close my eyes.This is how you will be with me.Do you understand?Yes, Maam.She runs a scarlet fingernail across my chest.I flinch and pull against the restraints as the darkness surfaces, burning my skin in the wake of her touch.But I dont make a sound.I dont dare.If you behave, Ill let you come.In my mouth.Fuck.But not yet.Weve got a long way to go before then.Her fingernail blazes down my skin, from the top of my sternum to my navel.I want to scream.She grabs my face, squeezing open my mouth, and kisses me.Her tongue demanding and wet.She brandishes the leather flogger.And I know this will be tough to endure.But I have my eye on the prize.Her fucking mouth.As the first lash falls and blisters across my skin, I welcome the pain and the endorphin rush.Mr.Grey, well be landing in twenty minutes, Taylor informs me, startling me awake.Are you okay, sir?Yeah.Sure.Thanks.Would you like some water?Please.I take a deep breath to bring my heart rate down, and Taylor passes me a glass of cold Evian.I take a welcome sip, glad that its just Taylor on board.Its not often I dream about my heady days with Mrs.Lincoln.Out of the window the sky is blue, the sparse clouds pinking with the early evening sun.The light up here is brilliant.Golden.Tranquil.The sinking sun reflecting off the cumulus clouds.For a moment I wish I were in my sailplane.I bet the thermals are fantastic up here.Yes!Thats what I should do: take Ana soaring.That would be more, wouldnt it?Taylor.Yes, sir.Id like to take Anastasia soaring in Georgiaat dawn tomorrow, if we can find somewhere to do that.But later would be fine, too.If its later Ill have to move my meeting.Ill get on it.Never mind the cost.Okay, sir.Thanks.Now I just have to tell Ana.THERE ARE TWO CARS waiting for us when the G550 comes to a halt on the tarmac near the Signature Flight Support terminal at the airport.Taylor and I step out of the plane and into the suffocating heat.Hell, its sticky, even at this time.The rep hands the keys for both cars to Taylor.I raise a brow at him.Ford Mustang?Its all I could find in Savannah at short notice.Taylor looks sheepish.At least its a red convertible.Though in this heat I hope it has AC.It should have everything, sir.Good.Thanks.I take the keys from him and, grabbing my messenger bag, leave him to unload the rest of the luggage from the plane into his Suburban.I shake hands with Stephan and Beighley and thank them for a smooth flight.In the Mustang, I cruise out of the airport and onward to downtown Savannah, listening to Bruce on my iPod through the car sound system.ANDREA HAS BOOKED ME into a suite at the Bohemian Hotel, which looks out over the Savannah River.Its dusk and the view from the balcony is impressive: the river is luminous, reflecting the graduated colors of the sky and the lights on the suspension bridge and the docks.The sky is incandescent, the colors shaded from deep purple to a rosy pink.Its almost as striking as twilight over the Sound.But I dont have time to stand here and admire the view.I set up my laptop, crank the air conditioning to full blast, and call Ros for an update.Why the sudden interest in Georgia, Christian?Its personal.She huffs down the phone.Since when have you let your personal life interfere with business?Since I met Anastasia Steele.I dont like Detroit, I snap.Okay.She backs off.I might meet the Savannah Brownfield liaison for a drink later, I add, attempting to placate her.Whatever, Christian.There are a few other things we need to talk about.The aid has arrived in Rotterdam.Do you still want to go ahead?Yes.Lets get it done.I made a commitment at the End Global Hunger launch.This needs to happen before I can face that committee again.Okay.Any further thoughts on the publishing acquisition?Im still undecided.I think SIP has some potential.Yeah.Maybe.Let me think about it for a while longer.Im seeing Marco to discuss the Lucas Woods situation.Okay, let me know how that goes.Call me later.Will do.Bye for now.Im avoiding the inevitable.I know this.But I decide it would be better to tackle Miss Steelevia e mail or phone, Ive yet to decide whichon a full stomach, so I order dinner.While Im waiting theres a text from Andrea letting me know my drinks appointment is off.Im fine with that.Ill see them tomorrow morning, provided Im not soaring with Ana.Before room service arrives, Taylor calls.Mr.Grey.Taylor.Are you checked in?Yes, sir.Your luggage will be on its way up in a moment.Great.The Brunswick Soaring Association has a glider free.Ive asked Andrea to fax through your flying credentials to them.Once the paperworks signed, were good to go.Great.Theyll do anytime from six a. m.   Even better.Have them ready from then.Send me the address.Will do.Theres a knock on the doormy luggage and room service have arrived simultaneously.The food smells delicious: fried green tomatoes and shrimp and grits.Well, Im in the South.While I eat I contemplate my strategy with Ana.I could pay a visit to her moms tomorrow at breakfast.Bring bagels.Then take her soaring.Thats probably the best plan.She hasnt been in touch all day, so I guess shes mad.I reread her last message once Ive finished dinner.What the hell has she got against Elena?She knows nothing about our relationship.What we had happened a long time ago and now were just friends.What right does Ana have to be mad?And if it wasnt for Elena, God knows what would have happened to me.Theres a knock on the door.Its Taylor.Good evening, sir.Happy with your room?Yes, its fine.I have the paperwork for the Brunswick Soaring Association here.I scan the hire agreement.It looks fine.I sign it and give it back to him.Ill drive myself tomorrow.Ill see you there?Yes, sir.Ill be there from six.Ill let you know if anything changes.Shall I unpack for you, sir?Please.Thanks.He nods and takes my suitcase into the bedroom.Im restless, and I need to get what Im going to say to Ana clear in my mind.I glance at my watch; its twenty past nine.Ive left this really late.Perhaps I should have a quick drink first.I leave Taylor to unpack and decide to check out the hotel bar before I speak to Ros again and write to Ana.The rooftop bar is crowded, but I find a seat at the end of the counter and order a beer.Its a hip, contemporary place, with moody lighting and a relaxed vibe.I scan the bar, avoiding eye contact with the two women sitting next to meand a movement captures my attention: a frustrated flip of glossy mahogany hair that catches and refracts the light.Its Ana.Fuck.Shes facing away from me, seated opposite a woman who could only be her mother.The resemblance is striking.What are the fucking odds?In all the gin jointsJesus.I watch them, transfixed.Theyre drinking cocktailsCosmopolitans, by the look of them.Her mother is stunning: like Ana, but older; she looks late thirties, with long, dark hair, and eyes that are Anas shade of blue.She has a bohemian vibe about hernot someone Id automatically associate with the golf club set.Perhaps shes dressed that way because shes out with her young, beautiful daughter.This is priceless.Seize the day, Grey.I fish my phone out of my jeans pocket.Its time to e mail Ana.This should be interesting.Ill test her moodand I get to watch.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Dinner Companions  Date: June 1 2011 21:40 EST  To: Anastasia Steele  Yes, I had dinner with Mrs.Robinson.She is just an old friend, Anastasia.Looking forward to seeing you again.I miss you.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.Her mother looks earnest; maybe shes concerned for her daughter, or maybe shes trying to extract information from her.Good luck, Mrs.Adams.And for a moment I wonder if theyre discussing me.Her mother stands; it looks like shes visiting the restroom.Ana checks her purse and pulls out her BlackBerry.Here we go  She begins to read, her shoulders hunched over, her fingers flexing and drumming on the table.She starts tapping furiously at the keys.I cant see her face, which is frustrating, but I dont think shes impressed with what shes just read.A moment later she abandons the phone on the table in what appears to be disgust.Thats not good.Her mother returns and signals one of the waiters for another round of drinks.I wonder how many theyve had.I check my phone, and sure enough, theres a response.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: OLD Dinner Companions  Date: June 1 2011 21:42 EST  To: Christian Grey  Shes not just an old friend.Has she found another adolescent boy to sink her teeth into?Did you get too old for her?Is that the reason your relationship finished?What the hell?My temper simmers as I read.Isaac is in his late twenties.Like me.How dare she?Is it the drink talking?Time to declare yourself, Grey.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Careful  Date: June 1 2011 21:45 EST  To: Anastasia Steele  This is not something I wish to discuss via e mail.How many Cosmopolitans are you going to drink?Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.She studies her phone, sits up suddenly, and looks around the room.Showtime, Grey.I deposit ten bucks on the counter and saunter over to them.Our eyes meet.She blanchesshocked, I thinkand I dont know how shell greet me, or how Ill contain my temper if she says anything else about Elena.She tucks her hair behind her ears with restless fingers.A sure sign that shes nervous.Hi, she says, her voice strained and high pitched.Hi.I lean down and kiss her cheek.She smells amazing, even if she does tense as my lips brush her skin.She looks lovely; shes caught some sun, and shes not wearing a bra.Her breasts are straining against the silky material of her top, but hidden by her long hair.For my eyes only, I hope.And even though shes mad, Im glad to see her.Ive missed her.Christian, this is my mother, Carla.Ana gestures to her mom.Mrs.Adams, I am delighted to meet you.Her moms eyes are all over me.Shit!Shes checking me out.Best ignore it, Grey.After a longer than necessary pause, she reaches out to shake my hand.Christian.What are you doing here?Ana asks, her tone accusatory.I came to see you, of course.Im staying in this hotel.Youre staying here?she squeaks.Yes.I cant quite believe it, either.Well, yesterday you said you wished I was here.Im trying to gauge her reaction.So far theres been: nervous fidgeting, tensing, an accusatory tone, and a strained voice.This is not going well.We aim to please, Miss Steele, I add, deadpan, hoping to put her in a good mood.Wont you join us for a drink, Christian?Mrs.Adams says graciously, and catches the eye of the waiter.I need something stronger than beer.Ill have a gin and tonic, I tell the waiter.Hendricks, if you have it, or Bombay Sapphire.Cucumber with the Hendricks, lime with the Bombay.And two more Cosmos, please, Ana adds, with an anxious look at me.Shes right to be anxious.I think shes had enough to drink already.Please pull up a chair, Christian.Thank you, Mrs.Adams.I do as she asks, and sit down beside Ana.So you just happen to be staying in the hotel where were drinking?Anas tone is tense.Or you just happen to be drinking in the hotel where Im staying.I just finished dinner, came in here, and saw you.I was distracted, thinking about your most recent e mailI give her a pointed lookand I glance up and there you are.Quite a coincidence, eh?Ana looks flustered.My mother and I were shopping this morning and on the beach this afternoon.We decided on a few cocktails this evening, she says hurriedly, as if she has to justify drinking in a bar with her mother.Did you buy that top?I ask.She really does look stunning.Her camisole is emerald green; Ive made the right choicesgem colorsfor the clothes Caroline Acton has selected for her.The color suits you.And youve caught some sun.You look lovely.Her cheeks color and her lips lift at my compliment.Well, I was going to pay you a visit tomorrow.But here you are.I take her hand, because I want to touch her, and I give it a gentle squeeze.Slowly I caress her knuckles with my thumb, and her breathing alters.Yes, Ana.Feel it.Dont be mad at me.Her eyes meet mine, and Im rewarded with her coy smile.I thought Id surprise you.But as ever, Anastasia, you surprise me by being here.I dont want to interrupt the time you have with your mother.Ill have a quick drink and then retire.I have work to do.I resist kissing her knuckles.I dont know what shes said to her mother about us, if anything.Christian, its lovely to meet you finally.Ana has spoken very fondly of you, Mrs.Adams says, with a charming smile.Really?I glance at Ana, whos blushing.Fondly, eh?This is good news.The waiter places my gin and tonic in front of me.Hendricks, sir.Thank you.He serves Ana and her mother fresh Cosmopolitans.How long are you in Georgia, Christian?her mom asks.Until Friday, Mrs.Adams.Will you have dinner with us tomorrow evening?And please, call me Carla.Id be delighted to, Carla.Excellent, she says.If you two will excuse me, I need to visit the restroom.Hasnt she just been to the restroom?I stand as she leaves, then sit down again to face the wrath of Miss Steele.I take her hand once more.So, youre mad at me for having dinner with an old friend.I kiss each knuckle.Yes.Shes curt.Is she jealous?Our sexual relationship was over long ago, Anastasia.I dont want anyone but you.Havent you worked that out yet?I think of her as a child molester, Christian.My scalp tingles in shock.Thats very judgmental.It wasnt like that.I release her hand in frustration.Oh, how was it, then?she snaps, sticking out her stubborn little chin.Is this the drink talking?She continues, She took advantage of a vulnerable fifteen year old boy.If you had been a fifteen year old girl and Mrs.Robinson was a Mr.Robinson, tempting you into a BDSM lifestyle, that would have been okay?If it was Mia, say?Oh, now shes being ridiculous.Ana, it wasnt like that.Her eyes flash.Shes really angry.Why?This has nothing to do with her.But I dont want a full blown argument here in the bar.I moderate my voice.Okay, it didnt feel like that to me.She was a force for good.What I needed.Good God, Id probably be dead by now if it wasnt for Elena.Im struggling to control my temper.Her brow furrows.I dont understand.Shut her down, Grey.Anastasia, your mother will be back shortly.Im not comfortable talking about this now.Later, maybe.If you dont want me here, I have a plane on standby at Hilton Head.I can go.Her expression changes to panic.Nodont go.Please.Im thrilled youre here, she adds quickly.Thrilled?You could have fooled me.Im just trying to make you understand, she says.Im angry that as soon as I left, you had dinner with her.Think about how you are when I get anywhere near Jos.Jos is a good friend.I have never had a sexual relationship with him.Whereas you and her  Youre jealous?How can I make her realize that Elena and I are friends?She has nothing to be jealous about.Clearly, Miss Steele is possessive.And it takes me a moment to realize that I like that.Yes, and angry about what she did to you, she continues.Anastasia, she helped me.Thats all Ill say about that.And as for your jealousy, put yourself in my shoes.I havent had to justify my actions to anyone in the last seven years.Not one person.I do as I wish, Anastasia.I like my autonomy.I didnt go and see Mrs.Robinson to upset you.I went because every now and then we have dinner.Shes a friend and a business partner.Her eyes widen.Oh.Didnt I mention that?Why would I mention that?Its nothing to do with her.Yes, were business partners.The sex is over between us.It has been for years.Why did your relationship end?Her husband found out.Can we talk about this some other timesomewhere more private?I dont think youll ever convince me that shes not some kind of pedophile.Fucking hell, Ana!Enough is enough!I dont think of her that way.I never have.Now thats enough!I growl.Did you love her?What?How are you two getting on?Carla is back.Ana forces a smile that makes my stomach churn.Fine, Mom.Did I love Elena?I take a sip of my drink.I fucking worshipped herbut did I love her?What a ridiculous question.I know nothing about romantic love.Thats the hearts and flowers shit she wants.The nineteenth century novels shes read have filled her head with nonsense.Ive had enough.Well, ladies, I shall leave you to your evening.Please, put these drinks on my tab, room number 612.Ill call you in the morning, Anastasia.Until tomorrow, Carla.Oh, its so nice to hear someone use your full name.Beautiful name for a beautiful girl.I shake Carlas hand, sincere about the compliment but not the smile on my face.Ana is quiet, imploring me with a look that I ignore.I kiss her cheek.Laters, baby, I murmur in her ear, then turn and walk through the bar and back down to my room.That girl provokes me like no one has before.And shes pissed at me; maybe she has PMS.She said her period was due this week.I burst into my room, slam the door, and head straight for the balcony.Its warm outside, and I take a deep breath, inhaling the pungent salty scent of the river.Night has fallen, and the river is inky black, like the skylike my mood.I didnt even get to discuss gliding tomorrow.I rest my hands on the balcony rail.The lights on the shore and the bridge improve the viewbut not my temperament.Why am I defending a relationship that began when Ana was still in fourth grade?Its none of her business.Yes, it was unconventional.But thats all.I run both hands through my hair.This trip isnt working out how I expected, at all.Perhaps it was a mistake to come down here.And to think it was Elena who encouraged me to make the trip.My phone buzzes, and I hope its Ana.Its Ros.Yes, I snap.Jeez, Christian.Am I interrupting something?No.Sorry.Whats up?Calm down, Grey.I thought Id update you on my conversation with Marco.But if now is a bad time, Ill call back in the morning.No, its fine.Theres a knock on the door.Hang on, Ros.I open it, expecting Taylor or someone from housekeeping to do turndownbut its Ana, standing in the corridor, looking bashful and beautiful.Shes here.Opening the door wider, I motion her in.All the redundancy packages concluded?I ask Ros, without taking my eyes off Ana.Yes.Ana walks into the room, watching me warily, her lips parted and moist, her eyes darkening.Whats this?A change of heart?I know that look.Its desire.She wants me.And I want her, too, especially after our spat in the bar.Why else would she be here?And the cost?I question Ros.Nearly two million.I whistle through my teeth.That was one expensive mistake.GEH gets to exploit the fiber optic division.Shes right.This was one of our goals.And Lucas?I ask.He reacted badly.I open the minibar and gesture to Ana to help herself.Leaving her there, I stroll into the bedroom.What did he do?He threw a fit.In the bathroom I turn on the faucet to run water into the huge sunken marble bath and add some scented bath oil.Theres room for six people in here.The majority of that money is for him, I remind Ros as I check the water temperature.And he has the buyout price for the company.He can always start again.I turn to leave, but as an afterthought I decide to light the various candles that are artfully arranged on the stone bench.Lit candles count as more, dont they?Well, hes threatening lawyers, though I dont understand why.Were bulletproof on this.Is that water I hear?Ros asks.Yeah, Im running a bath.Oh?Do you want me to go?No.Anything else?Yes, Fred wants to talk to you.Really?Hes gone over Barneys new design.As I wander back into the living room, I acknowledge Barneys design solution for the tablet and ask her to have Andrea send me the revised schematics.Ana has retrieved a bottle of orange juice.Is this your new management style: not being here?Ros asks.I laugh out loud, but mainly at Anas choice of beverage.Wise woman.And I tell Ros that I wont be back in the office until Friday.Are you seriously going to change your mind about Detroit?Theres a plot of land here that Im interested in.Is Bill aware of this?Ros is snippy.Yeah, get Bill to call.Will do.Did you get a drink with the Savannah people this evening?I tell her that Ill be seeing them tomorrow.Im more conciliatory and mindful of my tone, as this is a hot button for Ros.I want to see what Georgia will offer if we move in.I take a glass off the shelf, hand it to Ana, and point to the ice bucket.If their incentives are attractive enough, I continue, I think we should consider it, though Im not sure about the damned heat here.Ana pours her drink.Its late to be changing your mind on this, Christian.But it might give us some leverage with Detroit, Ros muses.I agree, Detroit has its advantages, too, and its cooler.But there are too many ghosts there for me.Get Bill to call.Tomorrow.Its late now and I have a visitor.Not too early, I warn.Ros says good night and I hang up.Ana eyes me with reserve as I drink her in.Her lush hair falls over small shoulders, framing her lovely, pensive face.You didnt answer my question, she murmurs.No.I didnt.No, you didnt answer my question, or no, you didnt love her?Shes not going to let this go.I lean against the wall and fold my arms so I dont pull her into them.What are you doing here, Anastasia?Ive just told you.Put her out of her misery, Grey.No.I didnt love her.Her shoulders relax and her face softens.Its what she wanted to hear.Youre quite the green eyed goddess, Anastasia.Who would have thought?But are you my green eyed goddess?Are you making fun of me, Mr.Grey?I wouldnt dare, I retort.Oh, I think you would, and I think you dooften.She smirks and sinks perfect teeth into her lip.Shes doing that on purpose.Please stop biting your lip.Youre in my room, I havent set eyes on you for nearly three days, and Ive flown a long way to see you.I need to know that were okay, the only way I know how.I want to fuck her, hard.My phone buzzes, but I switch it off without checking the caller.Whoever it is can wait.I step toward her.I want you, Anastasia.Now.And you want me.Thats why youre here.I really did want to know, she says.Well, now that you do, are you coming or going?I ask, standing in front of her.Coming, she says, her eyes on mine.Oh, I hope so.I stare down at her, marveling as her irises darken.She wants me.You were so mad at me, I whisper.Its still novel, dealing with her anger, taking her feelings into account.Yes.I dont remember anyone but my family ever being mad at me.I like it.Gently I touch her face with the tips of my fingers and run them down to her chin.She closes her eyes and angles her cheek to my touch.Leaning down, I run my nose along her naked shoulder, up to her ear, inhaling her sweet scent as desire floods my body.My fingers move to her nape and into her hair.We should talk, she whispers.Later.Theres so much I want to say.Me, too.I kiss the spot beneath her ear and tug her hair, pulling back her head to expose her throat.My teeth and lips graze her chin and down her neck as my body hums with need.I want you, I whisper, as I kiss the spot where her pulse beats beneath her skin.She moans and holds my arms.I tense for a moment, but the darkness stays dormant.Are you bleeding?I ask between kisses.She stills.Yes, she says.Do you have cramps?No.Her voice is quiet yet vehement with embarrassment.I stop kissing her and look down into her eyes.Why is she embarrassed?Its her body.Did you take your pill?Yes, she answers.Good.Lets go have a bath.In the over the top bathroom I release Anas hand.The atmosphere is hot and humid, steam gently rising above the foam.In this heat Im overdressed, my linen shirt and jeans sticking to my skin.Ana watches me, her skin dewy from the humidity.Do you have a hair tie?I ask.Her hair will start clinging to her face.She pulls out a hair elastic from her jeans pocket.Put your hair up, I tell her, and watch as she follows my command with quick, efficient grace.Good girl.No more arguing.A few strands escape from her ponytail, but she looks lovely.I turn off the faucet and, taking her hand, guide her into the other part of the bathroom, where a large gilded mirror hangs over two sinks set in marble.My eyes on hers in the mirror, I stand behind her and ask her to take off her sandals.Hastily she removes them and lets them drop to the floor.Lift up your arms, I whisper.Grasping the hem of her pretty top, I peel it off and over her head, freeing her breasts.Reaching around, I undo the top button and the zipper of her jeans.Im going to have you in the bathroom, Anastasia.Her eyes stray to my mouth and she licks her lips.Under the soft light her pupils gleam with excitement.Bending down, I drop tender kisses on her neck, hook my thumbs into the waistband of her jeans, and slowly peel them down over her fine ass, catching her panties in my hands on the way down.Kneeling behind her, I ease them down her legs, to her feet.Step out of your jeans, I order.Grabbing the edge of the sink, she obliges; now shes naked and Im face to face with her ass.I pop her jeans, panties, and top onto a white stool beneath the sink and contemplate all the things I could do to that ass.I notice a blue string between her legs; her tampon is still in place, so I settle for kissing and nipping her behind gently before standing up.Our eyes connect in the mirror once more and I splay my hand out over her smooth, flat belly.Look at you.You are so beautiful.See how you feel.Her breathing quickens as I take both her hands in mine and spread her fingers on her belly beneath my outstretched hands.Feel how soft your skin is, I whisper.Gently I guide her hands across her torso in a wide sweeping circle, then travel them up to her breasts.Feel how full your breasts are.I hold her hands beneath her breasts so shes cupping them.Gently I tease her nipples with my thumbs.She moans and bows her back, pressing her breasts into our conjoined hands.Trapping her nipples between her thumbs and mine, I tug gently again and again, and take pleasure watching them harden and lengthen in response.Like a certain part of my anatomy.She closes her eyes and wriggles against me, brushing her behind over my erection.She moans, her head against my shoulder.Thats right, baby, I murmur against her neck, enjoying her body coming alive beneath her touch.I guide her hands down her front to her hips, then in toward her pubic hair.I push my leg between hers and with my foot widen her stance as I guide her hands over her vulva, one hand at a time, over and over, pressing her fingers over her clitoris again and again.She groans and I watch her writhe against me in the mirror.Lord, shes a goddess.Look at you glow, Anastasia.I kiss and nip her neck and her shoulder, then I let go, leaving her hanging, and she opens her eyes as I step back.Carry on, I tell her, wondering what shell do.She falters for a moment, then rubs herself with one hand, but not nearly as enthusiastically.Oh, this will never do.Quickly I strip off my sticky shirt, jeans, and underwear, freeing my erection.Youd rather I do this?I ask, her eyes blazing at mine in the mirror.Oh yes, please, she says, a desperate, needy edge to her voice.I wrap my arms around her, my front against her back, my cock resting in the cleft of her fine, fine ass.I take her hands in mine once more, guiding them over her clitoris, one at a time, again and again, pressing, stroking, and arousing her.She whimpers as I suck and nip at her nape.Her legs begin to tremble.Abruptly I spin her around so shes facing me.I grasp her wrists in one of my hands, holding them behind her back, while I tug on her ponytail with the other, bringing her lips up to mine.I kiss her, consuming her mouth, reveling in the taste of her: orange juice and sweet, sweet Ana.Her breathing is harsh, like mine.When did you start your period, Anastasia?I want to fuck you without a condom.Yesterday, she breathes.Good.I step back and spin her around.Hold on to the sink, I command.Grasping her hips, I lift her and pull her backward so shes bent over.My hand glides down her ass to the blue string, and I tug out the tampon, which I toss in the toilet.She gasps, shocked, I think, but I grab my cock and slide into her quickly.My breath whistles between my teeth.Fuck.She feels good.So good.Skin against skin.I edge back, then sink into her once more, slowly, feeling every precious, slick inch of her.She groans and pushes against me.Oh yes, Ana.She tightens her grip on the marble as I pick up speed, and I grasp her hips, buildingbuilding, then hammering into her.Claiming her.Possessing her.Dont be jealous, Ana.I want only you.You.You.My fingers find her clitoris and I tease her, caress her, and stimulate her so that her legs begin to tremble once more.Thats right, baby, I murmur, my voice hoarse as I pound into her with a punishing I own you rhythm.Dont argue with me.Dont fight with me.Her legs stiffen as I grind into her and her body starts to quiver.Suddenly she cries out as her orgasm seizes her, taking me with her.Oh, Ana, I breathe as I let go, the world blurring, and I come inside her.Fuck.Oh, baby, will I ever get enough of you?I whisper as I sink onto her.Slowly I descend to the floor, bringing her with me and wrapping my arms around her.She sits, her head against my shoulder, still panting.Sweet Lord.Was it ever like this?I kiss her hair and she calms, her eyes closed, her breathing slowly returning to normal as I hold her.Were both sweaty and hot in a humid bathroom, but I dont want to be anywhere else.She shifts.Im bleeding, she says.Doesnt bother me.I dont want to let her go.I noticed.Her tone is dry.Does it bother you?It shouldnt.Its natural.Ive known only one woman who was squeamish about period sex, but I wouldnt take any of that crap from her.No, not at all.Ana peers up at me with clear blue eyes.Good.Lets have a bath.I free her and her brows knit for a moment while she stares at my chest.Her rosy face loses some of its color, and clouded eyes meet mine.What is it?I ask, alarmed by her expression.Your scars.Theyre not from chicken pox.No, theyre not.My tone is arctic.I do not want to talk about this.Standing, I hold my hand out to her and pull her to her feet.Her eyes are wide with horror.Itll be pity next.Dont look at me like that, I warn, and release her hand.I dont want your fucking pity, Ana.Dont go there.She studies her hand, suitably chastened, I hope.Did she do that?Her voice is almost inaudible.I scowl at her, saying nothing, as I try to contain my sudden rage.My silence compels her to look at me.She?I snarl.Mrs.Robinson?Ana pales at my tone.Shes not an animal, Anastasia.Of course she didnt.I dont understand why you feel you have to demonize her.She bows her head to avoid eye contact, walks briskly past me, and steps into the bath, sinking into the foam so I can no longer see her body.Looking up at me, her face contrite and open, she says, I just wonder what you would be like if you hadnt met her.If she hadnt introduced you to your, um, lifestyle.Damn it.Were back to Elena.I stalk toward the tub, slip into the water, and sit on the underwater shelf out of her reach.She watches me, waiting for an answer.The silence between us swells until all I can hear is the blood pumping through my ears.Fuck.She doesnt take her eyes off mine.Stand down, Ana!Nope.Its not going to happen.I shake my head.Impossible woman.I would probably have gone the way of my birth mother, had it not been for Mrs.Robinson.She tucks a damp tendril behind her ear, staying quiet.What can I say about Elena?I think about our relationship: Elena and me.Those heady years.The secrecy.The furtive couplings.The pain.The pleasure.The releaseThe order and calm she brought to my world.She loved me in a way I foundacceptable, I muse, almost to myself.Acceptable?Ana says in disbelief.Yes.Anas expression is expectant.She wants more.Shit.She distracted me from the destructive path I found myself following.My voice is low.Its very hard to grow up in a perfect family when youre not perfect.She inhales sharply.Hell.I hate talking about this.Does she still love you?No!I dont think so, not like that.I keep telling you, it was a long time ago.Its in the past.I couldnt change it even if I wanted to, which I dont.She saved me from myself.Ive never discussed this with anyone.Except Dr.Flynn, of course.And the only reason Im talking about this now, to you, is because I want you to trust me.I do trust you, she says, but I do want to know you better, and whenever I try to talk to you, you distract me.Theres so much I want to know.Oh, for pitys sake, Anastasia.What do you want to know?What do I have to do?She stares at her hands under the surface of the water.Im just trying to understand; youre such an enigma.Unlike anyone Ive met before.Im glad youre telling me what I want to know.Abruptly filled with resolve, she moves through the water to sit beside me, leaning against me so my skin sticks to hers.Please dont be angry with me, she says.I am not angry with you, Anastasia.Im just not used to this kind of talkingthis probing.I only have this with Dr.Flynn and with  Damn.With her?Mrs.Robinson?You talk to her, she says, her voice breathy and quiet.Yes, I do.What about?I turn to face her so suddenly that water sloshes out of the bath and onto the floor.Persistent, arent you?Life, the universebusiness.Anastasia, Mrs.R and I go way back.We can discuss anything.Me?she asks.Yes.Why do you talk about me?she asks, and now she sounds sullen.Ive never met anyone like you, Anastasia.What does that mean?Anyone who didnt just automatically sign your paperwork, no questions asked?I shake my head.No.I need advice.And you take advice from Mrs.Pedo?she snaps.Anastasiaenough, I almost shout.Or Ill put you across my knee.I have no sexual or romantic interest in her whatsoever.Shes a dear, valued friend and a business partner.Thats all.We have a past, a shared history, which was monumentally beneficial for me, though it fucked up her marriagebut that side of our relationship is over.She squares her shoulders.And your parents never found out?No, I growl.Ive told you this.She regards me warily, and I think she knows shes pushed me to my limit.Are you done?I ask.For now.Thank God for that.She wasnt lying when she told me there was much she wanted to say.But were not talking about what I want to talk about.I need to know where I stand.If our arrangement has a chance.Seize the day, Grey.Rightmy turn.You havent responded to my e mail.She tucks her hair behind her ear, then shakes her head.I was going to respond.But now youre here.Youd rather I wasnt?I hold my breath.No, Im pleased, she says.Good.Im pleased Im here, tooin spite of your interrogation.So, while its acceptable to grill me, you think you can claim some kind of diplomatic immunity just because Ive flown all this way to see you?Im not buying it, Miss Steele.I want to know how you feel.Her brows knit together.I told you.I am pleased youre here.Thank you for coming all this way.She sounds sincere.Its my pleasure.I lean down and kiss her, and she opens like a flower, offering and wanting more.I pull back.No.I think I want some answers first before we do any more.She sighs, her wary look returning.What do you want to know?Well, how you feel about our would be arrangement, for starters.She makes a moue with her mouth, as if her response will be unpalatable.Oh dear.I dont think I can do it for an extended period of time.A whole weekend being someone Im not.She looks down, away from me.Thats not a no.Whats more, I think shes right.Grasping her chin, I tilt her head up so I can see her eyes.No, I dont think you could, either.Are you laughing at me?Yes, but in a good way.I kiss her again.Youre not a great submissive.Her mouth drops open.Is she feigning offense?And then she laughs, a sweet, infectious laugh, and I know shes not offended.Maybe I dont have a good teacher.Good point well made, Miss Steele.I laugh, too.Maybe.Perhaps I should be stricter with you.I search her face.Was it that bad when I spanked you the first time?No, not really, she says, her cheeks flushing a little.Its more the idea of it?I ask, pressing her further.I suppose.Feeling pleasure when one isnt supposed to.I remember feeling the same.Takes a while to get your head around it.We are finally having the discussion.You can always use the safe word, Anastasia.Dont forget that.And, as long as you follow the rules, which fulfill a deep need in me for control and to keep you safe, then perhaps we can find a way forward.Why do you need to control me?Because it satisfies a need in me that wasnt met in my formative years.So its a form of therapy?Ive not thought of it like that, but yes, I suppose it is.She nods.But, heres the thingone moment you say dont defy me, the next you say you like to be challenged.Thats a very fine line to tread successfully.I can see that.But you seem to be doing fine so far.But at what personal cost?Im tied up in knots here.I like you tied up in knots.Thats not what I meant!She dashes her hand through the water, soaking me.Did you just splash me?Yes, she says.Oh, Miss Steele.I wrap my arm around her waist and tug her onto my lap, slopping water onto the floor once again.I think weve done enough talking for now.I hold her head between my hands and kiss her, my tongue teasing her lips apart, then delving into her mouth, dominating her.She runs her fingers through my hair, returning my kiss, twisting her tongue around mine.Angling her head with one hand, I shift her with the other so shes astride me.I pull back to take a breath.Her eyes are dark and carnal, her lust plain to see.I pull her wrists behind her back and grasp them in one hand.Im going to have you now, I declare, and I lift her so that my erection is poised beneath her.Ready?Yes, she breathes, and slowly I lower her onto me, watching her expression as I fill her.She moans and closes her eyes, thrusting her breasts forward into my face.Oh, sweet Jesus.I flex my hips, lifting her, burying myself even deeper inside her, and lean forward so our foreheads are touching.She feels so good.Please, let my hands go, she whispers.I open my eyes and see her mouth open as she drags air into her lungs.Dont touch me, I plead, and release her hands and grasp her hips.She grabs the edge of the bath and slowly starts to take me.Up.Then down.Oh so slowly.She opens her eyes to find mine on her face.Watching her.Riding me.Leaning down, she kisses me, her tongue invading my mouth.I close my eyes, reveling in the sensation.Oh yes, Ana.Her fingers are in my hair, tugging and pulling as she kisses me, her wet tongue entwining with mine as she moves.I hold her hips and start lifting her higher and faster, vaguely aware that water is cascading out of the bath.But I dont care.I want her.Like this.This beautiful woman who moans into my mouth.Up.Down.Up.Down.Over and over.Giving herself to me.Taking me.Ah.The pleasure catches in her throat.Thats right, baby, I whisper, as she quickens around me, then cries out as she explodes into her orgasm.I wrap my arms around her, embracing her, holding her tightly as I lose myself and come inside her.Ana, baby!I cry, and I know I never want to let her go.She kisses my ear.That was she breathes.Yeah.Holding her arms, I urge her back so I can study her.She looks sleepy and sated, and I imagine I must look the same.Thank you, I whisper.She looks confused.For not touching me, I clarify.Her face softens and she raises her hand.I tense.But she shakes her head and traces my lips with her finger.You said its a hard limit.I understand.And she leans forward and kisses me.The unfamiliar feeling surfaces, swelling in my chest, unnamed and dangerous.Lets get you to bed.Unless you have to go home?Im alarmed at where my emotions are going.No.I dont have to go.Good.Stay.I stand her up and climb out of the bath to fetch us both towels, and dismiss my unsettling feelings.I wrap her in a towel, drape one around my waist, and drop another on the floor in a vain attempt to clean up the water sloshed on the floor.Ana wanders over to the sinks as I drain the bath.Well.That was an interesting evening.And she was right.It was good to talk, though Im not sure weve resolved anything.Shes brushing her teeth with my toothbrush when I walk through the bathroom to the bedroom.It makes me smile.I pick up my phone and see that the missed call was from Taylor.I text him.Everything okay?Ill be leaving to go gliding at 6 a. m.   He responds immediately.Thats why I was calling.Weather looks good.Ill see you there.Good night, sir.Im taking Miss Steele soaring!My delight bubbles up into a broad grin that widens when she comes out of the bathroom wrapped in the towel.I need my purse, she says, looking a little shy.I think you left it in the living room.She scampers off to fetch it, and I brush my teeth, knowing that the toothbrush has just been in her mouth.In the bedroom I discard the towel, pull back the sheets, and lie down, waiting for Ana.Shes disappeared into the bathroom again and closed the door.Moments later she returns.She drops her towel and lies down beside me, naked except for a shy smile.We lie in bed facing each other, hugging our pillows.Do you want to sleep?I ask.I know we have to get up early, and its nearly eleven.No.Im not tired, she says, her eyes shining.What do you want to do?More sex?Talk.More talking.Oh Lord.I smile, resigned.About what?Stuff.What stuff?You.What about me?Whats your favorite film?I like her quick fire questions.Today, its The Piano.She beams back at me.Of course.Silly me.Such a sad, exciting score, which no doubt you can play.So many accomplishments, Mr.Grey.And the greatest one is you, Miss Steele.Her grin broadens.So I am number seventeen.Seventeen?Number of women youve, umhad sex with.Oh, shit.Not exactly.Her smile vanishes.You said fifteen.I was referring to the number of women in my playroom.I thought thats what you meant.You didnt ask me how many women Id had sex with.Oh.Her eyes widen.Vanilla?she asks.No.You are my one vanilla conquest.And for some strange reason, I feel insanely pleased with myself.I cant give you a number.I didnt put notches in the bedpost or anything.What are we talkingtens, hundredsthousands?Tens.Were in the tens, for pitys sake.I feign outrage.All submissives?Yes.Stop grinning at me, she says haughtily, trying and failing to stifle hers.I cant.Youre funny.And I feel a little light headed as we beam at each other.Funny peculiar or funny ha ha?A bit of both, I think.Thats damned cheeky, coming from you, she says.I kiss her nose to prepare her.This will shock you, Anastasia.Ready?Her eyes are wide and eager, full of delight.Tell her.All submissives in training, when I was training.There are places in and around Seattle that one can go and practice.Learn to do what I do.Oh, she exclaims.Yep, Ive paid for sex, Anastasia.Thats nothing to be proud of, she scolds me.And youre right, I am deeply shocked.And cross that I cant shock you.You wore my underwear.Did that shock you?Yes.You didnt wear your panties to meet my parents.Her delight is restored.Did that shock you?Yes.It seems I can only shock you in the underwear department.You told me you were a virgin.Thats the biggest shock Ive ever had.Yes, your face was a picture, a Kodak moment.She giggles, and her face lights up.You let me work you over with a riding crop.Im grinning like the fucking Cheshire cat.When have I ever stretched out naked beside a woman and just talked?Did that shock you?Yep.Well, I may let you do it again.Oh, I do hope so, Miss Steele.This weekend?Okay, she says.Okay?Yes.Ill go to the Red Room of Pain again.You say my name.That shocks you?The fact that I like it shocks me.Christian, she whispers, and the sound of my name from her lips spreads warmth through my body.Ana.I want to do something tomorrow.What?A surprise.For you.She yawns.Enough.Shes tired.Am I boring you, Miss Steele?Never, she confesses.I lean across and give her a quick kiss.Sleep, I order, and switch off the bedside light.And a few moments later I hear her even breathing; shes fast asleep.I pull a sheet over her, roll onto my back, and stare up at the whirring ceiling fan.Well, talking isnt so bad.Today worked out after all.Thank you, Elena  And with a sated smile, I close my eyes.THURSDAY, JUNE 2, 2011    * * *      No.Dont leave me.The whispered words penetrate my slumber, and I stir and wake.What was that?I look around the room.Where the hell am I?Oh yes, Savannah.No.Please.Dont leave me.What?Its Ana.Im not going anywhere, I mutter, bemused.Turning, I prop myself up on my elbow.Shes huddled beside me and she looks like shes asleep.I wont leave you, she mumbles.My scalp prickles.Im very glad to hear that.She sighs.Ana?I whisper.But she doesnt react.Her eyes are closed.Shes fast asleep.She must be dreamingwhat is she dreaming about?Christian, she says.Yes, I respond automatically.But she says nothing; shes definitely asleep, but Ive never heard her talk in her sleep before.I watch her, fascinated.Her face is illuminated by ambient light from the living area.Her brow crinkles for a moment, as if an unpleasant thought is plaguing her, then its smooth once more.With her lips parted as she breathes, her face soft in sleep, shes beautiful.And she doesnt want me to go, and she wont leave me.The candor of her subconscious admission sweeps through me like a summer breeze, leaving warmth and hope in its wake.Shes not going to leave me.Well, you have your answer, Grey.I smile down at her.She seems to have settled and stopped talking.I check the time on the radio alarm: 4:57.Its time to get up anyway, and Im elated.Im going soaring.With Ana.I love soaring.I place a quick kiss on her temple, rise, and head into the main room of the suite, where I order breakfast and check the local weather report.Another hot day with high humidity.No rain.I shower quickly, dry myself, then gather Anas clothes from the bathroom and lay them out on a chair near the bed.As I pick up her panties I remember how my devious plan to confiscate her underwear backfired.Oh, Miss Steele.And after our first night together  Oh, by the way, Im wearing your underwear.And she yanks the waistband up, so I can see the words Polo and Ralph peeking over her jeans.I shake my head, and from the armoire I take a pair of my boxer briefs and deposit them on the chair.I like it when she wears my clothes.She mumbles again, and I think she said cage, but Im not sure.What the hell is that about?She doesnt stir, but remains blissfully asleep while I dress.As I pull on my T shirt theres a knock on the door.Breakfast has arrived: pastries, a coffee for me, and Twinings English Breakfast tea for Ana.Fortunately the hotel stocks her favorite blend.Its time to wake Miss Steele.Strawberry, she mutters, as I sit down beside her on the bed.Whats with the fruit?Anastasia, I summon her gently.I want more.I know you do, and so do I.  Come on, baby.I continue to coax her awake.She gripes.No.I want to touch you.Shit.Wake up.I lean down and gently tug her earlobe with my teeth.No.She screws her eyes tight.Wake up, baby.Oh no, she protests.Time to get up, baby.Im going to switch on the side light.I reach across and switch it on, bathing her in a pool of dim light.She squints.No, she whines.Her reluctance to wake is amusing and different.In my previous relationships a sleepy submissive could expect to be disciplined.I nuzzle her ear and whisper, I want to chase the dawn with you.I kiss her cheek, kiss each eyelid in turn, kiss the tip of her nose, and kiss her lips.Her eyes flicker open.Good morning, beautiful.And they close again.She grumbles, and I grin down at her.You are not a morning person.She opens one unfocused eye, studying me.I thought you wanted sex, she says, her relief obvious.I suppress my laugh.Anastasia, I always want sex with you.Its heartwarming to know that you feel the same.Of course I do, just not when its so late.She hugs her pillow.Its not late, its early.Come onup you go.Were going out.Ill take a rain check on the sex.I was having such a nice dream.She sighs, peering up at me.Dream about what?You.Her face warms.What was I doing this time?Trying to feed me strawberries, she says with a small voice.That accounts for her babbling.Dr.Flynn could have a field day with that.Upget dressed.Dont bother to shower, we can do that later.She protests but sits up, ignoring the sheet that slips down to her waist and exposes her body.My cock stirs.With her hair mussed, cascading over her shoulders and curling around her naked breasts, she looks gorgeous.Ignoring my arousal, I stand up to give her some room.What time is it?she asks, her voice sleepy.Five thirty in the morning.Feels like three a. m.   We dont have much time.I let you sleep as long as possible.Come.I want to drag her out of bed and dress her myself.I cant wait to get her airborne.Cant I have a shower?If you have a shower, Ill want one with you, and you and I know what will happen thenthe day will just go.Come.She gives me a patient look.What are we doing?Its a surprise.I told you.She shakes her head and beams, very much amused.Okay.She climbs out of bed, oblivious to her nudity, and notices her clothes on the chair.Im delighted that shes not her usual shy self; maybe its because shes sleepy.She slides on my underwear and gives me a broad smile.Ill give you some room now that youre up.Leaving her to dress, I wander back into the main room, sit down at the small dining table, and help myself to some coffee.She joins me a few minutes later.Eat, I order, motioning for her to take a seat.She stares at me, transfixed, her eyes glazed.Anastasia, I say, interrupting her daydream.Her eyelashes flutter as she comes back from wherever shes been.Ill have some tea.Can I take a croissant for later?she asks hopefully.Shes not going to eat.Dont rain on my parade, Anastasia.Ill eat later, when my stomachs woken up.About seven thirty, okay?Okay.I cant force her.She looks defiant and stubborn.I want to roll my eyes at you, she says.Oh, Ana, bring it on.By all means, do, and you will make my day.She looks up at the fire sprinkler on the ceiling.Well, a spanking would wake me up, I suppose, she says, as if shes weighing the option.Shes considering it?It doesnt work that way, Anastasia!On the other hand, I dont want you to be all hot and bothered; the climate here is warm enough.She gives me a saccharine smile.You are, as ever, challenging, Miss Steele.My voice is droll.Drink your tea.She sits down and takes a couple of sips.Drink up.We should go.Im keen to get on the roadits quite a drive.Where are we going?Youll see.Stop with the grinning, Grey.She pouts with frustration.Miss Steele, as ever, is curious.But all shes wearing is her camisole and jeans; shell be cold once were airborne.Finish your tea, I order, and leave the table.In the bedroom I rifle through the armoire and pull out a sweatshirt.This should do.I call the valet and tell him to bring the car out front.Im ready, she says as I return to the main room.Youll need this.I toss the sweatshirt to her as she gives me a bewildered look.Trust me.I plant a swift kiss on her lips.Taking her hand, I open the door to the suite and we head for the elevators.Theres a hotel employee standing thereBrian, according to his name tagalso waiting for the elevator.Good morning, he says, giving us both a cheerful salute as the doors open.I glance at Ana and smirk as we enter.No shenanigans in elevators this morning.She hides her smile and peers at the floor, her cheeks coloring.She knows exactly whats going through my mind.Brian wishes us a good day as we exit.Outside, the valet is waiting with the Mustang.Ana arches a brow, impressed by the GT500.Yeah, its a fun drive, even if its only a Mustang.You know, sometimes its great being me, I tease her, and with a polite bow I open her door.Where are we going?Youll see.I get behind the wheel and ease the car into drive.At the stoplight I quickly program the address of the airfield into the GPS.It directs us out of Savannah toward I 95.I switch on my iPod via the steering wheel, and the car is filled with a sublime melody.Whats this?Ana asks.Its from La Traviata.An opera by Verdi.La Traviata?Ive heard of that.I cant think where.What does it mean?I give her a knowing look.Well, literally, the woman led astray.Its based on Alexandre Dumass book La Dame aux Camlias.Ah.Ive read it.I thought you might have.The doomed courtesan, she recounts, her voice tinged with melancholy.Hmm, its a depressing story, she says.Too depressing?We cant have that, Miss Steele, especially when Im in such a good mood.Do you want to choose some music?This is on my iPod.I tap the navigation screen and bring up the playlist.You choose, I offer, wondering if shell like anything I have in iTunes.She studies the list and scrolls through it, concentrating hard.She taps on a song, and Verdis dulcet strings are replaced by a pounding beat and Britney Spears.Toxic, eh?I observe, with wry humor.Is she trying to tell me something?Is she referring to me?I dont know what you mean, she says innocently.Does she think I should wear a warning?Miss Steele wants to play games.So be it.I turn the music down a tad.Its a little early for this remix, and for the reminder.Sir, this submissive respectfully requests Masters iPod.I glance away from the spreadsheet Im reading and study her as she kneels beside me, her eyes cast down.Shes been exceptional this weekend.How can I refuse?Sure, Leila, take it.I think its in the dock.Thank you, Master, she says, and stands with her usual grace, without looking at me.Good girl.And wearing only red high heels, she teeters over to the iPod dock and collects her reward.I didnt put that song on my iPod, I tell her breezily, and floor the gas, throwing us both into the back of our seats, but I hear Anas small, exasperated huff above the roar of the engine.As Britney continues at her sultry best, Ana drums her fingers on her thigh, radiating disquiet as she stares out the car window.The Mustang eats up the miles on the freeway; theres no traffic, and dawns first light is chasing us down I 95.Ana sighs as Damien Rice begins.Put her out of her misery, Grey.And I dont know if its my good mood, our talk last night, or the fact that Im about to go soaringbut I want to tell her who put the song on the iPod.It was Leila.Leila?An ex, who put the song on my iPod.One of the fifteen?She turns her full attention to me, hungry for information.Yes.What happened to her?We finished.Why?She wanted more.And you didnt?I glance at her and shake my head.Ive never wanted more, until I met you.She rewards me with her bashful smile.Yes, Ana.Its not just you who wants more.What happened to the other fourteen?she asks.You want a list?Divorced, beheaded, died?Youre not Henry the Eighth, she scolds me.Okay.In no particular order, Ive only had long term relationships with four women, apart from Elena.Elena?Mrs.Robinson to you.She pauses for a moment, and I know shes scrutinizing me.I keep my eyes on the road.What happened to the four?she asks.So inquisitive, so eager for information, Miss Steele, I tease.Oh, Mr.When Is Your Period Due?Anastasia, a man needs to know these things.Does he?I do.Why?Because I dont want you to get pregnant.Neither do I.  Well, not for a few years yet, she says a little wistfully.Of course, that would be with someone elsethe thought is disquietingShes mine.So the other four, what happened?she persists.One met someone else.The other three wantedmore.I wasnt in the market for more then.Why did I open this can of worms?And the others?Just didnt work out.She nods and stares out the window as Aaron Neville sings Tell It Like It Is.Where are we headed?she asks again.Were close now.An airfield.Were not going back to Seattle, are we?She sounds panicked.No, Anastasia.I chuckle at her reaction.Were going to indulge in my second favorite pastime.Second?Yep.I told you my favorite this morning.Her expression tells me shes completely perplexed.Indulging in you, Miss Steele.Thats got to be top of my list.Any way I can get you.She looks down at her lap, her lips twitching.Well, thats quite high up on my list of diverting, kinky priorities, too, she says.Im pleased to hear it.So, airfield?I beam at her.Soaring.Were going to chase the dawn, Anastasia.I take a left into the airfield and drive up to the Brunswick Soaring Association hangar, where I stop the car.You up for this?I ask.Youre flying?Yes.Her face glows with excitement.Yes, please!I love how fearless and enthusiastic she is with any new experience.Leaning over, I kiss her quickly.Another first, Miss Steele.Outside its cool but not cold, and the sky is lighter now, pearl and bright at the horizon.I walk around the car and open Anas door.With her hand in mine we make our way to the front of the hangar.Taylor is waiting there with a young bearded man in shorts and sandals.Mr.Grey, this is your tow pilot, Mr.Mark Benson, says Taylor.I release Ana so I can shake hands with Benson, who has a wild glint in his eye.Youve got a great morning for it, Mr.Grey, Benson says.The wind is at ten knots from the northeast, which means the convergence along the shore should keep you up for a wee while.Benson is British, with a firm handshake.Sounds great, I answer, and watch Ana as she shares a private joke with Taylor.Anastasia.Come.See you later, she says to Taylor.Ignoring her familiarity with my staff, I introduce her to Benson.Mr.Benson, this is my girlfriend, Anastasia Steele.Pleased to meet you, she says, and Benson gives her a bright smile as they shake hands.Likewise, he says.If youd like to follow me.Lead the way.I take Anas hand as we fall into step beside Benson.I have a Blank L23 set up and ready.Shes old school.But she handles well.Great.I learned to fly in a Blank.An L13, I tell Benson.Cant go wrong with a Blank.Im a big fan.He gives me a thumbs up.Though I prefer the L23 for the aerobatics.I nod in agreement.Youre hooked up to my Piper Pawnee, he continues.Ill take her up to three thousand feet, then set you guys free.That should give you some flying time.I hope so.The cloud cover looks promising.Its a bit early in the day for much lift.But you never know.Dave, my mate, will spot the wing.Hes in the jakes.Okay.I think jakes means restroom.Youve been flying long?Since my days in the RAF.But Ive been flying these tail draggers for five years now.Were on CTAF 122.3, so you know.Got it.The L23 looks to be in fine shape, and I make a note of her FAA registration: November.Papa.Three.Alpha.First we need to strap on your parachute.Benson reaches into the cockpit and pulls out a parachute for Ana.Ill do that, I offer, taking the bundle from Benson before he has a chance to put it or his hands on Ana.Ill fetch some ballast, Benson says with a cheery smile, and he heads toward the plane.You like strapping me into things, Ana says with a raised brow.Miss Steele, you have no idea.Here, step into the straps.I hold open the leg fastenings for her.Leaning over, she puts her hand on my shoulder.I stiffen instinctively, expecting the darkness to wake and choke me, but it doesnt.Its weird.I dont know how Im going to react where her touch is concerned.She lets go once the loops are around her thighs, and I hoist the shoulder straps up over her arms and fasten the parachute.Boy, she looks good in a harness.Briefly, I wonder how shed look spread eagled and hanging from the karabiners in the playroom, her mouth and her sex at my disposal.But alas, shes set suspension as a hard limit.There, youll do, I mutter, trying to banish the image from my mind.Do you have your hair tie from yesterday?You want me to put my hair up?she asks.Yes.She does as shes told.For a change.In you go.I steady her with my hand and she starts to climb into the back.No, front.The pilot sits in the back.But you wont be able to see.Ill see plenty.Ill see her enjoying herself, I hope.She climbs in and I bend over into the cockpit to fasten her into her seat, locking the harness and tightening the straps.Hmm, twice in one morning.I am a lucky man, I whisper, and kiss her.She beams up at me, her anticipation palpable.This wont take longtwenty, thirty minutes at most.Thermals arent great this time of the morning, but its so breathtaking up there at this hour.I hope youre not nervous.Excited, she says, still grinning.Good.I stroke her cheek with my index finger, then put on my own parachute and climb into the pilot seat.Benson comes back carrying ballast for Ana, and he checks her straps.Yep, thats secure.First time?he asks her.Yes.Youll love it.Thanks, Mr.Benson, Ana says.Call me Mark, he replies, fucking twinkling at her.I narrow my eyes at him.Okay?he asks me.Yep.Lets go, I say, impatient to be airborne and to get him away from my girl.Benson nods, shuts the canopy, and ambles over to the Piper.Off to the right I notice Dave, Bensons mate, has appeared, propping up the wingtip.Quickly I test the equipment: pedals (I hear the rudder move behind me); control stickside to side (a quick glance at the wings and I can see the ailerons moving); and control stickfront to back (I hear the elevator respond).Right.Were ready.Benson climbs into the Piper and almost immediately the single propeller starts up, loud and throaty in the morning quiet.A few moments later his plane is rolling forward, taking up the slack of the towrope, and were off.I balance the ailerons and the rudder as the Piper picks up speed, then I ease back on the control stick, and we sail into the air before Benson does.Here we go, baby, I shout to Ana as we gain height.Brunswick Traffic, Delta Victor, heading two seven zero.Its Benson on the radio.I ignore him as we climb higher and higher.The L23 handles well, and I watch Ana; her head whips from side to side as she tries to take in the view.I wish I could see her smile.We head west, the newborn sun behind us, and I note when we cross I 95.I love the serenity up here, away from everything and everyone, just me and the glider looking for liftand to think Ive never shared this experience with anyone before.The light is beautiful, lambent, all I had hoped it would befor Ana and for me.When I check the altimeter were nearing three thousand feet and coasting at 105 knots.Bensons voice crackles over the radio, informing me that were at three thousand feet and we can release.Affirmative.Release, I radio back, and pull the release knob.The Piper disappears and I roll us into a slow dip, until were heading southwest and riding the wind.Ana laughs out loud.Encouraged by her reaction, I continue to spiral, hoping we might find some convergence lift near the coastline or thermals beneath pale pink cloudsthe shallow cumulus might mean lift, even this early.Suddenly filled with a heady combination of mischief and joy, I shout at Ana, Hold on tight!And I take us into a full roll.She squeals, her hands shooting up and bracing against the canopy.When I right us once more shes laughing.It is the most gratifying response a man could want, and it makes me laugh, too.Im glad I didnt have breakfast!she shouts.Yes, in hindsight its good you didnt, because Im going to do that again.This time she holds on to the harness and stares directly down at the ground as shes suspended over it.She giggles, the noise mixing with the whistle of the wind.Beautiful, isnt it?I shout.Yes.I know we havent got long, as theres not much lift out herebut I dont care.Ana is enjoying herselfand so am I.   See the joystick in front of you?Grab hold.She tries to turn her head, but shes buckled in too tight.Go on, Anastasia.Grab it, I urge her.My joystick moves in my hands, and I know shes holding hers.Hold tight.Keep it steady.See the middle dial in front?Keep the needle dead center.We continue to fly in a straight line, the yaw string staying perpendicular to the canopy.Good girl.My Ana.Never backs down from a challenge.And for some bizarre reason I feel immensely proud of her.I am amazed you let me take control, she shouts.Youd be amazed what Id let you do, Miss Steele.Back to me now.In command of the joystick once more, I turn us in the direction of the airfield as we begin to lose altitude.I think I can land us there.I call over the radio to inform Benson and whoever might be listening that were going to land, and then I execute another circle to bring us closer to the ground.Hang on, baby.This can get bumpy.I dip again and bring the L23 into line with the runway as we descend toward the grass.We land with a bump, and I manage to keep both wings up until we reach a teeth jarring stop near the end of the runway.I unclip the canopy, open it, release my harness, and clamber out.I stretch my limbs, undo my parachute, and smile down at the rosy cheeked Miss Steele.How was that?I ask, reaching down to unbuckle her from the seat and the parachute.That was extraordinary.Thank you, she says, her eyes sparkling with joy.Was it more?I pray she cant hear the hope in my voice.Much more.She beams, and I feel ten feet tall.Come.I hold out my hand and help her out of the cockpit.As she jumps down I fold her into my arms, pulling her against me.Filled with adrenaline, my body responds immediately to her softness.In a nanosecond my hands are in her hair, and Im tipping her head back so I can kiss her.My hand skims down to the base of her spine, pressing her against my growing erection, and my mouth takes hers in a long, lingering, possessive kiss.I want her.Here.Now.On the grass.She responds in kind, her fingers twisting in my hair, tugging, begging for more, as she opens up for me like a morning glory.I break away for air and rationality.Not in a field!Benson and Taylor are nearby.Her eyes are luminous, pleading for more.Dont look at me like that, Ana.Breakfast, I whisper, before I do something Ill regret.Turning, I clasp her hand and walk back toward the car.What about the glider?she asks as she tries to keep up with me.Someone will take care of that.Its what I pay Taylor to do.Well eat now.Come.She bounces along beside me, brimming with happiness; I dont know if Ive ever seen her so buoyant.Her mood is infectious and I dont remember if Ive ever felt this upbeat, either.I cant help my big, fat grin as I hold open the car door for her.With Kings of Leon belting from the sound system I ease the Mustang out of the airfield toward I 95.As we cruise along the freeway, Anas BlackBerry starts beeping.Whats that?I ask.Alarm for my pill, she mutters.Good, well done.I hate condoms.From the sideways look I give her, I think shes rolling her eyes, but Im not sure.I like that you introduced me to Mark as your girlfriend, she says, changing the subject.Isnt that what you are?Am I?I thought you wanted a submissive.So did I, Anastasia, and I do.But Ive told you, I want more, too.Im very happy that you want more, she says.We aim to please, Miss Steele, I tease as I pull into the International House of Pancakesmy fathers guilty pleasure.IHOP?she says in disbelief.The Mustang rumbles to a stop.I hope youre hungry.I would never have pictured you here.My dad used to bring us to one of these whenever my mom went away to a medical conference.We shuffle into a booth, facing each other.It was our secret.I pick up a menu, watching Ana as she tucks her hair behind her ears and examines what IHOP has to offer for breakfast.She licks her lips in anticipation.And Im forced to suppress my physical reaction.I know what I want, I whisper, and wonder how she would feel visiting the restroom with me.Her eyes meet mine, and her pupils expand.I want what you want, she murmurs.As ever, Miss Steele does not back away from a challenge.Here?Are you sure, Ana?Her eyes dart around the quiet restaurant, then come to rest on me, darkening and full of carnal promise.Dont bite your lip, I warn.Much as Id like to, Im not going to fuck her in the restroom at IHOP.She deserves better than that, and frankly, so do I.  Not here, not now.If I cant have you here, dont tempt me.Were interrupted.Hi, my names Leandra.What can I get for youerfolksertoday, this mornin?Oh, God.I ignore the redheaded server.Anastasia?I prompt her.I told you, I want what you want.Hell.She might as well be addressing my groin.Shall I give you folks another minute to decide?the waitress asks.No.We know what we want.I cannot tear my gaze from Anas.Well have two portions of the original buttermilk pancakes with maple syrup and bacon on the side, two glasses of orange juice, one black coffee with skim milk, and one English Breakfast tea, if you have it.Ana smiles.Thank you, sir.Will that be all?the waitress exclaims, all breathy and embarrassed.Tearing my attention away from Ana, I dismiss the waitress with a look and she scurries away.You know, its really not fair, Ana says, her voice quiet as her finger traces a figure eight on the table.Whats not fair?How you disarm people.Women.Me.Do I disarm you?Im stunned.All the time.Its just looks, Anastasia.No, Christian, its much more than that.She has this the wrong way around, and once again I tell her how disarming I find her.Her brow furrows.Is that why youve changed your mind?Changed my mind?Yesabouterus?Have I changed my mind?I think Ive just relaxed my boundaries a little, thats all.I dont think Ive changed my mind per se.We just need to redefine our parameters, redraw our battle lines, if you will.We can make this work, Im sure.I want you submissive in my playroom.I will punish you if you digress from the rules.Other than thatwell, I think its all up for discussion.Those are my requirements, Miss Steele.
