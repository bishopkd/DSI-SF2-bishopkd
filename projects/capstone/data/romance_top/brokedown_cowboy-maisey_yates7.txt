You do a little too well taking care of me, he said, taking a bite of the sandwich.Lisss cheeks turned pink, and for some reason it made his own face feel hot.Is that even possible?She looked down and picked up her own sandwich.I mean, what are friends for?A friendship thats a two way street?Our friendship is a two way street.Its okay, Liss.I realize that none of my relationships have been for the past few years.He let out a long, slow breath.A few months ago, when Sadie left, Eli told me off.For being a drunk.For leaving all the responsibility to him.He wasnt wrong.I needed to hear it.And I obviously didnt correct everything right when he called me out, but I have been working on it.I know.She picked up a slice of peach and took a bite.You havent been hungover once since Ive moved in.Baby steps and all that shit, he said.Big man steps.The way I see it, Connor, its pretty easy to judge you from the outside looking in.But nobody else is in your boots.Sure.But even though there is no handbook for stuff like this, common sense says that if you dont keep moving, youre just going to die where youre at.And I havent been moving.Admitting that felt like a step forward.And steps forward were, after all, what he was aiming for.You have been lately, she said.She took a deep breath and looked away from him, staring out across the water.Connor examined her profile, the elegant line of her nose, the faint sprinkling of freckles across her skin.They werent very prominent, only visible if you were up close.His breath caught on the sudden thought that he was not up close to her often enough.He missed things, keeping his distance.Little details that he was soaking in now.Little details that suddenly seemed essential.As if sensing his careful study of her profile, Liss shifted, setting her plate down on the blanket beside them, moving away from him.Then she stood slowly.Then her hands went to the buttons on her dress, undoing the first four, letting the top fall down past her shoulders, then letting the garment fall down to her feet.Liss?A whole riot of questions went through his brain, so many that they got bottlenecked at his mouth, and he couldnt say another word.She bent at the waist and untied her boots, slipping them off and throwing them into the sand.Then she made quick work of her bra, pushing her panties down her hips, her legs, and leaving them on the ground with her dress.Then she reached up and took a couple of pins out of her hair, letting it fall loose down her back.And he still couldnt say anything.All he could do was sit there transfixed.Looking at the way her copper curls contrasted with her creamy skin.Admiring the easy slope of her waist that dipped first, then flared out to form the rounded curve of her hip, the dimples, low on her back, just above her perfect ass.She turned her head, her hair rippling with the motion, and looked at him, her eyes meeting his, her expression both fierce and timid at the same time.Then she looked back at the river, her eyes fixed straight ahead as she walked down to the bank and stepped into the water.She lifted one foot up fast, a reflexive response to the cold, he imagined.Then she put it back down, straightening her shoulders and wading in deeper, the water closing over her body.A slight shiver racked her frame, but she kept going.And he just watched.He didnt know what the hell was going on, but he didnt want to break the silence.For some reason, the idea of it seemed tantamount to swearing in church.And even he knew better than that.She raised her hands up over her head then slipped entirely beneath the surface, leaving nothing but a ripple where shed been standing.Connor stood, his eyes glued to the water.His heart pounding fast.Only a couple of seconds later she resurfaced on a shriek, shattering the air around them, just like shed shattered the surface of the water a moment before.She pushed her hair and droplets of water off her face.She was facing him now, smiling.I think you should join me, she called.You are insane.Maybe, she shouted.I told you I do not want to freeze my balls off today.She lifted a shoulder.Suit yourself.She went under the water again, and when she resurfaced she was farther away from shore, treading water.He hadnt paid all that much attention in school, but she brought to mind that story about sirens who lured men to their deaths.It hit him then that she was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.And he was standing on the shore, watching her, when he could be out there with her.He was holding himself back, as an observer, when he could touch all that beauty, taste it.Get out in that water and sink down deep in it.Along with that realization came the crushing weight of time.That it was passing.That he wasnt guaranteed a set amount.He was guaranteed this moment.If he wasnt too afraid to take it.And who knew exactly what shape it would take.Maybe it would just be a moment to recapture something he hadnt done since he was a teenager.Swimming naked, not caring if anyone saw.A last grasp at the kind of freedom age, grief and too much hard work had stolen from him.Maybe it would become something more.But he would never find out if he stood there on the bank, not moving.One thing he was sure of now more than ever: if he didnt move forward, he would die where he sat.He gripped the hem of his shirt and wrenched it over his head, his hands going to his belt buckle, working it through the loop as quickly as possible, then undoing his jeans.He shrugged them and his underwear down, kicking them to the side.Liss was watching him from out in the middle of the river.It wasnt anything she hadnt already seen.Still, he felt a little bit self conscious.Bare ass naked out in the broad daylight.He stepped into the water and bit back a curse.This is cold, he called.Yes, it is.But I dont think you have to worry about freezing your balls off, Connor Garrett.You dont?He crossed his arms over his chest, going in a little bit deeper.No, because Im not convinced you have any.He snorted and picked up the pace, sliding into swimming when he reached chest high water, gritting his teeth against the bone aching chill.He closed the distance between himself and Liss quickly.What are you, twelve?She looked at him, her expression impish.Do I look twelve?No.No, she did not.Okay, Im out here.Now what?Do I have to make all your decisions for you?she asked, a note of teasing in her voice, but a thread of truth winding through it.That wasnt fair, though.He had made a decision yesterday.A decision about not touching her again and getting their friendship back on neutral ground.But then, he supposed changing your mind came with the territory of making decisions.And if not, that was just too damn bad.He would claim inexperience on that score, since hed made so few in recent years.He moved closer to her, and her smile faded.No, he said, you dont have to make my decisions for me.He reached out and wrapped his arm around her waist, pulling her close to him, their legs tangling.She gasped, the shocked look on her face so satisfying it almost overrode the feel of her bare, slick body against his.Almost.He kicked a few times, bringing them closer to the opposite shore to where their picnic was set, bringing them to a point where he could touch ground again.He planted his feet as firmly as he could, avoiding any algae covered rock, tightening his hold on her.Her breasts were pressed firmly against his chest, and he was pretty sure he could stay like this for the next hour, and in spite of the cold be completely happy.What are we doing here?he asked.Because he felt like he needed to do the responsible thing and try to figure out just what she was expecting.If all she was expecting was for them to have some fun swimming naked together, he needed to know.Because his brain had shot straight past that and gone on to something else entirely.Damn open ended.Damn the torpedoes and everything else.Hed been open to a vague set of possibilities while standing there on the shore, but now that they were up close and personal, the options he was willing to consider had narrowed.A hell of a lot.Not nearly enough, she said, leaning forward and pressing a kiss to his neck, just beneath his jaw.The brief contact of her lips against his skin sent a shock wave of needs through his body.And he wondered how he had ever thought he would just go back to seeing her as a friend.To forgetting what had passed between them.To forgetting what it felt like to be naked with her, to be inside her.His intentions had been valiant.Or maybe they hadnt been.Maybe they had just been more self protection.Because this was...He didnt know what the hell this was.He knew what it couldnt be.He knew what it might mess up.But he was still here.With her.He moved his hands slowly up the line of her spine, the drag from the water keeping his movements slow, measured.They broke the surface of the water, and he moved his palms over her shoulders then up to cup her face, sliding his thumbs over her cheekbones, brushing away the droplets of water that clung to her skin, skimming over her freckles.He had never paid much attention to them before today, and now he found he wanted to count them, match the number of kisses to freckles.He leaned in, kissing her lightly on one cheek then on the other.Connor, she said, her voice thin, shaky.Liss, he said, because he didnt want there to be any question that he knew whom he was with.When he looked at her, she was all he saw.He tilted her face upward, leaned in and pressed a kiss to her lips.She wrapped her arms around him, holding on to him tightly, and she tilted her head backward, keeping her face just out of the water, watching her hair flow up around her like a copper halo.He could see her breasts just beneath the surface, pale, rosy tipped.He bent down and licked a drop of water from her neck, mimicking what he had wanted to do earlier with the peach juice.He turned his head and kissed her jaw, following the line until he came to her chin, then he moved to her mouth, deepening the kiss, tasting her.She parted her lips for him, sliding her tongue against his.And it didnt matter that the water was cold as freaking glacier melt; shrinkage was not a problem.He was so hard he thought he might explode the next time she flicked the tip of her tongue over his lips.He abandoned her mouth and straightened slightly, taking in the view of her body.He covered her breast with his palm, moving his thumb over her tightened nipple.She shivered beneath his touch.Or maybe it wasnt his touch so much as the water.Cold, baby?he asked.No, she said, her teeth chattering.Liar, he said.He slipped his hand behind her knees and lifted her, holding her close to his chest and walking until he couldnt touch bottom anymore.He swam across the short distance where the waterline went over his head, Liss kicking along with him.When his feet connected with solid ground again, he picked her up again, walking them both out of the river and onto dry land.He didnt set her down again until they got to the blanket.Then he knelt down next to her, watching the water drops roll over her skin.I want...He bent his head down and captured a drop with his tongue, following the trail over her breast, to one tightened peak.He drew it deep into his mouth, sucking hard.Liss arched against him, a hoarse cry escaping her lips.Are you going to finish your sentence?she asked, gasping for breath.I thought I would just lead by example, he said, his lips brushing against her skin as he spoke.He sipped more water from her body, moving to her other breast, tracing the outline of the tightened bud with the tip of his tongue.Youre beautiful, do you know that?Its never mattered to me that much.But Im happy to know that you think Im beautiful, she said, her voice trembling.He moved away from her slightly, giving himself a better view of her body.I do.Im not good with...poetry and shit.I never have been.I can show you.He leaned in and kissed her inner thigh, moving closer to where he really wanted to be, to the part of her he really wanted to taste.He liked this.He really liked it, and he had a lot of catching up to do.She said his name again, like a prayer, half a sob.Oh, yes, he liked this a lot.He put his hand between her thighs, her flesh hot beneath the cool water that clung to the curls that covered her sex.He slipped his fingers through her slick heat, pressing one deep inside her body.Then he leaned in, moving his tongue over her clit in time with the movement of his finger.She tasted like heaven.And hed been stuck in hell for far too long.He reached down and wrapped his hand around his cock, squeezing tight.He didnt have any protection with him, which meant this was not going to end quite the way he wanted it to.He tasted her deeper, urged on by the sounds of pleasure she was making.Connor...Connor, I need you.I need you inside me.He raised his head, breathing hard.No.Cant.It took every ounce of self control he possessed to refuse.He didnt want to refuse.But he wouldnt put them at risk for pregnancy.That was something he just couldnt deal with.Can, she said.I brought condoms.That brought him up short.Later.Later I will question you about that.That doesnt sound good, she said.He moved up her body and kissed her deeply on the lips.It might not be.But right now it doesnt matter.Right now?I just need to be inside you.Theyre in the picnic basket, she said.The picnic basket?It was dessert.He snorted, surprised that he could find anything amusing when he was this close to spontaneously combusting.He reached out and put his hand in the picnic basket, coming up victoriously with a handful of protection.Ambitious, he said.I have a healthy fantasy life, she said, her tone innocent.He tore open one of the packets and positioned the latex sheath at the head of his cock, drawing it down slowly over his length.I will never get tired of watching you do that, Liss said, her eyes on him with rapt attention.This?Really?So hot, she said.He watched her face, watched the way she looked at him, appraised him.No one had ever looked at him like that.Like he just might be the beautiful one.It made his chest feel strange.Tight.He positioned himself at the entrance of her body, leaning in and kissing her lips, testing her before thrusting deep inside her.Not as hot as this, he said, sliding his hand beneath her ass and drawing her hard against him.No, she said, holding tightly on to his shoulders, her fingernails digging into his skin.But he didnt mind.If anything, he welcomed it.Welcomed the little bit of pain to help defuse the intense pleasure that was threatening to overtake him.He wanted to make this good for her.He didnt want to make this a forgettable five minutes.He wanted it to be a lot more minutes than that.And he wanted them to be memorable.It would be for him.He knew it without a doubt.He flexed his hips, beginning to move inside her, establishing a steady rhythm that kept him on edge, without putting him over.She arched against him, meeting him thrust for thrust.The feeling of her, tight and hot around him, was too good.Too much.He looked down at her, their eyes clashing, a sharp shock of pleasure traveling down his spine and settling heart of the base of it.Looking at her like this, while buried deep inside her, in the light of day, made him feel more present than he had in years.Everything felt sharper, brighter, pleasure cutting into him like a knife.Liss arched up beneath him, her hold on him tightening, her name on his lips as she gave herself up to her own release.Her internal muscles tightened around him, and he couldnt hold back anymore.He buried his face in her neck and let go.Of everything around him, of everything in the past, of any worry in the future.And when he came back to himself, the only thing he was still holding on to was Liss.WELL, SHE HAD done it.And she hadnt even said a word.Shed been planning an entire speech in her head.Shed intended to list all of the reasons why she wanted to continue sleeping with him.Shed planned to tell him that she deserved to have what she wanted.In the end, staying silent and taking her clothes off had been a lot easier.And a hell of a lot more effective, she imagined.Go figure.She closed her eyes, relishing the warm weight of Connors body on hers.She was soaking wet from her time in the river, and they had managed to crumple the blanket so that she was half in the sand now, some of the grains sticking to her arms, but she didnt care.Because she felt too good everywhere else to worry about a little bit of sand.Sand was the least of her concerns.Sand was worth it.She was starting to think just about anything was worth it for sex with Connor.It was unaccountably satisfying just how well he lived up to the hype that her brain had built up around him.She felt...justified.Vindicated.Something.She felt like giving the part of herself that had been devoted to a secret Connor obsession for years a cookie and a pat on the back.You did well, little obsessive part of me.Obviously, you knew just how good it could be.The discovery that years of fantasy had been useless because he couldnt live up to her fictional imaginings would have been a hard one to swallow.Fortunately, that was not the case.Connor moved away from her, the sudden loss of his body heat leaving her shivering.He didnt look at her while he moved around the riverbank, collecting clothes.He dumped hers in a heap in front of her while hurrying to put on his own.Wheres the fire, Garrett?Hopefully not in my new barn, he said, his tone dry.You know what I mean.Im not too fond of the idea of getting caught out here bare ass naked, he said.Yeah, I guess that wouldnt be the best, she said, pushing herself into a sitting position and digging through the clothes pile for her bra.Does anyone come out here?I dont think so.But then, its not like I keep real close tabs on Eli and Kate.He pulled his jeans on, and Lisss stomach sank.It was disappointing to watch him cover his body back up.Like watching someone box up a beautiful gift, only moments after shed opened it.Well she set to work hooking her bra I thought maybe you knew something I didnt.Like, maybe the city council plays lawn darts here on Sunday afternoons.If they do, its secret lawn darts, and theyre illegally trespassing.Youre no fun, she said, finding her panties and pulling them on before straightening out her dress, shaking the sand out of it.I think if the city council was having a secret, illegal lawn dart game on your property, you would have to throw your support behind it.I would not.She shrugged her dress on and started doing the buttons up.Then youll be forever known as that cranky Connor Garrett who wouldnt let politicians engage in a friendly game of lawn darts down by the river.Honey, he said, pulling his T shirt over his head, pulling the hem down over his abs, a slow, reverse strip show that ended in disappointment instead of confetti and glitter, I am already known as that cranky Connor Garrett.No, you arent.He raised his brows.Yes, I am.Sad, cranky, widower Connor Garrett.Ill probably never be known as anything else.Unless you grow your beard longer and start weaving flowers into it like those weird hipster kids do.Then theyll probably call you Connor Garrett, sad, cranky, widower, flower beard.She did the last button on her dress and stood, brushing the last remnants of sand from the flimsy fabric.And then they were both dressed, and it was almost as if they hadnt just had sex on the blanket.Anyone just joining them might believe all they had done was eat turkey sandwiches and gone for an innocent swim.Except...What did you do with the condom?For the second time in as many days, she seemed to have made Connor Garrett blush.Picnic basket, he said quickly, his words running together.You put a used condom in my picnic basket?If I had buried it in the sand, like, a fox would have come and dug it up and dragged it somewhere.Probably deposited it at my feet while Im trying to work or something.Then Im going to have to explain why theres a used condom on my property.First of all, I dont think a fox is going to bring the used condom to your feet.Second of all, there are a lot of explanations for why a used condom might be on your property.Reason onepost city council lawn dart orgy.A duck might choke on it.His face was so comically serious that Liss could not hold back the laughter that was building in her chest.Okay, fair enough.Please tell me you did not put it in one of my bowls.He looked away.Connor, she said, shaking her head.Gross.It was that or endangering wildlife.Or foxes digging in the sand.Okay, Im going to let that go.You know, if I ever told anyone about this, there would definitely be some new adjectives assigned to you.No, he said, his expression still serious.I wont, she said, putting her hands up.This was weird, because they were giving each other a hard time, like usual.Talking about the absurd.Like the friends they had always been.Only, they were talking about the sex they had just had.Or rather, the aftermath.Connor had drawn a pretty clear line in the metaphorical sand yesterday.And today she felt as though it had been blurred irreparably.Down there in the actual sand.I suppose we better head back.Everyone is coming up for dinner.She cringed inwardly.Great.About as great as sticking your dick in a beehive.Ill take your word for it.At least he hadnt stumbled over that word.So he seemed to feel less awkward this time, as opposed to last time.Which meant more sex was making things better.She was going to ponder that.* * * DINNER HAD BEEN a lot less awkward than Connor had imagined it would be.Hed managed to, more or less, make eye contact with Liss when they spoke, rather than looking down at her breasts, and he had managed to make it through the meal without thinking too much about their encounter down by the river.Which was good, because the last thing he wanted to do was imagine what it had been like to lick water off Lisss bare skin while sitting across from his younger sister.Things had not devolved into awkward double entendre that felt specific to what he and Liss had been involved in, either, which was a nice change.Though the fact that Jack hadnt been there had probably helped with that.Now everyone was gone, leaving him with a stack of dirty dishes and the prospect of dealing with Liss one on one.Lucky, lucky him.He went straight to the sink and for the dishes.Which was unusual for him, but honestly, it seemed a lot less scary than trying to figure out what the hell was going on between him and his best friend.Because he had made a decision yesterday, and today he had violated that decision.And he couldnt even bring himself to feel that sorry about it.He felt a lot sorrier about the fact that he now had to deal with the fallout.Again.This felt a whole lot like history repeating itself.Again, he recalled something from school.Something about those who dont learn from history being doomed to repeat it.Apparently, his penis was a slow learner.And apparently also, something about Liss reminded him of school.Maybe because they had been friends since they were in school.This was so fucked up.And he felt as if he was due for something un fucked but he couldnt seem to manage that.Really, he shouldve just burned off his newfound sexual desire with some buckle bunny down at the bar.But no, hed opted to do it with his best friend.That wasnt strictly true.The decision had been taken out of his hands.Or rather, he had taken things into hand in the shower, and then they had gotten out of hand, and then he had kissed Liss, and everything had felt a little beyond his control.Or a lot.Right, like you werent totally complicit in the decision making down by the river today.He scowled and turned the tap on, waiting for the water to warm up before dumping the dishes into the empty sink.Yes, he was complicit and shit.But that didnt make it a good decision.Youre doing dishes?Lisss surprised voice came from behind him, jerking him out of his self pitying thoughts.He didnt turn around.They arent going to do themselves.No, I know that.Its just that usually they are more likely to do themselves than they are to have you do them.She cleared her throat.Incidentally, a lot like my orgasms.Except for lately.He whirled around.Thats how youre going to open up the conversation?There is no smooth, nonawkward way to do it.She had a point.Fine.Speak your piece.I disagreed with your unilateral no sex decree yesterday.I sort of figured that.Seeing as you stripped naked in front of me this afternoon.Yes, well, I was going to just talk to you about my feelings.What I was thinking.And then, all things considered, I decided I would just show you.But now I imagine we cant avoid the talking anymore.Whiskey colored eyes met his.We need to talk about this.You know, thats the perk of being with the same person from the time youre too young to care about anything enough to want to talk about it.What does that mean?When youre young, you dont ask a lot of questions.You dont worry about too much.You like being with someone, you want to get in their pants, thats pretty much love, and its a done deal.But then you get to be in your thirties.And you have marriages, and jobs, and bad credit and enough carry on baggage to ground a plane while they rebalance the load.He dragged a hand over his face and grimaced when he realized it was wet from the sink water.Now I want to get in your pants, and I want to be your best friend.And I want things to stay the same.And I need things to change.And nothing is simple.She cleared her throat.I guess so.But then, when youre young, Im not sure things are really simpler or if youre just missing the depth in everything.The possibilities.You see things big and simple.Like growing up here, I used to look around and see nothing but a lot of green and boring.And when it came to sex?You have friends, or you have lovers.They cant be the same.They dont even hang out in the same group.But I think the perk of being in your thirties is that you realize theres more than that.Now I dont look out there and see a simple blanket of green.There are so many shades of green in those trees, Connor.It can be deep or bright, cold or warm.Tinted with blue, covered in snow.I see so much more now.So it makes me wonder, why cant we be lovers right now and stay friends?Anything that sounds that good is doomed to fail, he said, realizing as the bitter words fell from his lips just how deeply he believed them.Liss bit her lip and closed the distance between them, wrapping her arms around his waist and resting her head on his chest.Connors throat felt tight all of a sudden.He raised his hand and kept it at the back of her head, holding her against him.That isnt true.There are good things.There will be more good things.She moved her hands over his back, the movement soothing, but also sensual.Which only added to the confusion.I know.There have been...a lot of good things.He took a deep breath.I mean, maybe there have been.I havent been looking for them.I. ..Everyone leaves.One way or another.And...every time I think about changing something, or meeting someone, or building my barn...He couldnt get the rest of the sentence out.Im still here, she said, her voice muffled against his chest.Im not going anywhere.He tightened his hold on her.What if I mess it up?She pulled away from him slightly, meeting his eyes.Connor, you are the best friend I have ever had.Youre also the best sex Ive ever had.How can that go wrong?Dont ask that.Its me were talking about here.Right.Cranky Connor Garrett.With the flower beard, the overactive fox related imagination and a very nice sized package.He snorted.I do not put flowers in my beard.Ill let you go ahead and keep the rest of it.See?This is working.He gripped her chin between his thumb and forefinger.And what about when it stops working?Well go back to the way things were before.But do you honestly think we can go back right now?Maybe later.Maybe after we...burn some of this off.In truth, standing with her right now, touching her as if he had every right, he could not imagine going back to a world where touching her wouldnt be appropriate.Touch had been missing from his life for a long time.Now that it had been restored, in all its glory, he was reluctant to let it go.Most especially when it came to Liss.He was trying to take forward motion and he supposed, all things considered, that meant it wasnt a good time to take a step backward with Liss.If it was even a step backward.Maybe sex would be a step backward.He couldnt tell anymore.But one of the options meant that he could keep having sex.And he was leaning heavily toward that option.Since he had stopped filling the deep dark hole in himself with alcohol, it seemed as if his body was trying to compensate by filling it with sex.Or, less complex, perhaps he was just a man.And beginning to remember that fact.Though he disliked reducing his attraction to Liss to something that basic.But then, the sex part could be basic, he supposed.His feelings werent.But they were separate.And that was the beauty in it.That was a whole new shade of green.If what Liss said was true, they could have this and then go right back to how things were before.He wasnt sure if he believed her.But he hadnt been the same for a long time.He hadnt wanted anything for a long time.But he wanted her.Whatever the hell that meant, wherever the hell it led.Youre being very quiet, Connor.Im not sure what to say.Something curmudgeonly?I didnt really think this was the time.Then...just tell me that you want me.Because I want you, and it feels very exposing to admit that.She shivered beneath his touch, her eyes wide, so very vulnerable.And touched something deep in him that he hadnt even known was still there.He tightened his hold on her.I doubt a lot of things, Liss.But one thing I dont doubt, and one thing you dont need to doubt, is that I want you.Simple as that.As simple and complicated as that.Its like you said, there are a lot of shades of green.Maybe there are a lot of shades of friendship, too.That was almost...profound.I have spent a lot of time inside my head the past few years.Something profound should come out of my mouth once in a while.Profound, not profane.He laughed.Oh, right.Never mind, then.Profane is a whole lot more likely.She extricated herself from his hold and took a step back.So what do we do now?Dishes?She frowned at his suggestion.Of course, the first answer he had given her off the cuff, and it was the wrong one.That seemed about right.Or something else, he added.Oh, you were about to do dishes.So that seems fair.This strange, domestically tinged conversation pushed a line of tension up his spine, inch by inch, tightening his muscles.It was too close to something hed experienced before.Too close to the kind of thing he wasnt ready for again.Not now, probably not ever.And hed love to avoid it, but he and Liss lived together, so avoiding it wasnt possible.Plus, she was Liss.He didnt hide from her.I guess that kind of leads into another conversation that is serious, and most definitely one I dont want to have.We dont have to have serious conversations, she said, turning toward the sink.Yes, we do.Because sex is serious.I mean, it is for me.Im not Jack.I never will be.Even if Im never ready for another serious relationship, Im not going to go out and sleep with a bunch of strangers.Taking my clothes off with someone...being in someone...it means something to me.Well, it means a lot to me, too.I just meant...I know.Youre trying to spare me.But I think to avoid as much awkwardness as possible, and hopefully any hurt feelings, we do need some ground rules.He wasnt sure how he was the one spearheading this conversation.But he felt as if it had to be done.They were living in the same house, after all, and he desperately needed to establish boundaries.For a lot of reasons, his sanity being chief among them.Okay, lay down your ground rules, she said, sweeping her hand across the room in a grand gesture.He had a big one, and she probably wouldnt like it.But standing here, in his kitchen, with Liss in her bare feet, he knew he had to say it.Sleeping together, holding each other all night, waking up tangled together...that was an intimacy he couldnt quite face.And it definitely crossed the boundaries of friendship into...something else.Lust was one thing, sex was another thing, but drooling onto your pillow right next to someone, waking up with morning wood and morning breath.Needing sex and also needing to pee...Yeah, that was marriage shit.That was the kind of thing he wanted to stay well away from.He cleared his throat.I think sleeping together is off the table.Her facial features seemed to lower half an inch at that statement.But you just said you wanted me.I do.But Im making a distinction right now between sleeping together and having sex with each other, he said, shifting uncomfortably.Because this was uncomfortable.On a lot of levels.Okay.I understand that, she said, but her voice, along with her frame, had shrunk slightly, and he could see that she didnt really understand.Liss, I think its important to make sure we keep things kind of...kept in their own corral.Her brow crinkled, and the corners of her mouth turned down.Mmm, cowboy sex wisdom.If you want cowboy sex, you have to put up with the wisdom.I get what youre saying.Boundaries.Exactly.Like, the property line of friendship extends to this point, and no further, and beyond that is the lover part.I think you have a breakdown in your metaphor.Probably.So when do we...How do we...There is no nonembarrassing way to ask you this.Is there anything to be embarrassed about between us anymore?Youve seen me hungover.Youve seen me naked.I had to admit to putting a condom in your picnic basket.Good point.But...its not like when youre in a relationship, then.Because when youre sleeping with someone, you just do it when you get in bed.So youre wondering when were supposed to...Have the sex.She finished his sentence for him.Though he had not been planning on finishing it quite that way.And, in spite of what he had just said, it was awkward.Damn awkward.When we...feel like it?He cleared his throat.I figure thats kind of a perk to being an adult, isnt it?But how do we know if we both feel like it?Im a man whos been celibate for three years.I think its safe to say I will always feel like it.After three years of not even wanting any, getting some was about all he thought about at the moment.When he wasnt thinking about trying to set boundaries, and trying to deal with the trauma associated with the fact that he only wanted to get some with the woman he considered his best friend.He cleared his throat.That does make things easier.Come to that, I dont really want to do dishes anymore.She arched a brow.Oh, yeah?What do you want to do?You.And that effectively ended the talking for the evening.And that was quite all right by him.LISS DIDNT USUALLY mind work.Work was a necessity, after all, and really, by and large she liked her job.But it was hard today.Because her head was full of Connor.Connor naked, Connors hands on her skin, Connors tongue on her...Her face heated.Yeah, that was not the best thing to be thinking about while she was sitting at her desk.Did you have a nice weekend?Jeanette asked from her position at her desk.Liss felt unaccountably guilty, and completely transparent.Yeah, she said, clearing her throat and trying to keep her blushing to a minimum.It was fine.Jeanette arched a brow.Just fine?Should it have been more than fine?Jeanette shrugged.Me myself, I prefer to have weekends entirely comprised of awesomesauce.But how you spend your time is up to you.I just didnt do very much.Stuck close to home.A little hiking.A little swimming.You went swimming?Its cold.Yeah, but refreshing.Youre also lying, Jeanette said, her eyes narrowed.Im lying?No, Im not lying.I went swimming.For what reason?Like, did you lose a valuable piece of jewelry in the bottom of the lake?Because that could be a good reason to go swimming right now.Otherwise I would just have to go ahead and say youre crazy.Except that you arent crazy, so that means you had a reason to go swimming.Good Lord, Jeanette, what are you, a detective on the side?Guilt.You reek of guilt, Foster.Jeanette narrowed her eyes further, tightening her lips.Who did you hook up with?It was official; Jeanette had to be some kind of wizard.Liss didnt even have a hickey.She had double checked this morning before she left the house.Why would you think I hooked up with someone?Because you question why I asked if you hooked up with someone, rather than just saying no.Fine.I was skinny dipping in the river.Thats why I swam.Not alone.She bit her lip.She was caught.There was no getting out of it now.She looked down.No, not alone.Good for you.You need to rebound from that asshole, and its better late than never.Great.So this is me, Liss said, spreading her arms wide, rebounding.I see that.Anyone I know?I took a blood oath not to reveal it.So you broke and started sleeping with your friend after you moved in with him, didnt you?Heat poured into Lisss face.No.Its just that...hes a prince.Of a small country.And he is engaged to marry someone else.So Im, like, his last fling.And if the media finds out, the entire town will be overrun.Right.So how is Mr.Cowboy in bed?You mean the prince.You want to know how the prince is in bed.Back in the early 90s I sort of wanted to know how Prince was in bed, but thats entirely different.Liss cleared her throat, moving toward a subject change.So thats settled.I had some sex.We dont need to make a federal case out of it.Oh, I have not even begun to make a case out of this.I want details.Is it weird?Ive never slept with a guy I was friends with.How did you guess all that?Liss was completely defeated now.You have no game face.You looked both satisfied and infinitely worried.And you have looked that way since you walked in this morning.Fine.I give.I slept with Connor.Its amazing.Its not as awkward as you would think.The fact that he has to wear clothes ever is a complete and total crime against humanity.Im really glad to have that theory on him confirmed.I think Im being an idiot, Liss said, covering her face and leaning forward, her elbows resting on the desk.Why, exactly?Because having sex that is both good and convenient seems nonidiotic to me.Because hes my best friend.And I feel...I feel a lot of things.Feelings are a bitch, Jeanette said.But you never know how things will end up.I pretty much do.Thats the thing.That is the primary problem with sleeping with your best friend while having feelings.When youre with a guy whos just like a boyfriend guy, theres mystery.Youre not really sure what makes him tick.You arent really sure what he wants.But I know Connor.I know what hes been through.I know what he isnt willing to go through again.And I even understand why.Yes, that does add another layer to it.But youre in deep already.Lets just face the facts.You were in deep before you ever touched him, am I right?Im transparent.A little bit, Liss.A little bit.I should put a stop to this, shouldnt I?I need to be strong.Oh, hell, no.Treat yourself.But he is not a treat.He is my friend.Jeanette laughed.Why cant he be both?Thats the question we both asked last night.And the conclusion was, we would try to be both.But we were weak.Weak and sex addled.If a guy can make you sex addled, stick with that for as long as you can.Thats your official advice?She smiled.I married it.Well, I will not be marrying him.If there was one thing Liss was absolutely certain of, it was that there was no serious future with Connor.And even fantasizing about it wasnt worth the risk.If she let herself go there...she could almost imagine the look of horror on his face if she told him she wanted more.So she wouldnt want more.Frankly, she was good at that.She just needed this time.To deal with this desire.The desire she had been fighting off for the past too many years.It wasnt going to fade away.That, she already knew.So she was trying this method.She ignored the slight ache in her chest.Then enjoy him while you have him.Why not?Why shouldnt she?She was going to treat herself, because she had been too long without a man in general, and had been never with Connor.And she had wanted Connor for ages, so she might as well enjoy it while she had it.The horse had already left the barn and all that.So there was no use getting precious about it now.Liss turned her chair sideways and stuck a stack of papers beneath the stapler, pressing it down hard.I will, Jeanette.I will.And I will continue enjoying him tonight.* * * CONNOR COULDNT AVOID going to town any longer.He did it as little as possible, unless he was going to the bar to hang out, but he needed to get some things for the ranch, so hed gotten his ass into his truck and made the drive.Fortunately, Kate was working at the Farm and Garden today, so that was one less person to deal with making sympathetic eyes at him.He had not been so lucky at the hardware store or the grocery store.But he had managed to be cordial.He had almost managed to smile.Which was all thanks to Liss, really.He smiled again on his way out of the store, thinking about her scolding him for his inability to have normal human responses.I just had one, he said quietly as he jerked open the door to his truck and set the plastic bag with his soda, cupcakes and condoms in the front seat.He was trying his hand at not buying hard liquor, and instead had come up with artificial flavors and sugar, which seemed good to him.Also, more protection, since he and Liss had burned through the nearly expired box at record speed.His phone buzzed in his pocket, and he took it out, flipping it open.He had the same cell phone for years and had never seen the point in upgrading.It still made calls, after all.Hello?It was Eli.Hey, you got some time?Youre in town, right?Yes, I am.Do you have time?I thought you were supposed to be protecting the citizens.Or at least stumping for votes.Im on a break.Meet me at The Grind.Eli hung up, and Connor stuffed his phone back into his pocket.Eli didnt ask much of him, so Connor figured he owed it to his brother to take a coffee break.He got in his truck and started the engine, making the quick drive through the main drag of town to one of the newer coffee places that was quickly becoming a regular hangout, even among the old, crusty codgers, who were highly resistant to anything new.Connor parked across the street, in front of one of the little tourist shops, just beneath the American and Oregon flags that were raised high and proud.He slammed the door shut and walked across the little two lane road and into the coffee shop.Eli was already sitting at a back table, his hand wrapped around a white cup with a lid.A latte, Connor assumed.He personally couldnt stomach coffee that had been diluted to that degree.There was a second cup on the table across from Eli, and Connor could only hope he had not ordered any froofy shit for him.It better be black, he said, pulling his chair out and taking a seat across from his brother, wrapping his hand around the cup on the table.It is.And strong enough to choke one of your bulls.You know me well.He took the lid off and watched steam rise up into the air.Okay.I have to show you something, and I have to ask you something.Im a little nervous, Eli, Im not going to lie.Eli reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a small black box, setting it in the center of the distressed wood table, and opening the lid, revealing a very large diamond ring.Connor looked up and stared at his brother then looked back down at the ring.Eli didnt say anything; he only looked at Connor with an overly fervent gaze.Im real flattered, Eli, but Im going to have to decline.You are such a dickhead.Did you just call me a dickhead, Sheriff?Deputy Sheriff, Eli said through gritted teeth.Oh, thats right, the election hasnt happened yet.I would think you might be a little nicer to your constituents.If you dont vote for me, Ill kill you in your sleep.Hows that?Coercion.I think thats coercion.Thats how it is.Be serious, Eli said.Okay.Im ready to be serious.Obviously, Im going to ask Sadie to marry me, Eli said.Am I insane?You would be insane not to.Eli cleared his throat.I dont mean am I insane to want to be with her.I want to spend the rest of my life with her, and Im completely certain about that.I have been for a while now.But...shell say yes, wont she?Probably.Though I would ask her before the election, because if you lose she might move on to greener pastures.I really should have asked Jack.No, you should not have asked Jack.Jack would tell you to run from commitment.Eli arched a dark brow.And you wont?No, Eli.Im not going to tell you to run from commitment.Marriage is hard.I was married for eight years, and there were a lot of times when it just seemed like work.I loved my wife.But that didnt make every problem magically disappear.Life still happens, all of the problems you have interacting with a person on a daily basis still happen.But if you love them enough, its worth it.
