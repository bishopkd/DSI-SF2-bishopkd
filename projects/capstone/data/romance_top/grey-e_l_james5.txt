Ana, baby, I whisper, holding out my hand, and like the good woman she is, she steps into my embrace.Shes discarded her graduation robe and wears a pale gray halter neck dress, exposing her flawless shoulders and back.Two dresses in two days.Shes spoiling me.Ethan, Mom and Dad wanted a word.Kavanagh hauls her brother away, leaving me with Ana and her father.So how long have you kids known each other?Mr.Steele asks.As I reach across to grasp Anas shoulder I gently trace my thumb across her naked back and she trembles in response.I tell him weve known each other for a couple of weeks.We met when Anastasia came to interview me for the student newspaper.Didnt know you worked on the student newspaper, Ana, Mr.Steele says.Kate was ill, she says.Ray Steele eyes his daughter and frowns.Fine speech you gave, Mr.Grey, he says.Thank you, sir.I understand that youre a keen fisherman.Indeed I am.Annie tell you that?She did.You fish?Theres a spark of curiosity in his brown eyes.Not as much as Id like to.My dad used to take my brother and me when we were kids.For him it was all about the steelheads.Guess I caught the bug from him.Ana listens for a moment, then excuses herself and moves off through the crowd to join the Kavanagh clan.Damn, she looks sensational in that dress.Oh?Where dyou fish?Ray Steeles question pulls me back into the conversation.I know its a test.All over the Pacific Northwest.You grew up in Washington?Yes, sir.My dad started us on the Wynoochee River.A smile tugs at Steeles mouth.Know it well.But his favorite is the Skagit.The U. S.  side.Hed get us out of bed at some ungodly hour of the morning and wed drive up there.Hes caught some mighty fine fish in that river.Thats some sweet water.Caught me some rod breakers in the Skagit.On the Canadian side, mind.Its one of the best stretches for wild steelheads.Give you a much better chase than those that are clipped, I say, my eyes on Ana.Couldnt agree more.My brothers caught a couple of wild monsters.Me, Im still waiting for the big one.One day, huh?I hope so.Ana is deep in a passionate discussion with Kavanagh.What are those two women talking about?You still get out much to fish?I refocus on Mr.Steele.Sure do.Annies friend Jos, his father, and I sneak out as often as we can.The fucking photographer!Again?Hes the guy that looks after the Beetle?Yeah, thats him.Great car, the Beetle.Im a fan of German made cars.Yeah?Annie loves that old car, but I guess its getting past its sell by date.Funny you should mention that.I was thinking of loaning her one of my company cars.Do you think shed go for it?I guess.That would be up to Annie, mind.Great.I take it Anas not into fishing.No.That girl takes after her mother.She couldnt stomach seeing the fish suffer.Or the worms, for that matter.Shes a gentle soul.He gives me a pointed look.Oh.A warning from Raymond Steele.I turn it into a joke.No wonder she wasnt keen on the cod we ate the other day.Steele chuckles.Shes fine with eating them.Ana has finished talking to the Kavanaghs and is heading our way.Hi, she says, beaming at us.Annie, where are the restrooms?Steele asks.She directs him to go outside the pavilion and to the left.See you in a moment.You kids enjoy yourselves, he says.She watches him go, then peers nervously up at me.But before she or I can say anything were interrupted by a photographer.She snaps a quick still of us together before hurrying away.So youve charmed my father as well?Ana says, her voice sweet and teasing.As well?Have I charmed you, Miss Steele?With my fingers I trace the rosy flush that appears on her cheek.Oh, I wish I knew what you were thinking, Anastasia.When my fingers reach her chin I tilt her head back so I can scrutinize her expression.She stills and stares back at me, her pupils darkening.Right now, she whispers, Im thinking, nice tie.I was expecting some kind of declaration; her response makes me laugh.Its recently become my favorite.She smiles.You look lovely, Anastasia.This halter neck dress suits you, and I get to stroke your back, feel your beautiful skin.Her lips part and her breath hitches, and I can feel the pull of the attraction between us.You know its going to be good, dont you, baby?My voice is low, betraying my longing.She closes her eyes, swallows, and takes a deep breath.When she opens them again, shes radiating anxiety.But I want more, she says.More?Fuck.What is this?She nods.More?I whisper again.Her lip is pliant beneath my thumb.You want hearts and flowers.Fuck.It will never work with her.How can it?I dont do romance.My hopes and dreams begin to crumble between us.Her eyes are wide, innocent, and beseeching.Damn.Shes so beguiling.Anastasia.Its not something I know.Me, neither.Of course; shes never had a relationship before.You dont know much.You know all the wrong things, she breathes.Wrong?Not to me.Try it, I plead.Please.Try it my way.Her gaze is intense as she searches my face, looking for clues.And for a moment Im lost in blue eyes that see everything.Okay, she whispers.What?Every hair on my body stands to attention.Okay.Ill try.Youre agreeing?I dont believe it.Subject to the soft limits, yes.Ill try.Sweet.Lord.I pull her into my arms and wrap her in my embrace, burying my face in her hair, inhaling her seductive scent.And I dont care that were in a crowded space.Its just her and me.Jesus, Ana, youre so unexpected.You take my breath away.A moment later Im aware that Raymond Steele has returned and is examining his watch to cover his embarrassment.Reluctantly, I release her.Im on top of the world.Deal done, Grey!Annie, should we get some lunch?Steele asks.Okay, she says with a shy smile directed at me.Would you like to join us, Christian?For a moment Im tempted, but Anas anxious glance in my direction says, Please, no.She wants alone time with her dad.I get it.Thank you, Mr.Steele, but I have plans.Its been great to meet you, sir.Try and control your stupid grin, Grey.Likewise, Steele repliessincerely, I think.Look after my baby girl.Oh, I fully intend to, I respond, shaking his hand.In ways that you cant possibly imagine, Mr.Steele.I take Anas hand and bring her knuckles to my lips.Later, Miss Steele, I murmur.Youve made me a happy, happy man.Steele gives me a brief nod, and taking his daughters elbow, leads her out of the reception.I stand dazed but brimming with hope.Shes agreed.Christian Grey?My joy is interrupted by Eamon Kavanagh, Katherines father.Eamon, how are you?We shake hands.TAYLOR COLLECTS ME AT 3:30.Good afternoon, sir, he says, opening my car door.En route he informs me that the Audi A3 has been delivered to The Heathman.Now I just have to give it to Ana.No doubt this will involve a discussion, and deep down I know it will be more than just a discussion.Then again, shes agreed to be my submissive, so maybe shell accept my gift without any fuss.Who are you kidding, Grey?A man can dream.I hope we can meet this evening; Ill give it to her as her graduation present.I call Andrea and tell her to put a WebEx breakfast meeting into my schedule tomorrow with Eamon Kavanagh and his associates in New York.Kavanagh is interested in upgrading his fiber optic network.I ask Andrea to have Ros and Fred on standby for the meeting, too.She relays some messagesnothing importantand reminds me I have to attend a charity function tomorrow evening in Seattle.Tonight will be my last night in Portland.Its almost Anas last night here, tooI contemplate calling her, but theres little point since she doesnt have her cell phone.And shes enjoying time with her dad.Staring out the car window as we drive toward The Heathman, I watch the good people of Portland go about their afternoon.At a stoplight theres a young couple arguing on the sidewalk over a spilled bag of groceries.Another couple, even younger, walks hand in hand past them, eyes locked and giggling.The girl leans up and whispers something in the ear of her tattooed beau.He laughs, leans down, and kisses her quickly, then opens the door to a coffee shop and steps aside to let her enter.Ana wants more.I sigh heavily and plow my fingers through my hair.They always want more.All of them.What can I do about that?The hand in hand couple strolling to the coffee shopAna and I did that.Weve eaten together at two restaurants, and it wasfun.Perhaps I could try.After all, shes giving me so much.I loosen my tie.Could I do more?BACK IN MY ROOM, I strip down, pull on my sweats, and head downstairs for a quick circuit in the gym.Enforced socializing has stretched the limits of my patience and I need to work off some excess energy.And I need to think about more.ONCE IM SHOWERED AND dressed and back in front of my laptop, Ros calls via WebEx to check in and we talk for forty minutes.We cover all of the items on her agenda, including the Taiwan proposal and Darfur.The cost of the airdrop is staggering, but its safer for all involved.I give her the go ahead.Now we have to wait for the shipment to arrive in Rotterdam.Im up to date on Kavanagh Media.I think Barney should be in on the meeting, too, Ros says.If you think so.Let Andrea know.Will do.How was the graduation ceremony?she asks.Good.Unexpected.Ana agreed to be mine.Unexpected good?Yes.From the screen Ros peers at me, intrigued, but I say nothing more.Andrea tells me youre back in Seattle tomorrow.Yes.I have a function to attend in the evening.Well, I hope your merger has been successful.I would say affirmative at this point, Ros.She smirks.Glad to hear it.I have another meeting, so if theres nothing else, Ill say good bye for now.Good bye.I log out of WebEx and into e mail, turning my attention to this evening.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Soft Limits  Date: May 26 2011 17:22  To: Anastasia Steele  What can I say that I havent already?Happy to talk these through anytime.You looked beautiful today.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.And to think this morning I was convinced it was all over between us.Jesus, Grey.You need to get a grip.Flynn would have a field day.Of course, part of the reason was she didnt have her phone.Perhaps she needs a more reliable form of communication.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: BlackBerry  Date: May 26 2011 17:36  To: J B Taylor  Cc: Andrea Ashton  Taylor  Please source a new BlackBerry for Anastasia Steele with her e mail preinstalled.Andrea can get the account details from Barney and get them to you.Please deliver it tomorrow either to her home or to Claytons.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.Once thats sent, I pick up the latest Forbes and start to read.By 6:30 theres no response from Ana, so I assume shes still entertaining the quiet and unassuming Ray Steele.Given that they arent related, theyre remarkably similar.I order the seafood risotto from room service and while I wait I read more of my book.GRACE CALLS WHILE IM reading.Christian, darling.Hello, Mother.Did Mia get in touch?Yes.I have her flight details.Ill pick her up.Great.Now, I hope youll stay for dinner on Saturday.Sure.And then on Sunday Elliot is bringing his friend Kate to dinner.Would you like to come?You could bring Anastasia.Thats what Kavanagh was talking about today.I play for time.Ill have to see if shes free.Let me know.It will be lovely to have all the family together again.I roll my eyes.If you say so, Mother.I do, darling.See you Saturday.She hangs up.Take Ana to meet my parents?How the hell do I get out of that?As I contemplate this predicament, an e mail arrives.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Soft Limits  Date: May 26 2011 19:23  To: Christian Grey  I can come over this evening to discuss if youd like.Ana  No, no baby.Not in that car.And my plans fall into place.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Soft Limits  Date: May 26 2011 19:27  To: Anastasia Steele  Ill come to you.I meant it when I said I wasnt happy about you driving that car.Ill be with you shortly.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.I print out another copy of the Soft Limits from the contract and her Issues e mail because Ive left my first copy in my jacket, which she still has in her possession.Then I call Taylor in his room.Im going to deliver the car to Anastasia.Can you pick me up from her placesay, nine thirty?Certainly, sir.Before I leave I stuff two condoms into the back pocket of my jeans.I might get lucky.THE A3 IS FUN to drive, though its got less torque than Im used to.I pull up outside a liquor store on the outskirts of Portland to buy some celebratory champagne.I forgo the Cristal and the Dom Prignon for a Bollinger, mostly because its the 1999 vintage, and chilled, but also because its pinksymbolic, I think with a smirk, as I hand my AmEx to the cashier.Ana is still wearing the stunning gray dress when she opens the door.I look forward to peeling it off her later.Hi, she says, her eyes large and luminous in her pale face.Hi.Come in.She seems shy and awkward.Why?Whats happened?If I may.I hold up the bottle of champagne.I thought wed celebrate your graduation.Nothing beats a good Bollinger.Interesting choice of words.Her voice is sardonic.Oh, I like your ready wit, Anastasia.There she ismy girl.We only have teacups.Weve packed all the glasses.Teacups?Sounds good to me.I watch her wander into the kitchen.Shes nervous and skittish.Perhaps because shes had a big day, or because shes agreed to my terms, or because shes here aloneI know Kavanagh is with her own family this evening; her father told me.I hope the champagne will help Ana relaxand talk.The room is empty, except for packing crates, the sofa, and the table.Theres a brown parcel on the table with a handwritten note attached.I agree to the conditions, Angel; because you know best what my punishment ought to be; onlyonlydont make it more than I can bear!Do you want saucers as well?she calls.Teacups will be fine, Anastasia, I respond, distracted.Shes wrapped up the booksthe first editions I sent her.Shes giving them back to me.She doesnt want them.This is why shes nervous.How the hell will she react to the car?Looking up, I see her standing there, watching me.And carefully she places the cups on the table.Thats for you.Her voice is small and strained.Hmm, I figured as much, I mutter.Very apt quote.I trace her handwriting with my finger.The letters are small and neat, and I wonder what a graphologist would make of them.I thought I was dUrberville, not Angel.You decided on the debasement.Of course its the perfect quote.My smile is ironic.Trust you to find something that resonates so appropriately.Its also a plea, she whispers.A plea?For me to go easy on you?She nods.To me these books were an investment, but for her I thought theyd mean something.I bought these for you.Its a small white lieas Ive replaced them.Ill go easier on you if you accept them.I keep my voice calm and quiet, masking my disappointment.Christian, I cant accept them, theyre just too much.Here we go, another battle of wills.Plus a change, plus cest la mme chose.You see, this is what I was talking about, you defying me.I want you to have them, and thats the end of the discussion.Its very simple.You dont have to think about this.As a submissive you would just be grateful for them.You just accept what I buy you because it pleases me for you to do so.I wasnt a submissive when you bought them for me, she says quietly.As ever, she has an answer for everything.Nobut youve agreed, Anastasia.Is she reneging on our deal?God, this girl has me on a roller coaster.So they are mine to do with as I wish?Yes.I thought you loved Hardy?In that case, Id like to give them to a charityone working in Darfur, since that seems to be close to your heart.They can auction them.If thats what you want to do.Im not going to stop you.You can burn them, for all I care  Her pale face colors.Ill think about it, she mutters.Dont think, Anastasia.Not about this.Keep them, please.Theyre for you, because your passion is books.Youve told me more than once.Enjoy them.Placing the champagne on the table, I stand in front of her and cup her chin, tipping back her head so my eyes are on hers.I will buy you lots of things, Anastasia.Get used to it.I can afford it.Im a very wealthy man.I kiss her quickly.Please, I add, and release her.It makes me feel cheap, she says.It shouldnt.Youre overthinking it.Dont place some vague moral judgment on yourself based on what others might think.Dont waste your energy.Its only because you have reservations about our arrangement; thats perfectly natural.You dont know what youre getting yourself into.Anxiety is etched all over her lovely face.Hey, stop this.There is nothing about you that is cheap, Anastasia.I wont have you thinking that.I just sent you some old books that I thought might mean something to you, thats all.She blinks a couple of times and stares at the package, obviously conflicted.Keep them, Anatheyre for you.Have some champagne, I whisper, and she rewards me with a small smile.Thats better.I open the champagne and fill the dainty teacups shes placed in front of me.Its pink.Shes surprised, and I havent the heart to tell her why I chose pink.Bollinger La Grande Anne Ros 1999an excellent vintage.In teacups.She grins.Its infectious.In teacups.Congratulations on your degree, Anastasia.We touch cups, and I drink.It tastes good, as I knew it would.Thank you.She raises the cup to her lips and takes a quick sip.Shall we go through the soft limits?Always so eager.Taking her hand, I lead her to the sofaone of the only remaining pieces of furniture in the living roomand we sit, surrounded by boxes.Your stepfathers a very taciturn man.You managed to get him eating out of your hand.I chuckle.Only because I know how to fish.How did you know he liked fishing?You told me.When we went for coffee.Oh, did I?She takes another sip and closes her eyes, savoring the taste.Opening them again, she asks, Did you try the wine at the reception?Yes.It was foul.I grimace.I thought of you when I tasted it.How did you get to be so knowledgeable about wine?Im not knowledgeable, Anastasia, I just know what I like.And I like you.Some more?I nod toward the bottle on the table.Please.I fetch the champagne and refill her cup.She regards me suspiciously.She knows Im plying her with alcohol.This place looks pretty bare.Are you ready for the move?I ask, to distract her.More or less.Are you working tomorrow?Yes, my last day at Claytons.Id help you move, but I promised to meet my sister at the airport.Mia arrives from Paris early on Saturday.Im heading back to Seattle tomorrow, but I hear Elliot is giving you two a hand.Yes, Kate is very excited about that.Im surprised Elliot is still interested in Anas friend; its not his usual MO.Yes, Kate and Elliot, who would have thought?Their liaison makes matters complicated.My mothers voice rings in my head: You could bring Anastasia.So what are you doing about work in Seattle?I ask.I have a couple of interviews for intern places.You were going to tell me this when?Um Im telling you now, she says.Where?I ask, hiding my frustration.A couple of publishing houses.Is that what you want to do, something in publishing?She nods, but shes still not forthcoming.Well?I prompt.Well, what?Dont be obtuse, Anastasia.Which publishing houses?I mentally run through all the publishing houses I know of in Seattle.There are fourI think.Just small ones, she says evasively.Why dont you want me to know?Undue influence, she says.What does that mean?I frown.Oh, now youre being obtuse, she says, her eyes twinkling with mirth.Obtuse?I laugh.Me?God, youre challenging.Drink up, lets talk about these limits.Her eyelashes flutter and she takes a shaky breath, then drains her cup.Shes really nervous about this.I offer her more liquid courage.Please, she responds.Bottle in hand, I pause.Have you eaten anything?Yes.I had a three course meal with Ray, she says, exasperated, and rolls her eyes.Oh, Ana.At last I can do something about this disrespectful habit.Leaning forward, I take hold of her chin and glare at her.Next time you roll your eyes at me, I will take you across my knee.Oh.She looks a little shocked, but a little intrigued, too.Oh.So it begins, Anastasia.With a wolfish grin I fill her teacup, and she takes a long sip.Got your attention now, havent I?She nods.Answer me.Yes, youve got my attention, she says with a contrite smile.Good.I fish out her e mail, and Appendix 3 of my contract, from my jacket.So, sexual acts.Weve done most of this.She shuffles closer to me and we read down the list.APPENDIX 3  Soft Limits  To be discussed and agreed between both parties:  Does the Submissive consent to:  Masturbation  Cunnilingus  Fellatio  Swallowing Semen  Vaginal intercourse  Vaginal fisting  Anal intercourse  Anal fisting      No fisting, you say.Anything else you object to?I ask.She swallows.Anal intercourse doesnt exactly float my boat.Ill agree to the fisting, but Id really like to claim your ass, Anastasia.She inhales sharply, gazing at me.But well wait for that.Besides, its not something we can dive into.I cant help my smirk.Your ass will need training.Training?Her eyes widen.Oh yes.Itll need careful preparation.Anal intercourse can be very pleasurable, trust me.But if we try it and you dont like it, we dont have to do it again.I delight in her shocked expression.Have you done that?she asks.Yes.With a man?No.Ive never had sex with a man.Not my scene.Mrs.Robinson?Yes.And her large rubber strap on.Ana frowns and I move on quickly, before she can ask me any more questions about that.Andswallowing semen.Well, you get an A in that.I expect a smile from her, but shes studying me intently, as if seeing me in a new light.I think shes still reeling over Mrs.Robinson and anal intercourse.Oh, baby, Elena had my submission.She could do with me as she pleased.And I enjoyed it.So, swallowing semen okay?I ask, trying to bring her back to the now.She nods and finishes her champagne.More?I ask.Steady, Grey, you just want her tipsy, not drunk.More, she whispers.I refill her cup and get back to the list.Sex toys?Does the Submissive consent to the use of:  Vibrators  Butt plugs  Dildos  Other vaginal/anal toys      Butt plug?Does it do what it says on the box?She grimaces.Yes.And I refer to anal intercourse above.Training.Oh.Whats in other?Beads, eggs, that sort of stuff.Eggs?Her hands shoot to her mouth in shock.Not real eggs.I laugh.Im glad you find me funny.The hurt in her voice is sobering.I apologize.Im sorry.For fucks sake, Grey.Go easy on her.Any problem with toys?No, she snaps.Shit.Shes sulking.Anastasia, I am sorry.Believe me.I dont mean to laugh.Ive never had this conversation in so much detail.Youre just so inexperienced.Im sorry.She pouts and takes another sip of champagne.Rightbondage, I say, and we return to the list.Does the Submissive consent to:  Bondage with rope  Bondage with leather cuffs  Bondage with handcuffs/shackles/manacles  Bondage with tape  Bondage with other      Well?I ask, gently this time.Fine, she whispers and continues reading.Does the Submissive consent to be restrained with:  Hands bound in front  Ankles bound  Elbows bound  Hands bound behind back  Knees bound  Wrists bound to ankles  Binding to fixed items, furniture, etc.Binding with spreader bar  Suspension    Does the Submissive consent to be blindfolded?Does the Submissive consent to be gagged?Weve talked about suspension.And its fine if you want to set that up as a hard limit.It takes a great deal of time, and I only have you for short periods anyway.Anything else?Dont laugh at me, but whats a spreader bar?I promise not to laugh.Ive apologized twice.For Christs sake.Dont make me do it again.My voice is sharper than I intended, and she leans away from me.Shit.Ignore her reaction, Grey.Get on with it.A spreader is a bar with cuffs for ankles and/or wrists.Theyre fun.Okay.Well, gagging me.Id be worried I wouldnt be able to breathe.Id be worried if you couldnt breathe.I dont want to suffocate you.Breath play is not my scene at all.And how will I use safe words if Im gagged?she inquires.First of all, I hope you never have to use them.But if youre gagged, well use hand signals.Im nervous about the gagging.Okay.Ill take note.She studies me for a moment as if shes solved the riddle of the sphinx.Do you like tying your submissives up so they cant touch you?she asks.Thats one of the reasons.Is that why youve tied my hands?Yes.You dont like talking about that, she says.No, I dont.Im not going there with you, Ana.Give it up.Would you like another drink?I ask.Its making you brave, and I need to know how you feel about pain.I refill her cup and she takes a sip, wide eyed and anxious.So, whats your general attitude to receiving pain?She remains mute.I suppress a sigh.Youre biting your lip.Fortunately, she stops, but now shes pensive and staring down at her hands.Were you physically punished as a child?I prompt her gently.No.So you have no sphere of reference at all?No.Its not as bad as you think.Your imagination is your worst enemy in this.Trust me on this, Ana.Please.Do you have to do it?Yes.Why?You really dont want to know.Goes with the territory, Anastasia.Its what I do.I can see youre nervous.Lets go through methods.We read through the list:  Spanking  Whipping  Biting  Genital clamps  Hot wax  Paddling  Caning  Nipple clamps  Ice  Other types/methods of pain      Well, you said no to genital clamps.Thats fine.Its caning that hurts the most.Ana pales.We can work up to that, I state quickly.Or not do it at all, she counters.This is part of the deal, baby, but well work up to all of this.Anastasia, I wont push you too far.This punishment thing, it worries me the most.Well, Im glad youve told me.Well keep caning off the list for now.And as you get more comfortable with everything else, well increase intensity.Well take it slow.She looks uncertain, so I lean forward and kiss her.There, that wasnt so bad, was it?She shrugs, still doubtful.Look, I want to talk about one more thing, then Im taking you to bed.Bed?she exclaims and color flushes her cheeks.Come on, Anastasia, talking through all this, I want to fuck you into next week, right now.It must be having some effect on you, too.She squirms beside me and takes a husky breath, her thighs pressing together.See?Besides, theres something I want to try.Something painful?Nostop seeing pain everywhere.Its mainly pleasure.Have I hurt you yet?No.Well, then.Look, earlier today you were talking about wanting more.I stop.Fuck.Im on a precipice.Okay, Grey, are you sure about this?I have to try.I dont want to lose her before we start.Jump.I take her hand.Outside of the time youre my sub, perhaps we could try.I dont know if it will work.I dont know about separating everything.It may not work.But Im willing to try.Maybe one night a week.I dont know.Her mouth drops open.I have one condition.What?she asks, her breath hitching.You graciously accept my graduation present to you.Oh, she says, her eyes widening with uncertainty.Come.I pull her to her feet, slip off my leather jacket, and drape it over her shoulders.Taking a deep breath, I open the front door and reveal the Audi A3 parked at the curb.Its for you.Happy graduation.I wrap my arms around her and kiss her hair.When I release her she stares dumbfounded at the car.Okaythis could go either way.Taking her hand, I lead her down the steps and she follows as if in a trance.Anastasia, that Beetle of yours is old and, frankly, dangerous.I would never forgive myself if something happened to you when its so easy for me to make it right.She gapes at the car, speechless.Shit.I mentioned it to your stepfather.He was all for it.Perhaps Im overstating this.Her mouth is still open in dismay when she turns to glare at me.You mentioned this to Ray?How could you?Shes annoyed, really annoyed.Its a gift, Anastasia.Cant you just say thank you?But you know its too much.Not to me it isnt, not for my peace of mind.Come on, Ana.You want more.This is the price.Her shoulders sag, and she turns to me, resigned, I think.Not quite the reaction I was hoping for.The rosy glow from the champagne has disappeared and her face is pale once more.Im happy for you to loan this to me, like the laptop.I shake my head.Why is she so difficult?Ive never had this reaction to a car from any of my submissives.Theyre usually delighted.Okay.On loan.Indefinitely, I agree through gritted teeth.No, not indefinitely, but for now.Thank you, she says quietly, and leaning up, she kisses me on the cheek.Thank you for the car, Sir.That word.From her sweet, sweet mouth.I grab her and press her body to mine, her hair pooling in my fingers.You are one challenging woman, Ana Steele.I kiss her forcefully, coaxing her lips apart with my tongue, and a moment later shes responding, matching my ardor, her tongue caressing mine.My body reactsI want her.Here.Now.In the open.Its taking all my self control not to fuck you on the hood of this car right now, just to show you that you are mine, and if I want to buy you a fucking car, Ill buy you a fucking car.Now lets get you inside and naked, I growl.Then I kiss her once more, demanding and possessive.Taking her hand, I stride back into the apartment, slamming the front door behind us and heading straight for her bedroom.There I release her and switch on her bedside light.Please dont be angry with me, she whispers.Her words douse the fire of my anger.Im sorry about the car and the books She halts and licks her lips.You scare me when youre angry.Shit.No one has ever said that to me before.I close my eyes.The last thing I want to do is frighten her.Calm down, Grey.Shes here.Shes safe.Shes willing.Dont blow it, just because she doesnt understand how to behave.Opening my eyes, I find Ana watching me, not in fear, but with anticipation.Turn around, I demand, my voice soft.I want to get you out of that dress.She obeys immediately.Good girl.I remove my jacket from her shoulders and discard it on the floor, then lift her hair off her neck.The feel of her soft skin beneath my index finger is soothing.Now that shes doing what shes told, I relax.With the tip of my finger I follow the line of her spine down her back to the start of the zipper bound in gray chiffon.I like this dress.I like to see your flawless skin.Hooking my finger into the back of her dress, I pull her close so shes flush against me.I bury my face in her hair and breathe in her scent.You smell so good, Anastasia.So sweet.Like fall.Her fragrance is comforting, reminding me of a time of plenty and happiness.Still inhaling her delicious scent, I skim my nose from her ear down her neck to her shoulder, kissing her as I go.Slowly I unzip her dress and kiss, and lick, and suck my way across her skin to her other shoulder.She shivers beneath my touch.Oh, baby.You are going to have to learn to keep still, I whisper between kisses, and unfasten her halter neck.The dress falls to her feet.No bra, Miss Steele.I like that.Reaching forward, I cup her breasts and feel her nipples pebble against my palm.Lift your arms and put them around my head, I order, my lips brushing her neck.She does as shes told and her breasts lift farther into my palms.She twists her fingers into my hair, the way I like, and she tugs.Ah That feels so good.Her head lolls to the side, and I take advantage, kissing her where her pulse hammers beneath her skin.Mmm I murmur in appreciation, my fingers teasing and tugging at her nipples.She groans, arching her back, pushing her perfect tits even farther into my hands.Shall I make you come this way?Her body bows a little more.You like this, dont you, Miss Steele?Mmm  Tell me, I insist, continuing my sensual assault on her nipples.Yes, she breathes.Yes, what?YesSir.Good girl.Gently I pinch and twist with my fingers and her body bucks convulsively against me while she moans, her hands tugging harder at my hair.I dont think youre ready to come yet.And I still my hands, just holding her breasts, while my teeth tug at her earlobe.Besides, you have displeased me.So perhaps I wont let you come after all.I knead her breasts and my fingers return my attention to her nipples, twisting and tugging.She groans and grinds her ass against my erection.Shifting my hands to her hips, I hold her steady and glance down at her panties.Cotton.White.Easy.I hook my fingers into them and stretch them as far as theyll go, then push my thumbs through the seam at the back.They tear apart in my hands and I throw them at Anas feet.She gasps.I trace my fingers around her ass and insert one into her vagina.Shes wet.Very wet.Oh yes.My sweet girl is ready.I spin her around and slip my finger into my mouth.Mmm.Salty.You taste so fine, Miss Steele.Her lips part and her eyes darken with want.I think shes a little shocked.Undress me.I keep my eyes on hers.She tilts her head, processing my command, but hesitates.You can do it, I encourage her.She lifts her hands and all of a sudden I think shes going to touch me, and Im not ready.Shit.Instinctively I grab her hands.Oh no.Not the T shirt.I want her on top.Weve not done this yet, and she may lose her balance, so Ill need the T shirt for protection.You may need to touch me for what I have planned.I release one of her hands, but the other I place over my erection, which is fighting for space in my jeans.This is the effect you have on me, Miss Steele.She inhales, gazing at her hand.Then her fingers tighten around my cock and she glances up at me with appreciation.I grin.I want to be inside you.Take my jeans off.Youre in charge.Her mouth drops open.What are you going to do with me?My voice is husky.Her face transforms, bright with delight, and before I can react she pushes me.I laugh as I fall onto the bed, mainly at her bravado, but also because she touched me and I didnt panic.She removes my shoes, then my socks, but shes all fingers and thumbs, reminding me of the interview and her attempts to set up the recorder.I watch her.Amused.Aroused.Wondering what shell do next.Its going to be one hell of a task for her to remove my jeans while Im lying down.Stepping out of her pumps, she crawls up the bed, sits astride the top of my thighs, and slips her fingers beneath the waistband of my jeans.I close my eyes and flex my hips, enjoying shameless Ana.Youll have to learn to keep still, she castigates me, and tugs at my pubic hair.Ah!So bold, maam.Yes, Miss Steele, I tease through clenched teeth.In my pocket, condom.Her eyes flash with obvious delight and her fingers rifle through my pocket, diving deep, brushing my erection.Ah  She produces both foil packets and tosses them onto the bed beside me.Her fumbling fingers reach for the button on my waistband, and after two attempts she undoes it.Her navet is captivating.Its obvious that shes never done this before.Another firstand its fucking arousing.So eager, Miss Steele, I tease.She yanks down my zipper and, pulling at my waistband, gives me a look of frustration.I try hard not to laugh.Yeah, baby, how are you going to get these off me now?Shuffling down my legs, she tugs at my jeans, concentrating hard, looking adorable.And I decide to help her out.I cant keep still if youre going to bite that lip, I say while arching my hips, lifting them off the bed.Rising up on her knees, she pulls down my jeans and boxers and I kick them off, onto the floor.She sits across me, eyeing my cock and licking her lips.Whoa.She looks hot, her dark hair falling in soft waves around her breasts.Now what are you going to do?I whisper.Her eyes flick to my face and she reaches up and grasps me firmly, squeezing hard, her thumb brushing over the tip.Jesus.She leans down.And Im in her mouth.Fuck.She sucks hard.And my body flexes beneath her.Jeez, Ana, steady, I hiss through my teeth.But she shows no mercy as she fellates me again and again.Fuck.Her enthusiasm is disarming.Her tongue is up and down, Im in and out of her mouth to the back of her throat, her lips tight around me.Its an overwhelming erotic vision.I could come just watching her.Stop, Ana, stop.I dont want to come.She sits up, her mouth moist and her eyes two dark pools directed down at me.Your innocence and enthusiasm are very disarming.But right now I want to fuck you so I can see you.You, on top, thats what we need to do.Here, put this on.I place a condom in her hand.She examines it with consternation, then rips the packet open with her teeth.Shes keen.She removes the condom and looks to me for direction.Pinch the top and then roll it down.You dont want any air in the end of that sucker.She nods and does exactly that, absorbed in her task, concentrating hard, her tongue peeking between her lips.Christ, youre killing me here, I exclaim through clenched teeth.When shes done she sits back and admires her handiwork, or meIm not quite sure, but I dont care.Now.I want to be buried inside you.I sit up suddenly so were face to face, surprising her.Like this, I whisper, and, wrapping my arm around her, I lift her.With my other hand I position my cock and lower her slowly onto me.My breath escapes from my body as her eyes close and pleasure thrums noisily in her throat.Thats right, baby, feel me, all of me.She.Feels.So.Good.I hold her, letting her get used to the feel of me.Like this.Inside her.Its deep this way.My voice is hoarse, as I flex and tilt my pelvis, pushing deeper into her.Her head lolls as she moans.Again, she breathes.And she opens her eyes and they blaze into mine.Wanton.Willing.I love that she loves this.I do as Im asked and she moans again, throwing back her head, her hair tumbling in a riot over her shoulders.Slowly I recline onto the bed to watch the show.You move, Anastasia, up and down, how you want.Take my hands.I hold them out and she grabs them, steadying herself on top of me.Slowly she eases herself up, then sinks back down onto me.My breath is coming in short, sharp pants as I restrain myself.She lifts herself again and this time I raise my hips to meet her as she comes down.Oh yes.Closing my eyes, I savor every delicious inch of her.Together we find our rhythm as she rides me.Over and over and over.She looks fantastic: her breasts bouncing, her hair swinging, her mouth slack as she absorbs each stab of pleasure.Her eyes meet mine, full of carnal need and wonder.God, shes beautiful.She cries out as her body takes over.Shes almost there, so I tighten my grip on her hands, and she ignites around me.I grab her hips, holding her as she shouts incoherently through her orgasm.Then I tighten my hold on her hips and silently lose myself as I explode inside her.She flops down onto my chest, and I lie, panting, beneath her.My God, shes a good fuck.We lie together for a moment, her weight a comfort.She stirs and nuzzles me through my shirt, then splays her hand on top of my chest.The darkness slithers, quick and strong, into my chest, into my throat, threatening to suffocate and choke me.No.Dont touch me.I grab her hand and bring her knuckles to my lips, and roll over on top of her so shes no longer able to touch me.Dont, I plead, and kiss her lips as I dampen down my fear.Why dont you like to be touched?Because Im fifty shades of fucked up, Anastasia.After years and years of therapy, its the one thing I know to be true.Her eyes widen, inquisitive; shes thirsty for more information.But she doesnt need to know this shit.I had a very tough introduction to life.I dont want to burden you with the details.Just dont.I gently brush my nose against hers and, withdrawing from her, I sit up and remove the condom and drop it by the bed.I think thats all the very basics covered.How was that?For a moment she seems distracted, then she tilts her head to one side and smiles.If you imagine for one minute that I think you ceded control to me, well, you havent taken into account my GPA.But thank you for the illusion.Miss Steele, you are not just a pretty face.Youve had six orgasms so far and all of them belong to me.Why does that mere fact make me glad?Her eyes stray to the ceiling, and a fleeting guilty expression crosses her face.Whats this?Do you have something to tell me?I ask.She hesitates.I had a dream this morning.Oh?I came in my sleep.She flings her arm over her face, hiding from me, embarrassed.Im stunned by her confession but aroused and delighted, too.Sensual creature.She peeks over her arm.Does she expect me to be angry?In your sleep?I clarify.Woke me up, she whispers.Im sure it did.Im fascinated.What were you dreaming about?You, she says in a small voice.Me!What was I doing?She hides beneath her arm again.Anastasia, what was I doing?I wont ask you again.Why is she so embarrassed?Her dreaming about me isendearing.You had a riding crop, she mumbles.I move her arm so I can see her face.Really?Yes.Her face is bright red.The research must be affecting her, in a good way.I smile down at her.Theres hope for you yet.I have several riding crops.Brown plaited leather?Her voice is tinged with quiet optimism.I laugh.No, but Im sure I could get one.I give her a swift kiss and stand to dress.Ana does the same, pulling on sweatpants and a camisole.Collecting the condom off the floor, I knot it quickly.Now that shes agreed to be mine, she needs contraception.Fully dressed, she sits cross legged on the bed watching me as I grab my pants.When is your period due?I ask.I hate wearing these things.I hold up the knotted condom and pull on my jeans.Shes taken aback.Well?I prod.Next week, she answers, her cheeks pink.You need to sort out some contraception.I sit on the bed to slip on my socks and shoes.She says nothing.Do you have a doctor?I ask.She shakes her head.I can have mine come and see you at your apartmentSunday morning, before you come and see me.Or he can see you at my place.Which would you prefer?Im sure Dr.Baxter will make a house call for me, although I havent seen him for a while.Your place, she says.Okay.Ill let you know the time.Are you leaving?She seems surprised that Im going.Yes.How are you getting back?she asks.Taylor will pick me up.I can drive you.I have a lovely new car.Thats better.Shes accepted the car as she should, but after all that champagne she shouldnt be driving.I think youve had too much to drink.Did you get me tipsy on purpose?Yes.Why?Because you overthink everything, and youre reticent, like your stepdad.A drop of wine in you and you start talking, and I need you to communicate honestly with me.Otherwise you clam up, and I have no idea what youre thinking.In vino veritas, Anastasia.And you think youre always honest with me?I endeavor to be.This will only work if were honest with each other.Id like you to stay and use this.She grabs the other condom and waves it at me.Manage her expectations, Grey.I have crossed so many lines here tonight.I have to go.Ill see you on Sunday.I stand up.Ill have the revised contract ready for you, and then we can really start to play.Play?she squeaks.Id like to do a scene with you.But I wont until youve signed, so I know youre ready.Oh.So I could stretch this out if I dont sign?Shit.I hadnt thought of that.Her chin tilts up in defiance.Ahtopping from the bottom, again.She always finds a way.Well, I suppose you could, but I may crack under the strain.Crack?How?she queries, her eyes alive with curiosity.Could get really ugly, I tease, narrowing my eyes.Ugly, how?Her grin matches mine.Oh, you know, explosions, car chases, kidnapping, incarceration.Youd kidnap me?Oh yes.Hold me against my will?Oh yes.Now, thats an interesting idea.And then were talking TPE twenty four seven.Youve lost me, she says, perplexed and a little breathless.Total Power Exchangearound the clock.My mind whirls as I think of the possibilities.Shes curious.So you have no choice, I add, with a playful tone.Clearly.Her tone is sarcastic and she rolls her eyes to the heavens, perhaps looking for divine inspiration to understand my sense of humor.Oh, sweet joy.Anastasia Steele, did you just roll your eyes at me?No!I think you did.What did I say Id do to you if you rolled your eyes at me again?My words hang between us and I sit down again on the bed.Come here.For a moment she stares at me, blanching.I havent signed, she whispers.I told you what Id do.Im a man of my word.Im going to spank you, and then Im going to fuck you very quick and very hard.Looks like well need that condom after all.Will she?Wont she?This is it.Proof of whether she can do this or not.I watch her, impassive, waiting for her to decide.If she says no, it means shes paying lip service to the idea of being my submissive.And that will be it.Make the right choice, Ana.Her expression is grave, her eyes wide, and I think shes weighing up her decision.Im waiting, I murmur.Im not a patient man.Taking a deep breath, she unfurls her legs and crawls toward me, and I hide my relief.Good girl.Now stand up.She does as shes told, and I offer her my hand.She lays the condom on my palm, and I grasp her hand and abruptly pull her over my left knee, so that her head, shoulders, and chest are resting on the bed.I drape my right leg over her legs, holding her in place.Ive wanted to do this since she asked me if I was gay.Put your hands up on either side of your head, I order and she complies immediately.Why am I doing this, Anastasia?Because I rolled my eyes at you, she says in a hoarse whisper.Do you think thats polite?No.Will you do it again?No.I will spank you each time you do it, do you understand?Im going to savor this moment.Its another first.With great carerelishing the deedI tug down her sweatpants.Her beautiful behind is naked and ready for me.As I place my hand on her backside, she tenses every muscle in her bodywaiting.Her skin is soft to the touch and I sweep my palm across both cheeks, fondling each.She has a fine, fine ass.And Im going to make it pinklike the champagne.Lifting my palm, I smack her, hard, just above the junction of her thighs.She gasps and tries to rise, but I hold her down with my other hand at the small of her back, and I soothe the area Ive just hit with a slow, gentle caress.She stays still.Panting.Anticipating.Yes.Im going to do that again.I smack her once, twice, three times.She grimaces at the pain, her eyes screwed shut.But she doesnt ask me to stop even though shes squirming beneath me.Keep still, or Ill spank you for longer, I warn.I rub her sweet flesh and start again, taking turns: left cheek, right cheek, middle.She cries out.But she doesnt move her arms, and she still doesnt ask me to stop.Im just getting warmed up.My voice is husky.I smack her again, and trace the pink handprint Ive left on her skin.Her ass is pinking up nicely.It looks glorious.I smack her once more.And she cries out again.No one to hear you, baby, just me.I spank her over and overthe same pattern, left cheek, right cheek, middleand she yelps each time.When I reach eighteen I stop.Im breathless, my palm is stinging, and my cock is rigid.Enough, I rasp, trying to catch my breath.Well done, Anastasia.Now Im going to fuck you.I stroke her pink behind gently, round and round, moving down.Shes wet.And my body gets harder.I insert two fingers into her vagina.Feel this.See how much your body likes this.Youre soaking, just for me.I slide my fingers in and out, and she groans, her body curling around them with each push and her breathing accelerating.I withdraw them.I want her.Now.Next time, I will get you to count.Now, wheres that condom?Grabbing it from beside her head, I ease her gently off my lap and onto the bed, facedown.Unzipping my fly, I dont bother to remove my jeans, and I make short work of the foil packet, rolling the condom on quickly and efficiently.I lift her hips until shes kneeling and her ass in all its rosy glory is poised in the air as I stand behind her.Im going to take you now.You can come, I growl, caressing her behind and grabbing my cock.With one swift thrust Im inside her.She moans as I move.In.Out.In.Out.I pound into her, watching my cock disappear beneath her pink backside.Her mouth is open wide and she grunts and groans with each thrust, her cries getting higher and higher.Come on, Ana.She clenches around me and cries out as she comes, hard.Oh, Ana!I follow her over the edge as I climax into her and lose all time and perspective.I collapse at her side, pull her on top of me, and, wrapping my arms around her, I whisper into her hair, Oh, baby, welcome to my world.Her weight anchors me, and she makes no attempt to touch my chest.Her eyes are closed and her breathing is returning to normal.I stroke her hair.Its soft, a rich mahogany, shining in the glow of her bedside light.She smells of Ana and apples and sex.Its heady.Well done, baby.Shes not in tears.She did as she was asked.Shes faced every challenge Ive thrown at her; she really is quite remarkable.I finger the thin strap of her cheap cotton camisole.Is this what you sleep in?Yes.She sounds drowsy.You should be in silks and satins, you beautiful girl.Ill take you shopping.I like my sweats, she argues.Of course she does.I kiss her hair.Well see.Closing my eyes, I relax in our quiet moment, a strange contentment warming me, filling me up inside.This feels right.Too right.I have to go, I murmur, and kiss her forehead.Are you okay?Im okay, she says, sounding a little subdued.Gently I roll out from underneath her and get up.Wheres your bathroom?I ask, taking off the used condom and zipping up my jeans.Down the hall to the left.In the bathroom I discard the condoms in a trash bin and spy a bottle of baby oil on the shelf.Thats what I need.Shes dressed when I return, evading my gaze.Why so shy suddenly?I found some baby oil.Let me rub it into your behind.No.Ill be fine, she says, examining her fingers, still avoiding eye contact.Anastasia, I warn her.Please just do as youre told.I sit down behind her and tug down her sweatpants.Squirting some baby oil on my hand, I rub it tenderly into her sore ass.She puts her hands on her hips in an obstinate stance, but stays silent.I like my hands on you, I admit out loud to myself.There.I pull her sweatpants up.Im leaving now.Ill see you out, she says quietly, standing aside.I take her hand and reluctantly let go when we reach the front door.Part of me doesnt want to leave.Dont you have to call Taylor?she asks, her eyes fixed on the zipper of my leather jacket.Taylors been here since nine.Look at me.Large blue eyes peek up at me through long, dark lashes.You didnt cry.My voice is low.And you let me spank you.Youre amazing.I grab her and kiss her, pouring my gratitude into the kiss and holding her close.Sunday, I whisper, fevered, against her lips.I release her abruptly before Im tempted to ask her if I can stay, and I head out to where Taylor is waiting in the SUV.Once Im in the car I look back, but shes gone.Shes probably tiredlike me.Pleasantly tired.That has to have been the most pleasurable soft limits conversation Ive ever had.Damn, that woman is unexpected.Closing my eyes, I see her riding me, her head tipped back in ecstasy.Ana does not do things halfheartedly.She commits.And to think she had sex for the first time only a week ago.With me.And no one else.I grin as I stare out the car window, but all I see is my ghostly face reflected in the glass.So I close my eyes and allow myself to daydream.Training her will be fun.TAYLOR WAKES ME FROM my doze.Were here, Mr.Grey.Thank you, I mumble.I have a meeting in the morning.At the hotel?Yes.Videoconference.I wont need to be driven anywhere.But Id like to leave before lunch.What time would you like me to pack?Ten thirty.Very good, sir.The BlackBerry you asked for will be delivered to Miss Steele tomorrow.Good.That reminds me.Can you collect her old Beetle tomorrow and dispose of it?I dont want her driving it.Of course.I have a friend who restores vintage cars.He might be interested.Ill deal with it.Will there be anything else?No thank you.Good night.Good night.I leave Taylor to park the SUV and make my way up to my suite.Opening a bottle of sparkling water from the fridge, I sit down at the desk and switch on my laptop.No urgent e mails.But my real purpose is to say good night to Ana.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: You  Date: May 26 2011 23:14  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele,  You are quite simply exquisite.The most

Anastasia Steele  Subject: Careful Yourself  Date: May 27 2011 00:09  To: Christian Grey  Because you never stay with me.Six words.Six little words that make my scalp tingle.I told her that I didnt sleep with anyone.But today was a big day.She graduated from college.She said yes.We went through all those soft limits that she knew nothing about.We fucked.I spanked her.We fucked again.Shit.And before I can stop myself, I grab the garage ticket for my car, pick up a jacket, and Im out the door.THE ROADS ARE EMPTY and Im at her place twenty three minutes later.I knock quietly, and Kavanagh opens the door.What the fuck do you think youre doing here?she shouts, her eyes blazing with anger.Whoa.Not the reception I was expecting.Ive come to see Ana.Well, you cant!Kavanagh stands with arms folded and legs braced in the doorway, like a gargoyle.I try reasoning with her.But I need to see her.She sent me an e mail.Get out of my way!What the fuck have you done to her now?Thats what I need to find out.I grit my teeth.Ever since she met you she cries all the time.What?I cant deal with her shit anymore, and I barge past her.You cant come in here!Kavanagh follows me, shrieking like a harpy, as I storm through the apartment to Anas bedroom.I open Anas door and switch on the main light.Shes huddled in her bed, wrapped in her comforter.Her eyes are red and puffy, and squinting in the overhead light.Her nose is swollen and blotchy.Ive seen women in this state many times, especially after Ive punished them.But Im surprised by the unease that grips my gut.Jesus, Ana.I flick the main light off so she doesnt have to squint and I sit on the bed beside her.What are you doing here?Shes sniffling.I turn on her bedside light.Do you want me to throw this asshole out?Kate barks from the doorway.Fuck you, Kavanagh.Raising an eyebrow, I pretend to ignore her.Ana shakes her head, but her watery eyes are on me.Just holler if you need me, Kate says to Ana, as if she were a child.Grey, she snaps, so Im obliged to look at her.Youre on my shit list, and Im watching you.She sounds shrill, her eyes glinting with fury, but I dont give a fuck.Fortunately she leaves, pulling the door to, but not shutting it.I check in my inside pocket, and once again Mrs.Jones has exceeded all expectations; I fish out the handkerchief and give it to Ana.Whats going on?Why are you here?Her voice is shaky.I dont know.You said you didnt like me.Part of my role is to look after your needs.You said you wanted me to stay, so here I am.Nice save, Grey.And yet I find you like this.You werent like this when I left.Im sure Im responsible, but I have no idea why.Is it because I hit you?She struggles to sit up and flinches when she does.Did you take some Advil?As instructed?She shakes her head.When will you do as youre told?I go to find Kavanagh, whos on the sofa, seething.Ana has a headache.Do you have any Advil?She raises her eyebrows, surprised, I think, by my concern for her friend.Glowering, she gets up and stomps into the kitchen.After some rustling through boxes she hands me a couple of tablets and a teacup of water.Back in the bedroom I offer them to Ana and sit on the bed.Take these.She does, her eyes clouded with apprehension.Talk to me.You told me you were okay.Id never have left you if I thought you were like this.Distracted, she toys with a loose thread on her quilt.I take it that when you said you were okay, you werent.I thought I was fine, she admits.Anastasia, you cant tell me what you think I want to hear.Thats not very honest.How can I trust anything youve said to me?This will never work if shes not honest with me.The thought is depressing.Talk to me, Ana.How did you feel while I was hitting you, and after?I didnt like it.Id rather you didnt do it again.You werent meant to like it.Why do you like it?she asks, and her voice is stronger.Shit.I cant tell her why.You really want to know?Oh, trust me, Im fascinated.Now shes being sarcastic.Careful, I warn her.She pales at my expression.Are you going to hit me again?No, not tonight.I think youve had enough.So.She still wants an answer.I like the control it gives me, Anastasia.I want you to behave in a particular way, and if you dont, I shall punish you, and you will learn to behave the way I desire.I enjoy punishing you.Ive wanted to spank you since you asked me if I was gay.And I dont want you rolling your eyes at me, or being sarcastic.So you dont like the way I am.Her voice is small.I think youre lovely the way you are.So why are you trying to change me?I dont want to change you.God forbid.Youre enchanting.Id like you to be courteous and to follow the set of rules Ive given you and not defy me.Simple.I want you safe.But you want to punish me?Yes, I do.Thats what I dont understand.I sigh.Its the way Im made.I need to control you.I need you to behave in a certain way, and if you dont My mind drifts.I find it arousing, Ana.You did, too.Cant you accept that?Bending you over my kneefeeling your ass beneath my palm.I love to watch your beautiful alabaster skin pink and warm up under my hands.It turns me on.Just thinking about it stirs my body.So its not the pain youre putting me through?Hell.A bit, to see if you can take it.Actually, its a lot, but I dont want to go there right now.If I tell her, shell throw me out.But thats not the whole reason.Its the fact that you are mine to do with as I see fitultimate control over someone else.And it turns me on.Big time.I must lend her a book or two on being a submissive.Look, Im not explaining myself very well.Ive never had to before.Ive not really thought about this in any great depth.Ive always been with like minded people.I pause to check shes still with me.And you havent answered my questionhow did you feel afterward?She blinks.Confused.You were sexually aroused by it, Anastasia.You have an inner freak, Ana.I know it.Closing my eyes, I recall her wet and wanting around my fingers after I spanked her.When I open them, shes staring at me, pupils dilated, her lips partedher tongue moistening her top lip.She wants it, too.Shit.Not again, Grey.Not when shes like this.Dont look at me like that, I warn, my voice gruff.Her eyebrows rise in surprise.You know what I mean, Ana.I dont have any condoms, and you know, youre upset.Contrary to what your roommate believes, Im not a priapic monster.So, you felt confused?She remains mute.Jesus.You have no problem being honest with me in print.Your e mails always tell me exactly how you feel.Why cant you do that in conversation?Do I intimidate you that much?Her fingers fiddle with the quilt.You beguile me, Christian.Completely overwhelm me.I feel like Icarus, flying too close to the sun.Her voice is quiet, but brimming with emotion.Her confession floors me like a swift kick to the head.Well, I think youve got that the wrong way round, I whisper.What?Oh, Anastasia, youve bewitched me.Isnt it obvious?Thats why Im here.Shes not convinced.Ana.Believe me.Youve still not answered my question.Write me an e mail, please.But right now, Id really like to sleep.Can I stay?Do you want to stay?You wanted me here.You havent answered my question, she persists.Impossible woman.I just drove like a maniac to get here after your fucking message.Theres your answer.I grumble that Ill respond by e mail.Im not talking about this.This conversation is over.Before I can change my mind and head back to The Heathman, I stand, empty my pockets, remove my shoes and socks, and strip off my pants.Slinging my jacket over her chair, I climb into her bed.Lie down, I growl.She complies, and I lean up on my elbow, looking at her.If you are going to cry, cry in front of me.I need to know.Do you want me to cry?Not particularly.I just want to know how youre feeling.I dont want you slipping through my fingers.Switch the light off.Its late, and we both have to work tomorrow.She does.Lie on your side, facing away from me.I dont want you to touch me.The bed dips as she moves, and I wrap my arm around her and gently pull her against me.Sleep, baby, I murmur, and breathe in the scent of her hair.Damn, she smells good.Lelliot is running through the grass.Hes laughing.Loud.I am running after him.My face is smiling.I am going to catch him.There are small trees around us.Baby trees covered in apples.Mommy lets me pick the apples.Mommy lets me eat the apples.I put the apples in my pockets.Every pocket.I hide them in my sweater.Apples taste good.Apples smell good.Mommy makes apple pie.Apple pie and ice cream.They make my tummy smile.I hide the apples in my shoes.I hide them under my pillow.There is a man.Grandpa Trev Trev yan.His name is hard.Hard to say in my head.He has another name.Thee o door.Theodore is a funny name.The baby trees are his trees.At his house.Where he lives.He is Mommys daddy.He has a loud laugh.And big shoulders.And happy eyes.He runs to catch Lelliot and me.You cant catch me.Lelliot runs.He laughs.I run.I catch him.And we fall down in the grass.He is laughing.The apples sparkle in the sun.And they taste so good.Yummy.And they smell so good.So, so good.The apples fall.They fall on me.I twist and they hit my back.Stinging me.Ow.But the scent is still there, sweet and crisp.Ana.When I open my eyes Im wrapped around her, our limbs entwined.Shes regarding me with a tender smile.Her face is no longer blotchy and puffy; she looks radiant.My cock agrees, and stiffens in greeting.Good morning.Im disoriented.Jesus, even in my sleep Im drawn to you.Stretching out, I disentangle myself from her and scan my surroundings.Of course, were in her bedroom.Her eyes glow with eager curiosity as my cock presses against her.Hmm, this has possibilities, but I think we should wait until Sunday.I nuzzle her just below her ear and lean up on my elbow.She looks flushed.Warm.Youre very hot, she scolds.Youre not so bad yourself.I grin and flex my hips, teasing her with my favorite body part.She tries a disapproving look but fails miserablyshes highly amused.Leaning down, I kiss her.Sleep well?I ask.She nods.So did I.   Im surprised.I did sleep really well.I tell her so.No nightmares.Only dreams  Whats the time?I ask.Its seven thirty.Seven thirty?Shit!I leap out of bed and start dragging on my jeans.She watches me dress, trying to suppress her laughter.You are such a bad influence on me, I complain.I have a meeting.I have to goI have to be in Portland at eight.Are you smirking at me?Yes, she admits.Im late.I dont do late.Another first, Miss Steele.I tug on my jacket, reach down and take her head in both my hands.Sunday, I whisper, and kiss her.I grab my watch, wallet, and money from her bedside table, pick up my shoes, and head for the door.Taylor will come and sort your Beetle.I was serious.Dont drive it.Ill see you at my place on Sunday.Ill e mail you a time.Leaving her a little dazed, I rush out of the apartment and to my car.I put on my shoes while Im driving.Once theyre on I open up the throttle and weave in and out of the traffic heading to Portland.Ill have to meet Eamon Kavanaghs associates in my jeans.Thankfully this meeting is via WebEx.I burst into my room at The Heathman and switch on my laptop: 8:02.Shit.I havent shaved, but I smooth my hair and straighten my jacket, and hope they dont notice Im only wearing a T shirt underneath.Who gives a fuck, anyway?I open WebEx and Andrea is online, waiting for me.Good morning, Mr.Grey.Mr.Kavanagh is delayed, but theyre ready for you in New York and here in Seattle.Fred and Barney?My Flintstones.I smirk at the thought.Yes, sir.And Ros, too.Great.Thanks.Im breathless.I catch Andreas fleeting puzzled look and choose to ignore it.Can you order me a toasted bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon and a coffee, black.Have it sent to my suite ASAP.Yes, Mr.Grey.She posts the link to the conference in the window.Here you go, sir, she says.I click the linkand Im in.Good morning.There are two executives seated at a conference table in New York, both gazing expectantly at the camera.Ros, Barney, and Fred are each in separate windows.To business.Kavanagh says he wants to upgrade his media network to high speed fiber optic connections.GEH can do it for thembut are they serious about buying in?Its a big investment up front, but a great payoff down the line.While were talking an e mail notification with an arresting title from Ana floats onto the top right corner of my screen.As quietly as I can, I click on it.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Assault and Battery: The After Effects  Date: May 27 2011 08:05  To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grey,  You wanted to know why I felt confused after youwhich euphemism should we applyspanked, punished, beat, assaulted me.A tad overdramatic, Miss Steele.You could have said no.Well, during the whole alarming process, I felt demeaned, debased, and abused.If you felt that way, why didnt you stop me?You have safe words.And much to my mortification, youre right, I was aroused, and that was unexpected.I know.Good.Youve finally acknowledged it.As you are well aware, all things sexual are new to meI only wish I was more experienced and therefore more prepared.I was shocked to feel aroused.What really worried me was how I felt afterward.And thats more difficult to articulate.I was happy that you were happy.I felt relieved that it wasnt as painful as I thought it would be.And when I was lying in your arms, I feltsated.As did I, Ana, as did I  But I feel very uncomfortable, guilty even, feeling that way.It doesnt sit well with me, and Im confused as a result.Does that answer your question?I hope the world of Mergers and Acquisitions is as stimulating as everand that you werent too late.Thank you for staying with me.Ana  Kavanagh joins the conversation, apologizing for his tardiness.While the introductions are made and Fred talks about what GEH can offer, I type out my reply to Ana.I hope to those on the other side of the computer screen it looks like Im taking notes.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Free Your Mind  Date: May 27 2011

assaultedhow very Tess Durbeyfield of you.I believe it was you who decided on the debasement, if I remember correctly.Do you really feel like this or do you think you ought to feel like this?Two very different things.If that is how you feel, do you think you could just try to embrace these feelings, deal with them, for me?Thats what a submissive would do.I am grateful for your inexperience.I value it, and Im only beginning to understand what it means.Simply putit means that you are mine in every way.Yes, you were aroused, which in turn was very arousing, theres nothing wrong with that.Happy does not even begin to cover how I felt.Ecstatic joy comes close.Punishment spanking hurts far more than sensual spankingso thats about as hard as it gets, unless, of course, you commit some major transgression, in which case Ill use some implement to punish you with.My hand was very sore.But I like that.I felt sated, toomore so than you could ever know.Dont waste your energy on guilt, feelings of wrongdoing, etc.We are consenting adults and what we do behind closed doors is between ourselves.You need to free your mind and listen to your body.The world of M&A is not nearly as stimulating as you are, Miss Steele.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.Her response is almost immediate.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Consenting Adults!Date: May 27 2011 08:26  To:
