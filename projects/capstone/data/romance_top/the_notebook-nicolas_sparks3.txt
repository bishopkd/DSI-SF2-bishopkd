Allie could feel his eyes on her as she stared in that direction.A lot of memories there, Allie.She smiled.I know.I saw it when I came in.Do you remember the day we spent there?Yes, he answered, volunteering no more.Do you ever think about it?"Sometimes, he said.Usually when Im working out this way.It sits on my property now."You bought it?I just couldnt bear to see it turned into kitchen cabinets.She laughed under her breath, feeling strangely pleased about that.Do you still read poetry?He nodded.Yeah.I never stopped.I guess its in my blood.Do you know, youre the only poet Ive ever met.Im no poet.I read, but I cant write a verse.Ive tried.Youre still a poet, Noah Taylor Calhoun.Her voice softened.I still think about it a lot.It was the first time anyone ever read poetry to me.In fact, its the only time.Her comment made both of them drift back and remember as they slowly circled back to the house, following a new path that passed near the dock.As the sun dropped a little lower and the sky turned orange, he asked: "So, how long are you staying?I dont know.Not long.Maybe until tomorrow or the next day."Is your flanc6 here on business?She shook her head.No, hes still in Raleigh.Noah raised his eyebrows.Does he know youre here?She shook her head again and answered slowly.No.I told him I was looking for antiques.He wouldnt understand my coming here.Noah was a little surprised.It was one thing to come and visit, but it was an entirely different matter to hide the truth from her fianc.The gravel crunched beneath their feet as they walked.He asked: Allie, do you love him?She answered automatically.Yes, I love him.The words hurt.But again he thought he heard something in her tone, as if she were saying it to convince herself.He stopped and gently took her shoulders in his hands, making her face him.The fading sunlight reflected in her eyes as he spoke.If youre happy, Allie, and you love him.I wont try to stop you from going back to him.But if theres a part of you that isnt sure, then dont do it.This isnt the kind of thing you go into halfway.Her answer came almost too quickly.Im making the right decision.Noah.He stared for a second, wondering if he believed her.Then he nodded and they began to walk again.He said: Im not making this easy for you, am I. ?She smiled a little."Its okay.I really cant blame you."Im sorry anyway. ""Dont be.Theres no reason to be sorry.Im the one who should be apologizing.Maybe I should have written.He shook his head."Im glad you came.Its good to see you again.You were the best friend I ever had, Allie.Id still like to be friends, even if you are engaged, and even if it is just for a couple of days.How about we just kind of get to know each other again?She thought about it, and decided that since he knew about her engagement, it would probably be all right.Or at least not wrong.She smiled slightly and nodded."Id like that."Good.How about dinner?I know a place that serves the best crab in town."Sounds great.Where?"My house.Ive had the traps out all week, and I saw that I had some good ones caged a couple of days ago.Do you mind?"No, that sounds fine.He smiled and pointed over his shoulder with his thumb."Great.Theyre at the dock.Ill just be a couple of minutes.Allie watched him walk away and noticed the tension shed felt when telling him about her engagement beginning to fade.Closing her eyes, she ran her hands through her hair and let the breeze fan her cheek.She took a deep breath and held it for a moment, feeling the muscles in her shoulders relax as she exhaled.Finally, opening her eyes, she stared at the beauty that surrounded her.She always loved evenings like this, when the faint aroma of autumn leaves rode on soft southern winds.She loved the trees and the sounds they made.Listening to them helped her relax even more.After a moment, she turned towards the dock and looked at Noah.God, he looked good.Even after all this time.She watched him as he reached for a rope that hung in the water.He began to pull it, and despite the darkening sky she saw the muscles in his arm flex as he lifted the cage from the water.He let it hang over the river for a moment and shook it, letting most of the water escape.After setting the trap on the dock, he opened it and began to remove the crabs one by one, placing them into a bucket.She looked around and realized she had forgotten how fresh and beautiful everything seemed here.Over her shoulder, as she walked over to join Noah, she saw he had left a couple of lights on in the house.It seemed to be the only house around.At least the only one with electricity.She stepped on the dock and it creaked under her foot.The sound reminded her of a rusty squeezebox.Noah glanced up, then went back to checking the crabs, making sure they were the right size.She walked to the rocker that sat on the dock and touched it, running her hand along the back.She could picture him sitting in it, fishing, thinking, reading.It was old and weather beaten, rough feeling.She wondered how much time he spent here alone, and about his thoughts at times like those.A compulsion had driven her here, and for the first time in three weeks the feeling was gone.Shed needed Noah to know about her engagement, to understand, to accept it she was sure of that now.While thinking of him, she was reminded of something they shared the summer they were together.With head down, she paced around slowly until she found it the carving.Noah loves Allie, in a heart.Carved into the dock a few days before shed left.A breeze broke the stillness and chilled her, making her cross her arms.She stood that way, alternately looking down at the caning and then towards the river, until she heard him reach her side.She could feel his closeness, his warmth.Its so peaceful here, she said, her voice dreamlike.I know.I come down here a lot now just to be close to the water.It makes me feel good.Come on, lets go.The mosquitoes are getting vicious, and Im starved.THE SKY had turned black and they started towards the house.In the silence Allies mind wandered and she felt a little light headed.She wondered what he was thinking about her being here and wasnt exactly sure if she knew herself.When they reached the house a couple of minutes later, Clem greeted them on the back porch.Noah set the bucket by the door, then led the way inside to the kitchen.It was on the right, large and smelling of new wood.The cabinets had been done in oak, like the floor, and the windows were large and faced east, allowing the light from the morning sun.It was a tasteful restoration, not overdone as was so often the case when homes like this were rebuilt.Do you mind if I look around?No, go ahead.I did some shopping earlier and I still have to put the groceries away.She toured the house for the next few minutes, walking through the rooms, noticing how wonderful it looked.She came down the stairs, turned towards the kitchen, and saw his profile.For a second he looked like a young man of seventeen again, and it made her pause a split second before going on.Damn, she thought, get a hold of yourself.Remember that youre engaged now.He was standing by the counter; a couple of cabinet doors open wide, empty grocery bags on the floor, whistling quietly.Its unbelievable, Noah.How long did the restoration take?He looked up from the last bag he was unpacking.Almost a year. "Did you do it all yourself?He laughed.No.I always thought I would when I was young, and I started that way.But it was just too much.It would have taken years, and so I ended up hiring some people actually a lot of people.But even with them it was still a lot of work, and most of the time I didnt stop until past midnight.Whyd you work so hard?Ghosts, he wanted to say, but didnt.I dont know.Just wanted to finish, I guess.Do you want anything to drink before I start dinner?What do you have?Not much, really.Beer, tea, coffee.Tea sounds good.He gathered the grocery bags and put them away, then walked to a small room off the kitchen before returning with a box of tea.He pulled out a couple of tea bags and put them by the stove, then filled the kettle.After standing it on the burner, he lit a match and she heard the sound of flames as they came to life.Itll be just a minute, he said, this stove heats up pretty quick.Thats fine.When the kettle whistled, he poured two cups and handed one to her.She smiled and took a sip.Im going to get the crabs in to marinate for a few minutes before I steam em, he said, putting his cup on the counter.He went to the cupboard and removed a large pot with a steamer and lid.He brought the pot to the sink, added water, then carried it to the stove.Can I give you a hand with something?He answered over his shoulder: Sure.How about cutting up some vegetables to fry.Theres plenty in the icebox, and you can find a bowl over there.He motioned to the cabinet near the sink, and she took another sip of tea before setting her cup on the counter and retrieving the bowl.She carried it to the icebox and found some okra, courgettes, onions and carrots on the bottom shelf.Noah joined her in front of the open door, and she moved to make room for him.She could smell him as he stood next to her clean, familiar, distinctive and felt his arm brush against her as he leaned over and reached inside.He removed a beer and a bottle of hot sauce, then returned to the stove.Noah opened the beer and poured it in the water, then added the hot sauce and some other seasoning.After stirring the water to make sure the powders dissolved, he went to the back door to get the crabs.He paused for a moment before going back inside and stared at Allie, watching her cut the carrots.As he did that, he wondered again why she had come, especially now that she was engaged.None of this made much sense to him.But then Allie had always been surprising.He smiled, remembering the way she had been.Fiery, spontaneous, passionate as he imagined most artists to be.And she was definitely that.Artistic talent like hers was a gift.He remembered seeing some paintings in the museums in New York and thinking that her work was just as good.She had given him a painting before shed left that summer.It hung above the fireplace in the living room.Shed called it a picture of her dreams, and to him it had seemed extremely sensual.When he looked at it, and he often did late in the evening, he could see desire in the colours and the lines, and if he focused carefully he could imagine what she had been thinking with every stroke.A dog barked in the distance, and Noah realized he had been standing with the door open a long time.He closed it quickly and went into the kitchen.Hows it going?he asked, seeing she was nearly finished.Good.Im almost done here.Anything else for dinner?I have some homemade bread that I was planning on.From a neighbour, he added as he put the pail in the sink.He began to rinse the crabs, holding them under the tap, then letting them scurry around the sink while he rinsed the next one.Allie picked up her cup and came over to watch him.Arent you afraid theyll pinch you?No.Just grab em like this, he said, demonstrating.She smiled.I forget youve done this your whole life.She leaned against the counter, standing close to him, and emptied her cup.When the crabs were ready he put them in the pot on the stove.He washed his hands, turning to speak to her as he did so.You want to sit on the porch for a few minutes?Id like to let them marinate for a half hour.Sure, she said.He wiped his hands, and together they went to the back porch.Noah flicked on the light as they went outside, and he sat in the older rocker, offering the newer one to her.When he saw her cup was empty, he went inside for a moment and emerged with a refill and a beer for himself.He held out the cup and she took it, sipping again before she put it on the table beside the chairs.You were sitting out here when I came, werent you?Yeah.I sit out here every night.Its a habit now.I can see why, she said as she looked around.So, what is it you do these days?Actually, I dont do anything but work on the house right now.It satisfies my creative urges.How can you I mean"  Morris Goldman.My old boss from up north.He offered me a part of the business just as I enlisted, and died before I got home.When I got back to the states, his lawyers gave me a cheque big enough to buy this place and fix it up.She laughed under her breath.You always told me youd find a way to do it.They both sat quietly for a moment, thinking back again.Allie took another sip of tea.Do you remember sneaking over here the night you first told me about this place?He nodded, and she went on: I got home a little late that evening, and my parents were furious when I finally came in.I can still picture my daddy standing in the living room smoking a cigarette, my mother on the sofa staring straight ahead.I swear, they looked as if a family member had died.That was the first time my parents knew I was serious about you, and my mother had a long talk with me later that night.She said to me, Im sure you think that I dont understand what youre going through, but I do.Its just that sometimes our future is dictated by what we are, as opposed to what we want.I remember being really hurt when she said that.You told me about it the next day.It hurt my feelings, too.I liked your parents and I had no idea they didnt like me.It wasnt that they didnt like you.They didnt think you deserved me.Theres not much difference.I know that I always did.Maybe thats why my mother and I always seem to have a distance between us when we talk.How do you feel about it now?The same as I did back then.That its wrong, that it isnt fair.It was a terrible thing for a girl to learn, that status is more important than feelings.Noah said nothing.Ive thought about you ever since that summer, she said.You have?Why wouldnt you think so?She seemed genuinely surprised.You never answered my letters.You wrote?Dozens of letters.I wrote to you for two years without receiving a single reply.She slowly shook her head before lowering her eyes.I didnt know she said finally, quietly, and he knew it must have been her mother checking the mail, removing the letters without her knowledge.It was what he had always suspected, and he watched as Allie came to the same realization.It was wrong of her to do that, Noah, and Im sorry she did.But try to understand.Once I left, she probably thought it would be easier for me to just let it go.She never understood how much you meant to me, and, to be honest.I dont even know if she ever loved my father the way I loved you.In her mind, she was just trying to protect my feelings, and she probably thought the best way to do that was to hide the letters you sent.That wasnt her decision to make, he said quietly.I know.Would it have made a difference even if youd got them?Of course.I always wondered what you were up to.No, I mean with us.Do you think we would have made it?It took a moment for her to answer.I dont know, Noah.I really dont, and you dont either.Were not the same people we were then.Weve changed.Both of us.She paused.He didnt respond, and in the silence she looked towards the creek.She went on.But yes, Noah, I think we would have.At least, Id like to think we would have.He nodded, looked down, then turned away.Whats Lon like?She hesitated, not expecting the question.Bringing up Lons name brought slight feelings of guilt to the surface, and for a moment she didnt know how to answer.She reached for her cup, took another sip of tea, then spoke quietly.Lons handsome, charming and successful.Hes kind to me, he makes me laugh, and I know he loves me in his own way.She collected her thoughts.But theres always going to be something missing in our relationship.She surprised herself with her answer but knew it was true nonetheless.And she also knew by looking at him that Noah had suspected the answer in advance when he asked, Why?She shrugged and her voice was barely above a whisper.I guess I still look for the kind of love we had that summer.Noah thought about what she had said, thought about the relationships hed had since hed last seen her.
