"I can't.After poms I have to go home. "Baghda quit on Saturday and my mom freaked out.Until she hires someone else I have to help out more.He stops and pulls his hand from mine."Shit, Brit.You gonna make some time for me, or what?""You can come over," I offer.78 "So I can watch you take care of your sister?No thanks.Not to be a prick, but I want alone time ...just you and me. ""I know.I do, too. ""What about Friday?"I should be with Shelley, but my relationship with Colin is rocky and I can't let him think I don't want to be with him."Friday works for me. "Before we seal our plans with a kiss, Alex clears his throat in front of us."No PDA.School rules.Besides, she's my partner, dickhead.Not yours. ""Shut up, Fuentes," Colin mutters, then joins Darlene.I put my hand on my hip and glare at Alex."Since when are you so concerned with school rules?""Since you became my chem partner.Outside chemistry, you're his.In chemistry, you're mine. ""Want to find your club and pull me by my hair into the library?"45     "I'm not a Neanderthal.Your boyfriend is the ape, not me. ""Then stop acting like one. "All of the work tables in the library are taken, so we're forced to find a corner in the back of the library in the secluded nonfiction section and sit on the carpet.I set my books down and realize Alex is staring at me, almost as if he stares long enough he might be able to see the real me.No chance of that because I hide my true self from everyone.I stare back, because two can play this game.On the surface he's impermeable, except a scar above his left brow tells the truth ...he's human.His shirt outlines muscles you can get only from manual labor or working out regularly.When my eyes meet his gaze as we're sitting here staring at each other, time stops.Those eyes are piercing mine, and I can swear at this 79 moment he senses the real me.The one without the attitude, without the facade.Just Brittany."What would it take for you to go out with me?"he asks."You're not serious. ""Do I look like I'm jokin'?"Mrs.Peterson wanders by us, saving me from answering."I'm keeping my eyes on you two.Alex, we missed you last week.What happened?""I kinda fell onto a knife. "She shakes her head in disbelief, then moves away to harass other partners.I look at Alex, wide eyed."A knife?You're kidding, right?""Nope.I was cuttin' a tomato, and wouldn't ya know the thing flung up and sliced my shoulder open.The doc stapled me back together.Wanna see?"he asks as he starts pulling up his sleeve.I slap a hand over my eyes."Alex, don't gross me out.And I don't believe for one second a knife flung out of your hand.You were in a knife fight. ""You never answered my question," he says, not admitting or denying my theory about his wound."What would it take for you to go out with me?""Nothing.I wouldn't go out with you. ""I bet if we make out you'll change your mind. ""As if that'll ever happen. ""Your loss. "Alex stretches his long legs in front of him, his chem book resting in his lap.He looks at me with chocolate brown eyes that are so intense I swear they could hypnotize someone."You ready?"he asks.For a nanosecond, as I'm staring into those dark eyes, I wonder what it would be like to kiss Alex.My gaze drops to his lips.For less 46     80 than a nanosecond, I can almost feel them coming closer.Would his lips be hard on mine, or soft?Is he a slow kisser, or hungry and fast like his personality?"For what?"I whisper as I lean closer."The project," he says."Hand warmers.Peterson's class.Chemistry. "I shake my head, clearing all ridiculous thoughts from my overactive teenage mind.I must be sleep deprived."Yeah, hand warmers. "I open my chem book."Brittany?""What?"I say, staring blindly at the words on the page.I have no clue what I'm reading because I'm too embarrassed to concentrate."You were lookin' at me like you wanted to kiss me. "I force a laugh."Yeah, right," I say sarcastically."Nobody's watchin' if you want to, you know, try it.Not to brag, but I'm somewhat of an expert. "He gives me a lazy smile, one that was probably created to melt girls' hearts all over the globe."Alex, you're not my type. "I need to tell him something to stop him from looking at me like he's planning to do things to me I've only heard about."You only like white guys?""Stop that," I say through gritted teeth."What?"he says, getting all serious."It's the truth, ain't it?"Mrs.Peterson appears in front of us."How's that outline coming along?"she asks.I put on a fake smile."Peachy. "I pull out the research I did at home and get down to business while Mrs.Peterson watches."I did some research on the hand warmers last night.We need to dissolve sixty grams of sodium acetate and one hundred millimeters of water at seventy degrees. "81 "Wrong," Alex says.I look up and realize Mrs.Peterson is gone."Excuse me?"Alex folds his arms across his chest."You're wrong. ""I don't think so. ""You think you've never been wrong before?"He says it as if I'm a ditzy blond bimbo, which sets my blood to way past boiling."Sure I have," I say.I make my voice sound high and breathless, like a Southern debutante."Why, just last week I bought Bobbi Brown 47     Sandwash Petal lip gloss when the Pink Blossom color would have looked so much better with my complexion.Needless to say the purchase was a total disaster," I say.He expected to hear something like that come out of my mouth.I wonder if he believes it, or from my tone realizes I'm being sarcastic."I'll bet," he says."Haven't you ever been wrong before?"I ask him."Absolutely," he says."Last week, when I robbed that bank over by the Walgreens, I told the teller to hand over all the fifties he had in the till.What I really should have asked for was the twenties 'cause there were way more twenties than fifties. "Okay, so he did get that I was putting on an act.And gave it right back to me with his own ridiculous scenario, which is actually unsettling because it makes us similar in some twisted way.I put a hand on my chest and gasp, playing along."What a disaster. ""So I guess we can both be wrong. "I stick my chin in the air and declare stubbornly, "Well, I'm not wrong about chemistry.Unlike you, I take this class seriously. ""Let's have a bet, then.If I'm right, you kiss me," he says."And if I'm right?""Name it. "It's like taking candy from a baby.Mr.Macho Guy's ego is about to 82 be taken down a notch, and I'm all too happy to be the one to do it."If I win you take me and the class project seriously," I tell him."No teasing me, no making ridiculous comments. ""Deal.I'd feel terrible if I didn't tell you I have a photographic memory. ""Alex, I'd feel terrible if I didn't tell you I copied the info straight from the book. "I look at the research I'd done, then flip open to the corresponding page in my chem book."Without looking, what does it need to be cooled at?"I ask.Alex is a guy who thrives on challenges.But this time the tough guy is going to lose.He closes his own book and stares at me, his jaw set."Twenty degrees.And it needs to be dissolved at one hundred degrees, not seventy," he answers confidently.I scan the page, then my notes.Then back at the page again.I can't be wrong.Which page did I   "Oh, yeah.One hundred degrees. "I look up at him in complete shock."You're right. ""You gonna kiss me now, or later?""Right now," I say, which I can tell shocks him because his hands go still.At home, my life is dictated by my mom and dad.At school, it's different.I need to keep it that way, because if I have no control in every aspect of my life I might as well be a mannequin."Really?"he asks.48     "Yeah. "I take one of his hands in mine.I'd never be this bold if we had an audience, and am thankful for the privacy of the nonfiction titles surrounding us.His breathing slows as I sit up on my knees and lean into him.I'm ignoring the fact that his fingers are long and rough and that I've never actually touched him before.I'm nervous.I shouldn't be, though.I'm the one in control this time.I can feel him restraining himself.He's letting me make the move, 83 which is a good thing.I'm afraid of what this boy would do if he let loose.I place his hand against my cheek so it cups my face and I hear him groan.I want to smile because his reaction proves I have the power.He's unmoving as our eyes meet.Time stops again.Then I turn my head into his hand and kiss the inside of his palm."There, I kissed you," I say, giving him back his hand and ending the game.Mr.Latino with the big ego got bested by a ditzy, blond bimbo.84 CHAPTER 14 Alex "You call that a kiss?""Yep. "Okay, so I'm in shock the girl put my hand on her creamy cheek.Damn, you'd think I was on drugs by the way my body reacted.She had me totally under her spell a minute ago.Then the pretty witch turned my game around so she was the one with the upper hand.She surprised me, that's for sure.I laugh, deliberately calling attention to us because I know it's exactly what she doesn't want."Shh," Brittany says, hitting me on the shoulder to shut me up.When I laugh louder, she whacks my arm with the heavy chem book.My bad arm.I wince."Ow!"The cut on my biceps feels like a million little bees are stinging it.Cabron me dolio!She bites her Bobbi Brown Sandwash Petal'd frosted bottom lip, which in my opinion looks fine on her.Though I wouldn't mind seeing her in the Pink Blossom color, too."Did I hurt you?"she asks.49     "Yes," I say through gritted teeth as I concentrate on her lip gloss instead of the pain.85 "Good. "I lift my sleeve to examine my wound, which now (thanks to my chem partner) has blood trickling from one of the staples the doc at the free clinic put in it after the fight at the park with the Satin Hoods.Brittany's got a pretty good whack for someone who probably weighs a buck ten soaking wet.She sucks in her breath and scoots away."Oh my God!I didn't mean to hurt you, Alex.Really, I didn't.When you threatened to show me the scar, you lifted your left sleeve. ""I wasn't really gonna show you," I say."I was fuckin' with you.It's okay," I tell her.Geez, you'd think the girl never saw red blood before.Then again, her blood probably runs blue."No, it's not okay," she insists while shaking her head."Your stitches are bleeding. ""They're staples," I correct her, trying to lighten the mood.The girl is even whiter than she usually is.And she's breathing heavy, almost panting.If she passes out, I swear I'm losing the bet with Lucky.If she can't handle a little streak of my blood, how's she gonna handle having sex with me?Unless we're not naked, so she doesn't have to see my various scars.Or if it's dark, then she can pretend I'm someone white and rich.Fuck that, I want the lights on ...I want to feel all of her against me and want her to know it's me she's with and not some other culero."Alex, are you okay?"Brittany asks, looking totally concerned.Should I tell her I was spacing out while thinking about us having sex?Mrs.P.  walks up the aisle with a stern look on her face."This is a library, you two.Keep it down. "But then she notices the small line of blood snaking down my arm and staining my sleeve."Brittany, help him to the nurse.Alex, next time come to school with that thing bandaged. "86 "Don't I get sympathy, Mrs.P. ?I'm bleedin' to death. ""Do something to help mankind or the planet, Alex.Then you'll, get my sympathy.People who get into knife fights don't earn anything from me except disgust.Now go get cleaned up. "Brittany lifts my books off my lap and says in a shaky voice, "Come on. ""I can hold the books," I tell her as I follow her out of the library.I'm pressing my sleeve against the wound, hoping to stop more blood from leaking out.She's walking ahead of me.If I tell her I need help walking because I feel faint, will she believe me and come to my rescue?Maybe I should stumble ...although knowing her she wouldn't care.Right before we reach the nurse's office, she turns around.Her hands are shaking."I'm so sorry, Alex.I di  didn't m  mean  " She's freaking out.If she cries, I won't know what to do.I'm not used to crying chicks.I don't think Carmen cried once during our entire relationship.In fact, I'm not sure Carmen has tear ducts.That turned me on, because emotional chicks scare me.50     "Um ...you okay?"I ask."If this gets around, I'm never going to live it down.Oh, God, if Mrs.Peterson calls my parents I'm dead.Or at least I'll wish I was dead. "She keeps talking and shaking, as if she's a car with bad shocks and no brakes."Brittany?""...and my mom'll blame it on me.It's my fault, I know.But she'll freak out on me and then I'll have to explain and hope she  " Before she can get another word out I yell, "Brittany!"The girl looks up at me with an expression so confused I don't know whether to feel sorry for her or stunned she's rambling and can't seem to stop."You're the one freakin' out," I comment, stating the obvious.87 Her eyes are usually clear and bright, but now they're dull and blank as if she's not all here.She looks down and around and everywhere except directly at me."No, I'm not.I'm fine. ""The hell you are.Look at me. "She hesitates."I'm fine," she says, now focused on a locker across the hall."Just forget everything I just said. ""If you don't look at me, I'm gonna bleed all over the floor and need a fuckin' transfusion.Look at me, dammit. "Her breathing is still heavy as she focuses on me."What?If you want to tell me my life is out of control, I'm already aware of it. ""I know you didn't mean to hurt me," I tell her."Even if you did, I probably deserved it. "I'm hoping to lighten the mood so the girl doesn't have a complete breakdown in the hallway."Makin' mistakes ain't a crime, you know.What's the use in having a reputation if you can't ruin it every now and then?""Don't try and make me feel better, Alex.I hate you. ""I hate you, too.Now please move out of the way so the janitor doesn't have to spend all day moppin' up my blood.He's a relative, you know. "She shakes her head, not believing for an instant the head janitor at Fairfield is a relative.Okay, so he isn't exactly a relative.But he does have family in Atencingo, the same small town where my mom has cousins in Mexico.Instead of moving out of the way, my chem partner opens the door to the nurse's office for me.I think she's functioning even if her hands are still shaking."He's bleeding," she calls out to Miss Koto, the school nurse.Miss Koto has me sit down on one of the examining tables."What happened here?"88 51     I look over at Brittany.She has a worried look on her face, as if she's concerned I might croak right here.I hope to God that's what the Angel of Death looks like before I kick the bucket.I'd be more than happy to go to hell if a face like Brittany's was greeting me."My staples opened up," I say."No big deal. ""And how did that happen?"Miss Koto asks as she wets a white cloth and dabs it on my arm.I hold my breath, waiting for the stinging to recede.I'm also not about to narc on my partner, especially since I'm trying to seduce her."I hit him," Brittany says, her voice hitching.Miss Koto turns around, stunned."You hit him?""By accident," I chime in, not having a clue why I suddenly want to protect this girl who hates me and would probably rather flunk Mrs.P.'s class than have to partner with me.My plans with Brittany are not working.The only feeling she's admitted to having toward me is hatred.But the thought of Lucky on my motorcycle is more painful than the antiseptic crap Miss Koto is now rubbing on my wound.I've got to get Brittany alone if I'm gonna have any chance of saving face and saving my Honda.Does her freakout session mean she really doesn't hate me?I've never seen that girl do anything not scripted or 100 percent intentional.She's a robot.Or so I thought.She's always looked and acted like a princess on camera every time I've seen her.Who knew it'd be my bloody arm that would crack her.I look over at Brittany.She's focused on my arm and Miss Koto's ministrations.I wish we were back in the library.I could swear back there she was thinking about getting it on with me.I'm sporting la tengo dura right here in front of Miss Koto just thinking about it.Gracias a Dios the nurse walks over to the medicine cabinet, Where's a large chem book when you need one?89 "Let's hang Thursday after school.You know, to work on the outline," I tell Brittany for two reasons.First, I need to stop thinking about getting naked with her in front of Miss Koto.Second, I want Brittany to myself."I'm busy Thursday," she says.Probably with Burro Face.Obviously she'd rather be with that pendejo than me."Friday, then," I say, testing her although I probably shouldn't.Testing a girl like Brittany could put a serious damper on my ego.Although I caught her at a time when she's vulnerable and still shaking from seeing my blood.I admit I'm a manipulative asshole.She bites her bottom lip that she thinks is glossed with the wrong color."I can't Friday, either. "My hard on is officially deflated."What about Saturday morning?"she says."We can meet at the Fairfield Library. ""You sure you can pencil me into your busy schedule?""Shut up.I'll meet you there at ten. ""It's a date," I say while Miss Koto, obviously eavesdropping, finishes wrapping my arm with dorky gauze.52     Brittany gathers her books."It's not a date, Alex," she says over her shoulder.I grab my book and hurry into the hallway after her.She's walking alone.The loudspeaker music isn't playing so class is still on."It might not be a date, but you still owe me a kiss.I always collect debts. "My chem partner's eyes go from dull to shining mad and full of fire.Mmm, dangerous.I wink at her."And don't sweat about what lip gloss to wear on Saturday.You'll just have to reapply it after we make out. "90 CHAPTER 15 Brittany One thing in life is certain  I am not making out with Alex Fuentes.Thankfully Mrs.Peterson had us busy doing experiments all week, giving us no time to talk except about who's going to light the Bunsen burner.Although every time I looked at Alex's bandaged arm it reminded me of when I whacked him.I'm trying not to think about him while I gloss my lips for my date with Colin.It's Friday night and we're going to dinner and a movie.After double checking and triple checking myself in the mirror, and attaching the Tiffany's bracelet he gave me for our anniversary last year, I head to the backyard, where my sister is in our pool with her physical therapist.My mom, wearing her pink velour cover up, is lounging on a chaise reading some home design magazine.It's pretty quiet, except for the physical therapist's voice instructing Shelley.Mom puts down her magazine, her face tight and stern."Brit, don't be out past ten thirty. ""We're seeing an eight o'clock movie, Mom.We'll be home after that. "91 "You heard what I said.No later than ten thirty.If you have to leave the movie early to get home on time, so be it.Colin's parents won't respect a girl without a curfew. "Our doorbell rings."That's probably him," I say."You better hurry up and get it.A boy like that won't wait forever, you know. "I rush to the front door before my mom does it for me and makes a fool out of both of us.Colin is standing on our front stoop with a dozen red roses in his hand."For you," he says, surprising me.Wow!I'm feeling stupid for thinking about Alex so much this past week.I hug Colin and give him a kiss, a real one on the lips.53     "Let me put these in water," I say, stepping back.I hum happily as I walk to the kitchen, smelling their sweet fragrance.Putting water in a vase, I wonder if Alex ever brought his girlfriend flowers.Alex probably brings his dates sharp knives as gifts, in case she'll need one when she's out on a date with him.Being with Colin is so ...Boring?No.We're not boring.We're safe.Comfortable.Cute.After cutting the bottoms off the roses and placing them in the vase, I find Colin chatting with my mom on the patio, something I really don't want him doing."Ready?"I say.Colin flashes me his super white million dollar smile."Yep. ""Have her back by ten thirty," my mom calls out.As if a girl with a curfew equals high morals.It's ridiculous, but I look at Shelley and swallow my argument."Sure thing, Mrs.Ellis," Colin responds.92 When we're in his Mercedes, I ask, "What movie are we seeing?""Change in plans.My dad's firm got tickets to the Cubs game.In a suite right behind home plate.Baby, we're goin' to watch the Cubbies. ""How cool.Will we be back by ten thirty?"Because I know without a doubt my mom will be waiting at the door for me."If they don't go into extra innings.Does your mom think you'll turn into a pumpkin or something?"I take hold of his hand."No.It's just that, well, I don't want to upset her. ""No offense, but your mom is strange.She's a hot MILF, but totally off the wall. "I take my hand back."Eww!Colin, you just called my mom a MILF!I'm completely grossed out. ""Please, Brit. "He glances in my direction."Your mom looks more like your twin sister than your mother.She's hot. "She works out so much, I admit her body looks more like a thirty year old's than a forty five year old's.But to think my boyfriend is hot for my mom is plain yuck.At the game, Colin leads me to his dad's corporate suite at Wrigley Field.The box is crowded with people from a bunch of downtown law firms.Colin's parents greet us.His mom hugs me and gives me an air kiss before leaving us to mingle with other people.I watch as Colin talks with the other people in the suite.He's so at home here; he's in his element.He shakes hands, smiles wide, and laughs at everyone's jokes whether they're funny or not."Let's watch the game in the seats over there," he says, leading me to the suite's seats after we get hot dogs 54     and drinks from the food bar."I'm hoping to get an internship at Harris, Lundstrom, and Wallace next summer," he says quietly, "so I gotta get face time with these guys. "93 When Mr.Lundstrom appears next to us, Colin goes into full on business mode.I watch in admiration as he talks with Mr.Lundstrom as if they're old friends.My boyfriend definitely has a knack for schmoozing people."I hear you want to follow in your father's footsteps," Mr.Lundstrom says."Yes, sir," Colin responds, then they start talking about football and stocks and whatever else Colin brings up to keep Mr.Lundstrom talking.Megan calls on my cell and I give her highlights of the game and we talk while I'm waiting for Colin to finish talking to Mr.Lundstrom.She tells me she had the best time at this dance club called Club Mystique that will let in teens.She insists Sierra and I will love it there.At the seventh inning stretch, Colin and I stand and sing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game. "We're totally out of tune, but it doesn't matter because right now it sounds as if the thousands of Cubs fans singing are as out of tune as we are.It feels good to be with Colin like this, having fun together.It makes me think I've been overcritical of our relationship.At nine forty five, I turn to Colin and tell him we need to start heading home even though the game isn't over.He takes my hand in his.I think he's going to excuse himself from his conversation with Mr.Lundstrom.Instead, Mr.Lundstrom calls over Mr.Wallace.As the minutes tick by, I'm getting nervous.There has been enough tension in my house.I don't want to cause more."Colin ...," I say, squeezing his hand.He puts his arm around me in response.At the top of the ninth inning, when it's past ten, I say, "I'm sorry, but Colin has to drive me home now. "94 Mr.Wallace and Mr.Lundstrom shake Colin's hand, then I pull him out of the park."Brit, do you know how hard it is to get an internship at HL&W?""At this point, I don't care.Colin, I needed to be home by ten thirty. ""So you'll be home at eleven.Tell your mom we got stuck in traffic. "Colin doesn't know what my mom is like when she's in one of her moods.Thankfully I've been able to avoid bringing him around the house often and if he comes over, it's just for a few minutes or less.He has no clue what it's like when my mom goes off on me.We pull into my driveway not at eleven, but closer to eleven thirty.Colin is still pumped about the possible internship at HL&W while listening to the after game recap on WGN radio.55     "I gotta go," I tell him, leaning over for a quick kiss."Stay here a few minutes," he says against my lips."We haven't fooled around in, like, forever.I miss it. ""Me, too.But it's late. "I give him a look of apology."We'll have more nights together. ""Hopefully sooner rather than later. "I walk into my house, prepared to be yelled at.Sure enough, my mom is standing in the foyer with her arms crossed."You're late. ""I know.I'm sorry. ""What do you think, that I make up arbitrary rules?""No. "She sighs."Mom, I really am sorry.We went to a Cubs game instead of a movie, and the traffic was terrible. ""Cubs game?All the way in the city?You could have been mugged!"95 "We were fine, Mom. ""You think you know it all, Brit, but you don't.For all I know you could've been lying dead in a city alley and all along I thought you were at a movie.Check your purse to see if any money or your ID is missing. "I open my purse and check the contents of my wallet, only to appease her.I hold up my ID and cash."It's all here. ""Consider yourself lucky.This time. ""I'm always careful when I go to the city, Mom.Besides, Colin was with me. ""I don't need excuses, Brit.Did you not think it would be nice to call and tell me about the change in plans and that you were going to be late?"To have her yell at me over the phone, and then again when I got home?No way.But I can't tell her that."I didn't think about it," is all I say."Do you ever think about this family?It's not all about you, Brittany. ""I know that, Mom.I promise next time I'll call.I'm tired.Can I just go to bed now?"She dismisses me with a wave of her hand.On Saturday morning I wake up to my mom's screaming.Throwing the covers back, I rush out of bed and run down the stairs to see what the commotion is all about.Shelley is in her wheelchair, which is pushed up to the kitchen table.Food is all over her mouth and splattered on her shirt and pants.She looks like a little kid instead of a twenty year old.56     "Shelley, if you do it again you're going to your room!"my mom yells, then places a bowl of her blended food on the table in front of her.96 Shelley swipes it on the ground.My mom gasps, then narrows her eyes at Shelley."I'll deal with it," I say, rushing to my sister.My mom has never hit my sister.But my mom's frustration is in overdrive, which stings just the same."Don't baby her, Brittany," Mom says."If she doesn't eat, she'll be tube fed.Would you like that?"I hate when she does this.She'll talk about the worst possible scenario and not work on fixing what's wrong.When my sister looks at me, I see the same frustration in her eyes.My mom points her finger at Shelley, then at the food on the floor."That's why I haven't taken you to a restaurant in months," she says."Mom, stop," I say."You don't need to escalate the situation.She's already upset.Why make it worse?""And what about me?"Tension starts building, beginning inside my veins and spreading to my fingertips and toes.It bubbles up and bursts with such force I can't keep it inside any longer."This isn't about you!Why does it always go back to how everything affects you?"I scream."Mom, can't you see she's hurting?Instead of yelling at her, why don't you spend the time figuring out what's wrong?"Without thinking, I take a washcloth and kneel beside Shelley.I start wiping her pants clean."Brittany, don't!"my mom yells out.I don't listen.I should have, though, because before I can move away Shelley's hands go in my hair and she starts pulling.Hard.With all the commotion, I forgot my sister's new thing is pulling hair."Ow!"I say."Shelley, please stop!"I'm trying to reach around and push down on her knuckles like her doctor told us to do to make her 97 release her grasp, but it's no use.I'm in the wrong position, crouched at Shelley's feet with my body twisted.My mom is swearing, droplets of food are flying, and my scalp feels raw already.Shelley isn't loosening her hold, even though my mom is trying to pull her hands away from my hair."Knuckles, Mom!"I yell, reminding her what Dr.Meir suggested.Holy crap, how much hair has she pulled out?It feels like an entire section of my head is bald.After my reminder, my mom must have pressed hard enough on her knuckles because my hair is released.Either that, or Shelley pulled out whatever chunks she'd grabbed.Falling onto the floor, I immediately put a hand to the back of my head.Shelley is smiling.57     My mom is frowning.And tears come to my eyes."I'm taking her to Dr.Meir, right now," my mom says, shaking her head at me so I'm aware she's blaming me for the situation spiraling out of control."This has gone on long enough.Brittany, take your father's car and go to O'Hare to pick him up.His flight comes in at eleven.It's the least you can do to help. "98 CHAPTER 16 Alex I've been waiting at the library for an hour.Okay, so it's been an hour and a half.Before ten, I sat outside on the cement benches.At ten I came inside and stood looking at the display case, pretending to be interested in upcoming library events.I didn't want to look overly eager to see Brittany.At ten forty five I sat on the couches in the teen section, reading my chem book.Okay, so my eyes skimmed the pages even if no words registered.Now it's eleven.Where is she?I could just go hang with my friends.Hell, I should go hang with my friends.But I have a stupid urge to know why Brittany blew me off.I tell myself it's an ego thing, but in the back of my mind I'm worried about her.She'd hinted, during her freakout in front of the nurse's office, that her mom isn't a candidate for a Mother of the Year award.Doesn't Brittany realize that she's eighteen now and can leave home if she wanted?If it's that bad, why stay?Because her parents are rich.If I left home, my new life wouldn't be so different from my old 99 one.With a girl who lives on the north side, a life lacking designer towels and a maid to pick up after you is probably worse than death.I've had enough of standing here waiting for Brittany.I'm going to her house, to confront her on why she ditched me.Without thinking it through, I get on my motorcycle and head to the north side.I know where she lives ...in the big honkin' white house with pillars flanking the front.I park my bike in her driveway and ring her doorbell.I clear my throat so I don't choke on my words.Mierda, what am I gonna say to her?And why am I feeling all insecure, like I need to impress her because she'll judge me?Nobody answers.I ring again.Where's a servant or butler to answer the door when you need one?Just as I'm about to give up and slap myself with a big dose of what the fuck do I think I'm doing, the door opens.Standing before me is an older version of Brittany.Obviously her mom.When she takes one look at me, her disappointing sneer is obvious.58     "Can I help you?"she asks with an attitude.I sense either she expects me to be part of the gardening crew or someone going door to door harassing people."We have a 'no soliciting policy' in this neighborhood. ""I'm, uh, not here to solicit anythin'.My name's Alex.I just wanted to know if Brittany was, uh, at home?"Oh, great.Now I'm mumbling uh's every two seconds."No. "Her steely answer matches her steely glare."Do you know where she went?"Mrs.Ellis closes the door halfway, probably hoping I won't peek inside and see her valuables and be tempted to steal them."I don't give out information on the whereabouts of my daughter.Now if you'll excuse me," she says, then closes the door in my face.100 I'm left standing in front of the door like a complete pendejo.For all I know, Brittany was behind the door instructing her mom to get rid of me.I wouldn't put it past her to play games with me.I hate games I can't win.I walk back to my bike with my tail between my legs, wondering if I should feel like a kicked dog or an angry pit bull.101 CHAPTER 17 Brittany "Who's Alex?"Those are the first words my mom asks me after I arrive back home from the airport with my dad."He's a guy from school I'm partnered with for chemistry," I answer slowly.Wait one minute."How do you know about Alex?""He was here after you left for the airport.I sent him away. "As if my brain is synapsing, reality hits me.Oh, no!I forgot to meet Alex this morning.Guilt sets in as I think about him waiting for me at the library.I was the one who didn't trust him to show, but I'm the one who flaked.He must be furious.Ugh, I'm feeling sick."I don't want him near the house," she says."The neighbors will start talking about you. "Just like they talk about your sister, I know she's thinking.One day I hope to live in a place where I don't have to worry about neighbors gossiping."Fine," I tell her.59     "Can't you change partners?"102 "No. ""Did you try?""Yes, Mom.I did.Mrs.Peterson refuses to reassign partners. ""Maybe you didn't try hard enough.I'll call the school on Monday and make them  " I whip my attention to her, ignoring the stinging, throbbing pain in the back of my head from where my sister ripped out the chunk of hair."Mom, I'll handle it.I don't need you calling the school and making me feel like a two year old. ""Did that boy Alex teach you how to talk to your mother without respect?All of a sudden you can open a mouth to me because you're partnered with that boy?""Mom  " I wish my dad was here to intervene.But he went directly to his study to check his e mails right after coming home.I wish he'd act as a referee instead of sitting on the sidelines."Because if you start hanging out with trash like that, people will consider you trash.That's not how your father and I have brought you up. "Oh, no.Here comes the lecture.I'd rather eat live fish, scales and all, than hear this right now.I know the meaning behind her words.Shelley's not perfect, so I have to be.I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself."Mom, I get it.I'm sorry. ""I'm only trying to protect you," she says."And you throw it back in my face. ""I know.I'm sorry.What did Dr.Meir say about Shelley?""He wants her to come twice a week for some evaluations.I'm going to need your help taking her. "103 I don't talk to her about Ms.Small's policy about missing pom practice, because there's no use in having both of us stressed.Besides, I want to know why Shelley is lashing out just as much as she does ...if not more.Thankfully, the phone rings and my mom turns to answer it.I hurry into my sister's room before my mom can call me back for more discussions.Shelley is sitting by her personalized computer in her room, tapping at the keyboard."Hi," I say.Shelley looks up.She's not smiling.I want her to know I'm not upset with her, because I know she didn't mean to hurt me.Shelley might not even understand her own motivations for doing things."Want to play checkers?"60     She shakes her head."Watch television?"Another shake."I want you to know I'm not mad at you. "I go closer, careful not to get my hair within reach, and rub her back."I love you, you know. "No answer, no head nodding, no verbal approximation.Nothing.I sit on the edge of her bed and watch as she plays with her computer.Every once in a while I make comments, so she knows I'm here.She might not need me now, but I wish she did.Because I know a time will come when she does need me and I won't be there for her.That scares me.A little while later I leave my sister and head for my room.I search my Fairfield High student directory for Alex's phone number.Flipping open my cell, I dial his number."Hello?"a boy's voice answers.I take a deep breath."Hi," I say."Is Alex there?""He's out. "104 "Quienes?"I hear his mom asking in the background."Who is this?"the boy asks me.I realize I'm chipping my nail polish off as I'm talking."Brittany Ellis.I'm, uh, a friend of Alex's from school. ""It's Brittany Ellis, a friend of Alex's from school," the boy relates to his mom."Toma el mensaje," I hear her say."Are you his new girlfriend?"the boy asks.I hear a thump and an "Ow!"and then he says, "Can I take a message?""Tell him Brittany called.Here's my number ... "105 CHAPTER 18 Alex 61     Right now I'm standing inside the warehouse where the Latino Blood hang every night.I just finished my second or third cigarette  I've stopped counting."Drink some beer and stop lookin' depressed," Paco says, throwing me a Corona.I told him about Brittany blowing me off this morning and all he's done is shake his head at me as if I should have known better than to go to the north side.I catch the can in one hand, but toss it right back."No, thanks. ""Quetienes, ese?This stuff not good enough for you?"It's Javier, probably the stupidest Latino Blood.El buey can control his liquor about as well as he controls his drug use, which isn't much.I challenge him without saying a word."Just kiddin', man," a drunken Javier slurs.Nobody wants to get into it with me.During my first year as a member of the Latino Blood, in a clash with a rival gang, I proved my worth.As a little kid, I thought I could save the world ...or at least save my family.I'll never be in a gang, I told myself when I was old enough to join one.I'll protect mi familia with my two hands.On the south side of 106 Fairfield, you're either in a gang or against them.I had dreams of a future then; deluded dreams that I could stay away from gangs and still protect my family.But those dreams died along with my future the night my father was shot twenty feet from my six year old face.When I stood over his body, all I could see was this red spot spreading on the front of his shirt.It reminded me of a bull's eye, except the target kept getting larger and larger.The next thing I knew, he gasped and that was it.My dad was dead.I never held him or touched him.I was too afraid.In the days that followed, I didn't say a word.Even when the police questioned me, I couldn't speak.They said I'd been in shock and my brain didn't know how to process what happened.They were right.I don't even remember what the guy looked like who shot him.I've never been able to seek revenge for my father's murder, even though every night I replay the shooting in my head trying to put the pieces together.If I could only remember, the fucker would pay.My memory of today is clear, though.Being stood up by Brittany, her mother scowling at me ...things I want to forget are stuck in my brain like glue.Paco downs half his beer in one gulp, not even caring when it dribbles down the sides of his mouth and onto his shirt.When Javier is talking to other guys, Paco says to me, "Carmen really screwed you up, you know. ""And how's that?""You don't trust chicks.Take Brittany Ellis  " I curse under my breath."Paco, on second thought toss that Corona over here. "After I catch it, I down the beer and crush the can against the wall after it's empty.62     "You may not want to listen, Alex.But you're gonna hear me out no 107 matter if you're drunk or not.Your loose talkin', hickey makin', sexy Latina ex girlfriend Carmen stabbed you in the back.So you're makin' a complete U turn by stabbin' Brittany in the back. "I'm reluctantly listening to Paco as I grab another beer."You callin' my chem partner a U turn?""Yeah.But it's gonna backfire big time, man, 'cause you actually like the girl.Admit it. "I don't want to admit it."I only want her for the bet. "Paco laughs so hard he stumbles and ends up sitting on the warehouse floor.He points to me with the beer still in his hand."You, my friend, are so good at lyin' to yourself you're actually startin' to believe the bullshit comin' out of your mouth.Those two girls are total oppo sites, man. "I grab another beer.As I flip the top open, I think about the differences between Carmen and Brittany.Carmen's got sexy, dark, mysterious eyes.Brittany's got seemingly innocent, light blue ones you can practically see through.Will they be that way when I make love to her?Shit.Make love?What the hell possessed me to think about Brittany and love in the same sentence?I am seriously losing it.I spend the next half hour ingesting as much beer as possible.I'm feeling good enough to not think ...about anything.A familiar female voice cuts through the numbness."Wanna party at Danwood Beach?"she asks.I'm staring into chocolate eyes.Although my brain is clouded and I'm dizzy, I know enough to register that chocolate is the opposite of blue.I don't want blue.Blue confuses me too much.Chocolate is straightforward, easier to deal with.There's something not right here, but I can't pinpoint it.And when Chocolate's lips are on mine, I don't care about anything except 108 wiping Blue from my mind.Even if I remember Chocolate as being bitter."Si," I say when my lips separate from hers."Let's party.Vamos a gozar!"An hour later, I'm standing in water up to my waist.It makes me long to be a pirate and sail the lonely seas.Of course in the back of my hazy mind I know I'm gazing across Lake Michigan and not an ocean.But right now I'm not thinking clearly, and being a pirate seems like a damn good option.No family, no worries, nobody with blond hair and blue eyes glaring at me.Arms like tentacles wrap around my stomach."What're you thinkin' about, novio?""Becoming a pirate," I murmur to the octopus who just called me her boyfriend.The octopus's suction cups are kissing my back and moving their way around to my face.Instead of scaring me, it feels good.I know this octopus, these tentacles.63     "You be a pirate, I'll be a mermaid.You can rescue me. "Somehow I think I'm the one who needs rescuing because I feel like she's drowning me with her kisses."Carmen," I say to the brown eyed octopus turned sexy mermaid, suddenly aware that I'm drunk, naked, and standing in water up to my waist in Lake Michigan."Shh, let go and enjoy. "Carmen knows me well enough to make me forget about real life and help me focus on the fantasy.Her hands and body wrap around me.She feels weightless in the water.My hands go to the places I've been before and my body presses against familiar territory, but the fantasy doesn't come.And when I look back at the shore, the sounds of my rowdy friends remind me we have an audience.My octopus/mermaid loves an audience.109 I don't.Grabbing my mermaid's hand, I start walking back to shore.Ignoring the comments from my friends, I tell my mermaid to get dressed as I pull on my jeans.When we're dressed, I take her hand once again and we weave through the crowd until we find a vacant space to sit among our friends.I lean against a big rock and stretch out my legs.My ex girlfriend straddles me, as if we'd never broken up and she'd never cheated on me.I feel trapped, caught.She takes a drag of something stronger than a cigarette and passes it to me.I look at the small, wrapped joint."This ain't amped, is it?"I ask.I'm wasted, but the last thing I need is narcs in my system on top of the marijuana and beer.My goal is to be numb, not dead.She puts it to my lips."It's just Acapulco gold, novio. "Maybe it'll work to wipe out my memory for good and make me forget shootings and ex girlfriends and bets of having hot sex with a girl who thinks I'm the scum of the earth.I take the joint from her and inhale.My mermaid's hands move up my chest."I can make you happy, Alex," she whispers, so close I can smell the alcohol and mota on her breath.Or it might be mine, I'm not sure."Give me another chance. "Being high and drunk makes me confused.And when the image of Brittany and Colin with their arms around each other at school yesterday forms in my head, I pull Carmen's body closer.I don't need a girl like Brittany.I need hot and spicy Carmen, my lying little mermaid.110 64     CHAPTER 19 Brittany I convinced Sierra, Doug, Colin, Shane, and Darlene to go to Club Mystique tonight, the club Megan told me about.It was in Highland Grove, on the beach.Colin doesn't like to dance, so I ended up dancing with the rest of the gang and even this one guy named Troy, who was an amazing dancer.I think I picked up some moves I can introduce to our pom squad.Now we're at Sierra's, headed for the private beach behind her house.My mom knows I'm sleeping at Sierra's tonight, so I don't have to worry about checking in.While Sierra and I are setting up blankets on the sand, Darlene is lagging behind with the guys, who are unloading stashed beer and bottles of wine from the back of Colin's car."Doug and I had sex last weekend," Sierra blurts out."Seriously?""Yeah.I know I wanted to wait until we were in college, but it just happened.His parents were out of town, and I went over to his place and one thing led to another and we just did it. ""Wow.So, how was it?""I don't know.To be honest it was kinda weird.But he was really 111 sweet afterward, asking me over and over if I was okay.And at night he came to my house and brought me three dozen red roses.I had to lie to my parents and say they were for our anniversary.I couldn't very well say the flowers were in celebration of his taking my virginity.What about you and Colin?""Colin wants to have sex," I tell her."Every guy over the age of fourteen wants to have sex," she says."It's their job to want to do it. ""I just...don't want to.At least, not now. ""Then it's your job to say no," she says, as if it's that easy.Sierra isn't a virgin anymore, she'd said yes.Why is it so hard for me to say yes, too?"How will I know when it's the right time?""You sure as hell won't be asking me about it.I guess when you're totally ready you'll want to do it with no reservations or questions.We know they want to have sex.It's up to you to make it happen.Or not.Listen, the first time wasn't fun or easy.It was kind of sloppy and most of the time I felt stupid.Opening yourself up to making mistakes and being vulnerable is what makes it beautiful and special with the person you love. "Is that why I haven't wanted to do it with Colin?Maybe deep down I don't love him as much as I thought.Am I even capable of loving someone so much that I open myself up to being vulnerable?I really don't know."Tyler broke up with Darlene today," Sierra whispers to me."He started dating a girl in his dorm. "If I didn't feel sorry for Darlene before, now I do.Especially because she thrives on attention from guys.It 65     fuels her self esteem.It's no wonder she was totally all over Shane tonight.112 I watch as the rest of the guys and Darlene come into view and set blankets down on the beach.Darlene grabs Shane's shirt and pulls him aside."Let's go make out," she tells him.Shane is all too ready to honor her request.Pulling her away from him, I lean close and say so only she can hear, "Don't fool around with Shane. ""Why not?""Because you don't like him like that.Don't use him.Or let him use you. "Darlene pushes me away."You seriously have a demented view of reality, Brit.Or maybe you want to point out everyone else's imperfections so you stay the Queen of Perfect. "That's not fair.I don't want to point out her flaws, but if I see her going on a self destructive path, isn't it up to me as her friend to stop her?Maybe not.We're friends, but not super close friends.The only one I let close enough is Sierra.How dare I give Darlene advice when she can't reciprocate?Sierra, Doug, Colin, and I sit on blankets and talk about the last football game in front of a bonfire we make with sticks and old pieces of wood.We laugh, remembering the missed plays and imitating the football coach who yelled at the players from the sidelines.His face gets all red and when he's really upset spit flies out of his mouth as he yells.Players get out of the way so they don't get sprayed.Doug does a hilarious imitation of him.It feels good sitting here with my friends and Colin, and for a while I forget about my chemistry partner, who's been occupying my thoughts lately.After a while, Sierra and Doug go for a walk and I'm leaning 113 against Colin in front of the fire, the light giving the sand around us a bright glow.Darlene and Shane have hooked up for the night despite my advice against it and aren't back yet.I grab the bottle of Chardonnay the guys brought.The boys have been drinking beer and the girls have been drinking wine because Sierra hates the taste of beer.I bring the bottle to my lips and finish it off.I'm feeling buzzed, but I probably need to drink an entire bottle myself in order to feel completely carefree."Did you miss me this summer?"I ask, leaning into Colin as he smoothes down my hair.It's probably a mess.I wish I was drunk enough not to care.Colin takes my hand in his and leads it to his crotch.He lets out a slow, moaning breath."Yeah," he says into my neck."Lots. "When I take my hand back, his arms snake around to my front.He squeezes my boobs like they're water balloons.I've never minded Colin's touch before, but now I'm annoyed and creeped out by his roving hands.I shrug out of his grasp.66     "What's wrong, Brit?""I don't know. "I really don't know.Things with Colin seem strained since school started.And thoughts of Alex keep invading my head, which is annoying me more than anything.I reach over and grab a beer."It feels forced," I tell my boyfriend as I open the can and take a sip."Can't we sit here without fooling around?"Colin lets out a long, dramatic deep breath."Brit, I want to do it. "I try and down the entire can in one gulp, but end up spewing out some of it."You mean now?"Where our friends can see us if they turn around?"Why not?We've waited long enough. "114 "I don't know, Colin," I say, really scared to be having this conversation although I knew it was coming."I guess ...I guess I thought it would happen naturally. ""What can be more natural than doing it outside, in the sand?""What about condoms?""I'll pull out. "That doesn't sound romantic at all.I'll be freaking out the entire time and worrying about getting pregnant.
