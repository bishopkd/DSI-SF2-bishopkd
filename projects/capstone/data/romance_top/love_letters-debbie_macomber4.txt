Extra sleep seems to have the opposite effect than what one would expect.Maggie appreciated him inventing a convenient excuse for her less than charming behavior.It was almost as if she wanted to pick a fight so she could throw the telephone conversation in his face.She didnt know what was wrong with her to be this irrational.She had to credit Roy with keeping his cool; it couldnt have been easy.To her surprise, there wasnt a waiting list and they were seated in a booth within minutes after their arrival.How about a margarita?Roy suggested.I know how you love licking the salt off the rim of the glass.Sure, she said after a short hesitation, doing her best to be agreeable.The last time shed overindulged in alcohol the results had been disastrous.One thing was certain, there wouldnt be a second time.Shed sworn off drinking to excess ever again.One drink with her husband would be fine, though.The waiter came for their drink order and within only a few minutes their margaritas were delivered along with a basket of tortilla chips and a small bowl of salsa.The menu was several pages long, and Maggie took her time reading over the selections.She probably took longer than necessary.Roy made his decision almost right away and set the menu aside.You arent going to order arroz con pollo?he asked, which was what she generally liked.No.Again, the word came out clipped and abrupt.She tried to soften its effect with a halfhearted smile.Not tonight.Im in the mood for something different.Apparently so, Roy murmured under his breath.She glanced up and found him studying her.Rather than meet his gaze, she quickly looked away.She reached for a chip, dipping it into the salsa.Right away, she noticed her husbands frown.Rarely did she allow herself to indulge in the chips.For her it was far too easy to fill up on the greasy carbs.It wasnt like her, and Roy knew it.The waiter returned for their food order and she blindly asked for a number three without even knowing what the combination was.Again, Roy frowned, and he gave the waiter his own choice.He waited until the other man was out of earshot.Okay, Maggie, whats up?I beg your pardon?You heard me.Something is bothering you.Her automatic response was to deny it, but she couldnt make herself do it.She spread the paper napkin across her lap and kept her head lowered.You were on the phone when I woke.Yes.So?You were going to read, remember?He stretched out his arms and took hold of his drink with both hands, giving the impression he was relaxed.Maggie knew otherwise.I got tired of reading.She took a moment to digest his answer.While she could get lost in a novel, it wasnt that way with Roy.He was accustomed to physical activity.Sitting for any length of time was foreign to him, which was one reason he found traveling by plane uncomfortable.Looking up, Maggie held his gaze.This was the very conversation shed wanted to avoid.Her husband knew her far too well and wouldnt allow this to pass.He was determined to force it out of her.Keeping her back straight, she boldly met his eyes.Who was it on the phone?Maggie watched as his fingers tightened around the margarita glass until it was a wonder it didnt snap in half and send the alcohol and ice sliding across the tabletop.What makes you ask?His question was deceptively calm.I heard part of the conversation.Did you, now?She swallowed hard.Yes  the part about you not being able to talk later and how that wouldnt work.And you automatically assumed I was speaking to Katherine.Refusing to answer him, Maggie lowered her gaze.I wasnt.That was Alex on the phone, the project manager.Theres another problem on the job site.Alex did what he could, but he needed my advice.He offered one suggestion, but I know what its like to deal with these labor unions, and quickly realized his idea wouldnt work and told him so.Oh.As for the part when I told him I wouldnt be able to talk later  His voice was tight and barely controlled.When she did look up, Maggie noticed how hed clenched his jaw.Yes, she urged, needing to know.It was about preserving this weekend with you.He wanted to call me tomorrow, and I told him he couldnt.Id promised you Id do my best to leave the job behind.Oh.Maggie felt horrible.A hard knot formed in her throat and her bottom lip started to quiver.She bit into it in order to keep it still until she regained her composure.I owe you an apology  again.Why didnt you ask me right away?he demanded.Her voice wobbled when she spoke.I  was  afraid.Afraid?Of what?Surely he knew, surely he understood.Of the decision I would be forced to make if it was Katherine.He reached across the table and took hold of her hand.Ill say it again, Maggie, but this is the last time.Its over.I will never speak, text, Facebook, tweet, or use any other form of communication with Katherine again.You have my word of honor.Unable to speak, she nodded several times.Can we put this behind us?Please?Again she nodded, but frankly she didnt know if it was possible.She could forgive him and could only pray that in time she would learn to forgive herself.11     The inn was empty and silent.My guests were out for the evening and the house felt cavernous.I felt a bit lost and out of sorts with nothing pressing to occupy my time.The incident with Pauls sweatshirt lingered in my mind.As if that wasnt enough, I realized Id forgotten what Pauls voice sounded like.No.Not that, too.Determined to try, I closed my eyes and strained to remember, yet as hard as I tried I couldnt pull the memory of his voice back into my head.His scent was gone, and his voice was no longer part of my memory.It hit me then as strongly as the moment I got word that my husbands helicopter had gone down in a fiery crash: I had lost Paul.He was gone from me.Never again would he be a part of my life, this side of heaven.I was accustomed to living without my husband.When he was deployed we communicated every day.Although he was literally half a world away, we were together in spirit and in heart.His death had come as a harsh blow, nearly crippling me with grief and heartache.I clung to each memory, to every detail, treasuring each one, holding onto them, clenching them in my fist, determined to keep them as close as I could, and now they were slipping away despite all my efforts.As the months progressed, Id found a fragile peace with my husbands death.But now I realized it was a lost cause.His sweatshirt, the sound of his voice.This was more than I could bear, more than I dared let my mind dwell onotherwise, Id break into tears.As I did most evenings, I walked through my small flower garden, checking on my roses.I needed the distraction more than ever.I clipped a few and arranged them in a vase for the inns foyer.When I finished, I watered my vegetable patch.My tomatoes were coming along nicely, and the pumpkins, although green, showed promise for later in the fall.The snap peas and green beans were coming into their own.Both the spinach and leaf lettuce grew in profusion.I thoroughly enjoyed my small garden space along the south side of the house.I had Mark to thank for it.He was the one whod turned up the earth for me.Itd been no small task, especially with his leg in a cast.Itd taken several days and patience on both our parts.I found a few ready to eat tomatoes, so I picked those, plus a large batch of spinach, and brought both vegetables into the kitchen.I hadnt eaten dinner and decided to make a batch of Italian wedding soup.I had most of the ingredients on hand, and what I couldnt find Id substitute with something else.Thirty minutes later I added the small meatballs Id made and frozen weeks earlier into the simmering soup.The chicken broth had come from the freezer as well.I preferred to make my own.Seeing how well it was simmering, I placed a lid on the soup, and I decided to sit on the porch, giving the ingredients and flavors time to meld.In other circumstances, I would have shared the bounty with Mark.When hed worked on preparing my vegetable garden, Id promised that Id give him a portion of whatever the land yielded.The sad fact was, I wasnt sure Mark would appreciate seeing me for a while.After hed delivered the lumber for the gazebo, hed conveniently disappeared.Not that I blamed him.If past history was anything to go by, I might not see him again for a week or more.Mark generally stayed away for a few days when I got emotional about Paul or when I drilled him for information about himself.One of the things I appreciated most about Mark was the fact that he didnt hold onto hard feelings for long.Rover let out a bark and then raced down the porch steps, running to the very edge of the property.Rover, I shouted after him.For the most part, my rescue dog stayed close by my side.After losing him that one afternoon not so long ago, I kept close watch over him.It wasnt long before I realized what had gotten Rovers attention.His tail started to wag and Mark Taylor rounded the corner of my property.He looked disgruntled, his face marred by a barely disguised frown.Hey, whats up?I asked him.Ill tell you in two words: Peter McConnell.Id forgotten the other man was making himself at home at Marks place for the night.Id been surprised when Mark had made the offer to house Peter, seeing how protective Mark was of his privacy.Even now I wasnt entirely sure what had prompted the generosity.One thing was evident: My handyman didnt consider Peter a friend.My guess was that Mark had been looking to protect me, and I suspected it was from more than the other mans inability to pay for the nights stay.I was surprised to see him and at the same time grateful.I hadnt been looking forward to spending the evening alone.I thought you told me you didnt know where Peter had gone.I didnt, he grumbled.I take it hes returned.Mark snickered loudly, making his feelings clear.He settled right down in my favorite chair, reached for the television remote, and ate his way through the contents of my refrigerator.In other words, he drove you out of your own house.Not exactly.Oh?Clearly, more had taken place that Mark wasnt telling me.Okay, if you must know, I left because otherwise I was going to punch him.He had the gall to tell me I should go buy him a six pack.As far as Im concerned, hes lucky hes in full possession of his teeth.The man doesnt lack for nerve.I hid a smile and changed the subject.Ive got a kettle of soup on.Most everything in it came from the garden.Are you interested?You serving anything else with that soup?Like what?A sandwich?Cookies?No, interrogation?I smiled, wanting to reassure him.Youre free to enjoy your soup without me hounding you with questions.He studied me skeptically, as if he wasnt sure he should believe me.What kind of soup is it?Your favorite.Again, he frowned.How do you know?I like more than one kind of soup.You told me.When?I dont remember.Good grief, talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth.He broke into a rare wide smile, his eyes twinkling.I didnt know what his game was.Do you want the soup or not?The smile made him look almost boyish.Guess you dont like being hounded by questions any more than I do.Hed made his point.Touch.He followed me into the kitchen, and when I removed the lid from the kettle, he took an appreciative sniff.Its that spinach and meatball concoction you make, right?Right.I picked the spinach just an hour ago, and its called Italian wedding soup.I know; I just dont happen to like the name.Thats ridiculous.The soups good, he assured me, but the reference to weddings is enough to turn off most men.Oh, for the love of heaven.I shook my head and brought down two deep bowls.I had a loaf of Asiago cheese bread Id picked up earlier in the day at the bakery when I met Peggy and planned to use for breakfast.It went really well with poached eggs, but even better with soup.I could easily change my breakfast menu to stuffed French toast, another favorite.I cut off a couple thick slices and set them aside.How about eating outside?I suggested.Early in the summer, Id purchased a small wicker table with two chairs for the deck.I ate out there most evenings.It was perfect to sit in the fading sunshine with a view of the water and the mountains and absorb the beauty and shadows of the setting sun, reflected on the water.Mark regarded me as if Id suggested we do something illegal.Whats wrong with the kitchen table?Nothing, but why eat inside when its such a lovely evening?His frown darkened.Are you going to light a candle and put on music, too?Hardly.He couldnt seriously believe I wanted to make this meal of soup and bread into some kind of romantic interlude.Still, he hesitated.Fine, you eat in the kitchen, but Im going onto the deck.I picked up my bowl and bread and headed toward the porch.Faithful companion that he was, Rover followed me.Id taken my seat and had reached for my spoon when Mark appeared.Dont look so worried, I chided.The truth was, I enjoyed teasing him.You have nothing to fear from me.He grumbled under his breath, but whatever he said was indecipherable.After his first taste of the soup, he nodded appreciatively.This is good.Thank you.It comes as a real surprise what a good cook youve turned out to be.Oh?He had the most backhanded way of giving a woman a compliment.You being a former banker and all, he added.It took restraint on my part not to roll my eyes.What does that have to do with anything?It only makes sense, he argued.Women in high powered positions dont have time to cook.Mark, I said, holding up my hand, stop.You dont know what youre talking about, and youre only digging yourself in deeper.Okay, fine, whatever.Thank you.It was times like these that I wondered how I could consider Mark a friend.Mary Smith, he said.I glanced up, uncertain Id heard him correctly.What about Mary Smith?Shed been a guest earlier that spring.He shrugged one shoulder.Shes an example of a high powered businesswoman.I knew the minute I met her that shed be the type who couldnt find her way around a kitchen with a road map.He must have recognized the fire in my eyes, because he quickly added, Just as an example.Ive said my piece; I wont say anything more.Thats probably wise on your part.What did you do the rest of the afternoon?I asked Mark, making a determined effort to change the subject.You mean after I delivered the lumber?I nodded and tore off a bit of my bread to dip in the soups rich broth.We both know I couldnt go in the house with Peter taking over and eating everything in sight.A plague of locusts leaves more behind.It might be a good idea to count the silverware tomorrow morning.I was joking, but Mark took me seriously.I will.Hed already eaten the entire bowl of soup.Mind if I help myself to seconds?By all means.Most of the time the leftovers got tossed anyway.He excused himself.Rover lifted his head and watched him go but stayed at my side.Mark disappeared into the kitchen and returned in short order.I could eat that entire kettle.Take some home with you, I offered.He chuckled and shook his head.Trust me, it would be gone by morning.Id forgotten about Peter.Right.Ill save it for you.I appreciate it.His attention centered on the soup and then out of the blue he said, I worked on the cradle.Mark had completely lost me.He must have read the question in my eyes, because he explained.You asked me what I did this afternoon.You and that cradle, I muttered.The man remained a complete mystery.He had paying customers clamoring for his services, and yet he chose to work on a project no one had commissioned or paid him to build.Hed started on it shortly after we met and worked on it off and on whenever the spirit moved him.He wagged his finger at me.Youve got that look again.What look?That disapproving one when I say or do something you dont agree with.I dont have a look.Yes you do.You got it just now when I mentioned the cradle.Okay, fine.I wasnt about to argue with him.Its a big project and Id like to get it finished.He seemed to feel the need to justify how he spent his time to me, and he was right.But dont you have other jobs, ones people are actually paying you for?I argued.Yes.So?So, people are waiting.Ill get to them all in good time.Its nothing you need to worry about.I wasnt chastising you.Yes you were.You might not have said anything, but you were thinking it.The man drove me to the edge.So now you can read my mind?In this instance, yes.If he wasnt so right I might have argued further.I brushed off his comment and said, Think what you want.He returned to his soup.The cradle relaxes me.I beg your pardon?You might not have noticed, but I get uptight every now and again.No way.I made sure my tone mocked him.Im not joking, Jo Marie.I dont know whatll happen to that cradle or where it will go, but I enjoy working on it.Over the months, Id seen that cradle several times.Mark had designed it himself.The headboard was intricately carved and was sure to be a showpiece for whoever purchased it.Like I said, working on it settles my nerves, and there was a lot that needed settling after you started hounding me for information.Playing host to that bloodsucking Peter McConnell isnt helping any, either.You didnt need to invite Peter to spend the night, you know.Again he muttered something I couldnt understand.What did you say?I asked.Nothing.Yes you did, I pressed.He seemed to be weighing his response.I dont trust McConnell and I wasnt comfortable with him being at the inn.I can handle myself, Mark.His look said he doubted it.McConnells a sleazebag, and I didnt want him anywhere close to you.Ah, I said, and placed my hand over my heart.You actually care.I care about a lot of things.So you do care about me?I was beginning to enjoy this.Sure I do, he said with a frown, but not the way youre suggesting.Im crushed.Yeah, right.For a moment, I wasnt sure if he was teasing or not.His wagging finger reappeared.Youve got another look.Another one?I cant read this one as easily as the first, but Ive seen it before; I just havent figured out what it means yet.When you do, let me know.He nodded, taking me seriously.Id eaten about half of my soup and all of the bread.Carbohydrates were my downfall, always had been and probably always would be.Leaning back in the wicker chair, I sighed, taking in the scenery around me.It was nights like this that I missed Paul the most.Hed been heavy on my mind all day.Despite my best effort, a deep sense of loss filled me.Mark grew silent, too, gazing off into the distance.It came to me that I owed him an apology.Im sorry about earlier.I know.You know?Youre sorry about a lot of things, Jo Marie.You think I cant read that in you?He was beginning to worry me with his ability to see through me.Youre sorry you dont have your husband with you any longer.He died much too soon.He was right about that.Youre sorry you wont have children.How he knew that was beyond me.Anything else?I asked, a bit defensively.He nodded.Nothing that needs mentioning.If you look into your heart youll recognize more.We tend to do that, you know, when weve suffered a significant loss.We sat in silence for a long time.The only sounds were those drifting up from the waterfront and the birds overhead.And then there was an occasional snore from Rover.After a few moments, I broke the peace.Im glad you stopped by, I told him.Mark didnt say anything right away, and then, in a low voice, said, I am, too.We looked across the table at each other and smiled.12     By the time Ellie Reynolds arrived back at the inn she was walking on a cloud; her feet hardly felt like they touched the ground.For the movie with Tom, shed silenced her cell phone.Because her mother was sure to make a nuisance of herself, Ellie had kept it off the entire night.Theyd kissed several times during the movie and afterward, too.Itd felt natural and good to be in his arms.She experienced none of the awkwardness she had with other relationships.Tom was polite and sweet.She treasured that he was as nervous about meeting her as shed been about seeing him for the first time.He couldnt seem to stop looking at her as if she was the most beautiful woman in the world.It was after midnight before she got back to Rose Harbor Inn.Everyone else had settled down for the night.Being careful not to wake the others, Ellie let herself in the front door, locking it behind her, and then headed up the stairs to her room.Shed been with Tom the entire evening, and the hours had sped past.When it came time to part, hed been as reluctant as she was to say good night.It helped to know theyd be meeting again in the morning, right after breakfast.Tom wanted to take her out on Puget Sound in his friends sailboat.Ellie looked forward to the excursion but not nearly as much as she did to seeing Tom again.This weekend, her visit to Cedar Cove was a test.After spending time together theyd decide if they wanted to pursue this relationship.Ellie already knew what she wanted, and she was fairly certain Tom felt the same things she did.Even now she felt like she needed to pinch herself to make sure this happiness was real and not part of her imagination.Sitting on the edge of her bed, she closed her eyes and sighed.This was destined to be one of the most incredible nights of her life.And she had a full two days more to be with Tom before she had to return home.Home.The word alone was enough to cause her shoulders to droop.No doubt by now her mother was frantic with worry because she hadnt heard from her.Knowing her mother, Ellie felt sure Virginia would assume that Ellie had been abducted and shed never hear from her again.With only a slight hesitation, Ellie reached into her purse and looked at her phone for the first time in several hours.Sure enough, there was another message from her mother.Ellie didnt bother to read it.It wasnt necessary; she already knew what it said.Forcing herself back into the real world, she selected her mothers number.No doubt her mother would be sitting up in bed, awaiting Ellies call.Virginia would be afraid to fall asleep until she was assured her daughter was safe and secure.Sure enough, Virginia answered on the first ring.Eleanor?Oh thank God.You dont know how worried Ive been.Yes, I know.She kept her voice flat, devoid of emotion.Why didnt you answer my text?her mother demanded, as though itd been a matter of life and death.If youd sent me a simple Im okay it would have made a world of difference.Sorry, Mom.Well  tell me how your date with Tom went, her mother said, slowly releasing her breath as though a heavy burden had been lifted from her heart.Is he everything you expected?Yes.Ellie purposely kept her responses as brief as possible.Sweetie, I want details.Oh Mom  Ellie didnt want to dilute the magic of the evening by relating the specifics to her mother, who was sure to dissect the evening into tiny parts.Did he kiss you?her mother asked, her voice dipping slightly, as if this was a fact to be shared in confidence.Mom!Im twenty three years old.You make it sound like Im thirteen and just went to my first boy girl party.I know, I know, sorry, Virginia apologized.I guess no matter how old you are, youll always be my little girl.That was the problem in a nutshell.Her mother continued to treat her like a child in need of care and protection.I like him, Mom, so much.Tom is kind and thoughtful and funny.Your father was all those things, too, Virginia whispered, her voice tightening.Ellie tensed.So I should be cautious, right?No, her mother protested.Well, yes, you should be cautious, but then you should do that with any man you meet.What I meant was that its very easy to fall in love with a man when hes all the things you mentioned.But theres a dark side to him, too, Ellie murmured, not wanting to hear yet another forewarning, one that most likely wont show itself until after were married.Ellie, sweetheart, quit putting words in my mouth.I didnt mean to imply anything of the sort.But you were thinking it.Ellie was only voicing the very comment her mother had made previously when shed first learned about Ellies growing relationship with Tom.Well, yes, her mother confirmed.Everyone has faults, and character weaknesses.When we first meet others we tend to put our best foot forward, so to speak.Im sure you did, and Tom, too.You both want to make a good impression, right?Ellie had no option but to agree.Its only later that our faults become apparent.And by then youre married and pregnant and youre stuck in a relationship that makes you miserable and he doesnt understand your needs or love you the way you feel you deserve to be loved and youre so unhappy you dont know if you will survive, Ellie said in one long breath, stopping only when she needed to breathe again.A shocked silence reverberated from the other end of the line.Youre putting words in my mouth again.What Im doing, Mom, is repeating all the warnings youve given me through the years.I said all that?Virginia asked, sounding as if she found it impossible to believe.That and more.The truth was, Ellie had heard the story of how her father had done the family wrong so often she could repeat it verbatim.Oh dear, Virginia murmured in a rush, as though stunned.Can I go now?Ellie had fulfilled her obligation and called to reassure her mother.It was late and shed had a long day.Well, yes, of course, Virginia said, with such deep disappointment that Ellie felt instantly guilty.But you really didnt answer any of my questions, her mother added.Its late, Mom.Her mother hesitated.Is there something you dont want me to know about Tom?she asked, in a gentle way that lent itself toward expressing confidences.I am your mother, and, sweetie, there isnt anything you cant tell me.Did he try to get you into bed?Mom, no.Hes not like that.You raised me, so why dont you trust my judgment?I do, but when I met Scott my head was in the clouds.All common sense deserted me and  And then it was too late.Eleanor, please dont.Her mothers tone told Ellie she was quickly growing impatient with her, but Ellie couldnt make herself stop.For once she refused to allow her mothers unfortunate past to cloud her own future.Good night, Mom, she said, letting her know the conversation was over.Shed done her duty as a daughter, and while she loved and respected her mother, she was more than ready to become her own woman and make her own decisions.Good night, sweetie, she said, and then, as if she had to know, she rushed the question, Are you seeing Tom tomorrow?What did her mother think?Ellie hadnt come this far to spend the weekend in her room reading a romance novel, although she often devoured books in the genre.Yes, Mom, Im seeing Tom on Saturday.And then, for shock value, she added, Hes taking me boating on Puget Sound.Her mother sucked in a breath.Ellie paused, awaiting a tirade of dire warnings, but thankfully, and to her amazement, none came.You arent going to remind me of how many people drown every year?she asked, half in jest.This was commonly how her mother approached the subject of Ellie being on the water.No.Toms boat has life jackets, doesnt it?Mom!Okay, sorry, youre right.Youre an adult and capable of taking care of yourself.Thank you!The least her mother could do was credit her with some intelligence.Ellie had never been a daredevil and had no desire to drive fast cars, leap out of airplanes, or go bungee jumping.Probably the most dangerous task shed ever undertaken was opening a tin can with a handheld opener!Will you be out on the water all day?No.In the afternoon, Tom said he has a surprise for me.What kind of surprise?It wouldnt be a surprise if I knew what it was, would it?Her mother gave a small, halfhearted laugh.Youre right, it wouldnt.Night, Mom.Hadnt she wished her mother that once already?Night.Her mothers voice was heavy with reluctance.At the last moment, Ellie thought of something important she wanted to say.Mom, she said urgently.Yes, honey.How eager she sounded, how excited.Ellie felt a little uneasy with the fib.I thought you should know Ill be out of cell phone coverage all day.That laugh again.Very funny, Ellie.Im serious, Mom.Okay, message received.Ill wait for your call and I wont bother you.Ellie was grateful.I appreciate that.Now, for the third time, good night.Good night.Ellie ended the call before she or her mother found yet another reason to stay on the line.As she went to plug her phone into the charger, she noticed another text message.If it was from her mother, Ellie would be tempted to scream.Instead, the text was from Tom.Thank you for a lovely night.Morning cant come soon enough.It couldnt come fast enough for Ellie, either!Her phone alarm woke her at seven, and it felt like shed been asleep only a few minutes.As happy and excited as shed been, itd taken her a long time to fall asleep.Her inclination was to pull the sheet over her shoulders and go back to sleep.She might have given in to the temptation until she remembered Tom would be picking her up in less than two hours.Leaping out of bed, she headed for the shower, eager to dig into her day.Another day with Tom.By the time shed showered, dressed, and fussed with her hairand fuss she didbreakfast was ready.With a smile as bright as the August morning, Ellie practically floated down the stairs.She wore a pair of cropped white pants and a blue and white loose fitting tank top with a blue pair of Toms shoes.She hoped Tom would find it amusing that shed chosen that brand of shoes.Then, in case it was chilly on the water, she brought along a white cotton cardigan, which she had draped over her shoulders.She found Jo Marie in the kitchen.Im not early, am I?Not at all, the innkeeper assured her.Are you ready for a cup of coffee?More than ready.Ellie didnt feel like herself in the morning until she had a cup of coffee.Theres fresh squeezed orange juice set out on the table, along with blueberry muffins.My favorite, Ellie said, heading in that direction.Happy as she felt, she nearly skipped into the other room.Im fixing cream cheesestuffed French toast this morning, Jo Marie called out after her.Juice and muffins are all I need, Ellie said.It wasnt a good idea to go out on Puget Sound with a full stomach.She wasnt sure if she was prone to seasickness or not, but it wasnt worth taking the chance.After a couple moments, Jo Marie joined her in the breakfast room.I suspect the Porters wont be down for quite some time yet, she said.Ellie sat and poured herself a glass of orange juice.Did everything go well last night?Jo Marie asked.Ellie couldnt have held back a smile any more than the little Dutch boy could have held back the water from a leak in the dam.It was an amazing night.After dinner we went to a movie and then we walked along the waterfront and went for coffee at the Pancake Palace and talked and talked and talked.Weve spent part of nearly every day communicating in one form or another; youd think there wouldnt be much left for us to say.But you did?Yes.It shocked us both when we saw it was midnight.A faraway look came over the innkeeper, as if her thoughts had drifted to another time and another place.It was like that when Paul and I first met.Ellie remembered hearing, although she couldnt remember whod mentioned it, that Jo Marie was a widow.Perhaps it was the handyman shed chatted with briefly the day before.So you know what its like to meet someone and know right away that he might possibly be the one?Ellie asked.Jo Marie nodded.I do.Paul and I met at a Seahawks game.Do you enjoy watching football?Ellie asked.She had never been excited about the sport until shed learned that Tom had played football in high school and college.He was on the wait list to get Seahawks season tickets.It went without saying that if their relationship continuedand she prayed it wouldshed need to learn the basics of the game.Already Tom had volunteered to tutor her.Both Paul and I were football fanatics, Jo Marie said, and then, as if it was painful to talk about the husband shed lost in Afghanistan, she changed the subject.The Sounders are Seattles soccer team, and a lot of folks attend those games as well.Ive never been, but Ive heard its quite an experience.While talking over coffee the night before, Tom had mentioned the Sounders and his hope that one day theyd be able to see a game together.Ellie was willing to give it a try, never having attended a professional sporting event.Toms athletic, Ellie said, taking the first bite of her muffin.It was delicious, far and away better than any shed ever tasted.Wow, these are great.Oh thanks.I got the recipe from a friend of mine, Peggy Beldon.The blueberries came from her garden, which reminds me, I need to pick up blueberries at the farmers market today.Ellie would love to visit the market, with its booths displaying homemade crafted goods, fresh fruit, and vegetables.She hoped theyd be back in time from their boating trip so shed get the chance.Shed ask Tom about it.Glancing out the window, Ellie saw Toms car pull into the parking area by the inn.She looked at her watch and saw that he was a few minutes early, which told her he was as eager to see her as she was to see him.Rover must have heard the car door close, because the dog hurried to the front door.Its Tom, Ellie explained.Hes a bit early.Invite him in for breakfast, Jo Marie told her.Ive got plenty.What a thoughtful thing to do.I will, thank you.Tom hadnt made it up the front steps before Ellie opened the door.For just an instant they stood and stared at each other as if even now it was impossible to believe they were together.He broke the trance first.Morning.Good morning.Come on in.Jo Marie invited you to have coffee and a blueberry muffin.Theyre really good.Great.I was in such a rush to get here and didnt take time to eat breakfast.Ellie had felt that same happy anticipation.Tom joined her at the table, and she noticed that he had dark lines beneath his eyes.Didnt you sleep well?she asked.I didnt, he admitted.I was up practically the entire night.Is something troubling you?she asked.His smile seemed forced as he shook his head.Not a solitary thing.Then he wrapped his hand around the back of her neck and touched her forehead to his own.Something was troubling him, something he didnt want to tell her, and Ellie didnt have a single clue what it might be.13     Roy was still asleep when Maggie woke Saturday morning.Their argument from the afternoon before kept circling in her mind.Years ago, while they were college students, Roy had written her a love letter.Shed kept it all these years and reread it from time to time.His letter had been the turning point in their courtship.At the time theyd been dating steadily and were deeply in love.Maggie could easily see them marrying one day after she graduated.Roy had met her parents and shed met his.The future seemed pretty much decided for them.Then Roy had gone out with some friends from his frat house.Hed told her it was a poker match and that he needed guy time.It wasnt a big deal until pictures of Roy with a couple of nearly naked women had turned up on the Internet.Apparently, thered been very little card playing that night, and then through the grapevine Maggie learned that this little get together with the guys had happened at a local strip club.And it wasnt the first time.As far as Maggie was concerned, the incident settled their future.Roy wasnt the man shed thought he was.When the Internet photos made the rounds on campus, Maggie had been deeply embarrassed and equally saddened.She really didnt feel she could marry a man who got his thrills in strip clubs.The fact that hed lied to her about what hed be doing raised a huge red flag.Theyd argued.Roy claimed it was all in fun and didnt mean anything.As for the lie, it was a little white one he told so she wouldnt get upset.In actuality, he was protecting her.It didnt mean anything; he was letting off steam after cramming for his finals.He downplayed his role as if it meant nothing and she was making an unnecessary fuss.His friends werent having problems with their girls, so Maggie should be willing to let it go, too.Yes, the photos were embarrassing, but all the hoopla would die down soon enough.Maggie had been shocked by his attitude.He simply didnt get it.In his eyes, hed done nothing wrong.It was all supposed to be in fun.His rationalization had stunned her.Rather than argue, she knew what she had to do, and that was to end the relationship.To that point, it was the hardest decision shed ever made.With tears in her eyes, she broke up with Roy.At first he didnt believe she meant it.He sent her flowers and met her after class, sang to her in public, and bought her a huge teddy bear.It took almost a month for him to realize she was serious.It about killed her to walk away, but she felt she had no choice.Roy had showed her a side of himself that she could never condone or accept.Then Roys letter arrived.He didnt use flowery language or attempt to convince her to reconsider their breakup.Hed basically written to say good bye.Dear Maggie,  I hope youll read this letter.Its taken me nearly a month to write it.Ive forgotten what version this is, not that it matters.What is important is that you believe me when I tell you that I mean every word.When you broke up with me, I couldnt believe it.I wasnt sure what I thought.You were angry.I understood that.Frankly, I was angry, too.Those pictures embarrassed me, but I didnt let anyone know because it was too important for me to be cool about it.So I pretended it wasnt any big deal, only it was.It was a very big deal.It took me a couple weeks to realize you were serious about breaking up with me.We were finished.That made me angry, too, and then sad and sick with what I knew Id lost.I wasnt easy to live with during that time.In fact, if it wasnt so close to graduation, I think I might have gotten kicked out of my fraternity.Youre well aware of everything I did to get you to change your mind.You stood by your word, though, and that took courage and determination on your part.I assumed, at first, that you were simply being stubborn.It took me far longer than it should have to realize there was much more involved than your pride.When all my efforts to convince you to take me back failed, I was at a loss.It was time for soul searching.I spent a lot of time in my room, basically feeling sorry for myself, before it hit me what youd been trying so hard to get through this thick head of mine.You love me  loved me, past tense.I screwed that up for good and I dont have anyone to blame but myself.I know youve moved on and are dating other guys now and I accept that.Its what I deserve.The point of this letter is to say I get it now.I understand why you made the decision you did, and I realize it couldnt have been any easier for you than it was for me.I lied to you about where I was and what I was doing.Not just that one night but multiple times.Itd seemed innocent enough.What you didnt know wouldnt hurt you.I was with the guys and we were doing what guys do, which is stupid, I know.But its far more than me misleading you into believing I was playing poker.Its a matter of character.You expected more of me and I failed us both.In a few days Ill graduate and be leaving WSU to join my dad in his construction business.Thank you for everything, Maggie, and I mean that.Youve encouraged me to be a better man, a man of integrity and principle.The kind of man who would make a good husband and father, the kind of man you deserve.You are wise not to accept anyone less.These have been painful lessons because of the high price I paid to learn them.They cost me losing you.Its unlikely that we will see each other again, and thats probably for the best.And while its hard to accept your decision, I want to thank you.It might not mean anything to you now, but its important that you know I genuinely love you.I will always love you.If at any time you need help, Ill come.You can count on me.If youve gotten this far in reading my letter, then I want to thank you for taking the time.Good bye, my love.Forever yours,  Roy    When the letter had first arrived, Maggie had read it through four or five times without stopping, taking in every word, soaking it into her heart.Then shed started to weep.Her friends didnt know what had happened or what Roy could have said to cause this reaction.He had no idea how miserable shed been, how heartbroken.Maggie had contacted him and they had sat in Starbucks for two hours talking.Following their talk, Maggie felt that Roy had been sincere.Hed meant what hed said in his letter.Even then, Maggie wasnt sure reconciling would be right for either of them, and said so.When they left the Starbucks, theyd gone in opposite directions.As she left Roy, Maggie had a change of heart.She loved Roy and he loved her.She wanted them to try again.By the time she reached Roy, she was astonished to find that he had tears in his eyes.He didnt speak, and she didnt, either.They simply reached for each other and hugged, both weeping, overwhelmed with emotion.By the end of the summer, following graduation, they were engaged.Roys letter had changed everything.If ever she needed reassurance of his love it was now, which was why shed brought the letter with her on this trip.Her husband stirred and he rolled onto his back and stared up at the ceiling.Morning, Maggie whispered, and bent down to kiss him.He moved his head so that her lips bounced against his cheek instead of his lips.So that was the way it was going to be.She stiffened and climbed out of bed.Bracing herself, she decided she had no option but to face this head on.You told me yesterday that you didnt want to talk about what happened.Youre right, I dont.His words were unyielding, as if written in stone.I dont, either   Good, then its a closed subject.He rolled over and presented her with a clear picture of his back.Maggie debated how far she should press the matter.It was clear that unless they addressed this open wound, their marriage would never heal, never recover.It would be only a matter of time before it disintegrated entirely.What time is breakfast?Roy asked, tossing aside the covers and sitting on the edge of the mattress.Again with his back to her.Not until eight or nine, I believe.Then we should get downstairs, dont you think?No, she breathed, keeping her voice low for fear it would tremble with emotion.I think we need to air this once and for all.Roy pretended she hadnt spoken.Any idea of where youd like to go today?I was thinking we could drive to Mount Saint Helens and visit the site of the eruption.She decided to change the subject entirely.Do you know I kept the letter you wrote me in college after we broke up?she asked.Roy glanced over his shoulder at her.In fact, I brought it with me.Here?he asked, frowning.Why would you do that?She walked around the bed so she could face him.I read it every now and again when were going through a rough patch just to be reassured you still love me.To her, every word of that letter had vibrated with love.She hesitated, wanting a confirmation of his love and at the same time fearing his answer.Still, shed rather know his feelings now than waste time by kicking a dead horse, or whatever that saying was.I wrote that years ago.He said it as if to discount the letter.Do you still mean what you wrote, Roy, or did my  mistake ruin that forever?Do you love me?His short hesitation nearly destroyed her.Of course I do.Im here, arent I?Maggie slumped back onto the bed next to him, struggling not to break down as she buried her face in her hands.He tentatively touched her shoulder and she heard the regret in him as he spoke.Maggie, please, dont.It rips my heart out to see you cry.I meant what I said in that letter, then and now.Its just hard for me to accept  to think of you being with another man.Pulling herself together, Maggie inhaled a deep, calming breath and forced herself to be still.You wont talk to me.What are we doing now?he demanded, none too gently.Lets go back to that night, please, just this once, clear the air  we need to do this, Roy, please.No, he all but shouted at her.I want to put it behind us.We can do that, she murmured, but one day itll catch up with us, and my guess is that it wont take long.
