Just as before, surrender weighted my body, leaving me languid.Are you okay?Gideon asked harshly as I sagged against him.Should I stop?NoDont stop.He pushed fractionally deeper and I clenched around him, a helpless reaction to the feel of something gliding across tender tissues.Youre snug and scorching hot, he murmured.And so soft.Does it hurt?No.Please.More.Gideon withdrew to his fingertip; then slid in to the knuckle, slow and easy.I quivered in delight, astonished by how good it felt, that teasing bit of fullness in my rear.Hows that?he asked hoarsely.Good.Everything you do to me feels good.He withdrew again, glided deep again.Leaning forward, I thrust my hips back to give him easier access and pressed my breasts against his chest.His fist in my hair tightened, pulling my head back so he could take my mouth in a lush, wet kiss.Our open mouths slid across each other, growing more frantic as my arousal built.The feel of Gideons finger in that darkly sexual place, thrusting in that gentle rhythm, had me rocking backward to meet his inward drives.Youre so beautiful, he murmured, his voice infinitely gentle.I love making you feel good.Love watching an orgasm move through your body.Gideon.I was lost, drowning in the powerful joy of being held by him, loved by him.Four days alone had taught me how miserable Id be if we couldnt work things out, how dull and colorless my world would be without him in it.I need you.I know.He licked across my lips, making my head spin.Im here.Your cunts trembling and tightening.Youre going to come for me again.With shaking hands, I reached between us for his cock, finding it hard.I lifted the layers of my underskirts so I could insert him into my drenched sex.He slid in a few inches, our standing positions preventing deeper penetration, but the connection alone was enough.I wrapped my arms around his shoulders, burying my face in his neck as my knees weakened.His hand left my hair, his arm clasping my back and holding me close.Eva.The tempo of his finger thrusts quickened.Do you know what you do to me?His hips nudged against mine, the wide crest of his penis massaging a sweetly tender spot.Youre milking the head of my dick with those hungry little squeezes.Youre going to make me come for you.When you go off, Im going with you.I was distantly aware of the helpless noises spilling from my throat.My senses were overloaded by Gideons scent and the heat of his hard body, the feel of his cock rubbing inside me and his finger pumping into my rear.I was surrounded by him, filled with him, blissfully possessed in every way.A climax was building in force, pounding through me, pooling in my core.Not just from the physical pleasure but from the knowledge that hed been willing to take a risk.Once again.For me.His finger stilled and I made a sound of protest.Hush, he whispered.Someones coming.Oh God!Magdalene came in earlier and saw us.What if she told   Dont move.Gideon didnt let me go.He stood just as he was, filling me front and back, his hand caressing the length of my spine and smoothing my dress down.Your skirts hide everything.With my back to the rooms entrance, I pressed my flaming face into his shirt.The door opened.There was a pause then, Is everything all right?Christopher.I felt awkward being unable to turn around.Of course, Gideon said smoothly, coolly in control.What do you want?To my horror, he resumed the push and withdrawal of his finger.Not with the deep strokes of before, but slow shallow thrusts that didnt disturb my skirts.Already aroused to a fever pitch and hovering on the verge of orgasm, my nails dug into his neck.The tension in my body from having Christopher in the room only ramped up the erotic sensations.Eva?Christopher asked.I swallowed hard.Yes?Are you okay?Gideon adjusted his stance, which moved his cock inside me and bumped his pelvis against my pulsing clit.Y yes.Were justtalking.About.Dinner.My eyes closed as Gideons fingertip grazed the thin wall separating his penis from his touch.If he nudged my clit again, Id come.I was too wound up to stop it.Gideons chest vibrated against my cheek as he spoke.Wed be done sooner if youd go, so tell me what you need.Moms looking for you.Why?Gideon shifted again, rocking into my clit at the same moment he gave a quick, deep thrust of his finger into my rear.I climaxed.Afraid of the wail of pleasure that wanted out of me, I sank my teeth into Gideons hard pectoral.He grunted softly and started coming, his cock jerking as it pumped thick spurts of scorching semen into me.The rest of the conversation was lost beneath the roar of my blood.Christopher said something, Gideon replied, and then the door shut again.I was lifted to sit on the armrest and Gideon started thrusting between my spread thighs, using my body to rub out the rest of his orgasm, growling in my mouth as we finished off the rawest, most exhibitionistic sexual encounter of my life.Afterward, Gideon led me by the hand to a bathroom, where he lightly soaped a washcloth and cleansed between my legs before he paid the same attention to his cock.The way he took care of me was sweetly intimate, demonstrating yet again that as primal as his desire for me was, I was precious to him.I dont want us to fight anymore, I said quietly from my perch on the counter.He tossed the washcloth down a concealed laundry chute and refastened his fly.Then he came to me, brushing his cool fingertips down my cheek.We dont fight, angel.We just have to learn not to scare the hell out of each other.You make it sound so easy, I grumbled.To call either of us virgins would be ridiculous, yet emotionally thats just what we were.Fumbling in the dark and too eager, completely out of our depths and self conscious, trying to impress and missing all the subtle nuances.Easy or hard, doesnt matter.Well get through this because we have to.He pushed his fingers through my hair, restoring order to the disheveled strands.Well discuss when we get home.I think Ive discovered the crux of our problem.His conviction and determination soothed the restlessness Id been feeling the last few days.Closing my eyes, I relaxed and enjoyed the tactile delight of having my hair played with.Your mother seemed startled that Im a blonde.Did she?My mother was, too.Not about me being a blonde, I qualified.That youd be interested in one.Was she?Gideon!Hmm?He kissed the end of my nose and ran his hands down my arms.Im not the type you usually go for, am I?His brow arched.I have one type: Eva Lauren Tramell.Thats it.I rolled my eyes.Okay.Whatever.What does it matter?Youre the woman Im with.It doesnt matter.Im just curious.People dont usually stray from their preferred type.Stepping between my legs, he put his arms around my hips.Lucky for me that I fit your type.Gideon, you dont fit any type, I drawled.Youre in a class by yourself.His eyes sparkled.Like what you see, do you?You know I do, which is why we really should get out of here before we start screwing like minks again.Pressing his cheek to mine, he murmured, Only you could blow my mind in a place thats always made my skin crawl.Thank you for being exactly what I want and need.Oh, Gideon.I wrapped my arms and legs around him, holding him as close to me as possible.You came here for me, didnt you?To take me away from this place you hate.Id walk into hell for you, Eva, and this is pretty damn close.He exhaled harshly.I was about to go to your apartment and drag you away with me when I learned youd come here.You have to stay away from Christopher.Why do you keep saying that?He seems very nice.Gideon pulled back, sifting my hair through his fingers.His eyes stayed fiercely locked to mine.He takes sibling rivalry to the extreme, and hes unstable enough to make him dangerous.Hes reaching out to you because he knows he can hurt me through you.You have to trust me on this.Why was Gideon so suspicious of his half brothers motives?He had to have a good reason.It was yet another thing he didnt fully share with me.I do trust you.Of course I do.Ill keep my distance.Thank you.Catching me by the waist, he lifted me off the counter and set me on my feet.Lets grab Cary and get the hell out of here.We made our way back outside with my hand in his.I was uncomfortably aware that wed been gone a very long time.The sun was going down.And I was panty less.My ruined boy shorts were presently stuffed into the front pocket of Gideons jeans.He glanced at me as we entered the marquee.I shouldve told you before.You look gorgeous, Eva.That dress is amazing on you and so are those fuck me red heels.Well, clearly they work.I bumped my shoulder into him.Thank you.For the compliment?Or the fucking?Hush, I admonished, flushing.His dark velvet laugh turned every female head in hearing distance and some of the mens, too.Placing our linked hands at the small of my back, he pulled me close and smacked a kiss on my mouth.Gideon!His mother glided toward us with sparkling eyes and a wide smile on her lovely face.Im so happy youre here.She looked like she might hug him, but his posture altered subtly, charging the air around him with an invisible field of power that encompassed me as well.Elizabeth drew to an abrupt halt.Mother, he greeted her with all the warmth of an arctic storm.You can thank Eva for my being here.Ive come to take her away.But shes having a good time, arent you, Eva?You should stay for her sake.Elizabeth looked at me with a plea in her eyes.My fingers flexed around Gideons hand.He came first, that was never in question, but I couldnt help but wish I knew the story behind his coldness toward a mother who seemed to love him.Her adoring gaze slid over the face that had shades of her own, drinking in every feature hungrily.How long had it been since the last time shed seen him in person?Then I wondered if maybe shed loved him too much  Revulsion made my spine stiffen.Dont put Eva on the spot, Gideon said, rubbing his knuckles against my tense back.Youve gotten what you wanted youve met her.Perhaps youll both come to dinner later this week?His only answer was an arched brow.Then his gaze lifted, luring my attention to follow it.I found Cary emerging from what appeared to be a hedgerow maze with a very recognizable pop princess on his arm.Gideon gestured him over.Oh, not Cary, too!Elizabeth protested.Hes the life of the party.I thought you might like him.Gideon bared his teeth in something that was too sharp to be a smile.Just remember that hes Evas friend, Mother.That makes him mine as well.I was hugely relieved when Cary joined us, breaking the tension in his easygoing way.I was looking for you, he said to me.I was hoping youd be ready to go.I got that call I was expecting.Looking into his sparkling eyes, I knew Trey had reached him.Yes, were ready.Cary and I walked around to say our good byes and offer our thanks.Gideon remained at my side like a possessive shadow, his demeanor calm but markedly aloof.We were all walking toward the house when I spotted Ireland off to the side staring at Gideon.I stopped and looked up at him.Go get your sister so we can say good bye.What?Shes standing to your left.I looked to our right to hide my prodding from the young girl whom I suspected might hero worship her eldest brother.He gestured Ireland over with a brusque wave of his hand.She took her time ambling over, her pretty face schooled into an expression of militant boredom.I looked at Cary with a shake of my head, remembering those days all too well.Listen.I squeezed Gideons wrist.Tell her youre sorry you two didnt get to catch up while you were here and she should call you sometime, if she wants.Gideon shot me an arch look.Catch up on what?Rubbing his biceps, I said, Shell do all the talking if given a chance.He scowled.Shes a teenage girl.Why would I give her a chance to talk my ear off?I pushed onto my tiptoes and whispered in his ear, Because Ill owe you one.Youre up to something.He eyed me warily for a moment; then pressed a hard kiss to my lips with a growl.So well leave it open and say you owe me more than one.Quantity to be determined.I nodded.Cary rocked back on his heels and twirled one index finger around another in a sign meaning wrapped around your finger.Only fair, I thought, since he was wrapped around my heart.I was surprised when Gideon accepted the keys to the Bentley SUV from one of the valets.You drove?Wheres Angus?Day off.He nuzzled against my temple.I missed you, Eva.I settled into the front passenger seat, and he shut the door behind me.As I secured my seat belt, I saw him pause by the hood, making eye contact with two men dressed in black who waited beside a sleek black Mercedes sedan at the end of the drive.They nodded and got in the Benz.When Gideon pulled out of the Vidal driveway, they followed directly behind us.Security detail?I asked.Yes.I took off fast when I was told you were here, and they lost the tail for a while.Cary went home with Clancy, so Gideon and I headed straight to the penthouse.I found myself getting turned on from watching Gideon drive.He handled the luxury vehicle the way he handled everything confidently, aggressively, and with skillful control.He drove fast but not recklessly, weaving easily over the curves and straightaways of the scenic route back to the city.There was almost no traffic until we hit the gridlock of Manhattan.When we arrived at his apartment, we both went straight into the master bathroom and undressed for a shower.As if he couldnt stop touching me, Gideon washed me from head to toe; then he dried me with a towel and wrapped me in a new robe of embroidered teal silk with kimono sleeves.He finished by pulling a pair of similarly hued drawstring silk pants out of a drawer for himself.Dont I get panties?I asked, thinking about my drawer of sexy underwear.No.Theres a phone hanging on the wall in the kitchen.Hit speed dial one and tell the man who answers that I want him to pick up double my usual dinner order from Peter Luger.All right.I headed out to the living room and made the call; then I had to search for Gideon.I found him in his home office, a room I hadnt been in before.I didnt get a good look at the space at first because the only lighting came from an angled picture light on the wall and a barristers lamp on his polished wood desk.Plus my eyes were more interested in focusing on him.He looked utterly sensual and compelling sprawled in his big black leather chair.He held a tulip glass of some liquor that he warmed between his hands and the beauty of his flexing biceps sent tingles racing through me, as did the tight lacing of muscles on his abdomen.His gaze was on the wall illuminated by the picture light, which snagged my attention, too.I was startled when I saw the art a huge collage of blown up photos of him and me: the picture of our kiss on the street outside the gyma shot of us from the press gauntlet at the advocacy dinnera candid of the tender aftermath of our fight in Bryant Park  The focal point was the image in the center that had been taken while I slept in my own bed, lit only by the candle Id left burning for him.It was an intimate voyeuristic shot, one that said more about the photographer than it did the subject.I was deeply touched by the proof that hed been falling along with me.Gideon gestured at the drink hed poured for me in advance and set on the edge of his desk.Have a seat.I complied, curious.There was an edge to him that was new, a sense of purpose and calm determination paired with laser precise focus.What brought on his mood?And what did it mean for the rest of our evening?Then I saw the small photo collage frame lying on the desktop next to my drink and my worry faded.The frame was very similar to the one already on my desk, but this one held three photos of Gideon and me together.I want you to take that to work, he said quietly  Thank you.For the first time in days, I was happy.I hugged the frame to my chest with one hand, and picked up my glass with the other.His eyes glittered as he watched me take a seat.You blow kisses at me all day from your picture on my desk.I think its only fair that you be equally reminded of me.Of us.I exhaled in a rush, my heartbeat not quite steady.I never forget about you or us.I wouldnt let you if you tried.Gideon took a deep drink, his throat working on a swallow.I think Ive figured out where we made our first misstep, the one thats led to all the stumbles weve had since.Oh?Take a drink of your Armagnac, angel.I think youll need it.I took a cautious sip of the liquor, feeling the instantaneous burn, followed by recognition that I liked the flavor.I took a bigger drink.Rolling his glass between his palms, Gideon took another drink and eyed me thoughtfully.Tell me which was hotter, Eva: sex in the limo when you were in charge or sex in the hotel when I was?I shifted restlessly, unsure of where the conversation was leading.I thought you enjoyed what happened in the limo.While it was happening, I mean.Obviously not later.I loved it, he said with quiet conviction.The image of you in that red dress, moaning and telling me how good my cock feels inside you, will haunt me as long as I live.If youd like to top me again in the future, Im definitely game.My stomach tensed.The muscles in my shoulders began to knot.Gideon, Im starting to freak out a little.All this talk of safewords and toppingit feels like this conversation is leading somewhere I cant go.Youre thinking of bondage and pain.Im talking about a consensual power exchange.Gideon studied me intently.Would you like more brandy?Youre very pale.You think?I set the drained glass down.It sounds like youre telling me youre a Dominant.Angel, you knew that already.His mouth curved in a soft, sexy smile.What Im telling you is that youre submissive.17  I pushed to my feet in a rush.Dont, he warned in a dark purr.Youre not running yet.Were not done.You dont know what youre talking about.Being under someone elses thumb losing my right to say no!was never going to happen again.You know what I went through.I need control as much as you do.Sit down, Eva.I stayed on my feet, just to prove my point.His smile widened and my insides melted.Do you have any idea how crazy I am about you?he murmured.Youre crazy all right, if you think Im going to put up with being ordered around, especially sexually.Come on, Eva.You know I dont want to beat you, punish you, hurt you, demean you, or order you around like a pet.Those arent needs either of us has.Straightening, Gideon leaned forward and placed his elbows on the desktop.Youre the most important thing in my life.I treasure you.I want to protect you and make you feel safe.Thats why were talking about this.God.How could he be so wonderful and so insane at the same time?I dont need to be dominated!What you need is someone to trust No.Close your mouth, Eva.Youll wait until Im finished.My protest spluttered into silence.Youve asked me to reacquaint your body with acts previously used to hurt and terrorize you.I cant tell you what your trust means to me or what it would do to me if I broke that trust.I cant risk it, Eva.We have to do this right.I crossed my arms.I guess Im dumber than bricks.I thought our sex life was rockin.Setting his glass down, Gideon kept going as if I hadnt spoken.You asked me to meet a need of yours today and I agreed.Now we need to   If Im not what you want, just spit it out!I set the picture frame and my glass down before I did something with them Id regret.Dont try and pretty it up with   He was around the desk and on me before I could stumble back more than a couple steps.His mouth sealed over mine, his arms caged me.As hed done earlier, he carried me to a wall and restrained me against it, his hands banding my wrists and lifting them high above my head.Trapped, I could nothing as he bent his knees and stroked my cleft with the rigid length of his erection.Once, twice.Silk rasped against my swollen clit.The bite of his teeth on my covered nipple sent a shiver through me, while the clean scent of his warm skin intoxicated me.With a gasp, I sagged into his embrace.See how easily you submit when I take over?His lips followed the arch of my brow.And it feels good doesnt it?It feels right.Thats not fair.I stared up at him.How could he expect me to respond any differently?As disturbed and confounded as I was, I was helplessly drawn to him.Of course it is.Its also true.My gaze roamed over that glorious mane of inky hair and the chiseled lines of his incomparable face.The longing I felt was so acute it was painful.The hidden damage inside him only made me love him more.There were times when I felt like Id found the other half of myself in him.I cant help it that you turn me on, I muttered, My body is physiologically supposed to soften and relax, so you can shove that big cock inside me.Eva.Lets be honest.You want me to have total control.Its important to you that you can trust me to take care of you.Theres nothing wrong with that.The reverse is true for me I need you to trust me enough to give up that control.I couldnt think when he was pressed up against me, my body achingly aware of every hard inch of him.I am not submissive.You are with me.If you look back, youll see youve been yielding to me all along.Youre good in bed!And have more experience.Of course I let you do what you want to me.I bit my lower lip to stop it from quivering.Im sorry I havent been as exciting for you.Bullshit, Eva.You know how much I enjoy making love to you.If I could get away with it, Id do nothing else.Were not talking about games that get me off.Then were talking about what gets me off?Is that what this is?Yes.I thought so.He frowned.Youre upset.I didnt mean Damn it.I thought discussing this would help us.Gideon.My eyes stung, then flooded with tears.He looked as wounded and confused as I felt.Youre breaking my heart.Releasing my wrists, he stepped back and swept me up in his arms, carrying me out of his office and down the hallway to a closed door.Turn the knob, he said quietly.We entered a candlelit room that still smelled faintly of new paint.For a few seconds I was disoriented, unable to comprehend how wed stepped out of Gideons apartment and into my bedroom.I dont understand.A serious understatement, but my brain was still trying to get past the feeling of being teleported from one residence to another.Youmoved me in with you?Not quite.He set me down, but kept an arm around me.I recreated your room based on the photo I took of you sleeping.Why?What the hell?Who did something like that?Was this all to keep me from witnessing his nightmares?The thought shattered my heart further.I felt like Gideon and I were drifting further away from each other by the moment.His hands sifted through my damp hair, which only increased my agitation.I felt like batting his touch away and putting at least the length of the room between us.Maybe two rooms.If you feel the need to run, he said softly, you can come in here and shut the door.I promise not to bother you until youre ready.This way, you have your safe place and I know that you havent left me.A million questions and speculations roared through my mind, but the one thing that stuck out was, Are we still going to share a bed when were sleeping?Every night.Gideons lips touched my forehead.How could you think otherwise?Talk to me, Eva.Whats going through that beautiful head of yours?Whats going through my head?I snapped.What the fuck is going on in yours?What happened to you in the four days we were broken up?His jaw tightened.We never broke up, Eva.The phone rang in the other room.I cursed under my breath.I wanted us to talk and I wanted him to go away, both at the same time.He squeezed my shoulders, and then let me go.Thats our dinner.I didnt follow him when he left, feeling too unsettled to eat.Instead, I crawled onto the bed that was exactly like my own and curled around a pillow, closing my eyes.I didnt hear Gideon come back, but I felt him as he drew to a stop at the edge of the bed.Please dont make me eat alone, he said to my rigid back.Why dont you just order me to eat with you?He sighed, and then slid onto the bed to spoon behind me.His warmth was welcome, chasing away the chill that had brought goose bumps to my skin.He didnt say anything for a long while, just gave me the comfort of having him close.Or maybe he was taking comfort in me.Eva.His fingers caressed the length of my silk clad arm.I cant stand you being unhappy.Talk to me.I dont know what to say.I thought we were finally coming to a point where things would smooth out between us.I hugged the pillow tighter.Dont tense up, Eva.It hurts when you pull away from me.I felt like he was pushing me away.Rolling, I shoved him to his back; then I mounted him, my robe parting as I straddled his hips.I ran the palms of my hands over his powerful chest and raked the tanned flesh with my nails.My hips undulated over him, stroking my bare cleft over his cock.Through the thin silk of his pants, I could feel every ridge and thick vein.From the way his eyes darkened and his sculpted mouth parted on quickened breaths, I knew he could feel the outline and damp heat of me as well.Is this so awful for you?I asked, rocking my hips.Are you lying there thinking youre not giving me what I want because Im in charge?Gideon set his hands on my thighs.Even that innocuous touch seemed dominating.The edginess and sharpened focus Id detected not long ago abruptly made sense to me he wasnt restraining his force of will anymore.The tremendous power coiled inside him was now directed at me like a blast of heat.Ive told you before, he said huskily.Ill take you however I can get you.Whatever.Dont think I dont know youre topping from the bottom.His mouth curved with unapologetic amusement.Sliding down, I teased the flat disk of his nipple with the tip of my tongue.I blanketed him as hed done to me in the past, stretching my body over his hips and legs, my hands shoving beneath his gorgeous ass to squeeze the firm flesh and hold him tight against me.His cock was a thick column against my belly, renewing my fierce appetite for him.Are you going to punish me with pleasure?he asked quietly.Because you can.You can bring me to my knees, Eva.My forehead dropped to his chest and the air left my lungs in an audible rush.I wish.Please dont be so worried.Well get through this along with everything else.Youre so positive youre right.My gaze narrowed.Youre trying to prove a point.And you might prove yours.Gideon licked his lower lip and my sex clenched in silent demand.There was a brilliant depth of emotion in his eyes.Whatever else was going on in our relationship, there was no doubt we were seriously twisted up over each other.And I was about to demonstrate that in the flesh.Gideons neck arched as my mouth moved over his torso.Oh, Eva.Your worlds about to be rocked, Mr.Cross.It was.I made sure of it.Feeling goofy with feminine triumph, I sat at Gideons dining table and remembered him as hed been just a short time ago damp with sweat and panting, cursing as I took my time savoring his luscious body.He swallowed a bite of his steak, which had been kept hot courtesy of a warming drawer, and said calmly, Youre insatiable.Well, duh.Youre gorgeous, sexy, and very well hung.Im glad you approve.Im also extremely wealthy.I waved one hand carelessly, encompassing the whole of what had to be a fifty million dollar apartment.Who cares about that?Well, I do, actually.His mouth curved.I stabbed my fork into a German fried potato, thinking that Peter Luger food was almost as good as sex.Almost.Im interested in your money only if it means you can afford to stop working in favor of lounging around naked as my sex slave.I could afford to financially, yes.But youd get bored and dump me, then where would I be?His look was warmly amused.Think you proved your point, do you?I chewed, and then said, Should I prove it again?The fact that youre still horny enough to want to proves my point.Hmm.I drank my wine.Are you projecting?He shot me a look and casually chewed another bite of the tenderest steak Id ever had.Restless and worried, I took a deep breath and asked, Would you tell me if our sex life didnt satisfy you?Dont be ridiculous, Eva.What else could have prompted him to bring this up after our four day breakup?Im sure it doesnt help that Im not the type you usually go for.And we havent used any of those toys you had in the hotel   Stop talking.Excuse me?Gideon set his utensils down.Im not going to listen to you shred your self esteem.What?Youre the only one who gets to do all the talking?You can pick a fight with me, Eva, but its still not going to get you fucked.Who said  I shut up when he glared.He was right.I still wanted him.I wanted him on top of me, explosively lustful, completely in control of both my pleasure and his.Pushing away from the table, he said curtly, Wait here.When he returned a moment later, he set a black leather ring box beside my plate and resumed his seat.The sight of it hit me like a physical blow.Fear struck me first, icy cold.Followed swiftly by a longing that was white hot.My hands shook in my lap.I clasped my fingers together and realized my whole body was shaking.Lost, I lifted my gaze to Gideons face.The feel of his fingertips brushing down my cheek soothed much of the vibrating anxiety inside me, leaving behind the terrible yearning.Its not that ring, he murmured gently.Not yet.Youre not ready.Something inside me wilted.Then relief flooded me.It was too soon.Neither of us was ready.But if Id ever wondered how deeply I had fallen in love with Gideon, now I knew.I nodded.Open it, he said.With cautious fingers, I pulled the box closer and thumbed open the lid.Oh.Nestled inside the black leather and velvet was a ring like no other.Gold rope like bands were intertwined and decorated with Xs covered in diamonds.Bonds, I murmured, secured by crosses.Gideon Cross.Not quite.I see the ropes as representative of the many threads of you, not bondage.But yes, the Xs are me holding on to you.By my fingernails, it feels like.He finished his glass of wine and refilled both our glasses.I sat unmoving, stunned, trying to take it all in.Everything hed done in the time wed been apart the photos, the ring, Dr.Petersen, the replicated bedroom, and whoever had been following me around told me Id never been far from his mind, if Id even left it at all.You gave me my keys back, I whispered, still remembering the pain.His hand reached out and covered mine.There are a lot of reasons why I did that.You left me wearing nothing but a robe, Eva, and without your keys.I cant stand thinking about what couldve happened if Cary hadnt been home to let you in right away.Lifting his hand to my mouth, I kissed the back; then released him and closed the lid of the ring box.Its beautiful, Gideon.Thank you.It means a lot to me.But you wont wear it.It wasnt a question.After the conversation weve had tonight, it feels like a collar.After a moment, he nodded.Youre not altogether wrong.My brain hurt and my heart ached.Four nights of restless sleeping didnt help.I couldnt understand why he felt I was so necessary, even though I felt that way about him.There were thousands of women in New York alone who could replace me in his life, but there was only one Gideon Cross.I feel like Im disappointing you, Gideon.After everything weve talked about tonightI feel like this is the beginning of the end.Pushing his chair back, he angled toward me and touched my cheek.Its not.When do we see Dr.Petersen?Ill go alone on Tuesdays.After you talk to him and agree to couples counseling, we can go together on Thursdays.Two hours of your week, every week.Not including the travel back and forth.Thats a big commitment.I reached up and brushed the hair back from his cheek.Thank you.Gideon caught my hand and kissed the palm.Its no sacrifice, Eva.He went into his office to work a bit before bed and I carried the ring box into the master bathroom with me.I studied it further while I brushed my teeth and hair.There was a soft hum of need beneath my skin, a persistent level of arousal that shouldnt have been possible considering the number of orgasms Id already had over the course of the day.It was an emotionally driven need to connect to Gideon, to reassure myself that we were okay.Clutching the ring box in my hand, I went to my side of Gideons bed and set it on the nightstand.I wanted it where Id see it first thing in the morning, after a good nights sleep.With a sigh, I draped my beautiful new robe over the footboard and crawled into bed.After tossing and turning for a long while, I finally crashed.I woke sometime in the middle of the night to a racing pulse and quick, shallow breathing.Disoriented, I lay still for a moment, gathering my bearings and remembering where I was.I tensed when it sank in, my ears straining to hear if Gideon was having another nightmare.When I discovered him lying quietly beside me, his breathing deep and even, I relaxed with a sigh.What time had he finally come to bed?After the days wed spent apart, it worried me that he might have felt a need to be alone.Then it hit me.I was aroused.Painfully so.My breasts were full and heavy, my nipples furled and tight.My core was aching and my cleft wet.As I lay there in the moonlit darkness, I realized that my own body had woken me with its demands.Had I dreamed something erotic?Or was it enough that Gideon was lying beside me?Pushing up onto my elbows, I looked at him.The sheet and comforter clung to his waist, leaving his sculpted chest and biceps bared.His right arm was tossed over his head, framing the fall of dark hair around his lavishly handsome face.His left arm lay between us on the blankets, the hand fisted and bringing to relief the network of thick veins that coursed up his forearms.Even in repose he looked fierce and powerful.I became more aware of the tension inside me, the sense that I was drawn to him by the silent exertion of his formidable will.It wasnt possible that he could demand my surrender while he was sleeping, yet it felt that way, felt like that invisible rope between us was pulling me to him.The throbbing between my legs grew unbearable and I pressed one hand against the violent pulsing, hoping to dull the ache.The pressure worsened it instead.I couldnt stay still.Throwing the covers off, I slid my legs off the side of the mattress and thought about trying a glass of warm milk with the brandy Gideon had given me earlier.Abruptly, I paused, riveted by the moonlight gleaming off the leather of the ring box on the nightstand.I thought of the jewelry inside it and my desire surged.At that moment, the thought of being collared by Gideon filled me with heated yearning.Youre just horny, I scolded myself.One of the girls in group had talked about how her master could use her body any time and in any way he wanted, for his pleasure alone.There was nothing about that Id found sexyuntil I put Gideon in the picture.I loved getting him off.I loved making him come.Just because.My fingers brushed over the lid of the tiny box.Exhaling a shaky breath, I picked it up and opened it.A moment later I was sliding the cool band onto the ring finger of my right hand.Do you like it, Eva?A shiver moved through me at the sound of Gideons voice, deeper and rougher than Id ever heard it.Hed been awake, watching me.How long had he been conscious?Was he as attuned to me while sleeping as I seemed to be to him?I love it.I love you.Setting the box aside, I turned my head to find him sitting up.His eyes glittered in a way that made me impossibly more aroused, but also sent a bite of fear through me.It was an unguarded look, like the one that had literally knocked me on my ass when we met scorching and possessive, filled with dark threats of ecstasy.His gorgeous face was harsh in the shadows, his jaw taut as he lifted my right hand to his mouth and kissed the ring hed given me.I moved to kneel on the bed and draped my arms around his neck.Take me.Carte blanche.He cupped my butt and squeezed.How does it feel to say that?Almost as good as the orgasms youre going to give me.Ah, a challenge.The tip of his tongue teased the seam of my lips, tempting me with the promise of a kiss he deliberately withheld.Gideon!Lay back, angel, and grip your pillow with both hands.His mouth curved in a wicked smile.Dont let go for any reason.Understand?Swallowing hard, I did as I was told, so turned on I thought I might come from just the relentless spasming of my needy sex.He kicked the covers down to the footboard.Spread your legs and pull up your knees.My breath caught audibly as my nipples hardened further, causing a deep ache in my breasts.God, Gideon was hot as hell like this.I was panting with excitement, my mind spinning with the possibilities.The flesh between my legs trembled with want.Oh, Eva, he crooned, running his index finger through my slick cleft.Look how greedy you are for me.Its a full time job keeping this sweet little cunt satisfied.That single rigid finger pushed into me, parting the swollen tissues.I tightened around him, so close to coming I could taste it.He withdrew and lifted his hand to his mouth, licking my flavor from his skin.My hips arched without volition, my body straining toward his.Your fault Im so hot for you, I gasped.You slacked on the job for days.Then I better make up for lost time.Sliding down into a prone position, he settled his shoulders beneath my thighs and rimmed the quivering entrance to my body with the tip of his tongue.Around and around.Ignoring my clit and refraining from fucking me even when I begged.Gideon, please.Shh.I have to get you ready first.Im ready.I was ready before you woke up.Then you shouldve woken me earlier.Ill always take care of you, Eva.I live for it.Whimpering in distress, I rocked my hips into that teasing tongue.Only when I was soaked with my own arousal, creaming desperately for the feel of any part of him I could get inside me, did he crawl over me and settle between my spread thighs, placing his forearms flat on the bed.He held my gaze.His cock, feverishly hot and hard as stone, lay against the lips of my sex.I wanted it inside me more than I wanted to breathe.Now, I gasped.Now.With a practiced shift of his hips, he rammed deep into me, shoving me up the bed.Ah, God, I gasped, convulsing ecstatically around the thick column of flesh that possessed me.This was what Id needed since wed talked in his home office, what Id craved as I rode up and down his steely erection before dinner, what Id needed even as I climaxed around his thick length.Dont come, he murmured in my ear, cupping my breasts in his hands and rolling my nipples between his thumb and forefingers.What?I was pretty sure if hed just take a deep breath Id go off.And dont let go of the pillow.Gideon began to move in a slow, lazy rhythm.Youre going to want to, he murmured, nuzzling the sensitive spot beneath my ear.You love to grab my hair and rake your nails down my back.And when youre close to coming, you like to squeeze my ass and yank me deeper.Makes me so damn hard when you go wild like that, when you show me how much you love how I feel inside you.No fair, I moaned, knowing he was deliberately provoking me.The cadence of his raspy voice was perfectly timed with the relentless surging of his hips.Youre torturing me.Good things come to those who wait.His tongue traced the shell of my ear, and then dipped inside at the same moment he tugged on my nipples.I bucked into his next thrust and nearly came.Gideon knew my body so well, knew all its secrets and erogenous zones.He was expertly stroking his cock inside me, rubbing over and over the tender bundle of nerves that quivered in delight.Rolling his hips, he screwed into me, exploiting other spots.I made a plaintive sound, on fire for him, desperately infatuated.My fingers cramped with the grip I had on my pillow, my head thrashing against the driving need to orgasm.He could get me there just by rubbing inside me, the only man whod ever been skilled enough to give me an intense vaginal orgasm.Dont come, he repeated, his voice hoarse.Make it last.I c cant.It feels too good.God, Gideon Tears leaked out of the corners of my eyes.IIm lost in you.I cried softly, afraid to say the other L word too soon and risk upsetting the delicate balance between us.Oh, Eva.He rubbed his cheek against my damp face.I mustve wished for you so hard and so often you had no choice but to come true.Please, I begged softly.Slow down.Gideon lifted his head to look at me, choosing that moment to pinch my nipples with just enough force to inflict a hint of pain.The tender muscles inside me clenched down so hard that his next thrust caused him to groan.Please, I pled again, trembling with the effort to stave off my building climax.Im going to come if you dont slow down.His gaze was hot on my face, his hips still lunging in a measured tempo that was slowly stealing my sanity.Dont you want to come, Eva?he purred in that voice that could lure me into hell with a dreamy smile.Isnt that what youve been working toward all night?My neck arched as his lips drifted across my throat.Only when you say I can, I gasped.Onlywhen you say.Angel.One hand moved to my face, brushing back the strands of hair that clung to the perspiration on my skin.He kissed me deeply, reverently, licking deep into my mouth.Yes  Come for me, he coaxed, quickening his pace.Come, Eva.On command, the orgasm struck me like a blow, shocking my system with an overload of sensation.Wave after wave of pulsing heat rolled through me, contracting my sex and tightening my core.I cried out, first with an inarticulate sound of agonized pleasure, then with his name.Chanting it over and over as he drove his beautiful cock into me, prolonging my climax, before pushing me into another one.Touch me, he rasped, as I fell apart beneath him.Hold me.Freed from his command to hold the pillow, I bound him to my sweat slick body with arms and legs.He pounded deep and hard, driving strenuously toward his climax.He came with a growl, his head thrown back as he spurted into me for long minutes.I held him until our bodies cooled and our breathing evened.When Gideon finally rolled off me, he didnt go far.He wrapped himself around my back and whispered, Sleep now.I dont remember if I stayed awake long enough to reply.18  Monday mornings could be awesome, when they began with Gideon Cross.We rode to work with my back propped against his side and his arm slung over my shoulder so that his fingers could link with mine.As he toyed with the ring hed given me, I kicked out my legs and eyed the classic nude heels hed bought me along with some outfits to wear on the occasions I slept over.To start out the new week, Id decided on a black pinstriped sheath dress with a thin blue belt that reminded me of his eyes.He had excellent taste; I had to give him that.Unless he was sending one of his brunette acquaintances out on buying sprees?I pushed the unpleasant thought aside.When Id checked out the drawers he had set aside for me in his bathroom, I found all of my usual cosmetics and toiletries in all my usual shades.I didnt bother to ask how he knew, which mightve led to me freaking out.Instead, I chose to look at it as more proof of his attentiveness.He thought of everything.The highlight of my morning had been helping Gideon dress in one of his seriously sexy suits.Id buttoned his shirt; hed tucked it into his pants.Id fastened his fly; he had knotted his tie.Hed shrugged into his vest; Id smoothed the finely tailored material over his equally fine shirt, amazed to find that it could be just as sexy putting clothes on him as it was to take them off.It was like wrapping my own gift.The world would see the beauty of the packaging, but only I knew the man inside it and how precious he was.His intimate smiles and his deep husky laugh, the gentleness of his touch and the ferocity of his passion were all reserved for me.The Bentley bounced lightly over a pothole in the road and Gideon tightened his hold.Whats the plan after work?I get to start my Krav Maga classes today.I couldnt keep the excitement out of my voice.Ah, thats right.His lips brushed over my temple.You know Im going to have to watch you go through drills.Just thinking about it makes me hard.Didnt we already establish that everything makes you hard?I teased, nudging him with my elbow.Everything about you.Which is lucky for us, since youre insatiable.Text me when youre done and Ill meet you at your place.Digging in my purse, I pulled out my smartphone to see if it still had a charge and saw a message from Cary.I opened it and found a video plus a text; Does X know his bro is a douche?Stay away from CV, baby girl *smooches*  I started the playback but it took me a minute to figure out what I was seeing.When comprehension set in, I froze.What is it?Gideon asked with his lips in my hair.Then he stiffened behind me, which told me he was looking over my shoulder.Cary had filmed the video at the Vidals garden party.From the eight foot high hedges in the background, he was in the maze, and from the leaves framing the screen, he was in hiding.The star of the show was a couple locked in a passionate embrace.The woman was beautifully teary, while the man kissed over her frantic words and soothed her with gentle strokes of his hands.They were talking about me and Gideon, talking about how I was using my body to get my hands on his millions.Dont worry, Christopher crooned to a distraught Magdalene.You know Gideon gets bored fast.Hes different with her.I I think he loves her.He kissed her forehead.Shes not his type.The fingers I had linked with Gideons tightened.As we watched, Magdalenes demeanor slowly changed.She began to nuzzle into Christophers touch, her voice softening, her mouth seeking.To an observer, it was clear he knew her body well where to pet and where to rub.When she responded to his skilled seduction, he lifted her dress and fucked her.That he was taking advantage of her was obvious.It was there in the contemptuously triumphant look on his face as he screwed her until she was limp.I didnt recognize the Christopher on the screen.His face, his posture, his voiceit was like he was a different man.I was grateful when my smartphone battery died and the screen abruptly winked off.Gideon wrapped his arms around me.Yuck, I whispered, snuggling carefully into him so I didnt get makeup on his lapel.Majorly creepy.I feel bad for her.He exhaled harshly.Thats Christopher.Asshole.That smug look on his face Ugh.I shuddered.Pressing his lips to my hair, he murmured, I thought Maggie would be safe from him.Our mothers have known each other for years.I forget how much he hates me.Why?I wondered briefly if the nightmares Gideon had were related to Christopher, then I put the thought aside.No way.Gideon was older by several years and tougher all the way around.Hed kick Christophers ass.He thinks I got all the attention when we were younger, Gideon said wearily, because everyone was worried about how I was handling my fathers suicide.So he wants whats mine.Everything he can get his hands on.I turned into him, pushing my arms underneath his jacket to get closer.There was something in his voice that made me hurt for him.His family home was a place he said haunted his nightmares and he was terribly distant from his family.Hed never been loved.It was as simple and as complicated as that.Gideon?Hmm?I pulled back to look at him.Reaching up, I traced the bold arch of his brow.I love you.A violent shudder moved through him, one hard enough to shake me, too.I dont mean to freak you out, I reassured him quickly, averting my face to give him some privacy.You dont have to do anything about it.I just didnt want another minute to go by without you knowing how I feel.You can tuck it away now.One of his hands gripped my nape, the other dug almost painfully into my waist.Gideon held me there, immobile, locked against him as if I might blow away.His breathing was ragged, his heartbeat pounding.He didnt say another word the rest of the ride to work, but he didnt let me go either.I planned on telling him again one day in the future, but as far as first times went, I thought wed both done okay.At ten oclock sharp, I had two dozen long stemmed red roses delivered to Gideons office with the note: In celebration of red dresses and limo rides.Ten minutes later, I received an interoffice envelope with a note card that read:  Lets do that again.Soon.At eleven oclock, I had a black and white calla lily arrangement delivered to his office with the note: In honor of black & white garden party dresses and being dragged into libraries  Ten minutes later, I received his reply:  Ill be dragging you to the floor in a minute   At noon, I went shopping.Ring shopping.I hit six different shops before I found a piece that struck me as being absolutely perfect.Made of platinum engraved and studded with black diamonds, it was an industrial looking ring that made me think of power and bondage.It was a dominant ring, very bold and masculine.I had to open a new charge account with the store to cover the hefty cost, but I considered the months of payments ahead of me worth it.I called Gideons office and talked with Scott, who helped me arrange a fifteen minute window in Gideons packed day for me to stop by.Thank you so much for your help, Scott.Youre very welcome.Ive enjoyed watching him receive your flowers today.I dont think Ive ever seen him smile like that.A warm rush of love flowed through me.I wanted to make Gideon happy.As hed said, I lived for it.I went back to work with a smile of my own.At two oclock, I had a tiger lily arrangement delivered to Gideons office followed by a private note sent via interoffice envelope:  In gratitude for all the jungle sex.His reply:  Skip the Krav Maga.Ill give you a workout.When three forty rolled around five minutes before my appointment with Gideon I got nervous.I stood up from my chair on shaky legs and paced in the elevator on the way up to his floor.Now that the time had come to give him my gift, I worried that maybe he didnt like ringsafter all, he didnt wear any.Was it too presumptuous and possessive of me to want him to wear one just because I did?The redheaded receptionist didnt give me any trouble getting in and when Scott spotted me emerging from the hallway, he stood from his desk and greeted me with a wide grin.When I stepped into Gideons office, Scott closed the door behind me.I was immediately struck by the lovely fragrance of the flowers and the way they warmed the starkly modern office.Gideon looked up from his monitor, his brows lifting when he saw me.He pushed fluidly to his feet.Eva.Is something wrong?I watched him shift gears from professional to personal, his gaze softening as he looked at me.No.Its just I took a deep breath and went to him.I have something for you.More?Did I forget a special occasion?I set the ring box down in the center of his desk.Then I turned away, feeling queasy.I seriously doubted the wisdom of my impetuous gift.It seemed like a stupid idea now.What could I say to absolve him of guilt for not wanting it?As if it wasnt bad enough Id dropped the L bomb on him today; then I had to follow it up with a damned ring.He was probably feeling the ball and chain already, dragging after him as he ran.And the noose tightening   I heard the ring box snap open and Gideons sharply drawn breath.Eva.His voice was dark and dangerous.I turned carefully, wincing at the austerity of his features and the starkness of his gaze.His hands were white knuckled on the box.Too much?I asked hoarsely.Yes.He set the box down and rounded the desk.Too damn much.I cant sit still, I cant concentrate.I cant get you out of my head.Im fucking restless, and I never am when Im at work.Im too busy.But you have me under siege.I knew damn well how demanding his work had to be, yet I hadnt taken that into consideration when the mood to surprise him again and again hit me.Im sorry, Gideon.I wasnt thinking.He approached with the sexy stride that hinted at how great he was in the sack.Dont be sorry.Today has been the best day of my life.Really?I watched him slide the ring onto his right ring finger.I wanted to please you.Does it fit?
