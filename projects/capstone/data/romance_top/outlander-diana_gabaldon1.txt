 It wasnt a very likely place for disappearances, at least at first glance.Mrs.Bairds was like a thousand other Highland bed and breakfast establishments in 1945; clean and quiet, with fading floral wallpaper, gleaming floors, and a coin operated hot water geyser in the lavatory.Mrs.Baird herself was squat and easygoing, and made no objection to Frank lining her tiny rose sprigged parlor with the dozens of books and papers with which he always traveled.I met Mrs.Baird in the front hall on my way out.She stopped me with a pudgy hand on my arm and patted at my hair.Dear me, Mrs.Randall, ye canna go out like that!Here, just let me tuck that bit in for ye.There!Thats better.Ye know, my cousin was tellin me about a new perm she tried, comes out beautiful and holds like a dream; perhaps ye should try that kind next time.I hadnt the heart to tell her that the waywardness of my light brown curls was strictly the fault of nature, and not due to any dereliction on the part of the permanent wave manufacturers.Her own tightly marceled waves suffered from no such perversity.Yes, Ill do that, Mrs.Baird, I lied.Im just going down to the village to meet Frank.Well be back for tea.I ducked out the door and down the path before she could detect any further defects in my undisciplined appearance.After four years as a Royal Army nurse, I was enjoying the escape from uniforms and rationing by indulging in brightly printed light cotton dresses, totally unsuited for rough walking through the heather.Not that I had originally planned to do a lot of that; my thoughts ran more on the lines of sleeping late in the mornings, and long, lazy afternoons in bed with Frank, not sleeping.However, it was difficult to maintain the proper mood of languorous romance with Mrs.Baird industriously Hoovering away outside our door.That must be the dirtiest bit of carpet in the entire Scottish Highlands, Frank had observed that morning as we lay in bed listening to the ferocious roar of the vacuum in the hallway.Nearly as dirty as our landladys mind, I agreed.Perhaps we should have gone to Brighton after all.We had chosen the Highlands as a place to holiday before Frank took up his appointment as a history professor at Oxford, on the grounds that Scotland had been somewhat less touched by the physical horrors of war than the rest of Britain, and was less susceptible to the frenetic postwar gaiety that infected more popular vacation spots.And without discussing it, I think we both felt that it was a symbolic place to reestablish our marriage; we had been married and spent a two day honeymoon in the Highlands, shortly before the outbreak of war seven years before.A peaceful refuge in which to rediscover each other, we thought, not realizing that, while golf and fishing are Scotlands most popular outdoor sports, gossip is the most popular indoor sport.And when it rains as much as it does in Scotland, people spend a lot of time indoors.Where are you going?I asked, as Frank swung his feet out of bed.Id hate the dear old thing to be disappointed in us, he answered.Sitting up on the side of the ancient bed, he bounced gently up and down, creating a piercing rhythmic squeak.The Hoovering in the hall stopped abruptly.After a minute or two of bouncing, he gave a loud, theatrical groan and collapsed backward with a twang of protesting springs.I giggled helplessly into a pillow, so as not to disturb the breathless silence outside.Frank waggled his eyebrows at me.Youre supposed to moan ecstatically, not giggle, he admonished in a whisper.Shell think Im not a good lover.Youll have to keep it up for longer than that, if you expect ecstatic moans, I answered.Two minutes doesnt deserve any more than a giggle.Inconsiderate little wench.I came here for a rest, remember?Lazybones.Youll never manage the next branch on your family tree unless you show a bit more industry than that.Franks passion for genealogy was yet another reason for choosing the Highlands.According to one of the filthy scraps of paper he lugged to and fro, some tiresome ancestor of his had had something to do with something or other in this region back in the middle of the eighteenthor was it seventeenth?century.If I end as a childless stub on my family tree, it will undoubtedly be the fault of our untiring hostess out there.After all, weve been married almost eight years.Little Frank Jr.will be quite legitimate without being conceived in the presence of a witness.If hes conceived at all, I said pessimistically.We had been disappointed yet again the week before leaving for our Highland retreat.With all this bracing fresh air and healthy diet?How could we help but manage here?Dinner the night before had been herring, fried.Lunch had been herring, pickled.And the pungent scent now wafting up the stairwell strongly intimated that breakfast was to be herring, kippered.Unless youre contemplating an encore performance for the edification of Mrs.Baird, I suggested, youd better get dressed.Arent you meeting that parson at ten?The Rev.Dr.Reginald Wakefield, vicar of the local parish, was to provide some rivetingly fascinating baptismal registers for Franks inspection, not to mention the glittering prospect that he might have unearthed some moldering army despatches or somesuch that mentioned the notorious ancestor.Whats the name of that great great great great grandfather of yours again?I asked.The one that mucked about here during one of the Risings?I cant remember if it was Willy or Walter.Actually, it was Jonathan.Frank took my complete disinterest in family history placidly, but remained always on guard, ready to seize the slightest expression of inquisitiveness as an excuse for telling me all facts known to date about the early Randalls and their connections.His eyes assumed the fervid gleam of the fanatic lecturer as he buttoned his shirt.Jonathan Wolverton RandallWolverton for his mothers uncle, a minor knight from Sussex.He was, however, known by the rather dashing nickname of Black Jack, something he acquired in the army, probably during the time he was stationed here.I flopped facedown on the bed and affected to snore.Ignoring me, Frank went on with his scholarly exegesis.He bought his commission in the mid thirties1730s, that isand served as a captain of dragoons.According to those old letters Cousin May sent me, he did quite well in the army.Good choice for a second son, you know; his younger brother followed tradition as well by becoming a curate, but I havent found out much about him yet.Anyway, Jack Randall was highly commended by the Duke of Sandringham for his activities before and during the 45the secondJacobite Rising, you know, he amplified for the benefit of the ignorant amongst his audience, namely me.You know, Bonnie Prince Charlie and that lot?Im not entirely sure the Scots realize they lost that one, I interrupted, sitting up and trying to subdue my hair.I distinctly heard the barman at that pub last night refer to us as Sassenachs.Well, why not?said Frank equably.It only means Englishman, after all, or at worst, outlander, and were all of that.I know what it means.It was the tone I objected to.Frank searched through the bureau drawer for a belt.He was just annoyed because I told him the ale was weak.I told him the true Highland brew requires an old boot to be added to the vat, and the final product to be strained through a well worn undergarment.Ah, that accounts for the amount of the bill.Well, I phrased it a little more tactfully than that, but only because the Gaelic language hasnt got a specific word for drawers.I reached for a pair of my own, intrigued.Why not?Did the ancient Gaels not wear undergarments?Frank leered.Youve never heard that old song about what a Scotsman wears beneath his kilts?Presumably not gents knee length step ins, I said dryly.Perhaps Ill go out in search of a local kilt wearer whilst youre cavorting with vicars and ask him.Well, do try not to get arrested, Claire.The dean of St.Giles College wouldnt like it at all.* * *    In the event, there were no kilt wearers loitering about the town square or patronizing the shops that surrounded it.There were a number of other people there, though, mostly housewives of the Mrs.Baird type, doing their daily shopping.They were garrulous and gossipy, and their solid, print clad presences filled the shops with a cozy warmth; a buttress against the cold mist of the morning outdoors.With as yet no house of my own to keep, I had little that needed buying, but enjoyed myself in browsing among the newly replenished shelves, for the pure joy of seeing lots of things for sale again.It had been a long time of rationing, of doing without the simple things like soap and eggs, and even longer without the minor luxuries of life, like LHeure Bleu cologne.My gaze lingered on a shop window filled with household goodsembroidered tea cloths and cozies, pitchers and glasses, a stack of quite homely pie tins, and a set of three vases.I had never owned a vase in my life.During the war years, I had, of course, lived in the nurses quarters, first at Pembroke Hospital, later at the field station in France.But even before that, we had lived nowhere long enough to justify the purchase of such an item.Had I had such a thing, I reflected, Uncle Lamb would have filled it with potsherds long before I could have got near it with a bunch of daisies.Quentin Lambert Beauchamp.Q to his archaeological students and his friends.Dr.Beauchamp to the scholarly circles in which he moved and lectured and had his being.But always Uncle Lamb to me.My fathers only brother, and my only living relative at the time, he had been landed with me, aged five, when my parents were killed in a car crash.Poised for a trip to the Middle East at the time, he had paused in his preparations long enough to make the funeral arrangements, dispose of my parents estates, and enroll me in a proper girls boarding school.Which I had flatly refused to attend.Faced with the necessity of prying my chubby fingers off the cars door handle and dragging me by the heels up the steps of the school, Uncle Lamb, who hated personal conflict of any kind, had sighed in exasperation, then finally shrugged and tossed his better judgment out the window along with my newly purchased round straw boater.Ruddy thing, he muttered, seeing it rolling merrily away in the rearview mirror as we roared down the drive in high gear.Always loathed hats on women, anyway.He had glanced down at me, fixing me with a fierce glare.One thing, he said, in awful tones.You are not to play dolls with my Persian grave figurines.Anything else, but not that.Got it?I had nodded, content.And had gone with him to the Middle East, to South America, to dozens of study sites throughout the world.Had learned to read and write from the drafts of journal articles, to dig latrines and boil water, and to do a number of other things not suitable for a young lady of gentle birthuntil I had met the handsome, dark haired historian who came to consult Uncle Lamb on a point of French philosophy as it related to Egyptian religious practice.Even after our marriage, Frank and I led the nomadic life of junior faculty, divided between continental conferences and temporary flats, until the outbreak of war had sent him to Officers Training and the Intelligence Unit at M16, and me to nurses training.Though we had been married nearly eight years, the new house in Oxford would be our first real home.Tucking my handbag firmly under my arm, I marched into the shop and bought the vases.* * *    I met Frank at the crossing of the High Street and the Gereside Road and we turned up it together.He raised his eyebrows at my purchases.Vases?He smiled.Wonderful.Perhaps now youll stop putting flowers in my books.They arent flowers, theyre specimens.And it was you who suggested I take up botany.To occupy my mind, now that Ive not got nursing to do, I reminded him.True.He nodded good humoredly.But I didnt realize Id have bits of greenery dropping out into my lap every time I opened a reference.What was that horrible crumbly brown stuff you put in Tuscum and Banks?Groutweed.Good for hemorrhoids.Preparing for my imminent old age, are you?Well, how very thoughtful of you, Claire.We pushed through the gate, laughing, and Frank stood back to let me go first up the narrow front steps.Suddenly he caught my arm.Look out!You dont want to step in it.I lifted my foot gingerly over a large brownish red stain on the top step.How odd, I said.Mrs.Baird scrubs the steps down every morning; Ive seen her.What do you suppose that can be?Frank leaned over the step, sniffing delicately.Offhand, I should say that its blood.Blood!I took a step back into the entryway.Whose?I glanced nervously into the house.Do you suppose Mrs.Bairds had an accident of some kind?I couldnt imagine our immaculate landlady leaving bloodstains to dry on her doorstep unless some major catastrophe had occurred, and wondered just for a moment whether the parlor might be harboring a crazed ax murderer, even now preparing to spring out on us with a spine chilling shriek.Frank shook his head.He stood on tiptoe to peer over the hedge into the next garden.I shouldnt think so.Theres a stain like it on the Collinses doorstep as well.Really?I drew closer to Frank, both to see over the hedge and for moral support.The Highlands hardly seemed a likely spot for a mass murderer, but then I doubted such persons used any sort of logical criteria when picking their sites.Thats ratherdisagreeable, I observed.There was no sign of life from the next residence.What do you suppose has happened?Frank frowned, thinking, then slapped his hand briefly against his trouser leg in inspiration.I think I know!Wait here a moment.He darted out to the gate and set off down the road at a trot, leaving me stranded on the edge of the doorstep.He was back shortly, beaming with confirmation.Yes, thats it, it must be.Every house in the row has had it.Had what?A visit from a homicidal maniac?I spoke a bit sharply, still nervous at having been abruptly abandoned with nothing but a large bloodstain for company.Frank laughed.No, a ritual sacrifice.Fascinating!He was down on his hands and knees in the grass, peering interestedly at the stain.This hardly sounded better than a homicidal maniac.I squatted beside him, wrinkling my nose at the smell.It was early for flies, but a couple of the big, slow moving Highland midges circled the stain.What do you mean, ritual sacrifice?I demanded.Mrs.Bairds a good church goer, and so are all the neighbors.This isnt Druids Hill or anything, you know.He stood, brushing grass ends from his trousers.Thats all you know, my girl, he said.Theres no place on earth with more of the old superstitions and magic mixed into its daily life than the Scottish Highlands.Church or no church, Mrs.Baird believes in the Old Folk, and so do all the neighbors.He pointed at the stain with one neatly polished toe.The blood of a black cock, he explained, looking pleased.The houses are new, you see.Pre fabs.I looked at him coldly.If you are under the impression that that explains everything, think again.What difference does it make how old the houses are?And where on earth is everybody?Down the pub, I should expect.Lets go along and see, shall we?Taking my arm, he steered me out the gate and we set off down the Gereside Road.In the old days, he explained as we went, and not so long ago, either, when a house was built, it was customary to kill something and bury it under the foundation, as a propitiation to the local earth spirits.You know, He shall lay the foundations thereof in his firstborn and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.Old as the hills.I shuddered at the quotation.In that case, I suppose its quite modern and enlightened of them to be using chickens instead.You mean, since the houses are fairly new, nothing was buried under them, and the inhabitants are now remedying the omission.Yes, exactly.Frank seemed pleased with my progress, and patted me on the back.According to the vicar, many of the local folk thought the War was due in part to people turning away from their roots and omitting to take proper precautions, such as burying a sacrifice under the foundation, that is, or burning fishes bones on the hearthexcept haddocks, of course, he added, happily distracted.You never burn a haddocks bonesdid you know?or youll never catch another.Always bury the bones of a haddock instead.Ill bear it in mind, I said.Tell me what you do in order never to see another herring, and Ill do it forthwith.He shook his head, absorbed in one of his feats of memory, those brief periods of scholastic rapture where he lost touch with the world around him, absorbed completely in conjuring up knowledge from all its sources.I dont know about herring, he said absently.For mice, though, you hang bunches of Trembling Jock aboutTrembling Jock i the hoose, and yell neer see a moose, you know.Bodies under the foundation, thoughthats where a lot of the local ghosts come from.You know Mountgerald, the big house at the end of the High Street?Theres a ghost there, a workman on the house who was killed as a sacrifice for the foundation.In the eighteenth century sometime; thats really fairly recent, he added thoughtfully.The story goes that by order of the houses owner, one wall was built up first, then a stone block was dropped from the top of it onto one of the workmenpresumably a dislikable fellow was chosen for the sacrificeand he was buried then in the cellar and the rest of the house built up over him.He haunts the cellar where he was killed, except on the anniversary of his death and the four Old Days.Old Days?The ancient feasts, he explained, still lost in his mental notes.Hogmanay, thats New Years, Midsummer Day, Beltane and All Hallows.Druids, Beaker Folk, early Picts, everybody kept the sun feasts and the fire feasts, so far as we know.Anyway, ghosts are freed on the holy days, and can wander about at will, to do harm or good as they please.He rubbed his chin thoughtfully.Its getting on for Beltaneclose to the spring equinox.Best keep an eye out, next time you pass the kirkyard.His eyes twinkled, and I realized the trance had ended.I laughed.Are there a number of famous local ghosts, then?He shrugged.Dont know.Well ask the Vicar, shall we, next time we see him?We saw the Vicar quite shortly, in fact.He, along with most of the other inhabitants of the village, was down in the pub, having a lager and light in celebration of the houses new sanctification.He seemed rather embarrassed at being caught in the act of condoning acts of paganism, as it were, but brushed it off as merely a local observance with historical color, like the Wearing of the Green.Really rather fascinating, you know, he confided, and I recognized, with an internal sigh, the song of the scholar, as identifying a sound as the terr whit!of a thrush.Harking to the call of a kindred spirit, Frank at once settled down to the mating dance of academe, and they were soon neck deep in archetypes and the parallels between ancient superstitions and modern religions.I shrugged and made my own way through the crowd to the bar and back, a large brandy and splash in each hand.Knowing from experience how difficult it was to distract Franks attention from this sort of discussion, I simply picked up his hand, wrapped his fingers about the stem of the glass and left him to his own devices.I found Mrs.Baird on a deep bench near the window, sharing a companionable pint of bitter with an elderly man whom she introduced to me as Mr.Crook.This is the man I tellt ye about, Mrs.Randall, she said, eyes bright with the stimulation of alcohol and company.The one as knows about plants of all sorts.Mrs.Randalls verra much interested in the wee plants, she confided to her companion, who inclined his head in a combination of politeness and deafness.Presses them in books and such.Do ye, indeed?Mr.Crook asked, one tufted white brow raised in interest.Ive some pressesthe real ones, mindfor plants and such.Had them from my nephew, when he come up from university over his holiday.He brought them for me, and Id not the heart to tell him I never uses such things.Hangins whats wanted for herbs, ye ken, or maybe to be dried on a frame and put in a bit o gauze bag or a jar, but whyever youd be after squashing the wee things flat, Ive no idea.Well, to look at, maybe, Mrs.Baird interjected kindly.Mrs.Randalls made some lovely bits out of mallow blossoms, and violets, same as you could put in a frame and hang on the wall, like.Mmmphm.Mr.Crooks seamed face seemed to be admitting a dubious possibility to this suggestion.Weel, if theyre of any use to ye, Missus, you can have the presses, and welcome.I didna wish to be throwing them awa, but I must say Ive no use for them.I assured Mr.Crook that I would be delighted to make use of the plant presses, and still more delighted if he would show me where some of the rarer plants in the area could be found.He eyed me sharply for a moment, head to one side like an elderly kestrel, but appeared finally to decide that my interest was genuine, and we fixed it up that I should meet him in the morning for a tour of the local shrubbery.Frank, I knew, meant to go into Inverness for the day to consult some records in the town hall there, and I was pleased to have an excuse not to accompany him.One record was much like another, so far as I was concerned.Soon after this, Frank pried himself away from the Vicar, and we walked home in company with Mrs.Baird.I was reluctant to mention the cocks blood on the doorstep, myself, but Frank suffered from no such reticence, and questioned her eagerly as to the background of the custom.I suppose its quite old, then?he asked, swishing a stick along through the roadside weeds.Lambs quarters and cinquefoil were already blooming, and I could see the buds of sweet broom swelling; another week and theyd be in flower.Och, aye.Mrs.Baird waddled along at a brisk pace, asking no quarter from our younger limbs.Older than anyone knows, Mr.Randall.Even back before the days of the giants.Giants?I asked.Aye.Fionn and the Feinn, ye ken.Gaelic folktales, Frank remarked with interest.Heroes, you know.Probably from Norse roots.Theres a lot of the Norse influence round here, and all the way up the coast to the West.Some of the place names are Norse, you know, not Gaelic at all.I rolled my eyes, sensing another outburst, but Mrs.Baird smiled kindly and encouraged him, saying that was true, then, shed been up to the north, and seen the Two Brothers stone, and that was Norse, wasnt it?The Norsemen came down on that coast hundreds of times between A. D.500 and 1300 or so, Frank said, looking dreamily at the horizon, seeing dragon ships in the wind swept cloud.Vikings, you know.And they brought a lot of their own myths along.Its a good country for myths.Things seem to take root here.This I could believe.Twilight was coming on, and so was a storm.In the eerie light beneath the clouds, even the thoroughly modern houses along the road looked as ancient and as sinister as the weathered Pictish stone that stood a hundred feet away, guarding the crossroads it had marked for a thousand years.It seemed a good night to be inside with the shutters fastened.Rather than staying cozily in Mrs.Bairds parlor to be entertained by stere opticon views of Perth Harbor, though, Frank chose to keep his appointment for sherry with Mr.Bainbridge, a solicitor with an interest in local historical records.Bearing in mind my earlier encounter with Mr.Bainbridge, I elected to stay at home with Perth Harbor.Try to come back before the storm breaks, I said, kissing Frank goodbye.And give my regards to Mr.Bainbridge.Umm, yes.Yes, of course.Carefully not meeting my eye, Frank shrugged into his overcoat and left, collecting an umbrella from the stand by the door.I closed the door after him, but left it on the latch so he could get back in.I wandered back toward the parlor, reflecting that Frank would doubtless pretend that he didnt have a wifea pretense in which Mr.Bainbridge would cheerfully join.Not that I could blame him, particularly.At first, everything had gone quite well on our visit to Mr.Bainbridges home the afternoon before.I had been demure, genteel, intelligent but self effacing, well groomed, and quietly dressedeverything the Perfect Dons Wife should be.Until the tea was served.I now turned my right hand over, ruefully examining the large blister that ran across the bases of all four fingers.After all, it was not my fault that Mr.Bainbridge, a widower, made do with a cheap tin teapot instead of a proper crockery one.Nor that the solicitor, seeking to be polite, had asked me to pour out.Nor that the potholder he provided had a worn patch that allowed the red hot handle of the teapot to come into direct contact with my hand when I picked it up.No, I decided.Dropping the teapot was a perfectly normal reaction.Dropping it into Mr.Bainbridges lap was merely an accident of placement; I had to drop it somewhere.It was my exclaiming Bloody fucking hell!in a voice that topped Mr.Bainbridges heartcry that had made Frank glare at me across the scones.Once he recovered from the shock, Mr.Bainbridge had been quite gallant, fussing about my hand and ignoring Franks attempts to excuse my language on grounds that I had been stationed in a field hospital for the better part of two years.Im afraid my wife picked up a number of, er, colorful expressions from the Yanks and such, Frank offered, with a nervous smile.True, I said, gritting my teeth as I wrapped a water soaked napkin about my hand.Men tend to be very colorful when youre picking shrapnel out of them.Mr.Bainbridge had tactfully tried to distract the conversation onto neutral historical ground by saying that he had always been interested in the variations of what was considered profane speech through the ages.There was Gorblimey, for example, a recent corruption of the oath God blind me.Yes, of course, said Frank, gratefully accepting the diversion.No sugar, thank you, Claire.What about Gadzooks?The Gad part is quite clear, of course, but the zook.Well, you know, the solicitor interjected, Ive sometimes thought it might be a corruption of an old Scots word, in factyeuk.Means itch.That would make sense, wouldnt it?Frank nodded, letting his unscholarly forelock fall across his forehead.He pushed it back automatically.Interesting, he said, the whole evolution of profanity.Yes, and its still going on, I said, carefully picking up a lump of sugar with the tongs.Oh?said Mr.Bainbridge politely.Did you encounter some interesting variations during your, er, war experience?Oh, yes, I said.My favorite was one I picked up from a Yank.Man named Williamson, from New York, I believe.He said it every time I changed his dressing.What was it?Jesus H.  Roosevelt Christ,  I said, and dropped the sugar lump neatly into Franks coffee.* * *    After a peaceful and not unpleasant sit with Mrs.Baird, I made my way upstairs, to ready myself before Frank came home.I knew his limit with sherry was two glasses, so I expected him back soon.The wind was rising, and the very air of the bedroom was prickly with electricity.I drew the brush through my hair, making the curls snap with static and spring into knots and furious tangles.My hair would have to do without its hundred strokes tonight, I decided.I would settle for brushing my teeth, in this sort of weather.Strands of hair adhered stickily to my cheeks, clinging stubbornly as I tried to smooth them back.No water in the ewer; Frank had used it, tidying himself before setting out for his meeting with Mr.Bainbridge, and I had not bothered to refill it from the lavatory tap.I picked up the bottle of LHeure Bleu and poured a generous puddle into the palm of my hand.Rubbing my hands briskly together before the scent could evaporate, I smoothed them rapidly through my hair.I poured another dollop onto my hairbrush and swept the curls back behind my ears with it.Well.That was rather better, I thought, turning my head from side to side to examine the results in the speckled looking glass.The moisture had dissipated the static electricity in my hair, so that it floated in heavy, shining waves about my face.And the evaporating alcohol had left behind a very pleasant scent.Frank would like that, I thought.LHeure Bleu was his favorite.There was a sudden flash close at hand, with the crash of thunder following close on its heels, and all the lights went out.Cursing under my breath, I groped in the drawers.Somewhere I had seen candles and matches; power failure was so frequent an occurrence in the Highlands that candles were a necessary furnishing for all inn and hotel rooms.I had seen them even in the most elegant hotels, where they were scented with honeysuckle, and presented in frosted glass holders with shimmering pendants.Mrs.Bairds candles were far more utilitarianplain white plumbers candlesbut there were a lot of them, and three folders of matches as well.I was not inclined to be picky over style at a time like this.I fitted a candle to the blue ceramic holder on the dressing table by the light of the next flash, then moved about the room, lighting others, til the whole room was filled with a soft, wavering radiance.Very romantic, I thought, and with some presence of mind, I pressed down the light switch, so that a sudden return of power shouldnt ruin the mood at some inopportune moment.The candles had burned no more than a half inch when the door opened and Frank blew in.Literally, for the draft that followed him up the stairs extinguished three of the candles.The door closed behind him with a bang that blew out two more, and he peered into the sudden gloom, pushing a hand through his disheveled hair.I got up and relit the candles, making mild remarks about his abrupt methods of entering rooms.It was only when I had finished and turned to ask him whether hed like a drink, that I saw he was looking rather white and unsettled.Whats the matter?I said.Seen a ghost?Well, you know, he said slowly, Im not at all sure that I havent.Absentmindedly, he picked up my hairbrush and raised it to tidy his hair.When a sudden whiff of LHeure Bleu reached his nostrils, he wrinkled his nose and set it down again, settling for the attentions of his pocket comb instead.I glanced through the window, where the elm trees were lashing to and fro like flails.A loose shutter was banging somewhere on the other side of the house, and it occurred to me that we ought perhaps to close our own, though the carry on outside was rather exciting to watch.Bit blustery for a ghost, Id think, I said.Dont they like quiet, misty evenings in graveyards?Frank laughed a bit sheepishly.Well, I daresay its only Bainbridges stories, plus a bit more of his sherry than I really meant to have.Nothing at all, likely.Now I was curious.What exactly did you see?I asked, settling myself on the dressing table seat.I motioned to the whisky bottle with a half lifted brow, and Frank went at once to pour a couple of drinks.Well, only a man, really, he began, measuring out a jigger for himself and two for me.Standing down in the road outside.What, outside this house?I laughed.Must have been a ghost, then; I cant feature any living person standing about on a night like this.Frank tilted the ewer over his glass, then looked accusingly at me when no water came out.Dont look at me, I said.You used up all the water.I dont mind it neat, though.I took a sip in illustration.Frank looked as though he were tempted to nip down to the lavatory for water, but abandoned the idea and went on with his story, sipping cautiously as though his glass contained vitriol, rather than the best Glenfiddich single malt whisky.Yes, he was down at the edge of the garden on this side, standing by the fence.I thoughthe hesitated, looking down into his glassI rather thought he was looking up at your window.My window?How extraordinary!I couldnt repress a mild shiver, and went across to fasten the shutters, though it seemed a bit late for that.Frank followed me across the room, still talking.Yes, I could see you myself from below.You were brushing your hair and cursing a bit because it was standing on end.In that case, the fellow was probably enjoying a good laugh, I said tartly.Frank shook his head, though he smiled and smoothed his hands over my hair.No, he wasnt laughing.In fact, he seemed terribly unhappy about something.Not that I could see his face well; just something about the way he stood.I came up behind him, and when he didnt move, I asked politely if I could help him with something.He acted at first as though he didnt hear me, and I thought perhaps he didnt, over the noise of the wind, so I repeated myself, and I reached out to tap his shoulder, to get his attention, you know.But before I could touch him, he whirled suddenly round and pushed past me and walked off down the road.Sounds a bit rude, but not very ghostly, I observed, draining my glass.What did he look like?Big chap, said Frank, frowning in recollection.And a Scot, in complete Highland rig out, complete to sporran and the most beautiful running stag brooch on his plaid.I wanted to ask where hed got it from, but he was off before I could.I went to the bureau and poured another drink.Well, not so unusual an appearance for these parts, surely?Ive seen men dressed like that in the village now and then.Nooo Frank sounded doubtful.No, it wasnt his dress that was odd.But when he pushed past me, I could swear he was close enough that I should have felt him brush my sleevebut I didnt.And I was intrigued enough to turn round and watch him as he walked away.He walked down the Gereside Road, but when hed almost reached the corner, hedisappeared.Thats when I began to feel a bit cold down the backbone.Perhaps your attention was distracted for a second, and he just stepped aside into the shadows, I suggested.There are a lot of trees down near that corner.I could swear I didnt take my eyes off him for a moment, muttered Frank.He looked up suddenly.I know!I remember now why I thought he was so odd, though I didnt realize it at the time.What?I was getting a bit tired of the ghost, and wanted to go on to more interesting matters, such as bed.The wind was cutting up like billy o, but his drapeshis kilts and his plaid, you knowthey didnt move at all, except to the stir of his walking.We stared at each other.Well, I said finally, that is a bit spooky.Frank shrugged and smiled suddenly, dismissing it.At least Ill have something to tell the Vicar next time I see him.Perhaps its a well known local ghost, and he can give me its gory history.He glanced at his watch.But now Id say its bedtime.So it is, I murmured.I watched him in the mirror as he removed his shirt and reached for a hanger.Suddenly he paused in mid button.Did you have many Scots in your charge, Claire?he asked abruptly.At the field hospital, or at Pembroke?Of course, I replied, somewhat puzzled.There were quite a few of the Seaforths and Camerons through the field hospital at Amiens, and then a bit later, after Caen, we had a lot of the Gordons.Nice chaps, most of them.Very stoic about things generally, but terrible cowards about injections.I smiled, remembering one in particular.We had onerather a crusty old thing really, a piper from the Third Seaforthswho couldnt stand being stuck, especially not in the hip.Hed go for hours in the most awful discomfort before hed let anyone near him with a needle, and even then hed try to get us to give him the injection in the arm, though its meant to be intramuscular.I laughed at the memory of Corporal Chisholm.He told me, If Im goin to lie on my face wi my buttocks bared, I want the lass under me, not behind me wi a hatpin!Frank smiled, but looked a trifle uneasy, as he often did about my less delicate war stories.Dont worry, I assured him, seeing the look, I wont tell that one at tea in the Senior Common Room.The smile lightened and he came forward to stand behind me as I sat at the dressing table.He pressed a kiss on the top of my head.Dont worry, he said.The Senior Common Room will love you, no matter what stories you tell.Mmmm.Your hair smells wonderful.Do you like it then?His hands slid forward over my shoulders in answer, cupping my breasts in the thin nightdress.I could see his head above mine in the mirror, his chin resting on top of my head.I like everything about you, he said huskily.You look wonderful by candlelight, you know.Your eyes are like sherry in crystal, and your skin glows like ivory.A candlelight witch, you are.Perhaps I should disconnect the lamps permanently.Make it hard to read in bed, I said, my heart beginning to speed up.I could think of better things to do in bed, he murmured.Could you, indeed?I said, rising and turning to put my arms about his neck.Like what?* * *    Sometime later, cuddled close behind bolted shutters, I lifted my head from his shoulder and said, Why did you ask me that earlier?About whether Id had to do with any Scots, I meanyou must know I had, there are all sorts of men through those hospitals.He stirred and ran a hand softly down my back.Mmm.Oh, nothing, really.Just, when I saw that chap outside, it occurred to me he might behe hesitated, tightening his hold a biter, you know, that he might have been someone youd nursed, perhapsmaybe heard you were staying here, and came along to seesomething like that.In that case, I said practically, why wouldnt he come in and ask to see me?Well, Franks voice was very casual, maybe he didnt want particularly to run into me.I pushed up onto one elbow, staring at him.We had left one candle burning, and I could see him well enough.He had turned his head, and was looking oh so casually off toward the chromolithograph of Bonnie Prince Charlie with which Mrs.Baird had seen fit to decorate our wall.I grabbed his chin and turned his head to face me.He widened his eyes in simulated surprise.Are you implying, I demanded, that the man you saw outside was some sort of, of I hesitated, looking for the proper word.Liaison?he suggested helpfully.Romantic interest of mine?I finished.No, no, certainly not, he said unconvincingly.He took my hands away from his face, and tried to kiss me, but now it was my turn for head turning.He settled for pressing me back down to lie beside him.Its only.he began.Well, you know, Claire, it was six years.And we saw each other only three times, and only just for the day that last time.It wouldnt be unusual ifI mean, everyone knows doctors and nurses are under tremendous stress during emergencies, andwell, Iits just thatwell, Id understand, you know, if anything, er, of a spontaneous nature  I interrupted this rambling by jerking free and exploding out of bed.Do you think Ive been unfaithful to you?I demanded.Do you?Because if so, you can leave this room this instant.Leave the house altogether!How dare you imply such a thing?I was seething, and Frank, sitting up, reached out to try to soothe me.Dont you touch me!I snapped.Just tell medo you think, on the evidence of a strange man happening to glance up at my window, that Ive had some flaming affair with one of my patients?Frank got out of bed and wrapped his arms around me.I stayed stiff as Lots wife, but he persisted, caressing my hair and rubbing my shoulders in the way he knew I liked.No, I dont think any such thing, he said firmly.He pulled me closer, and I relaxed slightly, though not enough to put my arms around him.After a long time, he murmured into my hair, No, I know youd never do such a thing.I only meant to say that even if you ever didClaire, it would make no difference to me.I love you so.Nothing you ever did could stop my loving you.He took my face between his handsonly four inches taller than I, he could look directly into my eyes without troubleand said softly, Forgive me?His breath, barely scented with the tang of Glenfiddich, was warm on my face, and his lips, full and inviting, were disturbingly close.Another flash from outside heralded the sudden breaking of the storm, and a thundering rain smashed down on the slates of the roof.I slowly put my arms around his waist.The quality of mercy is not strained,  I quoted.It droppeth as the gentle dew from heaven   Frank laughed and looked upward; the overlapping stains on the ceiling boded ill for the prospects of our sleeping dry all night.If thats a sample of your mercy, he said, Id hate to see your vengeance.The thunder went off like a mortar attack, as though in answer to his words, and we both laughed, at ease again.It was only later, listening to his regular deep breathing beside me, that I began to wonder.As I had said, there was no evidence whatsoever to imply unfaithfulness on my part.My part.But six years, as hed said, was a long time.2    STANDING STONES    Mr.Crook called for me, as arranged, promptly at seven the next morning.So as well catch the dew on the buttercups, eh, lass?he said, twinkling with elderly gallantry.He had brought a motorcycle of his own approximate vintage, on which to transport us into the countryside.The plant presses were tidily strapped to the sides of this enormous machine, like bumpers on a tugboat.It was a leisurely ramble through the quiet countryside, made all the more quiet by contrast with the thunderous roar of Mr.Crooks cycle, suddenly throttled into silence.The old man did indeed know a lot about the local plants, I discovered.Not only where they were to be found but their medicinal uses, and how to prepare them.I wished I had brought a notebook to get it all down, but listened intently to the cracked old voice, and did my best to commit the information to memory as I stowed our specimens in the heavy plant presses.We stopped for a packed luncheon near the base of a curious flat topped hill.Green as most of its neighbors, with the same rocky juts and crags, it had something different: a well worn path leading up one side and disappearing abruptly behind a granite outcrop.Whats up there?I asked, gesturing with a ham sandwich.It seems a difficult place for picnicking.Ah.Mr.Crook glanced at the hill.Thats Craigh na Dun, lass.Id meant to show ye after our meal.Really?Is there something special about it?Oh, aye, he answered, but refused to elaborate further, merely saying that Id see when I saw.I had some fears about his ability to climb such a steep path, but these evaporated as I found myself panting in his wake.At last, Mr.Crook extended a gnarled hand and pulled me up over the rim of the hill.There tis.He waved a hand with a sort of proprietorial gesture.Why, its a henge!I said, delighted.A miniature henge!Because of the war, it had been several years since I had last visited Salisbury Plain, but Frank and I had seen Stonehenge soon after we were married.Like the other tourists wandering awed among the huge standing stones, we had gaped at the Altar Stone (were ancient Druid priests performed their dreadful uman sacrifices, announced the sonorous Cockney tour guide accompanying a busload of Italian tourists, who all dutifully took photographs of the rather ordinary looking stone block).Out of the same passion for exactness that made Frank adjust his ties on the hanger so that the ends hung precisely even, we had even trekked around the circumference of the circle, pacing off the distance between the Z holes and the Y holes, and counting the lintels in the Sarsen Circle, the outermost ring of monstrous uprights.Three hours later, we knew how many Y and Z holes there were (fifty nine, if you care; I didnt), but had no more clue to the purpose of the structure than had the dozens of amateur and professional archaeologists who had crawled over the site for the last five hundred years.No lack of opinions, of course.Life among academics had taught me that a well expressed opinion is usually better than a badly expressed fact, so far as professional advancement goes.A temple.A burial ground.An astronomical observatory.A place of execution (hence the inaptly named Slaughter Stone that lies to one side, half sunk in its own pit).An open air market.I liked this last suggestion, visualizing Megalithic housewives strolling between the lintels, baskets on their arms, critically judging the glaze on the latest shipment of red clay beakers and listening skeptically to the claims of stone age bakers and vendors of deer bone shovels and amber beads.The only thing I could see against that hypothesis was the presence of bodies under the Altar Stone and cremated remains in the Z holes.Unless these were the hapless remains of merchants accused of short weighting the customers, it seemed a bit unsanitary to be burying people in the marketplace.There were no signs of burial in the miniature henge atop the hill.By miniature, I mean only that the circle of standing stones was smaller than Stonehenge; each stone was still twice my own height, and massive in proportion.I had heard from another tour guide at Stonehenge that these stone circles occur all over Britain and Europesome in better repair than others, some differing slightly in orientation or form, all of purpose and origin unknown.Mr.Crook stood smiling benignly as I prowled among the stones, pausing now and then to touch one gently, as though my touch could make an impression on the monumental boulders.Some of the standing stones were brindled, striped with dim colors.Others were speckled with flakes of mica that caught the morning sun with a cheerful shimmer.All of them were remarkably different from the clumps of native stone that thrust out of the bracken all around.Whoever built the stone circles, and for whatever purpose, thought it important enough to have quarried, shaped, and transported special stone blocks for the erection of their testimonial.Shapedhow?Transportedhow, and from what unimaginable distance?My husband would be fascinated, I told Mr.Crook, stopping to thank him for showing me the place and the plants.Ill bring him up to see it later.The gnarled old man gallantly offered me an arm at the top of the trail.I took it, deciding after one look down the precipitous decline that in spite of his age, he was likely steadier on his pins than I was.* * *    I swung down the road that afternoon toward the village, to fetch Frank from the vicarage.I happily breathed in that heady Highland mix of heather, sage, and broom, spiced here and there with chimney smoke and the tang of fried herring, as I passed the scattered cottages.The village lay nestled in a small declivity at the foot of one of those soaring crags that rise so steeply from the Highland moors.Those cottages near the road were nice.The bloom of postwar prosperity had spread as far as a new coat of paint, and even the manse, which must be at least a hundred years old, sported bright yellow trim around its sagging windowframes.The vicars housekeeper answered the door, a tall, stringy woman with three strands of artificial pearls round her neck.Hearing who I was, she welcomed me in and towed me down a long, narrow, dark hallway, lined with sepia engravings of people who may have been famous personages of their time, or cherished relatives of the present vicar, but might as well have been the Royal Family, for all I could see of their features in the gloom.By contrast, the vicars study was blinding with light from the enormous windows that ran nearly from ceiling to floor in one wall.An easel near the fireplace, bearing a half finished oil of black cliffs against the evening sky, showed the reason for the windows, which must have been added long after the house was built.Frank and a short, tubby man with a clerical dog collar were cozily poring over a mass of tattered paper on the desk by the far wall.Frank barely looked up in greeting, but the vicar politely left off his explanations and hurried over to clasp my hand, his round face beaming with sociable delight.Mrs.Randall!he said, pumping my hand heartily.How nice to see you again.And youve come just in time to hear the news!News?Casting an eye on the grubbiness and typeface of the papers on the desk, I calculated the date of the news in question as being likely around 1750.Not precisely stop the presses, then.Yes, indeed.Weve been tracing your husbands ancestor, Jack Randall, through the army dispatches of the period.The vicar leaned close, speaking out of the side of his mouth like a gangster in an American film.Ive, er, borrowed the original dispatches from the local Historical Society files.Youll be careful not to tell anyone?Amused, I agreed that I would not reveal his deadly secret, and looked about for a comfortable chair in which to receive the latest revelations from the eighteenth century.The wing chair nearest the windows looked suitable, but as I reached to turn it toward the desk, I discovered that it was already occupied.The inhabitant, a small boy with a shock of glossy black hair, was curled up in the depths of the chair, sound asleep.Roger!The vicar, coming to assist me, was as surprised as I.  The boy, startled out of sleep, shot bolt upright, wide eyes the color of moss.Now what are you up to in here, you young scamp?The vicar was scolding affectionately.Oh, fell asleep reading the comic papers again?He scooped up the brightly colored pages and handed them to the lad.Run along now, Roger, I have business with the Randalls.Oh, wait, Ive forgotten to introduce youMrs.Randall, this is my son, Roger.I was a bit surprised.If ever Id seen a confirmed bachelor, I would have thought the Reverend Wakefield was it.Still, I took the politely proffered paw and shook it warmly, resisting the urge to wipe a certain residual stickiness on my skirt.The Reverend Wakefield looked fondly after the boy as he trooped off toward the kitchen.My nieces son, really, he confided.Father shot down over the Channel, and mother killed in the Blitz, though, so Ive taken him.How kind of you, I murmured, thinking of Uncle Lamb.He, too, had died in the Blitz, killed by a hit to the auditorium of the British Museum, where he had been lecturing.Knowing him, I thought his main feeling would have been gratification that the wing of Persian antiquities next door had escaped.Not at all, not at all.The vicar flapped a hand in embarrassment.Nice to have a bit of young life about the house.Now, do have a seat.Frank began talking even before I had set my handbag down.The most amazing luck, Claire, he enthused, thumbing through the dog eared pile.The vicars located a whole series of military dispatches that mention Jonathan Randall.Well, a good deal of the prominence seems to have been Captain Randalls own doing, the vicar observed, taking some of the papers from Frank.He was in command of the garrison at Fort William for four years or so, but he seems to have spent quite a bit of his time harassing the Scottish countryside above the Border on behalf of the Crown.This lothe gingerly separated a stack of papers and laid them on the deskis reports of complaints lodged against the Captain by various families and estate holders, claiming everything from interference with their maidservants by the soldiers of the garrison to outright theft of horses, not to mention assorted instances of insult, unspecified.I was amused.So you have the proverbial horse thief in your family tree?I said to Frank.He shrugged, unperturbed.He was what he was, and nothing I can do about it.I only want to find out.The complaints arent all that odd, for that particular time period; the English in general, and the army in particular, were rather notably unpopular throughout the Highlands.No, whats odd is that nothing ever seems to have come of the complaints, even the serious ones.The vicar, unable to keep still for long, broke in.Thats right.Not that officers then were held to anything like modern standards; they could do very much as they liked in minor matters.But this is odd.Its not that the complaints are investigated and dismissed; theyre just never mentioned again.You know what I suspect, Randall?Your ancestor must have had a patron.Someone who could protect him from the censure of his superiors.Frank scratched his head, squinting at the dispatches.You could be right.Had to have been someone quite powerful, though.High up in the army hierarchy, perhaps, or maybe a member of the nobility.Yes, or possibly The vicar was interrupted in his theories by the entrance of the housekeeper, Mrs.Graham.Ive brought ye a wee bit of refreshment, gentlemen, she announced, setting the tea tray firmly in the center of the desk, from which the vicar rescued his precious dispatches in the nick of time.She looked me over with a shrewd eye, assessing the twitching limbs and faint glaze over the eyeballs.Ive brought but the two cups, for I thought perhaps Mrs.Randall would care to join me in the kitchen.Ive a bit of I didnt wait for the conclusion of her invitation, but leapt to my feet with alacrity.I could hear the theories breaking out again behind me as we pushed through the swinging door that led to the manses kitchen.The tea was green, hot and fragrant, with bits of leaf swirling through the liquid.Mmm, I said, setting the cup down.Its been a long time since I tasted Oolong.Mrs.Graham nodded, beaming at my pleasure in her refreshments.She had clearly gone to some trouble, laying out handmade lace mats beneath the eggshell cups and providing thick clotted cream with the scones.Aye, I couldna get it during the War, ye know.Its the best for the readings, though.Had a terrible time with that Earl Grey.The leaves fall apart so fast, its hard to tell anything at all.Oh, you read tea leaves?I asked, mildly amused.Nothing could be farther from the popular conception of the gypsy fortune teller than Mrs.Graham, with her short, iron grey perm and triple stranded pearl choker.A swallow of tea ran visibly down the long, stringy neck and disappeared beneath the gleaming beads.Why, certainly I do, my dear.Just as my grandmother taught me, and her grandmother before her.Drink up your cup, and Ill see what you have there.She was silent for a long time, once in a while tilting the cup to catch the light, or rolling it slowly between lean palms to get a different angle.She set the cup down carefully, as though afraid it might blow up in her face.The grooves on either side of her mouth had deepened, and her brows pressed together in what looked like puzzlement.Well, she said finally.Thats one of the stranger ones Ive seen.Oh?I was still amused, but beginning to be curious.Am I going to meet a tall dark stranger, or journey across the sea?Could be.Mrs.Graham had caught my ironic tone, and echoed it, smiling slightly.And could not.Thats whats odd about your cup, my dear.Everything in its contradictory.Theres the curved leaf for a journey, but its crossed by the broken one that means staying put.And strangers there are, to be sure, several of them.And one of thems your husband, if I read the leaves aright.My amusement dissipated somewhat.After six years apart, and six months together, my husband was still something of a stranger.Though I failed to see how a tea leaf could know it.Mrs.Grahams brow was still furrowed.Let me see your hand, child, she said.The hand holding mine was bony, but surprisingly warm.A scent of lavender water emanated from the neat part of the grizzled head bent over my palm.She stared into my hand for quite a long time, now and then tracing one of the lines with a finger, as though following a map whose roads all petered out in sandy washes and deserted wastes.Well, what is it?I asked, trying to maintain a light air.Or is my fate too horrible to be revealed?Mrs.Graham raised quizzical eyes and looked thoughtfully at my face, but retained her hold on my hand.She shook her head, pursing her lips.Oh, no, my dear.Its not your fate is in your hand.Only the seed of it.The birdlike head cocked to one side, considering.The lines in your hand change, ye know.At another point in your life, they may be quite different than they are now.I didnt know that.I thought you were born with them, and that was that.I was repressing an urge to jerk my hand away.Whats the point of palm reading, then?I didnt wish to sound rude, but I found this scrutiny a bit unsettling, especially following on the heels of that tea leaf reading.Mrs.Graham smiled unexpectedly, and folded my fingers closed over my palm.Why, the lines of your palm show what ye are, dear.Thats why they changeor should.They dont, in some people; those unlucky enough never to change in themselves, but there are few like that.She gave my folded hand a squeeze and patted it.I doubt that youre one of those.Your hand shows quite a lot of change already, for one so young.That would likely be the War, of course, she said, as though to herself.I was curious again, and opened my palm voluntarily.What am I, then, according to my hand?Mrs.Graham frowned, but did not pick up my hand again.I canna just say.Its odd, for most hands have a likeness to them.Mind, Id no just say that its see one, youve seen them all, but its often like thatthere are patterns, you know.She smiled suddenly, an oddly engaging grin, displaying very white and patently false teeth.Thats how a fortune teller works, you know.I do it for the church fete every yearor did, before the War; suppose Ill do it again now.But a girl comes into the tentand there am I, done up in a turban with a peacock feather borrowed from Mr.Donaldson, and robes of oriental splendorthats the vicars dressing gown, all over peacocks it is and yellow as the sunanyway, I look her over while I pretend to be watching her hand, and I see shes got her blouse cut down to her breakfast, cheap scent, and earrings down to her shoulders.I neednt have a crystal ball to be tellin her shell have a child before the next years fete.Mrs.Graham, paused, grey eyes alight with mischief.Though if the hand youre holding is bare, its tactful to predict first that shell marry soon.I laughed, and so did she.So you dont look at their hands at all, then?I asked.Except to check for rings?She looked surprised.Oh, of course you do.Its just that you know ahead of time what youll see.Generally.She nodded at my open hand.But that is not a pattern Ive seen before.The large thumb, nowshe did lean forward then and touch it lightlythat wouldnt change much.Means youre strong minded, and have a will not easily crossed.She twinkled at me.Reckon your husband could have told ye that.Likewise about that one.She pointed to the fleshy mound at the base of the thumb.What is it?The Mount of Venus, its called.She pursed her thin lips primly together, though the corners turned irrepressibly up.In a man, yed say it means he likes the lasses.For a woman, tis a bit different.To be polite about it, Ill make a bit of a prediction for you, and say your husband isna like to stray far from your bed.She gave a surprisingly deep and bawdy chuckle, and I blushed slightly.The elderly housekeeper pored over my hand again, stabbing a pointed forefinger here and there to mark her words.Now, there, a well marked lifeline; youre in good health, and likely to stay so.The lifelines interrupted, meaning your lifes changed markedlywell, thats true of us all, is it not?But yours is more chopped up, like, than I usually see; all bits and pieces.And your marriage line, nowshe shook her head againits divided; thats not unusual, means two marriages  My reaction was slight, and immediately suppressed, but she caught the flicker and looked up at once.I thought she probably was quite a shrewd fortune teller, at that.The grey head shook reassuringly at me.No, no, lass.It doesna mean anythings like to happen to your good man.Its only that if it did, she emphasized the if with a slight squeeze of my hand, youd not be one to pine away and waste the rest of your life in mourning.What it means is, youre one of those can love again if your first loves lost.She squinted nearsightedly at my palm, running a short, ridged nail gently down the deep marriage line.But most divided lines are brokenyours is forked.She looked up with a roguish smile.Sure youre not a bigamist, on the quiet, like?I shook my head, laughing.No.When would I have the time?Then I turned my hand, showing the outer edge.Ive heard that small marks on the side of the hand indicate how many children youll have?My tone was casual, I hoped.The edge of my palm was disappointingly smooth.Mrs.Graham flicked a scornful hand at this idea.Pah!After yeve had a bairn or two, ye might show lines there.More like youd have them on your face.Proves nothing at all beforehand.Oh, it doesnt?I was foolishly relieved to hear this.I was going to ask whether the deep lines across the base of my wrist meant anything (a potential for suicide?), but we were interrupted at that point by the Reverend Wakefield coming into the kitchen bearing the empty tea cups.He set them on the drainboard and began a loud and clumsy fumbling through the cupboard, obviously in hopes of provoking help.Mrs.Graham sprang to her feet to defend the sanctity of her kitchen, and pushing the Reverend adroitly to one side, set about assembling tea things on a tray for the study.He drew me to one side, safely out of the way.Why dont you come to the study and have another cup of tea with me and your husband, Mrs.Randall?Weve made really a most gratifying discovery.I could see that in spite of outward composure, he was bursting with the glee of whatever they had found, like a small boy with a toad in his pocket.Plainly I was going to have to go and read Captain Jonathan Randalls laundry bill, his receipt for boot repairs, or some document of similar fascination.Frank was so absorbed in the tattered documents that he scarcely looked up when I entered the study.He reluctantly surrendered them to the vicars podgy hands, and came round to stand behind the Reverend Wakefield and peer over his shoulder, as though he could not bear to let the papers out of his sight for a moment.Yes?I said politely, fingering the dirty bits of paper.Ummm, yes, very interesting.In fact, the spidery handwriting was so faded and so ornate that it hardly seemed worth the trouble of deciphering it.One sheet, better preserved than the rest, had some sort of crest at the top.The Duke ofSandringham, is it?I asked, peering at the crest, with its faded leopard couchant, and the printing below, more legible than the handwriting.Yes, indeed, the vicar said, beaming even more.An extinct title, now, you know.I didnt, but nodded intelligently, being no stranger to historians in the manic grip of discovery.It was seldom necessary to do more than nod periodically, saying Oh, really?or How perfectly fascinating!at appropriate intervals.After a certain amount of deferring back and forth between Frank and the vicar, the latter won the honor of telling me about their discovery.Evidently, all this rubbish made it appear that Franks ancestor, the notorious Black Jack Randall, had not been merely a gallant soldier for the Crown, but a trustedand secretagent of the Duke of Sandringham.Almost an agent provocateur, wouldnt you say, Dr.Randall?The vicar graciously handed the ball back to Frank, who seized it and ran.Yes, indeed.The language is very guarded, of course.He turned the pages gently with a scrubbed forefinger.Oh, really?I said.But it seems from this that Jonathan Randall was entrusted with the job of stirring up Jacobite sentiments, if any existed, among the prominent Scottish families in his area.The point being to smoke out any baronets and clan chieftains who might be harboring secret sympathies in that direction.But thats odd.Wasnt Sandringham a suspected Jacobite himself?Frank turned to the vicar, a frown of inquiry on his face.The vicars smooth, bald head creased in an identical frown.Why, yes, I believe youre right.But wait, lets check in Cameronhe made a dive for the bookshelf, crammed with calf bound volumeshes sure to mention Sandringham.How perfectly fascinating, I murmured, allowing my attention to wander to the huge corkboard that covered one wall of the study from floor to ceiling.It was covered with an amazing assortment of things; mostly papers of one sort or another, gas bills, correspondence, notices from the Diocesan Council, loose pages of novels, notes in the vicars own hand, but also small items like keys, bottle caps, and what appeared to be small car parts, attached with tacks and string.I browsed idly through the miscellanea, keeping half an ear tuned to the argument going on behind me.(The Duke of Sandringham probably was a Jacobite, they decided. )My attention was caught by a genealogical chart, tacked up with special care in a spot by itself, using four tacks, one to a corner.The top of the chart included names dated in the early seventeenth century.But it was the name at the bottom of the chart that had caught my eye: Roger W.(MacKenzie) Wakefield, it read.Excuse me, I said, interrupting a final sputter of dispute as to whether the leopard in the Dukes crest had a lily in its paw, or was it meant to be a crocus?Is this your sons chart?Eh?Oh, why, yes, yes it is.Distracted, the vicar hurried over, beaming once more.He detached the chart tenderly from the wall and laid it on the table in front of me.I didnt want him to forget his own family, you see, he explained.Its quite an old lineage, back to the sixteen hundreds.His stubby forefinger traced the line of descent almost reverently.I gave him my own name because it seemed more suitable, as he lives here, but I didnt want him to forget where he came from.He made an apologetic grimace.Im afraid my own family is nothing to boast of, genealogically.Vicars and curates, with the occasional bookseller thrown in for variety, and only traceable back to 1762 or so.Rather poor record keeping, you know, he said, wagging his head remorsefully over the lethargy of his ancestors.It was growing late by the time we finally left the vicarage, with the vicar promising to take the letters to town for copying first thing in the morning.Frank babbled happily of spies and Jacobites most of the way back to Mrs.Bairds.Finally, though, he noticed my quietness.What is it, love?he asked, taking my arm solicitously.Not feeling well?This was asked with a mingled tone of concern and hope.No, Im quite well.I was only thinking I hesitated, because we had discussed this matter before.I was thinking about Roger.Roger?I gave a sigh of impatience.Really, Frank!You can be sooblivious!Roger, the Reverend Wakefields son.Oh.Yes, of course, he said vaguely.Charming child.What about him?Wellonly that there are a lot of children like that.Orphaned, you know.He gave me a sharp look, and shook his head.No, Claire.Really, Id like to, but Ive told you how I feel about adoption.Its justI couldnt feel properly toward a child thats notwell, not of my blood.No doubt thats ridiculous and selfish of me, but there it is.Maybe Ill change my mind in time, but now.We walked a few steps in a barbed silence.Suddenly he stopped and turned to me, gripping my hands.Claire, he said huskily, I want our child.Youre the most important thing in the world to me.I want you to be happy, above all else, but I wantwell, I want to keep you to myself.Im afraid a child from outside, one we had no real relationship with, would seem an intruder, and Id resent it.But to be able to give you a child, see it grow in you, see it bornthen Id feel as though it were more anextension of you, perhaps.And me.A real part of the family.His eyes were wide, pleading.Yes, all right.I understand.I was willing to abandon the topicfor now.I turned to go on walking, but he reached out and took me in his arms.Claire.I love you.The tenderness in his voice was overwhelming, and I leaned my head against his jacket, feeling his warmth and the strength of his arms around me.I love you too.We stood locked together for a moment, swaying slightly in the wind that swept down the road.Suddenly Frank drew back a bit, smiling down at me.Besides, he said softly, smoothing the wind blown hair back from my face, we havent given up yet, have we?I smiled back.No.He took my hand, tucking it snugly beneath his elbow, and we turned toward our lodgings.Game for another try?Yes.Why not?We strolled, hand in hand, back toward the Gereside Road.It was the sight of the Baragh Mhor, the Pictish stone that stands at the corner of the road there, that made me remember things ancient.I forgot!I exclaimed.I have something exciting to show you.Frank looked down at me and pulled me closer.He squeezed my hand.So have I, he said, grinning.You can show me yours tomorrow.* * *    When tomorrow came, though, we had other things to do.I had forgotten that we had planned a day trip to the Great Glen of Loch Ness.It was a long drive through the Glen, and we left early in the morning, before sunup.After the hurry to the waiting car through the freezing dawn, it was cozy to relax under the rug and feel the warmth stealing back into my hands and feet.Along with it came a most delicious drowsiness, and I fell blissfully asleep against Franks shoulder, my last conscious sight the drivers head in red rimmed silhouette against the dawning sky.It was after nine when we arrived, and the guide Frank had called for was awaiting us on the edge of the loch with a small sailing skiff.An it suits ye, sir, I thought wed take a wee sail down the loch side to Urquhart Castle.Perhaps well sup a bit there, before goin on.The guide, a dour looking little man in weather beaten cotton shirt and twill trousers, stowed the picnic hamper tidily beneath the seat, and offered me a callused hand down into the well of the boat.It was a beautiful day, with the burgeoning greenery of the steep banks blurring in the ruffled surface of the loch.Our guide, despite his dour appearance, was knowledgeable and talkative, pointing out the islands, castles, and ruins that rimmed the long, narrow loch.Yonder, thats Urquhart Castle.He pointed to a smooth faced wall of stone, barely visible through the trees.Or whats left of it.Twas cursed by the witches of the Glen, and saw one unhappiness after another.He told us the story of Mary Grant, daughter of the laird of Urquhart Castle, and her lover, Donald Donn, poet son of MacDonald of Bohuntin.Forbidden to meet because of her fathers objection to the latters habits of lifting any cattle he came across (an old and honorable Highland profession, the guide assured us), they met anyway.The father got wind of it, Donald was lured to a false rendezvous and thus taken.Condemned to die, he begged to be beheaded like a gentleman, rather than hanged as a felon.This request was granted, and the young man led to the block, repeating The Devil will take the Laird of Grant out of his shoes, and Donald Donn shall not be hanged.He wasnt, and legend reports that as his severed head rolled from the block, it spoke, saying, Mary, lift ye my head.I shuddered, and Frank put an arm around me.Theres a bit of one of his poems left, he said quietly.Donald Donns.It goes:  Tomorrow I shall be on a hill, without a head.Have you no compassion for my sorrowful maiden,  My Mary, the fair and tender eyed?I took his hand and squeezed it lightly.As story after story of treachery, murder, and violence were recounted, it seemed as though the loch had earned its sinister reputation.What about the monster?I asked, peering over the side into the murky depths.It seemed entirely appropriate to such a setting.Our guide shrugged and spat into the water.Weel, the lochs queer, and no mistake.Theres stories, to be sure, of something old and evil that once lived in the depths.Sacrifices were made to itkine, and sometimes even wee bairns, flung into the water in withy baskets.He spat again.And some say the lochs bottomlessgot a hole in the center deeper than anything else in Scotland.On the other handthe guides crinkled eyes crinkled a bit more twas a family here from Lancashire a few years ago, cam rushin to the police station in Invermoriston, screamin as theyd seen the monster come out o the water and hide in the bracken.Said twas a terrible creature, covered wi red hair and fearsome horns, and chewin something, wi the blood all dripping from its mouth.He held up a hand, stemming my horrified exclamation.The constable they sent to see cam back and said, weel, bar the drippin blood, twas a verra accurate descriptionhe paused for effectof a nice Highland cow, chewin her cud in the bracken!We sailed down half the length of the loch before disembarking for a late lunch.We met the car there and motored back through the Glen, observing nothing more sinister than a red fox in the road, who looked up startled, a small animal of some sort hanging limp in its jaws, as we zoomed around a curve.He leaped for the side of the road and swarmed up the bank, swift as a shadow.It was very late indeed when we finally staggered up the path to Mrs.Bairds, but we clung together on the doorstep as Frank groped for the key, still laughing over the events of the day.It wasnt until we were undressing for bed that I remembered to mention the miniature henge on Craigh na Dun to Frank.His fatigue vanished at once.Really?And you know where it is?How marvelous, Claire!He beamed and began rattling through his suitcase.What are you looking for?The alarm clock, he replied, hauling it out.Whatever for?I asked in astonishment.I want to be up in time to see them.Who?The witches.Witches?Who told you there are witches?The vicar, Frank answered, clearly enjoying the joke.His housekeepers one of them.I thought of the dignified Mrs.Graham and snorted derisively.Dont be ridiculous!Well, not witches, actually.There have been witches all over Scotland for hundreds of yearsthey burnt them til well into the eighteenth centurybut this lot is really meant to be Druids, or something of the sort.I dont suppose its actually a covennot devil worship, I dont mean.But the vicar said there was a local group that still observes rituals on the old sun feast days.He cant afford to take too much interest in such goings on, you see, because of his position, but hes much too curious a man to ignore it altogether, either.He didnt know where the ceremonies took place, but if theres a stone circle nearby, that must be it.He rubbed his hands together in anticipation.What luck!* * *    Getting up once in the dark to go adventuring is a lark.Twice in two days smacks of masochism.No nice warm car with rugs and thermoses this time, either.I stumbled sleepily up the hill behind Frank, tripping over roots and stubbing my toes on stones.It was cold and misty, and I dug my hands deeper into the pockets of my cardigan.One final push up over the crest of the hill, and the henge was before us, the stones barely visible in the somber light of predawn.Frank stood stock still, admiring them, while I subsided onto a convenient rock, panting.Beautiful, he murmured.He crept silently to the outer edge of the ring, his shadowy figure disappearing among the larger shadows of the stones.Beautiful they were, and bloody eerie too.I shivered, and not entirely from the cold.If whoever had made them had meant them to impress, theyd known what they were doing.Frank was back in a moment.No one here yet, he whispered suddenly from behind me, making me jump.Come on, Ive found a place we can watch from.The light was coming up from the east now, just a tinge of paler grey on the horizon, but enough to keep me from stumbling as Frank led me through a gap he had found in some alder bushes near the top of the path.There was a tiny clearing inside the clump of bushes, barely enough for the two of us to stand shoulder to shoulder.The path was clearly visible, though, and so was the interior of the stone circle, no more than twenty feet away.Not for the first time, I wondered just what kind of work Frank had done during the War.He certainly seemed to know a lot about maneuvering soundlessly in the dark.Drowsy as I was, I wanted nothing more than to curl up under a cozy bush and go back to sleep.There wasnt room for that, though, so I continued to stand, peering down the steep path in search of oncoming Druids.I was getting a crick in my back, and my feet ached, but it couldnt take long; the streak of light in the east had turned a pale pink, and I supposed it was less than half an hour til dawn.The first one moved almost as silently as Frank.There was only the faintest of rattles as her feet dislodged a pebble near the crest of the hill, and then the neat grey head rose silently into sight.Mrs.Graham.So it was true, then.The vicars housekeeper was sensibly dressed in tweed skirt and woolly coat, with a white bundle under one arm.She disappeared behind one of the standing stones, quiet as a ghost.They came quite quickly after that, in ones and twos and threes, with subdued giggles and whispers on the path that were quickly shushed as they came into sight of the circle.I recognized a few.Here came Mrs.Buchanan, the village postmistress, blond hair freshly permed and the scent of Evening in Paris wafting strongly from its waves.I suppressed a laugh.So this was a modern day Druid!There were fifteen in all, and all women, ranging in age from Mrs.Grahams sixty odd years to a young woman in her early twenties, whom I had seen pushing a pram round the shops two days before.All of them were dressed for rough walking, with bundles beneath their arms.With a minimum of chat, they disappeared behind stones or bushes, emerging empty handed and bare armed, completely clad in white.I caught the scent of laundry soap as one brushed by our clump of bushes, and recognized the garments as bedsheets, wrapped about the body and knotted at the shoulder.They assembled outside the ring of stones, in a line from eldest to youngest, and stood in silence, waiting.The light in the east grew stronger.As the sun edged its way above the horizon, the line of women began to move, walking slowly between two of the stones.The leader took them directly to the center of the circle, and led them round and round, still moving slowly, stately as swans in a circular procession.The leader suddenly stopped, raised her arms, and stepped into the center of the circle.Raising her face toward the pair of easternmost stones, she called out in a high voice.Not loud, but clear enough to be heard throughout the circle.The still mist caught the words and made them echo, as though they came from all around, from the stones themselves.Whatever the call was, it was echoed again by the dancers.For dancers they now became.Not touching, but with arms outstretched toward each other, they bobbed and weaved, still moving in a circle.Suddenly the circle split in half.Seven of the dancers moved clockwise, still in a circular motion.The others moved in the opposite direction.The two semicircles passed each other at increasing speeds, sometimes forming a complete circle, sometimes a double line.And in the center, the leader stood stock still, giving again and again that mournful high pitched call, in a language long since dead.They should have been ridiculous, and perhaps they were.A collection of women in bedsheets, many of them stout and far from agile, parading in circles on top of a hill.But the hair prickled on the back of my neck at the sound of their call.They stopped as one, and turned to face the rising sun, standing in the form of two semicircles, with a path lying clear between the halves of the circle thus formed.As the sun rose above the horizon, its light flooded between the eastern stones, knifed between the halves of the circle, and struck the great split stone on the opposite side of the henge.The dancers stood for a moment, frozen in the shadows to either side of the beam of light.Then Mrs.Graham said something, in the same strange language, but this time in a speaking voice.She pivoted and walked, back straight, iron grey waves glinting in the sun, along the path of light.Without a word, the dancers fell in step behind her.They passed one by one through the cleft in the main stone and disappeared in silence.We crouched in the alders until the women, now laughing and chatting normally, had retrieved their clothes and set off in a group down the hill, headed for coffee at the vicarage.Goodness!I stretched, trying to get the kinks out of my legs and back.That was quite a sight, wasnt it?Wonderful!enthused Frank.I wouldnt have missed it for the world.He slipped out of the bush like a snake, leaving me to disentangle myself while he cast about the interior of the circle, nose to the ground like a bloodhound.Whatever are you looking for?I asked.I entered the circle with some hesitation, but day was fully come, and the stones, while still impressive, had lost a good deal of the brooding menace of dawn light.Marks, he replied, crawling about on hands and knees, eyes intent on the short turf.How did they know where to start and stop?Good question.I dont see anything.Casting an eye over the ground, though, I did see an interesting plant growing near the base of one of the tall stones.Myosotis?No, probably not; this had orange centers to the deep blue flowers.Intrigued, I started toward it.Frank, with keener hearing than I, leaped to his feet and seized my arm, hurrying me out of the circle a moment before one of the mornings dancers entered from the other side.It was Miss Grant, the tubby little woman who, suitably enough in view of her figure, ran the sweets and pastries shop in the towns High Street.She peered nearsightedly around, then fumbled in her pocket for her spectacles.Jamming these on her nose, she strolled about the circle, at last pouncing on the lost hair clip for which she had returned.Having restored it to its place in her thick, glossy locks, she seemed in no hurry to return to business.Instead, she seated herself on a boulder, leaned back against one of the stone giants in comradely fashion and lighted a leisurely cigarette.Frank gave a muted sigh of exasperation beside me.Well, he said, resigned, wed best go.She could sit there all morning, by the looks of her.And I didnt see any obvious markings in any case.Perhaps we could come back later, I suggested, still curious about the blue flowered vine.Yes, all right.But he had plainly lost interest in the circle itself, being now absorbed in the details of the ceremony.He quizzed me relentlessly on the way down the path, urging me to remember as closely as I could the exact wording of the calls, and the timing of the dance.Norse, he said at last, with satisfaction.The root words are Ancient Norse, Im almost sure of it.But the dance, he shook his head, pondering.No, the dance is very much older.Not that there arent Viking circle dances, he said, raising his brows censoriously, as though I had suggested there werent.But that shifting pattern with the double line business, thatshmm, its likewell, some of the patterns on the Beaker Folk glazeware show a pattern rather like that, but then againhmm.He dropped into one of his scholarly trances, muttering to himself from time to time.The trance was broken only when he stumbled unexpectedly over an obstacle near the bottom of the hill.He flung his arms out with a startled cry as his feet went out from under him and he rolled untidily down the last few feet of the path, fetching up in a clump of cow parsley.I dashed down the hill after him, but found him already sitting up among the quivering stems by the time I reached the bottom.Are you all right?I asked, though I could see that he was.I think so.He passed a hand dazedly over his brow, smoothing back the dark hair.What did I trip over?This.I held up a sardine tin, discarded by some earlier visitor.One of the menaces of civilization.Ah.He took it from me, peered inside, then tossed it over one shoulder.Pity its empty.Im feeling rather hungry after that excursion.Shall we see what Mrs.Baird can provide in the way of a late breakfast?We might, I said, smoothing the last strands of hair for him.And then again, we might make it an early lunch instead.My eyes met his.Ah, he said again, with a completely different tone.He ran a hand slowly up my arm and up the side of my neck, his thumb gently tickling the lobe of my ear.So we might.If you arent too hungry, I said.The other hand found its way behind my back.Palm spread, it pressed me gently toward him, fingers stroking lower and lower.His mouth opened slightly and he breathed, ever so lightly, down the neck of my dress, his warm breath tickling the tops of my breasts.He laid me carefully back in the grass, the feathery blossoms of the cow parsley seeming to float in the air around his head.He bent forward and kissed me, softly, and kept on kissing me as he unbuttoned my dress, one button at a time, teasing, pausing to reach a hand inside and play with the swelling tips of my breasts.At last he had the dress laid open from neck to waist.Ah, he said again, in yet another tone.Like white velvet.He spoke hoarsely, and his hair had fallen forward again, but he made no attempt to brush it back.He sprang the clasp of my brassiere with one accomplished flick of the thumb, and bent to pay a skilled homage to my breasts.Then he drew back, and cupping my breasts with both hands, drew his palms slowly down to meet between the rising mounds, and without stopping, drew them softly outward again, tracing the line of my rib cage clear to the back.Up and again, down and around, until I moaned and turned toward him.He sank his lips onto mine, and pressed me toward him until our hips fitted tightly together.He bent his head to mine, nibbling softly around the rim of my ear.The hand stroking my back slipped lower and lower, stopping suddenly in surprise.It felt again, then Frank raised his head and looked down at me, grinning.Whats all this, then?he asked, in imitation of a village bobby.Or rather, whats not all this?Just being prepared, I said primly.Nurses are taught to anticipate contingencies.Really, Claire, he murmured, sliding his hand under my skirt and up my thigh to the soft, unprotected warmth between my legs, you are the most terrifyingly practical person I have ever known.* * *    Frank came up behind me as I sat in the parlor chair that evening, a large book spread out on my lap.What are you doing?he asked.His hands rested gently on my shoulders.Looking for that plant, I answered, sticking a finger between the pages to mind my place.The one I saw in the stone circle.See I flipped the book open.It could be in the Campanulaceae, or the Gentianaceae, the Polemoniaceae, the Boraginaceaethats most likely, I think, forget me notsbut it could even be a variant of this one, the Anemone patens.I pointed out a full color illustration of a pasqueflower.I dont think it was a gentian of any kind; the petals werent really rounded, but  Well, why not go back and get it?he suggested.Mr.Crook would lend you his old banger, perhaps, orno, Ive a better idea.Borrow Mrs.Bairds car, its safer.Its a short walk from the road to the foot of the hill.And then about a thousand yards, straight up, I said.Why are you so interested in that plant?I swiveled around to look up at him.The parlor lamp outlined his head with a thin gold line, like a medieval engraving of a saint.Its not the plant I care about.But if youre going up there anyway, I wish youd have a quick look around the outside of the stone circle.All right, I said obligingly.What for?Traces of fire, he said.In all the things Ive been able to read about Beltane, fire is always mentioned in the rituals, yet the women we saw this morning werent using any.I wondered if perhaps theyd set the Beltane fire the night before, then come back in the morning for the dance.Though historically its the cow herds who were supposed to set the fire.There wasnt any trace of fire inside the circle, he added.But we left before I thought of checking the outside.All right, I said again, and yawned.Two early risings in two days were taking their toll.I shut the book and stood up.Provided I dont have to get up before nine.It was in fact nearly eleven before I reached the stone circle.It was drizzling, and I was soaked through, not having thought to bring a mac.I made a cursory examination of the outside of the circle, but if there had ever been a fire there, someone had taken pains to remove its traces.The plant was easier to find.It was where I remembered it, near the foot of the tallest stone.I took several clippings of the vine and stowed them temporarily in my handkerchief, meaning to deal with them properly when I got back to Mrs.Bairds tiny car, where I had left the heavy plant presses.The tallest stone of the circle was cleft, with a vertical split dividing the two massive pieces.Oddly, the pieces had been drawn apart by some means.Though you could see that the facing surfaces matched, they were separated by a gap of two or three feet.There was a deep humming noise coming from somewhere near at hand.I thought there might be a beehive lodged in some crevice of the rock, and placed a hand on the stone in order to lean into the cleft.The stone screamed.I backed away as fast as I could, moving so quickly that I tripped on the short turf and sat down hard.I stared at the stone, sweating.I had never heard such a sound from anything living.There is no way to describe it, except to say that it was the sort of scream you might expect from a stone.It was horrible.The other stones began to shout.There was a noise of battle, and the cries of dying men and shattered horses.I shook my head violently to clear it, but the noise went on.I stumbled to my feet and staggered toward the edge of the circle.The sounds were all around me, making my teeth ache and my head spin.My vision began to blur.I do not know now whether I went toward the cleft in the main stone, or whether it was accidental, a blind drifting through the fog of noise.Once, traveling at night, I fell asleep in the passenger seat of a moving car, lulled by the noise and motion into an illusion of serene weightlessness.The driver of the car took a bridge too fast and lost control, and I woke from my floating dream straight into the glare of headlights and the sickening sensation of falling at high speed.That abrupt transition is as close as I can come to describing the feeling I experienced, but it falls woefully short.I could say that my field of vision contracted to a single dark spot, then disappeared altogether, leaving not darkness, but a bright void.I could say that I felt as though I were spinning, or as though I were being pulled inside out.All these things are true, yet none of them conveys the sense I had of complete disruption, of being slammed very hard against something that wasnt there.The truth is that nothing moved, nothing changed, nothing whatever appeared to happen and yet I experienced a feeling of elemental terror so great that I lost all sense of who, or what, or where I was.I was in the heart of chaos, and no power of mind or body was of use against it.I cannot really say I lost consciousness, but I was certainly not aware of myself for some time.I woke, if thats the word, when I stumbled on a rock near the bottom of the hill.I half slid the remaining few feet and fetched up on the thick tufted grass at the foot.I felt sick and dizzy.I crawled toward a stand of oak saplings and leaned against one to steady myself.There was a confused noise of shouting nearby, which reminded me of the sounds I had heard, and felt, in the stone circle.The ring of inhuman violence was lacking, though; this was the normal sound of human conflict, and I turned toward it.3    THE MAN IN THE WOOD    The men were some distance away when I saw them.Two or three, dressed in kilts, running like the dickens across a small clearing.There was a far off banging noise that I rather dazedly identified as gunshots.I was quite sure I was still hallucinating when the sound of shots was followed by the appearance of five or six men dressed in red coats and knee breeches, waving muskets.I blinked and stared.I moved my hand before my face and held up two fingers.I saw two fingers, all present and correct.No blurring of vision.I sniffed the air cautiously.The pungent odor of trees in spring and a faint whiff of clover from a clump near my feet.No olfactory delusions.I felt my head.No soreness anywhere.Concussion unlikely then.Pulse a little fast, but steady.The sound of distant yelling changed abruptly.There was a thunder of hooves, and several horses came charging in my direction, kilted Scots atop them, yodeling in Gaelic.I dodged out of the way with an agility that seemed to prove I had not been physically damaged, whatever my mental state.And then it came to me, as one of the redcoats, knocked flat by a fleeing Scot, rose and shook his fist theatrically after the horses.Of course.A film!I shook my head at my own slowness.They were shooting a costume drama of some sort, that was all.One of those Bonnie Prince in the heather sorts of things, no doubt.Well.Regardless of artistic merit, the film crew wouldnt thank me for introducing a note of historic inauthenticity into their shots.I doubled back into the wood, meaning to make a wide circle around the clearing and come out on the road where I had left the car.The going was more difficult than I had expected, though.The wood was a young one, and dense with underbrush that snagged my clothes.I had to go carefully through the spindly saplings, disentangling my skirts from the brambles as I went.Had he been a snake, I would have stepped on him.He stood so quietly among the saplings as almost to have been one of them, and I did not see him until a hand shot out and gripped me by the arm.Its companion clapped over my mouth as I was dragged backward into the oak grove, thrashing wildly in panic.My captor, whoever he was, seemed not much taller than I, but rather noticeably strong in the forearms.I smelled a faint flowery scent, as of lavender water, and something more spicy, mingled with the sharper reek of male perspiration.As the leaves whipped back into place in the path of our passage, though, I noticed something familiar about the hand and forearm clasped about my waist.I shook my head free of the restraint over my mouth.Frank!I burst out.What in heavens name are you playing at?I was torn between relief at finding him here and irritation at the horseplay.Unsettled as I was by my experience among the stones, I was in no mood for rough games.The hands released me, but even as I turned to him, I sensed something wrong.It was not only the unfamiliar cologne, but something more subtle.I stood stock still, feeling the hair prickle on my neck.You arent Frank, I whispered.I am not, he agreed, surveying me with considerable interest.Though Ive a cousin of that name.I doubt, though, that its he you have confused me with, madam.We do not resemble one another greatly.Whatever this mans cousin looked like, the man himself might have been Franks brother.There was the same lithe, spare build and fine drawn bones; the same chiseled lines of the face; the level brows and wide hazel eyes; and the same dark hair, curved smooth across the brow.But this mans hair was long, tied back from his face with a leather thong.And the gypsy skin showed the deep baked tan of months, no, years, of exposure to the weather, not the light golden color Franks had attained during our Scottish holiday.Just who are you?I demanded, feeling most uneasy.While Frank had numerous relatives and connections, I thought I knew all the British branch of the family.Certainly, there was no one who looked like this man among them.And surely Frank would have mentioned any near relative living in the Highlands?Not only mentioned him but insisted upon visiting him as well, armed with the usual collection of genealogical charts and notebooks, eager for any tidbits of family history about the famous Black Jack Randall.The stranger raised his brows at my question.Who am I?I might ask the same question, madam, and with considerably more justification.His eyes raked me slowly from head to toe, traveling with a sort of insolent appreciation over the thin peony sprigged cotton dress I wore, and lingering with an odd look of amusement on my legs.I did not at all understand the look, but it made me extremely nervous, and I backed up a step or two, until I was brought up sharp by bumping into a tree.The man finally removed his gaze and turned aside.It was as though he had taken a constraining hand off me, and I let out my breath in relief, not realizing until then that I had been holding it.He had turned to pick up his coat, thrown across the lowest branch of an oak sapling.He brushed some scattered leaves from it and began to put it on.I must have gasped, because he looked up again.The coat was a deep scarlet, long tailed and without lapels, frogged down the front.The buff linings of the turned back cuffs extended a good six inches up the sleeve, and a small coil of gold braid gleamed from one epaulet.It was a dragoons coat, an officers coat.Then it occurred to meof course, he was an actor, from the company I had seen on the other side of the wood.Though the short sword he proceeded to strap on seemed remarkably more realistic than any prop I had ever seen.I pressed myself against the bark of the tree behind me, and found it reassuringly solid.I crossed my arms protectively in front of me.Who the bloody hell are you?I demanded again.The question this time came out in a croak that sounded frightened even to my ears.As though not hearing me, he ignored the question, taking his time in the fastening of the frogs down the front of his coat.Only when he finished did he turn his attention to me once more.He bowed sardonically, hand over his heart.I am, madam, Jonathan Randall, Esquire, Captain of His Majestys Eighth Dragoons.At your service, madam.I broke and ran.My breath rasped in my chest as I tore through the screen of oak and alder, ignoring brambles, nettles, stones, fallen logs, everything in my path.I heard a shout behind me, but was much too panicked to determine its direction.I fled blindly, branches scratching my face and arms, ankles turning as I stepped in holes and stumbled on rocks.I had no room in my mind for any form of rational thought; I wanted only to get away from him.A heavy weight struck me hard in the lower back and I pitched forward at full length, landing with a thud that knocked the wind out of me.Rough hands flipped me onto my back, and Captain Jonathan Randall rose to his knees above me.He was breathing heavily and had lost his sword in the chase.He looked disheveled, dirty, and thoroughly annoyed.What the devil do you mean by running away like that?he demanded.A thick lock of dark brown hair had come loose and curved across his brow, making him look even more disconcertingly like Frank.He leaned down and grasped me by the arms.Still gasping for breath, I struggled to get free, but succeeded only in dragging him down on top of me.He lost his balance and collapsed at full length on me, flattening me once more.Surprisingly enough, this seemed to make his annoyance vanish.Oh, like that, is it?he said, with a chuckle.Well, Id be most willing to oblige you, Chuckie, but it happens youve chosen a rather inopportune moment.His weight pressed my hips to the ground, and a small rock was digging painfully into the small of my back.I squirmed to dislodge it.He ground his hips hard against mine, and his hands pinned my shoulders to the earth.My mouth fell open in outrage.What do you I began, but he ducked his head and kissed me, cutting short my expostulations.His tongue thrust into my mouth and explored me with a bold familiarity, roving and plunging, retreating and lunging again.Then, just as suddenly as he had begun, he pulled back.He patted my cheek.Quite nice, Chuck.Perhaps later, when Ive the leisure to attend to you properly.I had by this time recovered my breath, and I used it.I screamed directly into his earhole, and he jerked as though I had run a hot wire into it.I took advantage of the movement to get my knee up, and jabbed it into his exposed side, sending him sprawling into the leaf mold.I scrambled awkwardly to my feet.He rolled expertly, and came up alongside me.I glanced wildly around, looking for a way out, but we were flush up against the foot of one of those towering granite cliffs that just so abruptly from the soil of the Scottish Highlands.He had caught me at a point where the rock face broke inward, forming a shallow stony box.He blocked the entrance to the declivity, arms spread and braced between the rock walls, an expression of mingled anger and curiosity on his handsome dark face.Who were you with?he demanded.Frank, whoever he is?Ive no man by that name among my company.Or is it some man who lives nearby?He smiled derisively.You havent the smell of dung on your skin, so you havent been with a cottar.For that matter, you look a bit more expensive than the local farmers could afford.I clenched my fists and set my chin.Whatever this joker had in mind, I was having none of it.I havent the faintest idea what you are talking about, and Ill thank you to let me pass at once!I said, adopting my very best ward sisters tone.This generally had a good effect on recalcitrant orderlies and young interns, but appeared merely to amuse Captain Randall.I was resolutely repressing the feelings of fear and disorientation that were flapping under my ribs like a panicked flock of hens.He shook his head slowly, examining me once more in detail.Not just at present, Chuckie.Im asking myself, he said, conversationally, just why a whore abroad in her shift would be wearing her shoes?And quite fine ones, at that, he added, glancing at my plain brown loafers.A what!I exclaimed.He ignored me completely.His gaze had returned to my face, and he suddenly stepped forward and gripped my chin in his hand.I grabbed his wrist and yanked.Let go of me!He had fingers like steel.Disregarding my efforts to free myself, he turned my face from one side to the other, so the fading afternoon light shone on it.The skin of a lady, Ill swear, he murmured to himself.He leaned forward and sniffed.And a French scent in your hair.He let go then, and I rubbed my jaw indignantly, as though to erase the touch I still felt on my skin.The rest might be managed with money from your patron, he mused, but youve the speech of a lady too.Thanks so much!I snapped.Get out of my way.My husband is expecting me; if Im not back in ten minutes, hell come looking for me.Oh, your husband?The derisively admiring expression retreated somewhat, but did not disappear completely.And what is your husbands name, pray?Where is he?And why does he allow his wife to wander alone through deserted woods in a state of undress?I had been throttling that part of my brain that was beating itself to pieces trying to make sense of the whole afternoon.It now managed to break through long enough to tell me that however absurd I thought its conjectures, giving this man Franks name, the same as his own, was only likely to lead to further trouble.Disdaining therefore to answer him, I made to push past him.He blocked my passage with a muscular arm, and reached for me with his other hand.There was a sudden whoosh from above, followed immediately by a blur before my eyes and a dull thud.Captain Randall was on the ground at my feet, under a heaving mass that looked like a bundle of old plaid rags.A brown, rocklike fist rose out of the mass and descended with considerable force, meeting decisively with some bony protuberance, by the sound of the resultant crack.The Captains struggling legs, shiny in tall brown boots, relaxed quite suddenly.I found myself staring into a pair of sharp black eyes.The sinewy hand that had temporarily distracted the Captains unwelcome attentions was attached like a limpet to my forearm.And who the hell are you?I said in astonishment.My rescuer, if I cared to call him that, was some inches shorter than I and sparely built, but the bare arms protruding from the ragged shirt were knotted with muscle and his whole frame gave the impression of being made of some resilient material such as bedsprings.No beauty, either, with a pockmarked skin, low brow, and narrow jaw.This way.He jerked on my arm, and I, stupefied by the rush of recent events, obediently followed.My new companion pushed his way rapidly through a scrim of alder, made an abrupt turn around a large rock, and suddenly we were on a path.Overgrown with gorse and heather, and zigzagging so that it was never visible for more than six feet ahead, it was still unmistakably a path, leading steeply up toward the crest of a hill.Not until we were picking our way cautiously down the far side of the hill did I gather breath and wit enough to ask where we were going.Receiving no answer from my companion, I repeated Where on earth are we going?in a louder tone.To my considerable surprise, he rounded on me, face contorted, and pushed me off the path.As I opened my mouth to protest, he clapped a hand over it and dragged me to the ground, rolling on top of me.Not again!I thought, and was heaving desperately to and fro to free myself when I heard what he had heard, and suddenly lay still.Voices called back and forth, accompanied by trampling and splashing sounds.They were unmistakably English voices.I struggled violently to get my mouth free.I sank my teeth into his hand, and had time only to register the fact that he had been eating pickled herring with his fingers, before something crashed against the back of my skull, and everything went dark.* * *    The stone cottage loomed up suddenly through a haze of night mist.The shutters were bolted tight, showing no more than a thread of light.Having no idea how long I had been unconscious, I couldnt tell how far this place was from the hill of Craigh na Dun or the town of Inverness.We were on horseback, myself mounted before my captor, with hands tied to the pommel, but there was no road, so progress was still rather slow.I thought I had not been out for long; I showed no symptoms of concussion or other ill effects from the blow, save a sore patch on the base of my skull.My captor, a man of few words, had responded to my questions, demands and acerbic remarks alike with the all purpose Scottish noise which can best be rendered phonetically as Mmmmphm.Had I been in any doubt as to his nationality, that sound alone would have been sufficient to remove it.My eyes had gradually adapted to the dwindling light outside as the horse stumbled through the stones and gorse, so it was a shock to step from near dark into what seemed a blaze of light inside.As the dazzle receded, I could see that in fact the single room was lit only by a fire, several candlesticks, and a dangerously old fashioned looking oil lamp.What is it ye have there, Murtagh?The weasel faced man grabbed me by the arm and urged me blinking into the firelight.A Sassenach wench, Dougal, by her speech.There were several men in the room, all apparently staring at me, some in curiosity, some with unmistakable leers.My dress had been torn in various spots during the afternoons activities, and I hastily took stock of the damage.Looking down, I could see the curve of one breast clearly through a rip, and I was sure the assembled men could too.I decided that making an attempt to pull the torn edges together would only draw further attention to the prospect; instead I chose a face at random and stared boldly at him, in hopes of distracting either the man or myself.Eh, a bonny one, Sassenach or no, said the man, a fat, greasy looking sort, seated by the fire.He was holding a chunk of bread and didnt bother to set it down as he rose and came over to me.He pushed my chin up with the back of his hand, shoving the hair out of my face.A few breadcrumbs fell down the neck of my dress.The other men clustered close around, a mass of plaid and whiskers, smelling strongly of sweat and alcohol.It was only then that I saw they were all kiltedodd, even for this part of the Highlands.Had I stumbled into the meeting of a clan society, or perhaps a regimental reunion?Cmere, lass.A large, dark bearded man remained seated at the table by the window as he beckoned me.By his air of command, he seemed to be the leader of this pack.The men parted reluctantly as Murtagh pulled me forward, apparently respecting his rights as captor.The dark man looked me over carefully, no expression on his face.He was good looking, I thought, and not unfriendly.There were lines of strain between his brows, though, and it wasnt a face one would willingly cross.Whats your name, lass?His voice was light for a man of his size, not the deep bass I would have expected from the barrel chest.ClaireClaire Beauchamp, I said, deciding on the spur of the moment to use my maiden name.If it were ransom they had in mind, I didnt want to help them by giving a name that could lead to Frank.And I wasnt sure I wanted these rough looking men to know who I was, before I found out who they were.And just what do you think youre The dark man ignored me, establishing a pattern that I was to grow tired of very quickly.Beauchamp?The heavy brows lifted and the general company stirred in surprise.A French name, it is, surely?He had in fact pronounced the name in correct French, though I had given it the common English pronunciation of Beecham.Yes, thats right, I answered, in some surprise.Where did ye find this lass?Dougal demanded, swinging round on Murtagh, who was refreshing himself from a leather flask.The swarthy little man shrugged.At the foot o Craigh na Dun.She was havin words with a certain captain of dragoons wi whom I chanced to be acquent, he added, with a significant lift of his eyebrows.There seemed to be some question as to whether the lady was or was not a whore.Dougal looked me over carefully once more, taking in every detail of cotton print dress and walking shoes.I see.And what was the ladys position in this discussion?he inquired, with a sarcastic emphasis on the word lady that I didnt particularly care for.I noticed that while his Scots was less pronounced than that of the man called Murtagh, his accent was still broad enough that the word was almost, though not quite, leddy.Murtagh seemed grimly amused; at least one corner of the thin mouth turned up.She said she wasna.The captain himself appeared to be of two minds on the matter, but inclined to put the question to the test.We could do the same, come to that.The fat, black bearded man stepped toward me grinning, hands tugging at his belt.I backed up hastily as far as I could, which was not nearly far enough, given the dimensions of the cottage.That will do, Rupert.Dougal was still scowling at me, but his voice held the ring of authority, and Rupert stopped his advances, making a comical face of disappointment.I dont hold wi rape, and weve not the time for it, anyway.I was pleased to hear this statement of policy, dubious as its moral underpinning might be, but remained a bit nervous in the face of the openly lascivious looks on some of the other faces.I felt absurdly as though I had appeared in public in my undergarments.And while I had no idea who or what these Highland bandits were up to, they seemed bloody dangerous.I bit my tongue, repressing a number of more or less injudicious remarks that were bubbling toward the surface.What dye say, Murtagh?Dougal demanded of my captor.She doesna appear to care for Rupert, at least.Thats no proof, objected a short, balding man.He didna offer her any siller.Ye canna expect any woman to take on something like Rupert without substantial paymentin advance, he added, to the considerable hilarity of his companions.Dougal stilled the racket with an abrupt gesture, though, and jerked his head toward the door.The balding man, still grinning, obediently slid out into the darkness.Murtagh, who had not joined in the laughter, was frowning as he looked me over.He shook his head, making the lank fringe across his forehead sway.Nay, he said definitely.Ive no idea what she might beor whobut Ill stake my best shirt shes no a whore.I hoped in that case that his best was not the one he was wearing, which scarcely looked worth the wagering.Weel, yed know, Murtagh, yeve seen enough o them, gibed Rupert, but was gruffly hushed by Dougal.Well puzzle it out later, said Dougal brusquely.Weve a good distance to go tonight, and we mun do something for Jamie first; he canna ride like that.I shrank back into the shadows near the fireplace, hoping to avoid notice.The man called Murtagh had untied my hands before leading me in here.Perhaps I could slip away while they were busy elsewhere.The mens attention had shifted to a young man crouched on a stool in the corner.He had barely looked up through my appearance and interrogation, but kept his head bent, hand clutching the opposite shoulder, rocking slightly back and forth in pain.Dougal gently pushed the clutching hand away.One of the men pulled back the young mans plaid, revealing a dirt smeared linen shirt blotched with blood.A small man with a thick mustache came up behind the lad with a single bladed knife, and holding the shirt at the collar, slit it across the breast and down the sleeve, so that it fell away from the shoulder.I gasped, as did several of the men.The shoulder had been wounded; there was a deep ragged furrow across the top, and blood was running freely down the young mans breast.But more shocking was the shoulder joint itself.A dreadful hump rose on that side, and the arm hung at an impossible angle.Dougal grunted.Mmph.Out o joint, poor bugger.The young man looked up for the first time.Though drawn with pain and stubbled with red beard, it was a strong, good humored face.Fell wi my hand out, when the musket ball knocked me off my saddle.I landed with all my weight on the hand, and crunch!, there it went.Crunch is right.The mustached man, a Scot, and educated, to judge by his accent, was probing the shoulder, making the lad grimace in pain.The wounds no trouble.The ball went right through, and its cleanthe bloods runnin free enough.The man picked up a wad of grimy cloth from the table and used it to blot the blood.I dont know quite what to do about the disjointure, though.Wed need a chirurgeon to put it back in place properly.You canna ride with it that way, can you, Jamie lad?Musket ball?I thought blankly.Chirurgeon?The young man shook his head, white faced.Hurts bad enough sitting still.I couldna manage a horse.He squeezed his eyes shut and set his teeth hard in his lower lip.Murtagh spoke impatiently.Well, we canna leave him behind noo, can we?The lobsterbacks are no great shakes trackin in the dark, but theyll find this place sooner or later, shutters or no.And Jamie can hardly pass for an innocent cottar, wi yon great hole in im.Dinna worrit yourself, Dougal said shortly.I dont mean to be leaving him behind.The mustached man sighed.No help for it, then.Well have to try and force the joint back.Murtagh, you and Rupert hold him; Ill give it a try.I watched in sympathy as he picked up the young mans arm by wrist and elbow and began forcing it upward.The angle was quite wrong; it must be causing agonizing pain.Sweat poured down the young mans face, but he made no sound beyond a soft groan.Suddenly he slumped forward, kept from falling on the floor only by the grip of the men holding him.One unstoppered a leather flask and pressed it to his lips.The reek of the raw spirit reached me where I stood.The young man coughed and gagged, but swallowed nonetheless, dribbling the amber liquid onto the remains of his shirt.All right for another go, lad?the bald man asked.Or maybe Rupert should have a try, he suggested, turning to the squat, black bearded ruffian.Rupert, so invited, flexed his hands as though about to toss a caber, and picked up the young mans wrist, plainly intending to put the joint back by main force; an operation, it was clear, which was likely to snap the arm like a broomstick.Dont you dare to do that!All thought of escape submerged in professional outrage, I started forward, oblivious to the startled looks of the men around me.What do you mean?snapped the bald man, clearly irritated by my intrusion.I mean that youll break his arm if you do it like that, I snapped back.Stand out of the way, please.I elbowed Rupert back and took hold of the patients wrist myself.The patient looked as surprised as the rest, but didnt resist.His skin was very warm, but not feverish, I judged.You have to get the bone of the upper arm at the proper angle before it will slip back into its joint, I said, grunting as I pulled the wrist up and the elbow in.The young man was sizable; his arm was heavy as lead.This is the worst part, I warned the patient.I cupped the elbow, ready to whip it upward and in.His mouth twitched, not quite a smile.It canna hurt much worse than it does.Get on wi it.Sweat was popping out on my own face by now.Resetting a shoulder joint is hard work at the best of times.Done on a large man who had gone hours since the dislocation, his muscles now swollen and pulling on the joint, the job was taking all the strength I had.The fire was dangerously close; I hoped we wouldnt both topple in, if the joint went back with a jerk.Suddenly the shoulder gave a soft crunching pop!and the joint was back in place.The patient looked amazed.He put an unbelieving hand up to explore.It doesna hurt anymore!A broad grin of delighted relief spread across his face, and the men broke out in exclamations and applause.It will.I was sweating from the exertion, but smugly pleased with the results.It will be tender for several days.You mustnt extend the joint at all for two or three days; when you do use it again, go very slowly at first.Stop at once if it begins to hurt, and use warm compresses on it daily.I became aware, in the midst of this advice, that while the patient was listening respectfully, the other men were eyeing me with looks ranging from wonder to outright suspicion.Im a nurse, you see, I explained, feeling somehow defensive.Dougals eyes, and Ruperts as well, dropped to my bosom and fastened there with a sort of horrified fascination.They exchanged glances, then Dougal looked back at my face.Be that as it may, he said, raising his brows at me.For a wetnurse, youd seem to have some skill at healing.Can ye stanch the lads wound, well enough for him to sit a horse?I can dress the wound, yes, I said with considerable asperity.Provided youve anything to dress it with.But just what do you mean wetnurse?And why do you suppose Id want to help you, anyway?I was ignored as Dougal turned and spoke in a tongue I dimly recognized as Gaelic to a woman who cowered in the corner.Surrounded by the mass of men, I had not noticed her before.She was dressed oddly, I thought, in a long, ragged skirt and a long sleeved blouse half covered by a sort of bodice or jerkin.Everything was rather on the grubby side, including her face.Glancing around, though, I could see that the cottage lacked not only electrification but also indoor plumbing; perhaps there was some excuse for the dirt.The woman bobbed a quick curtsy, and scuttling past Rupert and Murtagh, she began digging in a painted wooden chest by the hearth, emerging finally with a pile of ratty cloths.No, that wont do, I said, fingering them gingerly.The wound needs to be disinfected first, then bandaged with a clean cloth, if there are no sterile bandages.Eyebrows rose all around.Disinfected?said the small man, carefully.Yes, indeed, I said firmly, thinking him a bit simpleminded, in spite of his educated accent.All dirt must be removed from the wound and it must be treated with a compound to discourage germs and promote healing.Such as?Such as iodine, I said.Seeing no comprehension on the faces before me, I tried again.Merthiolate?Dilute carbolic?I suggested.Or perhaps even just alcohol?Looks of relief.At last I had found a word they appeared to recognize.Murtagh thrust the leather flask into my hands.I sighed with impatience.I knew the Highlands were primitive, but this was nearly unbelievable.Look, I said, as patiently as I could.Why dont you just take him down into the town?It cant be far, and Im sure theres a doctor there who could see to him.The woman gawped at me.What town?The big man called Dougal was ignoring this discussion, peering cautiously into the darkness around the curtains edge.He let it fall back into place and stepped quietly to the door.The men fell quiet as he vanished into the night.In a moment he was back, bringing the bald man and the cold sharp scent of dark pines with him.He shook his head in answer to the mens questioning looks.Nay, nothing close.Well go at once, while its safe.Catching sight of me, he stopped for a moment, thinking.Suddenly he nodded at me, decision made.Shell come with us, he said.He rummaged in the pile of cloths on the table and came up with a tattered rag; it looked like a neckcloth that had seen better days.The mustached man seemed disinclined to have me along, wherever they were going.Why do ye no just leave her here?Dougal cast him an impatient glance, but left it to Murtagh to explain.Wherever the redcoats are now, theyll be here by dawn, which is no so far off, considering.If this womans an English spy, we canna risk leaving her here to tell them which way weve gone.And if she should not be on good terms wi themhe looked dubiously at mewe certainly canna leave a lone woman here in her shift.He brightened a bit, fingering the fabric of my skirt.She might be worth a bit in the way of ransom, at that; little as she has on, its fine stuff.Besides, Dougal added, interrupting, she may be useful on the way; she seems to know a bit about doctoring.But weve no time for that now.Im afraid yell have to go without bein disinfected, Jamie, he said, clapping the younger man on the back.Can ye ride one handed?Aye.Good lad.Here, he said, tossing the greasy rag at me.Bind up his wound, quickly.Well be leaving directly.Do you two get the horses, he said, turning to weasel face and the fat one called Rupert.I turned the rag around distastefully.I cant use this, I complained.Its filthy.Without seeing him move, I found the big man gripping my shoulder, his dark eyes an inch from mine.Do it, he said.Freeing me with a push, he strode to the door and disappeared after his two henchmen.Feeling more than a little shaken, I turned to the task of bandaging the bullet wound as best I could.The thought of using the grimy neckrag was something my medical training wouldnt let me contemplate.I tried to bury my confusion and terror in the task of trying to find something more suitable, and, after a quick and futile search through the pile of rags, finally settled on strips of rayon torn from the hem of my slip.While hardly sterile, it was by far the cleanest material at hand.The linen of my patients shirt was old and worn, but still surprisingly tough.With a bit of a struggle, I ripped the rest of the sleeve open and used it to improvise a sling.I stepped back to survey the results of my impromptu field dressing, and backed straight into the big man, who had come in quietly to watch.He looked approvingly at my handiwork.Good job, lass.Come on, were ready.Dougal handed a coin to the woman and hustled me out of the cottage, followed more slowly by Jamie, still a bit white faced.Unfolded from the low stool, my patient proved to be quite tall; he stood several inches over Dougal, himself a tall man.The black bearded Rupert and Murtagh were holding six horses outside, muttering soft Gaelic endearments to them in the dark.It was a moonless night, but the starlight caught the metal bits of the harness in flashes of quicksilver.I looked up and almost gasped in wonder; the night sky was thick with a glory of stars such as I had never seen.Glancing round at the surrounding forest, I understood.With no nearby city to veil the sky with light, the stars here held undisputed dominion over the night.And then I stopped dead, feeling much colder than the night chill justified.No city lights.What town?the woman inside had asked.Accustomed as I was to blackouts and air raids from the war years, the lack of light had not at first disturbed me.But this was peacetime, and the lights of Inverness should have been visible for miles.The men were shapeless masses in the dark.I thought of trying to slip away into the trees, but Dougal, apparently divining my thought, grabbed my elbow and pulled me toward the horses.Jamie, get yourself up, he called.The lass will ride wi you.He squeezed my elbow.You can hold the reins, if Jamie canna manage one handed, but do ye take care to keep close wi the rest of us.Should ye try anythin else, I shall cut your throat.Dye understand me?I nodded, throat too dry to answer.His voice was not particularly threatening, but I believed every word.I was the less tempted to try anythin, in that I had no idea what to try.I didnt know where I was, who my companions were, why we were leaving with such urgency, or where we were going, but I lacked any reasonable alternatives to going with them.I was worried about Frank, who must long since have started looking for me, but this didnt seem the time to mention him.Dougal must have sensed my nod, for he let go of my arm and stooped suddenly beside me.I stood stupidly staring down at him until he hissed, Your foot, lass!Give me your foot!Your left foot, he added disgustedly.I hastily took my misplaced right foot out of his hand and stepped up with my left.With a slight grunt, he boosted me into the saddle in front of Jamie, who gathered me in closely with his good arm.In spite of the general awkwardness of my situation, I was grateful for the young Scots warmth.He smelt strongly of woodsmoke, blood, and unwashed male, but the night chill bit through my thin dress and I was happy enough to lean back against him.With no more than a faint chinking of bridles, we moved off into the starlit night.There was no conversation among the men, only a general wary watchfulness.The horses broke into a trot as soon as we reached the road, and I was jostled too uncomfortably to want to talk myself, even assuming that anyone was willing to listen.My companion seemed to be having little trouble, in spite of being unable to use his right hand.I could feel his thighs behind mine, shifting and pressing occasionally to guide the horse.I clutched the edge of the short saddle in order to stay seated; I had been on horses before, but was by no means the horseman this Jamie was.After a time, we reached a crossroads, where we stopped a moment while the bald man and the leader conferred in low tones.Jamie dropped the reins over the horses neck and let it wander to the verge to crop grass, while he began twisting and turning behind me.Careful!I said.Dont twist like that, or your dressing will come off!What are you trying to do?Get my plaid loose to cover you, he replied.Youre shivering.But I canna do it one handed.Can ye reach the clasp of my brooch for me?With a good deal of tugging and awkward shifting, we got the plaid loosened.With a surprisingly dexterous swirl, he twirled the cloth out and let it settle, shawllike, around his shoulders.He then put the ends over my shoulders and tucked them neatly under the saddle edge, so that we were both warmly wrapped.There!he said.We dinna want ye to freeze before we get there.Thank you, I said, grateful for the shelter.But where are we going?I couldnt see his face, behind and above me, but he paused a moment before answering.At last he laughed shortly.Tell ye the truth, lassie, I dont know.Reckon well both find out when we get there, eh?* * *    Something seemed faintly familiar about the section of countryside through which we were passing.Surely I knew that large rock formation ahead, the one shaped like a roosters tail?Cocknammon Rock!I exclaimed.Aye, reckon, said my escort, unexcited by this revelation.Didnt the English use it for ambushes?I asked, trying to remember the dreary details of local history Frank had spent hours regaling me with over the last week.If there is an English patrol in the neighborhood I hesitated.If there was an English patrol in the neighborhood, perhaps I was wrong to draw attention to it.And yet, in case of an ambush, I would be quite indistinguishable from my companion, shrouded as we were in one plaid.And I thought again of Captain Jonathan Randall, and shuddered involuntarily.Everything I had seen since I had stepped through the cleft stone pointed toward the completely irrational conclusion that the man I had met in the wood was in fact Franks six times great grandfather.I fought stubbornly against this conclusion, but was unable to formulate another that met the facts.I had at first imagined that I was merely dreaming more vividly than usual, but Randalls kiss, rudely familiar and immediately physical, had dispelled that impression.Neither did I imagine that I had dreamed being knocked on the head by Murtagh; the soreness on my scalp was being matched by a chafing of my inner thighs against the saddle, which seemed most undreamlike.And the blood; yes, I was familiar enough with blood to have dreamed of it before.But never had I dreamed the scent of blood; that warm, coppery tang that I could still smell on the man behind me.Tck.He clucked to our horse and urged it up alongside the leaders, engaging the burly shadow in quiet Gaelic conversation.The horses slowed to a walk.At a signal from the leader, Jamie, Murtagh, and the small bald man dropped back, while the other two spurred up and galloped toward the rock, a quartermile ahead to the right.A half moon had come up, and the light was bright enough to pick out the leaves of the mallow plants growing on the roadside, but the shadows in the clefts of the rock could hide anything.Just as the galloping shapes passed the rock, a flash of musket fire sparked from a hollow.There was a bloodcurdling shriek from directly behind me, and the horse leaped forward as though jabbed with a sharp stick.We were suddenly racing toward the rock across the heather, Murtagh and the other man alongside, hair raising screams and bellows splitting the night air.I hung onto the pommel for dear life.Suddenly reining up next to a large gorse bush, Jamie grabbed me round the waist and unceremoniously dumped me into it.The horse whirled sharply and sprinted off again, circling the rock to come along the south side.I could see the rider crouching low in the saddle as the horse vanished into the rocks shadow.When it emerged, still galloping, the saddle was empty.The rock surfaces were cratered with shadow; I could hear shouts and occasional musket shots, but couldnt tell if the movements I saw were those of men, or only the shades of the stunted oaks that sprouted from cracks in the rock.I extricated myself from the bush with some difficulty, picking bits of prickly gorse from my skirt and hair.I licked a scratch on my hand, wondering what on earth I was to do now.I could wait for the battle at the rock to be decided.If the Scots won, or at least survived, I supposed they would come back looking for me.If they did not, I could approach the English, who might well assume that if I were traveling with the Scots I was in league with them.In league to do what, I had no idea, but it was quite plain from the mens behavior at the cottage that they were up to something which they expected the English strongly to disapprove of.Perhaps it would be better to avoid both sides in this conflict.After all, now that I knew where I was, I stood some chance of getting back to a town or village that I knew, even if I had to walk all the way.I set off with decision toward the road, tripping over innumerable lumps of granite, the bastard offspring of Cocknammon Rock.The moonlight made walking deceptive; though I could see every detail of the ground, I had no depth perception; flat plants and jagged stones looked the same height, causing me to lift my feet absurdly high over nonexistent obstacles and stub my toes on protruding rocks.I walked as fast as I could, listening for sounds of pursuit behind me.The noises of battle had faded by the time I reached the road.I realized that I was too visible on the road itself, but I needed to follow it, if I were to find my way to a town.I had no sense of direction in the dark, and had never learned from Frank his trick of navigation by the stars.Thinking of Frank made me want to cry, so I tried to distract myself by trying to make sense of the afternoons events.It seemed inconceivable, but all appearances pointed to my being someplace where the customs and politics of the late eighteenth century still held sway.I would have thought the whole thing a fancy dress show of some type, had it not been for the injuries of the young man they called Jamie.That wound had indeed been made by something very like a musket ball, judging from the evidence it left behind.The behavior of the men in the cottage was not consistent with any sort of play acting, either.They were serious men, and the dirks and swords were real.Could it be some secluded enclave, perhaps, where the villagers reenacted part of their history periodically?I had heard of such things in Germany, though never in Scotland.Youve never heard of the actors shooting each other with muskets, either, have you?jeered the uncomfortably rational part of my mind.I looked back at the rock to check my position, then ahead to the skyline, and my blood ran cold.There was nothing there but the feathered needles of pine trees, impenetrably black against the spread of stars.Where were the lights of Inverness?If that was Cocknammon Rock behind me, as I knew it was, then Inverness must be less than three miles to the southwest.At this distance, I should be able to see the glow of the town against the sky.If it was there.I shook myself irritably, hugging my elbows against the chill.Even admitting for a moment the completely implausible idea that I was in another time than my own, Inverness had stood in its present location for some six hundred years.It was there.But, apparently, it had no lights.Under the circumstances, this strongly suggested that there were no electric lights to be had.Yet another piece of evidence, if I needed it.But evidence of what, exactly?A shape stepped out of the dark so close in front of me that I nearly bumped into it.Stifling a scream, I turned to run, but a large hand gripped my arm, preventing escape.Dinna worry, lass.Tis me.Thats what I was afraid of, I said crossly, though in fact I was relieved that it was Jamie.I was not so afraid of him as of the other men, though he looked just as dangerous.Still, he was young, even younger than I, I judged.And it was difficult for me to be afraid of someone I had so recently treated as a patient.I hope you havent been misusing that shoulder, I said in the rebuking voice of a hospital Matron.If I could establish a sufficient tone of authority, perhaps I could persuade him into letting me go.Yon wee stramash didna do it any good, he admitted, massaging the shoulder with his free hand.Just then, he moved into a patch of moonlight, and I saw the huge spread of blood on his shirt front.Arterial bleeding, I thought at once; but then, why is he still standing?Youre hurt!I exclaimed.Have you broken open your shoulder wound, or is it fresh?Sit down and let me see!I pushed him toward a pile of boulders, rapidly reviewing procedures for emergency field treatment.No supplies to hand, save what I was wearing.I was reaching for the remains of my slip, intending to use it to stanch the flow, when he laughed.Nay, pay it no mind, lass.This lot isna my blood.Not much of it, anyway, he added, plucking the soaked fabric gingerly away from his body.I swallowed, feeling a bit queasy.Oh, I said weakly.Dougal and the others will be waiting by the road.Lets go.He took me by the arm, less as a gallant gesture than a means of forcing me to accompany him.I decided to take a chance and dug in my heels.No!Im not going with you!He stopped, surprised at my resistance.Yes, you are.He didnt seem upset by my refusal; in fact, he seemed slightly amused that I had any objection to being kidnapped again.And what if I wont?Are you going to cut my throat?I demanded, forcing the issue.He considered the alternatives and answered calmly.Why, no.You dont look heavy.If ye wont walk, I shall pick you up and sling ye over my shoulder.Do ye want me to do that?He took a step toward me, and I hastily retreated.I hadnt the slightest doubt he would do it, injury or no.No!You cant do that; youll damage your shoulder again.His features were indistinct, but the moonlight caught the gleam of teeth as he grinned.Well then, since ye dont want me to hurt myself, I suppose that means as youre comin with me?I struggled for an answer, but failed to find one in time.He took my arm again, firmly, and we set off toward the road.Jamie kept a tight hold on my arm, hauling me upright when I stumbled over rocks and plants.He himself walked as though the stubbled heath were a paved road in broad daylight.He has cat blood, I reflected sourly, no doubt that was how he managed to sneak up on me in the darkness.The other men were, as advertised, waiting with the horses at no great distance; apparently there had been no losses or injuries, for they were all present.Scrambling up in an undignified scuffle, I plopped down in the saddle again.My head gave Jamies bad shoulder an unintentional thump, and he drew in his breath with a hiss.I tried to cover my resentment at being recaptured and my remorse at having hurt him with an air of bullying officiousness.Serves you right, brawling round the countryside and chasing through bushes and rocks.I told you not to move that joint; now youve probably got torn muscles as well as bruises.He seemed amused by my scolding.Well, it wasna much of a choice.If Id not moved my shoulder, I wouldna have ever moved anything else again.I can handle a single redcoat wi one handmaybe even two of them, he said, a bit boastfully, but not three.Besides, he said, drawing me against his blood encrusted shirt, ye can fix it for me again when we get where were going.Thats what you think, I said coldly, squirming away from the sticky fabric.He clucked to the horse, and we set off again.The men were in ferocious good spirits after the fight, and there was a good deal of laughter and joking.My minor part in thwarting the ambush was much praised, and toasts were drunk in my honor from the flasks that several of the men carried.I was offered some of the contents, but declined at first on grounds that I found it hard enough to stay in the saddle sober.From the mens discussion, I gathered it had been a small patrol of some ten English soldiers, armed with muskets and sabers.Someone passed a flask to Jamie, and I could smell the hot, burnt smelling liquor as he drank.I wasnt at all thirsty, but the faint scent of honey reminded me that I was starving, and had been for some time.My stomach gave an embarrassingly loud growl, protesting my neglect.Hey, then, Jamie lad!Hungry, are ye?Or have ye a set of bagpipes with ye?shouted Rupert, mistaking the source of the noise.Hungry enough to eat a set of pipes, I reckon, called Jamie, gallantly assuming the blame.A moment later, a hand with a flask came around in front of me again.Better have a wee nip, he whispered to me.It willna fill your belly, but it will make ye forget youre hungry.And a number of other things as well, I hoped.I tilted the flask and swallowed.* * *    My escort had been correct; the whisky built a small warm fire that burned comfortably in my stomach, obscuring the hunger pangs.We managed without incident for several miles, taking turns with both reins and whisky flask.Near a ruined cottage, though, the breathing of my escort gradually changed to a ragged gasping.Our precarious balance, heretofore contained in a staid wobble, suddenly became much more erratic.I was confused; if I wasnt drunk, it seemed rather unlikely that he was.Stop!Help!I yelled.Hes going over!I remembered my last unrehearsed descent and had no inclination to repeat it.Dark shapes swirled and crowded around us, with a confused muttering of voices.Jamie slid off headfirst like a sack of stones, luckily landing in someones arms.The rest of the men were off their horses and had him laid in a field by the time I had scrambled down.Hes breathin, said one.Well, how very helpful, I snapped, groping frantically for a pulse in the blackness.I found one at last, rapid but fairly strong.Putting a hand on his chest and an ear to his mouth, I could feel a regular rise and fall, with less of that gasping note.I straightened up.I think hes just fainted, I said.Put a saddle bag under his feet and if theres water, bring me some.I was surprised to find that my orders were instantly obeyed.Apparently the young man was important to them.He groaned and opened his eyes, black holes in the starlight.In the faint, light his face looked like a skull, white skin stretched tight over the angled bones around the orbits.Im all right, he said, trying to sit up.Just a bit dizzy is all.I put a hand on his chest and pushed him flat.Lie still, I ordered.I carried out a rapid inspection by touch, then rose on my knees and turned to a looming shape that I deduced from its size to be the leader, Dougal.The gunshot wound has been bleeding again, and the idiots been knifed as well.I think its not serious, but hes lost quite a lot of blood.His shirt is soaked through, but I dont know how much of it is his.He needs rest and quiet; we should camp here at least until morning.The shape made a negative motion.Nay.Were farther than the garrison will venture, but theres still the Watch to be mindful of.Weve a good fifteen miles yet to go.The featureless head tilted back, gauging the movement of the stars.Five hours, at the least, and more likely seven.We can stay long enough for ye to stop the bleeding and dress the wound again; no much more than that.I set to work, muttering to myself, while Dougal, with a soft word, dispatched one of the other shadows to stand guard with the horses by the road.The other men relaxed for the moment, drinking from flasks and chatting in low voices.The ferret faced Murtagh helped me, tearing strips of linen, fetching more water, and lifting the patient up to have the dressing tied on, Jamie being strictly forbidden to move himself, despite his grumbling that he was perfectly all right.You are not all right, and its no wonder, I snapped, venting my fear and irritation.What sort of idiot gets himself knifed and doesnt even stop to take care of it?Couldnt you tell how badly you were bleeding?Youre lucky youre not dead, tearing around the countryside all night, brawling and fighting and throwing yourself off horseshold still, you bloody fool.The rayon and linen strips I was working with were irritatingly elusive in the dark.They slipped away, eluding my grasp, like fish darting away into the depths with a mocking flash of white bellies.Despite the chill, sweat sprang out on my neck.I finally finished tying one end and reached for another, which persisted in slithering away behind the patients back.Come back here, youoh, you goddamned bloody bastard!Jamie had moved and the original end had come untied.There was a moment of shocked silence.Christ, said the fat man named Rupert.Ive neer heard a woman use such language in me life.Then yeve neer met my auntie Grisel, said another voice, to laughter.Your husband should tan ye, woman, said an austere voice from the blackness under a tree.St.Paul says Let a woman be silent, and   You can mind your own bloody business, I snarled, sweat dripping behind my ears, and so can St.Paul.I wiped my forehead with my sleeve.Turn him to the left.And if you, addressing my patient, move so much as one single muscle while Im tying this bandage, Ill throttle you.Och, aye, he answered meekly.I pulled too hard on the last bandage, and the entire dressing scooted off.Goddamn it all to hell!I bellowed, striking my hand on the ground in frustration.There was a moment of shocked silence, then, as I fumbled in the dark for the loose ends of the bandages, further comment on my unwomanly language.Perhaps we should send her to Ste.Anne, Dougal, offered one of the blank faced figures squatting by the road.Ive not heard Jamie swear once since we left the coast, and he used to have a mouth on him would put a sailor to shame.Four months in a monastery must have had some effect.You do not even take the name of the Lord in vain anymore, do ye, lad?You wouldna do so either, if youd been made to do penance for it by lying for three hours at midnight on the stone floor of a chapel in February, wearing nothin but your shirt, answered my patient.The men all laughed, as he continued.The penance was only for two hours, but it took another to get myself up off the floor afterward; I thought myer, I thought Id frozen to the flags, but it turned out just to be stiffness.Apparently he was feeling better.I smiled, despite myself, but spoke firmly nonetheless.You be quiet, I said, or Ill hurt you.He gingerly touched the dressing, and I slapped his hand away.Oh, threats, is it?he asked impudently.And after I shared my drink with ye too!The flask completed the circle of men.Kneeling down next to me, Dougal tilted it carefully for the patient to drink.The pungent, burnt smell of very raw whisky floated up, and I put a restraining hand on the flask.No more spirits, I said.He needs tea, or at worst, water.Not alcohol.Dougal pulled the flask from my hand, completely disregarding me, and poured a sizable slug of the hot smelling liquid down the throat of my patient, making him cough.Waiting only long enough for the man on the ground to catch his breath, he reapplied the flask.Stop that!I reached for the whisky again.Do you want him so drunk he cant stand up?I was rudely elbowed aside.Feisty wee bitch, is she no?said my patient, sounding amused.Tend to your business, woman, Dougal ordered.Weve a good way to go yet tonight, and hell need whatever strength the drink can give him.The instant the bandages were tied, the patient tried to sit up.I pushed him flat and put a knee on his chest to keep him there.You are not to move, I said fiercely.I grabbed the hem of Dougals kilt and jerked it roughly, urging him back down on his knees next to me.Look at that, I ordered, in my best ward sister voice.I plopped the sopping mass of the discarded shirt into his hand.He dropped it with an exclamation of disgust.I took his hand and put it on the patients shoulder.And look there.Hes had a blade of some kind right through the trapezius muscle.A bayonet, put in the patient helpfully.A bayonet!I exclaimed.And why didnt you tell me?He shrugged, and stopped short with a mild grunt of pain.I felt it go in, but I couldna tell how bad it was; it didna hurt that much.Is it hurting now?It is, he said, shortly.Good, I said, completely provoked.You deserve it.Maybe that will teach you to go haring round the countryside kidnapping young women and k killing people, and.I felt myself ridiculously close to tears and stopped, fighting for control.Dougal was growing impatient with this conversation.Well, can ye keep one foot on each side of the horse, man?He cant go anywhere!I protested indignantly.He ought to be in hospital!Certainly he cant  My protests, as usual, went completely ignored.Can ye ride?Dougal repeated.Aye, if yell take the lassie off my chest and fetch me a clean shirt.4    I COME TO THE CASTLE    The rest of the journey passed uneventfully, if you consider it uneventful to ride fifteen miles on horseback through rough country at night, frequently without benefit of roads, in company with kilted men armed to the teeth, and sharing a horse with a wounded man.At least we were not set upon by highwaymen, we encountered no wild beasts, and it didnt rain.By the standards I was becoming used to, it was quite dull.Dawn was coming up in streaks and slashes over the foggy moor.Our destination loomed ahead, a huge bulk of dark stone outlined by the grey light.The surroundings were no longer quiet and deserted.There was a trickle of rudely dressed people, heading toward the castle.They moved to the side of the narrow road to let the horses trot past, gawking at what they plainly thought my outlandish garb.Not surprisingly, it was misting heavily, but there was enough light to show a stone bridge, arching over a small stream that ran past the front of the castle, down to a dully gleaming loch a quarter mile away.The castle itself was blunt and solid.No fanciful turrets or toothed battlements.This was more like an enormous fortified house, with thick stone walls and high, slitted windows.A number of chimney pots smoked over the slick tiles of the roof, adding to the general impression of greyness.The gated entrance of the castle was wide enough to accommodate two wagons side by side.I say this without fear of contradiction, because it was doing exactly that as we crossed the bridge.One ox drawn wagon was loaded with barrels, the other with hay.Our little cavalcade huddled on the bridge, waiting impatiently for the wagons to complete their laborious entry.I risked a question as the horses picked their way over the slippery stones of the wet courtyard.I hadnt spoken to my escort since hastily re dressing his shoulder by the roadside.He had been silent, too, aside from an occasional grunt of discomfort when a misstep by the horse jolted him.Where are we?I croaked, my voice hoarse from cold and disuse.The keep of Leoch, he answered shortly.Castle Leoch.Well, at least now I knew where I was.When I had known it, Castle Leoch was a picturesque ruin, some thirty miles north of Bargrennan.It was considerably more picturesque now, what with the pigs rooting under the walls of the keep and the pervasive smell of raw sewage.I was beginning to accept the impossible idea that I was, most likely, somewhere in the eighteenth century.I was sure that such filth and chaos existed nowhere in the Scotland of 1945, bomb craters or no.And we were definitely in Scotland; the accents of the people in the courtyard left no doubt of that.Ay, Dougal!shouted a tattered hostler, running up to grab the halter of the lead horse.Youre early, man; we hadna thought to see ye before the Gathering!The leader of our little group swung down from the saddle, leaving the reins to the grubby youth.Aye, well, weve had some luck, both good and bad.Im off to see my brother.Will ye summon Mrs.Fitz to feed the lads?Theyll need their breakfasts and their beds.He beckoned Murtagh and Rupert down to accompany him, and together they disappeared under a pointed archway.The rest of us dismounted and stood steaming in the wet courtyard for another ten minutes before Mrs.Fitz, whoever she might be, consented to show herself.A cluster of curious children gathered around us, speculating on my possible origins and function.The bolder ones had just begun to get up enough courage to pluck at my skirt when a large, stout lady in dark brown linen and homespun bustled out and shooed them away.Willy, my dear!she cried.How good to see ye!And Neddie!She gave the small balding man a hearty buss of welcome that nearly knocked him over.Yell be needin breakfast, I reckon.Plenty in the kitchen; do ye go and feed yerselves.Turning to me and Jamie, she started back as though bitten by a snake.She looked openmouthed at me, then turned to Jamie for an explanation of this apparition.Claire, he said, with a brief tilt of his head toward me.And Mistress FitzGibbons, he added, with a tilt the other way.Murtagh found her yesterday, and Dougal said we must bring her along wi us, he added, making it clear it was no good blaming him.Mistress FitzGibbons closed her mouth and looked me up and down with an air of shrewd evaluation.Apparently she decided that I looked harmless enough, despite my odd and scandalous appearance, for she smiledkindly, despite several missing teethand took me by the arm.Well then, Claire.Welcome to ye.Come wi me and we shall find ye somethin a bit moremmm.She looked over my short skirt and inadequate shoes, shaking her head.She was leading me firmly away when I remembered my patient.Oh, wait, please!I forgot Jamie!Mistress FitzGibbons was surprised.Why, Jamie can fend for himself.He knows where to get food and someone will find him a bed.But hes hurt.He was shot yesterday and stabbed last night.I bandaged the wound for riding, but I didnt have time to clean or dress it properly.I must care for it now, before it gets infected.Infected?Yes, that is, I mean, inflamed, you know, with pus and swelling and fever.Oh, aye, I know what ye mean.But do ye mean to say as ye know what to do for that?Are ye a charmer then?A Beaton?Something like that.I had no notion what a Beaton might be, nor any wish to go into my medical qualifications, standing out in the chilly drizzle that had set in.Mistress FitzGibbons seemed of a like mind, for she called back Jamie, who was making off in the opposite direction, and taking him also by an arm, towed us both into the castle.After a long trip through cold narrow corridors, dimly lit by slitted windows, we came to a fairly large room furnished with a bed, a couple of stools, and most importantly, a fire.I ignored my patient temporarily in favor of thawing my hands.Mistress FitzGibbons, presumably immune to cold, sat Jamie on a stool by the fire and gently got the remains of his tattered shirt off, replacing it with a warm quilt from the bed.She clucked at the shoulder, which was bruised and swollen, and poked at my clumsy dressing.I turned from the fire.I think it will need to be soaked off, and then the wound cleansed with a solution forfor preventing fevers.Mistress FitzGibbons would have made an admirable nurse.What will ye be needin?she asked simply.I thought hard.What in the name of God had people used for preventing infection before the advent of antibiotics?And of those limited compounds, which might be available to me in a primitive Scottish castle just after dawn?Garlic!I said in triumph.Garlic, and if you have it, witch hazel.Also Ill need several clean rags and a kettle of water for boiling.Aye, well, I think we can manage that; perhaps a bit of comfrey as well.What about a bit o boneset tea, or chamomile?Tlad looks as though its been a long night.The young man was in fact swaying with weariness, too tired to protest our discussing him as though he were an inanimate object.Mrs.FitzGibbons was soon back, with an apron full of garlic bulbs, gauze bags of dried herbs, and torn strips of old linen.A small black iron kettle hung from one meaty arm, and she held a large demijohn of water as though it were so much goosedown.Now then, m dear, what would ye have me do?she said cheerfully.I set her to boiling water and peeling the cloves of garlic while I inspected the contents of the herb packets.There was the witch hazel I had asked for, boneset and comfrey for tea, and something I tentatively identified as cherry bark.Painkiller, I muttered happily, recollecting Mr.Crook explaining the uses of the barks and herbs we found.Good, wed need that.I threw several cloves of peeled garlic into the boiling water with some of the witch hazel, then added the cloth strips to the mixture.The boneset, comfrey, and cherry bark were steeping in a small pan of hot water set by the fire.The preparations had steadied me a bit.If I didnt know for certain where I was, or why I was there, at least I knew what to do for the next quarter of an hour.Thank youah, Mrs.FitzGibbons, I said respectfully.I can manage now, if you have things to do.The giant dame laughed, breasts heaving.Ah, lass!There aye be things for me to do!Ill send a bit o broth up for ye.Do ye call oot if ye need anything else.She waddled to the door with surprising speed and disappeared on her rounds.* * *    I pulled the bandages off as carefully as I could.Still, the rayon pad stuck to the flesh, coming away with a soft crackling of dried blood.Droplets of fresh blood oozed around the edges of the wound, and I apologized for hurting him, though he hadnt moved or made a sound.He smiled slightly, with a hint perhaps of flirtation.No worry, lass.Ive been hurt much worse, and by people much less pretty.He bent forward for me to wash the wound with the boiled garlic decoction, and the quilt slipped from his shoulder.I saw at once that, whether meant as a compliment or not, his remark was a statement of plain fact; he had been hurt much worse.His upper back was covered with a criss cross of faded white lines.He had been savagely flogged, and more than once.There were small lines of silvery scar tissue in some spots, where the welts had crossed, and irregular patches where several blows had struck the same spot, flaying off skin and gouging the muscle beneath.I had, of course, seen a great variety of wounds and injuries, doing combat nursing, but there was something about these scars that seemed shockingly brutal.I must have drawn in my breath at the sight, for he turned his head and caught me staring.He shrugged his good shoulder.Lobsterbacks.Flogged me twice, in the space of a week.Theyd ha done it twice the same day, I expect, were they not afraid of killing me.No joy in flogging a dead man.I tried to keep my voice steady while I sponged.I shouldnt think anyone would do such a thing for joy.No?You should ha seen him.Who?The redcoat captain that skinned my back for me.If he was not precisely joyous, he was at least verra pleased with himself.More nor I was, he added wryly.Randall was the name.Randall!I couldnt keep the shock from my voice.Cold blue eyes fixed on mine.Youre familiar with the man?The voice was suddenly suspicious.No, no!I used to know a family of that name, a long time, uh, a long time ago.In my nervousness, I dropped the sponge cloth.Drat, now that will have to be boiled again.I scooped it off the floor and bustled to the fireplace, trying to hide my confusion in busyness.Could this Captain Randall possibly be Franks ancestor, the soldier with the sterling record, gallant on the field of battle, recipient of commendations from dukes?And if so, could someone related to my sweet gentle Frank possibly be capable of inflicting the horrifying marks on this lads back?I busied myself at the fire, dropping in a few more handfuls of witch hazel and garlic, setting more cloths to soak.When I thought I could control my voice and face, I came back to Jamie, sponge in hand.Why were you flogged?I asked abruptly.It was hardly tactful, but I badly wanted to know, and was too tired to phrase it more gently.He sighed, moving his shoulder uneasily under my ministrations.He was tired, too, and I was undoubtedly hurting him, gentle as I tried to be.The first time was escape, and the second was theftor at least thats what the charge sheet read.What were you escaping from?The English, he said, with an ironic lift of his brow.If ye mean where, Fort William.I gathered it was the English, I said, matching the dryness of his tone.What were you doing in Fort William in the first place?He rubbed his brow with his free hand.Oh, that.I think that was obstruction.Obstruction, escape, and theft.You sound a right dangerous character, I said lightly, hoping to distract him from what I was doing.It worked at least slightly; one corner of the wide mouth turned up, and one dark blue eye glinted back over his shoulder at me.Oh, I am that, he said.A wonder you think yourself safe in the same room wi me, and you an English lassie.Well, you look harmless enough at the moment.This was entirely untrue; shirtless, scarred and blood smeared, with stubbled cheeks and reddened eyelids from the long night ride, he looked thoroughly disreputable.And tired or not, he looked entirely capable of further mayhem, should the need arise.He laughed, a surprisingly deep, infectious sound.Harmless as a setting dove, he agreed.Im too hungry to be a threat to anything but breakfast.Let a stray bannock come within reach, though, and Ill no answer for the consequences.Ooh!Sorry, I muttered.The stab wounds deep, and its dirty.Its all right.But he had gone pale beneath the coppery stubble of his beard.
