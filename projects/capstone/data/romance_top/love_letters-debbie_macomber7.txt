We can have the cheese, bread, grapes, and wine on the lawn at the inn.That would be a perfect way to end our afternoon, dont you think?Its a lovely idea.Maggie would find a convenient excuse to avoid the wine.Shed always watched her diet whenever she was pregnant, and she wouldnt do anything less this time.Shall we drive back instead of the ferry?That had been their original plan.Sure, and stop at the car museum in Tacoma?Her husbands look was hopeful.Maggie smiled and nodded.Shed never paid that much attention to cars, but they were a passion with Roy, who subscribed to a number of car magazines.Finding their way to the freeway seemed a challenge, but once they were on the main thoroughfare, Maggie relaxed and, despite her best effort, found herself drifting off to sleep.She shook herself awake and found Roy studying her.My goodness, whats wrong with you?he asked.Youve slept more this weekend than you have in the last two years.This last month has been stressful, hasnt it?Maggie agreed.It has.Well, youll get a chance to catch up now.Weve weathered this storm, Maggie girl, and our marriage is stronger for it, dont you think?What Roy didnt know was that they had even deeper waters to traverse.Nor did he realize that they were about to get caught up in hurricane force winds.20     Ellie hurried to where shed agreed to meet her father.Her head was spinning as questions hurled themselves at her so quickly it was all she could do to keep focused on where she was walking.Excitement mingled with anxiety about what she would say to this man who was her father and yet a stranger.In his text message back to her, Tom had suggested the Pot Belly Deli as a good place for Ellie to meet with Scott.It was close and convenient.Looking at the street map provided by Jo Marie, she noticed the deli was next to the hair salon where shed been the day before.The salon appointment reminded Ellie of everything she had done to impress Tom and the chance shed taken meeting him.Yet all shed meant to him was the means to an end.She was just a charity project, a gift for his stepfather.Seeing that it was the middle of the afternoon, the lunch crowd had already eaten and it was too early for dinner, so there were plenty of empty tables.They would have the privacy they needed.This would be the first time in her life that shed have the opportunity to talk to the man responsible for her birth, the first time shed have a chance to hear his side of what had happened in her parents marriage.Scott was seated in a booth when she arrived at the deli.He looked up, saw it was her, and offered her what could only be described as a tentative, guilt ridden smile.As she approached the table, he stood.Ellie glanced around the room to be certain Tom wasnt anywhere close by.She remained angry and upset by his deception, and while she was willing to meet with her father, she wasnt ready to deal with Tom.As it was, her nerves were stretched to the snapping point seeing Scott Reynolds.Thank you for agreeing to meet with me, he said.He looked as nervous as Ellie felt.He folded his hands on the tabletop as if unsure what to do with them.Before she realized what she was doing, Ellie reached for a fork and ran her fingers down the handle.Embarrassed, she set it aside.Her mouth had gone dry, so she said nothing.Neither spoke.Scott studied Ellie for a long moment.You look like your mother, he said, gazing at her so intently that Ellie was forced to look away.The waitress came, and they both ordered coffee.As soon as the woman left, Scott returned his attention to her.How is your mother?Shes well.I imagine youre angry with me.Actually, her anger was directed at Tom.She had yet to form an opinion of Scott.Part of her wanted to reach out and hug him and another part wanted to shout at him in fury for the years hed ignored her.Tell me, she said, trying hard to keep her voice level and void of emotion, in all the years you were out of my life, did you ever wonder about me?This was the first of many questions that came to mind.The first one that demanded an answer.Every single day.His eyes didnt waver from hers.Not a day went by that I didnt think about you.We might have been apart, but you were right next to my heart, Ellie.Always and forever.I thought about you on your birthday, at Christmas.I wondered how you did in school and if you played the piano the way your mother and grandmother did.I lay awake at night dreaming of the little girl I barely had a chance to know, although Ive loved you your entire life.Ellie wanted to believe him, but shed seen precious little evidence of it.She hated to be cynical, but she found his declaration of love hard to fathom.But you never  not even once took the time to write or call or contact me.No, he said, and hung his head as if the weight of his failure as her father demanded that he look away.When your mother and I first split, I did everything within my power to get visitation rights.I suppose youre going to tell me my mother made that impossible.No, Scott corrected.I think your mother would have been more than willing to allow you to spend time with me on weekends.It was your grandparents.From the first, I rubbed them the wrong way.They had someone else in mind for your mother to marry, some rich guy who was the son of a longtime family friend.His mouth tightened, and anger fired in his eyes.He stopped talking, and Ellie could see the tension in his squared shoulders.Then he said, It does no good to rehash old hurts.The only reason I mention it is so youll understand that I did my best, but I couldnt afford expensive attorney fees and your grandparents could.They wanted me out of your life and made sure it happened.My grandparents are both gone now, Ellie told him, and they had been for a long time.Surely he must have realized that.I figured they must be.You could have found me.Im an adult now, and I make my own decisions.He didnt argue with her.Youre right, of course.Then why didnt you?He looked down at his hands and she noticed that hed shredded the paper napkin into a neat stack.I dont have a good excuse.I guess I was afraid.Afraid of what?She wasnt that intimidating.It took Scott a long time to answer, and when he did, he couldnt have surprised her more.I was afraid of you.Of me?She pressed her hand against her chest.Of me?she repeated, still unable to take it in.But why?I was sure you must hate me.How could I hate you when I dont know you?Ellie returned, her voice elevated until she captured the attention of those around her.Their coffee was delivered, and Ellie reached for two packets of sugar.Scott reached for two packets of sugar.Ellie reached for two cream containers.Scott reached for two cream containers.Ellie held her spoon with her left hand and stirred counterclockwise.Scott stirred his coffee counterclockwise, holding the spoon with his left hand.Ellie watched him mimic her movements.Do you always drink your coffee with two sugars and two creams?she asked.He stared at her just as intently.Do you always stir your coffee counterclockwise?Ellie nodded.Do you?Scott nodded, and then a slow, easy smile started to take shape, transforming his mouth from a worried frown to a smile of delight and pleasure.Tell me why you were afraid of me, she said, less demanding now that she was more at ease.Although they were virtual strangers, they were more alike than she would have ever guessed.It took him a while to formulate his answer.For all you knew, Id abandoned you.I couldnt be sure what your grandparents had said about me, if theyd mentioned me at all.Or what your mother had told you about the two of us.He sipped his coffee, and Ellie noticed that his forehead had creased with a thoughtful frown.Whatever you heard about me couldnt have been flattering.I heard next to nothing, she told him.As a schoolgirl, shed asked numerous times about her father, but her questions had either been ignored or gone unanswered.In other words, as far as you were concerned, I was a nonentity then.A pained look came over him.No, she said.Twice, once when I was young and again later, I asked Mom to find you because I wanted to write you a letter.Shed asked a lot more often, wanting details about her father, but quickly learned Scott Reynolds was a subject best avoided, especially around her grandparents.How old were you?Around five, I think, the first time.I wanted a certain doll for my birthday, and in my mind I thought you would want to buy it for me.Did you write me?he asked.He leaned closer to hear her answer.No, it wasnt necessary.Grandpa bought me the doll.Ellie remembered how upset her grandmother had been when Ellie had announced she wanted to write her daddy a letter.She was too young to remember much of the incident other than her seeing the tears in her mothers eyes that night when Virginia tucked Ellie in bed and listened to her prayers.Ellie had reached up and wiped the tear off her mothers cheek.When shed asked her mother why she was crying, Virginia had hugged her and said that she was sad.Ellie had never understood why her mother would be unhappy until now.When I graduated from high school I wanted to write you then, too, she explained.And your mother wouldnt let you?Again the pained look showed in his eyes.She claimed she didnt know where or how to reach you.Id left Oregon by that time and moved to Cedar Cove.His hands cradled the coffee mug, and he looked down into the milky liquid.I remarried when you were around three.I was lonely, and Deana was a widow who had her hands full with two young boys.Tom and his brother.Yes.Did they know about me?No, but every year on your birthday I brought home a cake.They never did figure it out, and that was all right by me.Talking about the daughter Id never had the opportunity to know would have been too painful.But you told Tom.She found it difficult to say his name, seeing how hed used and manipulated her.After Deana passed away so unexpectedly, I realized life holds no guarantees.I told Tom about you and how Id failed you.My deepest regret was not fighting to have you in my life.And so Tom took the matter upon himself   I would have stopped him had I known what he intended to do, Scott assured her.Which, I think, he must have suspected, because he didnt say a word to me until this morning.He didnt say a word to me, either, she muttered, with more than a hint of bitterness.Please dont be angry with Tom, her father pleaded.I believe he genuinely cares for you, Ellie.Ellie shook her head, refusing to believe it.Her father held up his hand.Ill leave that for the two of you to settle.As far as Ellie was concerned, the matter was already resolved in her mind.From this point forward, she never wanted to see or speak to Tom again.What hed done wouldnt soon be forgotten.Tom was afraid Id never get the courage to reach out to you, and, sad as this is to admit, hes probably right.He swallowed tightly and then boldly met her look.Can you forgive me for all these years of silence, Ellie?Ellie wasnt quite sure how to answer.Id like to have my father in my life.Id enjoy getting to know my daughter, too.He smiled then, a genuine smile.Now tell me everything.Everything?What do you do for a living?Do you like to read fiction?Do you play the piano?The questions rolled off his tongue with such ease Ellie had to believe hed stored them up for years.Taking a breath, she answered him, one question after another.Im part of a company that helps people organize their homes or businesses and sometimes their lives.And yes, I love fiction.Im constantly reading.And I do play the piano.Me, too.Scott beamed at her answer.Who was your first love?A boy named Dusty, and he kissed me when we were both four years old.He promised to marry me, but he went the way of all my love interests.She couldnt keep from laughing.Did you graduate at the top of your class?I did, she told him.I knew it.Your mother was the intelligent one.Did you know she was valedictorian of her high school class?Of course you did.She never liked to brag about her high IQ, but your grandfather found a reason to bring it up in every conversation.He wasnt a bad man, your grandfather, just overly protective.They spoke for a full hour and went through two more cups of coffee.Can I see you later?Scott asked.Can we meet again?Id like to take you to dinner.Yes, Id like that, Ellie assured him.It wouldnt be long before she spoke to her mother, and Ellie realized this wasnt something she could keep from Virginia.If Scott had regrets regarding his relationship with her, she wondered how he felt about the woman hed left behind.Is there anything youd like me to tell my mother?For the very briefest of moments, Scotts eyes brightened, and then his face went taut as he shook his head.No  nothing.But please let her know I wish her well.Mom never remarried, you know.His head came up, and it was impossible to ignore the surprise in his eyes.Never?She dated Wally for years.Walter Keller, her father said, frowning.Thats the man her parents wanted her to marry.What happened?He died a few years back of a heart attack.It was very sudden and very sad.Why didnt your mother marry him?I assumed that once I was out of the picture hed make his move.Ellie didnt know the answer.Youll need to ask her.I think Wally would have liked it if theyd married, but frankly I dont think Mom was interested.Her father shook his head as if he didnt know what to say.When it was time to leave Scott asked, Did you park close by?No, I walked down from where Im staying.Rose Harbor Inn?Scott said.Tom mentioned it.Ellie stiffened just hearing Toms name.Scott pressed his hand on her forearm and looked her straight in the eye.Give Tom a chance, Ellie.At least hear him out.His heart was in the right place.Maybe I will, she muttered, but not right away.I need to think this through.It seemed like Scott wanted to say more but stopped himself.They set a time and place to meet again later for dinner, and then it was time to go.Scott paid for their coffee and held open the door for her.He was a good looking man, her father, and because her attention was focused on him, she didnt notice who stood right outside the deli.Ellie.It was Tom.His eyes held hers for the longest moment.Can we talk?he asked.Please let me explain.Ellie looked toward Scott, unsure what to do.His face was blank, giving her no indication of his expectations.It would be easy to give in, especially now that shed spoken to her father.She wasnt sure she could trust Tom again, nor was she completely convinced she should trust Scott.No  she whispered.I dont think that would be a good idea.Ive said everything I have to say to you already, Tom.Lets leave it at that.21     I left Marks house and headed down the hill to the Saturday farmers market, keen on picking up a supply of fresh blueberries and a few baked goods and what I needed for the dinner with my family.Id meant to get there earlier but had gotten distracted.Rover enjoyed visiting the market; he got the opportunity to meet up with a number of his dog friends.Several of the vendors were dog owners, and the local animal shelter maintained a booth at the Saturday market.We stopped by each week, and Rover and his friends sniffed butts!He tugged against the leash in his eagerness to get down the hill, his ears alert.The market is set up in the waterfront park area behind the library.I saw that the vendor from Hood Canal was selling fresh clams and oysters this week in addition to Hood Canal shrimp.Personally, I have a weakness for steamed clams and decided to splurge on myself.Id steam them for dinner and save the broth for homemade clam chowder later in the week.I hoped he had fresh salmon in addition to the other seafood.Id make a green salad from the lettuce in my garden and dig up a few new potatoes.My mind was so preoccupied with all that I needed to purchase that I walked right past Grace Harding.Jo Marie, she said, stopping me.Grace.Hello.My goodness, I dont know where my head is, I said, laughing at myself.How are you?Grace asked, her own arms loaded down with produce and fresh flowers.Great.We saw each other in passing once or twice a week, but itd been a while since wed spent any real time together.Life gets busy for her and for me.Grace was the head librarian and a wise friend whod helped me through the shock and grief when my husbands remains had been positively identified.Id waited more than a year after his death to receive the final word, much the same as Grace had waited to learn the fate of her first husband, Dan Sherman.Rover barked, demanding Graces attention.In her spare time, Grace volunteered at the local animal shelter.She was the one responsible for bringing Rover into my life.She didnt have Beau, her golden retriever, with her, and Rover seemed disappointed.I mean how are you, really?she asked again.Unsure what to tell her, I shrugged.Im doing better, I think.Id had almost two years to get accustomed to widowhood.Time, however, did little to relieve that deep sense of loss and pain.Even now Paul remained in the forefront of my mind and I didnt expect that to change anytime soon.Not a day passed when he wasnt with me in one way or another.I often found myself talking to him almost as if I expected him to answer.I thought to mention the little thingsthat felt like big thingsthat Id noticed Id lost regarding my husband, but this wasnt the time or the place.And how is Rover?Grace asked, directing the question to my canine friend.Rover sat on his haunches, and Grace bent down and rubbed his ears.He stretched his chin toward her, and Grace obligingly ran her hand down the underside of his chin.Looking back at me, she said, I read an interesting article recently having to do with therapy dogs.Seeing Eye Dogs?I asked.Well, I suppose a few of them might be, but this had to do with men returning from Iraq and Afghanistan whod suffered traumatic physical and emotional wounds.The military had taken to giving them therapy dogs as companions.Rover had certainly been a companion to me.The article said these dogs were extremely helpful to these men and women, offering companionship and comfort.The piece called them comfort dogs.Her gaze held mine.I remember you telling me the story of you and Rover and how he chose you.Rover is my comfort dog, I said.Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Mark was at the market, weaving his way between booths, chatting with Bob Beldon.The two were clearly friends and seemed to be enjoying the conversation.I had Buttercup, Grace said, redirecting my attention back to her.Right away I noticed that her eyes had grown thoughtful and sad.Buttercup?I repeated.Beau was the only pet I knew about.She died a few years back, and it nearly broke my heart.The interesting part is that I got Buttercup through Charlotte Rhodes, Judge Olivias mother, shortly after Dan disappeared.Olivias my best friend.Buttercup was my comfort dog.Grace glanced at her wrist.Oh my goodness, Im late.My husband and I are babysitting grandchildren this afternoon.I better scoot.Good to see you, she said and gave me a quick hug.Then before I could say anything more she was off, rushing toward the library parking lot.I debated whether to seek Mark out or not and felt I wouldnt.Rover regarded me as if he, too, was wrestling with the decision.Once Grace was gone, I headed toward the fruit vendor and purchased an abundant supply of freshly picked blueberries and had to resist munching on them.They were ripe and oversized, and sweet.The farmer told me shed picked them that very morning.Id use them for more than the blueberry muffins.Blueberry pie was one of my brothers favorites, and Id bake one for him for our Sunday dinner.I had the blueberries in a bag over my arm when I saw Corrie McAfee.She waved, and, because my hands were full, I nodded back.I pulled on Rovers leash when I saw her weaving through the crowd to get to me.Jo Marie, Corrie said, sounding a bit breathless.Youre just the person I was hoping to see.Oh?I had a chat this morning with Peggy Beldon.I knew the two women were best friends and were often together.Peggy mentioned you were interested in finding out what you could about Mark Taylor.My stomach sank.Id let my curiosity get out of hand.I regretted ever having asked Peggy about Mark.It embarrassed me now, especially since word of my interest had gotten out.Not really, I said, with a halfhearted shrug.Oh, sorry, I thought Peggy said  I did ask her a few questions, but its nothing important.I hoped I didnt sound overly defensive for fear she would read more into that than warranted.I can tell you one thing I know about him thats a bit out of the ordinary, she volunteered.Oh?I probably should have tried harder, but I couldnt hide my interest.I knew so little about Mark, and while it wasnt important, I remained curious.Peggy and I both remember when he moved to town.He bought the house off the Internet.A friend of ours whos in real estate said Mark saw the house online, phoned, and without doing anything more than get an inspection, purchased the house.Furthermore, he paid cash.He paid cash?I didnt know anyone with that kind of money.Bob met Mark shortly after he moved to town.He recommended him for odd jobs, and we hired Mark to fix a couple things around the house.I found it a bit unusual that a man who could afford to pay cash for a house would then take on odd jobs.Itd come to my attention a number of times that while Mark was a good worker with a strong work ethic, he didnt seem overly concerned about money.Our porch needed the foundation repaired, Corrie continued, interrupting my musings.I glanced up and blinked.Bob said Mark was our man.He gave us an excellent price, did the work in record time, and as they say, the rest is history.Mark might work efficiently for others, but that hadnt been my experience with him.Thankfully, I didnt pay him by the hour.Hes a great guy, Corrie said.I know hes done quite a bit of work for you.He has, I agreed.Corrie frowned and once more her look grew thoughtful.Something else   Yes?I probably shouldnt be this openly curious.Corrie looked uncertain if she should say it or not, but apparently decided she should.I think he might have served in the military.That was an interesting observation.What makes you think that?Id never heard Mark make any reference to having been in the service, but that wasnt unusual.A while back, Corrie said, I ordered a bookcase made in Scandinavia, and when it arrived the instructions were in Swedish.The kit came with pictures, but it was impossible for either Roy or me to follow the illustrations without understanding the written instructions.I was utterly frustrated, and after several tries, Roy was, too.Exasperated, he contacted Mark and asked if he could assemble the project.We were both shocked at how quickly Mark managed to build that bookcase.He had it together in no time.And the thing is, I swear he could read the language.Its a leap to assume hed been military, dont you think?I said, wondering how Corrie had made the connection.Perhaps, but I had that impression a couple other times as well.Roy, too, and my husband has a talent for sensing things about people.He knows a bit of German, and when he asked Mark a question in the language, Mark answered him back in German.It came so easily to him that I have to believe he must be a linguist.Mark?This was an entirely different side of him that I had never seen.It troubled me that I could consider Mark a close friend and know so little about his background.I know you said you werent all that interested in digging up information about Mark, Corrie said, and tapped her index finger against her lips as if mulling over a thought.But if you change your mind, Roy could help.I knew Corries husband was a retired Seattle policeman turned part time private eye, but hiring him to investigate Mark was above and beyond anything I would ever consider.Before I could assure her I wasnt interested, Corrie continued.Roy knows people who know people who could dig up everything there is to know about Mark Taylor.If you want, I could ask him to find out what he can.I immediately shook my head.I appreciate the offer, but no thanks.What I wanted, I realized, was for Mark to trust me enough to voluntarily share his personal history with me.Since moving to Cedar Cove, all the days hed worked at the inn and wed shared coffee on the deck or in my kitchen, I was fairly certain he knew practically everything there was to know about me.It stung my pride that I considered him a better friend than he apparently did me.By now Rover had grown restless and was tugging against the leash, eager to visit his friends.I bid Corrie a good afternoon and then finished my rounds at the market.By the time we left, my arms were loaded down with clams, salmon, blueberries, fresh ripe tomatoes, French bread, and a bouquet of huge pink dahlias.Rover wasnt being the least bit cooperative as I headed up the hill.He seemed to feel it was his obligation to mark every blade of grass along the way.Come on, Rover, I urged.This stuff is getting heavy.Looks like you could use an extra hand.I glanced over my shoulder and discovered Mark, walking at a clipped pace directly behind me.Right away I feared hed overheard me talking to Corrie McAfee  about him.Hi, I managed.Would you like some help with that?My cheeks felt hot, and I was convinced theyd filled with color.It would be embarrassing in the extreme if he had overheard us.You feeling all right?he asked, frowning at me.Ah  why shouldnt I feel okay?I said, and immediately wanted to bite back the words, knowing they came off a bit gruff and defensive.Mark did a double take.I dont know.You tell me.Nothing to tell you, I said.Do you want help or not?My arms ached to the point my upper arm muscles quivered.By this point, Rover was half dragging me up the hill.Your choice, Mark said, and hightailed it past me as if I stood still.Okay, I called after him.Please.He turned back and grinned as if hed won a verbal battle.Youre in a quirky mood this afternoon.Sorry.He took the heaviest packages, leaving me with the blueberries and the French bread.We started up the steepest part of the hill.I grew winded faster than Mark, who barely breathed hard.Last winter, after a snowfall, the street had been closed to traffic because it was so steep and dangerously slippery.I had to admit walking up it was good exercise.I saw you chatting with Corrie McAfee, Mark mentioned casually.You both seemed pretty intense.I swallowed hard.This was what I was afraid would happen.He seemed to be waiting for me to fill him in on my conversation, but, by heaven, if he could keep secrets, then so could I.  My mouth was firmly closed.I said nothing, which is what he generally did when I asked him a question he didnt want to answer.Everything good with Corrie and Roy?he asked.I assume so.Hed need to torture anything more out of me.Theyre a nice couple.I think so, too, I said, eager to agree with him.Did you know Roy is a retired Seattle detective?I asked.I heard as part of his services he does background checks.Mark looked straight ahead as he spoke.I swear my vocal cords went numb for two or three seconds.Oh?You knew that, Jo Marie, admit it.I pretended indifference and shrugged.Are you tempted to hire him?Do I need anyone investigated?I asked, preferring not to answer his question.Mark laughed, he actually laughed, and I had the distinct feeling he was toying with me.It seemed the best approach was a more direct one.What are you hiding, Mark?Hiding?he repeated.Do you honestly think Im purposely hiding?From what?From whom?I dont know, thats why Im asking.Theres nothing to tell.You mean theres nothing you want to tell.His eyes grew dark and serious.Youre right.Theres nothing I want to tell.Leave it at that, Jo Marie.22     Maggie had trouble keeping her eyes open as Roy drove south on I 5 toward Tacoma and the car museum.Two or three times shed drifted off to sleep only to abruptly shake herself awake.My goodness, youre a sleepyhead, Roy commented, taking his eyes off the road to glance her way.He seemed to find her inability to stay awake amusing.Its the warm car and the chill music, she said, in an effort to distract him from the real reason.Maybe I should change to a heavy metal station, her husband teased.Not a bad idea.She managed a smile and hit the scan button on the radio until they landed on a station that played classic rock, which they both enjoyed.The loud beat filled the car, music that theyd listened to while dating.Youre being a good sport about this car thing, Roy said, and reached across the seat to gently squeeze her hand.Youre a car freak.She wasnt telling him anything he didnt already know.Hed been wonderfully patient when shed searched out antique buttons.It felt good to give him this small pleasure.She hoped he would remember this later and think kindly of her.He hadnt said a word when theyd passed the classic car museum next to the Tacoma Dome just off the interstate on the trip over from Yakima.He couldnt help but notice it.At the time, she remembered, theyd barely been speaking.His eyes had lit up when Jo Marie mentioned it, too.Maggie wasnt that keen on motorized vehicles.As long as they got her to and from where she needed to go and the car was safe for her children, she was content.Not so with Roy.When shopping for their last family car, Roy had a detailed list of features as long as Jaxon and Collins letters to Santa.All she requested was that the new car be blue.They ended up with a white vehicle, because that was the only one in a three state area that offered all the amenities Roy required.Maggie was fine with the color, although she would have preferred blue.Do you remember what I said to you shortly after Collin was born?Roy said, chuckling.Like I could forget.Exhausted from the long labor, Maggie had fallen into an elated sleep.After their newborn son had been bathed, weighed, and measured, and the grandparents notified of the latest addition to their family, Roy had settled down in the hospital room with Maggie.While she slept he read his car magazines and talked about one day teaching his sons to drive.It was his way of telling her how pleased he was to have two sons.I remember all too well.The museums not far now, Roy said, as they drove through a community known as Fife.Maggie could see the Tacoma Dome in the distance and would be grateful to get out of the car.Although shed barely touched her lunch, her stomach had a queasy feeling that left her feeling sick and light headed.It was all due to nerves, she suspected.Sweat broke out across her brow, and she pressed her hand against her stomach and prayed her discomfort wasnt obvious.They exited the freeway, and after driving around a bit, found the museum and a parking spot.Maggie climbed out of the car and took in deep breaths of fresh air, hoping that would help hide her discomfort.One glance in their cars sideview mirror showed her face to be ghastly pale.Her cheeks were devoid of color, and she looked dreadful.Her one hope was that Roy would be paying more attention to the exhibits than he was to her.If he noticed she was unwell, he thankfully didnt comment.Roy paid the entrance fee to the museum and they went inside.Her husbands eyes widened with appreciation for the variety of vehicles on display.I think Ill find a ladies room, Maggie said, striving to sound as casual as possible.Do you want me to wait for you?No, no, I might be a few minutes.Ill find you.Okay.He was eager to explore, and for that Maggie was thankful.She located the restroom area and hurried inside, nearly stumbling in her eagerness to get into the stall.Almost immediately she lost what little lunch shed eaten.When shed finished vomiting, she leaned her shoulder against the cubicle wall, letting it support her.She continued to feel light headed and dreadfully ill.Are you okay?a woman asked from behind her.Maggie hadnt taken the time to close the stall door.She turned around to find an older, grandmotherly woman behind her.Im fine, thank you.Maggie pressed her hand against her forehead.You dont look it, dear.Do you need to sit down?Ill be okay, Maggie insisted.She didnt want anyone making a fuss over her for fear it would bring unwanted attention.Grabbing a handful of toilet tissue, she wadded it up and wiped her mouth clean.Let me see if I can get you some water, the older woman offered.Thank you, Maggie whispered.She needed to rinse out her mouth, and longingly dreamed of a nice soft bed that she could crawl into and curl up in a fetal position.The woman returned with a paper cup and another woman who worked for the museum.Can I get you anything?the second woman asked.Please, I dont want to be a bother.Its no bother, the museum employee insisted.Shall I call someone for you?No, no, my husband is here and I dont want to ruin this for him.I understand, the older woman said.Henry loves these classic cars.My goodness, he dragged me all the way from Olympia just so we could stop by this car museum.Theres a nice comfortable chair by the entrance, if you feel you need to sit down, the attendant told her, and seeing that there wasnt anything more she could do, she left.The older woman studied Maggie.I had the same problem when I was pregnant, she said, lowering her voice.The first three months were dreadful for me.I couldnt keep a single thing down.Maggie wasnt about to confirm her condition to this stranger.It would be just her luck to run into the woman later when Roy was close enough to hear and have her spout off something about the pregnancy.I think it was something that disagreed with me at lunch, Maggie offered, hoping to turn the womans suspicions elsewhere.The woman frowned.My dear, Ive worked as a nurse for a GYN for nearly thirty years.I know the look, and youve got it in spades.If you dont believe me, make an appointment with your doctor or buy one of those pregnancy tests.Maggie pretended surprise.Maybe I will, she murmured, not meeting the other womans gaze.I  I better find my husband, she said, eager to escape.It took Maggie only a few minutes to locate Roy, who had his eyes on a classic 1936 Mercedes Benz 540K.He walked all the way around the vehicle with his hands in his pockets as if he was half afraid he would reach out and touch the car like a priceless piece of artwork.For a few minutes he didnt seem to notice Maggie was beside him.Its in mint condition, he said, keeping his voice low and reverent, as though speaking in church.Maggie followed Roy while he admired a number of other vehicles, but she could feel herself growing tired and weak.Would you mind if I sat down for a bit?she asked, hoping to downplay her almost desperate need to rest.She shouldnt have asked, because Roy, whod bent over to inspect the inside of a 1960 bright yellow Chevy Corvette, straightened and then focused his attention on her.Maggie, are you feeling all right?Of course, she said, almost flippantly.These shoes are a bit tight, and weve done a lot of walking today.I thought Id take a load off my feet.Do you want to go back to the inn?he asked, as he continued to study her, his eyes filled with concern.Not in the least.So she lied.Ill be by the entrance.I saw a chair there earlier.Roy hesitated.Ill hurry through the rest of the museum.Please dont.Not on my account.Im perfectly content to sit for a while.Enjoy yourself and take as much time as you want.He studied her as if he wasnt sure he should believe her.This isnt like you.What isnt?she asked, and forced a small laugh.Being this patient.Roy, thats completely unfair.Even if it was true, dont you think you should take advantage of my generosity and count your blessings?Okay, okay, youre right.Go make yourself comfortable and Ill finish going through the museum.Take however long you want.Again his look told her he was mildly suspicious.Grateful to leave her husband, Maggie returned to the spot the museum attendant had mentioned earlier.She sank into the padded chair, leaned her head back, and closed her eyes.It felt incredibly good to be off her feet.Almost right away she felt better than she had all day.She didnt know how long she remained in the chair before Roy came to get her.This collection is amazing, he said, and sounded as excited and pleased as their son Jaxon after spending an hour in the park climbing on the playground equipment.Thanks, honey, Roy said.Youre most welcome.She was pleased they were able to do something he enjoyed.The next time you want to drag me to a chick movie, I promise not to complain.Thats a fair trade, she said, with a grin, and looped her arm around his.They started out the exit and were joined by the older woman Maggie had met in the ladies restroom.With everything in her she silently pleaded with the other woman not to mention their first meeting or her suspicions.Hello again, the woman said, and either she hadnt seen or ignored Maggies plea.Hello, Maggie said casually, letting it be known with the lack of warmth in her reply that she wasnt interested in exchanging chitchat.Are you feeling better?the woman asked, hurrying to catch up with Maggie and Roy.Much, thank you.She nearly collapsed with relief when the couple headed in the opposite direction once they left the museum.You werent feeling well again?Roy asked.Im feeling great.Which was a small exaggeration, but Maggie had discovered she was beginning to get better with this subterfuge.You dont look it, Maggie.In fact, you look a bit pale.They reached their car and Maggie made a show of looking in the sideview mirror once again.I am?Dont you see it?Maybe I have a touch of the flu, she said, hoping Roy would accept the excuse and leave it at that.Do you want me to find one of those walk in medical clinics?Dont be ridiculous, she said, and laughed off his suggestion.I hate the thought of you being sick.I feel better already.He frowned in her direction, and it was apparent he didnt believe her.Shall we return to the inn?he asked.I suppose, she said, as if it was of little difference to her.Unless theres some place else youd like to explore.The Museum of Glass is just down the road, Roy reminded her.In other circumstances Maggie would have enjoyed viewing the famous museum and visiting the gift shop, but not now.Her hesitation told Roy all he needed to know.You want to go back to the inn.She hated to put a damper on their weekend, but she really was sick.Maybe that would be for the best.Then you arent feeling as well as you claim.Im just a bit under the weather, she said, once more brushing off his concern.He started the car and without much of a problem returned to the freeway.If I didnt know better Id think you were pregnant, he said, and the moment the words were out of his mouth, he went completely still.For one wild second Maggie was afraid he was about to pull off to the side of the road.Neither said anything for several heart stopping moments.Youre taking birth control pills, right?Roy asked, his words tight and strange.He hardly sounded like himself.Of course I am, she assured him, hoping to sound calm and confident.Every single day?he pressed.I might have missed a few times, she confessed.Actually, Maggie had all but abandoned the pill.It hadnt been a conscious decision.At first shed simply forgotten, and really, what was the point?Theyd made love only twice in the last month  itd been his lack of sexual appetite that had alerted Maggie that there was something wrong with their marriage.That something turned out to be someone, and that someone turned out to be Katherine.Maggie.Roy whispered her name almost as if he had trouble speaking.I notice you didnt immediately assure me you arent pregnant.I didnt?she asked, stalling.Are you or arent you?he demanded.Tension pounded like a gong between them.Are you?he asked again, louder this time.Hanging her head, Maggie found she couldnt answer him.It might have gone better if shed told him as soon as her suspicions were confirmed, but she doubted it.Roy pressed his foot against the gas pedal and the car jerked forward.I guess that answers that.Im also guessing you dont have a clue who the father of this baby is.23     Im sorry, Ellie.None of this worked out the way I thought it would, Tom said, hurrying after her as she left the deli.Apparently, he refused to accept that she wanted nothing more to do with him.It was hard because she so badly wanted to trust him, but she couldnt allow herself to give in when it was clear hed used her for his own purposes.She might be able to look past all that if hed told her beforehand, if hed confided in her instead of springing it on her without even a hint of a warning.The conversation with her father had gone better than shed expected, although there remained a lot of unanswered questions.She hoped theyd be able to talk more over dinner.It was clear there was no love lost between him and her grandparents, but Ellie didnt know what role her mother had played in the breakup of the marriage.Ellie, Tom said, keeping his steps in tune with hers.Say something.She glanced at him, hardly knowing how to communicate her feelings, which remained mixed.She was terribly confused.What did you expect would happen?Ellie asked, gesturing with her hands.A lot of her anger remained.She wouldnt, couldnt, dismiss his subterfuge lightly.Hed misled her in more ways than the obvious.Shed trusted Tom, and hed abused that trust.I felt terrible after you left the waterfront, Tom said.Not any more than I did, she returned stiffly.How could you use me like this, Tom?How could you?I never meant to hurt you.You should have thought of that long before now.She couldnt imagine what hed been thinking.Nor had he considered how shed react once she discovered what hed done.Clearly, he hadnt thought matters through.It seemed to her that after hed introduced her to Scott he intended to melt into the background.His role was finished, and so he was done with her as well.The look in your eyes broke my heart.I cant leave matters as they are, I just cant.Ellie had nothing to say to that.I wanted to tell you before you met Scott, he continued.I fully intended to explain everything Friday night, and found I couldnt, not so soon.You were so beautiful and youd taken this big leap toward independence and I didnt have the heart to destroy your faith in me so soon.I was wrong, Ellie.Im so sorry.You should have told me rather than springing it on me unexpectedly like this.Ellie wasnt sure how she would have dealt with the news, but she would have at least had a chance to process it.In some ways it would have been easier to deal with on Friday than it was now.If hed told her when hed first come to the inn, it would have been a shock, yes, but she would have known then.But to hit her with it after their dinner date and sailing, after theyd kissed and looked into each others eyes  the wound cut deeper, and made his betrayal feel more intense.I couldnt be more sorry, but we met and it felt so good to be with you and to kiss you, he whispered.I was afraid that if you found out what Id done you wouldnt want anything more to do with me  I wanted that extra time with you.I hoped that after we were together youd be willing to  hell, I dont know what I thought would happen when you met your father.I did this for him, but then later I realized it was for myself.I fell for you, Ellie.Im not exaggerating or making excuses or anything else.All I want is another chance with you.Im in love with you.If you believe nothing else, believe that.I love you.Ellie shook her head as though to shake off his words.She needed more time.Her emotions felt like golf ballsize bits of hail pounding down on her from all sides.Shed met her father.Her father.This was the man shed never had the chance to know.Shed met Scott through Tom, the man she loved, only to discover that Tom had manipulated her, and now he was saying he loved her.It was too much to absorb all at once.She needed to sort everything out in her head before she could deal with Tom.He started to speak again, but Ellie raised her hand, stopping him.Give me time.How long?I dont know   Youll talk to me, though, right?Sometime  soon.She agreed with a simple nod and then held out her hand silently asking him to back away, letting him know she wanted to continue back to the inn on her own.Tom reluctantly slowed his pace and eventually dropped back, letting her go on without him.When she reached the top of the hill she glanced over her shoulder and found Tom standing on the sidewalk with his shoulders slouched, looking as if the world had come crashing down on him.Ellie continued on toward the inn, her head and her heart in turmoil.Her temple pounded with the beginning of a headache.As soon as she was back in her room, she swallowed two aspirin and lay down to close her eyes.Just as the shock and tension were starting to leave her body and she was beginning to relax, her phone rang.Because she had half expected something like this would happen, Ellie had kept her cell on the bed next to her.A quick glance told her it was her mother.Hi, Mom.Ellie?Her mother didnt bother to hide her surprise.Youre actually going to talk to me?Yes   Right away her mother sensed something had happened.Honey, whats wrong?Oh Mom   Tell me.I can hear it in your voice.Its something bad, isnt it?You know you can tell me anything.Oh sweet heaven, this is exactly what I feared would happen.You know  Mom, stop, Ellie demanded, abruptly cutting her off.She sat up on the mattress, her back against the headboard, and pressed her fingertips against her throbbing temple.Her mother sucked in her breath, which seemed to vibrate over the phone.Tell me, just tell me.Ellies soft intake echoed that of her mother.I met my father.Silence.Absolute silence.Mom, did you hear me?Yes.Virginias voice was barely above a whisper.How did that happen?Ellie hardly knew where to start, so she gave the short version.Tom is my fathers stepson.Right away, she could sense her mothers indignation, which matched her own.They tricked you.Yes, Tom tricked me.Itd been a shock, to say the least, but now Ellie had had time to absorb part of it.Yes, she was badly shaken, but she could deal with that; it was everything that had happened since that upset her most.Despite what Tom claimed, it was obvious her so called father hadnt tried nearly hard enough to connect with her as a child, or even later as an adult.Come home, Virginia insisted.Pack your suitcase and leave for home right away.I cant believe this has happened  of all the low, underhanded schemes.Mom, theres more   More?Once again, it seemed her mother was shocked into silence.I talked to him.You actually talked to your father?Yes, and Im meeting him later for dinner.Eleanor  no.Absolutely not.I wont allow it.Her mothers voice trembled, but it wasnt with anger.It was a tone Ellie didnt recognize, a plea more than a demand.Was it fear she heard?Regret?It sounded almost identical to what shed heard in her fathers voice when speaking about her mother.Why should I scurry back to Oregon?Ellie asked.Ellie, you cant seriously consider staying the rest of the weekend.Not after this.
