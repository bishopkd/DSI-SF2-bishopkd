Try to remember that.Someone is out there sheddin tears for you, worryin themselves into a grave whilst you foolishly talk of chasin a dream that isnt even yours to chase.Why did he feel as if she was wrong?Why did he feel as if there was no one waiting for him?Not a mother.Not a wife.No one.Tis very difficult for me to care about people I cant even remember, be they shedding tears for me or not.Though he couldnt see her face against the wavering shadows, he could see the softening of her rigid stance.She blew out a breath.I suppose I understand.She waved him over.Come.We shouldnt linger.Trouble brews in the dark around these parts.Drawing in the sharpness of the dank evening air, he crossed the dirt road toward her, the lone gas lamp flickering as it unevenly lit the mired path before him.He scanned the stretching width of the dank street.Cramped wooden buildings loomed in the surrounding darkness, murky yellow lamps lighting broken windows stuffed with rags and heaven knows what else.Silhouettes of men and women lurked on the streets and hovered in doorways.Others casually lounged on the curb of the pavement in small groups, chuckling and having muted conversations as if respectably sitting around a table to dine.An old man holding a dented tankard staggered past on an angle, bellowing in an off key tone, The devil and me, together we pee, yessiree, the devil and me.Robinson swallowed against the knot lodged in his throat.Is this where she lived?All of this felt wrong.She didnt belong here amongst these grimy shadows and broken windows stuffed with rags.No wonder she dreamed of apple trees and open fields.A headache pinched his skull, making him squint in an attempt to fight against his sudden discomfort.He quickened his stride until he paused before her and a doorstep leading into a large two story building.Something snorted and darted past his legs, making him jump aside in heart pounding astonishment.A round, furless creature wobbled down the pavement and into the inky shadows of the night.He pointed at it.What the hell was that?A pig, she remarked, lowering her gaze and moving around him.Theyre always wanderin the street lookin for food.Much like everyone else round these parts.He eyed her.A pig?In the city?She set her chin.I hate to disappoint you, Brit, but in this ward, pigs are considered highly respectable citizens.Sensing she was still irked with him, he edged toward her.If I had known that I would upset you like this, I would have never kissed you.Know that.She crossed her arms over her chest.It wasnt your fault.I willingly gave in to it.I justI dont want this turnin into a mess, is all.Ive got plans for a better life and I dont want those plans to fall aside, see?Im not gettin any younger and the Five Points is agin me fast.He dragged in a breath and let it out.It chafed knowing that he was nothing but an inconvenience to her, especially after that kiss.Did she kiss all men like that?I have no intention to impose upon your plans, he managed.Good.It means well get along.She gestured toward the doorstep leading into a small building whose sparse windows were lit by warm light peering out from behind lopsided curtains.Follow me and mind the step.He lingered as she withdrew a key from a stitched pocket within her gown and opened the entrance door.Waving him into the blurring abyss of a narrow stairwell, she closed the main entrance door behind them.Grabbing his hand firmly, she guided him into the darkness.Dont let go.I wont.He tightened his hold, fingering her small, callus roughened hand.It was odd to feel as though he was under her protection and mercy.She gently shook his hand.Use your other hand to balance yourself against the wall as we go up.There are sixteen stairs.The first always trips everyone up, even me.So mind it.He bit back a smile, touched by her mothering.After a few blind pats, he found the wall she was referring to and lifted his booted foot, placing it on the first step.He caught the edge and carefully slid into place.You do this every night?I have to sleep sometime, dont I?Are there no lamps to make use of?There are, but theyre usually dashed out by nine thirty.Weve had too many fires down the street.She tightened her fingers around his hand and tugged him upward.Cant you go any faster?Raymond was three and fifty the day his heart stopped and he managed to run these stairs up and down in the dark as if he were twenty.It wasnt much of a compliment having that pointed out.Robinson released her hand and hurried up the remaining stairs, boldly taking two at a time in the darkness.Angling past her warmth, he jumped onto the landing with an impressive thud.There.Did Raymond ever skip stairs in the darkness the way I just did?Never mock a dead man who doesnt deserve it.Her hand caught his arm.She tugged him toward the end of what appeared to be a blackened corridor.There are two floors and four tenements on each floor.Most of the people livin here are men.Dont know how that came to be, but dont think the worst of me.Its just how it is.Unlike them, Im fortunate enough to afford my own tenement.Raymond knew the landlord, so I only pay three dollars a month for what could easily be six.She released his hand and patted his arm.Stay where you are.There was a chink of a key being pushed into a lock and then a click and the door creaked open.Her heels echoed against the floorboards and he could hear the flint being struck.A glass oil lamp sputtered to life, brilliantly illuminating not only her pale face but a small yellow wallpapered kitchen one could easily cross in but three strides.The heavy scent of starch, lye and soap drifted toward him.Youll get used to the smell, she offered conversationally.Its better than the one outside, to be sure.I do all of my work in the front room as opposed to the yard outside, see.That way nothin gets stolen.She set the glass lamp onto a wooden table set across from a brick hearth bearing a cauldron.She loosened the tie beneath her chin, the blue ribbons cascading in a flutter to her slim shoulders.She stripped the oval bonnet from her head with a sigh and glanced down, neatly retying the ribbon into a perfect bow.Bustling toward the wall, she leaned over a coal bin and hung her bonnet gently from a nail positioned next to another nail that held a faded wooden rosary.Her thick bundled hair appeared almost brown in the dim light, with only hints of bright red as she turned back to the chair and swept up a plaid apron.She affixed it around her waist with three quick movements.His eyes dropped from her slim shoulders to her aproned waist.It was like being her husband and peering into a very intimate routine.He rather liked it.It made him feel as if he were walking into his own home and into the arms of a woman who was his.Remembering the way her hot, wet tongue had eagerly moved against his own, he gripped the wood trim harder to force out any thoughts of wanting her in that way again.It was obvious she didnt want more of it.Not from him, anyway.She glanced up and turned toward him.Are you goin to stand there and let the world know Im home?Shut the door.He cleared his throat and stepped into the small room, shutting the door with a thud.He paused, noting three metal bolts.He gestured toward them.Do you want me to bolt all three?Thats what theyre there for, Brit.To keep the world out.Unless your boxing skills are better than mine.She had a reply for everything.He affixed all of the metal latches into place and turned back toward her.Sensing she was still annoyed with him, he held up both hands in truce.Meeting her gaze, he set them behind his back, locking a hand over a wrist against his spine.I wont grab for you.She smiled, pulled out one of the two chairs from beside the small table and gestured toward it.Sit.Im over it.If only he was.He strode toward the chair, pressing his hands tightly against his back, and sat, causing the chair to creak in protest.It wobbled beneath him.Carefully sliding back into it out of fear hed break it, he slipped his hands out from behind his back and set them on his knees.He shifted, eyeing the small kitchen, and leaned forward to scan the two other adjoining rooms that light didnt spread into.She gestured toward one of the small rooms he was looking at.That there is the closet.The closet?Where I sleep.Dont you mean the bedchamber?She dropped a hand to her side.Is that what you Brits call it?She tsked.You boyos certainly like to make everythin sound so much fancier than it really is.Its a closet with a straw bed and a trunk.Nothin more.He lowered his gaze down to his boots, sensing she didnt particularly like the British.Where do you want me to sleep?She sighed.You can sleep with me on the bed.Theres room and I dont mind.He glanced up.She was really looking to make him suffer.I hardly think it wise we share a bed.There was no bed on that omni, Robinson, and yet neither of us could keep our hands to ourselves.Between these three small rooms, our bodies are goin to be rubbin up against each other quite a bit, so youd best get used to it.He feigned a laugh.I might not physically survive you or this.Im still a bit astounded by that kiss you gave me.It was remarkable enough for me to want more.Ill agree that it was, but you really need to try to keep everythin buttoned up in those trousers from here on out.If the urge is particularly strong, just ask for some privacy and make use of your hand.All right?He shifted his jaw, feeling his body temperature rising.It was like she was a man, not a woman.I ask that you not talk like that to me, Georgia.I find it unsettling and vulgar coming from your mouth.She clicked her tongue at him.Im a nun compared to all the other women around me, but Ill do my best not to offend.She drifted past him toward the cupboard and pointed toward a corked bottle.Ive got whiskey, if you want it.Came straight from the barrel down the street.Tis the best in the ward at a dime a gallon and has enough smoke and bite to make it worth your while.He let out a low whistle.In England we call that death.A giggle escaped her.She turned toward him, tilting her head to one side to better observe him.Do you remember anythin about England?He paused.No.Not really.Ah, youre better off, I say.Youre cursed enough.Now.How about you drink up a good tin of whiskey?Itll help you sleep.He shook his head.No.I would rather not.My mind is muddled enough without  A resounding thud hit the adjoining wall, sending a tremor throughout the room.He rose to his feet.What was that?She winced and waved toward the main wall opposite them.Never you mind John Andrew Malloy over there.He feels the need to entertain the masses every now and then.Just ignore it.You mean hes hosting a formal gathering?At this hour?She pursed her lips as if he were a complete dolt.Not quite.Steady, rhythmic thuds grew more and more pronounced as muffled moans filtered through the wall.Thats it, Georgia.Come on.Let me hear it.A woman cried out, mingling with those thrusting grunts.His brows rose as his face and skin prickled with astounded heat.He glanced over at Georgia and gestured toward the wall.By God.Did he justsay your name?Or did I imagine that?She turned and quickly headed over to the cupboard and commenced arranging and rearranging all of her plates, even though they were already arranged.Apparently, he hadnt imagined it at all.Rapid, feverish thumps rattled the plates Georgia tried to reorganize.Take it, Georgia.Take every last  A woman gasped against a massive thud that vibrated the floor beneath Robinsons boots.Now, now, not so hard, John!Im not running a charity here.Georgia cringed and swung away, slapping a hand over her mouth.Robinsons throat tightened as the need to protect her honor descended upon him like a massive wave crashing to the shore.She didnt like it.And neither did he.Stalking over to the wall, he banged his fist against the plaster, causing it to tremor beneath each hit.John Andrew Malloy!he boomed, leaning toward the wall and pounding it again.Unless you want a fist to find its way through this wall and into your skull, I demand you desist using the name of a woman you arent even with!She choked on a laugh, dropping her hand to her side, and swung toward him.Shush!Hell hear you.He stepped away from the wall and adjusted his coat in riled agitation.I hope to God he does.That is vile.You shouldnt have to listen to that.And neither should I.   She groaned and yanked her apron up over her face and head, burying herself in it.If John comes over here, Ill up and die.If John comes over here, he is going to up and die.An anguished moan and one last Georgia ripped through the air.Everything soon lulled itself back into silence.Georgia quietly lingered before the doorless cupboard, her head still buried in her apron.Im never comin out knowin you heard that.She suffocated a giggle.Not ever, ever, ever.At least she had a sense of humor about it.You have to come out sometime.No, I dont.Knowing she was being silly, he edged toward the bolted door and, despite hearing nothing, said in a taunting voice, I hear footsteps.She whipped her apron down from her face and gawked at him in exasperation.You do not.No.But I got you out, did I not?He leaned against the bolted door and crossed his arms over his chest, trying to appear indifferent even though he was thoroughly agitated to know some man was yelling out her name in the throes of passion.How often does he do that to you?And why?She rolled her eyes, her smooth cheeks flushing.He has a bit of a fancy for me.A bit?He was saying your name.Oh, all right, more than a fancy.She glanced toward the wall and lowered her voice, pointing at him.This doesnt leave the room.Now, this he had to hear.I wont say a word.She heaved out a breath and waved toward the wall.John Andrew and this redhead from over on Anthony Street started seein each other about a month ago.I thought it was movin toward matrimony and was actually quite happy for him.Then I ran into the woman one mornin whilst gettin my yams, and she thanked me for the business I was givin her.I told her I most certainly didnt know what she was talkin about, and thats when she laughed and told me all about how John Andrew Malloy pays her fifty cents to ride her up the hole he shouldnt, all whilst callin her Georgia.She snorted.I about fainted.But better her than me, I say.Robinson drew in a ragged breath and let it out.He was going to slaughter this John Andrew Malloy.A door slammed in the distance beyond, making them both pause.Steady footfalls headed toward them from next door, followed by a knock that vibrated the bolted door he was still leaning against.Ey, Georgia!a man called from the other side.Open up.Her eyes widened as she slammed down a reprimanding foot.Drat you and that mouth, Robinson!She hurried toward him, shaking her head, and waved him away with both hands.Step aside before he chews my door to bits.I intend to chew him to bits.Pardon me.He whipped toward the door, his chest tightening as he undid the bolts.He was going to scatter the bastards innards across the entire length of the corridor.No.Georgia shoved him away from the door and swung a finger toward the shadowed wall where the lamp didnt reach.Step into the shadows and put your back against the wall.I dont want him seein your face.He squinted at her.Are you defending this man?No.Im defendin you.She lowered her voice to a whisper.John happens to be one of the boys.And the rule around here is not to stir the pot before youve had a chance to put anythin in it.You dont want him spreadin rumors and havin people hunt you down.Hes known for it.Now get in the shadows.He threw up both hands in exasperation and fell against the wall behind him with a thud.Dont say a word until I get rid of him.She pointed at him one last time as if that were going to keep him in place, then unbolted the door and swung it open.His brows rose a fraction at what came into view in the dim light just outside his shadowy hiding spot.A tall, shirtless youth who looked barely old enough to shave casually leaned against the doorway outside, his smooth, muscled chest and face glistening from the sheen of sex induced sweat.Wool trousers were crookedly affixed on those narrow hips and his two large feet were as bare as the day he was born.He edged in toward Georgia, long strands of blond hair falling into his eyes.Ive had a long day, Georgia.Dont make it longer by telling me what I can and cant do in me own low closet.Youre touched in the head, John.Touched.She tapped her forehead with a finger.I couldnt care less about what you do in your low closet.I just dont want to hear it.Youre bein overly stupid and loud.The edge of Johns mouth lifted.Just imagine how overly stupid and loud itd be if it were happening in your low closet?Georgia set her hands on her hips.Youd only snap at the first thrust, John.Theres barely enough of you as it is.Robinson bit back an exasperated laugh and shifted against the wall.She certainly knew how to serve up a good tongue.John paused.Is that Matthew?Was he the one up and banging on the wall like Fecky the Ninth?He pushed past Georgia, striding into the room, and jerked to a halt, scanning Robinson.His eyes widened as his sweat sleeked face flushed all the more.He glanced back over at Georgia.Whos this prick?And whats he doing in your room?Robinson narrowed his gaze and pushed away from the wall, ready to fist the runt back out into the corridor where he belonged.Back against the wall, Robinson, Georgia warned, pointing at him.And dont say a word.Gritting his teeth, Robinson fell back against the wall, but held the youths gaze, challenging him to come at him.John swiped his hair out of his eyes and leaned toward her, his bare chest rising and falling more steadily.Christ, Georgia.You cant be trusting men you dont know.Get rid of him.Before I do.Dont be playin all high and mighty, John, whilst youre playin with your whores loud enough for the whole buildin to hear.Georgia grabbed the youth by the arm, directing him to the open door.Ive been behind on the rent by a whole dollar forty five since my reticule was swiped and Im boardin him to make up for it, is all.So you neednt be jerkin your chin at me.I know what Im doin.She tried shoving him into the corridor.John yanked his arm away from her and spun back.Youre doing more than boarding him.He swiped a hand over his face.Youre fecking him for extra money to move west, arent you?She gasped.Im not feckin him!Like hell you arent.Robinson shook his head from side to side.Have a little more respect for the woman, he called out from up against the wall he was still sentenced to.And while youre at it, sir, put on a shirt lest you blind us all with your lack of refinement.Johns eyes widened.Smite me.Hes a fobbing Brit.Sir and all!Shoving past Georgia, John veered toward him and said through clenched teeth, Youd best leave lest I bloody you up well enough for your whore of a mother in England to feel it.Robinson pushed away from the wall, straightening to his full height of six feet four inches, towering well above the boy by a whole head and a half.Id like to see you try, little John.Get out!Lunging, John snapped out a clenched fist up toward his face.Robinson vaulted aside as Johns white knuckled fist smashed into the wall behind him, denting the plaster with a muffled thud that resounded within the room.John!Georgia grabbed John by the waist and dragged him back toward her.Enough.Enough!Robinson held out a strained hand in warning, even though what he really wanted to do was smash the boys skull into pieces.John swatted away Georgias hands from around his waist and veered back toward him, his lean chest rising and falling against impassioned breaths.No one makes a whore out of Georgia.No one.Especially not some prick of a Brit.Holding the youths gaze, Robinson removed his coat and tossed it toward the chair, readying himself for whatever was about to happen.The only one making a whore out of Georgia right now is you, John.I suggest you leave.Before she has to witness something she oughtnt.Georgia grabbed the youth by the arm with both hands and yanked him back, using her own body to maneuver his.As you can see, John, despite him bein a Brit, hes a gent who knows how to control his own two fists.Unlike you.Turning him back toward the door, she shoved him out into the corridor.Now get back to your girl.Shes not me girl, he tossed back, turning back toward her.Im only fecking her to keep meself sane, because living next to you on the hour is like living next to the Garden of Eden.Snakes and all!Dont you worry, this Eve is movin the entire garden west and soon.Good nightAdam.Slamming the door, she bolted all three locks.Georgia!The door rattled.Georgia, please dont do this.Ive got two dollars and thirty four cents saved up.Tis yours if you need it and I sure as hell wont ask for spit, in turn.Just dontdont feck him.Georgia hit the door with a hard, fast fist, rattling the door.Is that all you think Im good for?A bloody feck?Off with you, you knacker, before I tell Matthew to slice you up like custard pie and serve you to the locals!There was a mutter as footfalls faded.A door slammed.What a vile little maggot, Robinson drawled.Is feck what I think it is?Georgia turned and glared at him.If that were Matthew or any other man, you would have been dead by now.Dont think that because you stand well over six feet that you can talk back to these men.This isnt Broadway where people settle things with a bit of conversation.People here settle for blood.I want you to remember that the next time you mouth off.He shifted his jaw.He was disrespecting you and he was disrespecting me.Get used to it.Its called life.Sometimes, youve got to swallow your pride to ensure you dont die.She snatched up the lamp from off the table and disappeared into the adjoining room, momentarily leaving him in shadows.Robinson swiped an exhausted hand across his face and winced as his fingers scraped against his scab.Seething out a breath, he leaned against the wall.How old was that bastard, anyway?He looked rather young to be carrying on the way he did.Hes one and twenty, she called out from within the low closet.She unfolded yellowing linen and spread it onto the straw mattress, smoothing it out.Not nearly as young as you think.I was eighteen when I became a wife.He stared at her.You were rather young.Young?Dont be silly.Most girls marry younger to avoid fallin into the hands of a brothel, and unlike them, I actually married for love.And a fine love it was.She half nodded and turned away, her voice fading as she breathed out, Even if it didnt last.Leaning over, she quietly arranged and rearranged the linen on the bed as if not at all pleased with the way it was laying.He sensed she was actually doing it to avoid any further discussion pertaining to her marriage.He trailed a hand against the uneven plastered wall as he made his way toward her.So John is one of the boys?That he is.He can read and write now because of them.Little good reading and writing has done him.He appears to be deranged.She glanced back toward him, straightening.He serves his purpose, pays out his quota from his own weekly earnins and works on command durin political campaigns.Thats all the boys want and need.And though John sure as hell doesnt show it, for fear other men would snicker, he has a rather soft heart and is always helpin others.He was initiated into the group barely a year ago, after one of our boys was stabbed to death over at the docks.She huffed out a breath.What a mess that was.His brows rose.So you mean when one of them dies, they up and replace him with another?Dont you find that infinitely disturbing?Tis no different than a gents club over on Broadway losin a member and needin a new one.Ill have you know theres actually a sizable waitin list.Half the ward is forever complainin to Matthew and Coleman that they ought to make the group accommodate more men.Those two thievin banshees, however, consider any number beyond forty not only financially unmanageable, but unlucky.And why is that?Because theyre known as the Forty Thieves.Not the fifty six or the eighty two thieves.A sensation of odd familiarity trickled through him.He blinked, wondering why he already knew something about these men.Let us now leave Ali Baba to enjoy the commencement of his good fortune and return to the forty thieves.Wait.Wasnt that a story?One he knew and had read in youth?In a certain town of Persia lived two brothers, one of whom was named Cassim, the other Ali Baba.As their father, at his death, left them but little property, which they divided equally between them, it might have been expected that their fortunes would be the same; chance, however, ordered it otherwise.By God.It was indeed a story.Just as Robinson Crusoe had been.What the hell was wrong with him?The Forty Thieves?As inAli Baba and the forty thieves?Her face brightened.Yes.Do you know of it?Oddly enough, I do.Tis known as The Arabian Nights Entertainments.I must have read it.Because I know of it.The moment you mentioned the Forty Thieves, almost the entire story placed itself into my head.She paused.It did?He nodded.This sort of thing happened to me at the hospital, too.She searched his face for a long moment.Robinson Crusoe is a book.So is The Arabian Nights Entertainments.How veryodd.You appear to remember books.If you can remember some of the books youve read, I imagine youd be able to remember other things, too.Dont you think?He paused.I suppose.Dr.Carter mentioned you were confusin fiction for fact, which may mean that everythin you know about yourself isnt necessarily missin.It may be buried, is all.Buried?he drawled.Where?She shrugged.I dont know.Isnt it odd you keep rememberin things that werent there before?I recommend you spend a bit more time diggin around in that head of yours.You might be able to remember somethin of worth.He leaned forward.I have been digging, Georgia.Believe me, I have been digging for nine whole days, trying to make sense of it, but the shovel isnt large enough and the dirt is piled rather high.I have no understanding as to why my mind cant remember certain things.He drifted closer toward the doorway, blocking the entrance of the small room she was in.Let us set aside this talk.It only agitates me.I do, however, want to know more about these men who call themselves the Forty Thieves.Are they dangerous?Do they quarter people and deliver them into a cave full of treasure after a bit of Open, sesame?She gave him a withered look.Theres all sorts of black talk about who and what they are, and the boys merrily feed off it, but theyre not murderers, Brit.Theyre rebels of a low status lookin to lead a better life by providin one another the sort of things our government has failed to provide, given theyre nothin but Irish and Negro men.When Matthew and Raymond first came to Orange Street, they were set about creatin a group to shake a fist at the government and reorganize the chaos on the street.Though Raymond died before the group was fully established, Matthew and the boys have been shakin their fists in his honor ever since.Theyre all daft, if you ask me.Matthew thinks he can change the world, though he can barely feed himself.Rebels of low status rising against corrupted power?He didnt know why, but they sounded like his sort of people.The sort who wanted to rise above what little they had been given.Men who seek to change the world for the better ought to be admired, Georgia, not mocked.Oh, Im not mockin him or the others.Im only mockin the way they go about it.Matthew forever steals in order to maintain the expense it brings and its leechin his morals dry.Hes what I call a saint without a name or a halo.Id like to meet this Matthew of yours.Im rather intrigued by his agenda.Georgia captured his gaze.Intrigued?What in the name of Beelzebub do you think this is?A penny and a show?She made her way toward him, shaking her head.Youve no understandin of what its like to have your knuckles bleed in the name of poverty.Youve never had your face spit at and called black even though your skin is white.Men in this ward, Brit, be they Negro, Jew, Italian or Irish, join in on thievin, not because they want to, but because the world doesnt give them a chance to earn a sliver of their dignity.And just because you dont remember your pretty way of life over on Broadway, it doesnt mean youre suddenly one of us.Youd best remember that every time you get to talkin about bein intrigued.Robinson leaned against the frame of the doorway and leveled her with a firm gaze.Maybe my life wasnt quite as pretty as you think.Maybe I dont remember a goddamn thing about my life, Georgia, because there is absolutely nothing of worth to remember.She blinked rapidly.Dont say such things lest they come true.He glared at her, tensing.Does it matter what I say when you appear to be so intent on insulting me and a life I cannot even remember?She lowered her gaze, fingering the edge of her apron.Im sorry.I dont mean to be harsh, but Matthew and the boys are as Irish and Negro as they come, and I wanted to warn you of it before you go associatin with them.Theyll gladly take your money and the boots off your feet.Thats just how they are.And despite what you think, Im not one of them.She dropped her hand away from her apron and lifted her gaze to his.Im sorry I insulted you.Touched by her candor, he nodded.I am genuinely touched, madam, that you care enough to apologize.Thank you.She half smiled.There you go with that madam again.She wagged a playful finger.Youd best not be usin that around women.Oh?he chided gently.And why is that?Because every woman in the area will maul you for a chance to hear it.Theyre used to associatin with knights of the broom, hoe and shovel, not a gentleman with an impressive face and body to match.His lips trembled as he fought off a grin.You find my face and body impressive?Oh, now, dont let it go to your head.Tis a warnin to ensure you live into old age, is all.Men around here are monstrously territorial when it comes to their women.The wrong look at the wrong woman and youre dead.Try to remember that.He lifted a brow and thumbed toward the wall.That would explain John Andrew Malloy over there.Were you and he ever?She glanced off to the side and sighed.It didnt last.He wasnt lookin to go west and I wasnt lookin to be chained to a life full of babes here at the tenement.So I ended it before it got too serious and the poor sop hasnt recovered since.Jealousy hit hard as he realized she had probably done far more than kiss the man, given the bastards need to ride whores.The acrid sensation of grudging envy eerily whispered of something he knew all too well.Did it ever go beyond a kiss?She glared at him.I dont see how its any of your business.Considering I dodged a fist for you, I would say it is.How did you become involved with him and all of these men, anyway?Who are they to you?She untied the apron from around her waist and smacked it onto the bed.Raymond was one of the original founders, when they were still meetin over on Centre Street.By marryin Raymond, I married into their way of life, and when he died, I was left with Matthew and Coleman and a group of men who still think Im some queen bee in need of coddlin.Bastards.I cant wait to be rid of them.Robinson slowly crossed his arms over his chest and glanced down at the wood floor beneath his booted feet, feeling himself momentarily drift.That name.Coleman.Where did he know it from?Who is Coleman?Hes a dark, dark soul, that one.After Raymond died, both he and Matthew split all rights to the group and its been like that since.Mr.Coleman, your own papers are enough to condemn you.He glanced up, both brows popping up.How utterly bizarre.Edward Coleman is the name of an English Catholic courtier who had been hanged, drawn and quartered for treason in 1678.Though, obviously, given the year, it cannot be the same Coleman.Her eyes jumped up to study his face.You remember the oddest of things.If only you could remember somethin we could actually use.You know, like your full name and address?Even the name of your dog would be more helpful than you tossin out the name of some Catholic whos been dead since 1678.He couldnt help wondering if the only reason she wanted him to remember was so she could collect her money and be rid of him.I only hope you arent disillusioning yourself into thinking that my six dollars is going to buy you anything but disappointment.She squinted at him.Dont you be talkin down at me when all but earlier you were wantin my land and my apple trees.He set his chin, annoyance digging into him.Twas a momentary lapse in judgment I dont intend to replicate.Pff.Youre only irked because you know Im right.Now get into bed, already.Turning toward a cracked mirror on the wall behind her, she slid out pins from her hair.In a single sweep, that heavy mass of pretty, thick hair cascaded past her slim shoulders, swaying against her waist and backside.He edged back, resisting his own stupid urge to frantically peel away everything and get into bed with her.I probably shouldnt sleep with you, Georgia.She lowered her chin.Theres no need to overthink this, Robinson.Beds are used for sleep, too, you know.He shook his head.No.If I get into bed with you, sleep will be the last thing on my mind.That I know.Isnt there another place for me to sleep?She sighed.If you want to break your back and share the floor with the roaches, by all means.I dont care.I was tryin to be hospitable, is all.Roaches.Oh, that was not good.He knew what those were from his stay at the hospital and could already hear the sound of their wiry feet darting toward him.Ill sleep in a chair.She smirked.Well see how long that lasts, Mr.Silver Buttons.Theres a basin full of fresh water on the sideboard there in the front room if you need to wash up.Ive got extra chalk and a brush for your teeth, too.As for the privy, its in the back of the buildin.Now, good night, Brit.Good night, he called as he settled into his chair for a long night.He shifted against the rickety chair, paused and shifted again, unable to get comfortable.This was clearly going to be the beginning of hell.Tis the common wonder of all men, 						how among so many millions of faces, there should be none alike.Thomas Browne, Religio Medici 						(1642) ODD.Georgias eyes fluttered open, 						thinking shed heard her name in the distance.She scrambled up in bed, 						dragging the rough linen with her, and blinked, only to find everything was 						at a lull.Bright summer light peered in through the open doorway from the 						narrow windows of the front room beyond.Was it morning already?The entrance door outside the 						low closet suddenly jumped against its hinges, making her jump along with 						it.Georgia Emily!Matthew bellowed from the other side.Open the 						door.Now!Robinsons large frame stumbled 						out of the chair hed been sleeping in, his chest heaving from the 						unexpected assault on the silence.Glancing toward her through the open door 						of the low closet, he paused.You.Yes, me, she assured him, 						pushing aside the linen.You do remember me, I hope.All too well.Reaching down 						toward the chair, he grabbed up his coat and jerked it up and onto his arms 						and broad shoulders, covering his shirt and buttonless waistcoat.He glanced 						toward her, clearing his throat and smoothing his scattered black hair away 						from his face.A thundering crack echoed within 						the room as the door jumped against the bolts again.Georgia!Matthew 						boomed from the other side.Open the door!Robinson thumbed toward the 						door.I hope to God you arent letting him in.He doesnt sound 						friendly.She stifled a laugh and pulled 						her homespun nightdress down over her exposed legs, scooting out of bed.Hes not all that bad.She hurried out of the small room.The door jumped again against 						all three bolts.Georgia!I heard you the first time!she belted out, squeezing past Robinson.Robinson leaned back and snapped 						up both hands so as not to touch her.You should get dressed, he gruffly 						offered, glancing away.I can see your chemise and corset through that 						flimsy nightdress of yours.Tis only Matthew.Raymonds 						boy.I could walk around naked and that man still wouldnt look.Not that I 						would walk around naked.Im just sayin.Robinson pressed himself farther 						against the wall and looked up at the ceiling.Can you pass?She purposefully leaned in 						closer knowing their close proximity was flustering him.It was all too 						charming.This may be your only chance of seein all the goods, Brit.Revel 						in it.She caught the tip of her tongue with her teeth and playfully poked 						him in the chest.Stay where you are and dont mouth off, lest we have a repeat 						of yesterday.Scurrying over to the door in bare feet, she unbolted the 						latches and cracked it open.A booted foot shot out, giving 						her a jolt.Georgia jumped back as the door 						flew open and slammed against the wall, shaking her pots in the cupboard.Was that necessary given that I was already openin the door?Matthew loomed in the doorway, 						meeting her gaze with a single penetrating coal black eye.The faded brown 						leather patch that covered his blind eye had been crookedly affixed against 						his sun tinted chestnut hair as if hed barely remembered to put it on.His 						frayed linen shirt was still unlaced and he hadnt even bothered to tuck it 						into his wool trousers.Georgia held out a hand.Youre 						overreacting.You know John is still sore about me not takin him back, so I 						wouldnt believe a word of anythin he says.Matthew lowered his stubbled 						chin.If this British fop of yours didnt stay the night, then he has nothing 						to worry about, does he?He shoved past her and strode into the room.Glancing toward Robinson, he slowly shook his head.But he did stay the night.So 						hes dead.Reaching beneath his shirt, 						Matthew withdrew a pistol from the leather holster sitting on his hips and 						coolly leveled the pistol at Robinsons head.He cocked it.Step outside, 						Brit.I dont want to get blood all over the walls.Matthew!She jumped between him and Robinson, her pulse 						roaring, and pressed her body protectively against Robinsons frame, 						widening her stance.Do you remember the man who was hospitalized for 						tryin to reclaim my reticule?The one I told you about?Well, this be him.Im boardin him.He promised me six dollars if Id take him in for the 						month and you know I need the money if Im ever to move 					west.Matthew didnt bother to lower 						his pistol.Instead, he offered her a blunt, wry stare and angled the muzzle 						menacingly down at her.Six dollars for rent?When he can easily board 						himself down the street for three cents a day?Are you bloody yanking my 						cacks, Georgia?Hell, for six dollars, Id feck him and take him 					in.She narrowed her gaze, not in 						the least amused.Whether Im feckin him or not is neither your business 						nor Johns.She reached out and pushed the pistol away from her face in 						disgust.Look at you.Pointin a pistol at me like some Quaker on opium out 						to shoot himself a few Irish.Your father would spit upon your behavior if 						he saw this.I may be younger than you, Matthew, but Im still legally your 						mother and Im not afraid to take a crop to your head.So leave off.You 						hear?Leave off and never touch this man or point anythin at him again, or 						by Joseph, Ill feck him in front of you and John and all of Five Points just to 						shut everyone up!Silence pulsed within the 						room.Robinsons large hand pressed 						against the small of her back and curved possessively around the waist of 						her nightdress, making her heart pound.He dragged her back against the 						muscled heat of his body, as if hed been riled by raw pride.She drew in a shaky breath and 						let it out, trying not to focus on the fact that her entire backside was now 						draped against Robinsons entire front side.She reached back and gently 						pinched his muscled thigh through the smooth fabric of his trousers for 						being bold enough to actually grope her in front of Matthews still pointed 						pistol.Matthew sighed and lowered the 						gun.Whats his name?Robinson Crusoe, she 						obliged.Matthew arched a brow.His name 						is Robinson Crusoe?He snorted dismissively.Lest you forget, 						Mum, I grew 						up with personal tutors and read the damn book in its entirety at an age 						when you were barely crawling.Whats his real name?She sighed.He doesnt know his 						name, Matthew, and hasnt been able to remember much of anythin since he 						awoke in the hospital.Dr.Carter is tryin to locate his family, and Im 						givin him a place to stay and watchin over him.Matthew squinted at her with his 						visible eye, the patch shifting against his cheekbone.The devil, you say.He cant remember his own born name?No, he cant, she insisted.Dr.Carter calls it memory loss.Memory loss?What the hell is 						that?I dont know!He just cant 						remember things.Matthew squinted at her again.Can he at least talk?Or did he conveniently forget that, 					too?I can talk, Mr.Milton, 						Robinson interjected in a chiding tone.And despite your doubts pertaining 						to my condition, I assure you, tis extremely inconvenient being in my own 						head.I suggest you put the pistol away.Matthew popped up the pistol and 						pointed it at Robinsons head on an angle.I dont do soft merely because a 						man asks me to.Georgia might not have a reputation to uphold, but 						I 						do.Georgia jumped forward at the 						insult, snapping up a rigid fist.Youre about to get cropped!Robinson swept out a quick hand, 						forcing her back and away from Matthew with the length of his muscled arm.Mr.Milton.Georgia mentioned that you may be in need of funds.I would be 						more than willing to provide a monetary contribution to bring an end to this 						hostility.Georgia lowered her fist and 						glanced up at Robinson, who intently stared Matthew down, clearly not 						intimidated by the pistol pointed at his head.Bravo.It would appear Robinson was far savvier than shed thought.Matthew, 						after all, was a walking almshouse willing to set aside everything in the name 						of money.Matthew lowered his pistol.Consider me a friend the moment your generosity touches this hand, 						Mr.Crusoe.Uncocking the pistol with a swift movement, he tucked it back into the 						leather holster on his hip, burying it beneath his untucked shirt.Matthew 						swiped his palm against the thigh of his trousers, reached out and shook 						Robinsons hand.Ive never willingly shook a Brits paw before, but Im a 						man of business first and foremost and providing for my boys is my 					business.Matthew adjusted his faded 						leather patch the way he always did when excited about something and 						casually inquired, Exactly how much money are we talking here?I need 						clothes, boots, food, maps, parchments, ink, wax, quills and books.And 						thats just the short list.Whilst Coleman teaches our men how to better 						fight, I teach them how to read and write so they can fully understand their 						rights as is scribed in the United States Constitution.Because my motto is 						what my fathers wasmuscle is of little worth if there is no thought behind 						it.That is how and why Ali Baba dismantled all forty thieves and that is 						why we call ourselves such.Robinson let out a whistle.That is 						not at all what I expected from a group of gallivanting thieves.Matthew inclined his head.We 						only steal when we have to.Which, sadly, is most of the time, given the 						expense of maintaining and educating forty men.Gesturing toward the wall, 						Matthew shook his head.John over there is still at the level of reading that 						would shame a bogtrotter and cant write legibly for shite.I told him just 						this morn, when he pranced over huffing about you and Georgia, that until 						hes at a respectable level of education, no woman will respect him.Especially 						Georgia here, who was mentored by my own father.I was barely twenty when I 						first met her.She was naught more than a scrap he took in after finding her 						asleep in his coal bin, looking like the dirty angel she still is.At the 						time, she didnt even know what the hell a quill was for.Now look at her.She outreads me, outwrites me, outwits me and even finds the men around 						these parts to be so damn stupid, shes heading out west.Robinson paused and glanced over 						at her, capturing her gaze.His gray eyes simmered with genuine admiration.I find her to be utterly remarkable, he admitted huskily.Her pulse skipped.Averting his gaze to Matthew, 						Robinson casually remarked, Thievery and pistols aside, Mr.Milton, I 						admire that you seek to educate these men.Without an education, they cant 						think for themselves, let alone rise above circumstance.Matthew reached out and thumped 						him on the back.I can see why John was all nettles about you.
