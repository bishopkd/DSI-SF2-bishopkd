Victoria asked, and Luc smiled at her scowl.Is that such a bad idea?Yes!She makes me happy, he said with a helpless shrug.And I havent been happy in a long time.Whats the difference between her and Dennis?He blinked, stunned.Shes not using me for money.Can you be sure of that?Yes.He was unequivocal.He knew Tara Jean, the best and worst of her, and she wasnt after his money.As sure as I am that Denniss motives are not as pure.Pure, she scoffed.I dont think thats a word that applies to Tara Jean.Stop, he demanded.Right now, Victoria.I like her.A lot.And you dont have to approve, but you sure as hell can keep your mouth shut about her.Youre picking her over your family?Oh my God, Vicks No.Fine.I get it.Go.Screw whats left of your brains out.Victoria turned back to the house, slamming the front door shut behind her.He turned on his mother.How about you, you have a problem with Tara Jean?You could do worse for yourself, Celeste murmured.He watched her, waiting for the shoe to drop, but she was silent.You approve of Tara Jean Sweet?Who am I to approve?I would say She lifted that shoulder and he, thirty seven years old, still couldnt always read those shrugs.Either she was about to lie or about to tell him she was hungry.I can appreciate your interest.Your father was like her.She lifted her hand, forestalling the argument that leapt to his lips.Now, dont get your back up.He was wild.And different.Like an untamed animal in a room full of domesticated dogs.And he made me feelalive.Thats exactly how she makes me feel.She touched his hand, kissed his forehead.But dont use her to fill the hole hockey has left in your life.Her shrewd eyes saw right through him.She deserves better than that.It was hours later when he got off the phone with Beckett and his coaches and teammates, and there was one niggling problem left to deal with.He shut the door to his bedroom and called Thiele.The phone rang once before the private investigator answered.Thiele.Hes back, Luc said, staring out his window at the moonscape.Dennis Murphy is back.We heard, Thiele said.Ive got my feelers out, but Murphy is staying low.No credit cards.No cell phone.What does that mean?It means its going to take longer to find him.Luc paced away from the window, his tennis shoes squeaking against the hardwood floor.I need Im on it, Luc.Dont worry.He hung up.Dont worry.He could hit a hundred mile an hour slap shot.Out sprint a man half his age.Lead his team to the finals.He could even walk away from the sport that defined him.Take care of his family.Make love in the backseat of an SUV to Tara Jean Sweet.But not worrying was impossible.Like tearing out his own throat.Luc?The soft voice accompanied a scratch at the door, and he turned in time to see Tara Jean slipping through the cracked door to his bedroom.The lamplight fell over her face in a golden veil, obscuring and highlighting her beauty.And he knew in a heartbeat that this woman was no substitute for hockey.She was an entity all her own.And hed never had a person in his life like her.That she was here, now, when he most needed someone like her, was just his good fortune.Hey!He had no interest in pretending not to be happy to see her.She brought parts of him, long dead, long forgotten, back to tingling lifeand he couldnt play that cool.His smile split his face.You all right?she asked.Great.What are you doing?Well.The door shut behind her with a soft click and he realized she wore a highly unlikely leather duster with red feathers at the neck.She looked like a beautiful bird.I was worried you might be sad.Again.Her fingers slipped along those feathers, her smile as seductive as Eves, and his body, as his brain got wise, got hard in a heartbeat.I am feeling a little blue.He closed the curtains with a hard snap.Whatswhats happening under that coat?This old thing?She shrugged.Not much.The coat fell to the ground with a soft thud.She wasnt naked, but she sure as hell wasnt decent.White leather cupped her curves, molded to her waist.Thigh high white stockings clung to her superior legs.Her sex was barely covered by a white leather thong that couldnt be comfortable, but he sure as hell appreciated her sacrifice.He could love her, he realized as she prowled toward him, her high heels clicking against the dark floor.He touched her shoulder with the tips of his fingers, the satin of her skin transforming him from a broken down hockey player into something better.Something real.A man.With a woman.A family to protect.A future to care for.Grateful, reverent, and endlessly worried, he pulled her into his arms and attempted to show her the glory she made him feel.The phone call from Dennis on Monday afternoon came as a surprise.Staring down at his number on her cell phone display, Victorias emotions werent easy to label; it was like looking at a kids finger painting.A big brown mess, with red and purple highlights of anger and pleasure.She glanced up the long empty hallway of the elementary school she was checking out for Jacob.No one was around to watch her do something even she knew she shouldnt do.Hello?she said, pleased when she didnt sound too excited or too angry.It was the perfect mix, as if shed forgotten who Dennis Murphy was and why he would be calling.Victoria.His voice, on the other hand, was the sort youd use with a confidant.A friend.Long lost but beloved.And it was like hitting ice, making her skid.She didnt have any friends.Not anymore.No one had said her name like that in a long time.How are you?She cleared her throat and stared into the trophy display case across the hallway.The sixth graders at Bruce Elementary School had had quite a cross country winning streak.Im fine, she answered.You?Good.Great, actually.Im so sorry about the way I had to leave Friday night.Look, Dennis, Im not sure this is going to work.My ex husband was career focused and Im not going to go down that road again.Victoria, please, lets not do this over the phone.Meet meyou can dump me to my face.It was a joke, sweet and unexpected, and she actually smiled despite her misgivings.Friday night.Sorry, Jacob has book club.Book club?For seven year olds?She sat up straighter in the kids red molded plastic chair she was wedged into.Were reading Harry Potter and its been very enjoyable.Fine.Friday afternoon.Dont, she told herself.Dont do this to yourself again.But then she thought of her brother, of that light that seemed to suffuse his being.Because he was having sex.Having sex with someone totally inappropriate.Someone who was risky.Why was Luc the only one who got to be brave?To throw his heart around the gutter just for the hell of it?Dennis made her happy.Made her smile.Wasnt that worth something?Okay, she agreed, feeling like shed been holding her breath.I can meet you at three.At the bar in the Four Seasons?No.No, Im not staying there.Where are How about the Applebees on Westwood.Applebees?Goodness.Talk about slumming.Okay.She hung up her cell phone, feeling like a woman with a secret.Something delicious and naughty.A dangerous lover.A date at a third rate restaurant chain.She hardly recognized herself right now.And she liked that.She liked that a lot.Luc rolled over and before his hand touched the cold sheets where Taras warm body should have been, he knew she was gone.Middle of the night, middle of the day, first thing in the morning, it hardly seemed to matter.Over the last few days, whenever he fell asleep, she slipped out of his bed, like a ghost.It was getting hard not to take this shit personally.And he couldnt stop falling asleep.It was as though his body knew its work was over and it had gone on holiday.He took naps.Every day.Sometimes twice, depending on how often he could get Tara alone.Hed expected a lot of things when he started thisrelationship with her.But not this.She let him past all her walls, only to put up giant fences to keep him out.She locked herself in her damn workshop all day and night.He understood that the Nordstrom deal was tomorrow and she needed to be ready, but that boot had been designed years ago, and thismanic behavior told him something else was going on.It didnt take a genius to see what she was doing, keeping him at arms length.And it wasnt just sneaking out of his bed.She found every reason not to spend time with him, unless that time was spent naked.Or sort of naked.Hed ask her to dinner and shed take off her shirt.This afternoon hed suggested she go skating with him and Jacob, watch a peewee game.Shed lifted her skirt to show him that smiley face underwear he just couldnt resist.He stared up at the shadows growing long across the ceiling.She closed her eyes when they kissed, didnt look at him when she came.Loving her hurt.And maybe if he knew she didnt feel something, if he was sure that this was just sex, it might hurt less.But she wouldnt keep him out if she wasnt scared.If she wasnt protecting something.And that, in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, gave him some hope.Forcing his lazy body into movement, he threw off the sheets.He needed to make a few phone calls but then hed go find Tara, and, if he had to, force his way into her life.27 The demon was gone.Thursday night before the Nordstrom meeting and her muse was nowhere to be found.Wasnt that a bitch?And while the meeting was about the boots, shed hoped to have a few new designs to show off at the same time.But the paper in front of her was still blank and her head was still quiet.The blame was obviously Lucs.Despite her every single effort to keep him at arms length, less than a week with the man and shed been screwed silly.Screwed happy, really.And the demon wasnt a big fan of happy.It wasnt her natural habitat.But Tara found herself reluctant to give it up.The door to the workshop opened and the shadows rippled around her desk as Luc walked in.Her heart stirred, leapt in reaction like an untrained dog.There was some kind of metamorphosis happening.A transformation.And she had to wonder what kind of butterfly was going to emerge from a cocoon so ugly.You still working?The meeting is tomorrow; I was hoping to have a few new designs.She sighed and stared down at the empty paper.But I dont have any ideas.Maybe you need a break.He touched her hair, his fingers combing through the curls, and sparks of pleasure littered her body.Yeah, my last break took half the afternoon.I think part of the reason I cant work is someone keeps taking me back to bed.If I remember correctly, that break was your idea.I wanted to take you skating.And right now I was just thinking about getting some dinner.Feed the muse.Her laugh was dry.Little did he know the muse ate conflict and anger and resentment.I think I should try to get something done.You getting nervous?About tomorrow?Getting?She laughed and shook her head.Ive been nervous since the meeting was arranged.He sat on the stool across from her desk, his face cut in half by shadow, and she couldnt see his eyes.But there was something about his stillness that had nothing to do with relaxation.The man was poised for something and she didnt know what.How about if I went with you?His words fell into a vast empty well.And from the bottom of the well, finally, the demon spoke up.Who the hell does he think he is?I dont need you to hold my hand.Thats not what Im saying.I just thoughtyou knowas CEO You said you didnt care about this company.Resentment radiated to her fingers, to the tips of her hair, and the demon reached full power.This is ours!the demon cried.Ours.No one elses.I care about you.If youre bored, find a different hobby, Luc.This is my business.Whoa, whoa.He held out his hands as if warding off an attack.I just want to share something with you besides bodily fluids.I thought it might be fun.Working with you.She stood up.I dont work well with others.Okay.He stood too and walked around the desk and as he approached, the smell and heat of him turned the edge of her temper to mush.This was the mans effect on her.She couldnt keep herself straight anymore.There was a good chance if he touched her, shed say yes.Shed say yes, come to this meeting, take away whats mine, just because youre bored and Im here and Im falling in love with you.Funny how she thought sex with Luc would be safe.This man could bring down her life like no one else.Why are you pushing me away, Tara?Instead of answering him, she kissed him.Launched herself against his chest, fitted every aching part of her body against the relief of his.He lifted her against him with one hand and cupped her chin with the other, pulling her away, and she saw cold anger in his eyes.You wont let me be a part of your work, or your life, but youll fuck me, is that it?She panted, licked his lips.Something like that.Fine.He put her down and spun her, pushing her up against the drafting table, the edge of it biting into her stomach.Fear gave lust a new color, something black.Luc was always in control, always a gentleman.But this man pushing her over the edge of the table felt dangerously, decidedly, out of control.Her body went wet in a heartbeat.You like it this way, dont you?he breathed in her ear, his hands roughly cupping her breasts.His fingers found the hard ridge of her nipples and pulled.Too much.Too much.She whimpered and pushed her ass against him, urging him on, wanting this so badly, so suddenly she couldnt breathe.You dont have to look at me, do you?He bit the side of her neck and she whimpered, standing up on her tiptoes, trying to feel him along her spine but he tipped her over, putting distance where she didnt want it, controlling her like a woman on a string.His hands slid down the top of her shirt, ripping a button off, gripping her breast while his erection pulsed against her ass.Tell me, he whispered in her ear before using his teeth against her.Whwhat?Tell me, Yes Luc, I like it this way.I like it His hand ran under her skirt to the aching wet heat between her legs.There was no soft touch, no careful teasing.His fingers sunk deep and she cried out as the giant wave of orgasm began to lift her right out of her body.What were you saying?She would have smiled if she were able.She would have laughed, she would have turned around and kissed him with all of her heart if shed been able to do anything but stand there and shake, riding his fingers.Luc His fingers slid out of her body and she cried out, pushing herself against him, trying to find him, to lure him back.Its simple, Tara.If you say, Yes Luc, I like it this way, youll get rewarded.She groaned, spreading her legs slightly, pushing against him, trying to make him break, trying to get him inside her.Ah, he laughed in her ear.You know your reward, dont you?You want it.Come on, Luc.That orgasm growing so big, the best orgasm ever, was just out of reach.With both hands he lifted her skirt up over her ass, running those callused fingers over the naked curves, the lace edge of her thong.Oh God, yes, she thought, listening for the unzip of his zipper, waiting for the thick blunt edge of his dick.Thats not right, Tara.He spanked her, the flat of his hand against the top edge of her ass, and she cried out in surprise, jerking away from him.What the hell, Luc?She didnt get far with his strong arms around her, and as the sting faded, she found herself burning even hotter.Her mind wasted with lust.Please What did I ask you to say, Tara?She closed her eyes and pushed her head back against his shoulder, her hand reaching between them to cup him.Yes, Luc, I like it like this.The sound of his zipper was loud in the silence.The tearing of the condom package echoed through her body.Hurry, she gasped, leaning forward against the table.And then he was there, so hard, so high, she could feel him in the back of her throat.There was no way she could keep him at arms length now.Not when hed just touched her heart.It didnt work.She was farther away than ever.The chill in his gut turned the sweat on his body to ice.Picking her way through the shadows, gathering up her clothes and clutching them to her chest, she looked like a thief.Someone hed never met before.That sex had turned them into strangers.You should get dressed, she said, zipping up her skirt.He leaned up on one elbow, muscles and shadows coiling over him like living animals.I feel like maybe you should put some money on the table before you go.This isnt any different than any other time weve had sex.He pushed a hand over his face, through his hair.He had nothing left now, just the truth, and he wasnt holding out a lot of hope that was going to work.But what the hell, he had a couple of seconds left on the clock on an empty net.Coming home from the hospital.That was different.It was.Her great unguarded moment.Before she called out the dogs.No, it wasnt, you just want to believe otherwise.I told you not to make this into something more.None of this is real, Luc.Even my name is fake.I made it up.I made up all of this and youve just forgotten that.Halfway through her little speech, he stood and started getting dressed as if the clothes were trying to rob him.He shoved his legs through his pants, ripped a button on his shirt in his haste.Listen to yourself.Youre making a life, Tara.Building something.Just because its yours doesnt mean its bad.Or false.Or any less real than someone elses life.She stared at him, that blank look he knew meant she was absorbing something, testing its weight before tossing it back in his face.Before taking a sledgehammer to what was left of his heart.I think its best if we just end this now, dont you?Before anyone gets hurt.Now he was just getting pissed.I can see through your bullshit, Tara.Youre not fooling me with this tough girl act.You want to walk away, fine.Walk away, but be honest with me.I deserve that much.Youre going to get off this ranch, Luc, and youre going to get back to your life and youre going to realize this She lifted her hand, waved it between them as if she could encompass all that had happened the last week.The hospital and the secrets theyd whispered into and across each others skin.This wasnt real.Im a substitute for hockey.And a pretty bad one at that.Im nothing to build a life with.Give me some credit, Tara.Im not a child.I know the difference between hockey and love.The word shattered the room and she stepped back, leaning against her desk, his eyes pinning her there, daring her to move.Daring her to look away.I love you, Tara Jean.There it was.His endgame.There was nothing after this and he watched her, his heart folding itself into origami.Once, as a girl, shed fallen off the top of a swing set and shed lain there, the small pebbles of the playground digging into her cheek, gasping and sucking air like a fish in the bottom of a boat.This moment felt like that.You should leave, she finally said.You should go now.Get off this ranch before you lose any more of your mind.I cant get off the ranch.And even if I could, I wouldnt.Not without you.The will.He was stuck here for his sisters sake for four more months.Four more months.She couldnt do it.She couldnt stay here with him and his love that wasnt real.She wasnt strong enough to resist him.And shed fall.Hard.And then when the four months were over and he went on his way, shed be destroyed.Ruined.She stood still at the edge of a decision shed made a thousand times in the past.It was harder this time, because what she was turning away was so precious.So rare.But in the end, the old habits reached up out of her past to support her, and it wasnt all that hard to just turn her head away from what she wanted.You can take care of Victoria?she asked.Jacob?In case Dennis comes back around?She had every intention of making sure that didnt happen, but Luc would be a good backup plan.He stepped toward her, her arms in his hands before she could flinch away.She bit back a gasp at his touch, the heat of him.Whats going on in that head of yours, Tara?I cant Im going to leave.What?Why?Because that is what I do, Luc.I leave.What about the Nordstrom deal?If youre so interested, you go to the meeting.She reached behind her and grabbed the sketch of the boot, that symbol of all the financial freedom shed always wanted.But the truth was, no financial freedom was worth the pain love inevitably brought.What about Dennis?I have that protection order.Dont do this, Tara.I love you.You.All of you.Dont be an idiot, Luc, she snapped.You barely know me.Then tell me, Tara.Right now.Tell me what it is I dont know about you.What is so unloveable about you, and you let me be the judge of whether or not my feelings are real.Trust me that much.I should just go.Yeah, and Ill just follow you, Tara.Screw the will and my sister.I want you.I want to be with you and if you dont want to be with me, you need to tell me why, and enough of this bullshit about hockey.She met his eyes and steeled herself.She was always the instrument of her own downfallthis would be no different.When I was a kid, before I conned that first old man Mr.Beanfang.That he remembered was somehow sweet.As if hed memorized her poisonous song, unaware that it was going to poison him too.I was fifteen and mad at my mom because she kept bringing these assholes into our lives and they ruinedthey ruined everything.And Granthe liked me.My mom knew it.And she didnt do anything.Ever.She looked the other way, told me I was imagining things.That I was jealous.That I was a spoiled brat who didnt want her to be happy.But she knew it was the truth.So on my sixteenth birthdayI didnt say no.Oh my God It wasnt what I expected.It wasnt sexy.Or fun.It didnt make me a grown up.And then my mother, when I told her, when I came to her crying and bleedingshe kicked me out of the house.No money.No clothes.No car.Nothing.I slept at a friends house for a few nights, but thenthen I met Dennis.Sweetheart, Tara.His hands ran over her face like a river, like water trying to change the shape of the stones in its banks.You were a kid.And your motheryour mother should have protected you.But I hurt her, dont you get it?I loved her and I hurt her.She loved me and she betrayed me.Your father loved you and look how he treated you.Look at what Victorias husband did to her.Thats love, Lucits handing someone the knife to stab you in the back.She shook her head, stepping backward toward the door.You want me to love you, but all I ever do is hurt people.And you might think you love me, but you dont.No one ever has.She turned and opened the door but he shut it again, his hand on the wood in front of her face.Dont give up like this, Tara, he breathed, his head pressed into the back of hers, a weight that would drown her if she let it.Dont walk out that door.We can talk He wouldnt let her leave, so she would have to make him be the one to walk away.Talk?she asked, hating him.Hating herself.Thats not what we do, Luc.She took off her shirt, one button at a time.Her breasts without the bra glowed in the moonlight.It took him a second to realize what she was doing and he looked up in her eyes.Naked love and disappointment fought there.Dont do this, he whispered.She ignored both and shrugged out of the shirt.The air was cold, his gaze colder, as disappointment and love were eaten by anger.Come on, Luc.She leaned back against the desk.Maybe I can still earn that bonus.Ive got tricks I havent even He bent, grabbed her shirt, and shot it at her chest.Her reflexes caught it.Get dressed, he said.And go, if thats what you want.But I wont be a part of your punishment, or whatever this is.I love you too much.The door slammed shut behind him and she slipped the shirt up over her shoulders and started to button it, but her hands were shaking too hard.And then her legs were shaking and the boots couldnt keep her up anymore.She slid to the ground, a sob breaking through her chest, right through her ribs.This was what she needed to do.And because it hurt, she knew it was right.The next morning, the demon was back, but worse.Worse than ever.And the voiceshe realized now, the voice wasnt her mothers.It was hers.And Tara Jean, battered and bruised, didnt have the capacity to fight.Didnt even know why she should.Why she should try to be anything but what she was.Getting into the black leather pants took an act of physics and athleticism not unlike the pole vault.The boots laced up the back, up to her knee, and the heel was red and three inches high.The thin white sweater seemed demure until she put it on, winding the long, gauzy tails around her waist over and over again until she looked like a good girl dominatrix.From under her sink she dug out her hot rollers, putting her hair up into big floppy curls, then she lacquered them with a pound of hair spray.Scrunching and spraying until she looked like a monument to big hair.A monument to Texas femininity.She finished it off with the holy trinity: red lipstick, black eyeliner, and big hoops.On the countertop her cell phone buzzed.Just as it had ten minutes ago.She didnt have to look at the display to know it was Claire Hughes.She was now a half hour late for that meeting.And the pain, the pain was almost gone.Her head ached and burned where Luc had pressed his forehead to it last night.Her flesh remembered the touch of his hand.The way his skin looked like liquid gold, felt like silk, tasted like salt and sugar under her lips.But slowly, bit by bit, staring at her cold eyes in the mirror, she convinced herself that it was all a dream.And it was over.She willed the woman in the mirror to believe it, to turn her heart to stone, her mind to a sharp blade, cutting out the tenderness, the sweetness, the heat and furyevery single memory and emotion attached to Luc Baker.Until they lay in ribbons, broken and bleeding, all attachment to her gone.Leaning toward the mirror, she ran a finger around the edge of her lips.This wasnt a mistakethe clothes, the hair, the stone cold look in her eyes.This was Tara Jean Sweet.Victoria tried not to feel assaulted by the ambiance of Applebees.Honestly, between the music (far too loud) and the kids screaming (totally unchecked), it was like being slapped in the face with noise.Table for one?a young woman asked, her brown hair pulled back in a sloppy ponytail, the enthusiasm faked.She had a button on her shirt asking people to ask her how much she loved it here.Victoria had the feeling that if she were to ask, the girl might cry.ImIm ah She looked over the womans shoulder and saw a familiar gray suit jacket on a man at the bar.The curve of his shoulders, however, was not so familiar.Dejected, those shoulders said.And all the excitement shed had for this illicit date fizzled.I dont want to play cheerleader tonight, she thought with a heavy sigh.Shed done enough of that in her marriage.It was the one aspect of being a widow that she was beginning to enjoynot having to be responsible for some fragile mans mood.But perhaps she was wrong.Perhaps those shoulders did not say dejected.Perhaps they said slight shoulder injury from an intense squash game.Yes, she liked that much better.Though, frankly, she wasnt all that interested in hearing the play by play of a squash game.Shed had enough of that, too.Frankly, she just wanted to flirt.To feel pretty, maybe even sexy.She had in fact worn her tightest jeans, the dark wash, with her gold sandals.And shed left her hair down, pleased with how it had stopped falling out now that she was away from New York and Toronto.The stress of her life.Really, all she wanted was to make out in the parking lot.Was that too much to ask from an illicit afternoon date at Applebees?No.It wasnt.She had the feeling it happened all the time.She stepped up to the bar, to Denniss shoulder, expecting him to turn to her with a wide smile, but he didnt.He slowly drained the last of the beer from a big pint glass.Dennis?she said, and finally he turned.Her heart folded up shop and closed for the night at the sight of him.Disheveled.Unshaven.His eyes were dark and bloodshot.He smelled of a two day bender.She reeled back.Hey now, princess, how are you?The princess rankled.It really did, but she managed to smile.You all right?she asked.Why wouldnt I be?His voice lost its happy drunk effect and seemed mean.Toward her.You dont look so good.Well.His eyes were shrewd, malicious, and this was a side of him shed never seen.It made her clutch her purse a little closer.I think you can blame that little fact on your brother.My brother?I cant prove it, of course, because your brother is slick like that, but he hired people to get me out of town.To scare me away from you.Dont be ridiculous.Dont be a bitch, he moaned, and she snapped back, slipping her purse strap over her shoulder.Shed been called enough names to last a lifetime.And Dennis Murphy was clearly not the man shed hoped he was.Without another word she turned on the heel of her little gold sandals, which frankly, now that she thought about it, looked cheap and awful, and headed back to the hostess station, the front door, and the wide world beyond.She heard a mumble and a crash and she could feel him behind her, a few steps.You all right?the hostess asked as she passed, and Victoria managed to give the woman a reassuring smile as she hit the doors and the heat of the parking lot.She was halfway to her car before Dennis caught up to her, grabbing the inside of her elbow and spinning her around so hard she nearly fell.Do not touch me!she hissed, all that anger shed swallowed rising up like a suppressed indigenous tribe, with arrows and rocks and hate.Listen, Victoria.She wondered how she ever could have thought him handsome.He was hideous.She jerked her arm, but he held on so hard shed have bruises.I need you to walk back in there and sit down with me.You need to tell your brother to leave me the fuck alone.Not on your life.Im not interested in dating you, Dennis.Not anymore.Dating?he howled.You think were dating?You stupid little rich girl.I wouldnt date you if you were the last pair of tits on the planet.Her blood roaring in her ears, embarrassment and anger giving her superhero strength, she tore away from him, her arm stinging, her hand numb, and she turned and ran for her car, fumbling with her keys, tears of anger and fear burning in her eyes.Wrong.So wrong.Again.Her chest heaving, she tried to get her keys in the door but her hands were shaking and suddenly he was there, batting the keys to the ground, grabbing her purse.I need money.I dont have any, she snapped, pulling her purse back.Please, you think I believe that crap about you giving all the money back to the people your husband fleeced?He was rifling through her stuff, tossing things onto the cement like they were garbage, a package of Kleenex, her sunglasses, Jacobs school picture.Give me that, you asshole!she yelled, jerking the purse.But Dennis barely even looked up.With the assurance of a man with too much practice, he lifted one hand and cuffed her so hard she fell back against the car, her ears ringing.Gasping, she tasted blood and carefully crouched, picking up her keys.Shed leave the purse, along with what was left of her dignity and pride, on the asphalt with her Kleenex.She just needed to get out of there.In the distance a siren wailed, the sound so jarring she dropped her keys again.Dennis looked up, like a wild dog sensing trouble, and Victoria saw the hostess standing in front of the doors, her hand shielding her eyes.I called the cops!she cried, and Dennis mumbled something under his breath, digging out the little bit of cash she had in her purse.Victorias vision went red, her body numb with shock and adrenaline, and she didnt even feel herself doing it, didnt even know she was going to, before she put her hands on his shoulders.He shrugged, looking up at her ready to spit more hate, more poison on her already poisoned face, but before he could do it, she brought up her knee, bony as all get out, and drove it right into the soft, gooey center of his testicles.He went blue, then red, gasping for air.The purse fell to her feet, and his body toppled soon after.In the distance the sirens were getting closer and the hostess was cheering and for a moment, the sight of Dennis Murphy brought to the ground by her was so delicious she lifted a hand.Took a little bow.But she had no intention of talking to the cops, of explaining what she was doing here in her gold sandals with her hair down, with a disgusting pig like Dennis Murphy.With hands as steady as a surgeons, she picked up the crumpled dollar bills that had fallen from Denniss fingers.Her sons picture went into her back pocket.Like a ballast for a ship, the picture kept her steady.Come near me again and Ill have you arrested, she said, cool and calm, as imperial as she ever was without even trying.She smiled into his sweating, wheezing face, wondering how in the world hoofing this man in the balls had made her feel better than she had in a year.Really, she thought, sliding behind the wheel of her car, starting it up and carefully stopping at the stop sign at the edge of the parking lot, before leaving the scene of a crime.I should have kicked a man in the balls years ago.28 Luc crouched in front of Jacob and pulled on the skates laces.The familiar smells of the arena failed to make him feel better about the shit storm his life had turned into.Celeste had called an hour ago telling him that Tara Jean had left the ranch.Up until that moment, he hadnt really believed that she would do it.She looked like a hooker, Celeste added.Mom Hed sighed, flinching on Taras behalf at the word choice.Fine.Call girl.Whats going on here, Luc?Shes leaving, Mom.Shes Scared.Broken.Leaving.Im so sorry, honey.Me too, Mom.So now, he had no career.No Tara.But the arena was still here.Home in a way that nothing else ever was.Too tight?he asked his nephew.Can you wiggle your foot?Jacob nodded, his face set on perma beam.Victoria had called Luc an hour ago, asking him to pick Jacob up from the rec center.Shed gotten held up somewhere and was running late.The second Jacob saw Luc he asked if they were going to go skating.And frankly, Luc couldnt think of a better reason to step past the parasites demanding a statement he wasnt quite ready to give and back into the arena.Tie them super tight, Uncle Luc, Jacob said.I go really fast when theyre tight.Luc smiled despite the hole in his chest.Luc?a mans voice asked, and Luc stood from the crouch, his head spinning slightly at the change in altitude.He turned and found Randy Jenkins, looking gray and stone faced.Tyler stood behind him barely holding back tears.Go on out, Luc said to Jacob, helping his nephew onto his feet.Billys waiting for you.He watched Jacob, one hand on the wall as he hobbled across the mats toward the ice.Luc took a deep breath, preparing himself for the unknown, and turned around only to see Randy step back while Tyler stepped forward.For a moment, Luc wanted to lay the kid out.Payment, perhaps, or to teach the guy a lesson.He wasnt sure which.All he knew was that this kid was part of the end of his career and while he couldnt fight the headaches or the doctors or the reality of his situation, it would feel good to take out his losses on the short tempered player in front of him.Im so sorry, Tyler breathed, looking at his shoes while tears ran sideways out of the corner of his eyes.I didnt think youd go down like that.I didnt know you had a head injury.I didnt mean It was a cheap shot.Luc bit out the words and the kid just nodded.Look at me, he demanded, and Tyler finally lifted red rimmed eyes.Use the words, Tyler.Be a man.Itit was a cheap shot.You want to be a professional?Tyler stared blankly at him.Do you?Tyler swallowed.Yes.Then its time to grow up.Learn to control yourself out on the ice.Your temper.Your anger.All of it.Lock it down.Tyler nodded like an eager pupil, or a criminal being let out on leave.Randy stepped forward and clapped a hand on his sons shoulder.Head on out to the car, Randy said, and Tyler nearly ran from the room.Hes pretty eaten up over what happened, Randy said.So is my brain.Randys mouth fell open and Luc managed to laugh.It was a bad joke.I dont find this funny.You havent issued a statement.The rumors are getting worse in the press.We havent heard from your lawyers or from the team Lawyers?Randy swallowed and pulled himself up a few more inches.Are you going to sue us?Sue?The thought hadnt occurred to him.God no.Look, Randy, Ithis is an old injury.And if it hadnt been your son, it would have been a player on the team as soon as we got back to practice andyou know, I might not have come away from it so well.So, no.Im not going to sue you.But if your son wants to skate, tell him to be here at seven a. m.  on MondayI need some help with the peewees.Thank you, Luc, Randy said, relief running off the man like sweat.Luc accepted his thanks and bit back the urge to extend his own.Because oddly enough, Tyler Jenkins might have saved his life.The sunlight made Victorias face look like the scene of a battle.It was red and swollen, her eye was puffy, her lip was fat and kept cracking, spilling new blood over her teeth.There was no way she could see Jacob like this.She needed a few hours to try to make her face look better.She slunk into the house, surprised at the quiet.Pleased with the peace in the big rooms, filled with sunshine.Despite the fat lip and black eye, she feltgood.Happy.This houses bad memories didnt haunt her anymore.If it wouldnt make her lip bleed, she might actually smile.Laugh, even.Marvelous thing, kicking a man in his balls.She would recommend it to anyone.Maybe shed write a self help book.Now, that would be funny.She grabbed a tea towel and some ice from the kitchen and found herself reluctant to hide in her room.Shed done enough of that.Instead she found her feet leading her out to the barn.After a very slow start, Victoria had learned to love horses.Besides her brother, they were the only bright spot of her summers at the ranch.The barn was still full of horses.And the sun sliding through the wide windows baked the hay and dirt, and bees buzzed around in low, lazy circles, and it was a lot like she remembered as a kid.In the far corner, a black horse lifted its big head, getting a look at her as she walked down the center of the barn.Whats your name?she murmured, scratching the white star between the horses eyes.Star?The horse only blinked.How about Midnight?The horse gave her nothing.Black Beauty?Patience, a low, deep voice said from behind her and she jumped, startling the horse, who huffed and pranced, scattering dust motes like glitter.It was Eli, of course.Standing in a long beam of sunshine from the open door.His hat was low over his eyes, shading his face.But the sunlight hit the skin of his neck, the bit of chest revealed by the open collar of his shirt, and turned him to gold.He was beautiful.A perfect statue of masculinity.David brought to life and wearing cowboy boots.Did he have to be somasculine?It was slightly vulgar.Unnecessarily earthy.Hey, Eli.She ducked away from him, hiding her face.What are you doing in here?I like it in here.Its quiet.Is that all right?Im notyou knowtouching anything.Its fine, Victoria.His voice straddled a weird line between fond and patronizing, and she forced herself not to care.I do remember you, you know, she said, reluctant to leave even though she knew she should.She ducked around the opposite side of the horse as he stepped into the stall.From when we were kids.He was silent and she, uncorked from her afternoon of violence and self recovery, couldnt stop talking.I didnt recognize you at first.Youre so different.So are you.The wild bark of her laughter startled the horse and Eli clucked under his tongue, stroking Patiences neck.Sorry, she murmured.Its all right.He was crouched, looking at the horses hooves, checking its shoes.In the quiet, she knew he was thinking of that girl shed been.Two years older than he.Glasses.Pudgy and bookish, utterly and totally intimidated by everyone around her.A disgrace to her glamorous and hard living mother.Hed been sixteen the last time she visited.A boy on the edge of manhood, growing into his body and his glower.Which clearly, hed perfected.Eli had been the object of many a teenage fantasy.Do you still ride?he asked, picking up another hoof.She edged around toward the horses head, trying to keep her face hidden.Me?Oh, no.No.No riding.Not many horses in Manhattan.Though she could have had them.She could have had anything.But when shed married Joel, horses, this barn, her early love affair with both, had become a part of her past.A past she had pushed away with as much force as possible.I wasnt very good with them anyway.Thats not true.She watched him with one eye, waiting, suddenly breathless for more.Thats what my father always told me.Your father was an ass.She laughed, she laughed so hard tears ran down her eyes and she didnt notice him watching her from over the horses back.He pointed to her face, suddenly intent and focused.On her.That affable mystery turned predatory, and she remembered, stupidly, that she was in the barn trying to hide her busted up lip and cheek.What happened?His lips barely moved.The ice rearranged itself in the tea towel she held up to her cheek and he reached forward as if to pull it away, but she stepped out of the way.Dont, she said, implacable.Staring at him dead center in a way shed never been able to do before.Who hit you?If she told him, she knew instinctively what would happen.Eli would tell Luc and then, with all the best intentions, they would take care of her problem, not even caring whether that was what she wanted.Or even needed.And the desire to tell him, to sway just slightly toward him, to have him cradle her against that admittedly handsome chest, it was a potent desire.But it was a desire born out of habit.For too long shed been cared for.Petted and worried over without ever once stepping up and handling her life herself.It felt as if her bones were breaking, but not in a painful way.In an empowering way, as if suddenly she was breaking down her own prison walls, the limitations and restraints shed put on herself for so long that she no longer saw them.Like a woman living in a dollhouse, thinking it was a palace.Dont worry about me, she told Eli, and she meant it.Was proud of the implacable nature of her voice, like she was an authority in her own damn life.About time.Luc stared out the safety glass at the small knot of reporters that had collected outside the arena doors.Hed been avoiding it, making a last ditch effort to pretend his life was as it had been.But it was time to give his statement.Beckett was going to have his ass for not making it officialno press conference, no written statement.No him.But somehow, in front of this little arena that oddly felt like a huge part of his future, ending his career felt right.The second he stepped out the door, the reporters swarmed, mics in his face, the lights on the cameras blinding him, and it became obvious that hed lost his touch when he reached up an arm to shield his eyes.Ice Man.It was good old Addie Eggers; decent of her to come all the down from Toronto to witness the end of his career.Do you have anything to say He waved his hands as if he were brushing away annoying flies.Calm down, kids.Just relax.Ill give you my statement.The silence after his words was so deep, he felt like he might lose his balance and just topple in.Im old.My brain is broken.And Im done.Who knocked you out, Luc?she asked.Has the front office brought legal action against him?No one knocked me out.I was on the ice with a kid, butthis is a problem Ive had.What about the rumors that youre coaching a Junior A team down here in Texas?Addie asked.Im coaching peewee hockey, he said.Thats it for the foreseeable future.If that changes He smiled at her.I imagine youll be the first to know.Within two hours, his phone was ringing constantly.Frustrated, he flipped it open looking at the number on display.Gates Weve got a development, Thiele said, and Luc pushed away from the boards hed been leaning against.You found Dennis?No.Not really.But he made a purchase from a source of mine who just contacted me.So we know hes in the Dallas area.I already knew that, Luc barked, having no problem taking his anger out on the undeserving private investigator.Tell me something I dont know.He bought a gun.29 Lucs heart pounded in his throat, the sensation of losing control a hideous freefall.He took off down the front steps while the streetlights flickered on across the street.Frantic, he called Tara Jeans cell phone but it clicked right over to voice mail.Look, he said, squeezing the phone so hard his hand ached.I know youre upset, but weve got a problem.Dennis bought a gun.You need to call me.Back to the ranch, he thought, his brain firing and misfiring, all the wires pulled and crossed.Maybe she had changed her mind.Maybe she was there, waiting.Safe.He ran back inside the arena to gather up Billy and Jacob, to take them back to his fathers home, where despite all of his best intentions, he always seemed to fuck up.In the end, it wasnt that hard to get a message to Dennis.She called the bars where he used to hang out and left messages with bartenders and a few of his sleaze bag friends that she was leaving town, heading back to Arkansas.She didnt know how much time she had, but she worked as fast as she could.Packing up all of her boxes and shoving them into the Honda hatchback.Ignoring the constant ringing of her phone.It was Luc.And there was nothing more to say.Sad, she thought, looking at the garbage bags and recycled produce boxes that held all her worldly belongings.That was just sad.The sun had set not long ago and she wanted to be on the road soon.She had no intention of going to Arkansas, but she prayed that Dennis would believe her, follow her little trail of crumbs in the wrong direction.Instead, she was thinking of New Orleans.A woman could get lost in a city like that.She ran back into her apartment, left the keys on the kitchen table, and ignored any impulse to look around, wanting to get on the road before Dennis came looking for her.But when she turned, Dennis stood in the open front door.Going somewhere?he asked, so familiar it was like looking in the mirror.Back home, she muttered, using everything she had to keep herself calm.Too late.Shed waited too long.Shed even managed to screw this up.Wheres my money?he demanded.He was already drunk, mean drunk, and there was an explosion of fear in her chest.For a moment she contemplated a lie, a diversion.But she didnt have the capacity for it anymore; there was nothing she needed as much as him out of the Bakers lives.She shook her head.Theres no money.I fucked up.I should know better than to count on you.Thats right, she said, laughing a little.You should.So beat the shit out of me, or whatever youre planning.But I dont have any money.He stepped closer, staggering slightly, and when he put his hand up to the wall to steady himself, something heavy clattered against it.A gun.She backed away, running into a kitchen chair, sending it screeching along the linoleum.What are you doing with that?In all the horrible things shed seen Dennis do, a gun had never been involved.Whatever was happening to Dennis, whoever was after himit must be bad.Worse than ever.This old thing?He wagged it in the air, his flippancy raising gooseflesh over her arms.Dennis was pushed to the wall, wild eyed and evil.Scared.Who is after you, Dennis?Someone a whole lot smarter than you.He waved the gun at her.Get up.Lets go for a drive.Luc paced the front porch, a watchdog on high alert.His failures were hot coals under his feet, a burning pain in his head.Frantically, for the last few hours hed been trying to make things right.But no one knew where Tara Jean lived in Springfield.Not Ruby.Not Eli.Not Randy Jenkins.Not Victoria, whod shut herself up in her dark room with a migraine.Hed known since he first came to the ranch that she was off the grid.Untraceable.Every bill paid in cash.No land line.No address.But now he knew it was all to prevent Dennis from finding her.And now Dennis had a gun and he was looking for the two hundred thousand dollars she didnt have.Thiele was trying to find Dennis in Dallas with no luck, and Luc was stuck pacing the porch.In his desperation he concocted a half assed plan, unsure if Dennis would show here.He called the cops to tell them what he knew about the protection order and Dennis buying a gun.He asked them to find Tara Jean Sweet using the address on the forms shed filed at the courthouse, but they didnt have those forms.Randy Jenkins didnt have access to them either.He wouldnt until Monday morning.So that left him, a house full of his family, and Eli out behind the house with his twelve gauge if things went to shit before the police arrived.An hour passed, and he wondered if he was jumping at shadows.Expecting the worst when there was another explanation for everything.And then he heard it, the sound of tires over gravel.No headlights, though.Nothing but shadows and a sense of foreboding that crashed up against this house like a storm.He knew in his gut that in that car was Dennis, sneaking up on his family.Luc pumped the shotgun in his hands.The front door behind him slipped open and Rubys unusually pale face peeked through the crack.What was that?she asked.
