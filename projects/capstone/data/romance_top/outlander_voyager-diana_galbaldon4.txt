Oh, he said airily, waving his free hand in the air, the pillory.Earnailing.Flogging.Imprisonment.Transportation.That sort of thing.Likely not hanging.What a relief, I said dryly.I felt a trifle hollow.I hadnt even tried to imagine what his life might be like, if I found him.Now that I had, I was a little taken aback.I did warn ye, he said.The teasing was gone now, and the dark blue eyes were serious and watchful.You did, I said, and took a deep breath.Do ye want to leave now?He spoke casually enough, but I saw his fingers clench and tighten on a fold of the quilt, so that the knuckles stood out white against the sunbronzed skin.No, I said.I smiled at him, as best I could manage.I didnt come back just to make love with you once.I came to be with youif youll have me, I ended, a little hesitantly.If Ill have you!He let out the breath he had been holding, and sat up to face me, cross legged on the bed.He reached out and took my hands, engulfing them between his own.Icanna even say what I felt when I touched you today, Sassenach, and knew ye to be real, he said.His eyes traveled over me, and I felt the heat of him, yearning, and my own heat, melting toward him.To find you againand then to lose ye He stopped, throat working as he swallowed.I touched his face, tracing the fine, clean line of cheekbone and jaw.You wont lose me, I said.Not ever again.I smiled, smoothing back the thick ruff of ruddy hair behind his ear.Not even if I find out youve been committing bigamy and public drunkenness.He jerked sharply at that, and I dropped my hand, startled.What is it?Well he said, and stopped.He pursed his lips and glanced at me quickly.Its just  Just what?Is there something else you havent told me?Well, printing seditious pamphlets isna all that profitable, he said, in explanation.I dont suppose so, I said, my heart starting to speed up again at the prospect of further revelations.What else have you been doing?Well, its just that I do a wee bit of smuggling, he said apologetically.On the side, like.A smuggler?I stared.Smuggling what?Well, whisky mostly, but rum now and then, and a fair bit of French wine and cambric.So thats it!I said.The pieces of the puzzle all settled into placeMr.Willoughby, the Edinburgh docks, and the riddle of our present surroundings.Thats what your connection is with this placewhat you meant by saying Madame Jeanne is a customer?Thats it.He nodded.It works verra well; we store the liquor in one of the cellars below when it comes in from France.Some of it we sell directly to Jeanne; some she keeps for us until we can ship it on.Um.And as part of the arrangements I said delicately, you, er  The blue eyes narrowed at me.The answer to what youre thinking, Sassenach, is no, he said very firmly.Oh, is it?I said, feeling extremely pleased.Mind reader, are you?And what am I thinking?You were wondering do I take out my price in trade sometimes, aye?He lifted one brow at me.Well, I was, I admitted.Not that its any of my business.Oh, isnt it, then?He raised both ruddy brows and took me by both shoulders, leaning toward me.Is it?he said, a moment later.He sounded a little breathless.Yes, I said, sounding equally breathless.And you dont  I dont.Come here.He wrapped his arms around me, and pulled me close.The bodys memory is different from the minds.When I thought, and wondered, and worried, I was clumsy and awkward, fumbling my way.Without the interference of conscious thought, my body knew him, and answered him at once in tune, as though his touch had left me moments before, and not years.I was more afraid this time than on our wedding night, I murmured, my eyes fixed on the slow, strong pulsebeat in the hollow of his throat.Were ye, then?His arm shifted and tightened round me.Do I frighten ye, Sassenach?No.I put my fingers on the tiny pulse, breathing the deep musk of his effort.Its onlythe first timeI didnt think it would be forever.I meant to go, then.He snorted faintly, the sweat gleaming lightly in the small hollow in the center of his chest.And ye did go, and came again, he said.Youre here; theres no more that matters, than that.I raised myself slightly to look at him.His eyes were closed, slanted and catlike, his lashes that striking color I remembered so well because I had seen it so often; deep auburn at the tips, fading to a red so pale as nearly to be blond at the roots.What did you think, the first time we lay together?I asked.The dark blue eyes opened slowly, and rested on me.It has always been forever, for me, Sassenach, he said simply.Sometime later, we fell asleep entwined, with the sound of the rain falling soft against the shutters, mingling with the muffled sounds of commerce below.It was a restless night.Too tired to stay awake a moment longer, I was too happy to fall soundly asleep.Perhaps I was afraid he would vanish if I slept.Perhaps he felt the same.We lay close together, not awake, but too aware of each other to sleep deeply.I felt every small twitch of his muscles, every movement of his breathing, and knew he was likewise aware of me.Half dozing, we turned and moved together, always touching, in a sleepy, slow motion ballet, learning again in silence the language of our bodies.Somewhere in the deep, quiet hours of the night, he turned to me without a word, and I to him, and we made love to each other in a slow, unspeaking tenderness that left us lying still at last, in possession of each others secrets.Soft as a moth flying in the dark, my hand skimmed his leg, and found the thin deep runnel of the scar.My fingers traced its invisible length and paused, with the barest of touches at its end, wordlessly asking, How?His breathing changed with a sigh, and his hand lay over mine.Culloden, he said, the whispered word an evocation of tragedy.Death.Futility.And the terrible parting that had taken me from him.Ill never leave you, I whispered.Not again.His head turned on the pillow, his features lost in darkness, and his lips brushed mine, light as the touch of an insects wing.He turned onto his back, shifting me next to him, his hand resting heavy on the curve of my thigh, keeping me close.Sometime later, I felt him shift again, and turn the bedclothes back a little way.A cool draft played across my forearm; the tiny hairs prickled upright, and then flattened beneath the warmth of his touch.I opened my eyes, to find him turned on his side, absorbed in the sight of my hand.It lay still on the quilt, a carved white thing, all the bones and tendons chalked in gray as the room began its imperceptible shift from night to day.Draw her for me, he whispered, head bent as he gently traced the shapes of my fingers, long and ghostly beneath the darkness of his own touch.What has she of you, of me?Can ye tell me?Are her hands like yours, Claire, or mine?Draw her for me, let me see her.He laid his own hand down beside my own.It was his good hand, the fingers straight and flat jointed, the nails clipped short, square and clean.Like mine, I said.My voice was low and hoarse with waking, barely loud enough to register above the drumming of the rain outside.The house beneath was silent.I raised the fingers of my immobile hand an inch in illustration.She has long, slim hands like minebut bigger than mine, broad across the backs, and a deep curve at the outside, near the wristlike that.Like yours; she has a pulse just there, where you do.I touched the spot where a vein crossed the curve of his radius, just where the wrist joins the hand.He was so still I could feel his heartbeat under my fingertip.Her nails are like yours; square, not oval like mine.But she has the crooked little finger on her right hand that I have, I said, lifting it.My mother had it, too; Uncle Lambert told me.My own mother had died when I was five.I had no clear memory of her, but thought of her whenever I saw my own hand unexpectedly, caught in a moment of grace like this one.I laid the hand with the crooked finger on his, then lifted it to his face.She has this line, I said softly, tracing the bold sweep from temple to cheek.Your eyes, exactly, and those lashes and brows.A Fraser nose.Her mouth is more like mine, with a full bottom lip, but its wide, like yours.A pointed chin, like mine, but stronger.Shes a big girlnearly six feet tall.I felt his start of astonishment, and nudged him gently, knee to knee.She has long legs, like yours, but very feminine.And has she that small blue vein just there?His hand touched my own face, thumb tender in the hollow of my temple.And ears like tiny wings, Sassenach?She always complained about her earssaid they stuck out, I said, feeling the tears sting my eyes as Brianna came suddenly to life between us.Theyre pierced.You dont mind, do you?I said, talking fast to keep the tears at bay.Frank did; he said it looked cheap, and she shouldnt, but she wanted to do it, and I let her, when she was sixteen.Mine were; it didnt seem right to say she couldnt when I did, and her friends all did, and I didntdidnt want  Ye were right, he said, interrupting the flow of half hysterical words.Ye did fine, he repeated, softly but firmly, holding me close.Ye were a wonderful mother, I know it.I was crying again, quite soundlessly, shaking against him.He held me gently, stroking my back and murmuring.Ye did well, he kept saying.Ye did right.And after a little while, I stopped crying.Ye gave me a child, mo nighean donn, he said softly, into the cloud of my hair.We are together for always.She is safe; and we will live forever now, you and I.  He kissed me, very lightly, and laid his head upon the pillow next to me.Brianna, he whispered, in that odd Highland way that made her name his own.He sighed deeply, and in an instant, was asleep.In another, I fell asleep myself, my last sight his wide, sweet mouth, relaxed in sleep, half smiling.26  WHORES BRUNCH  From years of answering the twin calls of motherhood and medicine, I had developed the ability to wake from even the soundest sleep at once and completely.I woke so now, immediately aware of the worn linen sheets around me, the dripping of the eaves outside, and the warm scent of Jamies body mingling with the cold, sweet air that breathed through the crack of the shutters above me.Jamie himself was not in bed; without reaching out or opening my eyes, I knew that the space beside me was empty.He was close by, though.There was a sound of stealthy movement, and a faint scraping noise nearby.I turned my head on the pillow and opened my eyes.The room was filled with a gray light that washed the color from everything, but left the pale lines of his body clear in the dimness.He stood out against the darkness of the room, solid as ivory, vivid as though he were etched upon the air.He was naked, his back turned to me as he stood in front of the chamber pot he had just pulled from its resting place beneath the washstand.I admired the squared roundness of his buttocks, the small muscular hollow that dented each one, and their pale vulnerability.The groove of his backbone, springing in a deep, smooth curve from hips to shoulders.As he moved slightly, the light caught the faint silver shine of the scars on his back, and the breath caught in my throat.He turned around then, face calm and faintly abstracted.He saw me watching him, and looked slightly startled.I smiled but stayed silent, unable to think of anything to say.I kept looking at him, though, and he at me, the same smile upon his lips.Without speaking, he moved toward me and sat on the bed, the mattress shifting under his weight.He laid his hand open on the quilt, and I put my own into it without hesitation.Sleep well?I asked idiotically.A grin broadened across his face.No, he said.Did you?No.I could feel the heat of him, even at this distance, in spite of the chilly room.Arent you cold?No.We fell quiet again, but could not take our eyes away from each other.I looked him over carefully in the strengthening light, comparing memory to reality.A narrow blade of early sun knifed through the shutters crack, lighting a lock of hair like polished bronze, gilding the curve of his shoulder, the smooth flat slope of his belly.He seemed slightly larger than I had remembered, and one hell of a lot more immediate.Youre bigger than I remembered, I ventured.He tilted his head, looking down at me in amusement.Youre a wee bit smaller, I think.His hand engulfed mine, fingers delicately circling the bones of my wrist.My mouth was dry; I swallowed and licked my lips.A long time ago, you asked me if I knew what it was between us, I said.His eyes rested on mine, so dark a blue as to be nearly black in a light like this.I remember, he said softly.His fingers tightened briefly on mine.What it iswhen I touch you; when ye lie wi me.I said I didnt know.I didna ken either.The smile had faded a bit, but was still there, lurking in the corners of his mouth.I still dont, I said.But and stopped to clear my throat.But its still there, he finished for me, and the smile moved from his lips, lighting his eyes.Aye?It was.I was still as aware of him as I might have been of a lighted stick of dynamite in my immediate vicinity, but the feeling between us had changed.We had fallen asleep as one flesh, linked by the love of the child we had made, and had waked as two peoplebound by something different.Yes.Is itI mean, its not just because of Brianna, do you think?The pressure on my fingers increased.Do I want ye because youre the mother of my child?He raised one ruddy eyebrow in incredulity.Well, no.Not that Im no grateful, he added hastily.Butno.He bent his head to look down at me intently, and the sun lit the narrow bridge of his nose and sparked in his lashes.No, he said.I think I could watch ye for hours, Sassenach, to see how you have changed, or how yere the same.Just to see a wee thing, like the curve of your chinhe touched my jaw gently, letting his hand slide up to cup my head, thumb stroking my earlobeor your ears, and the bittie holes for your earbobs.Those are all the same, just as they were.Your hairI called ye mo nighean donn, dye recall?My brown one.His voice was little more than a whisper, his fingers threading my curls between them.I expect thats changed a bit, I said.I hadnt gone gray, but there were paler streaks where my normal light brown had faded to a softer gold, and here and there, the glint of a single silver strand.Like beechwood in the rain, he said, smiling and smoothing a lock with one forefinger, and the drops coming down from the leaves across the bark.I reached out and stroked his thigh, touching the long scar that ran down it.I wish I could have been there to take care of you, I said softly.It was the most horrible thing I ever didleaving you, knowingthat you meant to be killed.I could hardly bear to speak the word.Well, I tried hard enough, he said, with a wry grimace that made me laugh, in spite of my emotion.It wasna my fault I didna succeed.He glanced dispassionately at the long, thick scar that ran down his thigh.Not the fault of the Sassenach wi the bayonet, either.I heaved myself up on one elbow, squinting at the scar.A bayonet did that?Aye, well.It festered, ye see, he explained.I know; we found the journal of the Lord Melton who sent you home from the battlefield.He didnt think youd make it.My hand tightened on his knee, as though to reassure myself that he was in fact here before me, alive.He snorted.Well, I damn nearly didnt.I was all but dead when they pulled me out of the wagon at Lallybroch.His face darkened with memory.God, sometimes I wake up in the night, dreaming of that wagon.It was two days journey, and I was fevered or chilled, or both together.I was covered wi hay, and the ends of it sticking in my eyes and my ears and through my shirt, and fleas hopping all through it and eating me alive, and my leg killing me at every jolt in the road.It was a verra bumpy road, too, he added broodingly.It sounds horrible, I said, feeling the word quite inadequate.He snorted briefly.Aye.I only stood it by imagining what Id do to Melton if I ever met him again, to get back at him for not shooting me.I laughed again, and he glanced down at me, a wry smile on his lips.Im not laughing because its funny, I said, gulping a little.Im laughing because otherwise Ill cry, and I dont want tonot now, when its over.Aye, I know.He squeezed my hand.I took a deep breath.II didnt look back.I didnt think I could stand to find outwhat happened.I bit my lip; the admission seemed a betrayal.It wasnt that I triedthat I wantedto forget, I said, groping clumsily for words.I couldnt forget you; you shouldnt think that.Not ever.But I  Dinna fash yourself, Sassenach, he interrupted.He patted my hand gently.I ken what ye mean.I try not to look back myself, come to that.But if I had, I said, staring down at the smooth grain of the linen, if I hadI might have found you sooner.The words hung in the air between us like an accusation, a reminder of the bitter years of loss and separation.Finally he sighed, deeply, and put a finger under my chin, lifting my face to his.And if ye had?he said.Would ye have left the lassie there without her mother?Or come to me in the time after Culloden, when I couldna care for ye, but only watch ye suffer wi the rest, and feel the guilt of bringing ye to such a fate?Maybe see ye die of the hunger and sickness, and know Id killed ye?He raised one eyebrow in question, then shook his head.No.I told ye to go, and I told ye to forget.Shall I blame ye for doing as I said, Sassenach?No.But we might have had more time!I said.We might have He stopped me by the simple expedient of bending and putting his mouth on mine.It was warm and very soft, and the stubble of his face was faintly scratchy on my skin.After a moment he released me.The light was growing, putting color in his face.His skin glowed bronze, sparked with the copper of his beard.He took a deep breath.Aye, we might.But to think of thatwe cannot.His eyes met mine steadily, searching.I canna look back, Sassenach, and live, he said simply.If we have no more than last night, and this moment, it is enough.Not for me, it isnt!I said, and he laughed.Greedy wee thing, are ye no?Yes, I said.The tension broken, I returned my attention to the scar on his leg, to keep away for the moment from the painful contemplation of lost time and opportunity.You were telling me how you got that.So I was.He rocked back a little, squinting down at the thin white line down the top of his thigh.Well, it was Jennymy sister, ye ken?I did indeed remember Jenny; half her brothers size, and dark as he was blazing fair, but a match and more for him in stubbornness.She said she wasna going to let me die, he said, with a rueful smile.And she didnt.My opinion didna seem to have anything to do wi the matter, so she didna bother to ask me.That sounds like Jenny.I felt a small glow of comfort at the thought of my sister in law.Jamie hadnt been alone as I feared, then; Jenny Murray would have fought the Devil himself to save her brotherand evidently had.She dosed me for the fever, and put poultices on my leg to draw the poison, but nothing worked, and it only got worse.It swelled and stank, and then began to go black and rotten, so they thought they must take the leg off, if I was to live.He recounted this quite matter of factly, but I felt a little faint at the thought.Obviously they didnt, I said.Why not?Jamie scratched his nose and rubbed a hand back through his hair, wiping the wild spill of it out of his eyes.Well, that was Ian, he said.He wouldna let her do it.He said he kent well enough what it was like to live wi one leg, and while he didna mind it so much himself, he thought I wouldna like toall things considered, he added, with a wave of the hand and a glance at me that encompassed everythingthe loss of the battle, of the war, of me, of home and livelihoodof all the things of his normal life.I thought Ian might well have been right.So instead Jenny made three of the tenants come to sit on me and hold me still, and then she slit my leg to the bone wi a kitchen knife and washed the wound wi boiling water, he said casually.Jesus H.  Christ!I blurted, shocked into horror.He smiled faintly at my expression.Aye, well, it worked.I swallowed heavily, tasting bile.Jesus.Id think youd have been a cripple for life!Well, she cleansed it as best she could, and stitched it up.She said she wasna going to let me die, and she wasna going to have me be a cripple, and she wasna going to have me lie about all the day feelin sorry for myself, and He shrugged, resigned.By the time she finished tellin me all the things she wouldna let me do, it seemed the only thing left to me was to get well.I echoed his laugh, and his smile broadened at the memory.Once I could get up, she made Ian take me outside after dark and make me walk.Lord, we must ha been a sight, Ian wi his wooden leg, and me wi my stick, limping up and down the road like a pair of lame cranes!I laughed again, but had to blink back tears; I could see all too well the two tall, limping figures, struggling stubbornly against darkness and pain, leaning on each other for support.You lived in a cave for a time, didnt you?We found the story of it.His eyebrows went up in surprise.A story about it?About me, ye mean?Youre a famous Highland legend, I told him dryly, or you will be, at least.For living in a cave?He looked half pleased, half embarrassed.Well, thats a foolish thing to make a story about, aye?Arranging to have yourself betrayed to the English for the price on your head was maybe a little more dramatic, I said, still more dryly.Taking rather a risk there, werent you?The end of his nose was pink, and he looked somewhat abashed.Well, he said awkwardly, I didna think prison would be verra dreadful, and everything considered.I spoke as calmly as I could, but I wanted to shake him, suddenly and ridiculously furious with him in retrospect.Prison, my arse!You knew perfectly well you might have been hanged, didnt you?And you bloody did it anyway!I had to do something, he said, shrugging.And if the English were fool enough to pay good money for my lousy carcasswell, theres nay law against takin advantage of fools, is there?One corner of his mouth quirked up, and I was torn between the urge to kiss him and the urge to slap him.I did neither, but sat up in bed and began combing the tangles out of my hair with my fingers.Id say its open to question who the fool was, I said, not looking at him, but even so, you should know that your daughters very proud of you.She is?He sounded thunderstruck, and I looked up at him, laughing despite my irritation.Well, of course she is.Youre a bloody hero, arent you?He went quite red in the face at this, and stood up, looking thoroughly disconcerted.Me?No!He rubbed a hand through his hair, his habit when thinking or disturbed in his mind.No.I mean, he said slowly, I wasna heroic at all about it.It was onlyI couldna bear it any longer.To see them all starving, I mean, and not be able to care for themJenny, and Ian and the children; all the tenants and their families.He looked helplessly down at me.I really didna care if the English hanged me or not, he said.I didna think they would, because of what yed told me, but even if Id known for sure it meant thatI would ha done it, Sassenach, and not minded.But it wasna braverynot at all.He threw up his hands in frustration, turning away.There was nothing else I could do!I see, I said softly, after a moment.I understand.He was standing by the chiffonier, still naked, and at this, he turned half round to face me.Do ye, then?His face was serious.I know you, Jamie Fraser.I spoke with more certainty than I had felt at any time since the moment I stepped through the rock.Do ye, then?he asked again, but a faint smile shadowed his mouth.I think so.The smile on his lips widened, and he opened his mouth to reply.Before he could speak, though, there was a knock upon the chamber door.I started as though I had touched a hot stove.Jamie laughed, and bent to pat my hip as he went to the door.I expect its the chambermaid with our breakfast, Sassenach, not the constable.And we are marrit, aye?One eyebrow rose quizzically.Even so, shouldnt you put something on?I asked, as he reached for the doorknob.He glanced down at himself.I shouldna think its likely to come as a shock to anyone in this house, Sassenach.But to honor your sensibilities He grinned at me, and taking a linen towel from the washstand, wrapped it casually about his loins before pulling open the door.I caught sight of a tall male figure standing in the hall, and promptly pulled the bedclothes over my head.This was a reaction of pure panic, for if it had been the Edinburgh constable or one of his minions, I could scarcely expect much protection from a couple of quilts.But then the visitor spoke, and I was glad that I was safely out of sight for the moment.Jamie?The voice sounded rather startled.Despite the fact that I had not heard it in twenty years, I recognized it at once.Rolling over, I surreptitiously lifted a corner of the quilt and peeked out beneath it.Well, of course its me, Jamie was saying, rather testily.Have ye no got eyes, man?He pulled his brother in law, Ian, into the room and shut the door.I see well enough its you, Ian said, with a note of sharpness.I just didna ken whether to believe my eyes!His smooth brown hair showed threads of gray, and his face bore the lines of a good many years hard work.But Joe Abernathy had been right; with his first words, the new vision merged with the old, and this was the Ian Murray I had known before.I came here because the lad at the printshop said yed no been there last night, and this was the address Jenny sends your letters to, he was saying.He looked round the room with wide, suspicious eyes, as though expecting something to leap out from behind the armoire.Then his gaze flicked back to his brother in law, who was making a perfunctory effort to secure his makeshift loincloth.I never thought to find ye in a kittle hoosie, Jamie!he said.I wasna sure, when thethe lady answered the door downstairs, but then  Its no what ye think, Ian, Jamie said shortly.Oh, its not, aye?And Jenny worrying that yed make yourself ill, living without a woman so long!Ian snorted.Ill tell her she needna concern herself wi your welfare.And wheres my son, then, down the hall with another o the harlots?Your son?Jamies surprise was evident.Which one?Ian stared at Jamie, the anger on his long, half homely face fading into alarm.Ye havena got him?Wee Ians not here?Young Ian?Christ, man, dye think Id bring a fourteen year old lad into a brothel?Ian opened his mouth, then shut it, and sat down on the stool.Tell ye the truth, Jamie, I canna say what yed do anymore, he said levelly.He looked up at his brother in law, jaw set.Once I could.But not now.And what the hell dye mean by that?I could see the angry flush rising in Jamies face.Ian glanced at the bed, and away again.The red flush didnt recede from Jamies face, but I saw a small quiver at the corner of his mouth.He bowed elaborately to his brother in law.Your pardon, Ian, I was forgettin my manners.Allow me to introduce ye to my companion.He stepped to the side of the bed and pulled back the quilts.No!Ian cried, jumping to his feet and looking frantically at the floor, the wardrobe, anywhere but at the bed.What, will ye no give your regards to my wife, Ian?Jamie said.Wife?Forgetting to look away, Ian goggled at Jamie in horror.Yeve marrit a whore?he croaked.I wouldnt call it that, exactly, I said.Hearing my voice, Ian jerked his head in my direction.Hullo, I said, waving cheerily at him from my nest of bedclothes.Been a long time, hasnt it?Id always thought the descriptions of what people did when seeing ghosts rather exaggerated, but had been forced to revise my opinions in light of the responses I had been getting since my return to the past.Jamie had fainted dead away, and if Ians hair was not literally standing on end, he assuredly looked as though he had been scared out of his wits.Eyes bugging out, he opened and closed his mouth, making a small gobbling noise that seemed to entertain Jamie quite a lot.Thatll teach ye to go about thinkin the worst of my character, he said, with apparent satisfaction.Taking pity on his quivering brother in law, Jamie poured out a tot of brandy and handed him the glass.Judge not, and yell no be judged, eh?I thought Ian was going to spill the drink on his breeches, but he managed to get the glass to his mouth and swallow.What he wheezed, eyes watering as he stared at me.How?Its a long story, I said, with a glance at Jamie.He nodded briefly.We had had other things to think about in the last twenty four hours besides how to explain me to people, and under the circumstances, I rather thought explanations could wait.I dont believe I know Young Ian.Is he missing?I asked politely.Ian nodded mechanically, not taking his eyes off me.He stole away from home last Friday week, he said, sounding rather dazed.Left a note that hed gone to his uncle.He took another swig of brandy, coughed and blinked several times, then wiped his eyes and sat up straighter, looking at me.Itll no be the first time, ye see, he said to me.He seemed to be regaining his self confidence, seeing that I appeared to be flesh and blood, and showed no signs either of getting out of bed, or of putting my head under my arm and strolling round without it, in the accepted fashion of Highland ghosts.Jamie sat down on the bed next to me, taking my hand in his.Ive not seen Young Ian since I sent him home wi Fergus six months ago, he said.He was beginning to look as worried as Ian.Youre sure he said he was coming to me?Well, he hasna got any other uncles that I know of, Ian said, rather acerbically.He tossed back the rest of the brandy and set the cup down.Fergus?I interrupted.Is Fergus all right, then?I felt a surge of joy at the mention of the French orphan whom Jamie had once hired in Paris as a pickpocket, and brought back to Scotland as a servant lad.Distracted from his thoughts, Jamie looked down at me.Oh, aye, Fergus is a bonny man now.A bit changed, of course.A shadow seemed to cross his face, but it cleared as he smiled, pressing my hand.Hell be fair daft at seein you once more, Sassenach.Uninterested in Fergus, Ian had risen and was pacing back and forth across the polished plank floor.He didna take a horse, he muttered.So hed have nothing anyone would rob him for.He swung round to Jamie.How did ye come, last time ye brought the lad here?By the land round the Firth, or did ye cross by boat?Jamie rubbed his chin, frowning as he thought.I didna come to Lallybroch for him.He and Fergus crossed through the Carryarrick Pass and met me just above Loch Laggan.Then we came down through Struan and Weem andaye, now I remember.We didna want to cross the Campbell lands, so we came to the east, and crossed the Forth at Donibristle.Dye think hed do that again?Ian asked.If its the only way he knows?Jamie shook his head doubtfully.He might.But he kens the coast is dangerous.Ian resumed his pacing, hands clasped behind his back.I beat him til he could barely stand, let alone sit, the last time he ran off, Ian said, shaking his head.His lips were tight, and I gathered that Young Ian was perhaps rather a trial to his father.Yed think the wee fool would think better o such tricks, aye?Jamie snorted, but not without sympathy.Did a thrashing ever stop you from doing anything youd set your mind on?Ian stopped his pacing and sat down on the stool again, sighing.No, he said frankly, but I expect it was some relief to my father.His face cracked into a reluctant smile, as Jamie laughed.Hell be all right, Jamie declared confidently.He stood up and let the towel drop to the floor as he reached for his breeches.Ill go and put about the word for him.If hes in Edinburgh, well hear of it by nightfall.Ian cast a glance at me in the bed, and stood up hastily.Ill go wi ye.I thought I saw a shadow of doubt flicker across Jamies face, but then he nodded and pulled the shirt over his head.All right, he said, as his head popped through the slit.He frowned at me.Im afraid yell have to stay here, Sassenach, he said.I suppose I will, I said dryly.Seeing that I havent any clothes.The maid who brought our supper had removed my dress, and no replacement had as yet appeared.Ians feathery brows shot up to his hairline, but Jamie merely nodded.Ill tell Jeanne on the way out, he said.He frowned slightly, thinking.It may be some time, Sassenach.There are thingswell, Ive business to take care of.He squeezed my hand, his expression softening as he looked at me.I dinna want to leave ye, he said softly.But I must.Youll stay here until I come again?Dont worry, I assured him, waving a hand at the linen towel he had just discarded.Im not likely to go anywhere in that.The thud of their feet retreated down the hall and faded into the sounds of the stirring house.The brothel was rising, late and languid by the stern Scottish standards of Edinburgh.Below me I could hear the occasional slow muffled thump, the clatter of shutters thrust open nearby, a cry of Gardyloo!and a second later, the splash of slops flung out to land on the street far below.Voices somewhere far down the hall, a brief inaudible exchange, and the closing of a door.The building itself seemed to stretch and sigh, with a creaking of timbers and a squeaking of stairs, and a sudden puff of coal smelling warm air came out from the back of the cold hearth, the exhalation of a fire lit on some lower floor, sharing my chimney.I relaxed into the pillows, feeling drowsy and heavily content.I was slightly and pleasantly sore in several unaccustomed places, and while I had been reluctant to see Jamie go, there was no denying that it was nice to be alone for a bit to mull things over.I felt much like one who has been handed a sealed casket containing a long lost treasure.I could feel the satisfying weight and the shape of it, and know the great joy of its possession, but still did not know exactly what was contained therein.I was dying to know everything he had done and said and thought and been, through all the days between us.I had of course known that if he had survived Culloden, he would have a lifeand knowing what I did of Jamie Fraser, it was unlikely to be a simple one.But knowing that, and being confronted with the reality of it, were two different things.He had been fixed in my memory for so long, glowing but static, like an insect frozen in amber.And then had come Rogers brief historical sightings, like peeks through a keyhole; separate pictures like punctuations, alterations; adjustments of memory, each showing the dragonflys wings raised or lowered at a different angle, like the single frames of a motion picture.Now time had begun to run again for us, and the dragonfly was in flight before me, flickering from place to place, so I saw little more yet than the glitter of its wings.There were so many questions neither of us had had a chance to ask yetwhat of his family at Lallybroch, his sister Jenny and her children?Obviously Ian was alive, and well, wooden leg notwithstandingbut had the rest of the family and the tenants of the estate survived the destruction of the Highlands?If they had, why was Jamie here in Edinburgh?And if they were alivewhat would we tell them about my sudden reappearance?I bit my lip, wondering whether there was any explanationshort of the truthwhich might make sense.It might depend on what Jamie had told them when I disappeared after Culloden; there had seemed no need to concoct a reason for my vanishing at the time; it would simply be assumed that I had perished in the aftermath of the Rising, one more of the nameless corpses lying starved on the rocks or slaughtered in a leafless glen.Well, wed manage that when we came to it, I supposed.I was more curious just now about the extent and the danger of Jamies less legitimate activities.Smuggling and sedition, was it?I was aware that smuggling was nearly as honorable a profession in the Scottish Highlands as cattle stealing had been twenty years before, and might be conducted with relatively little risk.Sedition was something else, and seemed like an occupation of dubious safety for a convicted ex Jacobite traitor.That, I supposed, was the reason for his assumed nameor one reason, at any rate.Disturbed and excited as I had been when we arrived at the brothel the night before, I had noticed that Madame Jeanne referred to him by his own name.So presumably he smuggled under his own identity, but carried out his publishing activitieslegal and illegalas Alex Malcolm.I had seen, heard and felt enough, during the all too brief hours of the night, to be fairly sure that the Jamie Fraser I had known still existed.How many other men he might be now remained to be seen.There was a tentative rap at the door, interrupting my thoughts.Breakfast, I thought, and not before time.I was ravenous.Come in, I called, and sat up in bed, pulling up the pillows to lean against.The door opened very slowly, and after quite a long pause, a head poked its way through the opening, much in the manner of a snail emerging from its shell after a hailstorm.It was topped with an ill cut shag of dark brown hair so thick that the cropped edges stuck out like a shelf above a pair of large ears.The face beneath was long and bony; rather pleasantly homely, save for a pair of beautiful brown eyes, soft and huge as a deers, that rested on me with a mingled expression of interest and hesitancy.The head and I regarded each other for a moment.Are you Mr.Malcolmswoman?it asked.I suppose you could say so, I replied cautiously.This was obviously not the chambermaid with my breakfast.Neither was it likely to be one of the other employees of the establishment, being evidently male, though very young.He seemed vaguely familiar, though I was sure I hadnt seen him before.I pulled the sheet a bit higher over my breasts.And who are you?I inquired.The head thought this over for some time, and finally answered, with equal caution, Ian Murray.Ian Murray?I shot up straight, rescuing the sheet at the last moment.Come in here, I said peremptorily.If youre who I think you are, why arent you where youre supposed to be, and what are you doing here?The face looked rather alarmed, and showed signs of withdrawal.Stop!I called, and put a leg out of bed to pursue him.The big brown eyes widened at the sight of my bare limb, and he froze.Come in, I said.Slowly, I withdrew the leg beneath the quilts, and equally slowly, he followed it into the room.He was tall and gangly as a fledgling stork, with perhaps nine stone spread sparsely over a six foot frame.Now that I knew who he was, the resemblance to his father was clear.He had his mothers pale skin, though, which blushed furiously red as it occurred to him suddenly that he was standing next to a bed containing a naked woman.Ierwas looking for myfor Mr.Malcolm, I mean, he murmured, staring fixedly at the floorboards by his feet.If you mean your uncle Jamie, hes not here, I said.No.No, I suppose not.He seemed unable to think of anything to add to this, but remained staring at the floor, one foot twisted awkwardly to the side, as though he were about to draw it up under him, like the wading bird he so much resembled.Do ye ken where he began, lifting his eyes, then, as he caught a glimpse of me, lowered them, blushed again and fell silent.Hes looking for you, I said.With your father, I added.They left here not half an hour ago.His head snapped up on its skinny neck, goggling.My father?he gasped.My father was here?Ye know him?Why, yes, I said, without thinking.Ive known Ian for quite a long time.He might be Jamies nephew, but he hadnt Jamies trick of inscrutability.Everything he thought showed on his face, and I could easily trace the progression of his expressions.Raw shock at learning of his fathers presence in Edinburgh, then a sort of awestruck horror at the revelation of his fathers long standing acquaintance with what appeared to be a woman of a certain occupation, and finally the beginnings of angry absorption, as the young man began an immediate revision of his opinions of his fathers character.Er I said, mildly alarmed.It isnt what you think.I mean, your father and Iits really your uncle and I, I mean I was trying to figure out how to explain the situation to him without getting into even deeper waters, when he whirled on his heel and started for the door.Wait a minute, I said.He stopped, but didnt turn around.His well scrubbed ears stood out like tiny wings, the morning light illuminating their delicate pinkness.How old are you?I asked.He turned around to face me, with a certain painful dignity.Ill be fifteen in three weeks, he said.The red was creeping up his cheeks again.Dinna worry, Im old enough to knowwhat sort of place this is, I mean.He jerked his head toward me in an attempt at a courtly bow.Meaning no offense to ye, mistress.If Uncle JamieI mean, I he groped for suitable words, failed to find any, and finally blurted, verra pleased to meet ye, mum!turned and bolted through the door, which shut hard enough to rattle in its frame.I fell back against the pillows, torn between amusement and alarm.I did wonder what the elder Ian was going to say to his son when they metand vice versa.As long as I was wondering, I wondered what had brought the younger Ian here in search of Jamie.Evidently, he knew where his uncle was likely to be found; yet judging from his diffident attitude, he had never before ventured into the brothel.Had he extracted the information from Geordie at the printshop?That seemed unlikely.And yet, if he hadntthen that meant he had learned of his uncles connection with this place from some other source.And the most likely source was Jamie himself.But in that case, I reasoned, Jamie likely already knew that his nephew was in Edinburgh, so why pretend he hadnt seen the boy?Ian was Jamies oldest friend; they had grown up together.If whatever Jamie was up to was worth the cost of deceiving his brother in law, it was something serious.I had got no further with my musings, when there came another knock on the door.Come in, I said, smoothing out the quilts in anticipation of the breakfast tray to be placed thereon.When the door opened, I had directed my attention at a spot about five feet above the floor, where I expected the chambermaids head to materialize.Upon the last opening of the door, I had had to adjust my vision upward a foot, to accommodate the appearance of Young Ian.This time, I was obliged to drop it.What in the bloody hell are you doing here?I demanded as the diminutive figure of Mr.Willoughby entered on hands and knees.I sat up and hastily tucked my feet underneath me, pulling not only sheet but quilts well up around my shoulders.In answer, the Chinese advanced to within a foot of the bed, then let his head fall to the floor with a loud clunk.He raised it and repeated the process with great deliberation, making a horrid sound like a melon being cleaved with an ax.Stop that!I exclaimed, as he prepared to do it a third time.Thousand apology, he explained, sitting up on his heels and blinking at me.He was quite a bit the worse for wear, and the dark red mark where his forehead had smacked the floor didnt add anything to his appearance.I trusted he didnt mean hed been going to hit his head on the floor a thousand times, but I wasnt sure.He obviously had the hell of a hangover; for him to have attempted it even once was impressive.Thats quite all right, I said, edging cautiously back against the wall.Theres nothing to apologize for.Yes, apology, he insisted.Tsei mi saying wife.Lady being most honorable First Wife, not stinking whore.Thanks a lot, I said.Tsei mi?You mean Jamie?Jamie Fraser?The little man nodded, to the obvious detriment of his head.He clutched it with both hands and closed his eyes, which promptly disappeared into the creases of his cheeks.Tsei mi, he affirmed, eyes still closed.Tsei mi saying apology to most honored First Wife.Yi Tien Cho most humble servant.He bowed deeply, still holding onto his head.Yi Tien Cho, he added, opening his eyes and tapping his chest to indicate that that was his name; in case I should be confusing him with any other humble servants in the vicinity.Thats quite all right, I said.Er, pleased to meet you.Evidently heartened by this, he slid bonelessly onto his face, prostrating himself before me.Yi Tien Cho ladys servant, he said.First Wife please to walk on humble servant, if like.Ha, I said coldly.Ive heard about you.Walk on you, eh?Not bloody likely!A slit of gleaming black eye showed, and he giggled, so irrepressibly that I couldnt help laughing myself.He sat up again, smoothing down the spikes of dirt stiffened black hair that sprang, porcupine like, from his skull.I wash First Wifes feet?he offered, grinning widely.Certainly not, I said.If you really want to do something helpful, go and tell someone to bring me breakfast.No, wait a minute, I said, changing my mind.First, tell me where you met Jamie.If you dont mind, I added, to be polite.He sat back on his heels, head bobbing slightly.Docks, he said.Two year ago.I come China, long way, no food.Hiding barrel, he explained, reaching his arms in a circle, to demonstrate his means of transportation.A stowaway?Trade ship, he nodded.On docks here, stealing food.Stealing brandy one night, getting stinking drunk.Very cold to sleep; die soon, but Tsei mi find.He jabbed a thumb at his chest once more.Tsei mis humble servant.Humble servant First Wife.He bowed to me, swaying alarmingly in the process, but came upright again without mishap.Brandy seems to be your downfall, I observed.Im sorry I havent anything to give you for your head; I dont have any medicines with me at the moment.Oh, not worry, he assured me.I having healthy balls.How nice for you, I said, trying to decide whether he was gearing up for another attempt on my feet, or merely still too drunk to distinguish basic anatomy.Or perhaps there was some connection in Chinese philosophy, between the well being of head and testicles?Just in case, I looked round for something that might be used as a weapon, in case he showed a disposition to begin burrowing under the bedclothes.Instead, he reached into the depths of one baggy blue silk sleeve and with the air of a conjuror, drew out a small white silk bag.He upended this, and two balls dropped out into his palm.They were larger than marbles and smaller than baseballs; about the size, in fact, of the average testicle.A good deal harder, though, being apparently made of some kind of polished stone, greenish in color.Healthy balls, Mr.Willoughby explained, rolling them together in his palm.They made a pleasant clicking noise.Streaked jade, from Canton, he said.Best kind of healthy balls.Really?I said, fascinated.And theyre medicinalgood for you, thats what youre saying?He nodded vigorously, then stopped abruptly with a faint moan.After a pause, he spread out his hand, and rolled the balls to and fro, keeping them in movement with a dextrous circling of his fingers.All body one part; hand all parts, he said.He poked a finger toward his open palm, touching delicately here and there between the smooth green spheres.Head there, stomach there, liver there, he said.Balls make all good.Well, I suppose theyre as portable as Alka Seltzer, I said.Possibly it was the reference to stomach that caused my own to emit a loud growl at this point.First Wife wanting food, Mr.Willoughby observed shrewdly.Very astute of you, I said.Yes, I do want food.Do you suppose you could go and tell someone?He dumped the healthy balls back into their bag at once, and springing to his feet, bowed deeply.Humble servant go now, he said, and went, crashing rather heavily into the door post on his way out.This was becoming ridiculous, I thought.I harbored substantial doubt as to whether Mr.Willoughbys visit would result in food; hed be lucky to make it to the bottom of the stair without falling on his head, if I was any judge of his condition.Rather than go on sitting here in the nude, receiving random deputations from the outside world, I thought it time to take steps.Rising and carefully wrapping a quilt around my body, I took a few, out into the corridor.The upper floor seemed deserted.Aside from the room I had left, there were only two other doors up here.Glancing up, I could see unadorned rafters overhead.We were in the attic then; chances were that the other rooms here were occupied by servants, who were presumably now employed downstairs.I could hear faint noises drifting up the stairwell.Something else drifted up, as wellthe scent of frying sausage.A loud gustatory rumble informed me that my stomach hadnt missed this, and furthermore, that my innards considered the consumption of one peanut butter sandwich and one bowl of soup in one twenty four hour period a wholly inadequate level of nutrition.I tucked the ends of the quilt in, sarong fashion, just above my breasts, and picking up my trailing skirts, followed the scent of food downstairs.The smelland the clinking, clattering, sloshing noises of a number of people eatingwere coming from a closed door on the first floor above ground level.I pushed it open, and found myself at the end of a long room equipped as a refectory.The table was surrounded by twenty odd women, a few gowned for day, but most of them in a state of dishabille that made my quilt modest by comparison.A woman near the end of the table caught sight of me hovering in the doorway, and beckoned, companionably sliding over to make room for me on the end of the long bench.Youll be the new lass, aye?she said, looking me over with interest.Youre a wee bit older than Madame usually takes onshe likes em no more than five and twenty.Youre no bad at all, though, she assured me hastily.Im sure youll do fine.Good skin and a pretty face, observed the dark haired lady across from us, sizing me up with the detached air of one appraising horseflesh.And nice bubbies, what I can see.She lifted her chin slightly, peering across the table at what could be seen of my cleavage.Madame doesna like us to take the kivvers off the beds, my original acquaintance said reprovingly.Ye should wear your shift, if ye havena something pretty to show yourself in yet.Aye, be careful with the quilt, advised the dark haired girl, still scrutinizing me.Madamell dock your wages, an ye get spots on the bedclothes.Whats your name, my dearie?A short, rather plump girl with a round, friendly face leaned past the dark girls elbow to smile at me.Here were all chatterin at ye, and not welcomed ye proper at all.Im Dorcas, this is Peggyshe jerked a thumb at the dark haired girl, then pointed across the table to the fair haired woman beside meand thats Mollie.My name is Claire, I said, smiling and hitching the quilt a bit higher in self consciousness.I wasnt sure how to correct their impression that I was Madame Jeannes newest recruit; for the moment, that seemed less important than getting some breakfast.Apparently divining my need, the friendly Dorcas reached to the sideboard behind her, passed me a wooden plate, and shoved a large dish of sausages in my direction.The food was well cooked and would have been good in any case; starved as I was, it was ambrosial.A hell of a lot better than the hospital cafeterias breakfasts, I observed to myself, taking another ladle of fried potatoes.Had a rough one for your first, aye?Millie, next to me, nodded at my bosom.Glancing down, I was mortified to see a large red patch peeking above the edge of my quilt.I couldnt see my neck, but the direction of Millies interested gaze made it clear that the small tingling sensations there were evidence of further bite marks.Your nose is a wee bit puffed, too, Peggy said, frowning at me critically.She reached across the table to touch it, disregarding the fact that the gesture caused her flimsy wrap to fall open to the waist.Slap ye, did he?If they get too rough, ye should call out, ye know; Madame doesna allow the customers to mistreat usgive a good screech and Bruno will be in there in a moment.Bruno?I said, a little faintly.The porter, Dorcas explained, busily spooning eggs into her mouth.Big as a bearthats why we call him Bruno.Whats his name really?she asked the table at large, Horace?Theobald, corrected Millie.She turned to call to a servingmaid at the end of the room, Janie, will ye fetch in more ale?The new lassies had none yet!Aye, Peggys right, she said, turning back to me.She wasnt at all pretty, but had a nicely shaped mouth and a pleasant expression.If ye get a man likes to play a bit rough, thats one thingand dont sic Bruno on a good customer, or therell be hell to pay, and youll do the paying.But if ye think ye might really be damaged, then just give a good skelloch.Brunos never far away during the night.Oh, heres the ale, she added, taking a big pewter mug from the servingmaid and plonking it in front of me.Shes no damaged, Dorcas said, having completed her survey of the visible aspects of my person.A bit sore between the legs, though, aye?she said shrewdly, grinning at me.Ooh, look, shes blushing, said Mollie, giggling with delight.Ooh, you are a fresh one, arent ye?I took a deep gulp of the ale.It was dark, rich, and extremely welcome, as much for the width of the cup rim that hid my face as for its taste.Never mind.Mollie patted my arm kindly.After breakfast, Ill show ye where the tubs are.Ye can soak your parts in warm water, and theyll be good as new by tonight.Be sure to show her where the jars are, too, put in Dorcas.Sweet herbs, she explained to me.Put them in the water before ye sit in it.Madame likes us to smell sweet.Eef ze men want to lie wiz a feesh, zey would go to ze docks; eet ees more cheap, Peggy intoned, in what was patently meant to be an imitation of Madame Jeanne.The table erupted in giggles, which were rapidly quelled by the sudden appearance of Madame herself, who entered through a door at the end of the room.Madame Jeanne was frowning in a worried fashion, and seemed too preoccupied to notice the smothered hilarity.Tsk!murmured Mollie, seeing the proprietor.An early customer.I hate it when they come in the middle o breakfast, she grumbled.Stop ye digesting your food proper, it does.Ye neednt worry, Mollie; its Clairell have to take him, Peggy said, tossing her dark plait out of the way.Newest lass takes the ones no one wants, she informed me.Stick your finger up his bum, Dorcas advised me.That brings em off faster than anything.Ill save ye a bannock for after, if ye like.Erthanks, I said.Just then, Madame Jeannes eye lit upon me, and her mouth dropped open in a horrified O.   What are you doing here?she hissed, rushing up to grab me by the arm.Eating, I said, in no mood to be snatched at.I detached my arm from her grasp and picked up my ale cup.Merde!she said.Did no one bring you food this morning?No, I said.Nor yet clothes.I gestured at the quilt, which was in imminent danger of falling off.Nez de Cleopatre!she said violently.She stood up and glanced around the room, eyes flashing daggers.I will have the worthless scum of a maid flayed for this!A thousand apologies, Madame!Thats quite all right, I said graciously, aware of the looks of astonishment on the faces of my breakfast companions.Ive had a wonderful meal.Nice to have met you all, ladies, I said, rising and doing my best to bow graciously while clutching my quilt.Now, Madameabout my gown?Amid Madame Jeannes agitated protestations of apology, and reiterated hopes that I would not find it necessary to tell Monsieur Fraser that I had been exposed to an undesirable intimacy with the working members of the establishment, I made my clumsy way up two more flights of stairs, and into a small room draped with hanging garments in various stages of completion, with bolts of cloth stacked here and there in the corners of the chamber.A moment, please, Madame Jeanne said, and with a deep bow, left me to the company of a dressmakers dummy, with a large number of pins protruding from its stuffed bosom.Apparently this was where the costuming of the inmates took place.I walked around the room, quilt trailing, and observed several flimsy silk wrappers under construction, together with a couple of elaborate gowns with very low necks, and a number of rather imaginative variations on the basic shift and camisole.I removed one shift from its hook, and put it on.It was made of fine cotton, with a low, gathered neck, and embroidery in the form of multiple hands that curled enticingly under the bosom and down the sides of the waist, spreading out into a rakish caress atop the hips.It hadnt been hemmed, but was otherwise complete, and gave me a great deal more freedom of movement than had the quilt.I could hear voices in the next room, where Madame was apparently haranguing Brunoor so I deduced the identity of the male rumble.I do not care what the miserable girls sister has done, she was saying, do you not realize that the wife of Monsieur Jamie was left naked and starving  Are you sure shes his wife?the deep male voice asked.I had heard  So had I.  But if he says this woman is his wife, I am not disposed to argue, nest ce pas?Madame sounded impatient.Now, as to this wretched Madeleine  Its not her fault, Madame, Bruno broke in.Have you not heard the news this morningabout the Fiend?Madame gave a small gasp.No!Not another?Yes, Madame.Brunos voice was grim.No more than a few doors awayabove the Green Owl tavern.The girl was Madeleines sister; the priest brought the news just before breakfast.So you can see  Yes, I see.Madame sounded a little breathless.Yes, of course.Of course.Was itthe same?Her voice quivered with distaste.Yes, Madame.A hatchet or a big knife of some sort.He lowered his voice, as people do when recounting horrid things.The priest told me that her head had been completely severed.Her body was near the door of her room, and her headhis voice dropped even lower, almost to a whisperher head was sitting on the mantelpiece, looking into the room.The landlord swooned when he found her.A heavy thud from the next room suggested that Madame Jeanne had done likewise.Gooseflesh rippled up my arms, and my own knees felt a trifle watery.I was beginning to agree with Jamies fear that his installing me in a house of prostitution had been injudicious.At any rate, I was now clad, if not entirely dressed, and I went into the room next door, to find Madame Jeanne in semi recline on the sofa of a small parlor, with a burly, unhappy looking man sitting on the hassock near her feet.Madame started up at the sight of me.Madame Fraser!Oh, I am so sorry!I did not mean to leave you waiting, but I have had she hesitated, looking for some delicate expression some distressing news.Id say so, I said.Whats this about a Fiend?You heard?She was already pale; now her complexion went a few shades whiter, and she wrung her hands.What will he say?He will be furious!she moaned.Who?I asked.Jamie, or the Fiend?Your husband, she said.She looked about the parlor, distracted.When he hears that his wife has been so shamefully neglected, mistaken for a fille de joie and exposed toto  I really dont think hell mind, I said.But I would like to hear about the Fiend.You would?Brunos heavy eyebrows rose.He was a big man, with sloping shoulders and long arms that made him look rather like a gorilla; a resemblance enhanced by a low brow and a receding chin.He looked eminently suited to the role of bouncer in a brothel.Well, he hesitated, glancing at Madame Jeanne for guidance, but the proprietor caught sight of the small enameled clock on the mantelpiece and jumped to her feet with an exclamation of shock.Crottin!she exclaimed.I must go!And with no more than a perfunctory wave in my direction, she sped from the room, leaving Bruno and me looking after her in surprise.Oh, he said, recovering himself.Thats right, it was coming at ten oclock.It was a quarter past ten, by the enamel clock.Whatever it was, I hoped it would wait.Fiend, I prompted.Like most people, Bruno was only too willing to reveal all the gory details, once past a pro forma demur for the sake of social delicacy.The Edinburgh Fiend wasas I had deduced from the conversation thus fara murderer.Like an early day Jack the Ripper, he specialized in women of easy virtue, whom he killed with blows from a heavy bladed instrument.In some cases, the bodies had been dismembered or otherwise interfered with, as Bruno said, in lowered voice.The killingseight in allhad occurred at intervals over the last two years.With one exception, the women had been killed in their own rooms; most lived alonetwo had been killed in brothels.Hence Madames agitation, I supposed.What was the exception?I asked.Bruno crossed himself.A nun, he whispered, the words evidently still a shock to him.A French Sister of Mercy.The Sister, coming ashore at Edinburgh with a group of nuns bound for London, had been abducted from the docks, without any of her companions noticing her absence in the confusion.By the time she was discovered in one of Edinburghs wynds, after nightfall, it was far too late.Raped?I asked, with clinical interest.Bruno eyed me with considerable suspicion.I do not know, he said formally.He rose heavily to his feet, his simian shoulders drooping with fatigue.I supposed he had been on duty all night; it must be his bedtime now.If you will excuse me, Madame, he said, with remote formality, and went out.I sat back on the small velvet sofa, feeling mildly dazed.Somehow I hadnt realized that quite so much went on in brothels in the daytime.There was a sudden loud hammering at the door.It didnt sound like knocking, but as though someone really were using a metal headed hammer to demand admittance.I got to my feet to answer the summons, but without further warning, the door burst open, and a slender imperious figure strode into the room, speaking French in an accent so pronounced and an attitude so furious that I could not follow it all.Are you looking for Madame Jeanne?I managed to put in, seizing a small pause when he stopped to draw breath for more invective.The visitor was a young man of about thirty, slightly built and strikingly handsome, with thick black hair and brows.He glared at me under these, and as he got a good look at me, an extraordinary change went across his face.The brows rose, his black eyes grew huge, and his face went white.Milady!he exclaimed, and flung himself on his knees, embracing me about the thighs as he pressed his face into the cotton shift at crotch level.Let go!I exclaimed, shoving at his shoulders to detach him.I dont work here.Let go, I say!Milady!he was repeating in tones of rapture.Milady!You have come back!A miracle!God has restored you!He looked up at me, smiling as tears streamed down his face.He had large white perfect teeth.Suddenly memory stirred and shifted, showing me the outlines of an urchins face beneath the mans bold visage.Fergus!I said.Fergus, is that really you?Get up, for Gods sakelet me see you!He rose to his feet, but didnt pause to let me inspect him.He gathered me into a rib cracking hug, and I clutched him in return, pounding his back in the excitement of seeing him again.He had been ten or so when I last saw him, just before Culloden.Now he was a man, and the stubble of his beard rasped against my cheek.I thought I was seeing a ghost!he exclaimed.It is really you, then?Yes, its me, I assured him.You have seen milord?he asked excitedly.He knows you are here?Yes.Oh!He blinked and stepped back half a pace, as something occurred to him.Butbut what about He paused, clearly confused.What about what?There ye are!What in the name of God are ye doing up here, Fergus?Jamies tall figure loomed suddenly in the doorway.His eyes widened at the sight of me in my embroidered shift.Where are your clothes?he asked.Never mind, he said then, waving his hand impatiently as I opened my mouth to answer.I havena time just now.Come along, Fergus, theres eighteen ankers of brandy in the alleyway, and the excisemen on my heels!And with a thunder of boots on the wooden staircase, they were gone, leaving me alone once more.I wasnt sure whether I should join the party downstairs or not, but curiosity got the better of discretion.After a quick visit to the sewing room in search of more extensive covering, I made my way down, a large shawl half embroidered with hollyhocks flung round my shoulders.I had gathered only a vague impression of the layout of the house the night before, but the street noises that filtered through the windows made it clear which side of the building faced the High Street.I assumed the alleyway to which Jamie had referred must be on the other side, but wasnt sure.The houses of Edinburgh were frequently constructed with odd little wings and twisting walls, to take advantage of every inch of space.I paused on the large landing at the foot of the stairs, listening for the sound of rolling casks as a guide.As I stood there, I felt a sudden draft on my bare feet, and turned to see a man standing in the open doorway from the kitchen.He seemed as surprised as I, but after blinking at me, he smiled and stepped forward to grip me by the elbow.And a good morning to you, my dear.I didnt expect to find any of you ladies up and about so early in the morning.Well, you know what they say about early to bed and early to rise, I said, trying to extricate my elbow.He laughed, showing rather badly stained teeth in a narrow jaw.No, what do they say about it?Well, its something they say in America, come to think of it, I replied, suddenly realizing that Benjamin Franklin, even if currently publishing, probably didnt have a wide readership in Edinburgh.Got a wit about you, chuckie, he said, with a slight smile.Send you down as a decoy, did she?No.Who?I said.The madam, he said, glancing around.Where is she?I have no idea, I said.Let go!Instead, he tightened his grip, so that his fingers dug uncomfortably into the muscles of my upper arm.He leaned closer, whispering in my ear with a gust of stale tobacco fumes.Theres a reward, you know, he murmured confidentially.A percentage of the value of the seized contraband.No one would need to know but you and me.He flicked one finger gently under my breast, making the nipple stand up under the thin cotton.What dye say, chuck?I stared at him.The excisemen are on my heels, Jamie had said.This must be one, then; an officer of the Crown, charged with the prevention of smuggling and the apprehension of smugglers.What had Jamie said?The pillory, transportation, flogging, imprisonment, ear nailing, waving an airy hand as though such penalties were the equivalent of a traffic ticket.Whatever are you talking about?I said, trying to sound puzzled.And for the last time, let go of me!He couldnt be alone, I thought.How many others were there around the building?Yes, please let go, said a voice behind me.I saw the excisemans eyes widen as he glanced over my shoulder.Mr.Willoughby stood on the second stair in rumpled blue silk, a large pistol gripped in both hands.He bobbed his head politely at the excise officer.Not stinking whore, he explained, blinking owlishly.Honorable wife.The exciseman, clearly startled by the unexpected appearance of a Chinese, gawked from me to Mr.Willoughby and back again.Wife?he said disbelievingly.You say shes your wife?Mr.Willoughby, clearly catching only the salient word, nodded pleasantly.Wife, he said again.Please letting go.His eyes were mere bloodshot slits, and it was apparent to me, if not to the exciseman, that his blood was still approximately 80 proof.The exciseman pulled me toward himself and scowled at Mr.Willoughby.Now, listen here he began.He got no further, for Mr.Willoughby, evidently assuming that he had given fair warning, raised the pistol and pulled the trigger.There was a loud crack, an even louder shriek, which must have been mine, and the landing was filled with a cloud of gray powder smoke.The exciseman staggered back against the paneling, a look of intense surprise on his face, and a spreading rosette of blood on the breast of his coat.Moving by reflex, I leapt forward and grasped the man under the arms, easing him gently down to the floorboards of the landing.There was a flurry of noise from above, as the inhabitants of the house crowded chattering and exclaiming onto the upper landing, attracted by the shot.Bounding footsteps came up the lower stairs two at a time.Fergus burst through what must be the cellar door, a pistol in his hand.Milady, he gasped, catching sight of me sitting in the corner with the excisemans body sprawled across my lap.What have you done?Me?I said indignantly.I havent done anything; its Jamies pet Chinaman.I nodded briefly toward the stair, where Mr.Willoughby, the pistol dropped unregarded by his feet, had sat down on the step and was now regarding the scene below with a benign and bloodshot eye.Fergus said something in French that was too colloquial to translate, but sounded highly uncomplimentary to Mr.Willoughby.He strode across the landing, and reached out a hand to grasp the little Chinamans shoulderor so I assumed, until I saw that the arm he extended did not end in a hand, but in a hook of gleaming dark metal.Fergus!I was so shocked at the sight that I stopped my attempts to stanch the excisemans wound with my shawl.Whatwhat I said incoherently.What?he said, glancing at me.Then, following the direction of my gaze, said, Oh, that, and shrugged.The English.Dont worry about it, milady, we havent time.You, canaille, get downstairs!He jerked Mr.Willoughby off the stairs, dragged him to the cellar door and shoved him through it, with a callous disregard for safety.I could hear a series of bumps, suggesting that the Chinese was rolling downstairs, his acrobatic skills having temporarily deserted him, but had no time to worry about it.Fergus squatted next to me, and lifted the excisemans head by the hair.How many companions are with you?he demanded.Tell me quickly, cochon, or I slit your throat!From the evident signs, this was a superfluous threat.The mans eyes were already glazing over.With considerable effort, the corners of his mouth drew back in a smile.Ill seeyouburninhell, he whispered, and with a last convulsion that fixed the smile in a hideous rictus upon his face, he coughed up a startling quantity of bright red foamy blood, and died in my lap.More feet were coming up the stairs at a high rate of speed.Jamie charged through the cellar door and barely stopped himself before stepping on the excise officers trailing legs.His eyes traveled up the bodys length and rested on my face with horrified amazement.What have ye done, Sassenach?he demanded.Not herthe yellow pox, Fergus put in, saving me the trouble.He thrust the pistol into his belt and offered me his real hand.Come, milady, you must get downstairs!Jamie forestalled him, bending over me as he jerked his head in the direction of the front hall.Ill manage here, he said.Guard the front, Fergus.The usual signal, and keep your pistol hidden unless theres need.Fergus nodded and vanished at once through the door to the hall.Jamie had succeeded in bundling the corpse awkwardly in the shawl; he lifted it off me, and I scrambled to my feet, greatly relieved to be rid of it, in spite of the blood and other objectionable substances soaking the front of my shift.Ooh!I think hes dead!An awestruck voice floated down from above, and I looked up to see a dozen prostitutes peering down like cherubim from on high.Get back to your rooms!Jamie barked.There was a chorus of frightened squeals, and they scattered like pigeons.Jamie glanced around the landing for traces of the incident, but luckily there were nonethe shawl and I had caught everything.Come on, he said.The stairs were dim and the cellar at the foot pitch black.I stopped at the bottom, waiting for Jamie.The exciseman had not been lightly built, and Jamie was breathing hard when he reached me.Across to the far side, he said, gasping.A false wall.Hold my arm.With the door above shut, I couldnt see a thing; luckily Jamie seemed able to steer by radar.He led me unerringly past large objects that I bumped in passing, and finally came to a halt.I could smell damp stone, and putting out a hand, felt a rough wall before me.Jamie said something loudly in Gaelic.Apparently it was the Celtic equivalent of Open Sesame, for there was a short silence, then a grating noise, and a faint glowing line appeared in the darkness before me.The line widened into a slit, and a section of the wall swung out, revealing a small doorway, made of a wooden framework, upon which cut stones were mounted so as to look like part of the wall.The concealed cellar was a large room, at least thirty feet long.Several figures were moving about, and the air was ripely suffocating with the smell of brandy.Jamie dumped the body unceremoniously in a corner, then turned to me.God, Sassenach, are ye all right?The cellar seemed to be lighted with candles, dotted here and there in the dimness.I could just see his face, skin drawn tight across his cheekbones.Im a little cold, I said, trying not to let my teeth chatter.My shift is soaked with blood.Otherwise Im all right.I think.Jeanne!He turned and called toward the far end of the cellar, and one of the figures came toward us, resolving itself into a very worried looking madam.He explained the situation in a few words, causing the worried expression to grow considerably worse.Horreur!she said.Killed?On my premises?With witnesses?Aye, Im afraid so.Jamie sounded calm.Ill manage about it.But in the meantime, ye must go up.He might not have been alone.Youll know what to do.His voice held a tone of calm assurance, and he squeezed her arm.The touch seemed to calm herI hoped that was why he had done itand she turned to leave.Oh, and Jeanne, Jamie called after her.When ye come back, can ye bring down some clothes for my wife?If her gowns not ready, I think Daphne is maybe the right size.Clothes?Madame Jeanne squinted into the shadows where I stood.I helpfully stepped out into the light, displaying the results of my encounter with the exciseman.Madame Jeanne blinked once or twice, crossed herself, and turned without a word, to disappear through the concealed doorway, which swung to behind her with a muffled thud.I was beginning to shake, as much with reaction as with the cold.Accustomed as I was to emergency, blood, and even sudden death, the events of the morning had been more than a little harrowing.It was like a bad Saturday night in the emergency room.Come along, Sassenach, Jamie said, putting a hand gently on the small of my back.Well get ye washed.His touch worked on me as well as it had on Madame Jeanne; I felt instantly better, if still apprehensive.Washed?In what?Brandy?He gave a slight laugh at that.No, water.I can offer ye a bathtub, but Im afraid it will be cold.It was extremely cold.Wh wh where did this water come from?I asked, shivering.Off a glacier?The water gushed out of a pipe set in the wall, normally kept plugged with an insanitary looking wad of rags, wrapped to form a rough seal around the chunk of wood that served as a plug.I pulled my hand out of the chilly stream and wiped it on the shift, which was too far gone for anything to make much difference.Jamie shook his head as he maneuvered the big wooden tub closer to the spout.Off the roof, he answered.Theres a rainwater cistern up there.The guttering pipe runs down the side of the building, and the cistern pipe is hidden inside it.He looked absurdly proud of himself, and I laughed.Quite an arrangement, I said.What do you use the water for?To cut the liquor, he explained.He gestured at the far side of the room, where the shadowy figures were working with notable industry among a large array of casks and tubs.It comes in a hundred and eighty degrees above proof.We mix it here wi pure water, and recask it for sale to the taverns.He shoved the rough plug back into the pipe, and bent to pull the big tub across the stone floor.Here, well take it out of the way; theyll be needing the water.One of the men was in fact standing by with a small cask clasped in his arms; with no more than a curious glance at me, he nodded to Jamie and thrust the cask beneath the stream of water.Behind a hastily arranged screen of empty barrels, I peered dubiously down into the depths of my makeshift tub.A single candle burned in a puddle of wax nearby, glimmering off the surface of the water and making it look black and bottomless.I stripped off, shivering violently, thinking that the comforts of hot water and modern plumbing had seemed a hell of a lot easier to renounce when they were close at hand.Jamie groped in his sleeve and pulled out a large handkerchief, at which he squinted dubiously.Aye, well, its maybe cleaner than your shift, he said, shrugging.He handed it to me, then excused himself to oversee operations at the other end of the room.The water was freezing and so was the cellar, and as I gingerly sponged myself, the icy trickles running down my stomach and thighs brought on small fits of shivering.Thoughts of what might be happening overhead did little to ease my feelings of chilly apprehension.Presumably, we were safe enough for the moment, so long as the false cellar wall deceived any searching excisemen.But if the wall failed to hide us, our position was all but hopeless.There appeared to be no way out of this room but by the door in the false walland if that wall were breached, we would not only be caught red handed in possession of quite a lot of contraband brandy, but also in custody of the body of a murdered Kings Officer.And surely the disappearance of that officer would provoke an intensive search?I had visions of excisemen combing the brothel, questioning and threatening the women, emerging with complete descriptions of myself, Jamie, and Mr.Willoughby, as well as several eyewitness accounts of the murder.Involuntarily, I glanced at the far corner, where the dead man lay beneath his bloodstained shroud, covered with pink and yellow hollyhocks.The Chinaman was nowhere to be seen, having apparently passed out behind the ankers of brandy.Here, Sassenach.Drink this; your teeth are chattering so, youre like to bite through your tongue.Jamie had reappeared by my seal hole like a St.Bernard dog, bearing a firkin of brandy.Th thanks.I had to drop the washcloth and use both hands to steady the wooden cup so it wouldnt clack against my teeth, but the brandy helped; it dropped like a flaming coal into the pit of my stomach and sent small curling tendrils of warmth through my frigid extremities as I sipped.Oh, God, thats better, I said, stopping long enough to gasp for breath.Is this the uncut version?No, that would likely kill ye.This is maybe a little stronger than what we sell, though.Finish up and put something on; then ye can have a bit more.Jamie took the cup from my hand and gave me back the handkerchief washcloth.As I hurriedly finished my chilly ablutions, I watched him from the corner of my eye.He was frowning as he gazed at me, clearly deep in thought.I had imagined that his life was complicated; it hadnt escaped me that my presence was undoubtedly complicating it a good bit more.I would have given a lot to know what he was thinking.What are you thinking about, Jamie?I said, watching him sidelong as I swabbed the last of the smudges from my thighs.The water swirled around my calves, disturbed by my movements, and the candlelight lit the waves with sparks, as though the dark blood I had washed from my body now glowed once more live and red in the water.The frown vanished momentarily as his eyes cleared and fixed on my face.I am thinking that youre verra beautiful, Sassenach, he said softly.Maybe if one has a taste for gooseflesh on a large scale, I said tartly, stepping out of the tub and reaching for the cup.He grinned suddenly at me, teeth flashing white in the dimness of the cellar.Oh, aye, he said.Well, youre speaking to the only man in Scotland who has a terrible cockstand at sight of a plucked chicken.I spluttered in my brandy and choked, half hysterical from tension and terror.Jamie quickly shrugged out of his coat and wrapped the garment around me, hugging me close against him as I shivered and coughed and gasped.Makes it hard to pass a poulterers stall and stay decent, he murmured in my ear, briskly rubbing my back through the fabric.Hush, Sassenach, hush now.Itll be fine.I clung to him, shaking.Im sorry, I said.Im all right.Its my fault, though.Mr.Willoughby shot the exciseman because he thought he was making indecent advances to me.Jamie snorted.That doesna make it your fault, Sassenach, he said dryly.And for what its worth, its no the first time the Chinamans done something foolish, either.When hes drink taken, hell do anything, and never mind how mad it is.Suddenly Jamies expression changed as he realized what I had said.He stared down at me, eyes wide.Did ye say exciseman, Sassenach?Yes, why?He didnt answer, but let go my shoulders and whirled on his heel, snatching the candle off the cask in passing.Rather than be left in the dark, I followed him to the corner where the corpse lay under its shawl.Hold this.Jamie thrust the candle unceremoniously into my hand and knelt by the shrouded figure, pulling back the stained fabric that covered the face.I had seen quite a few dead bodies; the sight was no shock, but it still wasnt pleasant.The eyes had rolled up beneath half closed lids, which did nothing to help the generally ghastly effect.Jamie frowned at the dead face, drop jawed and waxy in the candlelight, and muttered something under his breath.Whats wrong?I asked.I had thought I would never be warm again, but Jamies coat was not only thick and well made, it held the remnants of his own considerable body heat.I was still cold, but the shivering had eased.This isna an exciseman, Jamie said, still frowning.I know all the Riding Officers in the district, and the superintending officers, too.But Ive no seen this fellow before.With some distaste, he turned back the sodden flap of the coat and groped inside.He felt about gingerly but thoroughly inside the mans clothing, emerging at last with a small penknife, and a small booklet bound in red paper.New Testament, I read, with some astonishment.Jamie nodded, looking up at me with one brow raised.Exciseman or no, it seems a peculiar thing to bring with ye to a kittle hoosie.He wiped the little booklet on the shawl, then drew the folds of fabric quite gently back over the face, and rose to his feet, shaking his head.Thats the only thing in his pockets.Any Customs inspector or exciseman must carry his warrant upon his person at all times, for otherwise hes no authority to carry out a search of premises or seize goods.He glanced up, eyebrows raised.Why did ye think he was an exciseman?I hugged the folds of Jamies coat around myself, trying to remember what the man had said to me on the landing.He asked me whether I was a decoy, and where the madam was.Then he said that there was a rewarda percentage of seized contraband, thats what he saidand that no one would know but him and me.And youd said there were excisemen after you, I added.So naturally I thought he was one.Then Mr.Willoughby turned up and things rather went to pot.Jamie nodded, still looking puzzled.Aye, well.I havena got any idea who he is, but its a good thing that he isna an exciseman.I thought at first something had come verra badly unstuck, but its likely all right.Unstuck?He smiled briefly.Ive an arrangement with the Superintending Customs Officer for the district, Sassenach.I gaped at him.Arrangement?He shrugged.Well, bribery then, if ye like to be straight out about it.He sounded faintly irritated.No doubt thats standard business procedure?I said, trying to sound tactful.One corner of his mouth twitched slightly.Aye, it is.Well, in any case, theres an understanding, as ye might say, between Sir Percival Turner and myself, and to find him sending excise officers into this place would worry me considerably.All right, I said slowly, mentally juggling all the half understood events of the morning, and trying to make a pattern of them.But in that case, what did you mean by telling Fergus the excisemen were on your heels?And why has everyone been racing round like chickens with their heads off?Oh, that.He smiled briefly, and took my arm, turning me away from the corpse at our feet.Well, its an arrangement, as I said.And part of it is that Sir Percival must satisfy his own masters in London, by seizing sufficient amounts of contraband now and again.So we see to it that hes given the opportunity.Wally and the lads brought down two wagonloads from the coast; one of the best brandy, and the other filled with spiled casks and the punked wine, topped off with a few ankers of cheap swill, just to give it all flavor.I met them just outside the city this morning, as we planned, and then we drove the wagons in, takin care to attract the attention of the Riding Officer, who just happened to be passing with a small number of dragoons.They came along and we led them a canty chase through the alleyways, until the time for me and the good tubs to part company wi Wally and his load of swill.Wally jumped off his wagon then, and made awa, and I drove like hell down here, wi two or three dragoons following, just for show, like.Looks well in a report, ye ken.He grinned at me, quoting, The smugglers escaped in spite of industrious pursuit, but His Majestys valiant soldiers succeeded in capturing an entire wagonload of spirits, valued at sixty pounds, ten shillings.Youll know the sort of thing?I expect so, I said.Then it was you and the good liquor that was arriving at ten?Madame Jeanne said  Aye, he said, frowning.She was meant to have the cellar door open and the ramp in place at ten sharpwe havena got long to get everything unloaded.She was bloody late this morning; I had to circle round twice to keep from bringing the dragoons straight to the door.She was a bit distracted, I said, remembering suddenly about the Fiend.I told Jamie about the murder at the Green Owl, and he grimaced, crossing himself.Poor lass, he said.I shuddered briefly at the memory of Brunos description, and moved closer to Jamie, who put an arm about my shoulders.He kissed me absently on the forehead, glancing again at the shawl covered shape on the ground.Well, whoever he was, if he wasna an exciseman, there are likely no more of them upstairs.We should be able to get out of here soon.Thats good.Jamies coat covered me to the knees, but I felt the covert glances cast from the far end of the room at my bare calves, and was all too uncomfortably aware that I was naked under it.Will we be going back to the printshop?What with one thing and another, I didnt think I wanted to take advantage of Madame Jeannes hospitality any longer than necessary.Maybe for a bit.Ill have to think.Jamies tone was abstracted, and I could see that his brow was furrowed in thought.With a brief hug, he released me, and began to walk about the cellar, staring meditatively at the stones underfoot.Erwhat did you do with Ian?He glanced up, looking blank; then his face cleared.Oh, Ian.I left him making inquiries at the taverns above the Market Cross.Ill need to remember to meet him, later, he muttered, as though making a note to himself.I met Young Ian, by the way, I said conversationally.Jamie looked startled.He came here?He did.Looking for youabout a quarter of an hour after you left, in fact.Thank God for small mercies!He rubbed a hand through his hair, looking simultaneously amused and worried.Id have had the devil of a time explaining to Ian what his son was doing here.You know what he was doing here?I asked curiously.No, I dont!He was supposed to beah, well, let it be.I canna be worrit about it just now.He relapsed into thought, emerging momentarily to ask, Did Young Ian say where he was going, when he left ye?I shook my head, gathering the coat around myself, and he nodded, sighed, and took up his slow pacing once more.I sat down on an upturned tub and watched him.In spite of the general atmosphere of discomfort and danger, I felt absurdly happy simply to be near him.Feeling that there was little I could do to help the situation at present, I settled myself with the coat wrapped round me, and abandoned myself to the momentary pleasure of looking at himsomething I had had no chance to do, in the tumult of events.In spite of his preoccupation, he moved with the surefooted grace of a swordsman, a man so aware of his body as to be able to forget it entirely.The men by the casks worked by torchlight; it gleamed on his hair as he turned, lighting it like a tigers fur, with stripes of gold and dark.I caught the faint twitch as two fingers of his right hand flickered together against the fabric of his breeches, and felt a strange little lurch of recognition in the gesture.I had seen him do that a thousand times as he was thinking, and seeing it now again, felt as though all the time that had passed in our separation was no more than the rising and setting of a single sun.As though catching my thought, he paused in his strolling and smiled at me.Youll be warm enough, Sassenach?he asked.No, but it doesnt matter.I got off my tub and went to join him in his peregrinations, slipping a hand through his arm.Making any progress with the thinking?He laughed ruefully.No.Im thinking of maybe half a dozen things together, and half of them things I canna do anything about.Like whether Young Ians where he should be.I stared up at him.Where he should be?Where do you think he should be?He should be at the printshop, Jamie said, with some emphasis.But he should ha been with Wally this morning, and he wasnt.With Wally?You mean you knew he wasnt at home, when his father came looking for him this morning?He rubbed his nose with a finger, looking at once irritated and amused.Oh, aye.Id promised Young Ian I wouldna say anything to his Da, though, until hed a chance to explain himself.Not that an explanation is likely to save his arse, he added.Young Ian had, as his father said, come to join his uncle in Edinburgh without the preliminary bother of asking his parents leave.Jamie had discovered this dereliction fairly quickly, but had not wanted to send his nephew alone back to Lallybroch, and had not yet had time to escort him personally.Its not that he canna look out for himself, Jamie explained, amusement winning in the struggle of expressions on his face.Hes a nice capable lad.Its justwell, ye ken how things just happen around some folk, without them seeming to have anything much to do wi it?Now that you mention it, yes, I said wryly.Im one of them.He laughed out loud at that.God, youre right, Sassenach!Maybe thats why I like Young Ian so well; he minds me of you.He reminded me a bit of you, I said.Jamie snorted briefly.God, Jenny will maim me, and she hears her baby sons been loitering about a house of ill repute.I hope the wee bugger has the sense to keep his mouth shut, once hes home.I hope he gets home, I said, thinking of the gawky almost fifteen year old I had seen that morning, adrift in an Edinburgh filled with prostitutes, excisemen, smugglers, and hatchet wielding Fiends.At least he isnt a girl, I added, thinking of this last item.The Fiend doesnt seem to have a taste for young boys.Aye, well, there are plenty of others who have, Jamie said sourly.Between Young Ian and you, Sassenach, I shall be lucky if my hairs not gone white by the time we get out of this stinking cellar.Me?I said in surprise.You dont need to worry about me.I dont?He dropped my arm and rounded on me, glaring.I dinna need to worry about ye?Is that what ye said?Christ!I leave ye safely in bed waiting for your breakfast, and not an hour later, I find ye downstairs in your shift, clutching a corpse to your bosom!And now youre standing in front of me bare as an egg, with fifteen men over there wondering who in hell ye areand how dye think Im going to explain ye to them, Sassenach?Tell me that, eh?He shoved a hand through his hair in exasperation.Sweet bleeding Jesus!And Ive to go up the coast in two days without fail, but I canna leave ye in Edinburgh, not wi Fiends creepin about with hatchets, and half the people whove seen ye thinking youre a prostitute, andand The lacing around his pigtail broke abruptly under the pressure, and his hair fluffed out round his head like a lions mane.I laughed.He glared for a moment longer, but then a reluctant grin made its way slowly through the frown.Aye, well, he said, resigned.I suppose Ill manage.I suppose you will, I said, and stood on tiptoe to brush his hair back behind his ears.Working on the same principle that causes magnets of opposing polarities to snap together when placed in close proximitry, he bent his head and kissed me.I had forgotten, he said, a moment later.Forgotten what?His back was warm through the thin shirt.Everything.He spoke very softly, mouth against my hair.Joy.Fear.Fear, most of all.His hand came up and smoothed my curls away from his nose.I havena been afraid for a verra long time, Sassenach, he whispered.But now I think I am.For there is something to be lost, now.I drew back a little, to look up at him.His arms were locked tight around my waist, his eyes dark as bottomless water in the dimness.Then his face changed and he kissed me quickly on the forehead.Come along, Sassenach, he said, taking me by the arm.Ill tell the men youre my wife.The rest of it will just have to bide.27  UP IN FLAMES  The dress was a trifle lower cut than necessary, and a bit tight in the bosom, but on the whole, not a bad fit.And how did you know Daphne would be the right size?I asked, spooning up my soup.I said I didna bed wi the lasses, Jamie replied circumspectly.I never said I didna look at them.He blinked at me like a large red owlsome congenital tic made him incapable of closing one eye in a winkand I laughed.That gown becomes ye a good deal more than it did Daphne, though.He cast a glance of general approval at my bosom and waved at a servingmaid carrying a platter of fresh bannocks.Moubrays tavern was doing a thriving dinner business.Several cuts above the snug, smoky atmosphere to be found in The Worlds End and similar serious drinking establishments, Moubrays was a large and elegant place, with an outside stair that ran up to the second floor, where a commodious dining room accommodated the appetites of Edinburghs prosperous tradesmen and public officials.Who are you at the moment?I asked.I heard Madame Jeanne call you Monsieur Fraserare you Fraser in public, though?He shook his head and broke a bannock into his soup bowl.No, at the moment, Im Sawney Malcolm, Printer and Publisher.Sawney?Thats a nickname for Alexander, is it?I should have thought Sandy was more like it, especially considering your hair.Not that his hair was sandy colored in the least, I reflected, looking at it.It was like Brees hairvery thick, with a slight wave to it, and all the colors of red and gold mixed; copper and cinnamon, auburn and amber, red and roan and rufous, all mingled together.I felt a sudden wave of longing for Bree; at the same time, I longed to untie Jamies hair from its formal plait and run my hands up under it, to feel the solid curve of his skull, and the soft strands tangled in my fingers.I could still recall the tickle of it, spilling loose and rich across my breasts in the morning light.My breath coming a little short, I bent my head to my oyster stew.Jamie appeared not to have noticed; he added a large pat of butter to his bowl, shaking his head as he did so.Sawneys what they say in the Highlands, he informed me.And in the Isles, too.Sandys more what yed hear in the Lowlandsor from an ignorant Sassenach.He lifted one eyebrow at me, smiling, and raised a spoonful of the rich, fragrant stew to his mouth.All right, I said.I suppose more to the point, thoughwho am I?He had noticed, after all.I felt one large foot nudge mine, and he smiled at me over the rim of his cup.Youre my wife, Sassenach, he said gruffly.Always.No matter who I may beyoure my wife.I could feel the flush of pleasure rise in my face, and see the memories of the night before reflected in his own.The tips of his ears were faintly pink.You dont suppose theres too much pepper in this stew?I asked, swallowing another spoonful.Are you sure, Jamie?Aye, he said.Aye, Im sure, he amended, and no, the peppers fine.I like a wee bit of pepper.The foot moved slightly against mine, the toe of his shoe barely brushing my ankle.So Im Mrs.Malcolm, I said, trying out the name on my tongue.The mere fact of saying Mrs.gave me an absurd little thrill, like a new bride.Involuntarily, I glanced down at the silver ring on my right fourth finger.Jamie caught the glance, and raised his cup to me.To Mrs.Malcolm, he said softly, and the breathless feeling came back.He set down the cup and took my hand; his own was big and so warm that a general feeling of glowing heat spread rapidly through my fingers.I could feel the silver ring, separate from my flesh, its metal heated by his touch.To have and to hold, he said, smiling.From this day forward, I said, not caring in the least that we were attracting interested glances from the other diners.Jamie bent his head and pressed his lips against the back of my hand, an action that turned the interested glances into frank stares.A clergyman was seated across the room; he glared at us and said something to his companions, who turned round to stare.One was a small, elderly man; the other, I was surprised to see, was Mr.Wallace, my companion from the Inverness coach.There are private rooms upstairs, Jamie murmured, blue eyes dancing over my knuckles, and I lost interest in Mr.Wallace.How interesting, I said.You havent finished your stew.Damn the stew.Here comes the servingmaid with the ale.Devil take her.Sharp white teeth closed gently on my knuckle, making me jerk slightly in my seat.People are watching you.Let them, and I trust theyve a fine day for it.His tongue flicked gently between my fingers.Theres a man in a green coat coming this way.To hell Jamie began, when the shadow of the visitor fell upon the table.A good day to you, Mr.Malcolm, said the visitor, bowing politely.I trust I do not intrude?You do, said Jamie, straightening up but keeping his grip on my hand.He turned a cool gaze on the newcomer.I think I do not know ye, sir?The gentleman, an Englishman of maybe thirty five, quietly dressed, bowed again, not intimidated by this marked lack of hospitality.I have not had the pleasure of your acquaintance as yet, sir, he said deferentially.My master, however, bade me greet you, and inquire whether youand your companionmight be so agreeable as to take a little wine with him.The tiny pause before the word companion was barely discernible, but Jamie caught it.His eyes narrowed.My wife and I, he said, with precisely the same sort of pause before wife, are otherwise engaged at the moment.Should your master wish to speak wi me  It is Sir Percival Turner who sends to ask, sir, the secretaryfor so he must beput in quickly.Well bred as he was, he couldnt resist a tiny flick of one eyebrow, as one who uses a name he expects to conjure with.Indeed, said Jamie dryly.Well, with all respect to Sir Percival, I am preoccupied at present.If you will convey him my regrets?He bowed, with a politeness so pointed as to come within a hair of rudeness, and turned his back on the secretary.That gentleman stood for a moment, his mouth slightly open, then pivoted smartly on his heel and made his way through the scatter of tables to a door on the far side of the dining room.Where was I?Jamie demanded.Oh, ayeto hell wi gentlemen in green coats.Now, about these private rooms  How are you going to explain me to people?I asked.He raised one eyebrow.Explain what?He looked me up and down.Why must I make excuses for ye?Youre no missing any limbs; youre not poxed, hunchbacked, toothless or lame  You know what I mean, I said, kicking him lightly under the table.The lady sitting near the wall nudged her companion and widened her eyes disapprovingly at us.I smiled nonchalantly at them.Aye, I do, he said, grinning.However, what wi Mr.Willoughbys activities this morning, and one thing and another, I havena had much chance to think about the matter.Perhaps Ill just say  My dear fellow, so you are married!Capital news!Simply capital!My deepest congratulations, and may I bedare I hope to be?the first to extend my felicitations and best wishes to your lady?A small, elderly gentleman in a tidy wig leaned heavily on a gold knobbed stick, beaming genially at us both.It was the little gentleman who had been sitting with Mr.Wallace and the clergyman.You will pardon the minor discourtesy of my sending Johnson to fetch you earlier, I am sure, he said deprecatingly.It is only that my wretched infirmity prevents rapid movement, as you see.Jamie had risen to his feet at the appearance of the visitor, and with a polite gesture, now drew out a chair.Youll join us, Sir Percival?he said.Oh, no, no indeed!Shouldnt dream of intruding on your new happiness, my dear sir.Truly, I had no idea Still protesting gracefully, he sank down into the proffered chair, wincing as he extended his foot beneath the table.I am a martyr to gout, my dear, he confided, leaning close enough for me to smell his foul old mans breath beneath the wintergreen that spiced his linen.He didnt look corrupt, I thoughtbreath notwithstandingbut then appearances could be deceiving; it was only about four hours since I had been mistaken for a prostitute.Making the best of it, Jamie called for wine, and accepted Sir Percivals continued effusions with some grace.It is rather fortunate that I should have encountered you here, my dear fellow, the elderly gentleman said, breaking off his flowery compliments at last.He laid a small, manicured hand on Jamies sleeve.I had something particular to say to you.In fact, I had sent a note to the printshop, but my messenger failed to find you there.Ah?Jamie cocked an eyebrow in question.Yes, Sir Percival went on.I believe you had spoken to mesome weeks ago, I scarce recall the occasionof your intention to travel north on business.A matter of a new press, or something of the sort?Sir Percival had quite a sweet face, I thought, handsomely patrician despite his years, with large, guileless blue eyes.Aye, thats so, Jamie agreed courteously.I am invited by Mr.McLeod of Perth, to see a new style of letterpress hes recently put in use.Quite.Sir Percival paused to remove a snuffbox from his pocket, a pretty thing enameled in green and gold, with cherubs on the lid.I really should not advise a trip to the north just now, he said, opening the box and concentrating on its contents.Really I should not.The weather is like to be inclement at this season; I am sure it would not suit Mrs.Malcolm.Smiling at me like an elderly angel, he inhaled a large pinch of snuff and paused, linen handkerchief at the ready.Jamie sipped at his wine, his face blandly composed.I am grateful for your advice, Sir Percival, he said.Youll perhaps have received word from your agents of recent storms to the north?Sir Percival sneezed, a small, neat sound, like a mouse with a cold.He was rather like a white mouse altogether, I thought, seeing him dab daintily at his pointed pink nose.Quite, he said again, putting away the kerchief and blinking benevolently at Jamie.No, I wouldas a particular friend with your welfare at heartmost strongly advise that you remain in Edinburgh.After all, he added, turning the beam of his benevolence on me, you surely have an inducement to remain comfortably at home now, do you not?And now, my dear young people, I am afraid I must take my leave; I must not detain you any longer from what must be your wedding breakfast.With a little assistance from the hovering Johnson, Sir Percival got up and tottered off, his gold knobbed stick tap tapping on the floor.He seems a nice old gent, I remarked, when I was sure he was far enough away not to hear me.Jamie snorted.Rotten as a worm riddled board, he said.He picked up his glass and drained it.Yed think otherwise, he said meditatively, putting it down and staring after the wizened figure, now cautiously negotiating the head of the stairs.A man as close as Sir Percival is to Judgment Day, I mean.Yed think fear o the Devil would prevent him, but not a bit.I suppose hes like everyone else, I said cynically.Most people think theyre going to live forever.Jamie laughed, his exuberant spirits returning with a rush.Aye, thats true, he said.He pushed my wineglass toward me.And now youre here, Sassenach, Im convinced of it.Drink up, mo nighean donn, and well go upstairs.Post coitum omne animalium triste est, I remarked, with my eyes closed.There was no response from the warm, heavy weight on my chest, save the gentle sigh of his breathing.After a moment, though, I felt a sort of subterranean vibration, which I interpreted as amusement.Thats a verra peculiar sentiment, Sassenach, Jamie said, his voice blurred with drowsiness.Not your own, I hope?No.I stroked the damp bright hair back from his forehead, and he turned his face into the curve of my shoulder, with a small contented snuffle.The private rooms at Moubrays left a bit to be desired in the way of amorous accommodation.Still, the sofa at least offered a padded horizontal surface, which, if you came right down to it, was all that was necessary.While I had decided that I was not past wanting to commit passionate acts after all, I was still too old to want to commit them on the bare floorboards.I dont know who said itsome ancient philosopher or other.It was quoted in one of my medical textbooks; in the chapter on the human reproductive system.The vibration made itself audible as a small chuckle.Yed seem to have applied yourself to your lessons to good purpose, Sassenach, he said.His hand passed down my side and wormed its way slowly underneath to cup my bottom.He sighed with contentment, squeezing slightly.I canna think when I have felt less triste, he said.Me either, I said, tracing the whorl of the small cowlick that lifted the hair from the center of his forehead.Thats what made me think of itI rather wondered what led the ancient philosopher to that conclusion.I suppose it depends on the sorts of animaliae hed been fornicating with, Jamie observed.Maybe it was just that none o them took to him, but he must ha tried a fair number, to make such a sweeping statement.He held tighter to his anchor as the tide of my laughter bounced him gently up and down.Mind ye, dogs sometimes do look a trifle sheepish when theyve done wi mating, he said.Mm.And how do sheep look, then?Aye, well, female sheep just go on lookin like sheepnot havin a great deal of choice in the matter, ye ken.Oh?And what do the male sheep look like?Oh, they look fair depraved.Let their tongues hang out, drooling, and their eyes roll back, while they make disgusting noises.Like most male animals, aye?I could feel the curve of his grin against my shoulder.He squeezed again, and I pulled gently on the ear closest to hand.I didnt notice your tongue hanging out.Ye werena noticing; your eyes were closed.I didnt hear any disgusting noises, either.Well, I couldna just think of any on the spur of the moment, he admitted.Perhaps Ill do better next time.We laughed softly together, and then were quiet, listening to each other breathe.Jamie, I said softly at last, smoothing the back of his head, I dont think Ive ever been so happy.He rolled to one side, shifting his weight carefully so as not to squash me, and lifted himself to lie face to face with me.Nor me, my Sassenach, he said, and kissed me, very lightly, but lingering, so that I had time just to close my lips in a tiny bite on the fullness of his lower lip.Its no just the bedding, ye ken, he said, drawing back a little at last.His eyes looked down at me, a soft deep blue like the warm tropic sea.No, I said, touching his cheek.It isnt.To have ye with me againto talk wi youto know I can say anything, not guard my words or hide my thoughtsGod, Sassenach, he said, the Lord knows I am lust crazed as a lad, and I canna keep my hands from youor anything else he added, wryly, but I would count that all well lost, had I no more than the pleasure of havin ye by me, and to tell ye all my heart.It was lonely without you, I whispered.So lonely.And me, he said.He looked down, long lashes hiding his eyes, and hesitated for a moment.I willna say that I have lived a monk, he said quietly.When I had towhen I felt that I must or go mad  I laid my fingers against his lips, to stop him.Neither did I, I said.Frank  His own hand pressed gently against my mouth.Both dumb, we looked at each other, and I could feel the smile growing behind my hand, and my own under his, to match it.I took my hand away.It doesna signify, he said.He took his hand off my mouth.No, I said.It doesnt matter.I traced the line of his lips with my finger.So tell me all your heart, I said.If theres time.He glanced at the window to gauge the lightwe were to meet Ian at the print shop at five oclock, to check the progress of the search for Young Ianand then rolled carefully off me.Theres two hours, at least, before we must go.Sit up and put your clothes on, and Ill have them bring some wine and biscuits.This sounded wonderful.I seemed to have been starving ever since I found him.I sat up and began to rummage through the pile of discarded clothes on the floor, looking for the set of stays the low necked gown required.Im no ways sad, but I do maybe feel a bit ashamed, Jamie observed, wriggling long, slender toes into a silk stocking.Or I should, at least.Why is that?Well, here I am, in paradise, so to speak, wi you and wine and biscuits, while Ians out tramping the pavements and worrying for his son.Are you worried about Young Ian?I asked, concentrating on my laces.He frowned slightly, pulling on the other stocking.Not so much worried for him, as afraid he may not turn up before tomorrow.What happens tomorrow?I asked, and then belatedly recalled the encounter with Sir Percival Turner.Oh, your trip to the norththat was supposed to be tomorrow?He nodded.Aye, theres a rendezvous set at Mullins Cove, tomorrow being the dark of the moon.A lugger from France, wi a load of wine and cambric.And Sir Percival was warning you not to make that rendezvous?So it seems.Whats happened, I canna say, though I expect Ill find out.Could be as theres a visiting Customs Officer in the district, or hes had word of some activity on the coast there that has nothing to do wi us, but could interfere.He shrugged and finished his last garter.He spread out his hands upon his knees then, palm up, and slowly curled the fingers inward.The left curled at once into a fist, compact and neat, a blunt instrument ready for battle.The fingers of his right hand curled more slowly; the middle finger was crooked, and would not lie along the second.The fourth finger would not curl at all, but stuck out straight, holding the little finger at an awkward angle beside it.He looked from his hands to me, smiling.Dye remember the night when ye set my hand?Sometimes, in my more horrible moments.That night was one to rememberonly because it couldnt be forgotten.Against all odds, I had rescued him from Wentworth Prison and a death sentencebut not in time to prevent his being cruelly tortured and abused by Black Jack Randall.I picked up his right hand and transferred it to my own knee.He let it lie there, warm, heavy and inert, and didnt object as I felt each finger, pulling gently to stretch the tendons and twisting to see the range of motion in the joints.My first orthopedic surgery, that was, I said wryly.Have ye done a great many things like that since?he asked curiously, looking down at me.Yes, a few.Im a surgeonbut it doesnt mean then what it means now, I added hastily.Surgeons in my time dont pull teeth and let blood.Theyre more like whats meant now by the word physiciana doctor with training in all the fields of medicine, but with a specialty.Special, are ye?Well, yeve always been that, he said, grinning.The crippled fingers slid into my palm and his thumb stroked my knuckles.What is it a surgeon does thats special, then?I frowned, trying to think of the right phrasing.Well, as best I can put ita surgeon tries to effect healingby means of a knife.His long mouth curled upward at the notion.A nice contradiction, that; but it suits ye, Sassenach.It does?I said, startled.He nodded, never taking his eyes off my face.I could see him studying me closely, and wondered self consciously what I must look like, flushed from lovemaking, with my hair in wild disorder.Ye havena been lovelier, Sassenach, he said, smile growing wider as I reached up to smooth my hair.He caught my hand, and kissed it gently.Leave your curls be.No, he said, holding my hands trapped while he looked me over, no, a knife is verra much what you are, now I think of it.A clever worked scabbard, and most gorgeous to see, Sassenachhe traced the line of my lips with a finger, provoking a smilebut tempered steel for a coreand a wicked sharp edge, I do think.Wicked?I said, surprised.Not heartless, I dont mean, he assured me.His eyes rested on my face, intent and curious.A smile touched his lips.No, never that.But you can be ruthless strong, Sassenach, when the need is on ye.I smiled, a little wryly.I can, I said.I have seen that in ye before, aye?His voice grew softer and his grasp on my hand tightened.But now I think ye have it much more than when ye were younger.Youll have needed it often since, no?I realized quite suddenly why he saw so clearly what Frank had never seen at all.You have it too, I said.And youve needed it.Often.Unconsciously, my fingers touched the jagged scar that crossed his middle finger, twisting the distal joints.He nodded.I have wondered, he said, so low I could scarcely hear him.Wondered often, if I could call that edge to my service, and sheathe it safe again.For I have seen a great many men grow hard in that calling, and their steel decay to dull iron.And I have wondered often, was I master in my soul, or did I become the slave of my own blade?I have thought again and again, he went on, looking down at our linked handsthat I had drawn my blade too often, and spent so long in the service of strife that I wasna fit any longer for human intercourse.My lips twitched with the urge to make a remark, but I bit them instead.He saw it, and smiled, a little wryly.I didna think I should ever laugh again in a womans bed, Sassenach, he said.Or even come to a woman, save as a brute, blind with need.A note of bitterness came into his voice.I lifted his hand, and kissed the small scar on the back of it.I cant see you as a brute, I said.I meant it lightly, but his face softened as he looked at me, and he answered seriously.I know that, Sassenach.And it is that ye canna see me so that gives me hope.For I amand know itand yet perhaps He trailed off, watching me intently.You have thatthe strength.Ye have it, and your soul as well.So perhaps my own may be saved.I had no notion what to say to this, and said nothing for a while, but only held his hand, caressing the twisted fingers and the large, hard knuckles.It was a warriors handbut he was not a warrior, now.I turned the hand over and smoothed it on my knee, palm up.Slowly, I traced the deep lines and rising hillocks, and the tiny letter C at the base of his thumb; the brand that marked him mine.I knew an old lady in the Highlands once, who said the lines in your hand dont predict your life; they reflect it.Is that so, then?His fingers twitched slightly, but his palm lay still and open.I dont know.She said youre born with the lines of your handwith a lifebut then the lines change, with the things you do, and the person you are.I knew nothing about palmistry, but I could see one deep line that ran from wrist to midpalm, forking several times.I think that might be the one they call a life line, I said.See all the forks?I suppose that would mean youd changed your life a lot, made a lot of choices.He snorted briefly, but with amusement rather than derision.Oh, aye?Well, thats safe enough to say.He peered into his palm, leaning over my knee.I suppose the first fork would be when I met Jack Randall, and the second when I wed yousee, theyre close together, there.So they are.I ran my finger slowly along the line, making his fingers twitch slightly as it tickled.And Culloden maybe would be another?Perhaps.But he did not wish to talk of Culloden.His own finger moved on.And when I went to prison, and came back again, and came to Edinburgh.And became a printer.I stopped and looked up at him, brows raised.How on earth did you come to be a printer?Its the last thing I would have thought of.Oh, that.His mouth widened in a smile.Wellit was an accident, aye?To start with he had only been looking for a business that would help to conceal and facilitate the smuggling.Possessed of a sizable sum from a recent profitable venture, he had determined to purchase a business whose normal operations involved a large wagon and team of horses, and some discreet premises that could be used for the temporary storage of goods in transit.Carting suggested itself, but was rejected precisely because the operations of that business made its practitioners subject to more or less constant scrutiny from the Customs.Likewise, the ownership of a tavern or inn, while superficially desirable because of the large quantities of supplies brought in, was too vulnerable in its legitimate operation to hide an illegitimate one; tax collectors and Customs agents hung about taverns like fleas on a fat dog.I thought of printing, when I went to a place to have some notices made up, he explained.As I was waiting to put in my order, I saw the wagon come rumbling up, all loaded wi boxes of paper and casks of alcohol for the ink powder, and I thought, by God, thats it!For excisemen would never be troubling a place like that.It was only after purchasing the shop in Carfax Close, hiring Geordie to run the press, and actually beginning to fill orders for posters, pamphlets, folios, and books, that the other possibilities of his new business had occurred to him.It was a man named Tom Gage, he explained.He loosed his hand from my grasp, growing eager in the telling, gesturing and rubbing his hands through his hair as he talked, disheveling himself with enthusiasm.He brought in small orders for this or thatinnocent stuff, all of itbut often, and stayed to talk over it, taking trouble to talk to me as well as to Geordie, though he must have seen I knew less about the business than he did himself.He smiled at me wryly.I didna ken much about printing, Sassenach, but I do ken men.It was obvious that Gage was exploring the sympathies of Alexander Malcolm; hearing the faint sibilance of Jamies Highland speech, he had prodded delicately, mentioning this acquaintance and that whose Jacobite sympathies had led them into trouble after the Rising, picking up the threads of mutual acquaintance, skillfully directing the conversation, stalking his prey.Until at last, the amused prey had bluntly told him to bring what he wanted made; no Kings man would hear of it.And he trusted you.It wasnt a question; the only man who had ever trusted Jamie Fraser in error was Charles Stuartand in that case, the error was Jamies.He did.And so an association was begun, strictly business in the beginning, but deepening into friendship as time went on.Jamie had printed all the materials generated by Gages small group of radical political writersfrom publicly acknowledged articles to anonymous broadsheets and pamphlets filled with material incriminating enough to get the authors summarily jailed or hanged.Wed go to the tavern down the street and talk, after the printing was done.I met a few of Toms friends, and finally Tom said I should write a small piece myself.I laughed and told him that with my hand, by the time Id penned anything that could be read, wed all be deadof old age, not hanging.I was standing by the press as we were talking, setting the type wi my left hand, not even thinking.He just stared at me, and then he started to laugh.He pointed at the tray, and at my hand, and went on laughing, til he had to sit down on the floor to stop.He stretched out his arms in front of him, flexing his hands and studying them dispassionately.He curled one hand into a fist and bent it slowly up toward his face, making the muscles of his arm ripple and swell under the linen.Im hale enough, he said.And with luck, may be so for a good many years yetbut not forever, Sassenach.I ha fought wi sword and dirk many times, but to every warrior comes the day when his strength will fail him.He shook his head and stretched out a hand toward his coat, which lay on the floor.I took these, that day wi Tom Gage, to remind me of it, he said.He took my hand and put into it the things he had taken from his pocket.They were cool, and hard to the touch, small heavy oblongs of lead.I didnt need to feel the incised ends to know what the letters on the type slugs were.Q. E. D. , I said.The English took my sword and dirk away, he said softly.His finger touched the slugs that lay in my palm.But Tom Gage put a weapon into my hands again, and I think I shall not lay it down.We walked arm in arm down the cobbled slope of the Royal Mile at a quarter to five, suffused with a glow engendered by several bowls of well peppered oyster stew and a bottle of wine, shared at intervals during our private communications.The city glowed all around us, as though sharing our happiness.Edinburgh lay under a haze that would soon thicken to rain again, but for now, the light of the setting sun hung gold and pink and red in the clouds, and shone in the wet patina of the cobbled street, so that the gray stones of the buildings softened and streamed with reflected light, echoing the glow that warmed my cheeks and shone in Jamies eyes when he looked at me.Drifting down the street in this state of softheaded self absorption, it was several minutes before I noticed anything amiss.A man, impatient of our meandering progress, stepped briskly around us, and then came to a dead stop just in front of me, making me trip on the wet stones and throw a shoe.He flung up his head and stared skyward for a moment, then hurried off down the street, not running, but walking as fast as he could go.Whats the matter with him?I said, stooping to retrieve my shoe.Suddenly I noticed that all around us, folk were stopping, staring up, and then starting to rush down the street.What do you think?I began, but when I turned to Jamie, he too was staring intently upward.I looked up, too, and it took only a moment to see that the red glow in the clouds above was a good deal deeper than the general color of the sunset sky, and seemed to flicker in an uneasy fashion most uncharacteristic of sunsets.Fire, he said.God, I think its in Leith Wynd!At the same moment, someone farther down the street raised the cry of Fire!and as though this official diagnosis had given them leave to run at last, the hurrying figures below broke loose and cascaded down the street like a herd of lemmings, anxious to fling themselves into the pyre.A few saner souls ran upwards, past us, also shouting Fire!but presumably with the intent of alerting whatever passed for a fire department.Jamie was already in motion, tugging me along as I hopped awkwardly on one foot.Rather than stop, I kicked the other shoe off, and followed him, slipping and stubbing my toes on the cold wet cobbles as I ran.The fire was not in Leith Wynd, but next door, in Carfax Close.The mouth of the close was choked with excited onlookers, shoving and craning in an effort to see, shouting incoherent questions at one another.The smell of smoke struck hot and pungent through the damp evening air, and waves of crackling heat beat against my face as I ducked into the close.Jamie didnt hesitate, but plunged into the crowd, making a path by main force.I pressed close behind him before the human waves could close again, and elbowed my way through, unable to see anything but Jamies broad back ahead of me.Then we popped out in the front of the crowd, and I could see all too well.Dense clouds of gray smoke rolled out of both the printshops lower windows, and I could hear a whispering, crackling noise that rose above the noise of the spectators as though the fire were talking to itself.My press!With a cry of anguish, Jamie darted up the front step and kicked in the door.A cloud of smoke rolled out of the open doorway and engulfed him like a hungry beast.I caught a brief glimpse of him, staggering from the impact of the smoke; then he dropped to his knees and crawled into the building.Inspired by this example, several men from the crowd ran up the steps of the printshop, and likewise disappeared into the smoke filled interior.The heat was so intense that I felt my skirts blow against my legs with the wind of it, and wondered how the men could stand it, there inside.A fresh outbreak of shouting in the crowd behind me announced the arrival of the Town Guard, armed with buckets.Obviously accustomed to this task, the men flung off their wine red uniform coats and began at once to attack the fire, smashing the windows and flinging pails of water through them with a fierce abandon.Meanwhile, the crowd swelled, its noise augmented by a constant cascade of pattering feet down the many staircases of the close, as families on the upper floors of the surrounding buildings hastily ushered hordes of excited children down to safety.I couldnt think that the efforts of the bucket brigade, valiant as they were, would have much effect on what was obviously a fire well underway.I was edging back and forth on the pavement, trying vainly to see anything moving within, when the lead man in the bucket line uttered a startled cry and leaped back, just in time to avoid being crowned by a tray of lead type that whizzed through the broken window and landed on the cobbles with a crash, scattering slugs in all directions.Two or three urchins wriggled through the crowd and snatched at the slugs, only to be cuffed and driven off by indignant neighbors.One plump lady in a kertch and apron darted forward, risking life and limb, and took custody of the heavy type tray, dragging it back to the curb, where she crouched protectively over it like a hen on a nest.Before her companions could scoop up the fallen type, though, they were driven back by a hail of objects that rained from both windows: more type trays, roller bars, inking pads, and bottles of ink, which broke on the pavement, leaving big spidery blotches that ran into the puddles spilled by the fire fighters.Encouraged by the draft from the open door and windows, the voice of the fire had grown from a whisper into a self satisfied, chuckling roar.Prevented from flinging water through the windows by the rain of objects being thrown out of them, the leader of the Town Guard shouted to his men, and holding a soaked handkerchief over his nose, ducked and ran into the building, followed by a half dozen of his fellows.The line quickly re formed, full buckets coming hand to hand round the corner from the nearest pump and up the stoop, excited lads snatching the empty buckets that bounced down the step, to race back with them to the pump for refilling.Edinburgh is a stone city, but with so many buildings crammed cheek by jowl, all equipped with multiple hearths and chimneys, fire must be still a frequent occurrence.Evidently so, for a fresh commotion behind me betokened the belated arrival of the fire engine.The waves of people parted like the Red Sea, to allow passage of the engine, drawn by a team of men rather than horses, which could not have negotiated the tight quarters of the wynds.The engine was a marvel of brass, glowing like a coal itself in the reflected flames.The heat was becoming more intense; I could feel my lungs dry and labor with each gulp of hot air, and was terrified for Jamie.How long could he breathe, in that hellish fog of smoke and heat, let alone the danger of the flames themselves?Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!Ian, forcing his way through the crowd despite his wooden leg, had appeared suddenly by my elbow.He grabbed my arm to keep his balance as another rain of objects forced the people around us back again.Wheres Jamie?he shouted in my ear.In there!I bellowed back, pointing.There was a sudden bustle and commotion at the door of the printshop, with a confused shouting that rose even over the sound of the fire.Several sets of legs appeared, shuffling to and fro beneath the emergent plume of smoke that billowed from the door.Six men emerged, Jamie among them, staggering under the weight of a huge piece of bulky machineryJamies precious printing press.They eased it down the step and pushed it well into the crowd, then turned back to the printshop.Too late for any more rescue maneuvers; there was a crash from inside, a fresh blast of heat that sent the crowd scuttling backward, and suddenly the windows of the upper story were lit with dancing flames inside.A small stream of men issued from the building, coughing and choking, some of them crawling, blackened with soot and dampened with the sweat of their efforts.The engine crew pumped madly, but the thick stream of water from their hose made not the slightest impression on the fire.Ians hand clamped down on my arm like the jaws of a trap.Ian!he shrieked, loud enough to be heard above the noises of crowd and fire alike.I looked up in the direction of his gaze, and saw a wraithlike shape at the second story window.It seemed to struggle briefly with the sash, and then to fall back or be enveloped in the smoke.My heart leapt into my mouth.There was no telling whether the shape was indeed Young Ian, but it was certainly a human form.Ian had lost no time in gaping, but was stumping toward the door of the printshop with all the speed his leg would allow.Wait!I shouted, running after him.Jamie was leaning on the printing press, chest heaving as he tried to catch his breath and thank his assistants at the same time.Jamie!I snatched at his sleeve, ruthlessly jerking him away from a red faced barber, who kept excitedly wiping sooty hands on his apron, leaving long black streaks among the smears of dried soap and the spots of blood.Up there!I shouted, pointing.Young Ians upstairs!Jamie stepped back, swiping a sleeve across his blackened face, and stared wildly at the upper windows.Nothing was to be seen but the roiling shimmer of the fire against the panes.Ian was struggling in the hands of several neighbors who sought to prevent his entering the shop.No, man, ye canna go in!the Guard captain cried, trying to grasp Ians flailing hands.The staircase has fallen, and the roof will go next!Despite his stringy build and the handicap of his leg, Ian was tall and vigorous, and the feeble grasp of his well meaning Town Guard captorsmostly retired pensioners from the Highland regimentswas no match for his mountain hardened strength, reinforced as it was by parental desperation.Slowly but surely, the whole confused mass jerked by inches up the steps of the printshop as Ian dragged his would be rescuers with him toward the flames.I felt Jamie draw breath, gulping air as deep as he could with his seared lungs, and then he was up the steps as well, and had Ian round the waist, dragging him back.Come down, man!he shouted hoarsely.Yell no managethe stair is gone!He glanced round, saw me, and thrust Ian bodily backward, off balance and staggering, into my arms.Hold him, he shouted, over the roar of the flames.Ill fetch down the lad!With that, he turned and dashed up the steps of the adjoining building, pushing his way through the patrons of the ground floor chocolate shop, who had emerged onto the pavement to gawk at the excitement, pewter cups still clutched in their hands.Following Jamies example, I locked my arms tight around Ians waist and didnt let go.He made an abortive attempt to follow Jamie, but then stopped and stood rigid in my arms, his heart beating wildly just under my cheek.Dont worry, I said, pointlessly.Hell do it; hell get him out.He will.I know he will.Ian didnt answermight not have heardbut stood still and stiff as a statue in my grasp, breath coming harshly with a sound like a sob.When I released my hold on his waist, he didnt move or turn, but when I stood beside him, he snatched my hand and held it hard.My bones would have ground together, had I not been squeezing back just as hard.It was no more than a minute before the window above the chocolate shop opened and Jamies head and shoulders appeared, red hair glowing like a stray tongue of flame escaped from the main fire.He climbed out onto the sill, and cautiously turned, squatting, until he faced the building.Rising to his stockinged feet, he grasped the gutter of the roof overhead and pulled, slowly raising himself by the strength of his arms, long toes scrabbling for a grip in the crevices between the mortared stones of the housefront.With a grunt audible even over the sound of fire and crowd, he eeled over the edge of the roof and disappeared behind the gable.A shorter man could not have managed.Neither could Ian, with his wooden leg.I heard Ian say something under his breath; a prayer I thought, but when I glanced at him, his jaw was clenched, face set in lines of fear.What in hell is he going to do up there?I thought, and was unaware that I had spoken aloud until the barber, shading his eyes next to me, replied.Theres a trapdoor built in the roof o the printshop, maam.Nay doubt Mr.Malcolm means to gain access to the upper story so.Is it his prentice up there, dye know?No!Ian snapped, hearing this.Its my son!The barber shrank back before Ians glare, murmuring Oh, aye, just so, sir, just so!and crossing himself.A shout from the crowd grew into a roar as two figures appeared on the roof of the chocolate shop, and Ian dropped my hand, springing forward.Jamie had his arm round Young Ian, who was bent and reeling from the smoke he had swallowed.It was reasonably obvious that neither of them was going to be able to negotiate a return through the adjoining building in his present condition.Just then, Jamie spotted Ian below.Cupping his hand around his mouth, he bellowed Rope!Rope there was; the Town Guard had come equipped.Ian snatched the coil from an approaching Guardsman, leaving that worthy blinking in indignation, and turned to face the house.I caught the gleam of Jamies teeth as he grinned down at his brother in law, and the look of answering wryness on Ians face.How many times had they thrown a rope between them, to raise hay to the barn loft, or bind a load to the wagon for carrying?The crowd fell back from the whirl of Ians arm, and the heavy coil flew up in a smooth parabola, unwinding as it went, landing on Jamies outstretched arm with the precision of a bumblebee lighting on a flower.Jamie hauled in the dangling tail, and disappeared momentarily, to anchor the rope about the base of the buildings chimney.A few precarious moments work, and the two smoke blackened figures had come to a safe landing on the pavement below.Young Ian, rope slung under his arms and round his chest, stood upright for a moment, then, as the tension of the rope slackened, his knees buckled and he slid into a gangling heap on the cobbles.Are ye all right?A bhalaich, speak to me!Ian fell to his knees beside his son, anxiously trying to unknot the rope round Young Ians chest, while simultaneously trying to lift up the lads lolling head.Jamie was leaning against the railing of the chocolate shop, black in the face and coughing his lungs out, but otherwise apparently unharmed.I sat down on the boys other side, and took his head on my lap.I wasnt sure whether to laugh or cry at the sight of him.When I had seen him in the morning, he had been an appealing looking lad, if no great beauty, with something of his fathers homely, good natured looks.Now, at evening, the thick hair over one side of his forehead had been singed to a bleached red stubble, and his eyebrows and lashes had been burned off entirely.The skin beneath was the soot smeared bright pink of a suckling pig just off the spit.I felt for a pulse in the spindly neck and found it, reassuringly strong.His breathing was hoarse and irregular, and no wonder; I hoped the lining of his lungs had not been burned.He coughed, long and rackingly, and the thin body convulsed on my lap.Is he all right?Ians hands instinctively grabbed his son beneath the armpits and sat him up.His head wobbled to and fro, and he pitched forward into my arms.I think so; I cant tell for sure.The boy was still coughing, but not fully conscious; I held him against my shoulder like an enormous baby, patting his back futilely as he retched and gagged.Is he all right?This time it was Jamie, squatting breathless alongside me.His voice was so hoarse I wouldnt have recognized it, roughened as it was by smoke.I think so.What about you?You look like Malcolm X, I said, peering at him over Young Ians heaving shoulder.I do?He put a hand to his face, looking startled, then grinned reassuringly.Nay, I canna say how I look, but Im no an ex Malcolm yet; only a wee bit singed round the edges.Get back, get back!The Guard captain was at my side, gray beard bristling with anxiety, plucking at my sleeve.Move yourself, maam, the roofs going!Sure enough, as we scrambled to safety, the roof of the printshop fell in, and an awed sound rose from the watching crowd as an enormous fountain of sparks whirled skyward, brilliant against the darkening sky.As though heaven resented this intrusion, the spume of fiery ash was answered by the first pattering of raindrops, plopping heavily on the cobbles all around us.The Edinburghians, who surely ought to have been accustomed to rain by now, made noises of consternation and began to scuttle back into the surrounding buildings like a herd of cockroaches, leaving nature to complete the fire engines work.A moment later, Ian and I were alone with Young Ian.Jamie, having dispensed money liberally to the Guard and other assistants, and having arranged for his press and its fittings to be housed in the barbers storeroom, trudged wearily toward us.Hows the lad?he asked, wiping a hand down his face.The rain had begun to come down more heavily, and the effect on his soot blackened countenance was picturesque in the extreme.Ian looked at him, and for the first time, the anger, worry and fear faded somewhat from his countenance.He gave Jamie a lopsided smile.He doesna look a great deal better than ye do yourself, manbut I think hell do now.Give us a hand, aye?Murmuring small Gaelic endearments suitable for babies, Ian bent over his son, who was by this time sitting up groggily on the curbstone, swaying to and fro like a heron in a high wind.By the time we reached Madame Jeannes establishment, Young Ian could walk, though still supported on either side by his father and uncle.Bruno, who opened the door, blinked incredulously at the sight, and then swung the door open, laughing so hard he could barely close it after us.I had to admit that we were nothing much to look at, wet through and streaming with rain.Jamie and I were both barefoot, and Jamies clothes were in rags, singed and torn and covered with streaks of soot.Ians dark hair straggled in his eyes, making him look like a drowned rat with a wooden leg.Young Ian, though, was the focus of attention, as multiple heads came popping out of the drawing room in response to the noise Bruno was making.With his singed hair, swollen red face, beaky nose, and lashless, blinking eyes, he strongly resembled the fledgling young of some exotic bird speciesa newly hatched flamingo, perhaps.His face could scarcely grow redder, but the back of his neck flamed crimson, as the sound of feminine giggles followed us up the stairs.Safely ensconced in the small upstairs sitting room, with the door closed, Ian turned to face his hapless offspring.Going to live, are ye, ye wee bugger?he demanded.Aye, sir, Young Ian replied in a dismal croak, looking rather as though he wished the answer were No.Good, his father said grimly.Dye want to explain yourself, or shall I just belt hell out of ye now and save us both time?Ye canna thrash someone whos just had his eyebrows burnt off, Ian, Jamie protested hoarsely, pouring out a glass of porter from the decanter on the table.It wouldna be humane.He grinned at his nephew and handed him the glass, which the boy clutched with alacrity.Aye, well.Perhaps not, Ian agreed, surveying his son.One corner of his mouth twitched.Young Ian was a pitiable sight; he was also an extremely funny one.That doesna mean ye arent going to get your arse blistered later, mind, he warned the boy, and thats besides whatever your mother means to do to ye when she sees ye again.But for now, lad, take your ease.Not noticeably reassured by the magnanimous tone of this last statement, Young Ian didnt answer, but sought refuge in the depths of his glass of porter.I took my own glass with a good deal of pleasure.I had realized belatedly just why the citizens of Edinburgh reacted to rain with such repugnance; once one was wet through, it was the devil to get dry again in the damp confines of a stone house, with no change of clothes and no heat available but a small hearthfire.I plucked the damp bodice away from my breasts, caught Young Ians interested glance, and decided regretfully that I really couldnt take it off with the boy in the room.Jamie seemed to have been corrupting the lad to quite a sufficient extent already.I gulped the porter instead, feeling the rich flavor purl warmingly through my innards.Dye feel well enough to talk a bit, lad?Jamie sat down opposite his nephew, next to Ian on the hassock.AyeI think so, Young Ian croaked cautiously.He cleared his throat like a bullfrog and repeated more firmly, Aye, I can.Good.Well, then.First, how did ye come to be in the printshop, and then, how did it come to be on fire?Young Ian pondered that one for a minute, then took another gulp of his porter for courage and said, I set it.Jamie and Ian both sat up straight at that.I could see Jamie revising his opinion as to the advisability of thrashing people without eyebrows, but he mastered his temper with an obvious effort, and said merely, Why?The boy took another gulp of porter, coughed, and drank again, apparently trying to decide what to say.Well, he began uncertainly, there was a man, and came to a dead stop.A man, Jamie prompted patiently when his nephew showed signs of having become suddenly deaf and dumb.What man?Young Ian clutched his glass in both hands, looking deeply unhappy.Answer your uncle this minute, clot, Ian said sharply.Or Ill take ye across my knee and tan ye right here.With a mixture of similar threats and promptings, the two men managed to extract a more or less coherent story from the boy.Young Ian had been at the tavern at Kerse that morning, where he had been told to meet Wally, who would come down from the rendezvous with the wagons of brandy, there to load the punked casks and spoiled wine to be used as subterfuge.Told?Ian asked sharply.Who told ye?I did, Jamie said, before Young Ian could speak.He waved a hand at his brother in law, urging silence.Aye, I kent he was here.Well talk about it later, Ian, if ye please.Its important we know what happened today.Ian glared at Jamie and opened his mouth to disagree, then shut it with a snap.He nodded to his son to go on.I was hungry, ye see, Young Ian said.When are ye not?his father and uncle said together, in perfect unison.They looked at each other, snorted with sudden laughter, and the strained atmosphere in the room eased slightly.So ye went into the tavern to have a bite, Jamie said.Thats all right, lad, no harm done.And what happened while ye were there?That, it transpired, was where he had seen the man.A small, ratty looking fellow, with a seamans pigtail, and a blind eye, talking to the landlord.He was askin for you, Uncle Jamie, Young Ian said, growing easier in his speech with repeated applications of porter.By your own name.Jamie started, looking surprised.Jamie Fraser, ye mean?Young Ian nodded, sipping.Aye.But he knew your other name as wellJamie Roy, I mean.Jamie Roy?Ian turned a puzzled glance on his brother in law, who shrugged impatiently.Its how Im known on the docks.Christ, Ian, ye know what I do!Aye, I do, but I didna ken the wee laddie was helpin ye to do it.Ians thin lips pressed tight together, and he turned his attention back to his son.Go on, lad.I willna interrupt ye again.The seaman had asked the tavernkeeper how best an old seadog, down on his luck and looking for employment, might find one Jamie Fraser, who was known to have a use for able men.The landlord pleading ignorance of that name, the seaman had leaned closer, pushed a coin across the table, and in a lowered voice asked whether the name Jamie Roy was more familiar.The landlord remaining deaf as an adder, the seaman had soon left the tavern, with Young Ian right behind him.I thought as how maybe it would be good to know who he was, and what he meant, the lad explained, blinking.Ye might have thought to leave word wi the publican for Wally, Jamie said.Still, thats neither here nor there.Where did he go?Down the road at a brisk walk, but not so brisk that a healthy boy could not follow at a careful distance.An accomplished walker, the seaman had made his way into Edinburgh, a distance of some five miles, in less than an hour, and arrived at last at the Green Owl tavern, followed by Young Ian, near wilted with thirst from the walk.I started at the name, but didnt say anything, not wanting to interrupt the story.It was terrible crowded, the lad reported.Something happened in the morning, and everyone was talking of itbut they shut up whenever they saw me.Anyway, it was the same there.He paused to cough and clear his throat.The seaman ordered drinkbrandythen asked the landlord was he acquainted wi a supplier of brandy named Jamie Roy or Jamie Fraser.Did he, then?Jamie murmured.His gaze was intent on his nephew, but I could see the thoughts working behind his high forehead, making a small crease between his thick brows.The man had gone methodically from tavern to tavern, dogged by his faithful shadow, and in each establishment had ordered brandy and repeated his question.He must have a rare head, to be drinkin that much brandy, Ian remarked.Young Ian shook his head.He didna drink it.He only smelt it.His father clicked his tongue at such a scandalous waste of good spirit, but Jamies red brows climbed still higher.Did he taste any of it?he asked sharply.Aye.At the Dog and Gun, and again at the Blue Boar.He had nay more than a wee taste, though, and then left the glass untouched.He didna drink at all at the other places, and we went to five o them, before He trailed off, and took another drink.Jamies face underwent an astonishing transformation.From an expression of frowning puzzlement, his face went completely blank, and then resolved itself into an expression of revelation.Is that so, now, he said softly to himself.Indeed.His attention came back to his nephew.And then what happened, lad?Young Ian was beginning to look unhappy again.He gulped, the tremor visible all the way down his skinny neck.Well, it was a terrible long way from Kerse to Edinburgh, he began, and a terrible dry walk, too  His father and uncle exchanged jaundiced glances.Ye drank too much, Jamie said, resigned.Well, I didna ken he was going to so many taverns, now, did I?Young Ian cried in self defense, going pink in the ears.No, of course not, lad, Jamie said kindly, smothering the beginning of Ians more censorious remarks.How long did ye last?Until midway down the Royal Mile, it turned out, where Young Ian, overcome by the cumulation of early rising, a five mile walk, and the effects of something like two quarts of ale, had dozed off in a corner, waking an hour later to find his quarry long gone.So I came here, he explained.I thought as how Uncle Jamie should know about it.But he wasna here.The boy glanced at me, and his ears grew still pinker.And just why did ye think he should be here?Ian favored his offspring with a gimlet eye, which then swiveled to his brother in law.The simmering anger Ian had been holding in check since the morning suddenly erupted.The filthy gall of ye, Jamie Fraser, takin my son to a bawdy house!A fine one you are to talk, Da!Young Ian was on his feet, swaying a bit, but with his big, bony hands clenched at his sides.Me?And what dye mean by that, ye wee gomerel?Ian cried, his eyes going wide with outrage.I mean youre a damned hypocrite!his son shouted hoarsely.Preachin to me and Michael about purity and keepin to one woman, and all the time yere slinkin about the city, sniffin after whores!What?Ians face had gone entirely purple.I looked in some alarm to Jamie, who appeared to be finding something funny in the present situation.Youre aagoddamned whited sepulchre!Young Ian came up with the simile triumphantly, then paused as though trying to think of another to equal it.His mouth opened, though nothing emerged but a soft belch.That boy is rather drunk, I said to Jamie.He picked up the decanter of porter, eyed the level within, and set it down.Youre right, he said.I should ha noticed sooner, but its hard to tell, scorched as he is.The elder Ian wasnt drunk, but his expression strongly resembled his offsprings, what with the suffused countenance, popping eyes, and straining neck cords.What the bloody, stinking hell dye mean by that, ye whelp?he shouted.He moved menacingly toward Young Ian, who took an involuntary step backward and sat down quite suddenly as his calves met the edge of the sofa.Her, he said, startled into monosyllables.He pointed at me, to make it clear.Her!You deceivin my Mam wi this filthy whore, thats what I mean!Ian fetched his son a clout over the ear that knocked him sprawling on the sofa.Ye great clot!he said, scandalized.A fine way to speak o your auntie Claire, to say nothing o me and your Mam!Aunt?Young Ian gawped at me from the cushions, looking so like a nestling begging for food that I burst out laughing despite myself.You left before I could introduce myself this morning, I said.But youre dead, he said stupidly.Not yet, I assured him.Unless Ive caught pneumonia from sitting here in a damp dress.His eyes had grown perfectly round as he stared at me.Now a fugitive gleam of excitement came into them.Some o the auld women at Lallybroch say ye were a wisewomana white lady, or maybe even a fairy.When Uncle Jamie came home from Culloden without ye, they said as how yed maybe gone back to the fairies, where ye maybe came from.Is that true?Dye live in a dun?I exchanged a glance with Jamie, who rolled his eyes toward the ceiling.No, I said.Ier, I  She escaped to France after Culloden, Ian broke in suddenly, with great firmness.She thought your uncle Jamie was killed in the battle, so she went to her kin in France.Shed been one of Prince Tearlachs particular friendsshe couldna come back to Scotland after the war without puttin herself in sore danger.But then she heard of your uncle, and as soon as she kent that her husband wasna deid after all, she took ship at once and came to find him.Young Ians mouth hung open slightly.So did mine.Er, yes, I said, closing it.Thats what happened.The lad turned large, shining eyes from me to his uncle.So yeve come back to him, he said happily.God, thats romantic!The tension of the moment was broken.Ian hesitated, but his eyes softened as he looked from Jamie to me.Aye, he said, and smiled reluctantly.Aye, I suppose it is.I didna expect to be doing this for him for a good two or three years yet, Jamie remarked, holding his nephews head with an expert hand as Young Ian retched painfully into the spittoon I was holding.Aye, well, hes always been forward, Ian answered resignedly.Learnt to walk before he could stand, and was forever tumblin into the fire or the washpot or the pigpen or the cowbyre.He patted the skinny, heaving back.There, lad, let it come.A little more, and the lad was deposited in a wilted heap on the sofa, there to recover from the effects of smoke, emotion, and too much porter under the censoriously mingled gaze of uncle and father.Wheres that damn tea I sent for?Jamie reached impatiently for the bell, but I stopped him.The brothels domestic arrangements were evidently still disarranged from the excitements of the morning.Dont bother, I said.Ill go down and fetch it.I scooped up the spittoon and carried it out with me at arms length, hearing Ian say behind me, in a reasonable tone of voice, Look, fool  I found my way to the kitchen with no difficulty, and obtained the necessary supplies.I hoped Jamie and Ian would give the boy a few minutes respite; not only for his own sake, but so that I would miss nothing of his story.I had clearly missed something; when I returned to the small sitting room, an air of constraint hung over the room like a cloud, and Young Ian glanced up and then quickly away to avoid my eye.Jamie was his usual imperturbable self, but the elder Ian looked almost as flushed and uneasy as his son.He hurried forward to take the tray from me, murmuring thanks, but would not meet my eye.I raised one eyebrow at Jamie, who gave me a slight smile and a shrug.I shrugged back and picked up one of the bowls on the tray.Bread and milk, I said, handing it to Young Ian, who at once looked happier.Hot tea, I said, handing the pot to his father.Whisky, I said, handing the bottle to Jamie, and cold tea for the burns.I whisked the lid off the last bowl, in which a number of napkins were soaking in cold tea.Cold tea?Jamies ruddy brows lifted.Did the cook have no butter?You dont put butter on burns, I told him.Aloe juice, or the juice of a plantain or plantago, but the cook didnt have any of that.Cold tea is the best we could manage.I poulticed Young Ians blistered hands and forearms and blotted his scarlet face gently with the tea soaked napkins while Jamie and Ian did the honors with teapot and whisky bottle, after which we all sat down, somewhat restored, to hear the rest of Ians story.Well, he began, I walked about the city for a bit, tryin to think what best to do.And finally my head cleared a bit, and I reasoned that if the man Id been following was goin from tavern to tavern down the High Street, if I went to the other end and started up the street, I could maybe find him that way.That was a bright thought, Jamie said, and Ian nodded approvingly, the frown lifting a bit from his face.Did ye find him?Young Ian nodded, slurping a bit.I did, then.Running down the Royal Mile nearly to the Palace of Holyrood at the foot, he had toiled his way painstakingly up the street, stopping at each tavern to inquire for the man with the pigtail and one eye.There was no word of his quarry anywhere below the Canongate, and he was beginning to despair of his idea, when suddenly he had seen the man himself, sitting in the taproom of the Holyrood Brewery.Presumably this stop was for respite, rather than information, for the seaman was sitting at his ease, drinking beer.Young Ian had darted behind a hogshead in the yard, and remained there, watching, until at length the man rose, paid his score, and made his leisurely way outside.He didna go to any more taverns, the boy reported, wiping a stray drop of milk off his chin.He went straight to Carfax Close, to the printshop.Jamie said something in Gaelic under his breath.Did he?And what then?Well, he found the shop shut up, of course.When he saw the door was locked, he looked careful like, up at the windows, as though he was maybe thinking of breaking in.But then I saw him look about, at all the folk coming and goingit was a busy time of day, wi all the folk coming to the chocolate shop.So he stood on the stoop a moment, thinking, and then he set off back up the closeI had to duck into the tailors shop on the corner so as not to be seen.The man had paused at the entrance of the close, then, making up his mind, had turned to the right, gone down a few paces, and disappeared into a small alley.I kent as how the alley led up to the court at the back of the close, Young Ian explained.So I saw at once what he meant to be doing.Theres a wee court at the back of the close, Jamie explained, seeing my puzzled look.Its for rubbish and deliveries and suchbut theres a back door out of the printshop opens onto it.Young Ian nodded, putting down his empty bowl.Aye.I thought it must be that he meant to get into the place.And I thought of the new pamphlets.Jesus, Jamie said.He looked a little pale.Pamphlets?Ian raised his brows at Jamie.What kind of pamphlets?The new printing for Mr.Gage, Young Ian explained.Ian still looked as blank as I felt.Politics, Jamie said bluntly.An argument for repeal of the last Stamp Actwith an exhortation to civil oppositionby violence, if necessary.Five thousand of them, fresh printed, stacked in the back room.Gage was to come round and get them in the morning, tomorrow.Jesus, Ian said.He had gone even paler than Jamie, at whom he stared in a sort of mingled horror and awe.Have ye gone straight out o your mind?he inquired.You, wi not an inch on your back unscarred?Wi the ink scarce dry on your pardon for treason?Youre mixed up wi Tom Gage and his seditious society, and got my son involved as well?His voice had been rising throughout, and now he sprang to his feet, fists clenched.How could ye do such a thing, Jamiehow?Have we not suffered enough for your actions, Jenny and me?All through the war and afterChrist, Id think youd have your fill of prisons and blood and violence!I have, Jamie said shortly.Im no part of Gages group.But my business is printing, aye?He paid for those pamphlets.Ian threw up his hands in a gesture of vast irritation.Oh, aye!And that will mean a great deal when the Crowns agents arrest ye and take ye to London to be hangit!If those things were to be found on your premises Struck by a sudden thought, he stopped and turned to his son.Oh, that was it?he asked.Ye kent what those pamphlets werethats why ye set them on fire?Young Ian nodded, solemn as a young owl.I couldna move them in time, he said.Not five thousand.The manthe seamanhed broke out the back window, and he was reachin in for the doorlatch.Ian whirled back to face Jamie.Damn you!he said violently.Damn ye for a reckless, harebrained fool, Jamie Fraser!First the Jacobites, and now this!Jamie had flushed up at once at Ians words, and his face grew darker at this.Am I to blame for Charles Stuart?he said.His eyes flashed angrily and he set his teacup down with a thump that sloshed tea and whisky over the polished tabletop.Did I not try all I could to stop the wee fool?Did I not give up everything in that fighteverything, Ian!My land, my freedom, my wifeto try to save us all?He glanced at me briefly as he spoke, and I caught one very small quick glimpse of just what the last twenty years had cost him.He turned back to Ian, his brows lowering as he went on, voice growing hard.And as for what Ive cost your familywhat have ye profited, Ian?Lallybroch belongs to wee James now, no?To your son, not mine!Ian flinched at that.I never asked he began.No, ye didnt.Im no accusing ye, for Gods sake!But the facts thereLallybrochs no mine anymore, is it?My father left it to me, and I cared for it as best I couldtook care o the land and the tenantsand ye helped me, Ian.His voice softened a bit.I couldna have managed without you and Jenny.I dinna begrudge deeding it to Young Jamieit had to be done.But still He turned away for a moment, head bowed, broad shoulders knotted tight beneath the linen of his shirt.I was afraid to move or speak, but I caught Young Ians eye, filled with infinite distress.I put a hand on his skinny shoulder for mutual reassurance, and felt the steady pounding of the pulse in the tender flesh above his collarbone.He set his big, bony paw on my hand and held on tight.Jamie turned back to his brother in law, struggling to keep his voice and temper under control.I swear to ye, Ian, I didna let the lad be put in danger.I kept him out of the way so much as I possibly coulddidna let the shoremen see him, or let him go out on the boats wi Fergus, hard as he begged me.He glanced at Young Ian and his expression changed, to an odd mixture of affection and irritation.I didna ask him to come to me, Ian, and I told him he must go home again.Ye didna make him go, though, did you?The angry color was fading from Ians face, but his soft brown eyes were still narrow and bright with fury.And ye didna send word, either.For Gods sake, Jamie, Jenny hasna slept at night anytime this month!Jamies lips pressed tight.No, he said, letting the words escape one at a time.No.I didnt.I He glanced at the boy again, and shrugged uncomfortably, as though his shirt had grown suddenly too tight.No, he said again.I meant to take him home myself.Hes old enough to travel by himself, Ian said shortly.He got here alone, no?Aye.It wasna that.Jamie turned aside restlessly, picking up a teacup and rolling it to and fro between his palms.No, I meant to take him, so that I could ask your permissionyours and Jennysfor the lad to come live wi me for a time.Ian uttered a short, sarcastic laugh.Oh, aye!Give our permission for him to be hangit or transported alongside you, eh?The anger flashed across Jamies features again as he looked up from the cup in his hands.Ye know I wouldna let any harm come to him, he said.For Christs sake, Ian, I care for the lad as though he were my own son, and well ye ken it, too!Ians breath was coming fast; I could hear it from my place behind the sofa.Oh, I ken it well enough, he said, staring hard into Jamies face.But hes not your son, aye?Hes mine.Jamie stared back for a long moment, then reached out and gently set the teacup back on the table.Aye, he said quietly.He is.Ian stood for a moment, breathing hard, then wiped a hand carelessly across his forehead, pushing back the thick dark hair.Well, then, he said.He took one or two deep breaths, and turned to his son.Come along, then, he said.Ive a room at Hallidays.Young Ians bony fingers tightened on mine.His throat worked, but he didnt move to rise from his seat.No, Da, he said.His voice quivered, and he blinked hard, not to cry.Im no going wi ye.Ians face went quite pale, with a deep red patch over the angular cheekbones, as though someone had slapped him hard on both cheeks.Is that so?he said.Young Ian nodded, swallowing.IIll go wi ye in the morning, Da; Ill go home wi ye.But not now.Ian looked at his son for a long moment without speaking.Then his shoulders slumped, and all the tension went out of his body.I see, he said quietly.Well, then.Well.Without another word, he turned and left, closing the door very carefully behind him.I could hear the awkward thump of his wooden leg on each step, as he made his way down the stair.There was a brief sound of shuffling as he reached the bottom, then Brunos voice in farewell, and the thud of the main door shutting.And then there was no sound in the room but the hiss of the hearthfire behind me.The boys shoulder was shaking under my hand, and he was holding tighter than ever to my fingers, crying without making a sound.Jamie came slowly to sit beside him, his face full of troubled helplessness.Ian, oh, wee Ian, he said.Christ, laddie, ye shouldna have done that.I had to.Ian gasped and gave a sudden snuffle, and I realized that he had been holding his breath.He turned a scorched countenance on his uncle, raw features contorted in anguish.I didna want to hurt Da, he said.I didnt!Jamie patted his knee absently.I know, laddie, he said, but to say such a thing to him  I couldna tell him, though, and I had to tell you, Uncle Jamie!Jamie glanced up, suddenly alert at his nephews tone.Tell me?Tell me what?The man.The man wi the pigtail.What about him?Young Ian licked his lips, steeling himself.I think I kilt him, he whispered.Startled, Jamie glanced at me, then back at Young Ian.How?he asked.WellI lied a bit, Ian began, voice trembling.The tears were still welling in his eyes, but he brushed them aside.When I went into the printshopI had the key ye gave methe man was already inside.The seaman had been in the backmost room of the shop, where the stacks of newly printed orders were kept, along with the stocks of fresh ink, the blotting papers used to clean the press, and the small forge where worn slugs were melted down and recast into fresh type.He was taking some o the pamphlets from the stack, and putting them inside his jacket, Ian said, gulping.When I saw him, I screeched at him to put them back, and he whirled round at me wi a pistol in his hand.The pistol had discharged, scaring Young Ian badly, but the ball had gone wild.Little daunted, the seaman had rushed at the boy, raising the pistol to club him instead.There was no time to run, or to think, he said.He had let go my hand by now, and his fingers twisted together upon his knee.I reached out for the first thing to hand and threw it.The first thing to hand had been the lead dipper, the long handled copper ladle used to pour molten lead from the melting pot into the casting molds.The forge had been still alight, though well banked, and while the melting pot held no more than a small puddle, the scalding drops of lead had flown from the dipper into the seamans face.God, how he screamed!A strong shudder ran through Young Ians slender frame, and I came round the end of the sofa to sit next to him and take both his hands.The seaman had reeled backward, clawing at his face, and upset the small forge, knocking live coals everywhere.That was what started the fire, the boy said.I tried to beat it out, but it caught the edge of the fresh paper, and all of a sudden, something went whoosh!in my face, and it was as though the whole room was alight.The barrels of ink, I suppose, Jamie said, as though to himself.The powders dissolved in alcohol.The sliding piles of flaming paper fell between Young Ian and the back door, a wall of flame that billowed black smoke and threatened to collapse upon him.The seaman, blinded and screaming like a banshee, had been on his hands and knees between the boy and the door into the front room of the printshop and safety.II couldna bear to touch him, to push him out o the way, he said, shuddering again.Losing his head completely, he had run up the stairs instead, but then found himself trapped as the flames, racing through the back room and drawing up the stair like a chimney, rapidly filled the upper room with blinding smoke.Did ye not think to climb out the trapdoor onto the roof?Jamie asked.Young Ian shook his head miserably.I didna ken it was there.Why was it there?I asked curiously.Jamie gave me the flicker of a smile.In case of need.Its a foolish fox has but one exit to his bolthole.Though I must say, it wasna fire I was thinking of when I had it made.He shook his head, ridding himself of the distraction.But ye think the man didna escape the fire?he asked.I dinna see how he could, Young Ian answered, beginning to sniffle again.And if hes dead, then I killed him.I couldna tell Da I was a m murmur He was crying again, too hard to get the word out.Youre no a murderer, Ian, Jamie said firmly.He patted his nephews shaking shoulder.Stop now, its all rightye havena done wrong, laddie.Ye havent, dye hear?The boy gulped and nodded, but couldnt stop crying or shaking.At last I put my arms around him, turned him and pulled his head down onto my shoulder, patting his back and making the sort of small soothing noises one makes to little children.He felt very odd in my arms; nearly as big as a full grown man, but with fine, light bones, and so little flesh on them that it was like holding a skeleton.He was talking into the depths of my bosom, his voice so disjointed by emotion and muffled by fabric that it was difficult to make out the words.mortal sin he seemed to be saying, damned to hellcouldna tell Daafraidcanna go home ever  Jamie raised his brows at me, but I only shrugged helplessly, smoothing the thick, bushy hair on the back of the boys head.At last Jamie leaned forward, took him firmly by the shoulders and sat him up.Look ye, Ian, he said.No, looklook at me!By dint of supreme effort, the boy straightened his drooping neck and fixed brimming, red rimmed eyes on his uncles face.Now then.Jamie took hold of his nephews hands and squeezed them lightly.Firstits no a sin to kill a man thats trying to kill you.The Church allows ye to kill if ye must, in defense of yourself, your family, or your country.So ye havena committed mortal sin, and youre no damned.Im not?Young Ian sniffed mightily, and mopped at his face with a sleeve.No, youre not.Jamie let the hint of a smile show in his eyes.Well go together and call on Father Hayes in the morning, and yell make your confession and be absolved then, but hell tell ye the same as I have.Oh.The syllable held profound relief, and Young Ians scrawny shoulders rose perceptibly, as though a burden had rolled off of them.Jamie patted his nephews knee again.For the second thing, ye needna fear telling your father.No?Young Ian had accepted Jamies word on the state of his soul without hesitation, but sounded profoundly dubious about this secular opinion.Well, Ill not say hell no be upset, Jamie added fairly.In fact, I expect it will turn the rest of his hair white on the spot.But hell understand.He isna going to cast ye out or disown ye, if thats what youre scairt of.You think hell understand?Young Ian looked at Jamie with eyes in which hope battled with doubt.II didna think hehas my Da ever killed a man?he asked suddenly.Jamie blinked, taken aback by the question.Well, he said slowly, I supposeI mean, hes fought in battle, but Ito tell ye the truth, Ian, I dinna ken.He looked a little helplessly at his nephew.Its no the sort of thing men talk much about, aye?Except sometimes soldiers, when theyre deep in drink.Young Ian nodded, absorbing this, and sniffed again, with a horrid gurgling noise.Jamie, groping hastily in his sleeve for a handkerchief, looked up suddenly, struck by a thought.Thats why ye said ye must tell me, but not your Da?Because ye knew Ive killed men before?His nephew nodded, searching Jamies face with troubled, trusting eyes.Aye.I thoughtI thought yed know what to do.Ah.Jamie drew a deep breath, and exchanged a glance with me.Well His shoulders braced and broadened, and I could see him accept the burden Young Ian had laid down.He sighed.What ye do, he said, is first to ask yourself if ye had a choice.You didnt, so put your mind at ease.Then ye go to confession, if ye can; if not, say a good Act of Contritionthats good enough, when its no a mortal sin.Ye harbor no fault, mind, he said earnestly, but the contrition is because ye greatly regret the necessity that fell on ye.It does sometimes, and theres no preventing it.And then say a prayer for the soul of the one youve killed, he went on, that he may find rest, and not haunt ye.Ye ken the prayer called Soul Peace?Use that one, if ye have leisure to think of it.In a battle, when there is no time, use Soul LeadingBe this soul on Thine arm, O Christ, Thou King of the City of Heaven, Amen.Be this soul on Thine arm, O Christ, Thou King of the City of Heaven, Amen, Young Ian repeated under his breath.He nodded slowly.Aye, all right.And then?Jamie reached out and touched his nephews cheek with great gentleness.Then ye live with it, laddie, he said softly.Thats all.28  VIRTUES GUARDIAN  You think the man Young Ian followed has something to do with Sir Percivals warning?I lifted a cover on the supper tray that had just been delivered and sniffed appreciatively; it seemed a very long time since Moubrays stew.Jamie nodded, picking up a sort of hot stuffed roll.I should be surprised if he had not, he said dryly.While theres likely more than one man willing to do me harm, I canna think it likely that gangs o them are roaming about Edinburgh.He took a bite and chewed industriously, shaking his head.Nay, thats clear enough, and nothing to be greatly worrit over.Its not?I took a small bite of my own roll, then a bigger one.This is delicious.What is it?Jamie lowered the roll he had been about to take a bite of, and squinted at it.Pigeon minced wi truffles, he said, and stuffed it into his mouth whole.No, he said, and paused to swallow.No, he said again, more clearly.Thats likely just a matter of a rival smuggler.There are two gangs that Ive had a wee bit of difficulty with now and then.He waved a hand, scattering crumbs, and reached for another roll.The way the man behavedsmellin the brandy, but seldom tasting ithe may be a dgustateur de vin; someone that can tell from a sniff where a wine was made, and from a taste, which year it was bottled.A verra valuable fellow, he added thoughtfully, and a choice hound to set on my trail.Wine had come along with the supper.I poured out a glass and passed it under my own nose.He could track youyou, personallythrough the brandy?I asked curiously.More or less.Youll remember my cousin Jared?Of course I do.You mean hes still alive?After the slaughter of Culloden and the erosions of its aftermath, it was wonderfully heartening to hear that Jared, a wealthy Scottish migr with a prosperous wine business in Paris, was still among the quick, and not the dead.I expect theyll have to head him up in a cask and toss him into the Seine to get rid of him, Jamie said, teeth gleaming white in his soot stained countenance.Aye, hes not only alive, but enjoying it.Where dye think I get the French brandy I bring into Scotland?The obvious answer was France, but I refrained from saying so.Jared, I suppose?I said instead.Jamie nodded, mouth full of another roll.Hey!He leaned forward and snatched the plate out from under the tentative reach of Young Ians skinny fingers.Youre no supposed to be eating rich stuff like that when your wames curdled, he said, frowning and chewing.He swallowed and licked his lips.Ill call for more bread and milk for ye.But Uncle, said Young Ian, looking longingly at the savory rolls.Im awfully hungry.Purged by confession, the boy had recovered his spirits considerably, and evidently, his appetite as well.Jamie looked at his nephew and sighed.Aye well.Ye swear youre no going to vomit on me?No, Uncle, Young Ian said meekly.All right, then.Jamie shoved the plate in the boys direction, and returned to his explanation.Jared sends me mostly the second quality bottling from his own vineyards in the Moselle, keepin the first quality for sale in France, where they can tell the difference.So the stuff you bring into Scotland is identifiable?He shrugged, reaching for the wine.Only to a nez, a dgustateur, that is.But the fact is, that wee Ian here saw the man taste the wine at the Dog and Gun and at the Blue Boar, and those are the two taverns on the High Street that buy brandy from me exclusively.Several others buy from me, but from others as well.In any case, as I say, Im none so concerned at havin someone look for Jamie Roy at a tavern.He lifted his wineglass and passed it under his own nose by reflex, made a slight, unconscious face, and drank.No, he said, lowering the glass, what worries me is that the man should have found his way to the printshop.For Ive taken considerable pains to make sure that the folk who see Jamie Roy on the docks at Burntisland are not the same ones who pass the time o day in the High Street with Mr.Alec Malcolm, the printer.I knitted my brows, trying to work it out.But Sir Percival called you Malcolm, and he knows youre a smuggler, I protested.Jamie nodded patiently.Half the men in the ports near Edinburgh are smugglers, Sassenach, he said.Aye, Sir Percival kens fine Im a smuggler, but he doesna ken Im Jamie Roylet alone James Fraser.He thinks I bring in bolts of undeclared silk and velvet from Hollandbecause thats what I pay him in.He smiled wryly.I trade brandy for them, to the tailor on the corner.Sir Percivals an eye for fine cloth, and his lady even more.But he doesna ken Ive to do wi the liquorlet alone how muchor hed be wanting a great deal more than the odd bit of lace and yardage, Ill tell ye.Could one of the tavern owners have told the seaman about you?Surely theyve seen you.He ruffled a hand through his hair, as he did when thinking, making a few short hairs on the crown stand up in a whorl of tiny spikes.Aye, theyve seen me, he said slowly, but only as a customer.Fergus handles the business dealings wi the tavernsand Fergus is careful never to go near the printshop.He always meets me here, in private.He gave me a crooked grin.No one questions a mans reasons for visiting a brothel, aye?Could that be it?I asked, struck by a sudden thought.Any man can come here without question.Could the seaman Young Ian followed have seen you hereyou and Fergus?Or heard your description from one of the girls?After all, youre not the most inconspicuous man Ive ever seen.He wasnt, either.While there might be any number of redheaded men in Edinburgh, few of them towered to Jamies height, and fewer still strode the streets with the unconscious arrogance of a disarmed warrior.Thats a verra useful thought, Sassenach, he said, giving me a nod.It will be easy enough to find out whether a pigtailed seaman with one eye has been here recently; Ill have Jeanne ask among her lassies.He stood up, and stretched rackingly, his hands nearly touching the wooden rafters.And then, Sassenach, perhaps well go to bed, aye?He lowered his arms and blinked at me with a smile.What wi one thing and another, its been the bloody hell of a day, no?It has, rather, I said, smiling back.Jeanne, summoned for instructions, arrived together with Fergus, who opened the door for the madam with the easy familiarity of a brother or cousin.Little wonder if he felt at home, I supposed; he had been born in a Paris brothel, and spent the first ten years of his life there, sleeping in a cupboard beneath the stairs, when not making a living by picking pockets on the street.The brandy is gone, he reported to Jamie.I have sold it to MacAlpineat a small sacrifice in price, I regret, milord.I thought a quick sale the best.Better to have it off the premises, Jamie said, nodding.What have ye done wi the body?Fergus smiled briefly, his lean face and dark forelock lending him a distinctly piratical air.Our intruder also has gone to MacAlpines tavern, milordsuitably disguised.As what?I demanded.The pirates grin turned on me; Fergus had turned out a very handsome man, the disfigurement of his hook notwithstanding.As a cask of crme de menthe, milady, he said.I do not suppose anyone has drunk crme de menthe in Edinburgh any time in the last hundred years, observed Madame Jeanne.The heathen Scots are not accustomed to the use of civilized liqueurs; I have never seen a customer here take anything beyond whisky, beer, or brandywine.Exactly, Madame, Fergus said, nodding.We do not want Mr.MacAlpines tapmen broaching the cask, do we?Surely somebodys going to look in that cask sooner or later, I said.Not to be indelicate, but  Exactly, milady, Fergus said, with a respectful bow to me.Though crme de menthe has a very high content of alcohol.The taverns cellar is but a temporary resting place on our unknown friends journey to his eternal rest.He goes to the docks tomorrow, and thence to somewhere quite far away.It is only that I did not want him cluttering up Madame Jeannes premises in the meantime.Jeanne addressed a remark in French to St.Agnes that I didnt quite catch, but then shrugged and turned to go.I will make inquiries of les filles concerning this seaman tomorrow, Monsieur, when they are at leisure.For now  For now, speaking of leisure, Fergus interrupted, might Mademoiselle Sophie find herself unemployed this evening?The madam favored him with a look of ironic amusement.Since she saw you come in, mon petit saucisse, I expect that she has kept herself available.She glanced at Young Ian, slouched against the cushions like a scarecrow from which all the straw stuffing has been removed.And will I find a place for the young gentleman to sleep?Oh, aye.Jamie looked consideringly at his nephew.I suppose ye can lay a pallet in my room.Oh, no!Young Ian blurted.Youll want to be alone wi your wife, will ye not, Uncle?What?Jamie stared at him uncomprehendingly.Well, I mean Young Ian hesitated, glancing at me, and then hastily away.I mean, nay doubt youll be wanting toermmphm?A Highlander born, he managed to infuse this last noise with an amazing wealth of implied indelicacy.Jamie rubbed his knuckles hard across his upper lip.Well, thats verra thoughtful of ye, Ian, he said.His voice quivered slightly with the effort of not laughing.And Im flattered that ye have such a high opinion of my virility as to think Im capable of anything but sleeping in bed after a day like this.But I think perhaps I can forgo the satisfaction of my carnal desires for one nightfond as I am of your auntie, he added, giving me a faint grin.But Bruno tells me the establishment is not busy tonight, Fergus put in, glancing round in some bewilderment.Why does the boy not  Because hes no but fourteen, for Gods sake!Jamie said, scandalized.Almost fifteen!Young Ian corrected, sitting up and looking interested.Well, that is certainly sufficient, Fergus said, with a glance at Madame Jeanne for confirmation.Your brothers were no older when I first brought them here, and they acquitted themselves honorably.You what?Jamie goggled at his protg.Well, someone had to, Fergus said, with slight impatience.Normally, a boys fatherbut of course, le Monsieur is notmeaning no disrespect to your esteemed father, of course, he added, with a nod to Young Ian, who nodded back like a mechanical toy, but it is a matter for experienced judgment, you understand?Nowhe turned to Madame Jeanne, with the air of a gourmand consulting the wine stewardDorcas, do you think, or Penelope?No, no, she said, shaking her head decidedly, it should be the second Mary, absolutely.The small one.Oh, with the yellow hair?Yes, I think you are right, Fergus said approvingly.Fetch her, then.Jeanne was off before Jamie could manage more than a strangled croak in protest.Butbutthe lad canna he began.Yes, I can, Young Ian said.At least, I think I can.It wasnt possible for his face to grow any redder, but his ears were crimson with excitement, the traumatic events of the day completely forgotten.But itsthat is to sayI canna be letting ye Jamie broke off and stood glaring at his nephew for a long moment.Finally, he threw his hands up in the air in exasperated defeat.And what am I to say to your mother?he demanded, as the door opened behind him.Framed in the door stood a very short young girl, plump and soft as a partridge in her blue silk chemise, her round sweet face beaming beneath a loose cloud of yellow hair.At the sight of her, Young Ian froze, scarcely breathing.When at last he must draw breath or die, he drew it, and turned to Jamie.With a smile of surpassing sweetness, he said, Well, Uncle Jamie, if I were youhis voice soared up in a sudden alarming soprano, and he stopped, clearing his throat before resuming in a respectable baritoneI wouldna tell her.Good night to ye, Auntie, he said, and walked purposefully forward.I canna decide whether I must kill Fergus or thank him.Jamie was sitting on the bed in our attic room, slowly unbuttoning his shirt.I laid the damp dress over the stool and knelt down in front of him to unbuckle the knee buckles of his breeches.I suppose he was trying to do his best for Young Ian.Ayein his bloody immoral French way.Jamie reached back to untie the lace that held his hair back.He had not plaited it again when we left Moubrays, and it fell soft and loose on his shoulders, framing the broad cheekbones and long straight nose, so that he looked like one of the fiercer Italian angels of the Renaissance.Was it the Archangel Michael who drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden?I asked, stripping off his stockings.He gave a slight chuckle.Do I strike ye soas the guardian o virtue?And Fergus as the wicked serpent?His hands came under my elbows as he bent to lift me up.Get up, Sassenach; ye shouldna be on your knees, serving me.Youve had rather a time of it today yourself, I answered, making him stand up with me.Even if you didnt have to kill anyone.There were large blisters on his hands, and while he had wiped away most of the soot, there was still a streak down the side of his jaw.Mm.My hands went around his waist to help with the waistband of his breeches, but he held them there, resting his cheek for a moment against the top of my head.I wasna quite honest wi the lad, ye ken, he said.No?I thought you did wonderfully with him.He felt better after he talked to you, at least.Aye, I hope so.And may be the prayers and such will helpthey canna hurt him, at least.But I didna tell him everything.What else is there?I tilted up my face to his, touching his lips softly with my own.He smelled of smoke and sweat.What a man most often does, when hes soul sick wi killing, is to find a woman, Sassenach, he answered softly.His own, if he can; another, if he must.For she can do what he cannotand heal him.My fingers found the lacing of his fly; it came loose with a tug.Thats why you let him go with the second Mary?He shrugged, and stepping back a pace, pushed the breeches down and off.I couldna stop him.And I think perhaps I was right to let him, young as he is.He smiled crookedly at me.At least hell not be fashing and fretting himself over that seaman tonight.I dont imagine so.And what about you?I pulled the chemise off over my head.Me?He stared down at me, eyebrows raised, the grimy linen shirt hanging loose upon his shoulders.I glanced behind him at the bed.Yes.You havent killed anyone, but do you want tommphm?I met his gaze, raising my own brows in question.The smile broadened across his face, and any resemblance to Michael, stern guardian of virtue, vanished.He lifted one shoulder, then the other, and let them fall, and the shirt slid down his arms to the floor.I expect I do, he said.But youll be gentle wi me, aye?29  CULLODENS LAST VICTIM  In the morning, I saw Jamie and Ian off on their pious errand, and then set off myself, stopping to purchase a large wicker basket from a vendor in the street.It was time I began to equip myself again, with whatever I could find in the way of medical supplies.After the events of the preceding day, I was beginning to fear I would have need of them before long.Haughs apothecary shop hadnt changed at all, through English occupation, Scottish Rising, and the Stuarts fall, and my heart rose in delight as I stepped through the door into the rich, familiar smells of hartshorn, peppermint, almond oil, and anise.The man behind the counter was Haugh, but a much younger Haugh than the middle aged man I had dealt with twenty years before, when I had patronized this shop for tidbits of military intelligence, as well as for nostrums and herbs.The younger Haugh did not know me, of course, but went courteously about the business of finding the herbs I wanted, among the neatly ranged jars on his shelves.A good many were commonrosemary, tansy, marigoldbut a few on my list made the young Haughs ginger eyebrows rise, and his lips purse in thoughtfulness as he looked over the jars.There was another customer in the shop, hovering near the counter, where tonics were dispensed and compounds ground to order.He strode back and forth, hands clasped behind his back, obviously impatient.After a moment, he came up to the counter.How long?he snapped at Mr.Haughs back.I canna just say, Reverend, the apothecarys voice was apologetic.Louisa did say as twould need to be boiled.The only reply to this was a snort, and the man, tall and narrow shouldered in black, resumed his pacing, glancing from time to time at the doorway to the back room, where the invisible Louisa was presumably at work.The man looked slightly familiar, but I had no time to think where I had seen him before.Mr.Haugh was squinting dubiously at the list I had given him.Aconite, now, he muttered.Aconite.And what might that be, I wonder?Well, its poison, for one thing, I said.Mr.Haughs mouth dropped open momentarily.Its a medicine, too, I assured him.But you have to be careful in the use of it.Externally, its good for rheumatism, but a very tiny amount taken by mouth will lower the rate of the pulse.Good for some kinds of heart trouble.Really, Mr.Haugh said, blinking.He turned to his shelves, looking rather helpless.Er, do ye ken what it smells like, maybe?Taking this for invitation, I came round the counter and began to sort through the jars.They were all carefully labeled, but the labels of some were clearly old, the ink faded, and the paper peeling at the edges.Im afraid Im none so canny wi the medicines as my Da yet, young Mr.Haugh was saying at my elbow.Hed taught me a good bit, but then he passed on a year ago, and theres things here as I dinna ken the use of, Im afraid.Well, that ones good for cough, I said, taking down a jar of elecampane with a glance at the impatient Reverend, who had taken out a handkerchief and was wheezing asthmatically into it.Particularly sticky sounding coughs.I frowned at the crowded shelves.Everything was dusted and immaculate, but evidently not filed according either to alphabetical or botanical order.Had old Mr.Haugh merely remembered where things were, or had he a system of some kind?I closed my eyes and tried to remember the last time I had been in the shop.To my surprise, the image came back easily.I had come for foxglove then, to make the infusions for Alex Randall, younger brother of Black Jack Randalland Franks six times great grandfather.Poor boy, he had been dead now twenty years, though he had lived long enough to sire a son.I felt a twinge of curiosity at the thought of that son, and of his mother, who had been my friend, but I forced my mind away from them, back to the image of Mr.Haugh, standing on tiptoe to reach up to his shelves, over near the right hand side  There.Sure enough, my hand rested near the jar labeled FOXGLOVE.To one side of it was a jar labeled HORSETAIL, to the other, LILY OF THE VALLEY ROOT.I hesitated, looking at them, running over in my mind the possible uses of those herbs.Cardiac herbs, all of them.If aconite was to be found, it would be close by, then.It was.I found it quickly, in a jar labeled AULD WIVES HUID.Be careful with it.I handed the jar gingerly to Mr.Haugh.Even a bit of it will make your skin go numb.Perhaps Id better have a glass bottle for it.Most of the herbs Id bought had been wrapped up in squares of gauze or twisted in screws of paper, but the young Mr.Haugh nodded and carried the jar of aconite into the back room, held at arms length, as though he expected it to explode in his face.Yed seem to know a good deal more about the medicines than the lad, said a deep, hoarse voice behind me.Well, Ive somewhat more experience than he has, likely.I turned to find the minister leaning on the counter, watching me under thick brows with pale blue eyes.I realized with a start where I had seen him; in Moubrays, the day before.He gave no sign of recognizing me; perhaps because my cloak covered Daphnes dress.I had noticed that many men took relatively little notice of the face of a woman en dcolletage, though it seemed a regrettable habit in a clergyman.He cleared his throat.Mmphm.And dye ken what to do for a nervous complaint, then?What sort of nervous complaint?He pursed his lips and frowned, as though unsure whether to trust me.The upper lip came to a slight point, like an owls beak, but the lower was thick and pendulous.Welltis a complicated case.But to speak generally, nowhe eyed me carefullywhat would ye give for a sort offit?Epileptic seizure?Where the person falls down and twitches?He shook his head, showing a reddened band about his neck, where the high white stock had chafed it.No, a different kind of fit.Screaming and staring.Screaming and staring?Not at once, ye ken, he added hastily.First the one, and then the otheror rather, roundabout.First shell do naught but stare for days on end, not speaking, and then of a sudden, shell scream fit to wake the deid.That sounds very trying.It did; if he had a wife so afflicted, it could easily explain the deep lines of strain that bracketed his mouth and eyes, and the blue circles of exhaustion beneath his eyes.I tapped a finger on the counter, considering.I dont know; Id have to see the patient.The ministers tongue touched his lower lip.Perhapswould ye be willing maybe, to come and see her?It isnt far, he added, rather stiffly.Pleading didnt come naturally to him, but the urgency of his request communicated itself despite the stiffness of his figure.I cant, just now, I told him.I have to meet my husband.But perhaps this afternoon  Two oclock, he said promptly.Hendersons, in Carrubbers Close.Campbell is the name, the Reverend Archibald Campbell.Before I could say yes or no, the curtain between the front room and the back twitched aside, and Mr.Haugh appeared with two bottles, one of which he handed to each of us.The Reverend eyed his with suspicion, as he groped in his pocket for a coin.Weel, and theres your price, he said ungraciously, slapping it on the counter.And well hope as youve given me the right one, and no the ladys poison.The curtain rustled again and a woman looked out after the departing form of the minister.Good riddance, she remarked.Happence for an hours work, and insult on the top of it!The Lord might ha chosen better, is all I can say!Do you know him?I asked, curious whether Louisa might have any helpful information about the afflicted wife.Not to say I ken him weel, no, Louisa said, staring at me in frank curiosity.Hes one o they Free Church meenisters, as is always rantin on the corner by the Market Cross, tellin folk as their behaviors of nay consequence at all, and all thats needful for salvation is that they shall come to grips wi Jesuslike as if Our Lord was to be a fair day wrestler!She sniffed disdainfully at this heretical viewpoint, crossing herself against contamination.Im surprised the likes of the Reverend Campbell should come in our shop, hearin what he thinks o Papists by and large.Her eyes sharpened at me.But youll maybe be Free Church yoursel, maam; meanin no offense to ye, if so.No, Im a Catholicer, a Papist, too, I assured her.I was only wondering whether you knew anything about the Reverends wife, and her condition.Louisa shook her head, turning to deal with a new customer.Nay, Ive neer seen the lady.But whatevers the matter with her, she added, frowning after the departed Reverend, Im sure that livin wi him doesna improve it any!The weather was chill but clear, and only a faint hint of smoke lingered in the Rectory garden as a reminder of the fire.Jamie and I sat on a bench against the wall, absorbing the pale winter sunshine as we waited for Young Ian to finish his confession.Did you tell Ian that load of rubbish he gave Young Ian yesterday?About where Id been all this time?Oh, aye, he said.Ians a good deal too canny to believe it, but its a likely enough story, and hes too good a friend to insist on the truth.I suppose it will do, for general consumption, I agreed.But shouldnt you have told it to Sir Percival, instead of letting him think we were newlyweds?He shook his head decidedly.Och, no.For the one thing, Sir Percival has no notion of my real name, though Ill lay a years takings he knows it isna Malcolm.I dinna want him to be thinking of me and Culloden together, by any means.And for another, a story like the one I gave Ian would cause the devil of a lot more talk than the news that the printers taken a wife.Oh, what a tangled web we weave, I intoned, when first we practice to deceive.He gave me a quick blue glance, and the corner of his mouth lifted slightly.It gets a bit easier with practice, Sassenach, he said.Try living wi me for a time, and yell find yourself spinning silk out of your arse easy as sh, er, easy as kiss my hand.I burst out laughing.I want to see you do that, I said.You already have.He stood up and craned his neck, trying to see over the wall into the Rectory garden.Young Ians being the devil of a time, he remarked, sitting down again.How can a lad not yet fifteen have that much to confess?After the day and night he had yesterday?I suppose it depends how much detail Father Hayes wants to hear, I said, with a vivid recollection of my breakfast with the prostitutes.Has he been in there all this time?Er, no.The tips of Jamies ears grew slightly pinker in the morning light.I, er, I had to go first.As an example, ye ken.No wonder it took some time, I said, teasing.How long has it been since youve been to confession?I told Father Hayes it was six months.And was it?No, but I supposed if he was going to shrive me for thieving, assault, and profane language, he might as well shrive me for lying, too.What, no fornication or impure thoughts?Certainly not, he said austerely.Ye can think any manner of horrible things without sin, and its to do wi your wife.Its only if youre thinking it about other ladies, its impure.I had no idea I was coming back to save your soul, I said primly, but its nice to be useful.He laughed, bent and kissed me thoroughly.I wonder if that counts as an indulgence, he said, pausing for breath.It ought to, no?It does a great deal more to keep a man from the fires of hell than saying the rosary does.Speaking of which, he added, digging into his pocket and coming out with a rather chewed looking wooden rosary, remind me that I must say my penance sometime today.I was about to start on it, when ye came up.How many Hail Marys are you supposed to say?I asked, fingering the beads.The chewed appearance wasnt illusion; there were definite small toothmarks on most of the beads.I met a Jew last year, he said, ignoring the question.A natural philosopher, whod sailed round the world six times.He told me that in both the Musselman faith and the Jewish teachings, it was considered an act of virtue for a man and his wife to lie wi each other.I wonder if that has anything to do wi both Jews and Musselmen being circumcised?he added thoughtfully.I never thought to ask him thatthough perhaps he would ha found it indelicate to say.I shouldnt think a foreskin more or less would impair the virtue, I assured him.Oh, good, he said, and kissed me once more.What happened to your rosary?I asked, picking up the string where it had fallen on the grass.It looks like the rats have been at it.Not rats, he said.Bairns.What bairns?Oh, any that might be about.He shrugged, tucking the beads back in his pocket.Young Jamie has three now, and Maggie and Kitty two each.Wee Michaels just married, but his wifes breeding.The sun was behind him, darkening his face, so that his teeth flashed suddenly white when he smiled.Ye didna ken ye were a great aunt seven times over, aye?A great aunt?I said, staggered.Well, Im a great uncle, he said cheerfully, and I havena found it a terrible trial, except for having my beads gnawed when the weans are cutting teeththat, and bein expected to answer to Nunkie a lot.Sometimes twenty years seemed like an instant, and sometimes it seemed like a very long time indeed.Erthere isnt a feminine equivalent of Nunkie, I hope?Oh, no, he assured me.Theyll all call ye Great Auntie Claire, and treat ye wi the utmost respect.Thanks a lot, I muttered, with visions of the hospitals geriatric wing fresh in my mind.Jamie laughed, and with a lightness of heart no doubt engendered by being newly freed from sin, grasped me around the waist and lifted me onto his lap.Ive never before seen a great auntie wi a lovely plump arse like that, he said with approval, bouncing me slightly on his knees.His breath tickled the back of my neck as he leaned forward.I let out a small shriek as his teeth closed lightly on my ear.Are ye all right, Auntie?said Young Ians voice just behind us, full of concern.Jamie started convulsively, nearly unshipping me from his lap, then tightened his hold on my waist.Oh, aye, he said.Its just your auntie saw a spider.Where?said Young Ian, peering interestedly over the bench.Up there.Jamie rose, standing me on my feet, and pointed to the lime tree, wheresure enoughthe web of an orb weaver stretched across the crook of two branches, sparkling with damp.The weaver herself sat in the center, round as a cherry, wearing a gaudy pattern of green and yellow on her back.I was telling your auntie, Jamie said, as Young Ian examined the web in lashless fascination, about a Jew I met, a natural philosopher.Hed made a study of spiders, it seems; in fact, he was in Edinburgh to deliver a learned paper to the Royal Society, in spite of being a Jew.Really?Did he tell ye a lot about spiders?Young Ian asked eagerly.A lot more than I cared to know, Jamie informed his nephew.There are times and places for talkin of spiders that lay eggs in caterpillars so the young hatch out and devour the poor beast while its still alive, but during supper isna one of them.He did say one thing I thought verra interesting, though, he added, squinting at the web.He blew gently on it, and the spider scuttled briskly into hiding.He said that spiders spin two kinds of silk, and if ye have a lensand can make the spider sit still for it, I supposeye can see the two places where the silk comes out; spinnerets, he called them.
